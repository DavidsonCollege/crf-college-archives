Only tame kittens and yes-men lack foes. —Rabbi Louis Newman

Deepest sympathy is extended to Charles Kraemer in the death of his father.

### SUGGESTIONS

It is not often that one gets to see a football game like the one with Citadel. Davidson has played
few teams that tackled harder and played CLEANER FOOTBALL than the Bulldogs. Students should be particularly proud to hold a
victory over such a group of players.

One cannot help wondering how many bands will be in attendance Saturday. It was last Thanksgiving that the Duke band
and the Gastonia Fife and Bugle (and drum) Corps had their contest to see which could play the longest.

Few students could have been left on the campus Saturday. It was one of the best attendances to foreign games
in the last three seasons.

Just because you are not being bored to distraction with it, don’t forget the boys’ library sponsored by the “Y.”

If everybody would plunge himself into some phase of extra-curricular activity, these activities would in all probability improve. It is
all right to poke the fire at times, but it won’t burn forever if fuel isn’t added.

Custom demands that everybody speak to alumni as well as to fellow students when meeting them on the campus.

### MORE POWER TO THEM

We cannot pass the week without a word of commendation to the football team for the manner in which it
came back at Citadel. Once again the Wildcats displayed the fact that defeat can be forgotten and erased in victory.

There were many interesting incidents in Charlotte. It would be impossible to laud any one individual more than another. The
line held and the backs ran; what more can be said? We leave additional comments to the sports writer. But,
we will say that teamwork was the deciding factor in the day’s activities. Dumas’ famous remark, “One for all and
all for one,” received a modern application.

This optimistic recovery has ever been the manner of Davidson teams. However, the present circumstances appear a little more stringent
than usual. The defeat in Durham hurt; no one denies that. There are no alibis; there is no criticism, but
the sting was there. Students and other people had begun to whisper the magic words “State Championship.” Seniors, especially, may
have been guilty of the wonder phrase; they heard all about the sensation from the upperclassmen in their freshman year.
At first glance, the Duke game damaged predictions. There is still a fighting chance for the State Championship. It is
in a crisis that the Wildcats have ever looked their best. We do not hesitate to prophesy victories, with the
opposing team being shut out, for the rest of the season if the team plays like it.

### VOTE OF TRIBUTE TO THE Y. M. C. A.

Through the efforts of the Y. M. C. A. and the Senior class, each Davidson man will have the opportunity
to invite a guest for the weekend program. No one need feel any reluctance in doing this. Students should not
forget that there is a place for social life as well as the intellectual and physical. The man is at
a distinct loss who does not know how to conduct himself in the presence of other men and young ladies.
Even women-haters have been known to fill necessary social obligations.

For those who entertain any doubt as to the accommodations provided, we would suggest that they drop in the Social
Center for a few minutes sometime during the day or night. Acting as head of the department in charge of
social life on the Y. M. C. A. cabinet, M. W. Norfleet has done much to furnish an attractive and
comfortable social plant. Divided into two large rooms, the Social Center possesses every necessity for a successful reception. Chairs, upholstered
and luxurious, are placed around a cheerful fireplace, radio, and victrola. In the other room, a piano and other furniture
will give ample opportunity for music to those who are so inclined. Two distinct advantages are noted; those who wish
to create music can do it, and those who do not wish to listen do not have to. It is
a happy medium.

However, the whole matter resolves itself into the fact that the Senior class and the Y. M. C. A. can
do little if the students are not willing. A party to which no one comes is usually dead. There can
be no reception if there is no one to receive.

### THE ANNUAL PILGRIMAGE

Each year a large number of alumni trek back to the scene of their undergraduate life. It is impossible for
the student to fully appreciate the feelings which probably surge forward in their hearts when they retrace the old walks
of the eighties and nineties. It is needless to remark that they are many and varied. It is true that
Elm and Oak Rows no longer serve as dormitories or as fraternity halls. Students do not have to go out
and cut their own firewood or fill their kerosene lamps. Those who go to Charlotte can do so and return
in the afternoon, regardless of train schedules. It is no longer necessary to sit in a buggy for six or
seven hours in order to make the trip. Progress has speeded up transportation, but it still takes about the same
length of time to get a degree. Courses have been added to the curriculum, yet it is doubtful if present-day
students learn much more. The fundamental basis remains the same.

Nor is the educational side of college life the only part that has not changed. Two or three traditions had
their origin while men who are now alumni were in school; they had to be started then to become traditions.
That “Wildcat Spirit” so frequently lauded and praised made its appearance long ago. It is fortunate that it did. We
doubt if there is a Davidson graduate living who can remember when Davidson men failed to speak to each other
as they passed on the campus. As with these, so with numerous other customs!

Love for one’s Alma Mater is not a modern or unique idea. Someone experienced the emotion years ago; others have
had it because they felt that “it was the thing to do,” but the majority have yielded to the admiration
and devotion for their college. Davidson soil did not become hallowed in a fortnight; its professors were respected in the
past as they are today.

Homecoming day is one time when the business and professional man would like to be considered an undergraduate again. Oftentimes
students are prone to stand aloof of their distinguished visitors. We do not believe that this is the attitude desired
by returning men. It will be as Davidson men rather than as alumni that they will wish to be welcomed.
It will be easy to be especially congenial with the “baby alumni.” Seniors, Juniors, and Sophomores alike remember the men
who graduated last June. They will still appear in the light of schoolmates. Every alumnus was once a “baby one.”
Passing years have made little difference in their devotion to Davidson.

A few years ago there was a large lake situated where the golf course now is. For various and sundry
reasons, the water was allowed to drain from it; the land was restored and the present course constructed. Aside from
the new building, it is probably the biggest change noticeable to...men who did last Saturday. Unanimously, the student body wishes
to congratulate the team for its victory over the Citadel. May there be many more like it.

What Do You Know About? A quarter-mile up? Real Higher Education? The Chain Gang? The Annual Date Race?

The title of the “tallest building in the world” is one of a most transitory nature along the ever-changing skyline
of New York City. The Chrysler building, only recently completed and which points its flagpole well over a thousand feet
into the air, wrested that name away from the Woolworth tower which had for so long a time been a
Mecca for tourists. But the position of the Chrysler building is destined to be short-lived, for the Empire State building,
rapidly nearing completion, towers almost two hundred feet above the present title holder. It is 1,250 feet high, or only
70 feet short of a quarter of a mile. It is surmounted by a mooring mast for dirigibles which is
itself 205 feet above the top of the 85 stories in the massive office building. One of the distinctive features
of the architecture are the strips of stainless steel running up the sides of the building. These will tend to
give an appearance of even greater height and will make the tower visible for a long way off as the
sun hits the shining metal and is reflected back.

“The future may be better or worse.” —Calvin Coolidge.

Another building piercing the skyline of one of the large cities in America is the 42-story home of the University
of Pittsburgh, now nearing completion in that city. All departments of the University, whose enrollment is 11,000 annually, will be
housed in this one structure, believed to be the largest college building in the world. Heretofore the different schools of
the institution have been scattered over various parts of Pittsburgh. It has long been the dream of the founder of
the school to have it unified into one campus, and this great building will do that.

“He started for the South Pole and I started for the White House—and it gives me supreme satisfaction to say
that I got back twenty months before he did.” —Al Smith, in introducing Richard E. Byrd.

Recent reports on the earnings of the various chain store organizations in the United States for the first nine months
of the year show that no matter what else the American must have, he sees to it that there is
always something on his table to eat every time meal time comes around. Earnings of the great Atlantic and Pacific
Tea Company, better known as the “A. & P.” show earnings to be over 400 million dollars. This sum is
nearly four times that of any other national organization for the same period. But in spite of the tremendous leadership
in total earnings of the A. & P., other chain organizations are far from being left completely out. The 26
organizations reporting show large returns, without exception, and nine of them show profits of over 100 million dollars for nine
months. This is in spite of heavy and growing opposition in some sections of the country.

“I am not bored yet.” —Zaro Agha, 156-year-old Turk.

With Sir Thomas Lipton’s ill-fated yacht race nearly out of the minds of all newspaper readers, another race much more
prosaic but certainly for bigger stakes, can be noticed. This is the annual race to land the first boatload of
dates—the edible kind—in New York from their shipping points in Smyrna and along the Red Sea. Each year the various
shippers try to get the first boatload into the New York market in order to command the best price for
the commodity. The first load generally contains the choicest dates of the market, and thereby commands the best price. Within
a day after their arrival in New York, they have been transferred to freight cars and are headed across the
continent to various distributing points. For a number of years the Hill Bros. Co. has been the successful concern in
getting their delicacy to the marts of trade first. This year their boat made the trip from Smyrna in a
little over 26 days, 10 days better than the previous record. The Hill company, packers of Dromedary dates, offer an
annual bonus to the captain of their vessel who gets the first load to dock.

Fortunately, when water recedes from a particular location it leaves a sediment behind it. As a rule, this soil is
the richest land for any purpose. The number of years in the lives of alumni has decreased; a sediment of
love for Davidson still remains. Like a flood over the river bottom, Homecoming Day will increase the richness of the
heart.

MATADOR. VEREEN

This is a love story. Ah, isn’t it beautiful? Our heroine is none other than Susie Leventrees, the great cinema
star. The hero is Donald Ricardo Pedro Lopez Cordo, the leading man in “The Songs of Sam.” Donald is very
much in love with Susie, who because of her love for the stage, told Donald that she could never love
him but she would always be a sister to him. He seizes this advantage and tries to borrow two bits
from her, calling her “sis.” She said, “No. I shan’t loan you anything. Where is them two bits I lent
you last Lent?”

“But darling, you'll be paid in time.”

“I’d rather be paid in cash!”

This was a terrible blow to Donald. What would the folks think? But he was comforted by the thought that
no matter how low the thermometer falls, it’s never vulgar.

“Susie, I know you have a lot of money but I would be marrying you for love because I love
money.”

“I’ll never marry an actor.”

“Well, I guess that means no hits, no runs, no heiress.”

“If you'll go to work at something else I might marry you.”

“I don't know anything else.”

“You could go to school and learn something else,” said Susie with tears in her eyes.

“How about going to a School of Pharmacy?” asked Donald, hopefully.

“Oh; I’d just love being a farmer’s wife,” she answered, with joy in her voice and bugs in her ears.

“Oh, no. A school of Pharmacy is to train men for the drug store business.”

“I see. A sort of Sundae School, huh?”

“Well, if you want to call it that. I am going to take the school work. Are you going to
marry me?”

“Yes, I'll marry you. But then who’s going to marry me?” Susie was plainly distressed.

“Oh, pshaw, Susie! I’ll marry you, and you'll marry me. We'll marry each other and the preacher will marry both
of us. How’s that?”

“That's fine; how are you?”

“Some better thanks; how are you? When are we going to be married?” said Donald.

“Let’s both get married on the same day. Won't that be a coincidence?”

“Suppose the preacher won’t marry both on the same day. Maybe he hasn’t time to marry but one of us,”
mused Donald with his pockets in his pants.

“Oh, goody, I bid to be married first,” laughed Susie dancing around the ceiling of the room.

“All right then, selfish. I’m going to Niagara Falls for my honeymoon. Where are you going on yours?”

“I’m not going to tell you. Why do you always pry into other people’s affairs?”

“Well don’t tell me then.”

“I’ll tell you what you had better do right now, though, if I’m not too inquisitive,” said Susie.

“What?”

“You had better go tell Dad and Maw about it first. They might be glad to hear about it.”

Interlude of a few minutes. Sounds of argument drift lazily from within. Donald comes back with a leer of dirt
upon his face.

“Donald,” said Susie, her voice trembling, “did you sound them out?”

“Yes,” answered Donald Ricardo Pedro Lopez Cordo (the leading man in the “Songs of Sam”), “I sounded them out and
your father sounded the worst.”

“Well, I don’t guess we can get married. I wanted to go to the dentist’s anyway tomorrow.” This from Susie:
“And now won’t you join me in a cup of coffee?”

“You get in first and if there is any more room I'll join you.”

And thus we leave these two to their own devices. Don’t take any wooden nickels.

If the spires of Oxford dream nowadays, their dreams must be nightmares. —John Buchan.

In women, intelligence, unlike beauty, grows steadily better with age. —William Lyon Phelps.

Yes, the intellectuals always have microscopes before their eyes. —Professor Albert Einstein.

You can get a lot out of life by just looking at it. —Louise Kennedy Mabie.

The limits of production will be reached when everyone has all the goods he needs. —Henry Ford.

A highbrow is one educated above his intelligence. —Iver Brown.

Art should not interpret—art should challenge the times. —Attilo Piccirilli, sculptor.
