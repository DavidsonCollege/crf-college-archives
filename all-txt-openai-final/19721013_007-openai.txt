**Fallout Rations Are Stored In Basement**

"It's a million rounds of ammunition. They'll use it to put down a student rebellion," said Sanford Steelman in regard to the large supply of boxes currently stored in the northeast corner of the Belk Dormitory basement.

A freshman stumbling down the steps from the Davidson College Student Store paused to examine the cache. "Those are all the books they don’t have in the bookstore," announced John Steely.

Assistant to the President Duff Bruce admitted when asked what was in the box, "I think it’s pretty obvious to anybody. That's the uranium for the reactor."

However, Custodian Sergeant Penley, when asked about the corrugated cardboard containers wedged between bicycles and vending machines, swept aside these previous speculations. "Well, those boxes are the emergency ration kits for this defense," Penley said. "If there was some kind of emergency, they'd come in mighty handy."

According to Sam D. Maloney, chairman of the Fallout Preparedness Committee at Davidson, these boxes contain Civil Defense supplies, mainly crackers and food supplements. "These supplies are designed to last the occupants for approximately two weeks," he said. "There is also a radioactive materials detection device located there," Maloney added.

Belk Dormitory is one of fifteen fallout shelters located on the Davidson campus. According to the Fallout Preparedness Committee's 1971-72 year-end report, Belk Dormitory has fallout shelter space for 2874 people. About 1250 spaces are stocked. The cartons had been accompanied by water drums until permission was received from state and county offices of Civil Defense to dispose of these cans.

"These shelters," Maloney emphasized, "are not bomb shelters. There are no primary targets in North Carolina... at least, that we know of." Maloney admitted. In the June 30, 1971, report of the Davidson Fallout Preparedness Committee, Maloney stated, "The assumption is made that in non-blast areas, one hour and fifteen minutes will be available in which to take cover in a shelter area."

Maloney indicated that the fallout shelter program became of primary public interest during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. "However, the shelters have been expanded to handle any emergency," he explained. "The food supplies are replaced every ten years, and the radioactive detection devices are inspected biannually," he said.

**Davidson On TV**

A rock concert filmed at Davidson College two years ago will be featured on a television special Monday, October 16 at 8 p.m. on the six other stations of the University of North Carolina Television Network. The program, "The First Edition: Tell It All," will feature the Davidson concert as a part of a behind-the-scenes look at the rock music group, Kenny Rogers and the First Edition. A producer from South Carolina ETV followed the group on tour in both North and South Carolina to film this documentary which combines the group's music with scenes of their lifestyle on the road -- in auditoriums, motel rooms, and on a Greyhound bus.

**AN ANALYSIS**

Staff Writer

The fight for retiring Congressman Charles Jonas’ seat between Republican Jim Martin, a Davidson College chemistry professor and former county commissioner, and Democrat Jim Beatty, a Charlotte businessman and state legislator, is shaping up as a race which will confuse the voters in Mecklenburg, Lincoln, and Iredell counties rather than offering them a clear choice. The candidates refuse to differ sharply on any issues, thereby posing a dilemma for those casting ballots in the 9th District on Nov. 7.

Jim Martin is running a campaign similar to those being run by other Southern Republicans this year. He readily admits that he is counting heavily on the apparent Nixon victory to propel him into Congress, and he has likewise attempted to associate Beatty with George McGovern. Polls out of Raleigh show, however, that statewide Democrats, from senatorial nominee Nick Galifianakis to General Assembly candidates, do not stand to suffer markedly by Sen. McGovern’s unpopularity. Any attempt by Martin to label his opponent as leftist and radical will probably be as unsuccessful as previous similar attempts by Republicans (Jim Holshouser, moderate gubernatorial candidate, and Jesse Helms, reactionary senatorial candidate, were both ridiculed by state press when they called their opponents leftists).

If Martin is to retain this seat for the Republicans, he must speak to the issues more clearly and force his opponent to do the same. Martin's conservatism ("Possession of marijuana should remain a felony" and "Congress has hurt the President's Vietnam policies") certainly has appeal in this part of the state. An aggressive, issue-oriented October campaign could well be the key to a Martin victory in November.

**Hopefuls Offer No Clear Choice**

Jim Beatty, the former worldRecord holder for the mile run, is running from the national ticket as hard as he can. In an effort to disassociate his candidacy from the McGovern ticket, he has labeled himself ‘a compassionate conservative.’ Beatty has said that he will vote for the national ticket but is quick to add that he is not particularly fond of George McGovern. Out of political necessity, Beatty has become a classic example of the fence-straddler. He has hedged on the highly controversial busing issue in an attempt to hold on to his strong black support while appealing to the moderate and conservative Democrats, so vital to a Beatty victory. 

From May through September, Beatty has relied quite heavily on his organization and his charm and popularity as an ex-athletic hero. In this close race, smiles and four-minute miles will not be enough. Beatty must also speak to the issues and prove himself to be a desirable alternative to Rep. Jonas’ successor-designate. Beatty's positions on Vietnam (withdrawal contingent upon an agreement for the release of prisoners), marijuana (decriminalization of penalties), and amnesty for draft evaders (service in Peace Corps, VISTA, etc.) will be under attack by Martin, and he must stand firm on those issues in order to hold fast to his natural Democratic constituency. 

Hopefully, this disappointing campaign will begin to speak to the people during the final month before the election. Martin, counting on Nixon coattails, seems cautiously optimistic, and Beatty, relying on large chunks of the black, youth, and labor vote, says that ‘our position remains solid, but I know we will have a highly competitive situation this fall.’ A Davidson student, after hearing a Beatty-Martin debate in Perkins Auditorium this spring, remarked that the only difference between the two was their preference in the presidential election. Now even that distinction seems to have melted away. Neither of these men deserves the 9th District seat until they address themselves squarely to the problems facing the district, take political risks, and offer the voters a real choice.

‘Women At Yale’ Shows Coed Problems At Male Stronghold

A Review By PETER GRAHAM

Fall of 1969 brought radical change to the Yale University campus. For the first time, women were admitted to the undergraduate colleges. Graduate sociology students Janet Lever and Pepper Schwartz were right on hand to chronicle that first crucial year of coeducation, and they have written “Women at Yale: Liberating A College Campus.” 

Beginning in the Dark Ages of Dink Stover, Gothic halls, preppie poise, and three-piece suits, Lever and Schwartz delineate those customs and necessities which created a cohesive, all-male Yale where Woman intruded only in the guise of date-ornament-sexual outlet. Proceeding from generalities to specifics, subsequent chapters deal with the social institutions characteristic of single-sex schools. Notable among these rituals are the Mixer and the Weekend. Drawing heavily upon transactional analysis, the authors dissect the Mixer mentality and its precarious ego-building games. 

Lever and Schwartz move on to 1969, the year of coeducation. They observe that, thanks to the Mixer and its extended counterpart, the Weekend of Road-trip, Yale men objectified the female. With women relegated to the status of occasional playthings, Yale men found it difficult to accept their new coeds as classmates and associates. The girls, in turn, wrestled with their own problems. While most of the coeds, refugees from Eastern girls’ schools, found Yale intellectually stimulating, they discovered that for a time at least, they lacked a place in the school's social life. Furthermore, many were perturbed by the goldfish-bowl prominence of their roles and were frustrated that necessity and the Yale man labeled them ‘women’ first and ‘students’ second. 

However, new male-female relationships began to emerge, the date-friend dichotomy weakened, and the men and women of Yale moved toward a more natural, less formalized social system. The authors, both proponents of women’s liberation, assert that much change is still needed, particularly in student concepts of femininity and bona fide equality of women; but they predict success for coeducation at Yale. 

Time passes, and since the 1969-70 school year of Schwartz and Lever's study, much has transpired. Yale's first coed freshmen are this year's seniors. Yale's class of ‘73 has seen the rise of a collective feminist movement far more militant than anything suggested in the Schwartz-Lever survey. They have also witnessed the solid entrenchment of coeducation at Yale. 

As budding social scientists, Lever and Schwartz exhibit precision in sampling, interviewing, documenting, and their love affair with statistics; and “Women at Yale” seems sound enough from a sociological standpoint. Fortunately, the book is also extremely readable. The authors write effectively, interspersing description and analysis with quoted excerpts from interviews and selected comic strip adventures of folk hero Michael Doonesbury. Read and enjoy “Women at Yale.” Maybe it can help us liberate Davidson.
