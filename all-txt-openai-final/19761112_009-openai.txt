Nat Harrison

In the Rijksmuseum

Well-framed oil
Hangs among fine
Landscapes Dutch have

Drawn. Columned sun
Paper fills the woman’s hands with
Spears sharply prismed planes of
Words. There are no answers in
Her eyes. No strutting wounds, no
Alloyed colours brushed and
Sears, stigmata sag her
Spatulad in fights to
Lit, calm townhouse face among the
Fashion; Drapes that pad a hall of
Form.
We squint and ask:
“What does she read?”
Blue and fluted
Light.
What of the

Scrawlings written in a
World beyond the walls of this

“Vermeer?”

William Barnes
