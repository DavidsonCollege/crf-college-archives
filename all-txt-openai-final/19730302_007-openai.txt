**Student Increase Causes Housing Mess**

By RICHARD ROMEYN
Contributing Editor

The increasing size of the student body and the implementation of coeducation have combined to produce what Director of Student Housing Scotty Nicholls called "a mess of the housing situation."

"It's terrible," she said. "We don't even know how many students there will be."

Next year's enrollment is expected to top 1100 and far outnumbers the 980 bed capacity of the dorms. As a result, several new options will be made available to the student in choosing his housing, and a great number of students will be granted permission to live off campus.

Nicholls sees the room shortage problem as the result of the large freshman classes of recent years. "There are more upperclassmen now than ever before," she said. "And since there has been no significant increase in the number of married students, we will be forced to find additional housing and encourage single students to live off campus."

Two college-owned houses in town have been made available for student housing, and if necessary, a third may also be used. It is expected that they will lodge a maximum of 15 students each, which would account for about one-third of the overflow.

This housing is presently open only to groups "who have a common program interest they wish to develop," and would operate along basic guidelines established at Grey House this year. However, Nicholls said that insufficient interest or the failure of applicants to qualify would cause the housing to be made available to all students via the lottery next term.

Close to 100 upperclassmen are expected to live off campus next year, and Nicholls said she is "encouraging all seniors who are interested to consider living off campus." She added that permission will also be extended to a greater number of juniors than in previous years.

One result of the shift of upperclassmen away from their traditional college housing will be the transformation of Belk into a sophomore dorm. As more seniors go off campus, it is expected that juniors will fill what was previously senior housing in Duke and Little. However, if the freshman class is as large as expected (260 men and 100 coeds), then some freshmen may also be housed in Belk.

"Block Housing" will be another option which would allow groups of students who desire it to be housed as a unit. Nicholls sees the option as enabling sophomores to retain a hall identity in impersonal Belk. "Maybe this will help a little to make more pleasant living," she said.

The expected arrival of 100 coeds next year has also created problems. Nicholls said she had no information on the number of either freshmen or transfers, and thus has not decided where they will be housed. If the number of freshmen coeds reaches the projected level of 100, they would be housed in either Sentelle or Cannon. In that case, junior and senior coeds would be housed on the top two floors of Little as they were this year.

The new housing complex is scheduled to be finished by the fall of...

**COMEDY-BALLET**

Actors rehearse for next week's French drama.

**'Le Bal des Voleurs' Depicts French Knavery, True Love**

The cast of the Comedie-Davidsonienne is busy with the final rehearsals of the play by Jean Anouilh, "Le Bal des Voleurs" (Thieves' Carnival), which will be presented in Hodson Hall at 8:15 p.m. Wednesday night.

Candide Carrasco, assistant to the French Department of Davidson College, is directing a cast of former Junior Year in France students, residents of the Davidson community, and French exchange students from the Charlotte area.

The play will be presented in French, and is open to all Francophiles. Programs in English will also be distributed to give a precise resume of the events of each scene. The play should entertain and amuse even those without any experience with French, for the play is one of Anouilh's comedy-ballets with music, dance, brilliant costumes, and visual comic effects.

Jean Anouilh wrote "Le Bal des Voleurs" in 1956 but he felt that the settings would be the early 1900s, a brighter, more humorous age than the present.

**A BETTER SOLUTION**

Grey House will give 13 students an alternative to dorm living next year.1974 and is expected to alleviate the housing shortage. If the options don’t work out as well as planned, Nicholls said she would consider reverting to the present “no option” lottery system once again.

Physicians’ Services Obtained To Relieve Medical Dilemma
By TOM AINSWORTH
Contributing Editor

The cost of medical services for the North Mecklenburg area may be a high one, but most people think that it would be even higher in terms of more than monetary value if the present situation were not improved. The search for qualified medical personnel to serve the Davidson-Cornelius-Huntersville area was triggered by the loss of Dr. William Davis to a better-paying position around Charlotte. With no young doctors willing to come into the area to practice, coupled with the fact that the few doctors left in the three-community area were nearing retirement age and that Mooresville physicians were refusing to take on any new patients, the outlook was nearing the critical stage.

A central committee was thereupon formed out of three local ones in order to alleviate the situation. Receiving no responses from an area-wide search for medical practitioners, the group, called the North Mecklenburg Medical Development, Inc. (NMMDI), finally resorted to a finding agency in New York to locate doctors. In return for their $13,500 fee, the finding company lined up Drs. Frank Donatelli, Dick Kerecman, and Jerry Howard at the Upstate Medical Center in Syracuse, N.Y., to come into the area and set up a clinical practice in association with the Huntersville Hospital.

The three residents in family practice agreed to come, however, only if all of them could be contracted. Moreover, the NMMDI agreed to contract the doctors for a guaranteed income of $35,000 apiece the first year, followed by yearly increases to $37,500 and $40,000 for the first three years on a reimbursal basis. This means that whatever the doctors make the first three years in practice, the committee will reimburse each of them the difference between the actual and guaranteed incomes for that particular year. The doctors would, however, be required to pay the NMMDI back when they “got on their feet” and the money would go to improving and updating the medical facilities at the clinic.

In moving the physicians and their families down to the North Mecklenburg area, setting up the clinic, and repaying old debts, the NMMDI recently revised their fundraising goal from $50,000 to $70,000. Three of the leading campaign leaders, Davidson's Will Terry, Chairman of the Board of NMMDI James Bradford, and Cornelius Mayor and General Drive Chairman Wes Rood, talked about the cost of such an operation and the general attitudes of the committee.

“Guaranteeing an income is common practice for areas such as this trying to get physicians," said Terry. “There is very little way you can get doctors without doing this. Some places I know of have actually offered as high as $60,000. But the issue is not whether they make $35,000 but whether they make it here,” Terry continued.

Bradford stressed the critical need for operating this way to make a necessary incentive for medical personnel to move. Said Bradford, “It's virtually impossible to get a doctor these days to go into solo practice. Two doctors is only slightly better concerning the workload for a community of 35,000 people and with three doctors you're just getting into the realm of regular working hours for all of them. It was a matter of necessity."

In terms of reaching their expected goal monetarily, Rood indicated that the local drives had netted a total of $37,000 as of last Monday night. He expressed hope that the amount would be sufficient to convince the doctors of the communities’ serious efforts in this project when the two groups meet next week.

To the Davidson community itself, some reassessment was taken to determine the additional needs of the project. As a result, the originally expected goal of $10,000 was recently elevated to $17,500. The college is urging all its faculty members to contribute to the drive. The college's medical needs will be taken care of by a contract between the institution and the practitioner group on a salary for service contract, Terry indicated. He also said that the doctors plan to run a satellite service located in Dr. Davis’ old office in Cornelius to take care of the community as a whole.
