#### Women’s Tennis Puts Forth Tremendous Effort

By EDWIN PAGE

The women’s tennis team had a busy and trying week on the courts as they played five matches in the course of eight days and lost all but one of them. Last Wednesday, the team traveled to Wake Forest. Coach Caroline Brown had hoped to pick up at least two points from the Deacons, but the Cats were thrashed 9-0. Freshman Marion Stone put up the best fight for Davidson as she won her first set and went up 4-0 in the second before eventually falling.

On Friday, the Cats squared off against UNC-Greensboro in the only win of the week. Playing without usual number one player sophomore Amy McNelis, the team nevertheless rolled to an easy 7-2 victory. Stone, playing at number one singles, lost and the number one doubles team of Stone and freshman Jane Price also lost. Everywhere else, the team dominated. At number two, senior captain Lolly Johnson cruised to a 6-1, 6-1 victory. Junior Debbie Podolin won 6-2, 6-2 at number three, and freshman Martha Johnson also won at number four. Price won easily 6-3, 6-4 at number five and freshman Alice Stubbs added another point with a 7-6, 6-2 victory. The numbers two and three doubles teams of L. Johnson/Stubbs and freshman Flora Robinson and junior Stephanie Townsend added the sixth and seventh points to close out the match.

On Sunday, after receiving news that they would not be allowed to participate in the Southern Conference tournament, the team took the court against Emory, a team that they had beaten 7-2 just over a week before. Stone won at number two 6-3, 6-1, Podolin, playing at number four, won 7-6, 7-5, and Price closed out the singles play with a 6-4, 4-6, 6-2 victory to make the score 3-3 going into doubles play. Davidson, however, could not pick up another point as they lost all three doubles matches giving Emory a 6-3 win. It was the first time Davidson had lost to Emory, and it marked only the second loss in Division III play in four years of competition for the Cats.

Tuesday, things continued to go badly for the team as they traveled to Furman. Davidson-Furman matches have been very close over the past few years, and Brown was expecting a 5-4 score one way or another. Instead, the team found itself on the wrong side of a 7-2 score. The only Davidson points came from Lolly Johnson at number three 7-5, 6-2 and from Price at number six 6-2, 6-1.

On Wednesday, Brown tried to shake up the line-up against UNCC by pulling out her numbers one, two, and four players. Lolly Johnson, playing number one, won easily 6-1, 6-3. Price, moved up to number three, won 6-3, 6-2, and Stubbs won at number four, 6-4, 6-2. Martha Johnson, junior Libby Sanders and freshman Angela Rudert at numbers two, five, and six lost to make the score 3-3 after singles play. Once again, the Cats could not pull out the match in the doubles winning only one point courtesy of Townsend and Robinson who won 6-1, 6-4 while playing what ups conference record to 4-1.

#### Davidson

By SUSAN WILKINS

After an important weekend of away conference matches, the Wildcats played two easy non-conference matches this week to raise their overall record to 19-7, just two victories shy of equaling last year’s record of 21-10. The Cats went into their three conference matches 1-1 and came out 4-1, beating East Tennessee State, Virginia Military Institute, and Western Carolina this past weekend. Coach Jeff Frank said that Davidson played extremely well, proving that although young, the Wildcats have the guts to win.

In the first match (all were played at VMI) Davidson was up against ETSU. ETSU is an extremely good team and should get a high seed in the conference tournament. Davidson played superb tennis to win 6-3. All the singles matches, except at the number five seed, went into three sets, proving the two teams were evenly matched. Davidson junior Michael Meyer was the only singles player to win in straight sets over his opponent. Frank says that Meyer is playing close to the top of his game, and beginning to overpower his opponents. Also playing well in singles were junior Hayes Dallas and senior Craig Hall. According to Frank, Dallas won a great match, playing smart tennis to beat an opponent whose strength was unbelievable. Hall, coming back from a shoulder injury, started slowly, but managed to work his way back into the match to win.

The Wildcats next played Western Carolina, winning easily 9-0. Meyer once again played well, demolishing his opponent 6-0, 6-0. Number one sophomore Jim Thompson, coming off a three-set loss, won easily 6-4, 6-1. Other winners were freshman Sebastian Koch at the number six position, 6-2, 6-0.Dallas at the number two position, 6-1, 6-0; sophomore Bill Young at number three, 6-3, 6-1; Hall at number four, 6-2, 6-2. Davidson also swept its doubles matches. After playing WCU at 9 a.m., Davidson had to play VMI at 2 p.m. The Cats came back strong to win again 9-0. This match, although not close, was closer than the WCU match. Young gave the Wildcats their only singles scare, dropping the first set 3-6 before coming back to blow by his opponent 6-1, 6-2 in the next two sets. Thompson won 6-4, 6-1; Dallas won 6-0, 6-0; Hall won 6-1, 6-1; Meyer won 6-2, 6-0; and Koch won his singles match 6-2, 6-0. In doubles, the Cats have been improving and it showed against VMI. The number one team of Dallas and Young dragged out their first set, so as not to humiliate their opponents, and lost it 5-7. They settled down to business in the next two sets, winning 6-0, 6-1. The other doubles teams had no pity on the VMI Keydets; Thompson and Caldwell at number two won 6-3, 6-3, while Hall and Meyer at number three won 6-1, 6-3.

This past Monday, the Wildcats were at home against Pfeiffer, not a very strong team. Frank took this opportunity to let some reserve players for Davidson get in some playing time. Caldwell played at number six singles, moving Meyer and Koch up to numbers four and five respectively. In doubles, Thompson and Caldwell played at the number one position, while Young and Meyer teamed at number two. Koch and sophomore Carlos Ortega, who usually do not play doubles, came in at the number three spot.

Sophomore Bill Young hits a forehand. As expected, everyone won; most fairly easily. Thompson won his first set 6-2, but dropped the second 4-6. He then toughened up and won quickly in the third set 6-2. Dallas won 6-3, 6-1, playing lots of short points to win. Young, a very consistent player, won 6-4, 6-1. Meyer, playing at number four, devastated his opponent 6-0, 6-0, playing power tennis and enjoying it. Koch, at number five, went up quickly in the first set 4-1, before dropping two games. He corrected some minor problems in his groundstrokes and bounced back to win 6-3, 6-1. Caldwell, a magnificent doubles player, played magnificent singles to win 6-0, 6-2. In doubles, Caldwell and Thompson won a scary first set and then an easy second to win at number one 7-6, 6-1. Young and Meyer won 6-1, 6-3 and Koch teamed with Ortega to win 6-2, 6-2.

Davidson traveled to Belmont Abbey on Tuesday for another easy match. The Cats' only loss came at number one singles—a tough position against any team. Thompson played well, but lost 4-6, 6-2, 2-6. Frank went with the same line-up against Belmont Abbey that he did against Pfeiffer, and everyone else won. The final match score was 8-1.

Davidson has a tough match coming up against Furman, the number one seed in the conference. Frank hopes to do well, but says that if the Cats cannot win he hopes for each individual match to be close, giving Davidson added confidence going into the Southern Conference tournament. In the tournament, Davidson expects to do well. Young and Meyer both have undefeated records in conference matches and should be seeded high. Young is the defending champion at the number three position. Frank says that Davidson has traditionally done better in the tournament than during the season, so if this season is any indicator, the Wildcats should play superbly. If not this year, then next. Next year the conference's strong teams will have lost a lot of players, while Davidson will only lose Hall. Davidson also is recruiting the top two players in South Carolina, and with sophomore Rick Hodge and freshman Blake O'Brien back after injury and illness kept them out this year, the Cats look to be strong contenders next year for the conference title.

Davidson travels to Furman this Friday, returning home Monday to play Johnson C. Smith in their last home match. The match starts at 2 p.m.
