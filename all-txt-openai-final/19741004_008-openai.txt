#### The Davidsonian

Anyone escaping from the pursuit of knowledge long enough to wander around campus after 4 p.m. may have noticed a
lone figure strolling about... the guardian of Davidson security, "Cop" Ray Sherrill.

Cop Sherrill has been associated with Davidson for four years, becoming a very familiar face, if not an institution. He
began his career with the college in the year of the infamous 4th East Gang. ("I sure miss those ol'
buggers," he chuckled.)

Cop Sherrill seems always to be around—streaks, water fights—but finding him when looking for him is another matter. After finally
tracking him down on a rainy afternoon, we escaped into his dry office for a chat.

Over cokes and crackers, we settled down to business, Cop Sherrill lamenting inflation—"Crackers gone up to 15 cents! Just can't
believe it!"

Perched on a stool, Cop Sherrill talked of his family of four children, three grandchildren ("and another on the way"),
and his home in the country—"just about six acres—we grow oodles of stuff." According to Cop Sherrill, several Davidson men
are "real farmers."

"I'll tell you one lesson it took Davidson to teach me, and that's that you can hypnotize a chicken!" he
confided.

It seems that DuBose Porter, one of the "real farmers" of Davidson, demonstrated the technique of hypnotizing a chicken on
a recent visit to the Sherrills.

Although Cop Sherrill wasn't too sure just what this feat involved, he was very impressed and swore that it was
"a fact!"

DuBose the Hypnotist is only one of the students Cop Sherrill has claimed as a friend over the years. One
of the reasons he values his job at Davidson (in addition to its glamour and excitement) is the chance it
gives him to talk to students. And he will talk, if given an opportunity.

An open, friendly man, Cop Sherrill is very proud of his connection with the college, and of being able to
"walk amongst the green grass and y'all—it means more than any money."

He considers most Davidson professors "down to earth people," and remarked that at Davidson, "everybody's the same—only way to tell
money is to watch what people drive, and that's the truth."

Cop Sherrill scratched his chin and mused, "the girls been a help—calmed the boys down some—but a lot of them
(the boys) won't admit it, you know."

An old Davidson yarn Cop Sherrill had to offer goes as follows... a few years back, he noticed a shiny
red Rolls Royce convertible parked outside Chambers. Curious, Cop Sherrill waited for its owner.

In talking to the owner, he discovered the old gent had been a Davidson student a few decades ago. While
at school, he had kept a car hidden in an elderly widow's garage in town, paying her a weekly rent.

He used this contraband car for occasional trips to Charlotte and other wicked cities considered unsuitable for young Davidson gentlemen.
One particular weekend, the luckless car owner got plastered and failed to pay his garage rent. The widow immediately went
to the Dean, and the poor fellow was campused for eight weeks, along with numerous other nasty reprimands.

Cop Sherrill thoughtfully remarked that this same hell-raiser went on to drive a red Rolls Royce convertible. Concerning current politics,
Cop Sherrill remarked: "just don't think President Ford should've pardoned Mr. Nixon—the other folks up there got families, too, you
know."

Cop Sherrill was warned against Nixon many years ago by an elderly lady friend. "She said she shook his (Nixon's)
hand once, and he had that 'gangster look' in his eyes! Thought about what she said a lot since then..."

He follows Davidson sports, with the exception of rugby—"just can't understand that game!"

Cop Sherrill values his memories of Davidson—old friends who have graduated over the years, asking Dean Rusk about his dish-washing
days at Davidson, ("...he said he guessed he'd washed 'bout as many dishes as anybody ever did..."), talking with Senator
Sam Ervin, ("I've met 'um all!"), selling prospective freshmen on Davidson.

Old yarns, fresh home-grown tomatoes, invitations to a possum hunt, conversation and company—Cop Sherrill offers them all.

And although Davidson may not offer Cop Sherrill too much crime to combat, it does offer him the opportunity to
do the thing he does so well—intermingling with the college community, being a familiar part of the face of Davidson.

"—except at my detective manual."
