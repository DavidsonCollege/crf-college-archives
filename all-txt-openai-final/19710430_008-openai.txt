Fagg Announces 15 Signees

Davidson football coach Dave Fagg has announced 15 additional future grid players, upping the number of signees for next year
to 46.

Fagg said he has been very pleased with the recruiting this year and has made an effort to fill in
what he felt to be the weaknesses of past squads.

Two more quarterback prospects have entered the fold, Pat Bennett, 6-0, 175, from Warsaw, Ind., and Al Kiene, 5-11, 180,
Valley City, Ohio, joined the three already signed.

Three halfbacks have been added in the last weeks, adding Al Nazzaro, 6-0, 190, Chuck Gladu, 6-0, 175, Roanoke, and
Scott Buell, 5-9, 185, Sunberry, Ohio, to the four previously announced.

Positions on the interior line have often been weaknesses for the Davidson team, but Fagg was pleased with the material
for next year.

Four linemen that will play for Davidson next year are Jeff Diller, 6-2, 200, Lancaster, Pa., Larry Newlin, 6-0, 185,
Greensboro, Jim Kleinfelder, 6-1, 200, Hamilton, Ohio, and Bill Smith, 6-5, 220, from Nashville, Tenn.

Fagg was particularly pleased with Smith, citing him as an exceptionally bright student. Smith will be one of the biggest
men on the Davidson team.

The list of recent signees also includes two linebackers, Dave Cancilla, 5-11, 200, Canonsburg, Penn., and David McWilliams, 5-11, 175,
Knoxville, Tenn.

Bob Shaw, 6-1, 210, Mt. Airy, Md., and Gary Applewhite, 6-0, 190, Greensboro, will join the team as defensive ends.
Shaw was shot put champion in Maryland this year.

Two split ends have also been added, Dave Sharenko, 6-1, 180, McKees Rock, and Jim Schoonover, 5-10, 160, East Stroudsburg,
Pa.

Fagg said that he was still waiting to hear from two prospects that he “wants very much.”

Cats Remain Favorites In SC

By CHARLES TERRELL
Sports Writer

The Davidson tennis team remains a heavy favorite to successfully defend its Southern Conference title in the tournament which began
yesterday at the Davidson courts.

For the seventh year since 1954 the ‘Cats are hosting the event. Davidson owns seven championships, and four of these
have been won on the home courts.

The Wildcats carry a 17-5 worksheet into the three-day affair. Other schools competing are Furman (9-10), William and Mary (8-11),
East Carolina (7-9), The Citadel (5-9), Richmond (3-11), and VMI (2-9).

Coach Harry Fogleman, who is serving as tournament manager, acknowledged that his squad “should be considered as the favorites.”

In final tune-ups for the tournament, the netters blanked Appalachian 8-0 on Tuesday and smothered East Carolina 8-1 on Wednesday.

Furman and The Citadel are expected to provide the biggest threats to dethrone the ‘Cats.

“Anyone on their teams could give us trouble,” indicated Fogleman.

He cited Dave Ellison of the Paladins as a key player to watch. Ellison placed second in the first court
singles play last year.

Four of the top six Wildcat netters garnered titles last year, but only one player will be defending his crown.
David Weaver captured the second court singles championship a year ago and will be in that position again.

Each of the first six ‘Cats earned top seeding in his respective court.

Bob Koury is seeking to become the first number one singles champion from Davidson since George Berner in 1968.

Jeff Dumansky fills the third spot for Davidson, and he took fourth court laurels last year.

Reigning fifth court winner Jim Cantrell moves up a notch to compete for the number four honors.

Rounding out the lineup for the ‘Cats are Hy Lankenau at fifth court and captain Jeff Chetwood in the sixth
court.

Singles play today begins at 10 a.m., followed by doubles action at 2 p.m.

Tomorrow the singles finals begin at 10 a.m. with the doubles starting at noon.

Skippers Place Last In SAISA

The Davidson sailing team was soundly defeated in the South Atlantic Intercollegiate Sailing Association finals last weekend at Hartwell Lake
in Clemson, S.C.

The skippers had placed first once and second twice in the three regattas preceding the finals.

A combination of “bad weather conditions, unfamiliarity with the ‘420's’ used in the class A division, and a mediocre performance,”
according to Commodore Allen Lundy, netted the ‘Cats seventh place in the competition.

The Wildcats were skippered by Jim Hunter and Bob Haggard. In the B division, racing “Penguins,” Hunter captured second place.

However, the A division was raced in ‘420’s,’ a type of boat never before used by Davidson teams, and here
the ‘Cats finished very poorly.

Lundy, Mark Leonard, Jim Hunter, and Daryl Douglas left last night for Boston and Tufts University for a regatta being
held tomorrow and Sunday.
