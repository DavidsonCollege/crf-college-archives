The DAVIDSONIAN Vol. IV.

Another Victory Won By Davidson Eleven
Furman Defeated at Greenville by a Large Score.

The Varsity had a rather easy time with Furman University at Greenville Saturday and piled up nearly as big a score as last year against the much-touted South Carolinians. The Furman squad made things look pretty bad during the first half, but in the last two periods, the Red and Black machine ran true to form and it was only a question of how big a score the Varsity would pile up. Davidson's defense proved a little weak during the first part of the game, but from the time the referee’s whistle blew to start the second half until the game was over, the line held and charged their heavier opponents off their feet, and the backfield tore off gain after gain.

WALKER, HALF-BACK

Davidson registered her first touchdown soon after the game started. Off-tackle plays and line bucks brought the ball within striking distance and Keesler on a fake ran 20 yards for a touchdown. Furman rallied momentarily, however, and on receiving the kick-off marched down the field to Davidson’s 10-yard line. Speer, who was one of the mainstays for Furman, then completed a long forward pass to Woods for Furman's first score. For the remainder of the first half, the honors were about even, and each team added another touchdown. Davidson missed the goal and made the count 14 to 13 in favor of the Greenvilleites.

In the third quarter, Davidson came back strong and literally played rings around Furman for the remainder of the game, adding four touchdowns in the third period and one in the last. After the second quarter, Furman never threatened to score. “Sam” Keesler and “Buck” Burns (Continued on page 6)

JUNIOR-SENIOR GAME

In a game featured by its roughness, the Juniors defeated the Seniors Wednesday night by a score of 22 to 17. Both sides played very poor basketball during the first half. The formidable offense formerly displayed by the Seniors was lacking, and they let several good opportunities to score pass, although they managed to hold the big end of a 10 to 8 score at the end of the first period. The Juniors took the offensive at the beginning of the second half and literally played the fourth-year men off their feet. Hawkins played very good ball for the Juniors, with a record of seven field goals and two fouls. Sprunt also played a good game. Murray played the best game for the Seniors.

JUNIORS (22) POSITION SENIORS (17)
Sprunt .......... Price right guard
Hawkins ........ Young center
Therrel ........ Keesler right guard
Mountcastle .... Murray left guard

Substitutions—Juniors: Douglas for Therrel, Therrel for Douglas. Seniors: Trail for Keesler. Referee: King.

JUNIOR-FRESH

Last Friday night in one of the best-played games of the series, the Juniors defeated the Fresh by the score of 21 to 19. The game was exciting in all stages and it was only in the last few minutes of the game that the Juniors were able to score. Hawkins was the outstanding star; it was his effective shooting that won the game for the Juniors. McClerkin, for Fresh, played unusually well. The line-up was as follows:

JUNIORS FRESH
Mountcastle .... Hall right guard
Therrell ....... Chalmers left guard
Finley ......... Worth center
Hawkins ....... Brinkley right forward
Sprunt ......... McClerkin left forward

Time 40 minutes. Referee: J. W. McAlister.

SENIOR-SOPH

On last Monday night, the Sophs defeated the Seniors in a very close and exciting game by the score of 23 to 16. At the end of the first half, the Seniors were in the lead 5 to 4, but in the second half, the Sophs fought hard and by their good passing and goal shooting were enabled to win. Captain Murray and Young starred for the Seniors, while Captain Hall and Andrews, for the Sophs, were in the game at all times. Hall scored 13 of the points made by his team, and Andrews put up a good game at guard. (Continued on page 6)

Great Game Promised In Winston Saturday
Special Train to Carry Student Body---Other Features.

On account of the Davidson-Carolina game in Winston-Salem next Saturday, the Southern Railway has arranged to run a special train from Charlotte to Winston, via Davidson. The train will leave Charlotte at 8:20 Saturday morning, arriving at Davidson at 9:29, and on the return trip will leave Winston at 10 p.m. A special round trip rate of $1.50 will be offered from Davidson, and $2.00 from Charlotte. This rate will be good only on this special train. The game will be called at 2:30, and general admission will be one dollar, but students securing tickets on the Hill will be admitted for 50 cents. Further announcement will be made later as to time and place for securing these tickets.

The Davidson alumni in Winston have arranged for a Davidson supper to be given at the Zinzendorf Hotel, to which all Davidson men are invited. A good supper will be served for 50 cents a plate, and only Davidson men will be admitted. Other special trains and rates to Winston are being planned, and an immense crowd will be in attendance at this game, which is the most important to be played in North Carolina this fall. Both teams have had an excellent season and the State championship will be decided as a result of this game.

The student body of Salem College will attend the game in a body. In view of the low rate offered, the holiday, the importance of the game, and other features, it is hoped that every man at Davidson will make an effort to attend the game and give the Red and Black machine his most hearty support. Whatever the result, the game will be a good, hard-fought battle, and the enthusiasm should at all times be running high. Carolina's team is heavier than Davidson's, and they have a very strong aggregation in every way. The Davidson eleven, however, has made an excellent record so far, and with all the men in first-class condition, and with the good coaching received all season, they can be counted upon to make a good showing.

Mr. A.L. Wilson, of Florida, father of A.L. Wilson, Jr., '20, was on the campus the latter part of the week, visiting his son.
