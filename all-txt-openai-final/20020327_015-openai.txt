After a strong week of practice and a renewed sense of focus, the Davidson College men’s tennis team improved their record to 8-7 with impressive 6-1 wins over both Marquette University and Wofford College. The team’s hard work was rewarded with strong play from all of the team’s players, which resulted in two well-fought victories for the Wildcats.

On a cold, windy Friday afternoon, the Wildcats rolled over Conference USA foe Marquette with a 6-1 victory in Knobloch Tennis Center, Davidson’s indoor facility. Using the fast courts to their advantage, the 'Cats jumped out early by winning the doubles point. The number two doubles duo of Chad Winebarger ’02 and Rob Gould ’02 pulled out a tight match with a 9-7 victory. Making his first appearance in the doubles line-up, Nick Lewis ’04 teamed up with Bryan Stonestreet ’04 to capture an 8-4 victory at number three doubles. At number one doubles, Rob Haywood ’04 and Donald Miles ’05 were unable to pull out the match, losing 8-4.

In singles action, the Wildcats captured five of the six singles matches. At number one singles, Winebarger dominated the match, winning 6-3, 6-1. Haywood defeated his opponent 6-3, 6-4 at number three singles. Wasting no time, Jonathan Britt ’04 disposed of his opponent 6-0, 6-1 at number four singles. After having to take a medical time-out to stop a bloody nose, Miles played strong, earning a 6-4, 6-2 victory at number five singles. At number six singles, Geoffrey Mullen ’03 earned an easy 6-3, 6-0 victory. The only loss of the day came at number two singles, where David Webb ’02 fell 6-3, 7-5, despite a closely contested match.

Head coach Jeff Frank and assistant coach Scott Briggs were thrilled with the team’s performance, especially in doubles. Coach Briggs noted, “[doubles] was the best the team has played up and down the line.”

On a sunny, cloudless Sunday afternoon, the Wildcats earned their second Southern Conference win with a decisive 6-1 victory over Wofford. Once again, the team played strong early, capturing the doubles point with victories at number two and three doubles. At number two doubles, Winebarger and Gould blanked their opponents 8-0, improving their overall doubles record to 9-6. At number three doubles, Mullen and Stonestreet won their match with relative ease, 8-4. Despite playing a well-fought match, the number one doubles combo of Haywood and Miles fell short, losing 9-7.

In singles action, the Wildcats again captured five of the six matches. Winebarger displayed strong play, winning 6-2, 6-4 at number one singles. After dropping the first set, Webb fought back and won the second and third sets, earning a 4-6, 7-6 (4), 6-4 victory. At number three singles, Haywood extended his winning streak to two victories with a quick 6-1, 6-1 win. Britt encountered very little resistance in his match, as he won 6-3, 6-0 at number four singles. At number five singles, Miles did not surrender a game, winning 6-0, 6-0. The only loss of the match came at number six singles, where Mullen was unable to pull out the third set, losing 7-6 (4), 4-6, 6-2.

Frank attributes these tough wins to a hard week of practice and to the team’s improved sense of focus. Said Frank, “Everything fell into place this week.” The Wildcats look to carry the momentum from this week’s victories into next week’s practice and matches. This weekend, the ’Cats will square off with 53rd nationally ranked East Tennessee State University and 46th nationally ranked University of Alabama-Birmingham.

Other first place finishers for Davidson were Drew Weber, who won the 100-meter high hurdles in 17.52, and the 4x400 relay team, which won easily with a time of 3:25.80. “There is nothing quite like running down the homestretch ahead of the pack,” said Schernecke, “bringing Davidson a victory in the 4x4, as you can feel the home crowd will you to the finish line.” The Wildcats will look to ride the rush from their home field advantage through next weekend, as they travel to North Carolina State University to run the highly competitive Raleigh Relays on Friday and Saturday.

Nationally ranked tennis drops two matches
By AMANDA MORDAVSKY
Staff WriterFor the first time in school history as a Division I program, the women’s tennis team received a national ranking of 68 in the country from the Omni Hotels Collegiate Tennis Rankings. Tied for the same spot are Brown, Long Island, and Winthrop, the last being Davidson’s latest foe. On March 22, Davidson faced this nemesis, only to emerge as losers in Winthrop’s 5-2 win. Losing only their second game of the year, the team struggled from the beginning, losing the doubles point to Winthrop. Winthrop’s Judit Trunkos and Renata Caceres sneaked by with a 9-7 win over freshmen Kelly and Meghan Fillnow. With a close 8-5 decision, Ana Simanca and Jenny Andrade defeated Davidson freshman Meggie Patterson and sophomore Katherine Hatch. In the final match-up, Winthrop’s Renata Barreto and Jacki Deason proved too strong for senior captain Kelly Cantrell and junior captain Yasamina Hilu, winning with an 8-3 decision.

In the singles match-ups, Kelly Fillnow sought revenge over Winthrop’s Trunkos, soundly defeating her, 6-3, 6-1. At the number two spot, Patterson pulled the Wildcats ahead with her own revenge over Simanca, 6-1, 6-1. However, that would be the end of the Wildcat points, as Winthrop swept the number 3-6 positions. Barreto defeated Meghan Fillnow, 6-4, 7-5, while Andrade snuck by Cantrell with a close 7-6(4), 7-6(5). This is the first singles loss of the season for Cantrell, a player who was recently ranked 131st in the nation. At the final two spots, Caceres came out with a 6-3, 6-0 decision over Hilu while Natasha Lucki snuck by Hatch, 6-4, 6-4.

The Wildcats returned to the courts on March 24 for their first conference match against Wofford. Despite several strong individual performances, the team could not pull out the win, as the Terriers took home the victory, 4-3. The Wildcats did rebound from their last doubles performance, sweeping the point. Fillnow and Fillnow combined for a strong 8-3 win over Wofford’s Wendy Rohr and Lauren Marie Whiesenhunt, while Patterson and Hatch shut out Delaine Hare and Meghan Turner. Rounding out the line-up, Cantrell and Hilu came away with an 8-1 win over Mary Wallace DeBerry and Kristine Banks. Cantrell commented, “Our doubles play was outstanding. We really dominated early and just kept putting them away. That could be the best our doubles teams have played all season.”

In singles, Rohr came away with a close win over Kelly Fillnow, 7-5, 1-6, 6-3, while Whisenhunt brought home a 7-5, 6-2 win over Patterson to give the Terriers the lead. Meghan Fillnow tied it up again with a 6-3, 6-4 win over Hare, while Cantrell gave the Wildcats the lead with a win over Turner, 6-0, 1-0 (retired due to injury). Cantrell improves to 12-1 on the season. However, the Terriers proved too much as they swept the last two spots. DeBerry defeated Hilu, 6-4, 6-3, while Banks shut out Hatch, 6-0, 6-0. Freshman Meghan Fillnow remarked on the loss, explaining, “We’ve been on such a high, especially after beating a national-ranked team, so this Wofford match was definitely a tough loss.” She continues, “But sometimes you need a loss to get you more pumped up and hungry for what lies ahead.” What lies ahead is a series of conference match-ups, beginning on March 26 against Western Carolina. The Wildcats' next home competition is on March 29 against East Tennessee State.

Relay team goes to nationals

Four of Davidson’s top swimmers traveled to Minneapolis, Minnesota, to compete in the Phillips 66 Spring Nationals. Senior Shelley Conroy, sophomore Jenny Hoekstra, and freshmen Melissa Marquez and Trisha Blackwell make up Davidson’s women’s 400-medley relay team.

In the national competition, the four Wildcats came in 26th overall, finishing the race in just over four minutes and 34 seconds. Even more impressive is the fact that each woman on the team swam her respective best time in the event. A first-year team member with two top-five school times already, Blackwell described the national competition as “an incredible experience—swimming with and against some of the biggest names in the sport was not only exciting, but also an honor.” Hoekstra agreed, “The meet was incredible. It’s still hard for me to believe that we have swimmers at that level. We were among Olympians, world record holders, and national champions.” Marquez, whose freshman campaign shattered two school records (100 and 200 breast), said, “It was just really rewarding to be competing with swimmers at that level. We had a pretty good race, we all swam better than we thought we would.” “Our relay did well,” said Conroy. “We placed 26th, which was higher than we were seeded, and we were proud to have been a part of it all.” Conroy, who recently set a new school record in the 100-meter fly, said the weekend was “lots of fun and fast swimming. As a senior, it was an awesome way to end my swimming career.”
