**Newcomers**

**Scott Brandon**
Scott is a freshman from Myrtle Beach, SC, and he’ll probably play small forward. He’s strong, versatile, and will make a contribution.

**Skip Brown**
It’s hard to classify senior Skip Brown as a returnee or a newcomer, since he’s both. He became disillusioned with and left the Biedenbach program, but he’s back and loves the new coach. The feeling is mutual. “He’ll be very important to our program. He’s got the world’s greatest attitude. He works hard and wants to make a positive contribution. He’s not going to be selfish,” Coach Hussey lauded. But there’s more. Although he’s not quite ready for the NBA, he is by far the most improved player on the court. He’s worked hard on his shot, and he now hits a mid-range jumper as consistently as anyone on the team. Plus, his defense and rebounding are better. Coach Hussey points out the secondary benefit, “Jamie will get a workout. Skip bangs on him.”

**Frank Johnson**
There’s good news and there’s bad news with Frank Johnson. First the bad — he’s ineligible to play this year. The good news is he’ll be eligible next year. Frank followed Coach Hussey in the transfer from Belmont Abbey, and by NCAA rules he must sit a year out. Davidson fans are missing quite a treat though: As Coach Hussey puts it, “Frank defies the law of gravity,” and with a 39-inch vertical leap he’s no stranger to the stratosphere. He’s a pure shooter, hitting all net or not going in at all, and plays good defense. He’ll work out with the team, but fans will just have to be patient.

**Gary McDonald**
Perhaps better known as “Stork,” senior Gary McDonald is a walk-on who should help the team a lot. He’s got good size and quickness and will provide added bench depth.

**James McLain**
James is another walk-on, and he has the potential to make or break the team. He’s a big, powerful football player, can jump, and could be the player to take it to the hoop for the Wildcats. James is still practicing football, so he hasn’t had any time to learn the offense, which could be a setback. But he wants to play, and Coach Hussey wants him to play.

**Howard Ringer**
Howard is a freshman point guard from Queens, New York, where he was “overlooked” by recruiters according to Coach Hussey. Hussey added, “He runs very well in the open court.” He’s a good shooter and good defensive player, but is still a tad erratic. He'll smooth over the wrinkles soon though and be ready to go.

**Trent Westmoreland**
Trent is a sophomore transfer from Brevard Junior College. He, too, gets up, and is a good rebounder. Coach Hussey describes him as a “slashing forward who can play guard.” That puts him at wing. Don’t expect Trent to dazzle you with finesse but expect him to be consistent and durable.

So there you have them. The 1981-82 no-name Davidson Wildcats. They are fifteen wild cards, and depending on how they’re played, they can make or break the season. As Kenny Wilson said in a poetic pitch, “This season can be great, or it can be disastrous. But if we get it right, as we think we might, we're gonna win every night, all right.”

**Tribus (21) are going up against each other here; but they'll be working with each other during the season to run up some big points.**
