PITCH PUCKETT, from page 18

Health tips and to encourage students to follow a more physically and mentally sound state of being. Mark’s condescending attitude has most likely sent more people running from the weight room than anything else.

I must say that I have now lost any respect that I may have had for Mark as a journalist. In Good Health has become a waste of space as even its author admits. I also deeply regret the fact that you are seriously considering Mark as your successor for next year’s position as editor. Please prevent us from further witnessing such a painful display of self-admiration. Get Mark Puckett out of the ring. And tell him to put his shirt back on.

Don’t like it? Don’t read it!

Dear Mr. Goodrum, Mr. Goodwin, Mr. Hagood, and Mr. Wood,

If you think reading my articles is a waste of your precious time, then don’t read them.

Sincerely,

Lucia Kendall
