### Pete ?-198

Our friend

— 1

The fragile and transient nature of life was tragically illustrated Monday evening when Pete the dog met his demise. Witnesses to the accident said that Pete was engaging in one of his favorite pastimes, chasing pickup trucks on North Main Street, when he apparently miscalculated his margin for error and was struck in a hit-and-run incident.

Many residents of North Main rushed to his aid, and he was immediately taken to the North Meck Animal Hospital. Unfortunately, his injuries were too severe to be treated, and he died from shock shortly thereafter.

Pete will be sorely missed on the Davidson Campus.

Likened in appearance to the Little Rascals dog, the RCA Victrola dog, and Trey Thies, he considered the whole campus his domain and property. He was of excellent disposition, willing to bestow affection upon anyone who would give him a kind word or a handout.

He was best known to those who live on North Main Street, particularly the residents of Julia Johnston House. He was given the run of the house, except by the guys that lived upstairs, who could never forget the night Pete made a slight error in judgment.

“If that damn dog ever craps on the floor up here again, I’ll kill him,” Roger or Spanky would be heard to threaten from time to time. But even they were happy to talk to him and give him a place on the couch when he wanted to watch TV or sack out for a while.

Pete had a remarkable knack for growing on people. Although one of the ugliest dogs on record, he was able to use his charm and winning smile to win many friends. He was filled with life and energy, possessing a great desire to romp and raise hell with his buddies, be they canine or human.

Although of undeterminable ancestry, Pete had the thick neck and bellicose nature of a Pit Bull. Unfortunately, this streak proved to be his undoing. He viewed other dogs and loud moving vehicles with great suspicion and hostility, saving particular venom for the likes of Diego, Devil Dog, and any beat-up pickup truck that was ever disowned by Detroit.

Pete’s death came as a shock to us all. Even so, it was somehow fitting. Pete was far too alive, too filled with excitement to enjoy facing the prospect of becoming old and feeble. If a Dog Heaven exists, he is surely there now, chasing all the trucks and harassing all the other dogs he could ever want.

Good-bye my friend. We’ll be seeing you in a few years.

### Boho Hits the End of the Road

Sorry I missed writing you last week. I was in Washington working on Reagan’s new inner-city housing project. It is built around a proposal suggested by William F. Buckley which uses imagination—our greatest (natural) resource for raw material. As you will recall, Buckley unveiled this fact here last week. The amazing thing about this imagination is that it is in unlimited supply, just like coal, oil, air, water, farmland, and all the other things that are necessary for high-production, high waste, high pollution, high centralization economy. What’s even better than that, imagination, unlike the things just mentioned, is just as good to eat, drink, and wear as it is for building. Needless to say, the poor are ecstatic.

I can’t give too many details because the CIA is afraid that the Soviets, or at least the Salvadorian guerrillas, will find out about this incredible stuff. They (power-hungry fiends that they are) would no doubt use this precious (though unlimited) commodity to produce non-nutritional foods, dangerous automobiles, or (shudder) innovative weapons of war. What’s more, they would probably use inane media propaganda to advertise it all!

How did Buckley find out about imagination? From science! Science, as we all know, has always come up with solutions to man’s problems, and always will.

There are those who say that science creates many of the problems that it then has to solve. But this just isn’t true. It just isn’t.

Yep, between science and imagination, we have the future pretty well sewn up. I’m not going to worry any more.

P.S. It’s taking all the imagination I can come up with to continue my efforts at graduating from Davidson. So Boho is writing himself out of your life (and mine). Thanks for your attention. It’s been fun. Love,  
John M. Hartman ’82, I hope.
