**The Cherry Picker**

Snug inside  
A tree fork,  
He slowly drew himself  
Up to work.  
Cherries hung waxy  
Red against  
White-worn overalls  
And seemed so  
Small against him.

Elizabeth Hill

**Road at Night**

Thousands and thousands,  
the darts of yellow pierce the night  
then fall into the darkness.  
Bright eyes of strange creatures fly past  
leaving a whir in the air to spin the dead, dry leaves.  
Ahead, red teeth show in the monstrous mouths  
calling me to follow  
into the dark, unseen,  
the unknown.  
Into the night  
on the long road home.

Guy Winker

**Shooting the aluminum ladder**

He brushed  
From his sun-  
Speckled hair  
Wisps of the  
Massive white web  
Spread over leaves  
To scare  
The hungry birds away,  
And reached.  
His long arms  
Far and wide  
To  
Every  
Side.  
Bringing in  
The cherriesâ€”  
Dropping them  
One  
By  
One  
Into a sawed-off  
Chlorox jug.  
Red fluid  
Trickled down  
His wrists  
And was caught  
By the denim shield  
On his breast.  
Bottle full,  
He stopped  
Long enough  
To buff a plump berry  
On his sleeve.  
Popping it  
Between eager  
Roof and tongue,  
He felt it burst  
And tingle  
As he descended  
To the shadows  
Of  
His  
Home.
