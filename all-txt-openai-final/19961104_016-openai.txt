GREENSBORO — The women’s basketball team won a program-high 14 games last year in a breakthrough performance that served as a wakeup call to the rest of the Southern Conference. The Wildcats also fulfilled their season-long rallying cry of "Nothing But Greensboro," winning their first-ever conference tourney game to advance to the league semifinals at the Greensboro Coliseum.

The trick for fifth-year coach John Filar and his promising squad this winter will be to maintain and build on that success. As Filar said at the Southern Conference Basketball Media Tip-off last week, “Now for a change, we’re going to be the hunted.” A return trip to Greensboro is no longer just an aspiration; it’s an expectation. This year’s motto: Snowball.

“We’re not taking any steps backwards and we’re not going to be satisfied with just getting to Greensboro,” said Filar. “The talent level is the deepest it’s ever been, and it’s probably the most versatile we’ve ever been.”

“The other teams in the league, we need to be a little bit scared of them (Davidson),” admitted Marshall coach Sarah Evan-Moore, whose Thundering Herd was ranked first in the league in the preseason coaches poll. “There’s nothing they don’t have,” said Appalachian St. coach Linda Robinson, who led the Mountaineers to a victory over Davidson in the semifinals last March on their way to the conference championship. “Plus, they have experience now.”

“This is probably the most excited the staff and I have ever been going into any season,” added Filar. And they have ample reason, as Davidson was recently rated the fifth most improved team in the country by NCAA News.

The Wildcats, picked third in both the coaches and media polls behind Marshall and App. St., return seven players who started at least four games last season and welcome a second straight nationally recognized recruiting class. This forms an unbelievably balanced squad.

Davidson will rely on its extraordinary depth to execute a run-and-gun transition game on both the offensive and defensive ends of the court. Pacing this up-tempo style of play will be senior co-captain Monica Winter from her familiar point guard slot. Veteran guard Carolyn Kirsch, a second team all-conference selection last season (12.6 ppg), returns for her final year among a corps of talented players. The team hopes its experience and versatility will push it to conference finals.ppg, 8.4 rpg), is “playing better than she’s ever played at Davidson,” according to Filar. Rounding out the senior corps is Amy Scalcucci, one of the Wildcats’ most accurate three-point shooters. 6-2 junior center Jennie Vanlerberghe will attempt to fill the shoes of graduated Kristen Ferrucci, the team’s second leading scorer (11.6) last year and one of the program’s first real stars. Danielle Mall, also a junior and co-captain with Winter, and classmate Jennifer Sanborn, a spirited guard with long-distance touch, look to play larger leadership roles.

The super sophs, who arrived on campus last year as the finest recruiting class in the history of the program, include forward Jessica Montrella (10.5 ppg, 8.4 rpg), a clutch shooter who can score from inside and outside, and twins Jamie (8.1 ppg, 5.1 rpg) and Kerry Brown (8.5 ppg, 3.9 rpg). Due to nagging stress fractures last year, the Browns were rarely in the lineup together. They both logged solid rookie campaigns, but have yet to strut their true stuff. “They are very talented players and bring a huge amount of versatility,” said Filar of his young and potent pair. “But their level of play rises when they’re on the court together. It’s that sixth sense.”

Walk-ons Nora Kizer and Carrie Sloan will provide minutes off the bench. This season’s first-year trio - Jen O’Brien, Meagan Gleason, and Katy Kamp - is as highly-touted as last year’s and appears talented enough to make an immediate impact. O’Brien, a 5-5 point guard, was the Connecticut Player of the Year last season and will more-than-capably spell Winter, who led the team in minutes played in ‘95-96. “She just has this coolness on the court,” explained Filar. “Jen O’Brien’s going to surprise a lot of people.” Gleason, a 5-5 pure shooter who can play at one- or two-guard, hit 91 threes last year as a senior at Douglas High in Juneau, Alaska, on her way to the state’s Player of the Year award. And Kamp, a 6-1 post player, was the leading scorer in Michigan last year and collected MVP accolades at the state all-star game. “She is one of the best we’ve ever recruited in the low post,” said Filar. “She is a force inside. We’ve set ourselves up for the next couple of years with the last three recruiting classes.”

With such a startling array of versatile talent and mind-boggling depth that reaches twelve notches down the bench, the outlook looks extremely positive and will only get more so in the not-so-distant future. “They were the stepchild their first two years in the conference,” said Georgia Southern coach Rusty Cram. “But there’s no question now. Those days are gone.” “You can’t look down the schedule and see Davidson and say win,” agreed Western Carolina coach Gary Peters. “You just can’t say that anymore.” “They have all that confidence coming off last year,” added Robinson. “Our players have tremendous respect for Davidson, for what they’ve accomplished, what they’re doing, and what they will do. There are several teams that could win the (conference) tournament come March, and Davidson figures to be right in the thick of it.”
