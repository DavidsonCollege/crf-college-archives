### The Athletic Master Plan
By BRUCE NEWSOME

Other teams would love to come to Davidson and play since they would be guaranteed that there would not be
a rainout. The Cats would thus be guaranteed a large number of home games where the home crowd could make
the difference. Only with this addition can the baseball team be able to get in the necessary number of games
necessary to qualify for the NCAA regional playoffs.

Secondly, the Knobloch Tennis Center needs to be expanded greatly. With the addition of 12 more indoor courts, the men’s
and women’s teams could play matches at the same time on the same day. This addition would also provide adequate
practice space. The enhanced practice space would allow the women’s team to prepare to the utmost of their ability for
their Spring Break trip to Hawaii. Also, the tennis team needs professional umpires for each of their matches. Against Old
Dominion, the Cats lost 5-4. In Blake O’Brien’s match, he hit a winning shot that would have given him the
match. However, the ODU player called it out when the ball was clearly in bounds. This blatant lie cost Davidson
the match.

A third building that is needed is an indoor driving range for the golf team. The team presently must drive
to the Charlotte Country Club to practice, but the bad weather has cut down on the practice time. With an
indoor driving range, the team could practice in bad weather and reduce their traveling time to and from Charlotte. The
golf team could also use a full-time coach. Coach Slagle is doing a good job, but his first priority should
be the soccer team.

The track also needs resurfacing. After the resurfacing is completed, an inflatable air bubble could be placed over the track
so that the runners could train whenever they want. We cannot have the track team catching cold and being unable
to perform up to their potential. Once all these additions are made, Davidson should have the facilities that it needs
for a top-flight athletic program in the middle of the North Carolina rain forest.

### Men’s Tennis Bounds into Stiff Competition This Week
The men’s tennis team is in the middle of its busiest week. The Wildcats will play nine matches in as
many days. The team (4-5) faces some of its stiffest competition during this stretch. The Wildcats have already played several
ACC opponents. They lost the season opener to North Carolina 8-1. They were shut out against seventh-ranked South Carolina, but
Coach Jeff Frank has not been disappointed in the performance.

“Our losses have been to ACC opponents and other very strong teams,” said Frank. “We're playing a lot of our
stronger opponents here at the beginning of the season. We’ve only lost to one team (Richmond) this year that we
beat last year.”

In addition to the tough schedule early in the season, Frank also cited inexperience and lack of court time as
factors in the team’s performance. “We have a lot of players in our lineup that have not had experience where
they are playing this year,” said Frank. “(Senior) Sebastian Koch, (junior) Tim Hagood, and (sophomore) See TENNIS, page 16

### Baseball Batting 1000 So Far This Soggy Season
By JOE HOOVER

After nine consecutive rain/snowouts, the Wildcat baseball team finally opened its season with a 7-2 victory over Wingate College last
Thursday (March 2). Junior Greg Wilcox pitched five innings for the win, striking out five Bulldogs while allowing only four
hits. Mikio Aoki and Steve Livesey led the Cats' attack with two hits and two RBIs each, while Mike Holland
chipped in a two-RBI double.

Davidson (1-0) opened the scoring in the bottom of the first as Holland drew a one-out walk. Caught off first
base by a good pick-off move by Wingate starter Darrick Embry, Holland threw to second base and was safe with...a
stolen base. Ralph Isernia followed with a single up the middle to drive in the run. Wingate (0-1) answered that
run with two of their own in the top of the second. David McDuffie led off with a single and
scored all the way from first on a throwing error on a ground ball hit by Jeff Henly. Henly raced
all the way to third on the play and scored on a ground out by Darin Sittel.

The Wildcats, however, scored five runs of their own in the bottom of the second after two were out, thanks
to an error by Embry. Mark Weir had a base hit with one out. Mike Liebdzinski, in his first collegiate
at-bat, reached first when Embry couldn’t field his bouncer back to the mound. After a fly out that would have
ended the inning, Davidson put together three hits and a walk to score. Holland’s double to center field drove in
Weir and Liebdzinski. After a walk to Isernia, Aoki followed with another double to score two more runs. Livesey drove
in Aoki with a single to right and then was caught stealing to end the inning.

Davidson scored their final run in the fourth as Isernia and Aoki walked to start the inning. Livesey came through
again with a single to left as Isernia scored his second run of the game. Jeff Loser, Derek Twombly, and
Jim Stanfill pitched the final four innings, holding Wingate to only one hit. The Wildcats were to face Radford University
on Friday, but the rains returned, postponing the Cats’ next five games. The Cats are scheduled to open a five-game
homestand on Wednesday (March 8, 2 pm) against NC State, with Wofford on Friday (2 pm) and Lafayette on Saturday
(12 pm) for a doubleheader and a single game on Sunday (12 pm). All games will be played at Wildcat
Park on campus. Hopefully, the sun will shine for a change and fans will come out to enjoy the good
weather cheering for the Cats.

Notes: The Wildcats started two freshmen (Azzolino, Liebdzinski). Both got their first collegiate hit... Freshman Tim Kerns singled in his
first collegiate at-bat... Ron Kmacik crashed into the left-center field fence trying to make a spectacular running catch. He was
shaken up on the play but remained in the game for two innings until being replaced by Danny Cotton in
the fifth. Kmacik is not expected to miss any games.

Club lacrosse loses opener
By BEN TREGOE

A solid thumping is always good to get your perspective back. Pfeiffer delivered the goods, fourteen of them, and we
were much obliged to accept them. Although Pfeiffer is a Division III team, the problem was not talent. The Davidson
team has plenty of skill and speed. The problem was in organization. We were a monastery of Vietnamese Buddhist monks
pouring gas on ourselves in the middle of Richardson field and throwing matches on each other. Davidson accumulated about fifteen
penalty minutes which did more to hurt the team than anything else. For each penalty, a player has to come
off the field for thirty or sixty seconds. Lacrosse is a high-scoring game, so giving a well-disciplined team a man
advantage is like giving them a goal.

Budweiser Players of the Game go to the managers, Kim White, Marlo Cobb, and Courtney Nichols. From keeping track of
the penalties to arguing with the referee, they were the only ones to keep their cool. Michael Malory and Boyd
Miller had the best games of the rest of the team. The offense tallied only three goals, with Robbie Huber
scoring one, and Dave Becker netting two. Ken Nazemetz receives the Hit of the Game award in his lacrosse premier.
At the final whistle, it was Pfeiffer 14 - Davidson 3. This Saturday at 2 p.m. come out and see
the much-improved Davidson team take on Elon.
