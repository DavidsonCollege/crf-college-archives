### LIVING
By ANDREW SCHAPIRO & VIRGINIA GREGORY
Restaurant Reviewers

El Paraiso is at best one of a series of restaurants that come and go on the Main Street void
between Davidson and Cornelius. The owners have barely curtained the space where Annie’s at the Lake once stood with a
veneer of Latin flavor, resulting in a dining experience that fails to satisfy the senses or the wallet. Its most
direct competition, Zapata’s Cantina in Cornelius, soars above El Paraiso in nearly every category.

El Paraiso’s decor instantly turned us off. Maroon napkins set atop Formica tables, black metal cafe chairs, and a green
and white tiled floor hardly satisfy the true American in us that longs for tin lanterns, cacti, and sombreros in
inexpensive Mexican restaurants. Artificial flowers in sconces on the walls combine with the emptiness of the restaurant to create an
eerie, morose feeling. Large windows and what looked to be outdoor light fixtures provided adequate lighting but hindered the interior’s
intimacy. That said, the restaurant was clean, and oversized booths could easily fit large groups of friends.

We only spotted two members of the staff upon our visit: one server and one chef. However, with only two
other customers in the restaurant, attentive service proved no issue. Our waitress, the owners’ daughter, was pleasant and conscientious, if
slightly rushed in taking our order. When asked for her suggestions regarding meat entrees, she quickly pointed out the most
expensive item; then again, she accommodated our special requests without error.

The stereotypical menu includes fajitas, burritos, and enchiladas as well as a few surprises like fried sea bass and the
daily specials. Tuna fish salad and a hamburger with fries on the lunch menu was slightly discouraging since we anticipated
what was advertised as “authentic Latin cuisine.” Latin turned out to be entirely Mexican to our discerning palates, which we
found to be El Paraiso’s true downfall. In an eight-mile stretch between Mooresville and Cornelius with Mexican restaurants ranging the
gamut, El Paraiso could best distinguish itself by offering dishes from various Latin and South American countries rather than run-of-the-mill
fare. Instead, its mediocre value and uninspired cuisine will have a hard time competing against the more established Zapata’s. Furthermore,
it does not have a liquor license. There is not a margarita in sight at El Paraiso, though they do
offer a selection of beers and a few wines as well as some non-alcoholic exotic drinks.

Our meal started out with the requisite chips and salsa, which we have typically found to be a good predictor
of the rest of the meal. The salsa was fresh and clearly homemade, but it was slightly watery and did
not have the customary bite that we expect from Mexican food. We ordered a supplement of guacamole, which proved to
be very fresh. The cilantro added a zesty flavor to the dip, but we were surprised by a lack of
tomatoes, which are customary in most guacamoles.

Even though it was recommended by our server, the Plato Azteca, a combination platter of grilled steak, a chicken tamal,
and a cheese enchilada, did not impress us. The steak, nestled on a bed of iceberg lettuce, was tough and
could have greatly benefited from seasoning. The tamal seemed undercooked, and the cornmeal surrounding the scant chicken was still very
mushy. Its accompaniments (rice, beans, and a salad composed of shredded iceberg lettuce, chopped tomatoes, and sour cream with no
dressing) were equally bland and disappointing. Our best solution was to wrap the various components in the flour tortillas provided
in hopes of creating a makeshift fajita.

The chicken chimichanga, which also came with beans and rice, was slightly better. Unlike some chimichangas, this one was not
overly greasy and had just the right proportion of crisp, fried tortilla to complement the pulled chicken found inside. Again
we found that the traces of mole sauce and cheese, which were supposed to be on top, did not provide
the necessary kick to make the dish memorable.

Menu items are...reasonably priced, but when compared with the quality and portions that Zapata’s offers at a discount for Davidson
students, they seem high. We left El Paraiso unsatisfied both with our food and the fact that yet another opportunity
for an eclectic dining experience in the area was wasted. Mai Cafe, the last restaurant we reviewed, was the antithesis
to El Paraiso in that its owners provide consistently tasty and interesting food at a good value. It easily distinguishes
itself from other Southeast Asian restaurants by offering a cuisine not before represented in the area. El Paraiso, on the
other hand, not only falls into a list replete with Mexican restaurants, but it has already fallen somewhere near the
bottom. We genuinely hope that as a young restaurant, El Paraiso will realize its faults and work to improve the
quality and variety of its offerings. A few cacti would not hurt either.

Unhung: Davidson’s Art Collection an Underutilized Teaching Tool in the VAC
By Darryl F. Ratcliff, Staff Writer

Davidson College has a permanent art collection of over 2,800 works of art. Most members of the college have seen
the VAC’s Rodin sculpture. Some have heard about the Romare Bearden collage. But few know that those two works are
just the tip of the iceberg. In the basement of the Visual Arts Center one can find works by Picasso,
Rembrandt, Matisse, de Kooning, Motherwell, Goya, Rauschenberg, Jackson, Dine, Hockney, Hesse, Sargent, and Noland. All of these drawings, paintings, or
prints, Davidson owns. Yet few Davidson students ever view them, because most of these masterful works of art remain in
a room full of drawers, unhung, unframed, collecting time and shadows, if not dust.

By 1953, Davidson had a permanent collection. It consisted of fewer than 10 works of art which, although small, were
very important. Then, in the 1970s, William H. Williamson Professor of Art Dr. Herb Jackson came to the college and
started the National Print and Drawing Show. This jump-started the permanent collection, bringing national recognition to Davidson’s growing art program.
However, most of the acquisitions were made during the 1980s as many collectors and corporations started to consider donating art
to Davidson.

Brad Thomas, curator of the permanent collection and gallery director of the William H. Van Every and Edward M. Smith
Galleries, says that during these years there was “a great deal of vision for the art collection and art gallery.”
Thomas describes the permanent collection as a “teaching collection” and stresses that it does get utilized. There is an “Art
in the Offices” program, where pieces from the collection are displayed in various staff offices around campus. Also, every three
to four years there are selections from the permanent collection in a gallery exhibition. In addition, there is the Herb
Jackson and Laura Grosch gallery endowment, which allows for special programming, publications, and acquisitions for the permanent collection. Finally, Davidson’s
permanent collection gains recognition by loaning out works to other museums. Works from the permanent collection have been loaned to
the National Gallery in Washington, D.C., the North Carolina Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York’s
Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the American Embassy in Caracas, Venezuela.

Thomas encourages students who want to see the permanent collection to contact him for a tour, calling the collection “an
incredible rich resource, like a library, and perhaps even that is underutilized.” Thomas and Jackson are hopeful that students will
start taking advantage of Davidson’s greatest untapped resource. Regardless, Jackson believes that the permanent collection is still a valuable attribute
of Davidson College. “It isn’t wasted because it is underused. Our job is to take care of it in a
careful manner and let the future of the college decide how to use the collection.”
