**Wildcat Basketball opens with a chance to knock off the #1 team in the nation!**

**Davidson Wildcats vs. Duke Blue Devils**

**Tuesday, Nov. 17 at 8:00 PM at the Charlotte Coliseum**

**The good news:** You will have awesome seats and be on national TV!!!

**The bad news:** You have to pay for the tickets (sorry, we have to rent the building).

We have had many calls and many questions. Here are the answers.

**Question:** When can I get my tickets?  
**Answer:** Tickets are available beginning at 8:30 a.m. Friday, October 23 at the Ticket Office at the Baker Sports Complex on a first-come, first-serve basis.

**Question:** Can I sit with my friends?  
**Answer:** Yes, but you must purchase them together or bring a group of student ID cards. One student can purchase as many tickets as he/she has ID cards at the student discount rate. Friends who are not students could buy adjoining seats for $10.

**Question:** Will our seats be any good?  
**Answer:** Yes. We have blocked the floor parquet sections for the Davidson family. There are 14,000 seats in the lower level of the Coliseum. Our block is comprised of the 1,500 seats closest to the court. The sideline parquet seats are just above the benches and press row and are the best seats in the house. There is a limited number of these seats, however, so those who come early will get the best locations. All seats are reserved seats.

**Question:** What will it cost me for a ticket?  
**Answer:** There is a choice for both students and faculty/staff. (See diagram below)  
**Students:** Pay discount price of $5 and sit at floor level under the basket (End Parquet sections 101 or 135) or pay regular price of $18 and be guaranteed mid-court sideline seats in the first 5 rows (Side Parquet).  
**Faculty/Staff:** Pay $10 and sit at floor level under the basket (End Parquet sections 117-119) or pay regular price of $18 and be guaranteed mid-court sideline seats in the first 5 rows (Side Parquet).

**Question:** Will you provide transportation to the Coliseum?  
**Answer:** If you drive yourself, parking will cost $4 per car at the Coliseum. If you are interested in riding a Wildcat Fan Bus, contact Aubrey Proud in the Marketing Office at ext. 2781.

**Question:** What about the Wake Forest game? Can I get tickets?  
**Answer:** Yes. For those who could get to Winston-Salem the night after Thanksgiving and want to see the ’Cats play the Demon Deacons, we have tickets available at $15. Check at the Ticket Office or call ext. 2375.

**Question:** Is the Appalachian State game on January 2 on TV?  
**Answer:** Yes, on ESPN2, but we need as many of you in the stands as possible. It is a huge game in the conference and we need your energy and support. Please, please, please try to get to campus that day to help the ’Cats and get on TV!
