**Gridders stung by incensed Rams**

Rams won the game 30-14 before a Davidson crowd.

Head Coach Ed Farrell, starting his fifth year at the helm, cited the Wildcat defense as one of the weakest
points in Saturday’s loss. After the game, he remarked, “As far as our defense is concerned, the whole coaching staff
is puzzled by our poor play. There were times when it seemed there was little emotion.” The 'Cats gave up
a total of 475 yards to Fordham.

Fordham got on the scoreboard first and led 14-0 with just minutes remaining in the first half.

Sophomore John Porter set up Davidson’s first score with a 51-yard punt return to the Ram 26, which fired up
the crowd. Page Walley scored the first Cat touchdown of the afternoon. Bass of Tampa, Florida, kicked the extra point
to put Davidson within a touchdown.

On the ensuing kick-off, an injury to quarterback Bob McCarthy made the entrance of back-up QB Al Rhyne necessary. Rhyne
responded with a 34-yard touchdown pass to Gifford Piercy. Bass came in and kicked another extra point to tie the
game at 14.

The 'Cats came back in the second half and moved the ball well until disaster struck in the form of
an interception deep in the Ram’s territory. They were at the one-yard line and were not able to score during
the second half. In the meantime, Fordham rambled for 16 more points to win 30-14.

After the game, Farrell commented on the offense by saying, “After looking at the films, offensively—for a first game—we did
not play badly. Our biggest concern is down near the goal line and not getting points.”

Davidson gained a total of 334 yards in the game. 237 of those yards came on the ground. Rhyne picked
up 99 yards with six completions out of 17 attempts. Two Wildcat passes were intercepted.

The loss of quarterback McCarthy and Cannon, a junior linebacker, for the year prompted Farrell to say, “The injury situation
makes the defeat even more severe.”

He added that the loss of McCarthy and Cannon “will certainly have some effect on our degree of performance.”

“What we need right now is some confidence,” Farrell said.

Next Saturday, the Wildcats will have a chance to win a game and gain that confidence as the team travels
to Lexington, Va., to meet Washington and Lee. Washington and Lee began their season by losing to Madison 49-7. Quarterback
Scott Swope completed 15 of 30 passes for 144 yards and a touchdown in that game.

Kick-off is at 1:30 p.m.
