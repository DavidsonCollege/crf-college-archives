¥ Aaron, you ignorant slat. How anyone with one iota of sense could support the left-wing, Tipper-marrying, gun-banning, internet-inventing, no-talent
hack Al Gore is beyond me. Let's do a little examination of my major running around the country with that
thing he mistook for a girl in a drunken stupor one night. And now here comes Gore running around like
a chicken with his head cut off, screaming about how he has all these proposals and issues with Al Gore.
First in the line-up? So, I guess, the stop-and-think exercise plans to fix America. Every time an issue arises, most
feel as if Gore raises his hand and says, "I've got the solution." It's exactly as if Gore were that
one moron who exists in every class here at Davidson. Picture it. It's 8:30 in the morning, you're recovering from
the Thursday night Depot romp, trying to resist the urge to pass out cold, and that one idiot has got
his hand up giving his unrequested and irrelevant opinion on something. You know the people I'm talking about, and if
you don't, then you ARE that guy. Ok, everyone knows what you're doing. Don't do it. Every professor and every
student here sees right through you. Whatever you thought was so insightful that you needed to share, probably isn't. I
know that it pains me greatly to hear you speak, and by doing so, you make the whole class stupider
for having listened to you.

But let me attempt to do her the same injustice that she does every day by appearing in public. The
only reason I can think of that Al Gore got hooked up with this girl is that he was drunk
one night at Harvard and went to some "social club" (or whatever those uppity folks call their fraternities) and got
cornered by this beast. Well, next thing he knew, it was morning, and he realized that he was in the
same room with what Anne Rice surely must have been thinking about when she wrote Queen of the Damned. At
Davidson, you would pretend it didn't happen, and you spend the next month hoping to GOD that the memory of
that dreaded evening didn't come back to you right after you've eaten a meal. But you know what? Lesson learned,
right? Well, Al Gore is still...

Why George W. Bush is a flat-out idiot - forces. Once again, the time of year has come when America
shows its brightest, truest, and ugliest colors. That time of year: election time. And the front-runner of the freak show:
George Dubya Bush. I mean, this guy is an idiot, and he forces our wonderful country to stoop to his
level of crying and moaning. Let's just investigate the vision of the utopian America Dubya would have us living in
if he were elected. First of all, we would all be brainwashed, close-minded, homogeneous conservatives. Those of us with money
and brains would keep our money and our brains, while we cut our own taxes, stole from the poor, and
implemented any type of education or social program that would ensure our offspring's position in society and our servants' position
in our kitchens. And don't worry, those of us with money and brains wouldn't be scrubbing our own toilets either.
Next, we would certainly find ourselves shackled by the religious conservatism that has marked little Georgie's campaign and has plagued
the Republican Party for years. I'm sure Mr. John Pitt '04, who found it so necessary to tell me why
his vision of a more lackluster Outpost would be beneficial to society, would be happy to support the repression of
any religious ideas that make us uncomfortable, just as Bush would suppress those ideas that are contrary to his own
religious view. In addition, just as Mr. Pitt would limit religious expression at the Outpost, so too would Bush limit
an American's choice on abortion. Whether or not it is acceptable, heinous, or unthinkable, the current pro-choice stance of the
government is the only option given the founding ideology of this great nation. America was created under the umbrella of
protection against tyranny, and protection to choose on a wide variety of subjects. We can choose what television station to
watch, what gasoline to buy, what candidate to vote for. But never are we...

Gore is a flat-out idiot - candidate lacks "logic filter." Gore has the same problem: no logic filter. Both Gore
and the comment-whores fail to actually assess whether their random thoughts are workable or not. And even if, by some
miracle of God, they stop and think about what they are going to say, they wouldn't know the difference between
a deep insight and their Cliff's Notes-esque mental flatulence. So, I guess, the stop-and-think exercise for them is pointless anyway.
Just be silent, Mr. Gore. The polls. Oh, sure, they all say that Gore and Bush are neck-and-neck. That's just
what the liberal trash media want you to think. Their polls are all misleading and based upon false information. Just
like that Princeton Review rating that says that Davidson students are number one for studying the hardest. Uh, huh. Right.
Sounds nice, doesn't it?Forced to take one course of action or another, and we never should be. Bush’s blatant ignorance
of the beauty of our Constitution and the very strands of freedom woven in its fabric is simply disgusting. America
was created under the umbrella of protection against tyranny, and protection to choose on a wide variety of subjects. We
can choose what television station to watch, what gasoline to buy, what candidate to vote for. But never are we
forced to take one course of action or another, and we never should be. Well, the truth of the matter
is that we are number one for having whiny students who THINK they work harder than anyone else does. And
on the flip side, “work harder?” Maybe people work harder here because Davidson students aren’t as smart as they like
to think they are and HAVE to work hard to keep up. Bet those polls aren’t looking so accurate now,
are they? I think I have clearly illustrated the true nature of Al Gore. Nothing would do our country more
injustice than to have Mr. Gore as our president. God have mercy on us all if that happens. Sho nuff.
Oh, and if I failed to offend you in this article, let me know and I’ll pick on you next
week. Scott Buchanan ‘01

Conformity caliber concealed weapon, ready to put a cap in the ass of anyone that might blink at the wrong
moment. Really though, the real issue here is one of intelligence. We can elect a conscious, experienced statesman in Al
Gore, or we can elect a sputtering drug user who slid his way through college on his father’s name. So
I charge you, the reader, with the moral and social responsibility of voting for a man who has the brains,
the drive, and the honor to be president. I urge you to vote for the candidate that, unlike many of
the class of ‘04, would stay up the hill until first night down and let the grown-ups play without being
hassled by the kiddies. Vote for Al Gore, feel good about yourself and the country, and pat a Bush’s blatant
ignorance of the beauty of our Constitution and the very strands of freedom woven in its fabric is simply disgusting.
