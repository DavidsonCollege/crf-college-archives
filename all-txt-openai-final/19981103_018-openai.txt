### The Men’s Schedule 1998-99 Wildcat Basketball

**Duke, UMass, Wake Boost Slate**

Fans of the men’s basketball team should be very excited about the rapidly approaching season. After last year’s amazing run
to the NCAA tournament, the Wildcats will again play a challenging non-conference schedule, perhaps the toughest of any Southern Conference
team. The docket features six tournament teams from last year as well as a road matchup with ACC power Wake
Forest, which participated in last year’s National Invitational Tournament. The Wildcats also have two games scheduled to be televised nationally
on ESPN2.

“This schedule is going to challenge us early,” coach Bob McKillop said. “It will require us to be ready earlier
in the season than we normally have to be, but this is the year to do that because we depend
so much on our juniors and seniors.”

The highlight of the schedule is the opener against Duke on Nov. 17 in the Charlotte Coliseum. Duke is picked
by many prognosticators to make the Final Four and win its third national championship this decade. The Blue Devils will
no doubt be a top-three team in the country when they take the floor to face the Wildcats two weeks
from tonight.

“It is a wonderful opportunity for us, and it immediately gives us national attention,” McKillop said.

From there, the Wildcats head to Annapolis, Md., to open the road season against Navy. The Midshipmen, last year’s Patriot
League champion, participated in the NCAA tournament before a first-round loss to North Carolina. The Wildcats then face Wake Forest
on the road the Saturday after Thanksgiving. Wake returns ACC freshman of the year, Robert O’Kelley, who hurt Davidson with
his deadly shooting in last year’s contest. The transfer of seven-footer Loren Woods to Arizona leaves the Demon Deacons with
11 of their 12 scholarship players as first- or second-year players.

The Wildcats have their home opener Nov. 30 at Belk Arena against Elon before traveling to Lincoln, Neb., for the
Ameritas Classic on the first weekend of December. McKillop’s bunch will face Colgate in the first round and, with a
win, host Nebraska in the four-team tourney finale. Davidson will return home Dec. 8 to face cross-town rival UNC Charlotte.
The Wildcats have lost two straight to the Mecklenburg rival 49ers, but look to change that this year.

In its last action before shifting focus to conference action, Davidson meets UMass for the third straight year — this
season’s clash coming Dec. 29 in Amherst, Mass. Athlon’s preseason magazine rates the UMass frontcourt, led by monster center Lari
Ketner, as one of the four toughest in the country.

The conference schedule begins with a bang Jan. 2, as the Wildcats square off with North Division arch-enemy Appalachian State.
Boone’s Mountaineers will be looking for revenge after dropping its only three league games last season to Davidson — including
a conference tourney title game loss in early March at the Greensboro Coliseum.

Highlighting the rest of the Southern schedule: League newcomer College of Charleston’s visit to Belk Jan. 30. Both the Cougars
and the Wildcats were NCAA tournament teams last year, as Charleston nabbed the Trans America Athletic Conference’s automatic bid. Most
prognosticators pick Charleston to once again go to the tournament. The Wildcats, however, should have something to say about that.

### The Men’s Leadership

By Tripp Cherry

Senior captains Ben Ebong, Ali Ton, and Chadd Holmes are poised to lead the men’s basketball team to another standout
season on the hardwood. All three were important leaders last year. Now it’s official, though, and their roles have changed
a bit.

“We have to be more vocal to replace the leadership of (1997-98 captains) Mark (Donnelly) and Billy (Armstrong),” said Holmes,
an important part of the Wildcat frontcourt, rated by many as the best in the Southern Conference.

Ton, a proven leader, has been the Wildcats’ starting point guard since his sophomore year. He led the conference —
and finished 14th in the nation — in assists, averaging 6.4 a game. The native of Turkey is currently coming
off a broken foot but should be ready to take the court when Davidson faces off against Duke on Nov.
17 at the Charlotte Coliseum.

Ebong, last year’s Southern Conference tourney MVP, averaged 9.4 points and 6.2 rebounds per game. He will be counted on
again this year for his scoring and rebounding, as well as for his leadership on and off the court. Ebong
emphasized the importance of being more of a leader off the court.

“It is now our responsibility as captains to be organizers off the court,” said Ebong, the league’s best sixth man
last season. “We have to make sure...”

**TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 1998**All the guys know when practices are and when meetings are. It is our responsibility to make
sure that they are always where they are supposed to be.” Holmes played in all 30 games last year, averaging
5.2 points and 3.1 rebounds per game. He should again be a key post player off the bench after having
provided a spark in a number of contests last season. His biggest game came in a key road win at
Appalachian State in which he scored 16 points on perfect shooting. “Ben and Ali are passionate competitors with talkative personalities,
and you can see the transfer of their personality down to the rest of the team,” coach Bob McKillop said.
“Chadd has also become much more assertive and defiant on the court this year.”

In addition to the three captains, fellow senior David Burns — who is currently nursing a back injury — brings
four years of experience to the team. Burns is a player that can score in bunches. On many occasions last
year, the senior from Winston-Salem gave the team necessary bench scoring. In the Southern Conference final against Appalachian, he hit
three three-pointers in a five-minute span to give the Wildcats an important lead going into halftime.

The Wildcats also have a strong junior class to count on. Landry Kosmalski, the 1996-1997 league freshman of the year,
has proven his leadership capabilities the past two years and should continue to help this year’s seniors lead the Wildcats.
The experience and leadership of Davidson’s seniors should have the Wildcats ready to make another exciting run at an NCAA
tournament berth. “Getting to the tournament last year was big,” Ton said. “But we’re not satisfied.”

THE MEN’S OUTLOOK

With four starters back, men shoot for return NCAA trip

Men’s Outlook from front page

Guards Ali Ton and Davor Halbauer and forwards Landry Kosmalski and Stephen Marshall are back, as is Ben Ebong, the
league’s top sixth man a year ago and the conference tournament MVP. Ebong should enter a starting role this season.
The Wildcats also return the entire frontcourt and will look to pound the ball consistently inside with a balanced offensive
attack. With scoring by committee, Ebong, Kosmalski, and Marshall all averaged over nine points a game in 1997-98. “You'll see
the ball consistently in the paint more,” McKillop said. “We have tremendous confidence in our interior game with Landry, Ben,
Stephen, and Chadd (Holmes).”

Holmes, one of three senior captains along with Ebong and Ton, will log significant minutes in the post. But as
with Marshall, he will not hesitate to move outside and drain the three. Also likely to make an impact: Martin
Ides, a 7-foot-2 freshman who brings tremendous size to the reserve rotation. And with added mass to his 6-7 frame,
anticipate seeing sharp-shooting David Burns possibly playing power forward off the bench. In addition, Emeka Erege returns after a season-ending
leg fracture. With regained confidence and proven athletic ability, Erege is healthy enough to take the court and play his
first full season.

The backcourt will have no problems passing the basketball inside to the big men. Ton returns this year 86 assists
shy of the career record held by Chris Alpert, who was a senior star when Ton was a rookie. Despite
preseason foot surgery, the Turk appears ready for the season opener against Duke Nov. 17 at the Charlotte Coliseum. “There
are players vital to your team,” McKillop said. “Ali is one for us. Ali is a leader in every sense
of the word.” With a semester of practice under his belt last spring, frosh Michael Bree will back up Ton
at the point. A deadly long-range threat, Halbauer must drive to the basket and supply a consistent perimeter shot to
help ward against defensive double teams on the Wildcat post players.

Jeff Bergmann and Brian Turner, athletic marksmen around the three-point arc, will provide a quick first step and energy off
the bench. With a 63-25 overall record over the past three seasons, including a spectacular 37-6 mark within conference play,
Davidson knows how to win. Such success leads to confidence — but in the case of these Wildcats, not overconfidence.
“Teams that have success fall in love with their success,” McKillop said, “But our players have not fallen in love
with our success and are looking for more.”

But one question remains. Can the 1998-99 edition of Davidson basketball repeat as Southern Conference champions like its 1969 and
1970 predecessors? Deep and experienced, McKillop’s corps look ready for another 20-win campaign, another trip to college hoops’ biggest party,
and a possible first-round victory.
