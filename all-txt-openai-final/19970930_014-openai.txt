Men’s soccer unable to overcome sluggish first half, loses

With loss to Spiders, Wildcats drop to 2-7 heading into UNCG clash

It was a tale of two halves Saturday night in Richmond. But ultimately the Wildcats couldn’t overcome a rugged first period as Richmond defeated Davidson 2-1.

“We dug ourselves a hole in the first half,” coach Charlie Slagle said. “But we came back and gave a good effort in the second half.”

The Spiders, who outshot the Wildcats 10-2 before the intermission, took a 1-0 lead on a spectacular shot by Keith Donahue that Davidson keeper Marshall Tyler deflected into the goal.

“It was a rude awakening,” said Tyler, who was making his collegiate debut. “He just cracked a shot from the 18 (18 yards away from the goal), thought I tipped it wide, but it deflected into the corner of the goal.”

Despite surrendering a second goal that gave the Spiders a 2-0 advantage, Davidson owned the second half, outshooting Richmond 10-5. With 10 minutes remaining in the game, Lawrence Cann headed in a Dan Guill free kick to cut the deficit to 2-1. The Wildcats would get no closer.

“Richmond put us on our heels in the first half, but we were able to make the adjustments in the second half,” Tyler said. “In the last 10 minutes we showed a lot of heart, and the way we played is something to build on.”

Tyler, who had been nursing a hamstring injury before Saturday’s contest, registered four saves in his first action of 1997.

“I thought I played well, but not well enough for us to win,” the junior said. “I feel like I’m getting better and better every time I step out on the field.”

With the defeat, the Wildcats’ record falls to 2-7.

“It’s tough to be 2-7 and be upbeat,” said Slagle, whose squad has been outscored 20-13 this season. “But we are staying in a positive frame of mind because we know we have been in virtually every game.”

Notes: With Marshall Tyler starting Saturday’s game against Richmond, it raises the question of who will start Wednesday against UNC Greensboro. “We'll just wait and see,” Slagle said. Brad Stroble had started Davidson’s first eight contests, a time Tyler was suffering a hamstring injury. “With two such talented goalies, it makes sense to use them both to your advantage if they’re both healthy,” Slagle said... Senior forward Phil Julien, the Wildcats’ second leading scorer in 1996, could return Wednesday against UNC Greensboro. Julien, nursing a leg injury, hasn’t seen action since he suffered the injury against The Citadel, a span of five games. “He’s close, but not quite ready,” coach Charlie Slagle said... Wes Roach, a junior forward, could return to practice this week. Roach has missed the entire 1997 season to this point with a back injury... the Wildcats will soon have some depth in the backfield. Juniors Dan Cook and Fred Ryser are both healthy and working themselves into playing shape.

Wildcats hone passing game

Forced to do so, squad displays potent aerial attack

EMORY, Va. — Emory and Henry’s huge defensive line — averaging an astounding 228 pounds — shut down the Wildcats’ rushing offense, so Davidson had to take to the air.

“We've always had passing capabilities,” quarterback Tommy Dugan said. “We just fell back on some secondary strengths today, because they did a good job on defense of stopping our run.”

Dugan went 20-for-33 passing for 358 yards, one touchdown, and three interceptions, falling only 50 yards short of Davidson’s school record of 405 yards, a standard set by Mark Thompson Oct. 10, 1970, against Bucknell.

And it wasn’t just one guy he was throwing to. The passes were distributed evenly between the receivers. Roland Williams had six receptions for 99 yards, Eric Sapp had four for 41, Corey Crawford had three for 71, Eric Ferguson had two for 50, Lorenzo Moll had two for 47, Wes Jones had two for 20, and Nate Hagerman had one for 27.

“We threw the ball pretty well,” Williams said. “They were shutting down the option like never before.”

“We went into the game knowing that if we had to we could throw the football,” coach Tim Landis said. “We have quality receivers, and we’ve been protecting our quarterback really well. Tommy’s been throwing it well. We just went into the game saying we are just going to take what they give us. They gave us the passing game, so that is what we had to execute, and I thought we did a good job with it.”

Opposites Attract

Saturday’s game was one of opposites between the two squads. Davidson had 358 yards passing to Emory & Henry’s 294 yards rushing. Davidson had 14 passing first downs to E & H’s 17 rushing first downs. Davidson went 1-of-8 onThird down conversions to E & H’s 10-of-13. Davidson had no sacks to the Wasps’ five takedowns for 33 yards... In other categories, though, the game was a little closer. Both teams ended up with 26 first downs at the end of the game, and Davidson averaged 6.9 yards per play to E & H’s 6.5... The win raised the Wasps’ home winning streak to 29, making their Fullerton Field the second-toughest place to play at in the country, behind only Nebraska... Emory & Henry is ranked No. 7 in Division III football... Davidson’s Jeremiah Parvin had 3 punts for 129 yards, averaging 43 yards a punt. His longest boot traveled 57 yards... There was only one field goal attempt in the game, by the Wasps' Matt Rhodes — and it was blocked and returned by Clif Henry for a Wildcat touchdown... The Wildcats held the ball for 25:14 to Emory & Henry’s 34:46... There were only two touchdown drives — both by Emory & Henry — that lasted longer than three minutes and had more than eight plays... Williams returned five kickoffs for 176 yards, including the score for 98... Bo Henderson made three tackles behind the Wasps’ line of scrimmage for a loss of seven yards.
