REPORTS ON STATE VOLUNTEER CONFERENCE TO BE PRESENTED AT NEXT “Y” MEETING.

The “Y” meeting next Sunday will feature a most attractive program. Price and Cunningham, who were among the delegates to
the State Student Volunteer Conference, will make a report to the student body. This report will be informal, and is
certain to be interesting, for this has been unquestionably the greatest conference that has ever been held in the State.
Then, too, these are men who can say what they have to say in a live, interesting way. The musical
part of the service will include songs by a quartet of the delegates: Price, '22; Beck, '23; Buchanan, '23; Ted
Jones, '24. Also, if possible, there will be some music by the girls visiting for Junior Speaking.

Miss Bonnie Shelton, who has been teaching at Woodleaf, N. C., spent the weekend at home.

TAYLOR LARGELY TO MUSIC

In spite of the fact that “Tim” Pharr, '12, was unable to be present for the “Y” meeting on Sunday
evening, an excellent service was held. The time was given up largely to music, after a short Scripture reading by
Lewis Schenck. Appropriate solos were given by Allison and Ralph Freeman, and a number of songs were sung by the
students as a whole. The Y. M. C. A. was very much disappointed that Mr. Pharr was unable to be
on hand, and it is hoped that other arrangements can be made with him for the near future. A very
interesting program is being planned for next Sunday, and it is desired that all the fellows be present, together with
as many visitors as possible.

exceptional talent possessed by these young ladies.

Agnes Ayres, as the wife of a man who will not support her, finds it necessary to work for a
rich family, the Mallorys. A young oil magnate, Rogers, whom Mr. Mallory hoped to ally with his own interests, is
persuaded to stay for a dinner party given by Mrs. Mallory. Complications arise when Mr. Rogers’ dinner partner cannot be
present, and it is necessary to ask Mary to take her place. She was perfumed by Coty, gowned by Poiret,
and bejeweled by Tiffany to such an extent that Mr. Rogers falls in love with her. Dreams must end, though,
and Mary returns to the drudgery of a home and maltreatment by her husband. Disgusted with him, she accepts Mrs.
Mallory’s offer of a weekend house party at which Mr. Rogers is the principal guest. While there, her husband, coming
to rob the house, finds her, and she has to disclose her identity to Rogers. She tells him she loves
him but because of her husband cannot marry him. Again, she returns home to a husband who tries to “bleed”
Rogers by demanding ten thousand dollars from him. Rogers brings the money, and Mary tells him to choose—Money or Mary.
He chooses the money, but for trying to double-cross his accomplice, he is shot by him. Mary finds herself free
and in the glorious springtime surrenders to the arms of Love.
