WITH OTHER COLLEGES

University of Virginia—For three successive years the Rhodes Scholarship for Virginia has been won by a member of the University
of Virginia football team. It was won this year by George W. Anderson, a member of the class of 1916
in the academic department, and for the past two years a tackle on the football eleven. He is president of
his class. The enrollment at Virginia now totals 1,033, the largest in the history of the University.

V.M.I.—The board of visitors of the Virginia Military Institute recently gave the following summarized report as to the death of
Cadet Sweet, who by some was supposed to have met his death by hazing: "That the death of Cadet Thurber
Sweet from myelitis was in no way induced by any hazing or injury of any kind received by him while
at the Institute, or from any cadet or person connected therewith." The incident has caused a more rigid enforcement of
the rules in regard to hazing.

Winthrop—The board of trustees of Winthrop have decided to ask the Legislature of South Carolina to provide a new dormitory
in order to accommodate the large number of young women of the State who now desire to matriculate at Winthrop.
A new dormitory, accommodating 250 or 300 students, would make it possible for the enrollment to reach 1,200.

DAVIDSON VITAL STATISTICS REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1915

Total number of deaths, 14. Pneumonia, 2; Pellagra, 3; Apoplexy, 2; Cancer, 1; Pyelitis, 1; Septicaemia, 1; Malnutrition, 1 (one
month old); Dead at birth, 3. Total, 14. Births during the year, 31. For 1914: Deaths, 23; Births, 50. A
most interesting feature of the 1915 report, apart from the wonderful reduction from 23 to 14 deaths, is that between
the ages of one month and 27 years, there was no mortality, and no deaths from diseases that might be
considered as preventable by community action.
