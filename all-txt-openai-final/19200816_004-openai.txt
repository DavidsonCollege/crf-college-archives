4 THE DAVIDSONIAN, AUGUST 18, 1920.

TO THE NEW MEN ENTERING COLLEGE.

We have at Davidson a club called the Greater Davidson Club. Its motto is “A Bigger and a Better Davidson.”
Every student in college is a member of the club and the day you enter Davidson you will automatically become
a member yourself. As its motto implies, the club has two aims: First, to make Davidson bigger as to numbers,
equipment, etc.; second, to make it better, particularly with reference to student life, activities, and relations. The club has already
accomplished a number of good things and for the coming year has plans on foot to improve student life even
further.

For a number of years, there has been practically no hazing at Davidson, as the student government regulations absolutely forbid
organized hazing, but occasionally there was some act of an upper-classman toward a new man that seemed to the Freshmen
to be an act of hazing. Last spring the student body, acting under the suggestion of the Greater Davidson Club,
decided to abolish hazing in appearance as well as in fact. Accordingly, they re-enacted the anti-hazing clause of the student
government regulations, declaring that any student found guilty of hazing would be expelled from college instantly. The Sophomore class, as
a body, passed a resolution endorsing the student body action, and expressing their full support of it. Several mild student
distinctions for new men such as were in effect last session, and to which there was no objection, remain, but
no form of hazing will be permitted.

I am giving this information to the new men that they may know in advance something of the spirit and
attitude of Davidson students toward new men. You will be given a cordial welcome and be treated in a most
friendly manner. I want to ask, however, that you, on your part, meet this friendly spirit in the right way
yourself. It is good for a new man coming to any strange place, to hold himself somewhat in reserve, and
to wait for recognition. No matter how prominent and successful a leader you may have been in your high school,
do not try to run things when you first enter college. Keep yourself somewhat in the background in college affairs,
and let your manner be that of a man who is sure he is among friends, but does not assume
authority or privileges. Be a learner and a listener. If you have merit and ability to lead, you will be
recognized in due time and the honors and popularity that come to you will be all the more firmly established.

Bear these suggestions in mind, and from the beginning of your college career be a loyal member of the Greater
Davidson Club and try to do your part toward making student relations happy and pleasant. The students of Davidson believe
that their college is already the best to be found, but they want to make it even better. The Greater
Davidson Club invites you to take part in this splendid work.

J. M. McCONNELL,
Faculty Representative
Greater Davidson Club.

DAVIDSON CLUB FOR THE SUMMER.
(Too late for last issue)

First: To represent the Davidson spirit and ideals in the community and town where we spend our vacation.
Second: To bring with us when we return to college next year a new student, or, if we do not
return, to send a new student in our place.
Third: To visit and explain to any prospective student in our town or community all we can about the college
when requested to do so by the President’s office.
Fourth: To see to it that at least 450 students enroll at Davidson next September.Dormitory space prevents our making the
number 500. The officers and leaders of The Greater Davidson Club were very much gratified at the action taken by
the next year’s Sophomore Class resolving that every member of the class will do his utmost to enforce the student
body regulations forbidding hazing at Davidson College. This means that hazing has been abolished by the students of the college.

Though Greek has been for several years past elective at Davidson, it continues to be none the less an essential
element in the makeup of a complete and rounded education in the judgment not simply of Greek professors but of
thousands of college-trained men who occupy the vantage ground of wide and long experience and observation in the educational, literary,
and scientific world and who insist that no matter what is to be his profession later in life, the boy
entering college makes a great mistake if he does not study Greek for certainly one, not to say, two years.
A few of the reasons given for this opinion may be briefly stated:

(1) Nothing is superior to Greek as furnishing a mental gymnastic, the heresy of the new psychology to the contrary.
(2) Greek makes such a large contribution to the English language that no man can have a proper appreciation of
a large fraction of words in his own English tongue that does not know something about Greek. Scientific nomenclature is
practically all Greek.
(3) Greek thought in philosophy and in literature is the very basis and foundation upon which the moderns have built
their own, indeed the Greek may be termed the very warp and woof of mental science and literature as studied
today, and to know the modern it is all-important that the student first learn the Greek.
(4) As a corollary of this, it may be added that the “continuity of learning” makes imperative an acquaintance with
this the greatest of the ancient languages.
(5) A knowledge of Greek is the sine qua non of admission into that great and almost uncounted brotherhood of
educated men, a fraternity whose history runs far back into the centuries. Greek is the open sesame, in fact the
only passport by which one can enter this society of the select and highly favored among mankind.

ABSENCE REGULATIONS.
1. Absence from any college duty will be unexcused unless the Dean or College Physician gives permission beforehand.
2. Chapel as well as Church absence will be counted hereafter as equivalent to recitation absences. A total of only
six unexcused absences will be allowed without discipline therefor.
3. For each unexcused absence from any class and for each excused absence above three during the first term or
five during the second term from any class, the grade of the student in that class shall be lowered by
one. The excused absence allowed without penalty shall be increased to ten where at least five during the first term
or seven during the second term are due to the protracted illness of the student, certified to by the College
Physician, or to absence as a member of a college organization representing the college away from town.
4. No so-called “blanket requests” by parents for permission to be absent will be honored. Specific written requests must be
made for each permission.

THE GREATER DAVIDSON CLUB WORKS.
By mid-summer the number of new students definitely lined up had reached 150. If registration had not been checked by
letter and by advertisement we no doubt would have gone well beyond 300 new men. Again we say the Greater
Davidson Club works.

Bad News From Pat.
“Good morning, Miss. I’ve just had very bad news about my son Pat. He has been killed in action.”
“Oh, I'm very sorry,” said the Red Cross Home Service worker, “did you receive word from the War Department?”
“No, miss, I received word from himself.”
The Home Service worker looked perplexed and said, “But how is that?”
“Sure,” replied the mother, “here is the letter. Read it for yourself.”
The letter said, “Dear mother, I am now in the Holy Land.”—Ex.
