Sterling is more than optimistic for his soccer players; he is ambitious. Practice begins officially on Monday, but the players have been working out on their own during the past week, running scrimmages and getting into shape. Sterling, assistant coach for the Wildcats, has been observing the informal practices and is elated with the team’s performance and attitudes.

“All these players are practicing purely on their own,” he said, “and the team looks better than any I've seen.” 

“These players are much more aggressive than ever before.” Sterling predicts that this team will score more and be harder to stop than last year's Southern Conference champs. “We've got more than forty players trying out, and they're all in shape and ready to play,” he said.

Several outstanding freshmen have come out for the team. Sterling expressed particular interest in Tom Tornee, a lineman, and Joe Duncan, a half. Both are considered prospective starters. Don Bain, formerly an all-state goalie from Georgia, has been moved to fullback and is a possible starter. The team presently has four goalies. Three exchange students are trying out for the team, and Sterling expressed particular interest in K. Seraphin Bari from the Ivory Coast. “He is an exceptionally fine player,” he said, “as good a wing as I've seen.”

### Harriers Depend On Freshmen
**By JIM HANNA**

Davidson cross-country coach Sterling Martin played the part rather well. The part was that of a coach whose team had a 1-14 won-lost record last year and whose hopes for the upcoming season depend mainly on a group of freshmen.

“I’m approaching the season with guarded optimism,” said Martin. But just a little too much excitement showed through Martin’s comments, spoiling the act. “The group of freshmen we have this year are potentially the best that Davidson has had in several years,” he said.

A cross-country coach can rarely afford to get excited about freshmen, because freshmen must adjust from a two or three-mile race in high school to the much more strenuous five- or six-mile college event, and this usually cuts down on their team effectiveness. Martin, however, expects the problem to be the reverse. “With this group of freshmen, the upperclassmen are going to be hard-pressed to stay ahead,” he said. In fact, Martin expects the top four runners on this season's squad to be freshmen.

Recently released statistics show that over the last five years Davidson’s record as a passing team is rated fourth best among major colleges.

Bobby Koury, last year’s number one singles champ in the Southern Conference, has transferred to Wake Forest from Davidson. He must wait for a year before he is eligible for ACC play.

The Wildkittens will open their season on October 2, meeting Evans College in Kannapolis.The number one position on the team is Ricky Bell, who was the state mile champion of the Virginia Prep League and was undefeated in two years of cross-country competition at Woodbury Forest. Bell, who has a 4:23 mile and 1:59 half-mile to his credit, is "a real fighter," according to Martin. Hot on Bell's heels will be Rick Mullen, Ricky Deal, and Chip Schleider. Mullen, from Roanoke, Va., holds two course records at his high school and is the top challenger for the first position. Deal has recorded an impressive 28:50 for 5.5 miles. This time is close to the record for the Davidson course, which is only five miles long. Schleider, says Martin, "could be number one if he decided to really work at it." This bevy of talented underclassmen will produce a real dogfight for the remaining spots on the team. 

Senior Howard Boyd, last year’s number one runner and team captain this year, is expected to get the number five position. Returning lettermen Joe Shibley, Ron Clark, David Reed, and Don Butts will battle for the remaining slots, along with sophomores Pete Kyle and George Edwards, and freshman Bob Lautensack. But the four top freshmen and Boyd will, Martin hopes, "provide a team nucleus—which is what we need," and push the Wildcats to a fourth-place finish in the Southern Conference. Martin’s harriers finished last in the conference last year, due to "a really tough schedule."

"I hope that these freshmen will be able to run with the leaders," said Martin. "If they can, then we can compete with VMI, The Citadel, and Furman, and with luck we can get fourth." With luck and four able freshmen, you can hardly blame Martin for getting excited, even if he won’t admit it.

Steve Culbertson has returned to the team after their Junior Year Abroad. Culbertson has returned to his inside position. Culbertson was the high scorer in his sophomore year. "It's hard to replace a player like Gudmunder Karlsson," Sterling commented, "but overall we are as sharp as before and more aggressive than last year’s team."

The soccer schedule has been shortened by three games, due to a substantial cut in the soccer budget. Last year the team members circulated a petition and gathered more than 600 signatures from students and faculty protesting the cut. This leaves the kickers with an 11-game schedule, well below the number of games most college teams schedule, according to Sterling. During the season they will face some strong competition, including Duke, N.C. State, and Belmont-Abbey and St. Andrews Presbyterian, two schools that do not field football teams and specialize in soccer during the fall.

Sterling also expects to reform the soccer club after its success last spring. "We will need some sort of program to absorb the players we have to cut," he said. The club has been approached by several local teams and high school teams for fall games. Sterling said a great aid to the team’s practice would be the use of a practice field and two practice goals. The portable goals were purchased recently and allow more practice time for the large number of prospective players.
