DAVIDSONIAN WINS ALL-AMERICAN RATING

Davidsonian Wins All-American Rating

elected were: Duke University, president; Frances Wimberly of Flora Macdonald College, second vice president; Earle Bostick of the Woman's College
of the University of North Carolina, secretary; Gibbs Gibbs of Lenoir Rhyne, treasurer.

The Davidsonian was also awarded the prize in class B paper publications by the North Carolina Collegiate Press Association, Class
B being the class of all weekly papers in colleges with an enrollment of less than 1,000 students.

Carter McEver of Davidson. They were the supervisors to the Davidsonian, and the editors of the three literary publications of
Davidson were elected members of the publications board by the student body last week. The new board is composed of

At the conclusion of the induction ceremonies, a banquet was held in the banquet hall of Chambers with Mr. F.

elsewhere were present. The speaker of the evening was Dr. Oren Moore, president of the Alumni Association. Dr. Moore is
a prominent Charlotte physician and loyal Davidson supporter.

Dr. Hemphill’s engagement at Davidson was for one year only, and the trustees are looking for a professor who majored
in European History. Dr. Lingle, in commenting on Dr. Hemphill’s departure, said: “Dr. Hemphill completed his graduate work at the
University of Virginia in American History and took his doctor’s degree there, so the authorities are thoroughly acquainted with him
and the character of work that he does. During his year at Davidson, Dr. Hemphill has maintained high educational standards
in his department.”
