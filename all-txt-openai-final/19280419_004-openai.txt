that if things be allowed to take their apparent course, and no literary society treatment be applied, this difficulty will
in time be done away with. Some of the honorary fraternities on this campus are, without a doubt, of service,
and a great deal at that, to the student body. But others—many others—are, from the standpoint of service or aid
to the students or to their members, practically worthless. Such fraternities meet once, twice, or—to be generous with them—four times
a year. The business of such meetings consists very largely in calling on some higher-math “stude” to figure out how
large a dividend they may declare on the fees from the recent—or future—initiations, which dividend is to be used for
the purpose of a grand old feed at the “speak-easy.” This terminated, a few congratulations given, and the cares and
business of the meetings are over for another year.

Collegiate Comment + Minor Chords

Among the many different and varying discussions of college politics at this time, the attack which has centered about Alabama’s
Tammany Hall, popularly known as Theta Nu Epsilon, has drawn quite a bit of attention. It seems that certain students
there rebelled at the thought of having such an organization in their midst as they grew tired of its continued
control of college elections.

Another news article common to collegiate publications just now is that the annual War Department inspection has been completed and
that “the best performance of past years was given by the cadets.” If every college showed improvement, it means that
Davidson’s place at the top of the Fourth Corps Area is a little doubtful.

From the Centenary Conglomerate, it is learned that an “Unusual Chapel Talk is Delivered.” Hope is abandoned, though, when the
rest of the copy shows the issue to be a yellow sheet on pink paper.

In an attempt to imitate the popular confessional magazines of the day, the Austin College Kangaroo publishes some “Revelations about
a Co-Ed Dormitory.” In beginning the story, the author says that she has been found guilty by the Girls’ Council
of being the biggest liar on the campus. She undertakes to protect her title in the account.

Wake Forest’s “Al Smith Club” and Georgia’s demonstration in behalf of the New York governor make the local excitement created
by the straw vote seem mild. Probably the greatest height which was reached was expressed in a few shouts between
dormitories on the eve of the voting.

All football men who received letters will not be permitted to participate in basketball, according to a new ruling which
will soon be adopted by the University of Vermont. This is the second institution in the country to adopt this
ruling, Tulane University being the first.

As a result of promiscuous kissing at a sorority initiation, 60 members of the Clionian sorority at New York State
Normal School were placed under quarantine for scarlet fever. One of the members was afflicted with the disease, and since
she had kissed every person present at the initiation, all were placed under quarantine.

They are wondering at the University of Wisconsin whether girls get higher marks than the men students because they linger
after class and flirt with the instructor or just why it is. The teachers deny this, but the fact was
recently disclosed that one instructor wrote at the end of a girl’s theme, “I should like to give you better
grades because you have such an exquisite soul—so do study.”

Co-education is just being introduced in the Chinese universities. Women students, however, are not allowed to mix with their brothers,
but are allotted seats on the opposite side of the room, heavily chaperoned.

“Crip” courses are soon to be a regular part of the Columbia University curriculum, according to Dean Herbert E. Hawkes,
who declares that there are many students who gain more from just sitting in on an interesting, but easy course
than they would from intensive work in the course.

College students in 408 colleges and universities, who are working their way through, earned $55,000,000 last year. Of the entire
enrollment in these institutions, thirty-nine percent are partially or wholly self-supporting. One-third of the students in men’s colleges and one-sixth
of the students in women’s colleges are earning all or part of their expenses.

The Western Association of College Comics recently voted to break their contracts which give College Humor sole reprint rights, says
The New Student. They state that the publication “is painting a picture of flaming youth which is not real, and
which gives to the average reader a false idea of college life. They take all the gin and sex jokes
and play them up as representative college humor, with no mention of any other type.”

Only 29 of the 159 girls in South Hall at the University of Missouri would marry Colonel Lindbergh, if they
had the chance. Eleven of the 29 were ready to marry the airman without hesitation; fifteen wanted to “date him”
first, and three felt that “it wouldn’t be bad at all” to stand beside so famous a man. These straw
votes certainly want to find out about the private opinions of people. They certainly do.

In keeping with the Antioch plan of extending student control step by step as it becomes possible, a student committee
to pass on probations and expulsions seems likely. The plan is for these members to investigate each case and join
with a faculty committee to decide on action.

While students at the University of Washington are conducting an organized drive to abolish compulsory military drill, a student petition
for an R.O.T.C. unit at Denver University is being presented. There is quite a bit of opposition at Denver, however.

INTELLIGENTSIA

There is a clique in every college
Who deem the entire realm of knowledge
Their own, a patented invention
Beyond their fellows’ comprehension;
And clothe themselves in full accordance,
With lofty airs of self-importance.
Their views are strictly modernistic,
And very nearly anarchistic:
They speak of art with learned mien,
Lauding some futuristic scene
Which, to the unenlightened eye,
Seems sadly, hopelessly awry,
With tangled nose and brow and leg
Resembling most a scrambled egg;
But if you venture one contention
They eye you with sad condescension,
And pityingly murmur, too,
Of your Victorian point of view.
If literature’s the conversation
They will expound with animation
How Mencken now is quite the class,
And Browning just a silly ass;
“Why Shakespeare, sir, is quite passé,
You know, he isn’t read today.”
Then (pardon, I’d not dare deride)
They form loud plans for suicide,
To see what lies beyond the tide;
But something seems to override
Their earnest effort to be free,
Unfortunate that death should be
Elusive, and so hard to find
For the resolved, heroic mind!
“Religion is a hopeless bore,
A relic from the days of yore
When girls wore modest clothes for style,
And thought morality worthwhile.
God is an idea quite absurd
A fetish of the common herd.”
They point out Christian dogmatism
To prove the truth of atheism,
And sneering Paul clear out of face
They set up Lewis in his place.
(Lewis, whose favorite tone’s a bray
Makes fitting god for such as they)
Idiots all! Their doings show it;
But they discernment lack to know it,
And cover up their want of sense
By naming it INTELLIGENCE.
Great God, Who us poor herd still rules,
Why did You make that bunch of fools?

F. H.

He—“I’m going to buy myself a harem.”
It—“What do you mean? You can’t buy a harem, can you?”
He—“Sure. I saw a sign at a gas station that said ‘Eight Gals for a Dollar.’”—U. of S. Calif. Wampus.

“Have you seen any of the new sirens the police are using?”
“Yes, one of them accosted me the other day.”—Stanford Chaparral.

Because a majority of the fraternities of Center College do not want restrictions or rules concerning pledging or rushing, and
the others feel that without such rules a Pan-Hellenic Association would be of little value, they refuse to create such
an organization.

The editor of the Clemson College paper is becoming riled over the compulsory church attendance and attacks the authorities with
reference to their attitude toward it. It seems that the list of expelled editors will be swelled before long.

Emory reports an excellent time had by all at the various “receptions” held during their Little Commencement. Now we can
understand the slight typographical change in Byron’s “Childe Harold.” The Emory edition now reads “On with the reception! Let joy
be sunconfined!”

It won’t be long now before the Democrats will have implicated in the Teapot Dome controversy every Republican candidate for
the presidency. Senator Reed seems to be going strong. His most recent suggestion is that friend Cal be thrown out
of the White House.
