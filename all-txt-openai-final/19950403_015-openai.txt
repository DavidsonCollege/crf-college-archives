THE DAVIDSONIAN SPORTS MONDAY, APRIL 3, 1995 15

IN THE SPOTLIGHT — AGAIN

Big Game from page 1

Davidson hosts the game. “Despite being favorably compared with Atlanta, we’re not planning at this time to bid for the 2004 Olympics,” he joked. (Atlanta will host the 1996 Summer Olympics.)

The game comes directly on the heels of the NCAA Soccer Championships, which ended a three-year run here in December. Last fall, Davidson hosted the “Game of the Week,” a 10-game package featuring the best college teams in the country. Last spring, Davidson played host to the men’s World Cup team for its tune-up against Moldavia.

Students will have an opportunity to purchase tickets for the game on Friday, one day before they go on sale to the general public. At $8, the tickets will be available to students, faculty, and staff on a first-come, first-served basis that day. Those tickets are for seats located next to the premium seats which will go for $15. But, if students jump early, they should be able to get some very good seats.

No additional seating will be added for the game, leaving capacity at Richardson Field at about 5,300. The women’s team has been drawing between 1,500 and 2,200 fans in games earlier this year in small markets and drew 10,000 for a game in Dallas. Sargent said he hopes, and expects, to draw about 4,000 fans. He said he expects the student tickets to go quickly beginning Friday morning.

As an added bonus, that weekend in April is also Alumni Weekend, giving the many alumni who return one last event before they leave Sunday.

Sargent jump-started the process to host the game about three months ago by calling the USSF to see if the organization was interested. He called about one month ago to remind them of the idea, but considered the chances remote that a game would be played here. Then, Thursday morning at about 7:15 a.m., the events director of the USSF called Sargent and told him the USSF was interested in playing a game at Davidson. The deal was then finalized at about 1 p.m. Friday.

Davidson does not receive any revenue from the game beyond a rental fee, but gets a bundle of exposure, especially in the soccer world. The USSF, as the NCAA did for the final four, will likely hire many people at Davidson to run the event.

“We were fortunate to have done the other things because that gave us national recognition,” Sargent said. “Hosting the U.S. exhibition against Moldavia helped us to get to know the people at the USSF. ... We’ve worked with all of them before. They know that our system works.”

“It’s kind of surprising how it all happened,” he added. “Nobody thought we would get the college championships the first time, but since then, one thing has built on another. For most people, one month isn’t enough time to get everything ready, but we’ve developed an infrastructure, and our people have experience.”

Unlike the men’s team when it played here before about 4,000 fans, the women’s team that shows up will be the same as the one that goes to Sweden. The men’s...Team, on the other hand, featured only some of the players that eventually made the final roster. Some of the top players include Mia Hamm, Tisha Venturini, Michelle Akers-Stahl, and Kristine Lilly, all of whom played at North Carolina, which has absolutely dominated women’s collegiate soccer for the last 10 years. The women’s team won the World Championships, the women’s equivalent to the World Cup, for the first time four years ago by rolling over its competition in China, outscoring its opponents 25-5. The championship marked the first time that any U.S. soccer team has won a world title. Akers-Stahl scored 10 goals in the 1991 tournament. That team was coached by Anson Dorrance, also the Tar Heels coach. At one time, half of the national team’s roster was made up of then-current or former North Carolina players. Now, Tony DiCicco heads the team, but Tar Heels still dominate, comprising seven of the team’s 18 players. The U.S. will compete in Group C in the World Championships, along with China, Australia, and Denmark. The tournament runs in much the same fashion as the World Cup, with teams advancing after round-robin play to the single-elimination rounds. So far this spring, the women’s team is 3-1-1. The Scandinavian women’s soccer teams have traditionally been recognized as the world’s best, and Finland is no exception. The U.S. team, however, is strong once again, and, as it boasts some of the top soccer players in the world, is expected to contend for the world title again.
