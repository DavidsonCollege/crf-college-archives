Men's tennis wins ninth in a row

By Will Cobb

With Davidson and East Tennessee State locked at 3-3 in match play, freshman Dan Parham stood on court five with
his opponent in the deciding third set. The stage was set and both players knew that the outcome of their
match would determine the winner. Up 4-1, Parham went to work, playing almost flawless tennis to put away his opponent
6-1 for the victory and the Wildcats’ ninth consecutive victory.

Just minutes before Parham’s victory, senior Russell Briggs pulled off one of his biggest victories this season, coming back in
both sets for a 7-6, 6-4 triumph. The win gives the Wildcats (15-5, 6-1) a chance to win the Southern
Conference regular season championship this Friday at Furman.

The win was huge because ETSU had defeated Georgia Southern, the last team to beat Davidson, handily. “We did it
the hard way this afternoon,” said head coach Jeff Frank.

Davidson got the other two victories at the #3 and #4 positions. Chris Parker had a tough first set, but
finished off his opponent, winning the final seven games for a 7-5, 6-0 victory.

Junior Dan Grinnan, playing with a 101-degree temperature, came back from a 1-4 deficit, winning 11 of the final 13
games, to win in straight sets 6-4, 6-2.

“We got down early and came back strong. This win was very important, because that team has a win over
one of our losses. I couldn’t be happier with the way we played,” said Frank.

Davidson played Saturday morning against Belmont Abbey in a match that featured seniors exclusively. They won handily 6-1, with the
only loss coming as a result of a default after two sets.

The Wildcats will face Barton at home on Thursday at 2:00 p.m. before traveling to Furman on Friday to face
the Paladins for the regular season title.

The team will then take a week off before hosting the Southern Conference Championships over the weekend of April 22-24.

Men's lacrosse loses to UNC Greensboro

By Carl de Brux

Last Wednesday night the men’s club lacrosse team played UNCG under the lights behind Baker Sports Complex. The Wildcats lost
10-6 to UNCG, making it the second time the club has lost to the Spartans this year. Davidson fell behind
early in the match and was never able to even the score.

The Spartans' strength and ability to strike quickly kept the Wildcats off balance through all four quarters. Despite adversity, the
Cats kept within two goals for most of the game.

Entering the fourth period down 7-5, Davidson looked to draw closer, but the Spartans’ size and depth soon wore the
tired Wildcats down, holding on for the 10-6 victory.

Newcomer freshman Matt Rich played a stellar game, and Dave Farrar, Jeff Scherer, and Will Chung came up with the
goals for the Wildcats. Now Davidson will travel this Thursday to Chapel Hill to face the tough North Carolina Tarheels.

year in a row. Next year, the competition travels to Chattanooga as part of a Spring Sports festival, but Price
hopes it will return after that.

“The conference championship should be special,” she said. “The facilities should be top-rank. And we certainly have some of the
best facilities in the conference.”

Hosting the tournament could present the type of distraction Price was worried about earlier in the season, but, instead, she
says it should be an emotional boost for the team.

“It helps us tremendously,” Price said. “The students get into it, the community gets into it. It serves as the
home crowd does in other sports. We can feed off it.”

Based on the tough teams Davidson has faced this season, including Georgia Tech, whom the Wildcats beat, and the experience
of seniors Jennifer Beahm, Hess, Tash Ruth, and Barbara Grooms, the women should be prepared to execute at a high
enough level to seriously compete with top-seed Furman.

Quips and Cranks is now taking applications for the 1994-95 position of Editor in Chief.

All interested students should sign up in the Dean of Students office by Friday, April 15.
