**Public Accommodations: Profs Clash In Debate**

**Polley Supports Title 2**

**Hallmans Martin Attacks Section: On Moral, Legal Bases Would ‘Usurp Liberty’**

I believe the Congress has before it a good Civil Rights Bill which is a significant step toward securing first-class citizenship for the American Negro. There has been considerable debate over the bill’s Title II, which deals with public accommodation. I would support this portion of the bill on both moral and constitutional grounds.

**A REAL HEAD**

Believing that everyone is created in the image of God, it is my conviction that it is morally wrong to discriminate against any person on the ground of race. I do not deny that every man has a personal right to choose whom he wishes to associate with, but when this personal preference is made the custom of the area, whether it be done by legal means or by social pressure, it automatically limits the freedom of both Negroes and whites to associate with whomever they choose. The other day it was necessary for me to schedule an interracial dinner meeting. The difficulty I had finding a restaurant which would serve us was a limitation upon my freedom. I can only imagine how it must feel to a Negro who finds himself each day excluded from facilities open to white members of our society. To me, this is treating the Negro as less than a human being.

I also believe that the federal government has the right to impose a law against discrimination in places of public accommodation. I am sure there are sincere people who honestly oppose this bill because they regard it as a violation of property rights. To me, the issue is between property rights and human rights, and I unashamedly choose the cause of human rights. It seems to me that the federal government has the right to intervene in local situations where human rights are being denied. There would, of course, be no need for such intervention if the local authorities preserved the rights of all citizens. But when this is not done, as it clearly has not been done, the federal government must act to assure the full rights of citizenship for all people. This must, of course, be accomplished by constitutional means.

The basis for Title II seems to be the concept of a "business affected with the public interest" and the interstate commerce clause of the Constitution. It has been the right of government to regulate and control the use to which "business affected with the public interest" can be put at least since the famous case De Portibus Maris decided in the British courts in the seventeenth century. The kinds of businesses held to be "affected with the public interest" have been increasingly extended and definitely specified. It is my opinion that all those businesses included in Title II have been held to be so affected. The meaning of interstate commerce as used in the Constitution has also been widely extended by Supreme Court decisions and today includes the types of businesses mentioned in Title II. It would seem, therefore, that the authors of the bill have been careful to include only those businesses which have been held by the courts to be public and to be included in interstate commerce. Whether or not they have gone beyond the present meaning of interstate commerce must be determined by the Supreme Court.

**The March: An Endorsement**

Joe Howell has come under considerable personal pressure this past week to call off tomorrow’s civil rights march. The pressure has come not from the Davidson College administration, but from certain sources in Charlotte, and from such unlikely persons as the parents of friends, who have “broken relations” with him because of his role in the march. On other campuses, pressure from college administrators has cut down the number of marchers to the extent that Howell would have had an honorable out yesterday on television by blasting the pressure sources and calling off the march. Howell didn’t take the out, not because he is particularly looking forward to the march, but because he is an unusual fellow who happens to believe strongly in what he is doing. We are also proud to note that in several instances he has received badly-needed moral support from some professors here who have also expressed a willingness to join the march in support of the civil rights bill.

For those who have criticized Howell for “marching rather than trying to effect positive programs to help the Negro cause”: since Howell took over as YMCA President, that organization has begun a Negro Tutorial Program, has expanded a Negro recreational program, has organized visits by Davidson students to Negro schools, and has actively encouraged student participation in areas such as voter registration. YMCA members have also been active on the Davidson Civil Rights Committee in planning concrete steps toward bettering the lot of Negroes in this community.

The Charlotte Observer could have saved themselves an editorial this morning if they had done a little homework of their own on the reasons for the march, as set down at length by Howell on several occasions. Howell has repeatedly emphasized the fact that participation in the march does not necessarily imply support of the entire civil rights bill as it now reads. The only belief which is shared by all the marchers is that strong civil rights legislation should be passed by Congress as soon as possible.

As for the possibility of violence, the best way to find trouble is to look for it, and Charlotte Mayor Stan Brookshire has been doing some looking. The Charlotte Police Department had the right idea when its spokesman stated that he anticipated no trouble for a peaceful demonstration. However, Brookshire keeps mentioning violence, and the more he says about it the better the chances of trouble occurring become.

We admire Joe Howell for his willingness to stand by what he believes despite heavy pressure and criticism, and we endorse the Charlotte march as a valid means of expressing support for the civil rights bill.

We often wonder whether white Southerners really are acting in their own best interests by opposing the civil rights bill. The civil rights movement in this country has been focusing for months on the civil rights legislation now before Congress, and if that legislation does not go through, Negroes may start looking elsewhere for solutions to their problems. For an example of which way they may turn, try the Black Muslims. The publicity surrounding Cassius Clay’s joining the Black Muslims has shocked some people into realizing that American Negroes aren’t going to stand for being deprived of their lawful rights forever. The Black Muslims are a direct outgrowth of frustration, and Clay once said that his reasons for joining the Muslims amount to this: he doesn’t intend to force himself on anyone, and if the white man doesn’t care for his company, he doesn’t particularly care for the white man's. So instead of touring Africa as a goodwill ambassador for the United States, Clay goes to represent an organization which is dedicated to the concept of Black Supremacy!

Many Davidson students who are willing to actively support the American Negro’s drive for full civil rights will join Joe Howell in the Charlotte march tomorrow. For those who may wish to express their views under different circumstances, Paul Simpson is planning a two-way panel discussion of the entire question of civil rights. The discussion will begin at 10 p.m. next Thursday in the Union.

**Rights Law Will Protect Voting, Job Opportunities**

Ed. note: This past Monday the Senate opened debate on H.R. 7152, the House-approved omnibus civil rights package. For those who have supported the bill or railed against it in total ignorance of its provisions, we offer the following summary of the measure’s 11 sections. The summary was prepared by J. Francis Pohlhaus, counsel for the Washington bureau of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.

**Title I: Voting**

The title seeks to further protection of voting rights. In any Federal election it would prohibit (1) the application of different tests, standards, etc. and (2) denial of registration for immaterial errors in applications. It would require all literacy tests to be given in writing or to be transcribed. It would require expeditious handling of cases filed under the 1957 and 1960 Civil Rights Acts, and to that end would authorize the Attorney General or a defendant to ask trial by a three-judge court, with direct appeal to the Supreme Court. In any such proceeding it establishes a presumption of literacy for those who have completed the sixth grade. The right of the defendant to request a three-judge court was added by amendment.

**Title II: Public Accommodations**

Title II prohibits discrimination in places of public accommodation as defined in the bill. It would cover most hotels, motels and other places of lodging; restaurants, cafeterias and other eating places; motion picture houses, theaters, sports arenas, stadiums and other places of entertainment and athletic performance; gasoline stations; and other establishments located in, or containing, a covered establishment—such as specialty shops in hotels or stores with eating facilities. The individual aggrieved or the Attorney General would be able to enforce rights under the title through injunctions.or other civil actions.

Title III: Desegregation of Public Facilities

This title would allow the Attorney General to initiate or intervene in cases seeking desegregation of public facilities owned, operated, or managed by public authority, where the injured party is unable to pursue the remedy. It would also authorize the Attorney General to intervene in cases already filed by individuals seeking relief from denial of equal protection of the law because of race, creed, color, or national origin.

Title IV: School Desegregation

Title IV would authorize the Attorney General to initiate or intervene in school desegregation cases if the injured parties are unable to pursue legal remedies. It would also provide technical assistance, grants, and training institutes to help in the desegregation process. By amendment, the House added a definition that desegregation would not include transporting students to end racial imbalances.

Title V: Commission On Civil Rights

Under this title, the Commission on Civil Rights was extended four years and given additional duties to investigate vote fraud cases and to serve as a national clearinghouse on civil rights. Under the bill as reported by the committee, the Commission would have been made a permanent agency. The House weakened this title of the bill.

Title VI: Nondiscrimination In Federally Assisted Programs

This title prohibits discrimination in any program or activity receiving Federal assistance under grant, contract, or loan. It directs Federal agencies to establish programs of compliance and would authorize denial of funds to those that discriminate. Any denial of funds would be subject to judicial review. By amendments, the House guaranteed a hearing before a fund cut-off. It also required Presidential approval and a report to Congress before funds could be denied.

Title VII: Equal Employment Opportunity “FEPC”

Under Title VII, employers, labor unions, and employment agencies whose activities affect interstate commerce would be prohibited from discriminating in employment policies and practices. Coverage would include employers and unions with twenty-five or more employees or members. The number would begin with 100 or more and drop by stages to 25 after four years. An Equal Employment Opportunity Commission would be established to investigate and voluntarily settle complaints. Upon failure to settle, it would be authorized to file suits in Federal courts to enforce non-discrimination. The House extended the type of discrimination prohibited to include sex, as well as race, creed, color, or national origin. It excluded from coverage those denied employment rights because they are atheists or Communists.

Title VIII: Voting Statistics

This title provides for a voting census by race in areas designated by the Commission on Civil Rights.

Title IX: Remand

Title IX would authorize appeals in certain civil rights cases that are transferred to Federal courts from state courts, then remanded to the state courts. Under present law, there is no appeal when the Federal District Court sends these cases back to the state courts.

Title X: Conciliation Service

This title was inserted in the bill on the House floor, after having been deleted in committee. It would establish in the Department of Commerce a Community Relations Service with a limited personnel of six persons.

Title XI: Financing and Miscellaneous

The last title contains the miscellaneous provisions authorizing appropriations, protecting existing rights, and providing a “separability clause” — which states that if any part is held invalid, the rest of the act shall not be affected.

regulation as to whom one must (or must not) accommodate will probably achieve legislative compromise, that an advocate of any civil rights law should support the whole package (whichever variation reaches the floor first). This would give practical leverage. In the first place, this is little more than speculation; in the second, such maneuvering in the Senate is more likely to be successful if the major public sentiment urges deletion of unwanted particulars, than if such sentiment demands that extreme measures be adopted. Let the Senate's factions work out the compromise tactics with the knowledge of what the public truthfully wants.

There has been considerable discussion as to whether a federal “public accommodations” law would violate the U.S. Constitution. One can find the judgment of Senator Ervin (D. N.C.) on this point in the Congressional Record (June 24 and Dec. 10, 1963). Ironically, this section of the bill is being justified by some on the basis of Constitutional provisions, specifically those relating to equality before the law and interstate commerce. I would concede that the usurpation of private property rights by the federal government does not violate the 14th amendment or the power to regulate interstate commerce. The 14th amendment does not, however, (as yet!) authorize Congress to regulate private selection of business clientele in the name of equality. It seems a rather cynical manipulation of the interstate commerce clause to authorize this same federal intervention just because a motel may use soap or sheets or T.V. sets manufactured in another state. What institution is then free from this wedge? Will each state have to manufacture every household product, wedding dresses, textbooks for private schools, Bibles, etc. in order to protect folks from such a Constitution?

The greatest irony is that the U.S. Supreme Court cannot really be relied upon to rule this Act unconstitutional, even though a previous Supreme Court did just that with an earlier version. The personnel of the Court is not the same and many decisions have shown that precedent is only a temporary factor, and that “the Constitution is what the Courts say it is.” Whether or not it is unconstitutional in the view of the Court, which does not always accept the Constitutional provision that those powers not specifically granted to the federal government reside with the States, it may still be argued that the intrusion of the federal government into business operations which are entirely within the bounds of a state (or city) is a serious reduction of personal liberty. Therefore, it is necessary that the Senate be urged to delete this section of the bill.

Dear Editor:

In last week's DAVIDSONIAN there appeared a reproduction of an anonymous post-card addressed to Joe Howell's father concerning Joe's alleged involvement in an incident in which several Negro girls attended worship with the Davidson College Presbyterian congregation in the company of some students at the college. The fact that Joe was not even present at the service compounds this reprehensible attack, to say nothing of the ‘dating’ charge based on an initial impression without investigation. My concern in writing this letter, however, has to do with other implications of this unfortunate bit of correspondence.

Lest the “poison pen spatters ink” on the College Church, I wish to make clear that, while the penman may be a member of this church, his attitude and action do not express the official position of the church with regards to the general issue of the participation of non-Caucasians in the church’s corporate life. The Session of this church, which is its governing court composed of the congregation's elected representatives, has conclusively concurred and clearly stated that anyone who wishes to worship with us is welcome to do so. Moreover, I would add that there can be no test of race or motive applied to prospective participants for them to qualify as worshipers of the God who was in Christ and whose love is limitless. The College Church is not “our church.” It is the Lord’s, and as such its members and its minister do not have the right to exclude anyone included in the unconditioned invitation and welcome of Christ, the Head of the Church.

The penman who wrote that post-card did indeed fill his quill with the poison of angry alienation. However, it is my hope and prayer that we in the church shall so fulfill our God-given mission of reconciliation as not only to supply an antidote for such poisonous animosity, but also to substitute for its lethal invective the expression of Christian love.

Dear Editor:

The Oral Roberts Crusade of healing and evangelism will come to Charlotte's Merchandise Mart on March 19-22. Seniors will at once recall the A.A. Allen Crusade of our freshman year, when students and faculty went to stare, and, in many cases to laugh and scorn. So everyone dig out your overalls and brogans and go in for a good evening of entertainment and fun. They are obviously ignorant people who are nowhere near your social or intellectual level. Don't ever stop to think that there might be a substance of sincerity or of authenticity. After all, we've all read Elmer Gantry. Tolerance is all right toward Catholics, Mohammedans, atheists, etc. but not for “faith healers” and “holy rollers.” And you are much too sophisticated to think that your faith could enable you to be healed; so, of course, these “simple fools” could not have a deeper faith than you. After all, your “faith” has withstood atheists and Bible 11-12 — clearly there could be nothing lacking in you.

Dear Editor:

In response to a misunderstanding which has arisen concerning the letter I wrote to the DAVIDSONIAN last week, I would like to clarify my thoughts. The purpose of my letter was to express concern over the number of young faculty members who have left Davidson during the last four years. For this reason, I listed a number of young men who have left and are leaving this year. I did not intend to imply that all these men left because of conflict with the administration. Only seven of the fifteen men left as a result of such conflict. These seven are Dr. Lord, Dr. Goodykoontz, Dr. Staples, Mr. Horton, Professor Miller, Dr. Tilly, and Dr. Tucker. I do feel, however, that the departure of these men is cause for serious concern on the part of students, faculty, and administration.
