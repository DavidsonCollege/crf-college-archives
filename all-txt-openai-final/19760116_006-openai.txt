## Russ Stirs Bridge Interest

[CONTINUED from page 2]

"release results to the country over the AP news line," said Russ.

Russ hopes that enough interest will be stirred to have 10-15 tables operating by mid-March.

In the opening round last Friday, the team of Bo Hunter and Mark Jester finished first, followed by the teams of Alan Rockett-Charlie Burson and George Flavell-Mike Russ.

The deal which produced the widest range of results was the following (north-south vulnerable, west deals):

### North
S: 10 8 2  
H: 8 7  
D: Q J 7 5  
C: Q 10 9 8 3  

### East
S: 7 6 5 4 3  
H: Q 10 9 2  
D: 9 8 3 2  
C: 2  

### West
S: A K J 10 9 8 6  
H: J 7 4 3  
D: None  
C: 4  

### South
S: Q  
H: A K 6 5  
D: A K Q 10 6 4  
C: K 9 6  

The East-West team of Mike Robinson and Rick Rauck reached a bid of five spades, which Rick made by careful play (lead a low heart toward the Q 9, play the 9 if North plays low). The North-South team of Mike Russ and George Flavell made the Diamond Slam.

one’s own obituary to ask in a symbolic form "what do I want to do with my life?"

A new Life Work Planning group will be formed in the spring term; anyone interested should contact the office now.

Another exploration-of-self exercise is the Extern Program. Students use their free time over spring break to observe professionals such as Wyche Fowler, President of the City Council of Atlanta, Jim McKnight, Editor of The Charlotte Observer, the President of the Morris Speizman Textile Machinery industry in Charlotte, Congressman Jim Martin. Other possibilities include exploring environments such as the Institute for Aerobics Research in Dallas, the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, banks, radio and television stations, Merrill Lynch International Inc. in New York City.

Davidson uses its alumni network to connect students and professionals.

MERLE MILLER, author of "Plain Speaking," a biography of Harry Truman, will speak on campus the week of January 26.

## Reshuffled Union Plans Midwinters

By BRAD SWALWELL  
Senior News Editor

The Union Board at this week’s meeting finalized plans for the activities to be held during Midwinters Weekend. Midwinters will be the weekend of January 23-24.

"There’s going to be a lot going on," said Social Committee Chairman Robert M. Mayer. "Wednesday through Saturday that week Robin and Linda Williams will be performing in the 900 Room.

"Also, the Drama Department will present the play Curse You, Jack Dalton three times, beginning Thursday that week. There will be performances Thursday and Friday night at 11 p.m. and Sunday afternoon at 2:30," said Mayer.

Mayer went on to outline some of the other activities planned for Midwinters. Friday night, in addition to the Pop Film (the title of which has not been decided at this time), there will be a formal dance.

The band will be Frankie Lester and the Steel Pier Orchestra with the Big Band Cavalcade.

"We are working with Zack Long in the Alumni Office to try and get a dance class set up for Friday afternoon," said Mayer.

Saturday afternoon will be the Davidson vs. South Carolina basketball game. "Dress will be in the spirit of the 1950s. The group (hall, fraternity, eating club, etc.) who comes to the game dressed best in the 50’s spirit will win a keg," said Mayer.

"There will also hopefully be a reception in the 900 Room after the game," he added.

The concert Saturday night will be with Wet Willie, along with Robin and Linda Williams to open the show. The concert will be from 8-11 p.m.

In other action, the board voted to revamp the Union committee structure. The Union presently operates with 16 committees. In a move proposed by Union President Karl E. Goodhouse, the board streamlined the structure by reducing the number of committees to 12.

As a result of this change, several committees were eliminated by being merged into a single committee and another committee was eliminated by being made a sub-committee of an existing committee.

Goodhouse commented on the effect he expected the reorganization to have. "Basically, it will make the organization a heck of a lot easier to work with.

"First, we have reduced the number of committee chairmen we have to work with from 16 to 12. This will streamline things.

"Second, we have put some committees where they belonged in the first place.

"Third, we have combined workers, which strengthens their ability to do their job. Some committees were having trouble getting their work done. This move will make it easier for them," said Goodhouse.

"In short, we have created a more convenient and functional body which should be able to produce maximum programming," he added.

Also, the board approved an Outing Club request for $250 to help fund their Outward Bound mini-course which will be held over Spring break. The board referred to the Executive Committee a report on the possibility of establishing a weekend check-cashing service in the Union.

## YMCA Drive

collection with the help of a YMCA book drive and there are good relations with the Charlotte-Mecklenburg library system.

A cook school, which teaches inmates how to cook, Otey feels is the best program offered, as it provides practical training. One former inmate is employed at Slug’s Rib in Charlotte.

"Assistant Professor of Sociology Robert D. Ruth’s course to provide contact with prisoners and take honor grade prisoners out of the camp is effective also," said Otey. "Local authorities are aware of the problems and have good relations with Davidson College."
