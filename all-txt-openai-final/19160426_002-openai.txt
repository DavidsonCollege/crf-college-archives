A MENACE TO DAVIDSON.

Some time ago at a meeting the student body voted to discountenance the taking of college property. Yet this is
going on with both college and personal property. “Somebody swiped my book" and “I lost my raincoat” have become almost
daily expressions, while the large number of “Lost” notices on the bulletin boards is of significance. Yet this thing is
tolerated by the students, because the attitude taken toward such work is not one of stealing. There are many who
would despise the thought of stealing, who think nothing of not returning a borrowed pocket knife. The man who can
slip in and take a light from the gymnasium is considered more of a hero than a thief. And Davidson
is not alone in this. But the time has come when such work can no longer be masked with terms
of “thoughtlessness” and “forgetfulness.” Face it honestly, and it is stealing. But the small minority of the student body which
does the taking is not entirely to blame, for the majority is at fault in not branding this as wrong
and treating it as such. It will be a smirch upon the fair name of Davidson if such a condition
is tolerated any longer by its students.

A COACH FOR TENNIS.

Granted that football and baseball are the major sports at Davidson, yet the game played most consistently, and by most
of the student body, is tennis. Every other game from football to horseshoes has its season and its stars, but
tennis is played from September to June, not by a few celebrities, but by a majority of the students. Yet,
strange to say, every other sport, even boxing, has its coaches, while tennis is uncoached. The average man starts as
a Freshman, and after four years of practice becomes a comparatively good player, but a coach could bring him

WEEKLY MEETINGS.

At the regular meeting of Phi Society Saturday night the query debated was: “Resolved, That the U. S. Government should
compel every male student in any institution of college grade to take at least one year of military training.” Those
on theAffirmative were: Kornegay, Clark, and Carson. They contended that a one-year military training would give the United States a
well-trained army reserve and the training would do much to develop the students physically.

For the negative, Ratchford, Neal, and Farrior showed that the training would not be adequate, that it would divert the
student from his studies, and that it would be too great an exercise of authority by the government. The judges
rendered their decision in favor of the affirmative.

Monday morning, a declamation was given by Hunter. McLeod gave a short talk on “The Blanket Fee,” McIntyre spoke on
“The Civil Service,” and H. Morrison on “The Literacy Test for Immigrants.” McCormick gave the last talk of the morning,
his subject being “Bud Fisher.”

Instead of the regular weekly debate last Saturday night, the Eumenean Society was addressed by five or six members, who
pointed out some of the definite defects in the society and gave suggestions as to the furthering of its welfare.
The meeting was then thrown open for general discussion, following which refreshments were served.

At the regular meeting Monday morning, several very good speeches were given. Patton gave a very interesting outline of the
work of a congressman. F. H. Smith, in a few well-chosen remarks, showed the work of the electoral college and
what it represented. Hoyt also gave a very good oration. The articles of agreement between the two societies were read
and approved, after which the officers for the next term were installed.

A VOTE OF THANKS.
The thanks of the student body are due to J. E. Faw, '15, for his courtesy in writing up the
report of the debate with Emory which appeared in the last issue of The Davidsonian. While here, Faw was one
of the men who did most in the student body for the good of the college, and he is continuing
his efforts now as he did then. His tennis has all been learned through experience and is not in the
least scientific. If a good coach could be secured for a few weeks in the fall to give some pointers
about the form and style of playing, position of the arm and hand, placing, and the like, it would greatly
increase the interest in and pleasure of this popular sport, and make Davidson a leader. If the tennis association would
take this up, it could be done.
