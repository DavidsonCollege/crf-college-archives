**President's Assistant College's Money-Man**

By CHARLES ROSE
Davidsonian Feature Writer

In the southern end of Chambers on the first floor are located offices. Offices that handle the business end of
Davidson College. Students pass through this dimly lit area daily, to and from classes or to stop on official business
in one or more of the glass-doored rooms. There is one portal in this area, however, through which very few
students have any reason to pass. On that door are black letters, spelling out the words ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT,
and behind those words is a room, an office—a very busy office. There are three desks in this office, and
around the room are many boxes of printed material, brochures of all sizes and types. They have generally the same
theme in one way or another—money.

At one of these desks sits—sometimes—Mr. Robert J. Sailstad, “Assistant to the President of Davidson College in the area of
college development.” His gray suit, horn-rim glasses, receding hairline, and friendly smile immediately tell you that this is a businessman.
Mr. Sailstad sat at his desk and talked freely of his impressive hopes for Davidson. He fumbled with his latest
masterpiece in the field of fund-raising literature—a spiral-bound booklet he plans to “rifle out to key friends of Davidson with
the hope of securing the necessary money needed for the Dana Science Laboratories.” On the front cover, in a very
artistic layout, were the words “New Friend. A Timely Challenge.”

“I am part of a committee of about one hundred key alumni now being set up to acquaint industry, alumni,
and parents with this wonderful challenge,” Mr. Sailstad said. He went on to say that Davidson has a yearly living
endowment. “This year we are out for $155,000 and hope to reach $200,000 by 1960. This endowment represents a broad
base of support by many people.” As Mr. Sailstad sat at his desk, he said, “My job is to coordinate
long-term development and fund-raising policies of the college.” He works with alumni, parents, and trustees to be certain that there
are leaders able to interpret the college's educational program on a long-term basis.

When asked about his part in the Dana Science Building, he said, “The name of that building is to be
the Dana Science Laboratories and we plan to use the rifle and not the shotgun approach in raising funds for
this one. The gift of Mr. Charles A. Dana came as a result of Davidson's excellent record in training doctors
and scientists. This work would be handicapped if our facilities stopped expanding, and Mr. Dana saw this. It made good
sense to him.” The Dana gift of $400,000 was accompanied with a “gentleman’s agreement” that the college secure the funds
necessary to complete the $625,000 laboratory building and a dormitory able to house 130 students. This plan is tied in
with the Trustees’ decision to increase the enrollment of the college to one thousand.

**Fine Film Festival Premieres Tonight**

Dr. G. B. Watts will lecture on the play “Cyrano de Bergerac” and its author, Edmond Rostand, in the Ballroom
tonight at 8 p.m. Following his talk, the movie based on the play, and starring Academy Award-winning Jose Ferrer and
Mala Powers, will be shown. It will also be shown Saturday night at 8:00 p.m. Since this film is the
first in the Fine Film Festival, the admission is 35 cents.

“Man With a Million,” starring Gregory Peck and Jane Griffith, will be shown October 16, 17, and 18, at 8
p.m. This comedy, based on a story by Mark Twain, deals with the adventures of a penniless American in London,
who was given a million-pound note and then set loose to spend it.

Representatives from the Duke Law School will be in the Green Room of the Union from 3:00 to 6:30 on
Thursday, October 16.

The Student Activities Office is coordinating the efforts of various groups on campus to present a program of both the
Republican and Democratic candidates in North Carolina before the November elections. Mr. Charles K. McWhorter, legislative assistant to Vice-President Nixon,
will speak at Davidson next Friday, October 17, in the Union ballroom at 8:00 p.m. He will present the Republican
viewpoint on “Campaign Issues: Present and Future.” Mr. McWhorter, a lawyer by profession, was engaged in organizing Young Republican Clubs
all over the United States before he took his present post with Mr. Nixon.

Mr. McWhorter’s appearance at Davidson is the first tangible result of the activities of a new organization on the campus.
This group, unnamed as yet, consists of several students and faculty members, most of them connected with student organizations, who
are particularly interested in bringing speakers to Davidson and sponsoring programs on public affairs, and have formed a coordinating committee
for this purpose.

**Dance Parties**

(Continued From Page 1)

...to hurt them at all. The only parties we're trying to discourage are those that would hurt the reputation of
our students and perhaps bring action by the trustees. Since the individual private parties, which Emmrich believes are the real
cause for the problem, have in the past year become less in number, more fraternity parties are now being encouraged.

The only rule so far has been that of closing the Fraternity houses at 5:00 Saturday morning and at 3:00
a.m. Sunday. Dr. McGavock said on behalf of his Faculty-Trustee Committee, “We are very hopeful, beginning now with the Fraternity
Presidents taking the leadership, that we can get this matter settled.”

Reminded that the trustees' schedule for arriving at the increased enrollment called for the addition of about thirty...; more students
next year and 9:15. Union Board Delta Phi Alpha | Sigma Upsilon asked about his views on holding off on
this addition until accommodations were available. Dr. Johnston had a dual answer. First, he said, “I think the Trustees are
the bosses. However, it would not be my personal desire to add more students. Both from the view of the
physical plant and the teaching loads, we can do a better job without the increase.” Sailstad said, “This money is
used for such things as scholarships, salaries, and the general operation of the college.” Mr. Sailstad taught English and Speech
at the University of Minnesota and at Stevens. It was at Stevens that he first went into the field of
public relations and publicity work. Davidson has one of the best organized and most successful fund-raising systems in the country.

Puckett attended a conference sponsored by the National Science Foundation and held at Williams College in Williamstown, Mass. He was
one of forty men from all over the United States who participated in the conference. The conference itself consisted mainly
of guest lecturers, seminars, lab work dealing with the latest developments in the field of embryology, and field trips to
various geological formations in New England and New York.

Trustees Accuse Vespers Problem

A nine-man committee concerning the overcrowded conditions of Vespers met and requested that the Trustee Committee on Religious and Social
Life hold a meeting on October 24, the date of the Trustees’ Executive Committee meeting. The primary purpose of this
meeting of the Religious and Social Life Committee, consisting of Dr. Craig Davis of Asheville, chairman, Dr. John A. Redhead
of Greensboro, and the Rev. Fred Stair of Hickory, will be to gather new information on the Vespers situation. Dr.
Staples expressed doubt that any concrete, long-range solution would be reached at this meeting since the problem will probably require
considerable deliberation.

The nine-man committee, including Mr. Plott, chairman, President Martin, Dean Bailey, Dr. Staples, Dr. Newell, Professor Minter, Jim Richards, Lamar
Evans, W. Schenck, Hugo Misle, Charles O’Briant of the YMCA, and David Robinson of the Student Council, has not planned
another meeting because it feels that this is a long-range problem to be worked out by the Trustees.

On Tuesday, October 21, an all-day political forum will be presented. Two Democrats and two Republicans will speak briefly in
chapel, followed by a panel discussion on the political parties and their principles in the Union ballroom Tuesday night. Mr.
Henry H. Wilson, a Monroe attorney, and Mr. Hiden Ramsey, a newspaper editor from Asheville, will represent the Democrats. Mr.
William Cobb, state Republican chairman, and another man yet to be selected will present the Republican viewpoint. Charles Raper Jonas,
member of Congress for this district, will present his view of the issues in his race for reelection.

In the morning, do you carefully choose a tie, matching jacket, etc., instead of grabbing the first thing you see
in the closet? Do you try to keep from getting angry because you feel that emotion can interfere with your
judgment? Do you like to “show your stuff” when you know you are really good at something? Can you honestly
say you like to be entirely independent of others in most things you do? Do you ignore extravagant claims and
think for yourself when making your choice of a filter cigarette? The fact is, men and women who think for
themselves usually smoke VICEROY. Their reason? Best in the world. They know only VICEROY has a thinking man’s filter and
a smoking man’s taste.

If you have answered Yes to 6 of the above questions... well, you do think for yourself!

Dr. W. O. Puckett combined business with pleasure this past summer. Puckett, a member of the Institute of Developmental Biology,
attended a conference sponsored by the National Science Foundation and held at Williams College in Williamstown, Mass. He was one
of forty men from all over the United States who participated in the conference. The conference itself consisted mainly of
guest lecturers, seminars, lab work dealing with the latest developments in the field of embryology, and field trips to various
geological formations in New England and New York.

But of even more interest than those, to Dr. Puckett, were the small northern colleges. He looked over Amherst, Wesleyan,
Middlebury, Smith, Mount Holyoke, and Bennington, and is of the opinion that Davidson stands up well in comparison to these
schools. “No college that I saw,” said Puckett, “had a finer or better-kept physical plant.” These colleges do, however, have
endowments two or three times that of Davidson. They consequently have a better scholarship program and a lighter teaching load.
Dr. Puckett stated that Davidson was “well known and highly regarded” among the Yankee colleges. Dr. Puckett plans to go
north again in November to Buck Hill Falls, Vermont, where he will take part in a conference on pre-medical education.

Cheerless leader

Not a “rah rah” left in him! He's just discovered there’s no more Coke. And a cheerleader without Coke is
as sad as a soap opera. To put the sparkle back in his eye—somebody!—bring him a sparkling cold Coca-Cola!
