### EDITORIAL

#### BEGINNING OF THE END

At no time during the college year is there such a temptation to forget work and spend our time doing
exactly nothing, as during the month just before Commencement. Everyone is worn out; there is a mass of work on
hand which bewilders even the most energetic, and vacation is almost at hand. And as if this were not enough,
we have the finest season of the year to be out-of-doors on a campus which is unexcelled as an ideal
loafing place.

But it is just at this time when we should start to work with new energy and do something really
worthwhile before the year closes. Many a game has been won—and lost—in the last few minutes of play. It is
not at all impossible that two or three weeks of hard work just now will hold a man above that
dangerous dividing line, or even raise his standing to that delightful position when a “ticket” may be considered as “passed.”

As important as it is, however, to finish our college subjects in a creditable manner, yet there are other things
which should take a good share of our remaining time. It would be a strange thing if the men of
the Senior class have been in college four years and have not found things in the student body activities which
should be changed. Tentative plans have probably even been formed; schemes for improvement have possibly failed to find expression, simply
because there has been no urgent reason for advancing them. But soon it will be too late, for the active
influence of an alumnus in the student body is nil. Every man in the Senior class owes it to himself
and to the student body, to review his four years of college life and to put into operation those things
which will be of benefit to Davidson.

The men of the other classes, with less experience, but with a greater opportunity, should make plans for next year.
The first weeks of every college session are weeks of confusion, and only those improvements will be made which are
planned this year. Go over those things which concern every man on the campus—the Societies, Athletic Associations, Student Body Government,
Y. M. C. A., Clubs, Publications, and the list might be lengthened almost indefinitely. Every man should think about these
things and then put his thoughts in writing or speech; but by all means, pass them around. Don’t be afraid
everyone will agree—they won't. And only those changes will be instituted which will stand the test of criticism.

The most important thing is, first, to think about these things carefully, in the light of past experience and future
possibilities; second, to work out in detail those changes which you think should be made; and then third and last,
to give the necessary work to convince others of the wisdom of the plans, so that they will put them
into operation. These last few weeks should be made a season of constructive work for the college, and in this
work, every man should take his full part.

### DR. VAN NOPPEN LECTURES

Dr. I. C. Van Noppen, the Queen Wilhelmina Lecturer of Columbia University, delivered a lecture here Monday on Holland and
its Literature before and during the Renaissance.

Dr. Van Noppen began with a eulogy of the Dutch. He said: “Holland receives less from God and has given
more to mankind than any other nation.” As the Dutch, because of necessity, have ever been a practical people, they
have been able to enrich mankind with literature, paintings, and inventions. “The Dutch have had religious freedom from the very
beginning. They claimed that the ruler should adopt the religion of the majority of his subjects and should not force
the people to believe his own special religion as was done in England and Germany. The Dutch realized the value
of liberty and have always...remained a nation of individuals. Holland has had a great influence on English and American civilizations.
The fundamental principles upon which our Democratic government is founded were borrowed from the Dutch. Dr. Van Noppen made a
moving appeal to the universities of this country to take Dutch into their curriculums, saying that it was not widely
known, but was truly great.

DR. LINGLE LECTURES.

Last Friday night, in Shearer Hall, Dr. Lingle, at the request of the local Civic League, delivered a very interesting
and instructive lecture on “Germany, At Peace and War.” The topics discussed under this subject were: the municipal government and
the high degree of perfection in its organization, the general life of the people, the elements that have produced such
success in Germany, these being their industry, thoroughness, specialization, general education and intelligence, and good organization. The orders of German
society were given as follows: The court and nobility, the public and military officers, the university professors, the successful business
men, and following these the general populace. The government of Germany rests in the hands of the Emperor and his
Cabinet and in the upper and lower houses of Parliament. Another topic discussed was the contributions of Germany to literature,
science, music, and philosophy. The causes of the present war were given as the immense standing armies of the nations,
their colonial disagreements, Vienna's attitude toward the Balkans, and the autocratic monarchies. A very good audience composed of the town
people and students was present and all were well pleased with the lecture, which was a timely one.

THE EQUITABLE LIFE

During its 55 years’ history has been tested by panics, wars, fires, and inquisitions, any of which would have ruined
a weak, poorly managed company. Its existence today is its strongest recommendation. It stands for SERVICE, STRENGTH, SECURITY.
