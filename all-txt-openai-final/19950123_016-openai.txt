A Final Cat Nips

Davidson bids farewell to Final Four in high fashion

By Will Cobb

When time expired in the 1994 Men’s Soccer NCAA Division I Championship last December, athletic events came to a close
on Davidson’s Richardson Field for the year. The closing seconds brought an end to an era that will change college
soccer forever. Three years ago, Davidson took on the responsibility of hosting an event that boasted only a few flashes
of success. Three years later, Davidson bid farewell to the Final Four after setting a pleasantly surprising precedent.

This December, the Final Four will move to the 20,000-seat Municipal Stadium in Richmond, Virginia, with big shoes to fill
following the success established at Davidson. For the third year in a row, the event broke attendance records for the
two-day event.

“Our staff felt the last [Final Four] would be the one we thought we would be remembered by. The faculty,
staff, and students overachieved even my goals. We rest our case,” said tournament director Lee Sargent.

The three-year stint ended in shining fashion with a 1994 Championship attendance that exceeded the 12,000 mark. From 1992 to
1994, the attendance total increased by over 50% with a rise of over 2000 fans each year. Davidson took a
struggling championship event and made an immediate impact that should change the face of college soccer forever.

In the past month, the Athletic Department has received several accolades for the three-year effort.

“Congratulations to you and the entire Davidson campus and community in once again hosting an outstanding collegiate championship event. You
folks have set a standard of excellence by which all future events will be compared. We at the NSCAA are
deeply appreciative of your contribution to the game,” said Steven Veal, Program Director of NSCAA.

“All of us in the soccer community owe you and Davidson a tremendous debt of gratitude. You have given us
and the sport we love a great sense of respect and pride,” said Jerry Yeagley, head coach at Indiana University.

“It’s not often that one experiences the total commitment to ensuring that everybody involved has a great time. It could
have poured rain and the crowd would have still carried the warm glow and camaraderie, enthusiasm, and the love of
the game,” said Lynn Berling-Manuel, editor of Soccer America.

Although the main focus has been placed on the impact of soccer, an equal impact was made on the college
both athletically and academically. Davidson received invaluable national exposure through the Final Four and Game of the Week telecasts last
year.

“It gives us an identity nationally, which is a hard thing to purchase,” said Sargent.

While many others owe a level of gratitude to the college as hosts, the school owes an equal level of
gratitude to the many who made the dream a possibility, especially individuals like Sargent, Terry Holland, and Charlie Slagle. Although
the time served as hosts ended prematurely, the course of college soccer has been changed forever. Davidson is the reason.

ATTENTION:

The Athletic Dept. would like to ask a special request of Davidson students. Due to the success of the men’s
basketball team, average attendance is exceeding 2500 for the season. Since only 600 parking spaces make up the Sports Complex
lot, many fans are forced to walk from Concord Street. The absence of available parking has made conditions rather unsafe,
especially for night games. For safety reasons, students, faculty, and staff are asked to remove their cars voluntarily from the
immediate Baker Sports Complex Area on the afternoon of the remaining night games. Staff members have already agreed to comply
with the request and hopefully students will do the same.
