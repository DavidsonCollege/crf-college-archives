Side Line Shots At the Wildcats on the Court and Mat
By P. R. Alderman

Judging from that game last Saturday night, it’s pretty obvious that the Wildcats are to be reckoned with before the
champion of the “Big Five” is determined. There’s no victory quite so sweet as one over our ancient foes, the
Carolina Tar Heels. Here’s hoping that that bad foot of Carl Pritchett’s is OK before very long. He’s there in
every game!

The Furman game is the only one in the loss column of the Wildcats’ contests so far. That’s not at
all bad for this early in the season.

One of the chief problems that Davidson foes must consider the rest of the year is in the form of
Bill Goodson. When it comes to guarding he’s more trouble than a hornet’s nest.

With a two weeks’ rest, barring some practice, for both the fresh and varsity quintets during exams, they should be
ready to wax hot as more and stronger foes are met. The Kitten quintet seemed to have found themselves in
the second game with Charlotte Hi. Their teamwork was far from perfect in the initial clash.

Pritchett is again leading his teammates in points scored. He and Captain Johnston should have a pretty close race for
the title of high-scorer for this season. Rogers, diminutive forward on the fresh quintet, is leading the scoring for the
Kittens with “Skinny” Pierce running a close second. Unless fate is extremely cruel, “Red” Laird should have one of the
best frosh cage teams seen here in quite a few seasons. As soon as they get to working together a
little better they’re going to be hard to stop.

Everything seems to be starting out right this year—Coach “Tex” Tilson’s matmen exhibited mid-season form to overwhelm the strong men
from Concord last Friday. It’s going to be up to the wrestlers to revenge our loss to the West Point
gridders last fall—that’s going to be a tough match but Wildcats are Wildcats on the mat as well as on
the grid.

The guarding of Wagner and the floorwork of Peabody have been the outstanding feats of the Kittens so far this
year. Pierce, Manson, and Rogers have also shown up well.

In spite of the one-sided defeat of the Concord “Y” wrestlers last week, the fight and grit that their heavyweight
entry exhibited against Captain Christenbury of the Wildcats demanded the admiration of all.

It was time for the roll call at the Polish Institute. The professor sneezed, six students jumped to their feet
and cried, “Present.”

When I was a small boy, I was left an orphan. That girl is a mathematical impossibility. Howzat? She’s half
Spanish, half French, and half crazy.

Monty: “That careless iceman, I’m glad he’s losing out all along his route.”
Friend: “No, it’s the new butcher boy.”

Class Teams To Resume Intramural Competition With Trophy For Winner
Plans Being Drawn up for Contests to Begin in Early Spring

Plans for the most comprehensive system of intramural sports that has ever been attempted at Davidson College have recently been
announced by Capt. Norton G. Pritchett, athletic director. In outlining the plans, Captain Pritchett said that competition would be between
teams representing the several classes. Each sport will be run off during the spring, points given for first, second, third,
and fourth places, and at the end of the year the winning class will have a bronze plate bearing its
name.

The sports included are: basketball, baseball, campus football, volleyball, track, gymnastics, tennis, golf, and Sigma Delta Psi competition. If the
representatives of the classes so desire, boxing will also be included inthe list. The basketball and football competitions have already
been run off, and the Seniors are leading in the scoring at present. Volleyball competition will be started this week,
if possible, Captain Pritchett stated. Tennis and golf will be played during the spring, as will the intramural track meet
and baseball. The gymnastics and Sigma Delta Psi competition will be carried out during the spring also.

Concord “Y” Grapplers Overcome By Wildcats In First Meet Of Year

Four Davidson Men Defeat Opponents by Falls and Three on Time

The Davidson College Wrestling Team opened the 1930 season here Friday night with an impressive victory over the Concord “Y”.
The score was Davidson 30½, Concord 11½. Four of the Davidson matmen threw their opponents, three won with a time
advantage, and one match resulted in a draw. The team was in very good shape for the opener and a
successful season seems to be in prospect.

The trophy which will be presented to the winning class has already been ordered and will soon be on display.
It is a large wall plaque, on which will be placed bronze plates bearing the name of the class which
wins it for each succeeding year. While most of the competitions will be among the teams of the classes, this
will not be the case in some of the sports. In the gymnastics, the names of the twenty highest men
will be taken, and the class which has the greatest number of men in that group will be declared winner.
In tennis, a team of four men will represent each class in the tournament, and the individual winning the tournament
will be declared winner for his class.

Trackmen Working Out Daily For Initial Meet

Although no official call has been issued to track men so far this winter, many are out working every day,
getting in shape for the approaching season which opens with the University of Virginia Indoor Invitation Meet on the fifteenth
of February. Regular spring practice will start soon after exams, it was intimated. The 1930 track schedule announced by Capt.
Norton G. Pritchett includes seven meets, with the possibility of adding three others. The schedule at present follows:

Feb. 15—Uni. of Va. (Indoor meet).
Mar. 29—Uni. of S.C. at Columbia, S.C.
Apr. 5—Furman Uni. at Davidson.

your voice repels me, sir! If you wish me to go buggy-riding with you, you’d better change to OLD GOLDS.
When my heart leaves me, it will go to the man who smokes this queen-leaf cigarette. There’s not a throat-scratch
