_ A good start for

Birth

Following footsteps
Through uncolored snow:
She wondered where
The frozen road
Would take her.
(Not knowing where to go
On her own)—
She moved pensively:
One step
Two
Growing suspense _
And onward.
Three long thoughts ago
Her troubled mind
Had spoken:
“Pathways already set
Wind to an end
Already met
By another.”

A weary wanderer.
Then returning to her
Inward resources—
The girl realized...
That the footsteps
Were not her size.
She hesitated,
And stepped aside the
Vanilla mold...
And broke it.

Running wildly
Through a new frontier
With nothing
To steer her
But passions
Then exposed
She dashed through
The lonely
Snowy afternoon.
Powdered clouds
On the horizon _
And her iridescent jacket
Formed a subtle
Sunset—
Announcing that
A new-born day
Was soon to come.

Fear

Push out of your room
Project yourself

Onto the open landscape.
Trees hold out their branches
Land opens its palm

Sky ripples forever
Lakes stretch in the sun.

Hedge-clipper triangles

Nibble your legs:

“Now run into the back room!”
Lawn mower.
Meat grinder—
Catch-all for pieces

Of you.

Ivy creeps the windows
Of the back room.
