**EDITORIAL**

**OUR DEBATERS**

Can you recall the first time you spoke in Literary Society, when you found yourself scrutinized by scores of critical
eyes? Somehow the floor seemed to recede, and the room rocked in a dangerous manner. Your temples burned, and you
were conscious of your nose gradually turning a delicate lobster red. And all the while your empty mind was searching
for the opening words of your speech. Remembering this, can it fail to excite you to admiration when from out
of our midst there rise two who have the courage to face a thousand Winthropites, and not only that, but
who can argue so forcefully and convincingly that an opposing, though able team, is defeated by the unanimous vote of
the judges?

Those who attended the debate report that there flowed from the representatives of Davidson, rivers of eloquence rarely surpassed in
those old halls. And truly, men who have, unnoticed, spent the greater part of six weeks in strenuous preparation, and
by a final effort have extended Davidson's influence and prestige, are worthy of praise and esteem from the men on
the campus. Next week another Davidson debating team will meet Emory, which has the record of never having lost a
series of debates, and their defeat by Davidson last year was the first in eight years. Why not give our
debaters some of the praise and help due them before they go, and cheer them on to victory.

**THE MAGAZINE REFORM**

The Davidsonian is by no means antagonistic to the Davidson College Magazine. So we can truthfully say that we are
glad that plans are being adopted looking toward a renewed interest and a new lease on life for the Magazine.
A revision of the Constitution was adopted in the Eumenean Society last Monday morning and is to be voted on
in the Philanthropic Society, which provides that the editorial board will be cut down from twelve associate editors to four.
These editors will have direct control of the Magazine's policy, and will oversee the literary work rather than do it
themselves. They will inject as much competition as possible into the work and will plan for novel productions and departments.

The fact that very little interest is now taken in the Magazine is a lamentable one. This is one of
the most attractive fields in all college work. And who knows but what some literary genius is budding unseen around
here. Who knows but what an O. Henry is sheltered (in a way) by Rumple, or Chambers, or even Georgia.
It is your duty to bring out the best literary talent that is in you.
