### JUNIOR SPEAKING

(Continued from page 1)

These performances are to be devoted in their entirety to defraying the expenses of the next “Junior Speaking.” A special committee, appointed recently, has charge of the arrangements and sale of tickets for the Lyceum attractions; and this committee is conducting a thorough canvass of the college and town.

The first of the numbers will reach Davidson about October 23rd. The Lombard Entertainers, the first of the traveling acts to appear in Davidson, will bring to the students a unique and compelling program. Harry Lombard, director and lead of the trio, will appear with his supporting cast in a number of costumed sketches from popular operas such as “The Bohemian Girl,” “Pagliacci,” and “The Fortune Teller.” Other striking features of their program will be character and novelty songs, duets, trios, readings, whistling solos, violin solos, pianologs, smoke pictures, and an appealing sketch entitled “His Home Town Girl.” The act, brimful of interesting numbers, is sure to give the college students and townspeople an hour of superb entertainment.

The second of the acts will be presented by the Shaw Concert Company of Utah, and will show at...Davidson some time during the month of November. The organization, headed by Miss Frances I. Shaw and including four versatile young men musicians, is regarded by competent critics as one of the best musical attractions doing lyceum and chautauqua work. The members of the company offer an hour of pep and jazz, with some of the most novel orchestrations now being played. The remaining two numbers will not be presented until after the Christmas holidays. They will probably be staged by the Chicago Entertainers and the already famous American Glee Club. The two attractions are presented by two captivating young ladies, who render a number of musical and character sketches. The American Glee Club specializes in every type of music known to a glee club organization. They will offer quartette and solo instrumental numbers, vocal selections, and select impersonations. Prof. E. J. Irwin is supervising the presentation of these numbers, and he has chosen them especially for the appeal they will hold for college students. Assisting Professor Irwin is the Junior Class Committee, composed of T. S. Lawson, chairman; M. B. Speir, W. S. Brenner, and R. B. Parker.

Literary Societies had their first meeting of the year last Thursday night. With the exception of an extemporaneous program at the Philanthropic Society, little activity was reported among the four literary societies for their first meetings of the new year. In the main, these meetings were just preliminary to their second meeting, at which time each society will initiate its new members. The principal work of the old members of these societies so far this year has been to get a line on prospective members from the Freshman class and to get them interested in their respective societies.

On Tuesday night, a week ago, the old members of the Metrophilian and Pandemic Literary Societies held short meetings, the chief importance of which were the plans made for the reception and initiation of Freshmen, which is to take place at the following meeting. The Eumenean and Philanthropic Societies were encouraged by a large number of Freshmen in attendance at each meeting. W. B. Ramsey, president of the Eumenean Society, briefly described the nature of the work in a literary society and then urged all the Freshmen to be present at the next meeting, at which time they will be formally received. All societies are planning to serve refreshments after the initiation ceremonies are completed.

For the benefit of the new men, a list of the literary societies with their meeting times, places of meeting, and the officers in each is published below:

Eumenean—7:15 p.m., Thursday night at Eu Hall; W. B. Ramsey, president; Tom Barr, vice-president; W. S. Woods, secretary; P. B. Freeland, treasurer; E. Hopkins, critic.
