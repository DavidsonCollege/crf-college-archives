REV. R. T. COIT CONDUCTS SPLENDID SERVICES
The Davidson Student Body has been exceedingly fortunate during the past week in having Rev. R. T. Coit (Bob) ('02),
back on the Hill, after six years on the mission field in Korea. In addition to the regular Y. M.
C. A. meeting last Thursday night, Mr. Coit conducted short vesper services on Friday and Saturday, which were very helpful
and inspiring.

Thursday night Mr. Coit based his talk on Hebrews 12:29: “For our God is a consuming fire.” Very clearly he
developed his theme, showing that fire (1) reveals things, (2) consumes, (3) purifies. “Thus God reveals Himself to us—purifies us,
and if we continually refuse Him, consumes us. Mr. Coit said: “There are hidden things in our lives which Christ
alone can show us. We think we are in college getting ready for life, but we are in the midst
of life now and God is here and wants us. We are living our lives in miniature here in college.
We should come alongside of the matchless life of the Master and have the little hindering, impeding barnacles brushed away.
We might exert an influence here now that will touch the uttermost ends of the world.”

Mr. Coit declared that the great message that he received from the Laymen’s Convention in Charlotte was that “God is
willing to do with an average man what He has never yet done with a brilliant mind.” Mr. Coit's talks
on Friday and Saturday were just as practical and convincing. Preaching both the sermons in the church on last Sunday,
Mr. Coit gave a ringing call to the students of Davidson College—a call to service, very strikingly showing the need
in Korea froman educational, a medical, and spiritual standpoint, respectively.

DEBATING TEAMS HARD AT WORK

The Emory debate may be postponed because of the Easter holidays at Agnes Scott College, but no definite plan has
been decided upon as yet. Most of the judges have already been decided upon for both debates. Last Saturday Emory
held its finals in the local debate and chose its team to combat Davidson. The four debaters who will represent
Davidson this spring are all rooming on one floor and hard at work. Any stranger happening in either of their
rooms would imagine himself in a Carnegie Library and ask for the fiction department. But he would be sadly disappointed
because nothing but facts and cold reality are stored away in those massive volumes.

POPULAR LECTURES AT GRADED SCHOOL

Last Spring, Dr. Arbuckle gave some interesting talks with simple experiments with water and air to the upper grades of
the Davidson school. The school betterment committee is again arranging a series of informal talks for the same grades by
several of the professors. The first of these will be given Friday morning, March 5, at 9 o'clock, by Dr.
Lingle, on “Europe at Peace and at War.” Dr. Wilson McConnell has promised to give the next talk on “Health
and Hygiene,” at a date to be announced, and others will follow. Parents who are interested will be welcome at
any of these lectures.

DEATH OF C. P. BURKE

A very sad death was that of C. Burke (ex-'14) last Saturday in Charlotte. He was taken ill on a
train from his home in Taylorsville. Pneumonia developed finally into meningitis. While in college, Burke was a member of the
Orchestra and Glee Club, and associated with various other college activities. His bright, genial spirit won him many friends. His
Davidson friends will sympathize deeply with the family in their loss.

Dr. Moore McConnell is about again after several days’ illness.
