### Local World at New Bar

Davidson alumnus Denis Cowarden, who graduated this May with the other members of the Class of 2002, didn’t have a long summer vacation before becoming general manager of Bottletops, a new local restaurant/bar. Opening its doors on June 1, Bottletops is recent enough for most upperclassmen to have never heard of it, despite its significant Davidson connection.

Davidson seems a very unlikely place for a bar to open, especially given the past failures of other establishments such as the Depot. Though Davidson is a college town, most 21-year-olds seem to satisfy their thirst for beer on Patterson Court or at the senior apartments, with other options just down the interstate in Huntersville or Charlotte.

So it might surprise some that Bottletops has opened on Main Street Cornelius at the former SubStation II location, not far from Carolina Cones or the YMCA and just over the demarcation line splitting Davidson from Cornelius. Nevertheless, Cowarden says, “We want an environment where college kids can come and have a good time. We’re hoping folks will come out and enjoy themselves [as we] offer a good product at decent, competitive pricing.

“Earlier in the day, I focus more on my business lunches, and I don’t really sell a whole lot of alcohol. Then we look for the people that come in after work, and at night, for the most part, that’s when the kids come out. We want an exciting place for everyone. You don’t have to be 21 to come in here and eat,” Cowarden adds.

Cowarden, who was born in Phoenix, Ariz., but raised in south Charlotte, has worked at the Graduate Food & Pub’s Lake Norman franchise with owner Kelly McCullough since his sophomore year at Davidson, and served as general manager there, too. McCullough also is the owner of Bottletops.

Though the bar serves alcohol, Cowarden also emphasized the selection of food served to all ages. “We have sandwiches, melts, wraps, salads, and cold drinks—a little something for everybody. We serve pretty healthy foods. Most of our meats are very lean, and we don’t kill you with condiments. We don’t have a fat fryer, so we offer sides of coleslaw and pretzels, that sort of thing. It is something other than bar food in a bar.” As priced on Bottletops’s menu, all of the entrées mentioned above cost around $5 to $7.

It was Cowarden’s affinity for restaurant work that led to his current job, and his days as a member of Pi Kappa Alpha at Davidson, not his B.A. in art. “PiKA pushed me to want a social job, where I’m around people and actively working. I’m not the type to sit down at a desk job,” Cowarden admits. His degree will be useful for “decoration,” he jokes.

“I am very busy. Once I can delegate more duties to employees equally, then my degree is something I'll be able to pursue. I’m still working on a couple of side projects, and right now I’m marketing my work from college. Hopefully that can be what I will do for my career, with this line of work on the side,” Cowarden says.

### College Ranked Ninth by U.S. News & World Report

While U.S. News and World Report ranks Davidson number nine among 218 national liberal arts colleges in a report released today, a college official says the story behind the number is what’s important.

“More important than the absolute number is what the components of the ranking say about us,” said Nancy Cable, vice president and dean of admission and financial aid. “All of these ratings validate our focus on students as whole individuals.”

The ninth place overall ranking was up from number ten last year, and number eleven in 1999 and 2000.

The magazine based its rankings on seven factors this year—academic reputation, graduation retention, faculty resources, student selectivity, financial resources, graduation rate, and alumni giving.

Davidson ranked number one in the country in faculty resources, a number that it compiled from statistics on class size, proportion of faculty with highest terminal degree, student/faculty ratio, and faculty compensation.

Cable said, “The faculty resources ranking emphasizes how we remain grounded in our historical mission to provide the best education possible for our students. Students who enroll here enjoy a great classroom experience with top-rated teachers in small classes where they will be both personally nurtured and intellectually challenged.”

Davidson ranked number five in graduation retention, with an average of ninety percent of those who enroll graduating. Cable said, “The retention number illustrates our college’s commitment to build community on campus. Students are successful here, and there is plenty of help from both the faculty and staff to address any obstacles that may get in their way.”

Cable said she is extremely proud that Davidson is the only national liberal arts school in the top ten (and one of only two in the top twenty-five) located in the southeastern United States. “If a high school senior is looking for a great liberal arts education in the Southeast, but with a national and international student body, Davidson will naturally emerge as a top contender,” she says.

The rankings also don’t include any mention of athletic programs. However, Cable noted that Davidson is the only college in the top 25 that plays a NCAA Division I schedule. About twenty-five percent of Davidson’s 1,600 students are varsity athletes.
