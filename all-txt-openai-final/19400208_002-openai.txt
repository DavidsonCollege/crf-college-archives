- - - - - - - - -Position. That is right. Now, as to the efficacy of airing the
qualifications of the candidates when history books. Why must our present rulers be referred to with the stigma of “politician”
tacked onto their names? It is seldom that we see the word statesmen in our newspapers today; Roosevelt is a
politician, Farley is a schemer, and hardly ever is anyone with the exception of Cordell Hull termed a statesman. In
the accounts of the late Senator Borah, he was termed a statesman. But my point is this, a statesman is
one who is a political leader of distinguished ability, while a politician is one who is a schemer with intrigue
and craftiness implied. Did you ever hear of a British “politician”? There may be one, but I never see his
name in print. If all this ceremony were selected, how nice our country would abide by the first piece of
printing ever done in America in 1689 by Stephen Daye, part of which follows: “I do solemnly bind myself in
the sight of God, that when I shall be called to give my voice touching any matter of this State,
in which Freemen are concerned, I will give my vote and counsel as I shall judge in my own conscience
may best conduce and tend to the public weal of the same, without respect of persons, or favor of any
man.” If every man took this as an oath and followed it, then there would be no more politicians afloat
in America, but political leaders of distinguished ability whom future historians would refer to as statesmen.

You are familiar with the speeches, you can talk with those in colleges that have open politics and get the
tenor and character of the campaigns and the speeches. I believe you will find, as I did, that both sides
hold meetings that rival national politics in mud-slinging and the cleavage between individuals or groups which back every candidate. All
conjecture and personal opinion, you will immediately say. All I ask is that you talk frankly and unbiasedly with men
from the larger schools that have open politics. (I underscore larger because I know of no small school comparable with
Davidson that uses open politics. There are some institutions that compare with Davidson in everything but size. Therefore, I say
larger). Most of them have politics run to its logical extreme of parceling out offices according to the power of
the group to which the smaller groups belong.

GLEANINGS By MELVIN MEANS GUEST COLUMNIST

Now that all the beauties and pleasures of the Mid-Winter dances have been transformed into the dormitory emptiness of the
rooms, the enjoyable post-mortems have come to an end. To Paul Marion and the boys who brought so much feminine
loveliness to our acquaintance, and to the men who didn’t have dates, a filthy and squalid existence they crawl about
the earth. Chester performed in a palm-treed setting which acclaimed Tom McLean and Charlie Yates as the finest of decorators.
And Dean Hudson for the next dances ought to make Mid-Winters the biggest of the weekend. And also, it was
the dope that leaked out about Phil Edwards walking the bachelor’s last mile in Emporia, Va., last summer and later
having his steps retraced conveniently by the courts. And they say that Phi Doty talks like a married man. Speaking
of marriage, newly-weds Snookie and Bob Abels were seen, and Teeny and Caddie were there Saturday night. With a strange
suddenness, Dick Winter began to cultivate his appreciation of music by playing opera records in his room. Dave Colvin, after
four visits from “Bad News” Gaffney, finally found solace and companionship with Gene Vereen, who had late date trouble with
a Phi Delt alumnus but held the fort successfully. Then there is the tale about Reverend Cooper and Lokey Brandon
on a certain sofa. Here the turbulent career of Spencer's frat pin row is today and gone tomorrow. But he
has six KA lockets to take to Converse Saturday. Reports have it that Bob Chester offered to place Joe Barnwell
with almost any band in the country. And that doesn’t overestimate his ability with the drums. Crooners Knoeller and Claude
Hackney also deserve a spot in the local boy makes good story. Laurie Carlson must have made Bob Kellogg forget
everything. He left for New York after telling her goodbye as if school didn’t matter anymore. Jasper Currie’s lovely “Miss
Coathanger from Suitpress, N.C.” Almost everybody had a cold or a bad throat, wonder why. The “Duke” announces that on
the whole he wore a hat during the dances for the girls’ sake, we suppose. A Phi Gam freshman song
from fraternal conspiracy and Sophie Walker. Jack Holland initiating neophytes to the “Alligator Club” which he had pledged. Holland, Richmond,
and company conducting the greatest send-off party of the year at the Charlotte depot in which everything was “bumped” from
the engine to the caboose on a passing freight train. Rod Turner was elated with his blind date from West
Virginia. Colonel Lippfert down from New York filled to the brim with the latest Yankee wit. Confusius Mid-Winters superlatives. Richmond
McDaniels was the greatest victim of snakes. Number one snake, as nominated by his roommate, was Neal Scott. He was
busy Monday with follow-up letters. Among alumni vacationing here were Paul Cooper, Dun and Bradstreet's Sam Hemphill, Hotel man Pitman,
Dick Taylor, and Miss Poo Poo Wyatt. Hope to see here again Marion Webb, Frankie Taylor, Gloria McCall, Betsy Rodwell,
and hundreds of others. Miss Rodwell was the date of this column’s usual author. Bouquets to him for her presence.
And curses for having me write this column. Confusius say wise man not write this column, foolish man best stop
before too late.

Murphy’s Mumblings By BOB WILLIAMS

Thursday and Friday, February 8 and 9: “I Take This Woman”: Spencer Tracy and Hedy Lamarr. Watch it boys! Here’s
that woman again! You know the one that sent thrills through the heart of every male collegian in the country
last year in her two most famous pictures, “Algiers” and “Lady of the Tropics,” to say nothing of her French
strains. It is hard to connect Spencer Tracy, but a picture with his acting and her looks cannot help from
being good.

Saturday, February 10: “First Love”: Deanna Durbin, Helen Parrish, Robert Stack, Eugene Pallette, Lewis Howard. This is Deanna Durbin’s first
grown-up role and it is almost a fairy tale with Deanna playing a Cinderella part. It has been acclaimed by
the critics as her best performance so far in her career, and those of you who have seen any of
her pictures will know that you’ll have to cut out a trip to the drugstore in order to catch the
show on Saturday. It is Deanna’s beautiful voice and her wholesome personality that holds the plot together.

Monday and Tuesday, February 12 and 13: “The Fighting 69th”: James Cagney, Pat O’Brien, George Brent, Jeffrey Lynn, Alan Hale,
Frank McHugh, Dennis Morgan, and Dick Foran. There are two outstanding movies that are before the public eye at the
present time, the most outstanding of which is “Gone With The Wind,” of course, and the other that has been
so highly publicized is “The Fighting 69th.” It is the second picture of the school year that has rated the
four stars, and so if this corner’s humble opinion means anything to you, you won’t miss this one. There is
punch, power, valor, and vigor in this story of a misfit, a cowardly fighter, who brings havoc to his comrades
in battle. Jimmy Cagney plays the coward, and into the role he pours all his peculiar talents. In turn, one
hates him, pities him, is sorry for him, and is proud of him. Next in honors comes Pat O’Brien, as
the understanding Father Duffy, priest and friend to the boys of the Fighting 69th Regiment that distinguished itself with glory
in the World War.

Wednesday, February 14: “The Sun Never Sets”: Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.; Basil Rathbone, Virginia Field, Lionel Atwill, C. Aubrey Smith, and
Melville Cooper. It seems that Basil Rathbone will again be in a mystery thriller, furnishing the lead, with Doug Fairbanks,
Jr., and Virginia Field composing the romantic element. An imposing cast, especially for Bargain Day, and a picture well worth
seeing.

And arrangement of who is to get what office passed around year to year, not by the vote of the
entire student body, but by the wire and leg-pulling done in a political session held in the attic of the
strongest society on the campus. I have talked with people at Carolina, State, LSU, Tennessee, Mississippi State, Vandy, South Carolina,
Randolph-Macon, and a few others. They all envy us, but are skeptical of the politics-less-ness of our setup. They all
dislike, for instance, having the head of the dance committee come from the ABC’s because their clique is in power
and it is their year to have a ten-point dance committee office. Ask some of the thinking, frank, just students
if they don’t hate the hypocrisy of the big-wig session held in the attic of the strongest society on the
campus. Then if that fails to convince, sit in on one of the meetings in one of these schools where
they have their parties and their campaigning. I’m against open politics because it is unfair and hypocritical. Your first statement
now is that our system is unfair and hypocritical, too. Yes, it is, but not to the same extent nor
for the same reasons. As long as people think and feel and have opinions, there will not be a completely
uninfluenced vote cast. Last year, the Council did not try to stop talking, thinking, or having opinions. It did try
to stop any formal, though it be (Continued on Page Six).
