Poetry by Janet Sanford

Crepuscule

Indian Summer

...lose the blue horizon---
Flaming lime and swirl
I studied the light at the end of a winter's
afternoon
plant exotic seeds on
the cathedral trees
crumbling veins hold
My tongue and dive
electric velcro sprouts
a spark---
trying to find its edge
stretching austere iron
tendons upward,
to see.

And I see
Today, a hint of orange
where it glazes the crepe myrtle by the door,
drips from branches -
their dark armaments divide the sky
stained violet.
The glass glows indigo around the edges,
And am I here now, or there then,
or in someone else’s album
rhythmic stomp of the dancers’ feet
that follow the shivering tambourine.
Slim brown ankles
the feet, dusty and bare,
treading the path to the market,
the press of bodies,
of tapestry and dust,
circled by silver bracelets
shifting, swaying,
and amber
then I am home,
lost in the grainy photographs
of Victorian houses
and families in antique dress,
their sober whites now
sick yellowed
they stand in their yards
with relish and leaves at their feet.
and somewhere near
a cow lumbers past,
the world tilts
and I feel the music
and the poetry in patterned silk
undisturbed.

I cross the yard,
head down, watching
the withered grass
and wood chips.
A few pink petals surprise
and complete the evanescent palette.
as a child
I spun myself dizzy -
till the ground rushed
up to meet me
my temples throb,
overcome,
So today, orange.
the world’s a strange place
leaves at their feet.
and somewhere near
a cow lumbers past,
the world tilts
and I feel the music
and the poetry in patterned silk
undisturbed.

I cross the yard,

---

Of the last cymbal and the Nomads head for the bar. “What are you doing?” He tries to shove his seat back and stand straight up but the table stops him. “Song’s over, sweety,” she says. “So’s the stage dance.”

“That’s fine, but this hundred is for a table dance. Hell, I’ll even get the band to play the same friggin’ song.” The stereo kicks in. One of those songs with electric drums you hear at dance clubs. The girls come on out: stage-dancing, table-dancing, wandering around.

“I would like a hundred,” he says, smiling.

“Rest of the song, darling?” Maria asks.

“Two at the most. Oh, and don’t forget about the calves.”

“My pleasure.”

“Darling,” he’s looking at me, “two, no, three more scotch and waters.” I’d love to slowly pour these pitchers into his bastard eyes. If I was Maria, I’d take my top off, throw it in his face, and tell him to do the dance. Leave this damned place topless, let everyone see they don’t matter.

But Maria turns around and moves her backside to half the beat. Each time Maria grabs her calves she’s probably telling herself she’s catching her breath. She better be thinking of something else. Tim yells to me from across the bar with his jolly round smile. As I walk toward him, I look over my shoulder to see the bastard handing his wife some money and pointing at Maria’s G-string. To the side of them, the backward hat boy, with his money in mouth, motions he wants Maria’s top off, and the shy boy next to him is still playing with the foam in his beer.

“It looked like you were needing to get away from that,” Tim says. He’s a regular. Red-cheeked. We call him Saint Nick. He was here when I first started dancing.

“Can you believe that?” I ask. “Maybe I just didn’t have time to notice this shit when I was stripping.”

“Too long or hard. But I agree with you. If a man can get a woman, he has no business bringing her here.”

“What can I get you, Tim?” I ask, glad to laugh. “I can see you’re already feeling philosophical.”

“Nothing really. Well, how about a bourbon. Sure, why not a bourbon. Think we should get Thomas the bouncer to keep an eye on them.”

“She’ll be all right,” I say. By the time I get back to Tim with his bourbon, the idiot is sitting by herself sipping on another scotch. Part of me would like to ask and tell her a few things, but it’s really none of my business. A slow song comes on and I’m happy to say the Nomads may be through for the night.

“Here you go, Mr. Tim.”

“Thank you, Ms. Al.” The dancers lead their partners up on stage for what may be the last slow dance of the night. And there is Maria, hand in hand with him, guiding him up the stage steps, while his idiot sits and watches. Maria tosses her top on the floor. I imagine that red wine sweater is rough, and then she laughs. God dammit, she laughs. He has to be paying her to laugh like that, just like he has to have paid her to throw her top away. Bastard must be trying to teach his wife some sort of lesson about control. I’m afraid for her. Seems they haven’t learned a damn thing.

Jennifer leads a crippled man in a wheelchair to the stage. His buddies, who aren’t in uniform but weight from one foot to the other with a smile, and the crippled man uses his arms to do wheelies, back and forth, side to side, leaning back like he’s on the ends of a rocking chair. He comes close to falling a couple of times but doesn’t. He laughs each time and each time his army buddies laugh with him. I imagine Jennifer will choose “Faith” after tonight’s dance. I try and smile at this.

“Hey Al,” asks Tim, “why did you stop dancing?” I pretend not to hear him and take a sip from his beer. I look past Maria and the bastard, and past the crippled man and “Faith,” and I stare at the Ellens. Each night beneath the stage’s hot lights, Rachel Ellen slowly and quietly unbuttons her own blouse, tonight it’s the yellow one with the faded white flowers, and then she allows her braless breasts to sag and press against one of Hal’s polyester shirts, tonight it’s the blue one. Each night they look into each other’s pink eyes, and each night they look a little drunk and a little in love. And he never touches her breasts as if they belong to a Paper Doll. The owners, Mark our manager, and the dancers have always overlooked the Ellens’ dance. And I have never understood it, and I have never asked.
