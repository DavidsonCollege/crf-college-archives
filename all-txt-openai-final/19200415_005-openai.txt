THE DAVIDSONIAN, April 15, 1920.

ADOLPH ZUKOR presents

"THE COPPERHEAD"

J. M. Dunlap, Editor.

Fresh Sydenstricker solves the
“high cost of flowers” problem by
sending his girl some forget-me-not
seeds.

On Sprunt field last Thursday
there was given a comical perform-
ance modeled after the famous play.
The title of this play was “Ump’s Ankle,” and while
Umps did the leading role.

Eris C—"I’m sorry but I can’t eat
sweets between meals.”

Fair One—“Then eat enough to
make it a meal.”

“Shep” (to girl on train)—“Do
you believe in Darwin’s Theory ?”
Girl—“Yes, at times.”

Did you notice who occupied the
“bald head row” at the concert at
Queens last Saturday?

Give us a rest from the verses
That we hear from day to day.

Sing us a brand new song again
And sing it without delay.

Cut out the calsomined faces,
Outblazing the sunsets red.
Away with the hair which once
Grew out on another’s head.

Sing on a pleasant subject,
just so it is something new,
Like the joys of going to chapel
Or the pleasures of a review.

Boost up the board you're getting,
Tell the joys of being sick—
But when you start to do it, lad,
Be ready to dodge a brick.

ANOTHER FEATURE PICTURE
TO BE SHOWN SATURDAY

Lionel Barrymore, Supported by All
Star Cast, to Appear in “The
Copperhead.”

“The Copperhead,” the season's
biggest movie, is to be presented in
the gym this week. This wonderful
picture stars Lionel Barrymore, tal-
ented brother of the equally famous
Ethel and John Barrymore. All who
are tired of punk movies can show
their appreciation of a real master-
piece by seeing to it that all their
friends in town and in the college
see this one and this will certainly
get more like it.

The cast of characters includes:

Milt Shanks—Lionel Barrymore.

Lieut. Tom Hardy, U.S. A.—Wm.
I. Carlton.

Abraham Lincoln—N. Schroll.

Theodore Roosevelt—Jack Ridg-
way.

Capt. Mercer, U.S. A—Maj. N.
M. Cartmell.

“Ma” Shanks—Doris Rankin.

With nine other important char-
acters and as “extras” 200 soldiers
of the Mexican war, 2,300 Civil War
soldiers, and 1,200 Civil War Vet-
erans.

This film is a skillful reproduction
of Augustus Thomas’ great stage
success, “The Copperhead,” which
has been sensationally presented in
New York eighteen weeks; Chicago,
eight weeks; Philadelphia, two
weeks; Boston, two weeks; Wash-
ington, Baltimore and nearly a doz-
en other large cities a full week.

The rising action, leading up to
the crisis of this thrilling story, be-
gins at the outbreak of the Civil
War. On the very day that Milt
Shanks, of Hillville, Ill., decides to
enlist he receives a summons to
Washington. There President Lin-
coln entrusts him with the danger-
ous task of keeping the government
posted on the plans of the “Copper-
heads” in his community.

Milt, working with a band of con-
spirators, led by Lem Lollard, is
captured by a band of soldiers. As
a patriot among these soldiers,
“Joey,” Milt’s only son, scorns his
father, whom he regards as a trait-
or. Under court-martial Milt and
Lem are summarily convicted of
treason and—

Fresh—“That’s a sure sign of
death.”

Soph—“What ?”

Fresh—“A cemetery.”

firmary notes.
