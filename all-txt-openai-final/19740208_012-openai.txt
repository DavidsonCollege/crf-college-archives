**In Defense Of A Tormented Dylan**

Critics of pop music are, for anyone who hasn’t noticed lately, professional conmen.

We (and I include myself among these august ranks only because I have been paid for my talents, not because
those talents are particularly noteworthy) have a rather nasty habit of assuming truth to be that which we want it
to.

The Dylan phenomenon is an amazing sidelight to rock. His music has always been in the mainstream; on vinyl he
is a pacesetter.

But out of the studio, Dylan is more than another writer/singer/rocker. I know as well as anyone else his mythical
position, his place in our culture; he has meant as much to me as anyone that I have not known
intimately and as much as some I have. That must be true of every self-styled rock critic over 19.

The problem with this attitude is that it denies Dylan the right to change. We make lousy demigods. They can
always change their minds.

For years, Dylan played with the myth. He lived up to our expectation. He defined us as “outlaws”, he gave
us music you could enjoy in any context. He made Holden Caulfield, Woody Guthrie, Jack Kerouac and Billy the Kid
middle-class chic. He embodied the sixties and promised Gates of Eden somewhere in the seventies. His personableness is amazing. He
is universal, and a sizeable chunk of those of us who grew up with (or even through) him. I still
know a friend I can identify with every portrait painted in “Just Like Tom Thumb’s Blues” and “Desolation Row”.

Which brings us back to “Dylan”. The fight here is the same fight that started with “Self Portrait” in 1970.
He isn’t doing what we want him to; we feel sold out.

Fine. Think that if you want. I still like it.

What these things mean to me is that Dylan is changing, probably has been all along, and no longer cares
whether we come along on his trip or not.

In a time when everyone from Elton John to the Band is marking time with a product keyed around music
they played 10 or 15 years ago, why can’t Dylan have a little fun too? That’s the essential quality of
both “Self Portrait” and “Dylan”—they're music just for fun.

Prophets, I suppose, are not allowed to enjoy themselves. God save us from serious prophets.

On “Dylan” we have nine songs that are fun to listen to, and a very strong statement. When I played
“Spanish Is the Loving Tongue” for a friend of mine, he started flamenco dancing around his living room.

We professional conmen have a vested interest in determining the truth. It keeps us working. We take Dylan and categorize
his genius. We determine a niche for him.

A record like “Dylan” blows that niche right out of our wall and makes us look silly.

Maybe the difference is best summed up by Steve Simel’s review of “Exile On Main Street”. He said his “critical
opinion” was that the album was a regression, but his “honest opinion” was that he loved it. I guess that’s
how far we’ve degenerated.

Perhaps critical response to “Dylan” is to turn off the stereo and say “Bob, forgive us, we know not what
you do.” I only know that my honest response is to get up and flamenco dance around the room.

“Dylan” may not be as good as “Blonde on Blonde” or “Highway 61”, but nothing else is these days, either.
You look for the old Dylan, I’m gonna dance around the room.
