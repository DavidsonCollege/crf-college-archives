**The Davidsonian**

**Sheldon House holds memories**

Highway 73, monotonous with the traffic of workers’ mornings and late afternoons, where tractor-trailer rigs drone at night, supports a
thick growth of houses before it leaves Davidson. In winter’s early dusk, dinner time smells blow among the houses, mothers
call their kids, and a professor on a rattling black cycle rides like a shadow down the road. Concord Road
musters one modest hill while it still has a sidewalk. It is here the house with a cupola spreads its
porch about it safely, like a skirt. Over the porch, the cupola glows through its large paned windows, visible from
Jackson Court.

Scarcely beyond the border of academia is the house with a cupola where students have roomed upstairs for decades. Tidy
brick steps with a rail bring you up to the short lawn and before the porch with its gabled entranceway.
The lady of the house, with a pair of forceps as long as a cane, doesn’t want her picture taken,
but of the rooms, that is fine. They are dark and silent, hung with handicrafts and Biblical illustrations in rich
flesh tones. One wooden picture frame is carved into foliage and another is made from seashells that form rose blooms.
A beautiful crimson Oriental urn on the mantle has always been here in the house.

Johnsie Shelton has lived here 71 years—not all that time, of course. For several years, in the thirties, she taught
elementary school, first at Sherrill’s Ford, where her father was born and raised, then at a school for the children
of R. J. Reynolds employees. Later she went to eastern North Carolina, to a school that served two mill villages.
Some of the children there could see little use for school. Their fathers were mill hands who couldn't read or
write, but made more than her monthly salary of $25. “I had to quit school when my eyes gave way.
It liked to have killed me. The doctor told me not to go into school again,” she lamented.

She returned to Davidson, looking for work, “offering to do anything honest.” She found work with a doctor in town,
and helped keep children. Then she served as a fraternity house mother for Pi Kappa Phi (ancestor of Emanon) for
more than twenty years. They gave her a color television set when she retired. She’s gotten in the habit of
watching soap operas; they are her favorites. Each day she sees “As the World Turns,” “Guiding Light,” and “Search for
Tomorrow.” “I’ve sort of gotten to like ‘Name That Tune,’” she confesses, “but they don’t need to use the language
they do on those shows.” The students that live upstairs come down to visit every day and sometimes have cookies.

**Popular pizza spices search for exception**

The individual who doesn’t like pizza is a rare bird. But there is a good deal of controversy as to
exactly what constitutes good pizza; one man’s meat is another man’s poison. When it comes to analyzing pizza, I'll admit
to being far from a non-partisan observer. While pizza is a strictly American adaptation of the Old World deep-dish tomato
pie, it remains associated with the Italian nationality. Logically speaking then, wherever you have large concentrations of Italian-Americans, there you
should find good pizza. Needless to say, the South is not noted for its large concentrations of ethnics. While that
doesn’t rule out the possibility of finding outstanding pizza on occasion, the likelihood of that occurring seems too remote to
anticipate with expectation.

The search for the exceptions has produced a few spots worthy of note, however. Ye Old Pub, located on The
Plaza near UNCC, specializes in pizza topped with lots of cheese. Served only in small or medium sizes, it is
reasonably priced and rates a “good” listing. This “homey” tavern (described in a previous article) also serves very good London
Broil and a wide assortment of sandwiches. Catering to a “young adult” type of crowd, it has a pleasant atmosphere.

Gus’ Original 49er serves pizza of a similar type. Cheese is abundant, but extra toppings somewhat limited. So far, the
place leading my list is the Olive Tree, located on Sharon Amity, near Albemarle Road. It offers a rich tomato
and spice sauce (as opposed to cheese-based) that was selected for mention (favorable) in a national recipe guide. The crust,
while not perfect, did achieve a rather happy consistency between the chewy and crispy varieties. The menu consists of pizza,
spaghetti, and chef salads as the only entrees. You may carry out or eat in. The atmosphere is simple, yet
attractive. Seating space was at a premium when I was there, as were parking spots; and waitresses were scurrying around
gathering up pizza trays and spaghetti plates to keep ahead of the crowd. Twelve different toppings were offered, including both
green and black olives and banana peppers, for those with imagination and a little daring. The garbage can special offers
all 12, with the exception of...anchovies (an unwise omission). Prices are reasonable, and a large selection of beers and wines
is available. These three locales provide a starter for the adventuresome, tired of the same old drive to Mooresville’s King
of Pizza. Later commentaries will deal with the Open Kitchen, La Strada, and the Liberty restaurant, three more Queen City
attractions.

She hasn’t seen much of the college since it went coed, so she can’t evaluate the effect of coeducation, but
last summer she had a “sweet girl live here, with such a pretty face.” She does follow Davidson basketball scores.
When her sister was in high school she coached a girls’ basketball team. Once, when they needed a neutral court,
they played at the college. “I made the girls pull their bloomers down and their stockings up to cover their
knees. I don’t know what they do now,” she remembered. Her younger sister now lives in Erie, Pennsylvania, and spends
the winters in Florida.

It is Christmas that reminds her of cadet season, during World War II when there was a cadet school on
the campus. She reminisced, “There were all sorts of people here then, it was one of the most interesting times.
People used to go to the train station to meet the train of cadets. There was a lot of sadness
in those times, but a lot of happiness. Many of the cadets got married.” Johnsie rented the downstairs of the
house to cadets and their wives, and commented, “I can remember a Christmas we had one of the biggest meals
ever. I bought a twenty-eight-pound turkey—then you had to pick them and dress them yourself. All the children in the
neighborhood came to help pick it in the backyard.

“I wanted to cook a really good meal for those boys; a lot of them were from the North. I
had never carved a turkey before and I didn’t know what I was going to do, but one of the
boys asked me if I’d like him to do it, just as we went to the table. I was so
relieved.

“Students used to know all the people in town. Now you never see them, they have so many activities. I
didn’t get the school directory until a few days ago,” she relates, “but I see there’s a girl in there
from Decatur I’d like to meet. Her grandmother was a real good friend of mine.”

Though she was born several blocks away, her parents built this house as their first permanent home when there were
wheat fields and pastures along Concord Road. Now the afternoon traffic rushes on, children play on the sidewalk and Davidson
College spins away on its own axis.

An all-night basketball tournament will be held in Johnston Gym from Friday, February 6 at 4 pm to Saturday at
2 pm. The event is being held to raise money for Easter Seals and is being co-sponsored by WSOC TV/radio
and the local chapter of Phi Delta Theta Fraternity. Guy Hicks, one of the coordinators of the tournament, sees its
purpose primarily to raise funds for Easter Seals. “Easter Seals provides summer camps for the handicapped, free transportation to jobs
and schools, and has equipment loan programs for those who can’t afford the often expensive equipment needed; all three are
worthwhile projects which depend on strong financial support.”

The basketball games will be played for one hour and will last until a tournament winner is determined. Teams will
consist of five or more players who will pay a $10 entrance fee and obtain sponsorship from other students, friends,
parents, businesses, or other sources. Trophies will be awarded to the winning team and the team which raises the most
money.

Another purpose of the tournament is to bring people together for fellowship. To achieve this goal, a party at the
Student Union has been organized which will run all night along with the basketball tournament. Refreshments and entertainment will be
served at the Snack Bar. Union President Karl Goodhouse explains the Union’s role in the tournament as “a campaign to
get students to stay up all night and to provide the activities to make this alternative ‘all-nighter’ an enjoyable experience.
Game rooms will be open, music will be played and some other special events are being arranged.”

Hicks emphasized the need for student support. “Students have a chance to become active in a good cause; their involvement
is the most important factor for the success of the project. Interested students can participate by organizing and playing for
a team, volunteering to referee or serve as a host, spreading the word about the tournament to friends, and by
just coming out for the party.”
