# The Davidsonian

By ADAM Martin
Senior Staff Writer

Lifelong Charlotte civic and business leader John Montgomery Belk ’43, chairman and CEO of Belk, Inc., will retire this summer
after 50 years in the family business.

“This is a perfect time for me to retire,” Belk, who turns 84 this month, said. “I’m in good health.
The company is stronger today than ever before.”

This economics major has helped turn the Charlotte-based retail store his father, William Henry Belk, started in 1888 into the
nation’s largest privately owned department store company, with 225 stores in 14 Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic states.

The Belk family name routinely falls out of the mouths of Davidson students. Whether trying to find a first-year’s dorm
room or a Studio Art class, one may find themselves invoking this Davidson legacy.

## John M. Belk to retire after 50 years in business

In 2000, John Belk became the largest individual donor in Davidson College history with his $28-million commitment. This commitment will
add to the John Montgomery Belk Scholarship, a merit-based program for academically talented student leaders, first established by Belk in
1994.

In terms of benefits to the institution, Belk’s contribution is comparable to Maxwell Chambers’ $250,000 gift in 1855 and James
B. Duke’s decision to include Davidson in his 1924 indenture creating the Duke Endowment. Davidson’s largest dormitory for first-years bears
the name of John’s father and mother, William Henry and Mary Pauline Belk. William served as Trustee of Davidson College
from 1929 until his death in 1952.

The Belks sent all five of their sons to Davidson College: W. Henry Belk, Jr. ’38, John M. Belk ’43,
Henderson Belk ’45, Irwin Belk ’45, and Thomas M. Belk ’46.

Belk’s record in the world of national business as well as state and local service testifies to the busy, achievement-
and service-oriented life that typifies Davidson students.

“If anyone deserves a chance to slow down, [Belk] deserves it. But he won’t slow down. He was not born
to be idle.” --President Bobby Vagt

Starting in 1969, Belk became mayor of Charlotte for two four-year terms. He was credited with assisting the passage of
a $55 million airport bond issue in 1978, setting the stage for the growth of Charlotte/Douglas International Airport.

Belk is a member of the board of directors of PMC, Inc., a director emeritus of Wachovia Corporation, and a
former director of Quantum Chemical Corporation, Texas Industries, Inc., Lowe’s Companies, Inc., and Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated, Inc.

Belk is also a member and former president of the Charlotte Chamber of Commerce, a longtime member and former president
of the Presbyterian Hospital Foundation, and a member and former director of the Charlotte World Affairs Council.

Due to his many accomplishments, Belk was named a laureate of the 2000 North Carolina Business Hall of Fame.

Thomas M. “Tim” Belk Jr., John Belk’s successor and nephew, will become chairman and CEO of Belk, Inc., effective May
26, 2004.

The Katherine and Tom Belk Visual Arts Center bears the name of Tim Belk’s late father and mother, who both
served on the Davidson Board of Trustees during the 1970s and 1980s. John M. Belk and Katie Belk Morris, Tim
Belk’s sister, currently serve on the Board of Trustees. Katie Belk is Director of the Katherine and Thomas M. Belk
Foundation, also named for and established by her parents.

The Belk Foundation, established in 1928 by Belk Inc., is one of the other major foundations created by the Belk
family. Under the direction of Chairman John M. Belk, the foundation contributed 1 million dollars to the Baker Sports Complex
and named the 5,743-seat basketball arena.

While Belk’s accomplishments merit a retirement, said President Bobby Vagt, the city of Charlotte will be losing a true civic
leader.

“If anyone deserves an opportunity to slow down, he [John Belk] deserves it,” Vagt ’69 said. “But he won’t slow
down. He was not born to be idle.”
