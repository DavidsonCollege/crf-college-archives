ALUMNI NEWS

GRADUATES OF 1928 CONTINUE TO STUDY IN OTHER COLLEGES

Over Thirty-Seven Per Cent of Class Have Enrolled Elsewhere

MANY TREK NORTHWARD

Ten Go to Harvard and Several to Three More Institutions Above Mason-Dixon Line — Twelve Schools Represented

Forty-seven of the 126 students who graduated from Davidson College last May, or 37 per cent of the membership, are
continuing their studies in a dozen or more institutions, according to a tentative survey made by Ernest Milton, alumni secretary,
and announced here last week. This report has led to the belief that more Davidson students are continuing their studies
after graduation than ever before, for it was stated by the secretary that a number of other graduates were teaching
a year prior to further educational preparation.

The report showed an unusual exodus of Davidson graduates to northern institutions. Ten 1928 men have enrolled at Harvard, principally
in the business and medical departments, and others will attend Columbia University, George Washington and the University of Pennsylvania.

Southern institutions in which Davidson is represented by last year’s graduates are the University of North Carolina, Vanderbilt University, University
of Virginia, Emory University, Medical College of Virginia, University of Georgia and Union and Columbia Seminaries. When the survey is
completed, it is thought that other colleges and universities will be added to this list.

The Secretary stated that besides the 12 institutions mentioned above he knew offhand that other Davidson graduates are studying at
Yale, Boston Tech, New York University, Princeton, University of Arkansas, Jefferson Medical College, University of Maryland, Johns Hopkins University—both medical
and academic—University of Alabama, Duke University, N. C. State College and Louisville Theological Seminary, which gives Davidson representation in 25
different institutions.

GREENVILLE ALUMNI NEXT FRIDAY NIGHT

First Local Alumni Gathering of Fall Season—Lively Meeting Expected

The first local alumni meeting is scheduled to be held at Greenville, S. C., Friday night, September 28th, when alumni
in that city and surrounding section will meet at a banquet to be given in the Woodside Grill at 7:30
o'clock. Approximately 75 Davidson alumni reside in that immediate section.

This meeting has been arranged on the night preceding the Clemson-Davidson football clash on Saturday, and for that reason the
gathering is expected to be particularly lively and peppy. Former Davidson students residing in Greenville, Greer, Easley, Fountain Inn, Pelzer,
Clemson College, Pickens and Traveler’s Rest have all been extended invitations—both by officers of the Greenville association and the alumni
office here.

In the temporary absence of the president, Mr. F. K. Spratt, ’04, the preliminary arrangements have been in charge of
the vice-president, Mr. John I. Smith, ’24. Mr. Spratt is expected to be in Greenville for the meeting and will
preside. Rev. E. P. Davis, D.D., ’73, is secretary-treasurer of that organization. Ernest Milton, alumni secretary, will attend.

ing rules: Do not talk to any man who is a member of a fraternity that is bidding you until
the period of silence is over. This does not include talking over the situation with some other fraternity man or
with some non-fraternity man.

The program for Friday night will be: After 7:00 o'clock, beginning at that hour and continuing at half an hour
intervals, representatives from each bidding fraternity will talk to the man. After each has had his interview or interviews he
will be allowed at least half an hour to consider the bid or bids and then if he is desirous
of joining any of the inviting fraternities he should go to the house of that fraternity and inform them that
he accepts their bid. After a reasonable time has passed there will follow a custom that is peculiar to the
Davidson campus. Men from each fraternity will visit around to meet the pledges of the other fraternities. This has been
the custom ever since the fraternities have been on the campus. This is done in a spirit of friendliness and
also in what might be called a spirit of curiosity to see the men and to meet them.

The local fraternities, although not bound by the Pan-Hellenic ruling, have been accustomed in the past to accept the Bid-day
and period of silence will be observed by the locals, and their bids will be mailed along with the national
fraternity bids.

Rushing season for the fraternities this year is much shorter than it has ever been at Davidson. Formerly the season
extended until just before the Christmas holidays. For the four years the season has been cut down gradually until it
has reached its present shortness. Four years ago bid-day was around the middle of December, three years ago it came
on the 5th of November, last year it was during the last of October, and this year it has been
put in the last of September, September 28, making an open season of exactly two weeks from the time that
school opens. In thus reducing the length of the season Davidson is falling into line with many of the universities,
most of whom have seasons lasting about a week. This gradual change has been made not from a sense of
following larger schools, but from the belief that a shorter season is not as hard on the studies of the
Freshman or the upper-classman. It is the belief of many of the observers of the fraternity world that the season

Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming. Further information and application blanks can be obtained here
at Be will remain where it is. They feel that any time shorter than two weeks will not enable the
Freshman to know the men in the fraternities nor will it allow men rushing to know the Freshman. Another argument
that is used is that with such a short season the rushing is very heated and that with a shorter
season too much of a cut-throat competition would enter.

Distinguished Service ASSOCIATION MEETS Cross Recently Awarded to Henry F. Martin, ’25 War Department Recognized Him Ten Years After War
Ended IS JACKSONVILLE LAWYER On Two Separate Occasions He Displayed Great Courage Under Heavy Fire From Guns of the Enemy

An unusual incident which attracted nation-wide attention was the recent award of the Distinguished Service Cross to Mr. Henry C.
Martin, ’15, of Jacksonville, Fla. It was unusual in the fact that this recognition was made ten years after the
cessation of hostilities. The war department’s first announcement was made July 31, and since that time the medal has been
officially presented with appropriate ceremonies at Jacksonville. In commenting upon this honor, The Jacksonville (Fla.) Journal stated the dispatch from
Washington said: “The war department’s award was given for bravery when Mr. Martin, then a second lieutenant in the 47th
Infantry, near Bazouches, France, August 7-9, 1918, was ordered with his platoon to cross the Vesle river and, finding no
bridge, he swam the river under heavy fire, stretched ropes and improvised a pontoon structure for his platoon to cross.
He also rescued two of his men who were endangered by the swift current while crossing. Two days later, when
his company commander was wounded, he placed himself at the head of the most exposed unit and led it forward
in a determined attack on Bazouches.”

Regarding Mr. Martin’s service, the Davidson College War Record said: “He enlisted April 6, 1917, and was appointed second lieutenant
in the regular army, October 26, 1917. Completed course at Army Service Schools, Fort Leavenworth, Kans. Company G, 47th Infantry,
4th Division; France, in May, 1918. During the second battle of the Marne he was promoted to temporary captaincy in
the Argonne offensive. Wounded on October 12, 1918. Rejoined his regiment in Remagen, Germany. Arrived in United States August 2,
1919. Retired for wounds, March, 1921. Battles: Second battle of the Marne, Vesle River, San Mihiel, and Meuse Argonne. Cited
in general orders for personal gallantry.”

Mr. Martin has been a resident of Jacksonville for several years and is known as one of the most able
and popular members of the Duval bar. He is connected with the firm of Cooper, Knight, Adair, Cooper, and Osborne.
