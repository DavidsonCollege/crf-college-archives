### BACK HOME

Home-coming Day, Saturday of this week, has been set aside by the college as a day of joy and celebration.
The Wildcats will encounter the fast team of State College, and Richardson Field promises to be the scene of as
hard a fight as that witnessed last year when the Tar Heels from Carolina were met. This is the day
of all days in the year when old friends of other days will be met and oft-told tales glowingly related
again. Undergraduate spirit will be enlivened by the host of loyal alumni who at least once during the course of
the year travel back to the scene of their college days. All will join hands and hearts in making this
day one of celebration and long to be remembered. It will be Home-coming Day, Davidson College Day, and three or
four more days all rolled into one big span of twenty-four hours, packed and crammed with enough excitement to last
anyone for months to come. There will be hundreds of alumni, hundreds of visitors and many beautiful girls who will
lend to the staid campus a touch of color such as is rarely seen hereabouts. Fun, frolic and frivolity for
everyone.

Under the tutorage of Younger and Tilson, the Davidson Wildcats have arisen from the ranks of mediocrity and now have
an enviable position in football circles. In every game that has been fought they have given a good account of
themselves. Furman's purple hurricane defeated the thin red line of Davidsonians last Saturday but not after the stiffest kind of
fighting and scrapping. We made a good record last year and we intend to do so this season.

But more than the actual scores of the games is the splendid spirit that has been instilled into the players
and the students of the college by the principles of fairness and good sportsmanship that have been adhered to. Everyone
knows that the name of Davidson is synonymous with that of sportsmanship; the students feel a just pride in the
teams and the alumni are proud of the fact that they ever went to Davidson.

The Davidsonian welcomes back you, men of Davidson, and sons worthy of her fair name. It is you who have
stood by the college on all occasions and have been instrumental in the upbuilding of physical and spiritual well-being. Every
loyal son of old Davidson is given a hearty welcome and greeting back to the campus. This is your day
and it is our wish that you will enjoy it to the utmost. You may have felt that time has
dealt harshly with you in some respects, but remember that the cheery greeting that once met you upon your arrival
on this campus is still evident. The same high principles which obtained in your student days yet lift our thoughts
to higher and nobler endeavor. Your team, the little bunch of scarlet-jerseyed youngsters with the fighting hearts, will not fail
you. Our team may have the score piled upon them but they will never lose courage, nor show a whit
less fight than they had at the first of the game. So, welcome home, loyal alumni and friends of Davidson.
A program has been prepared for you which we hope will meet with your approval. And we sincerely hope that
the spirit you observe here, the game, and the students themselves will make you only more glad that you are
a true son of the Red and Black.

### HALLOWE'EN

Boys will be boys, girls will be girls, and young people will continue to cherish those delightful fancies of childhood
days as long as imagination bodies forth the shapes of things unknown. The eve of All Hallows Day is the
time set apart for the spooks and witches to ride, for mysterious beings to return to earth for a few
short hours before being dispelled by the dawn. Hallowe'en is the witching hour of the whole year. It is the
time when jaded nerves and tired minds can find relaxation in imagination and freedom from the humdrum affairs of daily
life. The elfin sprite of the unknown beckons to young and old to follow her flitsome footsteps.

Some say that the ancient, long-robed druids were founders of the spirit of Hallowe'en; that their mysterious cult, their weird
chants and incantations, make up some of the mystery that we hear when this night comes again. Certainly, those pagan
ideas find expression in the strange garbs of divers sorts that we see in the Hallowe'en festivals and carnivals. From
the dim past has emerged this traditional celebration. It comes at the close of the harvest season when spirits are
at the highest. It is the time of the harvest home and of general good will. Who is there who
does not recall the dark and weird shadows of Hallowe'en? Such fantastic shapes as appeared in dark corners. Even the
carved pumpkin on the gate-post appeared a giant ogre from the lands of dreams. We sought the bright lights when
the witches rode across the sky on brooms and the spooks were unleashed from countless tombs.

It is the everlasting spirit of youth and of imagination that makes us love this season of the year. When
imagination dies out, the spirit lacks also. When the soul is gone the man is dead. We cannot keep too
much of this youthful spirit that makes one see a ghostly man-of-war in a scudding cloud.

### THE WORLD COURT

On December 17th, there will be brought up before the Senate a most momentous question, one that involves the safety
and security of every nation in the world. The question at issue is whether the United States will cast her
lot with the leading countries of the civilized world in the World Court of Permanent Justice, or whether she will
continue her policy of aloofness from international affairs.

Coming as it does upon the trail of countless international negotiations of one kind and another, this question of entering
a determined concert of countries determined to effect peace by means of arbitration rather than resort to war, is one
that concerns every individual in this country. It especially concerns the college man for he is the big business man,
the financier, the statesman, and the plain citizen of tomorrow. If he is to compose that upper stratum of leadership
in affairs of the future, he should know something about and should form some ideas as to the advisability of
entering this court.

This world court is a direct outgrowth of the ideas of the late Woodrow Wilson. His proposed plan for this
country to enter the League of Nations was downed, partly because partisan politics played a large part in its defeat,
and also because the people...Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

of the United States were not fully awake to the seriousness of the situation. War seemed too remote to cause
such a commotion. Today this court has a membership in excess of forty members, most of them being members of
the League. The personnel of the body is composed of eminent jurists and recognized authorities on all points of international
law. John Basset Moore, a citizen of the United States, is a member of the court. The work of the
court has been the untangling of various snarls that have arisen from the late conflict of nations. It has followed
up the work done by the two Hague Conferences which were so heartily endorsed by the United States. President Harding,
in the last days of his life, tried to have this measure passed so that the United States would not
be branded as an outlaw of nations, and so she could intelligently act in all affairs pertaining to international security.
Students of Davidson and of other colleges are being asked by the association of colleges and the Y. M. C.
A. to co-operate with those who have this issue vitally at heart so that this question will be decided upon
favorably by the Senate. No Davidson student will go wrong by making a deep study as to the merits and
the outcome of this most important question.

ADDITIONS TO THE LIBRARY

About 150 volumes of works by French authors have recently reached the Library and are now being catalogued. Members of
the faculty and of the student body are invited to examine these works. A year ago we requested the literary
editor of the great publishing house of Hachette & Co., Paris, to prepare us a list of several of the
best works of each of the leading French authors of the 19th century, including both prose and verse. We studied
this list carefully during the past year, revised it with the aid of certain French scholars both in this country
and in France, supplemented it, selected good editions, and had the works bound under our personal supervision during the past
summer while in Paris. Bibliographies given us by two professors in the University of Paris aided us in selecting a
small working library in the field of French literary and linguistic history. For the first time the Library is now
equipped with sufficient books to enable us to offer satisfactory courses in the history of the French language from the
earliest times, as well as the history of the literature of France from the earliest times. Attention is called to
such works as Petit de Juleville and Bedier-Hazard, whose epoch-making works on the history of the language and literature are
sought by French scholars everywhere. The famous illustrated weekly, “L’Illustration,” is on file in the reading-room where it is enjoyed
by large numbers of students.

READ THIS AND WEEP

On October 20th, the Woman's Auxiliary of the North Carolina Synod began its 13th annual session at the First Presbyterian
Church in Greensboro. At this meeting the fact was brought before the assembly that there is not a Presbyterian institution
in the Synod at which young women may pursue post-graduate work, while at Davidson men who desire to take an
M. A. degree or do post-graduate work are able to do so under very profitable conditions, as the college offers
such courses in any subject that is offered to undergraduates. There is also an adequate library on the campus which
contains all material needed for reference. A motion was made and passed by the Auxiliary which provides for a recommendation
to the trustees of Davidson College, asking them to allow women to take up post-graduate work here. If this recommendation
is granted by the trustees it will necessitate the building of a dormitory for the women students, besides incurring other
large expenses upon the college, when it seems that the same plans could be much better carried out if done
at a female institution where such changes would not necessitate such a large expense upon the institution. For instance, if
this course were offered at one of our Presbyterian women’s colleges no new building would have to be erected to
care for the students, and they would be able to do better work in a woman’s college than they would
here. While the Davidson students do not wish to appear selfish or unaccommodating, those with whom the writer has talked
believe that it would not be beneficial to the college to admit women students, for if the students here have
many more distractions to keep them from their studies there will be a home-going day established right after the first
semester each year that will vie with Home-coming day in the fall.

MUSING

Deep in thine eyes mine own can read
Of fairer beauties than reside
Within a dreamy Iris heart
Or in the picture of a pool,
Charmed with the glory of the skies
And autumn leaves and colored sun
That show their likeness in the crystal depths
When the long day is done.
O that I could but tell, dear heart,
The sacred message that they bear
Only the sweep of fragrant winds
Only the silence of the stars
Or some strange scene that memory bears,
Can tell the mystery of those eyes of thine,
The joy of open seas and summer skies, and O
That those eyes were mine!

—JAMES HENLY CALLIGAN.

DAVIDSON (he timidly fingers her delicate lily white hand)—Yes, the value of Greek in the college curriculum can hardly be
over-estimated.
DAVIDSON (caressingly closing his manly arm around her)—Something over two thousand pieces of mail a day are received at our
post office.
QUEENS (leaning on his shoulder)—Wallace Beery is my favorite movie sheik.
DAVIDSON (sipping sweet nectar from her saccharine lips)—The consumption of Coco-Cola has increased alarmingly among the younger generation. And too,
I hear that Einstein’s theory has been disproved.
QUEENS (rapturously embracing him)—Paris says that skirts will be three inches shorter this winter.
BOTH (wandering off to see the Wildcat)—The new model Ford has found a welcome reception among the intelligentsia of the
country.

Stewed Stude—Roland, let’s go co-edding tonight.
Roland Parker—Can’t go. Got a sore arm.

CAN YOU?

He—Can you read lips?
She—Only by the touch system.

Be it ever so dumb belle, there’s no girl like my own.

For Freshman McMeans.

While down at Queens.

VANDERBILT TRIP BUSTS DR. CHASE and GRAIL DANCE IN BYNUM HALL TONITE

By the official count of our own statistician, the headline, WALTER JOHNSTON MAKES PIRATES WALK THE PLANK, was thought of
by 3.546 sports writers.

A slippery young fellow was Sutter,
A slippery young fellow was Stutter,
He beheld a horse-fly in the butter;
When he tried to look in
He got mired to his chin
“Well, I g-got him,” was all he could stutter.

HOT AIR

Our idea of natural gas is a duel of words between a hole-in-one golfer and a five-tube radiologist, with a
