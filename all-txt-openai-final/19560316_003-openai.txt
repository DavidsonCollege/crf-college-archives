DOC WHITE NAMED WILDCAT OF WEEK

Lead Rush For Athletic Trophy

By CHARLES McGOWAN

With the athletic front on the IFC level into the spring sports (volleyball, ping pong, tennis, and softball), the Kappa
Sigs are well on their way toward retaining the coveted athletic point trophy.

Every student at Davidson who is familiar with the Athletic Department is familiar with the face of Doc White, the
equipment manager, because he is a part of the history of the school in a way which can hardly be
forgotten. When the war began, Doc came to Davidson as equipment manager in 1933 and since that time he has
grown to be ably one of the most enthusiastic baseball fans in the state and he knows every aspect of
the game in which the Cats participate. Besides being a local fan, Doc is probably one of the most enthusiastic

received a bitter disappointment last Monday night as they heard N. C. State's highly-touted Wolfpack go down to defeat in
the NCAA regional tournament in New York. The lone Carolinas representative to the national meet, State ran up against an
old jinx which again proved to be too great. The Wolfpack has never shown their usual form when they play
in Madison Square Garden, and they have never won in NCAA competition held in the Garden. This time, an unheralded
Canisius team from New York bounced the Wolfpack, and the Garden jinx held again as State turned in a so-so
performance which was far below their usual norm. The lone bright spot was All-American Ronnie Shavlik who proved himself a
real All-American as he poured in 25 points despite a broken wrist.

After receiving his degree in 1938 he retained his job and in the middle of the 1939 season was promoted
to the head of the varsity squad, a position he has held to this day with the exception of a
few years spent in military service and graduate work. A large proportion of his wrestlers have come to Davidson with
no previous experience since the college offers no scholarships in the sport. Therefore “Coach's” job has been largely one of
building teams rather than improving them. Jimmy Jung, a Chinese student and one of the Cat's greatest grapplers, had never
seen a match before coming to the college. Other “greats” who have been under the tutelage of Coach Parker are
Howard McFadden, Gene Craven, Johnny Buxton, and Dave Spenser, who has recently coached McCallie Prep to two Mid South Championships.
Coach Parker is well known to Wildcat athletes of all sports for he also heads the Department of Cuts, Bruises
and Sprains. Whether it’s a charlie-horse or a broken nose, they know to seek out Trainer Parker who can cure
just about anything.

Jayvee Baseball Schedule Listed

A Jayvee squad will be organized principally for Freshmen and Sophomores with limited experience. Their schedule begins March 21 against
Mooresville High. The rest of the schedule is as follows:
Mar. 23—Boyden of Salisbury there
Mar. 26—East Mecklenburg here
Apr. 4—North Mecklenburg here
Apr. 7—East Mecklenburg here
Apr. 13—Harding of Charlotte here
Apr. 19—Myers Park here
May 2—Harding there

Coach Clements urges all who are interested to try out for the Jayvee squad.

GOLF ACTION OPENS TUESDAY

The Davidson Linksters were halted by rain and schedule difficulties in their proposed match with Rollins of Florida yesterday. They
do plan to get the season’s activities underway next Tuesday afternoon when they meet the N. C. State aggregation. Next
Friday will find them traveling to Furman to match shots with a squad which they split with last season in
two encounters. This will constitute their first Conference opposition. Led by Skipper Hall, Larry Parrott, George Scott from last year’s
team, and supported by the likes of Tom Johnsen, Sam Sloan, and Bill Purks from the yearling class, some indication
of the prowess of this team ought to be gained from the matches.

Tennis Team Opens Friday at Wofford

When the Davidson netmen travel to Spartanburg, S.C. Friday to meet Wofford, it will mark the beginning of a new
era in Davidson tennis. With only one (1) letterman returning, John Robinson, the ‘Cats will have a hard row to
hoe, facing some of the top teams in the country. Coach McKee says however, that the team should perform better
as the season progresses and the players become more experienced. He also has high expectations of keeping the Conference Title
but expects tough competition from W&M and Richmond. Coach McKee has not decided who will play what position yet but
says that Robinson, Dave Pearshall, Semi Mintz, and Bob Huffaker will definitely make the trips to Wofford and Furman, whom
the 'Cats play on Saturday. Wofford has three (3) returning lettermen, headed by Dale Warner, from Asheville, N.C., and should
be fairly strong, but Davidson will give them a good match.
