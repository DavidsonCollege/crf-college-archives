Sports - Cats beat UNC-A, but fall to Winthrop and Wake in baseball

By JOE HOOVER

Davidson travelled to Winthrop College on Tuesday (March 14) for their first road trip of 1989, only to drop an 8-5 decision. Winthrop scored four runs in the first three innings. The Wildcats pulled within one on a solo home run by Mikio Aoki in the second, a triple by Mike Liebdzinski followed by Ron Krnacik’s sacrifice fly in the third, and in the fourth, Ralph Isernia led off with a base hit, moving to second on Aoki’s single. After two outs, Tim Kerns walked to load the bases. Mark Weir was hit by a pitch, forcing in Isernia, but the ‘Cats couldn’t continue to capitalize as they left the bases loaded when a pop fly ended the inning.

Down 5-3 entering the eighth, Davidson used four hits to score two runs and tie the game. Isernia got his second hit of the day, but was retired on Steve Livesey’s fielder’s choice. Joe Azzolino followed with a base hit, and then hampered by a leg injury, pinch hit for Kerns, delivering an RBI double. Weir's single plated Azzolino but John Woodall, running for Holland, was thrown out trying to score on the play.

After entering in the seventh to get the third out by registering a strikeout with the bases loaded, ‘Cats’ reliever Phil Magaldi was touched for three runs on three hits in the eighth to absorb the loss. Davidson was retired on three consecutive strikeouts in the ninth to end the game. Aoki and Isernia had two hits to lead the Wildcat effort.

Davidson (4-3) pulled out the big sticks the next day as they collected twelve hits in routing UNC-Asheville (4-12), 11-3. Azzolino and Weir hit two home runs apiece, all to the opposite field, to lead the ‘Cat attack. The Wildcats jumped on top from the start on Azzolino’s three-run blast in the first. Weir hit his first, a two-run shot, in the fourth to give Davidson a 5-0 lead. The Wildcats exploded for five more runs in the fifth. Aoki started a string of five consecutive hits with a single. Azzolino and Livesey followed with base hits to load the bases. Aoki scored when Bulldog pitcher Joel Perkins balked before Weir unloaded his second homer, a three-run blast. George Halter followed with a single to right, advanced on a ground out and a wild pitch, and scored on Ron Krnacik’s sacrifice fly. Not to be outdone by Weir, Azzolino rocketed a solo bomb in the sixth that smacked the scoreboard (some 400 feet from home plate) in right field, a feat rarely done at Wildcat Park.

Meanwhile, starter David Williams was cruising with a three-hitter until he ran out of gas in the seventh. The Bulldogs scored on Brian Lancaster’s two-run, opposite field homer. Jay Harris and Brad Wanzenberg came on to finish up. For the day, Azzolino had three hits and four RBIs, and Krnacik, Aoki, and Weir (5 RBIs) chipped in two apiece.

Davidson fell to Wake Forest, 4-2, on Thursday. Chris Phillips, Larry Colbourne, and Frank Humber combined to one-hit the ‘Cats, striking out six and walking six. Davidson (4-4) starter Jeff Loser and three relievers held the Demon Deacons to only four hits, but they also walked six men, three of which scored. The Wildcats scored first. In the second, Joe Azzolino walked, stole second, moved to third on a wild pitch, and scored on the ‘Cats only hit, a two-out double by Mark Weir. In the third, Wake Forest (8-8) used two walks, two stolen bases, an RBI base hit by Warren Sawkiw and an error to take a 2-1 lead. In the fourth, Wake Forest’s Jake Austin led off with a single and stole second. Two walks loaded the bases, and Deron Weston delivered an RBI sacrifice fly to score one run. The ninth brought the Demon Deacons another insurance run on a walk, a stolen base, and an RBI single.by Mike DeFranco. The ‘Cats finished the scoring in the bottom of the ninth when Mike Holland walked, was balked to second, went to third on a passed ball, and scored on Mikio Aoki’s sacrifice fly.

NOTES: The Wildcats’ next home game is Thursday, March 30, against Mount Olive. Game time is 2 p.m. Then on Sunday, Duke University comes to Wildcat Park for a 1 p.m. contest. Make time to come out and enjoy the great game of baseball while supporting the ‘Cats. Grab your rowdy friends and bask in the sun as Davidson tries to improve their record this weekend against Mount Olive and Duke. See you there!
