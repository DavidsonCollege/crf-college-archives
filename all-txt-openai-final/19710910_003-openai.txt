### Eleven Bring Variety To Faculty

By GRAY WILSON
Managing Editor

The eleven newcomers to the Davidson faculty this fall offer a wide range of talents, including an author-aesthetician, a political
scientist, a sociologist, and a speech instructor. Dr. Bertram E. Jessup is presently finishing his latest book, *Aesthetics and Other
Human Values*. Frank William Biglow has a grant from the National Science Foundation to study the Bay of Pigs involvement
and the Cuban missile crisis. Robert D. Ruth will teach at Davidson after a summer of sociological research in New
York City. Jean S. Cornell is, among other things, the wife of Vice-President for Finance and Development C. David Cornell.

Jessup comes to Davidson with a long line of accomplishments in addition to his string of publications. An emeritus professor
from the University of Oregon, he will be a visiting Dana Professor of Literature this year for work mostly with
the honors college. Jessup taught philosophy at Oregon during 1936-67, and recently he was a visiting professor of philosophy at
the State University of New York at Albany, where he spearheaded a doctoral program in philosophy and the humanities under
a grant from the National Foundation for the Arts and Humanities. In addition to the honors program, Jessup will teach
one course per term in the English department. His office is located upstairs in the newly renovated Carolina Inn.

Jessup was born in Sweden. He graduated from Oregon with degrees in English and philosophy and received his Ph.D. in
philosophy from the University of California at Berkeley. He has also taught at the University of Washington (1956-61) and at
the University of Heidelberg, Germany, as a senior research professor (1952-53). In his seventies, short, robust, and ruddy, Jessup is
still going strong. He was past president of the Pacific Division of the American Philosophical Association, and will serve as
president of the American Society for Aesthetics in 1971-73. He will be staying with his wife Florence in the house
of Professor of English Frank W. Bliss, who is on leave in India for a year.

Biglow, an instructor in political science at UNCC, will be teaching the same subject at Davidson this year. He received
an A.B. from the University of Florida and an M.A. from the University of California at Berkeley. This past summer
he completed work on a Ph.D. at Berkeley, where he has also taught. He has lectured at the University of
California at Davis, and taught since 1967 at UNCC. Biglow has been involved in research for many years. He has
worked on studies of municipal government, American political thought, European diplomacy, and U.S. foreign policy in Latin America.

Ruth was a community research associate in New York City before he came to Davidson. He has conducted research on
minority group attitudes, meals for the aged, scholarships for youth, therapeutic nursery programs, and school decentralization. He matriculated at the
State University of New York at Buffalo in 1966 and added an M.A. degree in sociology from Duke in 1968.
He is presently a candidate for a Ph.D. from Duke University while serving as a research associate and assistant to
the director for central office administration of the Center for Community Research in New York.taught at Rutgers University, Hofstra University,
and Longwood College, Farmville, Va., on a part-time basis. His studies have been supported by funds from the National Science
Foundation, the National Defense Education Act program, and others. Jean Cornell holds an M.S. degree in journalism from Northwestern and
an M.A. in speech from the University of Arizona. She has taught at Arizona and Scripps College and until recently
was editorial coordinator for the American College Testing Program. Everett F. Jacobus Jr. is a new instructor in the French
department. He recently earned a Ph.D. from Cornell, where he was a graduate assistant for two years. The Jacobus family
is living in the Wolf house on Pine Road. Hugh S. Plunkett, anthropologist, will serve as assistant professor in the
South Asia studies program. He worked on his Ph.D. this summer at the University of California at Berkeley and has
been acting assistant professor at the University of Virginia since 1967. Benjamin G. Klein will be a new addition to
the mathematics department, serving as assistant professor. He has taught at Washington Square College, at NYU, and at Yale, where
he received his doctorate. Klein and his wife are staying in the Meeks house. Mark I. Davies has assumed the
position of assistant professor of classics. He worked on his Ph.D. at Princeton this summer and is now a school
fellow at the American School of Classical Studies in Athens, Greece. He and his wife will spend the year in
the Wruck house on Pine Road. Capt. William R. Cunningham is a new addition to the ROTC department. As assistant
professor of military science, he will handle the MS III groups. Donald L. Kimmel Jr. is an associate professor of
biology and head of the department. Jurgen Schlunk, the only single professor in the new group, will serve as assistant

### College Exchange Offered Next Semester

October 10 is the deadline for applications from those interested in participating in the college exchange program during the second
semester. Director of Instructional Development Jay H. Ostwalt reports that his office is open for any information and appropriate forms
for any student who would like to take part in the program after Christmas. Ostwalt said that he was primarily
interested in junior students, but that younger underclassmen may also apply. The new change is that the eight colleges involved
in the exchange consortium will accept students in the middle of the year despite discrepancies in the academic calendar. Only
Davidson and Washington & Lee operate on a calendar of three terms. Hampden-Sydney, Mary Baldwin, and Randolph-Macon Woman's College have
two semesters in their year, but Hollins, Randolph-Macon, and Sweet Briar have instituted the 4-1-4 program. Ostwalt said that an
adjustment could be made for a Davidson student transferring to one of the other schools operating on another academic calendar.
The adjustment would consist of an extended studies program linked with the other college semester to provide an equivalent half-year
program. Presently there are 11 co-eds from the various girlsâ€™ schools and two men from Hampden-Sydney participating in the exchange
at Davidson.
