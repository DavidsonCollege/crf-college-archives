Parents, faculty, and administrators were absent from these rooms, and the prospectives were encouraged to probe the Davidson students for honest, uncensored answers about college life.

Parents attended panel discussions with faculty, admission, and residence life staff. The day concluded with Dr. Cable’s farewell address. “This program highlights three of Davidson’s biggest assets: our beautiful campus, bright and articulate students, and dedicated faculty,” Bell said.

Junior Day is a semiannual event which will occur again in March. It is designed to introduce prospective students to Davidson early in their college searches.

This also gives admissions staff the opportunity to offer some college counseling to the prospectives instead of simply recruiting and reviewing applications. Because of their early exposure to Davidson, Bell says, many Junior Day participants end up applying early decision.

This year’s program boasted the largest turnout ever, and Bell expects March’s event to be larger still.

Along with Junior Day, the admissions office also sponsors A Day at Davidson twice each fall for high school seniors, and Decision Davidson each spring for admitted students.
