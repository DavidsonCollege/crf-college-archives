WEDNESDAY NIGHT BREAK

The usual Wednesday night break is offering something very unusual this week in the line of refreshments. Quite a treat is in store for us in the form of a watermelon cutting.

The hour of the break has been changed to 8:50, and the scene of the feast will be the campus, south of the Union. We're anticipating an enthusiastic turnout by the entire student body.

FLASH! 2?

Banned in Boston! Scourged in Philadelphia! Picketed in Phoenix City!

These are the headlines that have followed the movie that is to be shown here Friday night at 8:00 PM.

Yes, it's Please Mr. Balzac, starring the inimitable Miss Bardot. The avant-garde film committee has done it again.

LOST

Steve Bender has reported a lost ring, a round tiger's eye, in a gold mounting. He last saw the ring in the reference room of the library. A reward is being offered.

OUTLIER CHAPEL

The Chapel programs this summer have been refreshing and different. During the summer we can see a more relaxed attitude on the part of our speakers and a more receptive attitude on the part of the audience.

During the summer the speakers do not seem to feel any obligation to fill the whole period whether they have that much to say or not. Rather, those who have had little to say have said little, and those who have had something pressing on their minds have spoken out.

This has given a ring of sincerity to the summer programs that has made the trips to Chambers worthwhile.

That this feeling is not localized with this writer seems to be borne out by the fact that we have heard so few complaints about that old bugaboo compulsory chapel. There have, of course, been times when chapel has been an inconvenience, but there have been few times when one could say that he was actually bored.

A vote of thanks to those who have planned the chapels and to those who have made of them interesting experiences.
