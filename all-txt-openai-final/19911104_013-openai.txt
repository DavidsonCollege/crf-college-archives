Women's Soccer Enters

Southeastern Regional Rankings

By B'easy Helms

The Davidson women’s soccer team moved into the Southeast Division I Region rankings a week ago at 10th. They moved
their record up to 9-6-1 this week as they ended a long stretch of games. The 'Cats first dominated an
inferior Erskine team, winning the game 4-1. Ellen Sprinkle led the scoring for the team with two goals, one of
them assisted by Anne Wampler. Susan Taylor also scored, assisted by Ann Todd. Liz Clarke scored the last goal, assisted
by Ellen Sprinkle and Susan Taylor.

On Saturday, they stayed on the road to play Mercer University, ranked 9th in the South. The game was extremely
close, with Liz Clarke scoring the lone Wildcat goal unassisted. With less than two minutes left in regulation time, the
Bulldogs tied the score and sent the game into double overtime. A tired Wildcat team allowed two goals in the
closing minutes of overtime after hanging tough with the Bulldogs for most of the game, making the score 3-1.

At home on Wednesday, the Wildcats stomped the Blue Hose from Presbyterian College. In the first half, Sally Graham scored
her first two goals, the first assisted by Liz Clarke. The third goal was scored by Sarah Cantrell, from a
cross by Clarke. Jenny Satterfield scored the last goal on a penalty kick. The Blue Hose had one goal, an
own goal (knocked in by a Davidson player) that made the score 4-1.

Visiting Liberty University struggled Saturday, as the Wildcats won their homecoming game 5-0. The Flames proved to be no match
for the 'Cats, and allowed two goals in the first 10 minutes. Clarke assisted Cantrell’s goal on a two-on-keeper. Clarke
then scored two goals, and Graham also scored. The last goal was assisted by Clarke as one of the Liberty
players put the ball in the back of the net.

The Wildcats stayed with Radford on Wednesday despite giving up an early goal. Sarah Cantrell scored to tie the game
1-1 with a beautiful shot. The Highlanders, top-ranked in the Big South, came back to score twice and won the
game 3-1. Davidson closed out its season Saturday night under the lights at Richardson Field with a 1-0 victory over
Queens.

With their ten wins, the Wildcats surpassed the previous team record of seven wins, set by last year’s team. Coach
Kevin Hundley has been extremely pleased with the team’s progress this season, and hopes the young squad can continue to
improve next year.
