THE DAVIDSONIAN WEDNESDAY April 21, 2004 ARTS

By way of introduction: LIVING Davidson’s latest spring fashion

This week, the Arts and Living section devotes two pages to fashion. Now A&L must justify its decision to highlight the most superficial, materialistic, and malleable aspect of our daily lives. Why think about clothes when there’s Virgil or Foucault? Simply put, most Davidson students prefer reading about the trivial (say, fashion) to an obscure dance troupe or manifesto on semiotics.

Fashion is something that is ever-changing and easy to discuss. How many times have you wondered why another student decided to wear something unconventional or just plain ugly? Clothing is obvious. While serving its purpose, a tee shirt or pants define its exhibitor.

Fashion, clothes, dress, and style describe a set of symbols that, at a place like Davidson, relay information about economic status, social status, and personality. Even the lack of clothes is a signifier: remember those students who walked around with no shoes? In the symbolic sense, a Louis Vuitton purse isn’t just a purse, and by the same reasoning, a nondescript purse isn’t just a purse. A Red Sox hat is not a Yankees hat, and a Sox hat worn to the side is a very different thing than one worn straight. And when there’s a hat when there’s no sun, the hat isn’t a hat at all: it’s pure symbol.

Baseball caps show that an unavoidable tension exists between function and symbol, and it’s with this tension in mind that A&L hopes that you read this week’s section. Yes, fashion is—in an ideal world—trivial, but until we are all in uniforms, we should celebrate our freedom to dress and dress well.

Trends we see:
- Burberry: scarves, umbrellas, purses, baseball caps, quilted jackets; everything.
- Coach: purses.
- Croakies: Obviously, your sunglasses are going to fall off on your way to the library.
- Fake Vintage Tees: The real thing’s cheaper, and New Jersey isn’t for lovers.
- Gray New Balances: They go with everything!
- Jelly Bags: At least these Jellies aren’t on the feet.
- Little Louis Bags: Who knew that an accessories pouch could be so popular?
- Short, Pleated Skirts: Tennis anyone?
- Uggs: Wool-lined boots to keep you warm during those cold Spring nights.

Trends to be:
- A.C. Slater Jeans: Stone-washed preferred.
- Costume Jewelry and Dainty Church Gloves: Not just for dress-up or Grandmoms.
- I.D. Bracelets: More individual than new Tiffany’s charm.
- Keds: White, lace-less, and canvas.
- Short-Shorts: For boys or girls, they’re still hot. Especially on boys.
- Speedos: Eurotrash is in.
- Vintage: But real.
- Wellies: The new Uggs.

Arts & LIVING FASHION IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY AN UNDERGROUND SLEW OF FASHIONISTAS WHO JUST HAPPEN TO HAVE MORE STYLE THAN YOU DO.

Boys & girls: classic closet essentials

It is so easy to become trapped in fashion’s sphere of mediocrity. At some point during freshman year, the alarm clock snooze button becomes a familiar friend and the idea of trying to look presentable becomes a lost art. We’ve come up with essential items that are classic cool and necessary for every closet. Boys and girls: read carefully, take notes, and paste this up on your closet door because Arts & Living has organized what every college student must have in their wardrobe.

Ladies:
1.) Silk Scarf — This is a good item because of its versatility. You can wear it in your hair, around your waist or neck, or you can tie it to your purse. Get a simple pattern so that it isn’t easily remembered. Where to get it? Stein Mart: 704-895-8477.
2.) Little Black Dress — It all started with “Breakfast at Tiffany’s”... The little black dress is the perfect flirty item to wear at night or even during class. For a more casual look, wear your dress with a jean jacket and flip-flops; if you care to dress it up, don a pair of sassy heels. We suggest Anthropologie’s Jersey Drape Dress ($98) because it flatters any figure and does so without revealing too much skin. The price is justified by the number of times that you'll wear it. www.anthropologie.com or 800-309-2500.
3.) Sassy Stilettos — Who ever thought that platform clunkers flattered any leg? Today’s popular stilettos range from a sweet kitten heel to hotFMTs. Isaac Mizrahi’s Michelle Ring Sandals can be worn with jeans or dresses and won’t empty your pocketbook. Where to get it? Target: $19.99, 704-896-1813.

4.) Nice Dark Jeans - This is yet another splurge, but it is something that you will wear every day. The fashion world now is leaning toward a higher-waisted jean that flatters the hip and elongates the leg. The best fitting jeans are Earl Jeans, Seven for All Mankind, Express, and Miss Sixty. Where to get it? Luna’s, 704-892-1004; Kohl’s, 704-896-1020; or T.J.Maxx, 704-799-3757.

5.) Vintage Jewelry - Whether found in your great-aunt’s drawer or at a flea market, vintage jewelry works well with casual or formal wear. Earrings are the most versatile, but anything works well. Where to get it? Oak Street Mill, 19725 Oak Street, Cornelius; 704-895-2653.

It all started with a “Breakfast at Tiffany’s”... The Little Black Dress —

Gentlemen:

1.) Jeans that fit - This means pants that don’t stop an inch above your ankle. It also means pants that don’t look like I could survive jumping out of a plane by holding on to them. Go for “dirty” washes and dark colors to avoid the sandblasted look of the 80s. Look for styles like “standard fit” or “low rise boot fit.” Avoid “loose fit,” which really just means ill-fitting. This may be one of your most expensive essentials, but that’s okay because you will wear them over and over again. Where to get it? Diesel Jeans www.diesel.com or The Gap, 704-896-2328.

2.) Black or gray pants - They aren’t just for girls: black pants are instantly dressy and suitable either for work or for going out on the weekends. Buy one pair that fit well and you’ll instantly multiply the possible combinations in your wardrobe. Where to get it? Banana Republic or Saks Off Fifth.

3.) Polo shirts in unexpected colors - There are so many polo shirts on campus it seems like they multiply on their own. To stand out from the preppy crowd, go for shirts in unexpected colors. Pink is a favorite with girls and boys who are confident in their sexuality. Try yellow for a cheery spring look. Avoid orange unless you are bold and don’t have red tones in your face. If you must have green, go for lime green and avoid all dark colors. Where to get it? Syms, 704-532-0018.

4.) Shoes that aren’t dressy - You shouldn’t be going anywhere but the gym in the shoes you work out in. Look for fashion sneakers like Sketchers or Steve Maddens—you can get them for cheap at discount stores like Payless. If you want to show off your manly feet, go for leather sandals. Avoid Birkenstocks and make sure you clip your toenails. Where to get it? Rack Room Shoes.

5.) A tie that stands out - When you graduate, you'll be interviewing for jobs. You want something that’s going to set you apart from the crowd and make you feel confident. Look for brightly colored or stylishly patterned ties that can make you unforgettable. Where to get it? Banana Republic or Brooks Brothers Factory Store.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

1.) Old-School Flip-flops — Remember when simple rubber flip-flops were cheap? Old-school flip-flops are the perfect spring/summer item to wear to class, the Lake Campus, or out on the Court. We like Target’s Mossimo Rubber Thongs that come in bright citrus colors and sell for about $5, or Food Lion offers a cheaper, more traditional style for about $3.

2.) White Oxford Shirt — A button-down shirt is good because you can either dress it up by tucking it into a pair of slacks or dress it down by leaving it loose with jeans. We especially like the jeans look on girls if a feminine camisole (found at the Gap for $6) is worn underneath the Oxford. A very classic, very sexy look when you wear it with nice dark jeans and roll up the sleeves. Don’t spill anything on it. Where to get it? $29.99 at Syms: 704-532-0018, 3600 N. Sharon Amity Road, Charlotte.

3.) Old, Old tee-shirts — So comfy that they feel like an old one-dollar bill. Should fit well and not be purchased from a trendy retail store. Wear with dark jeans, leather skirt, or old corduroy pants. Where to get it? Value Village, the Goodwill, or your father’s closet.
