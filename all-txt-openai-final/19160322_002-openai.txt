COMMENCEMENT PREPARATIONS.

All around us we see the effect of the forces which are building for a successful and memorable Commencement. Many classes have signified their intention of being present and many individual members—more than usual, have written that they are going to be back on the Hill again the last days of May. Every sign would seem to point to the fact that this event will mark the beginning of a new era in Davidson history, when the interest of the alumni will be more marked than in former days.

Not a stone is being left unturned to bring to an early completion the endowment campaign for the additional hundred thousand dollars. As we know, one-fourth of this sum will go at once into the Alumni Gymnasium—the first concrete testimonial in an organized way on our campus of the loyalty of the men who have learned to love the old College. Proceeds from the remainder of the endowment will go to build up the efficiency of the institution, which is now crowded to the doors. The point has been reached where the numbers will be increased only in proportion to the additional resources provided.

This Commencement coming at the end of a campaign which has been primarily among the Alumni and which, in many cases, has brought to mind forgotten memories of the College, should be exceptional in the attendance and interest of classes planning reunions this year. With these facts before us and constantly in our minds, everyone should lend every effort to see that this Commencement is not only in itself enjoyable, but that it is memorable, in that it is marked with the spirit of constructive work, and a vision of the possibilities of Davidson.

To make this true, preparation is necessary, and every friend of the College should begin today to plan for this, the closing event of the year, which, as the name signifies, should not be an ending but a Commencement of a Greater Davidson.

WEEKLY MEETINGS.

The meetings of the Eumenean Literary Society last week were not quite up to standard. There was, however, very good attendance and attention for this season. On Saturday night the subject, "Resolved, That Congress should pass a bill warning Americans from armed vessels," was debated. The affirmative was upheld by T. J. Mitchell, Potts, Cousar,and J. P. Williams, whose arguments centered around the point that a few “speculators” would thus not jeopardize the whole nation. On the negative, J. B. Woods, Morton, W. G. Morrison, and Boggs contended that such a bill would lower America’s national pride. As a whole, the debate was weak, few good points being brought out, and many left untouched. The usual fire and spirit were lacking. The decision was awarded to the affirmative.

The Monday meeting was better. W. Y. Sayad gave an oration on the same subject that was debated Saturday night, stressing some of the untouched points. P. B. Price spoke on the means of improving the Social Center, suggesting a few remedies. L. A. Mullen gave a description of a visit to the Grand Canyon. Four very good declamations were rendered by McCloy, Brand, Fraser, and Frierson.

The negative side of the query: “Resolved, That the United States should warn passengers not to travel on belligerent merchant ships armed for defense,” by a 2 to 1 vote, won the decision in the Saturday night debate of the Philanthropic Society. The less experienced debaters showed fair preparation, while those who were expected to make good debates showed more miserly preparation. J. D. McLeod, for the affirmative, and D. Shaw, the latter appointed on, argued well the fundamental issues of the query.

On Monday morning, R. B. Peters and S. M. Davis gave fair declamations. J. H. Carson gave a good oration on “The Tobacco Trust.” Decidedly the most interesting and profitable oration of the morning was by T. D. Sparrow on the subject, “Bits of North Carolina History Very Little Known.”

The new floor in the store building of Armour Bros. & Thompson is now nearing completion, and it is expected that they will be able to move the stock of goods back again within a short time. The new floor is of cement, constructed according to modern methods.

Bill Osteen, ex-'16, has signed up to play baseball with Augusta, Ga., this summer. Last year he twirled for Morganton and made the leading record of the Western North Carolina League. During the past winter, he has been a bookkeeper for the Morganton Furniture Company. He will leave for Augusta immediately.
