**Club Sports Spotlight: Men's Lacrosse**

**Founder hopes to capitalize on sport’s growing popularity**

By Mike Giglio, Sports Editor

A new club team has surfaced recently on the Davidson campus, one that promises to bring the excitement of a men’s sport that hasn’t been around in more than seven years. While lacrosse has emerged as one of the most popular sports at most colleges in the nation, Davidson currently lacks a men’s varsity team. The club lacrosse team hopes it can help fill that void.

“Davidson is a small private school in the South that gets a lot of students from the North,” says team captain, president, and founder Evans McGowan ’05, referring to the fact that lacrosse is more popular up north. “Lacrosse is probably the fastest growing sport in the nation, and a lot of other schools around here are starting to form teams, so I felt like this was a good place and time to get one started.”

McGowan seems to have been right about that. The team has expanded to about 20 players in only its first semester, and potential fans around campus have already begun to show interest in coming out to see the games. The physical aspect of the men’s version of the sport makes it distinctly different from women’s lacrosse, for which Davidson has a varsity team.

“I think it’s one of the best games you can play,” McGowan explains. “You give guys armor and something to hit with and just let them go at it.

“There are rules and structure, though,” he adds. “The game can be a lot like basketball. You set picks and run plays, and it can be high scoring. They both have the same basic point: get the ball in the net.”

Most of the players on the team have high school experience, with a few having played the sport since middle school. There are some who are new to the game, however, and McGowan describes them as “the guys who are most excited to play.”

The team will play its inaugural game against Elon, and after that, they plan to take on Winthrop, Wake Forest, Appalachian State, UNCC, and Furman. Although they won’t be in a league this year, McGowan hopes to join the SELC (Southeastern Lacrosse Conference) next year, which he describes as one step down from NCAA competition.

Defenseman Geoff Fehling ’06, midfielder Garrin Riedel ’06, and goalie Tim Curlett ’05 should be players who will have an immediate impact. The team is coached by Fuji Lozada, an anthropology professor at Davidson who played lacrosse at Harvard and referees college games.

McGowan handles everything else, including getting field time, scheduling practices and games, contacting coaches, and trying to get the team into a league. It hasn’t been an easy task.

“It’s been a bit hard, trying to be a student, organize a team, and raise the money to pay for it,” he says. Since it’s a new club, the team will have to finance itself this season, paying for equipment, referees, EMTs, and other expenses. Next year, if all goes well, the team will be designated a Class II club, allowing it to receive $250 a year from the school. After that, McGowan hopes, it will obtain a level one status and be better provided for.

“It’s like starting a business,” he says. “You’ve got to get things going on your own at first.”

The team will get going against Elon on Wednesday, April 23, under the lights of the turf field in what looks to be the first of many games for men’s lacrosse at Davidson. Practices are held Mondays and Wednesdays at 4 p.m. on the hill field next to Baker, and the team is always looking for new members.

Sports Information Press Release

For the second straight year, Bruiser Flint of Drexel had a better fashion designer than Davidson head coach Bob McKillop. On last year’s runway, Flint, the defending 2001 champion, defeated McKillop in the...Semifinals to advance to the fashion championship. This season, number-two seeded Flint didn’t allow McKillop, the third seed in the South Region, to get past the Sensational Sixteen. McKillop opened the competition by defeating the 14-seed, James Jones of Yale, to reach the field of 32. He advanced to the round of 16 by dazzling his way past Johnny Jones of North Texas to meet what has proved to be his fashion nemesis over the years. Last year, McKillop seemed the surprise of the field, but this season coaches know the impeccable fashion sense they are up against. Flint, usually quite smooth on the runway, had all he could handle in the early going against McKillop. In the words of Lento, “Fabulous Flint just couldn’t shake the majestic Bob McKillop. The dapper Davidson coach had recruited a number of Armani All-Americans out of New York City, which continued to give Flint all sorts of trouble.”

“I can’t complain,” Flint said at halftime. “Coach McKillop is sharp and he’s proving it today. I have to just regroup at halftime. I am going to have to bring out some new gear in the second half.” Regroup he did and as Lento described it, “With the help of the famous ‘Boyds,’ in Philadelphia, Flint went on an early ravishing run, which seemed to disrupt McKillop’s majestic motion offense. Ultimately, it proved too much to overcome.”

Lacrosse drops two at home

This weekend, the women’s lacrosse team and their families and fans honored their seniors on the annual Senior Day. Although there are only four seniors on this year’s squad, they have all made an impact on the program over the past four seasons. Coach Mary Schwartz says of her seniors, “All four of them have contributed so much to this program with their playing and their leadership.” Their contributions are easy to see through this season’s stats alone. As of last week, co-captain Emily Rice was ranked number one in the nation for caused turnovers, one of the most important stats for a defensive player. Co-captain Becca McDevitt follows not too far behind Rice, ranked 22nd in the nation as of last week. As far as leadership on the team, senior Loren Seaton and McDevitt have been going back and forth in team leading goals.

The weekend was kicked off for the ’Cats on Friday night when they faced Ohio University. Seaton pulled off a first-half hat trick, scoring three unassisted goals. Whitney Diefendorf ’05 also netted an unassisted goal, bringing Davidson to a 7-4 deficit at the end of the half. Three minutes into the second half, McDevitt posted her ninth goal of the season, ending the scoring for the ’Cats. The final score was 14-5.

On Sunday, the Wildcats met Ohio State University, currently ranked tenth in the nation. McDevitt was the first to score for Davidson, followed by two goals from Seaton. Defensively, it was a big day for the ’Cats. Leslie Smith ’06 made her first collegiate start and came out strong against the Buckeyes, stopping 13 shots. The defense picked up 23 ground balls and caused 6 turnovers. On the offense, Davidson took 14 shots and controlled nine draws.

After a busy weekend of lacrosse, Coach Schwartz is looking forward to giving her team a week of rest until they face conference rival Vanderbilt University on Saturday. Davidson and Vanderbilt have gone 1-1 against each other in the last two seasons. Last year, the ’Cats lost a heart-breaking game 10-11. “We’re going in with high expectations,” comments Schwartz. “We have all week to prepare and any team can win on any given day.” The final home game for the lacrosse team is on April 15th at 7 p.m. against Virginia Tech.
