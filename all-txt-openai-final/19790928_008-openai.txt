explosive energy, verbal comedy

This Quiet Riot is a mime team, acclaimed in Philadelphia and coming to Davidson September 28 & 29. This weekend of entertainment will be sponsored by a "Union union": the conjunction of the Cultural Events Committee and Intimate combination of duo gymnastics and dance that they call "body physics." "Poignant and pensive, joyous and ebullient, Bill Mettle and Kevin O’Connor, each of them strongly individual and self-contained, have teamed up to give us something Euclid never dreamed of in his geometry—an entity greater than the sum of its parts." —The Drummer

This ongoing experimentation will be exhibited in a short performance at the 10 o'clock hour in front of Chambers on Friday, September 28, to initiate their arrival. That same afternoon, they will present a special workshop from 3:00-5:00. Then Friday and Saturday nights, the 900 Room hosts the Quiet Riot at 8:00. Tickets will be $1.00. No one should miss this very special event.

What Do You Want From College?

Add It To Your Schedule. There’s nothing wrong with a little materialism... We'll admit. One of the selling features of Army ROTC is just plain cold cash... nearly $2500 during your junior and senior years of college. There’s also the opportunity for a full-tuition scholarship. And a competitive salary as an Army officer when you graduate.

If any of this interests you, check out Army ROTC. And even if you enroll for the money, you’ll graduate with something worth a lot more... gold bars of an Army officer.
