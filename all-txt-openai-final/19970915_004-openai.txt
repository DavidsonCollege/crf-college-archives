**A new building, a new viewpoint, and a set of new rules**

This week marks the 30th anniversary of the unveiling of one of the most familiar structures on campus. The “thoroughly modern” Chambers Building was presented to students the week of Sept. 15, 1967, following a summer-long renovation project. Under the headline “Chambers Loses Tombs of Gloom,” the Davidsonian reported the cosmetic changes and commented on the “completely modernized interior.” The renovations replaced the steam radiators with a central heating and air conditioning system. The walls were painted in an array of vintage 60s colors, including mustard yellow, lime green, and turquoise.

While most of Chambers’ current daily visitors remember little of its past, they can all be grateful that this most popular building was spared the fate of typical and irreparable 50s- and 60s-influenced design. Chambers has been preserved as a stately building, well complemented by and in accordance with Davidson’s rich history.

On a more somber note, the editorial page featured a letter from a 21-year-old freshman, continuing a theme that would prevail throughout many more issues of that year’s Davidsonian — the Vietnam War. Mr. Sigman had just completed four years of service in the Marines, including a tour of duty in Vietnam, when he began his academic career here. Few, if any, current Davidson students have a first-hand knowledge of war or the subsequent stress engendered by uncertainty, violence, and bloodshed. Mr. Sigman articulated his opinion of service, writing, “At best, a tour of Vietnam can be described as a hard job with conditions and pay below union standards, and not as a practical exercise in philosophy. Now that I am at Davidson I can formulate some sort of opinion about ‘Nam... WAR IS BAD.”

Students today are very fortunate to have avoided such tumultuous times. But many argue the possibility that such experiences tend to make students more appreciative and mature concerning their education—but what a horrible rite of passage. In fact, evidence exists everywhere on campus that attests to the high degree of maturity and dedication of Davidson students.

Handling an issue which attested to the latent immaturity within each Davidson student, though, the Davidsonian dedicated ample space to deal with the “freshman problem.” Following a freshmen raid on Belk, “water stood as much as two inches deep” and “wet toilet paper, shaving cream, and confetti littered the dormitory and grounds.” The damage prompted the Student Body Regulations Court to ask for an end to dorm raids. Furthermore, the Freshman Court passed regulations requiring freshmen to “wear beanies and name tags, speak to upperclassmen, and create a class cheer by Homecoming.” With respect to the wearing of nametags, some traditions die hard for Davidson freshmen.

**Spirituality and Service**

As service opportunities at Davidson seek consolidation and new foci this year, students and organizations are making sure religion does not get lost in the shuffle. “Religion is the relationship of people to people,” says Liz Clasen, chapel committee coordinator, “it is about treating people kindly.” For Clasen and many other students on campus, religion is one of the major forces that motivate them to serve.

For many, spirituality and service go hand in hand. “It’s a human need to understand people’s situations,” said Brent Gilbert while commenting on how spirituality and service mesh together. For Gilbert, spirituality and religion provide his need to understand and service is the means to quench his thirst.

The chapel committee, coordinated by Liz Clasen, is an example of one of these groups. The committee’s purpose this year is to combine Christian fellowship with community service. The group meets every Thursday, and alternates meetings between faith and the organization of service projects. Clasen says that the committee already has a couple of major projects in the works for this semester. The first of these projects involves spending fall break in Atlanta, Georgia in a homeless shelter, working with the homeless and manning soup kitchens. The committee also will be sponsoring the Alternative Gift Fair, which gets gifts and items for the needy.During the holidays, the chapel committee will sponsor Room in the Inn during January, February, and March. This project will feed and house the homeless from Charlotte. The group is also interested in anyone who is interested in getting involved. They meet in the union homeroom at 8 PM every Thursday.

Another of Davidson’s active service organizations that combines service with spirituality is IVCF or InterVarsity Christian Fellowship. Dana Dixon and Brent Gilbert, who coordinate the group’s connection to community service, head IVCF. The basic principle of IVCF lies in the relationship between service and faith. For this year, IVCF is looking at more long-term projects, interspersed with one-time events. The group plans to repeat last year’s projects, “the 30-hour famine” and the gleaning project, which both work to provide food for the needy. If anyone is interested, they can contact Dixon and Gilbert for more information.

The Catholic group and the Stapleton/Davidson International Inc. intern program are another set of organizations that bridge spirituality and service. With just the four service organizations mentioned that combine service and faith, it is obvious that for a school of Davidson’s size, there is a definite connection between spirituality and service. Gilbert puts it simply by saying, “(When it comes to spirituality) service is not an option.”

Chaston relishes helping students

Kelly Chaston joins the faculty of the Economics Department this year. A native New Englander, Chaston attended Rhode Island College where she earned a B.A. in economics. Graduate studies in the same field earned her an M.A. from the University of New Hampshire and a Ph.D. from Boston College. While immersing herself in applied economic research, Chaston has not forgotten her first love: teaching. She has experience at Merrimack College and Wellesley College, two all-girls liberal arts schools in Massachusetts.

Chaston, who “loves the tradition of a liberal arts education,” knew she would teach as she began doctoral studies. “I’ve been given the opportunity to do exactly what I set out to do, and that does not happen to a lot of people,” she says. Chaston’s fields of specialty are public finance and industrial organization. These interests, which involve government and taxation policies, often provide ample opportunity for in-depth research. This involves the application of economic theories to the real world. “I was very lucky to work with (in research) very good people. I would like to think that eventually I will give students that same opportunity,” she says.

Dr. Chaston does not let her status as the only female economics professor hinder her work. She views herself as an economist, regardless of gender, while maintaining a strong concern for gender issues. She believes that the opportunities available to female academics today are attributable to the determination of those from many years ago. “I do not feel the difficulties of being a woman in economics, but only due to the efforts of women who came way before me who had it very, very rough.”

Chaston’s favorite part of being a Davidson professor is the interaction with students. In two weeks of classes, she believes the students here “certainly live up to the reputation she heard of.” “The best part of what I get to do is when someone comes into my office with questions, and I not only get to answer their questions but talk with them one-on-one. That’s the best part of my job.”
