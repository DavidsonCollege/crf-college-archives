The DAVIDSONIAN April 17, 1918

Red Cross News

The April order of supplies for the Red Cross has just arrived. The material has been delayed for about two
weeks on account of shipping facilities and has caused the work room to be closed for lack of supplies. The
supplies come from Washington, and their misplacement made it necessary for someone to go to Washington to trace them up.
The new order is for three hundred face bandages. This is the largest, by far, of any order yet received.
The work room will now be open on the regular days: Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays. Everyone is urged to
be present on these days.

FORUM

Not long ago we read an article in The Davidsonian stating that although John L. Sullivan was dead, his martial
spirit and love for fighting still existed in Davidson. Jim Jeffries has quit the business, Jack Johnson was knocked out
in Havana, and Fred Fulton has challenged Jess Willard to battle on July 4. We are afraid this will not
be the last great pugilistic combat, since Promoter Spence is trying to arrange a hundred-round bout between Longjaw Liston and
some other great fighter. Spence is putting Liston in excellent shape, having reduced him ten pounds in the last week.
Liston wants sixty percent of the gate receipts but prefers a guarantee of "two hits." As the battle must be
fought somewhere in the United States, we would suggest as the arena, the new gymnasium, on account of its freedom
from books, chairs, water, and other equipment. Promoter Spence announces a two-round draw between Stukes Burgess and General Howling Hall
on last Wednesday night. Ox Harrell, like many other great fighters, has seen his best days and will retire with
honor from the ring. The exact date of Liston's next bout will be announced soon, as well as his opponent.
Marquis of Queensbury’s Special rules will be followed and the affair should prove of interest to all lovers of hot
air and explanation.

SUGGESTIONS WANTED FOR NEW Y. M. C. A. HAND-BOOK

The chairman of publications of the new Y. M. C. A.C. A. cabinet, wishing to produce for the Davidson student
body the best hand-book it has ever had next year, and desiring to make the hand-book a thing of value
and usefulness to the student, wishes to request anyone who has similar publications from other colleges for this or previous
years, or who has suggestions for improvements or changes in the material, style, or appearance of the book, to please
hand the same to A. S. Potts, 20 Chambers, as soon as possible.

NEW BOOKS IN THE LIBRARY.

Two new books which have just been received at the library are especially interesting to students. Jr. Ussher’s “American Missionary
in Turkey” will be eagerly read by all who heard the author speak. “The History of the Art of Writing”
is a unique work on the origin and development of writing. It is in four volumes, composed of folios of
plates with explanations. The many colored plates make the work a thing of beauty, while the notes give it usefulness.
The four volumes cover Oriental, Medieval, Classical, and Modern writings.
