The field hockey team got off to an inauspicious beginning this weekend, losing its first two games of the season.
The Wildcats dropped their opener Friday to Virginia 11-0 and lost to Georgetown 9-0 on Saturday.

Virginia, one of Davidson’s toughest opponents of the season, came into the game boasting a top 20 national ranking and
a roster including three All-Americans. One of them, Meredith Thorpe, netted four goals for the Cavaliers. Despite the impressive credentials
of the Cavalier team, the Wildcats played well, trailing only 3-0 at the half.

“UVA was a really tough team. We could run with them, but we just didn’t show it this weekend,” defender
Lindsey Parker said.

Georgetown also posed a formidable challenge. Lori Fogliano and Lauren Hilsky scored two goals apiece for the Hoyas in the
first half, but Davidson’s defense stiffened in the second period, allowing only two goals.

“Hopefully we will learn from some of our mistakes,” goalkeeper Sara Gebhardt said. “We left ourselves a lot of room
for improvement.”

The Wildcats will try to put their performance behind them as they look ahead to the rest of the season.

#### Hoops team bonds on Italian trip
By MICHAEL J. KRUSE

**Editor in Chief**

The men’s basketball team did its version of studying abroad on a seven-game Italian excursion Aug. 11-20. And, according to
coach Bob McKillop, the trip — despite the 2-5 record — was nothing but a success.

“It was a wonderful experience from a cultural standpoint and an educational standpoint,” the veteran coach said. “It was a
terrific experience from the standpoints of team chemistry, bonding, and experimenting with roles. Anything and everything we could have accomplished
in three weeks, we met our expectations.”

Often playing with just an eight- and even seven-man rotation, the Wildcats more than held their own against some of
the most physical professionals and finest amateurs the European continent has to offer — a level of competition McKillop estimated
was somewhere between this country’s CBA and NBA.

Due to an NCAA regulation stating that no individual can participate in a summer event without having played the previous
season, Davidson was without the services of incoming freshmen Emeka Erege and Brian Allenspach, and junior Ben Ebong, who redshirted
last year. On top of that, reigning Southern Conference Freshman of the Year Landry Kosmalski played in only the first
two games because of a nagging case of tendinitis in his knee. Guard Billy Armstrong was also hampered by a
back strain that in many games limited him to just five or six minutes on the court.

“Everybody had moments of brilliance,” McKillop said, noting that Stephen Marshall, Davor Halbauer, and Armstrong — even in his limited
action — were most consistently brilliant. Super scorer David Burns and Marshall each notched 20-plus points twice. And sharp-shooter Mark
Donnelly scored 24 against the Italian 22-and-under national team, as the Wildcats lost by a deceptively wide 15-point margin. Davidson
picked up both its wins versus Viola at Reggio Calabria.

But McKillop and his Wildcats took much more from the trip than just wins and losses.

“I think we are going to be able to use the bench quite liberally this year,” McKillop said, looking ahead
to what should be one of the deepest and most versatile Wildcat basketball squads in school history. “As a team,
they are a group that really cares about each other and is willing to make everybody on the floor better
by the way they treat each other. There are no egos.”

Chattanooga men’s basketball coach Mack McCarthy unexpectedly resigned Aug. 2, leaving McKillop as the senior and most prominent coach in
the Southern Conference. McCarthy, who was one win shy of becoming the league’s all-time winningest coach, apparently decided he wanted
to take his talent to the next level and that Chattanooga was not the place to do it.

“Mack has had a great run at Chattanooga,” McKillop said. “I think he felt he needed to go to a
different springboard to get where he wants to go.”

McCarthy has accepted a job as assistant coach at Virginia Commonwealth, but will take over as head coach in 1998-99.
Henry Dickerson, McCarthy’s long-time associate head coach at Chattanooga, will take over the Mocs and attempt to reload after losing
several key fifth-year seniors that produced a conference title and Sweet 16 berth last year.

#### Volleyball starts season 2-1 in tourney
By CURTIS TUTTLE

**Staff Writer**

The volleyball team closed out its season-opening tournament with a win over...Elon Saturday night in Belk Arena. The win clinched
a second-place finish for the Wildcats in the tourney, held Friday and Saturday. The College of Charleston dominated the event,
going unbeaten in three matches. Against Elon, Davidson cruised through the first game, winning 15-6. The Fighting Christians jumped out
to a 9-1 lead in the second game, though. The Wildcats mounted a comeback, but ultimately fell 15-10. Davidson then
won the final two games, 15-6 in the third and 15-11 in the fourth. The Wildcats started their season on
the right foot Friday night with a 3-1 win over UNC Wilmington. They lost to Charleston Saturday afternoon. Coach Lisa
Marston was very pleased with the team’s effort — “two good wins over two good teams,” as she said Saturday
night. She was most impressed with the “phenomenal” play of Gina Lawrence, who averaged over six digs per game in
the three matches. Two years ago, then Wildcat senior Michelle Augustine averaged just over four digs a game and ended
the season ranked fourth in the nation. Ginny Quis had three outstanding performances, playing every position and showing herself to
be one of the squad’s most versatile members. Marston also noted the “solid, confident” play of rookie Brooke Bentley, who
made an immediate contribution in her debut. “As long as the team stays disciplined, they will stay effective,” Marston said.
Janet Duncan described the weekend event as “a great way to begin what is going to be a great year.”

Cookson, Franklin lead male harriers; Kiefer and Lannon to captain women

The men’s cross country team looks to improve upon a disappointing last-place finish at last year’s Southern Conference Championships. Co-captains
Josh Cookson and Tripp Franklin are poised to lead the squad, but many contributions are expected from an outstanding group
of sophomores. “The heart of this team will be the sophomores,” coach Gary Andrew said Friday. “I am excited about
this season and feel that this group of guys has a chance to beat some teams.”

A problem currently facing this team is injuries. Cookson was sidelined by an Achilles injury this weekend at the UNC
Asheville relay meet, and it is not known how long he will be out. Franklin is also battling an Achilles
problem and shin splints, but ran at UNCA. The team also has two returning sophomores who were unable to compete
all of last season. Pat Burchett missed last season due to injury, but has looked strong in preseason workouts. Also
returning is Victor Talbird, who suffered a stroke at the beginning of the second semester last year. Talbird, who began
running lightly a couple of months after the stroke, has been strong so far.

Also expected to contribute this season are Thomas McElveen, Brent Ferrell, William Elsenhower, Neil Burt, and Tim O’Keefe. The Wildcats
will compete in eight meets this year. The one home meet is the Davidson Alumni Open Invitational on Sept. 13.
The Southern Conference championships are Nov. 1 in Statesboro, Ga., and the NCAA South Regionals are two weeks later at
Furman.

The women’s cross country team is looking to translate a strong preseason into a successful regular season and strong Southern
Conference finish. “We have good returning talent, along with some promising new talent,” coach Beth Puckett said. “We would like
to finish fifth or sixth in the Southern Conference this year, right behind some of the larger, scholarship schools. Suzy
Burr and Allie Curran are the top two runners right now, but there is a group of six or seven
right behind them.” That group consists of co-captains Kelly Kiefer and Katie Lannon, as well as Beth Brewster, Maggie Barbosa,
and Clare Frey. “All have worked hard in the off-season, as well as this preseason,” Puckett said.

Freshmen Smyth Bitter and Jill Neumayer are also expected to contribute this fall. “One of the big questions is how
the freshmen will adjust from high school to college running, and right now it is too early to tell,” Puckett
explained. “We run essentially the same schedule year in and year out, so our goal is to improve over the
previous year at each meet. With 20 runners this year, we should field a tough top seven or nine for
each meet. Hopefully, everyone will peak at the Southern Conference Championships in November.” The women ran this weekend at UNC
Asheville, but the first full meet is Sept. 6 at Appalachian St. The one home meet is Sept. 13. The
women finish the season with the conference championships Nov. 1, followed by the NCAA South Regionals Nov. 15.
