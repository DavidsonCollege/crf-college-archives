On Friday, April 12, 2002, Davidson College’s Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity hosted its annual Bike-for-Life fundraiser. SAE’s Bike-for-Life helps support
Project Life at Davidson. Project Life strives to type every member of the college community, including all 450+ members of
each incoming freshman class. The annual cost for this effort exceeds $40,000. This year, SAE was able to raise $2,200
to help ensure that Davidson’s Project Life continues to do great things for this college community.

As rain clouds drifted above, the brothers of SAE feared that the Bike-a-Thon might need to be postponed. Luckily, the
rains did not come and the members of the house pedaled down Concord and soon on to Grey Road, until
finally, they topped the last exhausting hill and made it back to the fraternity house. No injuries occurred, thanks to
all the kind people who allowed the brothers to use their bike helmets, and all the members pulled together and
raised an impressive sum of money—especially for such a small fraternity house. All the brothers of SAE would like to
extend a special thanks to everyone that pledged money and also to everyone that donated helmets or bikes for a
good cause. And a special thanks to the community service office for all their help in making this bike ride
possible.

### Warner Hall completes “Dress for Success”

By MARYANNE WARNER Special Contributor

As you might have noticed from the overflowing boxes of donations around campus, Warner Hall has just completed a tremendously
successful clothing drive. The clothes support “Dress for Success”—a national, non-profit organization that provides appropriate apparel for women seeking to
enter the workforce, offers interview preparation, career counseling, and ongoing career support.

A group of faculty, staff, friends, and family of Davidson College attended “Sweet Success,” a silent auction and celebration with
coffee and sweets which benefited “Dress for Success.” House members Kate Morris and Jan Scott Swetenburg led the daunting task
of collecting, advertising, and organizing for this project and the results are obvious. In a presentation made to the group,
these wonderful women announced that over twenty beautiful suits and money to buy several more were collected and were able
to be donated to “Dress for Success.”

Warner Hall Eating House recognizes the strength and bravery of these women who are looking to make a better life
for themselves and their families. Through the clothes collected from the Davidson town and college community, the women of Warner
Hall hope to show our support for the clients of Dress for Success in their endeavor for independence.

### Spring colics? Beer, bats, and Enron take over the school

Bats, from page 1
“But that’s the price we must pay to defend our human liberty,” declared Political Science major Geoff Ford ’02. A
pro-bat faction of students, however, insists that the bats were provoked. “The bats didn’t ask to be experimented on; in
our human-centric way, we have used them as mere pawns to further our own greed for scientific knowledge. No wonder
they struck back!” commented Janet Hamilton ’03. “Perhaps if we acknowledge their sufferings and give them Richardson or something as
a token of goodwill, we can bring this horrible era to a close and reach new levels of person-bat understanding.”

“Rich isn’t fit for human occupation anyway,” added Karen Wells ’04. Attempts to contact the bat leaders were rebuffed. However,
they are displaying a flag depicting a triumphant bat standing atop the ruins of Chambers, which may not bode well
for peaceful resolution of this conflict.

Enron, from page 1
Such as the purchasing of lower grade meat. His suggestion was silenced upon learning that all meat currently used is
made mostly of retired circus animals. Vagt’s next move was to propose the Commons double as an oil drilling station,
under the reasoning, “Who’s more oiled than kids on Patterson Court?” The project was abandoned, however, when drilling vibrations caused
one of those huge triangle thingys suspended from the Commons ceiling to fall, injuring seven students. Amazingly, the disaster went
unnoticed by the dining staff.Staff discovered the mess some hours later when a worker stumbled upon it en route to
the salad bar to post a fresh “If our salad’s foul, it’s the farmers’ fault” disclaimer. In a last-ditch effort,
Vagt begged money from visiting hip-hop artist Ludacris as he prepared for tonight’s performance in Belk Arena. The rapper was
in no mood to negotiate, however, citing “unpleasantness” from earlier that day. Sources later confirmed a fiasco had ensued when
a confused member of the Cornelius farming community, having misinterpreted lyrics to the popular song “Area Codes,” approached Mr. Ludacris
with the intent to purchase farm equipment.

“I feel as though I have been wronged,” Ludacris was later quoted as saying. His comment was unfortunately cut short
by an “urgent” cell phone call. Desperate for a solution, Vagt assembled the college’s senior staff for a 96-hour brainstorming
session. Tension peaked three minutes later when the President stormed out of the board room, ran down the hall, and
threw open the school’s safe, only to find $18.37 in pennies, a used copy of “Squashing Grade Inflation for Dummies,”
and a member of the RSC (who had apparently been passed out in the space since the troupe’s February residency).
Out of options and beginning to lose his hair over the situation, Vagt resorted to calling Fluntz. Apparently, multiple Enron
execs solicited Vagt’s advice on prison life earlier this year. “It was time to call in the favor,” said Vagt.
Fluntz stated his terms, assuring Vagt that the corporation’s recent declaration of bankruptcy was “mostly a joke.”

Word of the decision was made at a school-wide forum, whereupon a number of students emerged from the bushes and
began to draw on cheap white undershirts with magic markers in protest. Student demonstration was quelled, however, when RLO kicked
the protest leaders out of their dorm rooms, citing explanations of “concern for community dynamics” and “just because we can.”
Despite all dissension, Vagt remains confident that the name change was a good call. “We’re rolling in the clams now!”
he said, lighting a fresh Romeo y Julieta with a crisp Franklin. “We might even have enough left over to
buy Brazil! Or at least a nice Honda!” No doubt controversy will continue to froth as students and alums weigh
the implications of the now infamous decision to save Davidson’s good name by, well, changing Davidson’s good name. Vagt hopes
all shall “come to their doggone senses,” describing the change as “integral in erecting the foundation of Davidson’s, er, Enron’s
future.”

A Beer of a Prospect: SGA Prez Grady of 37 red-rimmed beer coolers to be placed on campus as part
of the Community Beer Program. This one shall grace the SGA office.

Beer, from page 1

Community Beer program. UB President Kate Fiedler ’03 made the executive decision to cancel both nights of Rent, the Artist
Series extravaganza, to ensure that choice hops will flow faster than during the Royal Shakespeare Company’s visit. The UB will
further plan many of next year’s events around drinking games and interactive alcoholic contests. “I like beer,” said Fiedler. “What
kind of Wildcat would pass up a free Schlitz for, well, not having beer?”

The Community Beer program will rely strictly on the college’s Code of Responsibility to ensure that only one beer is
removed and consumed at a time by students, faculty, staff, or their children. Students are encouraged to report infractions to
the Dean of Students Office. Research has begun to estimate the consumption rate of the coolers’ contents. The math department
has thus far calculated that at current standards of beer demand at Davidson, the coolers would have to be refilled
only five times a day. Oddly, that rate triples in the vicinity on the side of Vail Commons near Pi
Kappa Alpha fraternity.

Sources claim there are yet many glitches to iron out in the program, but all spokesmen involved feel the college
atmosphere will improve and seem more inviting to prospective students and their families. The program will target high school students
hailing particularly from Paducah, Kentucky, Mobile, Alabama, and the whole state of Arkansas. “In honor of this new program,” President
Vagt stated in last week’s conference, “we are changing the words of the college Alma Mater to proclaim, ‘All Ale,
Oh, Davidson,’ instead of ‘hail.’ Change is good. Everyone needs a little hair ‘o the dog.”
