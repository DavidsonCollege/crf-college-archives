...among the many motion pictures that have made their big-screen premiere at the TIFF. Many North American directors make their debut here, but international films are also represented. This year’s festival premieres films from Brazil, Canada, France, Norway, and South Korea. Three films that premiered in France’s 2008 Festival de Cannes are making their way to the TIFF with U.S. distribution deals. Regent Releasing, an L.A.-based theatrical distribution company, successfully obtained U.S. distribution rights to “Serbis.” This drama is directed by Brillante Mendoza and was nominated for a Palme d’Or at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival.

You may even run into a movie star. TIFF published an official guest list and stated that they had sent out 500 guest invitations to world-renowned actors. Adrien Brody, Vincent D’Onofrio, Jeff Goldblum, and “The Narrows” stars Kevin Zegers and Sophia Bush all made the list. Toronto officially rolled out the red carpet on Thursday at Roy Thomas Hall with the invitation-only premiere of Canadian actor-director Paul Gross’ “Passchendaele.”

This year’s highlights include “Burn After Reading,” an Ethan and Joel Coen comedy which features Brad Pitt, George Clooney, and Frances McDormand among many others. Following this Coen Brothers production, Keira Knightley (who was outraged as she learned that studio heads were going to amplify her cleavage on TIFF publicity posters) will play the role of an 18th-century aristocrat in “The Duchess.” With this year’s line-up, the Festival guarantees to impress any crowd and welcomes you with open screens to join in the excitement of being part of North America’s biggest film festival.

“Heroes” blends genres

PETER KEPLIN
Staff Writer

When I first heard the song “Cupid’s Chokehold” by Gym Class Heroes, I was intrigued. Who were these guys who had seamlessly taken Supertramp’s classic rock hit, “Breakfast in America,” and turned it into a rock-infused, hip-hop single? It was an almost-perfect blend. Just enough guitar and drums, but at the same time, the rhymes and beats were something radical and dangerously new. And, to my surprise, I discovered that they were self-described as an Indie, emo-rap band. I told everyone I knew about this band and their strange, addictive music. I bought their first album, “For the Kids” and was immediately drawn to the simple raps. “Beautiful Day” and “This Thing Called Life” are still two of my favorite songs, and while these songs are still obscure, they are a true representation of the original band.

It has been nearly eight years since that first album “For the Kids” came out. Sadly, just like “For the Kids,” the true Gym Class Heroes are being forgotten. The other day I was browsing iTunes and stumbled upon “Patches from the..."Quilt," an extended play of some Heroes music. The lack of creativity from what used to be such a revolutionary band shocked me. As I listened to the song “Cookie Jar,” I got a distressing sense of what Gym Class Heroes had become. Meaningful lyrics were nowhere to be found. Importantly, it is not so much the music that Gym Class is making that has changed them, but the loss of their original inspirations. This is made far too apparent by the fact that the first album of Gym Class, “For the Kids,” isn’t even available on iTunes anymore. Nor can it be purchased on Amazon or eBay. So, how can Gym Class Heroes keep up with their original style when it has been swallowed up by convention? Even though at times you can sense the Indie, emo-rap from the late nineties displayed on their last album, “As Cruel as School Children,” you can sadly hear the band slipping into the mainstream pop scene. While songs like “7 Weeks,” “Beautiful Day,” “Paper Cuts,” and “Shoot Down the Stars” are all true examples of the simplistic beauty of Gym Class Heroes, all it takes is a song like “Cookie Jar” to ruin the band for even the most diehard fans. Hopefully, their new album, “The Quilt,” which was released yesterday, will give some indication that independent creativity still has a fighting chance.
