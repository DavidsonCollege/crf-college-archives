**‘Knead’ lunch-time treats?**

By Amy FREEMAN
Special Contributor.

I was first approached about writing a review of the Knead It? Bakery Cafe in town by Leslie Mann, whose
wife Jessica owns the bakery. He invited me over for lunch, and since the bakery is just one mile up
Main Street, I thought I’d stop by and check it out.

When I arrived at the bakery and introduced myself to Mr. Mann, he immediately sent me back into the kitchen
to meet his wife, and then explained what the bakery offers for lunch. The bakery itself has a high ceiling,
lots of windows, and an outdoor seating area. Mr. Mann also showed me plans for a covered porch at the
front of the bakery, an addition that will take advantage of this North Carolina weather. There were newspapers out for
customers to read, and Rubik's Cubes on the tables. Mr. Mann seemed to know most of his customers by name,
and the atmosphere was quite friendly and pleasant.

As Mr. Mann put it, the trend right now is quick, healthy lunches, so the bakery caters to this fad.
It offers daily soups, salads, quiches, sandwiches, and a trio composed of tuna, chicken, egg, and pasta salad served over
greens. The sandwiches are served on pinwheel bread or croissants. They also offer croissant stuffers, with combinations like ham, egg
and cheese, or spinach and feta.

I had the spinach and feta stuffer for lunch, as well as a cup of chicken and vegetable soup, and
it was wonderful. The stuffer was served warm, and the soup had fresh vegetables in it. The prices on the
lunch menu are quite fair, including the Daily Special of soup and a half sandwich for $5.

True to its name, The Knead It? Bakery Cafe also has a large selection of baked goods. There is a
variety of pastries, such as big sticky buns, muffins (including cranberry-orange and cinnamon-raisin and bran), cakes, pies, cookies, and cupcakes.
Knead It? also has coffee, lattes, cappuccinos, and espressos. Its proximity to Davidson makes Knead It? convenient, and the quality
of its food makes it worth the short trip. I highly recommend stopping by, whether you are just grabbing a
quick lunch, or satisfying a sweet tooth with homemade goodies.

**Fly fishers hook good times**

By Lucy LONG
Staff Writer

When trying to think of an activity that would offer a refuge from Davidson’s daily grind and loan a sense
of perspective, two friends and I decided to test our fly fishing skills. We packed a lunch, loaded up the
car and began our pilgrimage to fly-fishing paradise. Our destination was Fay’s Fishing Shop in Linville, N.C. Fay, a 60-something
woman, operates her outfitters and fly-fishing guide service out of a run-down warehouse that sells fly rods, camouflage pants, and
packaged chips and candy left over from the 1970s.

At first, we had a bit of a communication problem with Fay. We could not decipher the word “shelf” from
Fay’s pronunciation, “cheff.” She responded with “you folks don’t know what a cheff is” as she led us to the
shelf of packaged pecan pies. Fay then introduced us to Ray.

Perhaps a bit wounded by the laughs, I wandered further down the river. After a while, I found my rhythm
and the big fish. The water was clear, allowing me to see the massive trout. Excited to see my target,
I lost my poise and galloped through the river in size 11 men’s boots and waders made for a 6-foot,
180-pound male. Lesson number 37 of the day: if you run at fish in oversized clothing and a neon green
rain jacket, they will swim away.

Learning to lay correctly the fly on the water’s surface is an art. It takes years of practice to master
the natural placement of the fly onto the current. The trout will not feed on a miscast fly; they know
when they are being tricked. Although I had no luck, my fellow angler was devious enough to catch a whopper.
After a long fight, she finally reeled him in. The little guy measured a good three inches, give or take
a few. I performed minor surgery on Mr. Trout to remove the hook. We of course took a rollFull of
energy, Ray, a local fishing guide, showed us the river and helped us prepare our gear. After we put on
our waders, fishing boots, and vests, we were ready to go. Rods and flies in hand, we charged the Linville
River with a rare enthusiasm and ignored the storm building in the distance. I doubt it had received three more
energized and ignorant anglers. After plunging into the river, I warned my comrades of catching their line on the trees
along the embankment. We spread out and began to fish. I couldn’t wait to make my first cast. After peeking
out of the corner of my eye to make sure I had an audience, I fed the line out of
the rod, preparing for a divine execution of sheer fly fishing mastery. I snapped my forearm back, making a clean
back cast, sure that I had set myself up for excellence. As I threw my arm forward, something suddenly whipped
me back: I had caught a tree.

Having caught a fish, we were ready to call it a day. Two of us began to trudge through the
ripping current as the rain pelted our faces. The embankment seemed miles away until our third friend noticed our exaggerated
strains and yelled, “Ladies, this is not Vietnam! You are not guerilla warriors tearing through a storm!” We then realized
that it was not as difficult to cross as we had initially anticipated. We baptized ourselves as expert fishermen, already
planning a future outing. The local Pappy’s Barbeque lured us with its Southern comfort food—a reward for a hard day’s
work. Over pulled pork, hushpuppies, and sweet tea, we exchanged our trials and successes as the avid anglers that we
had become. On our way home, we traveled in silence, wallowing in indigestion and reveling in the day’s accomplishments.

Lattes and Lager at Summit

For those of you who want to enjoy a beverage at Summit on the newly renovated patio, you now have
a plethora of options. We were elated to find alcohol now gracing the menu after 5 p.m. The beer menu
features such classics as Budweiser ($2) and Corona ($3) and also includes Highland Kashmir IPA ($3) and Weeping Radish Weizen
($3) from the state “First in Flight.” There’s also Anchor Steam, Harpoon IPA, and Spaten Lager for the more adventurous,
each at $3.50. We were satisfied with the wine selection and enjoyed the full fruity flavors and hints of toasted
oak in the Cellar 8 Cabernet Sauvignon ($8 glass, $22 bottle) and the spicy explosion and dark cherry hues in
the Castle Rock Pinot Noir ($7.50, $20). The wine list includes several Australian wines: Rosemont Cabernet Merlot ($6, $18), Alice
White Merlot ($5, $16), and the citrusy Penfold Semillon-Chardonnay. We look forward to sharing a bottle of Charles Krug Merlot
($28) and Cabernet Sauvignon ($28) next time we have something momentous to celebrate. Next time you are looking for rich,
buttery, tropical flavors with a twist of Asian pear, you should pop in for some Chateau St. Jean from Sonoma
($22 bottle, $8 glass).

Summit’s expanded evening menu also includes snack items. The ideal complement for your bold red wine, the cheese board for
two ($7.95) or for four ($14.95) includes generous wedges of Coburn Cheddar with port wine, Sage Derby, Abbeydale Double Gloucester
with chives, and the Double Gloucester with a pungent streak of Blue Stilton served with crispy wafer crackers. Not only
were we delighted by the setting, but we also enjoyed a lively game of “Name That Cheese” as we struggled
to match cheese and description. While the Coburn Cheddar’s creamy texture reminded us of the orange variety often found in
Easy Cheese canisters, other cheeses danced upon our taste buds with gentle pirouettes. The Derby’s pleasant sage flavor made it
our favorite and transported us back to the rolling hills of our home, West Texas. If you don’t feel like
a culinary trip to Texas, why not go international with the Grecian Delight ($6.95), a charming array of hummus, pita
chips, carrots, and Kalamata olives. Summit also offers the ubiquitous Tex-Mex favorite, chips and salsa ($2.95). If you are looking
for something sweet, indulge your desires with Tiramisu ($4.25), Raspberry White Chocolate Cheesecake ($4.25), Kentucky Derby Cake ($3.95), Chocolate Lovin’
Spoon Cake ($3.95), or a cannoli ($3.50). With its new patio and the myriad of evening offerings, Summit is the
perfect place to spend an autumn night.
