Abolishing fraternities will not dissolve factions
Melissa Dilettuso

I am a junior on leave from Davidson until spring term and studying in Los Angeles, California. While I have been away, I have received and read the Davidsonian somewhat regularly. Not since Anne Lambert’s Pike Dog articles have I seen the controversy that Mr. Bogert’s articles evoked. I, unfortunately, did not receive the issue in which his first article appeared. However, I did read the letter written by Mr. Booker, the articles written by Mr. Harris and Mr. Stewart, and the second letter written by Mr. Bogert. So basically I got the gist of the first one.

I can understand why so many found such contempt with Mr. Bogert’s accusations. Mr. Booker concentrated on those aimed towards his fraternity, Mr. Harris on the author’s narrow-mindedness, and Mr. Stewart on the diversity of fraternity members. I would like to address two issues: the replacement of fraternities with self-selected eating houses and the “sheltered lives” which fraternity members have led.

I am a member of a women’s eating house which adheres to the self-selection policy. As a proud member of the house which is sometimes known as the Rusk House, I would have to say that fraternities have not cornered the market on social factions. I do not believe anyone would argue that Warner Hall, Rusk, Spencer, and Pax are faction-free. All of these houses have been stereotyped by students, administration, and faculty. Mr. Bogert argues that these self-selected houses offer students the opportunity to choose a house at which they will feel most comfortable. Generally, this means self-selecting a house whose members they feel have interests common to their own. By definition, self-selection divides. Any group or club does. Does this necessarily instill narrowness? If so, I suppose we have the narrowest relationships with those who are closest to us.

If one were to mention my name at Davidson and ask into what “factions” (or categories) I could be divided, the responses would most likely be something like “Yankee,” “junior,” “Wop,” “English major,” “Husky Rusky” (or cow), and all the connotations that follow these adjectives. People and groups—institutions as well—are labeled. They always have been and always will be—and this creates divisions. Now, not all labels are derogatory. I only find one of the previously mentioned offensive. Labels and divisions can be found in all aspects of life. This is not to say these alone create rivalry and animosity. Neither is synonymous with “prejudice” or “bigotry.” Those are characteristics instilled in us long before we enter Davidson’s gates. Abolishing fraternities will not dissolve the factions simply because they are not the cause—nor the catalyst.

In regard to Mr. Bogert’s statement, “The majority of students joining them [fraternities] are white, they are of the upper-middle/lower-upper class, they have always lived very sheltered lives, most have always associated with people of similar backgrounds,” I am positively enraged. Granted, most fraternity members are white and of the upper-middle class, as are members of self-selected eating houses and the Davidson student body. If that is Mr. Bogert’s argument, I suggest he take his complaint to the admissions office.

As for sheltered lives, I believe Mr. Bogert is sorely mistaken. I would say I know more than a handful of members from several fraternities well enough to judge the level of “shelteredness” in their lives. First, let me say I have lived in two foreign countries and eight states, have worked in positions ranging from grocery store cashier to barn hand to waitress in an exclusive restaurant, and have been a member of a family which has risen from living in a one-bedroom apartment in Chicago, Illinois to a four-bedroom home in New York City’s suburbs. So you can see living a sheltered life is not something with which I am familiar or which I envy.

I have met fraternity members whose parents struggle to provide them with a private college education and those who see the tuition as pocket change. I have met members whose fathers are high school coaches, politicians, college professors, ministers, colonels, judges, doctors, and farmers. Are you implying, Mr. Bogert, that a poverty-stricken life is synonymous with an unsheltered life? I have met fraternity members from Alaska, the posh suburbs of Chicago, the Amish countryside of Pennsylvania, the dairy farmland of Wisconsin, the mountains of Virginia, the inner city of Washington, D.C., and the exclusive suburbs of New York. Have I made my point?

Those who are sheltered are those who cannot or refuse to see life as it occurs around them. Yes, the Davidson community is sheltered if that is all one is able or allows one to see. But I and many of my fraternity friends have escaped Davidson's “confines”—as you see them—and have witnessed much that we may hope never to experience. I hope Mr. Bogert sees the misdirection his accusations have taken. Fraternities may not be perfect, neither are the self-selected eating houses, nor is Davidson College, and certainly, neither is life.

Davidson College needs to hire more professors
Lucia Kendall

Excited about another term of classes at Davidson, you fill out your course preference sheet and turn it in to your adviser. A few weeks later, when you pick up your schedule, you realize that once again you are signed up for only two classes. You waste three hours waiting in line on the day of schedule adjustments, only to discover that the only courses with spaces are Sanskrit 103 and Quantum Mechanics. You stand in line another twenty minutes so Mrs. Hogg can type the code number of your latest enterprise into the computer. Walking to dinner, you try desperately to convince yourself that a whole newA world of excitement awaits you since you will soon be able to converse fluently with every Sanskrit-speaker you happen to come across. It doesn’t work. Every Davidson student has experienced a situation similar to this one. Many, like me, have gone through it every term. Although resourceful students can take advantage of drop/add lines as a chance to enjoy Toni Morrison’s latest novel or to meet a potential homecoming date, the problem remains: Davidson does not offer enough classes. This problem is not simply a matter of students not getting a class they want. It’s a matter of getting any classes. During the drop/add period for Winter term, the entire religion department had only two classes with openings. In the history department, every class but one had filled up or even burst through the ceiling. These examples are not worst-case scenarios; they represent the situation in other departments as well.

The restrictions placed on the number of classes Davidson offers maims the quality of education in several ways. First, students are missing the chance to take classes that should be available to them, even at a small school. With all the windy promotion of a “global perspective,” why is it that unless a student is willing to invest two years in Humanities, he cannot take a class in world literature? Davidson doesn't offer one. Last summer a friend from a New England college as small as Davidson told me that she was considering majoring in Women’s Studies. She asked me how the Women’s Studies Department at Davidson was. “Well,” I stumbled, “we don’t exactly have a Women’s Studies Department.” “Oh, what category do Women’s Studies courses fall under?” “We, uh, don’t actually have any Women’s Studies courses.”

The second problem that results from not having enough classes is that there is not enough space in the classes Davidson does offer. Consequently, students are often forced to sacrifice getting into the courses they really want to take so that they can meet area requirements. If a student puts Biology 21 down as her first choice, she risks allowing that Dr. Lewis’s class on Shakespeare, which she is dying to take, will be filled by the time the computer gets around to her second choice.

Third, the problem of not enough space is even more pronounced for underclassmen. Freshmen and sophomores have to make sure they get area requirements out of the way at the same time that they explore fields they are interested in so that they can decide on a major. Also, the introductory courses, which they need most, fill up the fastest. As if these difficulties were not enough, the computer looks at the courses freshmen and sophomores want to take only after the other half of the student body has had first pick of the best classes.

Three possible solutions could deal with the problem of not having enough classes. Only one, however, is realistic. First, we could enlarge class sizes. This would permit more students to get into the courses they wanted, although it would not solve the difficulty of the limited variety of classes available. Unfortunately, larger classes decrease the quality of education. It’s hard to discuss Paradise Lost effectively with a group of 75 students. Foreign language students would have less chance to speak in class. Each science student in a lab would have less time with her professor and would have to wait longer for attention. In teaching, a professor cannot interact effectively with 100 student faces in every lecture. Personal relationships would be sacrificed because of lack of contact. Larger classes would take away some of Davidson’s most precious virtues.

A second possibility: the professors Davidson already has could teach more classes. If there were fifty hours in a day instead of twenty-four, this proposal might work. As it is, professors already have to juggle preparing lectures, evaluating student work, helping advisees, attending committee meetings, keeping current on scholarship in their fields, researching and writing for publication, and managing numerous other miscellaneous jobs such as writing student recommendations. All this, of course, is in addition to maintaining their own personal and family lives and keeping what little sanity they have left. Adding a class...
