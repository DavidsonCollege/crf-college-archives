**Dr. Dobyns Conducts Y. M. C. A. Campaign**

Speaks to Numbers of Students on Topics of Personal Work, Bible Study, and Missions.

"I have three hobbies—Bible study, personal work, and Foreign Missions," declared Dr. W. R. Dobyns, of St. Joseph, Mo., in his sermon here last Sunday. For the past week, Dr. Dobyns has been conducting the Fall campaign at the Y. M. C. A., and his talks have centered around these three topics.

The question of Bible study he has discussed at morning prayers and has pointed out that this is the most up-to-date, most interesting book ever written. Although it was never intended to teach science nor to record history, still, says Dr. Dobyns, it never makes a scientific statement but what it is true, and many of the recent discoveries of archeologists have resulted from their following the directions contained therein. As to the inspiration of the Book, there can be no doubt, he says, if one will but give it a thorough study. And the arrangement of the books, while not inspired, were shown to be Providential.

For the special evening services, Dr. Dobyns has laid strong emphasis on the necessity for personal Christian work. In a series of forceful, earnest talks to a large number of the student body, he has shown that the members of the church are a “cloud of witnesses” whose duty it is to give testimony. And not only that, but with numerous telling illustrations and practical suggestions, he has shown how this testimony can and should be given, and how the greatest work of the church is accomplished through the personal contact of man with man.

The third topic, that of foreign missions, Dr. Dobyns reserved for his sermon on Sunday morning. In a clear, interesting, masterful way, he outlined the work abroad and showed the very great need for more laborers in the field. This is not only a vast opportunity, he said, but it is a responsibility. Then with a most eloquent appeal to the men of the South, the sons of noble sires who have never yet been found wanting in times of need, he laid this responsibility at the door of the students of Davidson College, beseeching them to meet it squarely and fairly.

Equally beautiful and impressive was Dr. Dobyns’ sermon in the evening on “Answered Prayer.” With touching illustrations from the dealings of a loving parent with a child, he showed that God always answers the prayers of His people, though sometimes the answer is deferred. Thus it was that Moses’ prayer to be allowed to cross over into the promised land, though apparently unanswered, was but deferred until a more suitable time. And fifteen hundred years later—which after all is but a day and a half according to the way God reckons time—this prayer was answered at the scene of the Transfiguration.

The meetings closed with the service Tuesday night, and those in charge are well pleased with the results, feeling that the message which Dr. Dobyns brought will not soon be forgotten.

**Golden Assists in Meetings**

The Davidson student body has been glad to welcome W. S. Golden (’13) back on the Hill for a week. Golden (Continued on page 4)

Among the Charlotte motorists who toured up Thursday were Misses Harriet Orr, Sarah Mosely, and Adelaide Mosely, and Messrs. McAlister Carson, P. E. Jones, and Woodrow McKay.

Mr. F. L. Toney, of Columbia, S. C., was a visitor here Sunday.

Mr. Clark Minter arrived here Saturday, where he will be for some time, before continuing his studies in chemistry.

Dr. and Mrs. A. C. Brenizer, of Charlotte, spent Sunday here with Dr. Harding.

**Dumas Discovers Human Skull**

A story, which has been current among Davidson students for several years and which by some was considered only a myth or a tradition, was partially verified Monday when W. A. Dumas descended to the base of the south column of Chambers and brought therefrom a human skull.

The descent, from the inner side of one of the cylindrical columns of Chambers, which is about fifty feet high and about six feet in diameter, is a difficult feat. However, Dumas, with a rope fastened securely about his body and with an electric searchlight in his hand, was safely let down by several of his comrades. A thorough search for the much-talked-of skeleton was made, and a skull, the only part of a skeleton that was visible, was brought to the top.

The story, as often related by the students, is that a whole skeleton was dropped into the column. This version of the story, however, must be erroneous, because had a whole skeleton been dropped into it, a thorough search would have revealed other parts, while the skull itself was in a perfect state of preservation. That the skull was deposited there by some student of the North Carolina Medical College when that institution was located at Davidson, there can be but little doubt, but as to the exact time and the circumstances, nothing definite is known. But no doubt there is some Davidson alumnus, now high up in the medical profession, who holds the key to the complete unraveling of the source of this story. If such there be, he has an opportunity to satiate the curiosity of many Davidson students.

A close examination of the skull shows that it had been exhaustively studied in the dissecting room. It had been divided laterally into two nearly equal parts, both parts showing visible evidences of the dissecting knife. Its thickness would indicate that it is a negro’s skull. This story is made even more interesting by reason of the fact that it is the source of an excellent poem in last year's annual entitled “Archibald Jones.” The skull which Dumas has found belongs to the “Archibald Jones” of that poem. It should be read the second time with keener appreciation.

**Basketball**

With the completion of the changes in the gymnasium, which give more floor space and better opportunity forPlay, an increased interest in basketball is noticeable both in the teams and in the student body generally. The rivalry has become keener and the rooting shows that the old-time Davidson “pep” has again entered into this branch of our college activities also. Practice began about two weeks ago when captains and managers were selected and calls were issued by the various classes for candidates. The regular schedule opened on last Friday, October 10, when the Freshman and Junior teams met. The Fresh proved a surprise. With the score against them at the beginning of the last half, they fought steadily uphill and won out by a score of 43-15. This game was followed after an interval of about half an hour by the game between the Seniors and Sophs, in which the former won easily 23-11. On Monday the Fresh and Seniors mixed it up fast and furiously during the whole of their game. At the conclusion of the first half the score stood 11-10 in favor of the Seniors. In the second half, however, the Freshies duplicated their feat of Friday's game, and succeeded in overcoming this lead and then forged ahead. The game ended in another victory for them by a count of 23-14. After half an hour's interval the Soph-Junior game took place. In this contest, the Sophs gradually piled up a comfortable score until the last few minutes of play. At this point, the Juniors made a remarkable spurt and things began to look dark for the Sophs. The whistle blew, however, before the long lead of the Sophs could be overcome, and they were returned the victors, the score being 28-24. The standing as a result of these games is: Freshmen 1.000, Sophs .500, Seniors .500, Juniors .000. The full schedule comprises twelve games, the concluding one to be played on November 6. The results of these first games have been decidedly favorable to the Fresh quintet, for they have the heaviest and tallest team in the contest, and at present appear to have a shade the better of the others. The Senior team is well balanced, has plenty of snap and spirit, and will, without doubt, make things lively for the other contenders. The Sophomores have a light team as compared with the others, but they make up for this in speed. The personnel of the Junior team is practically the same as last year’s five, and they are again putting up a good article of basketball. Judging from the standard of play, which has been set in the games already decided, the remaining ones will be well worth seeing and will be hotly contested throughout. It is to be hoped that the students themselves will back these teams and help to build up a good, snappy, fast Varsity five to represent Davidson in some inter-collegiate games this season. Plans are already being made for three or four games to be placed on the Hill and several at other colleges. Good news, yes, a real surprise, will be made known to every Davidson student in a few days. Watch for it. Why not go to see the Citadel game? This will most probably be the hardest and most evenly contested game played in the South this Fall. This is straight talk.

Citadel Meets Davidson; Charlotte, October 24. Citadel Reports a Strong Team and Good Game Is Expected. Davidson Confident. It has been several years since the Citadel and Davidson have clashed together in football, but for many years these teams have been rivals. The Citadel this fall, so reports given on good authority say, have one of the best teams which that institution has ever put out, and that statement means a great deal, for the Citadel has had some strong teams in the last half-dozen years. It will be a hard-fought game from start to finish. The financing of the game is in the hands of the Charlotte Athletic Association, which was formed several weeks ago. The probable Citadel line-up will be as follows: Bolton, Leo; Jeffords, Lt.; Alexander, Lg.; Hudgens, C.; Seaffe, Rg.; Sheppard, Rt.; Gill, Re.; Folger (Capt.), Fb.; Cogswell, Lh.; Switzer, Rh.; Weeks, Qb. The particular stars of this aggregation are Weeks, Folger, and Switzer, and to see them play is worth traveling miles, and the price of admission itself. To stop them, the “Red and Black Machine” has a hard task. Booth, one of the students who came to Davidson from the Citadel, says that the Citadel has a wonderful and powerful team.

DAVIDSON WALLOPS WOFFORD 86 TO 0. Davidson 86, Wofford 0, so the result of last Saturday's game reads. The “Red and Black Machine” of Coach Fetzer showed marked improvement over the previous Saturday with Newberry. Going into the game with the old Davidson fighting spirit, Davidson took the Wofford team off its feet. Though this is Wofford's first year at inter-collegiate football, yet for quite a number of years they have had class football. Their team is a promising one, for although more or less “green” and inexperienced, the material looks good and will most probably be developed by Head Coach McKay and his assistant, “Rip” Major, before the season is over. The Davidson team had little difficulty in scoring, and worked many plays. The interference was of superior class, and many long runs featured the game. Wofford was slightly at a disadvantage in having one or two disabled players. The long drawn-out game, briefly, went as follows: Davidson won the toss and received the kick-off. After a play or two, Laird made the first real gain, running for 25 yards around end, and after several gains, Wofford got the ball, but failed to gain even a yard on three downs, and the ball was in Davidson's possession after a punt out of bounds. Laird gained 6, Walker 6, Laird 5 yards, and then Walker scored the first touchdown in 6 minutes of play. McKinnon kicked goal. McKinnon kicked off, Melvin advanced 5 yards, and on second pass, no one being present to receive the pass, Austin recovered and scored the second touchdown. McKinnon kicked goal. After several advances and gains, Walker went through the line 15 yards for the third touchdown, and for the third time McKinnon kicked goal. Davidson 21, Wofford 0. The second quarter showed Davidson in still better form. Beautiful interference was given the runner on every play, and many forward passes were (Continued on page 4)
