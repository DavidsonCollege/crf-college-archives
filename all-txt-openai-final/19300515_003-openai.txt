### THE DAVIDSONIAN, MAY 15, 1930

**Journey's End**

During this week and the first part of next, all of Davidson’s athletic teams which have not already done so
will close their 1930 seasons. The varsity baseball nine plays its final contest this afternoon with Duke, following their two
games the early part of the week. The track team put away their togs about ten days after the state
track meet. The golfers have a match carded for Monday with N. C. State, which will be their last. The
tennis team closed its spring series of matches about two weeks ago.

All the freshman squads closed their schedules last week. The baseball and tennis teams played their last opponents Saturday, and
the track team had already had their last meet two weeks ago, except for those men who composed the relay
team at Greensboro. The only activity on the track during the last week or so has been the Sigma Delta
Psi contestants trying out in the various events.

**Sigma Delta Psi**

Speaking of Sigma Delta Psi, we feel that it is one of the best things that has been founded at
Davidson in quite a while. It is really an honorary fraternity that is active, and operates for the real good
of its members and everyone else on the campus. Although one may not be able to pass the requirements for
membership, the effort expended will certainly be worthwhile.

When Captain Pritchett first presented the fraternity to the student body last year, he pointed out that although none of
the qualifications were remarkably high, judged by record performances, yet anyone who could pass all of them was a good
all-around athlete. The truth of his statements has been borne out by the fact that there have been only three
men at Davidson who have become members, only one of whom is now in college. The interest of the students
in the organization is high. Over 75 men are trying out for it at present. Whether they make it or
not does not limit the value which it will do them, and for that reason the good of the fraternity
here at Davidson is increased. It is the only honorary fraternity which gives a distinct benefit to everyone who goes
out for it, whether they eventually become members or not.

**Wanted: More Dubs**

Mr. Grantland Rice, one of the foremost sportswriters of today, discusses rather fully in last week’s issue of Collier’s the
subject of a college man learning, while still in college, some sport which he can use when he gets into
business. Mr. Rice points out the fact that football, basketball, and other intercollegiate sports are limited almost wholly in their
play to colleges, and one who plays them alone will find himself lost when he seeks exercise and diversion from
his vocation. The advice and views of that authority are well worth listening to, and he has brought out a
fact that is very true. Businessmen go to the golf links today to get their exercise, and...

**Game With Blue Devils To End Wildcat Season**

**Six Regulars Play This Last Game for Davidson**

Today's game with Duke University terminates the present baseball season for the Davidson College nine. This encounter with the Blue
Devils marks the end of the season for the Wildcats in which they have won about half of the scheduled
games. All in all, considering the injuries sustained by some of Coach Monk Younger’s stars, the difficult schedule of the
Wildcats, and the inability to strike a successful stride during the season, a fairly good year is evident.

The Duke team is bringing with them today probably the strongest collegiate outfit in the South. Twenty victories mark their
busy season as fruitful, and under the direction of Coach Jack Coombs, former big league luminary, only a small proportion
of the games have been lost. The Blue Devils returned about two weeks ago from a northeastern trip where they
trounced many leading college nines. Four outstanding stars promise to be a menace to the Wildcat crew. Farley, Kistler, Warren,
and Werber are a group of sluggers who hit in the pinches. Jenkins, who will probably pitch today, is the
ace hurler of the Durham team. He is a southpaw, as is another star twirler on the Devil's squad, Lefty
Hawkins. Both are particularly stingy in offering hits. Werber and Jenkins are being sought after by major league scouts, which
is an indication of their diamond prowess. There is no doubt that a Davidson crowd will witness a splendid array
of baseball talent when the two teams begin the game.

Six men on the varsity squad will play their last game for Davidson today: “Bill” Parrish, “Irish” McInnis, “Whiz” Miller,
“Doc” Kugler, Captain “Happy” Gladstone, and “Doc” Henderson. Every one of the above names has performed brilliantly during their varsity
careers, and if any freshmen prospects are to supplant them, they must show real ability.

**Phi Gams Capture Basketball Trophy**

The Phi Gamma Delta fraternity defeated the Sigma Alpha Epsilon Fraternity in the finals of the inter-fraternity basketball tournament by
the score of 26-21. The Phi Gams by this victory receive the cup for the championship given...even to transact their
deals. More big jobs than one have been decided between the first tee and eighteenth—or nineteenth—green. A man who can
play a respectable game of golf will find it greatly to his advantage. And the same thing applies to tennis.
These two sports are probably the most popular on the Davidson campus. If you doubt it, try to get a
tennis court about four o'clock, or play a round of golf without dodging balls of two or three foursomes behind
you. The college has cooperated wonderfully in the construction of 14 tennis courts, and in laying out and maintaining a
golf course which, though it will never be selected for a national championship, still affords excellent training ground for divot
diggers.

“Doc” Kugler Blanks Blue Devils, 5 to 0
Wildcats Play Errorless Ball and Hit in the Pinches

Behind the excellent pitching of Capt. “Doc” Kugler, the Davidson Wildcats were able to hand the Duke Blue Devils their
first shut-out in three years of play. The ’Cats made eight hits count for five runs in their 5 to
0 victory. The Duke nine was completely baffled by the slants of Kugler. Werber and Rochelle were the only Duke
batters to get more than one safe blow. McInnis was the hitting feature of the day, getting three safe blows
out of five attempts. Box score and summary:

State Secures Van Liew To Succeed Gus Tebell

When Davidson lines up against the N. C. Wolfpack next fall in Greensboro they will probably be matching brains and
brawn with the highly touted Rockne system. For North Carolina State College officials have recently named John Van Liew as
successor to Gus Tebell as head football coach. The newly named coach, although nothing definite has been stated, is known
to be familiar with the Notre Dame style and moreover Dr. Ray Sermon, director of athletics at State, has been
casting some sly hints in that direction. Van Liew comes to State with the backing of years of experience, having
attended Grinnell College in Iowa and besides his coaching duties at Knox College in Illinois and Western State College in
Colorado has coached scholastic teams in Des Moines, his native city, and Champaign. During the past year he has been
director of athletics in Peru for the Peruvian Government. Van Liew will assume his duties next fall.
