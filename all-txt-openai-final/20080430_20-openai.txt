Record-breaking lacrosse victorious on Senior Day

The women’s lacrosse team capped off a record-setting season with a near-record 22-4 win over Howard in the season finale
on Saturday at Richardson Stadium. The 22-goal total was only one shy of the school record for goals in a
game, and the 18-goal victory was the ’Cats' largest margin of victory in a season of unprecedented success for the
Davidson program.

Haley Cook ’10 gave the Wildcats the early advantage by netting the ball less than a minute into the contest
off a pass from Sara Walter ’08. Minutes later Walter and Cook connected again to extend the Davidson lead to
2-0. Becky Horton ’09 and Emily Diefendorf ’08 also added early goals and Cook notched the third of her four
goals at the 21:13 mark to push the ’Cats' early lead to 5-0. Howard finally got on the board at
the 20:24 mark to cut the deficit to 5-1, but the Wildcats countered with goals by Jen Crawford ’10 and
Kate McDonald ’08 to push the Davidson lead back up to 7-1. The Bison scored once more to make the
score 7-2, but that was as close as they would get on the afternoon. The goal would be Howard’s last
of the first half.

The score sparked a barrage of goals by the Wildcats. Goals by Callie Seymour ’09, Diefendorf, Heather Frohman ’09, Jen
Crawford ’10, Walter, Claire O’Shea ’09 and two by Emily Palmer ’08 broke open the game as the ’Cats held
a commanding 15-2 advantage at halftime.

The Wildcats continued the clinic in the second half. The Bison and Wildcats traded goals early in the action, but
it was not long before Davidson extended their enormous lead to 20-3. Howard was able to muster one last goal
at the 5:45 mark, but Walter and Kelly Finnigan added a pair of late goals to put the exclamation point
on the ’Cats’ 22-4 blowout victory and their record-breaking season.

Prior to the game, the Wildcats honored their seven seniors, and they celebrated their final game with an outstanding performance
collectively. It was only fitting the seniors combined for 10 of the ’Cats’ 22 goals and also added six assists.
Walter and Palmer led the way with three goals apiece while Diefendorf added two, and McDonald and Finnigan each scored
once.

Anna Mitchell ’08 was the lone Wildcat senior field player not to score in the game, but she made her
presence felt on the defensive end. Mitchell, the defensive captain, turned in another spectacular performance on Saturday afternoon as she
picked up two draw controls, caused two turnovers and had one groundball. Her impressive performance mirrored the effort she has
given the entire season as she finished the season with a team-best 37 groundballs and 23 caused turnovers.

Finally, goalie Laura Johnson ’08 concluded her career with her school-record 11th win of the 2008 season after notching three
saves against the Bison. Johnson finishes her career fourth on Davidson’s all-time saves list with 358 career saves. In addition
to her personal-best 127 saves this season, she set a new single-season record with an 8.79 goals against average.

Johnson’s records were not the only ones set by the ’Cats in their historic season. With the win, the Wildcats
finish with an 11-5 final season record. The 11 victories and .688 win percentage both set new Davidson single-season records
as they top the 1999 and 2006 seasons, which both saw the ’Cats finish 9-7. Earlier in the season, the
team also made history with a school-record, six-game winning streak.

The Wildcat defense allowed just 143 goals on the season, which broke the Davidson record set just last year when
the ’Cats allowed only 146 goals. Offensively, four players scored 30 or more goals led by Crawford who netted a
team-high 36 goals in the 2008 season. Diefendorf scored 34 goals, Cook scored 33 and Horton added 30 to join
Crawford in the 30-goal club. With three of their top four scorers returning for the 2009 campaign, the ’Cats are
poised to build on their record-breaking 2008 season and continue their success into 2009.

Baseball slides down the conference ranks

The week began with a heartbreaker against theThe saga that is the Davidson Wildcat baseball season took a turn for
the worse last week, as the Wildcats dropped an 8-7 decision to Duke on Wednesday before losing to Appalachian State
by scores of 10-5, 8-7, and 5-4 over the weekend.

Matt Webb '09 had two hits for the 'Cats in their 5-4 loss to Appalachian State on Sunday.

**Player of the Week: Brett Shore '09 (Baseball)**

Last week, Shore led the Wildcats’ offense as his batting average for the week was .667 after going 10-15 with
four walks and five runs scored in games against Duke and Appalachian State. Shore is currently hitting .320 on the
season for the 'Cats, including .338 in Southern Conference play.

“We’re coming very close, close enough for one play to win us the game.” — Danny Weiss ’11

Unfortunately for the Wildcats, the Blue Devils began creeping back into the game with the aid of five Davidson errors.
Duke tied the game in the sixth on Nate Freeman’s RBI single and took the lead on Jake Lemmerman’s RBI
single off Mike Frongello ’11 in the top of the ninth.

Blue Devils pitchers Grant Monroe, John Bunder, Ryan Perry, and Alex Hassan combined to shut Davidson out over the final
eight innings, with Hassan getting the win after recording the final four outs. Frongello took the loss for the Wildcats.

Davidson was unable to recover in time for its weekend trip to the mountains to face the Mountaineers. The Wildcats
trailed 8-1 on Friday before rallying to make the score more respectable at the end. Sam Payne '11 led the
Davidson attack by going 3-4 with two RBIs. Thomas Middour '10 gave up eight runs on nine hits in 4
2/3 innings to take the loss.

The Mountaineer dominance appeared ready to extend to a second game, as they took an 8-5 lead into the top
of the ninth.

**Play of the Week**

Davidson displayed a strong sense of resiliency, however, and rallied to pull within a run with the bases loaded. Danny
Weiss '11 was struck out by Garret Sherrill to stifle the rally. Brett Shore '09 led Davidson at the plate
by going 3-3 and scoring twice. Chris Kennedy '10 was forced to take the loss after giving up six runs
on four hits and four walks in two innings.

The end of the series saw more fight from the Wildcats, but the same result. Davidson led 3-1 in the
top of the third after Weiss’ two-RBI single. The Mountaineers claimed a 5-3 lead on the strength of Brett Stewart’s
home run in the home half of the inning. Weiss added another RBI single in the fifth to account for
the final margin. Aubrey Evens got the decision for Appalachian State after going eight innings and giving up seven hits
and four runs. Brant West '08 got the loss for the Wildcats after giving up five runs on seven hits
in four innings. Andy Bass '11 and Matt Sliwiak '11 each pitched two shutout innings in relief to keep Davidson
close.

“I feel like we played well enough to win this weekend,” Weiss said. “I feel like our young bullpen really
stepped up and kept us in it late in the game on Saturday and Sunday. We’re coming very close, close
enough for one play to win us the game. When we play near error-free baseball like we did on Saturday
and Sunday, we will have a chance to win.”

The losses drop the Wildcats to 10-28, 2-16 with eleven games remaining. Weiss added, “As we go on the road
for our last few series, we need to relax and find ways to play solid baseball by playing good defense
and manufacturing runs. I think if we can do those things, we’ll be poised to make a run going into
the tournament.”

**Burns Concludes SoCon Career With Two Distance Wins**

36:56.24. She followed up that victory by claiming the individual title in the 5,000 meters on Sunday with a time
