Music News

By Frank Barr

Before Christmas, a petition sponsored by Phi Mu Alpha was passed through the student body. The petition was a huge success in that the concert series admission comes out of the tuition. This may not sound like a very large accomplishment but it will mean a lot better concert series on the campus.

In a recent meeting of the Phi Mu Alpha, G.P. Whitley was elected president to replace Mel Winstead who resigned several weeks ago. Bob Freeman was elected to serve as secretary in the absence of Harry McLean who left school for the armed service.

Plans are under way for the opening of Phi hall each afternoon for an hour or so before supper. On Saturday and Sunday afternoons we hope to make the records available for several hours. Some members of Phi Mu Alpha will be on hand whenever the records are made available to the students.

The members of the band are in for a big treat at Converse on March 23. The band will be the guest of Converse College at supper. That evening they will play a concert as a climax to the Converse Music Festival. After the concert the fair ladies of Converse will treat the band members at a dance — a nice reward for their work.

On March 1, the band gave a concert in Salisbury before a group of high school students who had been asked to Salisbury as members of the All-State Band. Later in the spring, the band and glee club will each make a concert tour. They will be keeping up the reputation of previous Davidson organizations.

dents and faculty members will become an acute problem before next September,” said President Cunningham. The suggestion of building brick homes and additional dormitory space is therefore before our grounds and building committee and finance committee at this time.”

In concluding this report, President Cunningham spoke of the prominent place which religious life occupies on the Davidson campus, and referred to the ever-increasing emphasis being placed upon Christian ideals. “At the heart of the campus life in its every expression, as well as in its outlook upon the world, the Christian principle must dominate.”
