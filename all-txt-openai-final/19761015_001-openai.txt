Four years after coeducation began at Davidson, Title IX, with evaluation procedures and legal means of counteracting discrimination, has been
put into effect. Title IX will have several effects on campus, according to Assistant Dean of Students Mary Lou Dietler;
the program will serve as a guide for evaluating coeducation, a legal means for reporting discrimination, a tool for increasing
the community’s awareness of discrimination, and an education process.

Coeducation came into effect with the '73-74 academic year. "Generally some people were happy about it," said former Union President
Richard Wassen. "We didn’t know what to expect." A few people were mad about it, but they were a minority.
There was a minority strongly for it, but most students were apathetic about it," he said.

The campus has changed both socially and educationally since women were admitted, according to Wassen. He thinks the men function
more securely socially without women on campus because "it’s difficult to carry on a relationship with the pressure here. Before
coeducation you didn’t have to see the other person all the time."

"We were sort of naive, thinking women were objects to be dated on weekends, but that has been disproven now
since women are on campus," Wassen said. He said that the men felt pressure to date on weekends, and "If
you didn’t have a car and money you had yourself and that was it. Now you can date someone here."

"I definitely think (the social pattern) is more relaxed, more natural, something you don’t worry about anymore, since the women
came," he said.

The women improved the educational opportunities on campus, according to Wassen. "I remember some of my classes; I was glad
to have women in there because they were sharp and they added a new viewpoint, a new dimension," he said.

### Eating Club? ‘Institutional’ Dorms Need Renovation, Future Plans Anticipate Only ‘Updating’

By PHILIP DUNCAN
Asst. News Editor

Davidson College has no plans to build a new student housing facility. If the quality of on-campus living is to
be upgraded, improvement of existing dormitories is the only alternative. "It seems that almost everyone has a plan for how
we should renovate the dorms," said Director of the Physical Plant Grover C. Meetze, Jr. "I’m sympathetic with the desire
to get away from the institutional look of our dorms, but the school’s policy does not call for any major
renovations in the future," he said.

Director of Student Housing Scotty Nicholls presented her ideas for renovation to Meetze in the late sixties. She does not
remember all the details of her proposal now, but recalled that "it provided for a breaking up of the long
corridors, thereby dividing halls into smaller blocks of rooms. Bathrooms were to be enlarged and a common-use study-typing room provided
for each block. The renovation would have cut two students’ rooms from each floor, I believe.

"Thinning out the population in the dorms is the essential step towards making them a better place to live," she
said. "Because of the crowded housing situation and the impossibility of new construction, there are no prospects for the type
of renovation that would displace students now in the dorms," said Business Manager Robert A. Currie. "If the push for
housing on-campus were to ease, I assume that in the next year’s budget, funds would...

RUSK HOUSE—Davidson’s newest

A forecast of overcrowded conditions in the existing fraternities and eating houses is...be set aside to begin work on the
most important improvement priority,” said Currie.

“In the late sixties we made some cosmetic changes, ‘plastic surgery’, I guess you would call it, in Watts, Cannon,
and Sentelle,” said Nicholls. “We put in new furniture, lighting fixtures, flooring, closets, door frames and doors, and added lounges
in each dorm.

“But I don’t think this effort could be called anything other than an updating. There certainly was no major renovation.”

“There are certain human needs that must be met,” commented Nicholls. “There should be space for students to relax outside
of their rooms.

“We are fortunate to have a spacious student union, a good-sized library and living room areas in the eating houses.
Many private colleges don’t enjoy those advantages.

“I think it’s evident that priorities have been placed in other areas besides housing. I guess it’s just a matter
of where a college wants to put its emphasis—and who controls the purse-strings,” stated Nicholls.

Future improvements of the dorms will follow the lines of the sixties’ “updating.” Meetze says that the electrical systems in
the dorms are inadequate. “Hardly a weekend goes by without someone calling to tell me that their power has gone
out.

“I usually find that four rooms are conducting a ‘community cook-in’ with toaster ovens, hot plates, popcorn poppers, you name
it.

“I know that sort of thing is against regulations, but the fact is that students today with their hair-dryers and
other appliances need more power than the wiring can provide.

“The transition will be expensive, but soon we'll have to increase the capacity of the wiring.”

College ponders opening Rusk to new eating group

by Lynn Langley and Carter Todd

An SGA committee headed by Lynn Langley and Carter Todd is already working to accumulate the freshman support necessary for
an attempt to open a new house. The committee will be circulating a petition sometime in the near future to
ascertain if the interest is there.

Will Terry, Dean of Students, commented on the subject, “The whole matter is in the preliminary stages. It’s an expensive
proposition; it will take some real commitment in terms of the participants’ willingness to commit themselves for at least a
year. Its success will depend upon good financial management. It will need, I think, at least sixty people to make
it. In spite of all these difficulties, a house like this is badly needed in light of the space problems
at other fraternities and eating houses.

“One of the real questions that the college will have to decide will be how much money they’ll be willing
to put in to provide furniture and other amenities that go into a good social program. A good social program
is an essential ingredient to the success of such a house. We're not interested in a trough.” [see RUSK, page
