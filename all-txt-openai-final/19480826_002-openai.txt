It is with mingled emotions
that we "put the baby to bed" for
the last time this Summer. We know
we contributed nothing to journalism

but we can't help but feel that the

YLDCT has contributed to the
unity of the summer school student
body—we hope it has won a permanent
place in the summer campus
life.

I would like to thank Bob Coble
and Joe Vance for contributing
their time and support.
McLean goes "thanks" for handling
the mechanics—the "backstage"
work. It's been a real pleasure
to have worked with these fellows
on so worthy a project.

The YLDCT would like to take
this opportunity to bid Bill McLean
a fond "Adieu". Bill has served
the "Y" well in every field of its
varied activities and by his
ability to befriend all, has brought
it closer to the students. I think

time are found in the Wildcat Hand-
book of 1948-49 in the dedication
to him.

"He has proven himself great
among us by being the servant of
us all. His Christian character
has been an uplifting example to
every member of the College Com-
munity. He has led the YMCA ener-
getically and well. He is a wise
counselor and a good friend."
