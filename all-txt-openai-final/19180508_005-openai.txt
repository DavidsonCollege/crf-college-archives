Pat writes as follows: “This is a wonderful country and I am glad I am here. Men are in fine spirits. Will have lots of funny things to tell you when I get back to the U. S. A. Best wishes to old D. C.” In another part of the card we have evidence that ‘Pat’ has not gone back on his training, and he will probably be quite famous with the ladies in Wareham—Pat has been promoted to the rank of Sergeant. Below is given a copy of the card which the Mayor of Wareham has gotten out:

“Americans and comrades-in-arms for Liberty:

“We give you a hearty welcome to this, one of the most ancient towns of the realm, on your way to win a victory for civilization.

“You who share with us the glories of Shakespeare and Milton, whose love of liberty and righteousness has been nurtured by the same Bible in the same tongue, do not come amongst us as strangers, but as brothers.”

And so on. Alas, for the horrors of war.

S. A. Robinson, '00, has recently been elected to the position of trusteeship of Davidson. He is a prominent business man of Gastonia and represents Kings Mountain Presbytery.

MARKER FOR GRAVE OF GEN. DAVIDSON ASSURED

Dr. Charles L. Summers, of Winston-Salem, Professor of Clinical Pediatrics and visiting pediatrician of the University Hospital by the faculty of Physics of the University of Maryland School of Medicine and has entered upon his duties.

The North Carolina Historical Society offered to donate $100 for the purpose of placing a marker at the grave of the Revolutionary hero, who was buried at Hopewell Church, and for whom Davidson College was named, Gen. William Lee Davidson. The condition made was that $100 would be raised in the community, and this condition has been generously met by Mr. E. L. B. Davidson, of Charlotte, who is not a relative of General Davidson, but is much interested in having his grave properly marked. The Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution has kindly agreed to take charge of the matter, and will if possible secure at least $200 more in order that a worthy stone may be placed on his grave. The time limit named by the Historical Society in which the work must be completed is November 1, 1918. Mr. J. D. Sargent, of Mt. Airy, has offered a granite slab for the purpose, in case that material is selected by the committee having the matter in charge.

* * *

Rev. W. M. Baker, ‘10, who for a number of years has been in Wilmington, engaged in colored mission work, has accepted a call and entered upon his work as pastor of the Presbyterian Church at Mount Olive.

* * *

Rev. J. C. Purcell, ’05, has accepted a call to the First Presbyterian Church of Chester, S. C.

* * *

Davidson is proud to be the alma mater of nearly three hundred ministers of the Gospel, three of these being in other denominations than the Presbyterian. This group is further classified as having twenty-six on the foreign field and twenty-nine in home mission work. She is also proud of having trained thirty colleges, university or theological seminary presidents and eighty-three professors in similar institutions.

The first floor, north wing Chambers, is historic as being the location of the room occupied by Woodrow Wilson. Davidson has been honored by having the greatest man in the world within her walls.

DAVIDSON ALUMNI!

Company Attention! Forward March Back to the Hill for Davidson's eighty-first annualCommencement. Consider the program that appears in other columns of this paper and prepare to arrive in time for the opening exercises and expect to leave your business long enough to stay to the end. The date is May 26 to 29, three days of genuine college life. As usual, the alumni are expected to play a large part in the festivities, and the annual meeting of the Alumni Association will be held. Officers will be elected at this meeting and other matters of business transacted, and, as usual, a banquet will be held. This is the year for the reunion of classes 1893, 1898, 1903, 1908, and 1913. All members of these classes are especially urged to make every effort possible to be present. All members of other classes are cordially invited. Alumni will be interested to inspect the new gymnasium that has been erected with funds donated by them. Other things have been done, and will be done before the last day of commencement rolls by. Davidson awaits the return of her sons. Come one! Come all! May 26 to 29!

Her walls and on her campus, both as a student and as a distinguished visitor. This was some while ago, May 20, 1916, in fact. As he found an enthusiastic student body then, so is it now. It is estimated that at least fifty men who would be in college, were it not for the war, are now patriotically serving their country, to say nothing of the new men who did not enter in the fall because of the war. The present Senior class will give twenty-six more just after commencement and altogether there are well over four hundred known to be in service from the ranks of Davidson alumni.

When some careful reader discovered that the editor of the Hollins Magazine, published by a girl’s school in Virginia, was edited by “Leslie Patterson,” they began to suspect that “Pat,” ex-'18, of commissary and 118-page letter fame, had not really gone to the war to make the world safe for democracy. But all these base insinuations have now been laid in forgotten dust by the receipt of a card from Pat himself. He is now in the famous town of Wareham, England.

WILSON’S DAYS AT DAVIDSON. William Bayard Hale in his book, “Woodrow Wilson—the Story of His Life,” gives some interesting information about Davidson in 1873, the date of Wilson’s entrance. The following is a brief summary. Hale refers to Davidson at this time as a “staunch school, an excellent college of stout Presbyterian proclivities.” “The central building,” he says, “stood in the midst of an unkempt field and was a building of considerable nobility, with a rotunda and dome and two side wings.” He refers to the fact that the “long corridor ran through the length of the building—much to the detriment of discipline.” “Primitive” living was the term used to describe the daily life of the students, the students looking after their own rooms entirely. Reference is made to the record held by Tom Wilson, namely, that of dressing and reaching chapel in the minimum time. Davidson then was a small village. The names of Squire Allison and John Scofield were mentioned as the keepers of two grocery stores. “Instruction at Davidson was rather better than was common at small colleges in those days,” says the author. “Still it can hardly be said that Wilson received much intellectual impulse here, although he probably added something to his stock of knowledge.” Ex-Gov. R. B. Glenn was one of Wilson's classmates, as was also Thornton Whaling of Columbia Seminary. Wilson was described by his classmates as an open-faced student with pleasing manners and was very generally liked. He was never much in the athletics of his day which consisted of baseball and “shinny.” He did not make the college nine, although he impressed the captain as being rather lazy. He was a great walker and a great talker in congenial company. While at Davidson he was a member of the Eumenean Literary Society and received a vote of thanks from that body for copying their constitution for them. Wilson planted his tree on the campus and this remains today and is pointed out as Woodrow Wilson’s tree. Becoming sick just before examinations it was necessary for him to withdraw from college and he went to Wilmington, where his father had accepted the pastorate of the First Presbyterian Church. A year of recuperation fitted him for Princeton, where he finished his education, entering that institution in 1876. Woodrow Wilson attended Davidson with the class of ’77, being here during the year 1873-74.

LETTER FROM CAMP GREENE. Headquarters Camp Greene, Charlotte, N. C., April 27, 1918:

Miss Cornelia Shaw, Librarian, Davidson College, Davidson, N. C.

My dear Miss Shaw:

The commanding general directs me to acknowledge receipt of a gift of two boxes of books received through you, from Davidson. The books have been turned over to the American Library Association representatives at this camp, and are available for use by this entire command. The commanding general wishes me to express to you his personal thanks, and the thanks of the many troops at this station, for your thoughtfulness and generosity in making this gift. While a soldier’s life in these strenuous times, is necessarily filled with hard physical labor, we all appreciate the great value of a diversion in the form of good clean reading. Hoping you will express the commanding general’s thanks and appreciation to all the donors of Davidson, I am

Yours sincerely,

(Phelps Newberry), Major, Signal Corps, Camp Adjt.
