A NEW INSTITUTION

Just as the Honor System, the symbolism of the columns of old Chambers, the Wildcat spirit, and many other traditions
are institutions, so has the Student Store, in its three years of existence, become a typical Davidson institution.

Owned and operated by the Student Body, it serves the entire campus. The profits are being accumulated to be used,
in the future, for the same worthy projects, while it also helps support the Athletic Association and supports the Student
Government financially.

We extend to the returning Alumni a most cordial invitation to visit us and give the managers any suggestions they
may have.
