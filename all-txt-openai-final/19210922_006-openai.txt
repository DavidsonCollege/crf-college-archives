Designing College Annuals

With our Art Service, equipment, and facilities we are prepared to produce the Best in College Annuals. The art work,
including border designs, page groupings, etc., in Annuals produced by us, is the work of our Art Department. We design,
print, and bind the entire job in our own plant and through our Layout Department can submit ideas in the
most effective manner. No matter what the price, the purchaser is always proud of the work. Expert workmanship coupled with
rare business service guarantees entire satisfaction.

PRESBYTERIAN STANDARD PUBLISHING CO.
CHARLOTTE, N. CAROLINA

The enthusiastic reception by the student body and faculty of the Annual warrants the commendation it received. The changes made
in “The Edelweiss” have standardized that book, and we feel for several years to come it will be modeled along
the same lines. We wish to thank you and your workmen personally for the interest shown and suggestions offered, especially
in the effective arrangement of the engraving work through your art department. We take great pleasure in recommending you to
next year’s staff.

Sincerely yours,
HELEN JOHNSON, Editor-in-Chief.
HESSIE BOGER, Business Manager.

A Satisfied Customer is an Asset to Any Business

We strive to give our customers the best in Quality, Service, and Price, but we do not make an effort
to lower the standard of either. How well we succeed is attested to by the character of our clientele and
the unsolicited praise they favor us with when the finished product is delivered. Below are two of the many expressions
of our satisfied patrons:

May 27, 1921.
Mr. A. M. Gray,
Presbyterian Standard Publishing Company,
Charlotte, N.C.

Dear Sir:

As Editor-in-Chief of “The White Heather” I want to take this opportunity to tell you how pleased we are with
the Annual which you published for us. Not only are we pleased with the excellent workmanship displayed in the book,
but we are grateful to you for your personal interest, also for your holding to your contract prices when we
were unable, much to our regret, to fulfill our part. I am sure that the Student Body will agree with
me in saying that as far as Art Work is concerned, “The White Heather” is far ahead of most College
Annuals, and I shall take great pleasure in recommending you to the Staff for next year.

Yours very truly,
MARY POOLE, Editor-in-Chief.

Raeford, N. C., Aug. 15, 1921.

planning of the first Annual.
