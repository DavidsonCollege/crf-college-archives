Meet the Candidates for SGA

WHY I WANT TO BE PRESIDENT:
“What does SGA do?” That’s a question that I’m glad to answer, but I hate to hear. The Student Government is persistently working to improve Davidson for the students, but we are only taking baby steps. I would like to see the SGA move in a new direction. Student Government should be willing to work harder and take more risks, undertaking original initiatives that affect more students. In the last term, I’ve seen the SGA develop strong skills in working with the administration to improve the framework of the institution. We worked to improve the Honor Code, Lottery, and ATC allocations, etc. Still, SGA has twenty-five hundred dollars sitting in its “special projects fund,” the account that is intended to field original ideas for SGA initiatives. If elected, I plan to rekindle the spirit that gave rise to the competitive battle for access to those funds to finance good ideas. More ideas mean a greater chance of new programs that students will care about and a well-rounded SGA. Students should not have to wonder, “What does SGA do?”

Charles Washington ’04
Major: Political Science
Activities:
- Yearbook
- Intramural Sports
- SGA Vice-President

WHY I WANT TO BE VICE-PRESIDENT:
“Somewhere between the library, Patterson Court, Chambers, and the Union, I have found myself part of a unique community. Amid athletics, theatre, hiking trips, art, religious studies, and community service, each person can find their niche at Davidson. I understand that Davidson students find a variety of different activities and commitments meaningful to them. I hope to promote all of these through my own niche, which is SGA. Davidson is more than a resume builder for students, as SGA is more than that for me. My vision of SGA is an association representing all individuals and organizations. If elected, I will make every effort to ensure that SGA is a forum through which student concerns from all corners of campus are addressed.”

Katharine Hubbard ’05
Major: Undeclared
Activities:
- Sophomore Class Senator
- Freshman Class Senator
- Davidson Ambassador
- Orientation Team Leader
- Connor Eating House

WHY I WANT TO BE PRESIDENT:
“I am running for the position of SGA President because I feel as though the issue of the importance of ‘community’ is one of the foremost issues on campus today, which is why I plan to put community-building measures at the top of my campaign platform. For a school of this size, I don’t think we’re as close as we should be and I think that more should be done to improve unity here in the Davidson College community. This can be done by promoting tolerance and embracing differences of others and learning from those differences. When we accomplish this goal, then we can go out as students and citizens of the Davidson community and make a difference by promoting a sense of unity between the college and the town and improving community relations between the two.”

Mare Vinson ’05
Majors: English and Sociology
Activities:
- Independent Senator
- Member, Educational Policy Committee
- Trustee Contact Committee
- Committee on the Honor Code and Code of Responsibility

WHY I WANT TO BE VICE-PRESIDENT:
“I am running to maintain bidirectional communication between students and administration regarding issues relevant to students and the Davidson College community. Effective communication is perhaps the most important contributor to effective proactive responses to concerns. I am also running to maintain the SGA’s record of accomplishment of initiating challenges to important practices, policies, and norms that we can improve. Simultaneously, I am running to continue the SGA’s practice of evaluating such policies to not only reveal the weaknesses that the SGA can work to improve, but to also indicate and commend the many strengths of our college’s systems.”

Elisabeth Smith ’04

- Club Tennis Team

Union Board President

WHY I WANT TO BE PRESIDENT:
“I am running for Union Board President because, quite frankly, I’ve had it up to here with these three-letter acronym groups, RLO, SGA, UCA, JSU, and I want to work with a group that isn’t afraid to use its full name. But seriously, I am running because with the experience that I have had in working with the Union Board, I get the feeling that accomplishing things is a lot less like pulling teeth. I feel like everyone involved with the Union Board wants to get things done and they always do it with a smile, which is very important in my book. As far as things that I would like to accomplish should I get elected, I would like to try to further bring the campus together. Hence, the name union in Union Board. Furthermore, it would be great to continue the current trend of great performing arts coming to Davidson.”

Adam Sperling ’04
Major: Math
Activities:
- Wrestling, SAAC
- Jewish Student Union
- UCA (Davidson-Cure Autism Now, Kappa Sigma, Concert Committee)
- Junior Class President
- Freshman Hall Counselor

WHY I WANT TO BE PRESIDENT:
“Since the opening of the Alvarez College Union, we have been given the responsibility to ignite our Union Board program, producing events to entice a range of Davidson students. I believe that we have more than exceeded initial expectations with respect to the actual events, but there is still a need for increased publicity. If you don’t know what is going on, then we haven’t done our job. The Union Board thrives on the ingenuity of its student volunteers, those impassioned by attending past events. I look forward to cultivating the tradition and inherent potential of our Davidson community.”
