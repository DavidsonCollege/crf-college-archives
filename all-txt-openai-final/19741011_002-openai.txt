### Sexuality Seminar Stresses Rational Decision Making
By BRUCE MALOY
Staff Writer

Davidson students and members of the community will have a chance to learn about the field of human sexuality through
a symposium which is being held on campus Oct. 11 and 12. Karl Goodhouse, who began studying the field of
human sexuality last year as part of an Extended Studies project, said, “The purpose of the symposium is to get
factual information to students to aid them in making rational sexual decisions.” Goodhouse pointed out that the symposium will cover
more than sex and will include the areas of physiology, sexual expression, human sexual relations, and ethical and religious considerations.
Speakers have been invited to discuss each of these four areas.

### Registration Solves Late Book Problems
By MARK GERGEN
Staff Writer

Registration began for the Winter term on Monday, the 19th day of the Fall term. Next term it will begin
on Dec. 9, the sixth day of Winter term and the last day of drop/add. Course registration for this year’s
winter term ends on Oct. 17, over six weeks before the actual beginning of the winter term. Spring term registration
will end on Dec. 18, 12 weeks before the start of the term. Registrar Richard C. Burts Jr. explained that,
“this is the traditional length of time. The real reason for this early registration is the student store.” Director of
the Student Store Peter Nichols explained the need for time. “It takes three weeks for a book to get here,
plus preparation and typing of the orders. And after the books get here we then need more time to put
them on the shelves. In total, this would require four weeks, and then to be on the safe side, we
need another two weeks. This is in case the books requested aren’t available,” Nichols explained. Burts said that his office
could actually process the registration data within two days after it has been received.

According to Nichols, preordering is undesirable for two reasons. First is the inability to accurately predict student demands by past
course preferences. Second is the overall increased cost. “If we do prestock, what courses do we choose to order at
the limit. Prediction won’t work because of change in demands. For example, last year the Classics course only had five
students in one term, the next term it had 20, there is no way to predict this,” Nichols explained. Nichols
went on to say that there is no direct financial cost of preordering but that it does raise the overall
cost of the books since companies must take losses on preordered books that are returned and can’t be used. Burts
explained that, “this early registration is because the student store would conflict with other schools with its orders if we
waited till after Christmas.” “We didn’t ask for this early of a date, but it’s nice to have it though,”
Nichols said. He went on to explain that the point of conflicting with other orders could be a problem, and
that, “this early registration helps the student since it makes it easier for us to get the books that are
needed.”

“I expect that each person will talk on his specialty, and that the others will then respond in a sort
of panel discussion,” said Goodhouse. Three of the main speakers at the symposium will be Harold Minor, a consultant in
family relations and human sexuality, Mike Pasternak, a professor from UNC-C who will speak on values clarification and Behavioral Sciences,
and Training Coordinator Tom Clark of Bowman-Gray School of Medicine. The symposium will begin at 3:30 p.m. on Friday and
run until 10 p.m. with a break for supper. Rusk House has been reserved for those wishing to meet and
talk with the speakers and others that participate in the symposium. The symposium will continue at 10 a.m. on Saturday
and run until 4 p.m. with a break for lunch, perhaps in the form of a picnic. “A large part
of the symposium will be allotted for small group discussions led by doctors, faculty members, and people from Planned Parenthood,”
explained Goodhouse. The symposium is the first part of a program to provide information on human sexuality. Dean of Students
Will H. Terry said plans are being discussed to organize sexual counseling on campus to find who is available and
what special skills or knowledge they can contribute.Mandate from the trustees approved six years ago stating that the college should
"counsel in drug, alcohol and sex problems." The culmination of the increased awareness which the symposium organizers hope to foster
may be a course in human sexuality as part of the regular curriculum. Goodhouse and Phil Safriet wrote a syllabus
for such a (See CONFERENCE, p. 12)

Davidson Notes Compiled by BILL ELLETT

"Black Americans: Their History, Culture, Achievements and Literature" is a bibliography of books and serials in the college library relating
to Black Americans. Compiled by the reference department with the help of Work-Study students, it is a selective listing of
around 1000 items, about two-thirds of the library’s collection in those areas. Copies are available at the library reference desk.

Gougers: One year after finding six Charlotte banks in violation of the Truth-in-Lending law, Davidson’s NC-PIRG, in a survey of
123 offices of the same banks, has found that all are now in compliance with the letter of the law.
Chapter Chairman Mac McKeithen said, "While commending banks for correcting their illegal actions of last year, we urge further changes
in bank policies in favor of the consumer."

Ghouls: The college’s Fall Blood Drive will be held this Thursday from 10 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. in Chambers Banquet
Hall. The Red Cross will once again be on hand to extract the blood. According to Blood Drive Chairman Bob
Corlew, this year’s goal is 433 pints, which would cover the entire college community. The term’s goal is 219. This
is the 25th year of ROTC sponsorship for the drive.

Gals & Gents: According to Registrar Richard C. Burts Jr., the college’s goal of 1200 students for this year has
been met. With the addition of a freshman class of 339, total college enrollment has reached 1217. In accordance with
the trustees’ decision to maintain a male population of 1000 while growing coeducational, there are 1005 males and 212 females.
This is approximately a 5 to 1 ratio.

Growing Girls: "Growing Up Female," a video tape presentation, is playing at the union nightly through Sunday with continuous showings.
"Pigs vs. Freaks" will start Monday.

Grown Girl: The Madeline Brown Group will be featured in the union’s first Hungry I presentation of the year this
weekend. Backed up by piano, bass and drums, Brown has what it takes to belt out a gutsy or a
delicate song. With her wide range of popular songs, she is also a welcome respite for the book-weary eyes, according
to the union.

Conference Day Offers Guidance To Students
By ROY GRIER
Staff Writer

College Conference Day, a time for students to stop a moment and ask, "Where am I going?" will be held
this Wednesday. For the third year, the day has been set aside for students to investigate careers, programs, and majors.
Preliminaries will begin Tuesday evening at 8 p.m. with presentations on the four pre-professional programs: pre-med, pre-law, pre-managerial, and pre-ministerial.

All classes have been cancelled for Wednesday to give students the opportunity to take advantage of the programs being presented.
Departmental conferences will be held from 10 a.m. to 12 noon in either individual or group meetings. There will also
be a panel for students who are unsure of their plans for the future. Wednesday morning has been suggested as
a time for freshmen to meet with their faculty advisors, but according to Dean of Students Will H. Terry an
appointment must be made in advance.

Beginning the afternoon session will be a presentation by Director of Career Service Ken Wood. He will be leading a
program from 1:30 to 2:30 about Career Service in general. Also at this time will be programs for those interested
in Junior Year Abroad, Center for Honors Study, and ROTC.

In the afternoon will be a program on women as professionals. Terry hopes that it will be attended by both
men and women, since it is an educational program. Women who are professionals in the fields of education, medicine, business,
and the ministry will be leading small discussion groups. Included in the program are Elizabeth Koontz, head of the N.C.
Nutritional Program; Johnnie McCleod from the Drug Education Center in Charlotte; Nancy Collins, speaking on business; Nancy Ramsey, an ordained
minister; and Mary Burke, head of the counseling and guidance program at UNCC.

The Conference Day is different from past years in that it is geared to all students and not just freshmen.
Terry emphasized that it’s a "good opportunity to investigate careers, programs, and individual academic needs."
