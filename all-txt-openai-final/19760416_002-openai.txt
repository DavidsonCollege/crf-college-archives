**Avinger reveals Center faculty, program changes**

Five faculty members have been appointed to posts within the Davidson College Center for Honors Studies. These include Associate Professor of English Charles L. Cornwell, Associate Professor of German Erich O. Wruck, Academic Vice President Frontis W. Johnston, Assistant Professor of Psychology Edward L. Palmer, and Instructor of Political Science Joseph D. Retzer. 

The new members will replace Professor of English Frank W. Bliss, Associate Professor of English J. Gill Holland, Professor of Economics Ernest F. Patterson. Dean of the Honors Center Robert L. Avinger indicated that each of the faculty and students of the Honors Center would be to some extent involved in a program in American Studies. This Avinger considers the unifying factor in the Center’s 1976-77 curriculum. 

Avinger feels that “there should be a common ground, something that each student and faculty member can tap into that will provide for a common interest. What we're trying to do is to order the seminars and tutorials around a rather broad theme,” said Avinger. 

The Center, however, will not be limited in scope, according to Avinger. He stressed that “the Center is still and will continue to be an opportunity for students to pursue special interests, in many cases interdisciplinary studies, through special programs. We are program oriented,” said Avinger. 

Each of the new Center faculty members will contribute to the overall program in American Studies during 1976-77. This program, according to Avinger, was put together partly under pressure—Avinger was appointed Dean of the Center in March and the program begins in September. However, Avinger also believes that the program will be of value. He pointed out that the “American Studies” label covers a broad range of topics. Avinger feels that each member of the Center will find some aspect of the program to participate in. 

Avinger was trained in a field closely related to American Studies and has been interested in a program of this sort for some time. Avinger said that there have been difficulties in planning next year’s Center programs. “We have several departments,” he said, “and would like support in other areas, but the departments didn’t have the manpower. Even so, there are possibilities for very exciting programs,” said Avinger, “Palmer’s work in Urban Psychology and the effects of Mass Media, for instance.” 

The Honors Center Studies next year will not be limited to American Studies, however. Both Associate Professor of Chemistry Ralph W. Gable and Associate Professor of Biology William T. Lammers will teach seminars and tutorials in their respective fields and Wruck will lead a seminar on Hauptmann, Mann, and Hesse in the Fall term. 

**Artist Series**

Control of the Davidson College Artist Series will be in the hands of a joint Union Board-Faculty Committee for a trial period of two years. A guaranteed yearly budget of $12,000 will enable the committee to bring quality dance, theater, and music attractions to Davidson. Previously, the faculty alone has directed the Artist Series and the monetary allocations from various sources have been unpredictable. 

“The faculty voted for this change because students have shown increasing interest in planning the activities of the Series,” said Union Director C. Shaw Smith. The Union Programming will have a new assistant director next year.

“A student could handle most of the work,” he said. “Now, the program we have is as big as the building we work in. We don’t have the...”know-how among students to handle the complexities of programming,” said Goodhouse. “The appointment of this new assistant director is a critical juncture. We need to be careful with who we hire and how we analyze their skills and ability to work with people. A good assistant can be a great benefit to Davidson’s program,” he said.

Goodhouse stressed knowledge of the whole field of union programming as necessary qualifications of an assistant director. “This includes: contacts; programming skills, such as booking, publicity, production of major events like an artist series, and technical work; box-office management; and budgetary-monetary skills,” he said.

Goodhouse said that he attended the A.C.U.-I. convention and interviewed some 45 applicants for the job. Twelve of these 45 were called back for second interviews. The Union Board Executive Committee is now reading the interviews of these 12 people, and will bring the top five candidates to Davidson for further interviews. Goodhouse added that the ultimate decision was Smith’s.

According to the American Bar Association (A.B.A.), enrollment of first-year law students in A.B.A. approved law schools has dropped for the first time in seven years. In the 156 A.B.A. accredited law schools, the number of enrolled first-year students dropped by 182, from 38,074 in the Fall of 1974 to 37,892 in the Fall of 1975. This is the first such decrease since 1968. The A.B.A. also reported a slow-down in the rate of increase in overall enrollment and a drop in the number of new law school openings. Law schools are also experiencing a decline in the quality of applicants. Mean test scores on the Law School Admissions Test dropped from 1973-74 to 1974-75. “Many law schools experienced a decrease in the total number of applicants who met the given admission criteria in each law school,” said James White, A.B.A. consultant on legal education. “Additionally, a number of law schools experienced a greater number of ‘no shows’ in their first choice of admittees,” he said.

The Fund has allocated $5,000 of its budget to the Artist Series. “In the past, money hasn’t been appropriated to the Artist Series until April or May,” commented Union President Karl E. Goodhouse. “By that time many of the artists and groups we want are booked or are asking for top dollar,” said Goodhouse. “With this annual sum of $12,000 we can begin early locating and bargaining with the people we want. Because this new setup has just been approved, the results may not be as evident next year. The 1977-78 school year will be the real test,” said Goodhouse.

Smith said that co-curricular activities such as the Artist Series will receive half of the Union’s budget’s money next year. “With good planning the students have learned to make this social money go further, and we can do more things in that area with the same amount of money. By increasing the co-curricular allocation, the Union Board is emphasizing its belief that the co-curricular activities are also an important part of the college experience,” Smith said.

The President appoints three faculty to the nine-member committee, the Union Board has three seats, and these six choose three more people from the College community as a whole.
