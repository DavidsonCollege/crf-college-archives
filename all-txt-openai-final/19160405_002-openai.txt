THE COMING PLAGUE

A malady is sweeping over the South, gradually extending Northward. It has recently reached Davidson, and a few have already fallen victims to it. A strange disease this is, very contagious, and one which no drug or antitoxin has been found to cure. Its symptoms are characteristic. The victim surveys the work that has piled upon him, whistles at the enormousness of it, and sets himself to work it off. But somehow a strange feeling of weariness comes over him. He looks out of his window. Outside the sun is shining brightly, balmy breezes are shaking the newly born leaves, the green grass speaks eloquently of fragrant coolness, while the buzzing of insects and the singing of birds blend with the clink of horseshoes. The victim becomes conscious of a great desire for the campus in preference to his dull room. Then indifference is added to weariness. What matters it if the tickets are not studied? What though all the work of the year should be lost by indifference now? The student is tired, his brain will not work, he thinks possibly he has a headache, he needs fresh air and rest and must have it. Therewith he rises, throws down his books, and goes out, only to return after mail time, muttering vicious ejaculations for wasting an afternoon. No wonder doctors are baffled when confronted by this strange malady. There is no cure for Spring Fever, for such is its name, but there is a preventive—Will. It is he who can sit and make himself work while all Nature is calling him and desire to quit is savagely attacking him body and mind, it is he, even more than the star in baseball and track, who is the true college hero.

"Reserves and Their Protection."

Much interest is being taken in the Junior-Senior debate preliminaries which will be held tonight in the respective society halls. The query for debate is: "Resolved, That an amendment should be made to the Federal Constitution, forbidding the sale of intoxicating liquors in the United States.” As a result of the preliminaries tonight, three men will be selected from each society to compete in Shearer Hall for the Intersociety Debating Cup and the medals given to the best debater in each society. The date for the finals has not been definitely decided. Those debating tonight are: Perry, Edgerton, and Dumas in the Eumenean society, and Ratchford, Ormand, McLeod, MacDonald, and Clary in the Philanthropic.

LECTURES FOR THIS MONTH.

The two remaining lectures of the series secured by the faculty will be given this month. The first of these will be on April 11th, by Mr. O. O.Atto. Mr. Atto is in charge of the Weather Bureau at Charlotte. The subject of his lecture will be, “The United States Weather Bureau, Its Work and Worth.” He will show slides furnished by the Government for this occasion. The last of these lectures will be delivered by Mr. William L. Hall, of the Bureau of Forestry. The subject of this lecture will be, “The Eastern Forest.” This lecture will also be accompanied with stereopticon slides. The date has not been definitely decided, but will be either April 26th or 27th.

NEW WATER MAIN. During the past few days, a corps of men has been at work under Mr. J. M. Hill laying the new four-inch water main. The first eight hundred feet of the line, leading from the pumping station to the wooded corner southeast of Georgia, has been practically completed. Near this point, a large stand-pipe will be erected. The main will be laid from the stand-pipe to Chambers building, to the Chemical Laboratory, and to the site of the proposed new gymnasium. In all, about two thousand feet of piping will be put down within a short time. Hydrants will be placed wherever they are needed for fire protection.
