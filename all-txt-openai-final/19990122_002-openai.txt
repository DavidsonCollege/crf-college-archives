1. I have represented the Class of 2000 as an SGA Class Senator since our freshman year. I’ve co-chaired two
SGA committees (Public Relations and Town Liaison), I’ve been on the Activities Tax Council, and I’ve been the House Manager
of Warner Hall. I have been in a leadership position every semester I’ve been at Davidson.

2. The Vice President serves as both an indispensable assistant to the President and also a liaison to the students
through the Intercouncil system, which the VP is in charge of. The VP clarifies and reinforces points made by the
President and also serves as another leader that both the Senate and the students the Senate represents can look to.
In the three years that I’ve served as a Senator, I have interacted with both the President and the Vice
President extensively, and I think that the best way I could serve the students would be to use this experience
to do my job well.

3. I think that most Davidson students are aware of all the problems on campus but don’t know how to
act on them. The SGA is the voice of the students; it gives them a powerful outlet to let their
opinions and solutions be known and implemented. A good example would be the current state of race relations on campus.
Although the problem is in no way solved, the hard work of the Senate, reflecting a caring student body, was
able to make huge strides, including the first recognized Martin Luther King, Jr. Day and numerous conferences and diversity discussions.
I also know that this issue needs lots more work, and that an SGA that is highly accessible to students
will continue to improve the situation.

4. I see the SGA moving toward a more unified and concrete purpose. I will encourage campus committees to solidify
and meet more regularly and the Senators to better meet the needs of their constituents. The SGA should energetically and
enthusiastically address the needs of the students.

5. One of the most important ways that things get done on this campus is through the committee system. The
SGA Vice President oversees this system, which means that responsibility for committees from the Council on Minority Affairs to the
Lights Out committee falls on the office. This is the most important aspect of the office. I am extremely familiar
with the way the Senate works. I’ve chaired and sat on committees, so I know both sides of that street.
I am very comfortable with the By-Laws (which doesn’t mean I don’t think there are changes that can be made)
and Parliamentary Procedure. But most importantly, I have wanted this opportunity since I was a freshman. I have the experience
and I have the desire to do a really good job.

1. I was an SGA senator for Connor House during my sophomore year. I co-chaired the Solidarity Committee which focuses
on bringing the Davidson community together. I have also worked on the Polling and Response Committee where I helped poll
the student body on issues from sororities at Davidson to the quality of the DC bookstore.

2. I hope to bridge this gap by communication. My vision as a Vice President will be to get to
know each member on the Senate and the President by talking with each individual, but primarily by listening. I feel
that by doing so I will be able to keep the President updated on the concerns of the Senate, and
in turn the concerns of the student body.

3. I believe that the most pressing issue facing the SGA now is the issue of diversity. I have seen
many students express to the SGA their concern with diversity issues on campus. Over the past few semesters I have
seen the SGA actively trying to work on the issue of diversity by sponsoring various events, and I hope that
they will continue to deal with the issue by addressing it openly and working toward finding solutions.

4. I see the SGA playing a more active role with the concerns of the student body. My vision is
to help this progression by encouraging Senators to keep in constant communication with their constituents. As the Vice President, I
would try my best to be a model for other Senators by communicating openly with the Senate as well as
the student body.

5. I enjoy people. I want to work closely with the President and the Senate to listen and address the
concerns of the student body. I want any vote that I cast on any given issue to represent the best
interests of the student body. I am an enthusiastic, hard-working individual who would love to serve each Davidson student and
I feel that the Vice Presidency would allow me to fulfill this purpose.Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the

3. What do you think is the most pressing issue facing the SGA now? What is your stance and how
will you deal with it?

1. I have extensive experience in the SGA. I have been a senator for two years, serving as a freshman
senator and as sophomore class president. My most recent efforts have involved initiating and co-chairing the “Lights Out” Committee. I
also chair the Building Services Committee, which acts as a liaison between the Physical Plant and the student body.
2. I plan to bridge the gap between the Senate and the President by building relationships with the Senate body.
Many times the president envisions a goal and the responsibility falls on the VP to make that goal a reality.
By building relationships in the Senate and knowing each senator’s individual qualities, I will be able to delegate the right
jobs to the right people.
3. One of the most pressing issues facing the SGA right now is increasing the output of all its voting
members. A large majority of the work done in the SGA is accomplished by less than one-third of the senators.
Recently, the SGA passed a resolution requiring more participation from senators in SGA.

3. What do you think is the most pressing issue facing the SGA now? What is your stance and how

1. I served as a co-coordinator of Habitat for Humanity and am currently a Service Ambassador and the publicity chair
of Reach Out. I am also a hall counselor where I deal with communication issues, problem solving, and organization on
a daily basis.
2. From serving many organizations, I understand how different groups work. This will help me unite the students and the
SGA, especially on the Intercouncil where, as chair, the Vice President's job is to bring students together on various committees.
I love interacting with others, listen and communicate well, and have a ton of energy.
3. Davidson’s lack of awareness about different groups and interests on campus seems to be the latest issue challenging the
SGA. I would love to see this issue tackled by making each week a different awareness week. Organizations could sponsor
a week, heightening their exposure and increasing others’ knowledge.

UNION BOARD PRESIDENT

1. How do you propose to keep the student body motivated and involved in the agenda of the Union Board?
2. What experiences and interests qualify you for this post?
3. What new and exciting things would you propose for your term?

1. I believe that the Union must continue to be a resource that is readily available to everyone in the
Davidson community. This means several things. Having worked on the Union Board, I feel reasonably qualified to say that involvement
and enthusiasm for Union events is a direct function of three basic elements: an interesting and exciting variety of activities,
the hard work and visibility of a dedicated Union Board, and effective advertising and promotional work. These are all things
that the current group does very well, but as with any organization, the Union Board has tremendous potential for growth
and improvement.
2. I have spent the past year as a member at large of the Union Board. In this capacity, I
have been privileged to work with many of Davidson’s administrative and student leaders. One of my responsibilities as a member
at large was to serve as the liaison between the Union and the Student Government Association. In addition, I have
worked on occasion with Auxiliary Services and the Dean of Students Office. Also, I spent this summer working in the
Union as an operations assistant, greatly enhancing my knowledge and understanding of Union events and programming. I strongly believe that
these experiences have taught me what is required to run a successful Union.
3. I think that any group of Union officers must carefully consider the desires of the students that the Union
represents. After all, the Union Board does have control of considerable funds drawn from the student body. To this end,
I will endeavor to address the concerns of the student body as recently articulated by such media as the Davidsonian,
the Union survey that was conducted last fall, and the general perception of Union events. For example, the Union survey
showed a strong demand for big-name bands, a concern that is currently being addressed and that the Board should continue
to pursue in the coming year. I hope to draw together a diverse Union Board representing all elements of campus
to help effectively serve the entire student body.
4. My biggest weakness is one that is bound to beset any Union Board president. This is a big job,
and no one has the energy or the patience to do it alone. This will force reliance on my fellow
officers and on the committee chairs. Such reliance is crucial to the activities of a healthy board.
5. The job of Union Board President requires a great deal of behind-the-scenes work that relies on a thorough familiarity
with the workings and interactions of Union Board, both within itself and in its place among other campus entities. I
believe that my experiences with these various organizations make me the best candidate for the job.
