It is IMPORTANT that you be able to see a copy. If you haven't, drop in at the Y and get one before Thursday. You will not be called upon to express your views unless you wish to do so or to propose a question for discussion. Mr. Miles, after an opening prayer, defined our study as dealing with the most modern problems of missions arising from the effects of the war: in Europe, in the Peace Conference, and hence in the whole world. This most momentous revolution of affairs in history deserves the special attention of every thinking American at this time. Hence the World Forum will take the place of the group study classes of individual fields such as China, Japan, etc. Mr. Miles opened the discussion by his views of the apparent effects of the actual fighting upon those engaged. While all except four of the twenty-odd belligerent nations professed to be Christian nations, there was little true Christianity in their governmental policies. Even men in the church professed to believe that the application of the principles of individual Christianity to national life was impossible. Everywhere the cry arose that Christianity had failed. It had failed—but only in that it had not permeated national life as it strove to influence that of the individual.
