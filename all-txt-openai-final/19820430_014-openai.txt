Metamorphosis?

A gray cocoon hangs by a thread
beneath a spare willow.
Leaves and dust outside,
within a dull brown moth,
wings firmly bound to caterpillar body.
Waiting for spring, it stirs, alone—
but nature binds it to herself again.
Sleep some more, little one, cries one voice;
Get on with your living—Grow up! says another...
It flutters some more.
You'll never fly turned in yourself,
holding your wings together.
The willow buds.
The cocoon still hangs by a thread.

Vodka

toss it down neat
we're the czarina’s young ensigns
nose-thumbing the grapeshot
improvising on a snowy sill
four floors above the cobblestones
here the climes are southerlier
the dilutions Floridian
(O.J. Smirnoff et al.) and
the Bluebird of oblivion
yields to the Donald Duck
of you catatonic at dawn
in a near-stranger’s house
trying to translate Dutch
anyway, what would you do
if you had a lean lithe body
to live in and glossy boots
and albums I-V of Balalaika Favorites
even in those days
the cobblestones
got the ensigns
the grapeshot missed
