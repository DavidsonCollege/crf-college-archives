**Freshman receives suspension for Honor Code violation**

**Lavarro admits to charges of plagiarism, suffers standard penalty**

By KEITH FINCH

At an open honor council hearing on Monday night, freshman José Rizalde Lavarro was penalized with a two-term suspension after
pleading guilty to charges of plagiarism. In his defense, Lavarro’s advisors sought to prove that he had committed the acts
of plagiarism unknowingly, having accidentally submitted the rough draft of a paper instead of the final draft. The seven-page paper
had been assigned as a part of professor Grant Jones’ Anthropology 101 course. Lavarro submitted it to Jones on February
12.

According to Honor Council Defense Advisor Mark Piehl, who read a defense statement, Jones noticed large sections of Lavarro’s paper
which he believed were not in Lavarro’s own words. Jones then investigated the works which Lavarro had cited as his
sources for the paper. Jones finally reported to Dean of Students Will Terry his suspicion that Lavarro was guilty of
several documentation errors in the body of his paper, and that he had invented two of the sources cited in
his bibliography.

Piehl said that Lavarro was informed of the charges against him by the Honor Council’s student solicitors, who contacted him
at 7:30 p.m. on March 10. Lavarro testified that the solicitors had at that time shown him a copy of
the paper he had submitted for his anthropology class. Upon seeing the paper, Lavarro realized that he had accidentally printed
and handed in his rough draft instead of his final draft, Piehl said.

Piehl said that Lavarro had saved both his rough and final drafts on the same computer diskette, and that in
his haste to complete the assignment he mistakenly printed a copy of his rough draft and submitted it to Jones.
Lavarro said he had been in a hurry to finish the paper so he could attend football practice, and that
he had not looked at the paper when he printed it but had merely stapled the sheets together and turned
them in.

Piehl circulated a list of the files on Lavarro’s diskette, and pointed out that the name of the file containing
the rough draft was similar to that of the file containing the final. He said it was easy to see
how Lavarro could have mistaken one file for another.

According to Piehl’s statement and Lavarro’s own testimony, Lavarro regularly composed research papers by transcribing long passages directly from his
sources into the computer. Only later would he edit these passages and add proper citations. The rough draft he submitted
consisted of uncited quotations copied directly from his source material.

When questioned by Defense Advisor Mike Cowen, Lavarro said that after realizing his mistake he began to search for the
diskette containing his anthropology paper files. He could not find it, so he went to discuss the matter with his
hall counselor and some other friends. Eventually, Lavarro said, he found the diskette and went to the User Services Building
to print a copy of his final draft. He said he only spent ten or fifteen minutes there. Then he
went to a party on Patterson Court, and finally went to sleep.Later that evening, he delivered the final draft, along
with his diskette, to Jones the next afternoon. Piehl said that Jones suspected Lavarro of lying about his computer mix-up
and of having edited his final draft only after hearing of the charges against him. In response to this accusation,
the Honor Council heard the testimony of four witnesses who, between them, established that Lavarro did not have enough time
to write a new paper that evening. The witnesses, residents of Lavarro’s hall, said he had watched television and talked
until 9:30 p.m. or later and had shown them a copy of his final draft at around 10:15 p.m.

Student Solicitor Peter Wright accepted this testimony as true and conceded that there was no reason to believe Lavarro had
written a new paper on the evening of March 10. Piehl acknowledged that even Lavarro’s final draft contained “scattered examples”
of plagiarism, but he argued that this was due to Lavarro’s lack of skill in paper-writing techniques and not to
any disrespect for the Honor Code. Piehl said that Lavarro had made similar errors of documentation in all his papers
for his English 21 class, where he demonstrated a poor command of English (his second language) and received low grades.
Piehl also pointed out that the two sources Jones believed Lavarro had “invented” did indeed exist, although one title listed
in Lavarro’s bibliography represented a combination of the titles of two works.

Lavarro’s offenses were unintentional, Piehl said, and Lavarro “remains an honor-bound Davidson student.” Wright spoke for the solicitors, arguing that
Lavarro’s computer mix-up was immaterial since even the plagiarism in the second, final draft represented a serious violation of the
Honor Code. Wright said that Lavarro’s method of paper-writing contradicted what he had been taught in his English course and
during freshman orientation. He further remarked that Lavarro could have at any time asked his professors for assistance in improving
his documentation skills. Wright concluded by recommending that Lavarro be subjected to the normal Honor Code sanction, a two-term suspension.
He further recommended that Lavarro receive a grade of F in his Anthropology 101 course and be required to repeat
English 21.

After meeting in a closed executive session, the Honor Council accepted Wright’s recommendations. Lavarro’s two-term suspension will be considered to
have begun at the beginning of last term, so he will lose all credit for his winter term courses and
will be eligible to reenter Davidson at the beginning of next year. Honor Council chairperson Holly Sparks said, “We felt
these sanctions were appropriate based on the extensive plagiarism within the papers, particularly within the second revised version. In addition,
the papers demonstrated the defendant’s negligence in learning and applying proper documentation techniques that had been taught in his English
21 class.”

“A two-term suspension is the standard sanction for Honor Code violations, and the Council also hoped that the time away
from Davidson would provide him with time to reassess his college career, and will hopefully give him a fresh start
next fall with a composition class.”

Lavarro’s hearing was the first open Honor Council hearing this year. Students charged with violations have the right to request
an open hearing if they so desire; otherwise, all proceedings are carried out in the strictest confidentiality. Lavarro has the
right to appeal to the President of the college, who has the authority to lessen the severity of his sentence.
Other Honor Council members present included seniors Lauren Adams and Clara Broniec, juniors John Cock and Craig Carlock, and sophomore
D.J. Snell. The Honor Council Secretary, junior Molly Cochran, was also in attendance.
