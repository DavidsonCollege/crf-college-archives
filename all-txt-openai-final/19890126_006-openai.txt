Special airfares on Northwest Airlines.
A special offer for students, only for American Express Cardmembers.

If you want to go places, it’s time for the American Express® Card.

Because now you can take advantage of new travel privileges on Northwest Airlines only for full-time students who carry the
American Express Card.

Travel privileges that offer:
- Two $99 roundtrip tickets—fly to any of the more than 180 cities served by Northwest in the contiguous 48
United States. Only one ticket may be used per six-month period.
- Special Quarterly Northwest Destination Discounts throughout 1989—up to 25% off the lowest available fare.
- 5,000 bonus miles in Northwest's WORLDPERKS® free travel program—where only 20,000 miles gets you a free roundtrip ticket to
anywhere Northwest flies in the contiguous 48 United States or Canada.

And, of course, you'll enjoy all the exceptional benefits and personal service you would expect from American Express.

The only requirements for privileged travel: you must be a Cardmember, you must be a full-time student, and you must
charge your Northwest Airlines tickets with the Card.*

Getting the Card is easier than ever because now you can apply by phone. Just call 1-800-942-AMEX. We'll take your
application and begin to process it right away. What's more, with our Automatic Approval offers, you can qualify now while
you're still in school.

Apply now. Fly later—for less.

Apply Now: 1-800-942-AMEX

*Some restrictions may apply. For complete offer details, call 1-800-942-AMEX. Current student Cardmembers automatically receive two $99 vouchers in the
mail.
