8 THE DAVIDSONIAN ARTS MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 16, 1991

Inside Art

The following poem was submitted to the Davidson Arts editors by Professor J. Gill Holland. Holland, a professor in the Department of English, currently has in print both a collection of poems entitled *Pocahontas and the Drunken Waiter* and a volume of Chinese poems which he translated into English, *Keep an Eye On South Mountain*.

### The Unbearable Lightness of TV Tanks in Moscow: A Media Lesson for Children

By using the principles of mechanics, hydraulics, and these few desert bones  
To discover  
The New Scientist builds a dinosaur to discover its true slow motion.  
In that dim age the rig of the beast could only move hugely in silent flickers.  
Change gears like the family Saratoga Chrysler push buttons, lift limbs.  
The subtitle “WHO STOLE MY GREENS?” slowly squeaks the TERROR-LIZARD.  
Silent film, boys and girls, the original FLIC.  
Don’t let the fellow lie down on you, but nothing to fear in the attack dept.  
Speed up the projector.  
Its modern cousin the crocodile, a racer, gives you a headstart along the riverbank, but only Tarzan makes it off, that tycoon of the jungle vine, from Taikun, Ta-chun, the root.

### Clarion Quintet Begins 1991 Concert Series

The Davidson College Concert Series kicks off its 1991 season on Monday, September 16, with a performance by members of the Clarion Quintet and pianist Clifton Matthews. The concert begins at 8:15 in Hodson Hall of the Cunningham Fine Arts Building, and admission is $5.

Matthews will play along with four of the five N.C. School of the Arts faculty members who comprise the Clarion Quintet. The Clarion players in Davidson will be Fred Bergstone, John Ellis, Robert Listoken, and Mark Popkin, presenting a concert of chamber music for piano and winds that includes Mozart and Beethoven. Each musician is a soloist in his own right and has given concerts worldwide.

There will be a reception for guests and musicians following the concert, along with a free pre-concert lecture by William Lawing, chairman of the Davidson music department, at 7:15 in Room 115 of the Cunningham Fine Arts Building.

The Davidson College Concert Series was created by an endowment established by First Charter National Bank in honor of the Coltrane family. It is funded by the endowment, the music department, and the College Union. Additional support is provided by the Friends of the Arts at Davidson.

### Rush Continued from page 7

A very tasteful guitar solo. More guitar can be heard on “Face Up” and especially on “Where’s My Thing,” an instrumental that is easily the highlight of the album. The bass playing of Lee along with Peart’s flawless and lightning-fast drumming drive this tune along forcefully as Lifeson’s guitar continues to come to life.

“The Big Wheel” exhibits nothing new, while “Heresy” is musically similar to “Anagram (for Mongo)” from *Presto* and comments on the revolutions occurring in the Communist world. The lyrics of Neil Peart have long been considered far above the rock and roll average, and of the Eastern European revolution he says, “All around that dull gray world of ideology/ people storm the marketplace and buy up fantasy./ The counter-revolution at the counter of a store/ people buy the things they want and borrow for a little more.”

Just as the album starts with some hopeful glimpses of the old, hard-rocking power that once made Rush one of the premiere concert attractions, it closes with three tunes that are, quite simply, sleepers (and I don’t mean good ones you’ll never hear of!). “Ghost of a Chance” and “Neurotica” are just plain boring, and “You Bet Your Life,” although the fastest closing tune in the past four albums, is deeply scarred by dabs of vocals that are too similar to Billy Joel’s “We Didn’t Start the Fire.”

As far as the absence of rumors goes, I hate to say it but it is probably because no one cares. Being the Rush fan that I am, it pains me deeply to speak of them negatively. There are some bright spots on this album, but if you’re a true Rush fan...If you're a fan (or even if you’re not), don’t scar your memories of the band by buying this record. “Big Wind” is Ta-feng, our ward phon which could blow you little ones away. Feng is “Wind,” which brings distemper, rhymes with Deng, pronounced /dung/ in English. Xiao-Ping, a bottle of little Pop you eat with a bad egg-roll and your stomach’s aching empty soon again. Homophones are as trustworthy as a new broom. Later in ’89, Soviets journeyed to the Middle Kingdom to share PLA expertise on crowd control. “Wind in the Bones” is rheumatism, a epee volunteered. I couldn’t find it in the Cette. Wait a minute, children. That’s the sound of a tank in the street. Hear the wind whistle inside our bones? In unbearable heat, tanks poise and flicker. “WHO STOLE MY GREENS?” Slowly squeaks the TERROR-LIZARD. Run cannot. Too big to run away. -- Gill Holland

Later in August, 1991, Awards Continued from page 7

Album of the Year: Don’t Rock the Jukebox, Alan Jackson; No Fences, Garth Brooks; Pocket Full of Gold, Vince Gill; Put Yourself in My Shoes, Clint Black; Rumour Has It, Reba McEntire.

Each of these selections is worth every penny of its price - very solid projects by strong artists. But let’s be serious - Garth deserves this one. No Fences is one of the best albums (of any kind) that I have ever heard; and aside from personal opinions, it was also one of the biggest selling (four huge singles including “Friends in Low Places”) and most attention-getting country albums in country music history. The only legitimate choice for an upset is Rumour Has It, in another year I might lean its way. But not this year; chalk up one for Mr. Brooks.

Who should: No Fences
Who will: No Fences
