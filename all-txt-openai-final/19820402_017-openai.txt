"Dusk

Elongated shadows cast out

Thin lined sketches

Of leafless oaken limbs

And two-legged stick figures

On a pine-straw charcoal pad

Crumpling under footfall’s weight.

The ice-blue sky

Sends down winter winds

Numbing fingers and

Blowing through woolen knits

Turning our

Supple skin brittle

And hard.

You reach for my hand

And clasp it tight, but

Somehow, your touch has

Lost its toughness and

Unlike my friends’ crusty handshakes

And my coach’s ass-thwacking palm,

Your fingers are soft, —

Caressingly tender.

Your eyes are not glazed

With a false concern and

Your careful footsteps

Lead me down the path

Through the black-and-white

Forest picture.

Anderson Scott ’84

Your wordless lips beckon to me to

Come closer;

Further into your woods.

I follow

Tripping on roots and stones

You've forgotten to tell me about,

But each fall you catch,

And every catch

Strengthens my trust in you,

Your forest,

Your path.

Now,

I can see a bit of

Where that path leads.

I can walk by your side,

Even ahead of you sometimes.

Almost as if we were equals,

Until I slip on a

Stepping stone crossing a brook and

My face crashes into

Ice-blue, mountain waters

Reflecting the sky’s coolness

Into my eyes that

Look up to see only:

Trees’ shadows:

On that pine-straw charcoal pad.

Jeffrey Tyler '84

April 1982
