Humanities student
hasn’t made one damn
comment all semester

CHAMBERS—Jim Conard ’06 hasn’t
made a single damn comment all semes-
ter long, students in Professor Tom
Hackman’s Humanities 251 discussion
group reported Monday. Despite coming
close to participating in class discussion
several times throughout the past
months, Conard has never really gone
ahead and said anything.

“I guess I should start participating
sometime soon,” said Conard. “It’s not
that I don’t want to, but I just never have
much to say. I just leave it to the kids who
like to talk all the time.”

Despite some
concern that he
might be harm-
ing his 15% class
participation
grade, Conard
feels that making
a comment now
might seem pain-
fully out of char-
acter.

“I’m not even
sure anyone in that class has heard my
voice before,” he said. “I think the kid next
to me might actually think I have a learn-
ing disability. The other problem is that if
I haven’t said something thus far, and
then finally do say something, everyone
will really expect it to be great. And that’s
not going to happen. No, I’m better off
just riding out the semester in peace and
quiet.”

“Actually, now that I think about it, I
said ‘I don’t know’ once when the profes-
sor got fed up and called on me one day,”
Conard continued. “So who knows,
maybe that counts.”

Conard noted if he gets up the motiva-
tion, he might actually try reading one of
the assignments, and see if maybe that
helps.

Return of the Outpost?

The administration has recently hinted that a return of
Davidson's favorite former Court hangout might be a
possibility for Fall 2005. What do you think?

“The Outpost...
Should I know
what this is?”

Ellen Toppel '06

“Oh Good! Now
I won't have to
drive to Waffle
House drunk
anymore.”

Hurt Jackson '04

“Well, if a 3:00
a.m. Big Ass
Burger can’t
bridge the social
rift between
Court goers and
non-Court goers
on this campus,
I don’t know
what will.”

Randall Steel ’04

“What? I
thought the
FIJIs were now
filling ladies’
late night
cravings.”

Matt Retland ’07

“All of the other
Highly Selective
Top Ranking
Liberal Arts
Schools have one.
We don’t want to
fall a spot in the
rankings. An
Outpost is
imperative.”

Jimmy Lee '04

“As a member
of Kappa Sigma,
I only have one
thing to say:
Goodbye.”

Dear Davidson College Transfer Stu-
dent: I can’t find a parking spot anywhere
near Belk. Should I hang out around
Tomlinson in case a spot opens up, or
should I just park in Satellite?

- Blinkers by Belk

Dear BLINKERS:

So what’s this I hear about a “Vespers”
show? It sounds really cool. Yeah, I’m
looking forward to it. What’s that? It was
in December? Crap. That’s stupid. Do
they think it’s a Christmas show or
something? Oh. Then why do they call it
“Vespers”? Really? Catholic? I thought
this place was Presbyterian.

Uh, hey listen, man, wanna hang out
sometime? What? No, that’s cool, I
understand. I’ve got, like, seven papers to
write, too. So what DVD are you watch-
ing?

Dear Davidson College Transfer Stu-
dent: I’m having a hard time making
good grades in this one class. Do you
think it would help if I offered to baby-sit
the professor’s kids sometime, or is that
too desperate?

-Sick of Studying in Sentelle

Dear SICK: Haha. Hahaha. You’re
funny, man. That was funny, man. So
what’s your major? That’s cool. You like
it? Cool. I’m from Brunswick. Yeah.
Where are you from? Oh, I knew a guy
at my old school who was from there. He
was a dick. My name’s Wesley, in case you
were wondering.

So anyway, man, wanna hang out
sometime? I hear there’s a good restau-
rant in town called “Soda’s Shop.” What?
No, I don’t think so. Because I don’t like
sushi. No, I’ve never tried it, I just don’t
think I'd like raw fi— what? You're going
right now? Hey wait, man. Haha. You're
funny. Yeah, I’d love to go see “You Got
Served” after dinner.

Dear Davidson College Transfer Stu-
dent: I have this friend in DO who’s fall-
ing for a Base Belker, but she’s in Sloan
every Tuesday and Thursday with the rest
of the choir and then has AT sometime
later. She’s also really into Androgyny, I
think. Is it romantic enough to eat out at
Commons, or should he wait until she has
a tough review and just bring her some
Beast?

— Preoccupied in Preyer

Dear PREOCCUPIED: I have no idea
what you're talking about.
