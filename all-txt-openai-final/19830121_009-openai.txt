In the beginning

The woman in me enters eyes
like cranes greet ponds

stands, as moment takes a breath
simple as oak, and entire

The man in me ties stone to stone
to lower in a well

He cannot sleep, he must know
how far hole goes below his feet

The child in me sees the light
leak from the sky

feels the First Day’s terrible loss
(one morning’s nothing to count on)

The woman in me grew wise young
learned the woman’s parable

that birth comes hard, bleeds
and bends you: bleed with joy

for the man in me, this is hard
to learn — he is best

at climbing ropes he’s hung himself
knows their ending and their strength

Your seasons are disturbed
my lovely mother,

for Spring has settled in with Autumn
and neither wants to leave.
I came home to join your harvest

and found new life upon your limbs,
eyes lined with freshness

you sparkle with silver

and I am awed.
Women so pregnant with dreams
have you found your season at last?

The Trinity’s no battle,
Mister Freud,

nor theologian’s Rubik’s cube.
The Trinity is me.

I remember aching restless rains
not so long ago,
Did they nourish you?

Dog’s Prayer

On Saturday

me and you

scraped Skipper

from the road

with shovels.

His blood matted fur
cracked in the stillness
of the autumn traffic.

We dug a hole in the sand and clay
and made up some grown up things to pray.

On Sunday

me and you
passed notes

and drew pictures
of Reverend Peters
and tried not to cry
when they said
the Dog’s Prayer.

Bonfire Number Three
In the Dark

mother never told me much
about sex.
she was always
too embarrassed to really
explain it.
“read this,” she'd say,
backing out the bedroom door
almost as quickly as she

came in.
too many years passed before
i ever read anything, and
old moth balls do not protect
new blankets.

Quiltlike

tonight

froot loops and wine,
while you

asking sublime,

may I sprawl
quiltlike

on your soul

all the night,
remembering this
knowing why

love awakens

I cry,

and the soggy loops
and lukewarm wine
answer your body
with mine.
