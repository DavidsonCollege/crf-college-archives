heard to say, “Definitely, we would like to invite them back.” Before the Tar Heels arrived, the press was bemoaning the fact that Army was not Notre Dame's opponent. They were soon to change their opinion. Carolinians (with their Confederate flags) popped up all over the city with big displays of school enthusiasm. The vice president of Notre Dame said, “It was the greatest, finest display of school spirit I have ever witnessed,” and a New York police captain said, “They're a great bunch of folks and we're glad to have ‘em with us.” About sixty musicians of the Colgate University band were attacked by Syracuse students as the (Continued on Page Six)

Letters To The Editor

Dear Editor:
I too should like to be so bold as to expose myself to unqualified condemnation by Bob Johnson, since I would consider it a great honor to be censured by his worthy pen and I am sure Mr. Harris must feel highly esteemed to have merited this great honor. It surely was with noble condescension that our Mr. Johnson gave of his valuable time to reply and not reply to Mr. Harris’ letter. Perhaps some of you remember the address by Mr. Arnold in which he said he had never heard a Davidson student utter a profane remark. Mr. Johnson's statement that he had never heard it said that Vespers should be cancelled, that chapel exercises be abolished, or that Bible, sophomore English, and/or ROTC be dropped sadly reminds me that he too does not hear what some students say. Now I will admit that no cursing may have reached Mr. Arnold’s ear, simply because he does not come into daily close contact with students; by the same token I will admit that it is remotely possible that Mr. Johnson never heard the above-mentioned abolishments and cancellations spoken of. However, I hesitate to think of him as a veritable inveterate recluse, shunning all student life and campus activities, as the case would seem to be if he has never heard proposals pertaining to doing away with any or all of these exercises and classes. Be that as it may... If it is against all the forms of Mr. Johnson's religion or creed to express oneself with emotion, then Mr. Harris has wronged him. But even we intellectual Presbyterians find it necessary to give vent to our feelings occasionally and I think Mr. Harris has done no more in this case. Further, it is my humble opinion that he is being unjustly lowered by Johnson’s derogatory remarks pertaining to the heights of Mr. Harris’ dignity. In closing let me agree and go one step further than Mr. Johnson. He made no civil attempt to answer Mr. Harris’ letter.
W. L. Brooks.

Dear Editor:
You will be surprised to find upon checking just how few places the Davidson band accompanied the football team this fall. Twice at Davidson and once in Charlotte I think is correct. Is it any wonder that with such poor support the team didn’t do any better? The Davidson band is and always has been a big asset to the college and a big moral support to the team. Outsiders even do not understand, much less the Alumni. What a pity—what a pity—what a pity.

Marking Upward Trend In Southern Education

While visiting 50 Southern colleges recently, Chester I. Barnard, head of the Rockefeller Foundation, made some highly gratifying observations regarding the progress of education in the South. In this section with other foundation heads to study institutions that had requested grants, Mr. Barnard remarked that educational advances in this region are advancing hand in hand with the South’s increasing prosperity. The truth of his statement may easily be discerned by the growing number of students from other sections who enroll at Southern institutions to obtain their education. In this same connection, the Georgia School of Technology released an interesting report the other day which attributed the lure of the Atlanta institution more to its high scholastic rating than to its football team. The report was based on a poll of the student body taken by the Tech public relations office. The trend of enrollments of students at Southern institutions from other sections marks the reversal of a process. For many years, it was the other way around. Young people left the South to go elsewhere for their education and often remained. Today more students from other regions are coming to the South and are remaining to make this section their home and contribute to its progress.—Jacksonville Times.

CAMERA CORNER
By HUGH SWAN

entertainment and in doing so you lose the happiness obtained from creating your own entertainment. Therefore, it depends upon the individual—you can use your money for personal comforts and help to others—you can still seek out the simple, seemingly unimportant activities of life that give you so much happiness. Little things such as those last few hours with your sweetheart, the long intimate talks with your best pal, and that look on mother’s and dad’s faces when you got your high school diploma, all these you lock in your heart so you can draw on them during those cold, winter days when things look “sorta” blue. Anyone can have these little joys of life—they're all free. Money is no problem to decide, it’s the type of person you're going to be that is the question. This picture will really give you a thought to chew on—don’t miss it.

“The Trail of the Lonesome Pine” starring Fred McMurray, Henry Fonda (Frank James), and Sylvia Sidney plays Friday and Saturday. This picture, brought back by popular demand, tells how an ancient hill feud involving two families, and resulting in dozens of deaths, is affected by the inroads of civilization, in the person of a young engineer who arrives to construct a railroad line that must go through the property of the feuding families. Miss Sidney and Fonda portray members of the Tolliver clan. When MacMurray, as the engineer, arrives on the scene, Sylvia is immediately fascinated by him. Fonda, her cousin, who has always loved her, is aroused to jealousy that knows no law but one—to fight and kill for the things he holds dear. The events that follow when the opposing factions meet result in some highly exciting action. For the outcome, see this old favorite.

Three fine pictures are coming to the Davidson Theatre this next week. If you want to see any of them, present 35 cents at the window or tear off the tops of two convertibles and mail them in for a press pass. “Outpost in Morocco”, starring George Raft and Akim Tamiroff, plays Monday and Tuesday. It’s the story of the French Foreign Legion trapped in the forbidden zones of seething Morocco. There’s a gal in it—Raft falls in love with her but she, being his enemy, gives Raft the brush-off. Raft has a hard choice to make—he must make the Arabs surrender or make the girl (Marie Windsor) his own. Marie Windsor is quite a gal. In her childhood on a Utah ranch she was able to whip up her own wardrobe, turn out an expertly prepared meal, lay bricks, pour concrete, repair an automobile and, in her spare time, crochet, or hand-sew a hooked rug. She is a champion rider, having once performed in a rodeo, and has more than her share of good looks—a fact attested by her having been selected as Miss Utah. You will be convinced of this when you see her. In addition, she is a skilled writer of lyric poetry and short stories. After seeing her in this picture you will agree that she has one outstanding talent not mentioned above.

“That Forsyte Woman,” starring Greer Garson (Mrs. Miniver), Errol Flynn (Gentleman Jim Corbett), Walter Pidgeon (Mr. Miniver), Janet Leigh (the gal in “The Doctor and the Girl"), and Robert Young (Claudia’s husband), plays Wednesday and Thursday. This is a wonderful picture with a theme to digest thoroughly. It's a story of happiness vs. marriage. Strange that the two are always used in opposition to each other. Money doesn’t destroy happiness—it merely enables you to buy enter-

Review of “John Loves Mary”
By PHIL MITCHELL

“John Loves Mary,” this year’s production of Norman Krasna’s comedy by the Red and Black Masquers was somewhat better than their production last year of “Arsenic and Old Lace.” This improvement stems from an influx of new talent, notably, Bill Trotman, and a choice of a play more suitable for a college presentation. Jessie Carter and T. W. Alfred in the straight roles left something to be desired, although they had by far the most difficult parts. Jessie, as Mary, was a little slow on the come-back, and her crying jags were rather unconvincing in her anticipation of John’s arrival. She seemed a trifle too adolescent to be the grown daughter of a prominent senator. There is much to be said for her facial expression and the manner in which she carried herself on the stage. She definitely showed a bit of talent, and a calmness that would be well for some of the veteran actors to emulate. John, as played by T. W. Alfred, was an ordinary young man without expression or emotion, whose only distinguishing feature was the continual rubbing of his face with a handkerchief. His acting and dialogue improved as the play progressed, and with an increase of experience, he ought to become a very valuable man to the Masquers.

Bouquets to Woody McKay as Fred. He was a natural for the part, which he played excellently; although he fell down slightly on his more serious lines. His quick ad-libbing saved many a situation when someone missed a cue. The majority of bouquets, applause, and everything else goes to Bill Trotman and his excellent portrayal of the right honorable Senator McKinley. Bill, a newcomer with plenty of experience and talent, did a wonderful job of mixing pompous dignity and dry humor to turn out a very superior performance. He was, without a doubt, the mainstay of the entire play. As we have said before, congratulations, Bill. Mary McNeil, as Mrs. McKinley, did not seem to be able to decide whether to laugh or cry. Most of the time, she simply wandered around as if lost in the intricacies of the plot. Mac Bulgin was definitely out of place as General Biddle. He lacked the pompousness of the senator, and his boot-licking was a little too obvious. In closing, let us hand out a bouquet to Wylie Smith and the stage crew for an excellent job on the set, especially the window, and one to Bob Gay for a good job of directing. A final word of admonition to Elliot Braxton to relax and do away with that flaming nose, and to Nancy Copeland for her slightly too obvious cockney accent. The play was generally a success—we congratulate the Masquers for one of their best productions.

America’s Place In The World
By GABRIEL LOWE

A few weeks ago a very distinguished speaker, a man who has travelled widely all over the world spoke before this student body on America’s place in the world today. He said that “America is so great and so powerful that it cannot move without the rest of the world trembling; and if it does not move the world holds its breath in anticipation.” This is the position in which the United States emerged from the recent war. It is not an enviable one, to be the policeman, banker, and guardian angel of more than half of the nations of the world. This position reduced Great Britain from the world’s greatest and most respected nation to a third-rate one, devoid of a stable economy or a military force, and completely worn out. There is nothing inherent within the British system of government or the character of her people that would have reduced her to her present state of humiliation. It is just that the task of being the dominant nation in the world is too great for any nation to bear over a long period of time. What made Britain ripe in the nineteenth century for the kill will surely reduce the United States in a much lesser span of years in the twentieth century. (Continued on Page Six)
