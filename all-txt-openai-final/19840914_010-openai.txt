10 Friday, September 14, 1984 / The Davidsonian

Welcome, Freshmen. On this page, we hope to give you something to remember Orientation by, for better or worse, and perhaps get you started on that Davidson safety valve â€” Charlotte.

Davidsonian Photo Editor Peggy Pierotti designed the page, senior Wilson Lowrey drew the map, and the photo staffs of The Davidsonian and Quips and Cranks shot the pictures.
