**Narratives swagger in folk-tinged rock of Counting Crows**

By Rachel Newcomb

By the time you read this article, I’ll be in Morocco. However, I couldn’t leave without telling you about what
I feel is one of the best new bands of the decade, Counting Crows. Their 1993 release, *August and Everything
After* is one of the finest albums I’ve heard by a new group in years. I was blown away by
their performance on *Saturday Night Live*, and their record has won them the *Rolling Stone* critic’s award for best new
band of the year, an honor richly deserved.

Hailing from California, Counting Crows writes folk-tinged rock music that has drawn comparisons to the Band and REM. However, the
band carves out a niche all of its own, taking a fresh approach to songwriting.

"In the middle of the night, there's an old man threading his toes through a bucket of rain."
- "Omaha," by Counting Crows

None of the songs are harsh or grating, and all manage to convey a strong melody and a clear mood
or meaning. Lead singer and songwriter Adam Duritz has carefully crafted songs that are extremely intimate, stunning in their poetic
imagery and visceral intensity.

Throughout the album, Adam Duritz’s narratives are swaggering. “Omaha,” one of my favorite cuts on the album, is a chilling
hymn to Middle America. Opening with a haunting organ and mandolin melody, “Omaha” is full of brilliant lyrics delivering a
tale of cycles and anonymity set against the backdrop of farmland. “In the middle of the night/There’s an old man
threading his toes through a bucket of rain,” Duritz croons solemnly in a wavering and emotional voice.

“Mr. Jones,” which you may have already heard on the radio, is one of the strongest songs. Beginning with stark
vocals, a guitar rhythm, and slowly adding drums and bass, it is impossible to deny the song’s overwhelming sense of
sadness despite the jangly, upbeat melody. “Believe in me/Because I don’t believe in anything,” Duritz sings plaintively as he tells
the story of a man and his drinking companion, both searching for meaning in a meaningless existence.

Other songs on the album excel as well. In “Blue Buildings,” the soft, carefully modulated music provides a background to
Duritz’s reflective lyrics. “Anna Begins” is an ambivalent love song, while “Rain King” is a lively, eclectic tune that makes
allusions to Saul Bellow’s novel *Henderson the Rain King*. “Ghost Train” is extremely quotable as well, with lines like “Remember
everything/When only memory remains.” Many of the songs describe a sense of alienation without alienating the listener, which results in
a feeling of being brought into the music rather than being pushed away. The music creates a thoughtful, contemplative mood
rather than a depressing one.

Although I hate to compare them to another band because they are so unique, it is possible...

**Whatever happened to Coal Miner's Daughter?**

By Geoff Graham

Something strange occurred to me while writing the top ten list for last week’s article. In Country music, it seems,
the times, they are a changin.’

Number one was (I’m sure you remember, but there may be a deprived few out there who missed it) Radney
Foster’s “Easier Said than Done.” It’s a serious and realistic attempt to describe the aftermath of betrayal. Number four was
Doug Supernaw’s “I Don’t Call Him Daddy.” Here, a father tries to fit into his young son’s life after divorce
and distance have done their best to separate the two. Number five was Sawyer Brown’s “All these Years,” in which
Mark Miller voices a couple’s helplessness when an affair emerges in their decades-old marriage. These aren’t the typical songs we
expect to hear on a Country station.

Whatever happened to “Take this Job and Shove It,” “Tennessee Whiskey,” or Loretta Lynn’s “Coal Miner’s Daughter?” Whatever happened to
“Elvira?” True love, the plight of the working man, and rural roots still have a strong hold on much of
Country’s subject matter, but new forces gain ground every year.

A few years ago, Alan Jackson released “Here in the Real World,” and artists seemed to take him literally. Clint
Black and Garth Brooks, being two of the big shots in the industry, currently enjoy the freedom to break away
from the mold with songs like “The Thunder Rolls” and “A Bad Goodbye” (even “Killin’ Time” has some definite suicidal
overtones). However, the trend doesn’t simply end with the superstars. Hal Ketchum’s 1991 release, “Long Day Comin’,” exemplifies the new
type of song in...

**Collie paints the battles after the war**

By JoshLarned Soldier’s Heart, an exhibit by Charlotte resident Kate Collie, is currently on display at the Visual Arts Center.
Through these series of portraits and recorded dialogue of a Vietnam veteran (Steve Piscitelli), the artist attempts to relate to
the viewer a story that is together shocking, illuminating, and frighteningly real. Collie examines a subject that is all too
often overlooked in today’s society: the plight of veterans who live with the grim actuality of suffering from post-traumatic stress
disorders. It is no doubt that the artist’s intentions in developing this particular study were designed to create a message
decrying the dire effects of battle upon the individual. Collie describes in her artist’s statement that “In order to turn
the powerful feelings generated by these facts into a coherent and, I hope, profound anti-war statement, I chose to do
an ‘expanded portrait’ of a particular Vietnam combat veteran as a series of paintings accompanied by documentation in the form
of letters, first-hand accounts, and hospital reports.” Indeed, the artist successfully achieves her aim as evident in the paintings themselves.
Each portrait is a particular episode from Steve Piscitelli’s actual Vietnam veteran experience and the results of the war. “Monterey,
April 1969,” like a blurry photograph—an inaccurate rendition of reality—depicts Piscitelli as an idyllic youth in proud stance, readily anticipating
glory and the prospects of serving his country. This portrait serves as a stark contrast to its successor entitled “Da
Nang, February 1970.” Here in shades of blacks, whites, and grays, Collie paints a wounded Piscitelli being awarded the Purple
Heart by a superior in a military hospital. However, it is not the setting and palette of the picture which
frightens but the actual countenance of the protagonist himself... Piscitelli is changed as his scarred demeanor reveals the intense mental
anguish and fear encountered during his tour of duty. In subsequent episodes, Collie examines the widening rift in Piscitelli’s personality
brought about by an inability to eliminate a “combat mentality.” “Soldier in a Shooting Gallery” and its accompanying documentation powerfully
convey this fact with harsh irony as in this instance for Piscitelli, the carnival became a metaphor for the existence
which had escaped him as a result of his tour. In “Darkness Descending,” Collie returns to a palette primarily consisting
of dull grays to express how the disturbed Piscitelli at that point strongly contemplated suicide as a means of escaping
his burden. Finally, “Residuals” concludes the exhibit with harsh realism as it shows Piscitelli with a handful of pills—his only
escape from a continual nightmare. This exhibit is both powerful and thought-provoking. For those interested in the artist and her
work, Collie will conduct a lecture, “Vietnam: Notes and Echoes,” Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., in the Multipurpose Room.

A new look at tradition
By Jonathan Brooks

Leo Steinberg, a retired Ben Franklin Professor of the University of Pennsylvania, graced Davidson students with a series of inspirational
lectures on topics ranging from Michelangelo’s Pieta to Picasso last week. Steinberg, who learned English as his third language by
reading James Joyce’s Ulysses, provided Davidson with what Dr. Larry Ligo regarded as a “remarkable two days... a continuous feast
of ideas.” Within two days, Steinberg shared five lectures with Davidson students and attended a luncheon with the students going
on the art trip to Rome. Junior Lizzie McRee, an art history major, felt that Steinberg offered what “people studying
art need to hear... an approach that is interactive... first looking at the work... rather than reading what critics have
to say.” During Steinberg’s first lecture, “Why I Am Unfit to Speak on Contemporary Art,” he expressed that since the
early 1900s, art has been the subject of much hostility from those who have raised the cry that “this isn’t
art.” When posed with this same question, Steinberg believed that “every new, original statement in art arouses fierce opposition” and
that, rather than asking “is this art?” the observer should ask, “what problem is the artist attempting to solve?” Often
in contemporary art, one might hear the criticism that “I could do that” or “my own child could do that,”
but Steinberg challenges the observer to “just do it, then.” Steinberg promises that the observer will have “revelations” by putting
his criticism to the test. He recalled challenging a colleague to do just that when criticizing a work of contemporary
art. When his friend’s attempt was compared with the original, the friend was able to distinguish that the artist had
accomplished what he himself could not. See Leo on page 15.
