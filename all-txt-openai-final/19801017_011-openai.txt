Housing remain adamantly opposed to constructing new dorms. They insist the situation is under control, that temporary units are not
counterproductive, and that the anticipated enrollment decline will remove the problem once and for all. On the other side, however,
is the curious and puzzling statistic of the rising percentage of students coming back to live in the dorms, instead
of seeking off-campus housing.

“There are less rules about alcohol and bringing women to your room. Many rules are now options. Many left because
they wanted to do things in their apartments that they couldn’t do in the dorms, but that’s no longer true,”
said Fredricksen.

“That is certainly a factor housing officials had better look at instead of just the enrollment predictions,” cedes Dale Meador,
director of residential facilities at Western Illinois University.

Davidson’s field hockey team scored their sixth victory over High Point yesterday with a score of 2-1. Less than three
minutes into the game, Cathy Inabnet carried the ball downfield shooting for the left outside but was blocked by High
Point's goalie. Their clear was redirected by Beth Davidson as the Cats were on the offensive again. Davidson was in
command 80% of the time with hard drives and leading passes but could not seem to get the ball in.
Sally Craig had a beautiful stop off a defensive drive and passed to Inabnet, but still no goal.

Two minutes 40 seconds later High Point’s wing broke wide and to the left. Cathy Morrel in a one-on-one situation
drove her to the right but could not stop the shot. As High Point gained possession after the bully, Davidson’s
defense was ready. Katie Dagenhart intercepted and the Cats were again on the offensive. Not for long, however, because High
Point again broke loose. This time Beth Davidson had doubled back and was in position to force the ball wide,
preventing a potential goal.

With 20 seconds left in the half the Cats decided to even the score. Inabnet dodged three close defensemen for
a beautiful shot placed in the left-hand corner. The score was tied at the half but the Cats went back
out determined to seal the victory. It took 28 minutes with Davidson on the offensive most of the time to
do it. With 6 minutes left to go the Cats executed the picture play. Carol Heppner broke loose.At midfield, Courtney
Hall received a wide pass, dodged her opponent, jumped over her, carried the ball to the circle, and passed to
Inabnet. Cathy’s shot was so well placed that the goalie was on the ground, and the spectators were on their
feet cheering.

**Hockey wins three in a row**

High Point was the last in a string of victories for the Cats. On Friday, they traveled to Duke (Division
I) and beat them 2-0. Courtney Hall and Lisa Ballantyne scored in the first half. They then traveled to Greenville
to demolish ECU 10-0. Cathy Inabnet scored four goals and Amy Crittenberger one in the first half. Carol Heppner and
Lisa Ballantyne each scored two in the second half, leaving Inabnet to score her fifth. The defense played a good
game Thursday, led by Center Half Amy Crittenberger. Dagenhart and Ashley are positioning well and covering the open man. Melanie
Atwood, new to the position of sweeper, is communicating well with Morell and proving the duo a tough pair to
pass. The Cats’ record is 6-3. The next home game is Friday at 4:00 p.m.

**Men’s CC beats UNCC, women win in European**

One hundred and thirty-four dedicated souls permeated the Davidson backwoods Saturday morning in the 10-kilometer European Cross Country Championships. Incorporated
into the open division was a Davidson-UNCC men’s dual meet, won by the Wildcats 18-45. John Davis (34:00) and Jeff
Morrow (35:13) finished 1-2 for the squad, nudging UNCC’s Mark Price (35:28). The next seven collegiate places were taken by
Davidsonians Randy McManus, Terry Morrow, John Rees, Danny Armistead, David Barnes, Dave Stosur, and Tim Ritchie, in that order. Also
braving the course, complete with wooden barriers and water obstacles, were the Women ’Cats, competing only among themselves. Victorious Marian
Hill and second place Carrie Nunn were followed closely on the 5-kilometer path by teammates Melissa Peacock and Merris Hollingsworth.

Both the men’s and women’s teams will compete at the State Cross Country Championships to be held in Raleigh. The
men, now 7-4, will face a tough assortment of 15 or 16 schools, including favorites North Carolina, Pembroke, Appalachian State,
and Duke. Only the top seven Wildcat runners will compete in the championships. The women’s division, with favored North Carolina
State, will be run at 10:00 a.m. on Saturday, with the men to follow at 11:00. Runners not in the
top seven will compete in an earlier open meet.
