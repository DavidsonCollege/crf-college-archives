“Think On These Things”

By ED GOLDEN

Last Sunday evening the student body heard the Rev. W. M. Boyce of the First A. R. P. Church of
Charlotte. Mr. Boyce had two texts, Hebrews 11:6, “Without faith it is impossible to please God” and Mark 9:23, “All
things are possible to him who believeth”. These two texts made up the subject on which he wrote, “Faith is
Fundamental.”

Our country is called a Christian nation, but if we were broken into our component parts it would be evident
to all that we are as shallow and irreligious as can be. The business men are planning for their own
profits without regard for the rights of others. The educational system does not sanction religious meetings in the schools. It
is not impossible to please God, but without faith it is impossible, so follow the example of Enoch who had
faith and because of his faith was translated by God. We too can find God’s purpose for our lives by
faith. Another significant statement made by Mr. Boyce was that faith is fundamental to progress. Progress is goodness. We must
attempt the impossible. We must give our best, because God would have us do it that way. So “Think On
This” ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE TO HIM THAT BELIEVETH.

On Wednesday at chapel, Dr. Cunningham gave a very impressive talk on the need for prayer for the meeting that
began on the 25th in San Francisco. We seriously should “Think On This” and in doing this we need some
earnest prayers because as Dr. Cunningham said, we might be entering into a new era of the world’s history. So
much depends on the outcome of this conference because the peace of the world hangs in the balance. Prayer is
so needed in these critical times, and who are we to shun our duty and privilege? By the time this
has come from the press the issue will have been decided upon so our prayers go with the Davidsonian to
press that God in His infinite mercy and power will give to those men the power to mould peace, that
will cause all enmity to the plans for a just and durable peace and love to fill the hearts of
men in a federation of brotherhood. Yet this is impossible unless we sweep around our own doorsteps. So let’s bravely
and sincerely face the problems of the future with confidence in ourselves, but with faith in God that His omnipotent
spirit will guide us through the future.
