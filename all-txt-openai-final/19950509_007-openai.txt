### Horoscopes

**Taurus (April 20 - May 20):** Since the Sun is currently passing through your birth sign and is opposed by Jupiter, this should be an interesting birthday. Your life may become a bad Bugs Bunny rerun, so watch out for falling anvils and pianos. Also, any frog singing “Hello my darling” should be avoided. As always, patience is power and you're going to need it. Since Bugs is for kids, it is not very likely that you will get much play. But hold tight and personal satisfaction will abound.

**Gemini (May 21 - June 20):** You may be feeling a little down these days because no one is giving you the credit you deserve. Well, you can blame it on planetary discord. Don’t worry, you are not being followed by little men in green suits. And your mother didn’t hire a hitman to kill you off. You may want to use a little extra Nair, though. Summer is coming and it's good to stay updated. Eventually, you will have to put on a bathing suit. If you are in an embarrassing situation, like on the 25th, just admit you are gay and get on with it.

**Cancer (June 21 - July 22):** Your high hopes of winning the KA Rose were not in the stars. Most likely, you will sit on your ass doing nothing and complaining about how much work you have. If your ex-girlfriend calls, hang up. She is screwing your best friend. As for pets, it will become clear on the 7th that you want a gerbil. The planets just don’t agree with you these days.

**Leo (July 23 - August 22):** Your ruler, the Sun, was aspected by Jupiter earlier this month, which means someone is going to aspect you. There is a train at the end of the tunnel. Those dreams about water will only get better, but try to hold it in. There is no way to tell when you might get a surprise morning visitor. Your friend Woody will probably be up in the morning, too.

**Virgo (August 23 - September 22):** You are entitled to respect and admiration, and if you can’t get it, you can buy it. But that could land you in jail, so remember, ask if they are a cop first. As for friends, you don’t have any. On the 17th, someone will give you a package. Take it to the gatekeeper and he will unwrap it. Just remember to discard it after you are finished.

**Libra (September 23 - October 22):** Financial troubles abound. On the 13th, you may have to just beg. Try the corner of Main Street and Concorde. During the solar eclipse on the 10th, it may be a good time to admit to your parents that you quit school. Perhaps they might explain to you that you could still afford a home if you didn’t buy so many drugs.

**Scorpio (October 23 - November 21):** You will be dealing with a minor health problem for the first part of May, but don’t worry, that dry, itching feeling will go away if you drink a lot of water. You appear to be doing things the hard way, and unless you stop giving too much attention to others, you will end up as dry as the Sahara Desert. Take a break. Just talk for a while.

**Sagittarius (November 22 - December 21):** Jupiter, your ruling planet, is a little pissed off at the rest of the universe. This means that everyone hates you. Give up. Kurt Cobain didn’t have it as bad as you do.

**Capricorn (December 22 - January 19):** The planets are with you! Despite your tendency to get tangled up in a big mess these days, you will find a new maid on the 15th and boy is she hot. And since she loves to clean, you can get into all the messes you want. Watch out for people carrying big sticks, however. Remember, your new woman loves broom handles.

**Aquarius (January 20 - February 18):** Have you noticed that there is a lot of hair building up in your drain? That means hair loss. If you are a senior, people probably think you are about 30. Take off your hat and take pride in your head. Now they look alike.

**Pisces (February 19 - March 20):** You will die on the 17th.

**Aries (March 21 - April 19):** Your mother is so poor, I saw her walking down the street kicking a can, and I said, “What you doin’?” She said, “Movin’.”
