The women’s tennis team closed out its season by winning two of its last three games against UNC-Charlotte and Wofford, but the team suffered a tough loss against Furman. The team ended its season with an overall record of 17-5 and a 7-2 conference mark.

On Tuesday, Davidson won its fourth-straight match when the team blanked rival UNC-Charlotte by a score of 7-0. Kelsey Linville ’08 and Virginia Berry ’10 won by a score of 8-6 in No. 1 doubles. Berry and Linville also added wins at No. 2 and No. 1 singles, respectively. Michele Fanney ’09 and Kim Whelan ’08 tallied their fourth- and fifth-straight wins, respectively. Also adding another win to her overall record, Alison Rauh ’11 won by a score of 6-1, 6-1 in an impressive match.

On Friday afternoon, Davidson beat Wofford by a score of 6-1. Getting off to a head start, Davidson won at both No. 1 and No. 3 doubles to gain the first point in the match. Linville ’08 and Berry ’10 earned their 12th and 13th singles wins, respectively. Teresa Wang ’10 captured her 11th-straight win at No. 6 singles when she won by a score of 6-3, 6-3. Meredith Skeeters ’08 and Kim Whelan ’08 finished off the match with wins at the No. 5 and No. 3 spots, respectively. Skeeters received her 14th singles win while Whelan earned her team-high 16th win.

On Saturday afternoon, the women’s team held its Senior Day in its final regular season match. Despite their final two wins, the team had trouble against Furman and suffered their first loss in five matches. Despite the final score of 7-0, Davidson put up a fight with two matches going to three sets and one going into a super tiebreaker.

Davidson will head to Charleston, S.C. on April 17 to begin the SoCon Tournament.

Rollins shines at Palisades Classic

The golf team shot a final round 322 to finish 14th Tuesday afternoon at the second annual Palisades Collegiate Classic. The 54-hole event was played on the par-72, 6,797-yard Palisades Country Club layout.

Chris Rollins ’11 led all Wildcats by shooting a 72 for the tournament. After sitting tied atop the individual leaderboard following an opening round 67, Rollins scored a lackluster 78 in round two Monday afternoon.

Luckily, Rollins bounced back on Tuesday to shoot a 72, his second round of par or better in the tournament.

Despite his strong showing, Davidson could not use his scores since he registered in the tournament as an individual. Co-hosting the event with Davidson, the nationally-ranked Charlotte 49ers won the team title with a final score of 856. Davidson will tee off at the 2008 Southern Conference Championship April 20-22 at the Country Club of South Carolina in Florence, S.C.

McKillop then asked each Senior to tell their fans something about Stephen Curry they may not know, to the crowd’s great amusement. Luckily for Stephen, his teammates were kind, and did not reveal any dark secrets—although Meno made the crowd laugh when he said that Stephen is the ever-popular “Sooze Set Caroline.”
