Chez Les Francais Ideas For Senior Gift Announced by Wicker Phi Society Is Narrowed to Six

Quite a furor was created recently when Professor Day gave the latest checkup on the books in the library. He had found 50 books missing. These books had been taken from the library without being checked out at the desk. Nothing was done about the matter at the time, but lately there has been a rumor going around that the library might be put under closer supervision.

Wicker, chairman of the committee for the annual Graduation and Seniors, has recently announced that several suggestions for the senior gift have been narrowed to six ideas for a vote by the senior class in the near future.

Six Suggestions

The suggestions are as follows:

1) A technical equipment fund for the Davidson faculty, to be expended for technical equipment.
2) Paving the grounds of the Quadrangle.
3) Pavement in front of the Chambers Building.
4) A loan fund for students.
5) A typical Davidson bookplate.
6) A fund for the elimination of expenses for commencement and assessment.

Professor Davidson, Librarian, and several members of the faculty have expressed interest in the question “What would you think of the ‘closed stack system’ for the College Library?”

A discussion was then held of the various merits of the closed stack system. Professor Davidson stated that the material had been turned in and compiled, but that he was quite optimistic about the issue and was sure that it would be a good one.

The Grace Ramsey Literary Society held its final meeting of the year last Tuesday night. At this meeting, the newly elected officers were installed in the final ceremony. The officers elected for the following year are: Al Bixler, president; Dave Newbold, vice president; Charles Irwin, treasurer; and Mr. Fred Shadd, reporter.

Members of Le Cercle Francais presented “La Lettre Chargee” and “L’Homme de la Nuit” in the Chambers Auditorium Friday night, April 29. Above is part of the cast in a scene from “L’Homme de la Nuit.” Left to right they are Sid Crane as Maggie Bennett, Al Cates as William Halters, Don Davidson as Flossie Bennett, and Bob King as Edith Halters.

Rev. Burney to Speak

On next Sunday night at the vesper hour, Rev. L. P. Burney, pastor of the Sugaw Creek Presbyterian Church, will address the assembly. This pastorate was held once by the first president of Davidson College, Dr. Robert H. Morrison, before he was called to head this school. The following Sunday, Dr. Price Gwynn of the faculty will conduct the communion service held annually at this time. No further speakers have been booked at this point because of the irregularity of the school program during the end of the year.
