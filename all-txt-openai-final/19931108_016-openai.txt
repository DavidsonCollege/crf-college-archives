Men's Soccer falls in rough tournament game to end season

Soccer continued from page 14

Proud senior class. With only 19 players left on the field, Davidson had one more out of the player with
a right hook to the midsection. Marshall’s goalie attempted to come to his winded teammate’s rescue. Both Haile and the
goalie were ejected. The victim of Haile’s punch voluntarily sat down. Interestingly enough, Haile broke free on a breakaway. Goalie
Neal Andrews deflected the first shot, but the rebound went directly to a Marshall player, who scored the winning goal
for a 3-2 victory. With less than 20 seconds remaining, Davidson had two shots on goal that were deflected and
the season was over. The overtime period was the sixth of this season.

WED Nov 10 at UNC-Chapel Hillwhere the Cats suffered with a 1-3-2 record. Haile and Tommy Suter were named to
the first team all-conference, while Andrews and Hayes were selected to the conference’s second team. The loss brought the end
of five seniors' illustrious soccer careers. They are sweeper Ed Denning, midfielder Andy Haile, striker Ben Hayes, defender Rob Malinzak,
and midfielder Bryce Smith. Malinzak will most likely head off to medical school and Haile can do whatever he chooses
with class-leading credentials. The loss also brought to an end the decorated career of Ben Hayes. The nine goals and
four assists this season bring his career totals to 29 goals and 13 assists. These totals move Hayes to third
in career goals and a tie for third in career points. He is currently fourth for the single-season points total
as well. Hayes also received the Southern Conference Tournament MVP trophy in 1992. The most memorable goal of Hayes' career
is certainly the header he made in the NCAA semifinals last year that stood as Davidson’s only earned goal of
the game. Though the season can be safely considered disappointing, there is much to look forward to next year. Freshmen
Fernando Campos and Keith Kleeman started almost the whole season, while Robert Clarke and middle-season addition Stephen Thomas received lots
of playing time. Returning from injuries will be freshmen Chad Lagerway and Coley Dominaik along with goalie Alex Deegan, who
opted for a medical redshirt, securing two more years of competition. The 1994 season will also include the return of
John Sampers, the team’s third-leading scorer in 1992. His offense, experience, and leadership will be expected for the Cats to
rebound. Davidson will have seven returning starters and four returning injured players, that will be stacked with two all-conference goalies.
The offseason will be important to the team’s success, so it’s OK to begin thinking about “next year.”

If you ask Jason, he'll say hoops is a god

Jason continued from page 14

If you think about it, everyone can contribute in basketball. The NBA has guys who are as short as 5’3”
and as tall as 7’7”, a height range that I trust encompasses most of us here at Davidson. It can
be played alone, with ten people, inside or outside, night or day, and it usually doesn’t require funds. Generally, if
you’re an athlete, you can contribute on the hardwood in some degree, and even folks who aren’t terribly athletic tend
to enjoy trying to play the game. And surely, anyone can enjoy watching the sport. I reckon all hoops fans
everywhere have games they won’t forget. For me, I snuck into a Duke-Carolina game in Cameron Indoor Stadium when I
was in sixth grade, and got to watch the Devils beat the Heels in Johnny Dawkins’ last game at Duke.
After the game, I got all the Duke players to autograph a ball I had snuck in with me. I’d
bronze that ball if I could. I remember watching Michael Jordan score 63 points on Larry Bird in a playoff
game during his rookie season. I celebrated when the greatest player ever won his three titles, and I walked around
in a daze for a while when I read he’d retired. Basketball affects you, it gets inside you and affects
your mood and your psyche. Clearly a Godly invention. I can’t wait to get home and hoop it up with
the family over Thanksgiving. Those guys can’t stop me, I’ll be all over them, just you watch. Swish.
