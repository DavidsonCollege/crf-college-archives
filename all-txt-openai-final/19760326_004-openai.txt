**College seeks to purchase rare lands on Rocky River**
By CHUCK KENNON
Managing Editor

Davidson College officials are currently involved in negotiations concerning the possible purchase of a 15-acre tract of land along the
Rocky River, according to Craven E. Williams, Vice President for Development.

“The land is of special interest because of the unusual amount of rare plants growing there, most notably the fern
Pellea wrightiana, there being only one other small colony east of Oklahoma. This site, in Stanly County, is also geologically
exciting; it is the only area in the state with 100-foot tall slate cliffs,” Professor of Biology Tom Daggy stated.
He said that Tom Hatley, class of 1974, and several classmates had come across the area while hiking. The location
had not been previously reported and the Davidson College Biology department quickly notified other schools about the find.

Williams explained that “The place is mostly owned by a lawyer who owns the surrounding land and is selling it
to contractors for development. The various people from different schools who have become involved with this have acted to preserve
the bluff and its flora.”

In a meeting Tuesday night in Albemarle (in Stanly County), Hatley, Woody Connette '74, representatives from UNCC, the Botanical Gardens,
Daggy, Business Manager Robert Currie, and Biology Professor David C. Grant, discussed with the owner the feasibility of purchasing the
land. At the meeting, a Dr. Libby from Albemarle, a retired Air Force colonel described by Daggy as “interested in
conservation,” made a $1000 deposit in good faith toward the raising of the remaining funds.

“We're very sympathetic to this cause,” Williams said, continuing, “and we aren’t thinking about contributing a set amount. We'll give
our fair share, a modest amount in conjunction with the other schools.”

The area has been proposed for registration as a national Natural Landmark, with “the highest priority in North Carolina,” according
to Williams. The conservationists have now been granted a limited time to obtain sufficient funds and Daggy indicated that they
will soon meet with the Stanly County Commissions to seek a sizable contribution. “If they help us it will be
one of the few times in the country a county has contributed like this,” he noted.

Grant stated that there are several different ways in which Biology Department personnel are attempting to raise money. “Getting funds
from the college is one of our ideas, and another is contacting alumni who majored in biology. Individual contributions will
be warmly welcomed,” he hinted.

The richness and outstanding variety of the botanical wonders found around the cliffs excited Daggy. He said that botany experts
from as far away as the University of Michigan have become interested in the site and will help to preserve
it. “This area is interesting for more reasons than the exceptional fern. A professor from UNCC, and he’s very experienced
in this field, said that it contained probably the best community of chalk maple, hop hornbeam, and leatherwood trees that
he’s seen. None of them are common in this state,” Daggy explained. He added that there was a rare species
of mustard there also.& BEERS VEAL PARMIGIANA other 315-1449 Arabis laevigata Missouriansis, rarely found in the Piedmont region. "The potentials
for field studies in botany and ecology are too valuable to waste. There are varieties of plant life unmatched in
the eastern United States, and we’re grateful for the opportunity to preserve them," he continued. Daggy concluded by praising Hatley
for "his selfless efforts in organizing the attempt to save this land. He has put in much time and effort,
all at his own expense, in stirring up interest."

Spencer gives basketball stance

They will in all reality come from the Wildcat Club program. College President Samuel R. Spencer, Jr. explained any possible
increases in monies allocated to the basketball program. "If you are committed to a national level program you’ve got to
be willing to spend at least what is required in comparison to other private institutions involved," he said. "The money
wouldn’t come out of the College’s regular budget," continued Spencer, "nor would it be a capital funds program."

"The pool of basketball players we have to choose from is much smaller than it would be at a less
demanding institution, however," said Spencer, "the new coach is going to have to work very hard to find players, black
or white, that are qualified academically."

"We'll constantly search for the Bill Bradleys," he continued.

There is a certain amount of faculty and student pressure against Davidson’s attempt to return into the national basketball limelight.
Professor of Religion Max E. Polley is "generally against financial aid for athletes." "You’re talking about buying an athlete," he
said.

POLLEY

Polley maintains that the ‘price’ paid by the students, specifically athletes, who find themselves put in the position of playing
NCAA Division I basketball at a school with high academic standards is far too high. "I believe that if the
alumni and student body knew the price you pay for national prominence, it would not be desired," said Polley. "I
just don’t think it’s good for Davidson," he continued.

Having a nationally ranked basketball team is "a source of embarrassment to a faculty member. You have to explain you’re
not letting academic standards fall," said Polley. "I believe that athletics ought to be extracurricular activities," said Polley.

Spencer reiterated the explanation that a nationally ranked basketball team would greatly aid the college, mostly through national publicity. According
to him, the sports media found Davidson "a phenomenon. Here’s a small school with high academic standards which made people
sit up."

Associate Editor of The Davidsonian, Tony Snow concurred with Spencer to a degree. "The faculty hated Driesell," said Snow. "But
if you look at the records, the sixties were when Davidson had more of its fellowships and more of its
Rhodes scholarships than ever."

"People go to school for the wrong reasons," he concluded.
