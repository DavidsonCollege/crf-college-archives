1997 graduate
dies tragically

PEYTON ZACHARY LACY
1975-1997

By JESSICA GOODSON
News Editor

Sometime between 2 a.m. and 4
a.m. Tuesday, former student Zac Lacy
died of carbon monoxide poisoning at
his home in Irwin Lodge.

Lacy had reportedly backed his
car up to the apartment, channeled the
exhaust from his car through an open
window, and gone to sleep on the sofa.
A student in a painting class held at the
Lodge found Lacy at 3:52 p.m. Tuesday
afternoon and called police. The medi-
cal examiner ruled the case as a suicide.

Lacy graduated last spring with a
B.A. in English and a Concentration in
Gender Studies. More recently, he
worked as 900 Room Manager and a
College Union Operations Intern.

On Thursday at 4 p.m., a memorial
service was held for Lacy at Davidson
College Presbyterian Church.

Chaplain Rob Spach and Assistant
Chaplain Brenda Tapia worked in con-
junction with friends to organize the
service which included songs and po-
ems composed by Lacy’s friends, read-
ings from the work of James Joyce, and
a selection from one of Lacy’s public
journals. The service closed with ev-
eryone present singing the Age of
Aquarius from the musical Hair.

A reception after the ceremony
allowed friends to write a few words to
remember Lacy in ledgers which were
then given to his family.

During his career as a student at
Davidson, Lacy served as Outpost
Chairperson of the Union Board, junior
and senior editor of Hobart Park, volun-
teer DJ and Assistant Program Director
of WALT, and was founder and Execu-
tive Managing Editor of Libertas.

He also served on the Media Board
Faculty Committee, the Public Lectures
Faculty Committee, participated in
Friends of Lesbians and Gays, and
worked for WCNC-TV.

Lacy is survived by one sister,
Mamie Alexis Lacy, parents Noni and
Peyton Lacy, Jr., and two grandmoth-
ers, Virginia Richey Lacy and Greta
Laurice Spruill.

Lacy remembered at memorial

By MICHAEL J. KRUSE
Editor in Chief

On Zac Lacy’s forearm was a tat-
too depicting a caricature of James Joyce
— “a filter between my brain and my
hand” when I write, Lacy would say.

Joyce and his writing, as English
professor Zoran Kuzmanovich ex-
plained at a memorial service Thursday
afternoon, was “one of the pillars of
Zac’s world.”

Kuzmanovich, who advised Lacy
until his graduation in May, other fac-
ulty, administrators, students, and
friends gathered in the sanctuary of the
Davidson College Presbyterian Church
to mourn Lacy’s death by celebrating
his life — one of ambition, passion, and
intellect.

“Zac created a world in which he
was able to help himself and others —
gay or not — rise and meet and be
themselves,” Kuzmanovich said.

“He spent his time rubbing away
at the line that separates life and art.”

A mentality that, Kuzmanovich
reasoned, “led Zac to a state of flam-
boyant fragility. And then fragility
prevailed.”

The service consisted primarily of
musical selections and literary excerpts,
fitting for a man whose life was so
shaped — perhaps even defined — by
the written word and the corresponding
endless thought processes.

Music included “Travel Light” by
Tender Sticks, “Rhapsody in Blue,” and
selections from the musical “Hair,” in-
cluding “Age of Aquarius.” Diane
Krause, a senior, performed on the pi-
ano a song she composed in Lacy’s
honor.

Dan Mojonnier read from Walker
Percy’s The Second Coming and
Kuzmanovich read from works of James
Joyce.

German professor Scott Denham
read from a public journal Lacy com-
piled in that course in his Kafka class in
the fall of 1995.

“Everyone waits,” Lacy wrote. “I
am also waiting, but I don’t know what
for. I’m not waiting for death, although
that’s a possibility. The best you can do
is to get at knowledge, get an inspira-
tion, then get lost in your own mind.”

“Words can’t express all of the
feelings we are feeling right now,” said
Katie Hall, speaking on behalf of Lacy’s
friends. “But we do want to tell you that
we love you. We love you so much.
Thanks for giving us the inspiration to
get through this lifetime without you.”

Splashed by early morning sun, a caterer readies Chambers front lawn for
Friday’s inaugural luncheon. The event marked the grand finale of Bobby Vagt’s
inauguration as the 16th president of the College.

Inauguration runs smoothly

The inauguration of Robert
Fredrick Vagt as the 16th president of
the College began with a flourish Thurs-
day evening and continued through Fri-
day afternoon.

From the casual dinner at Vail
Commons to the sophisticated proceed-
ings on Chambers Lawn for students,
faculty, trustees, and honored guests,
the inaugural festivities were a success.

Balloon archways marked the en-
trance to the inaugural banquet at the
Commons. Light jazz, steak dinners,
and an assemblage of patriotic decora-
tions on each table contributed to the
relaxed, yet festive atmosphere.

Davidson officially welcomed its
new leader Friday morning under a
Carolina blue sky. The event began as
participants in the academic procession
filed down the aisles to their front-and-
center seats.

Charles Edward Raynal III, a min-
ister at Davidson College Presbyterian
Church, opened with an inspirational
invocation.

Chairman of the Board of Trust-
ees, Walter Olin Nisbett III, welcomed
the audience, and a series of speakers
representing alumni, students, faculty,
