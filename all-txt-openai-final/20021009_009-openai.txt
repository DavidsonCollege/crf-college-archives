To Div. II or not to Div. III, That is the question

Since we arrived here in late August, Davidson has been receiving all kinds of national media attention. Kaplan cited the school as one of a dozen “hot” colleges nationwide, US World News and Report ranked Davidson the 9th best liberal arts school in the country, and USA Today awarded this fine institution an NCAA Academic Achievement Award. And then, in the most recent edition of Sports Illustrated, Davidson was named the 195th best sports college in America, just behind such powerhouses as George Mason and Idaho State.

There are only 324 Division I schools in the country, which means that Davidson falls in roughly the 60th percentile (that’s right—below average, people). Every single Ivy League school was ranked ahead of us, and four Southern Conference members are considered better sports colleges than Davidson. To add insult to injury, our caption in the magazine read: “Basketball made NCAAs; 25% of 1,672 undergrads on varsity teams; high-SAT student body taunts foes: ‘we’re not stupid!’” Please don’t tell me people at Davidson actually use that cheer. Everybody knows that students here are very smart, but chanting ‘we aren’t stupid’ is like Mike Tyson proclaiming, “I’m not stable.”

Speaking of smart, Davidson does share the highest graduation rate for athletes with Rice University. Rice, however, is the 45th best sports college, 150 places ahead of us. Look, everyone loves the fact that little ole Davidson is a Division I school and from time to time our teams make a splash on the national level (e.g., Men’s basketball last year and men’s soccer this season). But when was the last time Davidson won a national championship? Our athletics website reads, “In the past two decades Davidson has participated in the NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Championship, Men’s Soccer Championship, and Women’s Volleyball Championship, plus has won a national championship in women’s tennis.” Past two decades? Come on. That’s like saying your wife was attractive 20 years ago. Furthermore, the aforementioned national championship is the only one in Davidson’s 165-year history and was won in 1984 (before many freshmen were even born) at the Division III level.

And as a small Division I school, Davidson doesn’t stand out as much as we all like to think. College of the Holy Cross, the 26th best liberal arts school with an undergraduate enrollment under 2,800, is ranked 197th by Sports Illustrated and boasts a 90% graduation rate. All the other top-10 liberal arts schools in America (and the top 25 for that matter) are Division III members, and most do exceptionally well at that level. Williams College, the 2nd ranked liberal arts school in America, was named the best Division III sports school by Sports Illustrated: “By the end of [last] school year Williams had won three D-III national titles, its 31 teams had gone 595-50-1 and... Williams earned its sixth NCAA Division III all-sports trophy in seven years.” The similarities between Davidson and Williams are many, especially in the academic arena. Athletically, however, Williams is winning championships, whereas most Davidson teams barely stay afloat in the Southern Conference.

Last year alone, only two Davidson teams finished SoCon play in the top three (men’s soccer and basketball), and just six of 16 teams wound up in the top half. Davidson’s combined record for the 14 teams that kept win/loss records for the 2001-2002 year was 134-180 (.427). Men’s teams put together a 72-87 (.453) record, while the women finished at 62-93 (.400). Translation: Davidson teams lose more than they win. Division III schools are allowed to have both a men’s and women’s team compete at the Division I level, such as Colorado College with men’s ice hockey and women’s soccer.Hypothetically speaking, should Davidson switch to Division III, either the men’s basketball or soccer team should retain their Division I status (although many other programs are certainly on the rise), and on the women’s side several teams could make a strong case to do the same. Many people will argue that student-athletes come here to compete against the best of the best, and I agree that for a lot of athletes this may be the case. At the same time, however, the word “compete” seems to take on a whole new meaning. Last year, the baseball team lost to #4 South Carolina 15-0, and most recently the field hockey team dropped a 12-0 decision to #13 Duke. Not much competition going on there. This is not to say that our athletes can’t compete at the Division I level. And trust me, I have the utmost respect for anyone that wears the Davidson red and black. My point is, though, that it may be beneficial for Davidson, both athletically and on the whole, to compete for a national championship on a consistent basis, and not just once every two or three decades. After all, isn’t it time that the 1984 women’s tennis team becomes a thing of the past? Davidson athletics has the potential to be a dominant force nationally, just not at the Division I level. Sure, our teams win about half their games, but the school’s attractiveness would increase exponentially if some teams were taking home national championships each year. This isn’t little league anymore. Although playing for the love of the game is still important, college sports put slightly more emphasis on winning. Not everyone gets to play, and there isn’t always ice cream afterwards. Davidson needs to put itself in a position to win games, and not just 40% of them. Williams won 92% of its athletic contests last year, a remarkable accomplishment at any level. And if Davidson would switch to Division III, our teams would be just as successful.
