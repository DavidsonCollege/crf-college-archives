**Citizens Organization Elected For Community Improvement**

By MARK DEATON
Asst. Managing Editor

A steering committee was elected by the citizens of the Davidson community Monday night to form an independent citizens' organization for the betterment of the community and to discuss problems of Davidson. Davidson Community Relations Committee Chairman Tony Abbott, who convened the meeting in the auditorium of Davidson Elementary School, expressed concern that the Community Relations Committee had become overextended.

“The Davidson Community Relations Committee was formed primarily to sponsor better understanding, communication, and harmony between the different racial, social, religious, and economic groups in the community,” Abbott said. “One of the major purposes of the committee was to prepare the town for integration,” Abbott added. “Now that the work of integration has been pretty thoroughly accomplished, we hope that this new citizens' group will take over much of the responsibility of making Davidson a better community,” Abbott said.

Davidson citizens at the meeting voted unanimously to form a non-profit corporation for the purpose of community improvement. A steering committee of twelve citizens was elected to decide on a name for the group, seek a charter, set up by-laws, and help to select a permanent committee.

**Stolen Books Prompt Checker**

By LEX VEAZEY

Last year over 200 books were stolen from the library at Mary Washington College, amounting to approximately $2000 in replacement costs. Noting that this loss of books led to a definite breakdown in service to the people using the library, Ruby Weinbrecht, head librarian, decided to institute several new procedures. A checker has been installed in the library lobby to watch for books not signed out by students. Students and faculty also are required to identify themselves at the door, and visitors must give their name, address, and reason for using the library.

In another step taken to prevent book thefts, students can no longer take books out of the reserve room. “We realize the inconvenience to students by the new desk check, but we are simply trying to improve our services,” explained Weinbrecht. “The loss of books slows our work down because, instead of adding to our collection, we are replacing books. Often the books cannot be replaced.”

**Students Protest Calendar**

For several weeks the 1973-74 academic calendar at Western Carolina University has been a subject of controversy. Proposed by WNC Chancellor Jack K. Carlton, the calendar adds three weeks of classes and shortens Christmas and summer vacation. A similar calendar proposed by Carlton for the current academic year had already been rejected by the student and faculty Senates. Last week WNC students marched on the chancellor's home to protest next year's calendar. As a result of faculty and student protests, Consolidated University President William Friday has decided to investigate the WNC squabble.

**Exam Honor System Discussed**

Before exams were taken at Randolph-Macon College, a mandatory assembly was held for all students concerning the honor system as it relates to exams. The responsibilities placed on students by the exam system were explained, and questions concerning the pledge and what does and does not constitute an honor infraction were answered. All students were required to sign a statement indicating that they fully understood their responsibilities concerning exams and the honor system. No student was allowed to take his exams until he had signed the statement.the citizenry for the committee to explore included lack of parks and recreation facilities, pre-school education, lack of town beautification and sanitation, dog control, lack of bicycle paths, recycling, lack of advertising of public events, and the need for Davidson to remain politically autonomous. Former Davidson YMCA President Larry Duncan called for more interaction between students and the community. “Many students forget they're a part of the Davidson community. Their only ties to the community are with the post office which they visit twice daily,” Duncan said. Mrs. Erving McClain spoke for the black community. She cited four areas in which improvements were necessary. Mrs. McClain called for “equal and not token representation” on major town boards, attempts to keep all members of the community equally informed of events in Davidson, year-round recreation for children, and community fairness where “you don't have one strike against you just because you're black.”

“Davidson is a special community in that it is really three communities," Abbott said. “I kind of like the imagery of three-in-one; it’s trite but significant.”

“The Community Relations Committee will still exist as an advisory group to the town board,” Abbott explained. “However, this new steering committee will be forming a completely independent citizens organization.”

“The independent citizens organization is a more idealistic group than the Community Relations Committee,” Abbott said. “Perhaps as a result of this group, town board meetings will be better attended,” he added.

Abbott expressed delight with the Monday night meeting. “It's one of the best turnouts we've had for a community meeting. I'm very pleased with the enthusiastic response and the willingness of the citizens to speak out,” he said.

Dawson Boys Back For Debut In Love
By FRAZIER MARSH

“We're working our way up the Davidson music scene,” says Robert Dawson of the Dawson Boys. Robert, 22, and his brother Ed, 23, first performed at Davidson in the Morrison Room of the old student Union in 1969. They have since performed in Chambers and will now give the Mid-Winter concert in Love Auditorium next Friday at 8 p.m.

The Dawson Boys have been playing together for 11 years. Robert says, “We decided to dedicate ourselves to the music scene, our music is a serious thing to us.” The music of the Dawson Boys is a type of “country-folk rock” according to Ed. Both brothers, swapping leads and harmonies, sing and play acoustic guitar. Rob also creates music with a 12-string guitar, mandolin, piano, and electric guitar. Ed complements his brother on the five-string banjo. However, they have also metamorphosed the Beatles’ “Hard Day's Night” into what Ed calls “bastard bluegrass,” with Ed's banjo accompanying Robert's Carolina accent.

Though the Dawson Boys do not have a record yet, they are talking to several companies and expect to produce one soon. The Boys have played on the New York Coffeehouse Circuit as well as in top-name clubs in New York. “Cash Box” says, “The Dawson Boys are a cool breeze on a hot summer's night,” and “...they are bound to happen as sure as the wind blows.” They will happen here at Davidson during Mid-Winters, so be sure that you and your babe make the scene in Love. It should be a real...“Hold-Up!” Bob and Ed Dawson sing sounds of the Carolinas.
