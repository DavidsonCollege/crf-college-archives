### Mallard Head Country Club: A Diamond in a Lot of Rough

As the home to year-round golf, North Carolina boasts numerous golf courses capable of spoiling any good walk. Only those open to the general public, however, offer the excitement and danger that can transform a simple sport into an almost religious experience. Indeed, public golf and private golf are two entirely separate entities, kind of like ham and spam. Sand traps and water hazards are not the only obstacles the public golfer must avoid, as beer cans, McDonald’s wrappers, and divots the size of potholes give new meaning to the term ‘play it as it lies.’

Playing the game, however, is only half the fun—especially at Mallard Head Country Club, conveniently located off exit 33 right next to a strip mall. For a measly ten bucks, one can play nine holes on weekdays at Mallard Head, whose illustrious name suggests several US Opens have been held there, but whose greens certainly indicate otherwise. Upon first inspection, one might assume Carl Spackler, the neurotic greens-keeper from the cult-classic Caddyshack, has been given full responsibility over Mallard Head’s rolling fairways and undulating putting surfaces.

As an added bonus, the holes at Mallard Head are intricately woven through people’s backyards—or it may be that the houses have been strategically placed on Mallard Head’s fairways—and during any given round, shots will arise requiring a nine-iron over some local’s lawn furniture while a rabid Doberman howls in your backswing. Mallard Head is the only golf course in North America, to the best of my knowledge, where water hazards include above-ground swimming pools and cart paths double as residential driveways, basketball hoop included.

My favorite golf course property has this—barbed wire fence outlining the resident’s estate just off the 16th fairway with hundreds of golf balls scattered in the backyard. Retrieving one of these balls, however, would require a bullet-proof vest and feet quick enough to elude several of the aforementioned rabid Dobermans, which apparently are quite popular in these parts.

Speaking of wild animals, remember that Super Bowl commercial a few years back with the cat herders? Well, those cats now reside at the farm on the right side of Mallard Head’s 15th hole. As proof, just last week my buddy saw at least one hundred of these cats crossing the fairway, impeding the progress of his cart for a solid three minutes. As the story goes, and this may be a rumor, the man who owns the farm once had a few cats and never neutered them. One thing led to another, and now the guy boasts the greatest cat collection in the Western Hemisphere. The farm owner apparently refuses to feed the cats, though, so a lady on the left side of the fairway puts out bread and milk once a day for these multi-colored strays, who flock like hippies to Woodstock when it’s chow time. Sounds like a scene from a low-budget horror film.

And just last week, on the tenth hole, my second shot nearly decapitated an innocent civilian, who was crawling around in the tall grass searching for golf balls. A strange sight indeed, but what was I going to say to the guy? After all, it is his backyard.

**Despite Strong Individual Showings**

The Davidson swim team faced its toughest competition yet against East Carolina University. The men’s and women’s teams both lost, but many individuals came away with their personal best times, proving that Davidson truly stood up to the challenge of its first away meet of the season.

The men’s team, despite the loss, showed off the true colors of its underclassmen this past Saturday. Sophomore Foster Mathews swam his in-season best times in both the 200 breaststroke (2:14.00) and the 200 individual medley (2:09.01). Sophomore Michael Paul Flowers placed second in both the 1000 free (10:03.45) and the 200 backstroke (2:02.29). Freshman Steve Tolson reached a commendable time of 22.32 in the 50 free. Freshman Brad Poole’s...Vigorous efforts came through for Davidson in the 100 free (49.1) and the 200 free (1:46.3). Commented senior Diego Marquez on the men’s competition, “I think the guys all realized that this was a chance for us to step it up and swim against probably the best competition we will face before CAA’s. Looking at the individual swims, there is a lot to be happy about.”

The female Wildcats, like the men’s team, did not win but showed strength in their individual competitions. Sophomore Lauren Taft swam her in-season best in the 200 butterfly with a time of 2:14.92. Sophomore Trisha Blackwell’s strong dedication to training and swimming paid off with her in-season best time of 2:07 in the 200 back. Junior Vanessa Witt beat her personal best times in the 200 free (1:57) and the 200 fly (2:09). According to sophomore Jamie Sasanfar, with the agreement of many of her teammates, “Vanessa Witt is off to an incredible start to the season and is a swimmer you should look out for in future competitions.”

Although the swim team left ECU with the loss, they came back to Davidson with a strongly optimistic outlook on the rest of the season. The men’s and women’s swimming and diving teams return to action on Saturday, Nov. 16 at UNC Wilmington at 1 p.m.

The women’s soccer team gave a solid effort in its first-round game at the Southern Conference tournament on Friday, but the Spartans of UNC-Greensboro outscored Davidson 4-1 on penalty kicks after the two teams played to a 1-1 tie through 110 minutes of intense soccer. The ‘Cats finish the 2002 season with an 8-11-1 record.

The first half was tight and scoreless, but Davidson got on the board in the 67th minute when Denielle Erikson fed Leigh Anne Hoskins for a strike past UNCG goalie Jennifer Stillman. The Spartans, who entered as the defending tournament champions, then turned on the heat. In the 77th minute, the Wildcats were called for a handball in the penalty box, and midfielder Rakel Logadottir, who was named to the all-tournament team, scored on the penalty kick. The Spartans continued to dominate and outshot the ‘Cats 5-1 in the overtime periods, but thanks to Sarah Hobart’s outstanding game (ten saves), the score remained tied through regulation and two overtimes.

After the Spartans scored their first penalty kick, sophomore Stephanie Bouts matched to tie it at 1-1. Alia Antonucci-Alter almost scored on Davidson’s second try to tie the score at 2-2, but Stillman made an outstanding save. Two more goals by the Spartans clinched the victory. The Spartans lost the next day to regular season and eventual tournament champion, Furman.

Five seniors played their final game in a Wildcat uniform on Friday. Lauren Dennis, a psychology major from Charlotte, started in 79 games out of 82 in her four-year career and scored two goals and five assists in that span. Versatile Meghan Ferriter, an anthropology major from Fort Benning, Georgia, played both midfield and defense this year (after playing goalie last season). Amy Johnston, a biology major from Dublin, Ohio, scored two goals and has started 61 games in the past three years. Heather Maloney, a biology major from Ridgefield, Connecticut, scored nine goals in 2002, increasing her total to 36 in her career at Davidson, second all-time. She also had 23 assists and was named first-team all-conference. Her sister, midfielder Tara Maloney, also a biology major from Ridgefield, scored four goals this year to tally 14 goals and 22 assists for her career and was also named first-team all-conference. Freshman Kara Koehrn from La Mesa, California was named the Southern Conference freshman of the year, and she was a second-team all-conference selection.
