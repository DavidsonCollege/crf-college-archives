### THE DAVIDSONIAN’S 75TH Anniversary Issue - April 1989

The 1960s. What comes to mind? Hippies? Vietnam? The Beatles? Marches?

How about freshmen wearing beanies? Or Queenies and Salem imports swarming Belk and Richardson during big weekends? Or keeping alcohol in the locked trunks of cars because it wasn’t allowed anywhere else on campus?

How about getting a date for Homecoming through a computer dating service? Or being “campused” for the weekend for misconduct?

At first glance, the Davidson of the 60s might seem an alien place to you.

Walking around campus, your curiosity might be aroused by talk of the Betas, the Sigma Chis, or the Pi Kappa Phis. There were twelve fraternities on the Court in the days before self-selection.

Rush chairmen were frustrated. In 1965, rush regulations prohibited upperclassmen from going into freshman dorms or giving freshmen rides. They prevented freshmen from going into the frat houses until December.

The party climate was different; alcohol was not permitted at any Davidson function—on or off campus.

People hotly debated the drinking issue. A poll done in 1962 showed that a majority of the students drank regularly. Interestingly, many students, as well as staff members, also felt that Davidson, as a Christian college, should not allow alcohol consumption. By the late 60s, feelings had changed; the drinking restrictions were repealed.

Students cheered when chaperons were no longer required at off-campus parties and when women were finally allowed in the dorms.

ROTC units drilled all over campus, since participation was involuntary until the end of the decade.

On Sundays, professors held open houses after the mandatory vespers service. Later, the administration replaced vespers with required attendance at local churches.

Students protested the Professor Religious Oath. To obtain full professorship, faculty members had to declare their Christian beliefs. Student and faculty pressure led to the demise of this rule in the mid-1960s.

Many things first appeared in the 60s. The computer, which we all know and love, made its debut in 1963. Students first started griping about Humes. The SGA was created. The independent study program began. Dr. Kuykendall joined the staff with a position at the Alumni Office. The Cunningham Fine Arts Building was completed.

The 1960s saw the golden age of Davidson basketball. Coach Lefty Driesell and the 1965-66 team captured Davidson’s first-ever Southern Conference title, and the Wildcats advanced to the NCAA tournament. The team also experienced many victories under the coaching of alumnus Terry Holland. Football had some moments of glory as well. In 1965, two players—the first in 29 years—received All-Southern Conference bids. The team posted victories against such schools as Furman and the Citadel.

In 1962, Davidson officially abolished segregation, feeling that racial prejudice contradicted the school’s basic Christian values. Throughout the remainder of the decade, the school strove to encourage black applicants.

The United States faced violence in Southeast Asia during this time. The rapid escalation of the Vietnam War caused massive disruption on many campuses. Although described by some as “a hotbed of inactivity” during the era, not even quiet little Davidson could remain completely untouched by the conflict. A 1966 poll showed that most students and faculty supported U.S. involvement in the war. By the end of the decade, however, opinions had changed. Perhaps this change occurred when someone could look in The Davidsonian and find the numbers picked in the draft lottery or the obituary of a classmate killed in the war. The war became a frightening reality; it affected everyone.

Although Davidson remained comparatively conservative in its protest, students participated in events such as the 1969 peace march in Washington and the National Vietnam Moratorium. The Moratorium was an event calling attention to the war.
