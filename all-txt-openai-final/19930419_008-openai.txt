#### "horse-girl flying..."

By Sara Carlson Taylor

A seat on a sixteen-hand white-spotted appaloosa was my trademark. Other girls tried it, but nobody else had my grin,
my boyish haircut flopping slightly with each stride. Stretched tall, my left foot centered on the wide back of our
cantering horse, my right foot held in a vertical split by my right arm, I stood in a great ‘Y,’
a personal yawn. Few people who know me now can envision me at sixteen performing gymnastics on horses, leotard-clad, balancing,
supported at the waist by the arms of another girl seated in front of me, circling to a steady three-beat
cadence in a twenty-four-foot ring of sawdust, wood chips, and manure. I could feel the rubber sole of my slipper
in my palm, the smile pasted on my lips to please the judges, the grip of my teammate's fingers in
the thin flesh of my hips, and the pressure of her back against my knee. I was vaulting, and I
felt alive.

Puberty—the great betrayal—finally caught me at seventeen. Before then, I knew my body better than any book, better even than
any pony. The arch of my back was my pride, every degree of beautiful curving an elongation of my washboard
ribs. My strong arms could reach my ankles forward and back, bending my body in deep ‘O’s. I was an
alphabet, a fruit bowl, a collection of broken bones and tendinitis. I was a vaulter.

Few Americans have seen the sport of vaulting. It isn’t in the Olympics and is rarely on ESPN. Few stables
outside of Northern California have clubs, and fewer horses can endure a team of eight young people cavorting on their
backs for fifteen solid minutes of easy cantering to the left. We describe it as ice skating combined with dressage,
circus riding, formal equestrian eventing with a creative twist, but it remains a mystery. Like most horse sports, it persists
as a girl’s game; few boys have the patience to learn the body control demanded for safe practice of the
sport.

We gave up a lot for the moments of joyous melding with the spirit of another animal. We sacrificed breasts,
hips, and other markers of growing girls. We kept our body fat low and our balance superb. Most of us
devoted ourselves to our team, forsaking boyfriends and beer—the ultimate suburban markers of social acceptance.

I have a photograph taken at the National Competition held in fire-dry Sacramento on my seventeenth birthday, the last day
I would compete. The sun scorched us. We drenched ourselves with a high-pressure hose before entering the ring; our burgundy
and black leotards were dry in two minutes. I’m on Colin, my favorite of the club’s...

### KP's: A Delicious New Way to Spend Your Money

By Rachel Newcomb

A new restaurant has opened in Cornelius that is definitely worth checking out. KP’s Place is the sister restaurant of
the North Harbor Cafe and opened this past December in Shops on the Green. Recently I had the pleasure of
dining there and sampling several menu items. The atmosphere, friendly service, and excellent food all made my dining experience incredibly
enjoyable.

The decor of KP’s is comfortable yet classy. Tasteful artwork is spaced along the walls, which are muted hues of
green and burgundy. There is a convenient deli for dine-in or carry-out which also houses KP's chicken rotisserie. A wide
hallway lined with racks displays 92 varieties of wine to choose from and leads to a well-designed bar area, soon
to be christened "The Side Door" lounge. Outside, a brick patio with outdoor tables makes the perfect spot for summer
lunches. The indoor furniture is comfortable and attractive. It is a good place for relaxing and enjoying your food without
feeling rushed. The wait staff is very courteous and eager to please the customer.

A diverse menu was the first thing I noticed about KP’s. There is something on the menu to please every
palate, from vegetarian entrées to beef and pasta. For the appetizer, I tried the baked brie, which was rolled in
almonds and served with a raspberry purée. It was so delicious with the freshly baked bread that my dining companion
and I quickly devoured it. We also tried the breaded red snapper claws served with honey mustard sauce, which was
very good. Other appetizers on the menu include stuffed mushroom caps and smoked salmon.

We began the dinner with a light garden salad. The lettuce was extremely fresh and crisp. For entrées, I tried
the Delmonico, while my partner ordered the fresh seafood and pasta. The Delmonico was a very savory cut of beef
grilled and served with cracked peppercorn sauce. It was perfectly complemented by an Idaho baked potato and steamed vegetables. The
fresh seafood and pasta included scallops, fish, and shrimp in a white wine sauce with angel hair pasta.

Best Flicks of the Year
By Scott McLean

I felt a little saucy this week, so instead of the usual review column I opted instead to list my
top 5 favorite flicks of the ’92-’93 academic year. All of these titles will be out on video sometime this
summer if they aren’t already, so in the event that you become bored and just want to sit at home
on your duff and watch an entertaining movie, here are some suggestions:

5. Damage: An excellent pic by French director Louis Malle, this one stars Jeremy Irons and Juliet Binoche as in-laws
involved in a torrid love affair. As an added bonus, the video promises to have the scenes that were cut
from the big screen version in order to avoid an NC-17 rating. This movie is guaranteed to stimulate both your
cerebral and genital regions.

4. Unforgiven: This multiple Oscar winner was also one of my favorites of the past year. I don’t know what
I found so appealing about it, but it was highly entertaining. This is a good one to see with the
guys—Clint Eastwood’s macho character is bound to rub off on you a little so you’ll leave the theater feeling quite
manly. A good male-bonding movie.

3. Basic Instinct/Groundhog Day: Hmmmm... A definite tie. Though “Basic Instinct” came out early last year, way before the present
school year began, I still find it unforgettable, don’t you? I bow before the altar of Sharon Stone. On the
other hand, if good clean fun is what you’re after, nothing will beat the charm of “Groundhog Day.” This is
one of the best live-action PG-rated films to come out in a while. It will provide laughs and fun for
the whole family.

2. La Femme Nikita: This one actually came out a couple of years ago, but when I saw the American
remake Point of No Return a few weeks back I was reminded of how much I enjoyed the original. Anne
Parillaud is excellent as the female assassin Nikita and the whole film merits a big thumbs up. I saw this
movie with my younger sister and even she loved it—that means you’d better run to the store for this flick.

1. Singles: First prize goes to this Cameron Crowe effort which entertained me on so many levels. I felt as
if this were the story of what is awaiting our generation, and because I connected so well with the characters,
it was very moving. A definite must-see for all the twentysomethings out there. Kudos to Mr. Crowe!

Y’all enjoy your summers and be on the lookout for the two major films to be released in the coming
months: Schwarzenegger’s Last Action Hero and Spielberg’s Jurassic Park. 'Til next year, so long.

Student Directed One-Acts Make a Success
By Allison Wright

The Actor's Nightmare, directed by Frank Jernigan, and Minnesota Moon, directed by Ed Cunningham, debuted Wednesday night in the Makeshift
Theatre of Cunningham Fine Arts building. These lively one-acts were two of the most professional examples of Davidson theatre that
I’ve seen so far.

In The Actor's Nightmare, freshman Robert Ramsay was hilarious as George Spelvin, a confused accountant caught in a drama, playing
the main role in a play that he never knew he auditioned for, much less rehearsed. Upon finding himself in
a scene from Hamlet, Spelvin delivered some wonderful, random lines from various Shakespearean plays in an attempt to save face
onstage, such as his sudden outbursts of “To be, or not to be...” in response to completely unrelated lines. Perhaps
the funniest moment in the act was when the stage hand, played by Garbriela Marti, appeared on stage as a
maid with a script to help George with his lines. Kate Dunlop and Rachel Hornor were wonderful as George’s various
leading ladies and both played off his lost, anxiety-filled expressions with incredible finesse. Dunlop’s haughty yet frustrated demeanor as Sarah
Siddons was instrumental in heightening the humor in George’s pathetic attempts at acting. Myles Louria was perfect as Henry Irving,
the stereotypically pompous director (ascot included, of course) in George’s nightmare.

Minnesota Moon was a wonderful comedy about friendship and change in a small town in Minnesota. Patrick Brown as Larry
and Edwin Thomas as Alan successfully incorporated the sensitive, often tragic moments in the dialogue with the funny, redneckish characterizations.
The overriding plot was male-bonding at its finest, one last night of getting drunk and “chewin’ the bit” in a
deserted barnhouse before Alan leaves for college. But the dialogue touched on serious subjects such as the death of a
friend, the Vietnam War, and future prospects, with realism and depth. With a dramatic subject matter and only two characters,
Minnesota Moon was a risk. But the talent displayed by both the director and the actors was more than enough
to successfully deliver the play.

Truthfully, I normally steer clear of one-acts and prefer full productions, but these performances converted me. (“I laughed, I cried,
it was better than CATS...”) Anyway, congratulations and thanks to the cast and directors of The Actor's Nightmare and Minnesota
Moon for a perfect blend of humor and depth in two thoroughly entertaining performances.

Go See: The Chickenwire Gang
Tonight, 9:30 p.m. in the 900 Room.
