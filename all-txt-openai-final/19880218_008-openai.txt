**Dawn**

Walking naked through the wildly-greening fields
Wielding ripe peyote wings, a young chief kneels,
Pondering a morning trip to paradise:
Fire flowers burst into bloom behind dark eyes.
Whirling, worldly knowledge giving way to dream
Sanctuaries brightly-lit in candle gleam;
Aching fragments long to kiss the greater soul:
Basking in that permanence (which reason stole).
Wake up, little one...
Your dawn has come.
Taylor Mayo ‘89

**Our Kind**

Carrion in the halls of the educational institution
Carrion on fire in the educational institution
Fire at the educational institute
Fire ringing in the yuletide again
Carillons of burning carrion
Seething carrion licks the last oxygen until it dies
Dies dies in fire-lice
The lucked have escaped but the guilty have too
Too too several BH aay wernt
Just say no
The lake campus is blazing among the boats
Trucks from the Port City VFD lean the dead general’s ladders up to the burning crown of lake lobollies
Hook & ladders riding onto the burning mar!
Helmets saluted behind sheets of red and yellow
A column of cloud rising off the lake campus
While back in the halls of the educational institute
With its alumni files
Jingle bells and joy to the world, the last time
A new order will arise
But only beetles in their burning shells sparkle in the halls
As the host assembles under bells in smell

Inside Art
Our Escapades
Smooth rhythms, smooth contour between that squirrel and the brown limb
Runs like water in and out, light and dark, a rope which loops life in our rain forest.
Cardinals tip the space-holding tree with red in the advent season.
Evenings are haunted by the ermine moths.
The operators of the bulldozers are wearing blindfolds.
We untie and peer closely.
Even blinder are the eyes beneath, blind driving plus blindfold!
Others say cross-eyed, others cockeyed, others pie-eyed.
May we present this year’s Bambi Award?
Hey, Halloween’s over. Isn’t there a leash law against pitbulldozers?
Just say confidence is a grove of space-holding trees.
Aeolus puffs and tiny escapees sail away beneath golden parachutes.
Just say confidence was a grove of space-holding trees.

Hey Johnny why don’t you come out for me,
Let's go see what the rocks look like in the shadows,
I’ll show you the shiny black stones.
Come on Johnny you know you know the paths,
The rusted squeal the screen door made as it closed,
Its panels checkered patterns interwoven like the shaping of a lie.
Through the wing door gate, the rough ground padded bare feet.
Smooth worn earth broken ahead by the wheat field shifting with the wind
(The coils of the snake the man told us)
The burned pews of the older church we crawled into
Through shards of a brittle glass lining the blank

Poet Caudate
Windows I wanted to climb up to see the half twilight moon reflected in the shiny surface of the church

But you took my hand in yours and led me away from the tarnished bellpull.
Away through the near darkness from the

**The Dead of Winter**

“Sorrow and snow fall white, the same on a winter’s night,”
He had been trying to set that poem to music for over an hour now,
Trying to make the piano sound like falling snow,
But his fingers kept returning to an older song, a song from a year ago.
In the window over hisRight shoulder when he turned he could see the snow falling sideways, the wind in the
snow, the impression of forms, twisting, moving, dancing, in the first snowball of the new year, and he alone, looking
at the keyboard, the blacks and whites, the scales and arbitrary patterns and the sounds which justified themselves, filling up
emptiness. Music is sound in time. Filling up emptiness and time, trying to compose in the empty college choir room,
but he had finger memory and not note memory, he played best with his eyes closed, and his fingers kept
returning to the older song of a year ago, and he let it come, a song less like sorrow and
falling snow and more like the wind in the snow. He leaned into the piece and felt arms encircling him
suddenly from behind, kept right on playing as he felt her warm breast pressed tightly against his back. He didn’t
even have to turn to know who it was. He smelled her hair as she pressed her warm cheek against
his cold ear.

“Yes. And I did it just for you, Dorma,” he said. “Do you remember the first time I played for
you? You cried that night.”

“Yeah, I did,” she said, “but not for you Wesley-boy.”

“Are you sure?” he said. She hugged him tighter as he sounded the last chords of the piece. The silver
field shone through the window. It had stopped snowing.

“Want to walk in the snow?” he said. Away from the Fine Arts building, out under the snow-hung trees, they
stopped, in the pale light of sparse lamps. She put her arm in his.

“I remember our first walk,” he said. Late summer a year ago, she had grabbed his hand like a bolt
of sunlight and led him skittering through the few early autumn leaves. “You're just like sunshine, Dorma,” he had said
to her in the dappling shadows of branches, “just like one of these trees, reaching for the sunshine.”

“Yeah,” she said, “I’m just like a tree, just like one of those syrup trees,” with laughing eyes, “You have
to stick this thing in ‘em to get the sweet stuff to come out!” she said, squeezing his hand.

He had repeated her, laughing out loud. And he felt he had just the thing, too. He could safely say
he’s never met a girl like this.

“Boy,” she said caressing that word with her mouth as she always had. “How did you know I was here?”

“Oh, I heard you playing, and I knew it was that boy.” Happy just to be that word in her
mouth.

“Look at all these trees,” he said, tilting his head toward hers and pointing with his arm, “all in lace
and white.”

“Yeah, like wedding dresses,” she said.

“They're courting the spring, I guess,” he said, thinking of the long winter ahead, and last year’s long winter past.
The winter after they had parted. Promise me two things, his mother had said. “Please if you are a homosexual,
don’t ever come out of the closet, I don’t want to know, and the other thing is please don’t marry
