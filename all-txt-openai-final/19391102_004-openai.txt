Homecoming Rolls Around

Homecoming brings other Saturday campus. Homecoming at Davidson to es of other days will live again, as “old grads” gather in groups about the campus, and later at The Citadel game on Richardson Field. Those grads will return to see a Davidson team that thus far has failed to chalk up a win against five opponents. The Citadel team will be evenly matched to date, with the exception of South Carolina. They have not entered the arena pitted against teams of their own calibre. Lack of reserves has hurt Davidson this season as it always has. A brilliant passing offensive has sparkled at times; at other times it has looked weak. The running attack has been a consistently weak point. The kicking game has been poor except in the Furman game, when a real team was able to show anything like fine form. On defense, the team has shown up better, but due to lack of reserve strength, the pass defense could be strengthened. Against some teams, the Cats have played like demons; against others, there has been something lacking. State was scared badly before they were able to concoct a last-period winning touchdown pass. Davidson was knocking at the door when the final whistle cut them short. And at that, the Davidson team brought its highly touted team to Davidson the next Saturday and went back with a lopsided win, but with the first points in two years chalked up against them as a result of a Sharpe to Hackney pass. Here again, it was the same old story of too much power. At Bluefield, in the rain, neither team showed much offensive ability, and the Cats were able to cut short every touchdown drive of the Cadets. Only an early safety gave the Squadron a 2-0 win in a game that was featured by sloppy weather and sloppy playing. 

South Carolina worked its deceptive Notre Dame shift to keep them in control until the final whistle. Having two reserves rose, but the three and three Allcof-whiehop tourt 53° ce however, Georgia, fight The House of with their deception time again, with Shetley Furmans gained ground on the like of which hasn't. It remained for a modified Statue-of-Liberty play finally after they had given up no hseqtarters, the lame Vay et rings us up to date, with The Citadel game on deck for Saturday, when Davidson meets a team that has only a meager squad to choose from, which parallels the situation here. When the last quarter draws around, those Keydets will be just as tired, will have just as few reserves to go in and bear the brunt of the play for a while. Saturday will find the team ready for a victory. It looks as if it is the Cats’ time this time.

Davidson Has Edge In Past

Past games give Davidson an edge over The Citadel, with three tie games, 6 back in ‘09. The games have always been fairly close, with the largest margin in 1936 when Davidson won 21-0. The Wildcats' biggest win was in 1928 when they beat the Citadel by fourteen points, 26-12. Averaging the score up, it is seen that Davidson has an average of 12.5 points to 6.5 for The Citadel, a difference of four. Saturday’s game marks the fifteenth renewal of this rivalry. 

Here and there: Both Davidson and Furman completed ten passes last Saturday. Hank Bahnson played his best game so far last Saturday, being through the line time and again for the tackle. Davidson Sports Wildcats Meet Citadel In Homecoming Feature Thurs., Nov. 2, 1939 THE DAVIDSONIAN Page Four Line Star Hank Bahnson, 176-pound junior tackle, has been a standout in the Cat line all season. Hank, having played a brilliant game against Furman last weekend, is being counted on heavily against Citadel Saturday.

Phi Delts Top Touch League

The Phi Delts continued to lead the inter-fraternity race by adding two victories last week to remain undefeated. In the games played last Monday, the Phi Gams nosed out the Vs on EO and the Clowns 4 to 1. The first defeated the Pi Kapps 6 to 0. Kappa Sigs trounced the Betas 18 to 0. Tuesday, the Phi Delts conquered the Sig Eps 12 to 6 and the Kappa Sigs gave the Phi Gams their first defeat 6 to 0. Other Games: The S.P.E.s downed the Betas 12 to 0 Wednesday, and the Kappa Sigs lost to the S.A.E.s on first downs 3 to 1. Friday, the Phi Delts overwhelmed the Betas 24 to 0, the K.A.s nosed out the Sig Alphas on first downs 2 to 1, and the Pikas won from the Pi Kapps by virtue of having a first down and a touchdown to the Pi Kapps' first down. The Phi Delts, with a record of six wins in six games, are on top of the pack. Next in the race come the Phi Gams, with five victories and one defeat. Tied for third are the S.A.E.s and the Kappa Sigs with five and two. Important battles of the week bring together the Phi Delts and Phi Gams, and the Sigs and the Phi Delts. The freshmen, after winning their first two starts, are crippled badly with ineligibles as they prep for the season’s big battle with the Duke. The tailback jinx is going to continue pestering the Cats, with Dave Spencer now being in the infirmary, with Sharpe still ailing from an infection on his forehead. Watch Graham Edwards Saturday—he’s Citadel’s team ran into an assortment of youth and managed to break into the win column.

QUESTION OF THE WEEK [Continued from Page Three]

...singing but different to some this, it places in spite of is from any other school song I have heard, and it rings in my ears as being the best of them all. David Huffines, Sophomore: I see nothing particularly wrong with the actual composition except that it is not what we need. No one can truly express the feelings for and the traditions of an institution unless he has actually attended the institution and had these things instilled into him. This new piece seems fine because we have never heard it used for any other school. It does not express any tradition, it could easily be transferred to any other school in the same way as “College Ties” suffered. Two years ago, a fine composition was written by Dr. George M. Maxwell, '96, and was presented to the student body. Due either to the method in which it was presented or to the feeling at that time, it was rejected. To me, it seems that many traditions of the school are included in it and that it is a musical masterpiece. It also has three verses instead of one as this rather brief one has. Therefore, not only am I against the adoption of this piece, but I am in favor of reconsidering “All Hail! O Davidson.” Bill Sprunt, Sophomore: I liked the Alma Mater Hymn by Fred Waring—that is, I liked the tune. I do believe that the words sound too standard to be used by Davidson as an Alma Mater Hymn, and it would probably be rather hard for the student body as a whole to sing the tune. The song certainly sounded fine when the Waring glee club sang it, but could the student body sing it in a way that they would be proud of? I don’t blame the author for this, for a person who has never been to Davidson could hardly be expected to have the feeling for it that those who have been here feel. I feel that I am opposed to the adoption of the hymn in its present form, but if the words...perhaps might be altered, it would be acceptable.

Shetley Is Star In 15-0 Cat Defeat
Bahnson Leads Defensive Play, Injuries Check Cat’s Offense

Led by Shetley and Martin, the Furman House of Magic turned on the heat in the closing minutes here last Saturday, and turned back the Cat’s bid for victory 15-0. Davidson was weakened by the absence of Hand and Knoetter, who were withheld from the game because of injuries. Sharpe, Davidson’s ace passer, was kept under wraps the greater part of the afternoon as the result of a skin infection.

Light but fast, Dave Spencer has been a valuable asset to the Wildcats. Davidson's early goal line defense was credited mainly to the outstanding line play of Hank Bahnson. Little Dave Spencer, who took over for the injured Sharpe, played a bang-up game on the offense. Davidson was held in check during the entire first period by the excellent kicking of Martin and Brazil. Dave Spencer kept the Cats out of the hole by his superb kicking.

The Cats were saved from a certain score in the quarter when Coley dropped a pass from Shetley. Led by the outstanding line play of Bahnson, the Cats were able to back the Purple Hurricane during the second quarter.

Cats Get Break

Davidson received her first break of the game shortly after the second half opened. Pennington, Davidson’s guard, recovered Shetley's fumble on the Furman 35. Two penalties in succession moved the ball down to the Furman 25 yard line. Spencer then tossed a pass to Cowan on the 14 yard line. At that point Bill Bolin went off tackle for 3 more yards. Unable to penetrate the Furman defense, the Cats were forced to punt.

Last Saturday’s games had little effect on the conference standings as Clemson, Carolina, Duke, and Furman remain at the top of the heap. In the most important conference game last week, Duke eked out a 6-0 win over Wake Forest. With Wes McAfee leading the way, the Blue Devils hung up their second loop victory this season.

Carolina's mighty Tar Heels again displayed their vaunted aerial attack. Crus out of Pennsylvania 30-6 on Franklin field in the Quaker city. Clemson, even without its All-American prospect, Banks McFadden, rolled to an intersectional victory, sinking Navy 15-7. Furman's Purple Hurricane scored all their points in the last five minutes of play, downing Davidson Wildcats 15-0. The Purple will seek its third conference victory when they play V. P. I. this weekend, while the Wildcats will face Citadel.

Soccer Games

Davidson's soccer team lost its first game of the season to High Point College by the score of 6-2, but won its second game over the High Point YMCA by the score of 4-1. The first half of the High Point College game was played on even terms with the score being 2-2 at the half, but the last half was distinctly High Point's as they scored four goals to none for Davidson. Showing a much better passing attack and more experience, Davidson defeated the High Point YMCA team 4-1, after taking an early lead when Graham McFayden scored, plus later goals by Wilson and Spencer.

Citadel’s Brigade To Invade Wildcat Lair In Homecoming Tilt
Wildcats to Engage Light Brigade on Even Terms; Both Teams Lack Reserves; Graham Edwards To Lead Citadel Offense

Davidson’s Wildcats will oppose the Bulldogs of The Citadel Saturday here in a Southern Conference game which will be the feature attraction of the annual Homecoming program. Rated as stronger this year than last, when they won almost half their games, the Cadets have not lived up to pre-season notice. So far they have won only one of their six engagements, losing to North Carolina, Georgia, Furman, George Washington, and Richmond, and winning from Presbyterian College.

The Bulldogs from the Citadel suffer the same problem as the Wildcats, lack of capable reserves. With a squad of only twenty-five to choose from, Coach Gressette is hard-pressed to find substitutions.

Edwards Paces Attack

The Light Brigade nevertheless will present one of the shining lights of the Southern Conference in Graham Edwards, left half. Edwards is a triple-threater and has been the only offensive weapon of the Bulldogs this year. Edwards has been handicapped by the failure of his line to give him any blocking or protection on passes, as last week against Richmond, Edwards and his passing partner, Hank Foster, were thrown for losses totaling 67 yards when they were tackled again and again behind the line.

Citadel Line Is Heavy

The Bulldog line is big in size, averaging close to 200 pounds. Yet this weighty group gave up 50 points to Carolina’s Tar Heels and 26 to Georgia. Leaders in the line are “Stumpy” Kennedy, powerful 198-pound left tackle, and “Davie” David, veteran end.

Harriers Are Beaten 26-30

Coach Whittle’s Cross Country Team suffered its third defeat Saturday morning at the hands of Washington and Lee University 26-30. Muller of W. & L. covered the 4.2-mile course in 23:42 minutes to place first. Kellogg of Davidson placed second followed by Crocker of W. & L. who barely nosed out Murray of W. & L. for fourth place. Murray (W&L) finished sixth, trailed by Coppedge, Colvin, Parrish, and Mann all of Davidson. Martin (W&L), Herrard (W&L), and Brown (D) took the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth places respectively. Parrish and Gammon also of Davidson crossed the finishing line hand in hand to tie for ninth place in a spectacular finish.

The Wildcat harriers, failing to taste victory in three meets, will rest this week. On November 11 they will face Citadel.
