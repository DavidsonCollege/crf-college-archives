THE DAVIDSONIAN, APRIL 17, 1930

WILDCAT-LAIR:— Rear press Wiese and Side Line Shots At the ’Cats on the Diamond and Courts By P. R. Alderman

The diamond men were unable to take their Virginia opponents into camp as the cagers did earlier in the year, losing two hard-fought contests last week. Williams, V. M. I. twirler, with the aid of four Davidson errors, had little trouble with the Wildcats, allowing only six hits. “Hub” Covington got more than his share in this game by crashing out two singles in three times up. “Doc” Kugler was against the Washington and Lee Generals to fan nine would-be hitters and hold the home nine to five hits. The Wildcats also gathered five bingles but failed to make them count.

Captain in form

The 'Cats’ fielding in the second game was far superior to that of the day before, a double in which Miller, Goodson, and Gladstone featured being the bright spot of the afternoon. But that trip is over and to be forgotten. Today the Wake Forest Deacons are met by the Wildcats for the second time this year, the former exercising the well-known jinx over Monk’s nine a few weeks ago to pound out a decisive victory. Let's help the ’Cats get revenge this afternoon!

Only two more Big Five games remain on Davidson's card for the rest of the year after today and both of these are against the Carolina nine. Which means that the Wildcats have a tough task ahead if they are to raise their average in the state. In spite of the decisive Wake Forest victory earlier in the season, the indications are that the Tar Heels are going to furnish the hardest opposition that the ‘Cats have met with in the state this year. They have been going good all season and have shown no signs of slowing up. Jim Proctor, who has been kept off the initial sack most of the season on account of injuries, will probably be ready for action in the Carolina games next week. His hitting has been missed and it will mean a lot to have him back on the nine.

The Fresh nine, after getting off to a whirlwind start, cut down on their speed when they met the Charlotte High squad, this game resulting in a 9-9 tie. It looked like a sure Davidson victory at first but a rally by the visitors told a different tale. Another slugging test took place the following day when the Belmont Abbey boys downed the Kittens by the count of 11-10. Three pitchers were used by Coach Laird in an unsuccessful effort to stop the home team. The Kitten netmen took Charlotte into camp to win the first battle of the year. Judging from the showings made by the Freshmen it looks like they’re in for a series of victories. Captain Frontis and his varsity racketeers have had plenty of time to prepare for their contests which will start soon. Unless some unforeseen misfortune occurs, most of these should be Davidson wins.

Davidson to Play Three ‘Big Five’ Contests Soon

Wildcats Meet Demon Deacons and Tar Heels in Decisive Games of Schedule

PROCTOR MAY BE IN LINE-UP

Contests Will Conclude State Schedules for Wildcats This Season

With three games scheduled this week with Big Five members, the Davidson College baseball team enters this week on what will probably be the decisive part of its schedule in determining how they will finish in the State race. The Wake Forest Demon Deacons are entertained here today, then Carolina furnishes opposition for Monday and Tuesday afternoons.

The Wake Forest crew has already taken the measure of the Wildcats once, when they exercised the proverbial Demon Deacon jinx on the recent State trip, and came out in the lead at the end of the game. Monk and his men are determined not to let that happen again, and favored by playing on their home ground, the odds seem to favor Davidson, despite the decision they dropped previously.

The Carolina team presents a harder proposition. They have not been met by the Wildcats this season, but their showing with other opposition has stamped them as a powerful club. They are entertaining several of the Virginia teams this week, and it will be interesting to compare the outcome of their games with the Old Dominion teams Davidson encountered on their recent invasion.

The results of the Wildcats on their trip north last week were very disappointing, to say the least. With one game rained out, and dropping the other two contests, their average for the trip was .000. But according to the law of averages, things are due to change back the other way soon, and judging from the play yesterday, it seems like that time is not far off. The absence of Jim Proctor at first base has weakened the entire infield, and has cut down on the hitting of the squad. If he is able to play in top form today and next week against the Tar Heels, the power of the team as a whole will be greatly increased. He has been home recuperating from a recent accident, and it isNot likely that he will be able to hit the top of his stride before the Carolina series. The rest of the squad played good ball on the Virginia trip and bid fair to maintain their performances. The battle for the shortstop position continues, with neither Bernhardt nor McMillan having a decided advantage. McMillan’s hitting is nothing to go wild about, and the fielding of neither would cause the eyes of a big league scout to drift that way. It seems to be the weak spot of the club, but at that, not many balls have gotten by the pair. Following the Carolina game Tuesday, there remain only two more contests on the 1930 card, neither of which are Big Five games. Therefore, the outcome of the three games this week will definitely settle the final position of the Wildcats. With this in mind, it is certain that the team as a whole will put out everything they have to put these three games on the right side of the ledger.

Wildcats Lose Two Games on Road Trip
After the first game of the Virginia trip, the one with V. P. I. had been cancelled due to bad weather, the Wildcats moved over to Lexington, Va., where they faced two stiff opponents in V. M. I. and Washington and Lee University. On the first afternoon, the Virginia Cadets ran their string of victories up to five by taking the Wildcats into camp, 5-1. Ten hits by the Cadets and four errors by the ‘Cats were the factors in the Wildcats’ defeat. Davidson only got six hits off Williams, among which were a triple by Parrish, a double by Goodson, and two singles by Covington.

Another defeat followed the next afternoon, when Coach “Monk's” team fell before the W. & L. nine by the count of 4 to 2. Routin, Washington and Lee's diminutive shortstop, gave his team a hard-earned victory when he crashed one of Kugler's low shots deep into right field in the fifth inning, scoring Cross ahead of him. Captain Kugler, however, only allowed five hits and struck out nine men. The bright spot in the Wildcats’ fielding was a double play, Miller to Gladstone to Goodson.

Davidson Linksmen Beat Deacons, 22-2
Wagner Shoots 72 on Charlotte Country Club Course
Winning easily over the Wake Forest golf team in the first inter-collegiate match of the year, the Davidson linksmen took their measure by a 22-2 score last Saturday at the Charlotte Country Club. In the match, which was played in ideal weather, the Wildcat golfers showed consistency, especially Wagner, who scored the lowest of the day with a 72.

In the individual matches, Captain Jack Pepper won three points with 7 up and 3 to go, Wagner gained three with 9 and 7, John Thompson lost two points 2 and 1 in a close match, but Tom Caldwell defeated his opponent 8 and 3, adding three more points to the score. In the foursome matches, Captain Pepper and Caldwell won 8 points, while Wagner and Thompson won 5 more. This encounter was just for nine holes, while the individual matches were for eighteen holes.

On Monday afternoon, the team journeyed to Concord where they played a group representing the Cabarrus Country Club, the Wildcats again being victors over the golfers, 8-0. Captain Pepper, Wagner, Caldwell, and Hart played three foursomes, and out of a possible 9 points, Davidson won 8 and the other was tied. Last Thursday, the challenge for the fourth place on the team, heretofore uncertain, was played off, Caldwell winning over Hart, and clinching a permanent position on the team.

Cigarette Pleasure
WHY BE SATISFIED with less smoking pleasure when for the same price you can have the luxury of Camels? Camels stand alone. If you merely want to puff, anything will do. But if you want to know the true delight of smoking—to enjoy the mild, mellow fragrance of superbly blended Domestic and Turkish tobaccos, brought to perfection by the most scientific methods of manufacture but with none of the delicacy of its natural goodness lost or spoiled by over-treatment—then Camel is the cigarette for you. You'll find in Camels all the exquisite enjoyment that can be packed into a smoke.
