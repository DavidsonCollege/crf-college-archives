’CATS RISE TO SUPERB
(Continued from page 1)

Every Davidson player who saw action deserves citation, for the play of every one was magnificent, both on offense and defense. However, the following deserve especial praise: Fraley, Brohard, McCall, and McQueen were the most potent in tearing the Carolina line to shreds, gaining by rushing 230 yards to their opponents’ 115, and knocking down 12 of the 18 passes in the vaunted Carolina air attack, and intercepting two. Thad Brock and Steve Brown were the especial powers in the valiant Red and Black line that spelled Carolina’s doom. Time after time, these two brilliant players broke through to spill the Blue and White backs for losses. Magner, Nash and Branch were the big guns of the Carolina attack, while Blackwood and Fysal were outstanding in the line.

To McQueen goes the lead-up credit for the Wildcats’ touchdown. Early in the second quarter, he took the ball and sliced off tackle for 53 yards, putting it on the Carolina 30-yard line. To Brohard and Fraley goes the credit for being the most consistent gainers, and to Joe McCall goes the credit for making the longest Davidson run, 63 yards on the opening kick-off. To Johnny Branch goes the credit for the longest run of the day, a return of a punt for 69 yards. But to the entire Davidson team should go the credit for playing like a band of cats completely wild.

For the last three periods of the game, Carolina was fighting with her back to the wall, seldom having the ball past the 50-yard line. And on three occasions, the Wildcats threatened seriously to score again. Three times the ball was driven within the 20-yard line, but each time the Carolina defense stiffened and held for downs.

Being a dummy, the murderer tries to escape, but finds himself confronted by the Sergeant, and arrested. Jimmy, who has been out with the Sergeant, nervously awaiting the outcome of Susan's scheme, is finally free to come in again, and he receives a warm welcoming, needless to say, for a happy ending of the day’s occurrences, but only a beginning of those to follow. The characterization as a whole was very good, and some stellar dramatic ability was displayed. The choice of the particular play was very commendable, as well as the consistent practice so apparent.—Reviewed by D. D. McBryde.

Jack Murff, Centenary, returned a punt 96 yards for a touchdown, but his team lost to the Texas Aggies, 7 to 6. Robert McNamara, New York University, starred in his team’s 20 to 7 victory over Carnegie Tech, making a 42-yard touchdown and kicking one punt 70 yards.

Shadow of the Tar Heel goal, but the desperate University line awoke sufficiently to mar the ’Cats’ chances for more scoring.

MASQUERS SCORE KIT (Continued from page 1)

Against making a mistake. Carter is a fairly large man, genial, well-dressed, easy-going man, 50 or so, with smooth gray hair and a silvery voice. Besides these, there is the butler, Adams, a typical English major-domo, impersonated by Edward Hancock.

No one ever has to “acquire” a taste for Chesterfields. You don’t have to learn to like them. Smokers take to their pleasing flavor instinctively . . . and here’s why: natural mildness and better taste such as only a cigarette of wholesome purity and better tobaccos can have.

Carter and Laverick, then, with the house deserted, and after careful planning, neatly accomplish the murder of the host, who, 25 years previously, caused them to be sentenced to penal servitude for life; and they left all the appearances behind them, including an open letter as motive, the pistol in his hand as means, and an unusual call on the telephone to the police, saying, “Listen to this,” (the pistol report), which they put in to divert suspicion from themselves.

The second act reveals the workings of the police, and the conclusion that they reached, that the case was one of suicide, since the occupants were all away playing tennis, or, as in the case of Laverick and Carter, had collaborative alibis under different circumstances, eliminated murder as a possibility, and since the position of the body, telephone, etc., eliminated accident. The “police” in this case consisted of P. C. Mallet, a typical rural constable, represented by John Brown, and his son, Sergeant Mallet, a neat, smart and efficient, almost painfully so, detective, trained at Scotland Yard, and the apple of his father’s eye, represented by William McKnight.

In the third act, Susan is first seen alone in the sitting room, in deep contemplation, when Jimmy comes in and begins to discuss the startling occurrence of the earlier part of the afternoon. Susan’s intuition tells her that the case is one of murder. With Jimmy’s whole-hearted, natural, real! Equally genuine is the response of smokers to Chesterfield’s satisfying goodness, its MILDNESS — the entirely wholesome smoothness that are without harshness or bitterness. BETTER TASTE — such as only a cigarette of wholesome purity and better tobaccos can have. Chesterfield Cigarettes are manufactured by Liggett & Myers Tobacco Co.
