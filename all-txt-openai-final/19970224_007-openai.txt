Two ID’s at the door

A recruiting video still shown to prospective Davidson students was commissioned by the Admissions office some years ago. In it,
the day’s last rays of sun lit sweeping vistas of Davidson’s verdant landscape, as Georgian edifices stood strong, like equestrian
statues of eighteenth-century army generals. In short, it looked the way a liberal arts college is supposed to look.

Of course, admissions videos are just advertisements, and any Madison Avenue adman will tell you that a good advertisement understands
and appeals to its intended market. Also, it helps to have a catchy jingle, since music aids in creating stronger
product association. With eleventh- and twelfth-graders ostensibly curious about a Southern liberal arts college as its target audience, the video
had to ensure its viewers saw Davidson as a hip, fun, yet inspiring place with some clout. So the video
opened and ended with a jingle, “Closer to Fine,” by the Indigo Girls, with footage of their concert here.

On the surface, it seemed a fitting slogan, the way “Like a Rock” works for Chevy trucks. Bouncy and strumming,
“Closer to Fine” implies some sort of daily joy, the thrill of being on the quest for fulfillment, feelings one
would want to associate with one’s undergraduate years. Yet, the Indigo Girls are known for being folksy, progressive lesbians as
much as they are for their folksy, progressive music—which in and of itself is not a bad thing. But who
among us would readily associate grass-rootsy lesbianism with Davidson? It seems fairly incongruous.

Using the footage of the Indigo Girls in a Davidson recruitment video highlights the College’s glaring identity crisis. It wants
to have it both ways: traditional, yet progressive; Southern but cosmopolitan; Christian, yet welcoming toward religious diversity. In short, the
College tries to be all things to all people, or at least appear to try to be all things to
all people.

Some may argue that these are not real dichotomies—that a college can be both traditional and progressive, can hold fast
its old roots while growing new ones. Perhaps. But if such supposed extremes can be reconciled, there is no evidence
that Davidson is accomplishing this smoothly. Talk to minority students about what the College does to support them after recruiting
them to enroll, for example. Or ask a non-Christian student how he or she feels walking past crosses on the
way to Chambers. Inquire of a Christian student about the level of anti-Christian sentiment in the student body.Consider the voyeurism
of the annual Sexuality Forum, or former student Yanti Ardie’s Opinions piece last semester which equated international students to freaks
on display. Likely, one would discover that all of these people find themselves stranded between the bucolic Davidson they anticipated
before arrival and the Davidson they came to realize was here first. When students enroll at Davidson, they should be
able to know what kind of environment they are entering. Catchphrases and associations shouldn’t cloud that. In its duality, perhaps
the video is very indicative of Davidson’s identity crisis.

Preserve wooded area on Beaty Street

To the Editors:

Davidson is about to sell valuable city-owned land on Beaty Street, including a pristine, wooded pond, to developers. This land
would better be kept as public land for the enjoyment of the citizens of Davidson, perhaps as a large area
public park with nature trails or as a nature preserve. Perhaps it could be sold to the N.C. Nature Conservatory
instead. One of the last large undeveloped and natural tracts of city-owned land should not be given away to private
developers to destroy this little-known but beautiful public resource.
