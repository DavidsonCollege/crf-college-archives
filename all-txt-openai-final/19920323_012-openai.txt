"Mideast Peace Talks: Land For Peace... NOT!" By Rami El Amine

This article first appeared in The Tongue, but because of a misunderstanding between the writer and the editors, it did not appear as it should have. I also felt that I needed to get the word out to more people so that for once justice rather than special interests would be the decisive factor in Congress.

Back in November, Peter Jennings came on the air following the segment covering the last day of the Middle East peace talks held in Madrid and added, almost as a footnote, that Israel had carried out several air raids on the “suspected” headquarters of guerilla organizations operating in southern Lebanon. If you had not paid attention for the mere three seconds in which it was reported, you might have missed it altogether (unless you are an avid newspaper reader and read about it in the New York Times two days later). The fact is, the bombings had been going on since day one of the peace talks and, as with every raid on a guerilla group, innocent civilians were killed. Israel justified the raids with the same backwards logic; the raids were carried out in retaliation to “terrorist” attacks on Israeli military posts. What is always left out, however, is that these military posts are in Lebanese territory occupied by Israel. Therefore, these guerilla fighters are fighting to regain land which was illegally taken from them.

What is more important is that while innocent people were being killed, the Arab delegations at the talks (of whom the Palestinians were represented by a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation rather than their own because that is what Israel wanted) were still arguing, almost 45 years and thousands of deaths later, that the land belonged to them, rather than confronting Israel on such concrete issues as:
- rejecting U.N. resolutions 242 and 338, which call for Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories in return for a pledge of peace by the outlying Arab countries, after insisting on them for so long.
- increasing settlements in the West Bank, depriving the Palestinian people of an education (Palestinian Universities were closed down in 1987 because Israel felt that they were a breeding ground for protest).
- deporting suspected leaders of the intifada, holding others without a trial and harassing, gassing, beating, and killing the remaining Palestinian population under occupation.

Needless to say, the talks ended with Israel not budging on its new policy of no land for peace and the Arab leadership making no real effort on behalf of the Palestinians who were “not really” represented. The parties couldn’t even agree on where the next meeting would be held. The truth of the matter is that Israel is not going to ever concede any land, let alone grant the Palestinian people autonomy until the United States forces it to. One must understand that Israel’s change of heart with respect to land for peace is not due solely to their right-wing politics, but to economic considerations as well. Before citing these considerations, it is important to note that, in the past, Israel has used national security as a justification of its occupation of Palestine, Lebanon, and Syria (sound familiar?).

unanimous view of the entire faculty, which creates a bitterness that I had never experienced until this year. This is unnecessary. I think a crucial step in truly rebuilding community would be a good faith effort on the part of all members of the community to treat everyone as an equal, and not as an intellectual, or moral, or social superior. I would urge that instead of creating more regulations to govern student life, administrators ought to reaffirm the policy of freedom and responsibility in student living--to concede, for example, that the dorms are the students’ “homes,” and that we have the responsibility of treating our neighbors with respect. I would urge that instead of appointing faculty-chaired committees to bring about change, allow the student body to elect a commission with the authority to re-write the alcohol policy, for example. I feel that at this point, anything is worth a shot: student creativity could be the answer. As of now, the trend towards IN LOCO PARENTIS is propelling us backwards.

Quote of the Week: Some students deliberately set out to become intoxicated. -The "Select" Committee

However, the Gulf War (Operation “Massacre” for all of you who have forgotten) and statements by retired Israeli Generals, who are members of the Jewish Committee on the Middle East (JCOME), have refuted such a claim. This leaves us to ask the question of why the Israeli government insists on keeping the lands? First of all, the influx of Soviet Jews (around 200,000 in 1990) has presented the Israeli government with a land and housing crisis. Where better to get land to build houses than the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and the Golan Heights where there are already settlements, but not nearly as many as we have seen since the influx of Soviet immigrants. Secondly, Israel suffers from water shortages. It has always relied on desalinization plants to meet this water shortage, but they are costly and inefficient. Water in the West Bank is, on the other hand, plentiful and accessible by Middle Eastern standards. The West Bank has, therefore, become a major source of water for Israel. Since the 1982 invasion of Lebanon and the consequent establishment...of the so-called “security zone” extending five miles into southern Lebanon, Israel has acquired a third source of water: the Litany river. Enormous “sucking” machines now draw water from the Litany (which, consequently, used to meet most of southern Lebanon’s water needs) back to Israel. (It's quite ironic that the very same water which sustains us goes to nourish the people who in turn oppress us). Finally, the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip not only provide Israel with a large market, but also with a large pool of cheap labor. So it was no surprise to learn that when the Arab delegations showed up at the State Department on December 4 to continue the talks, the Israelis had decided not to attend until next Monday. Their explanation was that they refused to be forced into negotiations by the U.S. In the end, they did show up but, as expected, nothing has become of these talks which are meeting again in Washington. What has “become,” however, is going on outside the talks and is more crucial to peace than the talks themselves. And here I ask you to join me in doing something about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict instead of simply making a judgment on the whole dilemma and easing your burdened consciences. What I am talking about is the $10 billion loan guarantee which is pending approval in Congress this month. The Bush administration has already made it clear that it will not approve the guarantee unless all illegal settlements are stopped. Of course, this says nothing about 65% of the land in the West Bank and 50% of the land in Gaza which has already been seized by the Israeli authorities, but it’s a start. Your job is to write to your Congressman, Senators, and the President (or call at 202-456-1111) and ask that they not allow the loan guarantee to be passed. Why? Here are some reasons: - The loan guarantees pay for the occupation of land and, in turn, impede peace in the region. - $4.1 billion, 30% of the foreign aid bill, was earmarked for Israel, which makes up .001% of the world’s population, in the 1991 fiscal year. This, I remind you, is a grant. - Though the $10 billion is a loan guarantee and not a loan, the US government would still have to set aside an additional $800 million to $1 billion from the foreign aid bill to Israel. This might seem irrelevant to those of you who feel that the American government will act in our best interest, but if you consider the economic problems we are facing at home you will realize where the need is greatest. If Israel defaults on its payments, which is very likely considering Israel’s present budget deficit, it will be coming out of our taxes. Finally, I do not want to come across as saying that we should stop giving aid to countries in need. But that we ensure that that aid is used to nourish a people rather than dispossess them. With this in mind, here are a few more facts to think about compliments of the Harper’s Index in the December 1991 issue: 1. Acres of land on the West Bank seized by the Israeli government since the peace process began last March: 46,000. 2. Chances that an Israeli “would consider trading territories for peace”: 2 in 3. 3. Percentage of annual U.S. economic aid to Israel that is used to pay debts to the United States: 99. 4. Number of the 6 Democratic presidential candidates who say they support unconditional loan guarantees for Israel: 5. (The intention here is not to denounce the Democrats, but to question their foreign policy agenda which is clearly determined by the campaign contributions of the Pro-Israeli political action committees.)

CHAPTER 6: FEAR OF REJECTION

LOVE SECRET #14: Mock Hostility CAN OFTEN STOKE LOVE'S SMOLDERING EMBERS IN A LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP

LET'S FACE IT: YOUR THOUGHTS ARE GROTESQUELY TWISTED BECAUSE YOU HAVE AN OVERWHELMING FEAR OF REJECTION. BUT, QUITE SIMPLY, REJECTION IS NOT THAT BIG A DEAL. IT MERELY MEANS THAT SOMEONE YOU DESIRE FINDS YOU UTTERLY LACKING IN SOME BASIC WAY. THE MYSTERY OF REJECTION IS THAT IT COULD BE BASED ON ANY NUMBER OF NEGATIVE QUALITIES THAT YOU POSSESS.

OH GOD! WHAT DID SHE MEAN BY THAT?

IT COULD MERELY BE AN INTELLIGENCE PROBLEM: YOU'RE SIMPLY NOT SMART ENOUGH FOR THE OBJECT OF YOUR DESIRES. MANY HUMANS ARE NOT ATTRACTED TO PEOPLE THEY CONSIDER "SLOPPY," "WARTY-LOOKING," OR "DOWNRIGHT REPULSIVE." AS TRIVIAL AS YOUR APPEARANCE SEEMS, IT'S A MAJOR CAUSE OF REJECTION.

MAYBE IT'S A PROBLEM WITH A LACK OF SENSITIVITY ON YOUR PART, ACCORDING TO HER, YOU'RE A SEXIST PIG. BEING A JERK CAN BE A MAJOR TURN-OFF.

I JUST WISH SHE COULD SEE HOW SENSITIVE I AM.

I KNEW I SHOULDN'T HAVE TRIED TO BORROW MONEY ON THE FIRST DATE.

STRANGE AS IT SOUNDS, LACK OF FINANCIAL SECURITY CAN BE A MAJOR TURN-OFF.

OF COURSE, ONE OVERRIDING CAUSE FOR REJECTION IS YOUR BASIC LACK OF SEXINESS—AN INEFFABLE QUALITY THAT SOME FOLKS GOT, OTHERS JUST DON'T.

REJECTION CAN ALSO BE BASED ON ANY COMBINATION OF REASONS, INCLUDING ALL OF THE ABOVE.

I'D GO OUT WITH YOU BUT YOU JUST DON'T SEEM TO LIKE YOURSELF.
