**Moving toward a full week service: College to expand counseling program**

College President Samuel R. Spencer Jr. approved a plan for four full days per week of psychological counseling for the 1975-76 academic year and committed $2000 toward contracting for a fifth day of service. College Psychologist Amelia Dockery will counsel two days each week next year as opposed to her present one day of service. Dr. W. Gatewood Workman and Dr. Meredith Hall will continue to work one day per week. College administrators are hopeful that a contract for a fifth day of counseling will be signed soon.

Students are using the psychologists more this year than they have in the past. This fact has made the expansion of service from 4 to 5 days a week a necessity. “From September to December of 1973, Hall and Workman—we didn’t have Dockery at this time—conducted 100 hours of counseling for students. This represents meeting with 55 students. During the same period in 1974, 156 students used the same service,” said Dean of Students Will H. Terry.

Traditionally, spring term is the heaviest term for the counselors. People’s problems tend to build up to a pitch in the spring. “We need the extra counselor for this time,” said Terry. The present system has Hall working for the college two days a week, Workman and Dockery each having one day. Hall has expressed that in January, February, and October, people were having to wait over a week for an appointment. The study and resulting expansion of services will alleviate the problem.

The study that is being made will be a total evaluation of the psychological program at Davidson. Part of this study is a look at the problems that seem to re-occur with students. “We are studying the patterns of repetitive problems which is a list of problems students have over and over. Each of the problems we are looking at has been confirmed by the psychologists as having occurred at least twice. The problems that seem to re-occur are problems with academic pressure, social pressure, racial bias, sexual problems, and drinking problems. The psychologists have checked each of these problems at least twice; of course, it may be the same person each time. The fact that these problems re-occur does not really mean,” said Terry.

The Senate reviewed the status of psychological counseling at Davidson, hearing Karl Goodhouse, Dr. W. Gatewood Workman, Dr. Meredith Hall, and Dr. Amelia Dockery at last Tuesday’s meeting. “We regard our primary function here as meeting the students who get unhappy, disturbed, anxious, or distressed. We are not primarily here for vocational guidance, or problems that are bothering the students. A student complaining about pressure may really just be saying that he is not satisfied with his lifestyle. He may have more deep-seated problems that don’t come out until after 3 or 4 hours of counseling,” said Terry.

The study of psychological counseling will reveal a number of other troubles with the present system of counseling. “The problem is much more complex than whether or not to hire someone for an extra day. We need a long and hard evaluation to see how much we need to change. Coupled with these concerns is how much we can afford. I would agree that we need to provide a full-time counselor—that is the equivalent of one counselor 5 times a week.”To help students decide on their major," Workman stated. Workman added that all three counselors at Davidson approach the matter from a different point. Dockery has been working at Davidson since last September, one day a week. She spoke about the situation in which she usually sees people. She said that people who came in to see her were in an unfair situation usually, and her job was to balance this out. Hall, who has spoken to the Senate before, stressed the point that he did not see himself as a therapist or a counselor; he tried to develop personal contact. In response to a question of whether present coverage is adequate, Workman stated, "If we had six psychologists they would be overworked, for the work will grow to fill the time available. I would like to see more available than there is now," he added. "I don’t think the time would be wasted, you have to draw a line, but I would say at Davidson the line is drawn too low," Hall responded. Dockery added, "I feel that I could spend more time if I had it." She maintained that even if the coverage increased, the population covered might not necessarily increase.

Senator Dana English presented a resolution supporting the college’s hiring of three different counselors for four afternoons a week. Senator Martin Eakes amended the resolution to ask the college to hire counselors for five afternoons a week. Eakes’ amendment also directed the Senate to return $2,000 College President Samuel R. Spencer Jr. offered them to provide for a fifth day of counseling. "Between the students and the college there will be a fifth day of counseling a week with a total cost to the program of $16,000," said Munce. According to Munce, the evaluation of psychological counseling must proceed in two ways: "We are working this spring first to find out what instruments; by instruments I mean information we need to get from the counselors themselves without violating the confidence their patients have for them, we need to evaluate the program. Secondly, we are getting advice and help from knowledgeable people outside the community. If we stayed inside the college we might get inside bias," said Munce.

The Senate has not voted on its recommendation to the college as to who to hire for the extra day. "I think it will be the recommendation of the Senate that there be 1 day a week of Dr. Workman, paid for by the college, 2 days for Mrs. Dockery, and 2 days for Dr. Hall. Counseling is a definite need within the Davidson community and it is a community responsibility. The Senate recognizes this and also that the college has a commitment of a significant nature to the community. The Senate doesn’t want to interfere with this commitment. We should give it back to the college, since this would simplify the contract. It is also not the role of the Senate. Our concern now is to get out of the contracting and give it back to them (the college)," Eakes stated. It was added that a fifth day of counseling would cost $5,000 under the original proposal. This would necessitate the Senate financing the remaining $2,000 through its own sources. The resolution was tabled waiting further consultation with Spencer. There were no Senators absent from the meeting.
