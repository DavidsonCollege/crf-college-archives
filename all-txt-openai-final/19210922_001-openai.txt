Brother Mark is Welcome Week-End Visitor on Hill

Anglican Monk Helps Students in Addresses and Conferences

The Y. M. C. A. considers itself indeed fortunate in having been able to secure such a man as Brother Mark to be with us for four days. Brother Mark, who is a student of the General Theological Seminary of New York, is a member of the Pastoral Order of the Holy Ghost, and is attached to the Christ Church of Chattanooga, Tenn. In order to become a member of this order an oath of poverty, chastity, and obedience must be taken. The wearing of a long gray robe, which is required of all members of the order to which he belongs, does not detract in the least from his personality or usefulness. His life, which seems to be burning with true consecration and love for Christ, furnishes an excellent example of the power of a spirit-filled life. His winning personality and his loyal devotion to Christ make him a powerful factor for good among all with whom he comes in contact.

His text Sunday morning was taken from Psalm 119:73, and the sermon was powerful and appealing. In addressing the Volunteer and Ministerial Bands the fact that unless we are doing personal work here, where circumstances are favorable, then we cannot expect to make successful ministers or missionaries, was forcefully brought out. We must make sure of our calling through prayer to God. The central theme of the address before the Y. M. C. A. was “full devotion to Christ.” Religion was defined as “a consuming devotion to the highest and best we know.” As Christian workers we cannot lead others to a higher plane than we ourselves have reached. The proof of our love for Christ is proven by our actions in striving to win others.

In addition to hearing Brother Mark speak, over fifty men have been benefited by having personal interviews with him. We feel that his efforts at Davidson have not been spent in vain, but that we have been blessed by his being with us. During his stay here he has proven to be “the friend of every one of us,” as Dwight Chalmers introduced him on Sunday night.

DR. BROWN, OF TRINITY, TO LECTURE HERE ON FOLKLORE

At 7:30 p.m., Monday, September 27th, in Shearer Hall, Prof. Frank Brown, Ph.D., head of the English Department of Trinity College, will give a popular lecture on North Carolina Folklore, Folk-song, and Ballad. Mrs. H. N. Pharr, of Charlotte, who is regarded as having one of the finest voices in the Carolinas, will sing some of the songs.

Professor Brown was the founder ten years ago of the North Carolina Folklore Society, and has been its secretary-treasurer from the beginning, as well as chairman of the committee that arranges the programs of its annual meetings. Professor Brown spent a large part of the past summer tramping through a number of our western counties in search of new material, and was rewarded by some rich “finds.” Personally, Professor Brown is a genial, cultured gentleman with a fine sense of humor, and has had large experience with students. All members of the college and citizens of the community are cordially invited to attend the lecture and give Professor Brown a hearty welcome on his first visit to Davidson.

The faculty committee on lectures and public functions has also arranged for an address by President Henry Louis Smith about the middle of October, who will tell us of his experience, observations, and impressions abroad this summer, where he was for nine days the guest of the British government.

Le Cercle Francais Hears Address by Ex-President

Last Year’s First Honor Man Spends Day on Campus Last Week

On Thursday afternoon of last week, C. K. Brown, who was president of Le Cercle Francais last year, visited his alma mater while en route to the University of Virginia, and made an interesting talk to members of the local chapter, in Dr. Lingle’s classroom. Professor Fleagle was present at special invitation. Phases of French manners and customs as observed by the speaker while in France during the past summer were interestingly presented. C. K. also gave the members an insight into French university methods and an account of his studies and trip. It is interesting to note that, while studying at a government university in Besancon, C. K. upheld his reputation.

Scrubs Show Up Well in Scrimmage with Varsity

First Team Wears Down Scrubs in Second Half: Teams Look Good

The Davidson “Wildcats” played their first game of the present season on last Friday. The first string Varsity men locked horns with the “All-American,” formerly playing under the title “Scrubs,” and a right royal battle ensued. During the first half these two teams battled to a scoreless tie. For the first few minutes the ball exchanged hands several times in mid-field. The largest contributions were by Schenck, who stepped off 10 yards around end, and Bethea, who pushed his way through tackle for 10 yards.

Near the end of the first quarter the Varsity got the ball on their own 45-yard line and started to drive down the field. The second quarter opened with the ball on the All-Americans’ five-yard line. After two unsuccessful attempts, Bethea carried the pigskin over only to be called back because his team was off-side. In three more tries the ball was again carried to the three-yard line, where a pass to Black was blocked by De Arnon. This gave the ball to the All-Americans on their own 20-yard mark, and neither goal line was seriously threatened thereafter.

In the second half the first string men awoke to the fact that it takes touchdowns to win games. As a result, this portion of play saw them step over their opponents’ last white line three times. The third quarter saw a new team on the field. The third team, commonly called the “Squirts,” were anxious to try their hand with the Varsity. Twice the oval came to rest behind the uprights in this period. The first team accomplished this once, assisted greatly by the breaks of the game. It was made when Long’s twisting spiral got away from Smith and Lake flopped on it behind the line. Marker number two was hung up by Bethea on straight running plays.

The final quarter saw the All-Americans back for another chance with many new faces in their line-up, and in that of the Varsity. In this period Hendrix broke loose on a wide end run and was never headed in his wild gallop until the ball kissed the dirt under the goal posts. His run was of about 35 yards and was the longest of the day. The afternoon’s play was marred by the many fumbles. The Varsity looked mighty sweet but there is still some polishing up to be done before they will

RHODES SCHOLARSHIPS OPEN FOR SOUTHERN COLLEGE MEN

Rhodes Scholars will be appointed by 32 states, including Tennessee, Virginia, Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, and Mississippi, December 3rd, to take up residence at Oxford University in October, 1922. All applications, testimonials, references, etc., must be in the hands of the respective state committees before October 20th. It is practically useless for undergraduates to apply for appointment. Young alumni under 25 years of age, who are doing graduate or professional study, or are engaged in teaching or are pursuing other intellectual pursuits, are the most likely candidates. Judging from past observation, we should say that an athletic record and gifts for social leadership, along with scholastic and literary attainments, are essential to appointment. The scholarships pay 350 pounds sterling annually and the appointment is for three years.Any line of study may be pursued with advantage. Any alumni identified with any of the above-named states who wish to apply should communicate at once with Prof. Thos. W. Lingle, who will aid them in any possible way.

Among the alumni who were on the Hill for the first few days of the term were Jim Boulware, ‘21, Johnny Jameson, ‘20, D. R. Freeman, ‘21, Birchie Romefelt, ‘21, and “Pee-Wee” Ratcliffe, ‘21.

Good Prospects for Next Two Y Meetings
Dr. Graham of Chapel Hill and Bellingrath and Hamilton Coming

Dr. Frank Graham, of the University of North Carolina, will speak to the Y. M. C. A. of the college on the relation of the student to his studies. Dr. Graham is a professor of history at Chapel Hill and has had great experience in college work. He is also one of the prominent Y. M. C. A. workers of the state and was conspicuous among the college professors at Blue Ridge.

The following Sunday two old Davidson men, George Bellingrath and E. H. Hamilton, will give an illustrated lecture on present-day conditions throughout the world. The Des Moines delegates will remember these slides as those shown on the opening night of the great Volunteer Convention.

Students and Townspeople Enjoy Chautauqua Program
Radcliffe Entertainers Bring Worthwhile Attractions Here

Davidson students and townspeople have again had the privilege of having a chautauqua in their midst with its program of helpful addresses and enjoyable music. The Radcliffe entertainers spent the first three days of the week here and good programs were presented.

Monday Afternoon
The program Monday afternoon was indicative of the superior class of entertainment furnished by the Radcliffe chautauqua. The prelude consisted of a varied musical program rendered by the Coleman Concert Company. This musical organization is composed of three artists: Mr. Coleman, director, flutist, and cornetist; Miss Vera Clayton, soloist; and Miss Alexa Whitmire, violinist and pianist. The numbers rendered consisted of classical, popular, and patriotic selections. The feature of the program was the lecture by Dr. J. William Terry, a well-known platform speaker. He chose as his subject “The Value of An Individual.” The address forcefully outlined the greatness of man as compared with the massive mountains, the boundless sea, and other wondrous creations of the Master Hand. Dr. Terry constantly reminded his hearers of man's endowments from the Creator and issued a strong appeal for wholehearted service to community, state, nation, self, and God.

The program Monday evening was extremely interesting and was attended by a large and enthusiastic crowd. The speaker of the evening was Dr. J. William Terry who delivered a very instructive and entertaining lecture on “Our Political Ideal.” In this lecture, he brought forth as our political ideal the superiority of the individual to any governmental institution, and that the greatest political enemy of the American government is the public indifference to it. The citizens of our country must love democracy or the long-sought-for political ideal will never be reached.

The feature of the evening’s program was the musical numbers presented by the Coleman Concert Company. “Will ’o-the-Wisp” and a selection from the light opera “Katinka” were beautifully rendered by Miss Clayton, contralto.

Mr. May, of the White Studios, of New York, is here making the pictures, and judging from his excellent work of last year, everyone will be given justice—and in many cases more than justice. Editor Shaw and Manager Knox are making an early start on the Annual this year, and as an early start means a slicker book, here’s hoping we will be proud of the 1922 issue of Quips and Cranks with their smiling countenances.
