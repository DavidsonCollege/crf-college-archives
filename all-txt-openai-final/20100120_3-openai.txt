Renowned philanthropist Doris Buffett visits campus

Last Tuesday afternoon, nationally recognized philanthropist Doris Buffett visited Davidson to speak about her charity, the Sunshine Lady Foundation.

Born in 1928 in Omaha, NE, Doris Buffett calls herself a child of the depression; and it is growing up in the depression to which she attributes her passion for philanthropy, noting specific instances when she found herself wishing to help the people around her.

Buffett recollected scenes of the homeless in Washington, DC and a Save the Children correspondence that sparked her desire to give. Years later, in 1996, Buffett founded the Sunshine Lady Foundation with her inherited trust fund to do just that: help those in need.

“We look for people in distress through no [cause] of their own,” she said.

Since its inception, Buffett’s foundation has donated over $80 million to causes such as battered women’s shelters, those people with illnesses unable to afford medical care, educational resources for battered women, their children and those in jail.

“We do not give hand-outs, we give hand-ups,” she said. “We have to have collaboration.”

Buffett’s policy of collaboration is evident in every aspect of her foundation, beginning with the very first request for a grant. After receiving a request for help, Buffett said that her foundation’s team ensures the need is valid and pressing.

“There are so many lovely people with poignant needs that we can help,” she said. [The need is] just stark—it comes at you and you think, ‘That could happen to anybody.’”

When it comes to awarding money to individual situations, Buffett talked of the “no nonsense” approach she is known for.

“We gauge what we give on the need,” she said, noting that amounts can range from $20,000 to $30 million. “These are not deadbeats, these are people with bad luck.”

Over the years, Buffett’s foundation created the PEACE awards to recognize professionals working with domestic violence victims as well as the Women’s Independence Scholarship Program (WISP) for the education of victims of domestic violence, which has since graduated over 1,000 women. Additionally, the Change Your World (CYW) scholarship was started for children victims of domestic violence and provides them with the basic education needed to succeed.

“Education is never a chance,” she said. “It always works.”

Buffett noted that though the students going through programs like WISP and CYW may need extra mentoring, resources or attention, the chance for them to get an education is often not a “second chance,” but a first.

The payoff, according to Buffett, comes not with material gains or recognition, but with statistics such as the 40-plus percent of students in WISP who maintain a GPA of 3.5 or higher or the children in CYW who aspire to be doctors and lawyers.

“It doesn’t take much, and the rewards are enormous,” she said. “I love things that make a definite difference in the life of someone else.”

In 2003, Buffett teamed with Davidson and Ken Menkhaus’ “Philanthropy and the Non-Profit Sector” class to give students a hands-on “learning by giving” experience, donating $10,000 for the Political Science class to distribute to a non-profit of their choice, after soliciting grant applications from numerous organizations.

“The students argue a lot about how to spend the money and that’s a good sign,” she said. “I was really thrilled with the spirit on this campus.”

In addition to her donation to the Davidson course, and others like it nation-wide, Buffett has created “Sunbeams,” or volunteers who use her grants to make a difference in their communities.

“[She is] one of nation’s greatest philanthropists—one of nation’s most unique philanthropists,” President Tom Ross said of Buffett. “Her passion[s]...really do not end with grant-making.”

Despite donating to mainly domestic projects, Buffett found three particular projects abroad that caught her attention and warranted her grants: building a primary school in Mexico, a pediatric cardiac hospital in Guatemala and a burn treatment center in Afghanistan.

“My aim is to have everybody win,” she said. “We do what we have to do, and sometimes it isn’t very much. We judge it on a case-by-case basis.”

“They’re invisible people,” Buffett said of the 10,000 letters processed from needy individuals over a three-year period. “No one knows that they’re alive, or what they’re going through. Each one of them is an individual.”
