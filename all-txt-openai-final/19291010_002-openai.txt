JUDGE OF COURT PLEASED WITH ACTIONS OF FROSH
New Rules Added to the Former Regulations

Heath Whittle, Judge of the Court of Control, is highly satisfied with the splendid response the Freshmen have given to
the Frosh rules, one of Davidson’s most honored traditions, and intimates that very few infractions have been reported. However, freshmen
must not regard this commendation with a general relaxation, but must continue their strict adherence to the regulations until the
latter part of the college year, Whittle warned.

“Wonderful spirit exhibited by the Freshmen thus far this year,” Whittle continued, “has attracted the favorable approbation of the whole
student body. The call for putting up bleachers immediately disclosed almost a unanimous response. The presence of most every freshman
at the weekly pep meetings has assured the cheerleaders of a successful evening. Turning out to all athletic contests as
well as responding to coaches’ invitations to become candidates for the various freshman teams has been especially noticeable.

“In view of the fact that very few upperclassmen have brought complaints, and in consideration of the present conduct of
the freshman class, there is a possibility that the rules will be removed in the spring, providing that the Court
of Control sees fit. Of course, this plan will not materialize unless the good behavior remains consistent.

“An important fact has been brought to the attention of the Court of Control. It is very noticeable that the
congested conditions in the Post Office just after breakfast are very troublesome, both to the post office clerks as well
as to the student body. As a remedial measure, the Court is requesting that all freshmen refrain from going after
their mail until their first available vacant period after breakfast. This will relieve the crowded condition considerably, and, therefore, it
will be best for freshmen to comply with this new order at once.” Whittle concluded.

Freshman rules this year are the same as those of last with the exception of the following changes:
(1) All freshmen must attend athletic contests fifteen minutes early.
(2) All freshmen are required to attend pep meetings.

LANGUAGE APTITUDE EXAMINATIONS GIVEN

The Language Department this year has given an intelligence test to Freshmen, known as the “Iowa Placement Examination for Aptitude
in Foreign Languages.” The plan at the present time is to place the results on file and check them with
the class grades of the student at the end of the first semester and again at the end of the
year. If, after a comparison has been made, there is to be noted any marked correlation in the records of
the test and class averages of the students, a similar examination will be given at the beginning of the course
next fall and section assignments will then be made on the basis of results obtained. This test has been used
very successfully for sectioning students by a large number of colleges and seems to be giving very good results.

Of course, the marks made carry no weight in class grades but are merely for information. Although all papers have
been graded, no information will be given out at this time as to the results other than to say that
they compare favorably with those of other schools. The highest possible mark is 150. No knowledge of a foreign language
is necessary to pass the test.

KITTENS TIE OAK RIDGE IN FIRST GAME OF YEAR
Cavan Recovers Fumble to Score Freshman Marker

The Davidson Wildkittens opened the '29 season by fighting the Oak Ridge Cadets to a 6-6 tie on Friday, October
4. The score indicates that the game was hard-fought from beginning to end.

In the first quarter, Oak Ridge received the ball and made a first down on two plays. After failing to
gain in two tries, Gold punted to the Davidson 30-yard line. A series of line plays and passes put the
ball on the Oak Ridge 22-yard line where it was lost on downs. During the remainder of the period, the
teams exchanged punts and the quarter ended with the ball in possession of Oak Ridge on their own 27-yard line.

In the second quarter, after two exchanges of punts on which Gold, for Oak Ridge, gained considerable advantage over Mills
and Pearce, Gold ran back a Davidson punt 15 yards to the Davidson 35-yard line. A succession of line plays
carried the ball to the Davidson one-foot line. Captain Tyson plunged over center for the touchdown. The try for extra
point failed. The Kitten scored when...Cavan recovered a fumble which had not been grounded, and ran 52 yards for Davidson’s
lone touchdown. The try for extra point failed. Neither team was able to score in the last quarter, both doing
well on the defense. Pearce made a beautiful run of 38 yards to place the ball on the Oak Ridge
4-yard line. After three attempts without gains, Mills tried to dropkick, but was unsuccessful and the game ended with the
ball in Davidson's possession on the Cadets’ 30-yard line. Cavan and Pearce were outstanding in the backfield while Gardner was
a tower of strength in the line. For the Cadets, Walton, Gold, and Captain Tyson starred in the backfield, the
whole line showing up well. Oak Ridge made seven first downs to Davidson’s six. Following is the lineup and summary:

EIGHT DAVIDSON MEN (Continued from page 1)
Woodberry Forest in Virginia; and J. A. Thompson, who is now studying for his Ph.D. degree at the University of
North Carolina. Mr. Thompson did graduate work at the University for a year after graduation, and for two years was
assistant professor at Wake Forest College. Nominations from the other states were Camper O’Neal, of Montgomery, Ala., now starting his
second year as Y. M. C. A. secretary at Davidson College; Frontis W. Johnson, of Jefferson, Ga., senior and well-known
athlete at Davidson; W. W. Harrison, Jr., and John B. Knox, of Liberty, S. C., both seniors, and Alan M.
Frew, of Charleston, W. Va., a senior, who won third place in the National Oratorical contest a year ago in
California, after winning first place in southern competition.

Davidson has had five Rhodes scholars since 1907. They were Dr. Ben R. Lacy, president of the Union Theological Seminary,
Richmond, Va.; W. P. Mills, now a Y. M. C. A. worker in China; Prof. S. T. McCloy, at present
a member of the faculty at Duke University; Rev. McDowell Richards, pastor at Clarksville, Ga., and Rev. R. F. Davidson,
now a student of the graduate school at Princeton University. There is no written examination for the Rhodes scholarship, selection
being made upon the basis of the candidate's excellence in scholarship, together with his student activities, character, personality, and probable
leadership. Every college or university in each state generally enters candidates, which means that 15 or 20 of the best
minds of a state come before the board. Only one can receive the award. The Rhodes scholarship, tenable for two
and usually three years at Oxford, carries an annual stipend of approximately $2,000.00.

STUDENTS, ATTENTION!
For self-supporting students desiring fascinating, remunerative work either temporary or permanent, may I suggest that many students of both sexes
have earned scholarships and cash sufficient to defray all college expenses, representing national magazine publishers. If interested, write or wire

Turn the light on the Truth! It’s just naturally good tobacco—not “artificial treatment” that makes OLD GOLD gentle to the
throat and better to the taste. No one cigarette-maker has any monopoly on the heat-treatment of cigarette tobaccos. For heat-treating
is neither new nor exclusive. It has been used for years by practically all cigarette-makers to “set” and sterilize their
tobacco. But OLD GOLD’S goodness does not depend on artificial treatment. It is the product of naturally good tobaccos... carefully
selected for mildness, smoothness, and flavor. Tobaccos made free of “throat scratch” by Mother Nature herself. Try a package. You’ll
immediately get the thrill of this smoother and better cigarette. And you’ll know then why OLD GOLD’S sales are ALREADY
THREE TIMES GREATER than the combined growth of three leading cigarette brands during a like period of their existence.
