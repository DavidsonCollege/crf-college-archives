**Careers Office Initiates New Programs**

The Careers Office has initiated two new programs to give students the opportunity for discussions with career professionals.

**Town Considers Noise Ordinance**

North Main Street residents will present the town board with a petition requesting a town noise ordinance at the next town board meeting. The meeting will be next Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. at the Commons from 12:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m. The program will feature a different career field each week. The program will begin next Tuesday. A representative from A. L. Williams & Associates, a financial management company offering internships, will be the guest speaker.

The petition was prompted by the Sig Ep-sponsored Chairmen of the Board concert on 17 September at 609 N. Main St. Major MacCormac said any ordinance will be made “in conjunction with the college.”

The lunches and discussions will be held on one of the Commons’ balconies. Students are welcome to drop by any time during the two-hour period. Students may make requests for specific career representatives at the Careers Office. The Careers Office will sponsor Charlotte Career Seminars five times during the year. The first seminar, one on Finance, will be on Friday, 30 October. Other seminars will include programs on Human Services, Communications, Medicine, Law, and Management.

Students wishing to register for the Finance seminar should do so at the Careers Office before October 16. The program is designed for a maximum of 30 students and a minimum of 12. There is no fee for participation.

**Advisory Committee Appointments Made**

The SGA has recommended that the following people be named to the following advisory committees: Alumni Committee - sophomore Hunter Monroe; Artist Series Committee - sophomore Julie Cheek and junior Sara Wheeler; Book Store Committee - sophomore Jeff Mann; Inter-collegiate Committee - junior Mike Frankhouser; International Education - senior Sarah Roberts and senior Alice Musik; Physical Education Committee - junior Jeff Nielson and junior Tom Schember; Public Lectures Committee - junior Sara Wheeler.

**Sex Controversy on Florida Campuses**

Florida College students are fighting a new state law prohibiting student groups from “advocating or recommending” any sort of sex outside marriage.

The law, the Trask-Bush Amendment, prohibits giving state aid to student groups fitting this description. The law particularly affects gay student groups on Florida campuses.

Student governments at the University of South Florida, Florida State, and the University of Florida have adopted resolutions “advocating and recommending sexual relations between persons not married to each other.” This is an attempt to make legislators either pare the law or shut down all the public colleges in the state.

**Drug Paraphernalia**

State legislatures should outlaw it if they really want to stop drug use. Most of the U.S. wind up here. It is particularly difficult for smugglers to get it into the body. Used by brain: most of the nose. Marijuana smokers often use innocent-looking lips to clear the evidence.

**Gastric Connection**

The main conduit of the esophagus into the stomach.
