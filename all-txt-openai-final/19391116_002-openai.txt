Associate Editoris timely because it is about war, and it is a sort of sequel to “Confessions of a Nazi Spy” — only better. Joel McCrea plays the part of a promising young diplomat who has been trained in foreign diplomatic service. On the eve of his returning to Washington, he marries a mysterious, beautiful young girl, who, through no fault of her own, has been in the espionage service of a foreign country. When Joel learns the truth about her, he resigns his government job, and the two of them dedicate their lives to rounding up the big shots of the spy system, only to return to Washington as heroes. Don't miss it if you are not Duke-Carolina-ing. Mon. & Tues., Nov. 19-20.

“ETERNALLY YOURS” — Loretta Young, David Niven, Hugh Herbert, Billie Burke, C. Aubrey Smith, and Broderick Crawford. Too bad all these good pictures have to come right during a review period, but they're all good. You'll like this story in which Loretta Young marries a master magician, David Niven, and becomes an associate with him in a magic act. However, his dangerous parachute jump, combined with his femme fans, who are too fond of him, force Loretta to do a disappearing act that really is a dilly. She divorces David and marries a former love, Broderick Crawford. But David’s love for her is too great to let her go, and you may be able to imagine what the final outcome is.

Wednesday, Nov. 21 “HOTELS FOR WOMEN” — Elsa Maxwell, Linda Darnell, Ann Sothern, James Ellison. Here you will find shades of “Stage Door;” you will see a lot of models and chorus girls living in a hostelry, presided over by Elsa Maxwell and follow them in their troubles. Ann Sothern is very good, indeed, and Linda Darnell is one of the bright young starlets of today’s screen. James Ellison furnishes the romantic lead.

When the dust of the battle had cleared away, some of Davidson's luminaries were seen in and around the Winston Smoke House. Among those swinging were Jasper, Hector, and Bosco — only a few of the end with Bahnson. Even Bill Bolin and his contingent held sway at the ball. And roaming the streets of the Twin City could be seen every now and then Propst and Phillips and scattered groups of the Salem dance dandies resplendent in white and black. Even though Barker may deny it, we have it straight that the sole reason he remained on campus this weekend was that Mona was in Chapel Hill with Locke again. Too bad, old man. And another flame that has been completely put out came to our attention with the marriage announcement of Ralph Williams’ last year’s Mid-Winters date. And he was looking forward to another swell set with her this year. And Pan Hellenic boys are sparing no efforts in their attempt to get one of the top-notch “name” bands for the Feb set. No announcement forthcoming as yet, but he is going to be good. Whiskey Bob seemed to like Jones’ advertising and the report has it that he has already purchased the red tux coat from Roland. We wonder if it will be as becoming to Bob? Add echoes from Homecoming — Ken McIntyre’s blonde date turned out to be a Pi Kappa Phi sweetheart before the weekend was over. Hendrick established himself as the official Pi Kap snake and got in plenty of extra duty. But the most recent snaking occurred over the weekend when a few of Abel’s weekend guests took over their host's date several hours before and after the affairs of the evening were over. Also among those snaked on was Rufus Allison — while he waited fruitlessly in Charlotte for his dance date at eight, she was only too prominent in High Point with Roger Rice. Some comp, eh? Billy Tarleton deserted Winston and the game for Montreat and Asheville. At present, rates among the campus powerhouses — met a girl for the first time and broke up a 3-year standing date affair. It drifts back to me that she wouldn't even speak to the “old flame” after she met Billy. Jack Abernathy must be serious in his rekindling activities — just “dropped” by W. C. over the weekend and “happened” to see Sarah Ramsceur. Oh, yeah! Fred Harbin was mighty happy when he learned that he had been ribbed and that his Queens’ babe hadn't really gone back West with an old “friend.” We can’t blame him for being happy — would sure leave a lot of time on his hands. He has been spending quite a profitable time in the Queen City. What about the telegram Dick Hudson received from his family wanting to know if he was really married? Have you been holding out on us, Dick? Speaking of marriages — when are the Otts-Butts nuptials coming off? Mac was up Lynchburg way again this week. Rumor has it that Bob Powell is attempting to keep the news of his coming marriage Dec. 9th to a wealthy Boston beauty away from his family. Wish you luck, Bob. By the way, Powell, is she the same one you talked twelve minutes to over the phone Sunday night? While making the rounds with McDaniel and Bogo over the weekend, Rufus Powell's charm had a little miss chasing him everywhere. You should have given her a break, Rufe. It isn’t every day she meets a “big bad man from the West.” Also among those seemingly eternally locked are Billy Masters and Julia Hobbs. She was looking just as lovely as ever in Winston Saturday night. And as a parting shot — George Matthews’ friends want to know why he goes around with a dreamy expression singing, “Oh, my darling, you can’t love two.” Or is it a worried expression?

Minute By FRANK BARKER

Social Security ... one part of the Social Security Act passed by Congress has probably been unnoticed by most of us. This has to do with the taxing of boys waiting on tables in fraternity houses. In its original form, the Social Security Act created an inequity among college students working for their board and room. If a student were employed in a college dining hall or in a college dormitory, he was exempted from the tax, while if he waited upon a table or performed janitorial service in a fraternity house, he and the employing fraternity had to turn over 1 percent each of the salary to Uncle Sam. This new measure will go into effect on Jan. 1, 1940. Sponsored by the National Interfraternity Conference, a bill to remedy the situation was introduced into Congress by Rep. Buck of California. The whole successful effort was a demonstration of the effectiveness of fraternities standing together robustly in a worthy cause. The committee was so impressed with the justice of the proposal it (the Ways and Means Committee) wrote the exemption into its code of amendments of the act.

FRATERNITIES — Sigma Alpha Epsilon, in point of number of chapters, is the largest fraternity. The SAE’s have 112 undergraduate units. Next in rank come the Kappa Sigs with 107; Phi Delta Theta, 106; Sigma Chi, 98; Sigma Nu, 96; Alpha Tau Omega, 94; Beta Theta Pi, 89; Pi Kappa Alpha, 78; Phi Gamma Delta, 73; Sigma Phi Epsilon, 72; Kappa Alpha (S), 67; and Pi Kappa Phi, 32. It is interesting to note that Beta Theta Pi held its centenary this year. Held at Oxford, Ohio, the seat of Miami University, founding place of the fraternity, the convention brought a thousand sons of Wooglin to the shrine. A peal of memorial bells was presented to the University and is hung in “Old Main,” where Beta Theta Pi was founded in 1839. And incidentally, their chapter here founded in 1859 was the first national fraternity on the Davidson campus.

A THUMBNAIL SKETCH ... One of the “Bumpus” brothers ... jolly, teasingly plump, holds an open house every afternoon from 3 to 5 on the first floor Georgia, and also wears both Phi Beta Kappa and O.D.K. keys. Lover of “jumpin’ jive” and “Frisco Flo;” can be seen with a large portfolio under his arms these days when not leading the Georgia “hep-cats” in their nightly sessions. Synonymously related to “Dr. Romance.”
