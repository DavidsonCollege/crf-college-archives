THE DAVIDSONIAN

THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 1990 15

The Davidson College Union, Athletic Department, and Vail Commons Introduce
a Royal Lichtenstein Quarter Ring Sidewalk Circus

Fire-eating ringmaster, Nick Weber, takes time out for a hot lunch during the
all-new 1990-'91 edition of the ROYAL LICHTENSTEIN CIRCUS.

Corrections

The article by Sara Carlson entitled "Think Before You Vote" stated that Eric Bone
'91 would not vote for Jesse Helms. Bone is not a North Carolina citizen.

The Davidsonian apologizes (as does the Dean of Students office) for omitting the name of Suresh Acharya as a winner of the Goodwin-Exxon award. The paper regrets this error.
