Dr. Whaling Delivers Lecture On “The Making Of Woodrow Wilson”
Interesting Address on the Characteristics and Forces that Have Made the Former Davidson Student a World Leader.

One of the most enjoyable events of the college year at Davidson, for the students and townspeople as well, was the lecture delivered by Dr. Thornton Whaling, president of Columbia Theological Seminary, on Monday morning. The subject of the address was “The Making of Woodrow Wilson.” Dr. Whaling was a college fellow of our President at Davidson College, and since that time has been an intimate acquaintance of him; consequently, he was better able to make the life history more vivid.

He began by showing the supremeness of the making of a character and by naming the four great forces which act in the formation thereof. Then in a most picturesque manner, he applied the life of this singular world character to these forces. In his discussion and application of the first of these, Heredity, the speaker traced Wilson's ancestry, which was exclusively Scotch-Irish. He expressed it as the cream of Scotland which had been skimmed off of that country and placed in northern Ireland, all of whom were highly cultured and very learned. Many were political and religious leaders of the two countries. In fact, Dr. Whaling says that “the Scotch were a political and religious people, and the Wilson and Woodrow lines were merged—not sprinkled—in this profound doctrine, for four centuries at least.

In the second place, a most interesting and entertaining account of the Education was given. The first and greatest of Woodrow Wilson's teachers was his own father. Very touching was the account of a visit to Columbia Seminary by the President only a few years ago. He went to his father’s classroom where as a small boy he had gone to listen to the great truths which his boyish mind delighted to think upon. Then to the chapel room where he recalled to mind the great orators of former days, chief among whom was his own father. On this same visit, Dr. Whaling said that he asked the President if he remembered his college days at Davidson, and he replied that “The year at Davidson College was the happiest of all his college career.” This introduced a brief account of those days here and were of special interest, of course, to the audience. A very vivid picture was painted of a baseball game between the scrub nine and a delegation from some countryside, when in the ninth inning with the country lads in the lead, Wilson, who had reached third base and might have brought in the winning run, came tottering in home very nonchalantly to be put out and get a very impressive tongue-lashing from the captain of the scrub team.

Then came his days as a student of Princeton, which as Dr. Whaling expressed it, is Davidson enlarged. Here he was further trained under the influence of the old Scotch environment.

Wildcats Take Second from Elon 2 to 1
Doubles Championship
Hall and Spence To Be Organized To Make Davidson Bigger, Better
Cunningham Brothers Their Opponents In Finals. Good Form Displayed.

W. F. Hall and T. H. Spence are the Davidson champions inTennis doubles and compose a team of which we may well feel proud. Our only regret is that this team is not entered in some inter-collegiate match this Spring. Hall won his “D" this year as singles champion, and Spence has a splendid chance to win his letter next year. Seven teams were represented in the doubles tournament last week. These teams were arranged in two groups for the preliminaries and semi-finals. In the preliminaries of the first group, Cunningham and Cunningham defeated Ormand and Ormand 6-4, 6-2, and McKeldin and Miller defeated Kornegay and Wilkinson 6-3, 6-3. In the second group, Hall and Spence defeated Woods and Price 6-3, 6-3. (Continued on Page 7)

Davidson? Sure you do, every true son of Davidson does. The question is, what are you doing to make it a better and a greater Davidson? “Not much,” you will answer probably. Now, here is the point: separately and working alone you cannot do much, but if you had three hundred others working with you — it would help a whole lot, wouldn't it? Why, sure it would. Every college or university is now planning a progressive, active program, now that the war is over, and you may be sure Davidson is not behind the times. The University of North Carolina, Washington and Lee University, and the University of Virginia are a few of them that have organized for real work. They are organized to boost their school and to make it bigger and greater. Do you believe in a bigger, better Davidson? (Continued on Page 7)

In the final game of the season on Sprunt Field, Davidson lost to Elon by a score of 3 to 1. The game was probably one of the finest exhibitions of a pitchers’ battle ever seen on our own field. Sides for Elon allowed the Wildcats only two hits and struck out 7 men, while Clarke for Davidson struck out seventeen men and allowed five hits. Three of the five hits on Clarke were bunched in the second inning. Elon played a much superior fielding game to the Wildcats, handling all chances well. Davidson's lone tally came in the first inning. Murray reached first on a passed ball. Ratchford was out, short to first, Murray taking third on the play. Johnson doubled to left field, scoring Murray. After this, Sides, the Elon twirler, had the Davidson batsmen completely at his mercy. When two men were out in the seventh, Cassel placed a beautiful hit in left field which was good for three bases. Elon's three runs all came in the second inning. King walked. Marlette singled to right field, King taking third on the play. Johnson hit Marlette who was stealing second and Marlette was safe at second, King scoring on the play. Brown doubled to center, scoring Marlette. Sides was safe at first on a slow throw by Boswell. Atkinson singled to right, scoring Brown for the final tally. After this inning, the Elon batsmen were retired in one, two, three order. The day was an ideal one for baseball and the game was full of “pep” and interest through the nine snappy innings. The feature of the game, outside of the pitchers’ duel, were the fielding of Johnson and hitting of Marlette for Elon, and the hitting of Johnson and Cassell for Davidson.

Score by innings:

First Inning:
Elon—Allen fanned. Murphy walked. Simpson fanned. Murphy stole second and went to third on a wild pitch. Johnson flew out to Cassel.
Davidson—Spann fanned. Murray reached first on a passed ball. Ratchford went out short to first, Murray taking third on the play. Johnson doubled to left, scoring Murray. Richards fanned, leaving Johnson on second. Score of inning: Elon, 0; Davidson, 1.

Second Inning:
Elon—King walked. Marlette singled to right field, King taking third on the play on a throw to second. Johnson hit Marlette who was safe at second, King scoring. Brown doubled to center, Marlette scoring. Sides hit to Boswell, who threw late to first. Atkinson singled to right, Brown scoring. Allen fanned. Murphy fanned. Simpson hit a pop fly to Ratchford for the third out.
Davidson—Clark fanned. Cassell flew out to right field. Miley flew out to second. (Continued on Page 7)
