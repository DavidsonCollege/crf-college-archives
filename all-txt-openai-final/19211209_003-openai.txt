ACADEMY MANAGER AND CAPTAIN FOR 1922 ELEVEN ARE ELECTED

On last Thursday morning at a meeting of the student body, the two assistant football managers for this year, R. F. Davidson and H. H. Smith, were voted on as is customary for the manager of next year’s team. The election resulted in the favor of H. H. Smith, who will be the manager of the next Wildcat eleven.

A meeting of the football letter men, held after chapel Saturday, resulted in the election of J. S. (Spratt) Moore, one of the best halfbacks that Davidson has ever had, as the pilot for the Wildcat eleven of 1922. Spratt has won all-state honors this year and well deserves this added honor conferred upon him by his teammates.

Y. M.C. A. ARRANGES FOR EMPLOYMENT FOR STUDENTS

One of the best agencies by which students on the campus may obtain work is being planned by the community department of the Y. M.C. A. P. D. Miller, who is chairman of the department, has already sent circulars around, showing the kind of work which can be done by the students. Some of the jobs are: yard-cleaning, wood-chopping, carpenter repairing, odd plumbing jobs, varnishing and painting, window repairing, carpet-cleaning, typewriting, sign painting, firing furnaces, milking, electrical repairing, etc. Quite a number of petitions for workers have already come to the department.

It is being planned to make this new branch of the work a permanent employment bureau through which students who wish may obtain odd jobs throughout the year. “P. D.” also plans to publish all the open jobs. If a student sees a job he desires, he can make the necessary arrangements to obtain it through the department.

NEW SOCIETY COMPOSED OF PHI MEMBERS BEGINS WORK

The new literary society, the daughter of the old Phi Society, held its first regular meeting last Thursday night in the Phi Hall after the other society had adjourned. L. A. Taylor, as provisional president, called the society to order. After the devotional exercises by Burney, the society elected W. M. McLeod, retiring president of the Phi Society, as president. He was at once inaugurated. His inaugural address was necessarily extemporaneous, but in it he spoke of the hopeful fighting spirit of Davidson that would overcome all obstacles.

The society then went into the election of the other officers for this term. They are as follows: R. P. Brown, vice-president; W. Z. Bradford, secretary; L. B. Burney, treasurer; L. A. Taylor, first critic; W. D. Kimzey, second critic; E. C. Douglas and G. M. Morrow, supervisors.

Thursday night at 9 o’clock was chosen as the time for meeting, and the society will, for the present, be permitted to use the Phi Hall. All students, both old and new, who are interested in literary society work and want to help to make the new organization a complete success are cordially invited to submit their names to either W. M. McLeod or any other member of this society.

PHI SOCIETY ELECTS ITS OFFICERS FOR NEXT TERM

The installation of new officers marked the regular meeting of the Phi Society Thursday night. The scheduled program was dispensed with and the newly elected officers took their posts. J. H. McKeithen was installed as president to succeed W. M. McLeod who joined the new society. The other new officers were J. W. Baldwin, vice-president; J. Lee McLean, secretary; J. I. Stand.

PROFESSOR AND MRS. ERWIN ENTERTAIN EAS FRIDAY

PRESCRIPTIONS COMPOUNDED BY REGISTERED PHARMACISTS

Prof. and Mrs. E. J. Erwin entertained the Dramatic and Glee Clubs with a delightful reception at their home, Friday evening, November 2nd. After the talk, Mr. Ratto recited Gunga Din, by Kipling, in a remarkably telling manner. After refreshments were served, J. R. Earnest recited “A Possum” which he had recently given in the minstrel.

Mr. Ratto, of the Redpath Lyceum Bureau, was present and gave an interesting talk on the drama, developing the various methods of portraying character. One must study and live a character in order to reproduce it correctly.

At a meeting of the student body, the election of next year’s captain was held, resulting in the election of J. S. (Spratt) Moore, one of the best halfbacks Davidson has had, to pilot the Wildcats for 1922. Spratt won all-state honors this year and well deserves the added honor conferred upon him by his teammates. The two assistant managers, R. F. Davidson and H. H. Smith, were, as is customary, nominated for next year’s manager. The election resulted in favor of H. H. Smith, who will be the manager of next year's Wildcats.
