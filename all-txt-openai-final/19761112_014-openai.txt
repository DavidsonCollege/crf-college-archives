Hockey

The women’s field hockey team traveled to East Carolina University this weekend where they participated in the Deep South Tournament.
The purpose of the tournament is to pick individuals from college teams to comprise a regional team.

Here players are watched as they compete with their teams during three games on Friday and Saturday. The finalists then
compete in regulated play on Sunday. From this session, players are chosen to make up three levels for the regional
team. The top regional team will play others from around the country until individuals are picked for the National Team.

The Davidson team had three representatives chosen as finalists: captain Kirk Cameron, goalie Cindy Curtis, and forward Belle Erdman.

After Sunday’s competition, Kirk Cameron was picked as fullback for the second-level regional team. Coach Susan Roberts was selected to
coach that team.

The women played Wake Forest in the first game of the tournament. Although it was a slow game, the women
showed good style and came away with an expected win, 3-0.

Belle Erdman and Martha MacGill each scored once, and the final goal was made by an error on the part
of the opposing fullback.

The second team the women competed against was Pfeiffer, with a Davidson upset of 3-1. Roberts commented on the game
saying, “It was a very tough game in which both Beth Tanner and Mary Grey Gilchrist were injured. But, it
was definitely our best game of the season with everyone working smoothly and aggressively to contribute to the win.”

The last game played on Saturday was against East Carolina, with Davidson losing 0-1. Some discrepancy arose concerning the score,
which was made by an illegal move on the part of the East Carolina forward.

Cameron lodged a complaint claiming an obstruction on the forward, but the officials had not seen the score and so
could not invalidate it.

Several other factors also contributed to the loss. Although the Davidson team had many shots on goal, they could not
get past a very effective East Carolina goalie. Also, the injuries sustained earlier in the day during the game against
Pfeiffer slowed down the women.

Overall, it was a successful tournament and Roberts had these comments to make: “I think we have improved 100 percent
during this season. We ended up surprising most of our competition with such an effective new team. I am looking
forward to working with the team next fall to improve our record even more.”

Roberts and Cameron will travel to Converse College next weekend to participate with the Deep South team #2 against their
Southeastern counterparts. The first match will be held on Friday at 2 o'clock.
