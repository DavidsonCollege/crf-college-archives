THE DAVIDSONIAN, APRIL 16, 1925

Wildcats to Meet Jacket Golf Team

The Davidson golf team will meet Georgia Tech in a match today at the Charlotte Country Club. The teams will
consist of five men each. Eighteen holes will be played in the morning and eighteen in the afternoon. The Tech
team has several stars on it and the Wildcats will have to fight hard to defeat them. The Davidson team
will consist of Reeves, Milhous, Jones, Trotter, and Malloy. There is a possibility that Malloy will be unable to play
as the track team meets South Carolina in Columbia the same date and Malloy is a member of both teams.
If he is unable to play the teams will probably only consist of four men. The Tech team has two
strong men in Rip Farnsworth and Bill Spalding, who have proven their ability many times over. Watts Gunn, ex-Georgia state
champion, is also on the team and should prove a hard man for anyone. There is a chance that Johnny
Bachman, who attended Davidson last fall, will also play against the Wildcats.

DAVIDSON NINE TO PLAY IN GREENSBORO TODAY

The Wildcat baseball nine traveled to Greensboro this morning to encounter the Duke University team this afternoon. This is the
first game between the two teams this season and will be hotly contested as are all the athletic contests between
these two institutions. The State nine, which beat Davidson only a few days ago, also defeated Duke by a closer
margin than the Davidson-State game. Wake Forest has also defeated the Wildcats and Duke. The Duke nine beat Elon in
their only victory, while Davidson has been unable to scratch on the winning side of the score book. The Wildcats
will fight hard to score their first win of the season and Duke will put up a strong showing to
keep the baseball team from being the third aggregation representing Davidson to defeat Duke this year. The team made the
trip this morning in a large safety bus. Approximately 14 players, Coach Monk, and Manager Briggs made the trip. They
will return tonight after the game.

DAV. FRESH AB R H PO A E

Fresh Nine Tromped by Rockingham and Split Two-Game Series With Raeford

Rockingham High School defeated the Davidson Freshman baseball team in their second contest of the season, 11 to 6. The
Rockingham High lads began in the first inning with their attack, garnering two runs in the first frame, and repeating
that performance for five innings, adding an extra one in the eighth. The Davidson Fresh became stronger toward the last,
checking up four tallies in the last two innings, their first ones coming in the first and second innings. Davidson
Fresh used three pitchers against the sluggers from Rockingham—Leight, beginning, with T. Cathey and C. Cathey following. C. Cathey seemed
most effective, allowing only one hit in three innings, the High School boys gaining 13 off the other two twirlers.
While Gibson was touched for 7 bingles, he kept them rather scattered, and the Wildkittens failed to use the willow
at the crucial moments. Both teams vied with honors when it came to errors, the visitors making 6, and the
Yearlings 8. The score follows:

JUNIOR SPEAKING

(Continued from page 1)

As one looked at his youthful countenance and listened to the strains of, “When you and I were Seventeen.” After
this spasm Fred Smith acted a jazzistic Blues solo called, “Hot Tamale Molly.” Frank Hudson sang “Show me the Way,”
and Piggy Martin, assisted by the entire chorus, sang, “Oh Mabel.” Interspersed with these songs were numerous jokes by the
end men, who kept up a running fire of original humor constantly. The black boys were Smith, Murchison, Branch, and
Laird. All were well qualified for the position. Branch acted natural, had the biggest laugh in the crowd and made
everybody think it the truth. Other members of the minstrels were: D. G. Wilson, Chairman; E. K. Regen, T. S.
Lawson, M. C. Davis, J. W. Anderson, J. M. Appleby, G. M. Eddington. Mrs. J. P. Williams was in charge
of the decorations.DAV. FRESH. ABR HPOA
Davidson ---------- 110 100 000— 3 7 1

Summary—Two-base hits: Cole; double plays: Johnson to Edgar; bases on balls: off Oden 2; struck out: by Walker 4, by
Oden 5; hit batsmen: by Walker (Edgar, Edwards); sacrifice hits: Kugler; stolen bases: Edgar (2).

The game between Davidson Fresh and Raeford American Legion was akin to the first, devolving into a pitchers’ battle between
C. McLean for Raeford, and Maulden for Davidson, resulting in a victory for the former, 5 to 3. In every
phase of the game, the two teams seemed equally matched, the Raeford boys making only five hits, while Davidson scratched
out four. Each team made five errors.

The best game the Wildkittens have played this season was that of Monday afternoon, when they defeated the Raeford American
Legion, 3 to 1, in a mound battle between Oden for the Freshmen and Walker for Raeford. Each team played
air-tight ball that day, Raeford recording only two miscues, to one for the Wildkittens, the pitchers therefore receiving splendid support,
and being left to themselves to battle it out. Raeford obtained six hits off Oden, only one of them being
for an extra base, the only one of the game, this going to Cole, who was the hitting feature of
the afternoon.

Sanity Rare, the humorous magazine, was one of the cleverest bits of college wit ever produced at Davidson. The jokes
were exceptionally good, cartoons were splendid, and the whole makeup of the publication was on a high tone. Much credit
must be given to the entire Junior class for working up such an original, as well as enjoyable, program. The
various committees have been hard at work for some months and deserve a good deal of credit.
