Things took on a definite turn for the better last week for Wildcat baseball with three new men in the
starring roles. Bill Bird’s home run in the last half of the ninth against State is one for the books.
Bill clipped a pretty one which got by the State left fielder with a beautiful shoestring miss. While this unfortunate
picked himself up off the ground, the ball rolled merrily toward the leftfield fence and ducked under the gate for
an out-of-the-park homer. A hole-in-one a up with the linksmen, Bill has pretty much taken over third base hitting streak
while Auburn Laial is in rightfield. Any man who clears four balls in one game should be here to stay.
The four were in spots where they counted; he crossed the plate three times, and hit center fields in the
fourth to bring in the runs. Dave Poole and Jack Burris are also hitting in the pinches and giving the
old-timers a run for their money.

The tennis team took a good bit of the Yale team to the cleaners last week for their first win
of the season. The 8-1 score is no indication of the fight the Yanks put up in every match. Best
match of the afternoon was Bo Roddey’s with Yale’s number one man. Due to financial squeezes which necessitate a cut
in space, with six pages of ads for several issues, we regret that we cannot give a fuller account of
all the sports this week. We want to apologize to all the teams for not getting as much publicity as
they deserve.

NETTERS DOWN CINCINNATI REMAIN UNBEATEN
Friday, April 16, 1948
THE DAVIDSONIAN Page Three

NETTERS TRIM YALE AND CINCY
Davidson's red hot racket wielders continued their blasting vice Friday in downing a scrapping Yale Bulldog team, 7-2. It was
the seventh straight victory for Coach Bartom’s athletes without a loss. Bo Roddey, playing in the number one position, had
to rally from a 5-7 first set loss to down the Bulldog’s number one man, John Moses. The match score
was 5-7, 7-5, 6-3. Roddey then teamed with Whit Cobb to handily cop their doubles match, 9-7, 2-6, 6-1. Ted
and Lenoir Keesler dropped their number one doubles match to Moses and Badger, 6-4, 5-7, 8-6. It was the first
loss of the season for the Keeslers in their number one position. In the other matches, Ted Keesler defeated Badger,
6-0, 6-3; Baldwin of Yale beat Jerry Robinson, 6-3, 6-1; Mike Williams bested Clark, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4; Lenoir Keesler outlasted
Hunt, 3-6, 6-4, 6-3; and Cobb defeated Ned Carroll, 6-3, 1-6, 6-3.

Cats Take Two Conference Wins
Davidson's baseball stock took a sudden jump last weekend as the fighting Wildcats took the measure of the defending Southern
Conference champs and one of the major contenders for this year’s title. In a Friday afternoon home game, Davidson won
an airtight ball game from N.C. State on the splendid pitching of Dick Marlowe and Bill Bird's eighth-inning home run.
Marlowe, a right-handed freshman ace from Hickory, allowed only six scattered hits and walked none. Bird's clout, which bounced through
the left fielder, broke up a 1-1 ball game to give the Wildcats their first conference victory. Lee was the
leading hitter for State with 3 for 4. Burris and Poole hit doubles for Davidson.

Wildcats won their second conference victory on the strength of Lambeth’s tenth inning single with 36 feet six inches, which
was 11 feet farther than his nearest competitor. In the final doubles match, Williams and Robinson teamed up to run
to give the Cats a 7-6 victory over Clemson's Tigers. Matthews hit well for Clemson with 4 for 5.

Ray Coleman, Gunder Gray was Davidson’s peak and breezed to twin triumphs in the mile and two-mile. His time for
the two-mile was 10 minutes 12 seconds, which was a fast time for the Carolina track. Blake Bradley finished second
on Clemson. Lambeth was the leading stickman for Davidson with three victories in both the low and high hurdles. Hopper's
time of 16.3 in the high hurdles barely enabled him to eke out a victory over Whit in the day's
closest engagement.

Despite the individual performances of Newton, Vann, Hopper, and Gray, the Cats lacked substantial strength in the field events, and
consequently absorbed an 82-48 licking. The absence of Whit Cobb hurt immeasurably.
