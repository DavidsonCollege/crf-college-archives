The tryouts have progressed and the cooperation shown by the students. Great possibilities ofa magnificent production have been shown, because
of this ready response from the student body. Mr. Viehman stated that he was especially glad that the agreement between
the faculty and the students was passed. This will enable him to have the student rehearsals with no conflicting examinations.
Also, this will give time enough for the pageant to acquire that desired polish.
