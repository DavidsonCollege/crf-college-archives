**Rusk Program’s conference on hunger takes place this week**

By JENNIFER HOFFMAN

An estimated 730 million people suffer from malnutrition according to the World Bank. “World Hunger” has been chosen by the faculty as the topic for the first Dean Rusk/NCNB Corporation sponsored conference. NCNB has given Davidson a $250,000 grant to sponsor a conference every year which addresses an issue of national and international concern. Since last summer when this year’s topic was decided upon, world hunger has received increasing coverage from the press, making the conference especially timely.

“The issue of world hunger, because of its ethical content, is a very Davidson-like topic,” said Director of the Dean Rusk Program Jack Perry. “It’s a perfect liberal arts subject because of its many facets.” The aim of the conference is to address all aspects: political, economic, international, national, local, nutritional, and ethical. Sessions on April 19-20 will include lectures by top experts in these fields followed by question and answer periods.

Senior economics major Amy Carr has been largely responsible for organizing and overseeing the project. Carr, who will speak Wednesday morning, emphasizes the relevance of the conference as an issue “that affects us all.” She will deal specifically with hunger problems and solutions in Charlotte.

Perry stresses involvement on every level as vital to the conference’s success. A united participation from world hunger authorities, students, staff, and members of the community is what this conference is about. “We want to encourage people to come and go as their schedules allow, to feel free to drift in and out of sessions,” said Perry.

The conference will be held in Chambers. The following events are scheduled:

**Artist Mike Jarmon presents “Me: A Retrospective”**

By JOHN DAVID RAMSEY

Jim Ede, former curator at the Tate Gallery in London, remarked that even in a world that faces annihilation by nuclear war each day, the placement of two pebbles is still important. Put another way, in the face of the enormity of life in the 20th century, we should still take time to notice, to find beautiful the “mundane” objects around us.

Michael Jarmon has perhaps unconsciously taken this thought to heart in his Senior Show, “Me: A Retrospective,” now on view in the Stowe Galleries of Cunningham Fine Arts Building. More than simply showing a number of his paintings, drawings, and prints, Jarmon also shows a number...of objects—stones and pieces of wood; nails, old paint cans and brushes; journals, poems, and papers—through which he attempts to express the difficult “who I am.” In this, the show becomes a retrospective not only of the art but of the artist; its success depends on how much the viewer, or participant, is willing to accept and learn from what Jarmon presents. The foundation of the show is, of course, Jarmon’s art, the paintings. However, a batik of Charlie Brown that Jarmon did while in elementary school marks the young budding artist. Just inside the door is the first canvas Jarmon did in Herb Jackson’s basic painting class entitled “Magnanimous Cow.” While in no way the best work in the show, it is important to the retrospective.

Jarmon, who considers religion the only other major he would have at Davidson, said that “people tend to think artists are opposites—the most secular or viceful types, but they’re not. Art is full of spirituality. An artist is a person, and a person who is given over to a spiritual path whereby he chooses self-confrontation.” Confronting the world around him, an artist acts as a filter as he conveys what he sees. In the process, he sees more about himself. “I think everyone can be an artist in what they do,” Jarmon said.

prints, and drawings on which he has been working since he entered Davidson as a transfer student in 1986. One work predates Davidson, as is the oil crayon “Box,” which marks a watershed in Jarmon’s work in that medium. Several large canvases dominate the exhibit, with the prints and drawings interspersed among them. At the center of the room is a desk Jarmon made and a stool from which you can view the larger paintings; to enjoy the smaller ones requires a walk around the walls. While the large canvases show a great deal of energy and ability (especially the most recent painting, “The Monk and I”), Jarmon’s real strength is in his small drawings, the nails, the journals, scale oil crayon drawings, and prints. Both figurative and non-figurative, these works document the artist’s experimentation and exploration of a variety of styles and techniques.

Two of these works, “The Great Curve,” a print, and an untitled acrylic work (May 1, 1987, 37"x85"), won first place in their category in the UNC Undergraduate Show. Taken as a group, the works illustrate the rapid development of a gifted artist—but also of an artist that continues to find himself and his art. Jarmon has by no means reached artistic maturity (though a number of the works are superb). He has, however, come a remarkably long way, and there is every evidence as he pursues his art full-time after graduation, that he will become an exceptional artist. The whole show in all its parts—the paintings and prints, the desk—is an expression of what Jarmon sees and knows and creates. He said in the brief introduction to the show, “If I could say anything about my vision, it [would] be that art is [an] experience which is shared, and that I hope through my work (as it involves self-exploration) I can communicate with someone else.” Jarmon goes beyond a simple display of paintings to communicate with his viewer; as communication is a two-directional matter, the success of the exchange depends upon the viewer.
