**Soccer Nets Championship, NCAA Bid Expected**

By Bruce Balestier

Two weeks ago in Greenville, S.C., Davidson’s soccer players, many of them in tears, watched as Furman’s players whooped it
up in celebrating their conference regular-season title after a 3-2 win over the ‘Cats. Sunday afternoon in Greensboro, it was
Davidson who did the whooping after winning the Southern Conference Tournament title with a 3-1 victory over Appalachian State in
the final.

For Davidson, the tournament victory all but ensured that the finest season in school history will conclude with an all-important
appearance in the NCAA Tournament. Consecutive losses to Coastal Carolina and Furman late in the season had put a tournament
bid in jeopardy, and set up a clear-cut ultimatum: win the final five games of the season or else. Sunday’s
win over the Mountaineers was the final game in that stretch, and the feeling among the coaches and players was
that a 16-4-3 team with a win over #6 UCLA and ties with #1 N.C. State and #2 Duke does
indeed deserve a bid. The 28-team tournament field was announced this afternoon by the NCAA.

“The kids have really responded all year,” coach Charlie Slagle said. “They’ve earned what they’ve done and it’s been great.
I think we deserve a bid.”

Senior defender Craig Omli saw the tournament invitation as a fait accompli. “This seals up the NCAA bid,” he said.
“It’s what we’ve been shooting for all season.”

The Wildcats got off to an inauspicious start in the game, when sloppy defensive clearing 7:30 in allowed App State’s

**Admission Applicants Up From Last Year**

By Mandy Curtis

The number of applicants for admission at Davidson is up sixty from last year at this time. As of November
5, the admissions office has received a total of 1093 applications as opposed to the 1033 in by the same
date last year. Of the total, 270 of the applicants are early decision. This already breaks last year’s total number
of early decision candidates which was 265. Of the early decision applicants, exactly half, 135, are men and half are
women. The admissions office will be anticipating more as the deadline of November 20 gets closer. Dean of Admissions Nancy
Cable Wells reported that Admissions is still expecting “a big flurry of them.” 413 of the freshman regular applicants are
females while 388 are males. Wells said, “We are opening more of them [Part I of the application] as we
speak.”

Senior Jennie Wagner and Junior Amy Howard contemplate the incredible amounts of work that have incessantly been bestowed upon them
by their ever-loving professors. All this, and more, for only eighteen thousand dollars. Yes, it's quite a bargain.

**Davidson Establishes Morehouse Exchange Program**

By Rachel Dunifon

Two weeks ago Davidson entered into a historic agreement with Morehouse College, establishing a student exchange program with the all-male,
predominantly black school located in Atlanta. Both schools hope that their students will benefit from this unique opportunity to live
and study in drastically different environments from their own.

According to Assistant Dean of Students John Eaves, concrete efforts to establish a permanent exchange program between the two schools
began last year. Eaves, an '84 graduate of Morehouse, used his contacts with his alma mater to determine whether the
school would be interested in considering an exchange program with Davidson. After finding...

The Associate Dean of Admissions, Bob Douthit, referred to Part I as “the easy part.” The second part of the
application for regular applicants is due in by February 1. Because Davidson does not admit on a rolling basis, the
applications have not been read as of yet.Office is continuing to receive mail, to organize files, and to put information
into the computer. Wells remarked that “the numbers look strong,” but until the applications are read, there is “no indication
of quality.” “We'll wait to the 16th or 17th [of November] to begin reading the early applications,” stated Wells. The
admissions counselors will be reading the applications in conjunction with the Faculty Admissions Committee chaired by Bill Mahoney. The application
season for ‘92 and ‘93 will be the first for Wells, who took over the reins from last year’s Interim
Dean of Admissions, Homer Sutton. Douthit said that Sutton “did a wonderful job for us.” “We are staying steady with
last year’s criteria,” said Wells. According to Wells, the admissions office will be “paying attention to the details.”

Historian LaFeber Discusses the U.S. and the "New World Order”
By Meg Davis.

While Bill Clinton won the Presidential election on Tuesday night, historians gathered to listen to Dr. Walter LaFeber discuss the
changing world order, a subject directly related to Clinton’s impending presidency. In a presentation entitled, “The United States and the
New World Order,” LaFeber addressed the shifts in power occurring in the post-Cold War world and posed the question, “What
will replace... the only world we know?”

Specializing in American diplomatic history, LaFeber is the Marie Underhill Noll Professor of History at Cornell University. His works include
fifteen books on U.S. foreign relations. His accolades include Cornell University’s first John M. Clark award for undergraduate teaching. LaFeber
attended Hanover College in Indiana, received his master's from Stanford University, and his Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin at
Madison. He also expressed excitement about his opportunity to speak with Davidson’s Dr. Ralph Levering, who also specializes in United
States diplomatic history.

LaFeber began his discussion of the “new world order” with an explanation of the origins of this phrase first used
publicly by President George Bush in his 1991 State of the Union address. LaFeber quoted Bush as saying, “A new
world order of peace and security, of freedom and the rule of law will reign.” The phrase first came to
the attention of the press in the context of the Bush administration’s reaction to Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait. According to
LaFeber, the irony of the “new world order” is that it was never defined by Bush, nor did a definition
by Bush or Clinton emerge from the recent presidential campaign since the focus rested on domestic issues.

LaFeber feels technology has played a significant part in the definition of this new world order. Technology is leading to
a “decentralization and fragmentation” of power, according to LaFeber. “What is most striking about [technology] is not only the ending
of the... two-camp world in the Cold War, but we’ve also seen... the diffusion of the ability of many other
nations to use this technology militarily and for civilian uses.”

Morehouse representatives to be receptive to the idea, Eaves, along with the Registrar, Financial Aid, and Dean of Admissions offices,
drafted a proposal which was sent to Morehouse and was recently accepted. As stated in the proposal, the exchange program
exists to “establish a plan whereby students at Morehouse College or Davidson College can matriculate on an exchange basis at
an institution that is culturally and racially different than their home institution.” More specifically, the experiences that Davidson hopes for
this program to provide for its students include:

1. Exposure to a campus community with a significant African-American population.
2. Opportunities for personal growth and development through immersion in a different cultural environment.
