Three members of the Hocsak family—Steve, Rosalie, and 4-year-old Stevie—are shown above in their home on North Thompson Street. They asked the photographer to hurry so they would not miss their favorite TV program.

Hocsaks Now Content, Happy
By TOM THRAILKILL
Davidsonian Feature Writer

The personable young man who answered the door of the modest little frame house on North Thompson Street was surprised but pleased at the unexpected visit. Inside, the rest of the family was finishing supper, looking at television. This was the home of Istvan (Steve) Hocsak, a former Hungarian refugee, who arrived with his family in Davidson last January as the result of the YMCA Gift Fund. Mr. Hocsak, his mother Rosalie, his attractive wife Rosie, and four-year-old son Stevie, are now “very content and happy.”

FLUENT ENGLISH

The Hocsaks are working hard and saving money to buy a lot and eventually build a home of their own instead of paying rent as they are now doing. Although their vocabulary consisted only of words such as ‘thank you,’ and ‘please’ when they first came to America, they now speak English very fluently. They give the credit for this ability to Miss Maude Vinson, a retired teacher who gives them help in English twice a week. The biggest trouble Mr. Hocsak has with English is pronunciation. He says that television is the best teacher of a language: “You hear the words and must quickly associate them with the actions to look at TV instead of doing anything.” Television to him is both the world’s best and worst invention. It is best because of its educational value, and is worst because he loses sleep staying up to watch it. The Hocsaks bought the television set before buying a car.

ENGINEER

Steve graduated from the University of Budapest with a degree in electrical engineering. He now has a job with the J. N. Pease Company in Charlotte as a draftsman specializing in electrical systems. In his spare time, he is working on an invention to improve electrical systems which he would not discuss “because it’s too complicated.” His wife now works for Ivey's Inc. in Charlotte.

NEW CHAMP

Steve, who was a champion swimmer in the backstroke and freestyle in Hungary, hopes to participate in some senior swimming meets next summer. He swims at the Charlotte YMCA every day during his lunch hour, but he says that is not enough practice. In Hungary, he swam several times a day. He expressed concern that there is no real organized athletic activity for older people as there is in Hungary. “In America, when one finishes school or gets married, he stops doing anything.” In Hungary, before the Communists took over, about sixty or seventy percent of the boys were members of the Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts. He said that young people would not get into so much trouble if they participated more in the Scout program. The Hocsaks are not only well integrated into the Davidson community; they are interested in helping to improve it.

Military Fraternity Holds Turkey Shoot

Scabbard and Blade, national honorary military fraternity, in connection with the ROTC Department, is holding a Thanksgiving Turkey Shoot.

Ned Payne Attends ROTC Convention

Cadet Capt. Edward M. Payne II, regimental Adjutant of the Davidson ROTC Corps, is representing the local regiment at the National Scabbard and Blade convention this week in St. Louis. As commanding officer of “B” Company, 5th Regiment, the Davidson unit of Scabbard and Blade, Capt. Payne left via plane on Wednesday for St. Louis. During the course of the convention, discussion will center around topics including the relationship between civilian and military organizations, advantages and disadvantages of a Regular Army Commission, how the ROTC student is affected by the six-month or two-year military service plans, and the betterment of Summer Camp training.

Smyth Seeks (Continued From Page One)

The former Dean of Students and professor of history at Davidson expressed a desire that the Council approved his strong comment. The issue was discussed at length, and finally an emergency committee was appointed to study the matter and report to President Smyth today.

LEWIS REPORTS

Phil Lewis reported to the Council on the Student Legislature at Raleigh. Representative Lewis obviously came prepared to defend the controversial inter-racial marriage law passed by the Legislature.

Replacement (Continued From Page One)

Women who are at Davidson College now under the Baker Program will be carried by it through graduation provided they maintain its standards of an overall B average. Davidson was selected for the Baker Scholarship Program in 1948 along with 5 other colleges or universities of different areas in the United States who the Baker Fund felt had ideal setups for the conductance of this program. These were Vanderbilt, University of Rochester, Carlton College of Minn., Sanford, and Kenyon College of Ohio. Mr. Sheridan Logan, executive director of the Baker Scholarship Program, made a recommendation to the trustees of the Fund that they continue the Program at Davidson in spite of the 10-year policy. He felt Davidson had enjoyed a universal success in carrying out the ideals of the Program and that there was not a similar college in this area that could replace Davidson.

Student Body Polled On Dance Weekend Facts

The DAVIDSONIAN attempted to find out the true facts about the dance weekend by polling a representative cross-section of the student body. Students interviewed were asked three questions: 1. What one thing do you dislike most about a Davidson dance weekend? 2. Why did you invite the girl you are dating? 3. How many girls did you ask before you were accepted?

The following statements are the answers received which can be printed:

Grier Davis—1. The incongruity of the pseudo-religious and pseudo-intellectual atmosphere of the normal campus life as contrasted with the intense review Monday night. 2. I kinda love her.

Jimmy Richardson—1. Too many reviews before and after. 2. I’ve been dating her for a year and a half.

John Cassedra—1. The ROTC. 2. She’s the only girl I know I can get along with for two days.

Pete Coleman—1. Rain. 2. She told me she was coming, I didn’t ask her.

Dee Lide—1. Cop Linker. 2. Because I heard she was good looking. She was recommended by a good friend of mine.

Grey Lewis—1. Having to crowd into someone else’s room. 2. I had to, since I’m pinned to her.

George Kemmerer—1. Getting shaft letters on the Thursday before the dance. 2. This is our second date and that first-date charm overwhelmed me.

Jim Owens—1. Monday morning. 2. She’s a lot of fun to be with.

Alec Gould—1. I will miss study time. I’m behind and I need to catch up. 2. I like her company.

Fred Landis—1. They’re too short. 2. I don’t date anybody else.

Henry Chase—1. Monday morning. 2. She’s a lot of fun to be with.

Tenney Deane—1. There are not enough of them. 2. I like her company.

Charles Roberts—1. I don’t like it because the gym is too dark for the dances, and it scares me. 2. Our intellectual interests run along the same line.will get more behind. 2. I'm in college to get an education, and

The trustees, that such a move would cause friction from other schools and would be detrimental to the program's success. Sixty-two Baker Scholarships have been awarded to Davidson students in classes ranging from the Class of 1983 to the Class of 1961.

Students Reminded—Cut Regulations

Hedonism of the dance week. No sleep. 2. She is charming. In fact, I must be learning all the time: This girl stimulates my intellect more than any girl I know.

Vernon Anderson—1. Having Saturday Accounting class on end. 2. I had never met my date, but I had heard nothing but high recommendations about her.

Roger Powell—1. You have to go so damn far after the dances.

had grown in importance to the point where all else taking place in that week was secondary. “The faculty has been decent by allowing students to decide the policy.” The Student Body needs to realize that this is a practice passing out of American life.

Q. “What changes in the Hell Week program are being considered?”
A. (Jones) We are thinking of limiting the actual Hell Week to four days, probably a Thursday through Sunday week. If a fraternity is really interested in a Hell Week they could begin projects a week earlier. “We wouldn't label it a Hell Week because that's a derogatory term.”

Continuing the discussion on the revision of Rush Week, two other changes are being seriously considered. First, would be changing the method of date confirmation for Rush Week. He would eliminate confirmation in the dorms by fraternity men and move it to a central place with the actual work being a matter between the individual freshman and the IFC. Bob Jones indicated that specific proposals will be made in December. Secondly, the IFC is considering cutting down the number of rush dates from eleven to nine during the first three days of the week since many fraternities have already dropped the afternoon dates anyway.

Jones also denied the claims that under a preferential bidding system fraternities would not get the boys they want. On the contrary, he stated, they would get more quality since they would not have to worry about quantity.

AFTER DANCE PARTIES
Q. “Is there much talk about the after-dance parties?”
A. Professor McGavock: “This is a favorite topic of conversation among the faculty, trustees, and parents. We are more at a loss to explain these than any other phase of college life.” Dr. McGavock expanded his remarks to say that one of the main arguments used to persuade the trustees to allow dancing on the campus when the question arose right after World War II was that if students were allowed to have their socials on campus then they would stay off the highways. Now it seems, with these parties, that the danger has increased especially since often the student drivers have been drinking.

Q. “Bob, when will the IFC take action?”
A. It is the next thing on the agenda, next Tuesday night.

PREFERENTIAL BIDDING
Q. “Has progress been made on the preferential bidding system?”
A. (Jones) “Specific proposals will be made in December.” We are thinking of moving Rush Week up a week earlier so that it will run into two days of Orientation. This would mean that the upperclassmen would have to come back one or two days earlier.

MAXIMUM NUMBER
Q. “What do you think the top limit on the number of boys in a fraternity should be?”
A. Professor McGavock: “I think that a fraternity fails in its main purpose when the membership becomes too large. Perhaps 50 members should be the upper limit. My own experience was to belong to a fraternity in the days when the average size was 30 members. Almost all of these fraternity brothers were close friends in the truest sense of the word. Most of these fine friendships have continued through the years. It was not Hell Week that cemented our bonds of brotherhood but a genuine interest in one another and in the common interests that arose through close associations. To say that a fraternity group can only be welded together through the medium of mutual exhaustion, humiliation, and loss of sleep is to confess that the fraternity is failing in its fundamental purpose.”

Jones also brought up the idea that he strongly supports a preferential bidding system and a quota system. The advantages of these (“we can’t have a quota system without a preferential bidding system”) would be twofold. Primarily these two things would help the fraternities in that they would be limited to about 55 to 60 members. “It is not a real fraternity when you have sixty boys, and with 80... that’s a club!” Secondly, a quota system would strengthen the independent group. “Fraternities have a responsibility to see that all aspects of the college are working well,” concluded Jones. He pointed out that in reference to the rest of the college program and life, this is an “inconsistent sort of thing.”

TWO PROBLEMS
Summing up the faculty's viewpoint Dr. McGavock stated that there are essentially two problems facing them. First, Hell Week and the importance it has assumed in relation to the rest of the college program, and the question of the unofficial after-dance parties. He referred to the latter as “a symptom we have little control over but realize very much.”
