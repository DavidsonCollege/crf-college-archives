Alumnus Jim Abel, Carlton Cook, and former student Dave B. But the “Old Grads” got a break through a penalty
and held off the Wildcats. The final score was 14-0.

After the game, Davidson took a brief rest before continuing in the consolation bracket. After an hour of rest, Davidson
made ready to play Wheeling College.

With great moral support by alumnus Ted “the Red” Elliot, Davidson played superbly. Davidson scored first on a long run
when Victor MacMillan made a pass to McCartney. Smith made the conversion kick good.

On a strong effort by the scrum (Mark Armstrong, Carlton Cook, and Bill Kelly), and great running by Smith and
Lehnberg, Davidson scored again to lead 10-0. However, a broken tackle in the second half led to a Wheeling College
score, but the conversion kick was missed.

For the rest of the game, the Wildcats played defensive ball, and as the clock ran out, Davidson finished with
a storming victory over Wheeling, 10-4.

Afterwards, Davidson fell to Virginia Commonwealth University, 10-0.

...then came on strongly to take third place with a pin in the consolation finals.

This year’s team is young and inexperienced, with only one senior on the team. As the young wrestlers gain experience,
the Davidson grapplers could come on surprisingly well by the end of the year. The wrestlers take on Catawba College
on Tues., Dec. 10, and on Friday, Dec. 13, they travel to Salisbury to meet a much-improved Livingstone College team.
