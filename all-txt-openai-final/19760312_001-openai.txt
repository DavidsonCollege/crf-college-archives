Davidson College Head Basketball Coach Bo Brickels was dismissed on Friday, March 5. The dismissal followed back-to-back losing seasons of 7-19 and 5-21. The College is presently searching for a new head coach. Assistant coaches K. Harry Krohn and James J. Larranga indicated that they too will leave the Davidson basketball program. They will join either high school or similar college programs. Assistant Coach James Edward Brown was not available for comment. Brickel’s dismissal ended two years.

**Secretaries claim Stephenson stalls**

“Robert Stephenson has neglected the duties of his position as Personnel Director by engaging for an entire year in stall tactics concerning the production of this secretarial employment handbook,” claimed one college secretary. “He failed to begin working on the handbook back in September after saying that he would,” remarked another secretary. “And ever since you (this reporter) got him to commit himself to a date for beginning work on the handbook in November, and to a completion date which has now passed, he (Stephenson) has evaded for no good reason his duties,” claimed a third secretary.

The Chambermaids, a local group of college secretaries, clerks, and stenographers, requested last spring that Stephenson begin work on compiling a handbook for all hourly-paid staff. Several months later, in September, the Personnel Director stated that work on the handbook had not yet begun. Stephenson explained (on September 26) his delay by remarking that because “of a reduction in secretarial personnel in this (the personnel) office, we would be unable to start on the handbook...”

Representatives of the Chambermaids challenge “this excuse about a lack of personnel. We (several secretaries) would be willing to help get the manual together during off-the-clock hours. We just think Stephenson has failed to produce the job handbook because he would rather not have information concerning hiring, promotion, and firing procedures, job descriptions, and wage scales and benefits made available to us. Every employee deserves to have this sort of information available to him or her to avoid unjust discrimination. Stephenson won't cooperate because he does not operate under many standard employment procedures, and this just isn’t fair,” claimed another.

Stephenson (on September 26) went on to say that College President Samuel R. Spencer Jr. had agreed to “put some part-time assistance in this office.” In addition, he claimed that work on the handbook would begin by November 24, 1975, and be completed by March 8, 1976.

As of January 13, no part-time assistant had been hired and no work had begun on the handbook. On January 13, Stephenson retracted his former statement that he had been given “the go-ahead in hiring a part-time assistant” on September 26. He said that he had been given the okay just now (January 13) to get “a part-time secretary.”

On January 16, Stephenson again assured this reporter that the handbook would be completed by “the beginning of Spring term,” or by Monday, March 8. As of today, the Personnel Office has not yet hired a part-time assistant or completed the employment handbook.

“In other words,” explained one secretary, “it has now been one full year, from last spring to this spring, that Stephenson has promised to put together a handbook but has failed to do so. He’s engaged in a one-year long stall campaign, and the secretaries might just be aggravated enough now to exert...”some real pressure to get this handbook,” she continued. of head coaching at Davidson, which might have been followed by a third year. A review of Brickel’s coaching record over the past two seasons, however, was carried out. According to Athletic Director Thom Cartmill, the results of this investigation were not sufficiently favorable to warrant keeping Brickels on as head coach. “It was a question of interpretation,” said Cartmill. “It depends on what one considers adequate progress. I looked at adequate progress in terms of improvement in coaching ability and cohesiveness of the team down the stretch.” According to Cartmill, three factors were considered in the dismissal. First, Brickels’ ability to recruit; second, the solidarity of the basketball players; and third, Brickels' ability to coach.” Krohn, the Sumter Daily Item, and sources within the athletic department indicated that the decision to [see TRUSTEES, page 2] have been waiting for over a year for a secretarial handbook.

Williams seeks more funds, begins development work

Work on a new $35 million capital development program is proceeding on schedule, according to Vice President for Development Craven Williams. According to Williams, the Trustees approved the project in principle at its February 26 meeting. “The president (College President Samuel R. Spencer, Jr.) presented to the board a proposed 10-year development program, highlighting the need for $50 million. The president said that due to certain indicators our immediate sights are being set at $35 million, with the idea that as soon as we hit $35 million, we will go to $50 million,” said Williams.

Williams elaborated on why $35 million was targeted, even though the college actually needs $50 million. Williams said that he used two basic formulas in determining what the college could realistically expect to raise in a development program: “The first formula utilizes the number of donors we have in various categories: alumni, non-alumni, corporations, and foundations. This is where Mark Connors’ (assistant to Williams) work is so important. “We have about 13,000 individuals who support Davidson financially. I know most of the foundations and corporations. But for information about the alumni and non-alumni donors, I go to Mark. He compiles the basic data concerning these individuals,” said Williams.

The second formula that Williams described dealt with the size of gifts to the college and the number of contributions of various sizes. “The basic rule is that the top 150 donors end up giving two-thirds of the total,” he said. -Leon Venable “However, I’ve been willing to fudge this rule and say that Davidson can have 250 donors in this top category. Davidson does not have many ultra-wealthy donors. Many of our donors are professional people. Due to this large number of professionals, I feel that we can expect more than the usual 150 top donors.”

“These are formulas that I find, and other colleges have also found, work the best. I have gone through and attempted in a year to decide who our top 250 donors are and I’ve tried to decide what their potential is and what they are likely to give. The total amount given I estimated for these top donors is two-thirds of what we can expect to raise. The $35 million figure was derived from this formula,” said Williams.

The project statement shows Davidson’s endowment of approximately $17 million as ranking sixteenth out of 27 selected colleges and universities. The list ranges from a high of $126 million at Oberlin to a low of $5.6 million at Antioch. [see WILLIAMS, page 8]
