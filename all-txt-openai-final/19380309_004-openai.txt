Topsy-Turvy Tournament at Raleigh Sees Duke Take Clemson Tigers in Finals, 40-30—Champions Fail to Place

Wildcat Grapplers Place Fourth in Team Standings as V.M.I. Captures First — Joe Craver Reaches Finals

A hard scrimmage Saturday afternoon rang down the curtain on Davidson's football practice.

Four Davidson varsity gridders fared well in the annual Southern Conference wrestling tournament held in Blacksburg, Va over the past weekend.

Captain Howard McFadyen, in the unlimited division, took top honors in his class by victories over two conference foes. Joe Craver, in the 135-pound class, took third place, while the other two Davidson entries, Graham McFadyen, and Telford, advanced to the semi-finals.

McFadyen pinned Vielder of V.M.I. in the semi-finals and then came back to take a decision over Lykes of W. & L. in the finals.

Craver drew a bye in the quarter-finals and then gained a decision over Donnelly of Duke in the semi-finals. Reeves of V.M.I. took the finals from Craver and then Broom of W. & L. took the consolation match, giving Craver third place in the tourney.

This year’s tournament was about as topsy-turvy as any tournament held. In fact, only two favorites, Iverson and “Foo” Bowman, ends, were almost considered toss-ups.

Big Fred Edwards and Ed Swindell were the outstanding Devil performers. Banks McFadyen, sophomore center, was the star man through the tournament.

Taken all in all the 1938 tournament was about as topsy-turvy as any tournament held. In fact, only two favorites, Iverson and “Foo” Bowman, ends, were almost considered toss-ups.

Big Fred Edwards and Ed Swindell were the outstanding Devil performers. Banks McFadyen, sophomore center, was the star man through the tournament.

The interclass volleyball started on Tuesday with a game between the Sophomores and the Juniors, and another between the freshmen and seniors. Results were not known.

The interclass game will be run on a round-robin affair with each class playing every other class once, for a total of six games.

At present it seems that the burden of the responsibility will rest on the shoulders of Bill Davis, who toward the last of the past season was rapidly developing into a dangerous triple-threat back.

There are Fred Stair, Bitts Watkins, “Blackdog” Hunter, Frank Harrison, and Bill Beatty who are rapidly developing into dangerous backs. If the coaches can mold a good offense around these backs, the 1938 edition of the ‘Cats should enjoy a successful season.

The proverbial orchids to Howard McFadyen, tackle, who was the star man through the tournament.

The annual spring tennis tournament got underway last Monday with several matches of the first round being played off.

Ambitious golfers began their qualifying rounds last week and are expected to be finished by Saturday. Rounds have been played on the Charlotte country club course and have consisted of 72 holes.

At present time Ray Pittman was on top of the tallies with a 256. However, only half of the candidates have reached the 54 holes stage.

The ping pong tournament is still in progress.Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

The score ended with a bang and with the ex- citement made good showings in the 238 for the Pentathlon at the recitation. The fall affair completed the Day. Baseball practice has got underway for the season. A ranking ladder will be made as soon as the tournament is completed and play will continue for the remainder of the season. Many results return to aid the cindermen and aspirants for the nine. According to Manager Lloyd Feuchtenberger, the team will play its first match, which will be an early season affair, with the Hickory Tennis Club on the courts March 19. The next matches will not be played, however, until the spring holidays, at which time a tour of the south will be made on the 23rd, and during it, five or six matches with southern schools will be played. Among these schools will be the University of South Carolina, Presbyterian College, and Rollins College. The schedule opens on March 19 with a match against Catawba at Charlotte. The spring trip begins March 23 and will probably end the night of the 30th when the whole team returns to Davidson.

With prospects again bright for the Wildcat trackmen, the first meet of the season, with the Wildcats warming up seriously, will be held on Saturday.
