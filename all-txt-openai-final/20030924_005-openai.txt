### Making Art, Making a Difference

After holding a student art sale last semester to benefit Habitat for Humanity, the Davidson College photography club has decided
once again to raise money for a good cause by selling the fruits of Davidson students’ creative labors. This time
the proceeds from the event will go to a book club for community teenagers. The sale will run from 10
a.m. to 3 p.m. in the Union atrium on Wednesday, Oct. 1, and will feature photographs, drawings, and other art
by Davidson students and faculty. Event coordinator Sally Stanhope ’05 describes the works as “invaluable.” Pictured below are some of
the pieces that will be up for sale.

If you think that your life couldn’t get any worse, then “The Magdalene Sisters” is the movie for you. I
for one left the theater perfectly aware that my life is pretty darn good.

In a perversely inspiring way, this cold, brutal film will show you that any complaints you have about the world
are mere annoyances compared to the monastic hell endured by the female victims of the Irish Magdalene convents. As unentertaining
as pedigreed cinema gets, Peter Mullan’s “The Magdalene Sisters” will leave you completely numb and confused as to why you
decided to go to the movies in the first place.

The painfully honest “Magdalene Sisters” never once suggests that hope springs eternal. It embraces the moral destruction of its protagonists
with unflinching truthfulness, refusing to shy away from certain realities of captivity that are often censored from the screen.

The film begins by introducing three Irish women in the 1960s who, as the result of differing degrees of sinfulness,
are exported to the Magdalene sisterhood to cleanse themselves of their wrongdoings. Margaret (Anne-Marie Duff) is raped by her cousin,
Rose (Dorothy Duffy) has a child out of wedlock, and Bernadette (Nora-Jane Noone) simply flirts with schoolboys all too often;
in the eyes of their families and teachers, all of these trespasses constitute mortal sins deserving of severe punishment.

This perplexed trio arrives at the Magdalene convent, where they quickly meet Sister Bridget (Geraldine McEwan), the nunnery’s slight yet
frightening chief. As she counts her significant supply of cash on her desk, she informs the newcomers that only prayer
and endless good works in the laundry room will lead these aimless girls to salvation.

It doesn’t take long for Margaret, Rose, and Bernadette to realize that purity exists only on the surface in the
Magdalene asylum. They are exposed to both physical and mental cruelty, from incessant beatings to torturous silences. Girls who try
to run away are sent to Sister Bridget for a haircut, and her scissors often cut deeper than the scalp.

Mullan never succumbs to supplying the audience with any shred of optimism. Given the nuns’ fierce watch on all of
the convent’s activities, the girls cannot forge the kind of relationship that would make such a depraved lifestyle bearable. By
the end, they care even less for each other than they did at the beginning.

Despite the consistently off-putting austerity of the production, it would be a sin to ignore the skill involved in making
audience members like me so miserable. With a nightmarishly sweet, grandmotherly voice that would send chills up the spine of
the Wicked Witch of the West, McEwan’s Sister Bridget steals the show from her subtler co-stars. The authenticity of the
film makes her surreal, almost cartoonish delivery even more terrifying.

Contending with McEwan for most haunting performance is supporting actress Eileen Walsh, who plays the frantic, brainwashed Crispina. Like Rose,
the Magdalene convent claimed Crispina for having a premarital birth. The child she never met occasionally comes with her sister
to the gates of the convent, where mother and son communicate from 100 yards apart via their St. Christopher medallions.
An incident with Bernadette at the halfway point sends Crispina reeling into mental illness, and while I won’t give anything
away, her downfall casts an enduring spell over the film’s final frame.

As noble as it is, “The Magdalene Sisters” boasts very little in the way of uplifting qualities. While intentionally graphic
films usually justify their existence through a powerfully stated moral, Peter Mullan is content simply to say nothing and show
everything. And granted, as horrible as the words to describe this picture may be, it is definitely worth a thousand
of them.
