You make me feel

I want to drink St. Pauli’s girls

with you

talk long hours to you

and I let myself loose

before you ©

I shake down my hair for you

and let you watch the colors dance in the light

“I am not for you” —

then why do your fingers stir me?

There are times when I want to take you

alone and

times when I dream of you

touching me in the dark

because your fingers stirred me

once

remember-

I asked you to...

my shoulders are so sore,

would you please...

you let a stray finger

caress my neck and I felt it

like a cheap novel it burned downward

I felt it

others have touched

but only one has stirred

and now you.

S. Dickey '84

Come Summer

When summer’s breeze

fills sunfish sails

beneath blue skies:

and soft jet-trails,

how remote will be

this winter’s freeze

as memories fade

with each sunrise

- diminishing like

tadpole tails.
