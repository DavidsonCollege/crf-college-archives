BENNETT SPEAKS AT Y. M.C. A.

At the regular Y. M. C. A. meeting last Thursday evening, R. H. Bennett gave an excellent talk on “The Problems of South America.” He stated that due to the oppression by the Roman Catholics these people had developed such characteristics as suspicion, low moral standards, common irreverence, laziness, and its sequence, ignorance, seventy-one per cent of these people being illiterate. He pointed out that this oppression...brought about also a crisis in both educational, commercial, and industrial matters. But, he explained, the people are beginning to realize their conditions and are fast removing this state of servitude and submission to Catholicism. By the aid of Pan-American influences, and largely by the aid of Tomorrow.

During the meeting, resolutions were passed thanking W. G. Somerville for his work as president and expressing regret at being forced to accept his resignation.

CLUB HOLDS MEETING

BLUE PENCIL IMPORTANT

The Blue Pencil club held its regular meeting last Wednesday night in the Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity hall. New members will be elected from the Junior class on March 6th. Library topics and literary interests around the campus were discussed. The club has decided to install in the near future a special book section in the library which will contain books written by alumni. Books have been found containing picture sketches of Ney, by Marshall Ney himself, who was one of the bravest of Napoleon's generals, and a member of the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor of France. After the battle of Waterloo, he was arrested and found guilty of high treason by the House of Peers, and was thought to have been shot in the garden of Lawembourg. However, he escaped to America and founded a school near Davidson.
