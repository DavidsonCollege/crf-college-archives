**TIMBER: One of the three trees the school lost fell in front of Belk.**

**Ice storm clean-up costs could surpass $50,000**

The worst winter storm in recent Carolinas history began innocently enough, with afternoon snow showers blanketing the ground and allowing
snowball fights and sledding runs to break out across the Davidson campus. But by the time it was over, no
one was having fun.

A peaceful snowfall soon turned into a crippling ice storm, causing trees to crash to the ground and knocking out
power to more than two million residents across the Southeast. Davidson wasn’t spared. College officials say repair costs could total
more than $50,000, most of that related to tree damage.

Only three large trees fell under the weight of the ice, but nearly all sustained significant damage. None caused any
major injuries—but barely. One student received minor scrapes when a tree near the front of the Union toppled on Thursday
morning. Another large tree next to Cannon Hall fell just short of the Belk dorm—sparing sleeping students inside from what
could have been a disaster.

“That one probably disturbed me the most. I think it was the most significant of all. (But) for a campus
with as many trees as this one, that’s pretty lucky,” said Joy Cleary, the Physical Plant grounds supervisor.

Physical Plant employees began arriving at 11 p.m. on the night of the storm, and some worked for 36 straight
hours to restore power to several key buildings, including Richardson and Belk dorms, and Vail Commons, said David Holthouser, director
of the Physical Plant.

“Seventy-five percent of them were here working when their own families were without power,” said David Holthouser. “The gang was
very loyal to the College, and really put in the extra effort, really when they should’ve been home.”

Workers were able to restore power to Chambers Building by the next morning, ensuring that classes could continue as scheduled.
“The campus has a long history of not canceling class,” said Holthouser. “After Hurricane Hugo, classes were only canceled for
one day. I guess unless it’s pitch dark, classes go on.”

With power restored to most other buildings by afternoon, workers turned their attention to removing dangling limbs and debris scattered
across campus—a project that has yet to be completed. “It’s an ongoing process and probably will be for the next
year,” said Cleary.

An e-mail circulated across campus inviting students to pitch in with the initial clean-up efforts. More than 50 turned out,
and Cleary credits them with speeding the painstaking process. “I was very pleased with how it went,” she said. “It
was so heartening, a real boost to my crew.”

Townspeople without power in their homes gravitated toward the warmth and activity of Alvarez College Union on Thursday night, prompting
some observers to dub it “Alvarez Refugee Center.”

The dining services staff catered a campus-wide hot meal in the Knobloch Campus Center on Thursday night, since Vail Commons
and most Patterson Court eating houses were without adequate power.

“One of the good things that came out of (the storm) was that the Union became a ‘community’ community center,”
said College President Bobby Vagt.
