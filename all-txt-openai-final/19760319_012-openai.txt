Davidson’s Men’s Tennis Team extended their record to 4-2-1 by recording two victories and two losses during the week. In a match played yesterday, Davidson lost 7-2 to a powerful Atlantic Coast Conference squad from Duke. Tom Shelly was the only Davidson singles player to pull an upset as he beat the Blue Devils’ Bobby Bitter in three sets. Shelly got off to a slow start by losing the first set 1-6 but then rallied for 7-6 and 6-3 victories in the second and third sets respectively. The only other Davidson victory came on a forfeit by Duke in the number three doubles match.

Davidson Coach Jeff Frank felt that, despite the one-sided score, the loss was a “good loss.” “Last year we played virtually the same Duke team with a more experienced squad and they beat us 9-0. This year we played more younger players and only lost 7-2 so in a sense it was a good loss.” Frank also feels that playing such a powerful squad early in the season will help his young Wildcats gain maturity. “Right now we have five sophomores and four freshmen, all of whom are seeing at least some action. And although they may not be able to beat these stronger players, they will get a chance to gain experience and learn how to think on the court against the better tennis players.”

Earlier in the week, Davidson got one of its few breathers against a decimated Rochester squad. Due to injury and illness, the Northern visitors were only able to field four players and were blown out by the Wildcats 6-0. Junior Steve Holman and Junior John Mitchell crushed their opponents by the identical scores of 6-1, 6-0. Frank was extremely pleased with the play of Steve Johnson and Gil Kayton in the number one doubles match and John Trout and Shelly in the number two doubles match. Kayton, Trout, Shelly, and Andy White are the four freshmen on the team and Frank feels they are progressing well. “Gil and Andy are really helping us in the doubles and John is just now making up for the work he missed in the fall when he had mono and will be stronger as the season progresses.”

Davidson played its first conference opponent Friday and came away with a rain-shortened 4-1 victory over William and Mary. Davidson won the numbers three, four, five, and six matches handily with only Chip Bondurant losing in the number one match. “Chip played under his capability but he will not face an easy opponent all year in the number one match,” explained Frank. “He and Mike Barnhill in the number two seed will consistently be playing the other teams’ strongest players and unlike the third through sixth seeds, they never get a break, especially since we play so many scholarship teams.”

Davidson lost their first match of the season to Swarthmore 7½-1½. Holman picked up the only Davidson victory 7-6, 6-4 and a doubles.The match had to be called off due to darkness, accounting for Davidson’s other 2 points. Davidson has now played seven home matches in less than two weeks. Frank feels that so many matches in a short period of time will have its advantages and disadvantages. “When something goes off in a kid’s game in this situation, he may not have time to work on correcting the problem, but by the time we get into the conference schedule, we will have a great deal of experience. When they’ve played teams like Swarthmore, Duke, and North Carolina, they won’t be intimidated by teams like Furman and Appalachian.”

Frank feels that his squads, along with Furman, Appalachian, and the Citadel, will be strongest in conference competition. Davidson will have the benefit of about 15 matches' experience before facing Southern Conference foes, and Frank feels they will be ready.

The Girls’ Varsity Tennis Team opened their season with two close matches against Clemson and Furman last week. Despite a strong effort by the girls, they were defeated in both matches by identical 5-4 scores.

Coach Pat Drake viewed the defeats optimistically. “I feel that this past week was one of the toughest that our girls are going to face,” she said. “The scores were remarkably close considering that the other two teams had been practicing months in advance. For instance, the Clemson girls had been weight training since the end of August.”

Despite Davidson’s comparably late entry into the collegiate tennis season, their match play reflects the depth of this year’s Girls’ Varsity Tennis Team. In the Clemson singles matches, third-seeded Becca Stimson and fourth-seeded Sue McAvoy recorded victories. The second-seeded doubles team of Sue McAvoy and Dea Booth and the third-seeded team of Nancy Brown and Andrea Murphy both won respectively.

In reviewing the loss at Clemson, team captain Dea Booth said, “Even though I forgot my glasses, the remainder of the team kept a sharp eye on their opponents. We can only improve as the season goes on.”

Thursday’s home match against Furman proved to be another disappointing loss for the team. Stimson and McAvoy showed consistency by winning their singles matches, while sixth-seeded Ruth Murphy also recorded a win. The second-seeded team of McAvoy and Booth captured the only doubles victory of the day. Davidson’s number one doubles, Stimson and Kirk Cameron, showed the potential to become a first-rate working doubles team during the season.

This week the team will meet Converse in an away match, and Monday they travel to Queens College for a make-up match.
