### THE VIRGINIA GAME

The late football game against Virginia brought to light several facts. It showed that Davidson has one of the strongest, fastest, scrappiest teams she has had in years. It shows that she has a coach such as few other colleges are privileged to have. It shows that Davidson pep, famous in the past, must be here in double portion this year, since it can make a team “outplay both on offensive and defensive” a much heavier and more experienced team, for the last three quarters. It shows, too, that Davidson is hooked for a victorious season.

And so we are proud of Davidson, that she can put out such a team. We are grateful to the alumni who have helped. We are proud of our coach. We are proud of each man on the team. Yes, and we are proud of the Scrubs, without whose work the Varsity would be helpless. And lastly, we are proud of ourselves that we belong to such a college.

### BE A KICKER

“Don't be a kicker, be a booster,” is a slogan much used in the editorial columns of various publications. But we disagree. Be a kicker, we say, and kick hard, provided you kick forward and not backward. If there is anything about The Davidsonian, or any other phase of college life, that you don't like, or don't approve of, kick about it, but kick it forward. Let your criticism be constructive as well as destructive. Condemn a poor policy or plan, but have a better to offer in its stead. Call the questions for debate in the literary societies poor, if they are, but suggest some better ones. Denounce the stand of the Student Council, if you do not approve of it, but show a wiser, more practical course. It is only through forward kickers that The Davidsonian or anything else can grow bigger and better.

### LETTER TO STUDENT BODY

**Editor of The Davidsonian:**

As a loyal alumnus of Davidson, I wish to say just a word to the Student Body. That score against Virginia Saturday looks mighty good, and we friends of Davidson want to see the whole Student Body down in Charlotte next Saturday backing up that team of Red and Black warriors against A. & M. I believe Davidson has one of the best teams she has ever had, and we can beat that bunch next Saturday if the Student Body gets in behind the team with some of the old-time “pep” and spirit.

The writer is a member of the class which furnished eight of the eleven men who tied Virginia, beat V. P. I., Clemson, and Georgia, all on their own fields. He believes that the team this year will be just as good, and if every student now at Davidson had the...same feeling toward A. & M. that existed in the fall of 1908, they would all be on the sidelines in Charlotte Saturday. Give the fellows a proper send-off on Friday night. They will do their part, and you students must do yours. Best wishes for a happy and successful year. “1909.”

DR. McCONNELL'S RELEASE SOUGHT

Thru Dr. Wm. J. Martin’s untiring efforts the release of Dr. J. W. McConnell seems almost certain. Dr. Martin took this matter up with the Secretary of War and also with President Wilson. He has received a telegram from the War Department stating that if Dr. McConnell would put in his resignation, it would be favorably considered. Dr. McConnell at once wired in his resignation. While it is not certain, it is believed that Dr. McConnell will be released and back on the campus within a few days.

CHEER LEADERS ELECTED

Due to the fact that E. H. Linfield failed to return to college this fall, the Student Body was left without a cheer leader. At a meeting last week the following men were elected: W. H. Neal, cheer leader; J. S. Brown and H. K. Aiken, assistants.

TENNIS TOURNAMENT STARTS NEXT MONDAY

The Annual Tennis Tournament will probably begin next Monday, October 9th. Every effort is being made to have the courts in shape by that date. Plans have not been perfected as yet. There will probably be a change from the custom of recent years with regard to entrance fees. All contestants are practicing every day now and with the increase in interest and popularity of the game here, indications point to the best tournament ever held here.

SPECIAL TRAIN TO CHARLOTTE SATURDAY

Arrangements have been completed for running a special train to Charlotte Saturday on account of the A. & M. football game, and it is hoped the entire student body will avail themselves of this opportunity to see one of the best games of the whole season at reduced rates. The train will leave Davidson at 1:30 p.m., and returning will leave Charlotte at 11 p.m. There will be a special round trip rate of 80 cents, and while the regular admission to the game will be one dollar, Davidson students will be admitted for 50 cents, provided tickets are purchased on the Hill.

GOOD PRINTING CONSISTS OF MORE THAN INK, TYPE & PAPER

While there is nothing mysterious about the process, it requires, among other things, good judgment, taste, and a desire to keep ahead or above the average. The goodness of printing is governed by the printer’s equipment plus his ability to use it. We have a generous supply of both and are constantly adding to them. Our line embraces all kinds and classes of work, but we prefer to do the better kind. If you desire the best in any class we can meet your requirements, and guarantee to please you.
