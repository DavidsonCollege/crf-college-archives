### The Old South? Workers allege discrimination
### College pays workers poverty wages

“We barely make enough wages to keep our families fed and healthy, much less improving the situation of our children,”
said one black, hourly-paid employee of Davidson College. This black employee, with a job classification of general helper, works 40
hours weekly and has a take-home pay of under $95 a week. “On only $90 a week how can I
help my children have a better life than me? With food bills, doctor visits and prescription bills, gas and electricity
bills and more, we barely make it through the week. If I don’t have nothing left to save, how can
I save my children from a life like mine?”

The plight of this worker is common to many of the college’s employees, both black and white, who serve as
custodians, general helpers, groundsmen, and maintenance-utility men.

#### Wage rates
- Custodians: $2.41-2.82
- General Helper/Groundsman: $2.52-2.94
- Maintenance-Utility Man: $2.64-3.07
- Mechanic/Carpenter: $3.49-4.29
- Electrician: $3.78-5.10

There are no black employees in the two highest hourly-paid wage brackets: maintenance mechanic/carpenter and maintenance electrician. “This place is
so segregated. You're kept in your place here, financially and socially, and that’s why we’re kept at the other side
of the tracks. No black employee here makes over $3.00 an hour but a very few. And one, since he’s
an electrician, he ought to be making nearly $4.00 an hour, but they (the college administration) don’t give it to
him like they do the other white electricians,” said one employee.

Director of Personnel and Administrative Services Robert J. Stephenson said that no skilled black had ever applied to work at
Davidson since at least 1966 (the year Stephenson began his employment with the college). “That’s because the college doesn’t want
no skilled and educated black workers here. If they was here, then we could get organized and be represented,” remarked
one black employee.

Stephenson gave two other reasons explaining why blacks did not hold positions which offered higher wages. “First, we can’t show
a newly employed worker here a career ladder, which could illustrate to him how he might progress with pay and
promotion throughout his employment career. We can’t do this because our rate of employee turnover is so low. I’d like
to be able to promote people, but since we don’t have a high rate of turnover, we can’t.

#### No job training program
“Second, we don’t have a formalized on-the-job training program which would provide us with trained employees who we could move
into positions when they are vacated,” commented Stephenson.

“This just shows me that the college wants to keep us down. If they didn’t, they’d spend the time to
train us,” said one white employee. “If we weren’t dedicated to this place (the college), I could understand the administration.
But, man, some of us have been here 20, 30, 40 years,” he continued.

Stephenson remarked that Davidson College has made much progress over the years in improving the salaries and benefits of hourly-paid
workers. In the 1930’s a custodian, a general helper or a groundsman received $11 in wages for a 45-hour work
week. By 1955, weekly wages were $30, and in 1965 such an employee received $50 weekly. “Beginning last year,"Workers were
given a medical plan offering them coverage for various hospital and other medical expenses along with a plan of educational
benefits," said Stephenson. "We appreciate the benefits, but what good are they if we don’t know how to use them,"
said one black employee. "You (this reporter) tell me I can get 80% of me and my wife’s prescriptions paid
for by the medical plan (if the amount of expenses is in excess of $100 within a period of three
consecutive months). Nobody ever told me that. My wife’s been sick for a while and I left the mill to
come here because I’ve got an asthma problem. We both use lots of prescriptions and nobody ever told me (about
the benefits)," he continued.

"We do have a certain amount of benefits that help out. But we don’t make any wage money here," commented
another black employee. "I don’t know why I stay. I guess it just feels like home and I keep hoping,
hoping that things will get better."

Workers must moonlight. Those black, hourly-paid employees who are able-bodied try to supplement their Davidson College wages by working in
other jobs at night. "Many of us cut grass out at Lake Norman after we leave here at 5 p.m.
Some of the others work the night shifts in mills. Everyone’s wife works, if they are well," said one employee.

In the early 1960s, some black employees attempted to organize the hourly-paid staff and present various grievances to the administration,
according to several sources. "Our main concern back in the 60s was with wages. At $50 a week, we barely
got by," said one black employee. "During our organization movement, a man in the administration (who is still at Davidson
College) told me to forget about the organizing effort or I could forget about my job. He said he’d do
okay by me if I would forget the union talk. He tried to bribe me by saying that he was
going to give me a raise. I had to keep my job because I had my family, you know. A
few weeks later he gave every one of those hourly workers a raise except me," said this employee.

"That kind of intimidation was common practice when I was working here," said a former employee who now resides in
Davidson, "and it still goes on."

"I had a reason for staying here once. I was going to try to make it better for every one
of the workers. But I found out soon, because of the administration, that I couldn’t do a thing," said another
black employee.

Personnel Director Stephenson said, "I see my role as an administrator and as a spokesman for the workers. I try
to represent them and help them get increased wages and benefits."

"While we’ve all been hurt by inflation, the lower-income people are the least able to endure. We plan to give
them a wage increase in late May. The faculty and administrative staff received pay raises last week. We will also
award some additional money to employees on the basis of merit," said Stephenson.

"The raise will help, but since it only increases our weekly earnings by about $10, we will still barely make
$100 a week. They’re poverty wages," said one employee.
