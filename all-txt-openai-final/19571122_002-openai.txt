**Thanksgiving---Result Of The American System**

The frontiersman’s dream of a land of plenty from sea to sea is no longer a mere vision in America. The dreams of past generations are the realities of today. And so the hopes of today will be the order for tomorrow. The abundance that is America's—the abundance of food, and homes, and thriving communities, as well as a spirit of hope for the future is the symbol of this prosperous and fertile land.

As Thanksgiving Day approaches, it is reassuring to reflect on this prosperity and this progress that flows across our land. Despite Russia's “sputniks,” the missile race, inflation, race tensions, the threat of war and all the other problems that plague the world, we in America this Thanksgiving can in truth be thankful for all that is ours. The abundance of good things is everywhere around us.

But what is the driving force behind this prosperity? What is the spirit that accounts for America’s plenty? It is the American tradition—the free expression of free men. This is the tradition of initiative, imagination, the ability to organize, the state of the industrial arts, and the freedom to develop one’s talents. In the words of a great Davidson professor, it is the system of “freedom for the individual, private property, and the competitive principle as the best means of achieving a good life.”

To another great man, the American System “is the product of our race and of our experience in building a nation to heights unparalleled in the whole history of the world. It is a system peculiar to the American people. It differs essentially from all others in the world.”

Hand in hand with this doctrine of true liberalism are the institutions of family and church. Lest one think that the fruits of America are the results of purely economic factors and the lust for material accumulation, let us remember that the fabric of America is woven by many forces, not the least of which is religion. A deep belief in the Creator and a conviction for the teachings of Christ are perhaps the strongest threads in this fabric. The Ten Commandments and the Sermon on the Mount have been the traditional spiritual force that directs the American nation.

Therefore, at this three hundred and thirty-first Thanksgiving, the problem of the free world is to find some way to keep all of this from being torn asunder. For as Wendell Wilkie said, “no man knows, once it is destroyed, where or when man will find its protective warmth again.”

**Wake Forest's Bunny Hopping**

Yesterday's Charlotte Observer carried a four-column photo of Wake Forest students doing the “Bunny Hop” in protest of the Baptist State Convention’s overwhelming vote to continue the ban against campus dancing. Anyone who has seen the all-new, multi-million dollar Wake Forest campus cannot help but smile at the contrast between the new buildings and the anachronistic social laws. Despite any legal social restraints, however, we have a sneaking suspicion that the Wake Forest students will keep right on dancing—off-campus, of course. And it might not be the “bunny hop.”

**Recall Election At Chapel Hill**

It is becoming almost a habit at Chapel Hill to threaten the editor of The Daily Tar Heel with a “recall election.” For the second time in three years, the student editor of the college paper has taken a strong stand against football coach Jim Tatum and his “professional” football. Both times the students have answered back with the recall election.

The University of North Carolina has always been noted for a tradition of enlightened liberalism. If this democratic spirit still prevails, there is little doubt that students will give their editor an overwhelming vote of confidence in the recall election. The DAVIDSONIAN offers its moral support to editor Bass of Chapel Hill. We respect The Daily Tar Heel as one of the foremost college papers in the country. Using the University paper as an example, we must not forget that the only obligation that any newspaper has to its readers is to print the news with fairness and accuracy. The Daily Tar Heel has done this. On the other hand, the editorial page—by right—should reflect the sincere convictions of the editor. This is the one place that he can say exactly what he thinks. A good editorial will not embrace the wishy-washy policy of echoing only the popular issues. As it looks from here, the only legitimate charge against the editor of The Daily Tar Heel seems to be that he said what he thought.

**Thanks For Preparations**

Freshmen entering the gymnasium on Friday night for their first college dance will wonder at the metamorphosis that has taken place. Mentally, if not vocally, they will observe that “we never realized that the gym could look so good.” The decorations will relegate to a minor position in the mind the many weary P.T. classes held on the same spot.

The Interfraternity Council, under the leadership of Bob Jones, has spent many hours in planning this dance. Furthermore, this council has worked hard to ensure a more economical weekend. In addition, expressions of gratitude should be given to Jimmy Jones for his task as head of the decorations committee. Last month this group was in the final stages of its work only to be told that there would be no dance. Using whatever materials they could from those left over from the “first Homecoming,” this committee again set out to decorate the gym. Thanks are due also to Mrs. Boyce Moore and all of those who assisted her in the sometimes tedious task of providing rooms for the girls when they arrive. It is a unique privilege to have a dormitory prepared to welcome the dates.—G.L.W.

**Boy, What Fun!**

By ANDY BLAKE

I'm new here, Class of Sixty-One you know, I'm just a bit excited about my first dance weekend. From what I've heard it should be about the most fun that has ever descended upon my young life. I’ve had a few problems getting ready for the big affair, but everything is straight now and nothing could go wrong this late (It’s Thursday night).

**HOMECOMING**

I had a date with the prettiest girl in my hometown in Arkansas for what was to have been Homecoming Weekend. When the influenza epidemic became bad enough to cancel the weekend’s events, I wrote her a letter, but her plane had already left when the letter arrived. I wasn't expecting her, therefore no one met her at the airport. I don’t know how she managed to reach Davidson. I think she was rather disappointed to learn that the dances had been called off. I had flu and didn’t get to see her much, but I was able to get a professor to keep her for the weekend (she couldn't stay in Belk, of course). Everything would have been just fine, but she caught flu and missed her plane home. She couldn't get a later plane, but luckily we got bus reservations for her trip back to Arkansas. She’s not going to be able to come back for this weekend.

When I found out she couldn’t come I was pretty miserable, because I don’t know very many girls. At this low ebb in my existence my big brother rescued me. You see, he is pinned, and his girl is a freshman hall counselor at a college not far from here. There's a girl on her hall who doesn’t have a date, and she’s supposed to be very cute, with a good personality and all the girls like her. I believe that she'll be a wonderful date. For a while I was afraid something might go wrong again, but I’m sure nothing will happen this late. This is my first college dance (I believe I said that), and I’m very happy about it. I hope my tuxedo will fit. “What?”Oh good, it's probably from home.” Excuse me, I have a long-distance telephone call.

SENIOR Sidetracked.............. By Bross

Charlie Brown and Violet have gone to the dance weekend. They will not appear in this week’s DAVIDSONIAN because, they said, of more important things to do. Charlie asked that we give all Davidsonians his best wishes for a wonderful weekend.

AT THE BLOODMOBILE
FRIDAY, DEC. 13

COFFEE BREAK
Adam, Eve: Schopenhauer
By BOB JONES

Being a dance weekend perhaps it would be well to report the conclusions of a recent coffee break which dealt with co-eds, dates, sex, sin, etc.—slightly edited of course.

COMMON DILEMMA
The common dilemma, it seems, in the dating world is that those whom you would like to date don’t want to date you, whereas those who want to date you, you don't want to date. In addition, those whom you would like to date, are those who are impossible to arrange a date with. This, it was decided, narrows the field of compatible dates considerably. Further, it seems that among college males it is rather common to take a somewhat Schopenhauerian view of the college female.

HAVE GUN
When one spends an entire evening discussing trivia and the unfortunate love troubles of some mutual friend, it often comes nostalgically to mind that perhaps the old Saturday night TV club isn't so bad after all—what girl can match one cool evening of Paladin in “Have Gun, Will Travel?” But then, after one Saturday evening of faithful attendance in the club, followed by the rather exotic details of the escapades of a more widely traveled brother, one stops to consider that maybe there's more to this dating angle than meets the eye.

ADAM & EVE
After all, it’s been going on ever since Adam and Eve (that's not eating apples, brother) and seems pretty well established by now. And in the final analysis who's to be a non-conformist at Davidson? So off again to a new girl's school the next weekend. Being a higher class school, we find more personality and intelligence with the trivia—but trivia nonetheless. There's a new pair to feel sympathy for because of their all too tragic love troubles, but how nice it would be to be watching Paladin with the brothers.

SCHOPENHAUER
For one must realize, as Schopenhauer so candidly pointed out, all this is but the expression of the terrible will to live, and with true collegiate pessimism we know life is not worth living. But for the time being (being this is the time for being a time-maker) may the loyal coffee breakers and TVers relax all skeptical inhibitions for the duration of the gala Homecoming (flu-ized) weekend. For although life isn’t worth living, it’s only lived once!

Senior, Frosh Look Forward to Dance Weekend
Don't Bother, Son
BY A SENIOR

Call it weekend satiety, call it impotency, call it creeping middle age at twenty-one. In fact, anything you like, but I’m sick and tired of dance weekends.

PINS & PERFUME
For longer years than I like to remember, I've dutifully moved out of my pleasant abode in the depths of Belk dorm and with very little profanity made my nest in the corner of some Freshman's room, right there with the dirty shorts and spilt shoe polish. And I have moved back to bobby pins in my bed, perfume in the medicine cabinet, and on special weekends, female attire left in my sock drawer. This thrice yearly trek I have made so that my friends and classmates, and I suppose myself, could enjoy the pleasures of female company for a weekend. It’s not at all clear to me just why I go through with this so often, but with the herd I live, so with the herd I join frantically in two days of idol worship for the ID.

With these things in mind, I look forward a bit apprehensively to the weekend at hand. I've got a date, I think (bitter experience in the past has taught me not to be too dogmatic on this issue), and if she arrives, the usual living breathing southern drawling female thing that comes at times like this, I plan to do the things that are always done. We will stand in line at the boarding house for cold ham and a smile from the house mother. We'll go to the dance, arriving late so as not to get there when the freshmen do, we'll find the music totally undanceable. Later in the evening she'll surmise that we ought to find some nice quiet place to talk “away from all this noise.” Still later, trembling lips will no doubt ask me what I plan to do when I graduate. With one hand on my pin and the other on my pocket book, I'll either kiss the lips to quiet them, or if she seems to be the really serious type, I'll yawn and comment on the late hour.

On Sunday, I hope to cop the fraternity prize for getting rid of my date at the earliest hour (An award that I have won for the past three dance weekends). On Sunday afternoon I'll have a pledge move me back to Belk, and late that night I'll lay snugly in my bed, content in the fact that the thing can only happen a couple more times to me.

STARRY-EYED
I certainly wish the very best to the freshmen for whom this will be a new experience, and also to the starry-eyed ones among us who are in love. These times are made for people like that. But for me, the weekend will be a success if I keep my pin, don’t spill anything on my tux, and get eight hours sleep both nights.

ON CAMPUS MOTTOES REQUESTED
By PHIL LEWIS

Tom Watts has been livening up the atmosphere in the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Room right across from the single room in East Dorm. It seems that he has doubts as to the good aims of those who enter, and he has placed several signs about enjoining a straightforward approach.

MOTTO
Speaking of signs, someone left a printed placard in our room the other evening warning “WHEN IN DOUBT, DON'T!” Anyone else caring to contribute other suggestions for mottos using this basic principle, please give them to us, and we'll attempt to get them printed in the near future.

We'd like to avail ourselves of the opportunity of speaking to the girls down here for the dances, and extend a hearty welcome to both of you. Sorry so many of the boys had to be away at the Duke-Carolina Game and such, but Bob Jones and the Interfraternity Council are to be congratulated on their planning and execution of this project.

MODERATION
Since we're in such a congratulatory mood, we'd like to congratulate John Trask on his splendid editorial of last week. In a time when excitable tempers and obvious bigotry are the order of the day, it’s wonderful to hear the voice of moderation and toleration above the din.

When in doubt...

News Briefs
(Ed. Note: A weekly run down of world news sponsored by the International Relations Clubs.)
By HUGO MISLE

French Walked out of NATO Meeting. In protests because of the U. S. and Britain’s airlift to Tunisia, the French walked out of the meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Allies, and lodged strong protest in Washington and London. France fears that the arms would end up in the hands of the rebels fighting French troops in Algeria, a neighbor of Tunisia.

India and Egypt Get Aid From East and West— U. S. and Russia are competing in financial loans and aid. Last reports are that Egypt was given $600,000 by the U. S. and hoping to secure a loan from the Soviet government for $200 million for economic development. Neutral India secured from the Soviet a new loan for 126 million to provide a heavy machinery factory, and mining equipment, a power station.

Self-Rule for Jamaica.—Another British colony started on the road to independence when last week Jamaica achieved a measure for self-government. Jamaica is the first West Indies colony that has achieved this measure.

The Baptist: NO College Dancing — The delegates to Baptist State Convention reaffirmed a ban on dancing at Wake Forest and Meredith Colleges. Spokesmen for the Trustees of the two colleges argued quietly and earnestly that dancing was an accepted social activity. The opposing ministers pictured it a simple moral issue.
