__THE DAVIDSONIAN__

**Frontcourt Players’ Skill on Exhibit**

With dominant rebounding and potent shooting, the men’s basketball team finished their exhibition season in convincing fashion, defeating the Charlotte Royals 91-58. Multiple runs by Davidson defined gameplay from the opening tip-off to the end of regulation. The Wildcats took advantage of the Royals’ slow start, jumping out to an early 16-3 lead on baskets by all five starters. Coach Bob McKillop’s team never looked back, consistently maintaining a double-digit lead. Shutting down the Royal offense in the second half, Davidson looked unstoppable as they went on a demoralizing 32-6 run.

The ‘Cats shot over 51 percent for the game, highlighted by the interior play of Stephen Marshall and Chadd Holmes. Marshall shot a near-perfect 7-8 from the floor, including two from behind the three-point arc, to end with 16 points. Holmes pitched in 13 points with strong ball-fakes leading to easy layups underneath. Holmes was not afraid to take it outside either, hitting on his lone shot from twenty feet. Senior guard Ali Ton noticed Holmes' intensity. “He shot the ball well and showed a lot of poise.”

This year’s team again proved competent at sinking the long-range bombs. Six ‘Cats players connected from beyond the arc. The outside game prevented the Royals from double-teaming the ball in the post. “It’s difficult to cheat on the ball when six guys are making three-pointers,” McKillop said.

But the Wildcats did more than shoot the ball effectively. Led by Emeka Erege’s 10 rebounds, Davidson pulled down 57 boards to the Royals’ paltry 23. In fact, the Wildcats grabbed more offensive boards than the Royals could accumulate on both ends of the floor combined. “We are real pleased with the rebounding effort,” McKillop said. “Emeka had 10 rebounds in 23 minutes. That’s impressive.”

The 6-4 Erege, although smaller than the typical forward, showed his ability to get the loose ball in the paint. He appeared more confident crashing the glass underneath, effectively tipping the ball out to the guards for second-chance points. Erege, who suffered a traumatic leg fracture last year, is impressing his teammates with a strong post-surgery recovery. “He’s aggressive and he’s getting there,” said captain Ton. “With more time, he will definitely be back to where he should be.”

Unlike the game against VASDA, Davidson could not find a handle for the ball and committed a shaky 21 turnovers. Heading into the Duke game, McKillop knows how important ball control is to an effective offense. “We have to cut down on the turnovers. We can’t have so many.” Yet the turnovers seem to be the only blemish from Thursday night’s game as Davidson’s defense suffocated the Royals' offensive efforts, forcing quick, impatient shots. The Wildcats held Charlotte to 35 percent shooting for the game. Charles Wittman led the Royals with 17 points on 7-21 shooting.

**Landis gets it done**

By Mike Anderson, Sports Editor

Head football coach Tim Landis has never been one to shy away from tough decisions. But then again, who could blame him? His always seem to pay off.

In 1989, while head football coach at Morrisville High School in Morrisville, Pennsylvania, Landis chose to cross a picket line of striking teachers in order to field the school’s football team. Ostracized by his striking peers, Landis endured the silent treatment from the teachers at the school. But he delivered a remarkable 8-2 record with a diminished roster of only 26 men.

In 1991, he left his position as director of athletics, head football coach, and head baseball coach at Morrisville High. For what? A job as a restricted-earning coach earning “chicken feed” at a Division III football school that had won but 21% of its games over the previous decade. Only two years later, at the tender age of 28, Landis assumed the helm of that Davidson College football program.

Five years into his tenure, Landis was faced with another tough decision. He had built a solid foundation for a winning football program at Davidson, but greatness seemed to be just beyond reach. So the summer before 1998, Landis and his staff injected new life into the squad by installing a new offense and mixing up some personnel, especially on the...Defensive side of the ball: A record-setting season is testament to Landis’s tough call paying off. Again. On the field, Landis has shown an affinity for athletic competition since his youngest days. His father explains, “He started playing youth football when he was six. It was interesting because the only league in our town was run by the Catholic Church, and you had to be a member of the Catholic Church to participate, and we were Protestants. But Tim used to go to their practices every day, and the coaches got special dispensation from the Catholic Church for him to play. He was only six years old, but they liked what they saw.”

Young Tim continued to participate in competitive athletics through the college level, where he starred as a quarterback and pitcher at Randolph-Macon College in Ashland, Virginia. His passion for athletics would carry him far beyond his college days. “I always knew he would end up in coaching,” reflects the elder Landis. “He was born to be a coach. He was a tremendous competitor and he loved athletics.” Tim’s father attributes much of his son’s success as a football coach here at Davidson to his experience as a scholar-athlete at Randolph-Macon, “There’s no doubt about the fact that his past gives him the ability to relate to these players.”

Sophomore quarterback Shaun Tyrance says, “Coach Landis is a well-respected guy, especially because he played quarterback himself so successfully. All of us look to him for leadership and guidance.”

Young gun. Landis was hired at Davidson in 1991 by Coach Dave Fagg. Fagg, who coached at Davidson from 1970-1973, returned for a short stint in the early 1990s to help revive a football program that had gone 4-47 over the past five years. Fagg guided Davidson to a 14-13 record before handing over the reins to the young Landis. “He was only 28 years old,” explains the coach’s proud father. “He was certainly one of the youngest head coaches in the country. Now he’s in his sixth season, and he’s had three winning seasons out of six. You have to look at his staff, too. He’s got a great staff of guys. Al Logan came in this year as offensive coordinator. Morris Starr came in and has done a great job as defensive secondary coach under Tripp Merritt.”

A coach that cares. It is often said that a good leader possesses two qualities: he is going somewhere, and (more importantly) he is able to convince others to go along with him. Unquestionably, Landis is taking this football program to new heights. But he is not doing it alone. Senior captain Tom Ting speaks for the team when he says, “We have unlimited faith in our coaches.” Wildcat quarterback Tom Dugan also praises Landis’s sensitivity to the needs of his athletes, “He’s not all about getting whatever he can out of his players, at any cost — he remembers that we’re supposed to be enjoying this experience. I don’t think all coaches are like that. In terms of just caring about his players, that’s what he’s really good at.”

Fans of Wildcat football quickly learn not to confuse Landis’s sensitivity with timidity. The fiery coach has a reputation for inspiring and motivating his men. “One thing that’s always been remarkable to me is his leadership ability,” conveys Dugan. “He’s probably one of the best motivators when speaking before a game or at half-time. His leadership ability is pretty unique, he’s so good at it. He’s good at making us believe in what we’re doing. If there’s one thing for sure, we know that he believes in what he’s doing. Even when we had bad years, we knew that he believed that we could win. That has finally trickled down this year, and got our team believing that we can win.”

A sign on Tim Landis’s door reads: “Accept the challenges, so that you may feel the exhilaration of victory.” It was no doubt a challenge to rebuild what was once a pitiful football program. But in 1998, Landis experienced the exhilaration of victory. Eight times.
