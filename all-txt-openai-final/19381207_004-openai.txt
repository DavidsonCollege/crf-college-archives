’Cat Quintet Is Optimistic As Veterans Lead Attack

THE DAVIDSONIAN

(GUEST COLUMNIST—GRAY HUNTER)

Just a few days ago I was kidding Tony about some of the things he had said in his column, so today (Friday) he asked me to be guest columnist and write about prospects for next year's football team. Under the circumstances, I couldn't back down. I must go ahead and risk getting a taste of my own medicine.

How does the pigskin situation at Davidson look for next year? Frankly, I think it is very dark; even darker than in the past two seasons. Seven lettermen are returning, and only one of these was a regular last season. There is no need to kid ourselves into believing that our coaching staff (an excellent one, too) can perform the IMPOSSIBLE! Today, football has almost become a SCIENCE, and it requires more than sheer SPIRIT to win ball games, at least against such TEAMS as the 'Cats encounter. SPEED, WEIGHT, POWER, AND EXPERIENCE constitute the main part of GRIDIRON SUCCESS, and next year we will be sadly lacking in these QUALITIES. However, Davidson supporters may rest assured that coaches McEver, Chapman, and Spearman will get the very best out of the MATERIAL they have on hand.

NEXT YEAR’S OUTLOOK

Now LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE MATERIAL. The 1938 forward wall was practically WIPED OUT by graduation. GONE are Captain Warden, Johnston, Graham, McCall, Iverson, Benfield, and Gasteiger. This means that six NEW FACES will APPEAR in next year’s line. Stocky, hard-charging MARVIN PENNINGTON will hold down his guard position with veteran letterman GEORGE RICHMOND as his running mate. Both of these boys are tough and will make up in some degree for their lack in weight. 185-pound DICK ARNOLD, ineligible for varsity competition last season, and GEORGE MARSH, star frosh linesman, will be on hand to give these two boys some anxious moments. “POSS” McLEAN, who won his D this year, seems to be the best bet for the pivot slot. FRANK CALDWELL should offer “POSS” some stiff competition.

The TACKLES will present the biggest PROBLEM. Hulking DAN CAGE and HANK BAHNSON will probably fight it out with freshmen BELL and KNOELLER for this IMPORTANT position. Although these boys are big and strong, they are a little too GREEN to be first rate. The ENDS will in all probability be taken care of by FOOTSIE COWAN and GALES McCLINTOCK, reserves on the '38 team. Both are lettermen and hard workers and should be vastly improved for the 1939 campaign. FRANK NIVEN and HANK KING, up from this year’s potent B team, should strengthen the flanks a great deal.

BACKFIELD QUESTION

The BACKFIELD for the most part will be composed of GREEN MATERIAL as BILL BOLIN and ARCHIE STEED, blocking back and tailback, are the ONLY LETTERMEN returning. BILL and ARCHIE proved their worth during the past season and are certain to bear the brunt of the 'Cats’ offensive attack next fall. In the writer’s opinion, GRANVILLE SHARPE of BEESTER FAME, along with CLAUDE HACKNEY and STAN YODER up from Coach Laird’s fine frosh eleven, are going to see plenty of action. SHARPE, who did some neat hip-shifting, punting, and passing in B squad games, will be a DANGEROUS contender for the tailback post; while HACKNEY, whose scintillating runs and consistent defensive plays for the yearlings marked him as a CAPABLE wingback. In YODER, the Davidson Coaches have WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN LACKING since the days of ED ARMFIELD—a BIG, BRUISING, (I ought to know) SIXTY-MINUTE FULLBACK. DAVE SPENCER, star tailback for the frosh, also must not be overlooked. HE is a good QUICK-KICKER and a fine broken field RUNNER.

NEED OF PASSER

The way it looks now, what the backfield will be suffering from most, OUTSIDE OF EXPERIENCE, is the LACK of a GOOD PASSER to fill the shoes of the departing BILL DAVIS. This is a grave situation too, for with a team as LIGHT as ours WILL BE, A GOOD PASSING ATTACK IS ESSENTIAL. Other men who should make strong bids for positions are: JAY BOLIN, WILLIE PHARR, FAISON, ALLCOTT, and JACK SIMONDS in the backfield, and STRANDWITZ, SPRUNT, and VAUGHAN in the line.

BACK 'CATS

The statements made above are merely my opinions based on what I have observed from day to day in practice sessions and actual games, so don’t take me too seriously. Then, too, spring and early practice always bring to the front some UNHERALDED CONTENDERS. In spite of the rather OMINOUS OUTLOOK, let’s stay behind the ’Cats and pray for some of that “GOOD FORTUNE” Wallace Wade spoke of at the D Club banquet.

P. S.—I also PREDICT that JOE McLESKEY, DICK WINTERS, and YOURS TRULY will hold down positions on the 1939 B team!

EDITOR’S NOTE: Although Gray, better known as “Black Dog,” didn't mention himself as a likely prospect for next year’s varsity team, something should be said of this SCRAPPY, LITTLE, UNKNOWN quarterback, who for UNKNOWN REASONS spent the past year on the B squad. Besides being a very EFFICIENT and WISE field general, he excels at waltzing through a broken field like a scared rabbit. GRAY mentioned something about the LACK of a GOOD PASSER for the '39 varsity but certainly he, after proving his worth in this department in B team games, will fill the slot CAPABLY. But anyway, if there is ONLY one man out there scrapping, hustling, and keeping up that old fight next year, you can rest assured that it will be “BLACK DOG.”

Frat Bowling Begins As Four Games Are Played

Interfraternity bowling started Monday with four matches being run off. The winners were the S.A.E.'s, Kappa Sigs, Pikas, and the Phi Gams.

The Kappa Sigs compiled the high score of the day in rolling over the Pikas. This team composed of Jimmy Scott, Hill Cooper, Ray Pittman, and Bob Wyatt bowled the combined score of 1,041 pins to 774 for the Pikas.

The S.A.E.’s won the closest match of the day by beating the Betas by 9 pins. This team composed of George Finklen, Lem Kornegay, Tom and Mark Cauble, and Alex Erwin garnered 884 to 875 for the Betas.

Cat Gridders Make Several ‘Myth Teams’

Johnston, Iverson, and Davis Are Honored on Various Star Squads

Three of Davidson's football stalwarts have received prominent recognition on several All-State, All-Southern, and All-American teams picked by sports writers from various papers. Most widely recognized are Bill Johnston, sturdy lineman, and Ned Iverson, end. Also mentioned several times is Bill Davis, triple-threat tailback and safety man.

Johnston has been picked at both guard and tackle positions as he has played both positions this season. Selected as honorable mention All-American on the Associated Press team and as first and second string guard on several All-Conference and State teams, Johnston has been a consistent performer all season. Particularly adept at smashing through enemy lines and snagging backs before they got underway, Bill was also a terror on offense and was used constantly to open holes in opposing lines through which Davidson “scat” backs scampered.

Iverson, who finished his third year ofVarsity ball this season as a flankman. Six feet four tall and with plenty of weight to back it up, he was used especially as a target for the passes of Davis and Steed, and the 'Cats gained much ground through his snagging ability. Bill Davis has been the used back in the Davidson lineup. Running at the tailback slot, he handled much of the running, most of the passing, and kicking. In the last department, he stood out particularly well, having an average of 40 yards per kick for the season. Besides handling the various offensive duties, Davis also played the watchdog or safety position when on the defense. These men are all seniors and played their last ball for the ’Cats against Wake Forest on Thanksgiving in Charlotte.

Grunters In Action Soon

Preliminary intramural wrestling matches were held on Tuesday of this week with a good number of students taking part. On Saturday, the regular varsity trials will be held with positions on the team at stake. Captain Joe Craver, wrestling at 145 pounds, will lead the matmen into their first meet against Winston-Salem Y next week. Freshmen prospects are high also, with several men having had previous experience in the sport. There are a number of candidates still out for the team and practicing faithfully for the coming freshmen trials. In order to be eligible for the intramural wrestling tourney, a man must have gone a year without being on the team and not having ever won a medal in the annual meet.

Every married man thinks he would be rich if he had remained single.

Cage Captain

Ned Iverson, captain of what promises to be the most powerful Wildcat basketball team in many a year, led the assault against Mill Power Supply of Charlotte with 14 points last Monday night. The rangy Floridian crashed the starting lineup his sophomore year and has been firmly entrenched at a forward position ever since. Iverson has always finished high among conference scorers.

Tipton, Maronic Placed On Dooley’s All-America

A week before Eric Tipton of Duke punted his team to its 7-0 victory over Pitt, Eddie Dooley, the famous football forecaster and commentator, who has been broadcasting weekly for Chesterfield Cigarettes, picked Tipton for the Chesterfield 1938 All-American football team. Dooley’s placing of the Duke star on his ace team was fully justified, being amply borne out by Duke’s prompt bid and acceptance to the Rose Bowl after its remarkable unbeaten, untied, and unscored-on season.

Chesterfield’s All-American football team, as chosen by Dooley and announced recently over his nationwide hook-up, is being hailed by coaches and critics as one of the most representative teams of the year. The team was chosen by Dooley in collaboration with more than one hundred leading coaches. No eleven of previous years packs more line power and scoring punch, more hard-running backs, and aggressive forwards than the team Dooley chose for Chesterfield. It is made up of eleven players all of whom have performed with rare distinction in their respective positions all season. Dooley’s team is as follows:

END—Earl Brown of Notre Dame.
TACKLE—Steve Maronic of North Carolina.
GUARD—Sid Roth of Cornell.
CENTER—Ki Aldrich of Texas Christian.
GUARD—Ralph Heikkinen of Michigan.
TACKLE—Francis Twedell of Minnesota.
END—Roland Young of Oklahoma.
QUARTERBACK—Bob MacLeod of Dartmouth.
HALFBACK—Eric Tipton of Duke.
HALFBACK—Vic Bottari of California.
FULLBACK—Marshall Goldberg of Pittsburgh.

No Game

Rival coaches “Black Dog” Hunter and Bob McClellan of Watts and Georgia, respectively, announced to their squads Monday that the annual Watts-Georgia football game had been called off because it would be impossible to secure equipment to outfit the two teams and also because the varsity playing field was not available. Watts—undefeated in this classic since 1838 (no score available for 1837)—had ruled as odds-on favorites over Georgia.

Frosh Cagers Play On Dec. 9

After a week of intensive practice, the frosh cage squad is rapidly rounding into shape for their opening game here on December 9. The squad of forty boys who originally reported to practice was cut last week to twenty, all of whom received equipment. Although the squad has been rather slow to round into shape, it appears that it will be above the usual freshman team. Some of the players are looking good so far in the elementary drills and workouts that have been held. On Monday, the first scrimmage was held with Don Bell, Ed Lucas, Jack Simonds, Marvin Sink, and Dave Spencer holding down posts on a tentative first string. These five are getting much competition for their places, however, from Bobby Carter, John Strandwitz, Bob McLeod, and several others.

It seems sort of significant that we have two ears and only one mouth.

Davidson Cage Team Opens Court Season With 67-33 Victory

Whole Squad Plays as Iverson, Cowan, Hogg Lead Scoring; Team Prepares for J. O. Jones Game Thurs. and Southern Conference

Davidson's varsity basketball team opened their 1938-'39 season against the Mill Power Supply Co. team by giving them a 67-33 beating in the Davidson gym as Coach Shepard used every man in uniform. Although the ’Cats looked ragged at times, as a whole their offense clicked well while they kept their weaker opponents well bottled up under the baskets. Leading by 33-12 at the half, the ’Cats used all their men while running up a large final score. Ned Iverson, captain and forward, led the Davidson scoring with 14 points. “Footsie” Cowan and Jim Hogg tied for second high with eleven points each. Levi of the Mill Power team led their scoring with 15 points to top Iverson’s number. Both teams committed numerous fouls, Davidson making 19 while the Charlotte team made 10. The ’Cats served notice that they are out for all points available as they completed seven of the ten free shots they were allowed. Davidson’s next game is with the J. O. Jones team from Charlotte on Thursday, which gives them two days of preparation. Soon after this game, the regular scheduled Southern Conference games will start.

Starting lineups were as follows:
Iverson—(14) R.F. Quick—(4)
Harrison—(4) L.F. Levi—(15)
Cowan—(11) C. Armstrong—(4)
Hicks—(9) R.G. McCracken—(6)
Tice—(6) L.G. Miller—(2)
