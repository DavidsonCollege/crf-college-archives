**Davidson faces Southern Conference, joins ACC**

By SCOOTER & MR. CHIPS

Wednesday night the Athletic Directors of the Atlantic Coast Conference agreed, by a 6-2 vote, to admit Davidson into the
ACC after next year. Davidson, who will leave the Southern Conference at the end of the 1987-1988 year, will immediately
become eligible for ACC championships in all sports except football. The Davidson football program will continue to play in the
Colonial League.

Davidson had been looking for a conference to play in since the Southern Conference required that the college must compete
in football or leave the conference. Publicly, Davidson’s Athletic Director, Christopher B. “Kit” Morris, had placed his hopes on the
Colonial Conference (not to be confused with the Colonial League, the First Colonial Bank, or Cologne, West Germany), but secret
negotiations had started with the ACC.

“I was confident that they (the ACC) would accept us,” Morris said, “but I didn’t tell anyone for fear of
damaging the delicate negotiations.”

When asked why Davidson was admitted into the conference, an anonymous source from Virginia said, “We wanted a school that
would help raise our academic standards within the conference. With all the agricultural schools like N.C. State and Clemson that
have low standards, we have a lot of dumb jocks on the playing fields. A school like Davidson who is
committed to academic excellence will help offset this.”

N.C. State basketball coach Jim Valvano added, “I want some new faces in the conference. Every year I play the
same people, Dean Smith, Terry Holland, Bobby Cremins, etc., and I think that it is about time for some changes.
Plus it will make the regular season more exciting, because the last place team in the conference won’t go to
the ACC tournament. Every game will count for those lower teams. The only drawback is that we will have to
share the TV revenue even more. Of course, that won’t affect my income personally, but...”

The move has relieved many around campus who feared that an independent status resulting from the Southern Conference exit would
hurt many of Davidson’s athletic programs.

“I’m very pleased about joining the ACC,” Morris said. “We will be in a competitive conference with schools that are
close enough that we can develop some healthy rivalries. This will be a good conference for us because we can
compete with these teams on an equal footing. We won’t be a perennial powerhouse but we won’t be in the
conference cellar often either.”

In general, the response of the Davidson coaches was positive.

“It will help our tennis team tremendously,” coach Jeff Frank said. “A school like Clemson will occasionally give us some
problems, but otherwise I think we should fare well in conference play.”

“At last we are going to run against some real teams,” track coach Gary Andrews said.

“Well, we will have some tough teams to play against in this conference,” soccer coach Charlie Slagle said. “With schools
like State and Clemson who are often in the nation’s top 20, and Duke who just won the national championship,
we might not do as well initially, but I can see our level of play rising to meet the challenge.
The real difficulty will come in scheduling. As you know, I like to schedule tougher non-conference games, so in two
years, we might have to play almost exclusively top twenty teams. Of course that means trips out to UCLA every
now and then.”

“What?!?” baseball coach George Greer said. “Nobody told me about joining the ACC. When did this happen?”

“I am particularly pleased with the move,” basketball coach Bobby Hussey said. “The ACC is a good basketball conference and
I think we can be competitive. This is a logical step in the team’s development. Last year we received an
NCAA tournament bid and we will hopefully go back this year. By moving to the ACC we will retain that
shot at getting a bid and will actually increase our chances.”Few years, I expect to be finishing in the top
half of the conference regularly and that means we should get bids more often. “I’m also looking forward to beating
Wake Forest, since everyone knows that they can’t win a game in the ACC.” With Davidson playing an ACC basketball
schedule, that raises the question of how large to make the new gym. Some say that 6000 seats will not
be enough. “Personally, I want the proposed gym to hold between 8000 and 10,000 seats,” Morris said. “We will need
the extra space when we play teams like UNC and State. I want the ‘Hussey House’ to be fancier and
even more quiet than the Dean Dome. All those rude noisy fans of ours embarrass me and the school and
a large gym will minimize their carryings-on. Plus, a larger sports complex will show that we have made a commitment
to excellence.”

Another question has been raised by joining the conference. Should the lacrosse team be made into a varsity sport to
steal some of UNC’s glory? If so, will the athletic department pay for those offensive T-shirts? But putting all these
small problems aside, the move seems to be a good one. “I’m very excited about playing in the ACC,” Morris
said. “The Southern Conference tried to push us around so we left and joined a better conference. We just faced
the Southern Conference.”

Driesell returns, will coach women’s basketball

In a surprise move, it was announced earlier this week by Christopher B. “I’m just a big ole kitty cat”
Morris that Davidson will reinstate women’s basketball beginning next season. Former Davidson and Maryland men’s coach, Lefty Driesell, has been
hired away from Jefferson-Pilot broadcasting to coach the team. In addition, it was announced that Driesell will also become Davidson’s
new Assistant Dean of Admissions, filling the vacancy that will be created when Jim Hendrix leaves at the end of
this year to resume his musical career.

Driesell was apparently on the verge of accepting the East Carolina men’s job when the Davidson offer came through. “It
was just too good an offer to pass up,” said Driesell. Morris said, “The hiring of Lefty as women’s basketball
coach and Assistant Dean of Admissions represents a strong commitment to women’s athletics and to athletics in general.”

Some of the non-athletic weenies on campus have protested Driesell’s hiring as Assistant Dean of Admissions, saying that Driesell was
unqualified and would be biased towards athletes at the expense of other students. President John Kuykendall defended his selection saying,
“He’s a heckuva coach and most importantly, the Trustees love him.”

Driesell denied any suggestions that the two jobs would involve a conflict of interest, saying, “I stand on my record.”
Unfortunately, due to budget restrictions, the reinstatement of women’s basketball will mean the demise of Davidson’s powerful Division I women’s
indoor track and golf teams. Golf team captain Betsy Rothschild was disappointed, but also somewhat relieved. “Last season really took
a toll on me mentally and physically,” she said, “It was a really long afternoon.”

Driesell’s fine record at Davidson and Maryland along with the fact that he had no basketball-playing daughters were major factors
in his selection as head coach, said Morris. He also lauded what he called the “bold decision to make Lefty
Assistant Dean of Admissions.” Morris said he believed that Driesell would “cut through the red tape and look past just
the numbers when considering athletes thus streamlining the admissions process.”

Driesell vowed he would maintain the commitment to academics that he embodied at Maryland. He stated that Davidson would strictly
adhere to the NCAA rule 5-1-j requiring a 2.0 average and 700 SAT for incoming athletes. Morris said, “I feel
very strongly that Lefty will fit right into our strong commitment to Division I athletics. In a few years, I’m
sure the women as well as the men will be packing fans into the Kit Dome... err, the new as
yet unnamed basketball arena.”
