**Suspected rapist escorted off campus twice**

By JIM DILLON

Myron Holler, wanted for questioning regarding a rape and murder case, was seen on Davidson’s campus twice late last term,
following several girls and entering unlocked doors in dormitories. Holler was caught in Cornelius on March 6 and was charged.
Although he was wanted in Iredell County for questioning, his previous record contains only four traffic violations.

Jackie Hughes of the Public Safety Office said Holler was reported on campus twice. Both times he was escorted off
the campus. Hughes said had they known that Holler entered unlocked rooms, officers would have charged him with first-degree burglary.
However, those violations had not been reported at the time. Officers did not know that he was wanted because Holler
used a false name. Holler apparently told police and students he encountered that his name was Doug Johnson.

According to campus police, Holler was seen on campus twice and reportedly entered both dormitories. Following the scare with Holler
on campus, signs went up all over campus, and all hall counselors and resident advisers were advised to warn people
of the possibility of his return. The arrest in Cornelius was a result of an identification from those signs, Hughes
said. “We got a lot of calls after the signs went up, but they usually ended up being pizza boys,”
Hughes said.

Resident adviser Dave Archer said Holler was probably on campus more often than the police knew about or were able
to catch him. When Archer saw Holler in a hallway one evening, he sent someone to call the police. Meanwhile,
Archer detained Holler in his room until the police could arrive. Tom Jennings of the Residence Life Office said the
only role that office played in the event was communication with the Dean of Students office and the campus police,
and to advise.

**Keck gives address for Sesquicentennial**

By NELLE McCORKLE

Yale Divinity School Dean Leander E. Keck on Thursday addressed the opening sesquicentennial convocation, which commemorated Davidson’s first day of
classes on March 12, 1837. Keck, who was presented an honorary degree by President Kuykendall, spoke on “Academe and Steeple:
Shared Vocation.”

Keck said church-related higher education must maintain a strong sense of continuity in defining the religious meaning of education, in
maintaining wide accessibility, and in stressing the need for precise role definition. This second unchanging aspect of church-related education incorporates
tension between quality and equality, Keck said. He noted the difficulty of allocating scarce funds: “By and large, the churches
have neglected the colleges they founded and have left them to find their own resources. But colleges like Davidson, which
succeeded in finding resources, were able to provide quality education. Some of the poorest college education is provided by church-related
and so-called Christian colleges because they are too impoverished to do better and too tenacious to die.”

Keck praised Davidson’s financial aid program for compensating for this narrow, shifting access. He examined historical evidence that Davidson did
not always need to overcome financially limited accessibility. “A century ago, going to Davidson cost less than half of going
to the state university; today it costs more than twice as much,” Keck claimed.

In analyzing the current role of church-related colleges, Keck asked whether...such colleges FIRST UNION Mon-Thurs. 9-5 Fri. 9-6 Main St.
Davidson Restaurant and Gourmet Boutique. Sandwiches Frozen Desserts Imported Beer Wines Cheeses Coffees Pottery would be able in future years
to remain in existence, if such colleges could be Christian without being constraining, and if individuals attending those institutions could
learn personal and public integrity. Keck answered each of these three questions affirmatively. However, he noted, “The ‘yes’ is itself
an act of faith, a reliance on what is deemed to be utterly reliable in the midst of mounting ambiguity.”

A needed approach to learning accompanies this faith, Keck said. “Throughout the humanities, students acquire the hermeneutic of suspicion, according
to which everything is to be questioned because nothing is what it seems to be — and rightly — but
rarely also acquire a hermeneutic of affirmation,” he said. Keck charged Davidson to transmit value and culture. He said, “It
was faith which created this college and sustained it for fifteen decades. It is faith that will take it forward
into the future we cannot portray but for which we can prepare by being faithful stewards today of what has
been put into our hands.”

Three alumni also received honorary degrees at the Convocation: James M. Robinson ’45, who is Director of the Claremont Graduate
School Institute for Antiquity and Christianity; J. Randolph Taylor, who is President of San Francisco Theological Seminary; and Dan O.
Via ’49, who is Professor of New Testament at Duke University. Approximately 1000 people attended convocation, including 85 seniors, according
to Director of Institutional Research Rick Love. Assistant to the President Melissa Jones said, “The student Majoring in premed? Air

people about the possibility of Hol- Jennings said little can be done to prevent this type of event from occurring
again without student help. “I think we just need to educate our residents, especially women, about locking their doors and
about who they give the combinations to their dorms to,” Jennings said. “Someone must have obviously given that guy the
combination, or he just waited until somebody else went in, and he went in behind them. They should really be
careful about that.”

Attendance tended to reflect enrollment in 1837, and since the spring awards convocation on April 24 focuses on student achievements,
I hope more students will come and be a part of the college’s 150-year history. Sesquicentennial Coordinator Rupert Barber said
of the convocation, “It was the culmination of a great deal of work by a great many people. There were
a number of students who were very much involved with the planning, who worked well, who volunteered a lot of
time, and we are very appreciative of their help in having the whole thing come off. I regret that more
students did not feel the importance of this event and hope that in subsequent events there will be increased participation
as together the college community celebrates this milestone this year.” AF ROTC 11/4537 LEADERSHIP EXCELLENCE STARTS HERE
