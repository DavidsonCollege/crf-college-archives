LEON HOWELL

Hobby. All-Conference In Spite of Sport's Writers

No one athlete has received as much recognition during the past four years here at Davidson as Hobby Cobb. For his outstanding play and leadership, he has been a topic of frequent mention in the Davidsonian as well as the Charlotte papers. And because of his national prominence in basketball, he has certainly deserved every word of it. For a boy who is at present 23rd in the nation in scoring (23 points per game average), 8th in field goal percentage (sinking a little better than one of every two shots), and 20th in rebound percentage, it seems to me to be slightly ludicrous that, being from Davidson, he may very well be left off the all-conference team. Yet unless he is extremely fortunate, this, one of Davidson's greatest athletes, will miss the honor he most deserves. On Tuesday of next week, we shall have our last chance to see the Wildcats of this year on the hardwood. Not only does the team need your support, but it is the last opportunity the student body has to pay tribute to Davidson's All-Conference athlete, poll or no poll.

Records and Such

During the past week the swimming team here at Davidson has produced two fine victories over Emory and Clemson and probably added another to the books this afternoon. Overshadowing the team feats, however, has been the individual brilliance of several performers as they shattered existing records. “Old Man River” (Tommy) has kept rolling up new standards in the 100-yard freestyle, with 55 seconds flat the latest recording. Bill Carrell, the flashy medley artist, tagged a 2 minute, 31 second tab on the sheet in the 200-yard individual medley. John Edwards lowered the 200-yard breaststroke to a new time of 2.43.8. Congratulations are due both the team and the individuals for these efforts.

Charlotte’s Colossal Coliseum

Charlotte, a city proud of a great number of things, has a perfect right to strong exclamations such as colossal when it refers to its magnificent Coliseum-Auditorium network. There are few, if any, rivals to these plants in America. The attraction of this, as well as some outstanding presentations, has apparently regenerated some sporting enthusiasm in a notoriously poor sports-supporting city. It has also furnished an outlet for Davidson students who are interested in the more polished professional events. Several students were present when Bob Cousy et al disentangled with Floyd in that classic duel. Golden glove bouts in all their rabid enthusiasm, the ice ballet, and now ice skating have drawn and will draw from here. Undoubtedly the most exciting discovery has been the introduction of ice hockey to a Southern area. Admittedly not the best brand around, its speed and roughness have made many fans here, nevertheless. There are even prospects of a league team for Charlotte in the future. With the advent of this emporium, big-time events such as the Gonzales-Trabert match tomorrow will add spice to the athletic agenda of fans here at Davidson.

The Grim Reaper

Baseball has been unusually hard hit by the grim reality of death recently. Not only has Connie Mack, the true patriarch of baseball, passed away, but such legendary figures as Honus Wagner, greatest infielder of all time, Cy Young, winningest pitcher, Clark Griffith (the “Old Fox”), Buck Weaver, and Billy Evans have passed away.

CRUSH CITADEL, 29-9

Last Saturday Davidson's wrestlers won their 3rd meet in a row by defeating the Citadel twenty-nine to nine at Charleston. The Cats, wrestling 177, was decisioned by Dzonis for Citadel's only win. Although Davidson kept control of the meet, the Cadets fought hard and well, and Pete Coleman, wrestling 123, was the only man to win by a pin. Probably the biggest surprise of the meet was given to Dzonis, Westervelt’s opponent. Westervelt was small and green. Dzonis was big and experienced. When he came out on the mat, you could tell he knew this. In a few seconds, he was flat on his back. When he got up his mouth hung a little open. He had respect. From then on he wrestled hard but with caution—caution and respect. Bill Warlick helped round out the program by wrestling an exhibition match with Schenkel, the Citadel's assistant coach.

Another indication of the closeness of the meet is the fact that there were three ties. Butch Neale tied in the 130 lb. class, along with Henry Griffin in the 137 lb. class and Richie King in the 177 lb. class. Griffin's tie was something of a surprise, as he has been wrestling well all season. Captain Rietzel Snider gave his usual steady performance and decisioned Cadet Taylor. Big Dave Regent wrestled his man into a loss and grabbed the heavyweight title for the Cats, while Lai Wright did the same in the 147 lb. class. Wright must have had mixed emotions for the Cadet coach. He wrestled at the Citadel as a freshman.

Swimmers Enter Conference Thursday; Humble Emory, Clemson as Records Fall

By TED DINGLER

Thursday afternoon, February 23, the Davidson swimmers leave to do battle in the Southern Conference Swimming Championship, held this year at Virginia Military Institute in Lexington, Virginia. The meet, which lasts through Saturday, February 25, will pit teams from most of the Southern Conference schools against each other in all the various forms of the swimming art.

As Davidson has (at this writing) no entry in the 1500-meter event, the team will not take part in Thursday's competition, but will spend part of that evening practicing in the VMI pool. Friday's events are principally freestyle, backstroke, and diving, while Saturday’s add to these breaststroke and diving finals. So far, the teams entered are: The Citadel, West Virginia, VMI, VPI, Washington & Lee, and Davidson. In past years, VMI and Washington & Lee have dominated the meet, and this year, according to Coach Hambright, the same is expected.

During the past two weeks Coach Carroll Hambright has taken two dunkings in the Davidson pool, as the Wildcat tankmen successfully started their fourth season in the water world. Coach Hambright, currently leading the swimmers to ten events in the Emory meet, as Rivers and Carrell were again the top men. Rivers repeated his performance against Clemson as he took the 50- and 100-yd. dashes. Carrell won the 200-yd. individual medley and the 200-yd. backstroke. Emory’s best showing was by Emery Schonberg, who won two of their three events: the 200- and 440-yd. freestyle. Emory also won the 400-yd. team relay. The final score was 54-30.

With only one scheduled round remaining to be played, the Betas have moved into the lead of the Interfraternity basketball race. They need only one victory over their remaining two opponents, the Kappa Sigs and Phi Delts, to win the top position. The Betas knocked the ATOs out of first place this week by beating them 41 to 32. Earlier last week the ATOs had moved into the league lead by defeating the Sigma Chis, the lone victors over the Betas. In other action this week, the SAEs overwhelmed the Independents 63 to 38. Davis was high scorer with 22 of the loser’s points. The Phi Gams, led by Sugg with 22 and Comer with 15, had little difficulty in downing the Pikas 71 to 31. Both Brooks and Pharr hit 10 points for the Pikas. Long hit for 20 points to take top honors for the Sigma Chis in their win over the Kappa Sigs, but Brewer with 22 took top honors for the game. The Phi Delts edged the SPEs by a three-point margin 38 to 35. McIntosh and Inman with 12 and 11 respectively sparked the KAs to a victory.Davidson. At the conclusion of the meet, the team immersed Coach Hambright in the pool, fully clothed. “I expect varsity records to start to fall any time now.” This statement from Coach Hambright is said in reference to next weekend’s meet with the University of South Carolina at the Davidson pool Friday afternoon.

According to Coach Hambright, with Davidson having their third successive winning season, “The reason we are not higher up in the standings is our lack of depth.” Our best wishes to Coach Hambright and the squad.

Catfish Sink Clemson

Davidson won out over Clemson and Emory of Atlanta in two meets. Carrell won the 150-yd. individual medley in 2:33.5 minutes. Carter and Hendee were high men for the visitors. Davidson took seven out of most of our opponents have been team, and finally teaches Physical scholarship-implemented teams. The team is in its best shape so far this season and has made vast and rapid improvement in the last two weeks.

BASKETBALL HOBBY COBB FOR LAST TIME
By CHARLES McGOWAN

Tuesday night will be the last chance for the followers of the Wildcats to see their team in action on their home court. The game will be with a non-conference team—the Terriers of Wofford. This game is of particular significance not only because it is the last game of the season, but also because it is the last game which the two outstanding seniors, Cobb and Harding, will be playing on the campus. We will not forget, however, that we are not playing the game for sentimental purposes but for the purpose of winning.

The team which the Cats will clash with Tuesday night is a team with plenty of power behind it. The Wofford team is known for its fast break so therefore Coach Scott has been drilling the Cats this week in preparation for their fast attack. Both Cobb and Harding will be missed by the Cagers of Davidson next year. Cobb, who has an average of 22.7 points per game, is the first student in the history of the college to break 1,000 points during his college career. Harding’s 14.6 point average proves his place of importance on the team also. The sports staff pays tribute this week to the entire basketball squad which has done an outstanding job. We take our hats off to the two boys who will be leaving us this year—Cobb and Harding.

Harding Wildcat of Week

To one of the Cats’ most dangerous threats on the hardwood goes this week's athletic honors. Ray Harding scored 31 points last Saturday night to lead Davidson to its 90 to 86 victory over the College of Charleston. Ray, in his best performance of the season, hit with consistency on both his long shots and driving lay-ups. The performance upped Ray’s total points to 306 and his average to 13.9 points a game, making him the Cats’ second highest scorer. He has been in the double figures in all except five of this season's games. Ray is a confident ball handler who always presses the opposition and manages to break toward the basket if given the least opening. His driving type of play has been a major factor in the Wildcats’ offensive game.

Ray’s home is in Marion, North Carolina where he lettered in three major sports while at high school. In basketball, he made the all-tournament team three times and also the all-conference team during his senior year. He was a member of the baseball team, and in football was selected to the All-Western North Carolina squad. A leader in his fraternity, Ray serves as the Inter-fraternity Council representative for the Sigma Chis. Congratulations to Ray Harding, Wildcat of the Week.

Coach Hambright is a native of Greenville, S. C., played football, basketball, and ran track for his high school. In 1943, Carroll graduated from Clemson with a B.S. in his career on the gridiron. Following his college graduation, Coach Hambright worked at Furman University where he was Director of the War Training Service Program. He then coached at Dalton (Ga.) High School, before moving to Columbia Military Academy. From 1946-49 he was Head Coach at Charlotte Tech High School. It was in 1948 that Coach Hambright first met Bill Dole while the two coached in the North State Conference. Coach Hambright accepted Dole’s offer and has been here at Davidson ever since. This past summer Coach Hambright worked with Chuck Clements in summer school at Appalachian. While at the North State Conference Meet, he obtained his Masters Degree.

Davidson’s standouts in the Clemson meet were Tommy Rivers and Bill Carrell. Rivers took the 50-yard dash in :24.7 seconds, and the 100-yd. dash in :55.0 seconds. Carrell won the 150-yd. individual medley in 2:33.5 minutes. Carter and Hendee were high men for the visitors.
