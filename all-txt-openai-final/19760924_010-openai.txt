Wildcat Harriers stumble

While most Davidson students were enjoying a lazy Saturday afternoon at the football game, Sterling Martin’s cross countrymen were running for their lives amid a mob of 500 runners at the annual Stone Mountain Road Race in Atlanta.

Among the teams running the five-mile course, the Wildcats finished in the lower bracket. Their overall record dropped to 0-2 as they lost a dual meet with Georgia State.

Doug Horn was one of the few bright spots for the Cats Saturday, finishing 36th in the overall contest and second in the dual meet. His time of 25:39 was a record for a Davidson cross country runner over a five-mile course.

Rounding out the top five for Davidson were Ed Anderson, George Strobel, Zack Murrell, and Jay Silver. Jeff Morrow, Tom Scott, Vasili Carperos, and Biff Umhau also ran for the Cats.

“Anderson was very impressive and Strobel, a freshman, will consistently be in our top five. Morrow, another freshman, has definite possibilities of breaking into the top five,” Martin said.

The schedule this year is the hardest Davidson has had in years. Martin says, however, “Despite our lack of depth, our team can compete with any of the teams on the schedule.”

This may be a hard year for the cross countrymen, but Martin is optimistic about the future because there is a good nucleus of runners to build on.

ED ANDERSON leads the charge as the Wildcat cross country squad trains vigorously for upcoming competition.
