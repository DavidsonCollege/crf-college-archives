### THE VOICE OF THE CAMPUS

Here’s a brand new semester, men! What are you going to do with it? Just one little suggestion for you—tomorrow never gets here. Do it now.

Now that the trustees have approved the plan for Davidson’s advent to the world of radio, we hope the faculty too will decide it’s worthwhile. That broadcasting from Chambers Auditorium would be mighty fine. What a great advertisement for the College.

Well, Charlotte “Y” showed the Wildcats a real team in that clash Monday night. The big Cats better “perk up” before Duke Blue Devils begin to prowl around the gym.

How about more quiet in the dormitories this season? Remember your neighbor may be a disciple of Morpheus and as such is entitled to his treatment.

Watch developments over London way these days, and you'll absorb some interesting knowledge about this great game of diplomacy. It is fascinating sport.

Spring football again and the familiar cry of “Down—up—Dig!” Prospects look rosy. May they stay that way. Soon we'll see Reds versus Blacks.

Wildcat grapplers didn’t turn in a very impressive performance against the V. M. I. Cadets, but they'll improve when the full squad is available, and when exams are completely forgotten. Our hand to Warren and Conway for their splendid exhibitions.

### HISTORY AT LONDON

The spirit of the great parley is the principal factor, and if that feeling of international goodwill can be maintained among all the factions represented, the way will be easier for material alteration in the armament.

A prominent English militarist advances food for thought when he says that disarmament of navies and armies is only a temporary remedy, since the war of the air will make war machines used thus far seem useless and ineffective. He advocates steps immediately to curb the accumulation of vast air navies which will exercise complete control over military operations in future years. In the light of widespread sentiment of this nature, one wonders if any real change in war strength will be effected by conferences such as the one now in session at London. Of course, promotion of goodwill is not to be underestimated, for this may be the means of satisfactory negotiations in the years to come.

### AMONG THE MISSING

It is no new thing at Davidson, or at any other college, for articles of clothing, personal effects, and books to be lost from the rooms. As a matter of fact, most students of the upper classes remember when the missing goods began to include property left in town houses. However, we do not think that Davidson’s total of things unaccounted for will exceed that of any other boarding school, and considering the somewhat disinterested attitude of the student body in general toward correcting the evil of removing roomers’ possessions, we feel that the situation is handled as well here as can be expected. Certainly, the Student Council is doing its utmost to uphold the duty laid upon it.

Carelessness on the part of many boys as they go about the campus may be advanced as one good reason why so many articles are lost and their whereabouts unknown. Men are prone to leave their slickers, books, and sweaters lying in drug stores, classrooms, or on the athletic field, and, to be sure, these things, once relinquished, are not easy to find again. A little more care could be exercised in the handling of such property, it seems to us. Maybe the proverbial “string around the finger” wouldn’t be such a bad idea for some of the “young grown old and absent-minded.”

Perhaps the greatest nuisance the student has to endure, and one which inevitably leads to trouble and expense, is this matter of extensive “borrowing.” Fellows drop into your room, pick up whatever they want, and, with all good intentions, carry it off. Probably you have to hunt all over the dormitory before you find your belongings in the haunts of your well-meaning friend. Such a practice is not to be condemned too severely, for some of it is understood by both parties, and particularly at Davidson, where the student body is unusually congenial. This fact is true, but like anything else, “borrowing” can go much too far. Why not leave a note in the owner’s room, telling him where to find his coat, his book, or whatever you’ve taken? Common courtesy and good fellowship would seem to demand that, at least.

The presence of a predatory character at Davidson cannot be denied, however, and events of the past fall testify to the seriousness of his offenses against the honor and security of students here. In the hope that robbery, finally like murder, “will out,” we urge the men in the dormitories to exercise the utmost caution in the care of their belongings, cooperating to that extent in the effort to put an end to the unwarranted departure of so much student property. The quaint old custom of locking doors might be considered among other remedies as one offering possibilities.

### VALUES IN OBJECTIVES

The man who has entered college with no idea of what his life’s work will be is laboring under severe handicaps. He will most certainly travel many useless routes. And yet all journeys are useful if carried out with a spirit and a will, but the man who doesn’t know where he is going cannot accomplish nearly so much along the route as he whose objective is well established. He has no incentive to stir up a strong will and a high spirit. If one has some goal toward which to strive, even though it be not quite the correct one, one is likely to accomplish much more than he who wanders aimlessly by the wayside.

The vocational guidance idea arose out of the utility, and even the necessity, of early determining upon some definite end. Soon the Vocational Guidance Institute of Davidson, sponsored by the “Y”, will give each man who has not decided upon his life work an opportunity and an incentive to think about his future vocation. It will also offer an excellent opportunity for men to test their previous choices of fields of endeavor.

An ill approach to the process of getting an education can cause more “blue” hours than practically any other activity or inactivity. All students now and then find themselves questioning the utility of learning a list of dates, many of which they will never see again; every student has inwardly felt, and more often outwardly expressed, his feeling that certain assignments were purely nonsensical and nothing short of laborious routine.

### LOCAL

Would-be aviators and admirers of aircraft were greatly edified by the non-stop visit of the Los Angeles last Sunday. Certain doubters shook their heads and remarked on the evident speed and size of the huge ship. Few, in estimating its bulk, seemed to realize that the altitude was considerable. When it is recalled, roughly speaking, that it is equal to, approximately, twice the combined lengths of Watts, East, and West, it is easy to understand why two hundred men must be trained to assist the Navy’s “aerial flagship” in landing.

In connection with the ease and rapidity of air travel, this column submits the following: that a number of...Small stationary “sausages” be anchored some thousands of feet above the school from which students may “holler,” while gesticulating with their thumbs, “New York”; “Liverpool”; “Baluchistan”; or even “Singapore”! And “Singapore” reminds us that we saw a movie the other night that contained no reference to “Singapore Sal,” the “Shanghaid Crew,” or the trial of “Dary Mugan.” True lovers of the cinema, it is the only theatre many of us have, have been sickened by the multiplicity with which producers continue to flood the screen with pictures, some worse and some “worser,” of the same uniform type. The above-mentioned styles were taken merely as examples. The first of the lot is generally good, but it is followed by a multitude of hybrids, few of which can give pleasure or do credit to anyone.

Admirers of Rear-Admiral Richard Evelyn Byrd have been alarmed by the recent report that his expedition is in dire straits due to the unexpected severity of weather. The Federal Government, as usual, has taken the matter into hands more or less capable, and, if some important change in temperature does not result, an investigating committee will probably be appointed. Will Rogers may have started it, but an investigating committee of the committee would not be out of place. Seriously, this column maintains that there is no serious cause for alarm. Byrd has proved his worth as an explorer, and it is surmised that the members of the party would be cared for, even at the expiration of canned heat and fuel.

Law cannot be enforced until members of judicial and legislative bodies comply with the statute in question. John W. Brady, former member of the Texas court of appeals, is on trial for his life. He is charged with the shooting and death of his stenographer, and his only possible loophole appears to be that he was intoxicated at the time. In ancient days, a host often had to eat a portion of his own food to prove that it was not poisoned. In other words, the administrator had to prove that he himself could stand the food (or rules) that he offered. The modern exception, evidently, is the bootlegger.

Will Rogers, referred to above, finds many terse comments which he can make about the naval limitations conference now in progress, in London. Rogers must not be taken too seriously, but many of his jokes are too true to be humorous. This column doubts the actual benefit to be gained by such a diplomatic meeting. It is encouraging to have the nations of the world interested in the promulgation of peace. Treaties, ratios, and scrappings interest the statistician. Midst doubtful hopes, therefore, we point to the sacred “scraps of paper” which were broken during the late Great War, and also we would mention the fact that various types of shells and gases used in this conflict had been outlawed by nations participating. Peace can never exist as long as an economic imperialism, as advocated by a major political party, dominates and seeks to control backward people who are destined to become educated.

It will be surprising to many readers to know that this column is written with a purpose. At one time it was the intention of the writer to put forth, in brief form, the more strange and unusual current events. After reconsideration, and a glance at Ripley’s “Believe It Or Not” (which we “didn’t” entirely) it was thought best to refer to the more commonly read news, most of it appearing on the front pages of the daily newspapers. Written comment on the bizarre and unique means little if the reader knows nothing at all about the event itself. The writer’s purpose is, then, to arouse speculation and opinion, not incredulity. It is peculiar that things rarely appear in the same light twice if they are seriously considered more than once.

These come down from a lack of objective. They mean that the student is going to college for no purpose, or that he has signed up for a course which he has no reason to take. An ultimate objective for one’s life can furnish much of the fuel along the way, as well as acting as a guidepost at every crossroad. But there is still another thing to be considered. Even he who has definitely determined upon his line of endeavor is frequently discouraged by its remoteness from his present studies. That is the reason that novels are divided into chapters. The chapter headings prove to be ends which are not too remote to obtain in a short time. Just so we should divide our lives up into shorter periods, with minor objectives. These objectives may be a letter in track, the honor roll for this semester, the debating team, the Reporters’ Club. These things are worthwhile because they are milestones along the route. But there is a danger that these milestones be interpreted as parking signs. Too many failures have resulted in lolling in the shadow of past achievement. Milestones ahead are the ones to center the attention on, not those behind.

F. D. MILLER.

Well, everybody is more or less whipped down from exams, so I’ll have to write a real simple plot to give everyone a rest. It’s a pity that everybody won’t get this rest. It’s rather difficult to think of a simple plot. My mother has a garden with one tulip growing right in the center. That’s a simple plot. I’m off.

SAND

You may be a whole desert to some people, but you're an eyesore to me.

Time: Dawn.
Scene: A few pyramids and sphinxes scattered at random just for a background. Also some palm trees scattered at will. And then sand, the limitless, dazzling, eternal wastes of sand. Sand, the hot, parching, arid plague—gee, I’ll be in the Chameleon yet—if it ever comes out.

Just at the break of dawn, who should come riding, riding on camel-back but Mustapha Napple, the sheik, and Few El Kann, his right-hand man. They dismounted and tied their camels, so that they wouldn’t have to walk a mile for them. They then fastened a stick of dynamite to each camel, so that if they did run away—oh, you know that old maxim “Blow some my way.” It’s a punk stick of dynamite that doesn’t blow somebody good. Then, they spread their prayer-rugs, faced Mecca, and took their bows. At this moment, a rooster crowed as a hint the dawn was breaking.

“Say, Few El,” began the good sheik, “do you know why hens lay eggs only in the daytime?”

“Why no,” asserted the right-hand man.

“Because they’re all roosters at night,” quoth the sheik.

This was the proverbial straw that broke the camel’s back, and both of the steeds went down in a heap. Our two Arabian friends now girded their burnooses about them and began to prepare breakfast. While they were eating their beans, the worthy sheik again quoth, “Gee, I wish I hadn't fired my cook, but he was too religious.”

“What has religion got to do with cooking?” puzzled Few El, who was in a quandary (not a marble quandary).

“Well,” replied Mustapha, helping his right-hand man out of the quandary, “every meal was either a sacrifice or a burnt offering.”

The boys now began to cast about for a little entertainment. “Let’s play bridge,” suggested Few El.

“No,” vetoed the sheik, “you play cornet bridge. I lead an ace and you trumpet.”

Few El pulled out his rusty saxophone and began to play an old native air. Mustapha immediately raised a window.

“I guess you know that I’ve taken up singing,” volunteered the right-hand man, laying down his sax.

“That's going from bad to voice,” sneered the sheik.

The two camel herders at last began to talk about old times. “You know, I’ve been working on a hunch for a long time,” remarked Few El, showing the hunch to the sheik.

“Dog-gone, that’s fine,” said the sheik, “you'll be a regular Lon Chaney yet unless hunchbacks go out of style.” And so the conversation flourished.

“If you mention women, I'll knock your block off,” threatened the sheik. Well, after he’d knocked his block off—but that’s another story.

“I call my girl pedestrian,” admitted Few El, “because everybody runs her down.”

“My son,” cautioned the old sheik, “remember the adage ‘Never go around with another man’s wife unless you can go two rounds with her husband.’”

Really, gentle reader, I haven’t got the slightest idea how to get my two characters off of the desert, so I'll just leave them on it and thus end my story. My, my, is there no end to this man’s genius?
