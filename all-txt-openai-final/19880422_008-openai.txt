**Baseball team loses to Furman, UNCC Wildcats not in conference tournament**

By LARRY DAGENHART

The week did not begin favorably for the Davidson baseball team as they dropped to 7-8 in the Southern Conference
with a 15-8 loss to the Furman Paladins Sunday afternoon. Ironically, Davidson outhit Furman 14-13 but self-destructed, committing nine errors.

Monday night, the Wildcats dropped to 23-19 overall with a 13-4 loss to UNCC. Trailing 5-1 after three innings, Davidson
bounced back in the fourth with four consecutive singles. Both Rob Zimmerman and Peter Hughes hit safely. Then Mikio Aoki
singled to score Zimmerman, and finally Kevin Burns singled to bring home Hughes and Aoki. Unfortunately, this was all the
scoring the 'Cats could muster for the evening. Through Monday’s game, Davidson has lost 8 of its last 11.

After a game with Lenoir-Rhyne on Wednesday, Davidson travels to Western Carolina this weekend for the final conference series. The
loss to Furman on Sunday effectively eliminates Davidson from catching the Citadel and claiming second place in the Southern Division
of the conference. Consequently, this weekend’s series with Western Carolina represents the last time Davidson will play in a Southern
Conference game.

Davidson’s number 7, Mike Holland, counters a Furman slide.

**Track team prepares for conference championships**

By BILL SMITH

Davidson’s track team participated in the Appalachian State Classic track meet last Friday, April 15th. What began as a cool,
partly sunny day in Boone, North Carolina turned into a cold, windy, and wet afternoon for all the runners, not
the weather desired for a preparation meet before the Southern Conference Track Championships. The Championship meet is this weekend, April
22-23, in Lexington, Virginia, the home of VMI.

Team scores were not tabulated in the Classic; some teams invited were East Tennessee, Western Carolina, and Davidson with Appalachian
State as host. In the men’s division, those Davidson runners who placed high were Doug Saintsing, Jeff Williamson, David Maynard,
Jay Clugston, and the 4 by 400 meter relay team.

For the field events, Saintsing participated in the javelin and threw for 146 feet, 8 inches for fourth place. And
with a hammer toss of 128 feet, three inches, Williamson finished in third place. Switching to the running events, Maynard
placed fourth in the 800 meter race by running a 2:00.65. In the 1500 meter, Clugston ran a 4:14.5 to
come in sixth place. The team of Maynard, Larry Ray, David Petranick, and Chris Fisher combined in the 4 by
400 meter relay to place second with an overall time of 3:45.72. The individual splits were 57.2, 53.3, 55.3, and
59.6 seconds, respectively.

For the women, several Davidson runners placed in the first six slots in their events. Kathy MacDonald jumped a height
of four feet, ten inches in the high jump to finish fifth; Ginny White threw the javelin 71 feet, 9
inches for fourth place; and Susan Swift put the shot 28 feet, 11 inches for sixth place in the field
events. Finishing in third place in the 400 meter hurdles was Missy Meegan with a time of 81.7 seconds. Swift
and Cathy Quinn ran second-third in the 200 meter dash with times of 29.64 and 31.86 seconds, respectively. In the
longer distances, Chelley Alexander placed sixth in the 1500 meter run with a time of 5:22; and a trio of
Davidson women finished in the top six in the 3000 meter run--Missy Willis ran a 10:55 for third, Katie Reynolds
ran a 12:06 for fifth, and Lisa Culbertson ran a 12:14 for sixth. In the final event, Alexander, Karen Kemerait,
Quinn, and Laurie Reams teamed up and ran a 5:19.45 4 by 400 meter relay, winning the race. The splits
were 74, 83.7, 80.1, and 81.2 seconds, respectively.

**A modern pilgrimage: the shrine, the big leagues**

By HAP BRYANT

Like Byron’s Childe Harold and Chaucer’s pilgrims to Canterbury, three young sojourners took up the banner of the pilgrimage several
weeks ago. However, the shrine was quite different from the European continent or the tomb of St. Thomas a Becket.
The modern shrine was Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium, home of the Southeast’s only major...league baseball team. To the journeyman baseball fan
in the southeast, this is the locale that beckons in the spring. One of the pilgrims, Anthony McCarron, began the
pilgrimage with the call, “Let’s get out of this one-horse town!” Despite his inclination to travel northward to the shrine
on Long Island to see his beloved Mets, McCarron was more than willing to accompany two Southerners on the road
to their goal. Thus began the travails of the three cohorts some two weeks ago. At the time, the beloved
Braves were 0-3. That mattered to us, but not too much. We wanted to experience that sort of rebirth that
comes with any pilgrimage. And I know no better time than in the spring.

To another of the travelers, Bruce Bacon, this pilgrimage was literally a trip home after a long winter away. A
native Georgian, he has an everlasting affection for the Atlanta Braves, a hapless team that preys on such affections to
survive. After having traveled through the rural areas of North and South Carolina and Georgia on the road to Atlanta
(that is, I-85), the big city finally came into view about four hours after departure. The pilgrims had nearly reached
their shrine, but they had to deal with other people going elsewhere over the maze of parkways in the South’s
largest city. We reached the shrine some five minutes before the festival was to begin. It is then that the
faithful can truly experience the sights and sounds of a major league game—vendors selling programs, hot dogs, and beer, little
kids with glowing eyes ready to catch a foul ball in their small gloves.

After four and a half hours cooped up in a vehicle, we were ready to let loose, particularly since everyone
on the pilgrimage hated the foes of the day, the Los Angeles Dodgers. They should have stayed in Brooklyn and
kept their hard-working image. California, Los Angeles, and Peter O’Malley inspire the ire of the easterner. Add to that ire
Kirk Gibson, acquired by the Dodgers in the winter. Finally, we reached the spot for which we had been striving
since February—Section 302, Row 4, Seats 11-14. And, in the words of another pilgrim of yore, William Wordsworth, “Bliss was
it in that dawn to be alive!” The festival began. Eleven thousand pilgrims were on hand—a mediocre showing, at best.
But it didn’t matter because we were among the crowd.

The high point of that evening (in which the Braves dropped their fourth straight) was a near-success at the ultimate
goal of the pilgrim—catching a foul ball. I, of course, had my glove ready, as Pedro Guerrero came to the
plate for the Dodgers. Some strange feeling came over me, and I remarked that I had been coming to the
big league parks for nearly 16 years and that I was due to catch a foul ball. Almost at that
instant, a ball off the bat came hurtling back toward us. But as luck would have it, it went to
a person sitting about ten seats away, who casually cupped it in his hand without spilling one drop of his
beer.

After a night’s rest, we returned to the park for the Saturday game. However, this Saturday game was special because
it was picture day when the fans are allowed onto the field two hours before game time to take pictures
with the players and coaches. What a joy for we three pilgrims—to hobnob with the “greats” of the game. Of
course, the Braves are far from great, as their current 2-11 record attests, but the opportunity was too good to
pass up. After all, we had traveled long distances to see them. Luckily, they allowed us to bring back a
little piece of the Atlanta nostalgia on film—pictures with Hall of Famer Willie Stargell, manager Chuck Tanner, and cult hero
Ed Olwine.

McCarron, Bacon, and yours truly will never forget this spring pilgrimage, a journey that put new life into winter-weary bones.
Note the look of renewal and inner contentment on the pilgrims’ faces.
