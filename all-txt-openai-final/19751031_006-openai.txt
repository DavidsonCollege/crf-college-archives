The Davidsonian October 31, 1975

The Davidson College Drama Department will kick off its celebration of America’s birthday with the student opening of George Greanias’ “Wilson” tonight at 7:30 at Hodson Hall.

Henry Cabot Lodge (Marlin Geiger) pauses for some tea in the college production of “Wilson.”

“Wilson” will be the first of a series of ‘bicentennial’ drama productions presented, as Drama Professor Rupert Barber describes it, as a “celebration of American drama.” The play deals with the crucial phase of Woodrow Wilson’s Presidency—from the entry of America into World War I in April 1917, to the inauguration of Warren G. Harding in March 1921. This, according to Greanias, is a controversial, and perhaps most misunderstood, period.

The cast includes Roylance as Wilson, Laura Rankin as Wilson’s second wife, Edith Bolling Wilson, Steve Kruger as Wilson’s personal secretary, Col. Edward M. House, and Marlin Geiger as Senator Henry Cabot Lodge. As a link with Wilson’s past, Barber added Wilson’s daughter by his first marriage, Margaret, played by Peggy Noel.

The cast has immersed itself in some of the existing published accounts and papers of Wilson. Several weeks ago, in addition, Barber, Roylance, Rankin, and Noel went to Washington, where they visited the Wilson house and talked with Wilson’s grandson for 20 to 30 minutes.

“In the view of many, Wilson was a complex and distinguished figure,” Barber said.
