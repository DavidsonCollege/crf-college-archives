**Let’s be careful to say what we mean guys—Davidson women are not “girls”**  
Lucia Kendall

I believe every Davidson woman should be called by her correct name. I am not suggesting that we all relive the freshman orientation games consisting of trying to memorize the first and last names, hometown, and hall of every person with whom we have ever exchanged a “hi”; rather I am simply advocating that women be called women. This issue comes up because I have recently broken the habit of calling female college students “girls” and have received both confused looks and questions about my word usage. I hope that this article will not only answer these questions, but more importantly that it will help other people understand the reasons for changing their own usage.

The most obvious reason for calling women “women” is that they are women, not girls. Although some may argue that college students are not yet full adults, everyone will agree that they are closer to being adults than they are to being children. Any nineteen-year-old would recoil at being referred to as “a child,” so why should a nineteen-year-old female not have the same reaction to being called “a girl”? The answer brings us to an important issue—gender. While female students are repeatedly referred to as “girls,” male students are never referred to as “boys.” “Guys,” an informal word used for adults, is normally used instead. I suspect that the reason for this difference in usage has originated in a somewhat unconscious assumption that achieving the qualities of adulthood, especially independence and responsibility, was not really as important for girls as for boys, or at least occurred later.

Sexism in language goes back as far as Adam. I recognize that the people who say “girls” are not firmly convinced that college-age “guys” are ready to dash out and take over the presidency of IBM while the “girls” should sit at home and play with their Cabbage Patch dolls. And it is for this reason, among others, that we should be careful to say what we mean. I believe that language is a symbol, and I believe that symbols influence attitudes. Therefore it is a matter of semantic integrity to try to be aware of the implications of our words and try to use the word that expresses our ideas most accurately. Accuracy should be enough of a reason to quit calling women “girls.” But there are more reasons.

**At the movies:**

As soon as you begin to view the world in shades of grey, something dramatic happens to thrust you back into reality. It, whatever it may be, makes you see that black and white do exist in today’s society. It also gives you a glimpse into one of the two worlds. For myself and a group of Davidson College students, we experienced first hand some of the injustices that go along with being black.

On October 13, 1989, at the University Place Cinema, being black meant being told, not asked, by the manager to go to the end of the line. This might not have been such an injustice if certain factors had not been true: 1) We were the first persons at the movie; 2) The ticket person had already torn our tickets; and 3) The manager treated us with a great degree of disdain. Even though we knew that our grievances were valid, we went peacefully to the end of the line. After the movie ended, I approached the manager and told him that I disapproved of the manner in which we were treated. Subsequently, I exited the movie theater.

Being black that night meant that the aforementioned injustices would be minimal to the ones that followed. Within minutes, the Mecklenburg police arrived. Four police cars came to the scene of a crime that had not yet occurred. The actual crime would be committed by the police on this particular night. The police officers...Paraded the entire group of students out of the movie theater and the spectacle began. The officers proceeded to tell me a host of things. First, I could be arrested for trespassing. Second, I was never to return to the University Place Cinema (if I did, I would be arrested, as would any other person in the group if they returned). Finally, if I was arrested, the judge would take the manager’s word over mine (the only difference between us was our color). After harassing us for approximately 30 minutes, the officers left, I guess, on their way to a real crime. I would like to reiterate that all of this happened to a group of students who had committed no crime. This was a glimpse into the world, my world, of being black.

What a great country this is! Land of the free, home of the brave, where the deer and the journalists play. The United States government is an unparalleled source of useful and, more importantly, public information for the media. Over the years, different departments within the federal government have been responsible for releasing vast amounts of data to the public. Several of them may or may not jump to mind as disseminators of information, but one that almost certainly won’t is the Internal Revenue Service. And that’s just the one that I’m here today to talk about.

All nonprofit institutions have to file what's called a 990 form to the I.R.S. each year to continue that status. The I.R.S. likes to look over the books each year. In the past, anyone wanting access to the documents had to write away to Washington to get a look at them. Often, those seeking the information heard nothing for up to nine months, only to then get a letter saying the I.R.S. had lost it. To simplify affairs and get the public off its case, the I.R.S. decided recently to make the institutions themselves responsible for handing out the information. The form Davidson College filed, with its oodles of interesting numbers, now resides in Business Manager Bob Davidson’s office.

What does this form have on it? The fiscal year 1987 (July 1, ‘87-June 30, ’88) form includes:

Investments. It includes what investment managers the college uses, what stocks are owned by the college, etc. Some interesting excerpts:
- $352,000 in Gannett Corporation stocks
- $129,623 in Liz Claiborne, Inc.
- $403,200 in Walt Disney Co. stock (some have called us a Mickey Mouse operation)
- $382,500 in Anheuser-Busch Inc. stock (an interesting item for a Presbyterian school that has had drinking on campus only recently!)

Budget breakdown. The budget in 1987-88 totaled $15,789,262 and broke down like this:
- Instruction .............. $7,915,459
- Athletics ................. $1,979,896
- College Services ......... $4,704,045 (includes the Union, Dean of Student's office, financial aid, medical services, registrar, office of the college chaplain, etc.)
- Library .................... $1,189,862

Basically, for every four dollars spent on academics, one was spent on athletics.

Salaries and expense accounts. This is the jewel in the crown. The 990 form has a Lettermanesque “Top Five” list (salaries on the left, expense accounts and other allowances on the right):
- John W. Kuykendall, President $82,000 ...$15,020
- Robert C. Williams, V-P for Academic Affairs and Dean of the Faculty $74,990 ...$4,223
- Robert Sutton, V-P for Business and Finance $78,516 ...$696
- Charles Ratliff, Economics Professor $59,600
- John Kelton, Psychology Professor $63,189 ...$1,590

These are interesting names and numbers. What's more interesting are the names not there, especially the absence of anyone from the athletic department. They’re encouraging numbers; I like the fact that the highest-paid employees are all academicians. It remains to be seen how much Terry Holland will pull down, though. The fiscal 1988 numbers come out November 15. Watch this space. And hey, welcome to my column.
