THE DAVIDSONIAN, NOVEMBER 1, 1923

Curtain! Reveries of a Bible Student
I dreamt of old Epiphinese
Who lit a mighty fuse,
And blew up all of Palestine
To Hellenize the Jews.

At the rate leaves are falling, Davidson won't be a Wildcat but a little bare.

Fresh Love says the rest of the student body is not on his level.

Yes, Andrew, a cinder track is one on which you train to burn the wind.

We suggest that watchmen’s time punchers like those on each hall be put in the shower rooms. Then we can
check up on Spooty Hillhouse.

One: “The slickest thing I ever saw.”
Two: “What?”
One: “Stacomb.”

This thing of ducking cigarettes is getting to be a foul deed.

Roses are red, violets are blue, Niagara Falls, and we do, too.

No, Christine, the annual staff is not something you lean on once a year.

Watt McCain's weekly song hit: “I don't remember her now, I'd fark.”

The Race Entrants: The Cabbage, The Tomato, and the Garden Hose.
Finals: The cabbage came out ahead; the tomato couldn't ketchup; and garden hose is still running.

Keels says that cold is the presence of the absence of heat.

Weekly Conundrum
Why is it the law doesn't jail a man for:
Killing time?
Hanging pictures?
Smothering a laugh?
Shooting the chutes?
Or murdering the English language?

Paul Steele says they don't have adding machines down in Lowryville, but they do have counters.

We would tell you the one we heard about the balcony but we are afraid it would be over your
head.

Wait! Wait! Speaking of strong men—there's a porter at a Charlotte hotel, who takes the elevator up and down from
the first to the fourth floor all night long. He ain't got nothin’ on Davidson College. They're raisin’ $600,000 in
nickels and dimes.

Foot: Jever hear the story about the stocking?
Ball: Foot: Nope, Spit it out.
Some yarn, some yarn!

To the Rear!
Be gentle with the little bee;
E’en though he has no mind;
For though dumbness bespeaks the fool,
He may be sharp behind.

March! Great Scott!
Dan: Sir Walter's greatest Ivanhoe, don't you think?
Dora: It’s fair, but oh! his Emulsion work was How I adore.

Curtain! Reveries of a Bible Student
I dreamt of old Epiphinese
Who lit a mighty fuse,
And blew up all of Palestine
To Hellenize the Jews.

A Sad Tale!
Willie: Pa’s an hrush.
Sammie: Huh?
Willie: With one stroke of the brush he can change a happy face to a sad one.

Say, are you trying to make them people think I am a fool?
Oh, no indeed. I never tell the truth when it hurts a person's character.

Musical Extravaganza
Dupe: “Speaking of musical instruments, how do you like the shoe horn?”
Simp: “What does it play?"
Dupe: “Foot notes.”

A Definition
Geyser: A waterfall which has lost all sense of direction; an aquatic stream into which has been poured a free
dose of mountain moonshine, a frisky, playful spring; a trick of nature, there's only one faithful one in America.

A funny thing’s an athlete,
When he runs it is a treat;
Of all the puns you'll ever meet,
This is the rottenest,
He runs a solid mile or more
And moves but two short feet.

Local Color
If I don't write she’s blue,
If I do, I’m white
The letters I send her are read,
If I don't beat up the guy who kissed her I’m yellow,
If I do I’ll be black and blue,
If I go with another girl she's green with envy
Or purple with rage,
How can I come out,
With flying colors?

To the Rear!March! Be gentle with the little bee,
Even though he has no mind;
For though dumbness bespeaks the fool,
He may be sharp behind.

MAGAZINE PROMISES GREAT IMPROVEMENT
(Continued from page 1)

The reason for bringing out only two issues last year was the lack of funds. This year the Business Manager,
A. M. Hurd and his assistants have been working unceasingly to secure advertising in order that they may have the
necessary funds to publish several creditable issues. It is hoped that the number of pages will reach a hundred in
some of the succeeding issues. The size of the pages is also to be increased this year. The first issue
will consist of forty-eight pages and a cover which is to be red and black design on cream-colored cover stock.

A novel innovation of this year is the Cap and Bells section, which consists of about ten pages of jokes,
pictures, and comics not to be described in a word. Cap and Bells was founded by the class of '24
last year and appeared for the first time at Junior Speaking. It was decided to combine this with the Magazine
and A. M. Martin is the editor of this department.

The table of contents will include:
The Story Teller by Henry White.
An Essay on Humor by D. B. Wharton.
Poems and Prose by J. B. Bryan.
Lilly Shields by J. B. Bryan.
Short Stories by A. M. Martin, Sharpe, and R. W. Walker.
An Evening Idyll, a poem by Caligan.
An Essay on College Education, by R. M. Carr.

SCABBARD AND BLADE BIDS CAPTAIN GEORGE H. WEEMS
(Continued from page 1)

Members of Scabbard and Blade from the Faculty are: Mr. F. Hood, Dr. J. W. McConnell, Capt. I. G. Hearn,
Capt. M. H. Ellis, Lieut. J. H. George, and Capt. G. H. Weems. Student members are: G. M. Ford, W.
E. Cromwell, J. P. Ramsay, and J. R. Gudger. At the next meeting of the Society, a paper on Commutation
of Uniforms for the R. O. T. C. at Davidson will be read by Cadet Major G. M. Ford. This
will be discussed in detail and is, no doubt, a system which would prove effective here by cutting down the
expense in buying uniforms thus making the subject more attractive as an elective. This year Scabbard and Blade has been
mostly in the process of organization but now the scholastic year of 1923/24 promises to be one of marked success.

COLORED MUSICIANS WILL REPEAT PERFORMANCE HERE
(Continued from page 1)

The Quintet always welcomes an opportunity to appear before the student body because of the attitude of Davidson men toward
the college men of the colored race and especially toward Biddle. The program will begin promptly at 7:30 in Shearer
Hall and a good crowd is expected to greet the entertainers. An admission fee of 35 cents will be charged.
