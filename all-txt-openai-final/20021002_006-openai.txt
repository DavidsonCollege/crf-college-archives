Sometimes it can be hard to picture professors having a life outside the classroom, doing anything besides sitting at home grading papers and coming up with torturous new 300-page reading assignments. On faculty websites, we’re usually told that Professor XYZ is working on a paper about the mating habits of Guatemalan frogs or a book about the political structure of the United Arab Emirates during the 1950s. But let’s face it, only a few die-hard students will ever get around to actually reading this evidence that our professors don’t just sit around and plot ways to torpedo our GPAs.

All this rambling does have a point: the Faculty Art Show, which is now entering its final week, is an accessible way to see what some Davidson professors have been up to in their non-Davidson time.

Students who’ve already taken a few art classes may be familiar with Herb Jackson’s striking acrylic abstracts, Russ Warren’s intriguing oil-on-panel paintings, and Cort Savage’s sculptures. Works by all of these professors are currently on display in the Van Every Gallery (to the left as you enter the VAC).

The Art department has chosen to showcase visiting assistant professor Ray Kleinlein’s still-life paintings in the Smith Gallery, just across the hallway. The paintings on display there all portray ordinary items, like perfume bottles and a garden hose, in striking detail. Charlotte Observer art critic Richard Maschal gushed in his review, “[Kleinlein’s] paintings of everyday objects are refreshing and marvelous.”

The faculty paintings are on display in the VAC through October 9, 2002.
