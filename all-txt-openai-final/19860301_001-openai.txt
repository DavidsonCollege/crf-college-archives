**Wild ROTC Ball trashes Commons**

By S. KALASHNIKOV

What began as a “ragin’” military ball in the Commons last Saturday night had, by early Sunday morning, turned into
a large nightmare for the men of the Davidson ROTC.

Campus Police Officer James Bean, hired by the ROTC to sit around and look official, said that at about 1:05
a.m. he “noticed the crowd was getting a little rowdy.” He said, “Even though they’d all left their rifles at
the door, I was getting a little nervous.”

Bean said that “at about 1:50 a.m., a fight broke out. One of the eating service workers made some off-color
remarks about military spending, and about five ROTC men converged on him, shouting, ‘Build the B-1! Build the MX!’”

Bean stopped the fight, then analyzed the situation for about five minutes and decided to close the party. “There were
students rappelling off the walls and flashing ‘Rambo’ knives. Two or three international students were torn up. I decided that
if I could keep anything else from being damaged, I would.”

Paintings by art professor Herb Jackson, some of which have been valued at more than $4, were also hanging in
the Commons during the party, and Bean feared that the paintings could be damaged. “I didn’t notice it until Herb
told me,” Bean said, “but the ROTC members turned all his paintings upside down. I don’t think any of us
could tell the difference.”

Members of the ROTC were enraged when Bean and other officers “turned off the lights and told everyone to go
home,” as one student described it. “Commies!,” he said.

Bean and the other officers called President John Kuykendall to the scene as a part of standard operating procedure. While
Kuykendall was looking at the condition of the Commons, someone reported to Bean that his Cushman Police scooter, which was
parked directly in front of the Commons, had been turned on its side, shot full of 9mm holes, and hit
with a Light Anti-tank Weapon (LAW).

Bean stepped outside and apprehended a suspect, junior ROTC member Will Travell. Travell confessed, exclaiming, “No really — I swear
I thought it was a T-72!”

It was first reported that several thousand dollars’ worth of damage had been done to the Cushman, but later it
was indicated that damage was estimated at around $50. “Cushmans are cheap. Real cheap.” explained Bean.

“I have no intention of second-guessing the police — I appreciate their efforts to keep the boys under control,” said
ROTC commander Arnold Schwarz as he polished his .45 automatic. “Kuykendall, however, is another matter. Commie!”

Schwarz said, “We wanted to have the ball out in the field, but Warner Hall was having its ‘Hayride to
Hell’ and they charred all the grass. Also, it’s pretty damn difficult to dance in a pup tent.”

**Infirmary nurses annex Union**

By BEN SICK

In a surprise move last night, infirmary nurses annexed the Union to bed surplus patients.

“I got tired of telling students ‘there’s nothing wrong with you — go back to class,’” said one nurse, who
wished to remain anonymous.

Some, “exhilarated by success,” suggested long-term plans. “The 900 Room is a great place for the nurses to swill a
little beer after shifts and catch up on the soaps. Our favorite is General Hospital. Their harrowing experiences on that
show make us thankful to be at Davidson.”

Another echoed her thoughts, “I’ll put on band-aids and dispense medication but I ain’t birthin’ no babies.”

Dean of Students Will Terry told The Davidphonian that he was glad the infirmary was taking positive action on behalf
of the students’ bodies. “A lot of students have been sick, but no one will agree to cancel classes. Maybe
this move will force the rest of the administration to realize the seriousness of the situation and take immediate action.”
In a letter to faculty and staff, Terry said “What’s happened to students’ attitudes? I’ve been sick for two weeks
and only missed one day.”

Lame-duck Union President Rob Vaughn was also pleased with the coup. “This [small nightmare] will guarantee that students are in
the Union 24 hours a day.”

Incoming Union President Lucinda Kellam had mixed emotions about the crisis. “I was really anxious to try out my slogan
‘Sell’em with Kell’am.’”

On the bright side, Kellam said the act will resolve Vaughn’s apocalyptic vision of the oncoming drinking age change. “It
will help me to program well enough so that people will be able to drink,” although alcohol will be served
on the wounds, she added.

Games Committee Chairman Sloan McAllister said, “I was kind of worried at first that we couldn’t have any parties. But
these nurses are great. They can really dance and they love to drink beer.”

Some were not as pleased, however. WDAV was forced to move earlier than anticipated. “The music’s moving,” Station Manager John
Clark said, “we just don’t know where yet. Our new building remains unfinished, kind of like Beethoven’s Ninth.

“We considered the Commons, but when it went up in smoke, so did our plans. Now we think we’ll just
open a house on the court until our new facilities are completed.” He emphasized that they will not participate in
self-selection during their brief stay, however.

SGA President Beadsie Woo said, “What? Takeover? Since last Tuesday? I only go there for Tuesday Evening Club to write
mind-bogglingly dumb jokes into minutes that no one reads.”

Some important Union people.
