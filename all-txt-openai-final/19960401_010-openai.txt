**The Realities of Rape at Davidson Hide in the Silent, Bucolic Atmosphere That Defines the Campus and Blinds It to the Pain of Uncounted Women.**

When I came to Davidson, I was already familiar with date rape. I personally knew several girls in high school who had been raped. Also, I had classes with rapists and had to listen with disgust to their gloating. So when I came to Davidson, I expected more of the same; I was pleasantly surprised. Date rape is not lunchtime gossip anymore. But it would almost be better if it were. Most people I talked with don’t know and haven’t heard of anyone who has been raped at Davidson. Is rape really a problem at Davidson?

“I wouldn’t know,” says freshman Michael Miga, echoing around ten others I asked. “No — well, I guess so. After hearing the stories at Take Back the Night, I’d have to say yes. But I don’t think that it’s Davidson students we have to worry about ... it’s people from off-campus,” says sophomore Amanda Moore.

Even the Counseling Center is not sure how much of a problem rape on campus is. Because there is no central record of reports, the rapes brought to a counselor’s, a dean’s, or a faculty member’s attention go largely unnoticed. The numbers are never consolidated or recognized.

“We’ve only had one official report of rape to the Board of Sexual Misconduct this year,” says Assistant Dean of Students Leslie Marsicano. “It’s hard to encourage people to come forward.”

“Five or so is normal for us this time of year; but we know that is just the tip of it. We are currently working on programs to promote reporting, awareness, and prevention of date rape and sexual assault,” says Counseling Center Psychologist DeWitt Crosby. “We want to maximize choices. But when we don’t know what we’re working with—how many or what kind of situations—it’s hard to know how to handle,” reiterates Marsicano.

Besides shame, fear of being forced into an unwanted legal situation, and just not knowing who or where to turn, ignorance of the definition of rape is another reason for the lack of reports. “I think a lot of girls don’t realize that what has happened could be called rape. Especially when alcohol’s involved, I think people just feel horrible in the morning and never think about calling it rape. But a lot of times, that’s what it is,” says Junior Morgan Todd.

So what exactly is “date rape”? “Well, it’s tricky to define,” says Crosby. Indeed.

**From the Procedure for Responding to a Victim of Rape or Sexual Assault**

Davidson Campus Police and Davidson College Student Health personnel are prepared to respond to a victim of rape or sexual assault, although Assistant Dean of Students Leslie Marsicano is most often the contact person for students. The Campus Police Office and the Infirmary are staffed 24 hours a day. The Counseling Center staff provides emergency service at night and on weekends. Call 559-3676 to page their beeper.

*Because of the Federal Campus Safety Act, anyone not protected by professional confidentiality is now required to report all rape cases to the police. Protected staff include Counseling Center Psychologists, the chaplain, resident advisors and hall counselors, Georgia Ringle, and Dean Marsicano.*

**From Part III, Section H, of the Code of Disciplinary Procedure**

**Options Regarding Sexual Misconduct**

Prior to filing a formal complaint regarding Sexual Misconduct (as defined in the Code of Responsibility), a student who is considering filing a complaint may confer with a member of the Dean of Student’s Office to determine the availability of the following options:

a. To make criminal charges against the accused. The Dean of Student’s Office will provide assistance in filing such charges should the student so request.

b. To have the sexual misconduct complaint adjudicated by the Sexual Misconduct Board.

c. To have the accuser and the accused resolve the issue in conversation between themselves with members of the Dean of Student’s Office present. If the accuser chooses this option, the accuser waives the right to have the issue adjudicated by the Sexual Misconduct Board. The accused must be warned at the outset that (a) although the accuser has waived the right to have the issue adjudicated by the Sexual Misconduct...Board, anything he says may be used against him in disciplinary proceedings; and (b) that anything he says may also be used against him in any criminal proceedings, though the college will as a matter of policy seek to claim evidentiary privilege in respect of communications with its students in disciplinary proceedings.
d. Other options such as counseling, rearrangement of class schedule, etc.
e. To take no further action.

“Date-rape” is not listed in the 1980 New World Dictionary, but it lists rape as “the crime of having sexual intercourse with a woman or girl forcibly and without her consent.” The New Our Bodies, Ourselves: A Book by and for Women, says, “Rape is any kind of sexual activity committed against a woman’s will. Whether the rapist uses force or threats of force is irrelevant.” According to Section V of the Code of Responsibility, “Rape is forced sexual intercourse that is perpetrated against the will of the victim; it occurs if one person uses force or the threat of force to coerce another, regardless of the relationship existing between them. In acquaintance or ‘date’ rape, the assailant may be a casual acquaintance, classmate, date, or significant other.”

Considering that most date rapes involve alcohol, it is intriguing that “the threat of force” is a necessity for prosecution and that the ability of the victim to say “no” is not. The definition limits the situation to attacks, when often victims are not coherent enough to offer a struggle or refuse even verbally — at Davidson, principally because of alcohol and drug abuse, but off-campus, mental retardation is also a factor. “I know someone who was so drunk she couldn’t speak or move and was in and out of consciousness while he [had sex with] her,” says sophomore Adrienne Nixon. “That’s still rape ... Rape is more of a problem here than anyone is willing to believe.”

Fern Davye transplants audience

Tuesday evening Fern Davye gave a poetry performance in the 900 Room. Fern Davye travels about 250 days each year reciting poetry at colleges and universities around the nation. Instead of reading her own poetry, Davye recites the poetry of about 95 modern-day poets from around the world. At each performance, Davye performs several poems from her collection of over 500.

Davye began her performance by walking around the room looking every person in the eyes. She then invited us to imagine that we were all attending an intimate dinner party at her villa in the middle of a forest in New Mexico. After a dinner of fine garlicky pasta, she led us outside to admire the red rocks and recite and discuss poetry. By creating this illusion of being transplanted from the 900 Room to her home in New Mexico, Davye created a more intimate atmosphere. This new atmosphere was more like a conversation between dinner guests than a poetry lecture where the audience and performer are separated by a stage.

Davye does not just read the poems mechanically. In the course of the poem, she becomes extremely animated. Her movements and voice are essential to her performance. She jumps around, yells, whispers, and gets in her audience’s faces. Her deep guttural voice was perfect for producing harsh, barbaric growls as well as the most intimate whispers.

The more provoking poems that were recited were two of Pablo Neruda’s Cien Sonetos de Amor, Spanish for One Hundred Love Sonnets. Apparently, Pablo Neruda presented his wife with a sonnet proclaiming his love for her every day for the first hundred days of their marriage. Fern Davye recited the eleventh and twelfth sonnets. After reading the eleventh sonnet, the crowd demanded that she recite the twelfth. After the twelfth, she discontinued the series much to the dismay of several audience members.

One of the most intense poems of the evening was one in a series of eighteen entitled Eighteen Elegies for Roger by Paul Monette. Davye recited the final poem in the series. The entire set of elegies describes how Roger, Paul Monette’s lover, died from complications by AIDS. Paul Monette wrote the eighteenth elegy as Roger died. This poem describes the feelings of the author — denial and love for his departed lover — and sorrow that his friend had passed away.

Fern Davye greatly entertained the small crowd that had gathered to see and hear her perform. Her animated gestures and recitations thrilled the crowd and left them desiring more poetry.
