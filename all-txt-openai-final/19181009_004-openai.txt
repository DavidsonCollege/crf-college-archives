Davidson College has added to her

LIBERTY DAY.

Saturday, October 12, is the four hundred and twenty-sixth anniversary of the discovery of America. President Wilson has proclaimed it
Liberty Day and requests the citizens of every community in the United States—city, town, and countryside—to celebrate the day.

The President, in his proclamation, says:
“Every day the great principles for which we are fighting take fresh hold upon our thought and purposes and make
it clearer what the end must be and what we must do to achieve it.

“We now know more certainly than we ever knew before why free men brought the great Nation and Government we
love into existence, because it grows clearer and clearer what supreme service it is to be America’s privilege to render
to the world.”

Lieut. J. C. Paisley, ’17, a graduate of Davidson College and commissioned at Oglethorpe, gave his life for his country
on the afternoon of June 21. As a Davidson man, he was loved by all his fellow students, and every
one of them will be very sorry to hear of his death. We will always feel that Lieutenant Paisley was
loyal and true to his duty, but regret that he was not spared to live longer.

Maj. W. G. Langwill, in a letter to Mr. Paisley, the father of Lieutenant Paisley, says: “Your son was an
excellent soldier, a beloved comrade, and a born leader. In his first and only battle, he led his men like
a veteran, was skillful, brave, and successful. He gave his life in the performance of his duty and I shall
always feel that his spirit is with the regiment to encourage the rest of us to ‘carry on.’ The battle
began at daybreak and by noon the company was consolidating a trench system. Shortly after that, with his superior officers
shot down, Lieutenant Paisley assumed command of his company and pressed a gallant attack. The attack was rushed in the
face of terrific fire. One German officer, dressed in American uniform, rushed toward Lieutenant Paisley, calling on him to stop
firing on his own men. Your son at once shot and killed the Boche and the fight continued. That afternoon
Lieutenant Paisley fell a victim to a cannon shot, death being instantaneous. He was loved by his men and associate
officers. His body was carried back and buried in rear of his command, while German artillery sounded the funeral march.
The enemy artillery fire was most violent, but a brief funeral service was held at the grave.”
