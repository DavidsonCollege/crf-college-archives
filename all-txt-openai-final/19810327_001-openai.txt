Head Basketball Coach John Kresse resigned last Wednesday, one week after accepting the position. Kresse, the ninth Davidson basketball coach in the past 12 years, is the third coach who left without coaching a game. He had replaced former head basketball coach Eddie Biedenbach, who was fired on March 1.

Assistant Athletic Director Tom Couch declined to discuss Kresse’s departure. “He came to us at one last Wednesday. That’s all I have to say on the matter.” Athletic Director Gene Bingham was in Florida and not available for comment this week.

Kresse is returning to the College of Charleston, where he has been head coach the last two seasons. Kresse said he decided to leave Davidson after meeting with his College of Charleston players last Monday. “Emotion I felt after meeting with my players was what made me second guess my decision,” he said. He added, “I’d spent three days seriously (See page 10)

Bobby Hussey became Davidson’s new Head Basketball Coach last Thursday. He was formerly the coach at Belmont Abbey College, where he compiled a 178-115 record in ten years. Hussey replaced former Head Coach John Kresse who resigned last Wednesday after holding the position for one week. Kresse had replaced former Coach Eddie Biedenbach, who was fired on March 1. Hussey is the College’s tenth head basketball coach in the last twelve years.

The College considered Hussey for the job when it dismissed Biedenbach, according to Davidson Sports Information Director Emil Parker. Hussey said that he had been looking for an opportunity to coach a Division I team, and is very excited about his new job. He plans to concentrate now on recruiting and working with the players on a personal level. His goal, Hussey said, is to win the Southern Conference Championship. “Positive think- (See page 10)

SGA hopefuls voice differing aims

Juniors Stuart Dorsett and Chip Legerton are running for SGA president in next Tuesday’s election. Both candidates think the SGA has done a good job this year, and plan to continue with new programs of the last few years, such as the student phonathon and the trustee contact committee.

Legerton said he will continue with the present program and “also bring in a focus on some student-oriented issues. I think the two complement each other, and that with the two together we can have a strong and vital SGA next year.” He added, “The SGA needs to do a lot more than just be another arm of the Development Department.”

Legerton thinks the SGA functions first as a voice of student opinion, and second as an organization to work with the administration and Trustees in potential trouble areas to clear them up before crises develop.

Dorsett said he thinks the SGA should be project-oriented rather than issue-oriented. He said the SGA’s most valuable work involves bringing the student body together and helping the students work together with the faculty and administration.

Dorsett said he saw two major roles for the SGA. “I think the major role of the SGA is to provide a spirit of positive interaction between all of the groups on campus, students, faculty, administration, and Trustees. At the same time, the SGA has to remember that it’s the student voice, the students’ mouthpiece.”

Legerton said that the strengths of his candidacy are the diversity he will bring to the office and his intention to focus on student issues. His experience in student activities has been largely in the SGA and the Y-Student Service Corps. As a freshman class senator, he helped form the Freshman Food Committee and the Student Commons Committee. He was the treasurer of the Y-Student Service Corps last year. This year he is Chairman of the Activities Tax Council (ATC) and is on the Chaplain Search Committee.

Dorsett said that his SGA experience, his energy, his (See page 11)

**Place Second in US**

By NICK GRAHAM

Editor’s note: This Monday the Davidson College Bowl team won second place in the College Bowl national championship tournament at Marshall University in Huntington, West Virginia. The team lost to the University of Maryland in its final match 360-130. Davidson won the national championship in 1979. Seniors Tim Newcomb, Bob Evans, Julie Gibert, Ed Trumbull, and sophomore alternate Marvin Overby were coached by German Professor Hansford Epes. Davidsonian staff writer Nick Graham went with the team to Huntington. The following are his impressions of the tournament.

To steal a line, one can say that all good College Bowl teams are similar, whereas all great teams are somehow different in their respective excellencies. The finalists in this week’s College Bowl National Championships were quite remarkably disparate. If anybody out there is still thinking that the result in some way amounts to a humiliation of Davidson or that the team was remiss in failing to bring home a larger trophy, then I should point out that the final score hardly tells the full story of a week of hard competition.

If the prospect of 24 high-powered College Bowl teams descending for six days upon a place as unprepossessing as Huntington, West Virginia sounds harrowing, add the fact that we were all accommodated in the Holiday Inn, an overheated horror of static electricity and unreliable plumbing, which, with so much mental energy being rapidly dissipated in short, sharp bursts, soon came to resemble, in my eyes at least, a kind of Death Row for the Intelligentsia. This is probably not as far-fetched as it sounds. There was a definite feeling that the “old guard”—teams like Harvard-Radcliffe, Chicago, and Washington University at St. (See page 11)

**Both Students and Colleges May Be Hurt by Reagan’s Proposed Budget Cuts**

By Sally Campbell  
Staff Writer

President Ronald Reagan’s proposed budget for fiscal year (FY) 1982 targets $6 billion for higher education, a $200 million cut from 1981 and $741 million less than the Carter administration had. Opponents of the cuts say passage of the proposals could force 750,000 students out of college resulting in the closing of 281 private schools. Congress will revise Reagan’s proposals in the following months as it formulates the FY 1982 budget to go into effect October 1 of this year.

Reagan’s proposals particularly affect students from middle and upper-income families. The proposals call for changes in the need-based Pell Grant program (formerly Basic Educational Opportunity Grants) and for tighter restrictions in the Guaranteed Student Loan (GSL) program, limiting loans to students with financial need. The National Direct Student Loan program (NDSL), while due for an increase this year, is to be phased out in the next four years.

The proposal would tighten Pell Grant eligibility requirements by lowering the maximum income to $21,000 for a family of four. Families would have to contribute 20 percent of their income to educational costs rather than the presently required 14 percent, according to Higher Education and National Affairs. Each student recipient of a Pell Grant would have to contribute $750 annually.

Focus: One hundred and forty-five Davidson students have Pell Grants, 275 have GSLs, and 189 have NDSLs, according to Associate Director of Financial Aid Kathleen Stevenson. The proposed cuts would affect colleges directly as well. A reduction of the federal postal subsidy would raise postal costs. Other possible effects on Davidson include fewer grants for faculty research and College development. The number of students with GSLs may be reduced by 90 percent if the proposals pass, according to the March 2 Chronicle for Higher Education. The loans would only be available to students with proven financial need. Interest rates on the loans would correspond to market levels (currently 17 percent) instead of being fixed at 9 percent. Federal funding for NDSLs, which are need-based loans awarded jointly by the federal government and the student’s school, would increase from $186 to $286 million to cover for the other cuts.

Stevenson said the government now supplies 90 percent and the college 10 percent of the loan. “I think it is imperative that we consider expanding our loan program,” Stevenson said.

The proposal would also phase out all Social Security payments to students. Congressman Peter Peyser (D-NY) has initiated a student letter-writing campaign to fight Reagan’s proposals. But he has received only 75 letters so far, according to the College Press Service (CPS).
