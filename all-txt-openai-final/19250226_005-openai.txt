THE DAVIDSONIAN, FEBRUARY 26, 1925

This Week’s Puzzler as a Sure Remedy for Intellectual Lassitude

R. O. T. C. News

J. S. McRae, superb musician and erstwhile cross-word puzzler champion, was the first to turn in the correct solution to
last week’s word-twister. His prompt and authentic solution won for him the Davidsonian subscription, offered as an incentive to those
who might be suffering from either a temporary or permanent attack of mental laziness.

The Davidsonian discontinues with this issue its custom of awarding a subscription to the lucky fan, whose solution happens to
be the first to fall into the hands of the editors. For obvious reasons, the practice of awarding such a
prize has proved a financial burden to the publication. Hence, future puzzlers will attract attention purely because of their own
merit. Puzzles will continue to be published until such a time as the patrons of the paper indicate that their
interest in the popular fad has waned.

Get out your dictionaries, your pencils, and erasers, fellows, and concentrate on this latest masterpiece of Shelby’s:

The R. O. T. C. team of Davidson College has been organized and the final tryouts will be held Friday
afternoon, February 27th. The Area will be fired from February 23rd to March 21st.

Beginning next week, spring maneuvers begin, starting first with extended order drill and maneuver formations followed by a practice march
and tactical exercises. Later on in the spring, there will be a special course in rifle and pistol marksmanship for
Davidson College students who expect to attend summer camp. Davidson hopes to send men who not only will qualify but
will lead other colleges in rifle and pistol marksmanship.

Freshmen have finished firing the course on the indoor rifle ranges. The highest average was made by J. S. Foster,
who scored 197 out of a possible 200. J. R. Talley and Leon Vick each scored 189. Highest scores for
the various positions are as follows: J. W. Bowen, Elmer Brown, J. S. Foster, J. P. Harmon, J. P. McKnight,
D. G. Oden, and J. G. Wharton all scoring perfect in the prone position. In the sitting position, Th. B.
Arbuckle, Jr., J. S. Foster, Joe Overton, and R. M. Stevenson made perfect scores. The highest score kneeling was that
of S. M. Purcell, who made 49 out of 50. In the standing position, J. M. Akers, D. T. Currie,
Tyree Dillard, I. M. Phillips, J. R. Talley, and C. V. Smith tied for first honors, scoring 46 each.

Firing on the outdoor range for freshmen will begin about the first of March. A medal will be awarded to
the man making the highest score.

The Citizens’ Military Training camps for the summer of 1925 will be held in the Fourth Corps Area from July
2nd to July 31st. Applications for admission should be made to the C. M. T. C. Officers Headquarters, Fourth Corps
Area, Red Rock Bldg., Atlanta, Ga., or detailed information may be obtained from Brig. Gen. Albert L. Cox, O. R.
C., Raleigh, N. C.; Col. W. M. Bristol, Statesville, N. C.; Capt. R. D. Daugherity, Davidson College.

According to the Infantry Journal, there is a good deal of agitation going on now about the return of the
army to the old blue dress uniform. The discussion was started by a remark made by the Secretary of War,
to the effect that the drab service uniform worn by the army did not show up well on public occasions
in comparison with the dressy blue appearance of the Marines and the Navy. The present field uniform was adopted as
a necessity, in the event of war. Now it is argued that in order to maintain a proper esprit de
corps the army must go back to the blue.one's self. 35—Divisions of land. 36—Green. 38—A boy's name. 40—Possessive pronoun. 41—Used

The active head of the organization of the National Council for the Prevention of War is responsible for much of
the pacifist propaganda that is being spread throughout the country. President of the United States for his opposition to the
National Defense Test Day. Recently, a history of his life has been officially composed, which discloses facts leading to conclusions
that he is a man whose opinions should be suppressed. He was severely rebuked by the C. E. T. C.

D. C. HOLDS DEPUTATIONS MEETING

The Christian Endeavor Training class held a very instructive and interesting meeting in Shearer Hall, Sunday afternoon, February 22nd. The
main speakers of the meeting were Bill Covington and J. P. Harmon. Both men assumed that they had been sent
out on a deputation to some neighboring society and gave the talks that they would have given if such had
been the case. Harmon, the first speaker, in his talk on The Executive Committee and Its Work, showed the important
position the executive committee held in the regime of the C. E. society, by explaining in some detail the work
of the committee. He stressed the fact that regular written reports were essential to the proper functioning of the committee,
and that the success of the society depended, to a large extent, upon the executive committee. After Ted Covington’s talk
the house was opened to general discussion.

The Reserve Officers Association in Rockford, Ill., has the express purpose of clarifying misconceptions created by outbursts of pacifists. Apparently
inexplicable statements in the public press are being traced to their origins and in most cases, proven to be false.

The Camp Commander was approaching in the dark. “Halt!” a voice rang out in the night, “Dismount to be recognized!”
The officer dismounted, approached, was recognized and told to pass on. “Very good,” he commented, “but under whose orders are
you posted?” “Oh, I’m just out here practicing,” was the reply.

The Freshman and Sophomore classes at the University of Texas have signed a peace treaty. They have agreed that each
should give a winter-term social without the molestation of the other.

MINISTERIAL CHARGE BY DR. BLACK SUNDAY

Dr. W. C. Black who conducted the revival in the Presbyterian Church last week was the speaker at the meeting
of the Ministerial Band last Sunday. Dr. Black took as his subject, “Go ye into all the world and preach
the gospel to every creature.”

“This is the greatest commission that has ever been given in all time,” said the speaker as he started his
talk. Continuing, he said that this is a direct command to every Christian, that there is no special call that
comes to an individual but every Christian should not expect a special call but rather should be able to give
some valid reason for not preaching. According to this verse, every saved one is called to preach unless he can
give some good reason for not doing so to God. Sixty percent of the people in North Carolina are without
Christ. The need is real. Paul had his eyes opened and had a vision of the need, then set about
remedying it, and did his work so well that he could write to Timothy at the close of his life
that he had fought a good fight. You see, hear, feel the need and as you are able to talk
it should be on the lips of each Christian, “Lord send me.” Paul said “Woe is me if I preach
not the Gospel.” The command has been there for nearly 2,000 years yet so few have heeded it.

Dr. Black then took up the many-sidedness of the ministry and explained that in this calling more so than any
other, a man can use all the talents he possesses. He urged each man to preach the Gospel, salvation, and
faith and while here in college to set for a goal just that instead of fame, sermons of high-sounding phrases,
and a place in society. Preach the Gospel, tell the people how to be saved and to live better after
they have been saved and Christ will be with you always and assure success for you.

An article in The Reflector, from Mississippi A & M., written by a Freshman, says that out there the frosh
really enjoy life.
