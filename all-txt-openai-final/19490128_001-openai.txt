**Army Replaces Guilford On Revised Wildcat Gridiron Schedule**

**IN CADET'S SEASON OPENER**

By BILL

Davidson College's athletic scope received its first post-war widening last Saturday morning with the announcement that the 1949 edition of the Wildcats would meet the United States Military Academy at West Point, September 24, in the opening game for both schools. It was also welcomed by Davidson in that it will give the Wildcat shot in the arm. Head Coach Charley Jamerson commented, and many, that the move will go a long way toward bringing good football to Davidson that might have drifted to bigger schools with more tempting schedules to offer. The Presbyterians, with 19 lettermen returning, will now travel from West Point to Winter Park, Fla., where they will meet Rollins College, another newcomer to the Cat card for 1949.

The announcement by Athletic Director Norman Shepard of the Army addition was the second revision of the Davidson schedule. It had been revised earlier to include a meeting with the Citadel on Thanksgiving Day. That game still stands, and it will close out the ten-game Davidson card this autumn. Army, the fifth-ranking team in the Associated Press poll final ratings, called Shepard requesting the game a week ago yesterday when Hawaii canceled their opener. Shepard replied that the Davidsonians would be glad to accept the game if they could clear the date on the schedule. The Guilford game was postponed until 1950, and Wofford agreed to move their meeting with the Wildcats from the September lid-lifter to an October date.

The meeting between the Davidsonians and the Black Knights of the Hudson will be the third in the history of the two schools. In 1929 Davidson bowed to the Keydets, 23-7, and again in 1934 Army’s power prevailed in a 41-0 victory over Coach Doc Newton's Red and Blacks. Coach Charley, in announcing the opening grid drills this week, commented: “Army is dropping Notre Dame and adding Davidson, whereas we are dropping Guilford and adding Army; but if they think they are getting themselves into an easy opener, they're sadly mistaken.”

Jamerson viewed the first few days of the off-season practice session with the summarizing eye that ends and fullbacks are the vacant spots on next fall's squad. Buddy Cheek, Mike Williams, Bill Johnson, and possibly Hal Mapes will not return next year on the (Continued On Page Three)

**Davidson Remains In Collegiate Council**

By JIM BLACKBURN

A meeting of the Intercollegiate Council for Religion in Life in the Charlotte area was held in the “Y” lounge at 4:30 Tuesday afternoon. The purpose of this meeting was to discuss ways and means of Davidson's greater participation in the work of this council and whether or not to continue membership in it. Heretofore, Davidson’s representation at the meetings of this council held at Barba-

**Dr. Eberhardt Speaks In Lecture Series**

By BILL NEAL

On January 24, Dr. Charles R. Eberhardt, of the Davidson College Bible Department, began a series of lectures at the Biblical Seminary in New York. During this series, he made public his findings from an extensive study of the works of his former teacher, the late Dr. Wilbert Webster White, founder and, for 39 years, president of the seminary. Shortly before his death, Dr. White expressed a desire that his documents be preserved and appointed Dr. Eberhardt to be the collector. Dr. Eberhardt has edited the material, and it is soon to be published. It was from this study that his lecture, based on the theme of “Biblical Foundations of the Christian Ministry,” was taken. Dr. Eberhardt appeared on the program with Dr. John R. Mott, honorary president of the World Council Church, and Dr. Edwin Drew, an eminent theologian from Drew Theological Seminary.

**Photo Club Elects Lindsay President**

“We still are in a nebulous state,” and welcome new members as well as donations of darkroom equipment, commented Art Lindsay, president of the recently organized Davidson Photography Club, which at present has headquarters in a small darkroom in the basement of Watts. The formal organization of the club began in November with a meeting of interested students. Discussing at this meeting the best way to use an allotment of money from the Dowd Gift for photography, it was decided to form an organization of all interested photographers in the school. At the first informal meeting of the club, Art Lindsay was elected president; Bob Johnson, secretary-treasurer; and John Stewart, faculty adviser. Also, rules applying to memberships were adopted.

The only requirements for admission are the payment of a five-dollar annual membership fee and to be a student in good academic standing. The darkroom and equipment are now being assembled, as much as possible, through donations. Later complementary purchases will be made to furnish adequate means to develop and print a large variety of photographs. The immediate plans besides the darkroom are to get as many members as possible and to set up a schedule for use of the darkroom. Looking into the future, President Lindsay said he thought that

**DAVIDSON, NORTH CAROLINA, FRIDAY, JANUARY 28, 1949**

**DORSEY CONCERT TO LAUNCH**

This past Monday in chapel, the student body heard Dr. W. G. McGavock, professor of mathematics, speak on the “Profession of Teaching.” With his enlightening wit and sense of humor, Dr. McGavock kept the students wide awake with a very interesting talk. Dr. McGavock began by saying that the profession of teaching was a very important subject. The speaker pointed out that, even though many students wanted to go on to higher institutions of learning and do graduate work, secondly, the companionship with boys would be enjoyable to them, and, lastly, the person would be in touch with life, helpful and rewarding. Dr. McGavock explained to them to bear in mind and to think seriously about this worthwhile vocation. It would help much in the attainment of knowledge for the teacher, besides providing enjoyment for himself.

Three reasons why men enter the teaching profession were commented on by Dr. McGavock. First, it gave them time to think of a profession which they might be more interested in, and the experience and knowledge gained would be of value to them if they wanted to enter another profession. Secondly, prep schools wanted Davidson graduates. The speaker hoped many students would adhere to the profession.

**JOHNNY SATTERFIELD'S SET CITED AS SEASON'S FINEST**

By ARNIE COVALL

The Pan-Hellenic Council has completed and is executing plans for the annual Midwinter Dances, which are to take place February 4 and 5 at the Morris Field gymnasium, with Johnny Satterfield and his orchestra setting the pace. Hours for the formal dance of Friday night, February 4, have been set from 9 until 1. The Vandy figure, a traditional decorative flourish added to the occasion, will be held during the thirty-minute intermission. The informal dance of Saturday night, February 5, will be from 9 till 12. This second of the two dances was scheduled for no earlier an hour than 9 p.m., so as not to conflict with the numerous fraternity banquets and similar functions also slated for that night. To compensate for the late start, however, the intermission will last only fifteen minutes. Johnny Satterfield’s seventeen-piece orchestra from the University of North Carolina will render music for the pair of promenades. Satterfield, who studied music at the University of California and the University of North Carolina, is a composer, arranger, pianist, and conductor. His own reputation as a pianist and arranger has attracted to Satterfield many of the South's musicians of talent, of which he has an abundance. Featured are vocalist Ruth Justice, tenor saxophonist Sam Andrews, alto saxophonist Jim Crawford, trumpeters Chuck Simpson and Jerry McDuffie, and trombonist Norman Deatrey. Satterfield’s arrangements possess both danceability and listenability, distinguishing his band from the large majority of similar organizations. The popularity of Satterfield is evidenced by the fact that many of the larger colleges and universities of the Southeast book him repeatedly. Aside from the fact that several Pan-Hell members have heard Satterfield vouch for his fine reputation, Metronome Magazine lists his band as the best college band in the South. The Valentine theme will strike Midwinter’s season key note, and decorations will center around this idea. The price of a set ticket is $6.00. (Continued On Page Four)

Tuesday's chapel program was highlighted by an announcement that Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra would make a visit to the hill in the near future. Pan-Hell President Bill Scruggs stated that Dorsey's concert on February 11th would open the drive for funds which is being promoted by the Student Development Committee. The TD band will feature the Master of the trombone himself, the Sentimentalists, Denny Dennis, and Trey Polk, with Louise Belson on the drums. The Sentimentalists will sing a number by

Although kicking is merely a side note for Doc, he might well claim to be one of the most loyal of all Davidson supporters throughout the history of the college. Since 1933 when he was first employed by the Athletic Department, Doc has served in various capacities, ranging from trainer to equipment manager, to head maintenance man. But regardless of the positions he has held, Doc is the fellow who is always there with the right thing at the right time. He is the person who issues and takes care of equip- ment, does the other small but nevertheless important things which go into keeping a team supplied and in shape, and always has a smile and a word of encourage- ment for everyone. The players who have come to know Doc feel as if he is an inseparable part of the team and display their affection for him and their appreciation for the work which he has done through an annual gift from all the fellows. Nor is this affection one-sided. One needs to but speak to Doc White concerning a Davidson team in order to view the almost paternal attitude he assumes towards the in- dividual players and of the enjoyment he receives from helping take care of the boys and of how for sixteen years he has seen what he calls “the spirit” during their stay at David- son. For Doc, White may not be able to kick field goals, but he has proved himself capable of earning an honored position in Davidson ath- letics.
