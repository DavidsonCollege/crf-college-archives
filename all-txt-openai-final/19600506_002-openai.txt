#### Sophomore Rush: A Hope...

The faculty surprised themselves and the student body when they climbed out of their rocking chairs and out onto a
limb last Tuesday afternoon. They asserted a right and a responsibility to intervene in student affairs where they felt that
intervention was warranted. They voted by a solid margin to make a radical change in the college social organization; they
accepted risks which are incalculable until the new system is in actual operation. In short, they went out on a
limb and they can’t climb back down without tearing their pants.

Perhaps the most unfortunate aspect of the sophomore rush ruling is that the faculty had to intervene. President Martin said
that the ruling is not to be taken as a slap at the I.F.C.—nor is it evidence of a trend
toward increased faculty influence in student affairs. We fervently hope this is the case. In the past, the faculty has
often acquiesced on issues where student opinion was overwhelmingly one-sided. The faculty has, on occasion, given the students a passive
vote of confidence by not taking action where they thought that action might have been needed. We trust that the
faculty will not tack preferential bidding onto their sophomore rush regulation. This is a job for the I.F.C.

We hope that Tuesday's ruling is an exception—that the faculty will not use this radical movement as a stepping stone
to a policy of trying to solve all student problems. The faculty-student relationship is now fairly sound. But increased faculty
intervention will lead to bitterness on the part of students and a breakdown in student government.

#### ...And A Warning

Sophomore rush will be a reality in 1961. It is unlikely that the faculty will back off now, no matter
how exemplary fraternities become next fall, no matter how many petitions are signed, or how many professors are button-holed in
earnest personal protest. Actually, sophomore rush is a reality right now. The next two semesters will be a major factor
in determining the success or failure of the new program.

Fraternity men who think they can make the faculty’s decision backfire by acting like truculent kids reacting to an unpleasant
parental decree are in for a rude awakening. To sabotage the new system would be to risk forcing the faculty’s
hand again—and the results then would be even more drastic for fraternities than last Tuesday’s action. Instead, fraternities should begin
positive preparation for the big change in 1961. The I.F.C. should begin immediate study on a preferential quota bidding system.
This is tailor-made for a deferred rushing program. It would help ensure that four or five fraternities will not grow
disproportionately stronger, while two or three small fraternities are being completely wiped out.

Sophomore rush will not be a panacea for all fraternity evils, real or imagined. It won't solve all the problems
and chances are excellent that it will dump on us a truck-load of problems we've never had before. But we
feel sure of one thing: if sophomore rush can reach the goals its supporters have set for it, the system
will be well worth trying and keeping. If the freshman will be able to make a calm, rational choice as
to whether or not he wants to pledge a fraternity, or which fraternity he wants to pledge, we're all for
it. If the freshman’s academic life is enriched, if he is able to squirt a transfusion of new blood into
extra-curricular activities and athletics, the new system will pay for itself.

These are big ifs. The faculty and administration can’t turn them into realities by serving as a law enforcement body.
It boils down to this: sophomore rush, a system which eleven out of twelve fraternities voted against, can succeed only
if the fraternities make it succeed. Only the fraternities can make sure that dirty rushing doesn’t run rampant. Fraternities can
solve some of the biggest problems in a system they didn’t want in the first place.

If we cooperate and the new system still doesn’t work, we feel certain that the faculty will have sense enough
to go back to the old way. And finally, a warning: if we act like a bunch of pouting kids,
and the new system doesn’t work, there may be dire consequences. When the faculty climbed out onto the limb, they
took the fraternities with them.

#### A Note To Tired Crusaders

“Fresh as the breezes of springtime,
Clear as the morning dew;
Earnest in building for manhood,
The work of the W.C.T.U.”
—From the White Ribbon

The North Carolina White Ribbon, official newspaper of the Women’s Christian Temperance Union, came across our desk this week—and with
it, a moral for Davidson Gentlemen. Not the obvious moral, though; we won’t assert that the work of the W.C.T.U.
is as fresh as the breezes and as clear as the morning dew. But the temperance ladies do force us
to one observation: idealism is not dead. When we feared most that cynicism had overtaken our nation, the luminous (if
futile) enthusiasm of the W.C.T.U. allayed our fears. And so we pass on to our readers a few quotes from
the White Ribbon, that our hoary old college as well as W.C.T.U. members may see—if not share—this fervor for a
lost cause.

Consider the President’s Message: Liquor “has so influenced some...” opines Mrs. Edith Scott, “that they cannot think clearly.” And she
continues: “We cannot afford to take our ease in Zion! Let us work, pray and give, that the day may
come when King Alcohol may be banished!”

While the ladies are working, praying and giving, they presumably have their children making speeches at Youth Temperance Council meetings.
From the minutes: “Jimmy Summey... said he overheard some boys talking one day. One was bragging about all the beer
they had. The boy said he went home, opened the refrigerator, and drank all the beer he wanted. His dad
bought it all for him.” And: “Ann Language gave a speech about a little boy named Humpy who obtained his
name because his father drank.”

Davidson Gentlemen tired of campus issues may find a worthy cause here. They might begin making plans to attend the
Total Abstinence Training Camp at Flat Rock, N.C., which the White Ribbon reports will be held August 22-26. Four days
of Total Abstinence Training can be had for only fifteen dollars, too. And for a fairly reasonable sum (say, the
cost of two fifths) one may become a Rock-of-Ages Member of the W.C.T.U. We think it sounds like a good
thing.

#### Sophomore Rush Affects All Campus Life

By DAVID JORDAN, Davidsonian Managing Editor

What will be the results of sophomore rush? What can the college as a whole expect from such a change?
These are the real questions following the faculty’s surprise action last week at Davidson.

Perhaps the most glaring problem is that the college is not presently able to assume necessary responsibility for a body
of about 400 non-fraternity men a year to which it is now committed. This was the primary reason for delaying
the introduction of the new system until 1961. First, eating facilities are insufficient for such a large body. Continued use
of the Union is impractical without considerable expansion. The basement of Chambers has been termed an “ideal place” by George
Shaw, Slater Service manager, but even this would not be a complete solution. Without question, the Union, under its present
program, would be greatly overtaxed in serving as a center for this group. A broadened program would still be handicapped
by lack of space and physical facilities.

Freshmen are almost wholly dependent on their fraternities during their first year at Davidson. Separated from this source of transportation
and social activities, they would experience in great magnification the problems of the present independent group. A new social program
would be required under these conditions, with perhaps a change from the present conception of all social life being centered
in the fraternity system. Dance weekends would particularly pose a problem.

Perhaps just as important is the effect this measure will have on the fraternities themselves, particularly financially and numerically. Dr.
Martin has indicated that the interest rate on the houses will not be changed. Thus a smaller group of men
must carry the same financial burden. Not only will the housing fee increase, but also it may be difficult for
smaller fraternities to meet their operating expenses. Boarding house fees would have to rise. Will sophomore rush make the weak
weaker and the strong stronger? Would various fraternities become even more stereotyped? No answers are possible until the system is
actually tried. Nevertheless, the possibility is distinct.

#### I Hate To Do This...

**Seniors Term ROTC Practical, French Gives Other View**

By ERVIN DUGGAN, Davidson Associate Editor

A small group of Davidson seniors—all of them members...Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

---

of Phi Beta Kappa, Omicron Delta Kappa, or both—answered questions this week on their experience as student soldiers. They displayed
remarkable unanimity. The consensus? ROTC, say these seniors, is the best alternative for the student facing military service—but it has
little or no educational value. The chief values of student military training are extra money, a sure commission, and—for some—valuable
experience in leadership and at ROTC summer camp. But all stated that if they had the choice again, they’d take
advanced ROTC training. The seniors answered five questions: Are you glad you took advanced ROTC? Why?

They suggested other advances: “More imaginative instruction,” “Reduction in factual training, removal of all weapons instruction, increased study of U.S.
strategy and defensive theory, U.S. military alliances, and contemporary world problems.” They listed as drawbacks loss of academic time, skimming
over “a broad range of material which is mostly nebulous in itself,” and the teaching of “scores of facts and
manuals rather than an open approach.” One senior wrote: “With the exception of summer camp, I think my training was
fruitless.” The seniors were terse in listing the strong points of student military training: “The money and the commission,” said
one. Another: “$27 monthly—commission—instances of leadership training.” Only one student answered negatively: “Actually, can’t say it has strong points. If
defined rules and strict enforcement, there would be a great danger of dirty rush. The IFC faces a tremendous task
here. On the other hand, smaller fraternities may have a greater attraction when freshmen are able to base their judgments
on a year’s observation. Also in line would be the possibility of a preferential bidding system. Dr. Martin has stated
that it deserves serious study, more so now than ever before. Enactment of such a system, which should come from
the IFC, however, the problem of a long? Without carefully mentioned above. Pledge training, as it has existed in the
past, would probably be inadequate. Fraternities must face a re-evaluation of this program—in fact, a re-evaluation of their entire program.
The role of fraternities on campus will be placed under serious examination. They will have to prove themselves to 250
freshmen each year. With a full year as independents, will the freshmen be as anxious to “pledge up” as they
have been each September in the past? If the college furnishes an adequate program for independents, which it must if
sophomore rush is to be feasible, will a great majority find that they don’t need fraternities? Undoubtedly the quality of
freshmen work should improve and the extent of their participation in extra-curricular activities increase with a lessening of the usual
demands placed on their time. The prospects of the renewed prosperity of dramatics, debate, literary activities, etc., brighten to a
great extent. All ramifications of the faculty’s action are unimaginable. These few are sufficient to indicate that sophomore rush will
necessitate a careful examination of present policies and programs and concrete actions for the future.

THE EDITOR'S GUEST “Circulation” It Deserves

(Editor’s Note: This article by Dr. Howard French initiates a new weekly guest column. Persons interested in contributing should contact
the editor.)

By DR. HOWARD FRENCH

During the past few weeks, a considerable number of alumni, faculty members, and other members or close friends of the
Davidson “College Family” have expressed, in letters, in conversation, and in public pronouncements, their reactions to a couple of general
comments that I made in March on the condition of the College. Thoughtful ones among these persons have realized that
my comments were the result of a concern for the welfare of Davidson, not of some foolish and unavailing desire
to discredit the institution that I have served for the past seven years.

EYE-OPENING FACT

What is eye-opening, and has contributed to my education, is the fact that so many of these statements concur in
revealing a point of view that I have never before heard defended. It is a point of view that deserves
being put into words, given wide circulation, and subjected to critical thought and discussion. Briefly, the viewpoint expressed by so
many influential friends of the College is this: the fact that the Davidson faculty is being filled up with Davidson
alumni is not one to make us uneasy, but rather a cause for rejoicing. After all, who can better cherish,
understand, and propagate Davidson’s inimitable ideals and traditions than her own graduates? What has the outside world to offer that
is comparable to the devotion of Davidson's own sons to their alma mater? The poor church-supported college cannot, of course,
compete with state-supported schools and heavily endowed private institutions for really good scholars and teachers; but what is mere intellect,
scholarship, and academic excellence in comparison with the freely offered service of devoted alumni?

IMMATURE NEED PROTECTION

And the truth is that our boys are too immature for exposure to the unsettling influences of a serious and
sophisticated intellectual atmosphere, the sort of atmosphere that might conceivably result from introducing a lot of teachers and/or administrators from
other parts of the country and turning them loose on the Davidson campus; how much preferable to protect our sons,
for four more tender years, from the—ugh!—realities of adult existence. (Aside: for some reason, there seems unduly little sense here
that these—ugh!—realities might be more exciting in a more enlightened world.)

The foregoing, I repeat, deserves to be made explicit; its merits should be recognized and widely proclaimed; at present, it
seems to be but a tacit assumption on the part of the College’s policy-makers.

FACTS SPEAK DIFFERENTLY

Unfortunately, a part of College policy seems to be a determination to keep this viewpoint under the table, tacit and
unexpressed; an official representative of the College states that the percentage of alumni on the Davidson faculty is on the
decrease! Any non-alumnus staff-member, I believe, would consult the records, determine the facts, give a slight shiver, and come up
with a somewhat different answer.
