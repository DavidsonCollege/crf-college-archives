### Ice Storm Fells Tree on Campus

Head of Maintenance Irvin Brawley said that last week’s ice storm was the worst he has seen in his eight years at Davidson.

No estimate was made of the damage, but the loss of the huge willow oak near the Davidson College Presbyterian Church was certainly the primary casualty. The oak tree was the largest on campus. Estimates of its age ranged from 75 to 200 years old. When the trunk was cut, its rings revealed its actual age to be 65.

Brawley knew that the tree had a weak root system but said that nothing could be done to prevent its fall.

The weight of accumulated ice broke limbs from numerous other trees across the campus. About 90 percent of the limbs downed were elm or maple. These types of wood break off with the weight of the ice more readily than others. Because oak is a strong wood, the big willow oak fell instead of breaking.

The limbs of the big oak were salvaged for firewood by the maintenance crew. Several cross sections will go to the Biology lab. The rest will go for timber.

Brawley said he has received several requests for pieces of the tree from alumni who have sentimental memories of studying or courting beneath its canopy. He said that paperweights or gavels might be made from the wood to use in fundraising efforts.

### CCRL Alters Self-Selection Process

Dean of Students Will H. Terry and the Council on Campus and Religious Life (CCRL) have approved a new approach to self-selection. The date for matching freshmen with the ten Patterson Court houses is February 16.

Terry explained that the new system discourages students from joining houses in which they have no interest while maintaining the principle of self-selection. Above all, Terry is committed to that principle over group-selection.

By February 16, each interested freshman will submit to Terry's office up to three houses in his order of preference. That day, representatives from the ten houses and Terry will randomly draw the preference sheets. The first choices will be signed up until the house lists are filled.

After the whole pile of preference sheets is gone through once, the drawing order will be exactly reversed and all second choices will be given. Finally, the remaining sheets will be gone over a third time, giving third choices.

Those people not receiving their first choice will automatically be put on the waiting list for that house. For those students not receiving their second or third choices, there will be a lottery assigning them to a waiting list.

Each freshman will have the option of filling out a sheet by himself or with a group of up to six people. A group that runs over a limit in the selection process will be put back in the pile if it has another choice, and if it does not, it will go to a waiting list.

Asked whether this system represents an answer for future years, Terry replied, “Nothing dealing with this system is eternal. The Council has really tried to be conscientious... but we know that we're dealing with a large can of worms.” The Patterson Court Council will work with Terry to help carry out the process.

Approximately 100 freshmen opted not to go through the selection process last year. The CCRL has not decided yet what to do with those upperclassmen who wish to join a house. They will not go through the selection process but will probably be added to the waiting lists at some point. Many houses have already taken care of their waiting lists from last year. Terry also hopes to make special consideration for the international students next year.

### Davidson Police Department Divides; Hughes Directs College Headquarters

Davidson town and college police forces divided into two separate departments today.

This decision, according to Director of the Physical Plant Grover C. Meetze, was “based on the feeling that it is in the best interest of all concerned to develop a department of safety for the College separate from the town.

“We began to have administrative problems and I thought it was important to form a separate group,” he said. “To keep the needed authority we had to make a change.”

The college force will be headed by Captain Jackie Hughes, with its headquarters in the Precinct #2 building.

These officers will wear different uniforms and badges than town officers, and the College plans to purchase a car to be used only on the Davidson campus.

All emergency calls will connect to the town, and the town force will support the College force if needed. This will be the only connection between the two departments.

The Student Government Association (SGA) Security Committee met today to analyze problems of security encountered in the past and discuss how these problems might be connected with the new system.

The committee stressed the point that student cooperation is essential for a successful security program. They emphasized the significance of student alertness and the importance of locking doors during ball games, big weekends, parties, and breaks.

“I would like to think this will be the beginning of a new kind of attitude of security to students and students to security,” commented Dean of Students Will Terry.

“If we can develop this program,” Terry said, “we can find enormous benefits. The security of all of us will be better covered.”
