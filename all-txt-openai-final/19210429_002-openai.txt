THE DAVIDSONIAN, APRIL 29, 1921.

Diamond Dust

Don't knock the team. If they run into a streak of hard luck, remember that they are trying to do their best, and that is all that can be expected of anyone.

—Wildcats—

Citadel has a well-balanced team, as evidenced by their playing the other day. One thing that the boys from Citadel did that is commendable is that they stood in honor of “O, Davidson.”

—Wildcats—

Elsewhere on this page are the batting averages. In perusing the figures, it will be seen that some are batting the size of their hat, some a little bit higher, about the size of their shoes, while others are batting as high as their laundry numbers.

—Wildcats—

Pee-Wee Katchford can rob a man of a hit and then laugh about it. In the game against Citadel, he caught a line drive about two feet off the ground and to the left of him. It was a catch that would have done credit to some big-time players.

—Wildcats—

The worst defeat that has been heard of lately was the one handed to the Carolina track team by the Virginia cinder path experts. They beat Carolina 117 to 9, winning every first place.

—Wildcats—

Georgia has won 15 games and tied two games out of the 17 played this season.

—Wildcats—

Last week a contest was announced for the purpose of getting a new yell to help make a “Bigger and Better Davidson.” A prize of $10 was offered for the best yell, and the second prize consists of $3. So far, there has been no interest taken in this contest. The need for such a yell is evident. Fellows, turn in a contribution and take a chance on the prize. Back up your cheerleader and give him something to work with. Finally, help the teams to put all they have in the fight by giving them the right kind of support from the sidelines.

—Wildcats—

Why is it that the games that the Wildcats play get a good write-up in one of the Charlotte papers, and in the other one, the account of the game, if won by Davidson, is a small paragraph, and if lost, big headlines across the top of the sheet to that effect? Never yet has this paper given the Wildcat teams a decent write-up, or rather given them a fair showing. The good playing of the opponents and the errors made by Davidson are the features of the story. It would seem to be to the interest of that paper to at least give this college a good write-up, for Davidson is the only college that is instrumental in bringing games to the Queen City.

SOPHS DEFEAT SENIORS IN CLASS BASEBALL

The thump of bludgeons and the howl of happy rooters resounded at Sprunt Field last Friday. The occasion was the playing of a practice game in which the Sophs swamped the dignified but hard-fighting Seniors to the tune of 7 to 3. Three grenadiers, one famous and the other two not unfamous, were the duly accredited heroes of the affray. Captain McKay, of the Sophs, was placed in the Hall of Fame by his stellar catch over second base of a line drive off the bat of Lord Culbreth in the ninth. Aside from an ornamental three-bagger in the fourth and Ground-hog Miller's triple in the sixth, Love lifted a skyscraper to Pitts Dougles, left field, in the second, and to Charlie Vance, center field, in the fifth. Ordinary baseball players would have become wearied waiting for them to come down and gone home, forgetting all about the matter. Not so with the two veterans, however. They knew there was a ball somewhere above in the blue ether that would be along after a while, so they stepped out and snared it when it appeared. McCutchen was walked in the eighth to third when Dick Rich, one of Romeo's 8, hit a mighty drive to right. It was a single until Bob sat down to think the phenomenon over. Then it was good for two bases. Although Love and Blue flied out to Pitts, McCutchen languished still on third. Mickey, coaching him, was making imploring gestures and whistling "The Maiden's Prayer,” but McCutchen, who was busily engaged in trying to set Tennyson's “The Brook” to music of his own composition, died there when Sorrells hit to Milky who threw him out at first. Bill Roberts pitched a two-hit game, and on the receiving end caught a neat game. Matthews, Romefelt, and Walker pitched for the losing side, and Walker, Brady, and Brown caught.

Avvciond evened things up. The star play came in the seventh with Currie, Miley, and Katchford on base and one out. Brown at bat, the infield playing close and the outfield deep; things looked good for a hit. Crack! the ball sailed to center field for apparently a safe hit. Just as the grandstand leaped to their feet, Brown, G. caught the ball with one hand and doubled to second. 

Freeman is the leading Wildcat swat-smith with the splendid average of .400. Ratchford is leading the regulars with the mark of .334. Pee-Wee has also made the largest number of hits, 16, and has pilfered the largest number of sacks.

One of the most interesting matches so far was that between Brice and Gracy in which they played the 18 holes to a tie.

SENIORS LOSE TO FRESH IN INTERESTING CONTEST

The Fresh baseball team, under the leadership of John Briggs as captain, won its first game from the Seniors on last Monday. The battery for the losers was Carl Matthews and Siem Brady, captain of the Senior team. Carl pitched a strong game, striking out 14 men, but McCorkle was the best bet in the infield, while Henry Culbreth was the heavy hitter for the Seniors. Charlie Vance starred by picking a fly off the center field fence in the first inning. For the Freshmen, Briggs pitched a fine game but was relieved by Spratt Moore in the seventh inning. Spratt struck out three men while Briggs had only two to his credit. The pegging of Gentry, the fielding of “Nappy” Davis, and the game throughout was tight. Both teams played exceptional ball, both outfields and infields putting up air-tight ball. Katchford was the bright star for Davidson, handling 9 out of 11 chances. Granford is leading the run-getters with seven markers. He is tied with Shepard for long hitting honors, with five extra bases. Pot is also showing the way for the regulars in the field with an average of .985. Wrenn follows him closely with .984. Cassell is the leading sacrifice hitter with 4 to his credit. Brown is in the midst of a bad batting slump, having gone hitless in his last 15 trips to the platter. Ratchford is making a drive for premier hit-manufacturer of Coach Hengeveld's charges. In six games he raised his average from .200 to .341 but fell back to .333 on Saturday.

GOLF TOURNAMENT DRAWS SCORE OF ENTHUSIASTS

At the call for followers of that small elusive pill better known as a golf ball, about 20 men responded, all eager to win either the club or some balls. For the past week, the course has seen a lively time. Houston White was put in charge of the tournament and he has kept things going as well as keeping his end of his matches well in hand. He is well pleased with the way things are turning out and expresses his belief that Davidson’s golf team will make a good showing in the matches that are scheduled for this spring. A match has been arranged with Salisbury for next Monday or Tuesday. The only men who have played as many as two matches and remain undefeated are White, Brice, and Gracy. There are several who have entered but have not played off their matches. The team will consist of the above three men, together with a fourth who is yet to be picked.

Trinity Game

With the jinx still camping on her tail, Davidson journeyed up to the tobacco city last Friday and lost to Trinity via the shutout route 4-0. Five errors were chalked up against the Wildcats and they affected the result materially. Hunter, starting his first college game, pitched a fine game for the Presbyterians, in spite of poor support from his mates, and deserved to win. Timmy Simpson was on the mound for Trinity and had two things, a dip from W.S. Hill that won him a lot of applause, and a first mortgage on Old Man Luck, that won him a ball game. The Wildcats hit him hard and often, but the ball would either go straight to some fielder or hit the fence and bounce back to them. The Presbyterians had their pet theory of predestination demonstrated to them to their full satisfaction—or dissatisfaction. The fates had decreed that Davidson was to lose the game, and although the Wildcats fought until three were out in the ninth, the argument might as well have ended right there. For instance: In the fourth, Cray bounced a liner against the right field wall so hard that it bent one of the boards double but didn’t quite break it. The force of the recoil was strong enough to throw back nearly to the infield and Pat got only one base.
