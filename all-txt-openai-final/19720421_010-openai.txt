Tenure System (Continued From Page 1)

If a man is to teach at an institution for the remainder of his years, he should get along with
his colleagues, and the institution should be able to terminate his contract if they see that they don’t agree with
his views. But tenure means more than academic freedom and economic security for a professor who has dutifully served his
seven years apprenticeship. The tenure debate is finally concerned with how a university evaluates its faculty. It asks who is
fit to teach at college, what his contribution to the college community has been, and whether he will continue that
contribution after his job is secure. As such, the question of tenure at Davidson concerns everyone in the academic community
and deserves careful scrutiny.and Brahms’ “Song of Fate.” The Symphony will play Brahms’ “First Symphony.” Tickets are $3 to $5,
but are quite limited.

Issue of Subsidized Football Incites Debate at Open End
By MIKE TANNER
Asst. Managing Editor

The question of subsidized football was the focus of Monday night’s Open End. A panel comprised of Vice President for
Finance and Development C. David Cornell, Professor of Economics Robert L. Avinger, Head Football Coach Dave Fagg, and SGA Senator
Bill Meier, together with those on the floor, tried to take a look at the present football situation and possible
alternatives.

Cornell responded to the opening question as to the amount of income from game receipts, stating that in the academic
years 1969-70, 1970-71, and 1971-72 the football team raised $104,688, $31,197, and $142,357 respectively. However, Cornell added that during the
same time period, football expenses (including recruiting, insurance, equipment, scholarships, and game expenses) climbed from $307,847 in 1969-70 to $310,878
in 1970-71 and to $325,821 in 1971-72.

These expense figures represent an excess of expenditures over income of $203,159 in 1969-70, $279,581 in 1970-71, and $183,464 in
1971-72, the sums per year that the college contributes to the football program. The substantial drop in the excess of
1971-72 as opposed to previous years is the result of funds raised by the Wildcat Club, a money-raising organization which
is expected to take on more and more of the financial responsibility for football in years to come. With the
help of the Wildcat Club, the excess of expenditure is projected to decrease in 1972-73 to between $150,000 and $155,000.

In regard to the Wildcat Club, Fagg interjected that the football staff has agreed to accept financial aid from the
college for only one more year in order for the club to realize its full fund-raising potential before it takes
on the task of supporting Davidson football.

Throughout the entire session came comments from many students expressing the opinion that since the football program is so costly
and that the team apparently excites mediocre interest, the logical approach would be to make the program non-subsidized as soon
as possible. The college’s money could then be applied to the improvement of the so-called minor sports such as baseball,
tennis, and soccer.

Avinger suggested that the problem need not be looked at on an all-or-nothing basis, but that there are degrees to
which a team can be subsidized and perhaps this might be the approach to take rather than jerking the financial
rug completely out from under the football team.
