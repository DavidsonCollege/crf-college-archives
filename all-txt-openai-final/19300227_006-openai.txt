**After Graduation — Business?**

**Accountancy Displays Attractive Field for Graduates of College**

**Emphasis Placed on Fact That Business Course is Not Imperative**

Every college senior naturally is eager to find upon his exit from the academic environment a vocation which will permit him to exercise the abilities which four years of intellectual development have given him. It is discouraging, therefore, to find that those intangible faculties a university training is intended to produce, which are inadequately defined as creative imagination, analytical instinct, facility in self-expression, etc., appear to be of no immediate, practical value because the student is innocent of specialized technical knowledge and business experience.

Naturally, in this kind of work there is a great amount of detailed labor to be performed. There is no lack of men to execute these routine duties; indeed, the field is saturated with accountants who are capable of fulfilling the mechanical needs of the profession. But there is a definite demand for broadly educated men who are potentially able, after familiarizing themselves with the preliminary work of the accountant, to conceive the solutions to important problems and to plan and direct the execution of them. Such men must have cultured minds which will permit the survey of complicated problems on complete perspective; they must have the linguistic ability to express clearly the results of analysis. Intellectual confidence, which is the product of experience with formal knowledge and the greatest benefit offered by college training, is essential in the inevitable, intimate relations of public accountants with the leaders of the enterprises which they serve.

The men who are to occupy these high positions in accountancy must obviously be distinctly above the average, and consequently they will receive unusual rewards. Accountants who have imagination and executive ability will have no difficulty in obtaining ample pecuniary remuneration. The goal of every public accountant is to obtain a Certified Public Accountant certificate and to become a partner in an existing public accounting firm or to create a firm for himself, building up his own clientele. In this situation, the possibilities are almost unlimited.

The accountancy profession is not yet crowded with college men, and consequently those who have extraordinary ability, supplemented by excellent academic training, have unusual opportunities to obtain recognition. To qualified men, positions on accountants’ staffs give liberal compensations which compare favorably with those in any profession. Partnerships in accountancy firms usually are open to progressive staff men and the incomes of principals in such firms are equal to those of the higher executives in the business field.

There are comparatively few enterprises of magnitude which do not engage public accountants to conduct regular audits or investigations, but it is probable that not more than one business out of every three of small or medium size in this country has adopted the principle of independent audit. Consequently, the undeveloped field for accountancy is immense. As an alternative to admission to an existing firm, the promising staff assistant may desire to enter professional practice on his own account. The fact that the undeveloped field consists largely of smaller organizations is very important to young practitioners who open their own offices after they have received the C.P.A. certificates, as these men are naturally able at first to obtain small clients more easily than large ones. Many small concerns, moreover, have an evident need of advice from a capable public accountant on their operating problems.

No period of time spent in public accounting practice will be wasted even if one wishes to devote his energy to some other type of business activity. A capable man who has had thorough experience on a public accountant’s staff is also qualified to obtain a responsible position in the permanent employ of a commercial or an industrial organization. The executive who directs the destinies of a business or a corporation must have before anything else a capacity to analyze its financial phases. This is exactly what experience in accountancy makes possible. As a result, there is now a perceptible tendency to select as the heads of large enterprises men who have had such training.

**Textile Industry For College Grads**

By George A. Sloan, President Cotton Textile Institute

American industry is developing a new technique which should be of particular interest to college men who are contemplating the choice of a career in business. The cotton textile industry, and other basic industries in the United States, reflect this technique in a new kind of specialization and co-ordination. Manufacturing methods are changing, new channels of distribution are being used, new products are being introduced so that management must continually be prepared for swift changes.

I believe that one of the principal things for college men to consider in choosing the cotton textile industry—or any other industry—is their ability to meet the requirements of this new technique. This industry in common with others is witnessing great changes. As new methods, new products and new demands appear, they emphasize the extraordinary importance of individual enterprise, imagination, and sound judgment. They are creating opportunities for men who are thoroughly equipped by their technical training to search out and analyze the industry’s major problems and make some constructive contribution that will lay the basis for a broad development of sound manufacturing and merchandising.

From my acquaintance with the cotton textile industry, I believe that one of the best opportunities for college men may be found in merchandising and market research. This industry wants to know more and more about the present and potential markets for its products. It is continually searching for ways to improve these products so that they will better serve the needs of present markets and lead to still larger markets. It is seeking to be more adequately informed so that it can anticipate logical changes in demand and even create and stimulate new demands.

College graduates with sound technical training will find many opportunities for a successful career in one of the numerous branches of the textile industry provided they will also acquire the necessary practical experience which can be obtained only by working through the mills as actual day laborers. I cannot stress the importance too strongly of following up school training with the practical experience in mills because, from mills, machinery builders, and various selling agencies, there is a present demand for men who really know the textile business and such demand is probably larger and more exacting today than at any former time in the history of the industry.

**Banking Affords Real Opportunity**

By Reeve Schley, Vice-President Chase National Bank

One of the advantages that the big corporation offers young men of ability is its comparative freedom from family influence and personal favoritism. This is particularly true of banking. There are many instances, more especially in the smaller communities, where able son succeeds able father in the management of a bank, and wherever this occurs it is wholesome and desirable.On the other hand, it is particularly difficult for an incompetent beginner to go far in banking merely because of family influence. In the first place, the bank in every community is subject to rigorous scrutiny because the whole community deals with the bank and trusts its money to it. Only as far as it keeps the community’s goodwill and confidence can the bank be successful. The officers of the bank must be men who can stand this scrutiny, and the bank would inevitably suffer if incompetent relatives or officers or stockholders receive promotion to important positions in it. An outstanding feature of the banker’s work is its variety. The bank touches every other economic interest in the community, has relations with every kind of business and all types of manufacturing, deals with agriculture and mining, with the government, with the municipal, state, and federal authorities, and last but not least with bankers in other communities and in foreign lands. Above all, the banker’s work involves responsibility, which is tremendously interesting to the majority of men.

The young man contemplating employment in a great city bank may assent to the foregoing and yet may not know what the work above described has to do with the definite tasks which he shall be called upon to accomplish in a department of that bank. In a small bank, an ambitious young man who enjoys the confidence of his chief obviously has his part in the activities described. Almost from the very beginning, he can be in a considerable measure a banker in the complete sense which I have described. But what are the opportunities of a young man in a large city bank? May he not be given a microscopical part of the work of a great institution? Is he not likely to become a mere cog of the machine and be shut off completely from the larger vision which the senior officers of the great institution behold?

To give as candid an answer as I can to this question. First: the vision of the world’s activities, commercial and financial, which can be seen from the vantage point of a great city bank is a broader and a more fascinating vision than that which the small bank in a small community offers, interesting though it be. Secondly: in the great city bank there is a constant study of personnel with a view to finding men of imagination and promise, and as these are found, opportunity is made for them by rotating them among the various departments of the bank so that they may obtain a general knowledge of all that is going on in the institution. They are given promotion and responsibilities, and their opportunities for additional achievement are virtually unlimited. Thirdly: the great city bank is, after all, merely an elaboration of the country bank. The basic functions are there, but because of the multitude of activities, they are split up and especially divided. Moreover, I am convinced that the young man of imagination and aptitude who makes good in the particular jobs first assigned to him in the head office of a great city bank will find all the opportunity that he wants.

FOREIGN TRADE
By E. B. Filsinger
Foreign Sales Manager Lawrence & Co., Who’s Who in America, 1926-27

We can no longer content ourselves with the sale abroad of the products of our mills, farms, and factories; nor can we concern ourselves exclusively with the importation of raw materials and finished products. We have huge investments in foreign countries, which need looking after. Enormous loans are being made weekly to foreign enterprises, banks, and governments. An increasing number of manufacturing institutions are building plants in other countries. Mining and petroleum development abroad with American capital and under American direction is growing. As an instance of what some Americans have accomplished in these directions may be cited the careers of Herbert S. Hoover and John Hays Hammond, both of whom made for themselves an international reputation and accumulated substantial fortunes through their participation in mining development in foreign countries. American salesmanship, advertising, and engineering are making themselves felt in every portion of the globe. American banks are adding to the number of their branches in other lands. Raw materials, in increasing quantities, are being purchased direct from their sources. American educational institutions in far-off places have long been famous. Their number is certain to grow. This brief catalogue of American activities in foreign fields is but a slight indication of the opportunities in many directions that are afforded young men who are on the threshold of their business life.

The stages in the career of a young man who starts at the bottom and “works up” in foreign trade are about the same as in the case of domestic work. If he is with the right house, the rapidity of his advance is almost invariably in his own hands. So, too, is a chance to go abroad. This, naturally, is the logical ambition of most young men. Under ordinary circumstances, the sooner he is qualified, the better pleased is the employer. Once he is sent to a foreign territory, his future (barring the unforeseen or unusual situations) is likewise of his own making. This is true even as regards remuneration. The lure of an immediate larger salary overseas is often deceptive. At times, a premium is paid only because the service is to be performed abroad. Upon his return (especially after a very short period), the young man may find it difficult to obtain employment at the same salary. There are men who serve American concerns abroad, who are receiving considerably larger salaries than they would earn in the United States. On the other hand, it is also true that at times men are not so well paid as conditions might seem to warrant, taking into account the fact that they are expatriates and frequently unable to return to the United States for years at a time. On the question of remuneration, it is very difficult to lay down any hard and fast dicta. Circumstances vary. Unquestionably, there is a growing tendency to properly reward the man who renders meritorious service in foreign fields and who has “made good”—who is in every sense of the word the best type of successful representative.

A greater need for application than in domestic trade; continuous study; travel in foreign countries (at times, under difficult and trying conditions); if married, possible unwillingness of wife to reside abroad; periods of prolonged absence from the United States; likelihood of getting out of touch with concerns at home and, possibly, difficulty of making new connections on return. More interesting work than in the domestic field; the broadening results of travel; greater opportunity for self-development and responsibility; possibility of achieving executive positions; more leisurely living if located abroad; if willing to live permanently overseas, promising and remunerative employment as representatives of American firms.
