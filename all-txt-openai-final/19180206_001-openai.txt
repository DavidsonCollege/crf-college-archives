**The Davidsonian**, Vol. V.

**Junior Speaking Date Remains Unchanged**

Junior Oratoricals Will Begin On March the First

Contrary to the announcement appearing in the last issue of **The Davidsonian**, Junior Speaking will be held on March 1st and 2nd. The many Juniors who are anxiously waiting for a chance to show their talents along the lines of oratory are a little disappointed that the date for Junior Speaking was not changed to February 22nd and 23rd as was planned. Junior Speaking will be held March 1st and 2nd, as the catalog states. This allows them three weeks in which to work on their orations, and in this time some of them should be able to compose speeches which would make Demosthenes himself bow his head in submission. The program committee expects to have a complete list of the speakers and their subjects by the next issue of **The Davidsonian**.

**RECENT RESOLUTION OF THE STUDENT BODY**

Due to the presence of several cases of meningitis in Charlotte and because of the danger of spreading this dreadful disease, the student body unanimously adopted the following resolution: Resolved, That no student shall go to Charlotte before Wednesday, February 13, unless absolutely necessary (that is, unless the Faculty gives permission to go). This action was taken voluntarily by the students in order to co-operate with the officials of Charlotte in their endeavor to stamp out this disease, at the same time it is an act of self-defense in an effort to prevent the spreading of the disease to the campus.

Visitor—“At what time do you have dinner, my little friend?”  
Terrible Boy—“Soon as you’ve gone.”

**Another Victory Is Annexed by Wildcats**

Large Crowd Witnesses First Game On New Gym Floor

The Davidson quint played its first game on the home floor last week, winning from Guilford Friday night by a score of 37-24. The Davidson Orchestra, Jazz Band, and the Davidson ladies were all out, so the team simply had to win in self-defense. Guilford drew first blood in the first few minutes of play when Jones caged a foul goal. A few seconds afterwards Davidson got a field goal and maintained a lead the rest of the game. The first half ended 20 to 12 in favor of Davidson. Guilford made a desperate attempt at a comeback in the last half and outplayed the local quint, but the work of Hengeveld kept pace with them. Davenport also did good work in the last half. For the visitors, Babb, at guard, and Jones, at forward, featured. In his first game with the Varsity, Davenport, for Davidson, played a good game at forward. Hengeveld caged seven field goals, while the floor work of George King was up to its usual standard. King was far and away the fastest man on the floor. The guarding of McAskill and McAllister was good, but good teamwork was conspicuously absent.

**The line-up:**
**GUILFORD.** **POSITION.** **DAVIDSON.**  
Zachary .......... LG .......... McAskill  
Babb ............. RG .......... McAllister  
Groome .......... C .......... Hengeveld  
Jones (C) ........ LF .......... King  
Walser .......... RF .......... Davenport  

Referee: Romefelt.  
Time of halves: 20 minutes.  
Substitutions: Newlin for Babb.  
Field goals: King, 7; Hengeveld, 7; Davenport, 3; Zachary, 1; Groome, 3; Jones, 3; Walser, 2.  
Foul goals: Jones, 6; King, 2; Hengeveld, 1.

**DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N. C., FEBRUARY 6, 1918.**

**General Davidson’s Grave Unmarked**

**Mountain Mission Work is Described**

**Revolutionary Hero Was Buried at Hopewell Church.**

The man for whom Davidson College is named lies buried near here at Hopewell Church. This man is Gen. William Lee Davidson, “who, in the ardor of patriotism, fearlessly contending for the liberty of the country, fell (universally lamented) in the battle of Cowan's Ford.” Recently a party of interested Davidsonians, through the aid of Alexander’s History of the Hopewell Section, was able to locate the resting place of the patriot. Extending the length of the grave isa bench of brick which, having been constructed more than a century ago, is now crumbling into decay. Sleeping beside him is his daughter-in-law, Mrs. W. L. Davidson, Jr., this grave making it possible to identify the one of the Revolutionary hero. General Davidson, in a skirmish with Cornwallis’ forces, was killed at Cowan's Ford on February 1, 1781. Probably to prevent detection, his remains were brought and interred at midnight in the present grave. He was a young man—full of vigor and loyalty. A bright future was clipped at thirty-five years of age. The Government has erected on the Guilford Battle Ground to his memory a granite arch costing $5,000. There is also a college of noble-spirited young men, a large percent of whom may die in the same way fighting for the ultimate diffusion of democracy, who are glad to be known as Davidson men. It is fitting that the Government should commemorate his valor. It is peculiarly fitting that a college—world known—should be named in his honor. The spot where he lies buried is neglected, unmarked, and little known. To have gained such distinction in battle and to be commemorated in sculpture and in the embodiment of Christian education as he is, there should be a monument or slab identifying his grave from its surroundings. To all Davidson men, this should be a shrine to which they should go and pay reverence. It is one thing to be overtaken with a fault, and another thing to overtake it. -P. Henry.

Work in Kentucky
G. C. Bellingrath, the speaker at the Y. M. C. A. Mountain Mission meeting last Thursday evening, upheld his reputation as an orator. His talk dealt with the mountain people, their customs, and the particular features of life in Dry Fork, Letcher County, Ky. The country is some of the roughest in the State. Bellingrath, with several other Davidson men, spent last summer up there teaching and preaching to the people. To say that his talk was interesting is putting it mildly. His description of the mountaineers, their simple life, and their ignorance was very vivid. He mentioned the fact that many college students can do the work and they need men every summer. It is not a life of luxury by any means, but the good that can be done and the novelty of the experience should lead at least a few Davidson men to go up there this summer, as the need will be greater than ever before.

DEBATING FINALS NEXT MONDAY NIGHT
The finals for the intercollegiate debating teams will be held in Shearer Hall next Monday night, at 7:30, at which time the men to compose Davidson's debating teams this spring will be selected. The subject for this debate is, “Resolved, That the Federal Government should permanently own and operate all interstate railroads of the United States.” The speakers for the affirmative will be, in order, as follows: R. W. Cousar, J. A. Thames, J. R. Woods, William Love, and G. C. Bellingrath, and for the negative, F. I. Knight, W. C. Cumming, A. S. Potts, W. M. Currie, and J. I. Fowle. The students and townspeople are invited to attend the contest.

ADDRESS NEXT TUESDAY
Dr. J. Moore McConnell has agreed to talk to the members of the Civic League on next Tuesday, the 12th of February, on the “War Aims of President Wilson.” All the women of the village are invited to hear this address at 4 o'clock, in the Club hall. The regular business meeting of the month will follow Dr. McConnell’s speech.

CONSECRATION MEETING OF CHRISTIAN ENDEAVOR
The consecration meeting of the Christian Endeavors for February was held Sunday night, February 3rd. The meeting was led by J. A. Thames. In discussing the topic, “Winning Others to Christ,” the following idea was brought out, that of all the great problems we have to deal with today, the problem of spreading Christianity is by far the greatest, and this can best be done by personal work. When people are won to Christ we must put them to work. We must not only win them, we must keep them. The topic pamphlets will be given out next Sunday night.
