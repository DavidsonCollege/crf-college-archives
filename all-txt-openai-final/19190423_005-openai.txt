EVERY ALUMNI A SUBSCRIBER OF THE DAVIDSONIAN

There is nothing that draws the alumni and college together better, that portrays college life and spirit, that stimulates “pep” and interest in athletics and other college activities, than a good, live college paper. The Davidsonian is such a paper. During its six years’ existence, it has steadily grown, sometimes against strong opposition. It is not satisfied to stop at this point, but greater effort than ever before shown will be exerted in the year 1919-1920 to make The Davidsonian rank among the best of American college papers. To place the Davidsonian among the foremost college weeklies, it is necessary to have the complete backing of the Alumni, Students, Faculty, and Friends. Next year there will be a larger space devoted to the Alumni Department. We trust that every alumnus will cooperate with this department and help to make it an interesting feature of the paper. We are beginning a subscription campaign. Our goal is: “Every Davidson alumnus a subscriber to the Davidsonian.” The business department is going to exercise every care to ensure every subscriber a paper every week. The subscription rates will be the same as this year, $1.25 for the collegiate year. Remember, no skips, larger, brighter, and more brilliant than ever before. Do not put off today what you can do tomorrow. Send in your subscription now.

WHO WOULDN'T?

On Johnny's first day at school, he was given a registration card on which his mother was to write his birth record. The following day he arrived tardy and without his registration slip. “Johnny,” said the teacher, “you must bring an excuse for being tardy, and don’t forget the slip about when you were born.” All out of breath, next day Johnny rushed in holding a note from his mother. “Teacher,” he gasped, “I brought the one about being tardy, but I forgot my excuse for being born.”—Mother’s Magazine.

A MIND READER

Pat had got hurt—not much more than a scratch, it is true, but his employer had visions of being compelled to keep him for life, and had adopted the wise course of sending him at once to the hospital. After the house surgeon had examined him carefully, he said to the nurse: “As subcutaneous abrasion is not observable, I do not think there is any reason to apprehend tegumental cicatrization of the wound.” Then turning to the patient, he asked quizzically: “What do you think, Pat?” “Sure, sir,” said Pat, “you're a wonderful thought reader. You took the very words out of my mouth. That’s just what I was going to say.”—Current Literature.

SYSTEM MUST BE RESPECTED

A Chicago teacher gave a boy pupil a question in compound proportions for home work one evening, which problem happened to include the circumstances of “men working 10 hours a day to complete a certain job.” The next morning the unsuspecting teacher, in looking over his pack of exercises, found one pupil’s problem unattempted and the following note attached to the page: “Dear Sir, I refuse to let my son James do this sum you gave him last night as it looks to me like a slur on the eight-hour system. Any sum not more than eight hours he is welcome to do but no more. Yours truly, Samuel Blocksky.”

GOOD IDEA

Jones was at the theatre, and behind him sat a lady with a child on her lap which was crying unceasingly. Unable to stand it any longer, Jones turned smilingly to the lady and asked, “Has that infant of yours been christened yet, ma’am?” “No, sir,” replied the lady. “If I were you I would call it ‘Good Idea,’” said Jones. “And why ‘Good Idea’?” said the lady indignantly. “Because,” said Jones, “it should be carried out.” It was Jones who had to be carried out.

NO ACCIDENT

In a small West Texas town out in the Cap Rock section, interest was centered about the registration booth. A cowman clicked up to the official in charge and gave a well-known name. “Ever have any accidents?” “Accidents? Nope!” “Never had an accident in your life?” “Nope. Rattler bit me once.” “Don't you call that an accident?” continued the questioner, eyeing the easy-going young fellow severely. “No. The darn thing bit me on purpose.”—Saturday Evening Post.

TOO SHORT A TIME

“Have you ‘Kissed Me in the Moonlight’?” he asked the young lady behind the counter. The young lady gave him a startled look and replied: “It must have been the girl at the other counter. I've only been here a week.”

TOO EFFECTIVE

“The sermon you preached the other Sunday on thrift had a great effect on me,” said Griggs to the minister. “I went out before the collection.”—Christian Register.
