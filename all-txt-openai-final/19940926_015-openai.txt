Cowboy fans on college football

By Mike Wang & Dave Dwyer

Although we intend to address the fortunes of America’s team at some point in this article, in the interests of the various Davidsonian editors we have decided to broaden the scope of this column in order to review a wider spectacle of the world of sports. This week we will focus on the college football action for Saturday, September 24. Highlights: Michigan vs. Colorado, Miami vs. Washington, Notre Dame vs. Purdue, North Carolina vs. FSU, and Duke vs. Georgia Tech.

The Michigan-Colorado game yesterday will probably go down as one of the ‘94 season’s top five games. It’s likely you didn’t see the game, but you might have seen the highlights — Colorado threw a hail mary with a few seconds left and pulled off the miracle, stealing a 27-26 win from a Michigan team who has already beaten Notre Dame this season. The game was reminiscent of the pass Doug Flutie threw as Boston College stunned Miami during 1984. And speaking of Miami, they got stomped Saturday on their own field — something that hasn’t happened in nine years. Washington scored 22 points in a five-minute span during the third quarter and blew open a close game en route to an eighteen-point win. Finally, FSU beat Carolina in a game where the Heels had several chances to win, but failed to capitalize and lost 31-18.

But let’s be truthful here — the only purpose college football serves is to provide the Cowboys with even more talent than they already have. We realize, however, that last Monday night’s embarrassing loss to Detroit deserves commentary. Defeats are part of a season; often they make a team hungrier in its quest for a championship. Think back ten games to Dallas’ Thanksgiving Day loss to Miami. The Cowboys blew that one but surged to win their next ten games (excluding preseason), including Super Bowl XXVIII. Only once in NFL history has a team gone through a season undefeated (the ‘72 Dolphins), so we didn’t expect the Cowboys not to lose at some point.

Now looking ahead, the ‘Boys face the ‘Skins at RFK this Sunday in the best rivalry in the NFL. In the 68 games that the Cowboys have faced the Redskins, Dallas has been victorious in 37 of them. The biggest question this week is whether Norval will feed Heath to the devouring pass rushers of the Dallas line. Look for turnovers and time of possession to be key factors in this matchup, and look for a Dallas victory, 24-17.

Now to our weekly feature:
Last week’s answer: 1984, in the 12th Round.
This week’s question: What two teams have the Cowboys never lost to?

IMAC Update: flickerball and 3-on-3

Connor leads women's flickerball, Sig Ep's Woodward leads men's

By Jonathan Whitcomb

Fall at Davidson means time for another IMAC season. For those freshmen who haven’t learned about IMAC yet, the games sometimes reflect the real sports world. The true desire to play is frequently tested when your hall counselor pounds on the door at 12:45 for a 1 p.m. game, for example. But the games also have even tougher moments like kicking a chair across the sidelines after picking up your fourth foul in the first three minutes of the championship basketball game. In IMAC, there’s trash-talking, side bets by hall counse-lors and flickerball coaches, whining, fighting, and questionable officiating. In the fall, there are two major sports: flickerball and three-on-three basketball. Flickerball, as most know, is Davidson’s very own special version of football, and three-on-three is just like street ball, but the arena is the air-conditioned Baker Sports Complex.

In women’s flickerball, Connor is off to a strong start. In the first week of play, they beat Rusk 7-0 and squeaked by the tough freshmen team of 4th Cannon in OT. Kristen Kidd, a member of the squad, complained about the lack of upperclassmen competition, figuring that most freshmen are just playing to earn a PE credit.

In guys’ flickerball, there was a semi-rematch between a couple of teams in the freshman championship from a year ago. Four Kappa Sig members of last year’s second-place 3rd East hall took on a team dominated by Sig Eps, led by QB Brian Woodward of last year’s Basement Belk team. Once again, the Woodward team defeated the 3rd Easters to start their season off with a win.

Finally, in men’s three-on-three, the team of David Wick, Thomas Daniel, Chuck Grant, and Walt G stands out from the rest. They won their first game 21-14. When asked about the game, 6’7” Grant said that 40 minutes of varsity practice put him in the best shape of his life. Grant, one of the better players in the league, said, “if we come to play we’ll beat anyone.” A team led by Justin Paschal and Ken May could provide them with serious competition.

IMAC sports are a fun activity for many Davidson students, and they help bring many people from across campus together, providing good times for all involved.
