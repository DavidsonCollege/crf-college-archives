THE DAVIDSONIAN

Marcus Williams shows off his vertical leap during a recent football practice. The Wildcats, who return 15 starters and 50 lettermen, have a shot at back-to-back winning seasons — something that hasn’t been done at Davidson in 38 years.

Football squad looks to post back-to-back winning seasons. Win standard of seven not out of reach

In this, the 100th year of the program, the football team might actually have something to celebrate other than longevity. With 50 lettermen and 15 starters returning — including every player who threw or ran the football in 1996 — the Wildcats have a chance to post back-to-back winning seasons for the first time in 38 years, and have a realistic shot at breaking the school’s win record of seven.

Fullback Eric Ferguson, who set Davidson rookie records last year with 595 yards rushing and a team-leading 10 touchdowns, highlights a versatile ground attack. “Eric brings a whole new dimension,” Landis explained. “(Opponent defenses) are going to have to pay an awful lot of attention to him at fullback.” Which will, in turn, open more and wider holes for Lorenzo Moll, Nate Hagerman, and Bryan Kern.

Ben Spivey, who paced last year’s squad with four sacks, anchors the defensive front, and Cliff Henry, Chad Wright, and Donnie Johnson make up three-fourths of a formidable secondary. “As a whole team, this is the tightest, most close-knit group of guys we’ve had,” defensive coordinator Tripp Merritt said. “That’s what excites me.”

All of which has Wildcat gridiron fans, already giddy because of this season’s historical significance, thinking seven, eight, even nine wins — ridiculous numbers only two years ago when Davidson struggled through a mind-numbingly close-but-no-cigar 1-8-1 campaign.

Coach Tim Landis and his staff also welcomed more than 30 freshmen to summer training camp, as the roster ballooned to 84 — the largest number in years. “Even if it wasn’t the 100th year of football and we weren’t going to Tampa, we’d still be excited about this season,” Landis said last week.

Tommy Dugan, whose strong play in late October and November helped Davidson close 1996 with three straight wins, is poised to start at quarterback. But Matt Strader and Shaun Tyrance are pushing for playing time, creating healthy competition within possibly the Wildcats’ deepest position.

The skill positions are particularly well-fortified, and three tailbacks who are all entirely capable of contributing large chunks of yardage. Nine of the 11 Wildcats who caught a pass in 1996 also return, headed by Mike Harrington, whose 21 receptions were second-most on the squad.

The defense features a first-team line-backing corps of Shreve Ariail, Wes Thornton, and Chris Hess — last year’s three leading tacklers and a group Landis calls “the best in my time as head coach.”

“The Wildcats will play their 100th year of intercollegiate football this fall, and all signs point to a season to celebrate. The skill positions are particularly well-fortified, and 15 returning starters from a 6-4 club suggest Davidson will have back-to-back winning seasons for the first time in 30 years.” — Street and Smith’s

“Before we can concentrate on the win record, we’ve got to have back-to-back winning seasons,” Landis said. “That’s our No. 1 goal. If we get six wins real quickly, then we can adjust the bar.”

The players, though, are not nearly so cautious in their optimism. “The seniors keep upping the ante,” Ferguson said. “The other day, somebody said they wanted to go 11-0.”

“I think players believe again,” Merritt said, “people believe again, and coaches believe again.”

Centennial Season features celebratory Sewanee game and trip to Tampa

A century of anything is a big deal, and the athletic department and football program are treating the Wildcats’ 100th year of intercollegiate gridiron competition as such. The whole season — thanks to this year’s Wildcats, a promising bunch — has the potential to be memorable, but the actual so-called Centennial Celebration will take place in conjunction with the team’s Sept. 20 game against Sewanee.

The itinerary includes a luncheon at 11:30, a parade at 12:30, a buffet dinner at 6:00, evening activities at the Union, and receptions for Davidson football alums from as far back as the 1930s. According to football secretary Jeanette Scire, the parade — which will go from Main Street to Concord Road and then into Richardson Field — will feature various mascots from the area, including the Panthers’ Sir Purr; dozens of cars which will carry former Wildcat captains, most notably those of the 1935 squad; jugglers, horses, and floats. Little Miss North Carolina, Miss Lake Norman, and Santa Claus, of all people, will also make appearances.

Rock Deaton, who has not missed a Davidson football game in roughly four decades — a stretch that amounts to approximately 300 consecutive games — will serve as Grand Marshall. Crowd estimates from various sources — some more reliable than others — have ranged anywhere from 2,500 to 10,000. The eventual number will definitely be somewhere in between, probably a little closer to 2,500 than 10,000.

It all makes it quite easy to overlook the game itself. “It’s almost too much to comprehend,” coach Tim Landis said in an August press release. “This will be one of the great moments in Davidson athletics history.” Not to mention a grand opportunity for his Wildcats to possibly lose focus on the task at hand. “Hopefully, it won’t be that much of a distraction,” Eric Ferguson said. “We’re just focusing in.”On practice and getting the job done. We'll let the historical significance take care of itself.” Other schedule highlights include the traditional Fall Break game versus Washington & Lee, a road contest against Emory & Henry, and a Homecoming matchup with Methodist, which dealt Davidson its only ugly defeat last season. The slate concludes Nov. 22 with the much-anticipated Tilt in Tampa with South Florida, which will effectively begin Davidson’s effort to play a I-AA schedule. The Bulls, a I-AA scholarship program in its inaugural year of competition, boast transfers from South Carolina, Kentucky, Purdue, Florida State, Michigan State, and Duke. For the Wildcats, though, the game will represent a bowl game of sorts. “It will be a great way to end if we already have six wins,” Ferguson said. “Ten games is our regular schedule, and that’s our bonus game.”
