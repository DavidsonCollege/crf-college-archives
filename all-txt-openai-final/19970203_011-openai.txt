The Wright Stuff
Photographer of legend talks about exhibit and experience
By ASHER WOOD
Guest Writer

On January 30 at Davidson’s Visual Arts Center, Pedro E. Guerrero delivered a lecture about Frank Lloyd Wright, his former
employer and subject of his photographs now on display in the VAC. He took a modest approach to one of
the top architects of this century: “Don’t expect me to say anything profound about him ... our conversations were never
very profound.” He discussed many of his own personal experiences and recollections as Wright’s photographer. Early in the lecture, he
informed us that he would be talking and showing slides primarily about the person of Wright, rather than about his
architecture. Frank Lloyd Wright, considered the country’s greatest architect, is well known for the innovative architecture produced in his seventy-year
career, but most people know very little about him as a person. Guerrero gave us, both with his photographs and
lecture, a humble view of a legend, resulting in our appreciation of the subject of the photos and the photographer
himself.

After time spent studying photography in college, Guerrero followed the advice of his father and went to work in Arizona
as a photographer for Frank Lloyd Wright. “If I had known what a great man he was ... I probably
wouldn’t have fit in and wouldn’t have gone.” Luckily, he went, and his show at the Museum of Modern Art
ensued in 1940. In his 20 years of service as photographer, he photographed 27 of Wright’s architectural projects, as well
as many subjects in his travels with Wright’s entourage, including shots of traveling, architecture, model-making, the surrounding landscape, people working,
picnics, and even some pictures of Wright. These personal shots include scenes of Wright playing the piano, carving a pencil,
in a car, on a horse, at his desk, with his wife at a Halloween party, and many others.

The exhibition at the Visual Art Center’s Edward M. Smith Gallery, Frank Lloyd Wright: a personal view, features twenty-five black
and white images of Wright taken by Guerrero. Guerrero’s book, Picturing Wright, an Album from Frank Lloyd Wright’s Photographer, is
available for purchase at the Gallery. It is important to see Guerrero’s work in order to fully see Frank Lloyd
Wright; as he explained, “you can look up his architecture in the library,” but people are rarely able to see
who he really was.

Also on exhibit at the William H. Van Every Jr. Gallery in the VAC until February 27 is Robert Colescott’s
Works on Paper. The first African-American ever to be selected to represent the U.S. at the Venice Biennale single-artist exhibition
this summer, Colescott’s career will be surveyed by Christopher Wyrick (Davidson, ‘95) on Feb. 10 at 4:30 p.m. in the
VAC auditorium with a reception following in the atrium.

Palatable Pleasures
Put the sauce back in your life
By JEFFERY CROMARTIE
Chef-in-Residence

For some of us, our lives at Davidson are beginning to wrap up, and it is time to add the
finishing touches which turn a simple yet hearty meal into an extravagant work of art. The entree is steaming; the
side dishes are simmering, and the cheese has melted on the soup. All that remains is one final specialty which
will make your meal distinctive and memorable. In the culinary realm, I speak of glazes and sauces. Beyond the kitchen,
I speak of much more.

Many of my Davidson friends look back on their college trials and hardships with a certain level of bitterness. The
job market is as fierce as ever, and many of us question the practicality of a Davidson education. Our friends
at other schools have the same job opportunities and more competitive grades. They have the same entrees and side dishes,
yet the sweltering plague of grade inflation has sheltered them from the self-imposed rigors we as Davidson students have shared.
Self-imposed? — The faculty made us study like a bunch of monks, right? Wrong. The faculty is the single most
important group of people on campus. They are far too busy forcing each other to jump through bureaucratic and political
hoops to have any power over us. They very much love us, and they will go to great lengths to
serve us, but they have no real basis of power. Can they make a second...Semester senior really work? Nobody can.
Our teachers should be loved for their efforts, but only a fool would fear them. However, Physical Plant and the
Registrar have an ungodly amount of power and should be treated with extreme caution. Be very nice to these people
or your apartment could flood with sewage, and any record of your existence at Davidson could mysteriously disappear. Don’t even
try to tell me they haven’t thought about it.

So, we are back to questioning our self-imposed rigor. Why did we do this to ourselves? Are we stupid? Well,
not all of the time. Then why? Because everybody else was working hard. Peer pressure? Maybe in high school, but
free-thinking college students are less prone. Perhaps parental pressure. Come on, they can’t even make you chew with your mouth
closed. Uhh... my Don't skirt the issue. Why? Because we choose to do this. What drives you? A plain and
simple meal. Our minds and souls require much more. We are here struggling away at Davidson because plain grilled chicken,
baked potatoes, and peas are not satisfying. They are filling, but we yearn for more.

Are we spoiled? Intellectually, yes. Many of us can never return to our naive beginnings, where we could have settled
for less. We have tasted the fruit, and we are paying a very serious price. The spice has saturated our
blood, and we are very much addicted. The metaphor you choose matters little, but the glaze you create will be
with you forever. In our years dwelling in the garden of Davidson, we have by our own diligence gathered the
resources necessary for our own sauce. Each will be unique in flavor and zest. It is time to create from
what we have gathered. As gleaming twilight descends, it is time to feast with friends and be merry. Enough dogma,
let’s cook:

**Citrus-Ginger Glaze**
Toss together 1/4 cup low-sugar orange marmalade, 1 tablespoon honey mustard, 3/4 teaspoon ground ginger, 1/8 teaspoon ground red pepper.
Mix it up. This glaze works really well on grilled chicken over a bed of couscous.
