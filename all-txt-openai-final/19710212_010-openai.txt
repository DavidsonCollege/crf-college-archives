Following intensive interviews and group activities at Montreat, Feb. 5-7, the selection committee of the North Carolina Fellows program chose
13 freshmen to become members of this organization. The following were selected: James P. Alexander Jr., William W. Allen, F.
Douglas Brown Jr., Edward G. Connette II, Lynn L. Dean, Ronald L. Gibson, Jeffrey M. Johnston, Zeb B. Long, John
F. McCartney, Mack C. Mitchell Jr., Robert D. Phillips Jr., Thomas K. Redding, and Eric A. Vernon.

Sponsored by the North Carolina Leadership Institute, a non-profit organization, the North Carolina Fellows program is designed to stimulate leadership
development. Some of the opportunities made available to the Fellows are in the form of seminars, discussion groups, and lectures.
But each student is encouraged to seek off-campus experience.

**Freshmen Honors College House Receives Little Support**

**By DICK ANDERSON, Associate Editor**

The college proposal to transform the Carolina Inn into a place for the Honors College, presently located in the Eumenean
Hall, arouses little passion among Honors College members.

“If they're going to renovate the building, I have no strong feelings one way or another about who gets it,"
said Dr. Earl R. MacCormac, Professor of Philosophy and Honors College Faculty member. “We don't need it. We would like
kitchen facilities and more space, though,” said MacCormac, implying that these would be provided by the renovation scheme.

Honors College Dean Frontis W. Johnston said that the honors group was aware of some questions which had been raised
in connection with the proposal and had discussed them. According to him, some persons are concerned with the psychological effect
of removing the Honors College from the campus proper, which might create an impression of purposeful separation.

“We have no desire to be an elite group,” he said. “I'd like to see them do something with the
building,” Johnston added. “I am very pleased with the plan that has been drawn. I have no further suggestions whatever.”

Recently, the Carolina Inn has been used by a group of young townspeople as a “teen-canteen” for social activities. Johnston
said he would like some more space.

**Coeds (Continued from p. 1)**

The trustees also directed that Queens College be studied as a possible avenue for the implementation of co-education. Davidson and
Queens appointed a joint committee to consider such a proposal, but the...committee, according to Spencer, has not been active because
“we were caught in other things in the fall.” Spencer emphasized that the committee will be more active in the
future, how- dining room, kitchen facilities and seminar room, which the Carolina Inn renovation would provide. Unlikely ever, Spencer also
said that he felt the present coed exchange program, which brought 10 women from four Virginia schools to Davidson in
the fall, has been successful. The present renovation of Gray House on Main Street is primarily for the present co-ed
exchange program,” Spencer said, and should not indicate any immediate plans by the college to go coed: in the form
of summer internship in business, government, or institutional activity. The Fellows will indicate the type of summer activity they hope
to pursue, and the Institute seeks to place them in such positions. “We’re not interested simply in getting the interns
summer jobs,” said John T. Rowell, president of the North Carolina Institute. During their four years at Davidson, these freshmen
will experience three summer internships and be exposed to a variety of other activities.

Spring Studies Offer Options
By DAVID HANIG
Copy Editor

Writing a one-act play, fly-fishing, going on an archaeological dig in Palestine or the U.S., a log of readings in
science and mathematics, and working with a trade union are all possibilities for fulfilling the Extended Studies requirement listed in
a guideline released to students yesterday. Over 200 projects are listed in “Extended Studies 1 and 2: Guideline II,” prepared
by the Office of the Vice-President for Academic Affairs. Included in the guideline are the regulations affecting Extended Studies. Most
Extended Studies options are more conventional than those above. The student may still take an area examination, a regular course,
or do a project of his choosing. Typical topics are a study of the impact of new science on 7th
century culture, war and the Christian conscience, allied intervention in Russia, and the east-west cleavage of Charlotte. Another Extended Studies
option will be a project or examination based on the scripts of the Clark “Civilization” series, which will be shown
at Davidson from April 14 to May 26. Extended Studies will be considered the equivalent of regular courses in quantity,
quality, and content, usually taking 150 hours to complete. Extended Studies have been designed for completion in the spring term.
A student may, with the permission of the appropriate area committee, complete the Extended Studies during any other term if
there is sufficient reason to do so. Extended Studies projects will be graded on a pass-fail basis by whatever means
the student, the sponsoring professor, and the area committee agree is appropriate to the nature of the project.
