The DAVIDSONIAN, April 3, 1918

LITERARY SOCIETIES SCHEDULE

Debate, Saturday night, April 6: Resolved, "That Japan should intervene in Siberia."

Philanthropic—Affirmative: F. L. Knight, Story. Negative: C. W. Worth, Neel. Declamation: Spence. Oration: Knox. Extemporaneous debate—Affirmative, Hamilton; negative, McClure.

Eumenean—Affirmative: P. Cumming and Flinn. Negative: Burgess, Craig, and Frierson. Declamations: Heizer and Harrell.

The question debated in the Phi Society last Saturday evening was: "Resolved, That the Government of Great Britain is more
democratic than that of the United States." A. I. Currie and C. Howell supported the affirmative, while J. L. Fowle
and L. L. Wilson upheld the negative. The debate was a very short one, as the rebuttals were omitted on
account of the Lyceum attraction. The judges rendered their decision in favor of the affirmative. The extemporaneous debate was entirely
omitted. G. D. Sample gave a very interesting declamation on "The Liberty Bell."

Saturday night’s debate was the snappiest in the Eumenean Society this year as there was only a half an hour
between the roll call and time for the Lyceum entertainment. William Love and R. L. Liston, on the affirmative, brought
forward the following points: In Great Britain there is no supreme court in which five men can decide the constitutionality
of a law; in the House of Commons, a man must voice the opinions of the people, while in Congress
a representative can vote any way he thinks best. The negative side, represented by J. B. Woods and G. M.
Robson, won the debate with the following arguments: That in Great Britain there is not equal representation; that the House
of Lords is a very undemocratic institution; and that the electorate of Great Britain is not as democratic as that
of the United States. W. B. Sullivan and J. R. Boulware gave declamations. "Tribute to Henry W. Grady" and "Unveiling
of the Washington Monument" were the selections rendered.

MATTERS OF PRONUNCIATION

How do you pronounce cantonment? Some people call it can-tonment, some can-ton-ment, and some can-toon-ment. The first is preferred by
the Century Dictionary, the second by the Oxford English Dictionary, and the third by the Standard Dictionary. The last-named authority,
however, has an advisory committee of eminent orthoepists, to whom words of disputed pronunciation are submitted, and a large majority
of these have voted in favor of can-ton-ment. Can-toon-ment is said to be the favorite pronunciation in India. An old
spelling of the word is "cantoonment."—Outlook.

HEAR GOOD MUSIC

Music students should lose no opportunity to hear the best music, both vocal and instrumental. Heard with understanding ears, one
good concert is often worth a dozen lessons. Yet many students know nothing in music beyond what they themselves have
practiced, or what their fellow students give at rehearsals or recitals. Trying to gain a musical education without a wide
acquaintance with the literature of music is like attempting to form literary taste without knowing the world’s great books.—A. W.
Moore, in For Every Music Lover.
