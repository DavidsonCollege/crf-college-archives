What do T.C. & Chimp have in common? They made the gutty call and joined the College Bowl Team!!

Now you too can join this elite group of fine-tuned student “athletes.” Due to the departure of at least three
starting members (Gordon, Edwin, & T.C.), the College Bowl Team is in dire need of some superstar replacements. If you
are a freshman, sophomore, or junior with the ambition of defeating North Carolina and Duke (just like Louisville did last
year) along with the dedication (practice at least twice a week) needed to accomplish these goals, sign up in the
Union lobby this week for tryouts. Tryouts will be held the week beginning Monday, Feb. 9 with the final team
selection before the end of the term. This is a sincere plea for qualified applicants, so if you really want
to be part of an exciting team and go on lots of fun trips with free food and lodging, make
the gutty call and sign up now. Signup deadline is this Friday so don’t wait to sign up on the
San Antonio Spur-of-the-moment, sign up now!!

If you have any questions, contact Dr. Epes at EXT. 275 or Jeff at -6198.
