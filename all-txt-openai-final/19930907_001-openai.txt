On Monday, August 30th, the Corella and Bertram F. Bonner Foundation of Princeton, New Jersey announced that it is giving
Davidson a gift of $4.92 million. This gift, the largest single contribution to a scholarship fund in the college’s history,
will permanently establish the Bonner Scholars Program on the Davidson campus and will count toward the $150 million goal of
the five-year Campaign for Davidson.

Along with this gift, the Bonner Foundation has challenged Davidson to raise $1 million to be used for a scholarship
program for twenty students in each entering class. “We plan to raise this additional money which will supplement the Bonner
Foundation’s generous gift through Davidson alumni, corporations, and other foundations,” said Toby Bethea, Director of Institutional Advancements.

Bethea cited the school’s very successful Bonner scholar program as the main reason for the foundation’s gift. Davidson’s Bonner program
is now entering its third year. In addition to Davidson, six other institutions received similar gifts. They are: Berry College,
Concord College, DePauw University, Emory and Henry College, Spelman College, and the University of Richmond.

Those involved in the Bonner Scholars programs devote ten hours a week to community service with special emphasis on working
with children as tutors and mentors. They also attend orientations and workshops focusing on service and leadership on campus and
in the community.

Bonner Scholar Elizabeth Fleming '95, who volunteers at the Florence Crittenton Home, says, "Through the service work I've done with
the program, I've learned that we all have gifts we can give our community and we can all make a
difference."

Davidson’s Bonner scholars program provides need-based scholarship support for students who are willing to perform community service as part of
their college experience. The gift will provide aid for 75 students.

### Freshman Class Exceeds Expectations
**By Mandy Curtis**

The largest class Davidson has ever seen arrived on August 26 to begin freshman orientation. 452 new students from 40
different states and 15 foreign countries spent their first days at Davidson in lectures, meetings, and mixers. The anticipated number
of students in the class of ‘97 was 420, and as of last June, the Admissions Office had heard from
471 students planning to enroll in the fall. However, the number decreased to the final enrollment of 452. The Admissions
Office did not go to the waiting list this year as has been done in the years past.

The male to female ratio is almost 60/40 in the new class. According to Dean Terry, the gap between men
and women is “larger than we projected.” However, with more women than men in the class of ‘96, the overall
balance of the student body has been retained.

The large class was difficult to house this year, according to the Residence Life Office. 63 freshmen came to school
knowing the name of not one roommate but of two. This year there are 21 triples, four rooms of women
and 17 of men, in Belk, Little, and Cannon.

Some classes have also been affected by the number of freshmen. According to Dean Terry, the biggest problems have been
in biology and math, which sophomores and juniors have needed to fulfill requirements. Terry said that because all upperclassmen get
picks of classes in the spring, many freshmen have not been able to get a few of these required classes.
“There has been a problem in science, where you can’t raise the ceiling due to the number of lab spaces,”
said Terry.

Davidson is gradually increasing the total enrollment of the student body; however, the class of ‘97 does not affect that
increase. According to John Kelton, chair of the Enrollment Committee, the College has projected an increase to 1600 by the
year 2000. The size of the new class was not intended to hasten the process, and next year’s class will
be smaller.Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

were valedictorians of their high school class; 50% scored between 1200 and 1300 on the SAT; the average high school
class rank was in the top 5-10%. In the class, there is an all-state violinist, a published novelist, a nationally
ranked figure skater, many varsity athletes, and over 40 senior class presidents. “My impression is that they are a very
good group of people, very enthusiastic,” comments Dean Terry. Kelton remarks, “We’re delighted. We give Admissions an A+ for recruitment.”
In the President’s Welcome address to the class of ‘97, Dean of Admissions, Nancy Cable Wells presented the freshmen. According
to Wells, “Each of them is ready for the rigor and the joy of academic challenges and personal growth that
lies ahead of them at Davidson.”

Ben & Jerry's finally to open on Main St.
By Mary McCrory

Chocolate chip cookie dough...rainforest crunch...cherry Garcia...chunky monkey... Flavors like these have been the rallying call of discriminating ice cream consumers
everywhere. For years, Davidson students in search of a Ben and Jerry’s store had to drive into Charlotte to have
Vermont’s finest on a cone. Soon, however, Ben and Jerry’s ice cream will only be a short walk away. No
date has been set for the opening of the store at 202 South Main Street yet, but owner Phyllis Schultz
hopes to open “as soon as possible.” She will not give any date for the opening, because much work is
left to be done on the store to comply with strict county health codes.

Schultz, who also owns the two Charlotte stores, has been interested in the Davidson area for some time. “I liked
having my stores be part of a community, and strip centers don’t offer that,” she says. Her new store will
occupy the space where Tinkham’s Curiosity Shop used to be, but Schultz considered other locations, too. Before property on Main
Street became available, she considered building a kiosk in front of the Post Office. She was reluctant to go through
with such a plan, because not everyone was pleased with it. “There was controversy over giving up that park-like space,”
Schultz explained. Luckily, Tinkham’s became vacant at just the right time. “It isn’t just a summer ice cream place,” she
says about Ben and Jerry’s, "We like to think of it as an ice cream café.” Although ice cream will
be prevalent, the store will also offer freshly baked cookies and brownies, as well as hot chocolate, espresso, cappuccino, and
coffee.

Inside This Week

Enriched LOL enjoys sixth summer
By Leigh Rawdon

Love of Learning had yet another successful summer program. The 1993 four-week program held in July saw not only a
well-planned and valuable experience for its students, but also witnessed tangible benefits which included an endowed scholarship for graduates to
attend Davidson, a significant financial gift from Nationsbank, and a visit from a Washington Post columnist.

Davidson College trustee W. Olin Nisbet II and his wife Marian established a four-year scholarship available for one Love of
Learning per graduating class. The $300,000 endowment provides the first Nisbet scholarship for Jermecia Beachem who grew up in Charlotte
but spent her last two years at Scarsdale High School in New York working with the STEP program (Student Transfer
Educational Plan). Beachem credits the Love of Learning program with preparing her “to do college level work, ... dealing with
homesickness, and living with a roommate.”

On July 11, Nationsbank sponsored a Sunday afternoon packed with barbeque, music, and team-building activities for Love of Learning students,
family, and staff. The picnic on Chambers lawn provided an opportunity for Nationsbank to present $250,000 to the program designed
to prepare...
