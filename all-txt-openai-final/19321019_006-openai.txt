Lewis Defeats Gold to Win Tennis Tournament
Winner Has Gained State-Wide Honors in Former Matches

The annual Freshman tennis tournament was brought to a close last week when Carlyle Lewis, after a hard-fought match, defeated
Thomas Gold, 7-5, 6-0, 6-2, thus capturing for himself the title of Freshman champion, held last year by “Skip” Brown.

Lewis won his way to the semi-finals by defeating Bell, Lindsay, and Bowman. He encountered very little trouble until his
match with Bowman, whom he finally downed after four sets had been played. Gold, on the other hand, seemed to
have had more trouble defeating Wells, Dillard, and Barnette, downing the latter after a match ending in the score of
6-2, 2-6, 6-1, 6-8, 6-3. Therefore, the Freshman team this year will probably consist of Lewis, Gold, Barnette, and Bowman.

The winner gained state-wide recognition when he was runner-up in the junior singles in the Middle Atlantic tennis championships held
in Charlotte during the past summer. He also paired with Earl Ruth of Charlotte to capture the doubles crown. Lewis’
home is in Davidson.

The results of the complete tournament are:
First round: Hassell defeated Cassady, 6-3, 6-3; Bowman defeated Goodykoontz, 6-1, 10-8; Lindsay defeated Morrow, 6-3, 6-4; Lewis drew a
bye; Bell defeated Murray, 6-1, 6-2; Marvin defeated Griffen, 6-3, 2-6, 8-6; Barnette defeated Dudley, 7-5, 7-5; Gold defeated Wells;
Dillard drew a bye; Morrow defeated Williams, 7-5, 6-2; Lewis defeated Bell, 6-3, 6-2, and Dillard defeated Morrow, 6-4, 10-12,
6-2.

In the second round: Bowman defeated Hassell, 9-7, 3-6, 6-4; Lewis defeated Lindsay, 6-1, 7-5; Barnette defeated Marvin, 6-1, 6-0,
and Gold defeated Dillard, 6-2, 6-3.

In the semi-finals: Lewis defeated Bowman, 6-4, 1-6, 6-0, 6-2, and Gold defeated Barnette, 6-2, 2-6, 6-1, 6-8, 6-3.

In the finals: Lewis defeated Gold, 7-5, 6-0, 6-2.

DAVIDSON WILDCATS DEFEAT V. M. I.

ference, shot off tackle for 25 yards and a touchdown. Neither team used the aerial attack with any marked success,
but one completed by V. M. I. proved the feature of the evening. Billy Smith, standing on his own seven-yard
line, hurled a beautiful pass to Jack Walker on Davidson’s 41-yard line. Walker was injured on this play when he
was tackled by Mackorell.

Straub and Captain Kostainsek were the best gainers for the Cadets and carried the brunt of their attack which at
times looked very impressive, but were able to register only six first downs to Davidson’s nine. Hilliard proved to be
the star linesman for the Cadets and on more than one occasion threw the ’Cat ball-carriers for losses.

Davidson’s second and final score came in the fourth quarter while V. M. I. was trying frantically to score by
the air route. The Cadets punted from deep in their territory to Wingfield who again made a beautiful run, returning
the ball to V. M. I.’s 22-yard line. Then, pushed back against their goal line, they tried a fatal pass
which Hand intercepted and went two yards for another touchdown. Neither try for extra point was successful.

Line-up:
V. M. I. Position Davidson
Brel ____________ R.E. ___________ Morris
Kaylor __________ R.T. ___________ Whitfield

early in the third period, when after a steady drive down the field “Wood” Burns tossed a pass to Cumbie
over the goal line. Ed Slaughter cracked center, and went over for the extra point, placing Davidson in the lead
at 14 to 6. Wofford received, but being held for downs, punted out. Davidson then started another touchdown drive, which
ended in another seven points when Pearce scored.

on passes in the final stanza, but were repulsed, and the game ended Davidson 21, Wofford 6.

We buy the finest, the very finest tobaccos in all the world—but that does not explain why folks everywhere regard
Lucky Strike as the mildest cigarette. The fact is, we never overlook the truth that “Nature in the Raw is
Seldom Mild”—so

“If a man write a better book, preach a better sermon, or make a better mouse-trap than his neighbor, though
he build his house in the woods, the world will make a beaten path to his door.”—RALPH WALDO EMERSON

Does not this explain the world-wide acceptance and approval of Lucky Strike?

BRING ’EM BACK ALIVE
Nature in the Raw—as portrayed by the vicious battle between the python and the tiger... in Frank Buck’s thrilling motion
picture, “Bring ’Em Back Alive,” filmed from nature in the Malay jungle.

...and raw tobaccos have no place in cigarettes. They are not present in Luckies... the mildest cigarette you ever smoked.
These fine tobaccos, after proper aging and mellowing, are then given the benefit of that Lucky Strike purifying process, described
by the words—“It’s toasted”. That’s why folks in every city, town, and hamlet say that Luckies are such mild cigarettes.
