So far away, America’s number 1 pizza made students an offer:

If your delivery company group orders more pizzas than competing groups, you'll win a free pizza party!

---

It’s so easy to play. Call your nearest Domino’s Pizza store for details.

---

The Contest:
Domino's Pizza will award free, 30 large pizzas and $50.00 cash for liquid refreshments to the group purchasing the most
pizzas starting (date) and running through (date).

---

The Rules:

1. Carry-out orders and all deliveries made from your area’s Domino’s Pizza store will be counted if we are given
your group’s name and address.
2. Any pizza over $10.00 will be counted twice.
3. The winning group’s name will be published in the local newspaper.
4. The location and time of the party will be convenient to both the winners and Domino’s Pizza.
5. The 30 pizzas will be two-item pizzas. The winner will have the choice of items. The pizzas do not
have to be the same.
