Senior Averages

The Registrar's Office has announced the senior averages of the class of ‘41. The following men are listed according to
their scholastic standing: Chase Brenizer, 3.204; D. W. Talmage, 3.202; Casey Jones, 3.132; Hank Bahnson, 3.102; John Moore, 3.048; Bill
Loffin, 3.010. According to these averages of above 3.000, the above students will graduate with the honor of summa cum
laude. Fourteen others have averages of better than 2.500 which will entitle them to the honor of receiving cum laude.
These men are: Eldridge Brown, 2.985; Paul Bumbarger, 2.945; Ed Maxwell, 2.817; Pat Hobson, 2.811; Bill Boyle, 2.750; Joe Liles,
2.725; Lawson Withers, 2.592; C. G. Howie, 2.590; W. H. Hamilton, 2.581; Francis Magill, 2.570; Louis Hite, 2.568; W. Summerville,
2.560; Ted Leinbach, 2.52.

With the publication of his latest book, “Swamp Water,” on February 19, Vereen Bell, class of '32, brings to a
climax a brief but rapid rise as a writer. Dr. Williamson showed the modern attitude toward God, toward sin, divine
law, and toward Christ. The modern attitude toward God is that He is a God whose patience has limits and
that He is a God who punishes evil, metes out justice, and governs the world. This attitude is false, Dr.
Williamson said, because it is based on an erroneous view of God as a loving Father who punishes those He
loves.

The story of “Swamp Water” was first serialized in “The Saturday Evening Post” and is now in book form for
the first time. Bell was for several years assistant managing editor of “The American Boy” but resigned to devote all
his time to writing. His stories and articles on dogs and outdoor life have been accepted by the leading magazines
of the country.

The story centers around the adventures of a boy, Ben Kagan, a swamp dog, and a murderer. The book portrays
the primal emotions of people who live close to the earth and whose chief struggle is for their very existence.

Modernists also believe that Hell does not exist because God is a loving Father who would not punish His children.
This belief is erroneous, Dr. Williamson said, because it is based on a false view of God as a loving
Father who does not punish those He loves.
