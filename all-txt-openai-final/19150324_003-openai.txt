Dress Your Ankles
Home Is The Best Place to Practice New Steps
A little practice at home works wonders in giving you grace and certainty in executing the new dances. But you need the right kind of music. The very thing for the latest dances is among the new player music now in.
Let us play the latest one step, Fox Trots, etc., for you on the Stieff Player Piano. It will open your eyes to the pleasures which are in store for you when you own a Stieff Player Piano. Call tomorrow and ask to hear them. While you are here we will gladly explain how you can apply your old piano as part payment and take your time paying the balance. No interest or extras.
