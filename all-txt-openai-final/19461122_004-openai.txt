DR. THOMAS
(Continued from Page 1)

In pointing out that rationalization is the first step in bending the will of God to suit personal interests, Dr.
Thomas presented the three steps in Eve's fall to sin at the instigation of the serpent: doubt that God had
forbidden eating the fruit, the fact that God would really punish her, and the fact that the value of knowledge
of good and evil far outweighed the minor detail of violating God’s commandment.

Little has changed his branch of service from the Tank Corps to the Air-Plane Drivers Association and 30,000 feet is
the closest he has come to earth since. The Big Day will be a post-graduation affair. Also in the air
lanes this weekend was Brother Strickland on his big-dealing way home to Atlanta and a date with Jeanette (of the

B. McGehee, and Pledges Cloaninger and V. McGehee) for having seen action at the dance Sat. night. “Mmmm” was all

With the winter days growing shorter, and the weeks apparently longer, the K. A. men are beginning to appreciate weekends
more than ever. Personal reports of a “fine dance” could be heard from certain sleepy-eyed individuals at Sunday dinner. Among
those singing praises of the Queens Formal were Brothers Hardin and Harris, and Pledges King and Byrd. Others headed north
for the Twin City with Salem College as their destination. Brothers Ed Manget and Clayton Scofield, and Pledge Charlie Mitchell
were looking tired but happy Sunday evening. On up to Virginia went Brother Art Lindsay. Rumor says he was last
seen taking snapshots at Randolph Macon. Taking that inevitable trip home were Brothers Mahone to Dunn, Sam Barnwell to York,
S.C., and Bob Flowers to Columbus, Ga.
