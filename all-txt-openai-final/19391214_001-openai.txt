Dr. Carl Friedrich Journey’s End Will Lecture Here
Harvard Professor of Government Comes From Old German Family of Nobility

NATURALIZED AMERICAN
Lecturer and Educator Is Also Noted Author

Dr. Carl Joachim Friedrich, Professor of Government at Harvard University, will speak here in Chambers Auditorium on January 4, 1940,
under the auspices of the Political Science Department. The exact hour of the lecture is yet unannounced.

The speaker was associated with Heidelberg University before coming to Harvard. He comes from an old German family; his father,
a physician, was killed in World War I; his mother came from a family of nobility. Dr. Friedrich first came
to the United States fourteen years ago as a lecturer at the invitation of a group of progressive students at
Harvard. Deeply attracted by the American scene, he left Heidelberg to accept a call to Harvard in 1926.

Naturalized
Since coming to the United States, Dr. Friedrich has become a naturalized American citizen. He married an American woman and
is now a citizen. He owns an estate in Vermont, where he spends a part of his time. He is
an ardent Christian.

His courses at Harvard, covering a unique range from abstraction to concreteness, include political theory, comparative institutions, propaganda, and the
legislative process. For years he has been concerned with civil service training; he is on the Faculty of the Graduate
School of Public Administration. A prominent lecturer in forums and contributor to leading journals, Friedrich has taken a controversial stand
as an educator. The subject of his lecture is indefinite as yet. Among his books are “Constitu- [Continued on Page

R. C. Sheriff's War Drama Is Given By College Theatrical Group

Holidays Begin
Davidson's Christmas Holidays will begin Friday at noon when the college dormitories will be closed as college recesses. On account
of the fact that some alterations will be made in the dormitories, it will be necessary for boys staying over
during the holidays to make special arrangements for rooms. The dormitories will be reopened for occupation Monday morning, Jan. 1.
If any student plans to return to school before January 1st he should be sure to have reservations made accordingly.

Musical Davidson-Queens
Pfohl Is To Direct Groups

Last night, Wednesday, December 13, at eight o'clock in Chambers Auditorium, the Red and Black Masquers presented the drama, “Journey’s
End.” This play, written by R. C. Sheriff, is a very famous war drama which was brought to New York
with its original cast in 1929, after being successfully produced in England. Sheriff's play dominated the theatrical season on Broadway
in 1929 with a long series of brilliantly successful performances headed by Paul Muni.

Act One
“Journey’s End” is largely made up of the taking over by Captain Stanhope and his Company of a section of
the front line trenches. In this act, most of the characters are introduced. Captain Stanhope, the company commander, is a
young officer who has been at the front for three years. He is a man of great courage but is
beginning to show signs of strain. Lieutenant Osborne, his second in command, is an older man who acts as a
father figure to the younger officers. Lieutenant Raleigh, a new arrival, is a young and enthusiastic officer who idolizes Stanhope.
The act ends with the men settling into their new quarters and preparing for the coming battle.

Act Two
The second act shows the men on the next day. They are getting settled in their new quarters, and the
strain of trench warfare is beginning to show on them. Stanhope becomes increasingly irritable and drinks heavily. He has a
confrontation with Raleigh, who is shocked by the change in his hero. The act ends with the announcement of an
impending raid on the German lines.

Act Three
In the third act, the raid takes place. Osborne is killed and Raleigh acquits himself like a hero. Stanhope drinks
himself silly, then has another run-in with Raleigh. The long-expected German attack finally comes and all the officers are killed.
The play ends with the trenches being overrun by the Germans.

Cast of Soldiers
The cast was as follows: Captain Stanhope, Rhea Tenney; Lieutenant Osborne, Dan Gilliam; 2nd Lieutenant Raleigh, Sam Spencer; Captain Stanhope,
Rhea Tenney; 2nd Lieutenant Hibbert, Ed Hay; Sergeant Major, Boyd; Flynn, Colonel, Dave.
