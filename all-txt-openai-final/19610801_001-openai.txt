C. Shaw Smith, Director of the College Union, is again among us. The Smith family, via Volkswagen Microbus, have been sightseeing across the country on a combination camping and show tour.

Mr. Smith is one of the top magicians in the southeast, and we understand that he has pressed the whole family into the act. His legerdemain is well known to the Union staff, as he has been known to appear out of nowhere at the most unpropitious times.

However that may be, we welcome his return to the Union after a long absence.

**THIS WEEK'S MOVIE**

The movie to be shown this Friday night at eight o'clock in the ballroom is "On The Waterfront." This movie, starring M. Brando, has collected many kudos and is one of the best samples of cinema in circulation today.

**MIDWEEK BREAK**

The break this week is to feature lemonade and the Slater mixture of crackers, cookies, potato chips, and goodness knows what all.

Also, we are looking forward to the return of our fine hostesses, who have done so much to improve our breaks in the past weeks.

So, remember - the chow is free and so are dreams. Come one, come all.

**CAROLINA CULTURE**

We are often quick to condemn North Carolina as a cultural desert, but a look around us is proof of the opposite. The summer is the season for theatre and Charlotte is not the only place to go in search of entertainment.

The summer theatre in the western part of the state is a must for anyone who is genuinely interested in drama and above-average entertainment.

All this is brought on by the editor's introduction to arena theatre this past weekend. The Silo Circle Playhouse was the site of this introduction, and "The Seven Year Itch" was the vehicle.

We were surprised at the number of Davidson students that we met there, and pleased at their reaction to the Silo. It seems that one has to see arena theatre only once, and he is hooked.

But, after one performance, we felt that it was not only arena theatre that was unique; the Silo cast and staff have a spirit that is catching.

These are pros from New York, yet they are not the "fat cats" that staff so many summer theatres. We got the feeling that this was a cast that measured its success in rapport with the audience, not in box office receipts.

If ever a Saturday rolls around and you have nothing to do, I recommend the eight o'clock performance of the Silo Circle Playhouse of Black Mountain, N.C.
