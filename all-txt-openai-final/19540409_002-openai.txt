THE DAVIDSONIAN PAGE TWO

Student Council Weakened By Recent Lack of Student Support

After five days of investigation and questioning, the now infamous drinking case was brought to a conclusion by the executive
committee this week. Few people were satisfied with the final disposition of the case, but few also could agree on
what should have been done. It is indeed unfortunate that the Student Council was unable to handle the case itself.
Any shipping penalties it might have inflicted would have been accepted in a much better spirit by the student body
than were those decreed by the executive committee of the faculty.

The whole issue brings into sharp focus, not only the problem of student drinking, but also the serious question of
effective student government. It is hard to see how this case can help but affect the status quo here in
regard to student government. The Student Council has suffered from it, and perhaps lost a great deal of prestige in
the student body at large. This is not, however, the fault of the present Council any more than it is
the fault of the last several Student Councils, and not nearly so much the fault of either as it is
the fault of the student body as a whole.

During the time this writer has been at Davidson, it has been fairly obvious that the student support of the
drinking rule is relatively weak, and growing weaker. We have elected officers part of whose duty it is to enforce
the drinking rule, and left it entirely up to these representatives to catch whom they can—or will; but we have
decided that under no circumstances will we aid or abet the enforcement of this rule. Consequently, violations became more open,
if not more frequent. The old analogy of the chain being no stronger than the weakest link can easily be
applied to the student government situation in this case. The presence of a rule that the student body will not
uphold, even if the majority do not violate it, weakens the whole system of student government. Therefore, the student body
can either wipe this rule off the books, leaving the matter to the tender ministry of the faculty, or they
can reaffirm that they think their rule is still a valuable one by conforming to it and supporting it, regardless
of whether or not they think there is any moral question involved in drinking.

These are indeed crucial days for our Student Council; it can either rethink and consolidate its position, or it can,
like the Arabs, take up its tents and silently steal away. Without the support of the student body, it may
as well do the latter.

OFF-MOORINGS: THE DAVIDSON STUDENT BODY, FEELING MORE OR LESS SOMETHING OR OBLIGATED TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON ANOTHER, DOES SO
BY STAGING A RIOT OF SORTS.

There is a strong temptation just now to write on “reflections of a Davidson chapel speaker,” or something to that
effect. After yesterday’s experience, coupled with another last spring, I have a much greater appreciation for those who have been
on the receiving end of catcalls, whistles, hisses, boos, and other assorted heckling devices for lo these many years. The
most obvious conclusion one can make is that the Davidson student body as a group is the most unkind, the
most ungentlemanly, the crudest, the most uncouth, the most vulgar, the most childish group of adolescents masquerading as men ever
to be assembled in the name of higher education. I will refrain from making these comments, for they have been
brought out earlier by others, and in more eloquent language than I can produce.

Campus Drinking

There is a topic about which I wish to write which has caused considerable comment and which had something to
do with the riot of Tuesday night. That is the matter of the recent drinking cases and the subsequent shipping
of several members of the student body.

Letter to Editor: By JIM MOORE

In rights and privileges which make any violation of rules here different from a violation of laws elsewhere. We have
rights as a citizen bestowed on us that make for an entirely different interpretation of the privileges which we have
as students. There are rules here which are: (1) set by the student government as set forth in its constitution;
(2) those which the faculty, administration, or trustees set; and (3) the rules which common practice and gentlemanly precedent establish.
There is in the case of drinking on the campus a rule from each of these sources to cover the
point involved. Thus, there is little recourse for those who violate the rules and suffer the consequences.

I believe Jesus disappointed His nationalistic followers in Jerusalem and his disciples when he came out for nationalistic obligations in
the questioning of the coins. He said, “Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s and unto God the things
that are God's.” Some of the same precepts may be applied here. If we live under laws which are unacceptable
to us, we should try by every political means possible to have the laws changed, but we do not have
the right to protest when we suffer because of refusing to testify.

The Riot

The motives and actions of a riotous mob are rarely good things to behold. It was a curious combination of
spring revelry, seeming oppression, and taut nerves from reviews that prompted the one this week. The most reprehensible and inhuman
action that I have ever witnessed occurred in this riot. The policeman from Davidson and the one from Cornelius publicly
gave their sanction to allow the man in the pickup truck to drive through the crowd and try to hit
some students so as to “break up the riot.” There has been of late no more flagrant disregard for the
public interest as this in which these public servants gave their permission to intended manslaughter. Now if the college does
not come forth and press charges against the man who attempted the murder of a number of students and does
not request the firing of the two policemen, it will be discarding its obligation to students and its own honor.

Students Should See Difference In Our Privileges And Rights

Being a Christian gentleman, but we do not have the right to protest when we suffer because of refusing to
testify.

Cynicism Chief Characteristic Of Present Davidson Student

The band swings into the last number on its program, “O Davidson.” As the members of the student body recognize
the melody, curious things start happening. One student almost knocks his classmates over getting out of his seat and heading
for the aisle, others follow him. There is an audible murmur, a moan, a hiss, a boo, and finally a
general turmoil. Within a few moments, the senior section is almost vacant, and others are leaving too. What do they
mean insulting our intelligence with emotive appeals to that thoroughly bestial sentiment that some call school spirit? Everybody knows that
Davidson, long known for its—shall we say, “undergraduate enthusiasm”—has now outgrown such childish trivialities. Her students smirk at those few
naive lads, who profess attachment for this college and anything for which it stands.

This is not an editorial about school spirit, but about Davidson cynicism—skepticism about all things connected with Davidson College. The
little incident in chapel served to point up the real unrest and dissatisfaction which at the present time is the
chief characteristic of the student body. There is scarcely asoul in the upper classes who in the presence of his
fellows will profess even conditional admiration for most of the things for which Davidson stands. There are perhaps a few
believers left, but they have been brow-beaten into timidity by the majority. This is, of course, an overstatement in many
respects, but not nearly so much of an overstatement as some members of the student body, administration, and faculty would
like to believe. What we have here is more than a healthy, critical attitude; it is a genuine mistrust of
the purposes of the college, if not an open hostility. What's wrong? We confess our ignorance. One important and pertinent
fact is that Davidson College is a different school from what it was 30 years ago. The student body is
more urbanized and more sophisticated, and less willing and able to conform to many of the traditions of the college.
This has been brought home all too clearly in the recent drinking case. Personally, we have a deep attachment for
Davidson College and for its underlying principles, but with that attach-

PUBLISHED WEEKLY THROUGHOUT THE COLLEGE YEAR

To the Editor:

Election time at Davidson College for the three years I have been here has always been something of a farce.
Sincere candidates have analyzed many of the needs and desires of our student body and proposed definite action. Upon election,
I am sure that they have tried to fulfill their promises and aspirations. However, the same issues are the promises
of their successors, e.g., more representative government by the student body president, non-compulsory Y-membership and more student participation in the
Y by its president, and greater coverage of student opinion and activities by the editors. This definitely points up a
problem. There must be some reason why little is ever done with the leader’s ideas. I think we can say
that it is not the fault of the leaders; many would say that it is on account of our stern,
parental faculty, president, and board of trustees—who hold life and death sentence over our diplomas and future security. I would
say that the fault resides

never in my experience here expressed coherently or cogently our desires. We have never foreseen any coming changes. We have
only become indignant and “shadow boxed” after we have felt that we have been treated unfairly. Davidson College is a
business. Its customers are students, its employees the faculty, and its directors the board of trustees and the Presbyterian Church.
If this analogy has any validity, we can further say that no one party in the business desires to treat
any other party unjustly—providing all parties accept their responsibilities. Here the analogy breaks down in the light of competitive business.
The faculty and directors do assume a parental and advisory position—but not in the destructive sense. The students, once here,
are almost in a monopolistic market. However, the students are responsible for a portion of the business. The business of
making our college more pleasant for students and improving the environment for education is our job. Where we can

First of all, let me make clear one point so that we may proceed unhampered by the fetters of faulty
precepts.

No one has to come to Davidson. It is a privilege which we are allowed to enjoy. So you must
first of all begin with the assumption of the students’ being in a position of having privileges which are bestowed
on them by the college. This is an important difference. Further, an extremely unhealthy aroma will be cast over the
