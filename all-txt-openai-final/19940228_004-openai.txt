THE DAVIDSONIAN NEWS MONDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 1994

Continued from last week

A 1934 Alumni Journal article described the ten groups (their increase a testament to their growing popularity) as being “scattered from Mount Mourne to Cornelius, dwelling in anything from rented hovels to mortgaged mansions.” The housing might have dissatisfied a few of the chapters, but something else irked the administration. Students had taken advantage of escaping on-campus supervision by holding house parties and inviting young ladies from around the area to join them. Townspeople thought this quite a travesty. Remember, the stodgy, Presbyterian Davidson of the late twenties did not allow dancing, drinking, or any other sinning. Not only would the sinner be damned to hell, but the faculty would make sure he no longer matriculated at Davidson in the meantime. The faculty thought even the mild parties off campus provided dangerous moral and social diversions for the student body. Not for long, though! College administrators (rather than the faculty) enacted a plan to purchase the off-campus houses and build new chapter lodges together on campus. The idea was to get all students together in the dorms and to give every chapter equal floor space under a semblance of college supervision. In 1928 fraternities sold their houses to the college and moved on Fraternity Court, known now as Jackson Court. While not anything special today, nothing like this innovative plan had been tried before. Eventually, many schools, including Presbyterian College,

Former Davidson basketball player Perry “Rocky” Crosswhite helped snare the 2000 Summer Olympics for Sydney last September as Secretary General of the Australian Olympic Committee. Crosswhite, who is also a member of the Olympic Planning Committee which will have a principal role in organizing the 2000 Games, shed light on the Olympic movement and international sports on February 23 in the 900 Room. Crosswhite views gigantism as the “greatest challenge facing the Olympics.” The extensive process of obtaining an Olympic Games for a city can be exhausting both politically and financially. In September, Sydney won the games by a one-vote margin over Beijing in voting by International Olympic Committee (IOC) members. Another difficult task for the Olympics, according to Crosswhite, is maintaining the universality of the games. He worries that the western world dominates the Games in terms of events entered and number of successful athletes. “How do you make sure it belongs to the rest of the world, and did it ever?” he said. Crosswhite also discussed the commercialization of the Games as a potential problem. He cited the compromise made at Barcelona

in 1992 when TV officials insisted that Olympic officials change the time of the marathon which had been scheduled for 8 a.m. He also expressed disappointment with the inclusion of NBA players in America’s “Dream Team” in Barcelona. "As much as I don’t like it, I think it [the inclusion of professionals] is right. I got bored, quite frankly, but I’m in the minority.” Crosswhite then explored drugs as a problem plaguing Olympic competition. China and many Soviet-bloc nations still have not implemented drug testing with their athletes. The IOC faces the problem of ensuring that testing is comprehensive and effective. The final problem, according to Crosswhite, is the role of politics in sports. "It’s a challenge to have enough politics so that the Olympics remains in the same place, but not too much, so that it remains sport.” He explained that the “Olympic mystique is what makes the Olympic games important and fascinating.” Crosswhite praised his Davidson education and its effects on his life. “I’m proud to be from this college. It taught me how to think, if nothing else. It taught me I can have some effect in the world.” He admitted he did not have all the answers to the problems of international sports but insisted that he is “a strong believer in the Olympic movement. It is one of the few things that links nations today.”

Seniors count on apartment RLO continued from page 1

person in order to get a four-person apartment or break up the group. Planning was as important as luck in the lottery. In addition to filling out her own application, seniors like Melissa Ream, whose apartment mates for the fall are all abroad this semester, had to complete the application and make sure that their deposits were paid. She says she “worried even though there were more than enough apartments available because if one person in the group did not pay the deposit on time“Then none of us would get an apartment.” Among those who were fortunate enough to get Martin F apartments for the fall, there is some uncertainty about whether the apartment will be ready. Laura Jordan was at first “very excited to get an apartment but later began to worry because of rumors about past apartments not being ready in time for the start of school.” Senior Sally Stone, who lives beside the construction site, has observed that “the foundation for the apartment has not yet been laid, but construction workers have been working daily from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. to meet the fall deadline.” Sink reassures all future Martin F residents that she has "every faith that the apartment will be ready on time.” The majority of rising seniors are unconcerned and just glad that the whole process is over. Sandra Castle, who will live with three other women from her freshman hall, is glad to see their “freshman plan to get an apartment together materialize. After planning for an apartment, it is good that there are enough available for all seniors who want one, so that it no longer boils down to having good numbers.”

The fraternities found the arrangement agreeable, although not until after some initial balking. The College charged a yearly rent and billed each two-room brick house for light, water, and steam heat from the College Plant. This was no problem, but the fact that the houses had no eating or living facilities initially bothered many. Davidson professor and Phi Gam chapter advisor Thomas Lingle saw another problem. “A great deal of publicity has been given through the press to the group of eleven houses,” he wrote in a 1929 fraternity periodical, "but this fails to impress the 64 percent of our students who do not belong to fraternities, and for whom the college has provided no social center as yet. It appears certain that the present arrangement is drawing a sharper line between fraternity men and non-fraternity men than has ever been drawn before at Davidson."

Yet the system in practice satisfied students more than expected. Chapter finances remained low for years thanks to this system of College ownership and maintenance, claimed a 1934 Alumni Journal article. Furthermore, keeping all 650 students in the dorms together allowed independents and the various fraternity men to get to know each other beyond chapter boundaries. The close proximity of the court houses also fostered a competitive spirit between houses. Whether or not the article was right about that, this period of intense fraternity activity marked golden years for almost every chapter and saw increased academic averages, a plethora of awards for different competitions, and highly successful recruitment. At the same time, fraternities could have house parties with female guests, but dances had to stay in rented facilities in Charlotte. The success of this arrangement for the students and for the administration led to its expansion in the form of Patterson Court thirty years later. But Lingle’s fears still persisted: independents remained outside the social life. Nothing except the expansion of college programs and the growth around Davidson could alleviate that fact, although the administration tried. Today the abatement of that problem continues, while fraternities still live in the same housing arrangement established here 65 years ago.
