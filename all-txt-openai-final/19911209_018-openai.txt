Women’s Hoops Falls to Mt. Olive

Coach John Filar’s women’s basketball team opened regular-season play with a defeat at Mt. Olive. In the game, the Wildcats
received a fine individual performance from senior center Faison Nuckolls. Nuckolls recorded a triple-double, with 27 points, 15 rebounds, and
10 steals. Fellow senior Skye MacLeod added 17 points and junior Jennie Wagner 11 for Davidson. The team fell to
0-2 with a loss Friday at Barton. The Wildcats are off until January 9, when they travel to Meredith for
their final scrimmage. Davidson returns home January 15 to face Methodist.

Men’s Basketball Meets Warren Wilson Tonight

Off to a 2-2 start after a trying 70-69 overtime loss to William and Mary a week ago, Davidson’s men’s
basketball team faces Warren Wilson tonight at 7:30 in Belk Arena. Warren Wilson, an NAIA Division I team and a
member of the Tennessee-Virginia Conference, was 1-7 through December 3. After the game, Davidson begins a three-week layoff for exams
and Christmas; the ‘Cats next play December 30 at South Carolina.

Harris Named Big South Rookie of the Week

After fine performances in Davidson’s first two games, against Alabama and Methodist, freshman guard Frank Harris was named the Big
South Conference Rookie of the Week for the week ending December 2. Harris scored 10 points on 4-4 shooting from
the floor, passed for 2 assists, and blocked a shot against the Crimson Tide. Against Methodist, Harris led the team
with 21 points (10-13 from the field) and 6 assists. Through Davidson’s first four games, Harris is averaging 12 points
per game.

Hockey Players Selected to Southeast and National Tournaments

By Jennifer Roos

In addition to winning the Deep South Tournament, nine Davidson players were selected to represent the Deep South at the
Southeast Tournament in Baltimore. The Deep South sent three teams to the tournament: a collegiate team, a club team, and
a mixed team of college and club players. For the second consecutive year, more players from Davidson were selected than
from any other school or club team. Emily Coleman, Fran Fierro, Suzanne Hardesty, Simone Plaisance, Jenny Plowright, Jennifer Roos, and
Jacquelin Ukrop represented Deep South I, and Jill Bennett and Erin Lang represented Deep South II. Coleman, Fierro, Plaisance, and
Roos were chosen for the Deep South All-Tournament Team.

W&M Continued from page 17

...a blowout. Detlef Musch twice dunked after catching lob passes as the Wildcats assumed a 15-6 lead. But the Tribe’s
second unit brought them back, scoring 14 points in succession to take a 20-15 edge. Davidson ended the half with
a 13-6 spurt to regain the lead. Senior tri-captain Paul Drobnitch put in a pair of offensive rebound baskets in
that span, and Frank Harris’ layup with :02 remaining in the half gave the Wildcats a 28-26 advantage at the
half.

The second half was hard-fought; after William and Mary took a seven-point lead with 13:40 to go, senior Sterling Freeman
led the Davidson comeback. In eight minutes of action, Freeman scored 5 points and captured 7 rebounds, 6 of them
offensive. His layup gave the ‘Cats a 58-56 cushion with 3:36 left, and his free throw at the 1:39 mark
sent the game into overtime.In the extra session, Janko Narat gave the Wildcats their last lead, 63-62, on a reverse
layup with 3:37 left. In the next two minutes, though, while the Tribe’s offense executed and scored, Davidson’s did not.
Scott Smith’s fading jumper gave W&M a four-point lead they would not relinquish. The Tribe missed several late free throws
to give the ‘Cats a chance, before Holloway’s bid for a game-winning shot went awry. For Davidson coach Bob McKillop,
the way in which the Tribe took Musch out of the game in the second half was decisive to the
outcome. “They [W&M] came out in the second half and attacked us in the paint,” he said. “That wore down
Detlef. He got tired and moved off the block.” Consistently in the second half, Musch was pushed outside his comfortable
shooting range and his shots fell short. He finished 4-12 from the field. Another important factor in the loss was
Davidson’s 8-16 effort at the free throw line. William and Mary was only a little better, at 10-19. Holloway led
the team with 16 points; Harris and Ron Fisron added 10.

Four Davidson players elected to have selectors watch their play in an attempt to be selected for the National Field
Hockey Tournament in Cocoa, Florida over Thanksgiving break. Coleman, Lang, Roos, and Ukrop were selected and played nine games against
other teams from around the nation over the holiday. Last year Davidson players Mary Russ and Erin Lang competed in
the National Tournament. Fierro and Lang were the only Wildcats playing in their second National Tournament.
