After winning their last meet at home on Sunday against the Virginia Military Institute, the Wildcats continued their Southern Conference
home swing against the Spartans of UNC-Greensboro. UNC-Greensboro came into the meet with a record of 2-1 in the Southern
Conference and 2-10 overall, so the Wildcats knew it would be tough to get a win and move their SoCon
record up to 2-1.

The match started at the 285-pound weight class. The Spartans’ Joe Sheffield defeated Charlie Wolff ’11 by a score of
15-3. This gave Sheffield’s team an early overall lead of 4-0. In the 125-pound weight class, Mitchell Johnson defeated Ben
Altman ’10 by a tally of 11-4, which extended the Spartans’ lead out to 7-0. Alex Radsky ’11 at the
133-pound weight class was able to force an overtime period, but Casey Boyle prevailed 7-5, giving UNC-Greensboro a lead of
10-0. In the 141-pound weight class, Vitaly Radsky ’11 was unable to stay with the Spartans’ Chris Bencivenga, and was
defeated 15-4, which gave the Spartans an overall lead of 14-0.

The Spartans extended their lead to 17-0 after the 149-pound weight class match, as David DeCamp ’12 was unable to
take down the Spartans’ Ben Wilmore. Wilmore took the match by a final tally of 8-6. The Spartans continued their
dominance in the 157 and 165-pound weight class matches. In the 157 match, Andrew Saunders took down Joe McGinley ’11
by a score of 11-0 and in the 165 match, Victor Hojilla defeated Tyler Mullen ’12 11-2. When these matches
came to a conclusion, the lead for UNC-Greensboro had been pushed to 25-0.

The Wildcats were finally able to get on the scoreboard after the 174-pound weight class match as Kevin Cook ’09
defeated Brett Miller 4-3, which cut the Spartan lead to 25-3. The Spartans finished the match in the same manner
as they started, by dominating the Wildcat wrestlers. In the 184-pound weight class, Mikal McKee defeated Sam O’Hair ’09 by
a score of 7-6. O’Hair wrestled valiantly but was unable to come away on top. McKee’s win pushed the Spartan
lead to 28-3. In the final match of the day, which was the 197-pound weight class, UNC-Greensboro’s Ryan Sughrue defeated
Jorge Estrada ’12. He pinned Estrada in 3:33, and this win gave the Spartans a final win of 34-3.

The Wildcats dropped a tough match to the Appalachian State Mountaineers Tuesday night 25-9. This loss brought their overall record
to 4-10 and 1-3 in the SoCon. In their next match, the ’Cats will take on Anderson University and Belmont
Abbey at Anderson on Feb. 13 beginning at 6 p.m.

Robinson reaches milestone, but losing streak hits six for ‘Cats

During the current six-game skid, the Wildcats have not witnessed any shortage of individual performances. But that’s just the problem—it’s
the intangibles, like how the team clicks and flows, that have kept the squad in a rut. Saturday’s match-up at
Wofford brought more of the same, as the team lost 72-86 while Mercedes Robinson ’10 eclipsed the 1,000-point mark for
her career.

Even fourteen minutes into the first half, the team showed no indication of letting the game slip out of its
hands. After a layup by Mandy Halbersleben ’09, the ’Cats tied the game at 33. One turnover later and Wofford
grabbed the lead 35-33 and held it for the remainder of the game. Up 48-37 at the half, the South
Carolinian rivals led by as many as 23 in the second half. Davidson could not make enough of a dent
in the lead to set itself for a comeback.

In dissecting the numbers behind this loss, the difference in shooting percentages stands out most clearly. While the Wildcats hung
around 40 percent from the floor for most of the game—a respectable tally—Wofford...

of the second half she became the 12th player in program history to score 1,000 points in her career.

...blow past Catamounts at home

The Davidson men’s basketball team continued its march through the Southern Conference by...Defeating the top three teams in the conference’s
North division over the past week, the Wildcats knocked off Chattanooga 92-70 last Wednesday, escaped Samford 55-52 on Saturday, and
overran Western Carolina on Monday by an 89-65 margin.

The Wildcats defeated Chattanooga behind 32 points from Stephen Curry ’10. Curry’s total included a 75-foot heave that brought the
first half to a close. The shot ignited a 13-3 run that allowed Davidson to take a 51-31 lead early
in the second half and essentially salt the game away. Curry was far from alone in excelling against the Mocs.
Andrew Lovedale ’09 continued his strong season by scoring 17 points and hauling in 12 rebounds. Fellow post player Ben
Allison ’11 added 12 points, while sharpshooters Bryant Barr ’10 and Will Archambault ’10 added nine and eight points respectively.
Stephen McDowell led Chattanooga with 17 points. Chattanooga was unable to capitalize on its large disparity in free throws attempted,
shooting only 60 percent (21-35) from the charity stripe while the Wildcats shot 80 percent (12-15). The sell-out crowd at
McKenzie Arena did see the end of one Wildcat streak, though. Nicchaeus Doaks’ basket 32 seconds into the game gave
Chattanooga a 2-0 lead and ended a streak of 238:22 of game time in which Davidson had not trailed. The
Wildcats came just short of extending their streak to the equivalent of six full games.

Davidson’s trip to Alabama to take on Samford proved to be much more eventful. The Bulldogs, in their first season
of Southern Conference play, fought tooth-and-nail and were only narrowly defeated at the end. Curry scored 20 points to lead
the Wildcats, but shot only 6-20 from the floor (2-11 from three-point range) and failed to score over the game’s
final ten minutes. Lovedale contributed another double-double with 13 points and 12 rebounds while Steve Rossiter ’09 added nine points.
Davidson looked as though it would leave the Bulldogs in the dust at the game’s onset, out-scoring Samford 22-5 to
begin the game. The Wildcats proceeded to go ice-cold from the floor, failing to hit a field goal over the
final ten minutes of the half and allowing the Bulldogs to close within 27-22 at halftime. Davidson opened up a
ten-point lead in the second half, but Samford closed the gap to one three times, the last on a layup
by Jim Griffin with 32 seconds to play that made the score 53-52. Barr hit two free throws to account
for the final margin. Trey Montgomery missed a triple with ten seconds to play but the rebound went out of
bounds off Davidson. Josh Bedwell’s attempt to tie was off the mark also and the ball landed in Rossiter’s hands
as the horn sounded. The game was gruesome statistically, with Davidson shooting 32 percent from the floor and Samford shooting
34 percent. Once again, free throw shooting was a critical statistic. The Wildcats were 13-14 (92.9 percent) from the charity
stripe while the Bulldogs were only 14-21 (66.7 percent). Curtis West led Samford with 13 points.

Davidson rebounded from Saturday’s sloppy showing with a clinical performance against Western Carolina. Curry scored 26 points (20 in the
first half) to lead five Wildcats in double figures. Barr and Brendan McKillop ’11 each hit four three-pointers on their
way to 14 points. Lovedale also scored 14 and added four blocks, while defensive specialist Max Paulhus Gosselin ’09 added
12 points. Davidson never trailed and was only briefly threatened. Up 13-9, Curry recorded a four-point play and would score
the next ten points for Davidson as the Wildcats opened a 49-31 advantage at halftime. The Wildcats continued to apply
their pressure in the second half, forcing 20 turnovers and opening an 86-48 lead with 6:34 to play. The Catamounts
shot 39.6 percent for the game and were led by Harouna Mutombo’s 15 points. The victories allowed Davidson to extend
its conference winning streak to 42.
