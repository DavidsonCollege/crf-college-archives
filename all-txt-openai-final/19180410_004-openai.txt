WOODROW WILSON’S POLICY DISCUSSED BY POLITY CLUB

At the last meeting of the Polity Club on Friday night, Professor Currie discussed a new book by Robinson and West on “The Foreign Policy of Woodrow Wilson.” The discussion covered Wilson’s dealing with the Mexican situation and his policy in regard to German aggression in the light of precedent and international law. The author showed not only how Wilson has modified and enlarged the Monroe Doctrine into a Pan American policy, but how he is holding up new ideals in international relations before America and the world.

Dr. J. M. McConnell then announced a prize essay contest on the book entitled “The Rebuilding of Europe,” by David Jayne Hill. This contest is open to any member of the Polity Club. The first prize will be $35.00, with prizes of $5.00 for the member of each club writing the best essay.

TENNIS TOURNAMENT SCHEDULED FOR THIS WEEK

The tennis tournament for the spring term will begin this week.Because of the failure of T. W. Hawkins, ex-'18, the fall champion, to return to college after the holidays, the student body has been without a championship team since Christmas. A number of teams have entered the tournament, and the prospects indicate that it will be more closely contested than last fall. Manager Hall plans to run the singles and doubles alternately, saving time in this way as well as adding interest to the tournament. The tournament will probably run well into next week, with the grand finals coming about Wednesday or Thursday.

T. B. Mitchell, '20, of Shelby, N. C., has gone home on account of illness.
