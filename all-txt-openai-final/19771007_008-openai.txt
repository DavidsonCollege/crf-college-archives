**Slug’s Tower**

It’s a long way to the top of the Jefferson First Union Building to get to Slug’s Tower, and I’m
not certain that it’s worth the trip. The only consistently great things are the view of Charlotte and the dessert
tray—each spectacular in their own right. A night meal affords the best view and the worst food. The night lights
are many and the portions puny. My eight-dollar entree tasted like it had been frozen and then reheated. The salad
was skimpy. The waitress was attentive and seemed to understand that it was more than pure appeal that caused me
to choose two desserts off the cart—I was still hungry after my main course. The dessert cart special is Black
Forest Cake—a scrumptious chocolate cake layered with cherries, liquor, nuts, and whipped cream. I also enjoyed some cheesecake, but I
was still so hungry on the way out that I grabbed more than my share of mints.

A visit to Slug’s Tower for lunch reveals the raunchy uniforms and strange ceiling decor, but low prices and large
portions are at their peak. There was no waiting even when the place was packed with business people. I wondered
about the crowd as I stared at the strangeness of the ceiling; it was incredibly tacky looking—notched boards hung haphazardly.
The waitresses’ uniforms looked awful by the light of the day. They were orange and very short-skirted—like Howard Johnson before
consciousness raising. A glance at the menu explained the patronage; the selection was great and nothing was over $3.50. My
personal favorite—a mound of sliced mushrooms with a slab of melted Swiss cheese and a hint of wine on top.
The price: $2.65.

**Jefferson First Union Plaza, The Liberty**

The Liberty Restaurant is an amalgamation of incongruent parts: a restaurant with diner fare; the look of a fifties’ hangout;
country and western tunes; and a Greek cook and owner who makes the best pizza south of Hoboken, New Jersey.
Avoid the dinner entrees; they're boringly handled and hardly a bargain. Pizza and very cold beer, which arrives in frosted
mugs, are consistent winners, unlike the basketball team you’ve probably come to watch play across the street at the Coliseum.
This is a great place for groups and worth the trip even if you aren’t in the area. (K.S.)

**The Little Kitchen**

For two dollars more you can have a real piece of meat and twice the atmosphere of King Sirloin, and
it is closer, too. The Little Kitchen, tucked away in a patio center in Mooresville, serves surprisingly good aged beef
and fresh, not frozen, seafood—and they don’t even fry everything. The prime rib is a specialty and arrives cooked to
order and butter tender, unless you’re a barbarian and insist on having it well done. The snapper, when available, is
especially good. The decorations are a mix of Rotary Club Luncheon and college camp, which makes for a schmaltzy feeling,
aided by the Hammond organ beating out shopping mall tunes in the background. A fair selection of decently priced wine
is available. Underutilized, it’s a fine place and especially good for couples. (K.S.)

**Diamond Jim’s**

The nicest thing about Diamond Jim’s is that it’s not bourgeois. It’s a bar and it serves food. The atmosphere
is dark, cozy, and smoke-filled...no frills. The waitress wears real clothes...no costumes. The menu is small, but the sandwiches and
salads are big and look like your mother just fixed them (they’ve even got pimento cheese sandwiches). The service is
slow (you may even have to go to the bar to order your food) because on the weekends, it’s so
crowded you can’t find a waitress and on the weeknights everyone's just ‘laid back’. But they’ve got a terrific sound
system and lots of beer to entertain you. And if you don’t cater to the rowdy...beer scene, they serve a
whale of a pina colada (if you bring your own rum). Prices are cheap, and there's no cover charge. The
first time you go, however, you must pay a $0.50 membership dues ($0.50 for an entire year). After that, flash
your Diamond Jim’s membership card. Good bars are hard to find these days. 1427 East 4th Street, 333-4745. (C.L.)

Big Daddy’s Seafood
Near home, Big Daddy’s has a plusher atmosphere than the fish camps and better food than most. It can’t compare
with Calabash or Charleston, of course, but for Iredell County it’s not bad. The salad bar is excellent, but salad
is $1.00 extra. Seafood is expensive, ergo Big Daddy’s is fairly expensive. Again, though, it’s not bad, and it’s only
about 10 miles away (down I-77, left on Highway 150 about three miles). (D.K.)

Great Wall of China
Probably Charlotte’s finest Chinese restaurant. While most others offer only Cantonese and a few Mandarin dishes, this eatery features culinary
delights from four regions in China. The old standbys like Egg Foo Young and Sweet and Sour Pork are available
as well as Mandarin items such as Mu Shu Pork (Chinese crepes), Seven Delicious Chicken, and shrimp with lobster sauce.
New to many people are the hot, spicy dishes from Hunan and Szechuan. Service is good, prices are reasonable, and
the food is excellent. 1600 Montford Drive, 525-5803. (D.K.)

Laura’s Rozzell House
Laura’s Rozzell House features lots of Southern cooked food in a kitchen-like atmosphere. Just a short ride out Highway 16,
Laura’s is a favorite of Davidson groups. Everyone is encouraged to eat as much as possible for a very reasonable
$4.50 per person. Although Laura’s loves large groups, please make reservations for all evening meals. (This is also true for
you solitary souls.) Laura’s is open Tuesday-Friday for lunch 11:30 am to 2:30 pm; Tuesday-Saturday for dinner 5:30 pm to
8 pm (until 10 pm Friday and Saturday); and Sunday lunch 12 noon to 3 pm. (O.W.)

La Strada
Charlotte’s home of Sicilian pizza, La Strada also offers some excellent other Italian items. The veal dishes are especially good,
and they can also do some delicious things with eggplant. The pizza here has built itself quite a following in
Davidson and is worth a try. The atmosphere is casual, and go early in the evening to avoid a line.
4808 Central Ave., 537-5123. (D.K.)

Gaylord’s
A fairly new restaurant located in the Tandur Inn Motel. Gaylord’s brings with it a respected name in Indian dining.
When it first opened, it was only the second Gaylord’s in the U.S., the other being in Chicago. Other Gaylord’s
restaurants can be found in London, New Delhi, Bombay, etc. The menu ranges from the familiar curries to all sorts
of authentic, exotic items, cooked in earthenware ovens or over coals. Jesse Bhattal, an international student from India at Davidson
last year, praised the restaurant’s authenticity and preparation; he recommended the combination meals which allow a sampling of a number
of dishes. 992-4800. (D.K.)

Slug’s Choice
Slug’s Choice in Southpark Mall is one of the finest restaurants in Charlotte. As one of the three Slug’s locations
in Charlotte, it offers a select menu of steak, seafood, and poultry. The salad bar offers more than greens; meats,
cheeses, vegetables, fruits, and even nuts are available as garnish. The darkly paneled walls and stark white place settings provide
a comfortably elegant atmosphere; the attentive waiters anticipated this diner’s every need. Considering the quality of the food and the
excellent service, Slug’s Choice is a perfect spot for an intimate dinner date. The prices are quite reasonable, better than
those at Blase B 8 Tower for food. Southpark Mall, 800-ACW. (C.L.)
