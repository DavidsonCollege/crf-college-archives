**Georgetown University Opens Baseball Season For Davidson Nine Today**

**Monk Younger Announces Probable Starting Lineup for Opening Tilt Here This Afternoon**

**KUGLER PROBABLY HURLS**

**Son of Famous Big Leaguer in Georgetown Lineup**

The Davidson Wildcats open their 1930 baseball season this afternoon, entertaining the Georgetown University nine, from Washington, D. C., in the curtain-raiser. Tomorrow the Oak Ridge Military Institute will give Monk’s men their second battle in two days. These two outfits provide one of the toughest assignments a Davidson baseball team has tackled in its opening games in a number of years.

Georgetown, which has gained nation-wide prominence through its great football teams, is bringing its baseball team South this year for preliminary workouts against colleges in this section before they tackle their difficult schedule against schools in their section. Although the club they are bringing with them has not brought the school the publicity that their gridsters bring each fall, it is reported that their grade of play is equally as high, and they will offer plenty of opposition for Monk’s men.

Evers, the second baseman of the Capitol city boys, is the son of the famous Evers of professional ball fame not many years previous. Evers, it will be remembered, was the keystone man of the great “Tinkers to Evers to Chance” combination of the Chicago Cubs in 1908. This team won the pennant in that year, and it was largely through the work of their infield that it was possible. Tinkers, Evers, and Chance formed one of the greatest infield combinations of all time, and became famous for the great number of double plays they engineered. The younger Evers is bent on following in his illustrious father’s footsteps, and takes care of second bag in approved style.

Oak Ridge, whom the Wildcats engage tomorrow, has been the team to provide Davidson its first opposition for a number of years. They always have one of the strongest prep school teams in the state, and have taken the measure of the Wildcats in more than one of their games in recent seasons. They are reported to have a team as strong, if not stronger than their club of last year, and will be no pushover for anybody. Everett Booe, manager of the Greensboro (Continued on page 6)

**Noted Lecturer John George Bucher, Lecturer on Central European Nations, who will speak here.**

**Bucher To Deliver Lecture Tomorrow**

Mr. Bucher was born and educated in Philadelphia. His ancestors fought in the French-Indian Wars and in the American Revolution. He is a newspaper correspondent, soldier of fortune, and lecturer. He saw service overseas during the World War and after the Armistice spent much time in central Europe doing relief work. Since 1921 he has devoted his entire time to travel, study, and lecturing on the central European nations. He has traveled widely in Germany, Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Yugoslavia, Italy, Austria, as well as France and England. This past summer he has made his sixth visit to Germany to take some new films and slides for his lecture season this year. His information is up to date and he combines the picturesque and medieval Germany with the latest and most authentic data of present-day conditions in Europe.

Mr. Bucher is lecturing in Chambers Auditorium at 7:30 o'clock Friday night, under the auspices of Davidson College and the Bureau of Commercial Economics of Washington, founded in 1913, which is a philanthropic educational institution with alliances with all the major governments of the world. Its purpose is to introduce nations to each other, to disclose by lecture and motion picture the scenery, the industries, natural resources, and the customs of the peoples of one nation to those of another, thus promoting international goodwill and friendship. Its films are shown in all parts of the world free. It has a corps of many speakers and during the month of November 1, 1928, to May 1, 1929, gave 900 free lectures in 825 cities and towns of the United States. In addition to the lecture service, the Bureau has many millions of feet of films, all scenics or educational, gathered from all parts of the world that are available to members of the Bureau. The Bureau of Commercial Economics is an altruistic educational institution without capital stock and not operated for profit. It is supported by voluntary contributions and memberships. Students, faculty members, and friends of the college are cordially invited to hear Mr. Bucher. The subject of the lecture is “Modern Germany.” It will be illustrated with slides.

**Annual Junior Speaking Is Successful Festival**

**South Carolina Co-ed Follies Furnish Entertaining Program**

Sponsoring a group of entertainments which made their week-end perhaps the most extensive of any ever held at Davidson, the class of ‘31 last Friday and Saturday gave the annual Junior Speaking. Committees working under the direction of C. H. Goodykoontz, president of the class, had by Friday made details complete for the series of features which made up the program. The outstanding features of the week-end which were essentially part of the Junior program were the South Carolina Co-Ed Follies and the Junior Minstrel.

The Co-Ed Follies made their Davidson debut at the entertainment held Friday night in the ballroom of the Hotel Charlotte where they presented a short number. The affair in Charlotte was well attended by the members of the student body as well as the Juniors themselves and their guests. Saturday afternoon a large number of people saw the feature game of spring football practice. The Davidson squad had been divided into two teams, the Army and the Navy. The contest was closely played and both teams showed plenty of fight and good form. The score at the end stood 7-6 with the Army victors by one point.

Saturday night, the most important innovation of this Junior Speaking was presented in the gym. A cabaret supper featuring the South Carolina Co-Ed Follies in their second appearance was given. Tables were arranged on the basketball floor to provide for nearly four hundred guests. At six o'clock, the doors were opened. Guests were shown to the tables reserved for them, and Freshmen, acting as waiters, served supper. Between the courses, the Co-Ed Follies rendered several numbers. At the conclusion of the meal, other skits were given, including songs, a monologue, and choral numbers. Under the direction of J. S. Meacham, S. W. Williams, and W. B. Hancock, the gymnasium had been decorated for the occasion in the class colors. Music was furnished by the Davidson orchestra. Following the cabaret supper at 8:15, the Junior Minstrel was presented in the Chambers auditorium. A chorus of sixteen dressed in red and black formed the body of the minstrel. J. S. Meacham acted as interlocutor between the end-men, W. W. Fraley, H. S. Covington, J. D. McCall, and R.M. King. Accompanied by the Davidson orchestra and the chorus, members of the minstrel gave solo acts, including songs, dances, and novelties. Amusement was kept at a high pitch by the jokes and stories of the end-men. R. M. King was chairman of the committee for this entertainment. The stage was decorated in red and black. The orchestra played from a platform back of the chorus.

Was Covington Elected “D” Club President?

H. S. “Hub” Covington, popular football and baseball player, was elected president of the “D” Club last Thursday night, March 13, to succeed E. B. “Doc” Kugler, captain of this year’s baseball squad. The other officers elected were W. B. “Bill” Goodson, vice president; Thad Brock, secretary; and W. A. “Nab” Armfield, treasurer. All of these men take an active part in other campus activities besides athletics. All of the officers are outstanding athletes. Goodson starred at guard on the basketball court this year, and is now beginning his second season as varsity second sacker on the diamond. Thad Brock captained the football squad this year and has made letters in both track and wrestling. Armfield is the varsity catcher on the baseball team.

New German Fraternity

A chapter of Delta Phi Alpha, National honorary German Society, is to be organized at Davidson. This honorary fraternity was founded a few years ago at Wofford College. With the Spartanburg College composing the Alpha chapter, the Beta chapter was formed at Central College, Missouri, the Gamma chapter at Bates College, Maine, and the Delta chapter at Vanderbilt University, Tenn. Davidson was invited to form the Epsilon chapter and has accepted. The installation of the society will be held sometime in the near future and the names of the German students who will compose the Davidson chapter will be disclosed at that time.

Doctor McAllister Is Vesper Speaker

Professor at Union Theological Seminary Makes Vivid Impression

“Use or Lose” was the subject of Dr. Gray McAllister’s talk at the “Y” Vesper service, Sunday evening. Doctor McAllister, a professor at Union Theological Seminary, at Richmond, Va., is especially well fitted to talk to the college man as he comes in contact with many of them every year. J. A. Jones read the scripture lesson and introduced the speaker, “Bob” Turner and “Rut” Nunan led in prayer and Mrs. Vowles sang a very beautiful solo. Doctor McAllister chose as his text Christ's warning just after the parable of the talents as Matthew relates it. “For unto everyone that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.” “Use means gain,” said Doctor McAllister. “As small boys, we often used to stand around and admire the mighty muscles of the blacksmith as he shaped the hot iron. To begin with, he was no stronger than the average man but continual use in hammering out the iron on his anvil had so developed his physique that no feat of strength seemed beyond him. “Faith is at the bottom of Christian life. All of us at times lament our lack of faith and wish for more, but how can we get it? The analogy of the blacksmith holds good here. If we use what faith we have to the fullest extent, we will automatically receive more. Do your duty and leave the rest (Continued on Page 5).

Davidson Debaters Elect New Officers

At a meeting of the Davidson Forensic Council last Wednesday night, the officers for the next fiscal year were elected. This was the main function of the meeting, as considerable time was taken up in the procedure. Since Davidson College was recently elected Secretary of the Dixie League of Forensic Councils, it was necessary to elect two secretaries of the local Council to take care of the many matters which might come up during the year. The following officers were elected: J. A. Jones, President; A. R. Bird, Jr., Vice-President; E. D. Kuykendall, Secretary; W. Rule, Secretary; P. S. Knox, Treasurer. The following are the retiring officers who have completed most successful terms: R. M. Christian, President; W. B. McGuire, Vice-President; A. R. Bird, Jr., Secretary; J. C. Matthews, Treasurer.

W. W. Fraley Eliminated By Bluefield, W.Va. Man In First Major Election

Other Spring Elections to Follow

President and Vice-President of Student Body

“Y” PRESIDENT IS NEXT

Heads of Davidsonian, Athletic Association, and Annual Follow

This March, Bluefield, W. Va., was elected President of the Student Body for the ensuing year. The final ballot was taken between Goodykoontz and W. W. Fraley. In the final vote taken on Saturday, C. H. Goodykoontz, of Bluefield, W. Va., was elected President of the Student Body for the ensuing year. The selections of the nominating committee were made known to the students on Thursday morning at chapel and as no more men were nominated from the floor, the nominations were closed. The following men were nominated by the committee: Dean W. B. Goodson, C. H. Goodykoontz, W. W. Fraley. When the first ballot was taken on Friday morning, Rusk and Goodson were eliminated. The following morning, the final vote was taken, Goodykoontz winning by a slight majority. Goodykoontz, better known on the campus as “Dan,” has been outstanding in athletics as well as in other activities, since his Freshman year. The three years which he has spent at Davidson have not been inactive ones for him. Among the honors he has received are: Captain of Freshman football, Freshman track, varsity football (two years), Student Council (two years), and President of the Junior Class. Goodykoontz is a member of Phi Delta Theta social fraternity. Since the newly elected President has already seen two years of service on the Student Council, he is in a position to handle the duties and responsibilities connected with his new office and should be able to manage all problems which will come before the Council during his term of office.

The election of the president of the student body begins the annual series of Spring elections, most of which are conducted by the student body as a whole. The president of the Y. M. C. A., nominated by the Y. M. C. A. Cabinet, is elected second in the series of elections. He will succeed the present president, Frank R. Brown. Next in order of election will come that of Editor of the Davidsonian. The Editor who will succeed Zeb V. Long, will be selected by the Student Body from the Staff of the Davidsonian, which is composed of the following men: J. B. Black, J. W. McCutchan, W. C. Ragin, and P. R. Alderman. This election will be of great interest to the Student Body. The president of the Athletic Association is also elected by the Student Body. Nominations will be received from the Athletic Council, and the nominees will be voted on by the students, each of whom is a member of the Athletic association. T. W. Brohard is the retiring president. After the Athletic Association elections will come those of the Senior Class, one of the two elections in which the entire student body does not participate. The officials will be elected by the present Junior Class, nominations of which will be received from the floor. Next in order will come the election of the Editor of Quips and Cranks, the college Annual. The Editor will be selected from the present contributors of the Annual, and the Senior Class will elect him. This is the second election in which the whole Student Body does not take part. The candidates for the Editorship are as follows: S. S. Wiley, A. R. Bird, J. V. D. Middleton, W. Wharton, and W. A. Rembert. C. M. Pratt is the retiring editor. Concluding Davidson’s annual Spring elections, which must be concluded by April 15, according to the school constitution, will come those of the rest of the classes, which will be sponsored by each individual class.
