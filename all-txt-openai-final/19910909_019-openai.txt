Armando Sanchez-Aballi Defies Conventions at Davidson

By Chris Hood

“I like to defy convention.”

For Armando Sanchez-Aballi, a 5-6, 165-pound senior defensive back on the Davidson football squad, this statement has proven to be a way of life.

When Sanchez-Aballi arrived on the Davidson campus as a sophomore, he was 27. Now, at the age of 30, he has earned a spot on Coach Dave Fagg’s team in his first year of competition.

This says much about Sanchez-Aballi and Davidson football. How many 30-year-old college football players are there on college rosters and where else could they play?

“We don’t do anything the standard way,” says Fagg, who led the Wildcats to a surprising 6-3 record last year.

In 1965, Sanchez-Aballi’s family moved from Cuba to Miami primarily to escape Fidel Castro’s rule. “We just tried to survive in this country,” said Sanchez-Aballi.

As a youth, Sanchez-Aballi’s football experience was limited to sandlots and playgrounds. “I always wanted to [play organized football] but I never had the opportunity,” said Sanchez-Aballi.

After graduating from Christopher Columbus High School in Miami at 18, Sanchez-Aballi set out to work in order to raise enough money for college. “I was sent to a good high school, then I was on my own,” said Sanchez-Aballi.

When he was 26, Sanchez-Aballi enrolled at a junior college in Jacksonville, Fla. His younger brother, Rafael, was a freshman at Davidson by this time.

During his freshman year, he applied to several four-year institutions in Florida. The decision to attend Davidson was made easier by Rafael. “My brother was nudging me to look here,” Sanchez-Aballi recalled.

Although Sanchez-Aballi was highly interested in Davidson, he was not guaranteed acceptance. “It took a lot of energy and effort to convince Davidson that I could adapt and be a contributing member of the family,” said Sanchez-Aballi.

In his first two years at the college, Sanchez-Aballi has been extremely active in extracurricular activities. Each semester he has worked as an Apprentice Teacher for the Spanish Department.

“I enjoy teaching very much,” said Sanchez-Aballi. “I like playing teacher and getting a view for what it’s like from the other side of the classroom.”

In addition to teaching, Sanchez-Aballi is currently the President of the Spanish Club (which he also formed). He also won a school racquetball tournament last year.

Academically, he is carrying a 3.6 GPA in English. His future plans are not certain, but Sanchez-Aballi is leaning towards a career in teaching after earning his doctorate from Duke or the University of North Carolina.

As for football, Sanchez-Aballi is taking a logical approach. “I’m not going to fool myself into believing that I’m going to start. My goal is to make significant contributions to the team, but inexperience may keep me from lots of playing time.”

Another obstacle is a possible stress fracture in his leg. Although the injury has not been officially diagnosed, defensive coordinator Jim Sypult said that Sanchez-Aballi has missed practice time because of the situation.

Despite his ailment and lack of training, Sanchez-Aballi has proven much to the Wildcat coaching staff. “I am impressed with his desire to get ready to play. He has worked hard and has shown a lot of enthusiasm,” said Sypult.

“I’m still learning a lot about football,” said Sanchez-Aballi. “At first, I took a lot of things for granted. The ‘chess-like’ strategy and little things have been the most difficult for me.”

Nevertheless, Sanchez-Aballi remains confident about the upcoming season. “I usually set pretty high expectations for myself. I rely on my determination and desire to excel to carry me through,” said Sanchez-Aballi.

Throughout his Davidson career, Sanchez-Aballi has made a practice of accomplishing the difficult. One cannot help but expect that success on the football field will be yet another example of this trait.
