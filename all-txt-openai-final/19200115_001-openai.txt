Great Convention at Des Moines Enjoyed by Davidson Men

Seventy-Eight Hundred Delegates at Conference

“Have a good time?” 
“You bet I did. Couldn't help it.”

Yes, a good time was in the bargain and a great deal more for every one of Davidson’s six representatives at the Eighth International Convention of the Student Volunteer Movement in Des Moines, Iowa, December 31 to January 4. Seven thousand eight hundred delegates were there, representing over 1,000 institutions and over 40 different nationalities in the student life of the United States and Canada. There were just about as many on the train leaving Asheville as generally attend a state conference, and that was a whole lot. Was Davidson there? Of course she was. Even when hunger and a freight wreck forced us at 11 o'clock in the morning to patronize home industry at Pine Knot, Ky., there behind the counter at Kidd Bros. Grocery was (Continued on page 12)

Splendid Basketball Schedule Arranged--First Game of Season Saturday

Students Urged to Give Strong Support — Twenty-Three Games Scheduled—Nine Games On the Hill

The 1920 basketball schedule is the best that Davidson has had for years. It is especially good in regard to the games to be played on the home floor. These are to be with two Y. M. C. A. teams and seven strong college quints. This gives the whole student body many good opportunities to see their team in action and to let them know that the whole student body is backing them and expecting them to uphold Old Davidson’s honor in every one of the 23 hard games of the season.

The home of Woodrow Wilson, Thornton Whaling, C. Alphonso Smith and others during their stay at college. This stately edifice has stood the test of time for some 75 years, but is now in need of repairs—one of the arguments why you should contribute to the MILLION DOLLAR CAMPAIGN.

Davidson Students to Raise $10,000--- Great Campaign Planned

Teams to Get Busy Monday, January 19—Much Competition Expected

There is no one thing which would stimulate the Presbyterians of North Carolina to be liberal when asked to contribute to the Million Dollar Campaign for their institutions in North Carolina than a big gift by the students of these institutions. To that end the campaign managers have asked the students of Davidson College to subscribe $10,000. This subscription is not a cash proposition, but is to extend over a period of four years, and that ought to be ample time for those in financial difficulties to recover and get into a position enabling them to help out.

The $10,000 campaign will be started next week on the night of Monday, the 19th, and the subscriptions will be taken by dormitories. This is entirely a student affair, superintend it. We are going to do it ourselves, and it behooves us to go over the top a long distance, for the more the students give, the more will be given by those who support the college, and the greater the benefit thereby. The following is the list ofManagers by dormitories. They will select their teams who will make the rounds Monday night. When they come around just remember that this is not a CASH SUBSCRIPTION, and that $23 apiece will do the work.

Georgia—D. M. Chalmers.
Watts—J. R. Boulware, Jr.
Rumple, right side—L. G. Calhoun.
Rumple, left side—A. L. Wilson.
Chambers, south wing—J. R. McKeldin.
Chambers, north wing—L. B. Schenck.
Louisiana—A. L. Currie.

The managers of the campaign are sending no one down here to the Rockefeller Foundation of New York.

Offers One Hundred Thousand
Davidson to Receive Large Sum On Condition—Another Offer Pending

The General Educational Board of New York (the Rockefeller Foundation) has offered to Davidson College $100,000 on a $500,000 fund. This means that $400,000 at least must be raised in the Million Dollar Campaign for Davidson to secure this offer. In other words, the Presbyterians of North Carolina must raise a million dollars in order to make this offer and the offer of $60,000 of Mr. C. E. Graham, of Greenville, S. C., become binding. The two above-mentioned offers amount to an aggregate of $160,000. Is this worth working for? The answer is with the Alumni of Davidson College and the Presbyterians of North Carolina.

The Colleens Score Big Hit With Davidson Students
Splendid Talent Displayed by Performers—Large Crowd Present

Despite the lateness of the train, and the fact that their costumes did not come, The Colleens scored a big success last Wednesday evening. There were four ladies in all, Miss Almina Peterson, violinist and first soprano; Miss Gladys Peterson, cornetist and second soprano; Mrs. Wright Armstrong, pianist and first alto; Miss Dewitt, cellist and second alto.

The program opened with an instrumental number, Medley of Irish Songs. Two Irish songs by Miss Almina Peterson, and Kathleen Mavourneen by the quartet, followed. The latter was especially well rendered. A conversation on burying husbands was given next by Miss Gladys Peterson. This part of the program was closed with another instrumental piece.

The second part of the entertainment was a tribute to the work done by the Salvation Army in France. First, Miss Peterson sounded a number of bugle calls which were remarkably familiar to those who were in the S. A. T. C. last fall. Several songs were rendered by the quartet, including Lead, Kindly Light, Don’t Forget the Salvation Army, and Salvation Sal. Mrs. Armstrong closed this part of the program with a piano solo, Etude in D flat major.

The last section was composed of miscellaneous numbers. There were several instrumental pieces, solos, duets, etc. The hits of the evening, however, were Oui, Oui, Oui, La, La, by the orchestra, and Cuckoo, sung by Miss Almina Peterson. A cornet solo by Miss Gladys Peterson also brought large applause. Taken all in all, the entertainment was excellent. The hall was packed and the audience extremely appreciative.

Delegates to Des Moines to Speak Next Sunday at “Y.”

Next Sunday night at the Y service our five delegates to the Des Moines Convention: Chalmers, Bitzer, Schenck, Mauze, and Richards, will report. The report was scheduled for last Sunday, but on account of other things, could not be given. The convention was the largest of its kind ever held, having 7,700 students from the different colleges of the country. Besides the five representatives, R. E. McClure went at his own expense, and there were 14 Davidson alumni who are now attending other colleges. All of our representatives are enthusiastic over the time they had and will no doubt give us a good general idea of the happenings of the convention.
