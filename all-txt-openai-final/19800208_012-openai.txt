In response to Black Awareness Month, the Cultural Events Committee is sponsoring P.A.G.E. Thursday evening in the 900 Room. P.A.G.E., the Performing Arts Guild Ensemble, will present a "staged production, a fusion of poetry, music, and dance." An affiliate of the Afro-American Cultural Center, P.A.G.E.'s performance is "designed to entertain, educate, and encourage active audience participation."

The members include T.J. Reddy, Administrative Director; Ruth Sloan Dew, Artistic Director; Karen Meadows, Production Manager; Michael Porter, Music Director. The performance begins at 8:30 and is free.

Mark Twain

Mark Twain Sketches will be presented by the Boston Chamber Repertory Theater on Monday evening, February 11. The five-member troupe will portray Twain's humor through a story of four men and a "young 'un" passing time on a dock while waiting for a Mississippi River steamboat. They indulge in a wager resulting in a string of tales about blundering bluejays, tedious tourists, cannibalistic congressmen, and other victims of Twain’s sense of social outrage.

The performance will be at 8:15 pm in Love. Tickets are $1 for students, $3 for faculty and staff, and $5 (ticket prices will be raised $1 at the door).

In the 900 Room

Playing bop, fusion (jazz rock), bossa nova, samba, and old standards will be In Time, a contemporary jazz group, in the 900 Room Friday and Saturday nights.

The five members of the group include trumpet player Lee Davis, Scott Adair on saxophone, Tom Shepard playing a very smooth bass, drummer Dave Licht, and Greg Hyslop on guitar.

In Time play a lot of original work and have an excellent reputation in the Carolinas. Performances are at 9:30 and 11:00.
