THE DAVIDSONIAN

In 1992...
And 1993...
And 1994...

If you were a soccer fan...
if you wanted to see the NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Championship,
you came from 33 states and 17 foreign countries...
you came to a small town called Davidson, N.C.,
to a 5,000-seat stadium known for its role on ESPN and CBS...

and then it went away to Richmond.

Guess what? Itâ€™s coming back,
not to Davidson, but just down the road to Charlotte.
not to Richardson Stadium, but to Ericsson Stadium...
