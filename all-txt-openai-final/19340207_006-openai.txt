THE DAVIDSONIAN, FEBRUARY 7, 1934

Eumenean Society Elects Officers

Richard Banks, president, J. M. Douglas, vice-president, J. H. Ross, secretary, and Ed Humphrey, critic, were elected to head the Eumenean Literary Society for the next term at its meeting during the past week. These officers will be placed in office at the next meeting.

At its regular meeting Tuesday, February 6, the society debated the question, Resolved: That the United States Should Substantially Increase the Power of Its Armed Forces. J. A. C. Andrews and E. S. Finley argued affirmatively with G. B. Squires and Jack Branch debating negatively. That the growth in military power of Germany, Japan, and Russia necessitated an increase in U.S. military power was the principal argument of the affirmative. In refutation of this, the negative emphasized that the geographical location of the United States made the country secure enough, that 3,000 miles of water was the country’s war insurance.

Davidson’s President Makes Four Addresses

Dr. W. L. Lingle, president of Davidson College, who has delivered two out-of-town addresses this week, will speak here Thursday evening and Sunday morning. The first address was upon “The Church and the Modern Home.” It was given to the men of the Presbyterian Church in Kannapolis at 6:30 Monday evening. Tonight, at the same time, he will speak to the men of the church in Shelby. Thursday evening at 7 o'clock the Ministerial Band will hear President Lingle in the Philanthropic Literary Society Hall. He will deliver the sermon Sunday morning in the Presbyterian Church here.

MEET FRESHMAN QUINT SATURDAY

McCallie School’s basketeers, pictured above, will play the Davidson freshman five on the latter’s court Saturday night, February 10. This quintet last year won the Mid-South prep championship, and is this year attempting to defend its title with the same list of starters playing that graced the court in '33.

McCallie Brings Strong Team Against ’Kittens

Saturday night the McCallie School basketball team will be engaged in the local gymnasium by the Davidson freshman quintet. This prep school five last year won the Mid-South Association championship. McCallie comes to the campus with one of the best groups of basketeers in any southern preparatory school. In 1933, the same five that will be seen here Saturday won the tournament conducted in Nashville, Tenn., each year by The Nashville Banner to determine the championship of the Mid-South Association of Prep Schools. This season they hope to repeat when the tournament is held in the Tennessee metropolis in March. So far this season the team has won 12 out of 16 games, with Captain Fletcher Sims being on the sidelines during three of these defeats, suffering with an injured leg. Captain Sims, however, is back in the line-up now, and will no doubt be on hand when the Wildkittens take on the Preps Saturday. Sims was captain of the team in 1933, and also led the '33 gridmen, who went through an undefeated season.

’CAT CAGERS ENGAGE BIG FIVE OPPONENTS

(Continued from page 5)

State in an earlier battle defeated the ‘Cats 32-29, despite a spirited rally in the last quarter. Wake Forest also defeated the ’Cats. Saturday the team granted a slight breathing spell when they meet Lenoir-Rhyne, whom they have previously defeated, 38-29. On Monday and Tuesday nights the cagers will meet two of the strongest teams in the Southern Conference and two of the leading contenders for the Big Five title, Duke and...Carolina. Both of these teams have already defeated the Wildcats; Duke beat them 40-35, while Carolina took them 38-23. Both of these games will be played on the opponents’ home courts.

In their final game, the Davidson team suffered another setback at the hands of William and Mary. The first half was a hard struggle with the William and Mary team having a slight advantage at the half, leading the Wildcats 12-10. In the second half, the William and Mary team set too fast a pace, and the ’Cats drifted further behind until the final whistle ended the game with the Virginia team leading 31-19. Blaker, right forward of W. & M., led the field by scoring six field goals and one free throw for a total of 13 points. Morgan led the Davidson team and was second to Blaker, netting nine points.
