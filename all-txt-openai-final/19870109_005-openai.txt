PSST, DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THE ARGUMENT BETWEEN TWO INANIMATE OBJECTS?

WHEN IS THE RIGHT TIME TO CALL YOUR BOYFRIEND?

a) When the president of Phi Gamma Delta asks you to Saturday night’s Fiji Formal.

b) After racquetball class, to tell him that the instructor with the Australian accent and those blue eyes did wonders
for your serve.

c) When you just feel like telling him you miss him after all.

Maybe you shouldn’t tell him everything that’s going on. But if you still care about him, why not call and
whisper some sweet things he’ll never forget?

Like why you call using AT&T Long Distance Service, and why you trust AT&T's high quality service and exceptional value.

When you tell him that AT&T gives you immediate credit if you dial a wrong number, he won’t be able
to get you out of his mind.

And telling him you can count on AT&T for clear, long distance connections will drive him crazy.

All of which will probably inspire him to drive out for the weekend, giving you an excuse to blow off
that silly frat party after all.
