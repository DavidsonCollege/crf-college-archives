Dave Alyea’s Puzzle Corner

Last week’s puzzle contest was harder than it looked! There have been only three entries so far, all of which
are close but not quite right. So here are some hints:

1. You must combine the results of the two puzzles in some way to obtain the answer to the puzzle
contest. And when you get it, believe me, you’ll know!

2. Notice anything special about the letters in the maze?

3. Puzzle 1, question f: solve this cryptogram:

OGD VRNNDVO EKIJDN OR OGYI UBDIOYRK YI JDNY.

4. Puzzle 1, question h: Act III, scene ii.

5. The answer is not “chef!”

Don’t forget that there’s money in this for you: $10 for the first correct entry and $5 for the second.
So get cracking.

Good Luck!

Make Money!

The Davidsonian is looking for circulation staff members! We need people with cars who will be able to make a
brief trip to Charlotte on Wednesdays between the hours of 11:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. We also need drivers to
make trips to Charlotte late on Wednesday afternoons, as well as people to help distribute the paper on Wednesday evening.

Drivers will be reimbursed for the cost of their gas, and all circulation staff members will be paid $3.35 per
hour and will have their names placed on the staff roster of The Davidsonian.

Anyone who is interested should call Lucia Kendall at 892-6316 or Keith Finch at 892-6415.
