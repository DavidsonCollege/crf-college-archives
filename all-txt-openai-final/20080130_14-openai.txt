THE DAVIDSONIAN: Poll is an accurate reflection of Penn sentiment. A Ou att and even nee - Ne; England problems
in their Week 17 meeting. The Giants have formidable receivers, with Plaxico Burress emerging as a playmaker at wide receiver
this year. The defense is swarming and, with Michael Strahan, Osi Umenyiora, and Justin Tuck applying the pass rush, they
will cause New England problems.

But they won't win.

When you look at this Patriots team, it seems like an All-Madden team. You have Tom Brady, who is already
one of the top three quarterbacks of all time, having the best statistical season of a quarterback in the history
of the NFL. With offensive playmakers like Randy Moss, Donte Stallworth, Wes Welker, Jabar Gaffney, and Ben Watson, passing looks
easy. Laurence Maroney is a top 10 running back, and Kevin Faulk is an underrated pass-catcher and blocker out of
the backfield. The Patriots’ 3-4 defense ranks among the legendary defenses of the past like the "Steel Curtain" and the
"Monsters of the Midway." If you ask me, the most impressive and unheralded part of the Patriots is the stellar
play of its offensive line. Amazingly, the Patriots had a seven-game stretch in which they only had two holding penalties!
Compare that with your neighborhood Carolina Panthers.

Basketball scores two key victories
By MIKE FRONGELLO

Stephen Curry ’10 and Thomas Sander ’08 led Davidson to road victories over The Citadel and College of Charleston last
week as the Wildcats extended their Southern Conference regular season winning streak to 21 games and their overall win streak
to nine. Andrew Lovedale ’09 scored 10 points, collected seven rebounds, and forced three steals against the Cougars. Curry, who
was named SoCon Player of the Week on Monday for the fifth time in his career, led the ’Cats with
28 points and five rebounds in an 87-70 victory over The Citadel on Thursday night. Davidson jumped out to a
7-0 lead to begin the game and never looked back as they led the entire contest. The ’Cats held a
41-33 halftime advantage thanks in large part to Curry’s 18 first-half points. The Wildcats also received solid production from their
senior trio in Thursday’s win. Sander added 12 points on a perfect 6-6 shooting night from the field while Boris
Meno ’08 contributed nine points and nine rebounds off the bench. Point guard Jason Richards ’08, who leads the nation
in assists at 8.4 per game, finished the evening with nine points and eight assists.

On Saturday afternoon, Davidson returned to the court to take on College of Charleston, the team the ’Cats faced in
the SoCon Tournament Championship last season. The ’Cats again got off to a quick start, opening the game on an
18-4 run fueled by three-pointers from Richards, Sander, and Curry. The Cougars' game plan was to shut down Curry, which
provided an opportunity for another Wildcat to step up, and on this night it was Sander. The senior forward scored
a season-high 21 points to lead all scorers, and he also grabbed five rebounds. Despite the extra attention, Curry still
managed 16 points and six rebounds. Andrew Lovedale ’09 added 10 points, seven rebounds, and three steals while Richards also
scored in double figures with 12 points. The ’Cats inserted Lovedale into the starting line-up nine games ago and have
not lost since. With the wins, Davidson now sits comfortably atop the SoCon South Division standings at 11-0. The Wildcats
are now 13-6 overall and have not lost since their 66-65 defeat at NC State on Dec. 21. Curry and
the 'Cats seemed to learn a lot from the loss. “I think the experience of losing that game made us
not want...to lose again because it hurt so much, and now we are playing very well,” Curry said. The team
hopes to continue its dominance in the conference with tonight’s home match-up against Wofford. The team travels to Chattanooga on
Saturday for a 7:00 game against the Mocs. The Wildcats defeated Chattanooga 85-58 on Jan. 19.

Strong swims close home season for ’Cats

The Davidson women’s swimming team had a victorious home finale on Saturday, defeating UNC Wilmington 151-148 and Campbell 232-59. The
momentum did not carry over to the men, however, as they fell to Wilmington 191.5-99.5. The women’s meet wasn’t decided
until the final event, when Courtney Sanders ’09, Caitlin Sheetz ’10, Emily Castle ’11, and Lindsey Martin ’11 delivered a
victory in the 400-meter freestyle relay (3:34.55) to give the home team the decision.

“A meet that comes down to the final relay is probably the most exciting team situation in our sport,” head
coach John Young said. “I’m happy that the women got to experience that today and ecstatic that they responded to
the situation with the fire and poise necessary to win. This is a great step for our team.”

Anna Stringfield ’11 recorded victories in the 200-meter freestyle (1:53.51), the 200-meter backstroke (2:08.34), and the 400-meter individual medley (4:32.98)
to lead the Wildcat women. She also anchored the third place 400 free relay which secured the three-point victory. Martin
added victories in the 50 (23.95) and 100 meter (53.33) freestyles. Alanna Ream ’09 added a victory in the 1000
meter freestyle (10:42.37). Sheetz finished second in the 1000 and Jessica Delgehausen ’11 posted second in the 200 freestyle.

The men began their meet with Scott Frantz ’09, Nate Ladner ’10, Miller Williams ’10, and Fiete Stegger ’08 winning
the 200-meter medley relay with a time of 1:35.95.

flystroke in 1:57.16, while his brother Will finished second in the 1000 meter freestyle. Seniors Kirsten Allen, Leslie Sherrill, Maddie
Stough, Robb Broughton, Will Broughton, Stegger, and Adam Topaz were honored in pre-meet festivities.

“We had good efforts from all our seniors today, highlighted by the Broughton brothers,” Young said.
