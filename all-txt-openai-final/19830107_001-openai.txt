**Open Trustee Meeting Today**

**Presidential selection process to be major topic**

By DAVID RESNIK ’85

The Davidson Board of Trustees is holding separate open meetings today with students, administrators, and faculty to discuss the method
of selecting a new college president. Their meeting for students begins at 2:00 p.m. in the Chambers Gallery.

“This is an opportunity,” said SGA President Tim Johnston, “for students to say where Davidson should be ten or fifteen
years from now, how we will get there, and what kind of person will lead the way.”

According to The Constitution of Davidson College, the “Trustee Presidential Search Committee” must “have consultations with Faculty, Students, and the
Administrative Staff in carrying out their committee function.”

The trustees will consider opinions in their open meetings today and during the Search Committee’s hearings during the next few
months, when Faculty and Student Committees will voice their views.

The SGA will appoint a committee to choose the Student Presidential Advisory Committee next week. The Committee will choose 4-5
student representatives, according to Johnston, “and will be open to all students.”

Johnston cautions, however, that the Committee requires “a serious commitment” because there is “a lot of hard work down the
road.”

The Women’s Concerns Committee sent an open letter to the Trustees earlier this week expressing their goals and interests. Other
organizations have not yet acted but will be present at today’s student meeting. Black Student Coalition President Anne Elliot says
her group “will be expressing its concerns” during the meeting.

President Samuel Spencer announced on 7 December 1982 his retirement from office effective 1 July 1983. Spencer will become President
of the Virginia Foundation for Independent Colleges (VFIC), a fund-raising group for fourteen private colleges in Virginia.

The Trustees announced Spencer’s appointment as President on 12 July 1967 after an exhaustive six-month search. Then President David Greir
Martin had announced his resignation on 7 January 1967.

A six-man faculty committee and a four-man student committee advised the group of four trustees who made the final decision.
It was the first time that the Trustees had included faculty and students in the decision.

The Presidential Search Committee considered prospects from a field of 124 friends of the college, alumni, university professors and administrators,
and heads of major institutions.

They pared the list down to the 89 Presbyterians in accordance with a trustee by-law requiring that the President be
a member of the Presbyterian Church.

Then SGA President Tom Earnhardt ’68 headed the student Advisory Committee. “The Trustees ran a completely open show,” according to
Earnhardt, “despite all the rumors going around.”

**Davidson’s first female recipient**

By ANNE LAMBERT ’86

Senior philosophy major Elizabeth Kiss was recently named as one of 32 Rhodes Scholars from the United States, making her
Davidson’s first female recipient and the twentieth Rhodes Scholar in Davidson’s history. Elizabeth will study for two years in Oxford,
England pursuing a post-graduate degree in philosophy.

The only female from Davidson to apply for the Rhodes Scholarship, Kiss notes the special significance of her achievement. “I’m
pleased that in the first decade of co-education at Davidson, a woman has been awarded a major fellowship [such as
the Rhodes Scholarship].” Kiss feels many capable Davidson women neglect to apply for post-graduate fellowships because they feel they aren’t
qualified to compete successfully. Kiss hopes her achievement will encourage more women to apply for similar awards: “The Davidson support
system for people applying for fellowships—if they are willing to take the initiative—is very helpful. . . . Even if
you don’t think you ‘fit the bill’ you should try because you never know what might happen.”

Kiss herself was apprehensive about her chances for the scholarship, since a Rhodes scholar is chosen on the basis of
excellence in several areas including academics, leadership, character, and athletic ability. “I was concerned about the athletic part of it
because I’m not an athlete, but now I think the [Rhodes] program is placing less emphasis on athletic achievement. .
. . During the last part of the interviews they really drilled me.”
