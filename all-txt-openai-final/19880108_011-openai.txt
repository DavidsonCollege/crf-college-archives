**Albinder should know why he will not be rehired**

**Ann Blue**

Isn’t it interesting how the administration seems to always be looking for ways to “increase student involvement” at Davidson? What
with all the talk of our commitment to service, our need to support student athletics, and with the high premium
put on extra-curricular activities around here, it would seem that the student body is faced with an abundance of opportunities
for involvement, service, leadership, investigation, and responsible action, in short, opportunities for being involved as intelligent adults.

Upon closer examination of certain aspects of this college’s existence, it becomes apparent that this community only carefully invites student
involvement. With quite a bit of calculation on the part of the administration, student interest is directed to outlets deemed
acceptable, appropriate, worthy, safe. What about the ill-fated “Flipsides” program on WDAV, “Your radio for the arts”—certainly no longer everyone’s.
The decision to cut off this outlet for student involvement and creativity came from someone evidently more concerned with image
and consistent programming than with student participation in this environment where participation is supposedly so important. How about a little
consistent programming on the part of the trustees and the administration? If you want to encourage responsible student action, treat
the students fairly and responsibly. Those students who muster up the courage to speak for divestment, or for openness to
our differences, etc., should be encouraged at all times and in all circumstances to continue to use their brains and
their voices to improve this school.

With that as my introduction, I would like to focus on a situation which has proved upsetting to a large
group of students at Davidson. Recently, Frank Albinder, music and voice instructor and director of the Davidson College choirs, was
told that he would not be re-hired, and that—in accordance with college policy—the reasons for this decision were not to
be disclosed to him or anyone else. This occurrence gets to me for several reasons, the least of which is
this: From a purely professional standpoint, would someone not benefit from legitimate constructive criticism? If there are indeed flaws in
Mr. Albinder’s teaching technique that contributed to his contract’s suspension, would it not seem logical that those making the decision—who
supposedly operate on the premise that learning is of the utmost importance—might advise Mr. Albinder of those technical flaws, in
the hope of contributing to the quality of education? It all seems very strange to me, and to my choir-mates
as well. Mr. Albinder has an undeniable right to know the reasons behind this decision which affects him so basically.
I have been told that this secrecy surrounds the contract and tenure decisions as a matter of policy. One of
my reasons for writing this letter is to ask the responsible parties in the administration to explain why this policy
exists. The tenure process is yet another arena in which student involvement is not presently solicited. Indeed, student participation in
this process seems to excite about as much interest in the administration as shanties on Chambers lawn or a couple
of hours of progressive music on WDAV.

The main reason that Mr. Albinder’s predicament disturbs me is because I think he is a great person. Not only
does he know more about music than most of the folks at this college do, but he has a gift
for communicating this knowledge in a way that is not haughty or distant, but rather funny and appealing. He is
always patient, prepared, and ready to face

**You know, Ken**

**Carl Whipple**

To begin, I would like to say that I respect Ken Bogert very much for the courage not only to
write but also to publish two letters which take a stand on a very controversial issue. Not only must one
have a good understanding of the situation in order to express one’s views clearly, but one must also possess courage.
I am not writing in order to oppose everything Ken has said in the past two weeks, nor to defend
the fraternity system to my utmost. If I did, I would only be succumbing to the pressures from which Ken
has been able to break away. Ken’s argument is strengthened by the fact that many fraternity members are unable to
cope intelligently with the issues he has brought before the Davidson community.

I am a member of a fraternity, Phi Gamma Delta (yes, professor, the “drug” fraternity), and also an eating house,
PAX. Thus, I believe I may have an insight which differs from what most people bring into a discussion of
this issue. Since Ken addressed the situation with two different letters, I will respond to each of them separately. Stereotypes
are an integral part of any society and have more to do with the fact that we at Davidson live
in a society made up of human beings rather than fraternities. From now until the end of history, humans will
place others into specific molds whether or not the molds fit. We will therefore have stereotypes regardless of our social
system. Fraternities, due to their masculinity and intensity, tend to develop stereotypes that are less than admirable. However, for every
person who joins a fraternity because of that fraternity’s stereotype, just as many people or more join because they go
beyond the stereotype to find out what a group of people really believe and represent. Do you actually think that
most KAs joined their fraternity because KA is stereotyped as “prejudiced?” Hardly. In the same sense, I didn’t join Phi
Gamma Delta because I thought its members were “druggies.”

In response to Grier Stewart’s article, I would like to defend Ken by pointing out that he never once accused
a fraternity of actually resembling its stereotypical image. Instead, he showed how sad it is that fraternities are afflicted with
stereotypes that are unadmirable and in manythe bi-weekly challenge of directing our unruly band of singers. If Mr. Albinder’s sense
of humor or teaching style disturbs some, I have only this to say in response: You can grow a lot
by exploring things which disturb your comfortable little world. The greatest experiences often come out of initially disturbing encounters. Mr.
Albinder is not a quiet kind of person; he speaks his mind with conviction. If the administration is looking for
a “yes-man,” I do not think they will find one in Mr. Albinder. But I believe he is the kind
of professor and individual that Davidson needs, if the college is not to begin sinking into a mire of sterility
and sameness. I do not want to label Mr. Albinder; I just want to say that I—and many, many others
I know—think he is a valuable part of the community, as a professional and as a person. I hope this
letter is read by everyone on campus, especially those in the administration who made the decision concerning Mr. Albinder. I
hope I have provoked someone to respond to my questions and comments about the tenure process, without having provoked anger
or defensiveness directed at students. The faculty of this school is our business as students; we have a right to
be heard during our professors’ contract reviews. And the faculty members up for review have a basic right to know
the details of a decision which affects their livelihood and their future. Secrecy and closed-door policies do not belong here.
Please let us know what is going on.

Bogert, you may be right! Before I move on, though, I must clear up one major difficulty in Ken Bogert’s
argument. Fraternities don’t “take individuals and reform them in the fraternities’ images.” Instead, people outside of fraternities change their conception
of individuals who join in order to “fit” new members into the fraternity’s stereotype. The problem isn’t entirely the fault
of the fraternities; outsiders, too, are very much to blame. Ken’s second letter raises more pertinent points than his first.
I think that the self-selection issue has finally come to a point upon which we can all agree: self-selection doesn’t
work for fraternities! Patterson Court fraternities don’t operate under a self-selection system; instead, they use an unwritten bid system which
defies any reasonable definition of “self-selection.” Let’s quit being hypocritical, and call it what it really is! Yes, Ken, fraternities
do tend to have a narrow social life that revolves around drinking, but I have yet to see any other
Patterson Court house that does not offer a bar downstairs at all social events. Moreover, one fraternity, Kappa Sigma, practices
a dry rush. Ken is not advocating a moral crusade against drinking. The question runs deeper, and it is one
which should make every fraternity look in the mirror and ask itself, “Is the focus of fraternities at Davidson on
alcohol and partying?” Many non-fraternity members (and fraternity members as well) forget or don’t ever find out that every fraternity
tries to stand for very lofty ethical and moral standards. Do they here at Davidson? Fraternities are supposed to be
so much more than a social organization or a tight brotherhood. Are they here at Davidson? Fraternities are supposed to
select members who will agree to the ideals to which the national organization devotes itself and who will spread these
ideals to the society around them. Are they doing this here at Davidson? Frankly, no. The fraternities here, and at
many other colleges and universities, are plagued with the same disease. With such a wonderful mold to work from, Davidson
chapters fail to make sincere attempts to abide by the ideals for which their individual fraternities exist. Let me conclude
by saying that I don’t believe that the abolition of fraternities at Davidson could solve our problems. Any system that
replaces the present social system will be ridden with unhealthy stereotypes and factionalism. I believe that any problem Ken Bogert
has pointed out can be solved within the fraternity system itself. Maybe I’m just a strong believer in “working within
the system.” I do know, however, that fraternities mean very much to many alumni who have been away from the
college atmosphere for a long time. Perhaps the ideals of fraternities finally sink in after their members have spent some
time in the “real” world. Thanks for the discussion, Ken.
