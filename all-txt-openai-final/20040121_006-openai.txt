On such a momentous evening, the court was expected to get a bit wild. Eyewitness reports, however, recount a controlled
environment with most students making healthy decisions.

Said Chief Fountain Walker, “the amount of incidents involving Public Safety interaction, in my opinion, was less than a normal
Friday or Saturday night.” He commended “house leadership” for responding to officers’ requests.

“Students in general were having a good time,” added Walker, “and our folks had a handle on things.”

Students themselves tended to agree with Walker.

“I think maybe a few people were out of control, but people were behaved for the most part,” said Michaela
Corr ’07.

The increase in monitoring court activities came as no surprise.

“This is not a night that the school messes around too much,” said PIKA pledge trainer Charlie Hart ’04.
