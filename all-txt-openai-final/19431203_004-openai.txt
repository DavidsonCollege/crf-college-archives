C. G. McClure Spoke Sunday

The Reverend Charles G. McClure, pastor of the Caldwell Memorial Presbyterian Church, Charlotte, was the preacher at the Sunday night
college vespers. His subject was the “Divinity of Jesus”, using the words of Thomas as found in John 20:28, “My
Lord and my God”, as a text.

He gave four answers to the question “Why do we believe in the deity of Jesus?” First, because He spake
as never man spake. Second, because He lived as never man lived. Third, because He died as never man died.
And fourth, because He rose as never man rose. He concluded by saying that since Jesus is the son of
God He deserves our allegiance.

section of the store engaged in an exciting game of mumbly-peg with “Ah! Skeegam” (the janitor). Mustering his deepest voice
he makes request again and is greeted with, “Don’t get upset bud!” whereupon Hugo ambles to the front again and
proceeds to concoct a shake. He places it under the stirrer and at this point again leaves our potential customer
for a little game of “throw the wad of paper in the can” from the end of the counter. Suddenly
he glances up at the clock, grabs the shake, shoving it down in front of the startled fellow, who by
now is wondering as to the sanity of the plump individual, and rushes to the cash register, fingers poised eagerly
over the keys.

The poor imbiber tips the glass to his lips when a thundering clamor shakes him to the socks. The Air
Corps! Before he can down a sip he is pushed aside and mercilessly trampled to the floor. The cash register
and Jook-Organ blast forth loudly and the poor freshman drags himself out the door, beaten, bedraggled and dejected, to White’s
for a shake.
