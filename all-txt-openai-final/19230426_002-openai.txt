THE DAVIDSONIAN, APRIL 26, 1923

WRESTLING TEAM ELECTS CAPTAIN AND MANAGER

A few nights ago the wrestling team met and elected Lindamood as their captain for next year. It has been
decided to make the manager and captain’s job separate and Selser has been chosen as the manager next year. He
has already begun on the schedule, and although no definite arrangements have been made, there will be two or three
trips and about five meets on the campus. An attempt will be made to get a match with Ga. Tech.
at Atlanta. Selser says that besides having more matches next year there will be better accommodations for practice also. It
is hoped that the Athletic Association will see fit to install a regular wrestling mat in better quarters on the
main floor of the gym. The manager and captain are both looking forward to a strong team in 1924. Kimsey
is the only letter man that will not be back. Lindamood is only a Freshman this year but the fact
that he was elected captain shows the confidence that his teammates have in his ability. Selser is a new man
at Davidson also but has already shown his capability as a lightweight. Four D's were given this year to Lindamood,
Selser, Cromartie, and Kimsey, which shows that interest in wrestling is growing fast. The present manager is working hard on
the new schedule and he intends to do all he can to put wrestling on a par with other athletics.

Be It Ever So Humble

I’ve kissed the Flapper in auto cars,
As by the road we'd park;
I’ve kissed them in the movies too
Where all is nice and dark.
It’s great to love some pretty flapper,
As through the park you stroll;

Uniform “D” Adopted for Four Sports, Football, Baseball, Basketball, and Track.

A recent meeting of the Athletic Council brought forth several changes in the rating of letter men, as well as
news of interest in Tennis and Wrestling. In the first place, it was voted to standardize the size and design
of letters to be awarded in the four major sports—Football, Basketball, Baseball, and Track. Heretofore the Football letter men have
been the only D men who were allowed to wear the regulation eight-inch block letter. Now, every man who wins
the coveted honor in the other three sports of first rating, has the same privilege of displaying a full-size letter
of eight inches. There was much discussion as to whether the Wrestling team and the Tennis team would be allowed
this same standard D. The discussion accomplished nothing, consequently a committee was appointed to work out the proposition. This committee
is headed by Gig Shepherd and at the present time has not reached a decision, however it is thought that
there will be a distinction between these two forms of sports and the other four. Another important incident in the
meeting was the decision to award letters to four members of the past season’s wrestling team. These men are, Pat
Kimsey, Johnny Selser, Captain Cromartie, and Harry Lindamood. The whole team made a splendid showing this year, especially against the
V. M. I. Cadets, the strongest team south of the Mason-Dixon line. After the decisions had been reached to standardize
the letters and award wrestling letters, it was brought out that the plain, ordinary certificate, that gives the privilege to
wear the D should be changed to something that would make a better appearance and to something that could be
framed. It was decided to do this and to have a color distinguishing each sport. The certificate will probably be
of sheepskin like a diploma. These new certificates are to be sent out to every old letter man of Davidson
College and from now on shall be given to any on whom the much coveted D is conferred.

FAISON CHOSEN NEXT YEAR’S ATHLETIC HEAD

various athletic teams as nominees. Among those of the rising senior class who wear the D and who were candidates
for the office of president were: Faison, Cox, Davis, McBride, Clarke, Gallaway, Field, Boushlee, Cromartie, DeArmand, and Streibich. The vice-president
was chosen from the letter men who are now in the rising junior class. These were: Hendrix, Boggs, Mallory, Beall,
Hunt, Gracey, Staley, and McComb. The only two letter men in the freshman class were Laird and Lindamood. Laird won
over Lindamood on the first ballot. Elias Faison is well fitted to guide the destinies of the athletic association next
year. He expects a big year for Wildcat athletics considering the fact that Monk Younger will take charge next September
as head coach. With this attraction as a means for drawing prep school athletes to Davidson and plenty of men
returning, Faison says that he is sure of a successful year.

LETTERS STANDARDIZED IN MAJOR SPORTS; MONOGRAMS AWARDED TO FOUR WRESTLERS

BLEACHER BULL

Four in a row; not so worse. Watch that million-dollar infield. Knocking a home run over Sprunt Field fence is
something like the century plant that blooms once every hundred years. Maybe our grandchildren will be here to see Neely’s
grandchildren pole out another one—but maybe not. Ted Covington takes the cake for hitting—a triple, a double, and two singles
in one game. There’s a reason though. There was somebody in the bleachers during that Elon game, and Ted just
had to hit. Someone said it was his girl, but we say, “Come again, Mrs. Covington.” No-hit games are almost
as rare as home runs here. The last one was in 1921 when Red Miley twirled a perfect nine innings.
There ought to be a couple of big league scouts hanging around Jaybirdsville these days. Two college records in one
afternoon is fast work. Hats off to Messrs Calhoun and Streibich. If the Wildcats had run State like they did
Clemson there would have been a different story. The Clemson Tigers enter the Tech relays Saturday. They carry with them
the best wishes of every Davidson man. Somebody dust off the old home plate and let’s start class baseball. Every
year it develops a couple of men for the next year’s varsity. Turn out, fellows, you may get your chance
next. Did you notice how Hugh Bradley played with that tennis shark from Clemson? Hugh always gave him a handicap
of four games and then beat him out in the set. On the surface of things it looks like another
big year for tennis. At any rate Clemson didn’t get a set, singles or doubles. Lenoir still has the best
team in the State according to the Associated Press. They can’t get things wrong all the time though, and so
they put the Wildcats above Carolina and Wake.Forest. Here’s how they line up through last Saturday's contests.

| Won | Lost | Tied |
|------|------|------|
| Trinity | 0 | 0 |
| State | 0 | 0 |
| Davidson | 0 | 0 |
| Wake Forest | 0 | 0 |
| Carolina | 0 | 0 |
| Guilford | 0 | 0 |
| Catawba | 0 | 0 |
| Elon | 0 | 0 |

Putting mere games won and lost aside, there is no doubt that Trinity looks most promising for the championship. The
Methodists defeated Carolina, and Carolina kicked the dope bucket all over Riddick Field last Saturday when they beat State, 2-1.
Let’s show the tennis team the glad hand when they pull in from the Old Dominion State.

### YOUNGER LOOKS OVER NEXT YEAR’S MATERIAL

Monk Younger, who is to be head coach of athletics at Davidson next year, was on the hill Monday with
the V. P. I. baseball nine and while here talked over and completed his plans for the opening of the
football season next fall. Coach Younger is greatly pleased with the material on the hill for the football squad. He
was both surprised and pleased to find many heavy men in the student body and it is his wish to
have a large number of them in uniform next fall. Mr. S. D. Tilson is to be assistant coach in
football to Younger and will specialize in coaching the line. He has had two years of valuable experience in that
department and knows the system well. Arrangements are now being made for a training table for the coming season and
doubtless this will be of great help to the coaches in keeping the team in top-notch condition. Practically all of
next year’s equipment has arrived and with a good supply left from last season, every man that goes out will
be given a good outfit. Beginning this fall, no freshman will be allowed to play on the varsity. They will
have their own squad, schedule, and manager, and as coach, they will have Rawson, of the University of Georgia. This
includes all three branches of freshman activities. Also, this is a new step in athletics at Davidson for the Wildcats
and needless to say, the entire student body is behind the new coaches in making their new work a success.

### NICHES IN THE WILDCAT HALL OF FAME

No. 15 JOHN PARRY LAIRD JR.
Football and Basketball

The football season of 1916 has gone down in the annals of Davidson athletics as one of the most memorable
in the history of the institution and no small credit is due to the work of “Johnnie” Laird, who was
an indomitable cog in the Wildcat aggregation of that year. The lightest backfield man on the team, weighing only a
scant 150 pounds, “Johnnie” could dart and twist through the opposing lines with a wonderful facility that was most discomforting
to the heavy elevens that faced Davidson through the three years that he played on the Varsity. He was also
a popular man on the campus, being engaged in many forms of student activities and movements. Laird hailed from Decatur,
Georgia, having a brilliant prep school record behind him at Tech High. At his first football practice with the Wildcats
under Coach Bill Fetzer, he gave excellent promise, being fleet of foot and able to handle the ball. His three
years on the Varsity under the tutelage of Coach Fetzer made him one of the most versatile backs in Carolina
football circles and he ran up many points for the Red and Black with his steady line playing and passing.
Laird showed his versatility by playing end, half, and fullback, filling each position equally well. He was especially adept at
getting under punts and forcing his way through the heaviest opposing line. Davidson faced teams that outweighed her men many
pounds to the man but never once did the Wildcats lack that fighting spirit that has been handed down as
one of the priceless heritages of Davidson men. Laird played his best game of football against the University of South
Carolina and gained the notice of all spectators and coaches with his spectacular line plunging and skirting of the ends
for large gains. The combination of Black, Laird, and Keesler in the backfield proved too much for the Gamecocks although
they put up the stiffest kind of a scrap. The Davidsonian of that date gave much emphasis to the backfield’s
work, especially that of “Johnnie” Laird. He was the lightest man on the team but he more than made up
for it with his speed. This scrapping little wearer of the D proved himself very much of a help on
the basketball court also for two years. Along with Dutch Hengevelt, he romped with the boys for a nice string
of victories taken from the scalps of most of the quintettes met. He was often referred to as the “moustached
gent” as he wore a cute little Charlie Chaplin eyebrow on his lips of a decided reddish hue.

Or stage a gorgeous party, On beach, or glade, or knoll. But though I’ve tried in every place, As all
around I roam, At last I’ve come to realize, There is no place like home.

### ATHLETES

Make good as salesmen because—
They have natural training.
They know how to think and act quickly.
They understand what it is to “fight through.”
