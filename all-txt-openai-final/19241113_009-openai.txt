Total: 14 touchdowns, 2 field goals, 1 try point.

*Warner (P.C.) and Byrd (Elon) earned first downs.

Davidson was penalized three times for off-side, and first downs were given on these, making the total.

There were several fumbles in the first few minutes of play by both teams, but after that both the centers and backs seemed to have their range. Harrison started the onslaught by making 19 yards on the first play, and after kicking to Oak Ridge and receiving an exchange, he clipped off 24 more, followed by several gains by Overton and Grey, and then he wriggled through the Oak Ridge team for 12 yards and the first touchdown.

In the second quarter came the only three points scored by Oak Ridge. Sanders, tackle, was able to make a perfect placement from the 40-yard line. Then the Wildcats settled down and only in the third quarter was Oak Ridge able to come near the goal line, when the ball was brought to the nine-yard line, to be lost when Davidson held.

The other Davidson touchdowns came after a succession of gains and first downs, many of them coming after the backs had gone through the line for long gains and a touchdown. McMillan made 18 yards and a touchdown, Grey made 18 yards and a touchdown, Overton intercepted a pass and ran 70 yards for a touchdown, and after a pass, Wilson to Grey, had netted 16 yards, Wilson went nine yards for a touchdown. One safety was made by Davidson when a punt was blocked on the goal line and an Oak Ridge man recovered. Grey kicked the extra point three times, failing twice, but being given one when Oak Ridge was off-side.

Line-ups of the two teams follow:

Davidson | Position | Oak Ridge
McColl | Left end | Nanay
Wright | Left tackle |
