### Board of Trustees Divulges Large Real Estate Holdings

By TOOM UCHLAND

Media Distortion Czar Bob Page, of the college’s Office of Propaganda, says that inquiries have been flowing in “fast and
furious” since Tuesday's Davidson College Trustee disclosure of many previously secret college real estate holdings.

Last week’s Mecklenburg County circuit court decision forced the Trustees to make the statement. Many college officials are frankly astonished
at the extent of the properties involved. “Frankly, I’m astonished at the extent of the properties involved,” said Vice President
for Development John Griffith. “No, really, I am.”

Perhaps one of the most interesting parcels of land in the holdings is the Malibu home of actor William Shatner
of TV’s “Star Trek.” The 120-acre estate was purchased in early 1985 for $3.5 million as a retirement perk for
Davidson President John Kuykendall, who had been considering leaving the college for a second career in television evangelism. Kuykendall proved
hostile when approached for comment. “Don’t think I’ve just got this thing set on ‘stun,’ boy,” he shrieked early Thursday
morning in his office while perched on his desk. “Dammit, Missy, beam me up!” he added, snarling into one of
the two staplers he held.

Another item on the 534-page list is a plot of land adjacent to Lenin’s Tomb in Moscow. “This parcel was
due for disclosure, anyway,” noted friendly and outgoing Trustee John Belk. “The Trustees have decided it is in the best
interest of the college to develop it as a college-owned franchise of Spencer's Gifts. They make a lot of money,”
he explained, “and we needed an outlet to dispose of the Khrushchev dartboards,” thousands of which were produced for an
ill-fated 1960s college fundraiser. “Not to mention the need to tap the growing market for Chernobyl table cigarette lighters and
Gorbachev signature edible panties.”

The Soviet Embassy in Washington could not be reached for comment. White House officials were also unavailable, as they were
occupied with digging out a bunker in the White House front yard. “A bunker? Gee, I think it’s actually a
new garden,” lied President Reagan through an interpreter.

The most valuable item in the report was the courtyard of the Pentagon building in Virginia. Valued at $34.5 million
and leased by the ROTC department to the Cuban government, it was the site of the 1985 spring break trip
for Davidson ROTC cadets. During their three-day stay, cadets painted a series of alternating black and white concentric circles onto
the property at the request of the Cubans. When pressed for an explanation, ROTC student commander and Charlotte Observer coverboy
John McNeill said, “Hey, I don’t know why they asked us to do that. What I do know is that
we do as we're told.”

Student reaction to the once-secret holdings was overwhelmingly one-sided. A Davidphonian survey shows that a whopping 85 percent of students
agree that the Trustees should have made the disclosures sooner. Of those who do not whop, 95 percent agreed.

Few students were willing to be quoted directly, perhaps in reaction to last week’s disclosure of Dean of Students Will
Terry’s well-armed secret police force. “I'll take a, I mean the, fifth, thank you,” said one freshman as he reached
for his flask.

### Divestment Investigation

To deal with the issue of South African investments, the Davidson College Board of Trustees released a 15-year plan earlier
today during which specifically assigned committees will investigate all possibilities.

“We felt that, uh, as things stand, the college is, uh, torn apart, uh, on this issue,” one board member
said. “Maybe in 15 years, uh, the whole thing will, uh, be resolved.”

The board outlined the duties for 15 committees, all of which will be studying different aspects of the issue. Each
year, the board said, trustees will participate in a show-and-tell period in which that year’s committee can relate its findings.

“I think the show-and-tell idea is ingenious,” one member said. “We get really bored just talking and listening to everyone
else during those meetings, and having pictures and visual demonstrations will just be really neat.”

The board related that the general consensus amongst its members is one of horror at the system of apartheid currently
in place in South Africa.

“My wife is just aghast at the news every night,” one member said.

“It’s bad. It’s just really bad,” said another.

“I bet there are pinko commies involved,” said a third.

The board has anticipated the return of shanties to the grounds between the Martin Chemistry Building and the Grey Student
Union and expects them to remain on campus for the 15-year period. “The housing office was called in on this
problem,” one member said, “and we decided that in the room lottery during the spring, we’re going to have a
special section for mega-liberals who will participate in the lottery to live in the shanties the following year. We’re hoping
this will solve the problem with a shortage in housing.”

One member, who asked to remain anonymous, said he vehemently disagrees with the proposal that was accepted.

“I thought we should start investing exclusively in South African companies, just to get back at those crudball liberals, and
plus, that’s, uh, in the best interest of the college, I think, yeah.”

Crack spy photographers snapped this photo of two people in the back of the Residence Life Office by using ultra-expensive
equipment. Their identities are unknown because they were wearing masks — but it does look like the director and his
personal secretary.
