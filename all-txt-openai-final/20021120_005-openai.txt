**Student Director Bill**

By Emily Drew | News Editor

Three emotionally unstable sisters just returned to their Northern English home to handle the business of their mother’s death. Soon, though, they are gallivanting around their dead mother’s bedroom, trying on her dresses, drinking whiskey, and sharing a joint. They pose for a picture taken by a brother-in-law, and suddenly you notice something is just slightly wrong. I don’t want to spoil the surprise, but in that last stunning moment of Act I, it hits you full-force that this is a play that shouldn’t be missed.

The Memory of Water, a play by Shelagh Stephenson, crosses between two worlds, displays a wide variety of rocky relationships, and reveals how people deal with their troubled past in light of their present problems. With its clever lines and diverse characters, the play can stand on its own as a comedy (it won the 2000 Olivier Award for Best Comedy, after all). But under the direction of theatre major Bill Neville '03, Davidson’s production of Memory mingles the innumerable feelings that often overwhelm the breaking points of life and relationships.

Liz Sykes '04 designed the set and costumes for Memory, and Theatre faculty member Ronnie Higdon designed lights and sound. Parker Dixon '03 acts as the stage manager. All the production’s parts come together because of what Professor Ann Marie Costa called a “student engine.” “The students have really taken ownership of the project,” Costa said. She and Professor Joe Gardner have acted as advisors at the periphery of the project, but have been able to step back and let the students form their own “high quality design.” The design includes a treated floor of stone and water, and a lighting scheme where blue circles in with mellow music at times to create an atmosphere that is as uncertain as it is calm.

At the play's center, though, is an ensemble of six well-directed and talented actors. Rebecca Ragland '03 plays the youngest sister, Catherine. Neville calls Ragland’s performance an “unmissably hilarious tour-de-force.” More frankly, she’s a whirlwind and a hoot. Constantly over-the-top, Catherine is often childish, usually lonely, and always sexy. Her tantrums are captivating as she fights for her family’s attention (and gets it). Ragland’s performance will capture audience attention as well.

Susan Robison '04 tackles the difficult role of Teresa, the bitchy, angry sister. Robison—who is neither bitchy nor angry off-stage—proves her natural talent in a climactic, drunken screaming match between Teresa and her husband Frank, played by Ara Dilleepan '03. Both actors in this scene play off each other with excellent timing, to show a deep-rooted tension in a deep-rooted love.

The main love story, though, falls between Mary (Sara Romeis '03) and her married lover Mike (Chandlee Caldwell '03). The couple never let me forget they were in love, and I was especially impressed by Caldwell’s unwavering gazes toward Mary.

**Chamber of Secrets Casts Magical Spell**

By CHARLES CUMMINS | Staff Writer

Over the past few months, or more truthfully, since the credits began to roll on Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone this time last year, the anticipation continued to build for the release of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, recounting the adventures of the young wizard and his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger during their second year at Hogwarts’ School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. With bigger sets, better special effects, a darker storyline, and the return of the entire cast of the original production, Chamber of Secrets continues where The Sorcerer’s Stone left off, leading the audience on an incredible roller coaster ride of adventure with few, if any, low points.

When Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone was initially released, many reporters criticized the film for being too faithful to the details of the book, forcing the film to finish with a running time of 2 hours and 32 minutes. I thought the attention to detail was justified in the first film, which needed to establish significant background for our entrance into the world of magic. However, Chamber of Secrets suffers, particularly towards the beginning, from its attention to the multiple minor storylines that accompany the opening of the Chamber of Secrets. Yet, once the film focuses upon the search for the Chamber of Secrets, the story moves so smoothly toward its magical, adventurous, yet surprisingly violent conclusion that you won’t even notice the length.

The responsibility for the success of this film has been left to Daniel Radcliffe (Harry), Rupert Grint (Ron), and Emma Watson (Hermione), the main child actors who are visibly growing up on screen. Because the books follow Harry and his friends between the ages of eleven and eighteen during their stay at Hogwarts, their aging is a key aspect of the stories. Each of the three main stars, all rather inexperienced when they first took on the roles, have become more comfortable as actors on screen. Their inexperience is balanced by the skill of renowned British actors, including Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Jason Isaacs, Kenneth Branagh, and the late Richard Harris. As the child actors get more comfortable with the personalities of their individual characters, so do the critically acclaimed adult actors. Maggie Smith, in a more minor role than she had in the Sorcerer’s Stone, successfully portrays the motherly Professor Minerva McGonagall, caring yet not unwilling to punish, and Alan Rickman returns in his portrayal of the deceptively strict Professor Snape. Jason Isaacs, best known for his portrayal of Colonel William Tavington in The Patriot, offers a well-done performance as Lucius Malfoy, the evil father of Harry’s nemesis Draco. With a limited but impressive performance, the audience can’t help but hate this guy.

However, the most powerful adult performances belong to the newest cast member Kenneth Branagh (leaving behind Shakespeare temporarily) as playboy Gilderoy Lockhart, and Richard Harris, who died October 25th of Hodgkin’s disease, as Headmaster Dumbledore. Branagh uses his classical training to embody the deceptive playboy Lockhart, whose smile and concern for his looks shadows his inability to aid Hogwarts in peril. While the movie centers on the adventures of Harry Potter in his second year at Hogwarts, this movie belongs to Richard Harris as Headmaster Dumbledore. His handful of scenes possess a powerful and moving feel for the audience, since we are aware that these are the last scenes Harris ever performed in a career that spanned decades.and Romeis were always aware that their characters craved something more. Kristal High ‘04 gave a notable performance as well. Even if she never said a word, High’s facial expressions alone would prove the elegance, the wit, and the resentment locked inside Vi, the dead mother whose visits frame Neville presents Memory the play. The story of Memory is told through Stephenson’s clever dialogue, but the relationships of the characters are built and made realistic through Neville’s well-timed silences. Neville uses the white space of the stage to reveal long-felt, underlying tensions between the characters. The tensions are felt most in the awkward silences, and burst through at places like the end of Act I, where set design, lighting, acting, directing, and script click together in an emotionally charged moment that successfully encapsulates the play’s themes of gaining through losing and loving through hurting. And there’s also more of that rippling blue light that makes the set seem other-worldly and momentarily unaffected by the painful act of living.

Tonight, Nov. 20, is opening night. The show starts at 7:30 in the Black Box Theater of Cunningham Fine Arts. General admission tickets are $4 and will be sold at the door beginning 30 minutes before curtain. Seating is limited, but if you don’t make it tonight, you have four more chances, same place, same price: Thursday through Saturday, Nov. 21-23, at 7:30 p.m. and Sunday, Nov. 24, at 2 p.m. For more information, call 704-894-2361.

Pearl Jam resurfaces with its latest album, Riot Act
By Tuomas Cullen

Most of you probably didn’t know that Pearl Jam still put out albums; most of you probably don’t care. The relative lack of public interest in the band does not detract from the precision and creativity of the band’s seventh studio album, Riot Act. If the apocalyptic cover doesn’t deter you from buying the record, you will find that this band is still producing music that blows bands such as the justifiably mocked Creed and unoriginal, greasy Puddle of Mudd out of the water. Pearl Jam is the uninterested patriarch of this family of dissenting offspring rock bands; here, son is nothing like father.

Mike McCready is the most underrated lead guitarist of our time. Listen to the album and you will get an inkling of what I’m talking about. After that, listen to the other six albums he has played on and realize the degree to which he commands the guitar. He plays notes which some of you may still cling to from songs such as the jagged solo from “Animal” or the gentle strum of the song you have trouble admitting you enjoy, “Daughter.” I know you love it; attempts to deceive yourself only hurt you in the long run.

The solos he plays combine experimentation with the science of the instrument to create sounds that bands that fall under today’s category of “modern rock” will never approach. A perfect example of such skill surfaces on the song entitled “Get Right.” Grounded by Jeff Ament’s revolutionary play of the bass (if there was a record of him alone playing bass I would purchase it upon its release), the song churns toward an explosive chorus filled with the same vocal conviction Eddie Vedder showed on “Why Go,” from the band’s debut disc. There’s no need for me to name that record; if you don’t own it, you didn’t live through the nineties. After the second chorus, Vedder’s voice gives way to the basic rhythm guitar of Stone Gossard that has driven the song up to this point, which is then overtaken by the gushing sound of McCready’s guitar. I don’t think it’s unfair to say that many bands today could not replicate three notes of the solo in sequence. Not only does Pearl Jam go where other bands will not, they go where other bands cannot.

Released after nearly twelve years together as Pearl Jam, Riot Act sheds light on a band uninterested in what the mainstream is doing. Disinterested is a role Vedder and Co. play extremely well; they’ve had a lot of practice. Honestly, there hasn’t been a whole lot to be excited about in mainstream rock. I’ll respect Linkin Park when the new Guns & Roses album comes out (please give up on them America, Axl wearing a Jerry Rice jersey at the Video Music Awards was a personal insult based upon my NFL allegiance). Aggression has been the band’s strongest suit since the public met a kid named “Jeremy” back when I was 10 or 11; Riot Act returns to the more evident, yet not necessarily predictable, style of rock that people dismissed as nonexistent on the last record, 2000’s Binaural (Binaural is criminally overlooked in the musical scheme of the year 2000). Punishing the ears, tracks such as “Save You” and “Ghost” remind the listener of just how potent these five men are together. To condense the album into a single critical comment, I would say that Riot Act is a showcase of just how dominant the band can be, mixed with deviations from the norm which show that these men are still evolving as a band.

Playing drums for Pearl Jam seems to be a wholly temporary task. The latest inductee is Matt Cameron. For those of you who didn’t rip posters of Pearl Jam out of 1994-95 issues of Hit Parader and euphorically scotch tape them to your wall, Cameron spent his early career playing for Soundgarden. Pioneers of the genre of grunge, Soundgarden legitimately assaulted their instruments. The songs penned by Cameron on this album reflect a similar attack (“Cropduster,” “You Are,” “Get Right”). Cameron’s music has a fullness to it that results in arguably the best tracks on the record. Ranking the songs from an album this well crafted is a task that calls for intense analysis. That’s why I’m not going to do it; I’ll let you pick after you buy it.

You may not have read this far. If you did, well done. I respect you for reading about a band that writes consistently great albums that have been consistently overlooked since 1996’s No Code (to hear an exhibition of what it is to play drums well, pick this up). Let me say finally that the album is flawless. From the basic drum beat of “Can’t Keep” to the final notes of the closer “All or None,” Pearl Jam shows the audience where they have been (“Get Right”), where they are (“Cropduster”), and where they may end up (“Love Boat Captain”). Frankly, I want the next record now.
