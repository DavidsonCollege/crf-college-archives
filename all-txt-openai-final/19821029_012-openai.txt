### Suicide Hits Hodson Hall

The fall theater production is a real killer

By CATHI DUMAS ’84

"The Suicide," whether to be or not to be and who to do it for, is the title and the question of the major fall theatre production on campus.

"The Suicide" was written in the late 1920s by Russian playwright Nikolai Erdman. His first play had been a hit, and "The Suicide" received a great deal of attention from such Russian theatre greats as Gorki, Stanislavsky, and Meyerhold. Gorki pleaded with Stalin and obtained permission for the play to be produced, but at one of the last dress rehearsals, Stalin banned the play. Erdman spent 20 years in a labor camp because of his outspoken social satire. Finally, in the early sixties, the play was produced in Russia, and Erdman was able to see it performed before he died. In 1979, the Royal Shakespeare Company performed "The Suicide," and in 1980 it appeared on Broadway. According to Dr. Barber, however, "The Suicide" has been most successful when done by university or regional theatres.

So why is a suicide so controversial? The main character Semyon, played by John Marks, is an unemployed “little man” considering suicide. He is approached by characters representing the church, the arts, romance, business, and the intelligentsia, all of whom want his suicide to be a gesture for their cause.

According to cast member Matt Merrell, the play has a broad appeal: “A lot of people can identify with the main character. He wants to find a purpose for his life. He’s very average, but wants to escape his commonness and sense of uselessness.” Another cast member, Doug Vass, says "The Suicide" shows the impact of the Russian Revolution on some for whom it was not successful. Semyon’s discontent is powerful: “Allow us at least to whisper: ‘life is hard.’”

Dr. Gardner’s sabbatical this term provided an opportunity for students to collaborate on the design of the set. Dr. Barber did the basic design concept, but senior Eric Fichtner is the technical director and has done much of the building himself. Barber decided on a style called constructionism, which was used widely in the Russian theatre of the 1920s. The style involves an unpainted, almost still-under-construction look, and is a moving unit set.

The principal members of the cast include Anne Lambert as a deaf mute, John Marks as Semyon, Catherine McMillan as Maria, Laura Singleton as Serafima, Matthew Merrell as Alexander, William Crone as Viktor, David Barber as Aristarch, William Kremer as Pugachav, Roy Fuller as Father Elpidi, Loy Thorton as Maggarita, Roxanne Bickford as Raissa, Doug Vass as Egor, Cynthia Briscoe as Valodkina, and Joyce Robinson as Cleopatra.

Performances began with the student opening last night and will continue with performances this Friday and Saturday at 8:00 and Nov. 5 and 6, also at 8:00 p.m.
