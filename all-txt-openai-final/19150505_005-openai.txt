What Madam Bianca Randall Thinks of the STIEFF Grand Piano
Dear Sir — Please accept my thanks for the Stieff Grand Piano which you furnished for my recital. It is
an instrument of wonderful sweetness of tone, which is so satisfying and essential to accompanists.
THE GRAND PIANO USED AT THE CHAPMAN-ALEXANDER SERVICES IS A STIEFF
Note the sweet tone and wonderful carrying power of this 20th Century Piano, which fills the large auditorium seating over
6,000 people.

CAMPFIRE ENTERTAINMENT.

On Saturday night an interested and highly appreciative audience witnessed the entertainment given by the local Campfire Girls in Shearer
Hall. All of the girls taking part were costumed in their robes, decorated with symbolic beads and emblems, and made
by themselves. The setting of the stage was well arranged for the scenes, green foliage and candles being used. Fire
Maker and several Wood Gatherers were initiated, after having displayed something of their work.

Eight of the girls then executed several folk dances, among them being the Swedish Folk, the 1-2-3, the French Peasant,
and a dance around the May Pole, erected in the center of the stage and decorated with red and black
streamers which were wound and unwound as they danced. The music for the occasion was furnished by the College Orchestra
and Miss Hattie Thompson.

The members of the local Campfire who participated were: Misses Willie Campbell (Wichaka), Dorothy Finlayson (Amatola), Willie Henderson (Natchanineo), Elizabeth
Grey (Assheweaua), Mary Thompson (Anouki), Floice Martin (Artsila), Sarah Lingle (Wenonah), Elizabeth Cranford (Anockous), and Miss Irena Foreman, leader.

Y. M. C. A. MEETING.

Rev. Bolling Hobson, pastor of the Presbyterian church of Cornelius, addressed a good crowd at the Y. M. C. A.
meeting last Thursday night. All who attended were more than repaid, for Mr. Hobson gave one of the most enjoyable
talks of the year. He chose as his text, “For no man liveth to himself, and no man dieth to
himself.” He showed that everyone, unconsciously perhaps, exerts an influence, either for good or for bad, over those with whom
he comes in contact.
