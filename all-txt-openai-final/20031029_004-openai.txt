**College expects to name new Business VP by December**

**More than 140 apply for top administrative position vacated after the resignation of Robert Norfleet**

In August, college administrators began a search to find a replacement for former Vice President of Business and Finance Robert
Norfleet, who stepped down last summer to pursue other interests. With the applicant screening process nearing its end, the candidate
pool has been narrowed, and the new V.P. should be selected by December, said college President Bobby Vagt. The recruiting
involves both telephone and on-campus interviews.

For the opening, the college emphasizes the role the new V.P. would play in the Davidson community: “Along with five
other members of the College’s principal management group, the Vice President for Business and Finance reports directly to the President,
and, as such, participates with this group and the President in formulating broad strategic and managerial policies and decisions, across
all areas of the College, for the direction and future of the institution.”

In addition to these broad goals, Vagt stresses the importance of growth in endowment, information technology, and physical infrastructure, among
various other needs. “This is a good job, and I’m not talking just salary,” said Vagt.

As the search for Norfleet’s successor comes to a close, the administration outlines the advantages of the position. “This is
a good job, and I’m not talking just salary,” said Vagt. He accentuated the benefits of the position, both professionally
and personally, such as the community in which the individual would work and live.

Norfleet, who graduated from Davidson in 1970, served the college at this position for over a decade, bringing about several
positive changes and innovations to the Davidson community. Most notable of these in recent memory was his role in the
construction of the crew team’s boathouse in 2000. He was particularly sympathetic to the biology department, supporting many of their
projects and valuing the importance of recycling.

Currently, Norfleet is serving the college on an interim basis as the Sr. Executive Director of I.T. and Investments, focusing
primarily on endowment enrichment and Information Technology Services.

**Ghosts, from page 5**

Around the turn of the 20th century, a medical college was established on campus. The dissection lab changed buildings several
times — first a house called “Old Danville” across from the President’s home, and eventually an old wooden building in
the forest behind Chambers. A quick check of campus geography reveals that the dissection lab rested where the library is
today. Hardworking students would have no reason to fear studying in their carrels late into the night had the dissection
lab been a normal, decent, scientific facility. Not quite so.

A local teenager, Sam Thompson, knew that the medical college dissection lab would need cadavers — and he knew where
to find them. After a funeral, he would visit the old cemetery, now behind the golf course, and dig up
corpses. Once when Thompson was delivering a body back to the lab, some folks caught sight of the canvas-covered bulk
in his cart. Shaking the body, he whined, “Come on, you’re not THAT drunk!” and escaped accusation.

Thompson’s schemes were eventually uncovered. Someone in the lab recognized his cadaver’s prominent gold tooth and realized he was a
man who had just died in town. The college was sued for a few thousand dollars, but Davidson’s self-admitted “gravedigger”
continued his crimes. He later attended the College and graduated with the class of 1904. Blodgett suspects that the...Unsettled spirits
of stolen cadavers may be haunting the site of their injustice. “The conditions are right,” she advises. Seniors—the new class
of ’04—are especially cautioned to avoid the library this Halloween.

Pranks from the past

The “roaring '20s” was a decade of spooky campus hoaxes. On Halloween of 1922, some students decided to enthrone the
Biology department’s favorite skeleton by the Old Well. As they worked, they noticed a dark cloaked figure approaching. The students
were spell-bound with fear until one of them sneezed. The students seized the opportunity to run. The faculty member just
chuckled.

Not to be outdone, the students of 1923 orchestrated a Halloween decorating frenzy, converting Phi Hall into a “fire hall”
and hanging furniture like piano stools and stoves in the trees on Chambers Lawn. They decorated Main Street as well,
changing its sign to read “Fifth Avenue” and Depot Street to “Wall Street.” Halloween 1924 saw streamers hung from trees
and some classrooms and offices littered with hay and populated with cows and rams. Though it’s been a while since
these elaborate schemes occurred, Davidson’s ongoing ghost tradition attests to the age-old Halloween spirit that still lingers on this campus.

Vandalism, from page 1

Residents living in the target areas are warned that they are charged for damage to the lounges and bathrooms of
residence halls if no one agrees to take the blame. Marsicano said, “All residents are responsible for unclaimed damage in
the common areas of the building. For example, all Knox residents shared the $275 fee for an inappropriately discharged fire
extinguisher when no one acknowledged setting it off.” Those guilty of vandalizing property are taken before the Judicial Committee, which
proceeds to determine an appropriate punishment for their specific offense.

Walker is taking several steps to prevent future acts of vandalism. His plan includes increasing the number of officers on
duty during the weekend and encouraging community involvement in protecting campus property. Some students think that the sporadic nature of
the vandalism makes it difficult to inhibit. Chuck Ostendorff ’06 said, “I don’t think vandalism can be prevented because the
incidents are so random; they can’t try to protect everything.” Walker recognizes this obstacle but hopes to overcome it with
collective student participation. “As an agency we are addressing the issues as best we can; unfortunately, it is more of
a reactive response because the acts are random... Our agency would like to take a more proactive approach which would
mean the Davidson College community would have to help.” This proactive response will include a crime prevention program that is
based on students aggressively looking out for crimes around campus and consistently reporting incidents.

Vandalism incidents from this year as well as last year have impacted the future of various projects on campus. Because
of the consistent mistreatment of the community “Red Bikes” in the past, bikes are now being assigned according to freshmen
hall. Each hall will receive one bike and will be responsible for its maintenance in order to instill a sense
of ownership and discourage future damage.

Several SGA plans have been affected by vandalism as well. In response to the KKK graffiti, SGA intends on doing
some sort of project, such as a mural near the site of the graffiti, to send a message of peace
and unity. SGA is also considering funding more of the popular green lawn chairs for the upcoming spring, but because
of students’ past abuse of the chairs, it is now attempting to put out a heavy-duty porch swing instead so
that students will not be able to harm it. SGA expects to dedicate the swing in memory of Katherine Costa
’03 and hopes that, as a result, students will have a sense of respect for the swing and be less
inclined to damage it.

The reopening of the Belk computer labs as 24-hour labs is also contingent on students’ treatment of the facility (see
SGA column). The labs were previously closed because students did not respect them, and if future vandalism occurs, it will
resume its earlier hours.

Students have expressed varied reactions in response to the recent vandalism. Some students are not interested in the incidents at
all. Pat McConville ’06 said, “The administration cares more about vandalism than students because they are more concerned with the
school’s image and appearance.” Students also debated about the root cause of the vandalism. Graham Hunter ’06 said, “When parties
are forced to end at 2 a.m., I think some people become aggravated and bored and start taking out their
frustration on school property.”

The administration encourages students to accept responsibility for their actions concerning vandalism and report anyone they know who has mistreated
campus property. Marsicano criticizes students who have failed in the past to report certain acts of vandalism, saying, “It is
a bit disturbing that Davidson students are not taking responsibility for their actions and that their neighbors are not holding
them accountable. I hope we can work on that.”
