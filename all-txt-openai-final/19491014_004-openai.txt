A sports writer for a newspaper in a nearby town had this to say following Davidson’s win over N. C. State: “Local Touchdown Club members should have known Davidson was going to beat State. After all, Coach Charles Jamerson had almost said as much at last week's huddle of the local group. It couldn’t have happened to a nicer coach or a finer bunch of boys.” Incidentally, By GORDON SCOTT

There’s little that can be added from this corner to all that has been said and written about last Saturday night’s sparkling performance by the Cats. It was as good an example of a team win as any game we've ever seen. The boys were “up” for the game. As Auburn Lambeth had put it, “We’re ashamed of the way we’ve been playing. We're gonna win that game.” Buddy Chandler, who played the kind of a game that coaches dream about, told Athletic Director Pinkney before the game, “I want you to watch me in there Saturday night. I’m going to play the best game of guard you've ever seen...” Who would deny that he was right? And that’s the way the whole team felt. They wanted that win bad, and grabbed it.

PICK YOUR OWN

On the surface, it looks like it would be a simple job to pick a Wildcat of the Week from Davidson's outstanding performers. However, we tried and gave up. At the end of the first half, C. L. Runyan looked like a sure bet for the selection. Then during the second half, it became more apparent that the line had its share of stars... Chandler, Eborn, Stricklin, Carnegie, Lambeth, Wilson, McNeely, Kiser, Sharpe, to name a few. Charlie Rimer turned in the best exhibition of his college career running from blocking back. Lambeth and Sifford kept up their scintillating play of previous games. And then there was Jake Wade who out-guessed and out-maneuvered the Wolfpack receivers in intercepting three passes in the fleeting moments of the game; one good for 95 yards and the game-winning touchdown.

CONFERENCE CHAMPS? COULD BE...

As soon as the newspapers came out Monday morning with conference standings, it was noted by many that Davidson was tied with the loop leaders. But it didn’t stop there. Talk has already begun about Davidson winning the Southern Conference. Sounds silly, doesn’t it? But just a minute... it's a possibility. There are five conference games remaining on the Cat schedule—Richmond, Furman, The Citadel, VMI, and W&L—five hard games. Davidson could lose all of them, but if they're in there fighting, it’s more likely that they could win them all. It will largely be a question of keeping the team keyed up mentally for the games each week. Might help if the student body and administration would talk it up and let the team know that they believe a Conference Championship is a possibility, even though right now it seems a little remote.

HERE AND THERE

Coach Boyd Baird fields his untested Frosh eleven this afternoon against Furman Frosh. Baird has some talent that will bear watching... Sophomore Tom Stockton came home first for the Wildcat Harriers in their loss to State last Saturday morning... Looks like we have another Gunder Gray coming up... Charlie Rimer played the whole game at offensive blocking back against State, although a shoulder injury had prevented him from dressing out for practice the week before... State students were heard singing “Goodbye Beattie” after the game Saturday night... Dickey, State's red-headed hardwood star, was among those leaving Memorial Stadium with a long face... Ray Brown, who scouted the St. Louis team last weekend, reports that the Billikens are “big, mean, and tough, with only one man in the line weighing less than 200 pounds.”

LAMBETH, SIFORD, YOU NAME HIM — THEY ALL DESERVE IT

Wildcat Of The Week

By DAN McKEITHAN

“They were the greatest I've ever seen” were the words of Coach Charley Jamerson about the fighting Wildcats who pulled a great team victory over highly-favored State last Saturday night. How could any individual player be singled out as the outstanding Wildcat? It was every member of the team who went about performing his own job in an inspired way that made the victory possible. It took every man working together to beat a good team, to beat a school which Davidson had not beaten since 1936. A good nomination for the top Wildcat man would be little Jake Wade, who pulled the game out of the fire with that much-talked-of 95-yard run in the closing minutes, not to mention those two interceptions.

Runyan Honored

Wednesday afternoon’s papers carried the not-too-surprising news that C. L. Runyan, who covered himself with mud and glory against State Saturday night, was named Sophomore of the Week in the Southern Conference. The selection was made by writers of the Associated Press. Runyan was practically a one-man team.During the first half, he ground out 77 yards rushing and booted two well-aimed punts within the State three-yard line. Congratulations, C. L. A Davidson salutes you.

You couldn't go wrong picking Fullback C. L. Runyan, who was picked by the Associated Press as sophomore of the week. His two kicks, which went out of bounds on the State one and three-yard lines, were overshadowed by his brilliant plunging in the first half. Never to be outdone, the always dependable Auburn Lambeth completed ten of 16 passes for 121 yards and one touchdown, and, as if that wasn't enough, ran over for the Cats’ first score. But why leave out the best all-around back on the squad, Jimmy Sifford? The speedy Sifford looked very good on receiving passes, especially the short one he took for 32 yards and paydirt; and he also hit on two out of three passes. We could go on mentioning Woody Leach, Charlie Rimer, and other backs. You say we're leaving out that end play of Hal Mapes? Nobody could miss him when he was cutting down that end-run interference or singlehandedly pulling down his man. Speaking of ends, glue-fingered Mott Price continued to pull in passes to keep his high national rating. Have we gone through the nominations without the name of Henry Wilson? You simply can’t fail to mention the boy that’s one of the hardest drivers in the business. There weren't many tackles in which Henry wasn’t involved, and one State drive was halted by Wilson’s interception. We'll string along with the Charlotte News in its pick of the Wildcats as the TEAM of the Week. We'll let you pick the Wildcat of the Week if you can.

WILSON'S FIRST SPEECH
President Woodrow Wilson’s first public speech was delivered at Davidson College in 1873. A freshman, Wilson spoke to a college literary society on the advantages of a Republican form of government.

It would be a sin to overlook guards like Buddy Chandler and Bob Sharpe. Chandler was seen in the enemy backfield more than a few times. Not only were Sandy Carnegie, Carl Eborn, and Ernie Stricklin stalwarts at tackles, but also were their replacements, Sophomores Jerry Kiser and Bill McNeely, who used their beef to good advantage. Yes, we saw the tremendous defensive line.

Certainly not those fighting Wildcats. They started moving the ball with C. L. Runyan carrying the brunt of the load. Then on the third play of the second period, Auburn Lambeth sliced over right tackle and capped a 39-yard drive into a hole by his brilliant coffin corner kicking. Hal Mapes kicked the point, and it was 7-7 at the half, and the stands were beginning to warm up to the situation. On the kickoff at the second half, Ed Mooney raced 80 yards to score, and this perhaps lulled the State team into docility, for the Wildcats again took over and ran all over State’s vaunted line. Then after two minutes of the fourth quarter had elapsed, Lambeth lobbed an eight-yard pass to Jimmy Sifford in the flat, and he sped down the sidelines to send the Cat supporters into hysterics, from which they were plunged back into gloom when Hal Mapes missed the extra point. Everybody thought it was all over then, but a glorious moment was yet to come. After State had driven down to Davidson's nine-yard line using the “T”, Quarterback Ogden Smith faded back for a pass, and the rest is history. Little Jake folded it in and, making like a rabbit in front of hounds, chugged 95 yards while everybody from Davidson went crazy. Then, as if to prove that it was no freak, Jake intercepted two more passes of Bill Thompson’s to put the game on ice.

Davidson will undoubtedly have victory in mind when they meet St. Louis’ Billikens tomorrow afternoon across the Mississippi at 2:00 C.S.T. (3 p.m. E.S.T.). Contrary to the opinion of many, everything did not cease to function in the world of football when the long-looked-for win over the Wolves from Raleigh came last Saturday night. There remain seven more games on the slate, and as Coach Charley said earlier in the season, “We'll play them one at a time this year.”

The big question on the mind of the Wildcat supporters tonight, on the eve of their second intersectional clash of the fall, is this: Can the Davidson attack continue to operate as it did Saturday night in Charlotte, and will their defensive outfit be able to stop the T-formation, a nemesis to them in both the Army and Presbyterian games? St. Louis, better known for its basketball brilliance than grid prowess, nevertheless sports a pretty fair ball club. Its line is one of the largest in the nation, easily averaging a cool 220 pounds. State was supposed to have a rugged wall, but C. L. Runyan cracked it often and hard enough to earn the Associated Press title of Southern Conference Sophomore of the Week. Davidson’s Bob Sharpe and Buddy Chandler proved a good match for the Pack’s touted Musser and Watts, and all around Davidson looked far more like the club that gave Army a nice fight than the one that played dead in the home opener to Presbyterian. All week Coach Charley has warned the crew of an air of complacency following the State win. It was that air that lost the Presbyterian contest. This week's clash with the Billikens may well set the pattern for the rest of Davidson's season. It will show whether they have truly bounced back from the P. C. loss as a different ball club or just as one which blew its wrath on State. As usual, the attack will center around brilliant passing by Auburn Lambeth, and his pet receivers, Mott Price and Pete Brown in the air, and Jimmy Sifford, C. L. Runyan, and (how-could-you-help-but-include-him) Jake Wade on the ground. With the possible exception of (Continued On Page Five)
