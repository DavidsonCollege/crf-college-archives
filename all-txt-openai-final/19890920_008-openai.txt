Along with 379 freshmen, Davidson College opened its doors to 23 new professors this year.

Three of these are Arnold James, Knight Faculty Fellow and assistant professor of psychology; Peter Ahrensdorf, assistant professor of political science and humanities; and Lisa Jadwin, visiting assistant professor of English.

The newcomers have already expressed their first impressions of Davidson students. James characterizes them as “people who are aware of their thoughts and feelings and very confident in communicating them.”

“They seem very astute and good-humored,” added Ahrensdorf. After her first few weeks here, Jadwin commented that “Davidson students are extremely well-prepared in general and for class.”

Of these three professors, only James is a legitimate Southerner. A native of Columbia, South Carolina, he is a graduate of the University of South Carolina. At U.S.C. he earned a bachelor’s degree in psychology and health education and a master’s degree in public health education.

James is currently working on his doctoral dissertation, “The Psychology of Anger As It Relates to the Development of Hypertension.”

James is a clinical psychologist, a branch of psychology that focuses on abnormal behavior.

According to James, one reason he chose this field is because he “loves talking to people and getting paid for it.”

James comes to Davidson as a Knight Faculty Fellow—a minority retention fellowship. In psychological jargon, he describes Davidson as “a very good person-environment fit.”

Born in the Philippines, Ahrensdorf was raised in Washington, D.C. He received his bachelor’s degree from Yale University and moved to the University of Chicago to begin his post-graduate work. He taught at Kenyon College in Ohio while finishing his dissertation, “The Conflict Between Political Philosophy and Religion As It Is Investigated in Plato’s Phaedo.”

Alternating between English, Spanish, and German during an interview, Ahrensdorf said he wasn’t “thrilled” about the idea of coming to a small town. He repeatedly mentioned “the emphasis on teaching at Davidson” and commented upon the “open relationship between teachers and students.”

Jadwin is a native of California. After receiving her bachelor’s degree at the University of California at Davis, she migrated to the East Coast for her post-graduate studies.

Jadwin received her doctorate from Princeton University—in her dissertation she studied the “relationship between fiction writing and lying.”

Davidson is Jadwin’s first professional assignment. She came because of the “atmosphere” and the fact that it is a “teaching-oriented” school. Jadwin appropriately described her department as “relaxed and congenial.”
