MINORITY, from page 13

Keep the lack of minority students at Davidson in mind when we implement this increase. We need to create literature
addressing minorities. I call upon the Dean of Students and his staff to create programs to retain and aid minority
students at Davidson. One reason minority students are reluctant to come to Davidson is because there is a lack of
an adequate support system. Not only is Davidson frigid to minority students, it is also hostile. We can learn from
other liberal-arts schools who have implemented a host of programs directed at helping minority students. A support system for minority
students must be initiated by the school and not by students. I call upon the Dean of Academics and his
staff to recruit and retain minority faculty. Again, there is a pool of qualified minority professors in this country. To
support this fact, we only need to look at two Davidson minority educators, Gail Gibson and Julio Ramirez, who in
recent years were chosen by CASE as the best professors in North Carolina. If the atmosphere is receptive and warm,
we will be able to attract and retain minority professors. One short-term solution is to bring visiting minority professors from
the area to teach ethnic-related courses. However, this is not a long-term solution; it should not serve as a substitute
for retaining regular faculty.

I believe that one key to change is money. Unquestionably, it will take a considerable amount to recruit and retain
minority students, faculty, and administration. It will also take money to create and implement programs to aid minority students. Davidson
has recently made public its $150 million endowment campaign. I call upon our administration to reserve $4 or $5 million
to subsidize the aforementioned programs. I call upon the Vice-President for Institutional Advancement to solicit funds from the abundance of
organizations, foundations, and trusts who support and aid minority programs throughout the nation.

Lastly, and most importantly, I call upon the President and the Board of Trustees to create a committee and establish
a work-plan that will produce a richer diversification of students, faculty, administrators, and courses at Davidson. If the President and
the Board are unwilling to increase the number of minorities and ethnic-related courses, our efforts will prove fruitless. We need
their commitment and leadership. Davidson needs and has the ability to change. Davidson has demonstrated this ability in the past.
Last decade, we recognized the need to enroll women. Our students, faculty, administrators, and Trustees took appropriate action: committees were
created, studies were made, and reports were produced. The Class of 1993 has an unprecedented number of women: approximately 47
percent, or 179. With this in mind, we now must look forward and change. We need to increase the number
of minority students, faculty, and administrators. We need more African Americans, Hispanics, Asians, and women. We need to have programs
to aid them. We need courses in our curriculum that reflect the rich and unique composition of this country. Finally,
we need to work collectively to consummate this change, the impetus from all areas of the college.
