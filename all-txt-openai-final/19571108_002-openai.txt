THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE

(All Unsigned Editorials by the Editor)

**November 5 And 1960**

Off-year elections in five states proved two things: Democrats were increasing their strength in the North, and their cousins in
the South were piling up votes for continued segregation. The biggest and most far-reaching victory was the re-election of Democratic
Governor Robert B. Meyner of New Jersey. He defeated an Eisenhower Republican, whatever that is, in a landslide. The boot
that kicked Ike is now stepping high in the list of his party's Presidential possibilities for 1960. Democrats also captured
the lower house of the Garden State’s legislature for the first time in 20 years. Across the river, to no
one’s surprise, another Presidential bud blossomed forth as Democratic Mayor Robert F. Wagner scored an easy victory. Democrats scored a
net gain of five mayors in Republican up-state New York. Pennsylvania was the same story. The G.O.P. lost a net
of five mayoralty contests. Pittsburgh Democratic Mayor David L. Lawrence won an unprecedented fourth term, thus making him a possible
occupant for the White House.

In Virginia’s Gubernatorial election, the voters faced a man who was against racial mixing in the schools and one who
was for segregation. In a quantitative decision, the latter candidate, Byrd-Democratic Lindsey Almond, Jr. won. The real fact of importance
here was that Republican-moderate Ted Dalton, in his second try for the state's top office, dropped from a total of
45% of the vote in 1953 to 37% in Tuesday's election.

The chief significance of this for the future is not so much that Eisenhower lost another round or that the
Democrats will have a host of men to choose from in 1960. More important is the fact that when Democrats
from the North and the South get together in Chicago or New York or San Francisco three years from now,
they face the possibility of a real split between invigorated segregationists and revitalized Northern Liberals. Probably the only people to
come out on top will be the Television Networks and the G.O.P.—G.L.W.

**Dangers Of Specialization**

Tuesday night as Davidson physics professors discussed and explained at the Sigma Pi Sigma meeting the satellite situation, it was
obvious, despite their optimism about our ability, that the Russians had technically tromped the United States. The apparent power of
the propulsion plant and the accuracy of their guidance system excelled even our hopes in those fields.

The Western world is reacting instantaneously to the challenge of regaining scientific leadership, but in this contest that will be
won not on a battlefield but rather in a classroom, the spotlight of attention has immediately switched to our education
system. Already there is talk of subsidizing the technical studies of promising youth and of founding a national science academy
similar to the service schools.

But where does this leave the Davidson student or the liberal arts colleges in general? In the mad scramble to
turn out more and better engineers, we ought to heed the caution of one of America’s greatest atomic physicists. In
a 1955 broadcast emphasizing the interrelatedness of the arts and sciences, this Director of the Institute of Advanced Studies warned
that “anyone working at the frontier of such science is a very long way from home, a long way too
from the practical arts that were its matrix and origin as indeed they were of what we today call art.

“The specialization of science is an inevitable accompaniment of progress; yet it is full of dangers, and it is cruelly
wasteful since so much of what is beautiful and enlightening is cut off from most of the world.”

The function of the liberal arts in relating the world of science with the world of laughing and crying people
is indispensable.—J.R.J.

**Organization Student**

A professor in the Science Department read to a group of students the other day a letter from a Davidson
graduate who is now in med-school. The crux of the letter was that med school is easier than Davidson. He
went on to explain that although the work is harder than undergraduate work, he has more time in which to
do it because he is relieved of so many of the outside pressures that existed while he was at Davidson.

This alumnus has pointed out a manifest weakness of our College. There are too many organizations, there are too many
committee meetings. A student who is interested in both getting a good education and being prominent in extra-curricular activities finds
that his time is quickly drained off by the latter.

There are two solutions. First, each organization should re-evaluate itself in terms of purpose and performance and see if it
is really worthwhile. Secondly, the Honorary Fraternity Council should make an extensive study of all campus organizations and see which
ones could perhaps be combined and which ones eliminated. It is well to remind ourselves again that the main purpose
of coming to college is to get an education.—G.L.W.

**YMCA Meets Many Needs**

The Davidson College YMCA has long been a stabilizing force on campus. In fact, its work extends far beyond the
limits of the college grounds. As this week's news bulletin, “The Student-Christian,” pointed out, student preachers carry the work of
the Y to many corners in this area. Because much of the Y’s work is done quietly and off campus,
students in the past have charged it with “not doing anything.” The DAVIDSONIAN is glad to see that this year
the YMCA is sponsoring programs that do attempt to encourage student interest and knowledge in important topics. Tuesday night’s forum
on the union shop is a good example. We support true liberalism expressed in this way. The YMCA has planned
other programs for the year that cover religious, political, and economic topics. The Y is contributing in a vital way
to the intellectual enlightenment of the Davidson student, and it deserves the genuine support of the student body.

**ENDOWMENT STRAINED**

**Who’s To Pay The High Cost Of Education?**

By JIM RICHARDS

Inflationary conditions accompanied by the high cost of living have presented a serious problem to the Davidson College endowment program
as well as an urgent crisis to the individual student.

**INDIVIDUALS HELPED**

At present, each individual student pays only one-half of his educational expenses. The other fifty percent is being supplied by
the college treasury through gifts, grants, and interest from the eight million dollar endowment. This simply means that a great
deal of the money which would ordinarily go for increasing faculty salaries or extended library facilities is now being consumed
for the purpose of helping each individual bear his yearly educational expense.

If the situation continues to develop in the present direction, the time may come when the college will be called
upon to pay an even larger percentage of the educational bill of the student. This would of course result in
numerous problems. The interest from the endowment might be totally consumed each year for this purpose, or the endowment itself
might need to be converted into capital for footing this bill. Another alternative, however, might be a drastic increase in
the tuition and funds which are paid at present. Duke University recently considered this same problem and arrived at the
conclusion that their only solution would be to raise by several hundred dollars their present tuition rate.

**DAVIDSON SOLUTION**

What is the Davidson solution to this present dilemma? Will the college be able to find additional outside sources which
can meet the inflationary rise?

**LETTER TO EDITOR**

**Critic Lashes Lawrence Editorial**

Dear Editor:

We were charmed to discover that the editor of the DAVIDSONIAN has finally hit upon the old controversy about the
ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment as the clincher in his case against human rights for Negroes. Davidson must now have
the best-informed student body in the country on this rather technical point in historical interpretation.

**MASS OF REPRINTS**

We commend the editor for the remarkable devotion to scholarship that caused...him to exclude all student writing from the page
(except for his own).

COFFEE BREAK
Davidson: Test For Church
By BOB JONES

The history of American Protestantism and higher education indicates that there has traditionally been a significant bond between the two.
Of the longstanding colleges and universities of the nation, the vast majority were founded and nurtured by the church. The
colleges in turn supplied the church with well-trained and educated leaders.

TIES SEVERED
In the course of time, however, the outstanding educational institutions have seen fit to sever their ties with the parental
denominations. Harvard, Yale, Williams, Amherst, even Washington and Lee (more on a par with Davidson), etc. have chosen to become
independent of their ecclesiastical heritage. It is interesting to note that except for the Quaker colleges (viz. Swarthmore and Haverford),
the institutions which have led the way in college education are the very ones that have broken the tie with
the church. Explanation for this may lie in the fact that the church has traditionally been the defender of the
status quo. In the control of its colleges, the church may have imparted this conservatism to such a degree that
church colleges lost their position of leadership in education.

The Presbyterian Church, whether she realizes it or not, is being put to the test right at Davidson as to
whether it can continue its tradition of educational leadership. If it does not actively respond, the lead will go to
the non-denominational colleges by default.

PRECEDENT
However, we beg to remind the editor that Anglo-American law is based on precedent, and the Fourteenth Amendment has been
accepted as the law of the land in court decisions for almost a century, so that nothing short of a
revolution is likely to affect the strict legality of the Supreme Court's ruling on civil rights—whatever its historical background.

HUNGARY
And we quote: “Isn't the use of military force to override local government exactly what we deplored in Hungary?” Accepting
the editor's analogy to Little Rock, we wish to point out that Governor Faubus undeniably used the force of state
militia to override the decision of the local school board—the only body authorized to make policies for Little Rock schools.
We deplore the fact that it was necessary for the President to use federal troops to restore law and order
(by local request), and to safeguard the citizens’ rights from mobs and irresponsible demagogues. However, similar Presidential action might have
saved Hungary also!
— Willard Wolfe

Editor's note: The editorial to which reader Wolfe makes reference was written by Mr. David Lawrence, editor of U.S. News
and World Report. It was not written by the editor of the DAVIDSONIAN. Mr. Lawrence is widely recognized and respected
as a newspaper editor, author, and syndicated columnist (230 newspapers). He is an alumnus of Princeton University. We printed Mr.
Lawrence’s editorial because we felt that it got to the heart of a subject that is of vital current importance.
The DAVIDSONIAN holds Mr. Lawrence’s views in high regard.

I THOUGHT TO MYSELF, “SAY, IS THAT BROWN?” BUT THEN I THOUGHT, “NO, THAT BOY LOOKS FATTER THAN CHARLIE BROWN.”

or will the parents of individual students be called upon to pay drastically higher tuition rates? This question is, however,
by no means a local college problem. Recently, The New York Times Sunday edition printed an article concerned with this
general topic. Benjamin Fine pointed out the astounding expense which higher education will bring in the near future.

$3,000,000,000
At present, the nation spends $3,000,000,000 annually for higher education. This figure will have to double by 1970. Mr. Fine
quoted D. C. Josephs, chairman of the President's Committee on Education Beyond High School, who had some ideas on how
this expense should be financed. Josephs said, “Students should pay a much greater share of their college costs than they
do. Tuition fees of $3,500 do not seem out of line for the returns a student will get from his
college education. If parents cannot afford high tuition fees, they should finance their children’s education on a long-term basis. It
is estimated that a degree is worth $100,000. That's a pretty good investment for the money a student puts in
to get it.”

With a knowledge of the national scene, we might return to the local Davidson problem still faced with a choice
between two solutions. Either the college must make a substantial increase in her tuition or find outside sources to make
up the ever-increasing deficit.

BUT SINCE I’VE LOST A LITTLE WEIGHT LATELY,

NEWS BRIEFS
By HUGO MISLE

NEW SUMMIT TALKS
The month of December in Paris will be the setting of the new Summit Conference of the fourteen heads of
the North Atlantic Alliance. President Eisenhower is to present a plan at the Conference designed to recapture the military and
propaganda initiative from Russia. The President has called seventeen experts into an extraordinary White House meeting to study this new
plan.

SOVIET-SYRIAN PACT
On October 28, Syria signed a pact for economic aid from the Soviet Union; the aid will be of a
monetary nature and will be used to build railroads, dams, bridges, and factories so badly needed by this Middle-Eastern country.

RADIO VATICAN
For the first time in history, the Pope will be able to contact the uttermost part of the world through
a two and one-half million dollar radio station which has Western Europe's most powerful short-wave transmitter.

FRANCE WITHOUT A GOVERNMENT
France has been without a government for more than a month. This crisis is in the mind of the Allied
officials while plans are being made for the Summit Conference. Internally, France is suffering runaway inflation, strikes, and civil strife.
On the international scene, the Algerian crisis continues to absorb the major portion of French military and economic resources.

ON CAMPUS
Plutocratic Jaunt
By PHIL LEWIS

Well, we finally break back into print after a two-week (deserved) silence, and none too soon. All the big wheels
of this sheet are going away on a plutocratic jaunt to New York, where they are going to observe the
workings of “The New Republic” to gain some insight into liberal journalism. Trask is going to visit his favorite daily:
(The Daily Worker, that is). Hope you all have a real cool time, even if we weren’t invited.

Did you hear the one Ed Stewart is telling about the Smutnik? Okay, Ed, the jig is up. Speaking of
rockets and such, the service in the Snack Bar is certainly not rocket fast. We were there Wednesday afternoon, and
found it took impossibly long to get service. We hate to concede anything to ‘Conformity’, but the cartoon was too
true to be ignored. Mr. Poteat take note!!!

PINK PUTTEES
The Office of the Airmarshal Knight Commander, Fairman Cumming, second in command of the Peon Army, has announced that pink
puttees will be worn at the Grand Review Saturday at the Wofford game.

Dr. Staples’ idea of getting new hymnals for the Church seemed real good at first, but it seems to us
that the same old hymns are being used. How about a little variety?

BIG TIME
Overheard by Dr. Abernethy after the West Virginia Tech game: “Well, what did you expect? After all, we can’t hope
to win against a Big Time school like Davidson.”

When in doubt...
