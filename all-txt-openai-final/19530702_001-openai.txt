**LETTER TO THE EDITOR**

June 30, 1943
Davidson, N.C.

Editor:
Many of the students, both upperclassmen and freshmen, have been laughing and ridiculing the rumor that the honorable Court of
Control is to begin functioning during this summer session. With this letter, let it be known to everyone concerned that
the Court of Control will hear every and all complaints that come to its attention.

Upperclassmen may file a complaint by seeing one of the four members of the Court now in summer school and
by signing a statement.

**July 2, 1953 Number 2**

To continue along the same idea, it has been noticed that two or more of you men of '57 are
lacking salt water to be sharks in. That powder, even if it is purchased from that money which you pay
in, isn't to be used to make mud pies with nor are the pool tables as sand piles. Remember, you
are about to enter the four happiest years of your life, so let's start off right.

As a last suggestion, a march on Jood Morton and Ralph Johnson would be quite called for and no one
would object. Tell them to put a sound bowl on your head and spin you around twice.

Perhaps I have been too sarcastic and bitter in my first paragraph, but rightly so I think. In the spring
of 1923, the Court was established completely void of any ideas of harsh treatment and hazing to freshmen. Rather, it
was formed with the idea of instilling into the new members of the student body the spirit of the true
Davidson Gentleman.

The members of the Court who are now in school are gravely concerned with the attitude which many of the
freshmen have brought from high school. Furthermore, some members of the administration have expressed their desire to see this dire
problem solved.

Generally, I think the upperclassmen agree that it would be expecting too much to expect all eleven of the Freshmen
Regulations to be enforced; however, several of the traditions and regulations that are to be honored are as found below.
Since many of you men are seeking to enter the gates of Hades this fall, I think it would be
wise that, since some will make the grade, you enter into our tradition of speaking to everyone. You will find
that, regardless of the grades you make now, this habit will be beneficial throughout life. The only other regulation which
is printed that is of any importance is that of showing respect to upperclassmen and faculty members.

As advice to you, I suggest that some of you trade clothing with some of the boys who stand on
the northwest corner of Independence Square in Charlotte. You will get buttons soon enough, but not the kind that meow
and wear ten-inch hats. Seriously, you will better your character and earn greater respect for yourself if you have the
guts to leave your purring at home or with that 46-year-old girl.

The Court does have the power to enforce its orders. It can request that the Student Council remove from the
student body any freshman whom it deems unfit to be in our organization. Such a request has never been turned
down. Less serious punishment is ostracism.

In rereading this letter, Mr. Editor, I notice that I have directed it more to the freshmen. I hope that
you will see fit to publish this and to further its cause.

Sincerely,
L. E. R. B. '53

**SUNDAY SCHOOL EXTENSION**

Stan Topple says that the Sunday School Extension's summer program is being carried on at the Sanatorium below Huntersville. There
are many people at the Sanatorium, though, who want lessons but who do not have teachers. The Extension program consists
of going to the Sanatorium on Sunday morning about 9:30.

Once there, the boys split up and can teach to whom they please. There is a wide choice of places
to teach: single rooms, double rooms, etc. Each teacher may follow a printed lesson or may make his own lessons.

It is a good opportunity for those interested in helping to do a good job that will be appreciated. The
folks at the Sanatorium will be grateful to you for your work.

Several student suggestions have come in for flicks on Saturday night as well. We will have one on Saturday, the
seventh, with a dance afterwards.
