**Hodson Hall is alive with the sounds of music**

By JENNIFER BEAN

Row after row of elevated, cushioned chairs lead to the base of an open stage where black and white shine
in the form of a Grand Piano. The setting? Hodson Hall, an auditorium easily located on campus in the Cunningham
Fine Arts Building. Its purpose? To serve as a cultural arm of the college where the musically interested can express
and share their art with others. The force behind the setting? None other than the students and faculty found in
the college’s own Music Department.

What makes this department so extraordinary? Head of the piano program James Swisher states, “On one hand, the music department
is like any other department in that we teach courses in history, appreciation, and theory; however, the cultural aspect of
our department brings the college into the public eye. The only other department that can do this is Athletics; the
only difference is we never have a losing season.”

Lee Nagendran, a junior Flute performance major, appreciates the advantages of Davidson’s Music Department in another sense: “Since we are
all involved in a liberal arts curriculum we are better musicians; we appreciate things from different angles due to different
realms of training.”

During spring term, this force will combine with the setting to produce a series of student recitals. Each recital will
begin at 8:15 p.m. in Hodson Hall. The Davidson College Brass Quintet is (from left to right): Hugh Anders Ahlberg
Lee, Carl Whipple, Chelley Alexander, Jim Patterson, and Calvin Martin. They will perform April 28 at 7 p.m. in the
900 Room.

Scheduled performances include:
- May 2—Nancy Castle, oboe and Stephen Dubberly, piano;
- May 3—Alice Shuffield, flute and Stephen Dubberly, piano;
- May 4—Susie Grant, soprano and Stephen Dubberly, piano;
- May 6—Melissa Givens, soprano and Ray Thornton, piano;
- May 8—Carl Whipple, trombone and Stephen Dubberly, piano;
- May 9—Ray Thornton, piano;
- May 10—Andy Bright, piano; and
- May 11—Hugh Lee, trombone.

Perhaps the most advantageous aspect of this department is that it does not limit itself to the exceptionally talented. Instead,
as head of the department, Dr. Bill Lawing mentions: “We are here to provide not only a service, but to
exist as an opportunity for all.”

These groups consist of the Wind Ensemble, Jazz Ensemble, Concert Choir, Davidson College Chorus, Opera Workshop, and the most recent
addition, the String Ensemble. There are also several smaller variations of these groups such as the Davidson College Brass Quintet
which will perform in the 900 Room at 7 p.m. on April 28.

In addition to all this, Davidson’s Music Department just keeps on growing. One example is the recent addition of resident
Strings instructor, Karen Gerbrecht. Looking towards the future, the department has cast a hopeful eye at the 92 applicants, spotting
over 25 strings players. If all goes as planned, Davidson may soon have an orchestra of its own.

The college itself is also beginning to realize the necessity and importance of its music department. For the first time
in over 30 years, the department has been allowed to appoint a new, full-time faculty position. They have chosen a
professor who specializes in Renaissance dance music, and who has the ability, says Dr. Lawing, “to really augment our program.”

Whether it is rock, jazz, pop, or classical, the notes that float out of dormitory windows prove that music is
a prevalent commodity in the average student’s life. For this reason, it is a shame not to take advantage of
the many opportunities offered by the music department. The setting is there, so why not take advantage of it? After
all, says Lee Nagendran, “Music at Davidson is fun, low-key, and low pressure, but it’s also a great experience to
get to know people, and most of all, to get to know music.”

**Meet the friendly spectres who live next door in Beetlejuice**

By BRUCE PLOURDE

An English major’s work is never done. An English major turns every word into a double-entendre, every glance into a
suggestion, every event into an allegory. And everything relates to sex, somehow or other. Beetlejuice is an English major’s horn
of plenty, a five-minute shopping spree at the Eastland mall, a golden Easter egg hunt. Dealing with death and the
afterlife, Beetlejuice presents a very definite and somewhat alarming view of the possibilities which can follow anHere is the cleaned

unexpected swim in a very deep river. The world of death is not heaven, hell, brimstone and fire, saints and
apostles, gorgons and incubi, merely people passing time near where they passed on. Yet, properly understood allegorically, the house where
Adam (Alec Baldwin) and Barbara (Geena Davis) must spend their shadowy existences represents a sort of heaven for them. Whenever
they step outside their domain, they enter an allegorical hell, where the dreaded sandworms sail through the surfy sand. Only
when the new owners of the house move in does the place become a sort of purgatory. Or rather, it
could be a representation of limbo. If only Mr. Beetlegeuse (Michael Keaton) hadn’t come along—See what trouble can result from
the simple mind of a typical English major? Beetlejuice has no high-falootin’ notions that need foot-long four-dollar words to describe.
It’s a fun movie which takes an odd look at the afterlife, guaranteed to evoke an occasional yuk, while the
titter connoisseur may not stop laughing until on the road and well nigh Davidson again.

A recently married couple, Adam and Barbara, move into their ideal oak-floor and metal-tub house in the picturesque countryside of
Connecticut. They are simply charming, a quite middle-of-the-road pair of kids, until they haphazardly swerve to avoid a dog and
end up in the river. Thus they die before they can really enjoy their new dwelling. But they aren’t aware
that they have died until a while later, when they pick up their newly delivered copy of The Handbook for
the Recently Deceased, which lets them know in somewhat uncertain terms that it might be prudent to cancel their subscription
to Time. Their house, they learn, is their realm for the next 125 years while they await processing for something
beyond. They don’t have any great objection to spending eternity in their beautiful new home. Not until the flakes move
in. The husband, although too quaint, remains the most sane and real part of the family. His wife Delia, a
sculptor with a finely honed sense of the distasteful, only relates to the world through her oddly “artistic” impulses and
her nouveau-riche sense of fashion. Her round friend Otho only serves to encourage her behavior, him—

Students

After completing a term paper, mid-term examinations or the end of a long week, college students want to turn on
their radios and listen to something other than Bach or Beethoven. They want to listen to alternative musicians like Laurie
Anderson and Mojo Nixon, and learn about campus news from a student point of view.

To address such a concern, three Davidson juniors have turned to a form of inexpensive, old-fashioned radio technology: carrier current.
With this medium, a student plugs a radio into the wall and receives the station’s programming directly through the building’s
electrical system, which also acts as an antenna. The students have been planning the station—WALT for Alternative Radio—for the last
six months, and hope to have it operating by the first school day of the 1988-89 school year. National officials
say it’s an appropriate system for a college campus.

“Carrier-current provides a small area of reception allowing a student with a battery-run radio to pick up the signal if
he is within the walls of the building through which the current is operating,” says Jeff Tellis, president of the
Intercollegiate Broadcasting System in Vails Gate, N.Y. Tellis says the founders of the system originated the idea of carrier current
stations in 1940. Carrier-current stations are common on college campuses. Though accurate figures are difficult to determine because carrier-current stations
come and go without the approval of the Federal Communications Commission, Tellis estimates that there are approximately 300-400 such stations
at schools across the country. “Just their existence is testimony that they work,” Tellis says.

The students, Frank Lord, Tyler Smith and Kevin Dunn, say WALT programming will consist of music samples not heard frequently
from area radio stations. And because WDAYV, the FM radio station licensed to the trustees of Davidson College, already broadcasts
classical music, there will be no Bach and Beethoven. “We're interested in appealing to the full spectrum of student involvement
and interests,” Dunn says.
