innings: R. Davidson 200 000—2 Ga. Tech 100 000 041—6 Tech took the second from the Wildcats by a score
of 5 to 0. This was an uneventful game as regards spectacular plays and hitting. The Jackets hit in bunches
and in the first and the third innings scored their runs. Asbury for Tech pitched a good game and kept
the Red and Black followers scoreless. Both the fielding machines worked nicely and both teams put through several double plays.
Cassel at short played a good game for D. C., handling several awkward chances easily. Miley pitched a good game
and the score would have been less had not his support committed several errors. Tech started the bloody work in
the first when Ingram got a life when McArn fumbled his roller. Flowers sacrificed him to second and he came
home on a single by Settle. Barron singled, Settle taking third. Barron pilfered second and Webb was walked, making the
bases drunk. Wheeler singled to deep right, clearing the hassocks. In the third Ingram singled to left and went to
second on error, Barron gaining first. Both men advanced on a sacrifice and were scored by a two-bagger by Turner.

FRESH-SOPH DEBATE (Continued from page 1) negative, gave two arguments: First, our relation to other countries would be hindered. Second,
we would be changed to a nation ambitious for military training. Houghton had plenty of life in his speech and
gave a good argument. The rebuttals were spirited and showed good preparation. The judges then gave in their decision that
the Eus had triumphed and that Bray for the Phis and Bitzer for the Eus were the medal winners.

COMMENCEMENT INVITATIONS OUT The commencement invitations arrived last week. They are being distributed by five men chosen from the Senior
class. These invitations are more attractively designed than in former years. Instead of the Davidson seal they are decorated with
the letters D. C. and the class numeral underneath. Every man is urged to get his allotted number of these
invitations, and at least send his parents or some alumnus one. Students should send out all of these invitations and
have the largest crowd at the nineteen-twenty commencement that Davidson has ever seen.
