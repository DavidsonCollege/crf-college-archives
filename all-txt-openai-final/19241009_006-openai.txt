run of the game, when Savory, the most dangerous back on the field, on a reverse play and raced for
Fresh aside) Cut to Eighteen 60 yards until Hendrix and Baker nabbed him at once on the Red and Black
17-yard line. Here the Davidson line showed its defensive strength, holding the Richmond backs for downs. Tom Baker and Boggs
showed the greatest fighting strength among the Davidson forwards as the little red-headed tackle broke through the heavier Richmond forwards
time after time to spill the interference on to get the man with the ball. In the last half, Bohannon
was death on all end runs, diving into the three-man interference that came around his end and spilling the whole
machine that threatened to overpower him. Often he raced around the interference to get his man. Again in the last
quarter the Davidson team was deprived of a touchdown when Wick Black made one of his famous driving bucks to
the Richmond two-yard line, Davidson being called back on penalty. The last half was played almost entirely in the Richmond
territory. Frantic attempts to tie the score were frequently made by the Blue team. Both sides used the aerial attack
in the first half, but to no success. A running account of the game follows:

SPECIALIST SAYS FOOTBALL Students Fit to Fight ’Em

Public announcement of a physical examination, held for the members of the varsity football squad, has been recently made by
Coach “Monk” Younger, director of athletics. The examination, made by Dr. Wannamaker, widely known heart and lung specialist of the
Monroe Clinic of the Charlotte Sanitarium, was held in the gymnasium on the nights of September 25th and 26th.

Approximately 40 of the leading candidates of the football squad were examined by Dr. Wannamaker, and were found to be
in excellent physical condition. Every member of the varsity squad, through the courtesy of Dr. Monroe, of Charlotte, underwent strenuous
examination, which would have revealed any existing physical defects. It is exceedingly encouraging to the members of the coaching staff,
as well as to the players themselves, that no infirmities were discovered.

Old Jupe Pluvius released his hold on the Davidson campus and all kinds of athletics have been introduced, one of
the leaders being tennis. Mac Beall announced it in chapel and in one day some 75 contestants had entered. The
tournament is only for those who are out for the second team, the winners comprising the second team. From 10
to 15 matches are played every day and the survivors are fast diminishing.

Those who are still in the running are John Parks, Ed Borris, J. P. McNight, Jimmie Wharton, W. A. Alexander,
Wood Brown, W. B. Mattison, R. W. Carr, Guiton Smith, L. M. McCutcheon, and Crosland.

All Net Men Eliminated Except Eleven Leaders

Four More Rounds to Bring Champion Tennis Player Into College Limelight

The courts are in excellent shape and are in use from early morning until dark. Some good tennis is being
played every day and when anyone wins a match, the enthusiasm of the court is beginning to rise.Match it is
after a long, hot struggle. The elimination is in the fourth round and if nothing happens, the finals will be
reached in a few days. It is necessary to get through as soon as possible as the team will be
picked by October 31st, and a probable match is lined up with the University of Virginia. Two more rounds will
be played to decide the four winners who will make the squad, and four will be played to decide the
winner. The four who win, combined with the lettermen, will make up the squad. No doubt a fast bunch will
be turned out. The new men are fighting hard and they will get a long trip in the spring, taking
on the leading colleges of the neighboring states. The men doped out as finalists are Wood Brown, McCutcheon, Hugh Wells,
Wi Carr, Crossland, and John Parks. These are probable winners, but at any time someone might step in and turn
over the dope bucket, so nothing is corked up yet and we will have to await developments. Tennis lettermen in
college who are not eligible for this tournament are Mac Bell, Harry Price, Tom Staley, and Jim Trotter.

Davidson Men Always Welcome

The Carolinas and Davidson 0, Richmond 0; first downs, Davidson 2, Richmond 1. The regular program was to have been
a debate, but the men got together, and finding the subject rather undebatable, decided to have an auto tour. Hodgin
used the blackboard and drew the route which was followed, naming the home town, Home Prayers. From here he took
his audience through Tenth Street, across River Joy, through Pleasure Park, and many other places, which all visited with enjoyment.
At each place of interest, scripture was read by different members, suitable for that place. A quartet composed of Hodgin,
Calhoun, Garrison, and Poole rendered a song to represent River Joy. After this unusual and interesting program, Forrest Franklin made
a short report on the work being done at the Mill Chapel. He explained how 11 of the Endeavorers could
aid in that work, but the biggest help would be to pray. This Sunday, W. W. Lynch, with some more,
whom he may deputize, will outline the work for this year, as planned by this state.

A Sapp-Davis pass netted seven yards, but the ball was on Richmond's 19-yard line. Vance came back after getting knocked
out and threw Richmond for a loss, though the invaders got a first down later. The ball was on Richmond's
31-yard line. After Baker and Boggs got a man for a five-yard loss, Richmond was penalized and punted to Davidson's
48-yard line. Sapp and Hendrix made a first, but Davidson got one on a penalty. Leggette made a fleet dash
for 20 yards, planting the ball on the 18-yard line. Two 15-yard penalties prevented scoring and Hunt punted over the
goal line. Davidson got the ball in midfield after Fick dropped a beautiful pass for 55 yards. Reams intercepted a
Davidson pass and Black intercepted a Richmond pass, but the ball went to Richmond for interference. The half ended with
the ball on Davidson's 44-yard line. Score, Davidson 0, Richmond 0; first downs, Davidson 3, Richmond 1.

WINGATE ELEVEN FRIDAY

The Davidson Wildkittens will play a game with the Wingate Junior College eleven at 3:30 o'clock tomorrow, Friday, afternoon on
Richardson field. The Wingate outfit is reported as having an exceptionally strong team, and a good fight is expected. One
of their backfield men averages fifty yards on punts, so it is expected that the visitors will play a punting
game. Coach Rawson expects to play the same team that defeated the Monroe outfit last week, with the probable exception
of the quarterback. Wilson, the regular quarter, injured a shoulder in the last contest and it is as yet uncertain
as to whether he will be able to perform. The Wildkittens came through the Monroe game in fine shape last
week, except for the above-mentioned injury to Wilson. The men brought out both the weak and strong points in the
team, and Coach is endeavoring to straighten out the kinks so that a tip-top team will be ready for the
opponents. The probable Davidson lineup will be as follows. At the time of going to press, the lineup of the
Wingate eleven could not be obtained:

Left end: Melton
Left tackle: Richards
Left guard: McNeill
Center: Laws
Right guard: Gray
Right tackle: Gibson
Right end: Quarterback
Left half: Grey, R.
Right half: Nesbit
Fullback: Sutton
