**Holding together through separation**

Charlie Summers

“What am I going to do? Dad walked out on us six months ago. Said he didn’t love Mom anymore.
Now he calls up and says he wants to take me Christmas shopping; just like old times. He even offered
me the use of his credit card. Well, he can’t buy my loyalty that easily. And on top of that,
he expects me to eat Christmas dinner with his new girlfriend and him! Not a chance.”

Divorce is hard on people. When things fall apart at home, all of life seems to wobble. When parents seek
separation or divorce, all relationships become more shaky. It is like having the North Star move, or the Rock of
Gibraltar sink a few feet. Divorce is not only hard for the two marriage partners, but for their children as
well. The age of the “children” does not matter — whether four or forty, the divorce of parents sows seeds
of self-doubt, distrust, and cynicism. On top of this, the holiday season can amplify the shock waves of the breakup.
The notion that all the neighbors are happily gathered with loved ones to celebrate (whether true or not) makes one’s
disharmony at home feel worse. The picture of friends sitting down to a Christmas feast with the whole family makes
the absence of a mother or father seem worse. Christmas carols, Norman Rockwell scenes, TV specials all proclaim “peace on
earth, goodwill to people.” These chords fall flat if the home front is involved in cold war.

In addition to these general feelings of loss and sadness, there may be specific issues that cause hard feelings. “Do
I buy a gift for Dad’s new girlfriend? Where do I eat Christmas dinner? Where will I stay? Do we
talk about... (the absent parent) over the holiday meals, or pretend he/she no longer exists?” Some children want to take
sides in their parents’ dispute; others want to be “neutrals” in the conflict. Holiday gatherings make each of these positions
difficult. Clearly, the holiday season can magnify the tensions of a family conflict. So what can one do if this
season is so difficult? Here are a few suggestions that may help.

Brace yourself. That seems like harsh advice. But it is better than the doctor saying, “This won’t hurt at all.”
Be realistic with yourself and your loved ones. If the separation or divorce is recent, this will probably be an
especially hard time for you. It will not always be so. In future years, acceptance and growth will bring new
ways to celebrate with those you love. Christmas will not always be a hard season to get through. But for
now, be realistic about what these days may bring.

Express yourself. Don’t harbor resentment over details that hurt you. Don’t let anger fester about events you do not like.
If you don’t want to spend Christmas Day in two different houses — say so. If you do not want
to trim the tree with your parent’s new “friend,” tell them that. These do not have to be non-negotiable demands.
After you have said your piece, you can more freely listen to the wishes of others. But you will feel
better for having expressed your feelings, no matter what the outcome. It may also be important for you to have
an outside confidant. If things get too tense at home, it will help to talk.

**Just Words**

Timothy Brown

Granted us by Erik Erikson, one has need to trust something or another. So if one invests his trust, say,
in the defense contractor, the CIA official, or on getting his tax return, and if he occasionally glances at a
newspaper, what does he face? A crisis. Trust vs. mistrust. Here are some tidbits disconcerting. (Dies a pity. Why? The
defense industry is run by ripoff artists who care little for their country — a thought packed to the gills
with wariness? Because the industry that has five major firms, untaxed from 1981 to 1984, has in 1985 nine out
of its 10 largest contractors under criminal investigation? Because the General Accounting Office tells us only 6 percent of the
Pentagon military contracts are fully competitive? Or because of $7,622 coffee makers and...$439 hammers, or tabs for liquor and parties
and pet care? (2) Get this. Larry Wu-tai Chin deceived CIA officials for 33 years, during which time he received
a career intelligence medal for superior service, and was even persuaded not to retire. An extension of service which offered
him more time. More time for what? More time to funnel almost every top-secret U.S. intelligence report on Asia to
the Chinese. Chin's work, requiring top secret clearance and access to code-word material, gave him access to the entire realm
of U.S. analytical intelligence on all of Asia outside the Soviet Union. Moreover, China got to read almost every document
ever pilfered from the Chinese government because he was one of the few CIA employees able to speak fluent Chinese.
This enabled the Chinese to plug intelligence leaks: For two decades — that's all.

(3) Man can expect life, death, and taxes: nothing was ever mentioned about tax returns. Weeks ago, 25,000 returns still
awaited processing, the search for the tax evader was becoming ever more weak (giving thus incentive) and it was rumored
that examiners had thrown away some returns out of carelessness brought on by fatigue and frustration. With someone who is
not directly involved. A close friend, a pastor, a neighbor — it should be someone you trust to listen without
condemnation and without a vested interest in the family outcome. This kind of emotional outlet can help you maintain your
own sense of balance when everyone else is going overboard. It can also help you gain a clearer sense of
exactly what you are feeling about the whole situation.

Celebrate. Even with the troubles at home, this is still the Christmas season. Where possible, enjoy yourself. Rest. Eat. Spend
time with friends. Worship. Go to the movies. Seek out those people and gatherings that help you feel good about
life. If you have times of relaxation and enjoyment, you will be better able to help your family. You will
certainly be of more help than if you are dragged out, anxious, and depressed. Where you have some control, use
it for good. Where you do not have control, don't fret over it. The more rested and buoyant you are,
the more you will be able to help your family through this hard time. Perhaps these suggestions will be of
some use. Remember, you are not alone in this. Others have been through it before. Let them help you. Then
you will be more able to sing and say, “Peace on earth, goodwill to people.” Summers is the college chaplain.

All of which is good news for the parent relying on his tax return to buy little Johnny that big,
red caboose he wanted for Christmas. All of this calls to memory the story of the Trojan horse. The Greeks
gave the horse to the Trojans, gained entry thereby, and then destroyed all of Troy. Which led the Trojans to
forever remember: Beware of Greeks bearing gifts. Which causes me to forever wonder: Can trust, once shattered, ever be restored?

Against self-righteousness
Matt Mathews

Driving back to Davidson early one Sunday morning, some friends and I fell to talking about ignorance and the narrow-mindedness
of some people. We also theorized that this narrow-mindedness frequently arises from people brought up in small, close-knit communities. This
problem of simplicity within the small community can be resolved by an increased level of tolerance and understanding by its
citizens toward new ideas. These communities, due to their intimacy, are naturally slow to change. There is nothing wrong with
this. However, when the community becomes stagnant and numbed by its sense of tradition, then these values should be questioned.
Frequently, people brought up in such a restricted environment end up with a childish understanding of the world. Instead of
seeking to understand something new, like a child, they immediately reject it as not “right.” This type of person is
not only lacking a type of world view but is also potentially dangerous. So are all small communities detrimental? Absolutely
not! The point is that everyone should not be so quick to judge something just because they don't understand it.
Nothing is worse, or more dangerous, than a person who is so self-righteous that he refuses to accept anything new.
