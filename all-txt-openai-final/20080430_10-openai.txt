Memento from Page 9

The reality of what occurs. The audience receives only an extremely warped version of the story, much of it told in recollections offered by a memory-defective protagonist who points out that “memories can be distorted. They are just an interpretation, they’re not a record, and they’re irrelevant if you have the facts.”

Just like Leonard, we struggle to discern not only what is actually happening but also who to trust — our hero included. In a word, the film is confusing. And yes, of course, the chaos can be passed off as intentionally didactic, but to what end? Normally didacticism uses the appreciation of a character’s state as a means of drawing out empathy, but why sympathize with Leonard and his intentional renegades against the innocent?

Unless Nolan harbors a secret agenda to join the fight against short-term memory loss, this disarray of a movie may be nothing more than symptomatic of a bad case of self-importance, a simple display of artsyness for artsyness’ sake. Perhaps a bit of artsy freshness should be awarded. However, if offering no moral judgment, the film should at least provide enjoyment, and so taxing and infuriating a process can hardly be classified as such.

The supporting cast is limited and forgettable, the setting lacks variation of anything but a seedy motel in a seedy town with the better served to pick a different theater at random, upon his return rather than attempt to get back into the plot. Admittedly, the big reveal at the film’s end does a pretty effective job of tying together all the bits and pieces of the film in a (you guessed it) shocking way, but the denouement seems an afterthought. The protagonist turns out to lack any morals and continues to kill at random just to give his life purpose, and it is difficult to gauge the level to which one can assess the morality of someone who in 20 minutes will forget he’s ever done wrong.

The morality question becomes further muddied by our limited opportunity to grasp the black and white to color. With the shaking of a Polaroid—proves detrimental to the film and could do little to abate the nausea-inducing mental image of Nolan grinning like a fool. At last, feel ashamed that we were goaded into believing the flashy new tricks that
