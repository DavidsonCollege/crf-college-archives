THE DAVIDSONIAN.

Post Office Box 218, Davidson, North Carolina 28036

Circa 1860, Davidson College commissioned J.W. Orr, a New York engraver, to make a woodcut of the first Chambers building.
Although Orr's original has been lost, a few pieces of stationery on which the woodcut adorned the letterhead have been
preserved. This facsimile of the Orr letterhead was made from a letter written by J.M. Potts on 1 August 1863.
Louis Orr, a descendant of J.W. Orr, made the contemporary series of etchings of North Carolina scenes that hang on
the main floor of the E.H. Little Library.
