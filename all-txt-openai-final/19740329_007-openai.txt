**Seven Irate Anderson Reinterprets... Super Vision Bleached Canterbury**

To The Editor:

A petition to be circulated this week deals with the abolition of the Davidson College Laundry. Its sponsor, Steve Canterbury,
has urged the student body to seek it out and sign it as part of a crusade against the social
evil inherent in a college-owned laundry. “Discrimination and Illegality” seems to be the slogan of the campaign.

The theoretical base for this action is well-articulated. Mr. Canterbury does not like paying the compulsory laundry fee which must
be collected for the laundry to stay in business. He maintains, rightly so, that he could do his own laundry
at a greatly diminished cost. He clamors for the right to have an option. His motivation is selfish—he would like
to save his money. With these concerns I most assuredly sympathize.

So the answer to the dilemma is a simple one. Justice must prevail—the same compulsory laundry fee for all or
else no laundry at all. The first option is impractical so the second is all that is left—and we have
a solution! There is where the argument leads, cut and dry except for one damning consideration.

The underlying assumption of this line of reasoning is the belief that a majority of the student body would like
to save money by doing their own laundry. The convenience of the laundry will be thrown to the wind, and
each student will revel in the prospect of weekly laundry duty. Suppose though, that a Davidson student should prefer someone
else washing his clothes. Simple, says Mr. Canterbury. Steve is ready to do it or have some other student do
it for the cost difference that each student would save.

Yet the only way a student would save is by hiring out his fellow students for cheaper wages than the
compulsory laundry fee now provides for. Take the college out of the laundry business, but exploit your fellow student. This
is the kind of enterprising capitalism that produced the likes of Karl Marx.

Convenience without unqualified equality, then, is the basis of the present laundry arrangement. Abolition of the laundry would produce inconvenience
and a theoretical equality, plus savings for a few. The thrust of my argument is that the majority of students
would prefer the present arrangement. The petition drive will demonstrate the student opinion. Mr. Canterbury and I both put our
faith in majority rule. The anti-laundry crusader obviously has an agreement with higher-ups that the majority decision will prevail if
his petition secures enough signatures. He feels that the majority of students will shun the convenience of the laundry and
take to the washboards. I respectfully disagree.

Some of you will recognize the allusions—to Psalm 34, for example, and to one of Wordsworth's sonnets; and perhaps the
allusion in the closing lines, to Eden. I may need to remind some of you that the delights of Eden
are behind us; we are post-Edenic readers; we are not reading about how we should have acted, or should act,
in Eden. The poem is about our griefs, our world. We need to know our world, to be changed by
experiencing it deeply. How otherwise can we see that our dominion requires us to exercise supervision, what is called stewardship.
We have ignored it for centuries.

**Goodman: Hearst Abduction Reveals Bungled Ransom Requests**

Patricia Hearst was kidnapped eight weeks ago. We have heard many reports in those 8 weeks and seen a lot
of things that we thought we never would see. It appears that crimes have become increasingly political over the past
decade. Originally, a plane would be hijacked for a free ride to Cuba or a ransom.of $100,000. Hijackings soon became
political weapons. Nations would do amazing things to ensure the safe return of their hijacked citizens. They would release other
criminals or pay exorbitant amounts of money. Kidnapping, one of the oldest crimes, has been quick to come to the
fore as a political weapon. Let us consider briefly what we have seen with respect to the Hearst kidnapping since
Patricia Hearst was abducted on Feb. 4. Randolph Hearst soon found that his daughter had been taken hostage in a
political maneuver. He immediately offered to do anything for her return. The Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA), Patricia Hearst's abductors, let
him know exactly what they wanted. Food for the poor. As it turned out, they wanted a lot of food
for the poor. The food began to be distributed and his crying, pathetic wife begged for the return of their
precious daughter. But the SLA wanted more food and the freedom of two of their comrades. Eight weeks after the
abduction, I am disgusted by the entire affair. I am not disgusted because the SLA kidnapped Patricia Hearst and forced
her father to give food to the poor. I find that a noble action, perhaps the only noble action of
the entire affair. I am disgusted by the necessity of that act to ensure food for the needy, the incredible
naivete of the SLA, the attitude of Patricia’s parents, and the general attitude of our society. That’s a lot to
be disgusted with and I hope to give my reasons presently. What if Patricia Hearst’s death is caused either directly
or indirectly by her abduction? What if 100 people live who might have died of starvation? Either way, we see
a tragedy. Patricia’s tragic flaw is her ancestry as is that of all the poor. Does Patricia Hearst have any
more right to live than a starving San Francisco Mexican? Do you have any more right to live than a
hungry Davidson Black? Why do the rich need to keep getting richer? They can never spend all their money on
themselves anyway. Why can't the Kennedys start a free food plan in Boston before little Teddy, Jr. is kidnapped? These
questions could well have been asked by the SLA. Yet the SLA and most other groups who commit a crime
with a political motive are terribly naive. It is certainly good that the poor people of San Francisco are getting
free food, but sooner or later, Patricia will either have to be returned or killed. And what has their action
accomplished? They have succeeded in filling the bellies of some among the ‘great silent majority’, and most everyone more harm
than good. They are a group of stupid revolutionaries (who are not to be confused with intelligent revolutionaries).

balanced on his stomach every afternoon and watched ‘‘The Secret Life of Walt and Wife.” All in all, it could
have been a good life: decent food delivered right to your bed by a hand-maiden in white and large dosages
of rest free by the doctor. J.E. seemed to be having only one problem. He was lonely. Because he was
feeling bad, he started feeling isolated; and because he was he started longer feels estranged from the living, since he
now can have two whole visitors at a clip. And the end to all this: drink plenty of liquids and
get lots of rest! In other words, stay well. Then you'll never have to worry about the infirmary and its
politics.
