#### Absurd & Iconoclastic ‘Team America’ a Self-Indulgent Treat

I still believe that the greatest moment in Oscar history came when the Academy nominated “Blame Canada,” the perverse flag-waving anthem from 1999’s “South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut,” for Best Original Song. It marked one of the few times in cinema history that the stodgy Academy recognized the brilliance of a truly ballsy, subversive film. I remember that moment because it will never happen again. Once it gets a load of “Team America: World Police,” the unabashedly offensive, pseudopatriotic follow-up to that crazed animated classic, Hollywood will renounce any of its previous efforts to honor creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. The “screw-everyone” attitude of these two filmmakers simply crushes too many notions of American honor—innocence and morality most prominent among them—to merit a prestigious American award.

**LENGTH:** 107 MINUTES  
**RATING:** R

This is a shame because “Team America” certainly merits some kind of award. Undoubtedly one of the funniest movies of the year, TA crosses the line on countless current event issues which most Americans only have the guts to discuss with great caution. It is the rare post-September 11 comedy that encourages us not only to laugh at other people but to also laugh at ourselves. And it does it all with puppets.

Stylistically speaking, “Team America” plays like a sublime episode of “South Park.” Parker and Stone still enjoy attacking random celebrities, exploiting bathroom humor, and composing irreverent odes to whimsical causes. Visually, however, the movie signifies an odd sort of accomplishment. The puppet work wants desperately to be terrible, but Parker and Stone do “terrible” so well that the film actually displays some fascinating visuals. The colorfully corny design perfectly accompanies the movie’s intentionally simplistic universe, creating a landscape that is just as much fun to watch as it is to hear.

In short, “Team America” tells the story of American supremacy. Basically, whenever the world gets in trouble, we kick some ass and make everyone happy again. However, Team America—a world police force behind covert, shoot-em-up diplomacy—has a huge problem on their hands. Weapons of Mass Destruction are on the loose. The terrorists are plotting an attack. And the always giddy Kim Jong Il of North Korea has something dastardly up his sleeve. To kill the terrorists, TA needs a way to get on the inside. To do so, they recruit Gary Johnston, recorded history’s finest actor and the recent star of the hit AIDS musical “Lease.” With his outstanding, engrossing performance skills, Gary is TA’s only hope of planting a spy within the terrorists’ massive scheme.

Gary attacks a North Vietnamese base. Encouraging him to “act fast,” TA sends Gary on his way, hoping that the wonders of the Stanislavski method will save the world from destruction. Sadly, things don’t work out so easily. Along the way, TA fights dissension both inside and outside its ranks. Love triangles, quadrilaterals, and pentagons permeate TA’s not-so-secret Mt. Rushmore lair, resulting in some of the most graphic sex you can find this side of NC-17. Elsewhere, TA encounters an unexpected enemy in Hollywood’s Film Actors Guild (put the first letters together to get the joke), whose respected members, including Alec Baldwin, Matt Damon, and Michael Moore, are in cahoots with Kim Jong Il.

Make no mistake: “Team America” is definitely not a movie to see with Grandma. It is obscene, rude, absurd, and self-indulgent. Still, behind the ludicrousness of the film’s content, Parker and Stone execute a thoroughly impressive satire. The winning soundtrack, which includes songs ridiculing the incompetence of “Pearl Harbor” and the sentimentality of country music, shows that the filmmakers never settle for a focused narrative. Their trademark skill lies in their ability to slander everything about everybody in a mere 110-minute running time.

One icon is mysteriously absent from proceedings. While “Team America” pokes clear fun at right-wing policy and left-wing whining, President Bush does not even receive a mention throughout the entire film. This is further proof of the hidden wisdom running beneath Parker and Stone’s brazen commentary. Why attack this year’s most obvious target while there are so many other celebrities and figureheads waiting for a good roast?

### America’s General Opinion: A Continuum of Delicious Ambiguity
By Sarah Robinson  
Arts & Living Editor

“Dear George” started as a news ad from Marcus Woollen, requesting open letters to the President. The ad ran from Memorial Day to Labor Day, and Woollen received approximately 1500 responses from around the country—Massachusetts to North Dakota, California to Texas.From these letters, Woollen took excerpts and created a play. The product, “Dear George,” examines the responses of Americans to President George W. Bush. As the play states, “a letter reveals more about its author than its recipient.” This weekend, as Election Day approaches, there will be two performances. Representing a wide range of political views, “Dear George” focuses on the concerns of the regular American towards the current administration, rather than towards the coming election. The opinions in the letters are clear, and, in the production, Woollen arranged them so that the letters reflect and react to other opinions. For example, at one point, letters are read interchangeably by two mothers of servicemen, both with a very different judgment of the legitimacy of the current presidency.

During the past summer, the production came to theater major Ali Anderson ‘05, when 1500 letters were submitted to the theater project. Her advisor, Professor Ann-Marie Costa, brought it to her attention. Originally planning to do a strictly academic thesis, Anderson chose to do a theater project as part of her honors research. Ultimately, she will investigate how and why an audience chooses to go to a particular show. She cited the frequent clashes between government and theater and stated “‘Dear George’ looked really intriguing as an intersection of politics and theater in a non-confrontational manner.”

Concerning the balance of the letters, both Democrats and Republicans took part in the letters, although criticisms also came from Bush supporters. Anderson met with Young Democrats and College Republicans Tuesday morning to discuss the play. Topics of the letters include foreign policy, religion, economy, environment, and homosexuality. Of the 1500 responses, 1200 requested that their letters be sent to the President. Woollen sent a letter requesting that President Bush send a letter to the American people. The president did not send a reply.

Anderson, as director and producer, acquired funds from the Nick Dancik Fund, created for student performers in the Duke Family Performance Hall in memory of Dancik ‘01, and will also fund the production from ticket sales. Her previous directing experience is from the classroom, Directing I, and from serving as stage manager in several Theater Department productions. As well, she worked as an intern this past summer at the Blowing Rock Stage Company, an equity playhouse located in Western North Carolina.

In producing the show, the actors, as well as Anderson, have learned about the opinions of regular Americans. To bring life to characterizations, the actors are researching the dialects from around America to accurately portray the many character types they present. David Kerns ‘08 found that the show demonstrated the “unbelievably wide opinions in the U.S.” Concerning how to portray each character, Lauren Taft ‘05 stated, “It is a constant challenge to avoid putting your own bias in the letters. Sometimes I don’t even realize I’m doing it; making someone’s claim seem more ridiculous than it actually is intended to be played. I am learning to handle the difficulty of portraying an opinion that’s not my own and convincing the audience that I really have adopted that character’s beliefs.”

For Anderson, her production of “Dear George” begins her thesis research. She will attend two other productions in the Charlotte area to observe audience reactions and the treatment of a political topic by producers. Meeting one-on-one with the actors three times since a general read-through on October 5, Anderson has learned how to use different styles to get certain reactions from actors, as well as learning “to respect and value everyone’s opinions more than before.”

While the actors are unsure of how the play will be accepted on campus, they hope that it will give some insight into the vast diversity of opinion in the country regarding Bush’s presidency. By attending the show, Anderson “hopes that the audience will be involved to a point that they react along with the letters. I hope there is a connection between the actors and the viewers.” She included thoughts of people clapping when agreeing, or booing when disagreeing with the letters. Either way, the project is not aimed at attacking one political position over another.

“Dear George” will run Oct. 30 and 31 at 8 p.m. in the Duke Family Performance Hall. Tickets are $3 for students and $5 for faculty. A reception and discussion with the Young Democrats and College Republicans will follow each performance.
