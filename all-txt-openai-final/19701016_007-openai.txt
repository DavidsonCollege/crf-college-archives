**Transfers Make Palladins 1**

A converted flanker and four junior college transfers have changed Furman University from the league's weak sister into a conference
contender.

**Parachute Show Will Open Game**

A parachute team from Fort Bragg, promising to be as accurate as Davidson quarterback Mark Thompson's passes, will perform prior
to the Davidson-Furman football game at Richardson Stadium Saturday afternoon.

The parachute jumps—four are scheduled—will begin about 10 minutes prior to the beginning of the football game. The jumps will
be made by four members of the Sports Club of Fort Bragg.

There will be four jumps. In the first jump, the parachutist will open his main chute, release it, and then
continue the jump with his reserve parachute.

The second and third jumpers will begin with free falls, using smoke, and will open their chutes at about 3,000
feet. They will leave their airplane at 10,000 feet. The jumper will deliver a football to one of the game
captains at the 50-yard line just prior to kickoff.

Barring unfavorable wind conditions, all of the jumpers should come within 10 yards of their targets.

**Wildkittens Face Evans**

Today marked the debut of the 1970 freshman football team under the guidance of Coach Gene McEver.

The Wildkittens tackled Evans Junior College from nearby Concord on the practice field beyond the soccer field.

“This could be the best group in the three years I've been working with the freshmen,” McEver speculated. Although the
starting lineups for today’s game were not definite, McEver mentioned several individuals who should be standouts during the season.

Halfback John Webel was expected to carry most of the rushing load along with Alton McCallum and Steve Keller. Quarterbacks
Mike Allport and Eddie Petitt were included in the blue-chip group, as were linemen Jim Purcell and Paul Brown.

Both Brown and the versatile Petitt have been troubled by injuries but McEver expects them in action soon.

Commenting on today’s game, McEver noted that Evans gave last year's freshman team its stiffest competition. “I realize there is
a lot of change in players at a junior college, but I'm expecting a tough game from them,” he concluded.

**The Purple Palladins**

The Purple Palladins will enter Richardson Stadium tomorrow fresh from an upset over Richmond and with memories of last year's
77-14 loss to the Wildcats fresh in their minds. Kick-off for tomorrow's game is at 1:30 PM.

The four JC transfers have bolstered Coach Bob King's hope for a title. One is the quarterback, Jim Deleo, who
found his way to Furman from Wesley Junior College.

Deleo forced record-setting quarterback Cleve Hightower to the bench in fall drills. The junior from Long Island, N.Y. has completed
22 of 50 passes for 244 yards. He's an adequate runner, picking up 154 yards on 9 carries.

Two linemen picked up from Chowan Junior College have aided the Palladins in improving over last year’s 1-8 record. The
pair are Jim Fair and Peyton Barber. Fair is a 220-pound defensive tackle while Barber plays offensive tackle. A fourth
JC transfer, Bernie Tosthoker, is a substitute defensive back.

Deleo operates the pro set offense, relying on Carroll for most of the ball carrying. Steve Crislip runs from halfback
and is currently averaging 4.8 yards a carry.

Byron Trotter is Deleo’s favorite receiver. The 6'0", 184-pound senior has caught 15 passes for 145 yards. Carroll and Phillip
Howle are other prime targets Deleo often looks for.

The Purple Palladins favor a 6-2-2-1 defense with the defensive ends dropping off for pass coverage.

The rushing defense is one of the best in the conference. In the 23-9 upset over Richmond, the Palladins held
the Spiders to minus 35 yards in the first half.

“The victory over Richmond is a big one in some ways,” commented Coach King. “It could have a great effect
on the remainder of our season, especially the conference games.”

Furman began to jell after their 42-34 win over Carson-Newman. Prior to the CN game, the Palladins had lost to
VMI and Wofford, winning only against Presbyterian College.

Coach King had nothing but praise for Davidson: “This is an important game for us. Davidson is big and strong,
possessing an excellent passing game.”

“Year in and year out they have the best-conceived passing attack we've seen.”
