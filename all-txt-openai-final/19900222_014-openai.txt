**Winthrop**

By BRUCE BALESTIER

Davidson hoped to avenge an early season 51-49 loss to Winthrop when the ‘Cats traveled to Rock Hill, S.C. to
meet the Eagles on February 15. And for most of the evening, it looked as if they would do just
that. The teams fought to a 31-31 deadlock at the half, but, in the late stages of the second stanza,
the Wildcats began to pull away. The visiting ‘Cats held a five-point lead with under seven minutes remaining but, as
has happened before, were unable to maintain it. A three-point field goal by Winthrop’s Andy McKoy tied the contest at
65 with 25 seconds to play. And yet things still looked good for the ‘Cats when Darry Strickland was fouled
while rebounding a Mo Gray jumpshot with :04 left. Despite two Winthrop timeouts to attempt to “ice” him, the junior
coolly converted both free throws for a 67-65 Davidson lead. Winthrop then passed the ball to midcourt and called timeout
with 3 seconds left on the clock. After the timeout, Winthrop’s Sean Smith, shadowed by the imposing presence of Detlef
Musch, passed to Shaun Wise, whose prayer from near 25 feet gave the Eagles a 68-67 triumph.

In the defeat, the Wildcats wasted one of their finest all-around performances of the season. Davidson outrebounded Winthrop 29 to
25 and committed 11 turnovers to their opponent’s 14. The ‘Cats even came through with a rare 50 percent shooting
night from the floor. Unfortunately, they could do no better from the free throw stripe; their 11 of 22 shooting
there likely cost them the victory. The Wildcat attack was paced by Detlef Musch, who overcame extensive foul trouble to
score 14 points, and by Mo Gray, who contributed 13 points.

So the ‘Cats were still pursuing their first road win of the year when they journeyed to Miami of Ohio
Monday night. The Redskins, however, quickly informed them to look elsewhere. Davidson assumed a scant 12-9 lead in the opening
minutes, but were victimized by a subsequent 13-0 run. The ‘Skins rode the crest of that scoring wave to a
35-26 lead at the half. Miami then broke the contest wide open with a 20-7 spree early in the second
half, and cruised to an 89-57 win. More than anything, the Wildcats fell prey to the unbelievably hot shooting of
their opponents. The Redskins shot a blistering 67 percent from the field during the game, including 12 of 20 from
three-point range. Alan Hunter and Mo Gray led the Davidson cause with 15 and ten points, respectively.

The ‘Cats will attempt to terminate their seven-game losing skid TONIGHT at Belk Arena against the Citadel (7:30 pm start)
and Saturday night meet Central Florida in Orlando, Florida.

**Baseball**

Over the past week, the Wildcat baseball team managed to get in four of their scheduled five games. Friday’s game
against Pfeiffer was postponed due to rain and no makeup date has yet been announced. On Saturday, the Wildcats took
two from the Radford Highlanders, winning the first game 5-1 and the second 1-0. Greg Wilcox (2-0) pitched the opener
for his second start of the season and began much as he did on the 11th against UNC Asheville, as
he walked the leadoff hitter. However, he was once again able to settle down as he registered a complete game,
10-strikeout performance.

The Wildcats struck first in the bottom half of the second inning. An error on the shortstop allowed 1B Joe
Azzolino to reach safely. He was promptly moved to third as DH Ralph Isernia unleashed on an 0-1 fastball, driving
it to the gap in right center. A fielder’s choice by 3B Mike Liebdzinski scored Azzolino. In the fourth, Radford’s
starting pitcher gave up four consecutive singles to RF Pete Hughes, Azzolino, Isernia, and Liebdzinski and the Wildcats led 2-0.
Freshman catcher Mac Chapman followed by hitting into a 4-6-3 double play which scored Azzolino. The ‘Cats picked up two
more runs in the fourth on a two-out double to left field by 2B Mikio Aoki and a 365-foot home
run by Hughes over the left-center field fence. The Highlanders were able to score one run in the seventh but
never seriously threatened the Wildcats.

In the second game, Dave Williams (2-0) came on to pitch his second consecutive 1-0 shutout. The lone run of
the ballgame was scored when Isernia hit into a fielder’s choice to score Hughes from third. Hughes had opened the
fourth with a single and had been moved to third on a perfect hit and run between the first and
second baseman by Azzolino.Sunday, the Wildcats lost their first ballgame of the year to these same Radford Highlanders, 9-1. Defense,
or rather the lack of it, played a big part in the loss, as the 'Cats had three errors in
the first three innings, two occurring on the same play, making the first three Radford runs unearned. Down 3-0 in
the fifth, Joe Azzolino crushed a 2-0 fastball over the trees beyond the .355 sign in left-center. The Highlanders scraped
for another run in the sixth, but the floodgates really opened in the top of the ninth as relief pitcher
Brad Wanzenberg was charged with five runs. The Wildcats went quietly in their half of the ninth, and Derek Twombly
(0-1) took the loss.

On Tuesday, the Wildcats traveled to N.C. State where their offense (averaging only 2.5 runs per game) finally woke up.
Unfortunately, it was after the Wolfpack had jumped to a 7-2 lead on the strength of two three-run homers off
starter Jim Stanfill (0-1). Davidson scored six runs in the fifth through eighth innings, but two runs by N.C. State
in the sixth provided the margin of victory. 3B/Pitcher Mike Liebdzinski looked strong in the last three innings, but the
final tally was N.C. State 9, Davidson 8.

In good health
By MARK D. PUCKETT

The following tune is a tune which is about exercise. It is called:

A TUNE ABOUT EXERCISE
(To the tune of “Itsy-Bitsy Spider” or “This Land is Your Land” or “I Got Me a Big Ugly Truck”)

The Davidson student went running
Around the large campus
Out came the heavy breathing
And wore the student out
Out came the heart attack and the aneurysm
And killed the student dead
And the Davidson student never went running again.

Often, and sometimes more than often, while I sit and stare at the SGA Minutes on the bathroom stall door,
I can’t help but realize that I really don’t give a darn about the SGA ever since I lost that
stupid freshman senator race. Then, I stop reading because I am full of vexation about a certain issue that vexes
me—fair weather exercisers.

The Dictionary of a Bunch of Exercise Terms defines a fair weather exerciser as:
1) anyone who exercises when the weather is fair; and
2) a weekend warrior exerciser, i.e., a person who doesn’t exercise regularly, not even occasionally, not even frequently, not even
some of the time; BUT, when the weather turns fruity and special, the student exercises a whole bunch at once
in hopes that his/her aerobic burn will last, say, a semester.

Such a pattern of irregular exercise shocks the body. The body replies with, “Stop shocking me. What'd I do to
you?” and the rest is just what you might imagine: real bad. Take, for example, the shriveled old man who
can’t do a doggone thing because none of his body parts work. One day, he says to himself, “I am
darn tired of sitting on my bony butt all day drinking prune juice. Therefore, I think I will chop some
wood.” On the first chop, all of his bones break and he crumbles into dust. As he crumbles, he creakily
mutters something about exercising regularly. The following is what he creakily mutters: “Les bones est beaucoup broken.” Because this man
was Spanish, I couldn’t understand him completely, but I recognized some of what he said just by context:

1) If you feel out of breath, dizzy, or faint at any point during your workout, you need to either
warm down or stop working out altogether. Don’t confuse this feeling with the euphoria you get upon reaching an aerobic
peak.
2) If your cheeks turn red and stay that way for a while; if you experience nausea; if your pulse
is rapid and your skin cold; if you collapse, chances are you have a form of heat exhaustion and you
need to lighten your workout load.

“Interval training can trim minutes off your best time, while it improves your cardiovascular health,” says Elizabeth Kaufmann in the
December 1989 issue of American Health. This week, a running plan:
1) warm up for 5 to 10 minutes, at 60 percent of max. heart rate (fairly light)
2) sprint 45 or 90 seconds at 85 to 90 percent (very hard)
3) jog for 90 to 180 seconds; let heart rate drop to 70 percent
4) do four to six reps
5) take a break; walk until heart rate drops to 60 percent
6) do four to six more reps
7) cool down for 5 to 10 minutes, at 60 percent or lower.
