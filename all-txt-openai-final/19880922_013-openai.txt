This week: Shaping Up the Stomach
By MARK PUCKETT

I have been working my stomach muscles every day for over two years. I began by doing 50 situps a
day. I moved up to 500 a day after a couple of months. One day I did a thousand situps
without rest. Eventually, I figured a less time-consuming way to work my abdominal and oblique muscles—crunches and leg raises. Now,
my workout takes under eight minutes and it works the muscles much harder. I have read in Legendary Abs that
you should not do situps. They can have an ill effect on the psoas muscle which assists in bending the
thigh or the lumbar portion of the trunk on the pelvis. Situps take too much time and don’t give half
the burn of crunches and leg raises.

The following workout is partly mine, partly Mark Findlay’s in Joe Weider’s September 1988 Issue of Men's Fitness, and partly
the author’s of Legendary Abs. It works.

**Leg Raise:** Raise your legs together as high as you can. Crunch tightly and lower them making sure not to
touch the ground with your heels. BE SURE TO USE ONLY YOUR ABDOMINALS. Do not use the muscles in your
legs. Concentrate on using your stomach. Place your hands (palms down) by your sides or under your buttocks.

**Crunch:** With knees bent and hands clasped lightly behind your head, flex up with your stomach. BE SURE TO USE
ONLY YOUR ABDOMINALS. Only your shoulders and head should come off the ground.

**Twists:** Rest an unweighted bar behind your neck on the back of your shoulders. Twist in both directions using your
obliques and serratus (side muscles).

These are the basic stomach exercises. Do the following repetitions if you are beginning:
- 10 Leg Raises (Rest 10 Seconds)
- 10 Leg Raises
- 15 Crunches
- 100 Twists

If you have been doing abdominal work for some time I recommend that you increase the repetitions and add the
following exercises:

**U-Seat Crunch:** As you do a crunch bring your knees up to meet your elbows. BE SURE TO USE ONLY
YOUR ABDOMINALS.

**Reverse Situp:** Lying on your back. Arms by your sides. Knees bent. Feet flat. Use your abs to raise your
hips and buttocks off the floor. BE SURE TO USE ONLY YOUR ABDOMINALS.

**Twisting Crunch:** Raise your legs. Keep them straight up. Do twisting crunches to the left and right. Findlay says that
this exercise only requires a small range of motion.

**Hanging Leg Raise:** These are leg raises hanging from a chinup bar. Hanging from the bar use your abs to
raise your straight legs. BE SURE TO USE ONLY YOUR ABDOMINALS.

**Side Crunch:** I can’t explain this one as well as Findlay. He says, “your knees should be bent as you
lie on your side, most of your weight supported by your buttocks. With one hand behind your head and the
other across your stomach, use your abs and obliques (side muscles) to raise your upper torso. Repeat on both sides.”

The following workout is the one I do every day:
- 25 Hanging Leg Raises (Rest 10 Seconds)
- 25 Lying Leg Raises (no rest)
- 30 Crunches (no rest)
- 25 U-Seat Crunches (no rest)
- 20 Twisting Crunches (no rest)
- 25 Reverse Situps (no rest)
- 40 Side Crunches on each side (no rest in between)
- 100 Twists (optional)

You may modify the repetitions, but I recommend this order. Beginners—10 to 15 repetitions. Intermediates—15 to 20 repetitions. Advanced—20 to
30 repetitions. If you don’t feel comfortable doing hanging leg raises, substitute another set of lying leg raises. Do not
feel that you have to do every exercise at first. Start slowly and gradually increase repetitions and add exercises. Remember
to concentrate on your midsection throughout the workout. Feel your stomach muscles burning. As Findlay...Here is the cleaned OCR text,

concludes in his article, “Visualize them becoming tighter, harder, and stronger, and keep that goal in mind. A ripped midsection
is the epitome of physical fitness.” If you think you are having trouble with technique, write to “In Good Health”

FOOTBALL, from page 11

High school basketball is not known to be a high school football power. South Carolina has good high school football,
but Davidson has not been successful in recruiting there, as there is only one South Carolinian on this year’s roster.
Is there any hope for Davidson in the Colonial League? Yes, there is. The team is much improved over last
year’s squad and has only 5 seniors on the squad. However, in order to continue this improvement, the coaches are
going to have to do an excellent job of recruiting, and the players are going to have to dedicate themselves
to making Davidson football competitive.

Soccer Team Stuns South Carolina

The Cats played their best game of the season so far as they handed U.S.C. a 1-0 loss yesterday. Davidson
(3-5-1) and the Gamecocks played to a 0-0 halftime score, and the game remained a tie until the 9:57 mark
when Curtis Ott scored on a direct kick from 35 yards out. Carolina put tremendous pressure on the Cats in
the closing moments but was denied a goal on superlative plays from Frank Bricio and Jim Walker.

Both of these players saved balls which were right on the goal line. Doug Long made his Davidson debut a
memorable one in recording the shutout. The game was an especially big one for the Cats, who were coming off
losses to The College of Charleston (3-0) and South Alabama (5-2) in the Lake Norman.

Golf Team Off To Impressive Start

On Wednesday of last week, the team traveled to Salisbury to participate in the Catawba Invitational. Davidson came in first
out of five teams with a four-man total of 309. Craig Carlock led the team and earned medalist honors with
a 75. Other scores were Mike Maggart-76, Gates Grainger-77, and Scott Prince-81. This weekend the team will be playing in
the Georgetown Invitational. In a related story, Tim Tallent resigned last week as coach of the team. A search is
currently underway to find a replacement.

This week’s picks By PHIL PRESCOTT

Oklahoma at Southern Cal: Oklahoma is in a rebuilding, more like reloading, year after losing five All-American starters from last
year’s team. The only team Oklahoma has lost to in the last 3 years has been Miami. Look for U.S.C.
to be the next team to beat them. Oklahoma has trouble beating passing teams, especially teams that can run and
pass, and U.S.C. poses this problem. Rodney Peete, quarterback of U.S.C., is the key; his running ability will negate any
Oklahoma blitz. Prediction...U.S.C. 23-17.

Georgia at South Carolina: The game of the week down South. Both teams have explosive offenses. Todd Ellis at quarterback
and Harold Greene at running back form the passing and running duo for South Carolina. Georgia counters with a triumvirate
of great running backs: Tim Worley, Keith Henderson, and Rodney Hampton. Georgia’s depth at running back should wear down the
South Carolina defense in the fourth quarter. Prediction...Georgia 35-31.

West Virginia at Pittsburgh: A traditional big game up East and both teams have their best squads.
