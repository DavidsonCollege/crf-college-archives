The Davidson Wildcat basketball team made a strong showing against a highly touted N.C. State team, coming away with a 10-point loss. The Wildcat guards Chris Dodds and John Gerdy supplied most of the fireworks, scoring 66 of the team’s 96 points. Dodds had 35 and Gerdy scored 31. The only other player to score in double figures was Pat Hickert, who scored 10 points. Hickert also hauled in the game-high 12 rebounds.

State led most of the way and near the end of the first half threatened to pull away as they mounted an 18-point lead. But a tight Wildcat defense and the shooting of Dodds and Gerdy pulled the Wildcats to within three with three minutes remaining in the half.

Dodds explained the Cats' resurgence, “We just had to speed it up out of desperation.” State regained its composure, however, and led by nine at the half. The Cats continued playing a strong game in the second half and pulled to within two at one point. But State, with the good outside shooting, prevented Davidson from taking the lead and opened up a 12-point lead of their own. At this point late in the game, the Pack resorted to a spread offense. Although Davidson applied strong pressure, they were unable to narrow the margin significantly.

Coach Dave Pritchett was obviously pleased with the team’s performance. After the game, Pritchett complimented his players, “After the first ten minutes you beat State.” In an interview, he added, “We’re young. I’ve got to be proud of the way my people played.”

Forward Rod Owens was also pleased with the team’s showing. “We played very strong the last 30 minutes. This was the first real test we've had against a top team. Now we see what we've got to do.”

The players responded well to the home court enthusiasm. Hickert remarked, “This week was the first time since I’ve been here that I’ve seen the students really support us. Believe it or not, it really makes a difference. Charlotte Coliseum was our home court tonight. If the crowd comes to the game determined that Davidson is going to win, it makes it awful tough on the other team.” Gerdy added, “I hope the people stay enthusiastic, because we're going to improve.”

Clubbers close fall season
By KEVIN ROBBINS

The Fall of 1977 witnessed the rise of some new sports and fine performances as well as many mundane moments as our Club Sports Autumn wrap-up ties together all those loose ends and unanswered questions that have kept you dangling.

Firstly, the new sport. The upstart Water Polo Club allowed an opening season loss to whet their whistle for some heroic exploits as they plunged back into action to splash to victory in a rematch with that aforementioned Appalachian State Club team. The Wildcat Wet Ones look strong for the future and may take on those glutton-for-punishment Mountaineers in a winner-take-all (of what?) in the spring.

Davidson’s finest football club made it all the way to the final four in the state playoffs before bowing to North Carolina 10-8 on their field. The Cat Clubbers ended the regular season at 5-3. While being outnumbered approximately 3-1 in every game, they continually stripped opponents of virtually everything with their tenacious defense. Way to grid your teeth and bear down, guys.

But where have all the ruggers gone? After some slight altercations with their governing body, the “guts and girls” group are, uh, planning an active recruiting drive in the near future. Their motto now is “Give blood - play rugby or don’t play rugby and give lots of blood.” That’s it for now; cutting out fast. I’m

Pinckney, Strobel, Davis grab awards

The Davidson cross-country team completed its season on Saturday, November 12, at the Region III meet in Greenville, South Carolina. Senior Coty Pinckney ended his career with a superb 54th place finish and a school record time of 30:15 for 6 miles. At the post-season banquet, Pinckney was awarded the Most Valuable Runner plaque as well as the Fred Borch Cross Country Award, which is presented to the runner who gets the most out of his ability. John Davis received the Outstanding Freshman Trophy, and George Strobel was awarded the Highest Mileage Trophy.

The Wildcats are now training in preparation for the track season, and several runners hope to enter the Charlotte Observer Marathon on December 17. Prospects for next year’s team look very bright. Although the team loses Pinckney, Doug Horn will return as captain after missing the majority of this season with an injury. John Hoots, one of the top high school runners in North Carolina, plans to attend Davidson next year and should help immediately. With the addition of these two to his nucleus of rising sophomores and juniors, Coach Norm Koller anticipates a much improved season.
