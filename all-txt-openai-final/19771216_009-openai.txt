Untitled

The super-spy got to the place and realized I'd forgotten the combination — so I tried escaping the trap.

I got to the top, the wall was high. Both sides shot and killed me.

As I lay there, the rain washed the luck from my eyes.

Where you live - Loge, exists just fog in the land of haze and simple dreams.

I can’t see you sometimes when I’m there, and when it burns off, we're in two different worlds again.

Me in ice/fire, place of cruel hard wonders, height’s depth, and you with Christopher Robin in the Snow Queen’s Palace,
ruddy cheeks, bright eyes, fall and spring.

I’m beginning to think you want nothing of my world, and I just want a bridge to your world, but
it’d also breach your walls and allow the K’rang in mine to scuttle into Tiger’s garden.

Je t'aime ma cheri de mon coeur et au revoir.

Hiner Hamrick
