REFERENCE SERVICE SUNDAY AFTERNOON

Starting Sunday, January 30th, on a trial basis a reference librarian will be on duty on Sunday afternoon, 2-5 P.M.
This service is in addition to the regular 7-10 P.M. schedule.

WASHINGTON POST ON-LINE DAILY

In addition to USAToday, you can read the daily WASHINGTON POST from any CHAL terminal. At the menu, select #3.
Use the up/down arrow then to select #1-(americast:wpost) and press ENTER/RETURN. Tag lines appear noting key lines of an article
plus the date (2 days will be kept). Move the arrow to the article desired, press ENTER/RETURN. To select another
article, type DIR and press ENTER/RETURN. To exit, type NEWS or DIR/NEWS and press ENTER/RETURN. That will bring you back
to the main newspaper menu where you will find the USAToday listings. Let us know how you like these papers
on-line; they are on trial runs.

U.S. GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS IN CHAL DATABASE

The Library is a depository for U.S. Government Documents. Until now, you have had to use a separate card catalogue
to locate this valuable material. The Library has added the card files of all of the documents our Library has
received since 1976! This rich resource is easily accessed. When you call up CHAL and search for materials on a
particular subject (by title, subject, key word, etc.), CHAL will give you the list of government documents as well as
books available for you in the Little Library. Remember to note the call number. It will always begin with a
letter (e.g. D3.402:94-1). Documents are located on the ground floor. Be sure to check on the shelf as well in
the microfiche collection; documents come in both formats. Most documents may be checked out at the circulation desk.

SATURDAY NIGHT HOURS

The Library has started staying open until 9 P.M. on Friday and Saturday nights.

INTERLIBRARY LOAN AND PROCEDURES COSTS

The Library no longer is charging students for postage costs for interlibrary loans. There are still some charges made: (1)
for photocopies and (2) for books from some libraries. In either case, the charge is whatever the lending library charges
Davidson. NOTE: Interlibrary loans are to be submitted to a librarian at the Reference Desk. When notified, pick it up
at the Circulation Desk.

VCR AVAILABLE

If you are planning a meeting which requires the use of a VCR, the Library has one available. When making
a reservation for the Lilly Conference Room or the Rare Book Room, please notify us that you would like the
VCR available at that time.

THREE CD INDEXES — HISTORY AND POETRY

America: History and Life (1987- ): Articles from over 2,100 journals, dissertations, and book reviews. Concerns the history and culture
of the U.S. and Canada. Historical Abstracts (1987- ): Articles from over 2,100 journals in all areas of world history
except the U.S. Granger's World of Poetry: Contains text of 8,500 poems, quotations from 1,500 more poems, indexing for 550
anthologies, and anthology locations for 70,000 poems. Can be searched by author, subject, title, first line, or key word. We
have over two dozen other CD indexes.

WHO HAS THAT BOOK? SORRY, WE CAN'T TELL YOU!

It's the law. Davidson is bound by the federal law which states that the Library cannot reveal to another patron
who has a particular book checked out. If you need a particular book, however, don’t hesitate to ask the circulation
manager to call the person who has the item checked out and see if he will bring it back in
early. We'll be glad to reserve the book for you when it comes in.

Watch for news of a test-run of the new computerized circulation system.

All periodicals and what years/issues the Library has will be loaded into CHAL. Also, there will be a tie-in between
this list of titles and holdings with the Wilson Indexes on CHAL. When you find an article you like, you
will be able to tell if the Library owns the title and issue.

Suggestions! Questions? Use the CHAL On-Line Suggestion Box. You'll receive a CHAL-GRAM on-line in return!

Paid for by the CHAL FOR PRESIDENT IN ‘96 COMMITTEE, Peter S. Ney, Campaign Treasurer.
