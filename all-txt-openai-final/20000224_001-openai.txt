Recent construction has forced many student drivers to park in the satellite lot.

By SARAH OGDEN  
Editor Emeritus

Students are growing increasingly frustrated as the construction of a new residence hall and student union disrupt parking patterns on campus.

Some 120 on-campus parking spaces have been lost due to the construction, said Sam McKelvey, Director of Public Safety.

McKelvey said that 60 spaces have been added to the satellite lot behind the Akers, Knox, and Irwin residence halls, and 30 more spaces have been cleared for use elsewhere on campus in order to compensate for the lost spaces surrounding the construction sites.

But until those who park on campus adjust to the new distribution of spaces, McKelvey said, growing pains are inevitable.

“The police are totally intolerant of the fact that we have no parking,” said junior Amanda Norrell. “All they want to do is make money off of us.”

Contrary to popular belief, however, fines from parking citations do not go into the public safety budget.

Sophomore Emily Juckett shared Norrell’s frustration. “When I get my car in two weeks, I think I’m going to park in Baker so I don’t have to pay $80 to register my car,” she said. “There are no other spaces, anyway.”

McKelvey insists that there are enough parking spaces for all registered cars to use, but the “biggest problem is the way people use the spaces,” he said.

“Stagnant spaces,” created when students park their cars in prime spaces and do not move them for several days or even weeks, are a problem, he said. In addition, McKelvey said that the 200 spaces available next to the Baker Sports Complex regularly sit empty.

The public safety director offered one long-term solution to the parking crunch: restrict freshmen to the Baker lot, which would free about 150 student spaces for use by upperclassmen.

McKelvey said he has discussed this idea with the Student Government Association. “I feel there are indications that [assigning freshmen to Baker] is something to look very closely at,” he said.

“So freshmen will have to pay $80 to park in Baker?” asked Juckett. Currently, students without parking permits can park in the Baker lot without being ticketed.

Sophomore Sarah Green, who parks in Baker to avoid paying the vehicle registration fee, said, “I don’t think relegating freshmen to Baker would really be a solution. It will preclude those who park in Baker for free from parking there.”

Randy Skattum, an SGA independent senator, said that the SGA has discussed having freshmen park in the satellite lot behind Irwin, Akers, and Knox residence halls rather than in Baker. “That way,” said Skattum, “no one loses free parking in Baker.”

Before definite plans are made, McKelvey said he hoped to hear more viewpoints at an open forum, which will be held sometime this spring.

**Outpost to leave Patterson Court**

By Baker JORDAN

The construction of the new Campus Center will eventually remove the Union Outpost from its current location on Patterson Court.

The new Outpost should open as a part of the new Campus Center next January, said Richard Terry, Director of Auxiliary Services.

The Outpost currently presents itself as a special eating option for students. Located on Patterson Court among the fraternities and eating houses, the Outpost stays open when other campus dining facilities are closed, serving food from 11 p.m. to 3 a.m., every Wednesday through Saturday.

Sophomore Outpost worker Marty Benson described the Outpost as “an open territory where you can go hang out with everyone.”

Some students fear that the relocation of the Outpost will threaten its atmosphere, while other students and administrators insist that the move could bring rowdy students to an unspoiled campus center.

Terry acknowledged that the current Outpost will be difficult to replace and that some planning is needed to make a successful transition.

“I think we’re not clear yet about what the expectations will be for the [new] Outpost. The atmosphere at the Outpost, particularly in the wee hours, is really different than any other place on campus outside of another Patterson Court house,” said Terry. “That’s going to be something that we all need to talk about before we move into a new place.”

Terry further explained that the administration seeks input about the Outpost from Union Board members, the SGA, students, and faculty.

Some students, however, are not ready for the Outpost to go anywhere. Benson began circulating a petition to “Save the Outpost.” “I wanted to be sure that everybody wanted to
