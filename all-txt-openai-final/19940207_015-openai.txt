THE DAVIDSONIAN SPORTS MONDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 1994 15

Holland, Slagle, Millen head west hoping for another Final Four
By Will Cobb

This Wednesday, Davidson sends its representatives to Kansas City, Missouri, to state their case for the NCAA men’s soccer Final Four for 1995 and 1996 at the annual NCAA soccer association meeting. Representing Davidson will be Athletic Director Terry Holland, men’s head soccer coach Charlie Slagle, and former Director of Marketing Pat Millen. Unlike the past presentations Davidson has given to be able to host the past two weekend events, the trio plans to use a more subtle approach. As Millen puts it, “We have nothing more to prove.” After the 1992 Final Four, the opinion from the NCAA was that it was near perfect. For those who have attended both events, the difference between 1992 and 1993 was substantial, and the NCAA had no suggestions for improvement on last December’s event. Slagle wants the NCAA to recognize the strong foundation Davidson has built for hosting these events.

Mountain Bike Club chartered
By Jimmy Cline

Take a look at all the bike racks around campus and what do you see? Multitudes of mountain bikes crammed together. Mountain Bike Club founders Jim Livingstone, Dave Stewart, and Will McDaniel noticed this abundance of mountain bikes and decided to do something about it. January 27 marked the date of the first meeting of the Davidson College Mountain Bike Club. Seventeen people attended the organizational meeting and many others expressed interest. “The purpose of the club is to organize rides so fellow mountain bikers can gather together and socialize while getting in a good ride," stated co-founder Jim Livingstone. Although some of the members of the club are experienced in racing, all levels of mountain bike riders are invited and encouraged to take part in the rides. Rides are planned to occur approximately once a week, usually on Friday or Saturday afternoon. Future rides include the Beechspring trail in Concord and several South Carolina rides, including one in McAddenville. There is no cost involved in the club except for the responsibility of providing one’s own transportation to the ride sites. The next meeting is scheduled for February 17 at 7:00 p.m. in the Union Pit. If interested and unable to attend, call either Jim Livingstone -6620, Dave Stewart -6635, or Will McDaniel -6633.

The Davidsonian

We, the editors, extend our apology to coach Kerstin Manning and all the women and men of Davidson College for the irresponsible attitudes reflected in last week's article "Manning ready to bring in new era of women's lacrosse." The sexist piece was mistakenly published and in no way reflects our own ideas.

and support for the tournament in Davidson. “The reason we are in the position we are has to do with the cooperation of Davidson College coupled with the support of the Davidson community,” Slagle adds.

Though last December’s event seemed to have no room for improvement, tournament chair Lee Sargent has formulated a 15-page outline of proposed changes for next year. “The 15-page outline for changes shows the dedication Davidson has made to make this event as successful as possible. Lee Sargent puts so much pride into this,” said Millen.

One of the changes proposed includes raising the scoreboard to include more seating in the end zone and also to enable everyone sitting to be able to see the full scoreboard.

Davidson will be competing against the University of Richmond and the University of Maryland to host the event. Davidson stands as the frontrunner. Hopefully the NCAA will recognize that there is no reason to change locations. “I want people to think about the men’s soccer Final Four as AD, After Davidson,” says Millen. If Davidson can keep the same people working on this event with such aspirations, maybe there will never be an “After Davidson.”

Women's track looking good

team tore up the track. Marie Grisez ran a strong first leg (2:30) before handing off to a determined Phuong Nguyen (2:36). Mary Baxter (2:43) and Annie Parsons (2:55) rounded out the relay.

Vanessa Sims debuted in her first Davidson track meet by competing in the high jump. Hoping to clear 5’2", Sims gracefully leaped 5’3 3/4" to place fourth and shatter a school record. In other jumping events, Lara Burkholder leaped 16’9 3/4" in the long jump. In the triple jump, junior Maria “Fishhead” Whitehead soared 34’5" and Burkholder, 31’11 1/2."

In the throwing event, Erika Gromelski challenged her personal best and threw 28’9" in the shot put. The second school record of the day fell when the distance medley relay broke the previous mark by nineteen seconds. The awesome team consisted of Sallie Permar (800, 2:34) Maria Whitehead (400, 64.1) Carolyn Meadows (1220, 4:13) and Jean DeMoss (1600, 5:45).

After two successful track meets, Davidson’s track team can only get better. With a busy schedule and a competitive team, the women look to run faster, jump longer, and throw farther in the next few months.
