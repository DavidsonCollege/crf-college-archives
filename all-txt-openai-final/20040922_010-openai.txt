**Staff Editorial: Learning from Yom Kippur**

Homecoming weekend is supposed to be a time that all Davidson students and alumni can come together and celebrate our school. Yet this year, there is at least one group of Davidsonians who will not be able to take part in the festivities. As The Davidsonian reports this week, the College decided to schedule Homecoming weekend on Yom Kippur, the holiest holiday in the Jewish calendar. Because of this decision, many Jewish alumni and students will be left out of the activities this coming weekend.

Faced with limited dates on which to schedule Homecoming weekend, the College chose to schedule the celebration on the Jewish holiday, rather than have Homecoming overlap with another event such as Decision Davidson or Family Weekend. Since the date conflict was brought to his attention, President Vagt has acknowledged that “If I had known about it I would’ve changed it, and I should’ve known about it.” While College Chaplain Rob Spach created an interfaith calendar listing all major religious holidays so that incidents like this could be avoided in the future, that calendar was ignored in this case. Both President Vagt and Matt Merrell, the Director of Alumni Relations who originally scheduled the date of Homecoming, rightfully acknowledge their mistake and offered apologies to Davidson’s Jewish community.

It is clear to us that the administration did not mean to offend Jewish students and alumni, and while we believe that had President Vagt realized the conflict he would have taken steps to change the date of Homecoming, the fact remains that a group of non-Christian students were neglected. Yet Davidson’s Statement of Purpose says, “The loyalty of the college thus extends beyond the Christian community to the whole human community and necessarily includes an openness to and respect for the world’s various religious traditions.” It should be our goal, as members of the Davidson College community, to try as best we can to achieve that lofty but still achievable end. We must learn from this mistake by promising ourselves that we will never again incidentally exclude a group of Davidsonians from anything because of who they are or what they may believe. As long as we fulfill that promise, we will move Davidson closer to the institution that we can and should be.

**Join the party-people**

Taxes. College loans. The job market. Terrorism. Civil liberties. The environment. Healthcare. Social Security. Iraq. Stop right there. What do you think I’m talking about? If you think I mean some of the issues that should make the choice this November so significant to every student here at Davidson, you are correct. As a member—nay, as a leader—of one of the organizations Nathan Bradshaw so quickly dismisses in his under-informed rant, I can safely say that if you can’t see the importance in ANY of the above issues you must be writing a column for the Davidsonian.

Regardless of ideological and partisan view, these issues impact all of us, and although Mr. Bradshaw doesn’t believe I have the “capacity to choose the leader of the free world,” I believe that I do. And that every single American over the age of 18 does as well. When Mr. Bradshaw so carelessly states that “we still do not really know what Kerry stands for,” he breaks his own cardinal rule that we “find the maturity to listen to all sides of the arguments.” While I do believe that examining the world beyond a partisan filter is a good thing, I take offense at his accusation that no student at Davidson is capable of this.

Mr. Bradshaw makes the assumption that belonging to a political party somehow forces someone to toe a party line. What ignorance would lead someone to judge an organization they’ve never even been a part of? Do I agree with John Kerry or the Democratic Party on every point? Absolutely not. Would I consider myself a strong Democrat? Absolutely. By identifying myself as a Democrat, I have simply aligned with the party that best represents my particular worldview. Membership to a political party (or the Young Democrats/College Republicans) does not preclude individual thought or consideration of the issues; it should follow careful examination and reflection of your own political views.

What makes a democracy so great is the power to choose and have a hand in the future direction of your country. Examine the issues, look at both sides, register to vote, and choose the candidate who comes closest to your views. Just don’t blame those of us who have already made up our minds.

**Kerry’s plan unfeasible**

While John Kerry continues to weekly change his position on the war in Iraq, the Democratic nominee can be credited with maintaining a sense of consistency on his healthcare policy, which Evans McGowan seems convinced “promises a healthier future for all American citizens.” Whenever one considers a political candidate’s stance on a public policy issue, it seems prudent to examine not only what the candidate’s proposal will do, but also what it will not do. If one reads through even a cursory explanation of Senator Kerry’s...healthcare policy, nowhere will one find any plan for stopping junk lawsuits. Nowhere will one hear about any plan for putting doctor-patient decisions back into the hands of doctors and patients. When it comes to driving down the cost of insurance for the already-insured and reducing the number of uninsured Americans, Senator Kerry has but one plan: somehow, someday, he will do it. Is a poll-driven campaign promise really the same as a policy plan? Senator Kerry has made it a campaign promise to first raise taxes and then use increased tax revenues to fund a massive governmental absorption of the American healthcare sector. The Kerry healthcare plan is a brilliant political maneuver, but it is a dead-end policy that will never happen because Congress would have to take two improbable actions in order to make Senator Kerry’s dreams a reality. First, Congress would have to turn an about-face on President Bush’s tax cuts—the very tax cuts that brought America out of a stubborn recession. Second, Congress would have to endorse a massive healthcare investment by the federal government—an unlikely task to charge a Republican Congress with accomplishing. After all, Members of Congress have their own elections to worry about, and congressional elections come around much more quickly than presidential elections. With this and the financial security of America in mind, Congress will keep Senator Kerry’s empty reforms well out of sight.

Choose experience and Bush during War
By NATHAN BRADSHAW
Staff Columnist

No more beating around the Bush, folks. Let’s take an honest look at this election and actually think about it. I will not spew sarcasm; go watch The Daily Show. I will also not speak in deceptions and analyze in inapt similes; go read the New York Times’ op-ed section. I’m here to use a simple thing that Thomas Paine dubbed “Common Sense.” Albert Einstein famously stated, “common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen.” I am indeed eighteen, and I am indeed prejudiced. How? Time to run down the list.

First, I am prejudiced toward experience. The choice here is obvious, as Bush trumps Kerry on all counts. President and former governor undeniably boasts more experience as a political leader (not as a politician) than senator. I find it interesting that Kerry’s experience is as senator of a one-party state. Bush, meanwhile, has spent four years in the highest office of a country that, in fact, did not give him a majority of votes. He has apparently done his job so well that his party considers him stronger than any other option.

Experience, according to Democratic ad campaigns, includes combat, too. That is fair: the president is also the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Yes, Kerry served in Vietnam while Bush used connections to slip into the National Guard. The part that ads fail to mention is that Kerry used similarly questionable tactics to depart Vietnam prior to the end of his tour. As a member of the VVAW, Kerry admitted to having witnessed and participated in some of the more immoral aspects of Vietnam. As a presidential candidate, he has tactfully avoided such statements.

On that note, I also have a prejudice in favor of honesty. I would like to think that in the honor-bound community of Davidson, most would share this prejudice. I just raised one issue with Kerry’s dishonesty—or “selective truthfulness,” if you will—which is not even to touch his well-earned rep as a flip-flopper. Bush is no Honest Abe, either, given WMD inaccuracies and the apparent lack of Iraqi-al Qaeda ties. If, however, we borrow the moral premise that the ends justify the means, then we get a very different look. Bush’s end: the overthrow of a brutal dictator, the liberation of a nation. Kerry’s end: his own purposes as president.

The Vietnam issue is not even the worst of Kerry’s deceptions. He has an entire ad campaign centering on the revitalization of Medicare and Social Security. Nice images of the “young” candidate assuring the “old” retirees that he is on their side abound. We need common sense for a moment. The bottom line of Medicare is that tax dollars go to support those who are too old or infirmed to support themselves. I love this in principle, but if I’m thinking clearly, I will ask one critical question. How many taxpayers will support how many retirees? The answer, as we enter the era of baby boomer retirement, is that the minority will financially support the majority. Please insert common sense here. The logical conclusion, of course, necessitates higher taxes to cover the increased numbers. The Kerry statement, however, is that less than 2% of the population will have higher taxes under his government. Please reinsert common sense and try again. Given that the country, as the media feels the need to remind us every week, has a higher deficit than ever in history, Kerry cannot keep both promises. Whereas Bush’s lies saved some twenty-two million Iraqis from living under the dictatorship of a madman, Kerry’s intent in deception is no more noble than to get his own posterior in the Oval Office. I despise lying politicians, no matter what they do. Given the choice, however, I’ll have a lie save a life rather than get a man into a political office. Round one and round two go most unquestionably to Bush. Got a problem? Refute me.
