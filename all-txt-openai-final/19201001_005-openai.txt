Have You Seen—
Johnnie Gaston's mustache?
Gill Worth’s shirt?
Henry Patterson's sleeve holders?
Jap Cumming’s Sunday hat?
Paul Meng’s umbrella?
Tommie Rethea’s “boots?”

It Pays to Advertise.

Corporal Hughes’ class in Boxing has a few vacancies. If you are a physical weakling, join now. (Adv. slogan.)

You Said It.
Anytime a woman candidate throws her hat in the ring, you can bet it will be last season's hat.

Greetings!
Good morning glory!
How do you dew drop?
I'm well bucket.
Good-bye cycle.

Dr. W. L. Horsed.
Soph—“What is the best class on the Hill?”
Fresh—“Chemistry.”
“Zeb.”

Bravo.
The one and only “Tommie.”

Fresh—“Wrestle with temptation.”
Fresh: “Bring him in.”

Correct—Sit Down.
Frank McLeod to fresh: “If you saw Kimsey riding down the street on a mule, what fruit would it remind you of?”
Fresh (without hesitating): “A pear.”

Maybe You Did.
When we get a pink envelope with white paper in it, we naturally wonder what became of the pink paper that should have been in it. We didn’t get it!

“Hello Henry.”
“Hello There.”
“I knew you didn’t know me. My name’s not ‘There.’”

We Have it All.
Crawford was asked by a Washington and Lee man if Davidson had a “Swing.”
“I don’t know about the ‘swing,’” said Crawford, “but we have an outdoor gymnasium.”

Form a Line—Don’t Push.
Jugs Robinson has started a Zip eating class. All freshmen are advised to take advantage of this expert instruction.

Have you paid your subscription yet? Send those two bones in immediately!This is your last copy of “THE BEST COLLEGE WEEKLY” until we receive!

Soph—“Come here fresh or I'll knock you halfway home.”
Fresh—"Hit me twice.”

On the Bull Board.
“Lost, one ‘American Poets,’ with JOEL McAlpine inside.”

Help, Please
A fresh wants to know if he gets an absence for missing dinner.

We press our suit every time we go to see our girl.

By Way of Suggestion.
A man must think a lot of himself to use his mug as an advertisement. At all odds, it usually succeeds in drawing attention, but so do the apes at the zoo. We believe the Macaques might use this scheme with a great degree of success.

When we see how ugly some girls are “made-up” we wonder what they looked like before if the present is an improvement.

Self-defense is enjoying a large attendance—only left. “See Hughes and let him make a woman out of you.”

One On Us.
The Peanut Catcher has been asked by a bewildered Senior how to tell your “dirty clothes” from your laundry. We must confess that the only way we know of is not to mix them; but even then a difficulty might occasionally arise.

The only difference between man and the other animals is that a man lies standing up.

Jap says that “men may come and men may go, but I'll be Cumming forever.”

Overlooked.
“You can't appreciate home till you've left it, money till it's spent, or a wife until she has joined a woman's club."—O. Henry.

We might add that you can't appreciate the low cost of living until you've bought something at the Commissary. But speaking of the Commissary, it all goes that way. Money runs to them like water runs downhill. Even the neighbor's chickens have started living on their front steps.

That Filthy Lucre.
A Fresh tells us that he has written home for some “root of all evil.” We are pretty shy of that root ourselves.

At the D. C.—N. C. State game, “Frog” Cassell called time. We are told that he wanted to part his hair—those horrid boys were so rough.
