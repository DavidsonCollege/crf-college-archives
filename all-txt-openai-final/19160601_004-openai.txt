SPLENDID SERMONS (Continued from page 1)

but we can put him in touch with One who can, as did the little Hebrew slave in Syria. Our lives will count for something if we put them in the hands of Jesus. They will count in a manifold way and fruit will be multiplied. When we see things in their true perspective they will be that which is great and best. Dr. Sentelle’s style was simple but most earnest and impressive. A large portion of the sermon consisted of Biblical and philosophical studies made during the four years in the classroom.

THE Y. M. C. A. SERMON.

The Annual Sermon before the Y. M. C. A. of Davidson College was delivered by Dr. A. D. McClure, of Wilmington, N. C., Sunday evening. The text was: “I came not to send peace, but a sword.” Dr. McClure began by showing the seeming contradiction between this and the term “The Prince of Peace.” Next he pointed out that, although Christ’s mission was to free us from sin and in this way give us peace from and with God, the effect of His coming was the sending of a sword into man’s own family. Thus he pointed out clearly that there was a perfect harmony between these two passages of scripture. The coming of Christ necessarily broke the kingdom of Satan asunder and Satan tried to combat the progress of Christ and of His Kingdom with the sword. Satan and his myriads of devils were so far successful in that they were able to kill Jesus, but their success was only temporary, as His resurrection broke forever the power of death and of Satan. Followers of Christ must not expect that they will have an easy road to travel. They must realize that a servant is not above his Lord, and as Christ was persecuted they also will be persecuted. Christ came bringing truth and it was immediately attacked and up to the present day Christ and His Word of truth, the Bible, have been continually assailed. A form of error that is very common is for Christians to use the sword to defend the truth. This is never allowed in God’s Word and the only weapon of offense that a Christian should use is the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God. Dr. McClure closed by urging all to become better acquainted with the Bible so that they might have an offensive weapon that was worthy and able to conquer the hosts of sin.

ORATOR’S AND BIBLE MEDAL AWARDED

The most tense moment of the exercises on Wednesday was that just preceding the announcement of the winners of three medals—the Junior and Senior Orator’s and the Banks’ Biblical medal. The winner of the Junior Orator’s medal was W. Y. Sayad, who spoke on the subject, “Islam and the Great War.” The recipient of the Senior Orator’s medal was W. G. Morrison, speaking on the subject, “Defects in the Present College Education.” The Banks’ Biblical medal, the name of the winner of which is not known to anyone until commencement day, save Dr. Shearer, was won by Harlee Morrison.

spoke on “An Unparalleled Opportunity.” He pointed out some disadvantages of Preparedness and showed how the financial condition of the other nations will give America an opportunity for promoting peace.

MEETING OF TRUSTEES
BLANKET FEE PASSED

The blanket fee system, as devised and unanimously passed upon by the student body a month ago, has been ratified and made valid by the Board of Trustees at their recent meeting, which means that the blanket fee system will be in vogue at Davidson next year. Nothing will make more democratic or more revolutionize the petty financial affairs at Davidson than the operation of this new system. Among other matters, the board voted to increase the salaries of the professors and the librarian by $100. Two new professors were also elected. Two important resolutions were tabled. One was to change the date of the annual meeting of the board from commencement to some date in March; the other was that a committee of the trustees should be appointed and known as a visiting committee. Drs. J. M. McConnell, C. M. Richards, and Mr. F. L. Jackson were appointed a committee to provide for the entertainment of alumni at commencement.

The degree of Master of Arts was conferred upon three men, presented by Prof. A. Currie:
W. A. Dumas, Fort Worth, Tex.
DeWitt Kluttz, Chester, S. C.
M. M. Knox, Pineville, N. C.

The Mimir Society, a scholarship society organized last year, held its annual meeting for the election of members Monday morning, May 20th. At that time, the following men were elected to membership in the society:

Harding, and Prof. Douglas from the faculty were elected to membership. Dr. Sentelle was chosen president of the society for the coming year and S. T. Henderson, secretary-treasurer. A small pin, which is associated with an old Norse legend and which was designed by W. A. McIlwaine, of the class of 1915, has been adopted as the society’s symbol. The organization is based chiefly on scholarship, no one being eligible for membership who has not averaged as much as 92.50 in his studies for three consecutive years. The purpose of the organization is to promote intellectual attainment among the students and faculty of Davidson College.
