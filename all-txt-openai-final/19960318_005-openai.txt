### Board: “self government”
By Betsy Bacon
Staff writer

The Judicial Board is a fairly recent addition to Davidson College. Its primary concern is to serve as the self-governing body of Patterson Court. Patterson Court Advisor Beth Bell says that it is a “young body,” approximately three years old, but already it has “grown into a board with self-governance authority.”

The board, which meets every other Tuesday night, is made up of a representative from every house on the court. Junior Molly McGehee, representative from the Patterson Court Council, serves as Sergeant at Arms. “I’m a form of mediator. I have no voting rights; I just run the process of a trial,” says McGehee.

The remainder of the board consists of three faculty representatives, currently Wrestling Coach Tom Oddo, Political Science Professor Susan Roberts, and History Professor John Wertheimer. They are asked by the board to serve for a one-year term. Bell also attends meetings, but she does not have a vote. She says, “My role is to provide balance and at times, offer a reality check.”

According to Bell, the role of the Judicial Board is “to rule on alleged infractions against Davidson College procedures or state and federal laws.” In the past, the board has often dealt with alcohol violations. Recently, however, they have taken on a more “self-governing role.” Bell says that Patterson Court needed a governing committee, and the board has “stepped up to that challenge. It does a good job responding to issues and offering equitable sanctions.”

The Judicial Board tries any case which involves an infraction of a member of a Patterson Court organization acting as a representative of that organization. Often these cases involve the Code.

### Quips and Cranks still delayed
By Mary Clare Jalonick
Executive Editor

As the Quips and Cranks Editors for 1995-96 work on their final deadlines, many students find themselves wondering when they will receive the 1994-95 edition. According to current Co-Editors Junior Shelley Elifson and Senior Lida Fitts, last year’s yearbook has just been sent to the publisher. 1994-95 Editor Junior Amy Liz Betz is currently studying in France with the Davidson Art History Program. She has just recently sent the final copy to the publisher from France.

Elifson says she does not know when the yearbooks will come out. Because spring is high season for yearbook printing, it is possible the Davidson yearbook will be pushed back and considered a low priority. The editors hope to see the yearbooks within the next few months, but it is a possibility that students will not receive them until next fall. “It’s all up to the publisher now,” says Elifson.

Fitts attributes the delays to a lack of students who want to work on the yearbook. “Every year the yearbook has the same problem,” she says. Betz was not able to work on the yearbook at Davidson this summer because she was not allowed to stay on campus for that purpose. The previous Quips and Cranks Editor, Angela Capillary ‘94, had been able to stay over the summer with relatives while she finished working on it. According to Elifson, Betz worked on the yearbook at her home all summer. “Amy Liz didn’t want to sacrifice the quality of the yearbook,” Elifson says, “and that’s why it’s going to be so late. But I think it’s going to be good.”

The original projected date for publishing was October 1995.of Responsibility. When students violate the Code of Responsibility while representing themselves as agents of a fraternity or eating house, their case is brought before the Judicial Board, which hears the case and recommends sanctions to Dean Shandley for Patterson Court. The board’s power ranges from recommending warnings to advising that a house’s charter be revoked. Bell says of Shandley, “He has given the board autonomy and has been very supportive, and [the Judicial Board] is handling their job well. They’re responding quite admirably.”

Student Life urges students to take a break
Weekend fair advertises activities on campus, off campus, in Charlotte and beyond

Taking a walk through the Morrison Room last Wednesday, students found a host of ideas for things to do, on campus, nearby, and throughout the state. The goal of the Weekend Fair was to inform as many Davidson students as possible that they do not have to go far to find something to do besides work. Counselor Art Flagg sat at the Sporting Events table sponsored by the Counseling Center. “There are a number of things you can do when you finish studying. You don’t have to be bored,” says Flagg to students. “Take a break!” he urges.

Sporting Events was the first table in a semicircle of six. On it were listings of NIT and NCAA schedules, Winston Cup results, and schedules for Davidson and Charlotte teams such as the Hornets and the Checkers. The Union Board sponsored a table about Union events. Schedules for Saturday Night Live, the series of Union-sponsored programs held weekly, were available, along with the movie schedule, and information on an upcoming Union-subsidized trip to see Porgy and Bess in Charlotte.

“We offer something every Saturday night, but apparently, some people don’t know about it,” says Molly Johnson, the Union representative for the table.

The Dean of Students’ Office set up a table which listed information on area shopping. Maps to South Park, Uptown, Dilworth, and other merchandise meccas were posted. A Cultural Events table, listing area bookstores, museums, and upcoming Charlotte events, was sponsored by the Bonner Scholars, International Students, and the Chaplain’s Office. Davidson Outdoors posted a huge map of the Carolinas, showing popular locations for outdoor activities. The last of the six tables was provided by the Career Services office. They advertised activities that can be found in the towns of Davidson and Cornelius. According to the myriad of brochures, anything from a five-star meal to a hot-air balloon ride is within minutes of the college.

The Weekend Fair was sponsored by the various divisions of Student Life. Bill Felty, a member of the sub-committee on staff cooperation, a division of Student Life, coordinated the event.
