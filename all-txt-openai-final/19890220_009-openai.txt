THE DAVIDSONIAN

WAS TALKIN’ TO MY BUDDY RAYMOND THIS WEEK, A SNAKE OF THE HIGHEST ORDER AND MEMBER OF THE CLASS OF ‘84 GIFT COMMITTEE.

HE TOLD ME ABOUT SOME OF THE PROPOSALS Y'ALL MADE FOR A GIFT THAT UNFORTUNATELY NEVER MADE IT.

SOMEONE PROPOSED A BARBECUE PIT OUT BY THE NEW APARTMENTS.

SOMEONE PROPOSED A LAKE CAMPUS PAVILION.

SOMEONE PROPOSED A SCULPTURE OUTSIDE OF THE NEW SPORTS COMPLEX.

ONE PROPOSED A BIRD-BATH IN FRONT OF CHAMBERS...

BUT, SNAKE, I THINK THE CLASS OF 1987 OWES DAVIDSON SOMETHING MORE. I THINK WE CAN BEGIN BY REPLACING THE $5,000 WORTH OF STREETLIGHTS BROKEN LAST YEAR. WE COULD REPLACE THE TREES THAT WERE DAMAGED. THEN, WE COULD PAY FOR ALL OF THE UPENDED TRASH RECEPTACLES.

HEY SNAKE, THIS DOESN'T LOOK HARD. HOW HARD CAN IT BE? A FEW CLASSES EACH WEEK, SOME PUSH-UPS HERE AND THERE. WE CAN DO THAT. I SAY WE GO IN.

JOHN ENGEL

I'M RIGHT BEHIND YA.
