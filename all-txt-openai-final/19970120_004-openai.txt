Outpost receives another facelift

By IAN HUMMEL
Staff Writer

Over the holidays, the Union Outpost was given a minor facelift, which included the addition of three new booths as well as a new tile floor. Also, the latticed partition was removed from in front of the ordering counter.

Dennis Rice, the Outpost manager, says these most recent improvements are part of a continuing effort to make the Outpost a nicer and more comfortable place to which students will want to go for an hour, Rice said. Also, according to Rice, the hope is that “by making the place look nicer, the students will treat it nicer.”

Other changes made this school year include the addition of the stage and the glass near the entrance way. In the coming weeks, there are plans to place a big screen TV in the Outpost in addition to some other smaller improvements that will be made.

Rice credited a collaborative effort from Dean Shandley, Assistant Director for Operations Mike Goode, Union director William Brown, and Carpentry Shop supervisor Sam Westmoreland for the improvements. Rice said that they have all been pleased with the work, as have been the students who have come to eat at the Outpost since the changes were made.

Proposals include an appellate process and non-endorsement clause

equal rights and responsibilities under the Davidson College Constitution, the Honor Code, Code of Responsibility, the Code of Disciplinary Procedure, the academic regulations of Davidson College, and these SGA Bylaws.”

The nondiscrimination policy states, “Davidson College admits qualified students and administers all educational and employment activities without discrimination because of race, color, religion, national origin, age, disability, sex, or sexual orientation except where exemption is appropriate and allowed by law.”

Buford also charged the Committee to create an appellate process by which an organization denied a charter may petition the Senate to “reconsider its decision,” according to the proposal. Buford considers this suggestion very important to the revision of the chartering process.

The organization would appeal to the Senate Executive Committee (SEC), “provid[ing] all information required to receive a charter and justification for requesting the Senate to reconsider its decision.” The SEC then would “forward the charter request to the full Senate with a recommendation” or deny the request. The SEC is composed of the SGA President, Vice-President, Chancellor, Treasurer, and the class presidents.

A final addition proposed by the committee states that “the granting or renewing of a renewable charter by the S.G.A. is not an endorsement of the organization receiving the charter, its membership, or its beliefs held in common.”

Buford charged the Committee to make the changes in response to last year’s confusion and controversy regarding the rechartering of Inter-Varsity Christian Fellowship (IVCF). Buford stresses that the committee’s proposed bylaws changes are not aimed at IVCF in particular, but instead the changes will make clearer the requirements needed to gain or retain a charter. “The major reasonto give [IVCF] its charter [last year was] because the bylaws did not state clearly what the major criteria were for an organization to get a charter,” Buford says. “We did this with the idea that it would be fair for the SGA and the chartering organizations.” Buford adds that this will not eliminate all the gray areas from the chartering process. “SGA members will still have to interpret lawful, unlawful, just, unjust discrimination,” he says. An SGA charter entitles an organization, according to the proposed bylaws, to: “official status within the Davidson College community and may represent itself outside the community;” to “request funds from the SGA Treasury through the Senate;” and to “a higher priority in the scheduling of campus facilities than an unchartered organization.”
