**Traffic Discussed By IFC**

A discussion of one-way traffic around the fraternity court during Spring Frolics highlighted the Interfraternity Council meeting Monday night. According
to Tom Brown, IFC secretary, the consensus of the meeting was that the one-way traffic aided “in preventing traffic jams,
particularly on the far side of the court.”

Also discussed at the meeting were the possibility of the IFC assuming full responsibility in dealing with hazing offenses and
an IFC retreat on October 1 to discuss the fraternity system. Ben Cannon was elected to represent the IFC on
the Social Council, while David Jennings, Bobby Vagt, Hal Young, Westray Battle, and Julian Fite were chosen to represent the
fraternity system.

Next week fraternity presidents and rush chairmen will meet with the IFC to discuss next year’s rush regulations.

**Father Conroy Speaks On Changes In Church**

By JOE SAUNDERS
Davidsonian Feature Writer

Today's college student finds himself in a new relation to the church on campus, a Catholic priest told the student
body Tuesday in chapel. Father Donald Conroy, assistant director of the Newman Association at the University of Minnesota, speaking in
the broader context of the role of the layman in today’s church, feels there has been a great change in
the role of the layman of the Catholic Church in the past five years.

In the past, the hierarchy of the Church minimized the priestly role of the laity. But the new constitution of
the Church, drawn up by the Second Vatican Council, gives its highest consideration, not to the hierarchy, but to the
“people of God.” In the constitution, the Council stated that the lay apostolate was a part of the church in
its mission of salvation. Nothing was said about the laity being directed by the hierarchy of the Church. Although commissioned
into the service of the Church by the act of baptism, a decree known as the “lay apostolate” states that
a member of the laity has his own mission apart from the hierarchy of the Church.

Father Conroy also spoke of the role of the Catholic Church in secular universities, which is known as the Newman
Apostolate. He said the only way a church can be active in a large secular university, such as Minnesota, is
through the actions of the students. Both the church and the state have restricted students from forming true religious commitments.
If a student is to be a part of the church on campus he must be free from compulsion. Conroy
further stated, “Unless a man is free, he is not in the church. (He must be) not driven by coercion,
but by a sense of duty.”

During the following coffee hour, Father Conroy answered questions on a wide variety of subjects. A strong supporter of nonviolent
resistance and civil rights, he stated that demonstrations have a proper place on campus, and in some cases may be
the students' only way of making themselves heard. But too often, demonstrators are only expressing “an adolescent urge” to be
seen.

Conroy also gave his opinion of the Vatican Council, the hierarchy of the Catholic Church, and the possibility of the
eventual re-union of the Christian Church. In the future, he said, such a union could be possible, with mutual acceptance
of the Bible as a basis for accord.

**Fine Arts Festival Plans Organ Recital**

The 19th annual Davidson College “Fine Arts Festival” will continue Monday at 8:15 p.m. with an organ recital in the
Davidson College Presbyterian Church. Other events in the month-long festival include movies, art exhibits, a concert by the Davidson College
Male Chorus, and a presentation by the Drama Department.

The Festival began Wednesday night with the presentation of an Underground film, The Brig, and a discussion led by its
director, Jonas Mekas. Ralph Kneeream, assistant organist at St. Paul’s Chapel in New York City, will present the recital Monday.
Kneeream attended the Peabody Conservatory of Music and completed his musical studies at the Manhattan School of Music. Works by
de Grigny, Heinz Zimmerman, J. S. Bach, Langlais, Franck, and Paul Hindemith will be included in the program.

Another event in the Festival, which is planned around the theme “Turn of the Century,” will be a trio of
films about artists. Renoir, Picasso, and Toulouse-Lautrec will be subjects of the films to be shown on May 3 in
the Morrison Room of the Union. The Drama Department will present An Enemy of the People by Henrik Ibsen on
May 5-7 in Hodson Hall. Other events include a movie of the complete opera, La Traviata, on May 9, the
movie Lust for Life, based on the life of Vincent van Gogh, on May 12, and a formal concert by
the Davidson College Male Chorus to be presented on May 17.

Several art exhibits will be on view in the lobby of Chambers Building, the Student Union, and the Cunningham Fine
Arts Center until June 5.

“I am a poet—a poet whose involvement comes from inner need, whose language is film. Beware of poets. Shoot the
poets. And perish. The poets are the Jews of America.”

An animated cartoon by a 10-year-old, a six-hour film of a naked man sleeping, an eight-hour epic of the Empire
State Building standing, and a movie entitled “The Queen of Sheba Meets the Atom Man” are all part of the
underground cinema which Jonas Mekas discussed in the College Union Wednesday afternoon.

Mekas, who appeared on campus for the showing of his film, The Brig, is the acknowledged leader of the underground
cinema in the United States. The Brig was an extremely emotional film about the cruelties to prisoners in a Marine
brig and actually was a film of a play performed in New York two years ago. Mekas went to the
play on its closing night and, five minutes after it started, he said to himself, “I have to film it.”
Mekas thought, “What if this were a real brig and I were making a real film of it?” Thus Mekas
sees The Brig as the last step in the cinema verité, a technique which involves shooting actual events at the
whim of the cameraman producing a “gush of light-motion.”

**REALITY**

To Mekas, treating the play as if it were reality is the ultimate in this technique. Because it was the
play's last run, Mekas had to persuade all the actors to perform one more time especially for his camera. The
entire cast, plus Mekas, who made the film single-handedly, entered the locked theater through a coal chute late that night
and were finished by 4 a.m.

The movie's effect is nerve-wracking. The camera changes angles suddenly and seemingly at random, and the screams of the prisoners
are magnified and distorted by the crude sound system Mekas used.

**SEIZE THE AUDIENCE**

Time says, “The movie does exactly what it sets out to do—seizes the audience by the shirt front and slams
it around from wall to wall for one grueling day in a Marine Corps lock-up.” Mekas himself says that during
the filming, “All my senses were stretched to the point of breaking.”

Mekas feels that the important thing about the film is the impression one gets from it. He

**Dr. James MacGregor Burns To Sponsor Historian**

Dr. James MacGregor Burns, noted political scientist, lecturer, historian, and author, will appear on the Davidson campus Monday through Wednesday.
He will be this year’s first Reynolds Lecturer and will be followed later in the semester by Margaret Mead, famous
anthropologist.

Currently, Burns is the chairman of the political science department at Williams College in Williamstown, Mass. He received his BA
from Williams and his MA and PhD from Harvard.

Burns will lecture here on Tuesday in assembly and in Hodson Hall at 8:15 that night. Wednesday morning, he will
lecture to the History 74 class in the Dome Room and will hold informal discussions at 11 a.m. both Tuesday
and Wednesday in the Morrison Room.

Burns has had a distinguished career in the field of political science. In 1948 he was named as a staff
member of the Hoover Commission, and in both 1954 and 1960 he served on the faculty of the Salzburg Seminar
in American studies. Presently, he is a member of the American Political Science Association and the American Civil Liberties Union.

**Rotary Awards Go To Three Seniors**

Three seniors have been awarded Rotary Fellowships for study abroad next year. Those receiving the fellowships are John Callender from
Jacksonville, Fla., who plans to study the classics at St. Salvador’s College of the University of St. Andrews in Scotland;
Decker Faw, from Salisbury, Md., who will study political science at the London School of Economics; and Bill Logan, from
Jackson, Ala., who will study chemistry in Australia.

Rotary Fellowships are awarded annually to superior college seniors for one year’s graduate study abroad. During this year, the student
serves a dual role as both an “ambassador of good will” and a scholar. Fellowships are available for study in
49 different countries, the hope of Rotary International being to “further understanding and goodwill among people of different nations.”politics, Burns
was a delegate to the Massachusetts Democratic Convention in 1952, 1956, and 1960. He was also the Democratic candidate for
Congress from Massachusetts’ First District in 1958. Other areas in which Burns has been interested are education and social welfare.
In the past, he was a member of the Board of Advisors of Berkshire Community College and is now a
member of the Board of Trustees of Stockbridge School. He also served his community as chairman of the Berkshire County
Committee against Discrimination. During the second World War, he was a combat historian in Guam, Saipan, and Okinawa. Burns’ more
prominent books include The Deadlock of Democracy, Roosevelt: The Lion and The Fox, John Kennedy: A Political Profile, and Four
Party Politics in America. In 1956, he was the recipient of the Tamiment Institute award for the best biography and,
in 1957, received the Woodrow Wilson Prize for his contributions to periodicals.

BITTER END SINGERS SET FOR CONCERT WEEKEND (See Page Three)

NUMBER TWENTY-SEVEN

Students Will Consider Regulations Changes
Court May Improve Honor System Concept

The Student Council made plans for Monday’s referendum at its meeting this week. The referendum will include voting on the
proposed Student Body Regulations Court and on the gambling and hazing regulations. Paul Marion, who will chair the Student Body
Regulations Court, said, “This change will improve the enforcement of Student Body Regulations as well as the Honor System.” Marion
added, “I would urge the Student Body to repeal both the gambling and hazing regulations. Neither rule has student support
and therefore hurts the whole idea of Student Body Regulations. The gambling regulation was originated when gambling was considered immoral
and to protect students from misusing their money. The hazing regulation was to protect freshmen against hazing by upperclassmen. Since
it is now solely a fraternity issue, the IFC is the proper enforcement agency.”

The council elected Steve Humphrey student representative to the Committee on Fraternities, Clubs and Social Life; Arch McCallum and Tom
Cook to the Athletic Committee; Tom Earnhardt as Chairman of the Referendum and Polls Committee; and Fletcher Hartsell as Davidson's
delegate to the State Student Legislature. A committee to study a Course Evaluation Program was set up with Ken Autrey
as chairman, and Ben Cannon and John Gresham as members. A proposal that the Council support Ken Childs in his
investigation into the possibility of turning the Carolina Hotel into a coffee house for students and professors was accepted. In
other business, the Council approved a suggestion by Tom Rhodes that articles stolen from the gym be reported to the
Athletic Department and Tom Earnhardt’s plan to eliminate Chapel and Vesper cuts if they are not recorded within a week.

Social Life Report Brings Forth Generally Favorable Reactions
By JIM COOLEY
Davidsonian Staff Writer

Reaction to the final report of the Social Life Evaluation Committee, in which the committee attempted to define the role
of fraternities and other social clubs on the Davidson campus, has been generally favorable. The eight-page report was commended as
a positive and objective approach to the problem, though it was in some respects rather vague. Mike Booe, president of
the IFC, was “impressed with it as a whole. I thought it was fair and well thought out,” he said.
Penn Spell, president of KA, called the report “optimistic” and added that it “came close to defining the problem,” while
Andy Little, an independent, considered it “misleading to call these groups fraternities after redefining their expectations and their very nature.”
Dr. J. D. Kelton, associate professor of psychology, stated, “I have a great deal of general agreement with the report.
The plea here,” he continued, “is one for everybody on the campus to take an honest look and not just
to defend positions.”

THOROUGH AND UNBIASED

“Honest, thorough, and unbiased” was the manner in which Professor W. G. McGavock described the committee's report. John Todd, an
independent and former editor of The Davidsonian, saw it as “a formal report of what fraternities can do, not what
they must do.” He added that it was “unfortunate” that the report had not circulated among the fraternities and the
independents. In examining the first problem presented by the report — that of “rejection” — eating clubs were generally considered
a desirable corrective measure. Both Booe and Tom Brown, president of PKA, looked at eating clubs as competition which the
fraternities needed in order to improve themselves.

FRAGMENTATION

Little felt that such clubs could bring together the “fragmentation of student life — social, intellectual, athletic.” Dr. McGavock saw
a distinct place for the eating club on campus and thought that some students would welcome a choice instead of
being “forced into the fraternity mold.” Booe believed that the presence of active clubs of this type on campus would
cause the fraternities to first sell the Greek system and then the individual houses, instead of relying on the fact
that no other type of social affiliation was available. Todd agreed that the core of the problem is providing social
life for all who want it. “I have no argument against the groups themselves, but against the system with its
rejection.”

A second problem cited by the committee was termed “anti-intellectualism.” Both Booe and Todd felt that the fraternities were taking
steps to rid themselves of that stigma. “The fraternities must broaden their scope — not just have parties and eat
together,” Booe said. Dr. Kelton expressed the belief that fraternities have simply evolved to serve social rather than intellectual needs.
Little continued with the same idea. “Anti-intellectualism,” he said, “comes partially from the fact that the fraternity is organized on
an entirely social basis.” Dr. Max Polley, associate professor of Bible and religion, didn't believe the fraternity should be another
classroom, but they “shouldn't be in opposition to the academic life.” Dr. McGavock saw the problem as an attitude within
the fraternity, not as an external program on its part. He expressed the idea that it was difficult to show
an “outward manifestation of intellectualism” and that the fraternities were creating an atmosphere within themselves which inhibited the expression of
academic interests.

ISSUE IS SELECTIVITY

Dr. Kelton submitted that the issue lay not with these two problems but instead with the desire on the part
of the fraternities to select some students and to reject others. He contended that the advantages of “close association with
others,” of a “congenial and relaxed atmosphere,” and of an “organized social life” — the advantages of fraternity life listed
in the report — could be provided in ways other than fraternities. The basic problem was the desire to be
a part of a selective system. He added that this problem was compounded by the organization of the fraternities on
a national level. In summarizing the report, Bob King, a senior member of ATO, stated, “The committee report has given
the fraternities the benefit of the doubt in not judging our responsibility to the college community. I believe the report
shows that fraternities are not filling their role and that the time has come for us to justify our existence.”
Booe concluded that “if we don’t show some positive response, then the fraternity system is on the way out at
this college.”
