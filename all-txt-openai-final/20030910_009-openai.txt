**Complaints and Comments**

**The fine line between love and lunacy**

Picture this: you’re alone in your living room watching TV, wearing an inside-out baseball cap. You’re wedged uncomfortably between the couch cushions, with fingers crossed and hands raised high above your head. As you stare intently at the screen, sweat begins to roll down your forehead and tears form in the corners of your eyes. Have you gone insane? It all depends on what you’re watching. If it’s a rerun of “Happy Days” that’s on the tube, people might start to worry. If, however, your favorite team is in the middle of a late-game comeback attempt, this behavior is considered perfectly normal.

There’s something about the die-hard sports fan that makes insanity, compulsivity, and obsession socially acceptable as long as these otherwise vices are channeled towards rooting for a group of athletes competing for what amounts to nothing in the real world. Actions that would ordinarily warrant concern receive little as long as they are attributed to being a fan. That’s exactly what makes it fun.

Under what other premise could you insist on sitting in the same crack between the cushions every time it’s close in the fourth quarter because Sprewell hit a three the first time you sat there? Where else could you openly profess your belief that waving stuffed monkeys around brings about good luck? Superstition is the norm: never mention a perfect game while it’s being pitched, put those rally-caps on when you’re behind, fear the curse of the Bambino (or love it).

Fanatics also specialize in legalized stalking. They wear clothing featuring their favorite players’ names and numbers, collect their pictures, make scrapbooks, and obsess over anything they touched, signed, or fouled off. Some even wait outside stadiums and restaurants for a chance to approach their heroes. Imagine walking into a stranger’s room to see posters of yourself plastered all over the wall, a self-portrait that you don’t remember signing sitting on a desk, and a collection of some of your old clothing and athletic equipment in a glass case. The stranger is wearing a shirt with your last name on the back. You’re out of there in a second.

But it’s hard to hate these die-hards. They travel hundreds of miles just to sit in the bleachers at away games, and they come to every home game, fair weather or otherwise. They fight the rain with garbage bags and combat the heat (and sometimes even the cold) by removing clothing. Even when there’s no joy in Mudville, they show up with sad faces, which...

**Once again Phil Mickelson didn’t make the cut. Although this time, it was his fastball that kept him from making it, not his putting. Mickelson was cut from the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens (Tiger’s affiliate) after a tryout in which he pitched batting practice to the team’s pitchers. Talk about a tough assignment...**

**Ned Yost, the manager of the Milwaukee Brewers, promised his team that if they won 10 games in a row the coaching staff would wear Hooters uniforms. Sure enough, the Brewers prevailed on August 28 with a win over the Reds. And sure enough, the entire coaching staff sported the orange “short” shorts and white t-shirts for the team’s flight to Chicago. Who knows what waitresses they borrowed the outfits from to fit the overweight coaching staff...**

**Dennis Rodman was released from jail on Friday after being caught driving his boat in Newport Harbor under the influence of alcohol. Reports say that Rodman fell over while tying up his boat. One would think that Newport cops...**

**For you, competition, as women drove... rained out. compete in front...**

**If you have sports-related opinions you would... Mike Giglio at migiglio@davidson.edu.**may or may not be hidden beneath paper bags. Would understand Rodman’s fun after visiting his house 70 times since his retirement... Former NBA players Robert Parish and James Worthy were inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame on Friday. That’s a total of 14 feet and 2 inches of greatness.

After the countless hours and dollars and energy spent, what’s it all worth to these fans? The results and the spreads show that home-field advantage is no mere superstition; most teams play better at home. Bleacher creatures and cheeseheads and hogs do make a difference. Perhaps that’s just it, knowing that all the screaming and hoping and praying might actually help your team win. Maybe simply loving a team is enough to incite all the hysteria.

As I drove home from Washington, D.C., this Saturday, after sacrificing class, homework, and far too much money to see my beloved Jets lose to the Redskins in Thursday’s NFL opener, I contemplated all this. The highlight of my weekend, despite the loss, was standing up in the middle of upper deck section 231, pointing to my green Mo Lewis jersey, and screaming at all the Redskins fans about how much better the Jets are. The next best part: having them return the favor for the entirety of my long walk to the parking lot.

Maybe that’s the answer. Maybe I just needed some justification for missing class, taking a road trip, and allowing myself to escape from reality for a little while and just go crazy. Maybe everyone needs that once in a while. But that still doesn’t explain the sickening feeling I got from watching the game-winning field goal from ex-Jet John Hall sail through the uprights with seconds left in the fourth quarter. Maybe it’s a little bit of both.

After suffering a broken left orbital bone, unknown damage to his eye, and a chipped tooth, Romanowski told coach Bill Callahan, “I’ve never really had problems controlling my temper”... In other sports violence, Pirates first baseman Randall Simon, for those wondering... Seven-time world champion snooker player Stephen Hendry was informed after landing in Scotland that his cue stick had been broken on the flight from Thailand via Thai Airways. Hendry immediately brought his lucky stick to “cue doctor” Lawrie Annadale, but his repairs were not good enough. For the first time since Hendry was 14, he will use a new cue stick.

Bill Romanowski of the Oakland Raiders has apologized for his attack on teammate Marcus Williams. During a Raider practice, he reportedly ripped off Williams’ helmet and punched him in the side of the face. Romanowski was suspended for a day of practice, and Williams’ season is most likely over after suffering a broken left orbital bone, unknown damage to his eye, and a chipped tooth. Romanowski told coach Bill Callahan, “I’ve never really had problems controlling my temper”...

In a public relations activity at Wrigley Field, fans dress in different meats and race around the bases. The unfortunate lady dressed as a sausage was struck by Simon’s bat, causing her to fall. Simon closed the case with the lady dressed in a sausage outfit with a $432 check. I hope his wife takes the hint in what not to cook for breakfast.

40-year-old wicketkeeper-batsman Alec Stewart ends his 133-Test career after a 9-wicket win at the Oval. Quoted after his final match, “There was some good batting, some good bowling, and it was an excellent wicket here.” Some good talk about an excellent sport here.
