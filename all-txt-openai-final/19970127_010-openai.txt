**Meavy Petting**

**Freshmen have their first-time hands-on experience with exotic animals**

Deep in the heart of the Rowan County Soil and Water Conservation District lies a tiny slice of wilderness, Mooresville style. The Lazy 5 Ranch is a petting-zoo experience for everyone, from little girls (actual visitor quote: “Oh Daddy, how I would like to take one of the baby goats home!”) to Davidson college students.

One sunny Saturday afternoon, four such adventuresome students pulled into the Lazy 5 parking lot (see safety tip no. 1), moseyed up to the Trading Post and traded $7.50 each for a nail-biting journey through a maze of large flightless birds, pregnant swine, and ungulates of all sizes.

Before entering the motorcar portion of the ranch, we visited the caged animals near the trading post, which featured a very lethargic camel and several exotic birds. Several llamas were also there, but these “perissodactyls of the evening” will only be petted while you feed them.

Then, we decided to challenge the turkeys that stand guard at the entrance of the gravel road into the wilderness. After some coaxing, they let us pass, and we drove into the jaws of the forest. We soon discovered that the ranch is under the collective thumb of the ostrich mafia. Only the truly foolhardy dare question their authority. Often during our journey, our progress was regulated by gangs of ostriches pecking at our windows and standing in front of our car.

The emus are smaller, but no less belligerent than their ostrich cousins. Both species eat feed out of the bucket with violent, thrusting pecks; however, the emus feed more efficiently than their relatives. The ostriches, much like Cookie Monster, shovel great quantities of food toward their maws only to have it invariably fall to the ground.

Several herds of deer-like animals also populate the park. Many of them, including the elk, were the most docile of the beasts we tried to feed. But beware of the small Oriental deer: though cute, they will molest the hand that feeds them.

Perhaps the most ubiquitous of the Lazy 5’s inhabitants are the diminutive pigs that scurry across the grassy plains. The preponderance of pigs probably stems from the fact that every sow we saw was very, very gravid.

Perhaps because they had the coolest names, the yak, water buffalo, and bison would not lower themselves by acknowledging our presence, even when we threw food at them.

As we left the ranch, followed by an adoring group of burros, we decided that despite the steep price, the Lazy 5 Ranch would prove an amusing diversion for any college student with the right mindset and an affinity for large hoofed mammals.

**Important Safety Tips for Visiting the Lazy 5:**

1. When attempting to park, do not hit the pigs in the parking lot.
2. Do not eat the animal feed. Will was not impressed with the flavor.
3. Do not pet the horned animals.
4. Obey the official park rule against feeding children to the animals.
5. Hold on to your bucket o’ feed tightly — some of the critters really get into their meal.
6. Don’t drink the “Brownie Chocolate” drink in the vending machine — it’s really just satanic Yoo-Hoo.
7. Don’t mess with ostriches.
8. Don’t ask the clerk about the Lazy 5 family unless you have at least half an hour to spare talking about ACC women’s hoops.
9. Look out for ambushes — those exotic animals can be darn sneaky.

**How to get there for your own adventure:**

Take Main Street/Highway 150 north through Mooresville. Bear left at Highway 152 so as to avoid colliding with the Mooresville Collision Repair Company, Inc. The ranch is on the left — just look for the steer and burros in the front yard. Call ahead for wagon ride appointments.the pig (you’ll know him when you see him)
2. The largest pile of dung you can find (hint: check near bison)
3. The epileptic llama
4. The Elizabethan-collared birds
5. The “WHOA” sign
6. The reindeer (hint: go in December)
7. The Watusi cattle (bonus points if you find all 200)
8. The stoic caribou
9. The elk that likes to moon Hondas
10. The pig that’s pregnant AND nursing
11. The albino emu

Hayes Trotter uses the force

Expression is a complicated process, and many of us would rather keep our ideas to ourselves rather than risk public criticism and possible humiliation. However, there are many souls here who have pulled themselves together with courage and drive to become Davidson’s finest. With this in mind, I’d like to announce that the Arts and Living section will present biweekly profiles of student artists in residence.

This week I had the pleasure of spending some time with Hayes Trotter. Hayes is a studio art major who is currently preparing for senior exhibition. Hayes is known for his warm, caring personality, and his dynamite sense of humor. One of Hayes’s most popular works is a wall-sized fresco of a dynamic hyperjump scene from Star Wars.

Hayes, what is art?
Trotter: I’d say art is a means of sharing. It is a vehicle to invite people into the world of imagination. It is sort of an instigator. Engaging yourself in visual art allows you to look at things in a different manner.

How did you become interested in the world of art?
Trotter: Way back in Kindergarten, I drew this little piece with Cowboys and Indians. I remember it because I liked it a lot, and because I had a lot of fun doing it, and I received a lot of feedback from my teachers. Then, stuff just kept happening and there was a lot of support for the stuff I was doing from my parents and some of my teachers. I guess they helped direct me to do something that I really enjoy. If you receive support, then you are more likely to challenge yourself. There are also people who can step out and just start making art on their own and they do just as good of a job as someone who has that support.

How can those of us who are not artists show our support?
Trotter: First of all, I think everybody is an artist. Everyone is able to create. Everyone is able to express. I think a lot of people are intimidated by the enormous amount of visual art out there. Just being conscious of what’s out there or going to museums or just reading the arts section in the paper — there is a lot of neat stuff out there. Or maybe just taking a class for an hour a week or something. Become familiar with art; it’s fun.

Who are some of your favorite artists?
Trotter: I like this artist called Red Grooms. He’s my fave. He does sort of cartoony stuff, and he uses lots of different sculptures/paintings. He drew this picture of Graham Tarkington, a quarterback for the Vikings. Anybody who can make art out of Graham Tarkington has got to be pretty sweet.

Hayes, could you tell us a little bit about your mural?
Trotter: Well, we [Hayes and his roommates] had the means to do something, and thought it was a good idea. I figured this was a good chance to lay down some hyperspace. I mean, to be honest it’s really not that incredible of a painting, but I think that it’s sort of a novelty idea. Just the fact that it’s large, and if you try real hard you can almost feel like you are in the Millennium Falcon. It’s fun; people come in and talk about it. Believe it or not people have a lot of deep feeling for Star Wars, and I feel the love of Star Wars is elicited by the painting. It’s pretty comedy more than anything. Plus, I needed a place for my stand-up Wookie.
