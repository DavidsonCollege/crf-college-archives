MacLads Homecoming: The Primer
By GLENN FOGLE and ASH AHSANUDDIN

Well, it’s another wonderful weekend for being bored at Davidson except this weekend is special--it’s Homecoming! If you are a
freshman you will not have experienced this time for revelry and general fun. You freshmen who are fortunate enough to
have dates to the Homecoming dance should be looking forward to discovering why most of the upperclassmen decide to avoid
this opulent extravaganza at all costs. But on the bright side, you will at least have someone of the opposite
sex who is interested in you (hopefully) to share your boredom with. Those of you who do not have dates
are less fortunate. Yet never fear, the MacLads have put their heads together this week and have come up with
a few suggestions to aid you in avoiding the “slough of despond.” Here are ten suggestions for lads and lasses
minus dates who would like to liven up their Homecoming weekend.

Ladies (because they should always be first):
- Read War and Peace. If you finish this, go on to The Gulag Archipelago.
- Join the Support Group for women who have a problem with food. It meets Mondays from 6:30-7:30 in Chambers
301. No men allowed. Check announcements for further details.
- Throw water balloons at alumni.
- Write a letter to the MacLads and include your name and Davidson address.
- Call Grant Morain (-6334) because he’s still looking for a date.
- Crash a fraternity cocktail party (or more than one).
- Answer this ad we found in the “Miscellaneous” announcements... “WANTED: Davidson woman who would like to live in a
lovely Davidson home free in exchange for 10 hrs. of work per week. Light driving and shopping, and just being
at home. Call ext. 225."
- Buy a gallon of your favorite ice cream and eat it all at once.
- Write a letter to The Davidsonian protesting the sexist slurs on the Captain Pike Dog posters.
- Take all the belongings of one of your friends who has a date and put them in the bathroom
while she is at the Homecoming dance.

Gentlemen:
- Throw water balloons at alumni (you can do this too but a variation of this is to put food
coloring in the balloons).
- Enroll in Queens College (they take guys now).

Look, ma! New column!

Confidential Health
By AUDREY SHIELDS

This is a new column based on a question-and-answer format, intended to give information on any issue concerning your health
and well-being. “Confidential Health” is written through the advice and expertise of the staff and faculty on campus and through
the resources of the Davidson community. The Davidsonian staff is not involved in reading or answering the questions. This is
a confidential process.

Some of the most commonly asked questions deal with issues surrounding our behavior and personal choices. Some of these issues
include: sexuality, sexually transmitted diseases, contraception, heterosexual and homosexual relationships, alcohol and drug use, nutrition, fitness, tobacco use, stress, eating
disorders, depression, and other mental health concerns.

This week Dr. Audrey Shields from the Infirmary answers a question of concern to most students.

“Dear Confidential Health -- It seems like I always have a cold. What can be done about colds? Can they
be prevented?” -- S.K., Davidson

“Dear S.K.: Unfortunately, the average adult has from two to four colds yearly. Colds are caused by many different strains
of respiratory viruses. Most colds last for from four to seven days. There is no antibiotic for a cold, so
treatment is directed toward relief of the symptoms. Nasal congestion is usually helped by decongestants such as Sudafed or phenylpropanolamine.
A variety of cough syrups and throat lozenges may also help. Vitamin C offers no real proven benefit. As always,
adequate rest and good nutrition help your body to fight the virus. A “cold” lasting for more than a week
may...actually be due to allergies rather than a virus. Occasionally, colds can result in sinus or bronchial infections. If your
cold doesn’t resolve itself in seven days or if high fever develops, you should consult your physician. The best way
to prevent a cold is to avoid physical contact with people who have colds. Hand-washing is particularly beneficial in this
regard. Some spreading of the virus occurs from droplets (i.e., a sneeze), but most people give colds to others from
direct physical contact. No vaccine against the cold currently exists. If you have a question, please send it to: Confidential
Health... c/o Davidson Infirmary. No signature is necessary.

* Borrow a Cushman (stealing is an honor code violation) and try to drive to Cornelius and back without being
noticed.
* Penny your friend who has a date in his room while he is getting dressed for the Homecoming dance.
* Get a bunch of friends who don’t have dates either and crash a fraternity cocktail party (or more than
one).
* Vandalize your roommate’s contraceptives before he makes it back to the room with his date.
* Go check out the scene at the Dragstrip or go “cruising” down the main drag in Monnaie.
* Offer to chauffeur a friend and his date down to Charlotte and take the unsuspecting couple on a road
trip to the Fox triple X Drive-in Movie Theater on Highway 115 south (just a few miles past Cornelius) instead.
* Drive down to Heritage U.S.A. with your “Bring Jim and Tammy Back” banners, then march up and down Main
St. waving your banners and making lots of noise until you get asked to leave.
* Sit in your room and figure out pi to the 100,000th decimal place and send the results to The
MacLads. We’ll print your answer in next week’s issue.

Question of the week: Who declared to his/her colleagues, “God speaks to me in dreams”?
A. Bob the Carrot.
B. Maggie Thatcher.
C. President Kuykendall.
D. Max Polley.
E. All of the above.

If you know the correct answer, write us immediately because we would like to find out what God says to
this person.

NOTE: Furthermore, it must be noted that some brain-damaged “editor,” namely the Features Editor, forgot to include the name of
Mr. John Harris Esq., who conceived most of last week’s edition, in the author credits. Our apologies.
