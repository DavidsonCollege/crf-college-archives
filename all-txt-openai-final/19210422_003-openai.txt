THE DAVIDSONIAN, APRIL 22, 1921.

He Who Laughs Last Laughs Best.

Don’t try to crawfish, you fellows who cut Mitchell's mustache off. Today is the day that you are expected to pay a round $25 for the assault and battery. However, don’t run around any more like you have been doing for the past week scared to death for fear you will all be arraigned in court. The joke is all on you, for the assaulted one never had any intentions of suing you. And to think that “Crack” Brown wrote home to get advice about paying up. And “Red” Smith was only willing to pay $12.50 being as only half of it was cut off. And now Romefelt, McFadden, and C. K. Brown will sleep well. Hard luck, fellows.

MINISTERIAL BAND OFFICERS FOR FOUR MONTHS ELECTED

The Ministerial Band held its regular meeting for the election of new officers on last Sunday afternoon. J. I. Knight ‘22, was chosen president; T. L. Fraser, ‘23, vice-president, and G. M. Moryéw, ‘24, secretary. The meeting was devoted mainly to the elections; and the program was dispensed with on this account. The new officers are men whose interest is in the task at hand, and a very successful year’s work under their direction is expected by all the members.

INTERESTING SERVICE OF VOLUNTEER BAND HELD

On last Tuesday evening the Volunteer Band held a very impressive meeting in the Sunday School room of the church. Although only about two dozen members and a half-dozen visitors were present, there was plenty of interest in the meeting and the singing was especially good. Harold Moss read as the Scripture lesson the fifth chapter of Romans, beginning with that famous verse: “Therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.” After the Scripture lesson and prayer Wigs Bradford read a very interesting and enlightening letter from Plumer Smith, one of Davidson’s loyal alumni, who is now working in Mutoto, in the Congo Mission in Africa. The Band then received the reports from the two deputations sent out on the preceding Sabbath: Junebug Price and P. D. Miller, from the First and Second Churches of Salisbury, and Ted Jones and Jap Cumming from Sharon and Carmel Churches, near Charlotte. The reports of this phase of the Band’s work were extremely gratifying and encouraging. After a circle of sentence prayers, the meeting broke up with the usual friendly handshake.

BIBLE CLASS ATTENDANCE SHOWS MARKED INCREASE

The attendance at the dormitory Bible Classes last Sunday morning was 138 with the mission study classes raising this amount to about 175. This was nearly 100 percent increase over the Sunday before, but there is still room for improvement. The classes are not long, only about 30 minutes, and this time can easily be spared by everyone. The mission study classes, led by Major Hearn and Dr. Arbuckle in the Library, are especially beneficial. Everyone is cordially invited to come and take part.

INSTALLATION OF NEW “Y” OFFICERS SUNDAY EVENING

Next Sunday evening, April 24th, at the regular meeting of the “Y,” the new officers and cabinet for the coming year will be formally installed. There will be no elaborate ceremony, but the president hopes to have every member of both the old and the new organizations seated on the two front benches, and the old men will at this time turn over their duties and responsibilities to the new men. Four short talks will make up the main part of the program. Lewis Schenck and Buck Curry will give a few parting words of advice, while J.P. Price and Pat Crawford will outline in general the work that the “Y” hopes to carry out next year. Special music will be furnished for the service by Ed. Cunningham.

MITCHELL COLLEGE GLEE CLUB PRESENTS PLEASING PROGRAM

Young Ladies and Director Render Worth-while Entertainment.

“Enough to set a fellow wild.” That was the universal verdict of the audience at the close of the concert given by the Glee Club of Mitchell College in Shearer Hall on last Monday evening. The bevy of beautiful girls, coupled with the harmony which they so successfully produced, rendered the occasion a tremendous success.

One of the first as well as the best of the numbers was the solo of Miss Marion Moore, in “Thank God for a Garden.” She certainly made one thank God for her when she responded to the applause in a successful encore, “I Love You.”

The reading, “The Going of the White Swan,” given by Miss Estelle Brown, was very effective and the audience could almost see the frozen land of Labrador, and the little log cabin where the scene was laid. Her encore was “The Courtin’,” a fanciful bit of humor.

The solo work as well as the charming appearance of Miss Aileen Terry made her part of the program very enjoyable and interesting, to say the least of it.

The whole Glee Club gave several songs en masse of which the most appealing were “Ching-a-Ring,” “Feather Your Nest,” “Irene” and “Margie.”

Mr. Adrian Wynnobell, the director of the club, sang in his deep and powerful voice a Barrack-Room Ballad of Kipling’s. He was repeatedly encored and received the best hand of the evening.

In closing, the club sang “Here’s To Our Alma Mater,” a Mitchell College song, in such an effective way as to bring regret to the minds of everyone that one of the most enjoyable occasions of many moons was over.

PRE-EMINENT IMPORTANCE OF SOUL (Continued from page 1)

This problem: “What shall it profit a man, if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul?” The student finally solved it by becoming a Christian and leading many others into the path of peace. Dwight closed his talk by saying that when we once realize the supreme importance of the soul, we will need no urging to cultivate it: that we will feed it upon God’s Word, bring it into the sunshine of God's presence, and exercise it in deeds of kindness and goodwill.

WAKE FOREST SECURES CLOSE DECISION (Continued from page 1)

Found the Wake Forest men nice fellows and had a pleasant fellowship with them. The Meredith College girls, and the others present at the debate, were very generous with their applause to both sides, and the Davidson men were roundly congratulated for their fine debate, quite a number of people coming up on the platform to shake hands before the fellows had time to come down. The fellows regretted that the dean of Meredith could not let her girls stay downstairs longer, for things were just getting real interesting when the curfew rang.

A hearty word of appreciation for the work of the alternates is due. Mr. Monteith, of Wake Forest, and Dwight Miller, of Davidson, left no detail unattended to that would make for the success of the debate or for the comfort and satisfaction of the debaters. P. D. Q. was right there with the old pep and pulling for old D. C. with a hearty goodwill. He did much to strengthen the team that went against Wake Forest.
