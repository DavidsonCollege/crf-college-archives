-——teen the sands

the old man is
war at seven-

of Arizona
training desert
feet

sliding like the
rocks and gravel
on the slopes of
German hills, the
clouds of sands
or artillery fire
covering all of
that within slow
smoke

dark steel rifles

in arms, smaller
silver crosses in
tight hands, broken
flesh and metal
staining some god-
forsaken little piece
of death ground that's
miles from the wood
pews of any heaven

the tattoo on an

old man's bicep from
a carnival then,

ferris wheel top

with a pretty Mexican
girl who still

spins in his mind

like a street dancer,
or the shattered
pieces of a right

hand taken off

at the wrist by

the whirling fragments
of an unseen grenade

Bran’s Mother

“Yet let us hence, and find or feel a way

Through this blind haze, which ever since I saw

One lying in the dust at Almesbury,

Hath folded in the passes of the world.”
Tennyson, “The Passing of Arthur”

Someday a man will search for you
And he will see you there:

You will be walking up a hill,

You will be wearing whitest silk.
Someday a man will come to you
While gold flies through the air.
He will shower down upon you,
He will throw his arms around you.

-Rachel Nation ‘91

One day a man will see you walking
And he will buy the road.

You will be filling up a bucket,

You will be wearing dust and water.
One day a man will see you walking
And he will have a rose.
His horse will be as white as chalk,
He will be wearing gold and scarlet.

And soon a man will come to you
Though you may fear his voice;

His hands will be as strong as lions,

His hands will seek yours, that is certain.
And soon a man will come to you

And offer you a choice:

You may track in clay and water;

You may circle, breathing silver.

He will take you in his arms as he has held a sister;
And he will look upon your breast and he will see a
mother;

And he will see a wife while he is looking at your finger;
And he will feel your pangs and recognize his lover.

-Douglas Gibson ’91
