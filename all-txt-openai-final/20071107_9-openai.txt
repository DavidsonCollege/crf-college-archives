The Davidson Wildcats field hockey season drew to a close last weekend in the NorPac Tournament. The Wildcats achieved their first opening round win in seven years but fell in the semifinals and lost again in the third-place game.

The Wildcats opened with a 4-2 victory over Longwood on Thursday. Britti Himmelfarb '09 scored off a rebound with 18 minutes remaining in the first half to give Davidson the initial advantage. Himmelfarb was named to the All-NorPac Second Team. Erin Murphy tied the game for Longwood in the 42nd minute before Eleanor Cowley '08 scored seven minutes later off a penalty corner. Himmelfarb and Catherine Ransone '08 made the assist on the play. Answering Carla Binnewies’ equalizer for the Lancers two minutes before, Ransone gave the Wildcats the lead in the 53rd minute. Kayli Maxwell '08, who was named the NorPac Player of the Year after a season in which she set the Davidson career records for points, goals, and assists, added another goal on a breakaway with 28 seconds remaining.

“Today was a total team effort,” coach Ginny Sutton said. “It was an intense 70 minutes. We played with a lot of confidence, and it showed with how well we moved the ball. Scoring the first goal gave us the momentum, and we played well enough to win. It was a great win for our team.”

Christa Goeke '10, an All-NorPac First Team Selection, made eight saves for Davidson. The Wildcats outshot the Lancers 18-14, while Longwood owned an 11-10 advantage in penalty corners.

Davidson’s dreams of a conference title were dashed the following day, however, as the team fell to the top-seeded California Golden Bears 5-0. Cal’s Jennifer Crane had two goals to lead the winning effort. Christina McGrath, Kellie York, and Gwen Belomy also scored. Goeke made 12 saves for Davidson, while her opponent in goal, Kelly Knoche, made five. Davidson was outshot 28-5 and suffered through an 11-3 disparity in penalty corners.

The Wildcats' season ended in another defeat. This time the team fell 2-0 to Radford in the third-place game. Megan Longtain scored for the Highlanders only 3:25 into the game after deflecting teammate Emily Jones’ shot. Jones scored a goal herself in the 52nd minute to account for the final margin. Goeke made eight stops and Jennifer Wisniewski made eight saves for Radford. Davidson outshot the Highlanders 17-14, but, “we just couldn’t find the back of the goal,” as Maxwell explained. Both teams had seven penalty corners.

The Wildcats ended their season 10-10, 3-3 NorPac. The .500 record is Davidson’s best since 1999, when the Wildcats went 11-7. In addition to Maxwell’s honors, Jen Willis '08 was named the NorPac Defensive Player of the Year. The Wildcats hope to continue to ride their momentum into the coming season.

The Davidson volleyball team could not secure a win this week, dropping a match 2-3 against Elon and another one 0-3 against UNC Greensboro. Katie Pierucci '08 and Sarabeth Peele '11 both exhibited their offensiveprowess against Elon, hitting 24 and 23 kills respectively. Unfortunately, their great performances could not defeat the Phoenix. The first game began with Davidson building an eight-point lead, but Elon turned the tide with a 9-4 run. The game was hotly contested, but an Elon kill and an ace sealed the first chapter 30-28. Despite an early 18-13 lead, the second game was lost 39-37. In the third game, Davidson defeated the Phoenix on the back of four service points by Pierucci. Similarly, the Wildcats secured the game four win 32-30 with the help of a Pierucci run. Game five got away from the 'Cats early on, as Elon made a 7-2 run. The 'Cats could not recover, losing 15-9 in the deciding game.

The match against UNC Greensboro proved more one-sided. The 'Cats fought hard in game one, tying the score at 21-21. From there, the Spartans took control and clinched the game 30-24. The second game started in nearly the same way, as the 'Cats trailed just 15-13. However, the margin quickly grew, and the Spartans won game two 30-22. The final game proved no different. Although the 'Cats struggled and even held a lead at 27-22, five straight service points and two concluding kills ended the match with a 30-28 win. The team will try to get back on track Friday at Appalachian State and Sunday at home against Georgia Southern.
