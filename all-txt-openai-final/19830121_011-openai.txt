#### Posturepedic Suburban Nightmare

**Poltergeist (1982)**  
Directed by Tobe Hooper. Screenplay by Steven Spielberg. Starring Craig Nelson, JoBeth Williams, Beatrice Straight, Dominique Dunne, Michael Grais, Mark Victor, Oliver Robins, Heather O’Roarke, and Zelda Rubenstein. 114 min. Rating: ★★★★

"Poltergeist" raises the question of subject matter. Is the film a ghost story or a celebration of special effects? It is both, plus a little more. "Poltergeist" seems at times to be a feature-length version of the last ten minutes of "Raiders of the Lost Ark," and it is great fun. Directed by Tobe Hooper ("Texas Chainsaw Massacre") but inevitably bearing the Spielberg stamp, "Poltergeist" succeeds not because the audience believes in the cosmic goings-on, but because the film believes in itself.

Suburban life is literally raised out of its foundations when a little girl from down the street (played by 7-year-old Heather O’Roarke) finds that she can talk to the TV and it will talk back. The opening scene is perhaps the eeriest in the movie: Heather sits in front of the glowing, static-filled television whispering “Hellooo!” On one level, "Poltergeist" is a spooky, entertaining time filler, but on another, the film comments eloquently on the establishment in which we have trapped ourselves. As more and more creatures erupt from the house, we ask, “Will they survive?” From this question, "Poltergeist" derives most of its interest.

And the film is hilarious. My favorite scene occurs when Dad (played cynically by Craig Nelson) and his band of football fans become hypnotized by their own poltergeist—a Rams game. When a neighbor’s transmission of “Mister Rogers” interrupts the game, a remote control battle reminiscent of "Star Wars" takes place. This funny, satirical gag shows the fighting (and frightening) individual in each of us.

JoBeth Williams as Mom is particularly effective. Equally memorable is Zelda Rubenstein as the munchkin ghostbuster, a character that will surely go in the movie hall of fame as most unusual. "Poltergeist’s" ending works too. Just when the audience thinks the movie is over, Spielberg decides to go for one more rollercoaster ride.

In spite of the competent characterizations, the special effects are the real star of the film. The poltergeists glow, scream, and most of all, are alive—pulsating organisms that control and destroy. Industrial Light and Magic, George Lucas’s special effects company, went all the way with "Poltergeist" and will easily net the best special effects award in April.

"Poltergeist’s" conclusion makes the film truly scary, however. After escaping all the delightfully horrible creatures, one almost expects the family to run off into the country, free from society’s system. But they aren’t; they’re still trapped in the suburbs—the real poltergeist. Now that’s scary.

No WC Fields. Maybe we'll go to Altoona.

#### Chic Cheekiness

**The Philadelphia Story (1940)**  
Directed by George Cukor. Based on the Philip Barry play. Starring Cary Grant, Katharine Hepburn, James Stewart, Ruth Hussey, John Howard, Roland Young, and Henry Daniell. 112 min. Rating: ★★★★

In the 1930s and ’40s, Cary Grant, James Stewart, Katharine Hepburn, and George Cukor made some of the best comedies ever. With these powerhouses combined, "The Philadelphia Story" ranks as one of the greatest comedies ever. While it is a talky film, the talk is brilliantly funny.

The plot concerns a society girl (Katharine Hepburn in her younger, less pretentious days) who wants more than anything to have a down-to-earth romance. The man to fill the bill (James Stewart in a genuinely offbeat characterization) is ready to accommodate, but the girl’s high-class ex-husband (the chic-as-ever Cary Grant) poses some problems. "The Philadelphia Story" won loads of Academy Awards, including Stewart for Best Actor. "The Philadelphia Story" stands as part of a vanished genre, and it is a delight. Don’t miss it.

**The Ox-Bow Incident (1943)**  
Directed by William Wyler. Screenplay by Dudley Nichols, based on the novel by Walter Van Tilburg Clark. Starring Henry Fonda, Dana Andrews, Mary Beth Hughes, Anthony Quinn, Jane Darwell, Frank Conroy, and Harry Davenport. Rating: ★★★★

Okay. By now you're probably getting sick of hearing about how wonderful the films on Tuesday night are, but I’m sorry. That’s just the way it is. The classiest act of the week is once again brought to you courtesy of Dr. Engell’s film class. "The Ox-Bow Incident" is a compelling, moving film with a message, one of the all-time greats.

The plot centers around the ironies and shameful tragedies which abound during a lynching. Director Wyler pulls no punches here, and he drives his point home. Henry Fonda gives perhaps the performance of his career as a cowboy with a conscience, and Dudley Nichols’ script is terrific. At 75 minutes, "The Ox-Bow Incident" moves like lightning and is one of those rare movies that is actually better than the book. See this movie—it’s great, and it’s free. Who could ask for more?

Ox-Bow, Ox-Bow.
