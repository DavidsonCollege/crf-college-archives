**Hunt gives the “uplifting” lyricists high marks despite the short album**

Coldplay is the latest in a string of Brit bands to hit the shores of the US of A. The London-based group’s debut album, *Parachutes*, has taken Britain by storm, and a mini-US tour sold out at all ten locations.

You may have heard their single "Yellow" on the radio already. But here’s the real question: is their music worth your time and valuable money? My answer is: most definitely. This is one of the better records to come out of England in the past two years.

The tunes are bewitchingly simple and beautiful. Coupled with Scotland’s Travis, Coldplay seems to be tapping into a different kind of Brit-pop/rock. Most of the songs are mellow and chill, guided by lead singer Chris Martin’s effortless switching between his normal range and falsetto.

The whole attitude of the album is one of uplifting melancholy. It’s an interesting combination: the music lulls you into a sense of quiet calm while the lyrics are full of hope. The album begins:

“And we live in a beautiful world, Yeah we do, yeah we do, We live in a beautiful world. Oh, all that I know, There’s nothing here to run from, Cos yeah, everybody here’s got somebody to lean on.” (“Don’t Panic”)

...And then the final hidden track “Life is For Living”:

“As my head just aches, When I think of, The things that I shouldn’t have done. But, life is for living, We all know, And I don’t wanna live it alone.”

Nothing earth-shattering or deeply profound (at least on the surface) but when coupled with their tinkling pianos and dreamy guitars, you’re willing to believe them.

So is there anything wrong with *Parachutes*? Yes - it’s too short. Admittedly, this is a personal pet peeve, but it is especially frustrating when given such a promising glimpse of musical skills.

Why do bands and/or record labels think that a record is complete after 40 minutes or 10 tracks of music? I’m not asking for a double-album, but it seems artistically limiting to operate within these parameters. This is the only problem I have with the record.

Otherwise, it’s a fantastic piece of work. Every song is solid and well-written. Check it out as soon as you have the chance.

**Rating: 4 turntables (out of 5)**

Coldplay crossed the Atlantic recently for a ten-stop mini-tour. All of the British rockers’ concerts in the United States sold out.

**Bellacino’s... a spot for bellahs and boys!**

**By Jenn Butler Staff Writer**

When I was asked to review Bellacino’s for *The Davidsonian* I knew it wasn’t going to be a problem. I have eaten at this tasty little pizza and grinder shop more times than I should admit.

For those of you that have never stopped at this cute restaurant, it is located just down the road in Cornelius, next to the Food Lion. Bellacino’s has a relaxed atmosphere, and is an informal spot that offers more variety than the typical fare of Subway or Domino’s.

My chosen poison at Bellacino’s is always one of their warm grinders. These sub sandwiches are different than Subway because they are served warm, and the bread is always toasty and fresh! All of my friends have a different grinder that is their favorite, but I’m partial to the Veggie Sub and the Grilled Chicken Sub.

For those of you who like full-fat meals, there are sandwiches with mayo, cheese, and the works; but for those of you who are trying to eat right, Bellacino’s offers healthier sandwiches that have low-fat cheese and mayonnaise. Other sandwiches you might want to try at Bellacino’s are the pizza sub, the taco sub, the BLT, and the turkey sub.

Besides having a variety of sandwiches, Bellacino’s serves many pizzas and salads. I have heard good things about both... although I have never tasted them myself. When it comes to pizza I prefer the Brooklyn South. It’s the best pizza I’ve had since I ventured my northern self down past the Mason-Dixon line.

I would recommend Bellacino’s as a quick and light option when you are in the mood for subs and pizza. This restaurant also delivers, which is always convenient. If you aren’t in the mood to walk to Bellacino’s on the weekends, they can get the food to you!
