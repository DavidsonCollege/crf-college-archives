Students make their mark on construction

**Press RELEASE**

Students and Faculty in the music department traded in their instruments and songbooks for rollers and paintbrushes on Oct. 18, to make their mark on the construction fence surrounding what will soon become the department’s new home.

The Grey Building, which has served as the college library and more recently as the college union, is currently undergoing remodeling in preparation for another incarnation as the music program’s main facility.

In celebration of the building project, members of the music faculty came up with the idea of painting a mural on the north wall of the construction fence to relate it to the meaning of the building which it surrounds. Associate Professor Jennifer Stasack came up with a design for the mural that would allow for individual creativity within a unified pattern.

Once the pattern and the background colors were in place, student and faculty musicians added their own personal touches, ranging from pictures of instruments and favorite pieces of music, to portraits of composers and representations of what each muralist enjoyed about music.

Students paint the fence surrounding the Grey Building, which is currently being renovated to serve as the school’s music building.
