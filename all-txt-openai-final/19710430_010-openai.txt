### ROTC Students Form Ranger Oriented Group

By ROBERT TOUCHTON, Asst. Managing Editor

About 20 ROTC students are giving up free time and weekends to participate in a new group called the Davidson Ranger-Oriented Combat Soldiers (ROCS). Junior Scott McMichael, the commanding officer of the group, said that the purpose of the ROCS is to “study and acquire skills and techniques of field tactics.” Study is concentrated in the area of guerilla warfare—ambushes, escapes, and invasions.

The group meets once a week on Tuesday night to study field tactics. Recently the students have put what they have learned to practical use in dummy drills. The idea for ROCS was developed shortly after Christmas by Capt. Theodore R. Severn of the ROTC Department. Severn talked to his MS-I (freshman) classes about his idea, and it caught on with several freshmen. Four juniors, including McMichael, heard about the plan and involved themselves with it, as did several sophomores.

The group was finally organized in late March, when leaders were named and two groups formed. Freshmen Brad Long and Tom Traxler are leaders of the two groups. The group is “strictly voluntary” according to McMichael, who said, “We plan to be a separate part of the ROTC Department.”Next year, with our own drill and classes. McMichael said that the group hoped to develop skills that would be advantageous to a person during his time in military service. Bill Emerson, who was editor of the now-defunct Saturday Evening Post when the magazine collapsed, will also speak that morning. Dr. Paul Crane, a medical missionary to Korea, is scheduled to conduct the Sunday morning worship service in the Presbyterian Church. According to Zackery F. Long, assistant director of alumni affairs, "If the weekend is to be a complete success, then it is essential that students take part in the festivities. Alumni are interested in what students at Davidson are thinking today, and it is important that students and alumni become involved in discussions about Davidson." Long pointed to several activities which have been planned to make such dialogue between students and alumni possible. On Saturday morning, "capsule courses," the college’s answer to a continuing education program, are planned, with students invited to attend. Also, there will be an alumni reception for the senior class following the alumni-varsity football game, and on Saturday night Your Father's Moustache will be in concert for the whole college community.

To add something of South Asia studies to their curricula since their faculty members will also be involved in the experience. The seminar will begin with an intensive two-week orientation program on India at Davidson. On July 11, the group will leave the United States and stop briefly in Istanbul. While in India, the seminar will center in Delhi with trips to Chandigarh, Agra, Banaras, Calcutta, and Darjeeling, a hill town in the Himalayas. The group will also visit a small village in South India for a few days as guests of Monroe Gilmour, a Peace Corps volunteer who graduated from Davidson in 1968 and is the son of a Charlotte physician. There will also be stops at Bangkok, Hong Kong, Taipei, and Tokyo before they return to the United States on September 1. Davidson faculty members participating in the seminar will be: Thomas F. Clark and Samuel D. Maloney, religion department; C. Earl Edmondson, history; James M. Frederickson, chemistry; Dirk French, classics; John D. Kelton, psychology; Randall Kincaid, Jr., and Ernest F. Patterson, economics; Winfred P. Minter, political science; Paul Fisher, German, coordinator of Davidson's junior year abroad programs; and Frederick H. Gaige.
