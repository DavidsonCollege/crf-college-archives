From the President

Welcome to Homecoming. In 1923—twenty-five years ago—Davidson had her first Homecoming. During this quarter of a century, thousands of Alumni and friends have come again and again to renew their acquaintance and to get the healing touch of this blessed spot. To those of us who live and work at Davidson, Homecoming is a time of great delight and encouragement. For the students, it is a gala occasion when the social functions are at their best, the football game elicits unusual interest, and many parents and friends assemble in a joyous reunion. To this Homecoming, we welcome all who come to share the occasion with us. It is a unique celebration. To the ordinary festivities, we have added the features of the Cornerstone Convocation. We believe it is a time when there is a stirring in the hearts of Davidson’s Alumni and friends all over the country. As we lay the cornerstone to a building which we long have needed and which now promises to grow into a thing of beauty and usefulness, we are thinking of the laying even more firmly and securely of the cornerstone of the entire success of Davidson College as a really great liberal arts institution, training young men in the essential qualities of the Christian character. So, to all who are with us as friends and guests at this Homecoming season—and we anticipate that number will exceed any previous year—we extend the traditional friendly hospitality of Davidson and ensure everyone of our heartiest greetings.

—J. R. CUNNINGHAM.

Brave Men

Three or even two years ago, an English professor thumbing through a stack of freshman themes would have been amazed, to say the least, to come across such a title as “On the Birth of My Son.” Today the “Cardboard Village” is an established and well-nigh forgotten phase of Davidson life. Because the boys who live there eat and study at home, we don’t see as much of them as we would like to, and consequently we don’t hear much about life in the “village.” However, we take our hats off to any man who has enough regard for education to bring a wife and family to college with him. Two cannot, as a matter of fact, live as cheaply as one; there are financial difficulties to be met and solved. Then, too, family life is not the most conducive to good study habits; there are undoubtedly times when the baby is sick and having a bad night with reviews coming up the next day.

Witness the laying of a cornerstone for our future. The cornerstone of two and a half million dollars worth of new buildings will be laid. Homecomings will also drive financial backing for Davidson that is being launched today will determine the spirit of Homecomings for years to come. The success of this drive that is being started will go a long way towards fixing Davidson's place in the future. If she gets the money and makes the proposed improvements, there is nothing to stop her from maintaining her leading position. If the improvements are not made, chances are that among schools of our type and size, Davidson may drop into a secondary position and cease to be the object of such intense pride as she is to so many of our alumni today.

In addition to the gymnasium, other needs that will be met by this new fund will be the building of a new church, a new dormitory, a student union, and an increase in the endowment to take care of upkeep on the new buildings. The new church has long been a consideration with the administration. While the old church claims a warm spot of reverence and love in all our hearts, it is neither adequate for the needs of the congregation nor the prestige of the campus. It is hoped that a fine new church may be built and placed as a fourth side in the restoration of the old quadrangle. A new dormitory is needed. Rumple is hardly fit to live in and the rooms of the other dormitories are housing three men where they were designed for two. Even when the student body will have been reduced in numbers to a more acceptable size, there will be need of more dormitory space. Another is the erection of a Student Union on the favorite dream of the college spot where the old gym now stands. A union is needed as a recreational center on the campus for students, a new home for a better-equipped student store, and a suitable meeting place for our honorary fraternity groups. Phi and Eu Halls have just been done over so that they can serve this latter purpose temporarily, but they will not be entirely adequate.

The student body is already behind the drive. They realize that they are in possibly the best position to know just how much Davidson needs and deserves the support of all her friends in the drive. They realize that, as students, they are the best salesmen of the drive and they are out to do their part. It is the hope of the entire college that two cornerstones have been given firm foundations today.

There are other difficulties involved. Managing Editor Rae Hang, which he attacked vehemently, and of Federal income. Therefore, if taxes are to be cut, and vast amounts of money are at the same time to be spent, Dewey must plan to cut drastically the expenditures of the Government in some channel.

Managing Editor Day ison, like most places we seem to hear repeatedly, his attacks brought two results: one, that only a minority of his own party in Congress supported the Taft-Hartley Bill on the floor and finally voted in favor of it; and second, that McPromrat never spent any single point in the Act which would lead to his second promise: to “unsnarl, unravel, and untangle” the machinery of government in Washington. Our main questions his ability to accomplish such an enormous task. As Kent points out, Huffaker, Lewis Hyman, Frank Winston, and Bill Neal, Millage. To you and yours, he advocates cleaning up corruption and dust of previous administration, and replacing it with men whom he knows and trusts. But with time the very rights era is probably the most explosive and contentious issue more than any other one point brought about Truman’s downfall. It split his party wide open and engendered a movement which has led to the Democratic loss of the South for the first time in eighty years.

This year’s Homecoming, the twenty-fifth for the college, promises to be the biggest one in its history to date. More planning has gone into the event this year than in a combination of former years. Matters of great importance that will be looked back on in future years will happen thick and fast this week-end. On the campus this week-end are more of Davidson’s friends and alumni than have assembled here since the Centennial Celebration more than ten years ago. And, as always, they are welcome to the campus and to whatever facilities not only the administration can provide for them, but also the students.

We take this opportunity to add the Student Body word of welcome to all visitors. This Homecoming week-end, known as the Cornerstone Convocation, will not only bring tales of their wonderful experiences up at Salem this past week-end. Brother Rod Shaw says that he didn’t starve over the week-end, but, on the contrary, he became a successful bum in the other frat’s boarding houses. Brother J. D. Ashmore grueling over the medical exam all day Saturday, reports that Brother Cam Faison needs some help down at the house to decorate for Homecoming. Brother Meatball Gambrell promises a bigger and better Scripts and Pranks Magazine this fall. It will feature, by the way, an exceptionally well-written article by our esteemed Brother Dick Richards. Brother Bill Higgins, our representative to the Pan-Hellenic Council, has the dance tickets and urges all to get their money in as soon as possible.

Ballenger is just one jump away from attaining membership in the Sigma Delta Psi Athletic Fraternity. If he gets this honor, he will be the first in a long time to hold it. We saw Brother John Cod walking the Queen City streets in his glad rags Halloween Eve. I wonder if he found what he was looking for? Also, Brother Lane Cloaninger and Clara were out spooking. Sure was glad to see the football back in the winning column as of last week when they beat the Phi Gams 24 to 0. Brother “Lightfoot” Crosby and the “touchdown coordinators, J.C. Roberts and Monty Hill were really on the ball. Everyone’s skill will be severely tested against the Kappa Sigmas this Monday afternoon. I think that Bob Miller, Lane Cloaninger, and Bob McGehee will put up more than the Sigma’s bargain for, but the outcome remains to be seen. New arrangements of tables at the boarding house seem to suit the waiters fine. All the brothers are reminded that the floor will only be as clean for Homecoming and wants to attain those shallow cheeks like Brother Cunnie Cunningham has. We saw “I run it in 10.3” Jenkins cutting paper dolls the other day—he has them on his wall. Brother Bailey has turned into a tough guy with a water-cooled hand machine gun. Also in the gang was “Baby Face” Chandler and “Dillinger” Erwin. I hope you didn’t miss seeing Georgia Southern Carnegie in the Foolies Preview. He was great. That’s about all this rat can find to gnaw on this week, but will look forward to some mighty fine cheese this week-end.

SIGMA CHI: Many of the Sigma Chi brothers had comparatively mild week-ends (they were saving their strength for Homecoming) but an untiring minority managed to uphold the grand traditions of the rotators. Among these were Speedy Look.
