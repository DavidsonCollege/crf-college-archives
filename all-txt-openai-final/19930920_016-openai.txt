16 THE DAVIDSONIAN

JV adds to soccer program
By M.C. Spear

Four years ago, Charlie Slagle encountered an unfamiliar, yet positive issue. There was a growing surplus of men’s soccer talent
and interest on our campus. Hence, the formation of the JV program. The purpose of the team is to provide
a competitive arena for incoming freshmen and rising sophomores to sharpen their skills and raise the level of their own
game to that of NCAA Division I status. Providing actual game-playing experience is the foremost component of any athlete’s development.

Davidson is unique in that most big-time soccer programs carry large thirty-men rosters where many highly talented players “ride the
pine” for a better part of their college careers. Slagle’s varsity program has benefited greatly. Over one-third of his players
are former JV players who have earned varsity status.

The 1993 JV squad is clearly the most talented ever, thus proving that the level of soccer talent and interest
is only growing at Davidson. The team has opened with three impressive wins. Crushing victories include 6-2 over Brevard, 4-1
over Andrew, and 4-0 over Anderson. All of these schools are powerful Junior College programs.

Come out and watch this exciting team perform and learn how Davidson College is becoming the soccer capital of the
country.

The Davidson JV soccer team scrambles for the loose ball in Saturday's 4-1 victory over Anderson Junior College, one of
the premier Juco teams in the country.

Cats get first victory at home

Rhodes quarterback Joe Welborn all game. Sophomore Bo Bartholomew made a spectacular hit when he broke through Rhodes’ offensive line
and sacked Welborn. Senior John Dalton’s presence was felt all over the field. He led the Wildcats with nine tackles.
Davidson had only one major mistake on defense. Rhodes wide receiver Justin Ross was able to slip through the Cats
secondary and catch a 37-yard touchdown pass.

Davidson was extremely pleased with their performance on Saturday. They proved to be effective on offense and defense. Davidson scored
on six of their seven times inside the Rhodes 20-yard line. Last week, the Wildcats had trouble when close to
the end zone and only produced three points in a 7-3 loss to Sewanee. They solved this problem, however, and
tallied six touchdowns against Rhodes.

Davidson’s schedule will be fairly hard for the next couple of weeks. They play three successive road games against Emory
and Henry, Guilford, and Washington & Lee. They return home for games on the last three weekends of October.

tournament play. The team will play tough tournaments at Washington and Lee and South Carolina later this fall. “The tournaments
are a good way to feel out the competition for the spring season. There isn’t as much pressure in Tennessee
State as the major obstacles to overcome. “We should be competitive. We lost three of the top six, but we
have eight seniors on the team who give us a good core,” saidPlott. The addition of three strong freshmen will
benefit the team as well. In addition to Parham and Mackelcan, David Coykendall is a newcomer to the team.

Once again, the team will be a contender for the Southern Conference title, with Furman and East Tennessee as their
main competition. "As long as there is conference play," said Plott.

The Washington and Lee Invitational is next for the team on October 9-10.

New coaches to lead SWIMMING and diving
By Will Cobb

The 1993 Davidson swimming and diving program brings many new faces, both in coaching and players. The new head coach
is Richard DeSelm, the former head coach at UNC-Chapel Hill from 1984-92. DeSelm brings a great deal to the program.
Originally from Knoxville, TN, he graduated from UNC in 1978 and became a coach immediately following his graduation. He comes
here to accept the challenge of building a program at an institution committed to academics. His main objective is to
send competitors to the NCAA championships. Though this will take time, he is committed to stay here until this goal
is achieved. This year he would like to build a foundation by establishing a strong recruiting base and work with
those swimmers and divers presently at Davidson.

Now in the fourth year of the rejuvenated program, Davidson appears to be in the right direction. DeSelm brings with
him a new crew of assistants. They are Chip Lavender, a '91 graduate of UNC, and Marcia Waymouth, a '77
graduate of Indiana University, who will coach divers. Ron Morrow, now the Director of Physical Education, will remain involved in
the transition, spending time with the team at home and on the road.

More than half of this year's team are freshmen and sophomores. With Davidson’s small size, it is difficult to compete
with other Division I schools. DeSelm hopes to "try to present Davidson as a unique niche for students who want
a great education at a small school which has made a commitment to swimming and diving." Hopefully, the location will
help present this idea. This year’s captains will be Dan Bahmiller, Morgan Ferrell, and Jenny Garciga. The first home meet
will be against Florida A&M on October 23rd.
