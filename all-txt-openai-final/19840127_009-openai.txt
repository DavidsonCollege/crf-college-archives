Hissam Contends For Southern Conference Crown

By KERRY BROWN

The key to improvement for a college wrestling team is experience, and without experience, talented young wrestling squads (such as
this year’s Davidson Wildcats) usually have bad seasons. But the young ‘Cats are not all toddlers. The Wildcats have seniors
Tom Hissam, John Breidenstine, and junior Mike Keeley returning to the squad, and this talented trio will be joined by
Tom Cardwell, Mike Adams, John Lay, and Rod Duffee. With the leadership provided by the senior-junior triumvirate, the ‘Cats have
a good chance for the NAIA District 26 Championship.

Tom Hissam, a 177-pound senior, is Davidson's Hercules in wrestling shoes. Last year Hissam was 25-4-1, had 14 reversals (a
team high), and 11 decisions towards his team-high record. Hissam’s strength and experience put him in contention for the Southern
Conference 177-pound crown during the 1984 season.

While Hissam provides strength and experience to the squad, his peer John Breidenstine is Mr. Finesse for the young and
victory-starved Wildcats. Breidenstine led the team in escapes (28) and in pins (8) in 1983. During a dual wrestling contest
against Furman and Catawba, Breidenstine easily defeated both his opponents. Mike Keeley, a tough competitor, saw his 1983 wrestling season
ruined by a knee injury, but Keeley has obviously recovered because, in the Catawba-Furman dual contest, Keeley massacred both his
opponents.

Hissam, Breidenstine, and Keeley will have to be at their best for the 1984 wrestling season if the Wildcats are
to claw their way past the 7-8 record of 1983.

The Cats also have good young talent to complement the experience of the upperclass triumvirate of Hissam-Keeley-Breidenstine. Returning sophomore Tom
Cardwell has 21 matches under his belt, and hopefully he, Mike Adams, Rod Duffee, and Tom Cardwell will be able
to combine to provide enough victories for a winning season. Rod Duffee corralled an opponent in 3:56 during a dual
contest between Furman and Catawba, and Mike Adams disposed of Furman opponent Harrington Witherspoon for a key victory against Furman.
