THE DAVIDSONIAN, OCTOBER 13, 1921

THE PEANUT PARCHER

A young man named Corporal Hughes
Had trouble finding his shoes.
He lost them one night
When he turned out the light
But he found 'em by the use of his nose.

A fresh by the name of McIver
Went to bed with a very hot fever.
His nurse was a beaut
And he thought she was cute
Then he couldn't make his mind up to leave her.

Young Mallory is somewhat the cheese
He has all the girls on their knees.
He plays with them all
And each seems to fall.
Say! ain't they easy to please.

Sure I love the dear poney that passes me through
And the Jack that spotted up too,
I'll give the dear spots so well known to another,
And surely I hope it will be to my brother.—R. M. Carr.

An Ad. Pictures Just Released—Blue Sunday Corporation.
“The Garlic Crop in Mesopotamia.”

Chemical Explosion.
Cantrell—“Say did you hear that explosion over in lab this morning?”
Byerly—"No, what happened?”
Cantrell—"A Freshman blew his nose.”

WIRELESS STATION PROVES INTERESTING AND HELPFUL

The Davidsonian now has a rival for the “rep” of being the livest wire on the hill. This rival has its headquarters on the third floor of Chambers and consists of various and divers instruments entangled with so many wires that those seeing it for the first time think immediately of a page from Dr. Harding's Greek. However, to those versed in matters...

PROGRAM THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 13, 14, 15
“The Making of hair for hairpins.”
“The joy of joking.”
“The point of a joke.”
“Japanese school mumble pegs.”

The comedies are funny. The dramas are dramatic, and the tragedies are tragic.

Our co-eds are there with the stuff;
There only are not quite enough.
If we had about fifty
Our lives would be nifty
But our grades would fall down in a huff.

Snag Bailey—“Good morning, how are you feeling?”
Boushee—"Like a tailor,”
Snag—"How’s that?”
Bush—"Oh, just sew, just fine.”

McLeod, our Junior from Maxton
Has a voice that sounds like a Klaxon.
His “French” is quite queer
To the ordinary ear
So we wish he would use Anglo-Saxon.

An Actor.
Nash—"Well, Mr. Raker, what theatrical experience have you had?"
Raker—"I was in the play over at Lexington.”
Nash—“What part did you take?”
Raker—"I was the cuspidor in the second act.”

If you can find any verses like these
Hand ’em in to Mule Curry, if you please.
We admit these are rotten
But they are all we have gotten,
So help cure their author’s disease.

Another receiving set employing “honeycomb" coils for long wave reception has been installed. This receiver is capable of “tuning in” Nauen, Germany. Several other pieces of apparatus have also been installed since the last issue of The Davidsonian and we soon hope to have one of the best stations.

A Mile a Minute.
Speedy Carr says he did not get his nickname from Greek.

Where’s the Point?
Skimpton to Fresh Glenn—"What are these eight bottles of different kinds of medicine for? You are not running an Eddie Penaud, are you?”

Honor System.
On the first Math review Freshman copied the questions and put on the outside of the paper this strange device:
“As you can see, I have neither received any help nor given any,”

Foolish Question.
Knox—"Well, Bob I see you are taking it hard when leaving.”| VO'N¢ He also states that his temporary office hours are from 9 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. Bob—“No, I am going to have my picture taken and I weed,” Dedication to my little pony Paraphrase on Mother Machree: There’s a spot in my book, no flunking for me. There’s a Jack of my own, so I'm passing, you see. Messages from members of the faculty or the student body can be sent, provided there is an amateur station in the town to which they are to be sent. There will be no charge on these messages. Starving the Barbers. John Bailey—“Well, Gamble, I see you are shaving yourself,” Gamble—“No, I am looking in the mirror and there’s a barber back of my ear piloting the razor.” Belk Bros. Co. CLOTHING DEPT.
