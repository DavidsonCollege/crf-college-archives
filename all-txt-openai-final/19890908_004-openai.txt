**Upperclassmen share their lofty ideas**

By TRENT STEVENS

"The loft must be free-standing and not fastened in any way to the walls, room furniture, or ceiling. All of the loft’s weight must rest on the floor."

So reads the first of the Davidson College Residence Life Office’s guidelines on loft construction. Other variables such as materials and height are also covered.

Despite the restrictions, the diversity of Davidson’s lofts is as evident as the diversity of its students. Each individual loft is a response to a unique set of needs and limitations.

Juniors Greg Grooms and George Snead live in Sentelle 114. Certain unnamed sources referred to their loft as the worst on campus. Although Grooms disagreed, he admitted, “I wouldn’t submit it to Home and Gardens.”

“I don’t think it’s that bad. It serves its purpose...I’d say there’s got to be a worse loft on campus than ours.”

Grooms named several problems, including a stolen ladder, warped wood, a relatively small room, and labor inefficiency, all of which added up to a completion time of three days for the project. Nails eventually had to be used in the place of the more easily removable screws, and a wedge of wood was needed to keep the frame solidly in place against the wall.

However, Grooms emphasized the loft’s strengths, such as its “steel-reinforced” frame.

The builders had to take special precautions in two areas. “We tied some string on both sides to hold in the supporting beams on both the lights and the vents,” Price said, alluding to the danger posed by movement.

Burroughs. “We took it apart and put it back together.” Transferred from a room on the second floor of Belk, the loft was reassembled over the course of almost six hours with the help of more than seventy numbered screws.

With the planned addition of sturdy furniture, “this place will look like a palace,” Grooms concluded.

Belk 057 is the current residence of sophomores Ramsey Price and Chris Henderson. The construction of their loft was hampered by the low ceiling lights and tiles found in basement Belk.

They solved the problem by moving the lights and the air conditioning vents to one side of the room and by removing the panels and their supports from their positions above the loft.

The supports on the sides of the rooms had to be meticulously chiseled out to allow the opening of closet doors.

Sentelle 113 is shared by Juniors Shannon Bennett and Andy Burroughs and their split-level loft.

“We had nothing to do with building it,” asserted Burroughs. “We took it apart and put it back together.”

“We didn’t account for the height of the room and the height of the loft,” Bennett recalled. “We eventually had to saw off 11 inches off of each post.” Despite this problem, the loft stands securely. Bennett estimated that the loft’s original construction, at least two owners back, may have taken all summer.

“We got really lucky in finding this one,” added Burroughs.

The actual construction of a loft was also avoided in Belk 329, the room of sophomores Blaine John and Benjamin Gilmer.

“We bought it from a guy who was in this room last year which was just great because all the parts fit in,” John said, referring to the square-shaped loft overhead. “We had to modify it a little bit, but it fit nicely and we didn’t have to cut any wood.”

They spent about eight hours on the project, in which they stained the loft with cherry finish and created matching speaker shelves.

Other custom features include both fluorescent and track lighting -- wired to the wall light switch and located below the ceiling fixtures. Also, a retractable ladder that conserves floor space; and a set of flags that drape from the loft to form what John called a “flexible wall” between study and relaxation areas.

“Intoxication while building it was a major problem. That’s something you want to avoid,” John mused. “It was a definite problem.”

Members of the Davidson class of 1993 were well on their way to gaining the infamous “freshman 15,” despite the 1.7-mile course they ran during the annual Freshman Cake Race Thursday, August 24. The athletics department reported that 130 of the newest Davidsonians participated in the race this year, each filled with hopes of winning one of the delicious cakes which were given as prizes.

Second Little resident Ian Stewart was the big winner with a time of 8:39. Eight seconds behind him was David Kerns of Second East Belk. The first female to complete the race was Becky Hunter of Second Little.

The race, initiated in the early 1930s as a method of finding and recruiting cross-country talent for the school’s team, has since become a tradition.

Freshmen had various reasons for either taking part in or coming to watch the cake race. Laura Cunningham was even bold enough to say that she was at the race to “check out the cute freshman guys.” Although the reasons for participation were varied, the cakes themselves seemed to be the primary source of motivation for the runners.
