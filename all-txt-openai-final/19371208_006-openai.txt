1-MINUTE SAFETY TALKS

By Don Herold

We'll drive moderately, and if we have an accident, it will be a nicer one.

How to Have More Trivial Accidents

If we are going to have automobile accidents, let’s have little ones.

It is not such a serious matter when we dent a fender. What we don’t want is a skull fracture.

How shall we select for our accidents? It is much safer to have them on city streets. The death rate for accidents on highways and at rural intersections is more than 200 percent greater than on city streets.

Time plays a part, also. The death rate per accident after dark is about 60 percent worse than during daylight. May all your accidents be little ones, and they're more apt to be little if you know about and avoid these deadlier spots and practices.

A new $120,000 press was then inspected by the group. This press is capable of turning out a hundred thousand copies in an hour.

John P. White of the mechanical department conducted the tour. The section of the plant visited was the one where they prepare the distribution of the paper.

Your Film Report Card

By HENRY B. BAKER

(The following film ratings are based upon those of current magazines and the observations of the columnist. A—Excellent; B—Good; C—Fair; D—Poor.)

A “EBB TIDE”—Frances Farmer, Ray Milland, and Barry Fitzgerald.

All movie critics have praised the gorgeous scenery and romance of this picture, and the praise is truly justified. It is the first picture of the islands of the South Seas to be filmed in natural color, and it brings out more than ever the beauty of this region. The story is about a renegade seaman and his adventures on a mysterious pearl island. Something must be rather weak about this picture, however, because the ratings are rather low.

C “SOPHIE LANG GOES WEST”—Gertrude Michael, and Lee Bowman.

A conventional crook play, the third in this series of crime stories. Personally, I never heard of the first two, but if you have, you can judge this picture for yourself; it must be somewhat similar. One critic says it is not as good as the previous productions—he's probably right. The setting is Hollywood, and of course Sophie has the leading role.

B “VARSITY SHOW”—Dick Powell, Ted Healy, Fred Waring (and band), Rosemary and Priscilla Lane.

Most of the magazine critics give this a “B” but several Davidson students say it is highly over-rated. A Hollywood producer stages a college show, centered around Fred Waring’s band. He succeeds in giving the public some good musical numbers but the plot—well it’s just not “all there.”

COACHES PLAN TRIP

The transfer rule, the interpretation of which has puzzled several schools this season, will be discussed in conference games.

Resignation of the University of North Carolina’s coach has led to speculation about his successor. It is possible that a team will be chosen from this group: Presbyterian, Centre, Georgetown, Catholic U., and George Washington.

5. That the conference officially recognize a football champion and establish a minimum number of games to be played by claimant.
