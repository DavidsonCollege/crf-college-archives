Acclaimed Pianist to Perform at Davidson College

Davidson College invites the public to an Artists Series concert on Sunday, Feb. 8, by internationally renowned pianist Mia Chung. The concert begins at 8:00 p.m. in Hodson Hall of Cunningham Fine Arts Building. Tickets are $12 for adults and $8 for students and seniors.

The first half of Chung’s concert will consist of Bach’s “Goldberg Variations.” Following the intermission, she will play Chopin’s “Fantasy in F minor” and Schubert’s “Impromptu in E-flat major” and “Impromptu in G-flat major.” She will conclude with contemporary composer Lee Hyla’s 1996 work, “Riff and Transfiguration, a Suite for Piano.”

Chung was playing as a soloist with the Baltimore Symphony at age 12, and studied at Harvard and Yale before earning a doctoral degree at Juilliard. She is currently artist-in-residence and assistant professor of music at Gordon College in Massachusetts. Chung was first-prize winner of the 1993 Concert Artists Guild competition, and subsequently recorded her first CD — Beethoven’s sonatas and bagatelles. That 1995 release by Channel Classics was selected as one of the best of the year by Gramophone. The magazine wrote of her, “Chung’s performance is inspired... a totally absorbing musical experience.” She has released two more recordings since that time, one of works by Schumann and the most recent of works by Beethoven. Chung has also received the U.S. Trust Award and the Channel Classics Prize, as well as an Avery Fisher Career Grant in 1997.

A New York Times review of one of her performances called her performance “(u)ncommonly insightful, individualistic and lively... Vividly characterized and full of dynamic subtleties... Her playing was dazzling.” The Boston Globe’s music critic wrote, “She plays the hardest music there is with a degree of intelligence and musical sophistication that is rare.”

Chung has given recitals in major concert halls around the world and played concerto appearances with the Baltimore Symphony and the National Symphony. She has served as resident artist of National Public Radio’s “Performance Today,” as well as “Artist-in-Radio” at WCRB in Boston and WGMS in Washington, D.C.

Davidson’s Concert Series was created through an endowment established by First Charter National Bank in honor of the Coltrane family. It is funded by the endowment, the music department, and the College Union. Additional support is provided by the Friends of the Arts at Davidson, and Classical 89.9 WDAV radio is providing media sponsorship. For more information on the concert, call the music department at 892-2357.

First, we would like to say that the FLAG Fashion Show was lots of fun. Also, we appreciated the attendance and enthusiasm of the student body, which demonstrates that Davidson College is becoming a more open and tolerant institution. For those of you who attended the Fashion Show, you will remember the four people who were painted blue. They wrote a poem that we would like to share:

We use blue paint to enable you to see the shapes, curves, and lines of the body. Bodies are different. Bodies are smooth, skinny, fat, muscular, hairy, tall, short, andIt is this combination that is the true beauty. People are different. People are conservative, straight, gay, academic, radical, creative, spiritual, and it is this combination that makes beauty. We are presenting ourselves to you; this is honest, it’s not a game. This is coming out. FLAG is an appreciation of the differences that we are. We’re not just our characteristics and looks; our characteristics and looks are us.
