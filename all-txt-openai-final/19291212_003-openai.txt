THE DAVIDSONIAN, DECEMBER 12, 1929

Side Line Shots
By P. R. Alderman

There are many All-State teams picked by all sorts of people on one basis or another according to their particular fancy. Some men are chosen for flashes of brilliant play throughout the season while others are picked for consistent playing; some for outstanding work in several phases of the game, others for superiority in one department, etc. Needless to say, prejudice plays its part in naming these teams also. On the team named by the writer in the latter part of this column there will undoubtedly be names that will probably not appear on other All-State squads, but originality counts—unless it’s too original. And indeed, there have been some very original choices in the papers the past few days; in fact, almost freakish ones.

As far as the pivot position is concerned there is very little to say in favor of any candidate but Lipscomb of Carolina. He has ably taken the place of the Tar Heels’ outstanding center of last year—Schwartz. Of four men eligible for one of the flanks, Jordan, Holt, Fenner and Warren, the latter would be my choice. He has been handicapped this year by playing on a losing eleven but was one of the best in the State. There is something radically wrong with the All-State team that leaves Captain Brock of Davidson off of it. Either somebody failed to read the newspapers or else didn’t see this stellar flankman perform. Otherwise, his failure to place on an All-State pick can only show unusually poor football judgment, or any kind, as far as that goes.

Koenig of Carolina is the best tackle in the state with Williams of Wake Forest having the edge on Kistler of Duke and Lepo of State for the other tackle. Farris, Carolina’s All-American candidate, was not his best this year but is easily All-State, while the consistent work of DeCamp of Davidson entitled him to the other guard. “Shorty” Branch of the Tar Heels gets quarter without much dispute. His playing was outstanding. Joe McCall, high-scorer for the Wildcats did some of the most spectacular broken-field running seen in the state this year, while Buie, Duke’s sensational passer, was probably their mainstay. Magner, one of Carolina’s Hundred Backs, gets the Fullback position. Williams of Elon also deserves honorable mention.

Following is the position and school of the players:

Position Player School
Center Lipscomb, Carolina
End Brock, Davidson
End Warren, Duke
Tackle Koenig, Carolina
Tackle Williams, Wake Forest
Guard DeCamp, Davidson
Guard Farris, Carolina
Quarter Branch, Carolina
Halfback Buie, Duke
Halfback McCall, Davidson
Fullback Magner, Carolina

Four Regulars and Strong Freshmen of Last Year Report for First Practice

With the Duke game and the 1929 grid season now in the realm of history, the eyes of all are focused on the coming cage season, preparation for which has already been started by candidates under the supervision of Coach "Red" Laird for the present. The latter will have charge of varsity practice until it is turned over to Coach “Monk” in the near future.

The first call for varsity prospects found only one regular missing from last year's quintet—Calhoun, whose shoes will be hard to fill although there will be strong bidders for his vacancy. A veteran on last year’s team, his work was a consistent and important factor in the successes of the season. In view of the potential reserves of a strong Fresh team of last year, every indication points to a wealth of material on which to build a quintet that will make a strong bid for state championship honors in the race against other state contenders.

Captain Johnston, Pritchett, Rusk, and Goodson are regulars who will defend their positions against about a score of other aspirants to regular berths on the quintet. The first game on the schedule will be more of the nature of a practice tilt than anything else, when the Catawba College squad will be met here on the night of December 17th. While definite predictions can be made on the basis of the “Cats’” work in this contest, it will, nevertheless, afford an opportunity to make a brief survey and estimate of their power and what the future holds for them. More important games will be announced in a schedule to be published in a later edition.

Forty Freshmen Report To Basketball Practice

When Coach “Red” Laird issued the call for freshmen basketball aspirants, approximately forty men answered his call, assuring him a wealth of material as the season draws near. Due to the unwieldiness of this large squad he was forced to divide it in half, with practices at different times. Coach Laird plans to keep both these squads working until the Christmas holidays before cutting either one, assuring each candidate ample time to prove his worth. Conditioning exercises and simple passing and shooting plays are the order of the day, closing the practice with foul or free-throw practice. Several former high and prep school stars are showing up well, and there will be a close fight for every position on the team.

After several days of practice, Coach Laird has picked two squads, the decision resting on their work so far. The following men make up the first squad at present: Pierce, Fleagle, Manson, Wagner, Pearce, Thomason, Baughn, Creech, Mills, Peabody, Clark, Myers, Bettis, Bernard, Boucher, Rogers, Steel, Enochs, Coble, and Hartsell.
