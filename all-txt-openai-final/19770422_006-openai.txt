**Barnett’s view evokes response**

To the Editor:

This letter is in response to Bill Barnett’s article of April 15th and the recent Patterson Court Council's decision to reinstate the bidding system at Davidson. The Council’s decision appears to support Mr. Barnett’s claim that bidding “might be just the right solution to cure the divisiveness in the Davidson social system,” but I assert that the Council's decision is not representative of the court’s true feelings (example of PAX and EIC, surprising affirmative votes and the house members' subsequent disapproval), and I propose a campus-wide referendum on Mr. Barnett’s proposal for a bidding/self-selection system at Davidson.

If indeed the majority of Davidson students vote for such a revised system, then it should be planned for and carried out. If, however, the bidding system does not carry a majority of the student vote, then the court should remain with its present (although, granted, largely abused) set of laws. I question Mr. Barnett’s reasoning concerning the conciliatory effects of a bidding/self-selection procedure on the court, and I wonder at his (and the national fraternities’) desire for such a system.

As things stand now, the national fraternities admittedly discriminate against women. Next year women at Davidson will attempt to turn two wrongs into a right by discriminating against men. I doubt, however, that either the national fraternities or women at Davidson would publicly admit to discriminating on bases other than sex. Every fraternity has its share of misfits—those who get in through self-selection despite pressure against them by their chosen fraternity. In Mr. Barnett’s system, the fraternities will be able to publicly discriminate—picking and choosing on such bases as looks, popularity, strength, etc., deciding who is right for the fraternity and who isn’t. Yet, Mr. Barnett says that, after the fraternities have each carefully chosen, “the self-selection process would then be used to fill out the remaining places in both fraternities and eating houses.”

Mr. Barnett, if your fraternity happens to have ten spaces that need filling when bidding is over, are you not running the risk of adding ten people that you had not desired? Either way, the fraternities run the risks of getting people they had no desire to make members. However, maybe under your proposed system the fraternities will have fewer “undesirables.” So what about these undesirables—the ones who miss out on getting a bid? They are at the bottom of self-selection, and you can’t tell me they won't be bitter. They will be very bitter, and that will hardly add to the cohesiveness of Patterson Court.

Also, your system markedly points out the differences in nationals and non-nationals by forming two distinct selection processes. The non-nationals will naturally want freshmen to opt for self-selection, and the nationals will try hard to get freshmen to choose the bidding system. I assert that the rift caused by forming two distinct selection processes will make the court more divided, not less.

The national fraternities (and next year the women at Davidson (WAD)) are not so bad off. A Davidson co-ed would hardly feel welcome at one of the court's fraternities, and I doubt a Davidson male would find much of a welcome at WAD. The respective masculine/feminine domination in these houses is not likely to be challenged. There is no need to add to the present discrimination by allowing these houses to discriminate on bases other than sex. Certainly, this right should only be voted to the court by a majority of the Davidson students and not by the Patterson Court Council and Council on Campus and Religious Life alone. The ideals of Patterson Court may soon be drastically changed by a handful of people. Shouldn't the student body as a whole be allowed to make such an important decision?

**Local police commend student for stopping theft**

To the Editor:

The Davidson Police Department would like to extend its thanks to the very alert student Marshall A. Waddell who reported to the police the observance of two males in Cannon dorm on the evening of April 8, 1977. Mr. Waddell notified the police that two males were leaving campus and that one had on a red sweater and blue jeans and the other one had a blue sweater. The two suspects were apprehended and the cash taken from David K. Taylor was recovered. One of the suspects was a juvenile and was charged in Juvenile Court. The other suspect was arrested for larceny. Although they could not be charged for the offense as they had discarded it prior to being apprehended, one of the suspects was armed with a .22 cal. pistol. I would personally like to thank Mr. Waddell for his assistance and encourage any student that observes strangers in the dorms to call the police immediately.

**Academic leadership often lacking**

By CATHERINE LANDIS

“Is the student really being given an ability to (objectively) see and examine the nature of the society he is about to enter? What are the...Effects of professionalist influences from law, teaching, and medicine upon undergraduate education—and are these outside influences detrimental to intellectual development?

“At this time I would like to relate some points made by Dr. Robert Paul Wolff in The Ideal of the University. He sees the present university performing four functions which are not exactly what undergraduate education is theoretically all about.

“First, he sees it serving as a ‘sanctuary of scholarship’ in which faculty involved in basic research and publication are supported by the institution in areas away from the classroom—to the detriment of undergraduates who need to be exposed to these scholars more than any other student. (Davidson does not really have this problem.)

“Second, he sees it as a training ground for the professions in which pre-law, pre-med, and other professionalist preparatory programs are seeping increasingly into the undergraduate curriculum, bringing along with them the ethics and ‘coolness’ of professionalism which tends to rob students of the enthusiasm and emotional satisfaction stimulated in the learning process.

“The third function is the university as a ‘base for social services’. This disturbs me in light of the panelist who spoke to this point. Colleges and universities are not arms of government, and I do not think that as educational institutions—who no doubt may have the resources—they should become social service stations when there are hundreds of foundations and institutions in the private sector who could fill the voids left by government in these areas.

“Wolff sees the fourth function of the university as an ‘assembly line for the establishment man’ in which the student is instilled with authoritarian corporate values and acquires a kind of intellectual fascism in which all that is not necessary to know or read is either eliminated or ignored.

“This is what is happening in our schools. How are we going to respond to it? Wolff reveals the ‘lockstep patterns’ graduate schools force upon undergraduate institutions because they are the next step taken many times by undergraduates. This lockstep pattern forced upon the academic and curricular policies of all undergraduate schools is blindly allowed to exist despite the fact that an undergraduate education is inherently different from the nature of graduate education. The influences of professional schools are equally detrimental and ‘lockstep’ in nature.

“Because of these influences we may never comprehend the intellectual irrelevance of grades. When are we going to come to the understanding that we’re not just a community of scholars or a community of learning, but that we are many different communities in the same location with entirely different purposes and ideas about who we are? When are we going to become aware of the alienation that invisibly exists between us?

“In relation to society, I see the college and university ideally serving a critical function which is divorced from the ‘system’ as much as possible to allow for an atmosphere of objectivity which facilitates questioning of values and social goals, and thus permits the education of the undergraduate in this way so that he may see institutional values and biases in professions, academic life, and government.

“Dr. Wolff points out many obstacles to the attainment of a real atmosphere of truth and enthusiasm for the preservation of truth such as financial sources, tradition, graduate school ‘locksteps’, and elitism. What can we do to overcome these barriers?”

The questions Rabil raised in 1973 are even more important today. Davidson suffers from intellectual stagnancy. Students and faculty, note what Rabil has to say, analyze your own motivations behind your academic pursuit, and ask yourself whether Davidson is living up to its responsibility as an institution of higher learning. We have little academic leadership, no competition to make Davidson the best college in the south. It can be, but we’re going to have to work at it.
