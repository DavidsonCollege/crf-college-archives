ports lants By BOB CARTER LINKSMEN FEATURE Our Wildcat golfers gave quite a good account of themselves in the annual Southern Intercollegiate Golf Tournament held in Athens recently. Leading golfers from all sections of the country take part in the affair and this year’s veteran seemed to be the best of all time.

Granville Sharpe shot beautifully in the first flight with rounds of 73 and 78, for an aggregate score of 151. Sharpe was tied for first place after the first eighteen holes, but the Blue Devil ace came through with a brilliant 69 to take medalist honors. In regular play, Sharpe went on to the quarterfinals, where he was stopped by Stewart of Louisiana State, one up in 20 holes after a terrific battle. George Wright, after qualifying for the second flight with an 81-77, went to the quarterfinals, where he was defeated. Pete Cavert, Scotty Paterson, Bob Carter, and Ben Washburn all played well, but were eliminated in the early rounds.

The Wildcats placed fifth in a field of seventeen teams. Illinois, who has the best college team ever assembled, according to the press, won the meet. Duke placed second, Michigan was third, Georgia fourth, and Davidson fifth. The Wildcats placed ahead of North and South Carolina, the Citadel, Georgia Tech, Hampden-Sydney, Florida, Alabama, Auburn, Mississippi, Sewanee, and Tulane.

Sharpe qualified in the first flight with a 73-78—151. Cooper advanced to the third flight. Charlie Pegram was defeated in the first round by Boyd, North Carolina’s number one man, having qualified for the third flight with an 80-82—162. Jackie Abels’ qualifying score put him in the fourth flight, where he was beaten in the quarterfinals by Watter of Florida.

Davidson Nine Drops Two More

Wofford Terriers Eke Out 5-4 Victory Over ’Cats In Extra Inning As Lucas Weakens; Furman Fast Ball Ace Holds ’Cats To Five Hits

Falling before the powerful Duke trackmen opened their current conference season withvs. N.C., Chapel Hill; Richardson, Tech; Spencer, Davidson; Heo Heren, Tech; Pubsees, Davidson; Trae, Tech.

Running wild in the first stanza, Tech defeated Davidson 170-3 1-2. Pole vault: Gla, Tech; Strandwitz, Davidson. 

In the game against Presbyterian Junior College team, the Dukes collected sixteen hits off of Thomas in five innings and two off of McLean. The Dukes were cooled down by Chastain after he entered the game in the sixth, replacing McLean, who had one out and three bases loaded. Chastain sent five men down swinging and allowed four scattered hits. Verner and Shokes furnished additional color to the game when the former raced deep to center field to catch Shokes’ long drive that might have driven in two runs. Earlier in the game, Shokes made a spectacular play when he left his base to nab Byam’s bad throw.

The ball team finished the week with three games on the wrong side of the ledger and no apparent improvement. The reason for the losses is obvious—lack of attack. With a team batting average of approximately .200 and a total of less than 45 hits in seven tilts, the Wildcats have shown no attack or threat of one. A team with such an average will not win many games.

Davidson's freshman track team lost its first meet of the year to an exceptionally well-balanced Virginia Tech freshman team by the score of 32 5-6 to 84 1-6. The meet was run on a cold wind-swept field amid flurries of snow. The Tech freshmen were especially strong in the running events as they swept the 100-yard dash, 400-yard run, and the 880-yard run. Sprunt of Davidson was third in the 220-yard dash and Belk was third in the 120-yard high hurdles, Tech taking the first two places in both events. Martin and Lumpkin won second and third in the low hurdles and Nimmons won first in the mile run. 

In the field events, Horan won first in the pole vault, Lacy won first in the broad jump, and Belk tied for first in the high jump. McMullin of Virginia Tech finished second in the 220 with three first places to his credit while Nimmons, Horan, Lacy, and Belk each gained five points for Davidson.

The prospects for the Wildcats finishing above the .500 mark are gloomy, to say the least. In view of the fact that Carolina and Duke will be met on successive days, two games against Wake Forest and South Carolina add no rosy gleam to the horizon.

Short Shots:
- Watts’ volleyball team won its first game with only five men—and one was on crutches.
- Major League scouts are after Tommy Byrne of Wake Forest like flies after honey. Odds are 2 to 1 he’s already signed and ready for delivery.
- Orchids to the SPEF’s for their undefeated volleyball team, quite a fine record.
