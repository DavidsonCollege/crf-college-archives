**New clubs form, focus on diversity**

**CDSA, JSU, GSA promote acceptance, education on campus**

It is only appropriate that amidst a changing world and an increasingly diverse student population that Davidson’s list of student-run
special interest groups is reshaping itself this year. Several new groups like the Jewish Student Union and the Chronically Ill
& Disabled Student Association have been created this fall, while existing groups like the Gay-Straight Alliance are currently revamping.

Fostering tolerance amongst students of different religions, sexual orientations, gender, and physical abilities seems to be the theme across this
new flux of student groups. As their names suggest, these new groups cater to small minorities on campus, which consequently
have received little attention. In Davidson fashion, though, student leaders who are passionate about their causes have taken the initiative
to begin bringing students of similar circumstances together, providing support and promoting awareness on campus and elsewhere.

**Staley lecturer preaches need for science and faith**

**College welcomes Polkinghorne for lectures, class sessions**

By EMILY DREW
News Editor

From his opening worship service on Monday to the second public lecture tonight, the 2002 Staley Lecturer has provided his
audience with provocative insights into the relationship between science and theology.

The Reverend Doctor John C. Polkinghorne, from Cambridge, England, has discussed the vastness of the universe and the scientific wonders
of cosmic creation over the past two days.

But as he reminded the congregation in Lingle Chapel on Monday, the universe’s most complex creation is only a few
inches this side of the telescope lens.

Polkinghorne is a mathematical physicist and Anglican priest whose work strives to take religion and science with equal seriousness and
to recognize that the two disciplines each seek “a truth whose attainment comes through the pursuit of well-motivated belief,” he
says.

Since he arrived at Davidson on Sunday, Polkinghorne has actively participated in life on campus. Besides his two lectures, Polkinghorne’s
itinerary has included lunches and dinners with professors, students, and staff. He also acted as a guest lecturer in the
team-taught class of Drs. Gfroerer and Robb, which deals with philosophical issues in modern physics.

“We're delighted with the community’s response and with Polkinghorne’s presence and articulation of a Christian faith perspective that is so
carefully and beautifully conceived and explained,” said College Chaplain Rob Spach after Tuesday night’s lecture.

In that first lecture, “Is Science Enough?” Polkinghorne admitted that he wants to explore how methods of exploration in science
and theology can be pushed together while maintaining real intellectual integrity.

The mathematics of science, he argued, give real insight to the beauty and mysteries of the physical world, however, he
insisted “science is not enough.”

“Testing,” he said, “must give way to trusting” in order to better understand the “astonishingly rational transparency of the universe.”
Mathematics may be the key to unlocking mysteries of the physical world, but he asked,

**Vamanos Van parked after alcohol found on board**

By MATT GARFIELD
Managing Editor

Administrators shut down the Vamanos Van indefinitely after six students were ticketed for alcohol possession following a traffic stop late
Saturday night.

The Davidson Town Police stopped the van on Griffith Street around 10:30 p.m. on Saturday after being notified by a
Cornelius restaurant that alcohol may be on board.

Officers discovered an open cooler of beer on the van, and issued citations to six of the roughly nine students
on board, said senior SGA Senator Kevin Epps, who manages the van and was on board Saturday. Epps did not
receive a citation.

On Monday, school administrators ordered the van parked until the SGA formulates a new policy that defines the alcohol policy
more clearly.

Since 1997, the SGA and Patterson Court Council have provided the 14-passenger van as a free service to transport students
anywhere from exits 25 and 36 on I-77 on Thursday through Saturday.

It’s often used to carry students from area bars and restaurants after they’ve been drinking alcohol. Epps said Saturday wasn’t
the first time alcohol had been consumed on the bus.

It was Epps’s understanding that the van is a privately run service similar to a limousine, meaning that it could
legally carry alcohol.

Epps said he believes local police knew students frequently drank alcohol on the van, but didn’t take action as long
as the driver was sober.

“Has there been drinking on the bus? Yes,” he said. “Has it ever been caught? No. The town knew it
was a program that supplied a safe ride for people who had been to parties and bars that could not
drive because they were impaired.”
