**Fall Y Services Opened With Inspiring Message by Rev. D. M. Chalmers**

**Charlottesville Pastor Pictures Deep Tragedy in Lack of Fundamental Idea of Life**

**MEETINGS END TUESDAY**

**Chapel Services Given Over to Series of Devotional Addresses**

At the regular church service Sunday morning, November 13, Dr. Dwight Chalmers opened his Fall Evangelistic Services with a wonderfully
inspiring message, based on an incident in the Book of Daniel. He chose his text from the second chapter and
the fifth verse, which reads, “The thing is gone from me.” This remark is the answer made by the King
of Babylon to the question put to him by his wise men, “O, King, tell thy servants the dream and
we will show the interpretation thereof.”

To Rev. Chalmers, this scene pictures the deep tragedy of aimless life—a condition which has become dangerously commonplace in our
modern existence. He draws a parallel between the empty answer of that King and the equally empty answer of present-day
man to the question, “What are your dreams?” The man of today spends his time, his money, his energies to
achieve results, which, when closely examined, are vague and indefinite. Today, more than ever, he is surrounded by greatly increasing
stimulants which demand that he tell his dreams, voice his ambitions; yet, how can he when “the thing is gone
from” him?

Dr. Chalmers compared the King and his wise men to two great football teams, prepared in every way to play
a magnificent game, but lacking the very thing that makes the game real—a football. Here again, it is where man
has failed, where he has missed the fundamental fact of life—that he must have a well-established, worthwhile motive about which
to center his endeavors. Very applicable to business methods of the times is this little drama from Babylon. We have
promoters and organizers enough—but, promoting and organizing what? We are so busy organizing that we fail to recognize the one
important thing that has given birth to the organization. In school and home we are encompassed by those who ask
of us, “Tell us thy dreams and we will give you the interpretation thereof.” And if we are honest, for
most of us the answer would be, “The thing is gone from me.”

Science tells us, says Rev. Chalmers, that we have added from ten to fifteen years to the average length of
a man’s life; furthermore, we have enlarged by thousands the number of inventions for the reduction of labor. But, are
we any happier than our forefathers were? Have we in doing so, found some great truth that makes longer life
any sweeter? Our speaker thinks not. However, he hastens to call upon that figure that has for centuries given hope
and meaning to human life—Christ. If we were to ask Christ, “What are your dreams?” His answer would be something
like this, “I am come that ye might have life, and have it more abundantly.” Upon this he bases the
recovery of the world.

Reverend Chalmers continued his series of talks in chapel Monday morning with another inspiring address. He took as his text,
John 5:13, “Jesus had passed out unnoticed, there being a crowd in the place.” This text was taken from Weymouth’s
translation, as Reverend Chalmers believes that this version can be more readily understood than the King James translation. Mr. Chalmers
showed in his discussion how we, in our time, have become “lost in the crowd,” and how we try to
crowd so many things into our twenty-four hours that we lose the real purpose of life. He demonstrated in many
ways in which we are constantly hurrying, always progressing, and never thinking of the real aims of our existence. He
showed how our family life has been affected by this trait ingrained in us, how love and all that is
sweet about family life have been made to take a second place by our selfish aims. The beautiful things of
life are lost in the crowd. But—the chief loss because of this trait, as Reverend Chalmers remarked, is in re-

**Pi Delta Alpha**

Pi Delta Alpha honorary medical fraternity will hold its first open meeting of the session Friday evening, November 18th, at
7:30. Dr. Thomas D. Sparrow, a Davidson alumnus and a prominent surgeon of Charlotte, will speak at the meeting. Dr.
Sparrow took his undergraduate work at Davidson and then went to the School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania
to receive his medical degree. All persons interested in medicine are cordially invited to attend this open meeting as the
guests of the fraternity. The organization earnestly hopes that a large crowd will be present to hear Dr. Sparrow, as

be announced at a later date.

**BROWN WINS SECOND HONORS IN SYMPOSIUM**

**His Speech on Hoover Wins Merit in Political Debate**

Gordon H. “Skip” Brown, representing Davidson, won second place at the political symposium held November 7 at Athens, Ga. His
subject was “Herbert Hoover.” Mr. S. G. Elliot of Emory University won first place and was awarded a silver cup.
He also spoke on Mr. Hoover. The Rollins College representative, speaking on “Franklin Roosevelt,” was third.

This contest was conducted by the University of Georgia. Held on the eve of the national election, it attracted a
large crowd of students, faculty members and townspeople. Undergraduate students from North Carolina, Emory, Davidson, Georgia Tech, Rollins and Georgia
competed. The three judges were distinguished men not connected with any of the schools represented. The contestants were required to
speak extemporaneously for seven minutes on Roosevelt, Hoover or Thomas. Not until they were seated on the platform did each
speaker draw to ascertain about whom he was to speak.

Besides achieving a fine record in forensics,

**Six Men Are Chosen in Debating Tryouts**

The tryouts for the debating team of 1932-33 were held last Tuesday night, November 8, in the auditorium of Chambers
Building under the supervision of the Forensic Council through which the debating team functions. Three of the faculty members acted
as judges. These were Dr. C. K. Brown, Prof. E. J. Erwin, and Dr. Price Gwynn.

Some 23 students were present as candidates, each making short speeches on the following subject: Resolved that all commercial banks
should become national banks and thus a part of the Federal Reserve System. At the final vote the original 23
were reduced to six on the regular teams with three alternates. There were two Seniors, two Juniors, and two Sophomores.
The two of the graduating class were Leland McKeithan and Charlie Moore. The Juniors were Hugh Hawkins and Rawling Pratt-Thomas,
while the representatives of the class of ’35 are Skip Brown and Bob Smith.

No debates will take place until the second semester and between the present and the time when they begin, three
teams, consisting of two regulars and one alternate, will be chosen from the above names. Two of the most outstanding
debates will take place with the University of Georgia and Rollins College. Rollins is to debate with the University of
Dublin on a national hook-up over WEAF. The schedule of the debates will be submitted later.

**Proposed Engagements of Glee Club Announced**

**Annual Trip to Queens-Chicora Anticipated by Members**

The Davidson Glee Club, under the direction of Mr. Eugene Craft, of Charlotte, recently announced its engagements and proposed trips
for the near future. TheFirst engagement away from the campus is a concert at Queens-Chicora College, Charlotte, Friday, November 18.
This is an annual engagement for the Glee Club, anticipated with a great deal of pleasure on the part of
the members.

Arrangements have also been made for numerous concerts at Flora Macdonald College, Red Springs, N.C.; Aberdeen, N.C.; Hickory, N.C.; and
Valdese, N.C. Trips to State College and other points in North Carolina have been proposed but not definitely arranged yet.
All of these trips are planned to be made before the Christmas holidays. Under the able direction of Mr. Craft,
the Glee Club has been making rapid progress this year. Having lost comparatively few men by graduation, and having obtained
some valuable material among the new men, the Glee Club is looking forward to a very successful year. Reeves Pope
and his Southernaires, Davidson’s popular dance orchestra, will accompany the Glee Club on all trips.

Sigma Pi Sigma
Sigma Pi Sigma, national honorary physics fraternity, held its fall initiation Tuesday night, November 8. The initiates were J.P. Alexander,

At a recent meeting of the society, a humorous debate on “Resolved that since Roosevelt cleaned up in November, Mrs.
Roosevelt should not allow a Hoover cleanup in the White House,” was held. This debate was carried on by the
newly initiated men, Dale Jones and McMullen for the affirmative, and Joe Morrison and Alexander for the negative. Last night
another debate was held. The four new men, McNeill and Baggette, affirmative, and Marsh and Neill, negative, participated in a
lively discussion on “Ice is not what it is cracked up to be.” The society looks forward to a successful

Homecoming Celebration is Held as Many Alumni Return During Weekend
Davidson-Carolina Football Game Is Feature Entertainment of a Very Successful Program
GRAHAM GUEST OF SCHOOL
Barbecue Dinner Given by Committee Headed by Prof. Blythe
Last weekend Davidson College held its annual Homecoming celebration. The festivities started Friday night and were carried on until the
house parties broke up late in the afternoon on Sunday. This year’s Homecoming weekend was quite similar to those of
the past, although several new features were brought in. Professor Blythe of the Spanish Department was at the head of
the Homecoming Committee, and he was ably assisted by Messrs. Jackson and Hengeveld.

The entertainment program started Friday night, when the Pan-Hellenic Council of Davidson College sponsored a formal dance at the Hotel
Charlotte, featuring Buster Spann and His South Carolina Gamecocks. The dance went over splendidly, and the orchestra played several clever
novelty numbers that especially pleased those present. Saturday morning the Davidson varsity cross-country team decisively defeated the Winston-Salem All-Stars, and
the Davidson Freshman harriers took a closer meet from the Winston-Salem High School. Following this, an alumni gathering was held
in the auditorium of Chambers Building. At this conclave, Capt. Norton G. Pritchett, professor of physical education and varsity track
coach at Davidson, was the principal speaker. Speeches were also made by several of the alumni present. President Frank Porter
Graham of the University of North Carolina was Davidson’s guest for the Homecoming weekend, and he said a few words
during the gathering in the auditorium. To top the meeting off, the efficient committee had arranged with the Boar's Head,
barbecue stand deluxe, of Charlotte, to put on a real old-fashioned barbecue dinner. This went over in great style, and
after the dinner, all adjourned to the game. The alumni were given the opportunity to get good seats when a
special block of tickets was held out prior to the game and were put up for sale during the barbecue.

The game, considered by practically everyone as the main thing Homecoming is for, was called for 2:30 p.m. It was
a splendid exhibition of football, but it put something of a blot on the Homecoming celebration.

Davidson Freshmen End Season With Duke Game
Wildkittens Have Suffered Only One Defeat in Year’s Schedule
The Davidson Freshman football team will play its last game of the season Friday afternoon on Richardson Field against the
Duke Freshmen. The Imps have one of the most powerful teams this year they have had in years, having defeated
all teams that they encountered, including State Freshmen, Wake Forest Freshmen, and Oak Ridge. The State first-year men, who downed
the Wildkittens 12 to 7 two weeks ago, were defeated by Duke 12 to 6. The Imps’ team pivots around
Saleeby and Sythmore at ends and Ferguson in the backfield, and it is on these men that they are depending
for both their offensive and defensive power. Although it seems that the Duke Freshmen have a slight margin on Davidson,
this ought to be a good game, as the Kittens should be playing hard for their last game. The Wildkittens
will close a most successful season, having defeated P.J.C., 26-0, and Wofford Fresh, 21-6, tied William and Mary, 0-0, and
lost to State Fresh, 12-7. The varsity can therefore look forward to getting some good material from this scrapping eleven
to fill the places of those members of the team who will graduate.
