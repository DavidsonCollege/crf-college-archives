#### Seven Days in the Everglades Makes One Great Week
By Jonathan Harris

The dawn of the storm of the century was the last truly innocent morning for some members of Davidson Outdoor’s Everglades expedition. As we piled into two vans on a very early and dark Saturday, not one of the twenty-two students and leaders could have imagined the things we would learn along the way. Ed and Marlys Daugherty were the trip leaders as well as the drivers of the van I rode in. Without them, we would surely have died or at least had some reason to complain. But they seemed to radiate a protective Magic-Shell coating around us that made the following Sunday and the rest of the week the banana split of all natural experiences—delicious, and not to be eaten without the help of several friends.

Our fifteen-hour van ride was recorded for therapeutic reasons in several student diaries, “Saturday. We left Davidson and made it about an hour or two down the road. Then, as we pulled out of a BP station something so horrible happened that I cannot even tell you, my dearest confidant, what it was.” A gust of eighty-mile-an-hour wind caught the canoe trailer and turned it on its side, stopping the Everglades expedition just two hours outside the North Carolina border. It became the first time that our group had faced danger and chaos together. We held hands and watched with sleepy fascination as the giant green BP sign crashed down in the wind outside. Inside, the BP station was dark and full of stranded travelers. Macaroni noodles were slowly uncurling and congealing without refrigeration in the deli and the electric toilets were not flushing. Light is not always required on a Davidson Outdoors excursion and toilets are a rare luxury, but there was something important, strange yet hopeful about the deli’s macaroni, a prophetic voice bubbling up to guide our journey that we could not yet hope to understand. Two days later some of us would hear that voice again. But during this first storm, we were lost in innocent and hopeful thoughts, reading the messages on T-shirts and hats being sold in the store and wondering what the wind would blow down next.

Half our group stayed in the hotel that night and half went with Eleanor Gray’s family who lived nearby. The next morning, with the trailer loaded again and the group together, we set out for Florida. At the Florida border, we had some fresh-squeezed orange juice. Then, we found out that the Everglades were open for business. Our malfunctioning headlights guided us to another service station where we cooked dinner underneath a powerful fluorescent street lamp. But we finally made it to the Everglades, where our story splits in two. We divided into two canoeing groups, scheduled a rendezvous, and said heartfelt goodbyes. Then, we were on the water.

The water is long in the Everglades. Long against the horizon and short against the bottom: two to five feet deep in most places. And on the long water, you can see the sky and clouds reflected; you can see egrets and Blue Herons; you can see fish beneath that reflecting surface and when you get really desperate from too much beauty you can look over at a clump of mangrove roots for relief. On our first day of canoeing, we saw three manatees and several dolphins and long, long, long water. That night, we camped on a beach looking out on the Gulf of Mexico. We had had an easy day paddling with the wind on our side and we had a delicious dinner together on the beach. There were shooting stars and an occasional passing satellite in the sky. But that prophetic voice was mumbling.

#### Ain't Nothin’ Like A Country Song: These May Be The Best

It would be wrong to say that country music has historically cornered the market on good lyrics. As a matter of fact, many of the country songs of “old” had relatively little to offer in the face of offerings of its contemporary genres. I mean, you choose: “Yesterday” by the Beatles or “On The Bayou” by old Hank? But today’s country has something to say. And, quite frankly, today’s pop music has less and less to say - when I can understand exactly what it is they’re saying. Don’t get me wrong; this is a sweeping generalization to which artists like Arrested Development or Sting certainly appeal as exceptions.

A country song, “simple” as it may seem, addresses real and fundamental feelings and concerns. Of course, we can’t all identify with what it’s like to drive a truck down to the pool hall and kick our boots up on the bar; but we can all identify with what it’s like to be head over heels in love, to be jilted and stung, to be ready to go out and party. What makes country different is that it spells out whatever it’s trying to say in a way that doesn’t confuse us with abstract references, but enhances its meaning.Message with clever references to a particular state of mind or a particular action with which we can all identify. I guess it’s a nice, mindless release of energy to chant along with Pearl Jam (or whoever it is) “Oh-oh! I-I whoa-oh! I'm still alive” over and over again. But on the (hopefully) average day in which you are not under the effects of a strong hallucinogen, it is somewhat difficult to obtain any kind of significant meaning or message from that drone. But wait, I don’t mean “message” in the sense that every song should have a political message - far from it. I’m only suggesting how nice it is to be able to have something interesting to think about in a song. A country song will either tell you a story or describe a situation in which you will inevitably deposit yourself for a moment. You will smile or you will feel your heart sink just a little. But you will think, react, and enjoy. Here’s a small taste. Give these songs a try sometime:
