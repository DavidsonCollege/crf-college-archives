SPENCE AND BOOKER

Sanders and Sorrels, who spoke first on the negative, both took the position that a policeman has the same rights
as any other citizen and should not be prohibited from striking. Smith then spoke of the injustices that had been
committed in such strikes previously, and argued that the men needed all the protection possible. The rebuttals as a whole
were rather weak, but involved some rather witty discussion of some unimportant points.

SIGMA UPSILON AGAIN GETS INTO ACTION
A meeting of the Blue Pencil chapter of Sigma Upsilon was held Wednesday night in the Pi Kappa Alpha hall.
Refreshments were served and a very interesting literary program, consisting of book reviews, was carried out. The following reviews were
enjoyed: "The Builders," by L. G. Calhoun; "Anthony Hope," by S. H. Askew, and a book review of "Mare Nostrum"
by A. D. McArn. The work that has been done on the Annual was discussed, also the work for the
remainder of the year.

A TERRIBLE CATASTROPHE HAS OCCURRED
Literary circles are astounded at the resignation of R. T. L. Liston from the staff of the Davidson College Magazine.
It is rumored that this was done in order that he might devote his entire attention to throwing rocks at
the Robins on the campus. Mr. Liston refuses to be interviewed on the subject. His photograph cannot be secured.

Drs. J. W. McConnell and S. J. Christenbury have bought the old Skinner home and the adjoining land from Mr.
L. B. Long.

Poor Debates in Both Societies.

Phi. Society.
The meeting of the Phi Saturday night was a long drawn out, uninteresting affair. The debates were not up to
the usual standard, showing lack of preparation and very little pep.

The subject to be discussed was: "Resolved, That Firemen and Policemen should be prohibited by law from striking." S. N.
Booker, D. P. McGeachy, and C. N. Morrison, argued in the affirmative manner. These worthy gentlemen were opposed by L.
L. Wilson, C. W. Robinson and L. P. Burney. There was

DAVIDSON COLLEGE
DAVIDSON, NORTH CAROLINA

Dr. Lingle made the address of welcome to the new members, in which he set forth in a most interesting
manner the ideals and principles of the International Polity Clubs. The aim of these various clubs as pointed out by
Dr. Lingle is to encourage and help thoughtful college men to study and think about the problems and relations of
nation with nation, to look at such problems from a broader viewpoint, and to do all within our power toward
preventing another war.

H. Spence then read a most interesting and humorous paper on "Inside the Irish Question." The speaker showed that he
had made a deep study of this subject and his talk was most instructive as well as

GENTLEMEN
When in Need of Tonsorial Work, give but little argument advanced by either side. The best speech was made by
the first gentleman on the affirmative. His was very oratorical, but showed lack of brain power. It is rumored that
this was his last speech for it smacked strongly of the “finis.”

The extemporaneous debate was between W. C. Smith and J. L. McKeithan on the subject: “Resolved, That Davidson should have
a common mess hall.” It is hard to decide which one made the most “messy” speech, but the negative side
seemed to impress the judges.

T. H. Spence next delivered his farewell address. His subject was, “The Davidsonian, et al.” The critic announced it to
be interesting. The house thought it to be amusing. All in all, this oration was calculated to bring his speaking
career to a glorious conclusion.

Foscue was ushered to the chair and sworn in by ex-President Calhoun. In a few words, he stated his platform.
His main plans were harder work, fewer bushes, and more earnest endeavor by all parties. All the outgoing officers made
a report of their work while in office, and society adjourned.

Eu. Society.
The debate at the Eumenean Society Saturday night was rather lively, though the audience was more guilty of “life” than
the speakers. There was little argument presented by either side, but most of the speakers used to the full the
many opportunities for witticisms afforded by the question, “Resolved, That policemen, firemen, and other city employees be prohibited by law
from striking.”

The first speaker for the affirmative, Harrell, presented the history of the question according to all the rules of “archaeology,”
but in his rebuttal, brought down the house by his witty attack on the negative. McCutchen and Winter, the next
two speakers on the affirmative, developed the dangers and losses to the public which would attend such a strike and
were both heartily applauded at the long pauses they affected. King, the last speaker of the affirmative, although a substitute
appointed at the last minute, gave a very creditable debate, calling attention to the fact that policemen and firemen were
employed under oath.

R. E. McClure made an illustrated talk on the “Port of Fiume,” in which he presented the Italian view in
regard to this port. Italy’s main reasons for wanting this port as pointed out by the speaker were (1) that
the mountain ranges extending around Fiume form a natural barrier for Italy; (2) that Fiume is not the only port
which the Jugo-Slavs could use, and (3) that the majority of the population of Fiume expressed the wish to become
a part of Italy. As this question is right now before the public eye, the audience was intensely interested in
Mr. McClure’s discussion.

The program as arranged for March 9 is as follows: “Turkey,” A. F. Fricker; “The Political Situation in Egypt,” J.
E. Cassell; and “Digest of Events,” S. H. Askew.

McKEITHEN WINS PHI. FRESH-SOPH DECLAIMER’S MEDAL
The medal, which is given each year by the Philanthropic Literary Society to the best declaimer in the Freshman or
Sophomore class, was awarded to J. H. McKeithen. The contest was very close as was evidenced by the fact that
the judges had to cast a second ballot. McKeithen gave the declamation “Not Guilty,” which was very interesting and delivered
in true McKeithen style. This contest brought to light as never before the wealth of material among the newer Phi
members. Following is a list of the speakers and their subjects:

D. W. Lowrance, “Lest We Forget.”
W. M. McLeod, “The Unknown Speaker.”
J. F. Clark, “Centralization in the United States.”
H. R. Poole, “Duty of the South to the Boy.”
Loyd J. Bray, “Toussaint L’Ouverture.”
J. W. Baldwin, “Country, My Mother and My God.”
S. Johnson, “America’s Uncrowned Queen.”
W. P. Kimzey, “Our Flag.”

THE KEENEST PALATE CANNOT DETECT “THE DIFFERENCE”
MINNEHAHA (Light) PALE and SPECIAL (Dark) is NOT a “near beer” that ferments AFTER drinking, but a thoroughly fermented LAGERED
BREW aged in the vats four months; made from barley and hops ONLY, just like the brews of forty years
ago; but afterward by our new Patent Vacuum Process (First operated Nov. 5, 1919, by us. Instead of COOKING by
BOILING), the high wines ONLY are removed, and not one atom of brewing flavor and aroma taken out; hence it
is delightfully EXHILARATING. SUPPLY YOURSELF WITH MINNEHAHA WITHOUT DELAY.
