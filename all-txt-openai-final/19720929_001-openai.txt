**Scott Claims Food Money Enough**
**Proposes Three-Meal Plan, Predicts Off-Campus Eating**

By ALEC HOON

All students eating at the college-operated eating facilities should have money left over on their meal tickets by the end
of the fall term, predicted Food Service Director Ron Scott. In the first week of operation of the new eating
system, some freshmen and upperclassmen alike have registered complaints about the service that they are getting.

Under the new meal plan, the students have approximately $2.51 per day to spend at any one of three houses,
each of which features a different style of eating. Student complaints range from “not having enough money to eat with”
to “having to wait in line too long.” Scott seemed to feel that as time went on these problems would
gradually work themselves out.

“I would emphasize that in the first week, many students have eaten more meals at our houses than we would
expect from the statistics of past years. However, I feel that this will change as we get into the college
year. Students will find that as the term progresses, they will be eating fewer meals at the college facilities, as
they spend more time elsewhere (at other girls’ schools, and the Wildcat Den, for example), and consequently they will have
more to spend when they do eat in the Slater Houses,” Scott said.

“I would also point out that from last Tuesday to Friday, only 70 percent of the total amount of money
that students could spend was spent at the three eating houses. By the end of the term, those eating at
the Slater service should have money left over which we will allow them to spend in the first week of
the winter term,” he said.

Scott is formulating another plan to help those who are presently spending more than their allotted money. “We have developed
a three-meal-a-day plan where for $2.35 students can eat three specified meals and still have fifteen cents left over to
spend as they desire. Under this plan, students will have some choice over what they eat. The only stipulation is
that they eat all three meals under the new plan,” Scott explained.

When queried about the length of the lines that often formed at the three houses before meals, Scott said that
at present he was feeding 476 students in facilities designed for 450. “However, I feel that again as time passes,
the lines will begin to even out as students make equal use of all the houses,” he said.

The College eating facilities constitute a unique experiment in that it represents the first time students on one campus have
been given a choice of three different types of food at three different houses to select from. Richards House is
a snack bar-cafeteria where you can get short orders or full meals. Rusk House features a buffeteria where a student
can get unlimited seconds. The third house, Bailey, serves all kinds of sandwiches at lunch, and becomes a steak house
for dinner.

The college switched to this new format because of several complaints over the past few years, including the fact that
dates in the past could not eat on a student’s card (she now can) and those who did not eat
seconds were helping to pay for those who did. The way the system works now, everyone pays only for what
he eats, and those who skip meals are not penalized since they can spend more money later.

**Study Of Transcript**

By BOB HOWELL
Asst. Managing Editor

Last year’s increase in grade transcript fees and the subsequent protest from the SGA Senate have not been forgotten by
the administration, Vice President for Finance and Development C. David Cornell promised this week. After the fee for a transcript
and one update was doubled from $1 to $2, Kurt Geisinger, then a senior, presented the Senate last spring with
his cost analysis in which he proposed a student's grades could be transcribed and mailed to a graduate school for
50 cents. At that time, Cornell said added to the college's list of financial priorities would be a reconsideration of
the fee byComp- troller Robert W. Davidson. No action on the question has been taken as of this week. “With
closing the books and other matters this summer, it didn't quite get to the top of the list," Cornell explained,
“but it's back up there." Davidson has been reminded to reinvestigate costs of preparing a transcript, he said, recalling the
differences between Geisinger's analysis and the original cost study made by the college stemmed primarily from differing estimates of labor
costs. Davidson's analysis calls for reimbursing a secretary $1 for spending 20 minutes on a transcript. Geisinger, suggesting the process
takes no more than four minutes, would pay the secretary 20 cents. New figures should be available “within a month,”
Cornell predicted. “We do have other things to do around here."

“It's trash," said SGA President Ralph Peeples. “We know it doesn't cost $2; it’s obviously just making money for the
college.” Geisinger and the Senate handled the transcript problem with tact, Peeples observed, while the only response they received was
avoidance and delay. “I don't see what the problem is,” he continued. “All it takes is one memorandum to change
the price schedule. I think it's criminal for the college to make money off students who already have to pay
$50 to $100 for graduate school entrance exams and applications,” he stressed. “It's ridiculous.”

NO BREAKFAST TOMORROW
Freshmen discover the board plan doesn’t give them enough to eat.

Freshmen Complain Food Cost More Than They Can Afford
By MIKE TANNER
Asst Managing Editor

Now that the David Ovens College Union has been razed in preparation for the construction of the new library and
its facilities have been relocated about the campus, it is time to evaluate the most important of those facilities, the
cafeteria, from the point of view of the quality of its service. In interviews with members of the freshman class
this week, certain liabilities in the new eating arrangement were expressed as well as suggestions for its improvement.

The most frequent of the complaints is that the food is far too costly to allow the student to eat
3 meals per day using his meal ticket. This year, those students who take their meals at any of the
3 food service houses of the union are allotted approximately $2.75 per day to feed themselves. However, with the increased
cost of the food over last year, an average-sized dinner at any of the houses will cost from $1.80 to
$2.50. Members of the freshman class are particularly disturbed, as many are coming to realize that their board fee will
provide them with 3 substantial meals daily for, at best, 3/4 of a term.

“If the $600.00 board fee that we paid isn't sufficient to feed us, then the college shouldn't have allowed us
to think that it would and therefore should have placed the board figure higher,” said Freshman Jack Kenelly. All of
the freshmen interviewed agreed that the quality of the food was very good but all maintained that they would use
up their meal tickets long before the end of the term. Two exceptions to this were freshmen roommates Alex Roberts
and Rick Gettys, neither of whom eat breakfast and both of whom go home nearly every weekend. Freshman Carl Schwartz
felt that as the situation is, a roster posted by the college in the houses indicating the recommended expenditures per
meal would help students stretch their meal tickets. Many of those asked admitted to being quite hungry at times due
to economy at meal times, this rather overshadowing the assets of the food service. As freshman Ben Hedrick expressed the
situation, “Our worries here shouldn’t include feeding ourselves; I’m starving.”

Nixon Whips
Nixon defeated McGovern in the straw polls conducted Wednesday by the Open End Committee of the Student Union. Of the
565 students voting, 320 voted for Nixon, 245 for McGovern, and 11 for Schmitz. However, among the faculty and staff,
McGovern won 45 votes to Nixon’s 13. Another poll is planned for Nov. 3 after presenting speakers and debates on
the issues with an opportunity for student participation. “We also hope to have a further breakdown of the vote into
classes at that time,” said Connette.
