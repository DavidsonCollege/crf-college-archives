acorns to mighty oaks

When a late January ice storm unexpectedly toppled the largest tree on campus, a venerable Willow Oak which grew for 65 years beside the Philanthropic Hall, the search was on.

Grounds Supervisor Irvin Brawley checked with nurseries across the Carolinas to find the biggest replacement tree which could be safely transplanted. By chance, he said, the one he finally chose was also a Willow Oak.

This Saturday morning at 11:30, in a ceremony which was carefully planned to coincide with Alumni weekend, students, townspeople, and the Class of ’58 will gather near the large brown scar in the lawn where the other tree stood.

As the new oak is being planted, Class President John Bernhardt may say a few words. His class is footing the bill for the tree “to perpetuate the memory” of the legendary Woodrow Wilson acorns.

They've juggled a few dates to allow for the possibility that the oak grew from one of the acorns that Wilson happened to start being given to the College as symbols of Wilson’s famous 14 points.
