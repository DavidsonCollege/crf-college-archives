Average Faculty Salary Increases Announced

Faculty salaries will increase for the 1983-84 school year an average of 8.2 percent. Professor salaries will rise an average of 7.7 percent, or $2,700; associates, 8.0 percent, or $2,300; assistants and instructors, 8.9 percent, or $900. Vice-president for Academic Affairs and Dean of the Faculty T. C. Price Zimmermann pointed out that these percentages “can be taken as a relative standard with which to compare individual increments.” However, the average reflects factors such as special increments for reasons of equity. Zimmermann also pointed out that dollar figures are not a good standard of comparison, since the same percentage creates a larger increment at the top of the rank than at the bottom.

Update On Senior Class Gift

The class of 1983 is well on its way to meeting its goal of $100,000, an amount to be given to the school for the endowment of yearly need-based scholarships awarded through the Admissions Office. The gift campaign, which will continue throughout the next five years, has already brought commitments from 58 percent of the class in the initial push for pledges. Gift Treasurer Alan Fields reports that 207 seniors (out of a class of 352) have pledged thus far. Most have pledged one percent of their adjusted gross income for the next five years, although some have pledged lump figures and others have pledged as much as two percent. Campaign Co-Chairman Jeff Jordan says that a significant number of one percent pledges are necessary for the success of their fund, but he stresses that participation by all seniors in any way which they feel comfortable is the ultimate goal. Already the percentage of participation is encouraging. With 58 percent pledging, and that number rising daily, the Class of 1983 far exceeds the current average.

Davidson College Presents Alumni Awards

Four Davidson College alumni received awards from the College's alumni association at a reunion luncheon last Saturday. Robert T. Amos Jr. of High Point, the president of Amos Hosiery Mills, was presented the association’s highest honor, the Distinguished Alumnus Award. Amos has served as president of Davidson’s alumni association and as a member of the board of trustees and the parents council. He also has been president of the High Point Chamber of Commerce and chairman of the board of both High Point Historical Association and Memorial Hospital. He has served the industry as chairman of the board of the National Association of Hosiery Manufacturers and director of the National Association of Manufacturing. He was named “Citizen of the Year” in High Point in 1975.

Alumni Service Medals went to W. Blair Gwyn of North Wilkesboro, W.E. McNair of Atlanta, Ga., and Ross Smyth of Charlotte. Gwyn, an official of North Carolina National Bank and treasurer of the American Furniture Company, has been active with the Wilkes Chamber of Commerce, the North Wilkesboro Town Board and school board, and the YMCA. He is a member of the Lions Club. McNair served as associate professor of English and director of relations at Agnes Scott College from 1952 until 1977. He is an elder of the Presbyterian Church. Smyth, an attorney, is a member of the North Carolina Bar Association and Myers Park Presbyterian Church, and has been active with the Charlotte Junior Soccer Foundation and the March of Dimes. He is a past president of Davidson's National Alumni Association, and the Mecklenburg County chapter of the Davidson College Alumni Association.

J. Cecil Lawrence of Charlotte also received an alumni service medal that was approved last year but not presented. Lawrence, of the class of 1930, holds additional degrees from Union Theological Seminary. He is a retired executive secretary of the Mecklenburg Presbytery, and served as pastor at various churches. The awards luncheon was held during Davidson's alumni reunion weekend, which saw some 700 alumni return to the campus.
