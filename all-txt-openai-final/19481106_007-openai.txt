VILLAGE VIEWS

We Observe... high time that we give recognition to that group of the student body families, known hereabouts as “Cardboard Village.” It is to that purpose, in conjunction with the idea of better acquainting the student body with this group, that this issue of this edition of the DAVIDSONIAN has been devoted. The men who compose this group, together with their families, are as integral a part of Davidson and Davidson life as does the traditional Wildcat spirit, the legend of the renowned Peter Stuart Ney (with all due respect to Dr. Chalmers Davidson), and all of the others. They are the stabilizing element among a student body which might otherwise very possibly be in a constant state of internal conflict between what one rather harshly might term as the extreme “leftist” and “rightist” factions. What only the most conservative might describe as the widely diversified opinions, which are ever prevalent. This steadying influence might be attributed to the fact that, since on the average they are older, these men have the edge on the rest of us in the matter of experience, or it might be that they have been around enough to realize that the individual is not so all-fired important as he would like to believe. It very probably is largely dependent on the fact that a great many of them are family men, at least we have always been led to believe that marriage generally tends to tame a man down; regardless of the reason, we will always owe a debt of gratitude to those without whom this student body would be as a train without a track. It is just as important for us never to lose sight of the fact that they are just as much a part of the student body as is each one of us, as it is for us to recognize and appreciate the need and benefit of their maturity. They enter just as wholeheartedly into, and get just as much a kick out of participation in any and all of the school’s activities as any of the rest of us. We tip our hat to our “Cardboard Villagers.”

Of the 61 brothers and pledges of Beta chapter, 50 come from the native state of North Carolina. David, Jr., Bill Eborn, Jack Faucette and Connie, Easy Rhodes.

Though They May Not Know It

You need not say to yourself, “I’m not interested in Cardboard Village.” How can you be so definite when you only know part of what the future holds? The part you may not know is what SHE has in her mind. And never be so smart as to say, “She won't pull anything over on me, I’ll pull one on her.” Remember, fellows, a “she” led Solomon's thoughts and I understand he was a pretty clever duck. So if SHE has her eyes on you--you will be interested. Now that you are interested by choice or fate (good Presbyterianism) like this: The village is one big happy family, and it’s unique as such because we have no black sheep, though at times we may seem spotted. The thin walls between the apartments keep you posted on all the neighbors’ spats and activities. Yet it is never necessary to switch.

Stork Going to Make Triple Landing

In the same air of expectancy with which the Berliners watch as the “air-lift” planes fly in over their city; so the inhabitants of the village watch as that well-known bird, the Stork, circles and comes in on its down-wind leg. Having kept a record-breaking schedule up to this point, there are promises of many more flights to be made in the future. The first landing is scheduled to be made early in November at apartment 103, the home of Carolyn and Duncan McGoogan. A flight, of windy March, is expected to be made to apartment 402, the home of Jack Faucette. An “April in Paris” landing is expected for the Rhodes in apartment 404. At present, this is the only available schedule, but there is no reason to suppose that this special service will be discontinued at any time.
