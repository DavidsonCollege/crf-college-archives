### February 1, 1974 The Davidsonian

#### ‘Bucky’ Fuller
(Continued from page 4)

A special word of warning is in order for the Davidson community on the eve of “Bucky’s” visit. He is
never easy to comprehend, whether writing or speaking, even among those who are familiar with his work. Robert W. Marks,
co-author with “Bucky” of “The World of Buckminster Fuller” (1973), has observed that this phenomenon has both psychological and semantic
overloads that clog the channels of communication. He tends to give too much of himself too spontaneously, too richly, too
quickly. The simplest question evokes a torrent of information. And these he expresses in an incisive, private argot, replete with
word coinages, hyphenated Latinisms, and intricate phrases.

On more than one occasion, when he has been scheduled to give an hour-long lecture to a college audience, he
has been found to be still speaking six hours later! Fuller frequently challenges college students to define the terms “synergy”
and “Dymaxion,” and is often amused by their frequent inability to do so. Fuller defines synergy as “the behavior of
a whole system unpredicted by the behavior of its components—or any subassembly of its components.” He extrapolates from this to
indicate that in nature, industry, and society, wholes express more than just the simple effect resulting from the sum of
their respective parts. This concept is crucial to his utilization of General Systems Theory, combined with computer technology and cybernetics
(computer strategy), to approach and resolve successfully the major issues confronting mankind today. Contained within such utilization, or synergetics, are
the germinal seeds for the solution of the energy crisis, population problems, world hunger, wars, and the myriad array of
ecological debilities confronting contemporary mankind. It enables us to tap into the existent unity between the environment and the universe.

Another dimension of Fuller’s Weltanschauung, or worldview, is expressed by the term Dymaxion, a label he uses to qualify the
implications of his inventions and projected ideas. Briefly stated, his Dymaxion concept holds that “rational action in a rational world,
in every social and industrial operation, demands the most efficient overall performance, yielding the greatest possible efficiency in terms of
the available resources.” This past inventor-designer of U.S. Marine Corps advance shelters and all Air Force Distant Early Warning System
Radomes, and author of numerous works, including “Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth,” is today receiving serious attention from the U.S.
government for his matter teleportation concept (analogous to the “Star Trek” transporter, from the earth to the moon in 10
seconds or less), and from the Japanese for his floating city concept (a 9,000-foot-high floating city, capable of housing a
million people, and providing a relatively immediate coastal solution to the Japanese real estate crunch). We can readily see why
Alvin Toffler has called Fuller one of the best reminders of the follies of retirement. I trust that we will
all partake and intellectually taste of this man during his stay at Davidson. “Bucky” Fuller, genuine renaissance man of the
twenty-first century, Citizen of the World!

#### Students Make Cynical Contributions To Davidson Forty-One Defense Fund
I'm starting a defense fund for the Davidson Forty-One. These beings are being imprisoned without trial. Known and loved by
the whole Davidson student body, the Davidson Forty-One are being persecuted. The persecution of this minority has reached a crescendo
recently as they are being threatened with incarceration. Wasted is Ron Scott’s best customer. If Wasted was writing the Michelin
guide, Bailey House would be four-star. In the small hours of the morning, wandering around campus or through Chambers, you
are sure to be accompanied by one of the Davidson Forty-One. When you're up at 2 a.m. watching that movie
classic, “The Cockroach That Ate Cincinnati,” you can count on having Ears and Zeno for company. Ms. Nicholls has warned
students...that pets kept in the dorm are subject to impoundment. This is unnecessary. They need exercise, feeding, attention, and affection.

The highlight of Midwinters '74 will be the appearance of the James Montgomery Band Saturday at 8 p.m. in Love
Auditorium (ID's required). "Highlight" is a word that the James Montgomery Band has not been used to hearing, but it
is one that has been popping up with increasing frequency. This relatively little-known group has started out in a typical
well-structured fashion, having built up a large local following in their hometown of Boston before seriously seeking any national attention.
So far, their approach has been perfect. The trying atmospheres of Beantown club performances have molded these six men into
a tight and aggressive group with a driving and intense style that has captivated audiences on their current tour of
the U.S.

This six-man group is fronted by vocalist Montgomery, who doubles on forceful harmonica. They vary their performance with a fine
blend of traditional blues, boogie, and rock which is characterized by a distinct body-and-soul ear. The group’s first album has
been a victim of misproduction and shows very little of the band’s live potential. The best things that can be
said about this up-and-coming group are the things that others have had to say about their performances. For example, Alan
Niester, in the Jan. 17 issue of Rolling Stone calls them, "tight and exciting, producing onstage music that is aggressive,
yet self-controlled." In Cashbox magazine, a review of their recent concert with Dave Mason proclaimed that, "an unexpected delight on
the bill was...the exciting James Montgomery Band, [which] turned the audience on with a rousing set." Cashbox went on to
say that "the group tore the house apart..." and that "the band paid careful attention to dynamics and this resulted
in a clean, yet powerful sound."

The James Montgomery Band—they’re not exactly something to write home about—not yet, anyway. But on the basis of the great
things people have been saying about them, it seems Davidson is in for an exciting concert Saturday night. Davidson will
have the opportunity to judge the statement in Cashbox that "It looks...like this band is going all the way."

Students who keep pets during the year should make provision for them at the end of the academic year. Pets
should not be deserted and left to fend for themselves. Care should be taken to find the animal a good
home if the student is not able to keep it. If there is no other possibility, the student should take
the animal to the Animal Shelter. There are responsibilities which we meet in having animals on campus. The pets are
dependent on us and it is our responsibility to see that they get adequate care. However, is there the necessity
of impounding the stray animals which are community property here at Davidson? I can’t imagine a spring afternoon without the
uproar created by the Davidson Forty-one.

There have been rumors circulating on campus about a no-knock search-and-seizure of animals. After talking with Ms. Nicholls, I can
assure you that these rumors are groundless. There is no need to flush your pet down the toilet in order
to get rid of incriminating evidence. There are certain problems that we face because of the Davidson Forty-one. The smell
of wet dog has occasionally made Belk Lounge smell unpleasant. There is a health law that prohibits pets in college
dormitories. We must take responsibility for those animals. If we want the Davidson Forty-one to remain at large, we should
take the responsibility of keeping the animals off the furniture and under control. The Davidson Forty-one are a part of
campus life. Let’s keep them around.

Have you heard the story of Stump, Cop Link, and the pick-up truck?
