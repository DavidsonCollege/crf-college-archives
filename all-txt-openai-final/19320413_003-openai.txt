Demon Deacons Defeat Wildcats in Fast Game

Barnes, of Wake Forest, Bests Pearce in Pitchers’ Duel

In a beautifully played game the Demon Deacons of Wake Forest dropped the Wildcats by a score of 4-1. Except for one bad inning the two teams played near flawless ball. It was in the second stanza that the 'Cats loosened up defensively and committed several miscues that eventually made way for three tallies by the Deacons which netted them the contest. In this second frame Joyner led off for the visitors with a smash to left for a single; then Mulhem bunted to Pearce and Pearce hesitated on the throw, allowing both men to reach first and second safely. Johnson followed with another bunt to third and Bernhardt delayed his peg and the bases were full. Brogen then popped out to Blanton but Joyner scored as Hicks was thrown out at first. Mulhelm tallied on Pearce's wild pitch and Johnson crossed the plate on Barnes’ infield ball. The Deacons scored their other marker in the fourth inning on three hits and an error. The 'Cats tallied after Mathis doubled and made home on Morris’ Texas Leaguer. The defense of both teams clicked in noble fashion, one miscue being charged to each. Both pitchers also worked nicely, Barnes of the Deacons having a shade better of the argument, as he was a bit steadier in the pinches. Barnes fanned nine 'Cats and Pearce whiffed one of the Deacons.

Captain Brannon, Fleagle, McGehee, Earle, and Howard will give the Gobblers a tough fight. McCallie, Pratt, and Little will compete in the hurdle events.
