THE DAVIDSONIAN NEWS MONDAY, AUGUST 29, 1994

Plagued by delays, ’93-’94 Quips and Cranks still not ready
By Carrie Blackburn

The end of August marks the beginning of another school year, but disgruntled students still await the arrival of the
‘93-‘94 Quips and Cranks. Although originally scheduled to be distributed sometime this month, deadline delays have pushed the arrival date
to October 15th. Last year a small staff hampered ’93-’94 Editor-in-Chief Angela Capillary. Even though Capillary worked into the summer,
the yearbook publishing date was pushed farther and farther back. Capillary is now proofing the last few pages, and the
yearbook will be sent to the printer shortly.

This year marks other changes for the yearbook staff. A contract with Walsworth Publishing Company landed the Quips and Cranks
a Macintosh computer and the program Desktop. Previously, the entire book involved a tedious, manual process. Editor-in-Chief of the ‘94-95
staff Amy Liz Betz thinks “it will be a cost-effective way of publishing a yearbook because it saves the company
a lot of time since we do a lot of work for them.” Betz arrived early for the fall semester
to learn the new software. She hopes using Desktop will be an incentive to build a strong staff because the
skills they learn are the ones most magazines and publishers use.

Dr. Ruth, AIDS quilt to visit campus
By Osric Prioleau

Rumor became fact on August 15 when final approval arrived to display the NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt on the
Davidson campus. The Quilt will arrive Thursday, November 10 and will be displayed through Sunday, November 13. Co-Coordinators Sherry Malushizky
and Nat May spearheaded efforts to bring the quilt to Davidson, earning approval from the NAMES Project in San Francisco
and the Charlotte area Quilt Display Coordinator. The NAMES Project Quilt will be displayed in 12 by 12 foot sections,
with 8 panels each. Each panel, roughly the size of a grave, memorializes an individual who has died of AIDS.

Davidson can expect another informative event when Dr. Ruth Westheimer hosts a lecture on sexuality in Love Auditorium November 9.
On November 7 and 8 the Student Health Fair aims to inform students about AIDS. The Fair will be held
in the Union. On November 12, FLAG (Friends of Lesbians and Gays) will sponsor a slide show/fashion show in the
900 room. All proceeds from the show will benefit House of Mercy, Hospice at Charlotte, and the Metroline AIDS Project.

College welcomes 451 freshmen
Frosh continued from page 1

In this class, there are at least 40 senior class presidents, and about 25% of the class was involved in
volunteer literacy programs. Somewhere in the mix is a nationally ranked figure skater, a published poet, a violin virtuoso, and
a cattle rancher. The President of Sri Lanka and the Chinese ambassador to Greenland are probably in there, too. The
money used to bring them here was given to 35% according to need and to 15% according to merit. The
incoming Davidson students get better and better each year, and their desire to enroll says something wonderful about the institution.
Soon, Davidson will hopefully emerge from its unfortunate “Princeton of the South” label and become “Davidson of the World.”

Archivist leaves many memories of long Davidson career
Davidson continued from page 1

Davidson earned his M.A. (1930) and Ph.D. (1942) in history from Harvard University and his master’s in library science from
the University of Chicago (1936). Before joining Davidson’s faculty, he taught for a year each at the Blue Ridge School
for Boys in Hendersonville, N.C., Chamberlain Hunt Military Academy in Port Gibson, M.S., and The Citadel in Charleston, S.C. As
director of three separate library buildings on campus, the Carnegie Library, the Hugh A. and Jane Parks Grey Memorial Library,
and the E.H. Little Library, Davidson oversaw an expansion from 39,000 volumes in 1936 to over 200,000 at his retirement
in 1975. After retiring as professor of history in 1976, Davidson held the position of College Archivist, taking charge of
the Davidsoniana Room and the Rare Book Room.Room. In recognition of his service to the college, the library’s computerized card
catalogue system was christened “CHAL” (Computerized Help At Little) following its installation in 1991. A gifted writer, Davidson authored ten
books and two unpublished manuscripts during his life. His book “Piedmont Partisan,” first published in 1951, is listed as one
of the “One Hundred Outstanding Books About North Carolina.”

In 1993, Davidson received North Carolina’s highest civilian honor, The Order of the Long Leaf Pine, which recognizes those who
exhibit outstanding effort in career and community activities and are of exceptional benefit to the state. Davidson also received the
Charles A. Cannon Award for contribution to North Carolina history (1951), the U.D.C. Military Cross (1970), the Award of Merit
from the North Carolina Society of County and Local Historians (1971), Teacher of the Year by the South Carolina Daughters
of Colonial Wars (1972), and the Davidson College Alumni Service Award (1988).

Davidson resided with his wife, Alice Gage, in the town of Davidson at “Beaver Dam.” Restored in 1975, the home
once belonged to Major William Lee Davidson, Jr. from whom Davidson College acquired the land on which the school now
stands. Davidson is survived by his wife, three children, and four grandchildren. He is buried at the Davidson Family Cemetery
at Rural Hill in Northern Mecklenburg County. Memorials may be made to Davidson College, P.O. Box 1837, Davidson, NC 28036.

Newspapers use. She adds, “It may land you a summer job.” Betz brings other ideas to this year’s book. She
hopes to coordinate the taking of students' photos with the distribution of last year’s books, providing an incentive for everyone
to have his or her picture taken. Betz is excited about her position because “we basically co-edit an entire book
of about 300 pages.” New photography editor Joe Kastell will focus on action photos taken by yearbook staff. Last year
staff members set up picture collection envelopes and even went door-to-door for photos, but student response was low; therefore, certain
groups of people who turned in pictures may be disproportionately represented. Tentatively, an August arrival date is scheduled for next
year’s Quips and Cranks which will be mailed to the class of ’95.
