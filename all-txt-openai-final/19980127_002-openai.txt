On Feb. 3, Wallace D. Mohammed, son of Elijah Mohammed, an Imam (Muslim religious leader) of 2.5 million Muslims in America today, will deliver a public address at Davidson College entitled “What Islam Has To Say About Race Relations in America: A Plan for Our Future.” The address, which will be held in Chambers Gallery at 7 p.m., is expected to attract an audience comparable to the interest shown at other universities, including Yale.

Imam Mohammed is a world-renowned religious leader and humanitarian whose works for the past 23 years have been dedicated to encouraging religious tolerance and establishing understanding and cooperation between Muslims and people of other religions, in order to achieve a peaceful coexistence here and in other parts of the world. Imam Mohammed, who in 1975 was elected as leader of the followers of the Honorable Elijah Mohammed, has also been credited with preserving the good that his father represented and correcting the misconceptions that the Nation of Islam gave to the religion of Islam. He was able to guide his followers from the doctrines of the Nation of Islam to the fundamental teachings of Islam.

Considered the foremost spokesman for Islam in America, Imam Mohammed encourages his followers to actively participate and establish a solid position in the economic, political, social, and educational arena. It is his promotion of human excellence, his representation of the religion of Islam, and his contribution toward building respect for Islamic life in America, that has earned Imam Mohammed countless awards and unprecedented acknowledgments throughout the globe.

“He is highly respected in all Islamic societies,” said Muhammad Ali, while Joshua O. Haberman, Senior Rabbi Emeritus, stated that “Imam W. Deen Mohammed is one of the most enlightened religious leaders in the world today. He played a major role in bringing American Muslims into the mainstream of religious life in the U.S., developing good relations between Muslims and Jews in America.”

According to the Oct. 22, 1996 issue of the Yale Daily News, it was reported that “one of Mohammed’s broader messages was his universal view of religion and how it transcended the distinctions of local concerns and embraced all God-loving people.” Imam Mohammed himself said that “Islam is about man as a human being, not black, not white, not Arab. Islam is a religion of humanity and unity. It should have a place in this new world.”

Some of his most recent achievements and acknowledgments include the following:
- 1996: Imam W. Deen Mohammed and Archbishop William Keeler of Baltimore led a joint U.S. Bishops conference and American Muslims in a delegation to the Vatican, where Imam Mohammed was introduced to Pope John Paul II by Archbishop Keeler.
- Early 1995: He was selected as an International President for the World Conference on Religion and Peace.
- March 1995: He was the keynote speaker for Muslims alongside Rabbi Alexander Schindler, the keynote speaker for Jews in Glencoe, Illinois at the first Muslim-Jewish Convocation.
- December 1994: Imam Mohammed was saluted for his “trailblazing work in improving Muslim, Christian and Jewish relations” by one of America’s oldest and most revered schools of theology, the Hartford Seminary, with their highest and most distinguished “Cup of Compassion Award.”
- January 20, 1993: He was selected to participate as the representative for the religion of Islam in the Inaugural Interfaith Prayer Service as part of the inauguration activities for President Bill Clinton.
- Sept. 10, 1992: He was presented with the highest and most distinguished religious honor of Egypt, “The Gold Medal of Recognition.”
- Feb. 6, 1992: He became the first Muslim representative to deliver an invocation on the floor of the United States Senate.

The following are quotes that typify the profound insights of Imam Mohammed on the topics of racism and community building:
“Race as identity has its life and birth in human identity. If race identity is to form in the right way, it must form in human awareness and in an appreciation for growth in human identity... Race as identity corrupts and dooms us, if it puts itself in our life as an influence more important to us than human consciousness and human excellence. Human aim is a sacred matter... What is hurting minority communities more than anything else is that we are not informed enough and we are not aware of what is going on. In order for a community of people that’s deficient or weak to get strong... they have to open communication lines, not so much with the outside community, but with themselves.”

Involvement spurred by the Volunteer Fair

The Volunteer Fair was held last Tuesday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. in Chambers. A volunteer fair is held at the beginning of the Spring and Fall semesters in order to inform students of the service opportunities available in the community. Tuesday’s fair was attended by 308 students. Approximately 27 community agencies and 17 Reach Out programs were represented at the Fair.

Bill Abrams, Davidson service coordinator, organized the Volunteer Fair. Abrams said that the Fair is “the major time each semester when my office tries to recruit students to work with community agencies. This is the best way to get Davidson students to come out and make decisions about community service.”

Student attendance at Tuesday’s fair was higher than at the Fall fair. Abrams credited increased student involvement in fair publicity with this change. Students from the Service Council, Reach Out, and other organizations helped to promote the event.The Bonner Scholar Program assisted in the publicity efforts, which included placing banners at the entrance to Chambers, having students with poster boards walk around campus during the fair, having students present at the fair, and submitting a letter to the editor. At the fair itself, a festive environment was created by the room decorations and complimentary food. A total of about 20 to 25 students assisted in preparation for the Fair. The outside organizations represented at the fair were primarily from Davidson, Mooresville, Cornelius, and Charlotte. Abrams said, “We are trying in structured programs to have orientation, provide any training needed, and provide evaluation [at the end of the volunteer experience].” According to Abrams, the feedback from the agency representatives who attended the fair was positive. Some of the programs outside of the Town of Davidson recruited fewer volunteers than those located in Davidson. In Abrams’s opinion, this may be because some students are unwilling or unable to drive to Charlotte or outside the immediate Davidson area. Abrams hopes the Volunteer Fair encouraged students to become more involved in the community. “Ideally students come in and the organizations find at least a few students who are willing to take a large role,” said Abrams. “Students need to be challenged and want to be challenged. This is a good opportunity for students to learn lessons which can’t be learned in class.”

Internship Fair offers students wealth of possibilities
By MICHAEL GILLESPIE
Assistant News Editor

Last Thursday night, students gathered in the Union hoping to find an occupation for this summer. The Internship Fair opened some students’ eyes to the possibilities for service projects, and opened others’ to the possibility of travel. Most importantly, however, it was a reminder that summer is approaching all too quickly, and that many of the deadlines for these opportunities are now less than a month away. Ruth Pittard emphasized to the students present that it was important to get any applications submitted as soon as possible. There were several programs that were highlighted at the meeting:

- The Bonner Scholar Community Fund was created to fund community service projects by Davidson students. This money is available to the entire student body, but is only meant to cover the start-up costs of a community service project. Applications for funding are due by Jan. 30.
- The ACES Internship Fund was established to enrich the academic life and assist the career guidance of minority students. It can provide for internships and research as well as travel and study abroad programs. The contact person for this project is Kimberly Wright (x2010). The applications for this program become available Jan. 28 and must be in by Feb. 25.
- The Class of ‘89 Internship is a unique program run by the Coordinator of Community Service. This program gives one or more students the opportunity to construct a personally designed service project and actualize it. The application process for this program begins early in Spring Semester.
- The Duke Endowment Internship Fund provides two paid internships for one male and one female rising junior or senior. It runs during the summer from June 1 to Aug. 1, includes housing on Davidson campus, and offers a reasonable stipend. The applications are mailed out by the Dean of Students’ office and must be completed by Feb. 2.
- The Love of Learning Internships involve being a mentor-counselor for 9th- to 11th-graders for four weeks here on Davidson campus during the summer. The program runs from June 22 to July 25 and also has a small stipend. For more information call Brenda Tapia at x2452. The application can be gotten at any time, but is due Jan. 30 at 5 p.m.
- The Parker Service Project Fund also supports projects by the Davidson students for community service work. Applications are available and can be turned in anytime. Ruth Pittard is in charge of this program. There are, however, limited funds, so applications should be completed soon.
- The Dean Rusk Grant Fund provides funds for student study, service, and learning in other countries. These grants are awarded for merit, but need is also considered. The application requires a definite project plan. These plans should be well-researched, include significant cultural exposure, and propose a reasonable budget. Applications are available in the Dean Rusk office in the Carolina Inn. Summer and Fall project proposals should be turned in by Mar. 18.
- The Stanley Stipend is intended as financial assistance only for students undertaking short-term volunteer work that is directly tied to their Christian faith. Students can receive the stipend for participation in self-designed or organized projects. These applications will be due Apr. 1.
- The Stapleton/Davidson Urban Service Internship Fund helps Davidson students to become involved in the Charlotte area by providing stipends for summer service projects. Internships are available with social services or church-related projects, and are meant to emphasize inner-city involvement and projects. Applications are available but are due Feb. 6.
- Robert T. Stone Internship is provided for students who wish to pursue internships with the community or focusing on the environment. The grants can be applied for at any time. Ruth Pittard is also the person to contact for this program.
