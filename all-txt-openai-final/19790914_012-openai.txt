Artist Series

There will certainly be no lack of cultural opportunity for the Davidson student this year as once again the Artist
Series presents four outstanding attractions.

Heading the schedule is Gilbert & Sullivan’s “The Mikado,” presented by the Manhattan Savoyards on October 30. One of Gilbert
& Sullivan’s most popular operas, “The Mikado,” set in Japan, is a fun type opera that everyone is sure to
enjoy.

Second in the series will be the Charlotte Symphony with Roberta Peters on November 26. Peters is one of the
finest sopranos in the world today.

On January 10, Emlyn Williams, the famous British playwright and actor, will present “Dylan Thomas Growing Up.” It is a
one-man play based on selections from Thomas’ poems and books.

The Ohio Ballet will be the final attraction on March 14. One of the top ballet companies in the country,
they are definitely worth seeing.

Season tickets go on sale for students September 15 for $3.00. Faculty tickets are $8.00 and go on sale September
19; general admission tickets are $15.00 and will begin selling on September 24.

Students may buy tickets for individual performances for two dollars apiece. However, individual tickets will not be on sale until
two weeks before each show, and there’s a good chance they will be sold out. Buy now and be assured
of a seat.
