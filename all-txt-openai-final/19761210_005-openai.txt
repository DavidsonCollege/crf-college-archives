The Davidsonian

Debbie Dillon
Junior

The Hearing Committee serves a vital role in the preservation of the Honor Code and therefore the Davidson way of life. I feel I could best serve the college by being a member of this committee, and would be honored to do so.

Bev Jones
Junior

A Hearing Committee member should be a responsible student valuing the benefits of a working Honor Code and Code of Responsibility, and concerned with providing an objective, fair hearing for any accused offender. I hope you view me as such a student.

Dave Schmidt
Junior

In an election of this type, one cannot make campaign promises or pronouncements that haven’t been made many times in the past. I can only promise to devote the time and effort necessary to do this job properly.

Bill Sigmund
Junior

I feel that the Honor System/Code of Responsibilities is the major component of Davidson College not only because it exists, but also because it works. It is obvious, though, that, in order for it to work, it must be enforced. If elected, I will do my best to continue its enforcement and keep it an integral part of our college life.

Students Seek Committee Positions
By RICHARD E. WASSEN
Staff Writer

The Student Hearing Committee serves as a court of inquiry for cases in which a student is accused of violating either the Honor System or the rules of the college, in order to determine whether or not the student is guilty of the violation; and if so, what sanctions should be applied. All cases are referred to the Hearing Committee by the Dean's office when the case cannot be solved by administrative action. Most cases, then, that reach the Hearing Committee are of a relatively serious nature. The Hearing Committee does have the power to recommend that, if a student is convicted of a violation severe enough, the student be dismissed from the college.

The Hearing Committee is composed of a pool of eighteen students elected from the student body, divided by class in the following manner: nine rising juniors, six rising sophomores, and three rising freshmen. A meeting of the Hearing Committee comprises a panel of six students chosen from the larger pool. This arrangement allows for a necessary amount of flexibility; for instance, in the case where a retrial is necessary and a panel of different students must consider the case.

Particulars about the function of the Hearing Committee can be found in the Davidson College Code of Responsibility and Code of Disciplinary Procedure [1971]: 1976-77. Copies may be obtained in the Dean’s office. Several essential points, however, about the function of the Hearing Committee should be apparent to students in their consideration of the candidates running for the Hearing Committee positions.

The Hearing Committee meets no more than an average of two or three times a year to consider a case. Thus, it is not the quantity of its activity which justifies its function; rather, it is the quality of its judgment and careful consideration on the part of its members in relation to each case which justifies its existence as a part of student self-government.

Since the Hearing Committee considers cases involving not only violations of the Honor System but of college rules as well, a candidate for the Hearing Committee must be a responsible student valuing the benefits of a working Honor Code and Code of Responsibility, and concerned with providing an objective, fair hearing for any accused offender.

David Yandle
Junior

Davidson’s Honor System is its most prized possession and therefore it must be its most guarded possession. I would like to serve Davidson in the capacity of protecting this system through the Hearing Committee.

Hal Askins

No response.

Bill Barnett
Sophomore

I feel that the Honor Code and Code of Responsibility are integral and valuable parts of a student’s rights and privileges at Davidson. I am running for the Hearing Committee to ensure that these rights are insured and are upheld.by all students.

Debbie Jo Bumgarner
Sophomore

The Honor System is a vital part of Davidson life, and it is every student’s responsibility to follow the regulations that accompany the system in order to make it work. The Student Hearing Committee has an important function in that it helps to enforce the rules set by the Honor Code. As a member of the Hearing Committee, I would do my utmost to uphold these rules and regulations and to make the right decisions necessary for the maintenance of the Honor System.

Charlie Cochran
Sophomore

I feel that the Honor Code is a tremendous asset which we benefit from every day, and yet I realize that it does not always work perfectly. However, we have each committed ourselves to this ideal, and I want to serve on the Hearing Committee to help ensure that the Honor Code continues to be effective and beneficial to all of us.

John Harrison
Sophomore

My interest in the Student Hearing Committee reflects my concern for our recognition of the Code of Responsibility. The respect that students have for this code is strong; I am interested in offering my services to a committee dedicated to the perpetuation of this high level of responsibility among students.

Mary Hay
Sophomore

The Honor System is one of the finest institutions of Davidson. As a representative of the students, I can help preserve this system.

David Herrington
Sophomore

I feel like the Honor System is a very important and refreshing outlook here at Davidson College. I want to be on the Hearing Committee in order to have some positive influence in preserving an Honor System that really works.

Steven G. Hull
Sophomore

The Hearing Committee is charged with making important decisions which affect students at Davidson. The necessary qualifications for this position are the capacity for fair and judicious decisions in any case which is heard, an understanding of the letter and intent of the Code of Responsibility and Code of Disciplinary Procedure, and the ability to decide on proper action after weighing the facts and the extenuating circumstances of a case. I feel that I understand the responsibilities of this committee and will be able to function as an effective member.

David Hoffmann
Sophomore

As more and more colleges drop their honor systems, Davidson’s is fast becoming unique. The Honor System is one of the reasons I chose Davidson, and I would like the opportunity to actively assist this important feature of Davidson.

Bruce Lantelme
Sophomore

The Honor System is a vital aspect of our academic and social education. Self-scheduled exams, pledged papers, lack of test supervisors, and unlocked doors all point to the healthiness of our Honor Code. Students must exhibit a high level of maturity and trustworthiness, but in return, it means tremendous respect from faculty, administration, and others of the academic world. I have a deep respect for the Honor Code, and I would very much like to become an integral part of it.
