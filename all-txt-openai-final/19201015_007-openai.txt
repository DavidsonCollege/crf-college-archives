DR. C. ALPHONSO SMITH HAS ENVIABLE RECORD

Is Now Doing Great Work as Instructor of Future Naval Officers.

Charles Alphonso Smith, PhD., LL.D., head of the Department of English at Annapolis since 1917, was born in Greensboro, N.C.,
on June 28, 1864. His father was Dr. Henry Louis Smith, and his mother Mrs. Egbert W. Smith, both well
known in the Southern Presbyterian Church and in the South. He took his A.B. degree at Davidson College in 1884
and his M.A. in 1887. The degree of Doctor of Philosophy was conferred by Johns Hopkins University in 1893, that
of Doctor of Laws by the University of Mississippi in 1905, and by the University of North Carolina in 1913;
that of L.H.D. by the University of Cincinnati in 1916.

Dr. Smith’s work has been that of teacher, lecturer, and author. In the first capacity, he has been instructor of
English at Johns Hopkins University, 1890-93; professor of English Language and Literature at Louisiana State University, 1893-1902; professor of English,
1902-7, head of English Department, 1907-9, dean of Graduate Department 1908-12 at the University of North Carolina; Edgar Allen Poe
Professor of English at the University of Virginia, 1909-17; and since 1917, head of Department of English at the U.S.
Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland. Also, for 1910-11, he was Roosevelt Professor of American History and Institutions at the University of
Berlin.

After studying abroad in 1900-1, Dr. Smith lectured at the Summer School of the South, Monteagle, University of California, University
of Kansas, Chautauqua, and Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences.

Among the books written by Dr. Smith are several on the different phases of English work, of which may be
mentioned “Repetition and Parallelism in English Verse,” “Old English Grammar and Exercise Book,” “Elementary English Grammar,” “Studies in English Syntax,”
and “The American Short Story.” He is also the author of “Die Amerikanische Literatur.”

The list of Dr. Smith’s accomplishments is long, and his present worth is great. Davidson is glad to be able
to number him among her honored sons.
