THE DAVIDSONIAN OPINIONS. MONDAY, NOVEMBER 6, 1995

Manning, manning, bo-banning, banana-nana fo-fanning, me-mi-mo-manning... BOMANNING! Most any Baby Boomer will recall (some with a smile and some with
a groan, no doubt) the 1960s novelty song “The Name Game.” Now that the new campus directory has come out
(and since no one has shot me yet), I have been tempted to play the name game all over again
with our newly published e-mail addresses. It’s so much fun it makes me want to sing. Tutti-frutti, dacerutti, a-wop-bop-aloo-bop, a-wop-bam-boom!
But I digress...

Actually, I have more serious matters to consider, including a major complaint about our online monikers. Is there an appeals
process or are we stuck with what we’ve got? After all, the Book of Proverbs tells us that “a good
name is rather to be chosen than great riches.” So, who chose our names, I ask? I sure didn’t choose
mine. We are assigned a name that uses the first two letters of our first name and the first six
letters of our last, thereby resulting in some of the most awkward names imaginable. And why are staff members restricted
to six letters of their last name while faculty and students get 10? Sounds like alpha-numeric discrimination to me. You'll
be hearing from my lawyers—jagibert, lydaniel, and jablodgett.

Take my nom de screen, for example: jestockd. Just how the heck does one pronounce jestockd? It would be so
much more elegant—and completely unambiguous—if it were jerstock. But no-o-o-o-o. My given name is jestockd. Gesundheit! Perhaps I shouldn’t complain—it
could be worse: krbradbe, krkessle, brsoderb, or cliakob. Of course, there’s little hope for macsikszentm, whether truncated or un. At
least we practice orthographic democracy around here—we are all lower case creatures, as befits our Calvinist heritage.

For a lucky few there is no confusion whatsoever: Ed Kania becomes edkania; Ed Palmer, edpalmer; and Al Mele, almele.
But poor Edna Rimmer undergoes a sex change. Can’t win ’em all, edrimmer. Speaking of confusion... What are all these
new orientations I’ve never heard of before? bi-felty, bi-giduz, bi-drake, bi-lawing, and bi-mahony? And these strange new disorders? co-savage? co-barton?
I don’t know about you, but I’ll just keep on being co-dependent. In some cases we seem to have both
the condition and the cure. What does one do with rocline? I take it for mirhea. And for gasloop? My
doctor recommends myknox. For some things, however, there is no relief in sight.

I am reminded once again to pity our prospective students. First they must attempt to gain admission to Davidson by
going through labrown, lacain, lagarloc, lejones, laligo, lemarsic, lepark, lesargen, lesatter, to name just a few. Leave it to the
French to confuse us over gender matters. But I am relieved to know that in our efforts to become more
international we have not forgotten our Scotch-Irish Appalachian roots. There’s a whole Ma and Pa Kettle cohort on campus, so
many that I cannot name them all and so politically correct that no one can tell their gender either: mabenson,

macampbell, mahyde, mabenson, macampbell, mahyde, mabCostarred on this short-lived series about a group of ordinary people with not-so-ordinary psychic powers.
Of course, they use their abilities to fight crime.

The Bloodhound Gang. This adept gang solved crimes in knit bell-bottoms. Not a show in itself, the Bloodhound Gang was
a segment of "3-2-1 Contact" on PBS — the only channel my parents let me watch for years.

Little House on the Prairie. This wholesome program featured Michael Landon as the versatile Pa Ingalls: faithful father, tender husband,
carpenter, farmer, mentor, sometime doctor, and town psychologist. Nellie and her mom were terrors, but Almonzo (aka Manly) was amazing.

Today, we have to deal with eight hours a day of annoying Bob Saget on America’s Funniest Home Videos and
Urkel on Family Matters. No wonder we’re all so stressed out! TV used to be relaxing, but now it is
just irritating. I mean, how many times can they show the Saved By The Bell in Hawaii episode? I’ve had
enough of Kelly Kapowski hula dancing! Something must be done! No more Baywatch Nights — bring back Knight Rider!

We also have some names that are clearly throwbacks to an earlier, less enlightened era, you know, Me Tarzan, You
Jane: meharris, mekimmel, meovercash... but hebuckley. And we have some names that would look and sound right at home in
“Jabberwocky”: glindsey, gwappley, ronorfle, and tonorwoo. Speaking of high culture, what about romorrow, and ronutt? Who’s speaking here, the dog
Astro from the Jetsons?!? Rould roorike aronutt? Rotrow, raybe romorrow.

There’s even information to help our law enforcement community, if only they'd follow the clues right before their noses. I
don’t understand what’s all the fuss about the Unabomber and why the FBI can’t track him down. He’s hiding out
right here on campus and calling himself bomckill.

But the most valuable information of all? The e-mail directory is a great place to look for a date. Let’s
see, here... You know, just on a whim I'd like to go out with someone named caprice. Or how about
kisanderson? That sounds promising. Oops. I just dropped my modem and it went kaplank! Keep looking, getting warmer. Hmmm... I
wonder what paperoni likes on her pizza? What would you drink on a date with beervin? Dry or ice? Red
or white? Maybe she wouldn't be able to make up her mind. I guess I’ll just break out desherri. Would
aningram mix my name up? Would I have a good time or bad time with malinvil? Sounds foreboding... I bet
shmalush would be a great date for the Iditarod. Who knows? We might get besnowde. Eureka! alwright! Now, I'm getting
hot. I think I'll dial up afoxx. Yeah, that’s the ticket... Phooey! I just dropped my coke and it went
phsprink! all over my leg. Maybe I’d better quit while I'm ahead.

Habitat is about people

I walked into the small home on Potts Street in Davidson unsure of what to expect and was amazed by
what I saw. Beautiful plants graced the corners of the room, a fish tank murmured in the background, and a
bird sang in its cage — the scene seemed right out of Better Homes & Gardens.

“I’ve always had a green thumb,” Nina O’Brian said, glancing at the foliage. “And green toes, and green everything! I
really love working with plants.”

She is an amazing woman who stands up for her rights and sticks to her guns. “My friends describe me
as ‘funky’ and ‘feisty.’ I am definitely very independent,” she admitted. Nina certainly needs her strength as she struggles to
raise her children, Amy and Nicholas, as a single mother. But her fight was helped greatly by a very special
program.

“They called me,” she remembered. “A friend had told them about our situation, and the board members called and told
me about Habitat. Without the Habitat program, it would have been virtually impossible for me to buy a house on
my own.” After a rigorous application process, the family was accepted as candidates. In May of 1991, the O’Brians moved
into a house sponsored by the Davidson affiliate of Habitat for Humanity International.

“They didn’t give us anything for free,” Nina emphasized. “We worked our butts off for this house, which took almost
a year to build. It’s like my grandfather said: ‘I'll help you if you’re willing to help yourself.’”

Nina is noticeably excited about the organization and hopes more people find out about it. “Everyone who doesn’t know about
it absolutely should get involved in some way — you learn so much from it,” she said. “It’s very much
a community effort.” She is also glad about the Habitat House Committee being formed at Davidson College. “The college kids
really do influence the community. Except for taking up all of the parking spaces downtown, the students have a positive
impact on Davidson,” Nina said.

Her life has been very difficult, and from her experiences she has gained her powerful will and “Roseanne” attitude. Nina
grew up in Lynchburg, Virginia, later moved to Florida, and finally to Davidson. Through it all, Nina has learned to
stand up for herself and not let anyone treat her badly. One can easily detect her strong character and will.
She is a very open, determined, and courageous woman attempting to survive as a single mother, taking things day by
day. She simply hopes for her children to grow up happy and healthy. Nina, Amy, and Nicholas O’Brian will continue
pushing forward, with some help from Habitat for Humanity along the way.
