Beyond Davidson  
By ED POWELL

Economy—Unemployment rose from 5.4% to 5.6% in August, possibly as a sign of a slowdown in the economic expansion of the last 6 years. 219,000 new payroll jobs were added in August, but that figure is less than half that of June. Stock and bond markets have rallied in the last week, as slowed down economic growth has eased fears of soaring interest rates. It may be that the move by Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve to edge the interest rates up earlier this summer has indeed been effective in controlling inflation, at least it appears.

Elections—Since the Republican National Convention in New Orleans, Vice President George Bush has made up a 17-point deficit and pulled even with Democratic nominee, Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis, in the latest national polls on the Presidential race. Most political analysts believe that Governor Dukakis must make some significant moves in the next three weeks if he is to regain his lead. At the end of last week, Dukakis rehired his former campaign manager John Sasso to serve as campaign vice chairman. Sasso resigned last year during the primaries in the wake of controversy surrounding his release of video tapes that damaged the reputation of then Presidential hopeful, Senator Joe Biden of Delaware. The videos called into question the authenticity of some of Biden’s speeches and Biden withdrew his name from the race soon after their release.

Closer to home, Davidson graduate Governor Jim Martin is gearing up for his reelection campaign against Democratic Lt. Governor Robert Jordan. Things look good for Martin as unemployment is way down and he has enjoyed a prosperous four years in office. As the incumbent, he is the early favorite, but unlike in 1984, he probably won’t be able to ride the coattails of Bush like he did President Reagan’s. Reagan carried much more weight in '84 than Bush will come November. One small note, of registered voters in North Carolina, Democrats outnumber Republicans 2 to 1.

Agriculture—Fires continue to burn out of control in the west, particularly in Yellowstone Park in Wyoming. The blazes have covered 910,000 acres, nearly a fourth of all the acreage of Yellowstone Park. Officials estimate the cost of putting out the fires to exceed 30 million, not to mention their loss from a 30% drop in tourists in the month of August. The extremely dry summer is to blame for the spread of the blazes.

Other—Jim Bakker is still trying to regain PTL. On Monday he claimed to be close to meeting the 150 million dollar asking price for PTL, but stated that he still needed a few more investors to raise the remainder of the money.

- Forty-six people were killed and 500 others injured when three Italian military jets collided and crashed to the ground at an air show in Ramstein, West Germany, about 60 miles from Frankfurt. A crowd of about 300,000 had gathered to watch the annual air show when a piloting error caused one of the planes to collide with two others during a difficult fly-past maneuver. In response to the tragedy, already labeled one of the worst crashes in air show history, the West German Government has suspended indefinitely any further military air shows.

- The Soviet Union destroyed three SS-20 nuclear missiles in a symbolic start to the elimination of its intermediate nuclear weapons force. The missiles were the first group of SS-20’s to be eliminated under the terms of the U.S.-Soviet INF Treaty signed in December by President Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev, which provides for the gradual elimination of all ground-launched and medium-range nuclear weapons.from the superpower’s nuclear arsenals.
 
Less than a month after its negotiation, the U.N. Iran-Iraq cease-fire resolution is deadlocked over the Iraqi demand that Iran guarantee unhindered navigation for Iraqi ships in the Persian Gulf and that Tehran re-open the vital Shatt al-Arab waterway that is Iraq’s only outlet to the sea. Iran responded claiming Iraq’s allegations were ridiculous and outside the realm of the current round of peace talks. The U.N. resolution was enacted to bring about peace in the Gulf region and to end the 8-year Iran-Iraq war; U.N. General Secretary Javier Perez de Cuellar hopes that the current differences can be resolved and negotiations resumed.

Protests broke out in Santiago and other regions in Chile last week over the nomination of Augusto Pinochet as the sole nominee in the country’s presidential referendum scheduled for October 5. Opposition fears the continuation of the repressive Pinochet regime; if the leader is re-elected, he will continue in office until 1997. Pinochet has ruled Chile’s military-backed government since the 1973 coup which ousted the Marxist Allende regime.

Lech Walesa, leader of the Polish labor force, met formally with government officials to discuss the legalization of the Polish Solidarity movement. The meetings, the first since Solidarity was outlawed by the government in 1982, were prompted by a wave of nationwide strikes intended by labor leaders to force their government into negotiations. Walesa subsequently halted the strikes late last week when Polish officials agreed to address the status of Solidarity in exchange for an end to the 20 days of labor unrest.

The pullout of the U.S. missile cruiser USS Vincennes from the Persian Gulf was abruptly delayed after at least one Arab government raised last-minute objections to its departure. The Vincennes, responsible for the July downing of an Iranian Airbus, was scheduled to leave Persian Gulf waters for the U.S. Sunday. Military sources estimate that the Vincennes will remain in its present station for at least five more days. Reducing Gulf force from 27 to 26 ships, the Vincennes will represent the first cutback of U.S. naval forces in the Persian Gulf since the Iran-Iraq cease-fire went into effect in August.

U.S. negotiations to forge a new agreement on U.S. airbases in Greece ground to a halt Tuesday after the Greek government announced it will close the U.S. Air Force installation in Athens. The suspension comes as the U.S.-Greek defense agreement on the presence of such bases is about to expire. Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou stated Tuesday his country will consider signing another military bases agreement in exchange for U.S. intervention in certain areas such as the long-running Greek-Turkish dispute.
