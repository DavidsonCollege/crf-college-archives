**THE DAVIDSONIAN SPORTS | TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 17, 1998**

**In Focus With: Frank Santore ‘81, “The Voice of the ‘Cats”**

On Saturday, Nov. 7, Davidsonian Sports Staff member, Stephen Cefalu sat down and spoke with legendary Davidson Wildcats radio sportscaster Frank Santore. Santore is entering his fourth season as the “Voice of the ‘Cats.” Catch his play-by-play coverage of Wildcat basketball on 105.3 WAGI-FM (Gaffney, S.C.) each and every game day on campus.

**DSS: What originally brought you to Davidson?**

**SANTORE:** I came to Davidson in 1977 to play football, but found out my freshman year that they didn’t need any 5' 9," slow offensive linemen. It really devastated me. It was sort of an identity crisis for me after I quit playing. It was the only thing I ever quit.

**DSS: How did you do academically while you were at Davidson?**

**SANTORE:** I really thought I was gonna come here and set the world on fire, but it was tough. I found a lot of torture in my studies. I graduated with a 2.7 average. So, for those who are having a difficult time at Davidson, and battling it, I say, “There’s life after college. There’s life after Davidson.” I’m always saying, “Get rid of your books, come out and watch a basketball game,” because you will find when you're age 39 or 40 that you wish you could’ve done half the stuff you had an opportunity to do when you were age 19 or 20.

**DSS: In general, how would you characterize the student body at Davidson?**

**SANTORE:** Without intending to offend anyone, there’s something I just don’t understand about Davidson. Everybody is so uptight around here. It was the case when I was in school, and it’s the case right now. Everybody walks around with their nose in a book. College is so much more than having your nose stuck in a damn book 24 and 7. Why can’t students take 2 or 3 hours out on a Monday night (to watch the ‘Cats in Belk Arena)? It’s not gonna kill them. What’s wrong with people here? It’s utterly ridiculous. People gotta realize what a great thing they have here. We need everybody. I would love to see the day when we’re averaging 4,000-4,500 fans a game.

**DSS: How did you first get into broadcasting?**

**SANTORE:** Two years out of law school in 1987, I was sitting at home with my Dad having lunch, and watching TV, and there was a talk show on with a guy who ran the Sportscasters Camps of America. I always had this yen to be a sportscaster, to be a radio play-by-play guy. I called the guy up. They were holding a session in Atlanta. (So, I went.)

**DSS: Who has most influenced you as a broadcaster?**

**SANTORE:** Larry Munson. When I went down to Atlanta (to the Sportscasters Camp), lo and behold, there he was, my idol, Larry Munson, the voice of the Georgia Bulldogs. He’s got a deep, gravelly voice. What this guy did for twenty-some-odd years is what I do now. He’d do a high school football game in Tennessee on a Friday night, drive wherever he had to get for an SEC game on Saturday, pull in some place, get 4 hours sleep, have a cup of coffee, go over his notes, go to the stadium, do the game, beat the traffic out and try to get back by midnight so that he could go out and shoot hunting or fishing films until midnight on Sunday. I pattern myself after Larry Munson, my idol.

**DSS: What’s most alluring to you about the radio broadcasting profession?**

**SANTORE:** In radio, you are the people's eyes and ears. TV is too simple. Anyone can do that. It’s tougher when you have to sit there and paint the picture for the radio audience. It’s an absolute craft. People turn down the sound on ESPN and turn you up, not necessarily because you’re great, but because they identify your voice with the team they follow.

**DSS: Would you say you get an emotional high from considering how far your voice travels?**

**SANTORE:** After doing the game, I feel like I’ve had some really good sex. (You can print that).

**DSS: What are some of your most memorable moments in broadcasting?**

**SANTORE:** (The text cuts off here, so the answer is not available.)

With Frank Santore's famous calls:

SANTORE: “Slam, bam, thank you, ma’am,” after Brandon Williams (‘96) stuffed home the ball in the closing seconds of overtime to cement a critical game against Furman in 1996. Afterwards, a female faculty member went to the Athletic Director and said the phrase disparaged women, but I wasn’t thinking about any of that. At least someone from the faculty was listening to the broadcast.

“Glory, hallelujah! You can paint it red and black,” after Ali Ton stole the ball to seal a huge victory over Ole Miss in 1996. Since then, it’s become my signature call for every Davidson win.

“Cinderella, put on your glass slippers. We’re going to the ball,” when we won the Southern Conference final last year. All this stuff happens spontaneously. I don’t sit back and think, “Well, what types of ‘ad-libs’ can I come up with to impress people.”

DSS: What can you say about the growth of your listening audience since you’ve been on the air?

SANTORE: We've expanded this radio network like you wouldn’t believe. Five years ago, nobody could pick up Davidson basketball. Now you can pick it up on 20 stations in 6 states. When you’re driving from point to point in a car, you almost never have to worry about losing the Davidson basketball game on the radio. We’re continually trying to blow our coverage further and further out into the night, and unite our fan base. We are a light hidden under a basket, and I’ve been trying to take that light out from underneath the basket for four years now.

DSS: How would you describe your relationship with Davidson College’s athletic department?

SANTORE: Neither Jim Murphy (Davidson College Athletic Director), nor Bob McKillop (Wildcat men’s basketball head coach), nor Tim Landis (Wildcat football head coach), nor any other coach or anybody in the athletic department has ever come to me and said, “We want to dictate how you do your play-by-play.” I’ve been given a tremendous amount of freedom to do my job how I like. The athletic department here doesn’t get nearly the respect it deserves. I give Terry Holland (former Davidson College Athletic Director) his due, but Jim Murphy has done more for Davidson in two and a half years than Terry Holland could’ve ever thought of doing in five. The Board of Trustees has to be more appreciative of the athletic department. I know there’s only so much they can do, but it’s the little things that matter. They have to do whatever they can, within reason, to make sure people in the athletic department are happy. They shouldn’t squeeze pennies. They shouldn’t close their hearts. It’s vitally important that we have an athletic department that succeeds, because that’s the way we get this school known in 50 states, and not just the South Atlantic region.

DSS: What’s your prognosis for the 1998-99 Wildcat men’s basketball team?

SANTORE: We’re gonna have to get a step-up guy like Mark Donnelly was. It’s gonna be Ben Ebong, Ben “the Big Dog” Ebong. The man has enormous pride in himself. He’s a guy that’s not satisfied with his glass three-quarters full. Ben Ebong is gonna have a big season, and I’m not just talking about points; I’m talking about leadership. I have no doubt that he’ll step it up. And the rest of the guys? I think they’ll follow.

DSS: What can you say about Bob McKillop?

SANTORE: Other than my father, I respect Bob McKillop more than any other man that I’ve ever met. He is a morally upright man. He is honest and straightforward. I want to live in a world full of Bob McKillops, full of morally upright people.
