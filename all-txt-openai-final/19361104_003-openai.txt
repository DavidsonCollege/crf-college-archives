DAVIDSON PROFESSORS GOING TO CONFERENCE HELD AT GREENSBORO

Meeting to Open With Dinner At O. Henry Hotel Thursday Night

TO DISCUSS EDUCATION

Prominent Speakers to Address Conference

A number of members of the Davidson faculty are making plans to attend the annual meeting of the North Carolina College Conference on November 5 and 6 in Greensboro. The conference will open its activities with a dinner meeting Thursday at the O. Henry Hotel and is scheduled to close sometime early in the afternoon on Friday.

The general theme of the conference is “The Articulation and Integration of Higher Education.” During the course of the meetings, there will be discussions of the junior college, senior college, and graduate school. Several prominent speakers have been announced as the outstanding feature of these programs.

Davidson is well represented on the standing committees of the conference which attend to the major business of the organization. Members of these committees are most likely the ones who will go to the conference. Dr. Frazer is chairman of the committee on admissions, while other committeemen are Dr. I. J. Jackson, Student Relationships, Prof. Hood, College Collaboration with the State Department of Public Instruction, and Dr. P. H. Gwynn, Athletics. As practically all of the larger colleges in the state are members, the sponsors of the conference are expecting a large attendance in Greensboro.

Tryouts To Be Held

Plans for the freshmen debating try-outs, which will be held sometime during the first week in December, have now gotten underway, it was announced by Charlie Mauze, freshmen debate manager. The subject for debate will be the same as that used by varsity debaters: “Resolved: That Congress should be given the right to set minimum wages and maximum hours for industry.”

To date, about twenty-five men have signed up as candidates, and from this number, four regular debaters and two alternates will be chosen. The try-out will be held in the Eu Hall, about December 2. It has been definitely decided that the team will make one debating trip, and that there will be as many as two home debates. Material on the subject for debate has been made available in the library, and all freshmen who are interested in coming out are urged to do so.

BAND TO PLAY TWO CONCERTS BEFORE GAME

Homecoming Game to Feature Novel Step and Formation By Band

WILL PRESENT MASCOT

Vernon Lassiter, Jr., to March

In the morning, a concert before the game, a Spanish step to Ravel’s Bolero, an airplane formation, and a three-year-old mascot will all feature the Davidson College band’s day on Homecoming.

The Saturday morning concert will be played at 11:30 in Chambers auditorium. Then at 2:00 in the afternoon, a thirty-minute program at the stadium will precede the Davidson-Carolina game. This will be the first band in the state to use concert music on the field. During the half, a special Spanish step will be exhibited as the band plays Ravel's Bolero. Then various formations will follow: an airplane with the drum majors’ whirling batons for propellers and the beating of the drum for a motor; a “C” for Carolina; and a “D” for Davidson.

Vernon Clarke Lassiter, Jr., of Winston-Salem, three-year-old son of Mr. J.C. Pohl, director of the Davidson band, will be presented with the band as a mascot. Although small in size, Vernon has learned to march and keep in step in a regular uniform.

COUNCIL TO DONATE CUP FOR BEST DECORATIONS

This Custom Will Be Innovation For Davidson

Unusual as it may seem, the fact that there will be an adequate number of decorations to take care of the last dance of the Homecoming celebration is a new custom in the institution. The council has decided to donate a cup for the best decorations among the fraternities. This will be the first time such a thing has been done at Davidson.

Pictures of Faculty, Teams, and Fraternity Groups to Be Made Later

Miss Sue Hughes of Dunbar and Daniel arrived last Thursday, October 29, with the picture proofs of the student body. By now, the students have selected their proofs, which were returned to the Raleigh studio this morning. The photographer will be here in two weeks to take pictures of the faculty, teams, and fraternity groups.Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:
