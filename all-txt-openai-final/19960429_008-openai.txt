Emotions of Christianity
Greg Garrison

At last week’s SGA meeting, the word “hate” was tossed around a good bit in reference to Christianity. Christianity, however, is based on the belief in love as the ultimate reality. Since love and hatred are mutually exclusive, I invite you to step back from the situation with me, and let’s look at some of Christianity’s basic assertions so that each of us can decide if they sound loving or hateful.

Christianity asserts that each of us is created by God but that we deny him. This denial of God stains us like a dye. Because he is perfect and therefore cannot be united with anything that opposes his perfection, God must separate himself completely from those stains. This creates a chasm between God and us, and we can do nothing to bridge the chasm because everything we do is stained. This separation from God causes death, which is why life is often tragic, meaningless, and lifeless.

Christianity asserts that a man named Jesus was God with skin on, that he sweated, took naps, belched, laughed, and understands us fully. Do you ever feel like you’ve got too much work to do and can’t go on? Do you feel like no one understands what you mean sometimes? Do you feel like your family won’t let go of you and doesn’t trust you? Do you feel like people talk trash about you that’s not true? Do you hurt when your friends betray you and treat you like dirt? Do you feel pain, frustration, anger, and loss? So did Jesus.

Christianity asserts that Jesus was crucified so that he could suffer the effects of our denial of God. In other words, on the cross he took all of our stains upon himself, became completely separated from God, and died. If you trust in Jesus’ work on the cross, then absolutely nothing can separate you from God again. No matter what you do, God looks at you and sees Jesus, instead of your stains. God gives you a new life, places his spirit inside you, and empowers you to grab that life with both hands and to live it fully and joyfully.

Christianity asserts that God is stronger than death, that Jesus burst from his tomb, triumphant over our stains. Jesus offers each of us the opportunity to have a living relationship with his own, perfect dad, who loves us furiously and passionately, exactly as we are. He looks us straight in the eyes and whispers, “You know how much I love you?” He stretches out his arms as far as they will reach, lets us see his scarred wrists, smiles broadly, and says, “I love you this much. I’d rather die than live without you.” This is Jesus. This is Christianity. I challenge you to consider its assertions and decide for yourself: Is this love or hatred?

Law or arbitrary justice?

I am writing to offer some thoughts on the recent 16 to 15 vote of the Student Government Association against renewal of InterVarsity Christian Fellowship’s charter. I am of the belief that the SGA’s decision is in conflict with its stated by-laws, but I do not write to argue that point. Rather, I want to encourage thought on the matter of Lex Rex.

Lex Rex means law is king. As the late writer and thinker Francis Schaeffer says in his book How Should We Then Live?, Lex Rex means that we can “be ruled by law rather than the arbitrary judge of men and [there can] be wide freedoms without chaos” (216). America is a country founded upon, and slipping away from, the principle of Lex Rex. We gain certain freedoms (to have and to hold property, for example) when we relinquish others (like the freedom to steal) to the rule of law. Thus, greater freedom comes not by a casting off of the rule of law but by submission to wisely written and administered laws.

“... current sociological good is king.” I fear, though, that the SGA decision is an example of Rex Lex, which means the king rules over law and “arbitrary judgment concerning current sociological good is king” (Schaeffer 218). So I ask you to consider whether you believe that the SGA’s decision was in keeping with the established by-laws. If not, why have we cast off the rule of law? I encourage you to think about whether Lex Rex and its implications for communal life are important to you.

I would like to close with some thoughts from Schaeffer, who advises modern women, men, and Davidson students with a lesson from ancient Greece. “The Greeks found that society [itself] ... was not a strong enough final authority to build upon, and it is still not strong enough today. If there are no absolutes, [then we must choose between] either the chaos of hedonism or the absoluteness of the 51-percent vote, [because] only one other alternative is left: one man or an elite, giving authoritative arbitrary absolutes. Here is a simple but profound rule: If there are no absolutes by which to judge society, then society is an absolute” (224).

Much of the discussion on campus around the issue of IVCF’s charter has been characterized by a sentiment that is best represented by Ravi Jain’s quote in the Charlotte Observer on April 25, 1996. Jain said that the campus “no longer wants to have religion as its center” and that “a seemingly small issue of sexual orientation” is taking precedence.

The United States of Philip Morgan hold property, for example) when we relinquish others (like the freedom to steal) to the rule of law. Thus, greater freedom comes not by a casting off of the rule of law but by submission to wisely written and administered laws.

treatment of all as one of the central ends of religion itself.

Our search for meaningful dialogue

I would like to describe to you an experience I shared last semester that I think is relative to the discussion on campus and particularly to questions, concerns, and issues that were raised at Wednesday night’s open forum on religion at Davidson. Last semester I had the great fortune of being involved in a group that met weekly to discuss Christianity. This was not a typical Christian Bible study as many sponsored by Christian organizations on campus. Membership was composed of individuals, some of whom would call themselves agnostic, atheist, Muslim, Christian, and “just unsure.” While our study centered around the Christian faith, it was in many respects a simultaneous study of Islam, atheism, and agnosticism. Meeting with this group was one of the most valuable and most challenging learning experiences I have had in my four years at Davidson. As I look closely to see what it was that made our interaction so, I come up with four things: God’s blessing, realness, commitment, and listening.

Not everyone in the group would agree with me on the first point. It is my own personal conviction that God calls us to loving, meaningful, honest relationships. This study group I believe embodied that, and therefore was blessed in its time together. It is my hope and belief that the others would, however, agree with me on the last three points.

First of all, we were committed to gathering together. Once we got started we met every week school was in session for two-, sometimes three-hour meetings. We never did anything so unnecessary as to take attendance but the same eight or nine people were there every week.

Commitment, realness, and careful listening are missing from many of my own friendships, and I think they are missing from many friendships on this campus.

Secondly, we were real with each other. We shared our lives with each other. Because we had not known each other previously, real did not happen the first week; that is (point three) why our commitment was so important. But we were able to arrive at a point that any protest, doubt, fear, or conviction was welcome and received with thoughtful and careful (full of caring not tiptoeing) consideration. Here is where the fourth point is so crucial — listening. We were able to be vulnerable, to be real and honest, and to go places with our discussion otherwise off limits because we listened to each other. “Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry” (James 1:19). This is perhaps the wisest counsel I have encountered, and we made every attempt to heed it. I want to make the point that I am not talking about the politically correct, fuzzy feeling listening that so many expect to result in agreement and acceptance. Real listening more often reveals as many differences as similarities. Its worth is that it leads to understanding, and when we understand each other better we may speak more wisely and care more thoroughly. The listening, realness, and commitment that occurred in our group also fostered respect that then allowed us to disagree and not alienate, to love but not always accept.

In the open forum on religion at Davidson in Phi Hall Wednesday night many themes were repeated: minority religious groups feeling stifled by the overwhelming Christian majority, a lack of understanding between different groups, a need for (the ever-popular buzzword) “dialogue.” As I sat listening, few solutions were offered. So my question and I think many peoples’ question was, “How does sharing, learning, and understanding take place between a majority group and minority groups?” Some students offered that the five or six Christian organizations welcome people of different backgrounds to join them and desire that the experience be a true exchange. However, others protest that being welcomed and feeling welcomed were two different things. They pointed out the tremendous intimidation a lone (for example) Buddhist student feels walking into a room of worshipping Christians and the barriers that exist in that situation. Someone suggested the need for the “majority” to go to the “minority.” This is difficult because there is no official Muslim, Jewish, Buddhist, atheist, etc. student organization to approach. So we still have yet to arrive at this “dialogue.”

I am thankful that we have open forums, discussion dinners, and faculty-student committees devoted to important campus issues. These things play an important and vital role in building a healthy open community, and I hope they continue. However, I am fully convinced that without meaningful interaction between individuals, topical group lunches, SGA resolutions, and study committees are absolutely worthless. The open forum will not have brought us a step from where we were if we do not make the conscious and active decision to invest ourselves in each other. This solution is dissatisfying in many ways because it is not something you can legislate into being; it is not something you can measure or document to be assured of progress; there is no definitive goal to be reached; and, it is not something we can bring closure to and mark off the list. But how can we sit and listen to each other in that forum and not be compelled to seek each other out?

I present the group experience I had last semester as a model for what our interaction with each other should look like. Commitment, realness, and careful listening are missing from many of my own friendships, and I think they are missing from many friendships on this campus. If we truly desire this meaningful dialogue so often referred to, we need to examine how we engage others and to realize that more important than how groups relate to groups is how people relate to people.
