UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA GAME

The “Wildcats” annihilated the University of Georgia, Thursday, by the score of 8 to 3. Rufus Clarke pitched an air-tight game all the way through. His control was perfect, and his fastball was a complete puzzle to the slugging Georgians as his seven strike-outs show. Although Clarke plays first base regularly, and pitching is only a sideline with him, his pitching was excellent and far superior to that of Westbrook, captain and first-string pitcher of the Cracker team.

All of Georgia’s runs were due to errors, but the “Wildcats” offset these misplays by hitting the ball hard, and at the right time. Boswell and Flowers were the chief sluggers for the Presbyterians. For Georgia, Mott’s fielding was good, and Hargrett’s three-base wallop was the only real batting that the Georgians were able to show. The score:
