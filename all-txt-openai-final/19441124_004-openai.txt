Dance Proclaimed Successful By All

The first dance of the school year was held last Saturday night at the Firemen’s Hall in Charlotte. The festivities
were sponsored by the Pan-Hellenic Council and dancing was enjoyed from 8 until 12. Shirley Smith and his orchestra, obtained
from Winston-Salem, furnished the music which everyone agreed was very good. During the course of the evening, there were four
ho-break dances, not including a special dance for those participating in the figure. Immediately preceding the intermission, the figure was
held and a large ‘D’ was formed. Then followed the special Pan-Hellenic dance. Those included in the figure were Jimmie
Love and Pat Hole, Martin Waters and Charlotte Blanton, Bob Brooks and Nancy Blanton, George Gunn and Grace Lyons, Bruce
Fisher and Scottie Nisbet, Phil Whittier and Edna Adams, Jack Lazenby and Lib Andrew, L. G. Turner and Katherine McLeod,
Bill McBride and Sara Cooksey, Frank Barr and Janis Barrier, Earle Mahone and Margie Vickers, and Jim Alexander and Mary
Jane Love. For many students, it was their first Davidson dance and we are glad to say that the dance
was very successful and a good time was had by all.

THIS MIGHT BE YOU

“What do you delve from this?” you ask. My answer is none, except the fiendish feeling of having power over
him. Also, this may gain her social significance by being a “man-twister”. These are not of the types of women
but I thought I would bring to you the most important examples of the “weaker” sex. If you would care
to read more about the subject, read my new book, The Whims and Fangs of Women or I Wake Up
Screaming. For the most part, I can say that I have thoroughly enjoyed my study of the female sex although
the food in this sanitarium isn’t very good. But don’t laugh—This might be you.

MOORESVILLE LICKED

Broyles pitching and Fletcher or nobody catching. Near the end of the third period, Bryant quick-kicked 35 yards. Substitutes poured
onto the field as the fourth quarter began and it proved pretty even and uneventful for the most part. But
Lasley scored with 2 minutes left to go on a nice run. Medford added the final tally and Davidson led
33-0.

SERVICES

(Continued from Page 1)

The final Chapel service on Thursday was built around the story of Jesus’ healing the blind man. By this story,
we are taught to have confidence in religion. This blind man was willing to obey Christ; even in blindness, he
relied upon his faith in Christ when questioned, and he worshipped Christ. By obeying, following, and worshipping Jesus Christ, we
too can come to the point where we can say “...one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now
I see.” A communion service on Thursday night concluded the Fall services. With a large audience present, Dr. Richardson brought
his message on the “Four Great Realms of Thought”. Simply, they can be summed up in this way: “God is
love; He loves the world; and He loves me.” The text for this was John 3:1-21, and Galatians 2:20.

THIS and THAT

(Continued from Page 1)

As to where we are going, we do not know that even ourselves. All we know is that we are
to take a third term at some other school. We have made many friends here at Davidson and to those
friends we now say “Good-bye and good luck”. Auf Wiedersehen.
