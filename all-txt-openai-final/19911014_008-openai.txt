THE DAVIDSONIAN

_OPINIONS

MONDAY, OCTOBER 14, 1991

The Davidsonian asked students whether they thought enough was being done to include minority groups in the "Davidson experience."

No, I don’t think enough is being done, but I think it's the students’ responsibility, individual students, to go ahead and get to know a lot of people who are not the same as them and I think it’s really important for you yourself to try and reach out to other people. I don’t think it's the responsibility of the school itself to encourage it, but I think that it’s a good thing for them to encourage it through events like the international festival. I think that’s really good, but I think individuals need to take initiative to get to know those around them.

Rachel Starmer, '93

I think that people need to be aware that black students at Davidson do have their own culture, their own lingo, their own tastes, and when they do coalesce in groups, that it's not a result of trying to segregate themselves, but just to be together to share these things that they have in common. But I think that the international festival was a great thing, for people to give the minorities and the foreign students a chance to celebrate their culture, to celebrate their way of life.

No, I really don’t think enough is being done. I think that we should do more things like the international festival and things that stress intercultural interaction, not just things like black history month for blacks to celebrate themselves, I mean that’s great, but for everyone to get a chance to interact and to mix and to work on things together; common projects. No, I really don’t think that enough is being done. The little diversity that does exist at Davidson is not being taken advantage of.

I'm a freshman. The guys on my hall are real nice, we get along. Me and my roommate Frank, we’re the only two black guys on the hall besides our hall counselor Anthony Foxx. There doesn't seem to be any friction between us, but as far as racial and ethnic understanding, it just comes with interaction. I don’t know how much the school can do to promote that type of interaction.

George Spain, '95

The problem that I have with Davidson when you’re talking about bridging the gap between different races is the controversy over black students having their own black male fraternity. The white students always ask “why do you need your own fraternity?” White fraternities just don’t meet the needs of black students here on campus. And they also ask “Well, why do you have the BSC?” As the minority on this campus we need something where we can all come together and be together and really feel like we do belong somewhere on this campus. I’m not saying that we always feel like we’re outcasts in classrooms, but sometimes we do feel that way and after a while you kind of want to feel comfortable around people you can really relate to.

Beryl Thomas, '94

Yes, I think enough is being done at the present time to help race relations.

TOM THE DANCING BUG

WHEN I FIRST FOUND OUT, I WAS SO CONFUSED. THE DOCTOR'S SUDDENLY STRANGE BEHAVIOR CERTAINLY DIDN'T HELP.

MARIA, THE BLUE DOG BARKS AT THE KITE.

THEN MY NEIGHBOR TOLD ME THAT DOCTORS AT FEDERALLY-FUNDED CLINICS CAN NOT LEGALLY TALK ABOUT ABORTIONS...

MARIA, THE TESTS ARE POSITIVE. WAIT... I HAVE A BOOKLET.

We are definitely on a downward trend with morals. Where we used to have the Cunninghams, now we have the Bundys. The crew of "90210" has replaced the Brady Bunch, and the sit-coms like “Newhart”, “The Odd Couple”, and “Happy Days” are no longer on. I will readily admit that I did fall victim to this media and television trap, and I simply want to point out that I think I have figured out how the system works. Artists, under the First Amendment, can create anything they want, but that does not mean you have to like their creations or endorse them. Next time you are watching prime time television, ask yourself what you are laughing at, and whether it is really funny.

... SO, INSTEAD, THEY TALK ABOUT “OTHER THINGS”

AND NOW I CAN CONVERSE OPENLY WITH MY DOCTOR.

LET'S SEE... BLUE DOG REFERS TO YOUR DIABETES...

WELL, THE MOON MAY NOT SHINE ON THE PRAIRIE.

BUT WILL THE SPOTTED HORSE SEE THE TREE?

REMEMBER: NEVER use worn!
