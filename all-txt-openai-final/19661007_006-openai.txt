RACISM CAUSES OPPOSITION
Maddox Nomination Upsets Georgia Students

By JOHN WILLIAMS
Staff Writer

“I think I'll move to North Carolina if Lester Maddox is elected governor of Georgia,” commented Julian Prosser, a junior
from Gainesville, Ga. Prosser, extremely opposed to Maddox in next month's Georgia gubernatorial election, recently decided to start a petition
among Davidson Georgians to support Jimmy Carter as a write-in candidate for governor. Carter finished third in the Democratic primary,
trailing Ellis Arnall by 5,000 votes. Prosser, however, has decided not to circulate this petition because Carter might get the
Democratic votes which would be cast otherwise for the Republican candidate, Howard (Bo) Callaway.

A Democrat himself, Prosser is opposed to Maddox because he is “a racist and an extremist who doesn't project an
image of sanity. He would bluff his way through the governorship and make impossible demands on the federal government,” continued
Prosser. According to Prosser, Callaway “takes a middle-of-the-road conservative view, makes a good personal appearance, is a good speaker, but
has no real positive proposals to improve the state of Georgia.”

“It seems a shame,” said Prosser, “to have such poor candidates after Georgia has made so much progress in the
last four years under Gov. Carl Sanders, who has made a name for himself and for the state. He is
a progressive liberal who has made especially great strides in the field of education.” Although Prosser realizes that the Democrats
in high positions will have to support Maddox, he feels that many individual Democrats will vote for Callaway. In fact,
he plans possibly to send a petition signed by Georgia students from Davidson to Callaway endorsing him as “the most
competent candidate.”

Tom Cook, a junior from Perry, Ga., feels that things are in even worse shape than Prosser indicated. “Georgia politics
are in shambles,” said Cook. “Callaway is just a rich man’s son and not really much better than Maddox. He
switched to the Republican party during Goldwater's campaign. His racial beliefs, moreover, are very similar to Maddox's; they have just
not been brought out during his campaign. As congressman from my district, he has had a very poor record.”

As the Macon Telegraph pointed out in its Sept. 30 editorial, this election “pits an avowed conservative against an avowed
conservative. The two-party system was supposed to provide a choice, but it does not do so in this election. The
moderate and liberal voters have been left in the cold.” The tide may be turning in favor of Callaway. On
Monday, Rep. Charles Weltner decided not to run for re-election as congressman because he did not want to have to
support Maddox. And as another Georgia newspaper pointed out, “If there is no Republican party in Georgia, now is the
time to create one.” But apparently no matter what the outcome, according to the consensus of Georgian students here, there
are going to be a lot of dissatisfied people in Georgia for the next four years.

School Lag Blamed On 1-Party System

The one-party system in North Carolina is responsible for this state's low rank in education, claimed John Wilkinson, Republican candidate
for Congress, as he addressed the Davidson Young Republican Club Wednesday night in the College Union. Wilkinson, a lawyer and
former delegate to the Republican National Convention, spoke on the history of the Republican party and causes of Democratic dominance
in North Carolina.

According to him, the term Republican was first associated with the political party founded by Thomas Jefferson in opposition to
the Federalists. This party split into two factions, one led by John Quincy Adams, the other by Andrew Jackson, which
were known as the Democratic-Republicans and the National Republicans. To avoid confusion, the National Republicans changed their name to Whig,
while the other faction dropped the word Republican and became the Democratic party.

Then, he said, in the 1850s, the dispute over the Kansas-Nebraska Act led to the breakup of the Whigs, most
of whom joined the newly-formed Republican party, so-named by Horace Greely, to show belief in the principles of the original
Jeffersonian Republicans. North Carolina at this time had no dominant political party. Even during the Civil War and Reconstruction Era,
there was no balance of power between the two parties. Then, Wilkinson stated, a governor was elected who placed Negroes
in many important state offices. In reaction to this, race became an important factor in the next election. In what
has become known as the “redshirt campaign,” the Democrats swept all state offices, and, according to Wilkinson, began to pass
legislation to insure their position. The “grandfather clause” and an election bill that has only recently been declared unconstitutional, were
two of these pieces of legislation.

As a result, he stated, the Democratic Party became firmly entrenched in the government of North Carolina. Today, even with
a forty percent Republican population, all judges of the N. C. Supreme Court are Democratic, as well as nearly all
members of the various county Boards of Education. Only by ending one-party dominance in this state, Wilkinson concluded, can these
imbalances be corrected. He added that a two-party system is a must if North Carolina hopes to improve its position
in education, standard of living, and power that it wields in the nation.

Foreign Studies Combine

The Foreign Study Program has opened an office in Chambers Building to coordinate the Junior Year Abroad and Richardson Scholar
Programs. The location is Dr. C. J. Pietenpol’s former office on the second floor. Previously separate, these offices have been
combined for convenience and efficiency. Dr. J. O. Embry, Dr. John D. Kelton, and Mrs. Brad Thompson are in charge
of the affairs of the office. Mrs. Thompson has worked before in a similar position with the college and was
retained to help Dr. Embry, the chairman of the foreign study program. The main duties of the office are to
assist in the activities of the Richardson Scholars and to deal with applications for the Junior Year Abroad Program. Mrs.
Thompson urges all students to study to get into the front lines. “I hope that's what you're here for.”

“It takes training, it takes study,” said multi-millionaire college benefactor Charles A. Dana Tuesday. “You're here to use the advantages
that Davidson College offers. Don't learn quickly and forget quickly. You must learn diligently and work diligently through all your
life. Your future will get brighter and better if you do,” he remarked.

Dana said that after that he began a manufacturing firm in New York. He had practically no capital and worked
nights to make the business a success. Once he thought cattle raising in Mexico was the coming thing and spent
a year operating a Mexican ranch. He said that this experience was of value to him.

“We learn from our mistakes, we grow and succeed,” Dana commented. “I decided the best thing I could do with
my remaining years was to help colleges.” In introducing Dana, President D. Grier Martin said that he believes that Dana
has done more for higher education in the South than any other individual. Dana has given over a million dollars
to Davidson, including the Dana Science Laboratories, Cunningham Fine Arts Building, and the Dana Scholarship Fund.

“I hope that you will progress here, aided by the tuition you get here and your own earnestness. Have fun.
Be a lively man. Don't be a bookworm,” Dana emphasized. Dana explained that he spent three years in the New
York legislature, which was difficult because of some inefficient part of the cafeteria staff. Beckham stated that he thought he
had a very competent staff, but because of the desire of some employees to take the weekend off, he sometimes
had to work harder than he would like. Much progress has been made in these areas, he continued. “That’s what
we're all looking for, some little tip or suggestion,” he continued. “I started out as a young kid and a
few of the events in my life have seemed to have helped me, and perhaps you can learn something from
them.”thought that Davidson in New York could have the best food service in the South. “I think that Davidson's food
should be as good as its academic reputation.” Beckham concluded by saying, “Always be looking ahead of yourself to your
own future. If you do, you will succeed,” he said. “I'm trying to emphasize that the individual has great potential
in himself to develop. Travel early, so should students,” Dana observed. Dana is a graduate of Columbia University and is
currently chairman of the board of the Dana Corporation. Accompanying him to Davidson were Walter Mann and Douglas Finley of
New York, board members of the Dana Foundation. “The only thing I can say with greatest emphasis is to give
you boys some encouragement. I wish you all well and hope that you succeed in your endeavors,” he concluded.

HIGHT DISCUSSES GRAD SCHOOLS
‘Go To The Best One You Can’

“Go to the very best school you can get in. Because where you go makes a difference—you better believe that!”
admonished Dr. William B. Hight, director of student counseling, Wednesday night in the College Union, speaking on graduate study at
the first Open End of the year.

Schools judge students: rank in class, grade-point average, courses taken, and standardized tests. “It is important—too important—that you do well
on these national tests,” Hight said. “They will judge you against other students that they have had from Davidson,” he
said. The key question the graduate schools ask is, “Can this boy succeed at this school?” Hight commented that a
few ways for a student to do this is to read the catalogues, find out the number of applicants to
the schools, and ask members of a profession their opinions about schools in their field. “If you are interested in
law,” he suggested, “see a lawyer.”

The best way to gain knowledge of graduate schools, he advised, is through the graduate school catalogues. “Know the individual
requirements of the schools,” Hight emphasized. There are four important criteria on which the graduate schools judge students: rank in
class, grade-point average, courses taken, and standardized tests. “It is important—too important—that you do well on these national tests,” Hight
