**The Davidsonian Sports**

In the 2003-2004 season, a senior-laden lineup defined the women’s basketball team and carried them to a 16-12 record, including
a 13-7 record against Southern Conference competition. This was the best record that women’s basketball has had since the 1998-1999
season. However, last year’s postseason was cut short by a first-round loss to Western Carolina.

Davidson graduated five seniors from last year’s squad, and only one player, 2003-04 SoCon Freshman of the Year Katie Hamilton
’07, returns from last year’s starting lineup. As a result, there are multiple positions up for grabs this season, and
Davidson will see many new players making contributions to the team effort. Fortunately, many returning players are versatile enough to
fill many holes in the lineup. Emily Callahan ’05 says, “Despite the loss of five seniors last year, I think
we’re going to surprise some people. Every individual can fill many roles, which gives our team a lot of depth.”

Coach Annette Watts says, “I would list youth and inexperience as both our weakness and our strength. As a weakness,
it simply takes time and playing experience to feel comfortable and to gain confidence in a much stronger and faster-paced
collegiate game. Youth and inexperience are also strengths of ours in that we just go hard trying to learn faster
and gel with each player combination that goes onto the court.”

**Strengths**

The Wildcats still return several key players from last year’s squad, including Hamilton, Janell Crayton ’06, and Emily Callahan ’05.
Hamilton, while just a freshman last year, led the team in scoring, three-pointers made, and steals. Callahan was named to
the All-Conference team her sophomore year and looks to be a strong, experienced leader for this young (mostly freshman and
sophomore) team. Both Hamilton and Callahan have shown the ability to be consistent scorers on the offensive end and should
ease the load on the rest of the inexperienced lineup as they adjust to featured roles on the hardwood.

The young Wildcat team, however, will be thrown into the fire early and often, as they have a loaded early
season schedule that includes match-ups against national powerhouses such as Duke, Wake Forest, and Virginia Tech before they take on
the normal slate of Southern Conference teams. “Our conference is competitive, but I think we will fare well. We have
some big-time non-conference games which should help to prepare us,” noted Katie Hamilton ’08. While the early season may be
a tough stretch for the team, it will force the team to grow up in a hurry and build its
character before entering conference play.

**Weaknesses**

Eight of the 13 players on this year’s squad are either freshmen or sophomores, and the youth will likely define
the fate of the 2004-05 squad. Coach Watts says of the challenge that youth presents, “The speed at which the
players can gel and mature will be the determining factor of our early success. Use of confidence and solid defense
will create consistency with each passing game.” With so many young players, it will also be interesting to see who
steps out from the crowd and elevates her game. Says Coach Watts, “While we are a very young team we
are not afraid of hard work. This team came into the season in good shape and ready to learn, from
day one they have all been on the same page.”

One of the most significant losses for the Wildcats comes at the point guard position, where the trio of departed
seniors Ashley...Hallsted ’04, Robyn Flewelling ’04, and Lindsay Shade ’04 controlled the Wildcat offense for the past three years. No
point guard currently on the roster registered more than 103 minutes of playing time.

Nov. 12, at Duke
As part of the Preseason WNIT, the Wildcats will take on a Blue Devils squad that was a No. 1
seed in the NCAA tournament last year. Duke finished 30-4 last year, and this year they are ranked sixth in
the USA Today/ESPN/WBCA Division I Top 25 Preseason Coaches Poll and second in the ACC preseason poll.

Nov. 19-20, C & L/Lancer Invitational
Davidson will be playing Farleigh Dickinson, Longwood, and Winthrop over these two days.

Nov. 23, Charlotte
The 49ers made it to the Postseason NIT and should be a good challenge for the Wildcats in the early
season. This cross-town rivalry is also critical for local bragging rights.

Nov. 27, at Georgia Southern
Davidson defeated Georgia Southern twice last year, but the Eagles are ranked ahead of the Wildcats in the SoCon Preseason
Poll. This is the first conference team that the Wildcats play and should provide a great start to conference competition.

Nov. 30, at Wake Forest
The Demon Deacons were only 12-17 on the season last year, but no ACC team can be taken lightly.

Dec. 20, Western Carolina
The Catamounts beat Davidson three times last year, including the first-round conference loss that ended the Wildcats’ season. This could
aptly be described as a grudge match. The Wildcats again play Western Carolina on Jan. 25.

Dec. 29-30, Lady Luck Classic
The Wildcats are slated to play Southern Miss on the 29th and Virginia Tech on the 30th. The Hokies are
ranked fifth in the ACC preseason polls, so they will be quite a formidable opponent.

Jan. 4-Feb. 24
In this two-month span, Davidson will play 16 games against Southern Conference opponents. It will be in this streak of
games that the Southern Conference standings will be decided for the SoCon Tournament. Key games include match-ups against East Tennessee
State, Chattanooga, and Furman.

March 2-5, at Chattanooga, TN, SoCon Tournament
The conference tournament moves to Chattanooga this year from Charleston, and the Wildcats will look to improve upon their quarterfinal
exit in last year’s event. Callahan ’05 will be counted on for leadership as a senior.

Last year for the Wildcats, the position is largely an unknown for the upcoming season. The Wildcats will look for
some combination of Amanda Horne ’06, Jessica Mitchell ’07, and Tia Washington ’07 to step up and provide leadership, ball-handling,
and scoring as the floor general. Davidson struggled with turnovers last year, giving the ball up almost 19 times per
game, so ball security will be essential for whoever mans the point for the Wildcats.

Furthermore, while the strong schedule should help the Wildcats in their search for an identity in the early season, it
could also turn into a weakness if the team does not respond well to some of its stiff early season
challenges. Teams either respond by elevating their game to a new level against great teams or they shut down, creating
a cascade of losses that can ruin a season. Last year’s team responded very well against national competition and carried
that momentum to the games against conference teams. Hopefully, this year’s team will respond in the same manner. Coach Watts
tries to make her athletes treat each game in the same, focused manner, “Our goal is to prepare for each
game the same; one play at a time, one game at a time.”
