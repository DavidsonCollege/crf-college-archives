The sculpture of A. Balasubramaniam is showcased in a new exhibit at the VAC.

**Essay on Bala exhibit ‘bullsart’**

Members of the College community recently received in their mailboxes a small but slick promotional flyer from the Van Every/Smith
Galleries, located in the VAC here at Davidson. It announces a sculpture exhibition, “Unfixed Being: Sculpture by A. Balasubramaniam,” which
is running this fall after an October 13 kickoff with a talk by the artist himself and, of course, a
“wine and hors d’oeuvres reception.”

The flyer includes a few photos of the artist’s work, along with an essay of several hundred words by Sasha
Altaf, an M.A. in art history who specializes in “advanced study in Feminism and Visual Art.” The photos depict the
sort of thing one may have come to expect in such exhibitions. We see, for example, various human limbs protruding
in stark whiteness from an equally white wall, and also some sort of twisted silver branch-like thing. It is the
kind of “sculpture” that one might or might not find stimulating, or sobering, or thought-provoking, or not.

But what’s really provocative here is Altaf’s interpretative essay. Apparently a piece of postmodern art in its own right, it
avoids burdening us with definite significations. Perhaps wittingly (but who knows?), the author leaves readers utterly free to take her
words seriously, or as a radical revelation of absurdity, or a riotous joke, or a tortured scream.

The first paragraph may tempt us to imagine that some sort of meaningful analysis is offered here. In this age
of rapid change, “the emergence of an artist with a unique and constant vision is a refreshing occurrence.” The artist,
“Bala,” “constructs his art through acts of reduction and elimination.” We might well see an act of elimination in such
art, but let’s stay with the essay. “His judicious removal of extraneous elements allows his work to confront the audience
with conviction.” These sculptures are “unfettered by trends and temporality.” Ah, yes; the timeless, the eternal; we begin to smell
the spiritual. And Voila! “There is a rarified spirituality to the work that oscillates between the concrete and the abstract.”
Nice image there: an oscillating, rarified spirituality. The pieces are “a combination of disparate volumes with shadows and negative spaces
that represent his tenacious vision.” Represent? Uh-oh. Well, these various shapes suggest something ... uh ... tenacious.

But we’ve hardly begun. “Over a period of time” (as opposed to a period of space?), Bala’s art has shown
“a gradual disintegration of the image.” The absence of image “has made the essence of the pieces much more explicit.
These works are focused and uncompromising as they demonstrate a lucid intuition enhanced by a refined formalism. Bala moves between
the condition of himself and the condition of the object thereby instilling a sense of ambiguity that precedes a more
intense level of clarity.” Clarity! There’s a virtue. But wait. The artist’s “self-conscious rectitude offers a symbolic instrument for a
stoic acceptance of one’s irrelevance to history, especially in a time when modern life is defined by and lived within
architectural forms. The formal serenity of Bala’s work supports and reflects this stoicism. As a result, a kind of primary
consciousness is reclaimed and filtered through his contemporary interpretation of an elided life. This points not only to historical impotence,
but suggests a condition of self-enlightenment.” It’s a good thing someone feels enlightened here.

The twisted branch thing “alludes to the continuum of life and death, body and spirit, seed and tree, as they
are all seen in a seamless transition.” Of course it does, Ms. Altaf. Other sculptures “impose a viable and memorable
presence and connect the instinctive response to a visceral process. What is rendered visible is something that had once gone
unnoticed in the public domain.” Bala’s works thus “extend the singular experience of space to the community, and significantly, to
the communitarian.” A most singular and significant experience, this, and one that may provoke a further need to eliminate. In
Bala’s work, moreover, “surfaces collide: positive/negative, past/future, presence/absence,public/private, space/solid, temporary/permanent. It is the complexity of this play between opposing forces
that liberates us from passivity and informs us of our condition. Bala’s fixed monuments speak of our being unfixed.” Now
there’s a novel truth: we need fixing. “The shimmering patterns of relations and discourses over time and space determine who
we are. Only by recognizing them and engaging ourselves in their complexity, might we begin to inhabit both our own
place in the world, the spaces and rights of others, and anchor these patterns in reference to the living experience.”
Deep, Ms. Altaf. Very deep. You certainly qualify as a master of postmodern interpretation. You have invented your own genre.
Let’s call it bullsart. Or bull-something.

Kanye West gives ‘full force’ performance
By MIKE WELLMAN
Staff Writer

Kanye West is a man who is all about the show. Having produced quality music for years before jumping in
the spotlight, his entrance into superstardom makes up for his time in the background. Kanye recently presented a flashy show
that soaked up all the limelight and forced the audience to get up and dance, as much for the music
as to be able to see the spectacle on stage. The show was October 15 at the Bi-Lo Center in
Greenville, S.C.

With his new music from Late Registration, Kanye moves from hooks with sped-up samples of recognizable hits to more instrumental
beats. He makes more use of horns and violins which gives his music a more classical feel. Kanye’s themes on
the new album reflect his new success with songs that reflect both the highs of stardom and the lows of
being treated differently. He also stresses the importance of his family with the heartfelt “Roses” and “Hey Mama.”

When Kanye takes the stage, he comes in full force. Before the curtain came up, he pumped up the audience
with an extension of the “Broke Phi Broke” skits that are dotted across his latest album. With violins and horns
behind translucent screens, across which pictures are flashing up according to the song, alongside lights blasting from the center stage,
the venue was exploding with energy. Kanye looked almost small with so much action taking place around him.

The stage changed settings throughout the performance. One scene centered on Kanye’s bedroom, while another depicted his experience working at
the GAP. Another even featured a hospital bed to represent Kanye’s visits to his grandmother. Kanye is a born showman,
and he is something of a perfectionist. During “Roses,” he broke down the entire song and made his crew start
the whole scene over, including a heartfelt speech about his grandmother, all because the wrong lights were put on him
at one point in the song.

Although Kanye may not be the most skilled rapper in the business, his show is as big as he can
make it. He has fun with his shows, putting up critiques of his music in the background of “Bring Me
Down.” Likewise, he does not seem to be bothered by flashing something like “Kanye West’s new album is as big
and ornate as his ego.” In the middle of one song, he came out into the audience. Rather than going
around the outskirts where people were sitting, he waded right into the audience, going between seats and rapping at the
same time. As he was swarmed by audience members, it became apparent to me that the most distinguishing thing about
Kanye West isn’t his witty lyrics, his trademark beats, his connections, or even his style. Kanye West is Kanye West
because he’s willing to do anything to put on a good show, by living and breathing the presentation to please
the crowd. Kanye West is the show.
