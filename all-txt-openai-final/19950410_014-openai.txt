**14 Wins ‘n**

**Baseball takes two from Georgia Southern**

One of Davidson’s best pitchers turned double duty Saturday, but one of the Southern Conference’s best pitchers turned the Wildcats back Sunday. Chris Pollard picked a win in both ends of Davidson’s sweep of a doubleheader Saturday against Georgia Southern, the top team in the conference. But the Eagles’ William Rushing switched the tide Sunday as the Wildcats lost 14-6.

“Certainly, if you can come out of a series against them with a win you feel good,” Davidson coach Dick Cooke said. “They’re a real solid team.”

Picked by many to win the conference, Georgia Southern came into Davidson in first place. Following Davidson’s 3-2 and 5-1 wins Saturday, the Eagles dropped into second place. The Wildcats now stand at 14-19 and 9-9 in the Southern Conference. The weekend series followed a 7-6 loss Tuesday at Georgia Tech for the Wildcats. In that game, the Yellow Jackets squeaked out the win on an eighth-inning single. Davidson had scored five runs in the fourth to get back in the game.

The game continued a string of solid performances by Davidson against Atlantic Coast Conference schools that included a win over Wake Forest.

“We always seem to play well down there (at Georgia Tech),” Cooke said. “This is one of the toughest schedules we’ve played since I’ve been here. I think that if you face some of the ACC arms early in the season, then once you get into conference play, you’ll be better off.”

In the game against Georgia Tech, senior captain Mark Reilly suffered a terrible season-ending injury, dislocating his elbow and thumb. He was coming over from second to cover first on a bunt play and reached out for the throw when the runner smacked into him.

**Rugby team finds tough luck in State Tournament**

The rugby team took the field for the final time this spring on Saturday. Davidson and UNCC co-hosted the North Carolina State Rugby Tournament this weekend and invited six other teams in order to determine the best college rugby team in the state.

The tournament is normally held at Eastern Carolina but due to scheduling conflicts ECU was forced to cancel. But through a joint Davidson and UNCC effort, the tournament was held on both Davidson and UNCC fields. Duke, North Carolina, N.C. State, Appalachian State, ECU, and Western Carolina all made their way to the Piedmont this weekend for the tournament.

Davidson faced Duke in its first game, and it turned out to be a great game. While Davidson dominated the first half, the team couldn’t convert any of the opportunities they created, and at halftime, there was no score. The second half went the same way as Davidson continued to play well. Seniors Jeremy Potter, Tom Shelburne, and Simon Priestley all played great games to lead Davidson, which passed very well all game. Sophomores Chris Smith and Thayer Long led the way on the defensive side, each making several key tackles.With under ten minutes left, the game was still scoreless. Priestly had a chance to put Davidson on top with a field goal opportunity, but the angle was too tough, and the kick barely missed. Minutes later, Duke made a try and then converted the kick to take a 7-0 lead. There wasn’t enough time to mount a comeback, and the game ended with Duke winning 7-0. “The game really could have gone either way. Both teams played tough,” said a bloodied Thayer Long. The team had to look ahead, though, as the next game was under an hour away. This match was against N.C. State and was also very closely contested. Potter and Priestley both had outstanding games, and Sean Callahan and Mike Kessler put on some big hits throughout the game. Potter made a diving try with three minutes remaining in the first half to put Davidson up 5-0. NC State scored and converted midway through the second half to make the score 7-5. But Davidson reclaimed the lead as Priestley made a penalty kick to make the score 8-7 Davidson. However, in the closing minutes, the Wolfpack made a penalty kick to take the lead for good. It was another game that could have gone either way for Davidson. Davidson had nothing to feel badly about as they played very well all day, but luck just wasn’t on their side. N.C. State was very big and had a slight advantage in that respect. However, it was clear to the crowd that Davidson had better skills. “N.C. State looked like they robbed a cattle ranch on the way down here," added a bitter Frank “Falcon Killer” Killian. As tired as all the players were, the day wasn’t over. The team packed up and headed for UNCC to play Western Carolina. Against Western, Davidson put it all together. Priestley scored a try after a penalty in the first half, and Potter scored twice late in the game to break the game open. The final score was 19-10. Another important player in the Western game was Craig Murphy, who did a great job grabbing the ball in the lineup.

The women’s lacrosse team found victory once again Thursday.

WOMEN'S LACROSSE

The Wildcats were triumphant Thursday when they topped Guilford 13-4. The win against Guilford was Davidson’s second win of the season and gives the Wildcats a record of 2-7. The 13 goals scored by Davidson on the road were made by several different people. Some of the contributors to the game included Rebecca MacLean, Megan Snyder, and Hedy Moolenaar. Coach Nancy Billger said she was very pleased with the outcome of the game and that she feels the team is on an “upswing.” The Wildcats also played at Virginia Tech on Sunday. This week, Davidson plays at Randolph-Macon Friday before facing off against Villanova as the squad enters the final stretch of the season. The final week of the season includes a game at American, before the Wildcats return home to face Monmouth. Davidson concludes its season April 26 at home against Virginia Tech on Senior Night.
