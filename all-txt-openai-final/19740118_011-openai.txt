Mike Sorrentino played a great defensive game on Carolina’s ace guard Brian Winters. The Gamecock senior took 17 shots from the field, hit only four, and finished with a dismal nine points.

In the front court, other things were happening, or rather were being made to happen. Larry Horowitz and T. Jay Pecorak played the art of defense to its fullest and held the visitors’ top big man, Alex English, to five of 15 from the floor and 11 points.

Those two defensive efforts keyed the victory. But the efforts did not end here by any means.

Jay Powell played a fantastic game, hitting on five of seven floor attempts and finishing with 13 points. He helped Sorrentino direct the attack on offense. Horowitz got 16 points on six of 13 shots and also grabbed nine big rebounds. The Cats lost the battle on the boards, however, 35-32.

Sorrentino got 14 points on seven of 12 field goals, while Greg Dunn added 13, including five from the free throw stripe. Dunn also had seven rebounds.

Davidson held a 10-point lead at the half, 35-25. The Gamecocks never got momentum and could not stop the fired-up Cat offense. The Cat defense was so sticky that they forced 20 turnovers by the Gamecocks, including some clutch steals and blocked shots in the very late stages of the contest.

Davidson tried to hold the ball in the closing moments of the game and it almost cost them the victory. But Pecorak came from nowhere to block an uncontested lay-up and Sorrentino made a diving steal moments later to sew up the Cat win in their finest hour this season.
