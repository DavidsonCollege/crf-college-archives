In times like these, far-sighted people naturally buy the best. And when it comes to tires, they buy the best tires. That’s why more car owners today are turning to Goodyear tires. That’s why we're having a hard time keeping Goodyear tires in stock — despite the fact that Goodyear makes more tires than any other manufacturer in the world. Even if we are temporarily out of your tire size, it will pay you to place your order now for earliest possible delivery.

Trade new miles for old

90% of tire failures occur during the last 10% of tire life. Why take chances with worn, smooth tires? We'll trade new Goodyear miles for the remaining unsafe mileage in your present tires. Get out of the “danger zone” — go Goodyear. And for safer driving, get LifeGuard Safety Tubes.

Remember, if we don’t have your tire size today, it will pay you to wait for new Goodyears — the best!
