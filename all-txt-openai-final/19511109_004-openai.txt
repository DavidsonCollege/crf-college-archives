_PAGE FOUR_

**Cabbage Planter ... (Continued From Page Two)**

As good as her word, Susan's fairy godmother waved the shimmering wand three times, and the cold gray room on
top of the castle was transformed into a soft blue and crimson ballroom, with murals on the walls, and a
stringed instrument in front of each picture. Susan blinked her eyes and regained her breath, but then remembered that she
was dressed in rags, and was ashamed to be in such a beautiful room looking like Caldwell’s hero with nothing
but a torn, dirty dress to wear. So she asked her fairy godmother for some pretty clothes, like Zola’s heroine
wore when she wore any clothes at all. At once, she found herself in a long blue satin dress, and
gold slippers that shone almost as brightly as her fairy godmother’s magic wand.

Susan was overcome with delight, but being no mean dilettante, she knew that she had two more obligations to fill,
and knew as well that one wish would satisfy them both. For Shaw's sake, she used her final wish. “Please,
Fairy Godmother, may I have three real people to help me enjoy this happiness?” Without a further word, the starry
wand encircled the room three times, and when it had come to rest, there, by the murals, sat three real
people, one with a violin, the second with a clarinet, and the third with a cello. Susan now possessed everything
that she could ever have wanted; she started to thank her fairy godmother, but in a blinding flash of light,
her godmother disappeared as quickly as she had come. The little girl did not know just what to make of
all this, but since she had read all of Lewis's fairy tales, she knew that sooner or later...

...kept in a more or less proper perspective. Our athletic program has been quite properly relegated to a relatively secondary
role in the total life of the college. As a result of this fact, our athletic teams over the past
several years have been consistent losers. Because of our unwillingness or inability to compete with other schools on an equal
footing, we have managed to come off only second best in major intramural competition. But Davidson students and alumni are
just as desirous to win as any other comparable group of Americans and herein lies our danger. If this desire
should become dominant at any foreseeable time in the future, then we can look for a corresponding compromising of our
general academic excellence, with a resulting increased emphasis upon a program of activity which bears a lesser relation to the
ideals and aspirations which Davidson stands for.

To this possibility, two solutions immediately present themselves: either Davidson can give up a sport such as college football entirely,
or, as an alternative and perhaps more satisfying course of action, our sports schedule can be so arranged that we
play teams which are generally our equal in caliber of ability. To implement this second possibility, Davidson could withdraw from
the Southern Conference and enter a league such as the North State Conference, which contains teams with which we could
compete on a more favorable basis. This then is the situation, as I see it. Either Davidson can retain its
high standards of academic attainment and maintain its athletic program in its proper place, or else the school can fall
prey to the same ills which have overtaken...

...1942. He was decorated by King Haakon VII in 1939 as Knight of the Order of St. Olav, first class,
and awarded the St. Olav Medal by the king in 1945. He is the author of the following books and
publications: “With the Crown Prince Couple in America,” “He Who Laughs—Lasts,” “Norway” and “Norway Fights.”

Mr. Olav, who speaks excellent English, has appeared numerous times on the American lecture stage and has had vast experience
as a radio commentator. He is a member of the Executive Board of the Committee for American Students to the
Oslo University summer school. Mr. Olav was also the Norwegian representative in many of the negotiations leading to the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.

**Time Queries: Is Youth Silent Or Does World Fail To Hear Cry**

(Ed. Note—After Time magazine published a survey of the attitudes and condition of American youth today, the Davidsonian considered it
of such importance to merit the summary below.)

Youth today is waiting for fate to show its hand. It waits quietly without the manifestoes and posters of the
Flaming Youth of the 20's. Its chief concern is the “Korean business” and a lot of other business that may
follow. It believes war with Russia is unavoidable, but is taking that fact with a great deal more calm than
it did earlier in the Korean war. Its members admit freely they will avoid the draft as long as possible,
yet active pacifism is not a dominant part of its thinking. A good secure job is about all it really
wants. It plans no world-shaking ventures, but just wants a good job with a big firm and a comfortable suburban
home. “Its fathers did too well. Any momentous tasks it shoves off on the government.”

Youth has accepted life within the well-padded structure of organized society, but lacks a desire to do any of society's
organizing. Modern youth are no longer individuals nor have individual ideas. They are parts of small groups. Alone they become
bored and unhappy.

Almost of itself it has picked up the right ideals from an American tradition older than its parents. Its novelists
with characteristically orthodox liberalism evince the feeling that life is short on reward and long on treachery. Educators complain that
their docile note-taking students have no militant beliefs. They can only be stirred to comment on race relations and world
government, but then with no absorbing concepts. It believes in democracy, but not aloud. It feels the need for a
faith, but isn’t sure where to look for one. God is still a vaguely comforting thought, but has become more
of a factor in their thinking. More go to church, though partly because of increased youth entertainment programs there. Believing
he is serving because of a government miscue, the young soldier wants most of all to come home. He does
not go in for heroics, is short on ideals and self-reliance and is in for personal security at any price.
He lacks flame, but superior fire-power helps him do a creditable job. The best thing to be said is that
American youth has learned it must try to make the best of a hard and difficult situation. It does not
feel cheated or blame anyone as it was blamed for “failure” in World War II. It blames life, but isn't
cynical because it never hoped for much.

Susan had no trouble learning the songs, since there were three hundred different tunes, each one beneath a mural that
showed the country that sang it first. As Susan became less and less self-conscious, she imagined that she was before
an audience, curtsied and smiled, and every once in a while would repeat something as if the brothers Zola had
written it, and imagined how much her imaginary audience might be enjoying her music and her quotations. But it really
didn't matter about the audience, for Susan delighted in singing and playing the tunes so much that sometimes she quite
forgot them. Susan never tired of this game, and the last we heard, is playing it still. And it would
be a shame if she ever were to become tired of the game, for she sang very sweetly, when the
people were quiet, and the stars were out.
