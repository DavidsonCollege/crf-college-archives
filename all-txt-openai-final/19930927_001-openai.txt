Davidson moves up 6 spots in US News’ annual rankings

By Leigh Rawdon

On September 27, American consumers can flip through the pages of U.S. News and World Report and find that Davidson
ranks 12th of American liberal arts colleges in their 1994 report. No other southern college ranks higher. Last year's report
ranked Davidson six positions lower at number 18. U.S. News senior editor Robert Morse, who directs the survey, attributed the
jump to the relativity of other schools' performance. “Everything is relative to what other people do. You can move up
if other schools are falling,” Morse said Friday. The survey director mentioned also the addition of new factors as a
possible contributor for the dramatic change. The magazine now studies graduate satisfaction as an entirely new category and class size
as a variable in faculty resources. Davidson ranked 25th in alumni satisfaction and 30th in faculty resources this year as
opposed to the 51st 1993 ranking. Other variables included in faculty resources are student-faculty ratio, faculty salaries, number of part-time
faculty, and percentage of professors holding the highest degrees. Dean Robert Williams, Vice President of Academic Affairs, speculated Friday that
the higher overall ranking might result from improvement in faculty salaries or the endowment. About the 12th ranking, Williams said,
“It’s a list we’re always delighted to be on.” Though he

Ortmayer recognized with N.C. CASE award

By Jay Jennings

The Council for the Advancement and Support of Education (CASE) announced on Monday, September 20 that Dr. Louis Ortmayer is
the North Carolina Professor of the Year. Ortmayer, a political science professor at Davidson, became the eighth Davidson College professor
to be selected for a CASE award since 1985. No other college or university comes close to Davidson’s record of
eight winners. Ortmayer said that the award is a “great recognition.” He has been flooded with calls over the last
week from colleagues, friends, and former students giving him congratulations. He is especially proud of the award, because it recognizes
his teaching skills, to which he directs most of his energy. Ortmayer’s research in the last couple of years has
centered around his case study teaching method. He uses this method in his American Foreign Policy class. Case method teaching
uses a specific event or policy and then allows the students to use inductive reasoning instead of deductive reasoning. The
students have a formal discussion in class, which is followed by informal discussions out of class. The students discover the
theories for themselves rather than having them taught by the professor. His research on case method teaching allows for connections
with former students. For example, he is working now with a former Davidson College graduate working in Germany on a
case study. Also, he co-wrote two case studies with a student who graduated last year on the effect the embargo
on Haiti had on refugees. The success of his past students in the political science field shows the effectiveness of
Ortmayer’s teaching method.

Women's weekend aims for solidarity

Rusk, Connor, WH work together to maintain 3 strong houses

By Meg Wolff

With the passing of “Women’s Weekend,” a celebration of20 years of women at Davidson and a chance to acquaint freshmen
women with the eating house system, many are wondering about the future of women and of women’s eating houses on
Patterson Court. As Rusk house president Jill Bennett points to the mobility of people between houses and the growing numbers
of previous independents that have recently joined, it appears that the eating house system is flourishing, even growing. But recent
concerns focus on the decreased membership in Warner Hall, leading to speculation about the possibility of Warner having to close
down. Warner Hall president Bailey Foster and other members of the house are not dismayed over Warner's small size, pointing
to increased house unity and enthusiasm which are generating fundraising and social ideas. Foster says, “Warner’s small size has inspired
us to make some organizational changes that have needed to be made for years.” Foster says, “We don’t want to
ever talk about Warner Hall closing.” Foster thinks that “if any one of the houses closes it will be a
real loss to Davidson women, because women here have such limited options anyway, with only three houses.” Bennett concurs by
saying that “more choices are always better - so three eating houses are naturally better than two.” President of both
Patterson Court Council and Connor House, Julie Petty says that the court is focused on “sustaining three strong women’s eating
houses offering different options for women.” Patterson Court Council is focusing this year on presenting the women’s eating houses as
a group, but Petty acknowledges that there are “definitely differences.” She says, “All the houses are appealing. It is up
to the woman to choose which house is best for her.” Bennett sums up by saying, “It has always been
a goal to get as many women involved in Patterson Court as possible, and two eating houses simply couldn’t handle
it all.” Despite problems between the houses in the past, the house presidents are working to promote greater unity on
the court, especially among the women’s houses. Foster thinks the growing unity is a positive thing: “There is no way
we can’t all benefit from unifying and supporting each other.” Foster thinks there is no need for competition between houses:
“That’s why we chose houses over sororities.” However, Foster concedes that

Conference focuses on managed health care
By Katherine Hash

On September 23 and 24 members of the Charlotte area medical community joined concerned professionals, academics, and students for the
Sixth Annual Frederick Womble Speas Memorial Colloquium in Medical Ethics. The 1993 colloquium “Ethical Issues in Managed Care” brought four
distinguished speakers to the Davidson Campus in an effort to provide a historical perspective on and ethical assessment of Clinton’s
proposals for change in the U.S. health care system. The colloquium examined the full consequences of a managed care system
for hospitals, physicians, patients, employers, and the pharmaceutical industry. It also attempted to provide answers to difficult questions like “Can
managed care be both efficient and humane?” and “Will managed care compromise autonomy?”. The colloquium convened Thursday, September 23 at
7 p.m. in Chambers Gallery with a dinner for participants and guests followed by the keynote address at 8:15 p.m.
by Trist Engelhardt, doctor of philosophy and medicine and professor at Baylor College of Medicine. Engelhardt’s address, “Life, Death and
