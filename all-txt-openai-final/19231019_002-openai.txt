THE DAVIDSONIAN, OCTOBER 19, 1923

ATHLETIC NEWS

Yard Lines By W. F. Galloway

Wallop Wake Forest. Wipe that slate at Furman clean. 500 Wildcat boosters will be pulling for you in the Columbia
game. Make Wake Forest number four and Furman number five on the credit side of the ledger. For the first
time since the “one man” was old enough to prognosticate the why’s and wherefore’s of the football season he admits
that Davidson will have a look in on the State championship. Congratulations Bailey, you're waking up. That was a fine
snake dance the Bulldog rooters pulled Saturday. You have to hand it to them, that it had plenty of “pep,”
and maybe plenty of something else. The Trinity menace has faded away, but somebody is likely to get stuck on
the Tarbaby yet. State and Carolina today will show who the Wildcats will fight for the championship. From present prospects
it looks like the University has the best of the bargain.

State has only scored two touchdowns in three games, one on a fumble, the other on an intercepted pass. On
the other hand, the Wolf-pack looks mighty good on the defense. Elon, P. C., V. P. I., and Citadel—and not
a score from scrimmage against the Wildcats yet. Keep that last white line clean, Wildcats. Show Wake Forest and Furman
your claws. There may be plenty of stumps in Wake Forest but Coach Monk’s machine has a special Black, Shepherd,
Hendrix, DeArmond, attachment that, they say, is mighty hard on stumps.

The dope on the Bulldog-Wildcat fracas shows that the Red and Black gained 181 yards, while the Cadets were nosing
out 61. The individual gains for the Wildcats are: Black, 68. Shepherd 55. Baker 38. Covington 13. Hendrix 7.

Football took its toll of deaths last week, when five men died playing the game. One of these deaths was
pretty close to home. Every Davidson man feels with the family and friends of Brown, Bluestocking end who gave all
he had for his team.

Reports from Wake Forest say that the Baptists are going to immerse the Presbyterians. Take your raincoats, gang. Richardson field
has been broken in for service. It’s up to every Wildcat eleven to keep up that old Sprunt field tradition:
Nobody beats the Red and Black in their own back-yard. It was rather funny how well “the funny play” worked
on the Bulldogs Saturday. It didn’t look like the boys from Charleston had ever seen one exactly like it before.

The “mighty Heckman” is gone, but not forgotten. A tie last year, and a loss to Wake Forest the year
before are still on the books to remind us what one man can do. Saturday is the time, and Charlotte
is the place to clear that Baptist account.

The history of the Presbyterian-Baptist scraps show that the Wildcats have won 10, lost 1, and tied 1. However, the
Baptists seem to improve each year and there isn’t much reason to expect a walk-away Saturday on Wearn field.

1908—Davidson 31, Wake Forest 4. 1910—Davidson 32, Wake Forest 0. 1911—Davidson 9, Wake Forest 0. 1912—Davidson 13, Wake Forest 0.
1913—Davidson 6, Wake Forest 0. 1914—Davidson 7, Wake Forest 6. 1915—Davidson 21, Wake Forest 0. 1917—Davidson 72, Wake Forest 0.
1919—Davidson 21, Wake Forest 0. 1920—Davidson 27, Wake Forest 0. 1921—Davidson 7, Wake Forest 10. 1922—Davidson 6, Wake Forest 6.

The only comparative scores on the Baptist work through Elon and Lynchburg: Davidson 19, Elon 0. Elon 3, Lynchburg 0.
Wake Forest 25, Lynchburg 0. Which makes the dope bucket incline a little to the Baptist side of the fence.

With the miracle team of ’25 shattered, there ought to be a close race for the class basketball rag this
Fall. All of which means that both Davidson and Furman will fight to win Saturday, and save all the surplus
for next week.

DOPE BOX REARRANGED

Comparative Scores Indicate Six Hard Games to Finish

With the dust having settled over the gridiron battlegrounds of last week it is possible to draw a few conclusions,
some of them vague, others more definite. When the season first began and after the first reports had come in
over the wires it appeared that there were to be five outstanding contenders for state championship honors. Reviewing the results
of the games played so far this season it appears that this number has dwindled down to three—State, Carolina and
Davidson. With the game today between Carolina and State one of these two will be eliminated. Wake Forest, Trinity, State,
Carolina and Davidson seemed to have strong teams when the season first opened, but reports and facts seem to reverse
this statement as regards some. Wake Forest and Trinity have both suffered defeats at the hands of Carolina, while the
other three have not yet felt the pangs of defeat at the hands of a North Carolina aggregation. Merely because
Davidson appears in the first bracket does not indicate that she is to have an easy time with her future
games. All of the above are yet to be met by the Wildcats, and though Trinity and Wake Forest are
out of the running for championship honors, they or State or Carolina may subtract aNotch from the Wildcats' growing fame.
Uppermost in the minds of the Davidson squad and the student body is the coming game with Wake Forest in
Charlotte Saturday. Minus the services of Heckman and one or two other good players, the Baptists are not making the
strides they did last year, but it has always been a known fact that when the Baptists and Presbyterians lock
horns, luck generally favors the former. Wake Forest overwhelmingly defeated Guilford and came out by a good margin over Lynchburg
College last week, but fell under the onslaught of the Carolina aggregation, 22 to 0. The defeat meted out to
the Baptists by the Carolina eleven was early in the season and it may be that they have added strength
to their squad in the meantime. Davidson defeated Elon, 19-0, who in turn won by the narrow margin of 3
to 0 over Lynchburg, and the latter suffered defeat last week, 25 to 0, at the hands of the Wildcats.

IN SATURDAY’S GAME AFTER MANY DISTURBANCES

Baptists. This would indicate that the Wildcats have a hard game ahead of them with this opponent, but they will
claw and scratch their way through, remembering the disheartening game of last year. Following the Wake Forest contest, the Wildcats
journey to the Sandlapper State, where they will meet Furman at Columbia, Wednesday, October 14. This game, following in four
days after the Baptist-Presbyterian scrap, is going to be hard on the Wildcats. On top of this, Furman has a
strong team, having won two victories and met defeat once. She defeated Virginia, 13 to 10, was beaten by Mercer,
6 to 3, and trampled over P. C. for three touchdowns, the final score being 20 to 0. Davidson was
a winner by three points over P. C., and if comparative scores mean anything, Davidson is going to meet a
formidable opponent at Columbia. Furman nosed out Davidson last year, 13 to 10, and this season finds both teams in
better condition and stronger by far than in 1922.

Comparative scores tell the tale that Davidson and State are evenly matched. Davidson beat P. C. 3 to 0, South
Carolina lost a hard fight to P. C., 7 to 3, and last week State scored a lone touchdown against
South Carolina. The outcome of the State-Carolina fracas today is being watched with considerable interest on the Hill, and when
the fighting Wildcats meet State in Charlotte, Saturday, November 3, they will in all probability have five hundred more Wildcats
pulling for them. Even more formidable than Furman is the Clemson eleven, with which Davidson clashes at Clemson, Saturday, November
10. Even though neither of these games count in the state contest for honors, it would be a great victory
to win out in both. The Clemson Tigers held the strong Auburn team to a 0-0 tie, swamped Newberry 32
to 0, and last week staged a great game against Centre.

IN FAVOR THIS FALL

Short, three-button, half-belted ulsters are to be greatly favored this fall. You’ll see many of them; but none like the
Society Brand Hampton. The difference is in the cut. There’s an air about this overcoat that you will find nowhere
else; it’s smartly cut; every detail—the roll of the lapel, the spacing of the buttons, the placing of the pockets—is
exactly right. We have a wonderful assortment of fabrics for your selection. Heather mixtures, colorful overplaids—whatever you like, we have
it.
