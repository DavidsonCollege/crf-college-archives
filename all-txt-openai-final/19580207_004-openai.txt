Trakas Displays Varied Talents

By GORDON LeGRAND
Davidsonian Feature Writer

As he is a Spanish professor, it is most appropriate and natural that Dr. Pedro N. Trakas’ avocations center around
the dances and music of Mexico and Latin America. Dr. Trakas’ first success as a dancer came when at the
tender age of twelve he won an amateur contest with a performance of the rhumba.

He attributes this victory to the fact that children in competition with adults are generally favored (such modesty). Through high
school and college Dr. Trakas’ interest in Latin American dancing continued. While a student at the University of Mexico, he
learned many of the regional dances of that country—being a regular participator in the fiestas to which American students were
invited.

After assuming his teaching duties at Davidson, Dr. Trakas found some demand for exhibitions of those folk and ballroom dances
that are a novelty to people in this part of the country.

He has directed some of his students in Mexican Folk dances (hat dance, etc.) that have been presented on Spanish
Club programs. Last summer he did the hat dance on a television program featuring various departments of the college. With
his wife as a partner, he has given exhibitions of Latin dancing to several civic organizations.

Closely related to his interest in dancing is Dr. Trakas’ affinity for music. He plays the piano—picking out tunes by
ear; sings in the church choir; and very recently, through a former student, has obtained a guitar (non-R and R
he advises) and equally important, an instruction book. The campus and the surrounding Piedmont may soon be serenaded as the
result of Dr. Trakas’ latest accomplishment.

Professor Trakas is always trying new sports and arts. He has enjoyed tumbling and drama in high school and college,
risking his job at Davidson by acting in a play at Converse College. Now he is planning to take a
stab at golf and also to try his hand (and feet) at flamenco.

He believed the events of the last six months were causing the religious leaders of the nation and the world
to re-think their presentation of the Christian message as one that is unbounded by time and the accomplishments of men.
“In a definitely shrinking world, the Church must make a stronger emphasis upon its missionary enterprise,” he commented. He further
noted that there will likely be an increasing awareness of the presence of those who remain outside the Christian faith.

PRESIDENTIAL COMMITTEE

The former President of Davidson College cited the work of the committee for selecting his successor. He said that he
was particularly impressed by the devotion, wisdom, and care with which this group was pursuing its task. “We should not
be discouraged by the length of time this job is requiring,” he stated in answer to a question regarding the
progress of their endeavor. He gave no indication that he had any definite idea as to the details of the
current efforts of this committee.

In answering the question, “If you had remained at Davidson what would have been your forthcoming projects?", Dr. Cunningham said,
“I would have worked still further to retain and obtain the very best personnel.” He quickly pointed out that he
was casting no dispersions upon the present faculty of which he was very proud, “but this is an area which
an institution of the nature of Davidson must constantly strive to improve.”

NEW RESPONSIBILITY

Dr. Cunningham said that his responsibilities as Director of the Foundation had largely been what he had anticipated, but much
more time demanding than he had thought they would be. He pointed out that his current ministry to the Presbyterian
Church extended from Baltimore, Maryland to El Paso, Texas. This makes it necessary for him to carry a heavy travel
schedule, which will include forthcoming visits to Cleveland and Philadelphia.

Along with all the Presbyterian institutions, Davidson College is eligible for gifts through general bequeathments which the Foundation administers. Dr.
Cunningham pointed out that this was a general eligibility, however, which was entirely separate from the matter when the college
is mentioned specifically in a will. “One of the most enjoyable features of this work is that I call my
own signals,” he

The Davidson YMCA will send delegates to the Southern Area Council of the YMCA.

Students Favor Semester Break

The results of the poll held recently in chapel show that 90 per cent of the Davidson student body that
voted is in favor of a semester break.

As assistant basketball coach, Mr. Wiggins, who is from London, Kentucky, was last year’s basketball co-captain at Wake Forest, where
he took a B.S. in physical education. “Ernie” replaces Pride Ratterree, who left for The Citadel last spring.

Conarroe is a 1956 graduate of Davidson. While here he attained Phi Beta Kappa, President of the Senior Class, and
President of Beta Theta Pi. He now has his M.A. from Cornell University.

RATLIFF (Continued From Page 1)

Dr. Ratliff commented on the type of man he wanted to see become the next President of Davidson College: “I
want an educator, a man who has an understanding of the function of a college.”

Dr. E. F. Patterson, also present at the interview, said that the economics department at Davidson compares favorably “with any
other department I know,” including those at the Universities of Texas, Alabama, Coe College, and Grinnell.

Dr. Ratliff stated that the weakness of the department lay in some of the overcrowded classes, especially in the advanced
courses. Dr. Patterson added that the economics department at Davidson compares favorably with any other department he knows, including those
at the Universities of Texas, Alabama, Coe College, and Grinnell.

Forty per cent of this group favor having Wednesday and Thursday after exams as a holiday. Thirty-eight per cent favor
having the mid-winters dance weekend after exams, with Friday and Saturday as a holiday. The Calendar Committee of the faculty
and student government representatives discussed these two proposals at a recent meeting. Their discussion with regard to the first proposal
included these items: a) moving exams up two days, thus permitting a holiday on Wednesday and Thursday, b) having double
cuts on Friday and Saturday, c) starting the semester two days earlier or taking two days off some regular holiday.
Their discussion with regard to the second proposal included these items: a) not moving exams at all, b) having mid-winters
the weekend after exams are completed, with Friday and Saturday as a holiday, c) extending school one week in June,
d) having three more days off for spring holidays.

Another proposal which the student government hopes to consider includes the following items: a) starting school two days earlier, b)
taking three days off the Christmas holidays, c) moving exams up by one week, d) having a five-day holiday after
exams. The student government is eager to know the feeling of the students on this important matter and will gladly
accept any comments and suggestions.

COMMITTEE (Continued From Page 1)

The matter of casting ballots at the Union rather than at Chapel period was favored by the committee. It recommended
that in the future all elections be voted on there, unless the number of votes fell off drastically. The entire
length of the election period might be shortened several weeks by continued voting in the Union, with five ballots a
week rather than three. Thus, it was held, interest would not decline so drastically, since the elections would not be
so drawn out.stated. "Previously I felt that I had to handle—and indeed I wanted to handle—all the specific responsibilities of
a college president. Now, however, I find more time to relax with my family and friends. This is a wonderful
new experience for me," laughed Dr. Cunningham.
