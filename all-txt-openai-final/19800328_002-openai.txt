**Candidate Green calling for larger aid**

By MARVIN OVERBY

North Carolina residents may have to pay less to attend Davidson College if Lieutenant Governor Jimmy Green has his way.
Green’s re-election campaign is finally getting off the ground, calling for an increase in the state’s annual aid to North
Carolina students attending private colleges from 15.5 million to 68.8 million dollars. This would allow each student to receive $1500,
an increase of $825 over the present average state subsidy of $675.

Green's proposal would fix state aid to students in private colleges at one-half of that which University of North Carolina
schools receive. Carl Stewart, Green’s opponent in the May 6 primary, opposes the increase because it would limit the authority
of the state legislature in budget-making decisions. Stewart also suggests that such an increase in state aid could conceivably result
in a loss of some of the independence private schools enjoy.

Both Democratic candidates for Governor, Bob Scott and incumbent Jim Hunt, said the proposal deserves careful consideration. Neither candidate would
commit himself on the issue. Green believes his proposal will better ensure the future of North Carolina’s private colleges, mitigate
the competition between state and private schools for state tax money, and eventually cost the North Carolina taxpayer less.

Davidson will definitely have a new student-run pop radio station this term, according to Janet Coleman, who with David Sappenfield,
is spearheading the project. Students will be able to hear broadcasts by plugging their radios into wall sockets connected to
the station, according to Sappenfield. Broadcasting will begin as soon as the ROTC Department clears a storeroom in the basement
of Belk. The station will broadcast a mixture of rock, jazz, and folk from 10 a.m. to midnight 6 days
a week and 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. on Saturdays.

However, this depends on the station’s operating budget which the Activities Tax Council will allocate when it meets next month.

**Clarifications**

**Evaluation**

All students will not be required to sign sheets identifying their faculty evaluation forms, as stated in The Davidsonian last
week. Individual professors may require their students to sign the sheets, but students will then have the right to refuse
to fill out an evaluation form.

**Budget cut**

The $85,000 cut in the athletic budget will not be primarily in minor sports, as previously reported. The cuts will
occur in areas of general expenses. For details, see the story on minor sports, page 1.

Jackson saw the 234 unclaimed ballots as purely a result of students not crossing out their names or initialing the
directories. “We haven’t used the directories in an election in over a year...I’m not surprised that everyone didn’t sign the
books,” Jackson said. Another possible reason for the discrepancy was one of the days that could probably account for 80
or 90 ballots. Austin and Lloyd apparently acted without Bowie’s knowledge. “We just wanted to see if the count was
accurate,” Lloyd said. Asked about any suspicions of ballot stuffing, Lloyd said, “we don’t want to draw any conclusions.”

In a meeting with candidates Robert Bowie, Richard Terry, and David Waddill last week, Jackson and soccer player Mark Elmore
reported that Miller approached the players and said, “What the f--- are you doing?”

Waddill said he heard many ideas while campaigning and will follow up on as many as possible. “I hope that
the ideas continue to flow.” Waddill invited all interested students to attend the open SGA meetings on Tuesdays at 9:00
p.m. and to look into posts available on the Advisory Councils which will be open after elections.night, Jackson said that
all agreed there had been no “evidence for ballot fraud for any of the candidates.” “I can’t believe anyone would
suspect that,” Jackson said. In the meeting with the candidates, all felt the results were fine and saw no reason
for another election, although Austin and Lloyd did, Jackson said. Jackson thought perhaps the “system should be looked at,” and
he plans to suggest some type of investigation to President-elect Dave Waddill. The final vote rested at 482 ballots credited
to Waddill, 270 to Terry, and 227 to Bowie.

“complete children,” Elmore said. However, Silveira said, “Some of us lost our tempers—for sure.” Miller said he was upset that
the soccer players were practicing on a wet field—“which tends to wear out the field in a hurry... We gotta
have a place to practice if we're going to be successful.” “We’re authorized to have Spring football practice, and that’s
one of our fields,” Miller added.

When asked if the soccer team’s having permission from Sterling Martin to use the field made a difference, Miller said,
“He's in charge.” However, Farrell pointed out that...
