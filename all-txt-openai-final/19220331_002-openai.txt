Among these, we find “The Man in Gray,” by Thomas Dixon, a novel of the South and of Robert E. Lee; “The Empty Sack,” by Basil King, a dramatic story of love and business; “The Wasted Generation,” by Owen Johnson; and “If Winter Comes,” by A. S. M.

PLANS FOR WAKE FOREST DEBATE NEARLY COMPLETE
The preparations for the Davidson-Wake Forest debate are nearing completion. The debate is to be held on April 7 at eight p.m., in the auditorium of Queens College, in Charlotte. The Davidson team, composed of Edgar Houghton and J. C. Bailey, with Arnett Gamble as alternate and manager, is to be opposed by L. E. Anderson and A. L. Goodrich, with W. Bryan Booe as alternate and manager. The judges are to be chosen from a list of men proposed by Davidson and approved by Wake Forest. The managers have already secured three judges and two others will be settled upon in the near future. Dr. W. H. Frazer, president of Queens, has been secured to preside. Queens girls have consented to be the marshals of the occasion. The subject for debate is one of vital interest to the United States at the present time: Resolved, That the Federal Government should own and operate the coal mines of the United States, constitutionality waived.

PHI SOCIETY STAGES MOCK COLORED JUNIOR SPEAKING
The Phi Society on last Thursday evening had a most unusual and interesting program. The program was full of “pep” and life from start to finish. Every minute was full of new thrills and outbursts of applause were frequent. The special program of the evening was “Junior Speaking of Biddle University.” Biddle University, wanting to have Junior speaking this year on the “Hill,” made application for the use of the society hall for this elaborate occasion. The question was put before the society for action and after many speeches pro and con, it was decided to turn over the hall to the speakers.

Doctor Biddle (Archie Freeman) officiated. He thanked the members for the kindness that had been shown them. He expressed his sincere good pleasure in having his students address such an intelligent audience. After a few other preliminary remarks of gratitude, Doctor Biddle introduced the first speaker of the evening, Josiah Enoch Jeremiah (H. K. Russell). The subject of Jeremiah was “Evolution.” He went way back before Darwin in his hypotheses and theories. He proved without a doubt that “man did spring from the monkey.” The second speaker of the evening was Rufus Blackman (W. P. Brown). His speech was a little out of the ordinary, even rivaling Shakespeare in literary attainments. Jeremiah Isaac Knight (J. I. Knight) was the third speaker of the evening. Knight was a very appropriate name, because no night was ever darker than this speaker. “Woman and the Great Unknown” was his subject. She was analyzed from A to Z in his speech. The primary point he attempted to make was—get a woman and stick to her through thick and thin.

Joseph Benjamin Abraham (A. V. Gibson) was the last speaker of the evening. “The Stage Shall Be Reformed” was his subject. There were two points in Abraham’s speech that were of special interest: (1) The necessity of square dealing with the farmer; (2) Square dealing with labor in the labor question today. Thus ended Junior Speaking of Biddle University, which was a great success in every way.

EUMENEANS DEBATE SUBJECT RATIFYING NEW AMENDMENTS
The subject for debate was, Resolved, That ratification of amendments to the United States Constitution should be put to a direct popular vote of the people, a two-thirds majority being necessary to adopt an amendment. The gentlemen upholding the affirmative were: Mooney, H. O. Moss, and H. M. Morris. The negative was supported by P. M. Patterson, Robins, and Luckie. All of the gentlemen showed good preparation. H. M. Morris, who volunteered to speak on the negative in place of an absent member, was declared by the critic to be the best speaker of the evening, despite the fact that he had no previous preparation. The house voted in favor of the negative on the merits of the question. The judges by a two to one vote also decided that the negative had presented the best argument.

Following the debate came two excellent orations, by T. H. Patterson and W. T. Elliott. Patterson spoke on his experiences at the Volunteer Conference recently held in Greensboro. He clearly outlined the many advantages to be obtained from such a conference and concluded his oration by urging everyone to attend at least one conference of this nature during his college course. Elliott, speaking on “Ideals,” traced these from their very beginning to the present day. He handled his subject in a masterful way, showing good preparation. The program was brought to a close after Purdy, Moffatt, and Freeland had all given excellent declamations.

PANDEINICS HEAR PLAN FOR IMPROVING HONOR SYSTEM
The most striking item on the Pandeinic program of March 23 was an oration by T. M. Lowry. His subject was “Our Campus.” Taking this term in its broader sense, he spoke of the defects and strong points of the honor system as it now exists. He drew from this his main point that only such things as lying, cheating, and stealing, things that have to do with honor, should be included under the honor system; and other things, such as hazing and playing of musical instruments, should be placed under separate rules of conduct. This, he said, would make the system much easier and more practicable.

The query for debate was, Resolved, That ratification of amendments to the Federal Constitution should be made only by a two-thirds vote of the people. The affirmative was upheld by G. E. Weeks and C. F. Wildman, and the negative by G. B. Roberts and J. R. Maxwell. Current events were presented by E. H. Mauze, touches of humor being brought in to make them more enjoyable. The regular critic being absent, D. R. LaFar was appointed and performed his duties as though long accustomed to the job.

METROPHILIANS HEAR TALKS ON THE ORIGIN OF HUMANS
The regular standard program was carried out in full at the last meeting of the Metropolitan Society. A debate on the subject, Resolved, That in the future, amendments to the National Constitution should be made by a two-thirds vote of the people, was the first in order. The affirmative was defended by M. C. Dew, A. M. Hurd, and G. Randolph Uzzell. Those arguing that this power should be left in the hands of Congress were: Burdette Wolfe, J. D. Brown, and J. L. Parks.

An extemporaneous debate on the old and much-debated Darwinian theory came next. Fred Smith took the stand that this theory was entirely wrong, while P. C. Henderson tried to prove that our forefathers were wont to swing from trees by their lower queues and to throw coconuts at the passersby. T. A. Lacy delivered a splendid oration. The attendance was almost one hundred percent and this meeting was only a link in a long chain of fine ones held by this lively society.

LOCAL FRATERNITIES ADD ATTRACTIVENESS TO HALLS
Additional improvements have been made on the fraternity halls of Davidson. Several weeks ago, the Kappa Alpha and the Pi Kappa Alpha completed various internal improvements for Junior Speaking. Then the members of Kappa Sigma, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and Bachelors’ continued the good work on their halls. The floors in each hall were scraped, sandpapered, and varnished in preparation for the celebrations and festivities of Junior Speaking. After much labor, the appearance of all the halls has been very much improved.

JUNIORS STAGE GREATEST SPEAKING OCCASION YET
(Continued from page 1) that has been held for some time. Its”Success was proved by the large number who made the rounds of the halls. It provided a change from the regular reception in the gymnasium and seemed to be thoroughly enjoyed by all. This was one of the most enjoyable events of Junior Speaking, and it is hoped that it will be incorporated as a regular part of the celebrations.

Saturday Morning Speeches.

Saturday morning the first eight of the Junior orators made their speeches in Shearer Hall. The speeches showed careful preparation and the deliverance of the orators was unusually good. F. C. Thames, who spoke on “Arkansas,” pointed out the fact that most people have a misconception of Arkansas and think it backward and undeveloped. He told of its fit climate for different crops, of its natural resources, and then told of the prosperity of the people as a whole.

R. U. Woods, the subject of whose speech was, “Even This Shall Pass Away,” traced the rise and fall of several nations of ancient greatness and brought out in a clear, forceful manner that the security of nations lies in national character and ideals.

R. F. Davidson, who spoke on “Safeguarding our Security,” told of the increase of crime and clearly showed the need for preventive rather than punitive action. He also outlined a plan which would far surpass the present system of dealing with criminals.

Z. A. Morris spoke on “The New Love” between the nations and told of the benefits that accompany it.

J. D. Bernhardt spoke on “Davidson’s Annus Mirabilis.” He told of the trials Davidson has passed through and said it was only necessary to stick by the guns and Davidson’s “Annus Mirabilis” would soon come.

M. P. Calhoun, in a speech entitled, “The Value of Obstacles,” showed clearly that obstacles are helps, and except for them there would be no real work. He pictured the lives of several great men and the obstacles they overcame.

D. H. Ogden, who spoke on, “The Great Fellowship,” showed the dependence of world peace on the fellowship of Great Britain and the United States. He traced the growth of the friendship between these two great powers and pointed out friendly deeds done by each to the other.

J. A. Grey, in “To the God of Greed,” showed the danger of blindly going after wealth and sacrificing everything else to this end. He also told of wealth in its relation to health and character.

Saturday Evening Speeches.

The second of the Junior oratorical exercises was held Saturday night in Shearer Hall. The event was well attended and the audience had the privilege of hearing eight carefully prepared and excellently delivered orations. The exercise was opened by prayer by Rev. R. C. Clontz, of Cornelius, after (Continued on page 5)

Second Oak Ridge Game.

Hard and timely hitting by the Wildcats coupled with seven errors by Oak Ridge decided the second contest with that Prep school nine in favor of Davidson, 12-4. This was the first victory of the season and it split the series with the Oak Ridgers, each team taking one game. Potts, a Davidson boy, hurled the sphere for Oak Ridge, and except for a pair of bad innings, got by in great style. Davidson pumped out five hits and a sacrifice fly in the fourth and at the end of that stanza had four counters chalked up to their credit. Again in the eighth inning, when his support blew up, the old Red and Black Machine pushed six tallies by the fourth base on four hits and four errors.

Sorrells pitched a great game for Davidson, allowing six hits and keeping them well scattered. Coach Hengeveld made several shifts in the lineup and the new combination seemed to work together like a well-oiled machine. McLeod punched out a couple of pretty hits and also crossed the plate twice. Erwin, M., got two double sack drives and played a good game at second. Crawford added to the grand total of hits, each lashing out three apiece. Freeman, McMillan, and Pritchett followed closely with a brace of clouts apiece. Both of Captain Freeman’s hits took him around to the hot corner. Every regular Red and Black player got at least one hit.

The Wildcat nine fielded superbly, cutting off many runs by the accuracy and cleanness with which they snatched up the sphere. McPherson, a freshman, pitched his first game for Davidson and showed promise of becoming one of the premier box artists of the Carolinas. Although hit hard at times, he kept the hits well scattered and aided by his teammates in the field his first game goes on the credit side of his record.

Erskine Game.

The Wildcats collected 17 bingles, including two doubles and four triples, off of the redoubtable “Lefty” Beard, Erskine’s pitching ace. These hits produced 11 runs, giving the game to Davidson by a four-run margin. The willow invasion of the Wildcats started in the first inning and continued throughout the contest. Crawford and M. Erwin were the chief contributors connected with three for base hits.
