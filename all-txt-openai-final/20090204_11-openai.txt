The Davidson men’s tennis team lost to No. 69 Radford University 6-1 this Sunday at Davidson’s Knoblock Tennis Center. The Wildcats lost all three doubles matches and five straight singles matches falling to 1-3 on the year. Radford’s Sayer, Salec, Benhammou, and Ogrizek swept the No. 1, 2, 3, and 5 singles to extinguish the Wildcats' hopes for victory.

Calum Gee ’12 continued playing stellar tennis, picking up the lone Wildcat victory with a 6-4, 4-6, (10-5) victory over Stefan Bojic at No. 4 singles. Gee played a tiebreaker to decide the third set since Radford had already captured the overall victory.

“They were a very tough team. They had some international players that we couldn’t quite handle,” captain Scott Myer ’09 said.

Myers lost his No. 1 doubles match 8-3, playing with Calum Gee ’12. Myers forced the second set to a tiebreaker in his No. 3 singles match. He, however, stormed back from a one set down 4-0 deficit in the tiebreaker to tie it 4-4, but ended up losing to Mehdi Benhammou 6-1, 7-6 (7-5).

The men’s tennis team will travel to take on No. 52 South Carolina in their next match on Feb. 7. The Gamecocks are the second straight nationally ranked opponent for the Wildcats.
