DAVIDSON LOSES TO WEAVER COLLEGE

On Thursday afternoon Davidson met defeat at the hands of the fast team from Weaver College by a score of 8-5. The Red and Black scored first in the opening inning on an infield hit and a double. Another run was added in the fourth and sixth, and two more in the ninth, when a rally was started. It was short-lived, however, and the lead made by the visitors in the sixth could not be overcome. The visitors scored all of their eight runs in the sixth, when three hits and a bunch of errors sent the locals up in the air for a time. With the exception of this inning, the game was close and well-fought. For the visitors, Anderson, the twirler, was easily the star, holding the locals safe at all stages. For Davidson, Christenbury was the star both in batting and fielding. The tabulated score given below tells the story:

CAROLINA WINS GAME

The game with North Carolina on the Hill on Tuesday resulted in a 7 to 3 victory for the visitors. Carolina started out strong by scoring two runs in the first inning, with base on balls, one hit, and a wild throw by Black. Davidson came back in the third, scoring one run, when Brown hit safe, second baseman Patterson threw wild, and Christenbury sacrificed to center. Carolina annexed three more in the fourth on an error by Somerville, safe hits by Lewis, Shields, and Honig. Davidson scored next in the fifth. Walker hit safe over third, Brown hit safe to the same territory, Black sacrificed both men up; Austin, batting for Ansley, sacrificed to right, Walker scoring. Again in the sixth, Carolina scored two by an error by Somerville, a wild throw by Black, and Patterson’s double to left. Lawson was substituted for Groome in the seventh, and by his pitching, which was remarkable in view of the fact that he pitched only the day before in the game with Wofford, held the visitors for the remainder of the game. The features of the game were the playing of the entire Carolina team and the batting of Brown throughout the entire game, and Austin’s triple for the home team. Box score:

DAVIDSON IS VICTORIOUS (Continued from page 1)

patriotic Americans to receive these immigrants. The debaters were then given five minutes each for rejoinders, the order being reversed so that Clemson led off and Davidson closed. The rebuttals were full of fire and spirit. The Clemson debaters, however, showed themselves unable to meet the strongest arguments of the affirmative, while Alexander and Rowan had little difficulty in finding flaws in the contentions of the negative. The decisions of the judges were then handed to Dr. Johnson in sealed envelopes, while the audience awaited anxiously to hear the result, which was four to one in favor of Davidson.

The crowning event of a victorious day was the informal reception given by the Winthrop girls in the halls of the main building immediately after the debate. The three literary societies, Winthrop, Wade, and Curry, united their efforts to give the visitors a cordial welcome, and truly a more cordial welcome could not have been given. The girls were out in full force, and they were most charming hostesses indeed. Assisting them in entertaining were the faculty and marshals in their regalia of garnet, purple, and gold, the colors of the three societies. When the good-night gong sounded the hour of departure it was with real regret that the Davidson men forced themselves to leave, and they are eagerly awaiting an opportunity to again pay a visit to Rock Hill and Winthrop. The entire Davidson student body wishes to tender their sincere thanks to the girls of Winthrop for an enjoyable day and a delightful reception, and to Dr. Johnson for his interest and splendid cooperation, especially in the staging of the debate and also in the other events of Davidson Day at Rock Hill.
