Bo Roddey suffered another defeat in this match at the hands of Kovaleski and Atwater of W. & M.; 6-1,
6-4.

The Philanthropic and Eumanean literary societies met in Eu Hall for their annual speaking contest Friday evening, April 29. The
Eumaneans, with Dr. Richards presiding, acted as hosts to the Philanthropic members. Prof. T. Y. Miller and Prof. Clune were
the faculty judges.

At 8:45 p.m., Joseph S. Hutchinson, director of the Mint Museum of Art in Charlotte, lectured on Louis Orr, which
included one of his etchings. Eumanean Hall was presented to the college by Mr. Thomas F. Stanley of Rye, N.
Y., a Davidson alumnus.

This lecture was followed by a student recital in Chambers Auditorium at 4:30. Featured soloists were Bill Richard and Buford
Stonestreet.

The softball game was the height of the intense rivalry between the two societies. As usual, this race provided many
exciting moments. The Philanthropic team again failed to click and lost to the Eumaneans. The final score was 6-2.

The morning chapel program was conducted by the music department which presented a preview of the Little Symphony's program to
be presented that night. Prof. Pfohl explained and illustrated the basic structure of a symphony to the students in order
that they might better appreciate the evening's performance.

The festival appeared on the agenda. The Cats play Carolina on May 11, and to the interest of our readers,
the Davidson team will be playing against U. of Maryland, Haverford, George Washington U., and the Country Club of Va.,
before returning home for their last scheduled match of the season, which is UNC there on May 11.

Whit Cobb, playing No. 4, defeated Valentine of Va., 6-4, 10-8, and Henry Neisler won over Rixey, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3.
These were the only two matches Davidson won against Va. Ted Keesler lost to Wyche by scores of 6-1, 6-2.
Williams lost to Horsley, 12-10, 6-4. The Bo Roddey-Whit Cobb combination lost to W. & M.'s ace, Fred Kavaleski, who
ranks high up in the national intercollegiate singles ratings. He defeated Bo, 6-2, 6-4. Losses were suffered by Keesler, Neisler,
and Williams in the singles.

The lone victor from the teaching staff in the badminton matches was Louis Orr, who defeated Art Lindsay, 2-1.

Davidson Open on SundaysHere is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

There was a concert presented by O. C. Stonestreet, Mer. and faculty members were invited. The Little Symphony Orchestra, which
is composed of musicians from Davidson College, was over in time for the Male Chorus Concert at 8:30. A hilarious
program conducted by M. C. “Mouse” Morgan was highly entertaining for the audience. Starting out with jokes of the usual
kind, “Mouse” was well received by the audience. Randy Ensign “sang” his own version of “Time on My Hands.” The
exhibit is a display of both student and faculty talent.

Professor James C. Pfohl conducted, and Mr. Thomas Hebbard, professor of music at Queens College, was concertmaster. Soloists for the
evening were well received by the audience. The photographic and art exhibits in the lobby of Chambers Building were also
well attended.
