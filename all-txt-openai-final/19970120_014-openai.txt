14 MONDAY, JANUARY 20, 1997 DAVIDSONIAN

Bruiser plays dumb

Amherst, Mass. - These are not the most joyous of days at UMass. Not only are the Minutemen floundering a
year after going 35-2 and securing a Final Four berth, but an NCAA investigation looms and probation is a possibility.
Former UMass center Marcus Camby, last year’s national player of the year and currently a rookie with the Toronto Raptors,
reportedly accepted gifts of money, jewelry, and prostitutes from wooing agent Wesley Spears during last year’s memorable campaign. Depending on
what the NCAA determines, UMass could have to forfeit all 35 of its 1995-96 wins and its Final Four status.

When asked about the controversy, Minuteman coach Bruiser Flint responded, somewhat jokingly, “What controversy?” When reminded of the Camby fiasco
(as if he needed to be), the rookie helmsman said, “Half of these guys weren’t even here during that period.
They don’t know what’s going on with the Camby situation. As long as we’re not on probation, that’s all they
care about.”

Marshall returns
After a debilitating bout with Hepatitis A during the preseason and a lengthy recuperation period, rookie Stephen Marshall made his
college debut in the 75-57 win at New Hampshire on Dec. 21. Marshall, a 6-8 forward from Midlothian, Va., known
for his vicious rebounding, scored four points on four nothing-but-net free throws in 7 minutes. “It felt great,” said Marshall.
“My endurance still isn’t there like it was and I’m not as strong as I was. And I’m not confident
with all the plays yet, so there’s still a lot of improvement to be done.”

“It’s great to have him on board,” added coach McKillop. “He’s a presence to allow Landry and Chadd to get
some rest. That (Kosmalski-Holmes-Marshall) is a pretty good frontcourt rotation right there.” Marshall added another four vs. UMass and eight
against Georgia Southern Jan. 11. An 11-point, 6-rebound performance in the win over Western Carolina a week ago was his
best to date.

Halbauer coming into his own
Coming to a new country and adapting to a different culture is difficult. Doing all of that and adjusting to
the American style of basketball is that much more challenging. But that’s exactly what Davor Halbauer has done and is
doing. And quite well at that. A 6-3 guard from Zagreb, Croatia, Halbauer has become a key reserve in coach
McKillop’s rotation, averaging 15.9 minutes and 4.5 points a game. He buried a key three-pointer late in the second half
vs. UNC Charlotte and notched nine points in 22 minutes against UMass. Despite being upended in the paint and taking
a nasty spill on his head against the Minutemen, the gutsy Halbauer returned less than three minutes later to post
a flawless shooting night. He was 3-for-3 from the field, including 2-of-2 from three-point land, and 1-for-1 at the line.

“He has a history of concussions, so we watch it very closely when he gets hit in the head,” commented
McKillop. “He had a wonderful game for us and really competed very hard.” Halbauer also had a career-high 10 points
against Marshall Jan. 8.

Southern Conference has nowhere to go but North
So far the only two Southern Conference squads that have fared even reasonably well against some of the nation’s stiffest
competition have been Davidson and Marshall. The Thundering Herd, picked tops in the Northern Division in the preseason by the
coaches and media, tested then fifth-ranked (now No. 3) Clemson over the break before finally bowing out, 73-57. Some other
scores of note from over the Holidays: Duke 104, Western 54; South Carolina 100, Furman 62; Tennessee 54, East Tenn.
St. 40; Coastal Carolina 61, Georgia Southern 21. Even UT-Chattanooga, the odds-on favorite to represent the conference in the NCAAs,
has not lived up completely to its advanced billing up to this point, struggling in December. The Mocs, led by
standout and NBA lottery prospect Johnny Taylor, barely made it to the championship game of their own tournament. There, they
lost to Canisius, 63-49.

The Ole Miss Rebels, whom the Wildcats beat Dec. 2, 59-56, ascended to No. 20 in the AP poll last
week before losing to state rival Miss. St. and Vanderbilt. In its SEC opener, Ole Miss upset then 22nd-ranked Arkansas
in Fayetteville and shocked then No. 3 Kentucky Jan. 11. UNCC has also been hot since edging the Wildcats, posting
convincing victories over Tennessee and George Washington in the past few weeks. They are currently 11-4, 3-1 C-USA.

Ali floats like a butterfly, stings like a bee
As of games through Jan. 13, Ali Ton stood 22nd in the nation and 2nd in the league in assists,
averaging 6.2 per game. With his 10-assist performance on Saturday vs. UTC, Ton will likely move up a few slots.
Ton also added six points and nine rebounds against UTC, leaving him just two buckets and a single rebound away
from a triple-double. The ten assists marked the second time this season the 6-0 sophomore court general notched double figures
in assists.Ton’s predecessor at point guard had one such game over the last two years of his illustrious career. Sagarin
speaks Davidson’s non-conference schedule, including such powers as Wake Forest, Duke, UMass, Ole Miss, and UNCC, was rated the 23rd-toughest
in the country by USA Today sports-computer-ranking guru Jeff Sagarin.

**Injury update:** Halbauer, who sat out Saturday’s contest with a bruised knee suffered last week in practice, will likely return
to action tonight vs. App. St. Marshall, who turned his ankle in the first half on Saturday after playing just
six minutes, is doubtful for tonight, but hopeful for Wednesday’s trip to East Tenn. St.

**Women from page 1:** Her two baskets in the final four ticks provided an exclamation point to what may one
day be looked back on as a definitive over-the-hump week for Davidson women’s basketball. “I don’t know if I’ve ever
seen a more dramatic four seconds. These are the type of games that make for hopefully a great season,” said
coach John Filar. “Jamie wants the ball in those final seconds and she drained those shots.”

Despite being outplayed for most of the first half, Davidson slowly cut into an eight-point deficit and trailed by only
a point at halftime. After the two teams traded scoring runs at the beginning of the second frame, the game
was tight throughout the last eight minutes with neither team gaining more than a four-point advantage. The Mocs went ahead
by two on a putback, setting the stage for the fantastic finish.

“We’ve been doing a lot of the big things well,” added Filar. “This team has a lot of confidence in
themselves.” Much of that confidence stemmed from a 60-58 victory Monday over App. St., the defending league champion. The win
was the program’s first ever over the perennial power Mountaineers. Senior forward Carolyn Kirsch continued her spectacular play of late,
going for 19 points and 9 rebounds. Her jumper early in the second half gave the Wildcats their first lead
of the game, 38-37. Davidson did not lead again until the 2:34 mark, when Jennie Vanlerberghe found Kirsch under the
basket for a layup. O’Brien hit a clutch free throw with 14 seconds remaining to push the lead to two.
But with less than a second remaining, Jamie Brown fouled Merideth Thompson. After missing the first free throw, Thompson intentionally
missed the second and O’Brien grabbed the rebound, sealing the breakthrough win.

The last piece of the puzzle was an 81-58 non-conference win over Maryland Baltimore-County Thursday night. Davidson, riding high from
its emotional win over Appalachian, came out of the gate sluggish, but was able to pull away late in the
game. “A letdown was a concern with Appalachian being by far the biggest win since I’ve been here, but we
pushed it up a level in the second half,” said Filar. “There’s not one soul out there who played unselfish
ball.”

Davidson won two of three other games played during winter break. They shot 51% from the floor en route to
a 100-79 thumping of Manhattan on Dec. 19. The winning streak continued with a 93-79 defeat on Dec. 30 at
Winthrop. The Wildcats received solid performances from Kirsch and Brown who tallied 21 and 19 points, respectively. Katy Kamp, filling
in for an injured Vanlerberghe, notched 11 points and six boards in her first career start. The only loss of
the stretch came in a 72-60 defeat at the College of Charleston on Jan. 6 in a non-league game.

The squad has now won nine of its last ten and has an impressive 11-3 record and is the only
remaining unbeaten in the Southern Conference. The 11 wins leave the Wildcats just three shy of last season’s program-best total
of 14. There have been several keys to the team’s stellar performance during the first half of the season. First,
Kirsch is having a banner season. After scoring a career-high 26 points in an 84-65 win over Western Carolina in
the league opener on Jan. 11 and 19 against App. St., she was named conference player of the week.

Bench play has been another contributing factor to the recent success. Despite having Jessica Montrella and Kerry Brown on the
bench due to illness, the Wildcats have not missed a step. O’Brien scored a career-high 13 in her first career
start against Western. Three players (Danielle Mall, Amy Scalcucci, and Meagan Gleason) drained three-pointers in the decisive run against UMBC.
As Kirsch remarked, “We can put any five players out there and win a game.”

Finally, the team has played tenacious defense during this stretch. The Wildcats held preseason conference player of the year Andreia
Hinton of App. St. to just five points and lead the league in field goal percentage defense (38.2%). With a
pair of two-point wins in the last week, this season is slowly but surely growing into what could become a
dream year for the women’s basketball team. And if it ends up taking the Wildcats where they would like it
to (a league title), perhaps they will look back on this week as the biggest in program history. A week
of breakthroughs and fantastic finishes. A week of questions answered and statements made—to others, indeed, but more importantly, to themselves.
