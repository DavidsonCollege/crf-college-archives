_THE DAVIDSONIAN_

TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 9, 1999

Ladies and gentlemen, repeat after me: vagina (you) clitoris (you) vulva (you) penis (you) testicles (you) pubic hair (you). It’s
not easy, is it? It isn’t comfortable, either. People think you are a sexually frustrated freak-show for saying these forbidden
words out loud without warning or context. Little do they know that you are just warming up for Human Sexuality
Week, sponsored by the Rape Awareness Committee (R.A.C.).

R.A.C. invites all members of the Davidson Community to join in our celebration of sexuality, sensuality, and the body. It
starts Thursday, Feb. 11 and lasts through Sunday, Feb. 14. The buzzword for Human Sexuality Week will be communication. Our
main goal is to help students recognize and feel more comfortable talking about their bodies, experiences, and feelings. These communication
skills can be applied to sexually intimate situations, where clear verbal communication is necessary to obtain consent for all degrees
of sexual activity between partners.

In addition to enhancing communication skills, Human Sexuality Week’s events aim to raise some important questions. We will attempt to
answer questions like: how would you define sexuality? How would you define sensuality? What’s the difference between a sensual experience
and a sexual experience? How large a part does sexuality play in the experience of being human? What makes me
a sensual or a sexual person? Can you be a sensual person without being sexually active? What is it like
to be a virgin at Davidson? These are just a few of the questions that will be addressed, in particular,
at the CROP lunch sponsored by the R.A.C. on Thursday.

If Human Sexuality Week has a message, it’s that you don’t have to be sexually active to be a sexual
human being. We’re out to show that sexuality can be uniquely defined by an individual in terms of his or
her spirituality, body, language, rhythm, art, and sensuality. Redefining one’s own sexuality is an empowering endeavor that builds self-esteem and
helps prevent occurrences of rape and sexual assault for both men and women.

Come out, support, interact, enjoy!

Sail away with Davidson Outdoors

By Kyle Erikson
Staff Writer

There is relief from the flood of reviews, papers, and exams. Spring break is just around the corner. If you
are still looking for plans, let Davidson Outdoors help. Davidson Outdoors has a couple of tricks up its sleeve to
help make your break one to remember. I had the chance to sit down with the President of D.O., Mr.
Kurt Yusi, and he gave me the down low on the sweet times that are available this break.

Davidson Outdoors is sponsoring two official trips with the possibility of a third. The first trip is co-sponsored with the
Hurricane Island Outward Bound center in Big Pine Key, Florida. This is D.O.’s sailing adventure. Two boats with a total
of eleven people each will be setting off for five days to navigate the crystal waters of the Keys. The
boats will sail from one palm tree-lined island to another.
