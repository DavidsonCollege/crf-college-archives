Jimmy the Freek

Freek picks IMAC winners.

If anyone has doubts about who the #1 team in the "A" league is, your doubts have been laid to
rest by our expert panel. A similar poll was taken last year and turned out to be very reliable in
rating the top 10 basketball powerhouses.

Those who frequent the gym quite often to view games have all agreed that I Felta Thi is the choice
for the top position. However, they also commented that the balance of top teams is the best in years. Following
is a list of the IMAC top 10 (based on a 10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1 system) with first place votes, total poll points,
various pollsters' comments, and finally my own odds for the playoffs:

(Continued from page 9)

B: I don’t think the players will get discouraged. Enough happens out on the floor, in the locker room, on
the bus, that people don’t see that keep the team together. The typical Davidson student doesn’t like words such as
mental toughness but that’s what it is. Very rarely do we hop on a kid for making a mistake. We
hop on them when we don’t get good effort which tends to happen in practice. What’s really important to a
kid’s confidence is the way his peers, the other players, treat him. This is much more important than anything a
coach can say to a player.

Q: Another question often asked is why you use a type of negative substitution where players are taken out for
making a mistake during the game.

B: That’s true—I get mad at myself when I watch the films and see that. It really gripes me and
yet I’ll look again and see some kid not get down the floor three times in a row and get
mad at myself for not taking him out. But that’s natural; that happens. As long as the mistake is one
of commission that’s all right but when it is a mental mistake they should be taken out.

Q: But when you take a kid out for making a mistake he is forced to sit on the bench
and think about his mistake. Aren’t you afraid that a player could lose confidence in himself that way?

B: That’s true, but in a period of 40 substitutions during a night maybe five are of that nature. Another
thing we so often get is when a kid hits three jump shots in a row and we take him
out. People ask “what the hell?” The kid is sucking air—he needs a rest—so we take him out.

Q: You have drawn several technical fouls this year and at least one, during the Clemson game, significantly hurt your
team’s chances for victory. Don’t you think you’re drawing too many technical fouls?

B: I get upset by the technical fouls; I especially hate to get them when we've got the ball, as
in the game against Clemson. The only thing I’ve got to say in defense of the technical fouls is you’ve
got to know when to get them. You can’t just get them for the hell of it. The reason for
technical fouls is this: some coaches will nit-pick all night and upset the refs to the point where the team
will start getting bad breaks on calls. My philosophy is to keep your mouth shut until they do something bad—then
you step out, bodycheck them, get the foul and get on with it. I don’t want my players to get
one and I think I take that load off of them.

Q: Do you feel your job is in jeopardy?

B: No. If I thought I was going to be fired you wouldn’t see me yelling at the players and
jumping up and down at the games. I would simply sit there and love the kids all the time.
