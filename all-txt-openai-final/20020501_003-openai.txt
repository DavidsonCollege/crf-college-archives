This Week We Are Going To Do:
Year in Review
We are going to look at what worked and what didn’t these last seven weeks and plan ahead for next
year as we say goodbye to our seniors. There will be free food.

The year is coming to an end and I'd like to wish the outgoing seniors the best of luck in
the future, you will be missed. Everyone please feel free to come to our meeting Thursday night at 9 p.m.
in the Sprinkle Room of the Union.

Sincerely,

Grady Patterson
