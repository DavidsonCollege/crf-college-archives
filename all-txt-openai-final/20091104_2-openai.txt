### THE DAVIDSONIAN

#### Spanish Author Laura Freixas Visits Davidson College

**By MARIELLE ABALO, Guest Writer**

Hailing from a country known not only as a rich historic and cultural relic but also as the birthplace of
famous literary works such as “Don Quijote de la Mancha” and “The Cid” (and for many Davidson students, the location
of a fantastic summer study abroad program in Cádiz), the Spanish author Laura Freixas spent a few days visiting Davidson
College last week. Her brief stay, which included class discussions, meals with students, and a creative writing workshop, culminated in
her lecture “Souls in Purgatory — or Why I Became A Writer.”

Growing up as a woman in Francoist Spain, Laura Freixas recounted the restrictive and formalized social positions for women, who
were confined to the roles of housewives and caretakers. The Franco regime favored men as absolute household heads, and as
such, men enjoyed freedoms that were only available to women with the approval of their fathers or husbands. However, as
Freixas is quick to note, there remained a glaringly obvious (yet unnoticed and uncensored) route of escape from the everyday
lives of household women: literature.

Through literature, Freixas and her mother traveled to new countries and places, explored new landscapes and lifestyles, discovered and enjoyed
freedoms such as non-chaperoned trips, liberty of choice, and the voicing of frank, honest opinions. Her two separate lives, one
through literature and the other that of a girl growing up in the male-oriented Francoist society, demonstrate the dichotomy that
has existed for Freixas. This dichotomy is evident in her fiction and her literary criticism. Freixas feels that her literature
should be seen as “literature,” not “literature written by a woman.” Freixas seeks to communicate that literature has the potential
to be enjoyed and appreciated by all regardless of sex, gender, race, ethnic group, nationality, and other dividing factors.

#### Laura Freixas Defies Classifications

Using her rich, multicultural, and multilingual background (Freixas is fluent in Catalan, Spanish, French, and English), as well as her
experiences in two socio-economic classes, Freixas attempts to bring her work to a gender-neutral status where it will be critiqued
and analyzed by its contents, style, and literary technique and not by the sex and gender of its author.

Dr. Kyra Kietrys, who along with Dr. Angela Willis organized Freixas’s visit, commented: “I hope the students who attended Laura
Freixas’s lecture were able to open their minds to a different view of the world that could be applied either
to their personal lives or their understanding of Spanish.” Noting the history of Spain and the context of Freixas’s writing,
Kietrys further notes that “hopefully students learned to differentiate between the terminologies of literature written by women and literature written
for women. One does not imply the other; they are very different.”

Kietrys met and was favorably impressed by Freixas when she delivered a keynote speech at a conference of the International
Association of Feminine Hispanic Culture and Literature last fall. Kietrys started thinking about the possibility of inviting Freixas for a
talk at Davidson College. Dr. Hernández-Chiroldes’s “Intermediate Spanish” class, Willis’s “Advanced Grammar” class, and Kietrys’s “Introduction to Spanish Literature and
Culture” and Senior Seminar classes have read and discussed Freixas’s writings.

Freixas is interesting in that neither her literature nor she herself can be readily categorized: she is Spanish, but received
French schooling; she is a woman, but writes for all regardless of sex and gender; and, while she shows respect
and appreciation for her country, she is also quick to point out...out its weaker points, describing Madrid as “ruidosa” (noisy)
and deploring the lack of environmental awareness throughout Spain and much of Europe. The collaboration of the Spanish, English, and
French Departments, OLAS (Organization of Latin American Students), Dean Rusk, DIA (Davidson International Association), the Gender Studies concentration, and the
Public Lectures Committee sponsored Freixas’s talk which was attended by approximately 100 students, staff, faculty, and members of the Davidson
community.

SGA discusses housing lottery
CRISTINA BUSTILLO

This week’s SGA meeting began with Dean Patty Perillo taking the floor in order to discuss some new policies and
changes in the Housing Lottery. Perillo acknowledged that the process can be extremely stressful for students and that having the
right place to live can immensely influence students’ lives. Last year, a group of students collaborated to produce some recommendations
for RLO in regards to the housing lottery, and most of them agreed that withholding lottery numbers could be beneficial
to the process. One of the main concerns that RLO and Dean Perillo have is that students have been found
to have created apartments with people that have good lottery numbers and then students switch rooms “through the back door.”

“Switching rooms/apartments without prior approval of RLO will be treated as an honor code violation,” Perillo said. Even though withholding
lottery numbers could be a solution to this problem, RLO will not be withholding lottery numbers in the next lottery
because they believe that students can be mature enough to go through the process knowing their number.

Some other changes in the lottery will be that next year there will be more time between the lottery for
apartments in F (5 students per apartment) and the rest of Martin Court (4 students per apartment). There will be
two weeks between these lotteries, which will allow students that do not get a 5-student apartment to regroup and find
a living situation in which they will be comfortable. In addition to this, there will be a social networking time
for those students that do not have a roommate or those students that want to live in an apartment and
are missing people. An Info Session for students going abroad, where everything they need to know will be discussed, has
also been planned.

Another change that will be taking place is that superclusters will be reduced to five to seven people, and singles
in the sophomore apartments will be treated as part of the supercluster. The idea behind this is that there will
not be one or two people out that do not know the rest of the hall.

After Perillo’s intervention, the new events that the External Affairs committee is planning were discussed. There will be an after-school
event on Fridays where Davidson students can play with some of the children from the town on the green by
the library. This will be funded by the town, and it will be further discussed with both SGA and the
town. In addition to this, they are also planning a “Senior Ball for Senior Citizens” which will be a nice
way for senior citizens to network and have a fun time. The tickets will be sold and there will be
an auction. All of the proceeds of the event will be donated to the Davidson fund.

Immediately after, Meikaela Zwieryznski ’10 proposed that SGA create a table where people that benefit from the Davidson Trust can
write a note to thank those who make the Davidson Trust possible.

“Davidson College made a commitment that no student will need loans in order to attend Davidson, and the Davidson Trust
makes this possible. But, the trust took a hit with the economic crisis and it is important that those that
make the Davidson Trust possible know that the students that benefit from it appreciate it greatly,” Zwieryznski said.

The meeting ended with the approval of this proposition.
