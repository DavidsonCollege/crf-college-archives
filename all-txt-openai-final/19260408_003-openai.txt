ling featured, made a big hit with the guests. In the midst of the program Harllee Branch, who was chairman of the Junior Speaking Committee, created quite a bit of excitement by asking all who were in favor of pushing the tables back and dancing, to say aye. He got a loud and favorable response from the crowd, but it all proved to be a false alarm, and offered in fun alone. The program ended with a toast to “The Ladies,” proposed by Branch. The gay crowd of beautiful girls, the music, the tango dancing, and the brightly lighted and decorated hall made the cabaret seem very real. The entertainment was a success in every sense of the word, and set a high standard for future classes to uphold.

“Grandpa, did you once have hair like snow?”

“Well, who shoveled it off?”

What is perhaps the first college to complete the college year held its commencement exercises March 22, when the Hobo College, of Chicago, graduated 150 students at the completion of the first year of the college's existence. Men who attended all of a series of lectures, clinics, musical concerts, and visits to art galleries listed on the college course, received diplomas, not of the sheepskin variety, but simple mimeographed sheets. The graduates heard a baccalaureate address, a speech by General Coxey, sang a group of songs about their own life and bade good-bye to their alma mater.

home on a fielder’s choice. Hatley had previously flied out. Mackie almost broke up the game when he crashed a long triple against the top of the centerfield fence, scoring Young and Webb. Oden went to the mound and struck out Jones, pinch-hitting for Dodderer, to end the game. Mackie, with a triple, double and single, and Sides, were Carolina's star hitters. Harry Vance did the best with the stick for Davidson, getting a home run and a double.
