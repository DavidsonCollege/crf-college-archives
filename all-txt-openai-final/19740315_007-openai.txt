1. Definition. "Campus Life" is defined herein as all those extra-curricular policies, programs, and activities having as their aim the
enrichment of the spiritual, social, and cultural lives of the College community and its individual members.

2. Responsibility. The President is primarily responsible to the Trustees for the development of policies and programs which will enhance
the quality of campus life in this total sense. To this end, he is authorized to employ, subject to Trustee
approval, administrative officers and staff personnel to conduct religious, social, and cultural programs and to make provision within the annual
budgets for their financial support. He maintains and encourages by all available means the fundamental relationship between the College and
the Presbyterian Church in the United States as a means of enrichment of the spiritual aspect of campus life. He
reports periodically to the Trustees on the state of campus life and makes recommendations for Trustee action to improve its
quality.

3. Council on Campus Life.
a) Composition. The Council on Campus Life consists of the Dean of Students, the President of the Student Body, and
six teaching Faculty members and seven students designated in such manner as their respective By-Laws provide. The Dean of Students
is Chairman of the Council, and the Coordinator of Student Activities and the Minister to Students shall serve as advisory
members.
b) Function. The Council is advisory to the President in all matters affecting the quality of campus life. At least
twice each academic year, in the Fall and Spring at times set by the President, the Council meets with the
President to give advice and recommendations pertaining to campus life. Prior to submission of any major proposal in respect of
policy or programs affecting campus life to the Trustees, the President shall inform the Council of its substance in time
to permit its consideration by the Council. By majority vote of the Council, a report opposing any substantial aspect of
the proposal, with a succinct statement of supporting reasons, shall accompany the proposal when submitted to the Trustees. Any such
report shall reflect the vote by which it was adopted. The President may decline to submit to the Council any
such proposal when in his judgment to do so would violate a personal or institutional confidence, or constitute an unwarranted
invasion of personal privacy, or jeopardize in a substantial way a fundamental institutional interest. Upon submission of any such proposal
to the Trustees, the President shall indicate whether or not it has been earlier submitted to the Council.
