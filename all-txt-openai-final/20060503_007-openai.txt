To Brad Poole,

Life passes by so quickly even when we try to carefully observe and absorb each precious moment. Now it is
time for you to graduate and continue on this amazing journey for which you are traveling.

As God leads you down this path, we know His grace and blessings will sustain you in this new adventure
at Wake Forest.

It has been a joy for us to witness your growth while at Davidson, in and out of the classroom.
From living in the chemistry building to your leadership on the Men’s Swim Team, we have enjoyed being a part
of the ride. Best wishes for an exciting and fulfilling future!

All our love,
Mom, Dad, and Lee
