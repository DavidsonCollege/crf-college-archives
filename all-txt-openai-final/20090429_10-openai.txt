10 THE Davidsonian Wednesday, APRIL 29, 2009

Congratulations Cary!

Four years of papers, exams, foreign
language requirements, econometric
analysis, that weird Roman history course,
cheering on the Wildcats, getting into
Omicron Delta Epsilon, semesters abroad
and time away from home...
you finally did it!

Zain
congratulations on your graduation!
We are very proud of you.
