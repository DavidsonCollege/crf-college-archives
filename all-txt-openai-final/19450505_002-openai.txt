Music News
By HOLLINGER

Mrs. Potter of Asheville presented a piano recital, April 30th, Monday evening, in Chambers Auditorium, under the sponsorship of the music department. The artist’s program featured the Bach Prelude in A Minor, a Mozart fantasy in C Minor, and the “Waldstein” Sonata of Beethoven. A native of Texas, Mrs. Carroll became well-known as a pianist there before going to Chicago while yet in her teens to study under Fanny Bloomfield Zeisler, then the world’s outstanding woman pianist. When she was 21 she went to Vienna where she studied under Leschetizky and Busoni, both world-renowned teachers. She has the distinction of being the only person to have studied under both these men at the same time. Later she gained a distinguished continental concert reputation by extensive tours. In this country she has appeared with leading orchestras and has taught at the Busch Conservatory. She is the wife of Dr. Robert S. Carroll, director of the Highland Hospital in Asheville. Through Mrs. Carroll's influence, the Mozart Festivals were begun several years ago in that city.

cancer may depend on heredity, it is definitely not contagious. “Early discovery and diagnosis is the principal factor in producing cure of cancer,” the speaker said. Although so-called cures for cancer are reported every few days, so far no real cure for cancer has been discovered. There are cures for some kinds of cancer, but these will not work for other types of the dread disease.

“At present there are three principal methods of treating cancer: surgery, X-ray, and radium. Nevertheless, there is still a lot that we do not know about cancer. An unknown factor enters in,” stated the speaker. In some cases medical science can do nothing; in other cases the disease can be checked only temporarily, and the individual merely ‘salvaged’ until again the malady makes a fresh assault; in an encouraging number of instances a complete cure may be effected.

The doctor concluded with a statement of the reasons why these
