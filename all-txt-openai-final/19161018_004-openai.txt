Negative: Byrd, Grey. Declamations: Harold, King, Liston. WEEKLY MEETINGS. The subject for Saturday night, October 14th, “Resolved that the judges of the Supreme Court should be elected by popular vote,” was upheld on the affirmative by C. B. Robson, Cousar, Bellingrath, and Bachman, who contended that the present system of appointment of Supreme Court judges is inconsistent with democracy and leads towards monarchy; that it has been a failure in the past, and there would be too much power placed into the hands of a few. The negative, defended by Bennett, Fraser, Price, and Matthews, argued that the electorate was incompetent of judging the ability of lawyers from the judicial standpoint; that popular election tends to lower the standard of the judiciary; that it hampers the independence in case decisions, and that past history upholds the system of appointment. The decision of both the house and judges was in favor of the negative. Under the head of initiation of new members, J. S. Bachman and G. M. King were received into the society. After the usual opening exercises in the Phi Society on Saturday night, a rather one-sided debate, from the viewpoint of merit, was held. Those upholding the affirmative were: R. W. Robinson, R. L. Murray, T. N. Morton, B. H. Leyburn, and D. C. Stagner. Those on the negative were: R. H. Stone, J. A. Thames, W. C. Neel, and G. D. Sample. The negative won out by unanimous decision of the judges, and the house also decided in their favor. In the Phi Society, the following program was rendered Monday morning: C. G. Brown gave a declamation entitled “Christopher Columbus”; L. L. Wilson gave “The Opportunities of a Scholar,” by Grady; L. R. Lacy spoke a selection by W. C. Bryant; and D. M. Chalmers’ subject was “The Destiny of America.” The following men gave orations: E. P. Nisbet, on “The Sixteenth Belligerent,” showing why Greece enters the war on the side of the Allies, and how the people aroused the king to enter the struggle. J. W. Mann spoke on “The Larger Duties of a College Man,” showing how the world expects the college man to be the leader in every walk of life. O. C. Williamson was appointed on. His oration on “The Moonlight School Movement,” showing the needs of and work accomplished in these schools in North Carolina. On Monday morning, in the Eumenean Society, the following declamations were given: C. J. Hollandsworth, “Excelsior”; C. F. Allen, “The Man With His Hat In His Hand.” A. P. Saunders gave a discussion on “The Committee Leaders of the Next Congress,” in which he compared the records of the Democratic and Republican leaders whose appointments depend upon the turn in the Presidential tide. L. W. Thomas gave an oration on “The Value of Physical Education,” showing that the mental, in education, depends upon the physical. THE NOVEMBER MAGAZINE.
