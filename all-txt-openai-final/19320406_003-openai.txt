THE DAVIDSONIAN, APRIL 6, 1932

GOLFERS TAKE EXTENDED SOUTHERN TRIP

THE SPORTS PARADE

TENNIS TEAM MEETS SOUTH CAROLINA

Who said there was a depression? You can’t prove it by Davidson College. The debating team has gone on a trip north to Pennsylvania, the golf team has gone south to Georgia and Florida, the R.O.T.C. department is sending representatives to St. Louis, the president will probably be off on some goodwill tour ere long... and meanwhile, the rest of us will stay at home and work to pay off the mortgage on the ole homestead.

When the boys begin to play indoor baseball on the outside, which they are doing today, then we may know that spring has truly come. Cavorting gaily around the dusty arena betwixt Georgia, Chambers, the gym, and the barracks, they lift their voices in lusty triumph as some Lilliputian Thor swings his puny hammer and knocks a spherical bit of horsehide-covered sawdust into the air. Oh to be a kid again!

Although Davidson golf teams have in the past usually managed to trim their opponents by decisive margins, the loss of the two veterans, Sparrow Mills and Jack Pepper, has somewhat weakened the team, and the 1932 foursome failed to defeat the Generals of Washington and Lee. On the other hand, a defeat of 11½ to 6½ is by no means ignominious, and Jack Wagner, captain, played practically on even terms with young Billy Howell, who, incidentally, advanced to the semi-finals in the national amateur tournament last year.

What a tough break to lose a baseball game in the ninth inning! The ’Cats displayed a good brand of ball playing last week against Lenoir-Rhyne and had maintained a 2-0 lead up to the ninth inning, only to weaken and let three runs go by. These ’Cats have a peculiar habit of inconsistent playing which often proves disastrous as we have seen in the past two weeks. When they play well they play practically perfectly, but when they're off their game... well, that’s another story.

In Winston-Salem on Easter Monday this writer had the pleasure of witnessing the Davidson-Carolina game. With the exception of a first inning nightmare in which Carolina scored six runs, the ’Cats played good ball, fielding well (except for one incident quite a bit back of first base which we shall omit), and hitting the Tar Heel pitcher’s bullet ball at will. The game ended 7-8. The ’Cats should have won this game.

There are baseball teams and football teams... golf teams and tennis teams... basketball teams and wrestling teams. But the team whose membership has shown the most recent rapid increase is the Pan-Hellenic team... that is, if one may judge by the number of letters received around here lately...

On Wednesday the tennis team will officially open its schedule with the University of South Carolina, the match to be played here. Opening matches seldom prove the calibre of a team, but this match should show some indication of the relative strength of the Wildcat tennis team. If this team should be as successful as last year’s, we shall be more than satisfied.

The Davidson-University of Florida track meet proved quite interesting and showed that prospects for the Wildcat cindermen are good indeed, the feature of the meet being the breaking of the school vaulting record by Billy Flinn, who established a new record of 11 feet, 6 inches.

Elon Loses to ’Cats 8 to 4 on Diamond

On March 29 the Wildcats defeated the Elon Christians in a spirited baseball game by the score of 8 to 4. The Wildcats got off to a good start in the opening inning and scored two runs, a pass to Bernhardt and a wild throw by Waters, both men scoring, when Waters heaved Bradsher’s bunt wild to first. Elon tallied one in the first inning and tied the score in the second. In the fifth the Christians scored two more runs which put them in the lead. Davidson came back in the sixth with three tallies and won the game when three more Wildcats scampered home in the ninth.

Croker allowed the Christians six hits while the Wildcats took twelve from the Elon pitchers. Both teams showed quite a bit of loose fielding, but at times looked very good.

Florida Downs Wildcat Track Team in Exciting Meet on Davidson Field

Joe Hall Scores 23 Points to Lead ’Gators in Victory Over Davidson

The University of Florida made a final rally last Wednesday to defeat the Davidson tracksters on Richardson Field, 74 to 52. The three-point difference in the scores of an exciting meet was broadened to a wider margin when Florida took all three places in both the high jump and half-mile run. Joe Hall, national Decathlon competitor, hada great deal to do with winning the meet by capturing 23 points for Florida. Fleagle, flashing Davidson sprinter, was second high scorer with 10 points. Flinn also starred for Davidson, breaking his old record in the pole vault and taking second place in the broad jump. 

Summary:
100-yard dash—Fleagle (D), Small (F), Parnell (F). Time, 9.9 sec.

Davidson 'Cats Lose To Duke Power Nine

The Duke Power Company baseball nine of River Bend broke a knotted game here in the ninth inning to defeat the Davidson College Wildcats 9 to 6. A base on balls, a single by J. Rhyne, a triple by McLean, and a squeeze play broke the 6-6 count which was tied in the eighth when Whitley hit a homer for the Wildcats. The score was tied three different times. Pearce and Sherrill opposed each other on the mound for the full route. Pearce whiffed seven of the visitors but allowed four passes. The latter, coupled with the timely hitting of the Power boys, were Pearce’s undoing. They bunched hits in the sixth and ninth brackets plus two free passes to score three runs in each. Sherrill surrendered ten hits compared to the eleven Pearce allowed, but the visiting heaver kept them well scattered. Davidson's inability to hit in the pinches resulted in 11 men left on bases. Whitley, Davidson catcher, who played but half the game, featured in the hitting, getting two safe blows out of two trips. Davidson's fielding was almost perfect compared with numerous miscues of the visitors.

Score by innings:
Duke Power ..........000 113 103—9
Davidson ...............101 021 010—6

Lenoir-Rhyne Downs Wildcat Nine on Friday

Visitors Score Three Runs in Ninth to Gain 3 to 2 Victory

Lenoir-Rhyne, after being held scoreless for eight innings, staged a comeback in the ninth to turn defeat into victory and beat the Davidson Wildcats 3 to 2 on Richardson Field last Friday. Three bases on balls, two off Baily and one off Pearce who relieved him, coupled with two singles off Pearce, gave the visitors their three runs. Baily, due to his wildness, found himself in several tight holes during the first eight innings, but each time pulled through without yielding a score.

W. and L. Generals Win Over Davidson Golfers At Charlotte Golf Club

Billy Howell, National Amateur Sensation in 1931 Tournament, Aids Visitors in Victory

Aided by the scintillating performance of young Billy Howell, the Washington and Lee golfers decisively defeated the Wildcat team last week by a score of 11½ to 6½ at the Charlotte Country Club. Billy Howell, nationally known as a result of his sparkling play in last year’s national amateur tournament, was matched with Jack Wagner, Davidson captain. Both shot consistently fine golf, but Howell’s game showed a bit more finesse and polish, and he emerged victor only after a heated struggle. The score of this match was three up and two to go. For the thirty-six holes played, Howell had a medal of 151 strokes, outpointing Wagner by five.

Mac Manson, playing number two for the 'Cats, defeated Jack Guggenheim of the Generals for three points. John D. McConnell and Winfred Donham broke even and Tom Caldwell lost by 2½ points to Henry Cohen of W. and L. The Wildcats lost in both foursome matches. Howell and Johnny Schroeder paired up and defeated Wagner and McConnell two out of three points; and Cohen and Donham of W. and L. got together to drop Manson and Caldwell 2½ points. The matches were well run off and a sizeable gallery followed the play.

Wildcat Tennis Team Opens Season Today

On Wednesday, April 6, the Davidson tennis team will open its season with a game with the University of South Carolina here. The University of South Carolina were state champions last year and are expected to be almost as good this year. The Davidson team is also good and a heated battle will probably be the result. Davidson's team in the singles will consist of Lafferty, Calder, Myers, TEnloe, Halverstadt, and Roddey. In the doubles it will be the same, paired as follows: Calder and Myers, Enloe and Roddey, Lafferty and Halverstadt. Calder will be the acting captain for Davidson and the games will begin about 2:30.
