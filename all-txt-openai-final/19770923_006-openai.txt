WHY NOT?

Fellow Beer Persons,

Life is full of unanswered questions such as: Is there intelligent life elsewhere in the universe? And if so, do
they wear socks?

In beer, however, there are no unanswered questions. Because there is only one word for beer, and you know it.

Schlitz.

Therefore, as your Dean of Beer, I suggest you research the essential rightness of the word for yourself at your
next social function. Or even your next antisocial function.

And please note: The recommended source material for locating the word can be found in any phone booth. In other
words, look in the Yellow Pages. Under “Beer.”

Thank you.
