GEORGIA GIANT

Because of bad weather conditions, the
tennis tournament has not advanced rapidly.
However, four players have reached the
quarter finals: Raph Coonrad, Jerry New-
bold, Myron Sandifer, and Dexter Withering-
ton.

Coonrad gained his position by easily
defeating DeLanoy in two love sets, and by
winning on a forfeit from Carl Coffey.
Newbold reached the quarters by victories
over George McAden (6-0, 6-4) and John
Craven (6-0, 6-0). Sandifer received a bye
and then went on to beat Andy Owen (6-2,
6-1). Witherington received a first-round
bye and then defeated Paul Starling in a
close match (9-7, 6-2).

There are two first-round matches and
four second-round matches to be played
before the tourney undergoes any rapid
changes. It is hoped that the tournament
will be completed by the end of next week,
August 7. All who have matches are urged
to play them as soon as possible.

Seeded Number One on the entrance list
is Mike Williams of North Wilkesboro;
Number Two is Jerry Newbold of Wilmington.

SQUADRON "D" BESTS ALL-STARS

In the first of a series of games to be
played between the college and the air
cadets, Squadron "D" of the Training De-
tachment defeated the league All-Stars by
the score of 4-0. Cadet Wood hurled a no-
hitter for the Flyers, with only two of the
college players reaching second base. Aside
from his no-hit performance, Wood struck
out seven of eight consecutive batters.
Spencer allowed the Cadets five hits, which
they were able to bunch together for tal-
lies.

Included on the college line-up were:
Spencer, p.; Sandifer, c.; Siegel and Owen, 1b.;
McAden and Ervin, 2b.; Hert, ss.; Johnston and
Shannon, sf.; McGavock, 3b.; Smith, lf.; A-
shmore and Pritchett, cf.; F. Jones, rf.

ALL-STARS

As the second half of the softball sea-
son swung into action, the Georgia Giants
were in a tie with Watts 3-4 for the lea-
gue lead with one win each.

Opening the season with well-matched
line-ups, the two teams from Watts were
entangled in a tight pitching duel until
the sixth inning when Watts 3 exploded for
four runs and a commanding lead. The runs
were made on a combination of three hits
and two costly errors. Leading the winners
at bat were Dalton and Watt, who secured
two for three each. Bill Grey of Watts 1
led his team with the same percentage.

In what was deemed one of the crucial
engagements of the season, a balanced team
from Georgia 3 spilled the Town Terrors
four to three. The Terrors had swept the
first half of the season without a loss,
but the much-improved Georgia team held
the lead from the first. All four of their
runs came as a result of an outburst in
the first inning, in which they capitalized
on three hits, three errors, and a walk to
tally four times. Town came back to score
one run in the second, another in the third,
and the final in the fourth. Costly errors
were a handicap to both teams, but the hits
were evenly distributed -- six for Georgia
and seven for Town. Davis and Williams of
Georgia led the attack with one for four
each. Siegel and McGavock paced the losers
with two for four. Batteries: Evans and
Belk; Sandifer and Erwin. Umpire: Smith.
