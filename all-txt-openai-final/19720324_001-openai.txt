**Cornell Projects New $5.89 Million Budget**
By ALEC HOON
Managing Editor

Davidson College will operate on a tentative budget of $5.894 million next year, an increase of $163,000, Vice President for
Finance and Development C. David Cornell announced on Tuesday. “There will definitely be a $225 increase in tuition for next
year, bringing the maximum fee to $3,390 for a student eating in the college union facilities,” Cornell stated. “We feel
that such a tuition increase will still keep Davidson competitive with other comparable colleges,” he said.

Cornell took the budget, which had been prepared by the business office, to a Budget, Building and Grounds meeting on
Monday for recommendations by faculty members and students. He stated that this tentative budget will now go back to the
business office to see if any additional cuts can be made. “We will try to further cut some minor things
to reduce the budget another $20,000 to $50,000 to make sure that we don’t run a deficit next year,” Cornell
said.

About $25,000 to $30,000 has been outlayed for capital needs. This will be spent in three areas: (1) to improve
campus lighting; (2) to install a new voltage regulator; and (3) to build a new road behind the gym. “Unfortunately,
there are some improvements that need to be made that we just did not have money to fund. It was
a question of ordering the college priorities,” Cornell explained.

The money for lighting ($12,000 to $15,000) is the source of some controversy. The funds are to be used to
light up the area between Chambers and Main Street to make this part of the campus safer for girls and
others at night, according to a plan submitted by Director of the Physical Plant Grover Meetze. In his plan, additional
money was to be spent over the next two years to further improve the lighting elsewhere on the campus. The
problem now is that the college has decided to further review Meetze’s plans (since they were first written several years
ago and may need revision), so that the money is there, but no plan.

No additional money has been put in the budget to cover the hiring of more security personnel. This has been
the subject of much student concern, especially in light of the recent attacks on coeds. Cornell indicated that several options
are being studied, including the use of students to patrol as work-study jobs and the hiring of a larger force.
“We feel that we have financed this adequately for next year,” he said.

The second expenditure will be for a new voltage regulator to handle any current overloads. “We have been fortunate not
to have ruined the computer already, because at times the current has dipped to hazardous levels. The regulator should correct
this,” Cornell noted.

**And For This Choice Morsel**
Jim Ellison presides over Wednesday’s slave sale sponsored by the Tri-Delta sorority of U.N.C.C. to aid its scholarship program. The
girls raised $76 for their afternoon’s efforts, which included cleaning rooms and fraternity houses, serving as bar maids, and just
about anything you could convince them to do.

**Action Postponed On Coeducation**
By BILL GIDUZ
Asst. Managing Editor

The Educational Policy Committee (EPC) was unable to act on their coeducation report Tuesday because they still have not received
a report on the financial feasibility of going coed. A request for an analysis of the cost of coeducation was
formally submitted to a subcommittee of the Budget, Building and Grounds Committee over a month ago.Completed, the financial report will
be incorporated into the final EPC report. According to Vice President of Academic Affairs John M. Bevan, the unfinished finance
report is the only thing delaying the presentation of the final report to the faculty. Bevan now expects that the
financial report will be finished by April 3 and the complete EPC report presented to the faculty on April 11.
Vice President for Finance and Development C. David Cornell explained the delay in the finance report by saying that Comptroller
Robert W. Davidson has been busy with this year’s as well as last year’s budget. Sophomore Doug Brown, who is
a member of the EPC, rejected Cornell's explanation, saying, “When the EPC subcommittee was set up around the first of
the year, Mr. Cornell also set up (See COEDUCATION, Page 10).

Faculty Monopoly Stagnates College
By RICH WILSON
Editor-in-Chief

(Ed. Note: This is the second in a series of articles entitled “Campus Governance: Crisis of Authority.”)

In practice, Davidson’s present governance system is one long and bitter game of king of the mountain in which the
faculty occupies the peak of decision-making, while administrators and students strive for a greater share of authority. The original rules
for this game were set down as the Faculty Constitution five years ago. At that time the trustees, playing the
role of omniscient gods, thought wisely to allow a trial period for this system before finally ratifying it. Their caution
proved very wise indeed. In the intervening years, the weaknesses in the original set of rules were magnified many times.

The primary weakness of the Faculty Constitution is that the faculty claims responsibility for all matters “which affect directly and
indirectly the educational atmosphere of the college.” But in an academic institution, it is difficult to find an issue that
does not affect the educational atmosphere of the college; consequently, the faculty gave itself the responsibility for almost everything. It
is clear from the endless faculty votes on open dorms that they are not qualified to be the sole judge
of student conduct. It is also clear that the faculty should not have sole control of the academic curriculum, since
many GPA and educationally valuable programs have been vetoed, while such programs as Area Exams are approved without regard to
their educational effect.

While students and administrators have a token input at the committee level, the faculty’s monopoly of power excludes these constituencies
in the final decision-making process. Certainly, the faculty should cast a large majority of the votes on educational issues, but
the Faculty Constitution is so constructed that this body excludes the other constituencies from any final say. It is this
condition which has caused the students and the administration to challenge the faculty’s authority on several occasions and has caused
the factionalism of the present governance system.

While the basic problem of Davidson’s governance system is the faculty’s monopoly of power, this situation has produced many side
effects in the governance process. Secrecy is the standard policy of all deliberations. Most faculty committee meetings are held behind
closed doors with its members sworn to confidentiality. And general faculty meetings are even more mysterious. Students are banned from
the meetings and attendance of administrators is frowned upon.

A second side effect of this process is that there are no formal procedures for voicing grievances. In short, there
is no further appeal than the faculty. If this body kills an academic proposal, the issue is dead with little
prospect of revision or resuscitation. A third effect is that it is difficult to hold the faculty accountable for any
action they may take.
