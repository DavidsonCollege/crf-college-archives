BETA-KS SCRAP MAY DECIDE FRAT CROWN

ASHEVILLE-BILTMORE FINAL TEST FOR KITTENS

CATISTICS - Through Nov. 11, 1950

By WALLACE ABBOTT

At the closing week of the intramural season, around the campus can be heard both moans and sounds of relief on the parts of the sports managers of the various fraternities. Many of them are glad the year is just about over, but there are a choice few who wish they had it all to do over again, thinking that maybe they would get “the breaks” this time. However, the season is within a week of being over, and it appears that the Betas and Kappa Sigs will settle it in their game next week.

ATO 4 - Phi Gam 2

Although it has taken the ATO’s a long time to gain their first season victory, when they finally did, they won it soundly. It was the Phi Gams who were the victims of a rejuvenated ATO team which didn’t have a pass completed against them all day. For the ATO's the passing of Jim Schupin and the receiving of John Whitfield were the essential elements in their victory.

Phi Delts 6 - SPE’s 6

Although both teams got off to very slow starts, it was the Phi Delts who came to life first and thus were able to edge past the SPE's on First Downs 4-0. The Phi Delt touchdown was tallied by Bill Bacon on a short run. A long pass from Bruce Frye to Yale Greer.

Standings Through Wednesday

| Won | Lost |
|------|------|
| Kappa Sigs | 8 | 1 |
| Betas | 8 | 1 |
| Sigma Chi | 7 | 2 |
| Phi Delts | 7 | 3 |
| SAE | 6 | 3 |
| KA | 5 | 4 |
| Phi Gam | 3 | 6 |
| Pi Kapps | 3 | 6 |
| ATO | 0 | 9 |

Betas 6 - KA 6

A strong KA team didn’t have quite enough strength to stop an even stronger Beta aggregation, as the Betas won out on First Downs 4-2. The Beta passing attack was probably the deciding factor; Chuck Elliot doing the passing and Tommy Langford, the receiving. Defensively, Mike Myers was once more the Beta standout. For the KA’s Bill Bird’s passing and running were the two factors that kept them in the game.

Sigma Chis 6 - Phi Delts 0

Heads up football all through this game by the Sigma Chis, was the deciding factor which gave them a well-deserved victory over a strong Phi Delt team. Both teams showed excellent defensive strength, but neither one was able to get much of an offensive started. However, the Sigma Chis had enough of an offensive in Berry and Kelton to lead them to a victory. On the Phi Delt team Bill Bacon did his usual fine job of passing, taking advantage of many capable receivers.

Kappa Sigs 14 - Phi Gams 0

The Kappa Sigs got off to a slow start in their game with the Phi Gams, but came back strong near the end to gain a victory. The Kappa Sigs took advantage of several good breaks to score, one of them being the completion of a thrice batted-up pass. Slimy Sloan found capable receivers in Dan Page and Charlton Torrence, and thus was able to complete a large number of his tosses. For the Phi Gams the line play of Doubles and Hall were the only encouraging factors.

SAE 6 - Pi Kapp 2

The SAE’s had a lot of uneasy moments before they finally eked out a victory over the Pi Kapps. The SAE’s were able to score on a short pass to Bob Bennet from Monty Hill. For the Pi Kapps, Mitchell Patton and Bill Cassells played fine games on offense and defense.

Betas 24 - ATO’s 0

The Betas continued to show their offensive power, as they rolled over the ATO’s 24-0. A strong running attack, featuring double and triple reverses, was the outstanding show of power. Most of the Beta TD’s were scored by Chuck Elliot on their end sweeps. Although the ATO's put up a determined fight throughout the game they were never able to do any good.

Last week’s winners:
1. Leighton McGill.
2. Wallace Abbott.

Chesterfield SPORTS QUIZ

1. N. C. State scored its first two points against Davidson last Saturday night on a safety. What is the official’s signal for such a score?
2. The greatest record of consistency at the plate is his. He batted .300 or better for 23 consecutive years, 1906-1928. He is one of baseball's all-time greats, some say its greatest. What's his name?
3. Bowl thoughts are in the air again, but with the Big Ten-Rose Bowl agreement, that bowl is losing its lustre. Can you even name the teams that met there January 1, 1950, and the score?

Richardson Field Scene of Battle Today at 2 O'clock

By LINDLEY BEARDSLEY

Saturday afternoon at Richardson Stadium, Coach Baird's thrice-beaten Wildkittens take on Asheville-Biltmore Jr. College in a tilt scheduled for 2 p.m. The Kits are perhaps in the best shape they have been in all season. Constantly hampered by injuries and ineligible players, they have had a hard time making ends meet. This Saturday the entire squad will be ready to go except for Hershel Allen who has a separated shoulder. The considerably in that last week's game with Gardner-Webb was postponed thus giving them two weeks to work for Asheville-Biltmore. The Kit's offense will be mainly in the air with Johnny Grey doing the flinging. The Kittens looked good against the Varsity this week with Grey completing some passes for long gains.

TD's For State To Nip Cats, 15-7

By CHARLIE HAWKINS

The North Carolina State football team evidently forgot to take into account that Davidson’s Wildcats were still the scrappers of bygone days at Raleigh last Saturday night. The Wildcats did a little rebounding of their own, but a brilliant bid for victory fell short as the Wolfpack came out on top of a close 15-7 score. The story behind the game was Davidson's great defensive play. The same Wildcat line had been clawed to pieces by a strong VMI team just the week before.Before. Against State, however, the resemblance wasn’t the same, as Davidson's forward wall held time after time, diagnosing Wolfpack plays expertly and smashing them. In the third quarter, State's all-purpose tailback Ed Mooney spearheaded a drive to the Wildcat seven-yard line, where it was first down. The ball ended up on the Davidson three as the Cat line held. Seconds later, when Auburn Lambeth faded back into the end zone to pass, the State line rushed in to make him fumble. The ball squirted out of a State player's hands into the hands of a Davidson defender, who fell on it for a safety, giving State a 2-0 lead.

A few minutes after the fourth quarter began, Wolfpack tackle Regis Lisk recovered a Wildcat fumble on the Davidson 38-yard line. Ed Mooney, who was a standout all night for State, passed to Jim O’Rourke on the one-yard line, and O’Rourke went over a few plays later for the score. A few minutes later, State got the ball deep in their own territory and drove 68 yards for a score. Ed Mooney passed to Jim O’Rourke again on the one-yard line, and this time Mooney himself went over. State’s blocking back, Ray Barkouskie, who had missed the first try for the extra point, made this one, and State's scoring ended at 15 points.

The only dope that the Kittens have on the Asheville-Biltmore squad is that they beat P. J. C. 56-0. The Kitten’s morale is high, and they are out to avenge the three defeats that they have suffered, and you can expect a much-improved team over the Kittens of old. The starting lineups will probably be: Andy Courts and Lee Knotts at ends, Neale Graham and Bob Loy at tackles, Bill Grey and Malphus Bradbury at guards, P. C. Davis at center, Johnny Grey at quarterback, Rod Herrellson at right half, Dan McCall at left half, and Bill Noel at fullback. You can expect a well-fought ball game Saturday as the Kits will throw everything in the book at Asheville-Biltmore in order to win this climax game.

Davidson received the kickoff from State and marched from their own 45-yard line to the Wolfpack 36. From here, fullback Ham Wade took a pitchout from quarterback Auburn Lambeth and rambled around end for a 36-yard score. It was a beautiful run as he moved down the sidelines to the 5-yard line and then reversed his field to run through a host of State tacklers. Ham's fine kicks and this run kept alive the Wade family's jinx on State; last year it was Jake Wade who ran 95 yards for the winning tally against the Wolfpack. Gordon Stuart converted for Davidson, and the scoring ended at 15-7.

Davidson uncovered a new running star in Roy White, who broke through the State line for gain after gain, and Auburn Lambeth completed five passes to up his total to 205. However, it was the whole Davidson defensive team that took the limelight in this well-played game.

Campus Interviews on Cigarette Tests
Number 6...THE TURTLE

“I should never have stuck my neck out!” They had our slow-moving brother moving at too fast a pace with those quick-trick cigarette tests! A fast puff...a swift sniff...a quick inhale...a rapid exhale. Terrapin’s head was spinning — didn’t know if he was coming or going! But he slowed down to his own speed — decided there was no need to rush. After all, he figured, how could anyone possibly prove cigarette mildness so fast? And he was right, too! That’s why we suggest: The sensible test...the 30-Day Camel Mildness Test, which simply asks you to try Camels as your steady smoke — on a pack after pack, day after day basis. No snap judgments needed. After you’ve enjoyed Camels — and only Camels — for 30 days in your “T-Zone” (T for Throat, T for Taste) we believe you'll know why...

More People Smoke Camels than any other cigarette!
