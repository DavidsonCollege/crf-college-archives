**FIFTH OF A SERIES: Psychology Unit Visits Morganton**

By JACK TRAWICK

That Davidson College was built by one of the female residents at Morganton, that persons have visited Mars, and that
we are all being bombarded by cosmotrons—such was the nature of the knowledge gained by members of Davidson's Abnormal Psychology
class on a recent trip to one of North Carolina's state mental institutions at Morganton. Other important data gathered included
the fact that Dr. W. G. Workman has latent snow-man charms, and that it appears that some of the Morganton
patients should be on the outside and some of us should be on the inside.

Approximately thirty Abnormal Psychology students made the trip and participated in an extended tour of the wards of the institution.
A short clinic was conducted by a charming female psychologist, during which two paranoid schizophrenic cases made talks to the
students.

Possibly the most interesting case observed during the trip was that of a gentleman whom we shall designate as Ira.
Ira, a middle-aged gentleman of short, stocky stature, was one of the paranoid schizophrenics who talked to the group during
the clinic part of the trip. He was neatly dressed in a coat and tie and came equipped with a
large scrapbook which included information on practically every well-known person in the scientific and religious areas. Ira was suffering from
a slight infection of the throat which caused a barely noticeable hoarseness. He promptly explained to us that each time
he was supposed to make a talk “they” bombarded his throat with sound waves in an attempt to keep him
from talking. He apologized profusely for this incapacitation. He then proceeded to explain that we were all being bombarded by
cosmotrons and that flying saucers were objects that were sent out by men to harm other men. He said that
these men tried to lay the blame for flying saucers on God, but that men are really back of it
all. We were also warned against stoves made by Sears and Roebuck that cook by light—they “cook your brain.” Back
in 1950, Jesus Christ appeared to Ira and imparted to him a vast knowledge of things to come. When asked
what Jesus looked like, Ira produced a picture of Jesus and then pointed out the differences between this picture and
the actual Christ—“You must remember that this is merely an artist’s conception.” Ira said that there was no talking done
during this meeting, but that all understanding was imparted through the medium of signs and symbols—“Besides, I figured if there
was going to be any talking, it would be done by Him.”

We encountered one elderly lady who looked as if she were prepared to step out for an evening at the
Metropolitan Opera. She had been grossly wronged in being brought to Morganton—why she didn't even have a transient disorder and
she had been “submitted to the indignity of wearing handcuffs” by a sheriff who had tricked her when she was
brought to Morganton. One of the students asked her if she thought she were going somewhere, or just why she
was wearing a fur coat. She replied with a touch of indignity, “Why are you wearing a coat—it’s a bit
chilly out today isn't it?” When asked if she were not warm with the coat on inside, she replied that
she was—she did not, however, make any motions toward removing the coat. When she finished her talk, she turned to
this student and said, “I just want you to know, that not only am I warm, I am incandescent with
anger!” She blew us a kiss and gave us a fond farewell, at the same time casting a particularly affectionate
look in the direction of Dr. Workman. Roberta had been released on probation once during her five-year stay at Morganton
but had to be returned when she became violent trying to persuade the management of a theatre in a North
Carolina town of her exceptional dramatic talent.

Then there was the case of Sally who had built Davidson, had been to Mars, and who had food stored
on the moon—“the moon is burned out, and cold and I have food stored there.” During the course of Sally's
expatiation, another young female patient came up and told several of us not to listen to her—“She's crazy.” There was
also the gentleman who said he liked Morganton very well, except for the fact that there were too many crazy
people there. Most of the patients encountered seemed to be very well satisfied with their conditions at Morganton, and even
the ones that wanted to be out said they were well fed and cared for, but that they had just
“rather be at home.” It was also noticeable that most of the patients were reluctant to say that there was
anything wrong with their mental facilities—most of them gave organic causes for their hospitalization—“I cut my arm from here to
here” (indicating an area on his arm), or “I have diabetes.” There was one gentleman who was there “to protect
his property.”

**A SPORTSMAN'S PRAYER FOR 1956**

Dear God,

Help me to be a sport in this little game of life. I don’t ask for any easy place in
the line-up; play me anywhere you need me. I only ask for the stuff to give you 100% of what
I've got. If all the hard drives seem to come my way I thank you for the compliment. Help me
to remember that You won't let anything come my way that You and I together can’t handle. And help me
to take the bad breaks as part of the game. Help me to understand that the game is full of
knots and trouble, and make me thankful for them. Help me to get so that the harder they come the
better I like it.

And, O God, help me always to play on the square. No matter what the other players do, help me
to come clean. Help me to study the Book so that I'll know the rules, and to study and think
a lot about the greatest Player that ever lived, and the other great players that we are told about in
the Book. If they found out that the best part of the game was helping the other guys who were
out of luck, help me to find it out too. Help me to be a regular fellow with the other
players.

Finally, O God, if fate seems to uppercut me with both hands and I’m laid on the shelf in sickness
or old age or something, help me to take that as part of the game too. Help me not to
whimper or squeal that the game was a frame-up or that I had a raw deal. And when, in the
failing dusk, I get the final bell, I'd like to know that You feel that I've been decent and game
and a helper. Amen.

**Dr. Tom Scott Assumes Duties as Head Coach**

Dr. Tom Scott, Director of Physical Education, assumed the coaching job of the Wildcat basketball team on January 11, after
the resignation of Danny Miller.

Dr. Scott has instigated only a few minor changes in the handling of the team. As the Cat followers have
noticed, the Wildcats are now using the fast break. Scott prefers this system of taking a chance at an easy
basket, and then, if it fails, running a set offense. Spectators have also noticed the new scoreboards which give a
running account of the individual players’ scores and fouls. Dr. Scott set up the boards to heighten interest by keeping
the fans informed as the game progresses.

Dr. Scott has made his presence felt in almost all fields of the athletic department. The first of his new
steps was the revised athletic ability test given at the start of the semester. The test takes into account muscular
feats, such as punting the football and throwing the softball, more common than those formerly tested. The rule permitting juniors
and seniors, who can pass the athletic test, to be excused from P.T. was instigated by Dr. Scott. However, he
would like to encourage those students to participate frequently in some sport of their choosing. To encourage this voluntary participation,
the gym is being left open as much as possible. On recent afternoons the floor has been filled with students
playing basketball. Dr. Scott has a great fondness for basketball. He twice made Kansas All-State, playing on three unbeaten teams
at Pittsburg State Teachers College from where he received his AB degree in 1930. He obtained his MA in physical
education seven years later at the University of Iowa. He became physical education director for city schools in Morehead, Minn.,
coaching high school sports at Moundridge and Halstead in Kansas. While living in the latter town, he played with a
Wichita semi-pro team that won the national AAU championship. He was appointed director of physical education and basketball coach at
Concordia College at Morehead in 1936 and then took the same positions with Central Missouri College in 1938. During the
following five years at Central Missouri his teams won four conference championships. Dr. Scott spent the war years in the
Navy, and one year after his release in 1945 he accepted a coaching position at the University of North Carolina
where his team compiled a 99-63 record. He resigned in 1952 to become the head coach of the Phillips 66
Oilers. He was with the sales department of that company. Dr. Scott received his doctorate of education at Columbia University
last June and moved to Chapel Hill. He came from there to Davidson when he was appointed to succeed Paul
Scott, who is now associated with Cornell College.

**NOTICE!**

On Friday afternoon, January 27, Davidson College will begin its annual “spring?” practice. Since this is the first day after
finals, equipment will not begin to be issued until that afternoon. As usual, this is the all-important period of training
that determines to a great extent the results of the next fall's activity. Coach Dole particularly wishes to emphasize the
fact that this practice is open to all and urges men who have not as yet participated to work with
the squad. At this early date, all positions are open for next year. From Saturday of last week until yesterday,
Coach Dole and Dr. Frontis Johnson have been in California as Davidson's Southern Conference representatives at the annual NCAA meeting.
All the policy of this inclusive body is formulated at this gathering, as is recommended from various committees. Its scope
includes activities from rules and regulation of actual games to the scholarship policies.

**NOTICE!**

All of those men who are planning to participate in baseball this spring are requested to meet in the Blue
Room of the Union on Monday of next week at 7 p.m. Coach Chuck Clements stresses the importance of all
men, both lettermen and non-lettermen, attending this session. Not only does he wish to get a line on who will
be out for the team in the spring and gather some information on prospects, but it is necessary that the
new cut rule be discussed. Since the squad will be on the road for a good many games, cut planning
will have to begin at the outset of the semester. In view of coming exams, it will be a short
meeting. All persons with baseball experience are urged to give it a whirl this year. Spring, which is not far
off, will find the Cats with very good prospects for a fine season to follow up last year’s sterling performance.

**Kappa Sigs Lead IFC**

With the first semester rapidly drawing to a close and one-fourth of the interfraternity competition completed, last year’s winner, the
Kappa Sigs, are off to a fast start towards retaining the coveted interfraternity sports trophy. At present the Kappa Sigs
command a forty-five-point lead over second place and third place Sigma Chis. Flickerball, or touch football, whatever one may choose
to call it, opened this year’s action and gave the Sigma Chis an opportunity to take an early lead by
completing a perfect season. Not until the last game between the Kappa Sigs and Sigma Chis was the flickerball championship
decided. This win not only gave the Sigs the flickerball championship here but enabled them to join the Sig chapters
at Duke, Wake Forest, Carolina, and State as flickerball champions of their respective campuses. This lead was short-lived for as
soon as the results of the swimming meet were posted, the Kappa Sigs had moved out into the lead due
to their superior performance.

**HOBBY COBB WILDCAT OF WEEK**

Hobby Cobb, captain of the Wildcat basketball team, has been chosen athletic honor man of the week. Hobby is probably
the brightest star ever to shine on the Davidson cage scene. He holds almost every individual school basketball record. The
6'3", 180-pound athlete comes from Charlotte, N.C., where he lettered twice in basketball at Central High. He made All-City in
'51 and '52 and was All-Conference in 1952 when he captained his team to the state championship tournament.Also won two

The most interesting question asked of Fred, he believes, was “How do you like French women?” To which Mr. Myers
subtly replied, “One likes English women but the word like is not the proper term to describe any possible relation
to French women.”

Phi Delta Theta placed first in the meet with a fifty-seven point lead. Second place in the meet enabled the
Phi Delts to move into second in the team standings. Bob Wynne and Charlie Stowe, the individual stars for the
Kappa Sigs, took first in the 75-yard individual medley and the 50-yard breaststroke respectively. Also, their relay team took the
150 medley relay. Chuck Blake took first for the Pi Kapps in the 75-yard freestyle and two Phi Delts, Dave
Wood and Don Stewart, took the 50-yard freestyle and the 50-yard backstroke. The SAEs finished strong with Steve Norton taking
first in the 25-yard freestyle and their relay team captured the 200-yard freestyle relay.

Wrestling was the third sport of the year and the one which seemed to draw the most spectator interest. Here
again the Kappa Sigs fielded a team which, when final results were posted, had given them another championship. In the
123 lb. class, Kappa Sig's Pete Coleman breezed through competition and appears to be one of the better wrestling prospects.
Phi Delt’s Woody Burns and Everest “Moto” Price took victories in the 130 lb. class and 137 lb. class respectively.
Beta's Mel Armstrong possessed too much wrestling knowledge and pinned Sigma Chi's John Patterson for first place in the 147
lb. class. What proved to be one of the more evenly matched events of the night, and from the excitement
displayed by the crowd, the most crowd-pleasing, was between Kappa Sig’s Jim Gaither and Beta’s Jimmy Martin, with Gaither outlasting
Martin for the decision. In what appeared to be the roughest match, Sigma Chi’s Westy Westervelt pinned Phi Delt’s Charlie
Morris. Dick Jones took first in the 191 lb. class and L. G. Wilson pinned Beta's Gaylord Walker to give
the Phi Gams wins in these last two events.

College Students Oppose Guaranteed Yearly Wage

Minneapolis (ACP)—Not too many months ago the directors of several large auto manufacturing concerns were locked in a struggle with
employee representatives concerning a new labor contract. The largest bone of contention was that of a “guaranteed annual wage.”

While this fight between management and employees was going on, the Associated Collegiate Press asked a representative cross-section of college
students how they felt about the major issue, that of a “guaranteed annual wage”:

Are you in favor of labor contracts that call for a “guaranteed annual wage?”
The results:
Men Women Total
Yes 33% 27% 30%
No 47% 34% 41%
Undecided 20% 39% 29%

The figures indicate that college opinion on this question cannot be considered as set, since slightly over one-third of the
students do not even feel they can express an opinion. About all one can say is that there’s a tendency
for college students to disfavor a “guaranteed annual wage.”

A surprising number of students who disapproved of the guaranteed wage were confused on the issue. In response to the
question of “WHY” they had made a particular choice, many seemed to think the government was directly involved in the
issue. Such as the Purdue University (Lafayette, Ind.) freshman who said, “I don’t want socialized government and that's what we
seem to be getting more of every day.” This was not at all an uncommon type of response.

Many of those students disapproving of the guaranteed wage feel that it will sap the worker of his initiative, such
as the freshman from Southeast Missouri State College (Cape Girardeau, Mo.) who states that “I think people should work for
the money they get, and if they have a guaranteed wage they will just lie around.” But a Regis College
(Weston, Mass.) junior is opposed because she feels that it will be possible for the workers to make more money
if not under a guaranteed wage system. A Southern Methodist University (Dallas, Texas) junior thinks the employer should not be
forced to support the workers “when situations arise over which he (employer) has no control.” One of his classmates thinks
“it is a bad precedent to set because many small outfits will not be able to meet such demands.”

The vast majority of students favoring a “guaranteed annual wage” list worker security as their reason. They feel it will
give the worker a stronger economic base, allowing him to plan ahead and live without fear of the future. A
Colorado A. & M. (Ft. Collins, Colo.) freshman says the guaranteed annual wage “will reduce the number of strikes and
the resulting waste of time and manpower,” while a Hunter College (New York City) senior coed feels it “will help
stabilize our economy and prevent a depression.”

Columbus, Ohio — (ACP) — A group of nurses at the University of Pennsylvania Nursing school recently wrote an essay
entitled “What Is a College Boy?” and it was reprinted in the Ohio State Lantern. Here are a few selections:

A college boy is laziness with peach-fuzz on its face, idiocy with lanolin on its hair, and the “Hope of
the Future” with an overdrawn bank book in its pocket.

A college boy is a composite ... he has the energy of a Rip Van Winkle, the shyness of a
Mr. Micawber, the practicality of a Don Quixote, the kindness of a Marquis de Sade, the imagination of Bill Sykes,
the aspirations of a Casanova and when he wants something it is usually money. He likes good liquor, bad liquor,
Playtex ads and girls on football weekends. He is not much for hopeful mothers, irate fathers, sharp-eyed ushers, campus guards,
alarm clocks or letters from the dean.

A college boy is a magical creature ... you can lock him out of your heart; but not out of
your bank account. You can get him off your mind, but you can’t get him off your expense account. He
is a no-account, girl-chasing bundle of worry. But when you come home at night with only the shattered pieces of
hope and dreams, he can make them seem mightily insignificant with four magic words: “I flunked out, Dad!”
