For all those who think a “good job” means
90-hour work weeks and pin-stripe suits...

Consider Something Different...

...McMaster-Carr. Our company follows a non-traditional approach to developing management talent. Through assignments in areas such as marketing, purchasing, finance, systems, catalog development, or distribution, you will learn about our business from the inside out. As your knowledge and responsibilities increase, you will be involved in managing our people and our operations. At McMaster-Carr, advancement is directed not by your undergraduate major or tenure, but rather by your ability to challenge and improve our business practices.

For over 100 years, we have supplied industries worldwide with the products needed to maintain, repair, and operate everything from movie sets to manufacturing facilities. We publish a 3500-page catalog and carry over 400,000 different items on our shelves ready for immediate shipment.

We are looking for bright, creative individuals from diverse educational backgrounds to join our management team. We will be interviewing for opportunities available in our Atlanta location.

Please submit your resume via eCareers by Friday, January 30.

Your Dream: “I want to become a doctor.”

Reality: “I don’t have the required courses for medical school.”

The Johns Hopkins Post-Baccalaureate Premedical Program prepares college graduates with strong academic records to apply to the best medical schools by giving them the personal attention, the necessary science and math courses, and one-to-one academic advising.

If you or someone you know wants to pursue a career as a doctor, apply by March 1.
