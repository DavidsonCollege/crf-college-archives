**Baseball suffers heartbreaking losses**

**Junior Steve Condon hurls one in the zone**

By BOYD COGGINS

Davidson ended its Southern Conference baseball season last weekend as the Cats lost two heartbreakers in the Southern Conference tournament
playoffs.

In their first game, Davidson lost 5-4 when Appalachian State scored a run in the bottom of the ninth inning
to pull out the victory. In their next game against East Tennessee State, the Cats let a lead get away
from them as the Buccaneers scored four runs in the bottom of the eighth inning to take a 7-5 victory.

The Cats' record now stands at 21-15-1 with five games yet to be played. Davidson finishes their season with a
game at the University of Georgia and four games with UNCC.

In a warm-up game to the tournament last week, the Cats lost to the Pfeiffer Falcons for the second time
this season by the score of 8-5. The Cats could manage only seven hits off Falcon pitchers Steve Meadows and
John Ford. Pfeiffer jumped off to an early lead in the first inning when they scored their first runs on
three hits and four walks.

The Cats scored their first run in the third inning when sophomore Bill Masse, who had reached first base on
a fielder's choice and moved to third on a stolen base and a wild pitch, scored on a ground out
by senior Keith Helfant.

After the Falcons scored another run in the top of the fourth to increase their lead to 6-1, junior Ollie
Wagner picked the Cats up in the bottom of the inning when he hit a clutch two-out single to right-centerfield
which scored both senior Scott Weaver and sophomore Rob Zimmerman.

However, Davidson was never able to come any closer to the Falcons, who scored two more insurance runs in the
eighth inning to take an 8-3 lead. The Cats' final two runs came in the ninth when junior David Turgeon
blasted his ninth homer of the season. The leading hitters in this game were Wagner, who had two singles and
two RBIs, and Turgeon, who had a home run and two RBIs.

On Friday afternoon, the Cats traveled to Cullowhee for the conference tournament, where they met Appalachian State. The Cats hoped
to open up with a victory since they had their ace pitcher, junior Steve Condon, on the mound looking for
his tenth victory of the season. As expected, Condon turned in another masterful performance as he struck out nine men
and walked only four. But it was not enough as Appalachian State squeaked out a 5-4 victory.

The game was scoreless until the Mountaineers got a run in the bottom of the fourth on a solo home
run by Kent Alexander. The Mountaineers upped their lead to 4-0 in the sixth when Tony Green hit a solo
homer and Rusty Stroup hit a two-run shot.

Davidson, who had been held scoreless for seven innings by Appalachian State ace Ricky Stratton, exploded in the eighth inning
for four runs on four hits. Turgeon started the rally with a single. Weaver followed with a walk to put
runners on first and second base. Junior Dan Simonds then hit a long double to left field which scored both
runners. Junior Mark Thompson knocked in the final two runs of the inning when he hit his fourth home run
of the season to tie the score at four. Appalachian State scored the winning run in the ninth inning when
Alexander, who had singled, scored on a double by Don Chandler giving the Mountaineers a 5-4 victory. Leading hitters in
the game were Simonds and Weaver who each had two hits.

In the game on Saturday, the Cats let a 5-3 lead get away from them as East Tennessee State scored
four runs in the bottom of the eighth inning to take the victory.

Davidson jumped out to an early lead when Masse, who had walked, scored on a fielder’s choice by Turgeon. In
the second inning, the Cats increased their lead to 3-0 when junior Dave Depaul hit a two-run homer to right,
which scored senior Tim Waters.

The Buccaneers came back in the bottom of the second inning when they scored three unearned runs on two hits
and three Davidson errors.

The Cats again took the lead in the sixth inning when sophomore Alan Lewis scored on an error by the
left fielder. The Cats made it 5-3 in the seventh when sophomore Roy Vilardi doubled and scored on a hit
by Helfant. But East Tennessee won the game in the eighth when they scored four runs—after men had reached base
on a walk, a single, and an error—on a sacrifice fly and two doubles.

For the second year in a row, Davidson fell just short of claiming the Southern Conference Championship and a trip
to the NCAA tournament. Western Carolina won the tournament on Sunday when they defeated Appalachian State. The Cats played hard
but they could not get the breaks when they needed them. They hope to rebound strongly and finish the season
with victories over Georgia and UNCC so that they can go into next season ready to challenge for the conference
crown once again.
