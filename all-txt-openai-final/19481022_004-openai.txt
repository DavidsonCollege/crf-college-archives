PAGE FOUR LETTER TO EDITOR (Continued from Page Two)

It equally exaggerated the facts composing an attack on the Status state of which the first writer was a member.
The Secretary sat back and surveyed his handiwork. His plan was working. What the Secretary did not realize was that
some of the citizens would and did misconstrue the purpose for which the controversy was begun. There were angry, puzzled,
bitter ones in every state, though there were many, also, who accepted the argument for what it was, an interest-arouser.
And the Secretary sat back as if unaware of the results of his program.

"Let it be said that the original idea was a sound one: nothing stirs up interest so much as a
heated controversy. Nevertheless, there remained numerous issues which might have been torn apart without the Secretary having to turn to
his own governmental group for a subject. So the situation stood, with bewilderment foremost in the minds of many of
every class. What happened next? ... (Here the document ends.)

As one can arrive at solutions of a problem by varying the knowns, so could several solutions or actions be
substituted for the unknown course. Possibly the best thing to be done, and still derive the stimulus of the letters,
would be to make clear to those who are misunderstanding, the idea that the Secretary of the Department of Information
originally had. Then the Status, Neo-Status, and all the other citizens of the land could join in without fear of
stirring up civil strife. On the other hand, vehement, angry letters continued, until either the Central Government forced the Department
to dispense with the growing unrest or the ignorance made it necessary to perform the same task. It is doubtful
that the last two alternatives are very probable, however, when the situation could be so easily explained.

If the "citizens" of Davidson can take these type letters in their stride and not take them too literally and
specifically, The Davidsonian ought to be one of the liveliest, most talked-of papers this school has ever read. But if
they can't take them without getting all riled up, the letters should be stopped.

Sincerely,
Bill Clapp

Editor's Note: We appreciate the ingenuity attributed to the "Secretary of the Department of Information." The Davidsonian would like to
present differing student viewpoints on matters of interest to our readers. However, the general uniformity of thought existing amongst us
makes it difficult for the differing individual to come out straightforwardly for his point of view. He tends to hedge
around and veil his views in veiled forms. We would like nothing better than to print clear-cut student views on
any question, however heretical they may seem, but we cannot accept the responsibility of "fathering" the status.

I believe this would be the most appropriate spot. Brothers Hammer, Faw, McArn, and Pledges Ed Richardson and Eric Clark
were also present. At a recent meeting of the fraternity Bo Roddey was elected social chairman. It must be pointed

AMONG THE GREEKS
(Continued from Page Two)

I believe this would be the most appropriate spot. Brothers Hammer, Faw, McArn, and Pledges Ed Richardson and Eric Clark
were also present. At a recent meeting of the fraternity Bo Roddey was elected social chairman.Pastor to the Rapidan, Va.,
Presbyterian Church. Soon after completing his work at Union, he was called to the First Church in Yadkinville, N. C.,
where he served until he accepted his present office at Davidson.

Mrs. Smith was formerly Miss Helen Hayes of Ellwood City, Pennsylvania. Before she was married to our “Y” secretary, Mrs.
Smith attended Geneva College and the University of Colorado. She also did graduate work at Assembly's Training School in Richmond
where she received her master’s degree. The Smith family, father, mother, and daughter, according to the “Y” secretary, are very
grateful for and very happy here and the kindnesses shown by the students particularly. Bill Smith wants you to know
and you couldn't find a better fellow to get acquainted with. Let's help him to make this the best year
for the “Y” and for Davidson.

Davidson played a much better game than the 14-6 score would indicate. Cliff Turner, who turned in his best performance
to date, made another score which was nullified by a fifteen-yard penalty against the Cats. In addition to Turner’s outstanding
play, Jim Sifford was in the spotlight by virtue of his passing. Heretofore, Sifford had been used on running plays
for the most part, but when Lambeth was forced to leave the game because of an injury, Sifford took over
the chores; and passing pitches played an important part in the victory. The game, which was played in the new
Johnson Hagood stadium, was witnessed by approximately 10,000 fans, the largest crowd ever to witness a football game in Charleston.

“You should be more careful to pull your shade at night. I saw you last night kiss your wife.” “Ha,
ha, I wasn't home last night.” “Ha, ha, the joke is on you; both are going to be really dead
and maybe broken too. A man's chest can just stand so much.”

Festivities to be... (Continued From Page One)
Although the dances form a major part of the Homecoming program, other attractions will be available which the visiting alumni,
and the students, will enjoy: a concert Friday night by Gladys Swarthout, the laying of the cornerstone of the new
gymnasium Saturday morning, and the Davidson-Richmond football game Saturday afternoon. Contrary to the belief of many, the Homecoming dances are
not for the benefit of the alumni and fraternity men alone. They are for the entire student body—independents as well
as fraternity men. And their success depends on every student's support. Homecoming has always been a big event—it will be
even bigger this year.

Dr. Emmons Presents... (Continued From Page One)
The pilot to land his plane safely in the thick fog was a perfect analogy in Dr. Emmons’ eyes of
how Christ can lead man through the thick and dangerous fog of life, if man merely trusts in Him and
follows His commands. Upon leaving the island, which is continuously covered by fog and clouds, Dr. Emmons noted that in
a matter of minutes the plane had left the non-transparent fog and clouds, and was rising in the midst of
a beautiful, sunny morning. To Dr. Emmons, this was symbolic in that man could free himself from the fog and
clouds of life if he would merely rise high enough. Majestic Mt. Fujiyama in Japan was the object of the
fourth and final symbolism. This extinct volcano, once the symbol of fear and destruction to the Japanese, now represents national
pride, security, and unity to the Japanese people. That which was bad God made good. Dr. Emmons pointed out that
this could be readily applied to the world situation today, especially concerning the fears nations have of one another.

Dr. Emmons will next journey to Charlotte where he will participate in the first of thirty-six interdenominational presentations throughout the
country of the Church's work in the missionary field.

Zanies Strip (Continued From Page One)
Charlotte and vicinity. The spring of 1948 brought many new developments, including their performance at the D Club Follies, for
which they wrote the introductory song and the finale. The most important thing that happened, however, was their election to
the position of head cheerleaders by the student body. This year they have been so busy much time for anything
else, but as soon as the football season is over, we can rest assured that the great team of Scruggs
and Upchurch will do their part in making life at Davidson even more fun.
