Red Hot Chili Peppers: Blood Sugar Sex Magik

By Josh Larned

With the release of Blood Sugar Sex Magik, the Red Hot Chili Peppers have proven themselves lords of the alternative
funk/metal scene. Produced by mastermind Rick Rubin (of Public Enemy fame) and recorded in a dilapidated L.A. mansion, the album
is an anthology of intense songs and rhythmic beats that will keep the listener grooving to the end.

Flea continues to pluck the bass with precision, while drummer Chad Smith and guitarist John Frusciante bring together the band
with their talented play. Capped off with Anthony Kiedis’ explosive voice, this album is hard to beat.

The record abruptly begins with “The Power of Equality,” which remains loyal to the band’s earlier efforts, yet addresses the
important topic of racism. “Give it away” is a classic Pepper ditty which jams on every note and climaxes to
a state of pure funkadelica (if such a noun exists).

The group even explores new territory by throwing in a few ballads which put to shame the nauseating “Poison-like” jingles
we are subjected to on top 40 radio. For example, “Breaking The Girl” proves Kiedis’ vocal talent and may well
be the big hit of the album.

In fact, I don’t mean to sound trite, but this record could be the one that catapults the band into
the mainstream listeners’ ear. And with seventeen songs on one LP by a forever cool group of musicians, who could
refuse to tune in?
