_Pilgrimâ€™s Progress_

I.

It was in the mad, mad Grocery Store
that I was first confident of my salvation.
SAVE! SAVE! SAVE! and COUPONS
REDEEMED HERE! This was the good
news and just exactly what I was
hoping for. I had been hoping for
so long.

The gentle squeak of the cart caressed
my ears and my whitened fingers
pressed the perfect plastic and steel
and drew great comfort from that
which was real and tangible to
the senses. Suddenly I realized
what the cryogenic plot was as
the crippled fluorescence flickered
my soul into slow motion numbness,
and the cruel coldness of the icy
linoleum stole through the bare
soles of my feet and crept slowly
through my bones, bones, bones, bones.
But through some miracle perhaps
I forced myself inward through
the fabric of space and time past
the black holeness of shopping eyes
and was literally frozen in the produce
dept. when opposing mirrors informed
me that my fate was being replayed
at millions of other supermarkets across
the universe. However, I struggled on
and had remaining savvy to see
through the schizophrenic mirrors over the bloody
meat, to see through to the butchers
with white suits and chainsaws
and the innocent sacred cows
with large brown stupid eyes
like mine.

II.

Which gleamed with
the flashing lights and excitement,
thrill of victory/agony of defeat, good
clean fun, healthy competition, brutal
murder, and utter objectivity of
the video game. I paused and
reached for another easy quarter,
uncaring as the sacramental
potato chip crumbs clung greasily
to my calm fingers and it came
to me that I was in my car and
was safely home, home, home at last.
The quarter slipped easily back into my
pocket as I slipped easily through the door
and switched on.

III.

The hole in my wall through which
each and every evening perpetually poured
unending raw sewage and enlightenment
as the prophet-newsmen with green faces
and pleasant voices laid it on the line
confidentially just between you and me.
But tonight was different and tonight was special
and tonight I had the faith to wait
and the strength to hope in the midst
of the hell I had emptied and
the tears rolled down my face
like amber waves of grain.

And I went to the purple majestic mountaintop.
I know because the emptiness flashed full upon
me and burned like lasers
into the back of my smoking skull forever
and forever and the perfect bell rang in my
mind perfectly loud and long and I
watched and I.

IV.

Prayed almost till dawn.
