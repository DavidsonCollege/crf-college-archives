time after time converted steals into open layups.

His team’s insistence on dribbling through the press frustrated Filar.
“What was crazy was we broke it without any trouble at times,” he said.
“When we tried to dribble through it we got into trouble. We let them take
us out of our game mentally and physically.”

Butcher led Davidson with 14 points and nine rebounds, but shot 0-
10 from the field in the second half. Burke came off the bench to score
12.
Saturday in Lynchburg, Va., the Wildcats captured a 67-49 win over
Lynchburg, powered once again by Butcher, who scored 22 points and
had 23 rebounds. Cara Crosswhite added 12. Davidson (7-9) faced
Washington and Lee Sunday in Lexington, Va. The ‘Cats return home
to meet Liberty Wednesday and Wofford Saturday. Both games begin at
7:30 p.m.

seen growth from the crowd from The Citadel to here. When Davidson
crowds get going here, it’s pretty impressive,” he said.

Though Davidson has stepped into
and out of the Southern Confer-
ence over the past decade, its
women’s athletics program has
continued to grow and develop. In
1982-83, Davidson had only four
varsity women’s sports. Ten years
later, we have more than doubled
that number. Ten years ago, bas-
ketball, tennis, field hockey, and

swimming and diving were
Davidson’s only varsity women’s
sports; since then, the athletic de-
partment has added cross-country
(1985), volleyball (1986), indoor
track and field (1987), outdoor
track and field (1988), soccer
(1990), swimming and diving
(1991), and finally, this year’s new
addition, lacrosse. (Women’s bas-
ketball was disbanded in 1986 and
brought back to varsity status this
year. Swimming and diving un-
derwent a similar transition after
they were disbanded in 1982 and
reinstated in 1991.)

We hope that you will help us
honor and recognize the female
student-athletes of Davidson Col-
lege, past and present, by attend-
ing the many events and competi-
tions they have scheduled, and by
noticing the showcase in the Baker
Sports Complex lobby, which is
dedicated to outstanding female
student-athletes of the past decade.
Your continued support of
women’s athletics is crucial to its
ability to continue to grow.
