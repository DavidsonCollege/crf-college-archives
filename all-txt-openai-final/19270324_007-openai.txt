P. Finley Henderson is Made President of Bar
Davidson Graduate Elected Head of South Carolina Lawyers

The South Carolina Bar Association had its recent meeting in Columbia, S. C., electing as its president Mr. P. Finley Henderson, of Aiken, S. C. Mr. Henderson was educated at Davidson College, from which he graduated in 1897. Immediately upon his graduation, Mr. Henderson entered upon the profession of law in partnership with his father, Col. D. S. Henderson, who was also a lawyer. The name of the firm was then changed from Henderson Bros. to Henderson & Henderson.

The best proof of his legal ability is proven by his unmatched success. He has always been at the top of his profession and richly deserves the honor of his newly attained position. Mr. Henderson, while at Davidson, devoted most of his time to the study of law, but not to that alone, as he signified by the fact that he is the proud wearer of the Phi Beta Kappa Key.

He has found time, however, to take an active interest in other affairs. He is a former grand chancellor of Knights of Pythias, of South Carolina; former president of the Aiken Chamber of Commerce; former vice-president of the Aiken Kiwanis Club; is an elder in the Presbyterian Church and moderator of the Congaree Presbytery, Synod of South Carolina. He has served as special judge, and, higher still, as acting associate Justice of the Supreme Court. He is married, his wife being, before marriage, Miss Grace Powell, and has two daughters, Misses Adelaide and Eleanor Henderson, both of whom are students of Sweet Briar.

Davidson Professor to Write for Publication
Dr. Richards Will Contribute to Presbyterian Standard

Dr. Charles M. Richards, professor of Bible at Davidson College, will write a series of articles for the Presbyterian Standard, a prominent religious publication of the Presbyterian Church. The articles are to begin in the near future and will continue over a period of several months.

An editorial in the Charlotte Observer has the following comment: "The Standard knew that he is so well known that words of commendation are unnecessary. However, the Standard runs the risk of saying what everybody knows about him and thinks aloud our own self-congratulatory feelings. Dr. Richards’ thirty years in the pastorate, eighteen years in a college church, five or more years in teaching the Bible to college men, combined with his well-known skill as preacher and expounder of the Scriptures, his conservative disposition and his reputation for the highest ideals both for himself and for others, fit him for this task, and we congratulate our readers on the prospect for the next six months."

At the end of the term last year, Dr. Richards retired from the local pulpit in order to devote full time to his Bible classes in the college.

In his legal career of 29 years, Mr. Henderson has been counsel in well-known cases and in addition has carried on a large office practice. His election as head of the State Bar Association demonstrates the high regard the members of his own profession have for him.

Personal
Mr. Kelly G. Tucker, '23, is now with the American College of Teheran, at Teheran, Persia, while information has also been received that E. E. Houghton, '22, is with the American School for Boys, at Hamadan, Persia. The latter is making a trip around the world, and it is believed that he is spending part of his time in Persia teaching school.

An effort is being made by the alumni secretary to ascertain the oldest living alumni, insofar as the time of his graduation is concerned. So far, the oldest one found is Mr. T. H. Davis, of the class of 1864. He is a grandfather of Mr. Walter Davis, a student at Davidson this year. Any information about an older living Davidson alumnus would be appreciated.

Mr. W. R. Kretschmar, '24, is a student at Tulane this year, his address being 1461 Webster Street, New Orleans, La. He is studying medicine.

Many students have recently noted sports articles on the big leagues by Mr. Brian Bell. He is an alumnus of Davidson, being in the class of 1910, and is connected with the Associated Press at the present time, giving detailed accounts of the spring workouts. He is in Florida visiting many of the training grounds.

Mr. Albert Lyons, Jr., '26, is in Greenville, Tenn., 216 Church Street. He writes that he is planning to return for the first commencement of his class in June. Indirect information has also been received that G. R. Shaddock is coming back from Mississippi, and it is expected that S. S. Lawson, also of that class, will be here from Alabama. It is expected that this class will have one of the largest re...(unions for any group returning after its first year, many members being scattered over North Carolina, with accessibility to Davidson easy. Mr. W. B. McGukin, president of the class of 1922, is now at Dillon, S.C. Mr. C. A. Young, '24, known as “Crown Prince” while he was a student at Davidson, is now at 257 Kingsland Terrace, New York. Mr. John W. McAlister, the Greensboro Alumni '19, president of Davidson College, sent out a letter last week to the constituents of that organization, urging their support of the Davidson College Loyalty League. Mr. McAlister has proved one of the most active workers among the association presidents, having sent several letters to his members. Although the Statesville Alumni Association is leading all organizations with 50 percent of its members subscribing to the Loyalty League, it is not satisfied with that and has written for a complete list in order that they might make an effort to raise their percentage. Individual support of this movement has been evident this year, the latest request coming from J. A. Cannon, Concord, N. C., for a list of the class of 1904, in order that he might write them. Others who have been known to write members of their class are Rev. J. A. Ward, '99, Bainbridge, Ga., and Prof. J. H. Davis, Jr., '24, of Davidson.

DEBATING TEAM TO OPEN SEASON
(Continued from page 1)

Emory University, of Atlanta, Ga., will debate L. K. Pritchett and Henry Powell, the Davidson team upholding the negative side of the question, Resolved, That the United States should adopt a uniform marriage and divorce law. Wallace M. Alston and Glenn M. Elliott, a Junior and Senior at the University, will be represented here on the 30th of March. Mr. Alston, although being connected with forensic work for some time, will appear on his second varsity debate. He won the champion declaimer distinction for 1924-25 and is a participant in the oratorical contest for 1926-27. Mr. Elliott is debating his third year for the University, having debated quite a few colleges, some of which are: Oxford University, England; Universities of Alabama and Tennessee; Georgia School of Technology; Mercer, and Wesleyan College. The Emory team debated on last Saturday, the Wesleyan College debaters. It is the first time in the South that a men’s team has opposed that from a women’s college. The Davidson men on this debate are W. K. Pritchett and R. C. Grady, who will uphold the negative side of the question, Resolved, That the Volstead Act should be repealed.

Appeals to Alumni Receive Responses

Last week a statistical report was sent to 3,100 alumni on the Davidson College Loyalty League, giving it according to the number of contributors and the amount each class contributed. At the same time, a letter was written to the alumni by Dr. J. C. Rowan, president, who made a final appeal to the alumni to support the new work, and at the same time stating that all funds hereafter will be devoted to the expenses of the alumni secretary, due to the deficit which will be apparent when the year’s work has been concluded. The secretary reported Monday night that a number of responses had been made, some of them new, while some of the alumni who had previously contributed sent in additional amounts. How long this will continue is a question. According to the report, the class of 1910 has had more contributors than any other. The 1918 group was second with 12, while three classes were tied for third place with 11 contributors each, those being 1907, 1909, and 1913. The report follows:
