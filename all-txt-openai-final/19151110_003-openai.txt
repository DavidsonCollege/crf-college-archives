SCRUBS ROMP ON “KEYDETS.”

On Friday, November 5, the Red and
Black second string met and defeated
the Horner eleven in a hard contested
game on the Horner gridiron, the score
being 19 to 0.

The game started with Davidson re-
ceiving, and after a bit of see-sawing,
the pigskin was pushed over for a touch-
down, Crouch carrying it over the line.

Again in the second quarter another
six points were added, although the
cadets contested every foot of ground
with the hardest sort of fighting.

The hardest part of the struggle came
in the second half. Coach Ransom was
now in the game, and the Horner eleven
were confident of scoring, but after their
coach had been thrown for a 15-yard loss
on a would-be end run, they went back to
the defense, and should be thankful for
the heavy penalties that were inflicted
on the Scrubs in the fourth quarter, be-
cause if it had not been for these, about
three more touchdowns would have been
counted by Davidson.

Captain Hill and Crouch were the
stars for the Scrubs, while the work of
Weston, Hines and Woolcott was the
best for the Cadets. Line-up:
Davidson Position Horner
Miller Center Wilson
Paisley Right Guard Nance
Adams Left Guard Cherry
Finley Right Tackle Ballard
Shaw Left Tackle Grey
King Right End Carter
McAllister Left End Alexander
Quarterback Woolcott, Ransom
Hill (Capt.) Right Halfback Hines
