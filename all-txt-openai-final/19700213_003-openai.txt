**Basketball, Booze Surpass ‘Goodbye, Columbus’ Joys**

**A REVIEW By DON HOYT**

It is a terrible thing to be killed off one week and condemned the next, only to find out the third week that one is still expected to produce the requisite 25 column inches of criticism. It seems that critics are doomed to forever suffer at the hands of an ungrateful and unappreciative public. And you? Chances are you're proud, able-bodied young men with the hands of an author and the wise who knows his readers are profane, lusty, food-smattering, with a bit of narcissism of youth thrown in. You're interested predominantly in two things: youth and sex.

A little more than two years ago, a movie appeared which took you by storm: "The Graduate," a brilliantly put-together study of youth and sex. It had all the essentials: an affair, skin, hit tunes playing in the background, a lovely heroine in the person of Katherine Ross, and an average hero—the guy faced with the problem of finding his place in the world, and a collegiate atmosphere. Since the phenomenal success of "The Graduate," several films using the same basic formula have been made to lure you away from your books, booze, and basketball games. Indeed, we should all be thankful that "Easy Rider" has come along so Hollywood won't continue giving us films about college students with problems—certainly an unhealthy diet for Davidson gentlemen.

"Goodbye, Columbus" has been one of the more successful post-Graduate productions. Yet there has to be something wrong with any movie that begins with a photograph of a navel magnified 300 times. Perhaps it is a reminder of the metaphysical umbilical cord linking it to all the other movies Hollywood has produced. "Goodbye, Columbus" has very little to recommend it; it doesn't compare with basketball, booze, or reading, and you might even find a reading of Philip Roth's original story more enjoyable. Besides, with any of these activities, you avoid the back-breaking chairs in the Morrison Room and the risk that the projectionist will be an incompetent Union Film Committee man who will give you two shows for the price of one. The second show is always a mystery-thriller: will he show the reels in their correct order? Will he adjust the sound so we can hear the dialogue? Will he put the film in right side up?

Of course, you'll miss the fun of audience participation. Whistle. Stomp. Scream at the projectionist. Groan in sympathy with the protagonist’s frustrated sex life. Murmur in appreciation as the beautiful starlet disrobes. If you like gross sequences, though, by all means go to "Goodbye, Columbus" for there is one classic juxtaposition in the middle of the film that is guaranteed to make you howl. Immediately after Neil and Brenda begin making love in the attic, the scene changes to the dining room and a close, close, close-up of a red, rare, runny roast beef.

Someone has said that "Goodbye, Columbus" is just a Jewish "Graduate." However, most Americans don't know much about Jewish culture in the provincial Northeast, and a lot of the film is wasted on them. Do you know the difference between Westchester and the Bronx? No? Then you won't be able to fully appreciate the film. For instance, you won't really be appalled by the ghastly lives of the rich Jewish nouveau riche in the Potemkins. And, sadly enough, the garishness is only half the story. The other part of "Goodbye, Columbus" is the hard work, struggle, and realistic approach to life that is the Jewish life shown only for success.

There are lots of sex jokes in the movie, but there's not a great deal of what C. Shaw would call "good entertainment." If you prefer the former to the latter, though, you can hear Brenda tell a bitchy friend how she's been spending her summer; you can see a priggish librarian put down for his over-concern with the uses to which art books are put; you can watch Ron Potemkin wash his jockstrap in the bathroom sink. If sex is pretty bad, even when it doesn't involve good sex, then movies which revolve around sex tend to be bad even when they're pretty good. Only an exceptional production like Ted and Alice can avoid the pitfall of pandering, and "Goodbye, Columbus" isn't good.

With the intent of making the college useful to both the college and community, officials are investigating the possibilities of renovating Erwin Lodge, once a student recreational center. The lodge, located back in the woods on campus just off the Cross Country course, was built by Professor Erwin in the early fifties as a memorial after the death of his two sons, both Davidsonians. The building contains stones from the foundation of the original Chambers building, which burned down in 1921. It was built as a recreation area and throughout the first decade of its existence was a major picnic and party spot, according to Dean Richard Burts.

**Emory University Will Realize New 24-Hour Open Dorm Policy**

Reprinted from The Emory Wheel, By LARRY GARNER

Twenty-four-hour open dormitories have been granted to all residences with the exception of Trimble Hall, which has not yet submitted a proposal for open housing. Winship and Longstreet Halls submitted open dorm proposals to Dean Beall and were granted the following day. The Means and Dobbs Hall proposals were both submitted Friday, January 23, and approved Monday, January 26. Tom Jones, governor of Dobbs Hall, expressed some feeling that there was reluctance by the administration to grant 24-hour open dorms.

**Freshmen Offer To Paint House ‘Across Tracks’**

By JEFF ALLENDER Staff Writer

In an attempt to start alleviating the wretched living conditions of the poor in the Davidson community, a group of students is engaged in a clean-up, fix-up, and paint-up project at one of the houses in the town. The house, on West Depot Street, is inhabited by Mrs. Maggie Mason, several other women, and about ten children, and is no larger than three dormitory rooms. The painting idea began when freshman Mike Scott asked Rev. L. E. Ellis, pastor of the United Presbyterian Church in Davidson, if there was some "tangible way in which some students could demonstrate their concern for the "social need" in the community. Rev. Ellis suggested that something could be done for the improvement of the housing and directed him to George White, a worker in the college laundry. White told him of the condition of Mrs. Mason's house, which is owned by...the United Presbyterian Church, which does not have the funds for maintenance, Mike said. When they learned of the need, about 20 students, in an act of comedy, made some arrangements. They acquired paint from Second Cannon, bought the brushes, and went to paint the interior and fix up most of the floor. They arranged to paint over Saturday, clean up the exterior of the house, and the yard around it. The group plans to go back and finish the painting next Saturday, Mike added.

“We were asked to submit a survey on the use of open dorms,” he said. “Possibly, the delay was to cool down the situation,” Dean Beall said. “There was no issue of cooling down anything; we were trying to determine the degree of responsibility in the dorm governments.” The residence halls were required to write additions to their constitutions, which would include the enforcement of penalties against people selling drugs in the dorm and the procedures for avoiding interference with the custodians while entertaining visitors in the room. Beall said the decision to grant open dorms to the residents was the result of administrative confidence in the dorm governments. “The real issue here is not open housing,” he felt. “The greatest problems would involve visitors now allowed at any time in the dormitories.” He also thought the demand for surveys requesting the use of open house was not undercutting the power of the dorm governments. Beall thought the requests for 24-hour open housing earlier in the year were premature, as there was no way of determining the responsibility of the governments. He felt, “The present situation is a step toward true student self-governmental responsibility.”

When Lake Norman came into existence, though, most of the use that President Spencer and Erwin Lodge had been given was directed out to the recreational areas on the lake. The lack of use of the lodge, plus increasing irresponsible use and vandalism, caused the facility to fall into disrepair, Burts mentioned. Several members of the administration, along with Erwin’s daughter, Mrs. William Cumming, wife of the Professor Emeritus of English, have been keeping in touch with Mrs. Dior and will be meeting with her in Chicago sometime later this month. They have expressed interest in restoring the lodge to either its original use or another. “We are greatly interested in what the student response is to suggested plans for the use of Erwin Lodge,” Burts added. “They’re the ones who know if the place would be well-used and more suited to the changed needs of the college and community.”

Some suggested plans, besides that of a recreational lodge, include using it as a place for the Boy Scouts of the area, the YMCA, town programs, or a professor's lodging. Erwin Lodge has already been put to constructive use this year. Over the Midwinter weekend, a group of dependents cleaned up Erwin Memorial Hall and used it for a party.

Ostwalt Says Too Few Have Signed For 8-College Exchange Program

As of Tuesday afternoon, Registrar J. H. Ostwalt had received no applications for the Eight-College Exchange Program. Dr. Ostwalt is the Exchange Program Officer for Davidson College. “I don’t think we’ve received any unless somebody just shoved one in the box,” said Dr. Ostwalt. He added that many students had picked up applications and many others had stopped by his office to ask him questions about the program. Most of them wanted to know about transfer credit or study at the schools in the exchange program. Others wanted to know if they could be in the program for less than a full year on one of the academic exchange programs. Many students also have made use of the catalogues of the participating colleges in the Registrar’s Office to plan their programs at these other colleges.

The participating colleges in the program are Davidson College, Hampden-Sydney College, Hollins College, Mary Baldwin College, Randolph-Macon Woman’s College, Sweet Briar College, and Washington and Lee University. The deadline for applications is Monday. All applications must be accompanied by a registration fee of $15.00. Acceptance letters will be sent out by March 1. Students selected must notify the college by March 10 and pay a non-refundable deposit of $150.

According to an information sheet distributed by the Registrar’s Office, the purpose of the Exchange Program is to “broaden the educational opportunities of the students in these eight colleges,” and to “provide a diverse campus environment” for the students who are sent to other colleges. Eligibility is determined by the home institution, but a student on the Exchange Program is considered a guest at the host institution and must abide by its rules. Ordinarily, students will participate in the exchange for their full junior year, though other possibilities will be considered. Tuition, room, and board payments will be paid to the home institution at its regular rate.

Valparaiso Freshmen Get Pass-Fail Course Proposal
Valparaiso, Ind.—(I.P.)—A complete pass-fail system with individual evaluations for each student and with comprehensive examinations at the end of four years may ultimately be the product of current discontent and experimentation with grading systems at Valparaiso University. To accomplish these beginning steps (based on the findings of the recently released Task Force Report), provide a maximum testing program for pass-fail and evaluations, and allow those who want to take more pass-fail to do so, VU should:

1. Retain the present grading system for all upper-division and elective courses, except in the cases specified below.
2. Implement an all pass-fail system for the lower division courses. All tests and papers should receive written evaluations to clarify the symbol grade given. The whole freshman year, including electives, should be pass-fail.
3. Implement pass-fail in all courses taken during the interim term in a 4-1-4 calendar and in all independent study done during that term.
4. Allow all students who wish to take all their courses pass-fail at this university.
5. Develop a program of gradual change to total pass-fail with evaluations and possible terminal examinations.

Conclusion: If VU is to become a center for modern education, it should develop a program of change, using proposals 2, 3, and 4 as a core of that program. In the final duel, the traditional grading system and the pass-fail system cannot exist profitably side-by-side for an extended period. The proposals presented above will isolate the new system for complete and accurate testing of its admittedly great potential. The problem is to begin to change the present system to a more evaluative one; to remove the stigma grades have on good education; to provide each student with a more accurate account of his progress in college, thereby avoiding self-interpretation problems students are currently having. Certainly, if it is carefully conceived and implemented, such a system would be vastly superior to what we have at present.
