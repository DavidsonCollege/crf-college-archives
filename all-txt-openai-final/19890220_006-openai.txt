**Chivalry isn’t dead yet: Creative dating at Davidson**

By LISA GERRARD

Chivalry isn’t dead at Davidson College despite all the nasty rumors. After all, Davidson students are well-rounded and innovative young
movers and shakers. Think they’d let the “romantic interest priority” slip from its place between their J. Crew monthlies and
a 3.0 GPA? Of course not. The truth is, romance is alive at Davidson—even unusual and exciting—because of all the
fantastically creative minds here.

Picture, for example, two guys who think they have it all together. Cappuccino and German chocolate cake (Pepperidge Farms fresh
out of the freezer, no less)—they reach the grassy point and assemble the table and chairs on a blanket at
the lake campus. The two couples have just returned from a dinner on the town, and the fellas are in
the kitchen, putting their masterful plan into action. Suddenly they realize that they were supposed to have let the cake
thaw for at least an hour before eating it. The microwave is handy, in goes the cake. Five minutes and
a puddle later, the two guys decide they’ll just have coffee. Onward to the lake campus, ladies, and boy are
they impressed. They had no idea their dates could be so ROMANTIC! But the plan falls through. Once amused friends.
In the meantime, he takes girls dancing and sends them roses. “Sometimes a single rose is better than a whole
bouquet,” says one of his friends. “I’d say he understands the eloquent power of subtlety.”

Another student has no safety pins, but she does carry silly putty in her purse. The fellow she had been
dating had slipped the small, red egg in the pocket of her jacket one day after carefully inscribing “T (heart)
U” in the putty. Small surprises keep popping up for her—the same pocket has bulged with M&Ms and apples on
other occasions. She says one of the best surprises was a note on her bike after an unusually long night
of studying in Chambers.

Make them laugh and you’ll win their hearts, say the six women who went to a snazzy Charlotte restaurant for
a semi-formal last month. Their dates excused themselves to go to the restroom shortly after everyone arrived. “What are they
doing?” echoed around the table. When the men returned, their conservative oxford button-downs and ties had disappeared. In their place:
psychedelic rejects from Goodwill. The waiters stared at the clashing ensembles, but they didn’t say anything. Romantic? Mais oui!

**Patricia’s Peeves: Dating at Davidson: What the Tour Guide Forgot to Tell You...**

Well, I’ve been here two years and the dating situation still amazes me. Why are Davidson guys afraid to ask
girls out? I think the trustees made a rule when they decided to accept women. It must state, “Male students
must never ask female students out unless it is Homecoming, Mid-Winters, or Spring Frolics. They should resist even casual get-togethers
if at all possible—this includes movies, concerts, and take-out Chinese dinners.” There also must be an amendment freeing Queenies of
this rule, but that’s another article.

I’m writing this to warn you about the patterns of pevieeon—(when it occurs).

**CASE STUDY:** It is Mid-Winters and wonder of wonders, a Davidson guy asks you to go. You are thrilled because
you’ve found this guy intriguing since the first day you saw him. He has bright eyes, creativity, and a great
sense of humor. What could go wrong? Well, nothing immediately...these things take time.

He asks you out on Sunday night promising to come by as soon as he knows more details. Friday rolls
around and you think, “Gee, I’m supposed to go out with that wonderful guy tonight but he hasn’t even called.
Come to think of it, I haven’t seen him for days. Maybe aliens abducted him to model their clones after—he
is awfully cute. It’s getting so late. I’d go with a clone to Mid-Winters.” You start thinking about heating up
a Lean Cuisine, and he calls, “Can you be ready in an hour?” You drop the frozen lasagna on your
foot, muffle your scream and reply, “Sure, no problem.”

You have longer than an hour because he’s late. You don’t know if this is good because you had time
to get your pantyhose on straight, or if it’s bad because it’s the second time that he has made you
wait. He’s batting a thousand. But when he comes to the door, you notice that he looks sexy in a
sports coat and he compliments your dress. His tardiness is long-forgotten. It’s really easy for guys to get on your
good side. Too easy.

Dinner is wonderful. Doubling with another couple, you go to your favorite ethnic restaurant in Charlotte. You notice the other
couple is fooling around under the table and you wonder if they think you’re blind. You are also surprised at
how well they can keep up with the dinner conversation when their attentions are evidently so far away. You don’t
really care—you’re just happy everything seems to be running smoothly.

Usually, by this time you have talked enough with your date to realize you don’t have much in common (he
collects automatic weapons, you collect peace stickers). But you're still attracted to this guy, in fact, he’s better than you
thought. You talk in the car on the way home—things look good. You’re enjoying the party at his fraternity—things look
great. You want to blend in, so...
