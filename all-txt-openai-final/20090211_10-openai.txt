Another disgraced slugger: What to make of A-Rod?
Curtis Young
Staff Writer

Alex Rodriguez has been called many things throughout his career. He was widely considered one of the best young players ever when he broke into the league. He was supposed to be the savior of the Mariners when he played with Ken Griffey, Jr., then the savior of the Texas Rangers. Finally, he was supposed to be the superstar that led the Yankees back to baseball’s Promised Land. On the flip side, he has been considered cocky and arrogant. He has been called greedy for taking his record contract from the Rangers and leaving the Mariners scrambling. A-Rod furthermore has been called a team-killer, as his new teams have regressed while his former teams generally improve. The superstar has run the gamut in the baseball world.

One thing he has always been called, though, is clean. Following the steroids era, he has been touted as the savior of baseball’s hallowed record books. He would be the clean, upstanding athlete that would wipe Barry Bonds’ name off of baseball’s most cherished record: the all-time home run leader. With the revelation that Rodriguez, in 2003, tested positive for anabolic steroids, the baseball world has been turned on its head. In tests that actually could lead to no punishment (baseball had not yet implemented penalties for steroid use in 2003) and were supposed to remain confidential, baseball’s savior tested positive for the performance enhancer Primobolan as well as unusually high levels of testosterone.

Davidson started the game slowly, falling behind 10-2 and later 29-20. They took their first lead with under two minutes remaining in the first half and jumped out of the gates quickly after halftime to grab a 60-46 lead with 13 minutes to play. The Wildcats seemed poised to salt the game away, but Charleston erased the lead with an 18-3 run over the next eight minutes to claim a 64-63 lead on Dustin Scott’s put-back. Johnson broke a 68-all tie with a lay-up and two foul shots on back-to-back possessions sandwiched around a turnover by Archambault to give Charleston a 72-68 lead with 1:42 to play. Lovedale brought Davidson within two with 52 seconds to play before White Jr. hit a jumper with 34 seconds remaining to restore the margin. Curry missed two three-pointers, forcing the Wildcats to foul with 19 seconds to play. Andrew Goudelock made both shots, and Barr answered with two at the other end. Wiggins missed two shots with 8 seconds to play, and Curry was able to draw a foul on a three-point attempt with 3.8 seconds to play. His three made free throws equaled his entire second half output to that point and made the score 76-75. White Jr. made one free throw to account for the final margin and set up the ame od e ie ~

The baseball world has been shocked by the leaked information, and Rodriguez’s reputation is forever damaged. His positive tests will bring up several questions as to baseball’s handling of the situation, and I will attempt to address a few in this piece.

First, does this damage A-Rod’s bid to the Hall of Fame? I believe that Hall of Fame credentials should be based upon how players compared to their contemporaries. For example, I do not think we can compare Mickey Mantle to Babe Ruth, or Rodriguez to Lou Gehrig. Baseball has too many variables. As more names become public (and we will likely hear about 103 more from the 2003 tests), it becomes more apparent that only a scant minority of players over the past fifteen years has avoided the use of performance enhancers. It is a crude and unfortunate generalization, but we can assume that nearly everyone in Major League Baseball took some shady measures in order to compete. In other words, if we want to completely blast Bonds, Rodriguez, or Roger Clemens, we need to consider that they were not alone, but likely only the ones that got caught.

Do we need to wipe the steroid era out of baseball history? I do not believe we can or should. Treat it for what it is. Every era has had players taking various methods to enhance their performances.

Second, should we really condemn these players for using steroids? Again, I do not believe we can or should. For many players, the use of performance enhancers meant the difference between financial stability for life and bouncing around the minor leagues in buses. The choice is obviously difficult given the game’s final ill-fated play. The Cougars’ greatest advantage lay in their dominance in rebounding. They out-rebounded Davidson 50-31, including a 19-11 disparity on the offensive glass that led to 19 second-chance points. Charleston also shot 76 percent from the charity stripe for the game (19-25). Davidson shot only 38 percent from the floor for the game (23-60). The Wildcats had greater luck Thursday night before 11,000 fans in the Greensboro Coliseum against the lowly Spartans. Davidson again struggled from the floor, mirroring the 38 percent mark that would haunt the Wildcats against the Cougars two days later. Greensboro was slightly worse,However, shooting only 37.3 percent, Davidson was led by Curry’s 29 points and a career night from Stephen Rossiter ’09. He had career-highs of 14 points and 13 rebounds to provide toughness on a night in which the Wildcats struggled to dismiss one of the Southern Conference’s cellar dwellers. The Spartans opened the game with a 7-1 run before giving up 16 unanswered points. They would later close the gap to 26-20 with just under five minutes to play in the first half before going down 37-24 at the break. One final run by Greensboro saw the Spartans trail by only six at 43-37. A missed dunk signaled the end of their momentum.

There are undoubtedly negative effects when using steroids. They are not, however, as obvious as generally perceived. In fact, several studies have indicated that the effects on grown men are generally not life-threatening. In terms of personal use, I do not believe athletes owe baseball or many of its fans an apology. They do, however, owe an apology to the countless younger athletes who knew Bonds used steroids, or Mark McGwire used steroids, or now Alex Rodriguez used steroids. Seeing the athletic prowess of these steroid users has caused many in the younger generation to view similar methods as acceptable. While negative effects on full-grown bodies may be overstated, the effect of steroids on developing bodies is universally considered significant. They can stunt growth and cause many problems as young athletes grow into their bodies.

Taken in a vacuum, I understand the use of steroids by professional athletes. I understand the millions of dollars and the ability to support their families. Unfortunately, sports do not exist in a vacuum. While they may not want the responsibility, professional athletes serve as role models to our young generation. Highly visible athletes such as A-Rod carry an even larger burden. His mistake will resonate through the baseball world, but its largest effect will not be on baseball’s record books, as many suggest. Instead, it will negatively affect countless athletes who idealize him. To them, he owes an apology.

Steve Rossiter ’09 battles for a rebound in Saturday’s loss to Charleston. Earlier in the week, Rossiter had a career-high 14 points and 13 boards in the win over UNCG. However, the Wildcats finally pulled away with a 28-12 run. Davidson forced 20 Spartan turnovers and scored 27 points off of them. The Wildcats also scored 27 second-chance points on the strength of 25 offensive rebounds. Saturday’s defeat dropped the Wildcats to 20-4, and 13-1 in the Southern Conference. Davidson maintains a 3-game lead over The Citadel and a 3.5-game lead over the Cougars with six games to play. The Wildcats will return to action Thursday when they travel to Spartanburg to take on Wofford at 7:00 p.m.
