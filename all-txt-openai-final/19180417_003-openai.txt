MEETING SATURDAY, APRIL 13

At the regular meeting of the Eumenean Society last Saturday night, it was voted to do away with the regular
program and to have the election of the fall term officers. The vote was close for all the officers, particularly
so for the member of the debating council. The following officers were declared elected: President, Flinn; Vice-President, Wm. Love; Secretary,
Boulware; Treasurer, Wm. Love; Debating Council, McGirt; Reviewer, Potts.

Cousar read a letter from one of the literary societies of the University of Alabama, concerning the forming of a
literary union at a conference at Birmingham, Ala., on the 29th of this month. It was decided to appoint a
committee to confer with the Phi Society to make a more thorough investigation of the matter before any definite action
is taken. The committee as appointed is composed of J. R. Woods, Cousar, and Bellingrath.

Announcement was made of the debate with Roanoke, Friday, April 19. It was urged that as many as possible be
present and help the Davidson debaters defeat the visitors.

The question for debate in the Phi Society Saturday was: “Resolved, That the United States Government should have control of
the coal mines.” The affirmative was upheld by Stone and Spence, who argued that government control is necessary in order
to supply the demand for the coming year and to prevent a shortage in fuel, such as occurred during the
past winter. The negative was defended by Wilson and McKeithen, who contended that the shortage of coal during the past
winter was not due to lack of efficiency in the management of the mines but to a lack of cars
to move the coal. They contended also that it would be a step toward socialism. The judges decided in favor
of the negative.

Morton gave an oration on “The Money God.” Morrison delivered a declamation, “The Beginning of Free Masonry.”

The proposition of joining a union of literary societies in the South was discussed and the society finally decided to
leave it to a committee to take the necessary action.

EUMENEAN SERVICE FLAG

At a recent meeting, the Eumenean Society decided to have a service flag made in honor of her former members
who are now in active service. The flag will contain a star for every old member who took an active
part in the society for at least one year, whose dues and fines were paid up in full at the
time of his entering the service. The flag will contain some fifty odd stars which will probably be arranged in
an appropriate design. The order has been given to a reputable concern in Atlanta, and the flag is expected to
be completed within the next two or three weeks.Extemporan- Alexander; Declamations: Long
