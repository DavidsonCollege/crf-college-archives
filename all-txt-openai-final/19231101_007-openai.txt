THE DAVIDSONIAN, NOVEMBER 1, 1923

AS YOU WERE

Above is a group picture of the Davidson football squad of 1904, and about it are individual pictures of the letter men of that year. Those comprising the team were: Moore, J. W., right end; Whitaker, I., center; Lentz, C. M., left guard; Thompson, I., left tackle; Currie, T. I., left halfback; Gibson, W. T., fullback; Sloop, I. H., right guard; Stockard, C. S., right tackle; McCallie, K., left end; Lacy, W. S., right halfback; Bealle, manager; C. R. Williams, coach. Substitutes: Miller, Daniels, Croom, McKeithan.

The scores rolled up by the team are:
Davidson 0
Davidson 0
Davidson 0
Davidson 0
Davidson 6
Davidson 0
Davidson 0
Davidson 6
Davidson 12
Totals 24

And those rolled up against it follow:
Morganton Mutes 0
University of North Carolina 12
Bingham 0
Guilford 0
Virginia Military Institute 0
University of South Carolina 0
Welch Neck High School 0
Guilford 0
Totals 12

The University of North Carolina and the Virginia Military Institute scores look sort of good to us now. If the 1923 Squad not only holds the U. N. C. side of the scoreboard to a goose-egg, but runs up a winning margin on Davidson's side, they'll probably get a picture like this run of them every year between now and the occasion of the junking of the Davidsonian, which to our minds, lies many, many years away.

DAVIDSON ALUMNUS A LEADER IN MEDICAL PROFESSION

Dr. Porter P. Vinson entered Davidson with the Class of 1909. He is twice a Davidson man, being a native of the town and an alumnus of the college. After graduating from Davidson, he entered the University of Maryland, where he took his M.D. degree. After obtaining his degree at the U. of Md., Dr. Vinson was resident physician at the Trudeau Sanitarium, Saranac, N. Y., where he practiced for two years. Upon completion of his second year at Saranac, he entered the Montreal General Hospital, Montreal, Canada, as a Pathologist. Remaining here only a year, Dr. Vinson was given a position with...

---the famous Brothers, in the Mayo Clinic, at Rochester, Minn. Since his appointment, he has been on the immediate staff of the Mayo Clinic. Dr. Vinson has specialized in the disease of the oesophagus and is considered an authority in this line. His work has won for him great distinction in the medical world. It has also made him one of the most important men on the staff of the Mayo Clinic. In achieving such wonderful success in the medical world, Dr. Vinson has not only brought great honor to himself but has also made Davidson justly proud of him.

Mrs. Goode Cheatham, from Henderson, spent Sunday with her sister, Miss Mamie Withers.
