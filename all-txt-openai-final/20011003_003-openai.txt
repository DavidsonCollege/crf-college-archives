The new SGA Open Forum is now open in the Microsoft Outlook Public Folders for students, faculty, staff, and administration to post and read messages. This is an open forum in the truest sense, so participants can post comments, questions, or concerns on any number of topics regarding Davidson.

While accessible through Outlook Web Access (http://www.mail.davidson.edu), the best way to access the forum is through Outlook 2000. To access the open forum in Outlook 2000 (the same program you use to check e-mail), click on the View menu and select “Folder List” if it is not already selected.

Then, in the folder list that appears below the toolbar in Outlook, click on the plus sign to the left of “Public Folders.” Then, click on the plus sign to the left of “Student Life.” Then, click on “SGA OPEN FORUM.” From there, you may read and post items. To post, click on the “New” button in the top left corner of the Outlook window.

To make it easier to access the open forum in the future, you may want to add it to your Outlook Bar or Outlook Favorites. To add this folder to your Outlook Bar, simply right-click on “SGA OPEN FORUM” in the folder list. Select “Add to Outlook Bar.” It should now appear in your Outlook Bar if “Outlook Bar” is selected in the View menu.

To add this folder to your Outlook Favorites (appearing in the folder list), right-click on “SGA OPEN FORUM” in the folder list and select “Copy ‘SGA OPEN FORUM’...”. In the window that appears, highlight “Favorites” under “Public Folders.” Click OK. The “SGA OPEN FORUM” folder should now appear under Favorites in the folder list. Alternatively, you may, in the folder list, simply drag “SGA OPEN FORUM” on top of your Favorites folder to add it to your Favorites.

Finally, if you only use Outlook Web Access (http://www.mail.davidson.edu) to check your email, once you have logged in, you may access the open forum by clicking on the Public Folders icon on the left side of your web browser. In the “All Public Folders” list that then appears to the right of the Public Folders icon, scroll down and click on “Student Life.” Then click on “SGA OPEN FORUM.” From there, you may read items and post items. To post, click on the yellow note icon in the toolbar.
