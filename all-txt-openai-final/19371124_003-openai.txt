Question of the Week

The winter zip is in the air, and already thoughts are turning to mid-winters. And after all, it’s less than a month till Christmas, and after the holiday only a month more till the big affair.

The Pan-Hellenic Council has already got down to business, and we're hearing all around that a couple of the members are about to hop off for the Big Town to sign up one of the big boys. At least, we hope so.

Just to give the council an idea of what the gang would like, if they haven't got the idea by now, we went around searching answers to the question: “What orchestra would you prefer for the Mid-winter Dances, and Why?”

As you can see, the response is overwhelmingly Kemp. Of course, Dorsey came in for his share of top honors in several, and was put down for second choice by more than one.

Here are the answers:

Tom Page, Junior:
“Hal Kemp. I like his style of music, as well as Skinny Ennis and Maxine Gray. He’s got a good orchestra, too. Next to Kemp I'd take him.”

Hector McGeachy, Senior:
“I'd say Hal Kemp. I particularly like Kemp's brass section and triple-tonguing trumpets. I like his light style. Who doesn’t? I prefer Tommy Dorsey as second choice.”

Mme. McKee Interviewed by Reporter

“There is very little to write about me, for I have had only one husband. I have never been divorced.” These are the words with which Madame Matilde McKee, lecturer for L’Alliance Francaise, answered the reporter's request for an interview.

Mme. McKee was the honor guest at a reception given after her concert by Le Cercle Francais. She answered all questions asked her quickly and frankly, but refused to listen to English. Whenever a question was asked in English she asked that it be repeated in French.

Instead of the usual flow of flowery speech after the question, “How do you like it here?” Mme. McKee said merely, that it was very nice. To prove that she meant it, later she added that she liked to go to schools, but that her husband usually accompanied her when she went to female institutions.

When asked where her husband was at that time, she replied, “An indiscreet question, isn’t it?” Then she laughed and said he was in Baltimore. She and her husband lived in Atlanta for six years, where her husband taught at Georgia Tech.

Mme. McKee concluded her interview by saying that she has a daughter ten years old. She added that she is going to start taking her daughter with her on her trips and then go to nothing but boys’ schools.

She turned the tables on the reporter then by asking about the orchestra here. After some confusion it was found that she spoke of “Chubby” King, and not of the College Band. She said she had heard them in Baltimore.

Check Sent to Annuity Fund

According to Sam Newell, cabinetman assigned to Vesper offerings, the student body gave forty dollars to the cause by means of the Vesper offering on Sunday evening. Newell, who is in charge of the Vesper offerings, also reported some other interesting facts about the weekly collections. He estimated that the Vesper offerings averaged about ten dollars per service. This average, however, suffers a slight letdown with the coming of the Christmas holidays.

Dr. Walter L. Lingle, president of the college, was the principal speaker at the Youth Rally sponsored by the Charlotte Y. M. C. A. (Courtesy of The Charlotte Observer).
