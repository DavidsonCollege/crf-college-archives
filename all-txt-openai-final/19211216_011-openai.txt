FIRE ALWAYS MAY BE CONTROLLED

Davidson College Would Have Today the Grand Old Chamber Protected from the Peril of Fire

The Way Built to Burn
Is the subject of a placard that may be tacked on most of the institutions of learning—in fact, on most
of the institutions of any character, in this country. And all that is necessary to complete the announcement is: “Time
Past Due But Not Yet Arrived.” Davidson College deferred the inevitable for a longer time than usual, perhaps, but the
Fire Fiend is a patient devil and bides his time, and, finally, in his soul-scorching pyrography, inscribed the name of
Davidson in his list along with Cornell, Wellesley, Vassar and other colleges which were vulnerable to his attacks.

Those who doubt the vulnerability of most institutional properties to attacks of fire had better study the fire record. “There
are burned on an average every week ten schools, two college buildings and three public halls,” said Commissioner P. P.
Claxton, of the Bureau of Education, Department of the Interior, Washington, in the introduction of the booklet, “Fire Protection for
Schools,” prepared and printed for the Department by the National Fire Protection Association. It is estimated by the Actuarial Bureau
of the National Board of Fire Underwriters that school properties go up in smoke at the rate of $6,000,000 a
year. But the peril to human life is incalculable. Who’s next?

Among those not likely to be in the Southern States are:
In North Carolina: N. C. College of Agriculture and Mechanical Arts, West Raleigh; School for Deaf and Dumb, Morganton.
In South Carolina: Clemson College, Calhoun.
In Georgia: Georgia School of Technology, Atlanta; Columbus Industrial High School, also Secondary Industrial School, Columbus.
In Mississippi: Mississippi Agricultural and Mechanical College, Starkville.
In Tennessee: Vanderbilt University, and Buford College, Nashville.
In Texas: Texas Textile School, College Station.

Why? Because they are equipped with apparatus for automatic control of fire—automatic sprinkler systems.

The Essentials of Fire Safety
A concise and comprehensive description of the reason why will be found in “Fire Protection for Schools,” prepared and printed
for the Fire Protection Association. “The next best thing * * * is to see beyond question the most dependable
device for accomplishing this, as is witnessed by a remarkable record of performance covering thirty-five years, which is summarized in
the following statement unanimously passed by the National Fire Protection Association at its 1914 convention:

“It is today an almost unquestioned fact that automatic sprinklers afford the highest degree of protection against fire in practically
all cases where there is combustible construction or material, the rapid burning of which is liable to be a menace
to the lives of occupants of the building.”

“Structural improvements and the use of fire-resistive building material in new buildings make possible a degree of safety in them
which cannot be secured in existing structures except by the application of automatic sprinklers.”

“Some school boards and principals either have not understood the value of sprinklers or have been prejudiced against them, but
in many of the older schools automatic sprinklers are the logical answer to the problem of securing greater safety.”

Automatic Fire Control
Concerning the essentials of fire safety, this is said: “Obviously the way to escape fire danger is to have no
fires. That means fire prevention. The next best thing is to see that any fire that starts is invariably extinguished
while it is still small. The automatic sprinkler system is today an almost unquestioned fact that automatic sprinklers afford the
highest degree of protection against fire in practically all cases where there is combustible construction or material, the rapid burning
of which is liable to be a menace to the lives of occupants of the building.”

Information Service
Automatic sprinklers are not affected by smoke as are human fire fighters, and can be arranged to give an alarm
the moment water flows from the sprinkler system. The sprinkler has a 1/4 inch orifice or nozzle and a device
that opens at 160° F., which is less than the boiling point of water. The sprinkler has a 1/4 inch
orifice or nozzle and a device that opens at 160° F., which is less than the boiling point of water.

“While the school buildings should be equipped with the necessary apparatus, the ordinary school over one story high, if of
combustible construction, needs automatic sprinklers, and needs them badly. Frequently, an installation of sprinklers will furnish a sufficient degree of
protection to render unnecessary expensive structural changes that would otherwise be imperative. The sprinkler, if properly maintained, is on duty
day and night, goes into action as soon as the fire reaches modest proportions, and is not affected by external
factors. Sprinkler heads are made with a special solder which melts at about 160 degrees Fahrenheit, releasing a deflector, and
under usual pressures will discharge 15 to 20 gallons of water per minute in the form of a drenching spray
over an area of perhaps 15 feet in diameter. As the sprinklers are seldom placed over 10 feet apart, these
spray circles overlap, and a fire has little chance to burn or spread.”

Appreciation of Automatic Control of Fire

Several years ago, the insurance commissioner of the State of South Carolina made a public appeal for consideration of the
principle of automatic control of fire through the officials responsible for the safety of life in the institutions of learning
and mercy in that State. In part, he said: “I am taking the liberty of asking your consideration of the
installation of what are known as automatic sprinkler apparatus in such buildings under your care as need complete fire protection
for the safety of the buildings and the safety of the inmates. I am thoroughly persuaded that the matter is
one of great importance in respect of the safety of the buildings and the lives under your care.”

Concerning its investigation of the fire hazard in the Minneapolis, Minn., schools, the Council, Parents and Teachers’ Associations of that
city said: “There is an element of danger present which cannot be denied by those familiar with the facts. This
condition no doubt exists in many of the American cities, and many of the officials that are supposed to look
after the welfare of the citizens make their investigations after, rather than before, a catastrophe. During the investigations of this
committee and from unbiased testimony from experts and research, it has developed that the Automatic Sprinkler is the best agency
for the preservation of Life and Property from fire. The committee has failed to find any loss of lives from
fire in a building that had been properly equipped with a sprinkler system, and this committee will recommend that all
non-fireproof schools be equipped with the most modern system that can be procured.”

Recently, a fire in the Oregon State Hospital, Salem, Oregon, was controlled by an automatic sprinkler. Concerning this, Superintendent Steiner
said: “The damage was slight from the fire. The sprinkler, as usual, was on the job and produced ideal results.
The presence of the Automatic Sprinkler System in our institution certainly relieves us of a great deal of worry and
has saved the state many times more than its cost of installation.”

Examples of the Remedy Before You

The torch of the fire fiend which has been laying waste to the educational institutions of the country touches the
modern textile industry very lightly. Why? Because the textile industry has been tried by fire, apprehends the economic havoc of
it, appreciates the limitations of insurance, and the vital need of fire-control. And how has it been done? By automatic
control of fire by automatic water sprinklers which are opened by fire itself. It would be impossible to operate the
textile industry at all without automatic sprinklers. They are just as essential as the machinery of production and the sheltering
buildings. Why? Because the frequency of process fires in cotton mills, for example, is more than in any other kind
of human activity. But despite this frequency, the cost of fire insurance in the modern cotton mill is less than
in any other class of endeavor. And this has been brought about by automatic control of fire. What is said
in the preceding paragraphs applies with particular force to the mills of North Carolina. What it has done for the
preservation of the textile industry, automatic fire control by automatic sprinklers will do for any other class of property. Automatic
sprinklers have been putting out fires for over 40 years. Today, it is estimated that upwards of 20,000,000 persons work
daily under this protection. How many school children and students in the country are gaining an education under similar protection
from the peril of fire? The answer is, Not very many! Ask any progressive fire insurance agent for information about
apparatus for automatic control of fire, and be sure that it is of the kind approved by the Underwriters’ Laboratories.
