Students ought to get used to seeing the new Union Board slogan, "Every Event, Every Time."

"We realistically intend for every activity we produce to be a success," says Jennifer Mickle '05, Union Board Vice President.

Since 1952 and in numerous locales, the Union has been the center of social life on campus. Trenita Brookshire '05
knows what the Union Board is all about, "I think they are much more active now than in previous years.
I think they work hard to prevent students' boredom in a small town."

In the past, the Union Board has brought speakers and entertainers including comedian Bill Cosby, NAACP chair Julian Bond, and
towering college-acoustic icons Dave Matthews and John Mayer to campus.

Peter Tittiger '08 is already in awe of the Union Board, "I was really impressed with the variety of things
the Union Board has to offer the student body. No matter what you're into, the UB will almost certainly have
something planned that you'll enjoy."

The Union Board has started the year out strong for incoming freshmen by offering events such as "Disorientation" and "Just
Chill." Juniors join in on the fun.

Students looking for an affordable fine arts venue with a wide and exciting array of performances need not look farther
than Davidson's own Duke Family Performance Hall. Not only does this year’s C. Shaw and Nancy K. Smith Artist Series
bring a diverse and exciting range of performances to campus, but student discounts make buying tickets hard to pass up.

This year’s Artist Series consists of performances by the Koresh Dance Company, Chicago City Limits, Bruce Wood Dance Company, and
the Poncho Sanchez Latin Jazz Band. The wide variety of performances coming to Davidson ensures that there will be something
for everyone. Said Assistant Director of the Union Lee Ann Bannerman, "These are groups that will appeal to the students."

A first-year shows off her tie-dye during “Dis-Orientation.” Many students enjoyed the activities, no matter how crazy they were made
to look. "At first I had to take it all in, especially when I saw the toilet race, but the
games and activities really made me loosen up and I had so much fun with my new friends," says Elyse
Harris '08.

The student body had their first opportunity to meet the Union Board and sign up for committees during the activities
fair on August 22. There is a variety of committees to get involved with throughout the year. For students with
a keen eye for blockbuster movies, the Premier Films committee is a likely home. For those whose taste runs more
towards the "artsy," the Fine Films committee, in its first year, may be a more apt fit, showcasing smaller, independent
movies and classics in the art house tradition. Another new committee, Recess, will take students back to memories of middle
school with activities such as four square and dodgeball. Interested students might want to refresh their...Memories of middle school game
rules because the first event will be “Capture the Flag” on Friday, September 3. Choreography that is a mixture of
ballet, jazz, and modern dance. Founded in 1991, the company has received favorable reviews and presented sold-out performances.

since and is now New York’s longest-running comedy revue. Chicago City Limits has made frequent television appearances including “The Today
Show” and Comedy Central and has received rave reviews from the New York Times and others.

Bruce Wood Dance Company will be performing Friday, January 28. Founded in 1996 and based out of Fort Worth, the
company features the choreography of Bruce Wood. Mr. Wood has studied at the School of American Ballet, spent four years
as a soloist with San Francisco Ballet, worked as a principal dancer in Les Ballets Jazz de Montreal, served as
a guest artist for numerous companies, and performed and taught throughout the world.

The Poncho Sanchez Latin Jazz Band, featuring the GRAMMY-winning Poncho Sanchez, will perform Saturday, April 9. An amazing musician and

New committees and motto

In some minds, the Board’s most important committee, Artists Series, will help bring many different types of performers, the first
being Koresh Dance Company on September 10. A final featured committee is Coffeehouse. As the name suggests, the committee will
have more intimate events where students can spend close time with friends while pursuing a variety of indoor activities. Mickle
strongly advises new and old students to sign up for committees and have ideas turned into realities. Mickle and Union
Board President Nathan Cox ‘05 have been involved for most of their time at Davidson and say it’s what they
love. Cox is optimistic and emphasizes the Board's inclusive character of late. With seven committees and seats to fill, the
Board provides ample opportunity for student involvement. “I chose to join the Union Board to make a difference on campus,”
says Cox, “The Union Board is now more conscious because the board reflects the campus community. Any successes we have
I attribute to that.”
