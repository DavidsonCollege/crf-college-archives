The DAVIDSONIAN VOL 2.

Blue Pencil Club Organized for Work To Promote More Effective Literary Work.

The Blue Pencil Club, composed of those who are interested in writing and literature and who, perhaps, may have some literary aspirations, has been organized at Davidson. As the name would indicate, the membership will be composed of those who would criticize literary productions, as well as those who write for the various college publications. The first meeting was held on last Wednesday evening and plans were made for the Spring meetings, which for a time, at least, will be held once each month. The object of the club, as outlined, will be “To promote effective literary work among the students.” It is felt that an organization of this kind will be able to centralize the work of those interested in the college publications and that it will be mutually helpful to its members. One of the features of the organization is that certain members of the faculty have been invited to be present and take an active part. This they have agreed to do, and Drs. Sentelle and Fulton were present at the last meeting. Dr. J. W. McConnell was unable to attend on account of sickness. There shall be two elections of members each year. One of these elections will be of members from the Junior class, on the first Monday in March and the other election will be from the Senior class, on the second Monday in October. Clubs of this character have been organized in several of the Southern Colleges and in practically all of the Northern institutions. The meetings will be informal gatherings, with generally some certain topic for papers and discussion and it is planned that coffee and sandwiches served during the evening will be a part of each program. Those present last Wednesday night were F. W. Price, T. B. Faw, U. S. Alexander, Stuart Gilchrist, G. W. Giannilliat, W. M. McIlwaine, T. P. Williams, Dr. Sentelle, and Dr. Fulton.

DR. AND MRS. LINGLE SPEAK IN SALISBURY

Last Friday Dr. and Mrs. Lingle were the speakers of the evening hour at the dedication of the Rowan Community building in Salisbury. This building will comprise a public library, reading room, museum, etc. Mrs. Lingle gave a short address on Social Service. Dr. Lingle spoke on “American Idealism.” In his address he said that the reason why all America looks to Woodrow Wilson in times of distress is because everyone considers him the most idealistic American. Dr. Lingle was given a hearty ovation by his audience especially when he made the statement that he himself was a native of Rowan county.

MRS. LINGLE TO SPEAK.

The Council for the North Carolina Federation of Woman's Clubs, of which the Davidson Book Lover's Club and Civic League Club are members, will meet in Statesville January 26-29. Mrs. T. W. Lingle will make an address before this Council on Wednesday, the 27th. From there she will go to Raleigh and Chapel Hill to speak before the Social Service Clubs of those cities.

MISS FOREMAN LEADS BAND.

A Band of Camp Fire Girls has been organized by Miss Irene Foreman with nine girls. They are working to win honors and are planning some hikes and outdoor activities this spring. The members are: Elizabeth Grey, Birdie Christenbury, Katherine Potts, Willie Campbell, Eloise Martin, Dorothy Finlayson, Willie Henderson, Mary Thompson, and Sarah Lingle. The boys tried to show what they could do at scouting; but the girls are going to show them up this spring—just watch them! With Miss Foreman in charge the Camp Fire Girls are going to have “crack-aJack” times this year. During Spring Term, at the regular Monday morning meeting of the two Literary Societies, officers for the third term of the collegiate year were elected as follows:

**Phi:**
- President: F. L. Harkey
- Vice President: W. C. Rouke
- Secretary: J. W. Bullock
- First Critic: J. W. S. Gilchrist
- Second Critic: D. Shaw
- First Supervisor: G. McDonald
- Second Supervisor: W. G. Craig

**Eu:**
- President: C. M. Gibbs
- Vice President: F. L. Smith
- Secretary: T. J. Mitchell
- Reviewer: P. D. Patrick
- Debating Council: P. L. B. Price and B. Hagood
- Valedictorian: Norman Johnson
- Respondent: I. G. Patton

Also, a set of resolutions, laid on the tables of the societies two weeks previous, providing that the two societies enter into an agreement to give jointly each year only one Fresh-Soph Declaimer’s Medal, one Fresh-Soph Debater's Medal, one Junior-Senior Debater’s Medal, and one Essayist Medal, and that each society hold preliminary contests to select those who shall compete for these medals, were unanimously accepted by the Eu and rejected by the Phi.

**SEVERAL MEDALS TO BE AWARDED DURING SPRING**

Twelve medals will be presented this spring to the men who show the greatest proficiency in debating, declaiming, original oratory, and writing. Monday night began this interesting series of contests, when the preliminaries for the Davidson intercollegiate debate were held. The finals in this contest will be held probably within two weeks. A medal will be given to each of the four men who will compose the intercollegiate debating teams.

The next contest will be the Junior Oratorical contest, which will take place on March 5 and 6. This medal will be given by both societies and is a very handsome one. Three men will be chosen from each society and a medal will be awarded after the final contest at Commencement.

The preliminaries for the Fresh-Soph Declamatory contest will take place in each society hall on March 20, and the finals will be held on April 3 in Shearer Hall. Each society presents a medal to its winner. The Fresh-Soph debate will be held in each society hall on April 25. The Junior-Senior debate will take place on May 2. Each society will award a medal for each of these contests. The fiction and essay contests will be held at the latter part of April and a medal will be given to the winner of each contest.

Judging by the debating preliminaries of Monday night, these contests will all be interesting and enthusiastic. Everyone is advised to get busy now, or they may find that the other fellow has proved the earlier bird.

**INVITATIONS FOR COMMENCEMENT**

Preparations are being made for the engraving of the annual invitations that are issued at Commencement. A representative of F. A. Wright & Co. was on the Hill last week showing designs for these invitations. A suitable invitation was selected by F. W. Price, the chief marshal. It is said to be the prettiest that Davidson has had for years.

**NO. 16 Juniors Defeat Fresh**

First Class Game Was Attended by Large Crowd.

On Thursday afternoon, in a game featured not by spectacular plays, but by hard, straight football, the Juniors, in the first of the interclass games, defeated the Freshmen by the score of 7 to 0. The Freshmen, winning the toss, chose to receive. The first few minutes of play showed the Juniors, with a heavier line and a faster backfield, to be slightly stronger on the offensive. At the end of the quarter, the ball was in possession of the Juniors on the Fresh 24-yard line.

The Juniors began the second quarter with renewed vim. A succession of line plunges by Neisler, Minter, McNeill, and Crawford brought the ball to the Fresh 5-yard line. Here the Fresh, seeing their goal seriously menaced, braced up, held the Juniors tight, and the ball went over. Crouch punted 25 yards into safe territory. After several line bucks by Perry and Minter for the Juniors and by Ives and Crouch for the Fresh, the ball, at the end of the quarter, rested near the middle of the field.

The third quarter began by Juniors kicking off to the Fresh. After several good gains by Crouch and Armstead for the Fresh, the ball went over to the Juniors. Fighting with a fresh impetus, the Juniors steadily marched to the Fresh 5-yard line, where, by a beautifully executed, over-the-line forward pass, Crawford to Sparrow, they scored the only touchdown of the game. Minter kicked the goal.

Juniors kicking to Fresh began the fourth quarter. Saunders returned 8. Failing to make the required distance, Crouch punted to the 25-yard line and Crawford made a good return of 15. Near the close of the quarter, the Fresh lost a hard chance at scoring when Crouch punted 30 and Clark, running down under the punt, gathered it and ran 18 yards before being tackled.

The following was the line-up of the teams:

**Juniors:**
- Edgerton, c.
