**TRIBUTE TO A JANITOR**

The village is gone, but L. W., his Esquire, and his broom remain.

**BY CHUCK WRIGHT AND JIM KUIST**

"Hey, man, you got any extra clothes hanging around?" ... "Joe, you already slept through two classes, you better get out of bed" ... "Joe, Joe, don’t hit me, you hit me last week" ... "Mrs. Little says you all got to clean this mess up, and quit writing on those damn walls" ... "I seen you move that dresser over that hole in the wall" ... "Hey, man, you got any extra clothes hanging around?" — These are the words of a Davidson immortal; he is a part of a tradition. One sees him standing majestically, broom in hand, on the wooden back porch of a village apartment. A generation of Davidsonians in their college careers loved the village as their home. L. W. was a member of the household. He was the official alarm clock; a conspirator in gayety; the best of jokes; confidant in sorrows; and guardian of the dresser drawer. As long as the spirit of the Village shall remain, in the memories of those who lived there, L. W. Nelson will stand as a monument to this institution.

This gay young blade hails from Cornelius, a thriving little community a few rods down the road from the City. Married to his childhood sweetheart, at the height of his virility, he is a happy family man. He is a pillar of his community. Davidson students, however, know little of L. W. as a family man. To them, he is recognized as one of the rising young janitors on the Davidson campus, known for his wit and beaming smile. He has been taken in as an honorary member of a number of the campus social fraternities, his presence being most conspicuous at the conclusion of the spring semester along the many beach resorts sprawling the Carolina coast.

Today L. W. sweeps his beat along the second-floor aisle and recesses of Belk dormitory. This is a new environment for him, as it is for those who moved with him from the shady lawns and picturesque little rooms of the village opposite the college; to these yawning gaping painted walls and long corridors, this mammoth brick and mortar edifice that stands to the ingenuity of our administration. Undoubtedly he yearns for the good ole’ days. But the good ole’ days, and pleasant memories, and times be submerged, as creative independence is submerged to the martinet authority of modern educational technicians. Here’s to L. W.!

**THE INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION REPORT: Thousands of American Students Study Abroad**

(Special to the Davidsonian)

Over 9,000 U.S. students studied abroad during 1954-55, according to the preliminary returns released yesterday, of a survey taken by the Institute of International Education, 1 East 67th Street, New York City. Initial returns from this first statistical report on American students abroad indicate that 9,262 U.S. citizens studied in 47 foreign countries and political areas during the past academic year. The survey was limited to students having both U.S. citizenship and permanent residence in the United States.

The Institute’s survey, first undertaken as a pilot project in 1953, was conducted by means of a questionnaire sent to 1,000 institutions of higher education in 74 foreign countries and political areas. Replies have been received from a total of 836 institutions or 83.6 percent of those polled: 379 institutions reported 9,262 U.S. students enrolled; 457 reported no U.S. students. A final report on U.S. students abroad will be included in the 1956 Open Doors, the Institute’s annual census report on foreign students, scholars, and doctors in the United States.

Where did the American students study? Almost 59 percent (5,461) of those reported were enrolled in European schools; 15 percent were in Mexico; and 14.8 percent in Canada. Four countries reported over 1,000 U.S. citizens in their institutions of higher education: Mexico, 1,395; Canada, 1,374; Italy, 1,084, and the United Kingdom, 1,009.

European countries. In addition to Italy and the United Kingdom, where over 100 U.S. students enrolled were: Germany, 834; France, 805; Switzerland, 759; the Netherlands, 200; Spain, 165; Austria, 158; and Belgium, 134.

There were 624 students in the Far East, 491 of these in the Philippines and 112 in Japan. The Near East received 141—81 in Israel and 54 in Lebanon. In the Western Hemisphere, in addition to Mexico and Canada, there were 51 students enrolled in Caribbean countries and 100 in South America. Of this last number, 85 went to Peru.

**Philanthropic Meeting Featured by Poems**

On November 9th, the Philanthropic Society held its second meeting of the present year. The program consisted of selected poems written by Jim Armstead, Harry Antrim, and Andy Watson. The reading of these poems stimulated a lively discussion among the group concerning the merits of contemporary poetry. One of Mr. Armstead’s poems was singled out by the group for its outstanding qualities. After this discussion, the program chairman brought before the Society...

**Eumanean Literary Society to Meet In Union Monday**

The Eumanean Literary Society will hold a tradition-breaking meeting this Monday night, November 21. It will commence promptly at 7:00 p.m. in the Green Room of the Union rather than at the usual time and place. These changes are designed to prevent the program from cutting into both ends of the members’ evening. Dr. Chalmers Davidson will read the second section of his epistolary novel, Alenda Lux. Last spring Dr. Davidson presented to the Society the first set of letters of the Pharrs, a mythical five-generation Davidson family. The second generation story is closely tied in with Davidson during the War Between the States. The reading will be divided into two parts by a coffee break. Quotations and business will be dispensed with for the Monday night meeting to make possible this interesting and significant program.

**Mediterranean Problems Discussed at IRC Meet**

The last meeting of the International Relations Club met in the Green Room of the College Union. The program for this meeting dealt with problems around the Mediterranean area: the North African situation; the Cyprus problem; and the Israeli-Egyptian crisis. Boyce Martin gave a survey of the situation existing in French North Africa. He traced the history of the three areas of Algeria, French Morocco, and Tunisia, emphasizing the French policy in each case, and recounting the events which have taken place there in recent months. Next, John Trask gave an account of the crisis existing between the British government and the island of Cyprus. Cyprus, a British...

...come in the form of housing, etc. To complete the list, lawyers’ income increased an average of 99 percent and dentists’, 153 percent. How do Davidson's faculty salaries rate with those of other schools? Academically, Davidson is regarded as being comparable to such schools as Amherst, Bowdoin, Haverford, Swarthmore, Wesleyan, and Williams. But the top faculty salary in 1953-54 at these six other small institutions ranged from $8,280 to $11,000 whereas Davidson’s...

**Grigg Fountain Slated To Perform Monday**

The Charlotte chapter of the...There were 31 students in Africa—18 in Egypt and 9 in the Union of South Africa. Oceania received 85 students—66 in Australia and 19 in New Zealand. Cyprus, a British crown colony off the coast of Turkey, has for over a hundred years been demanding what it calls enosis, which means union with the motherland. The British desire to hold their first Mediterranean outpost for several reasons, including using it as a military base, which has become more significant since Britain has recently evacuated the Suez Canal Zone. Cyprus, on the other hand, desires union with Greece since 80 percent of the population of the island is Greek, the people having the same language and the same religion as the Greeks on the continent. Tom Tennent then gave the third part of the program which dealt with the clashes between Egypt and Israel. He pointed out that the main cause of the tension was the Gaza strip, a narrow strip of land between the two countries. He then discussed details of the clashes, showing how much of the incidents were based on poor Egyptian-Jewish relations, and how the two countries of Egypt and Israel actually had much in common.

SUNDAY NIGHT "AT HOME” SCHEDULE OF PROFESSORS FOR STUDENT VISITING

Davidson's top faculty salary was $6,350. This, of course, puts Davidson in an inferior position in the market for teachers. In North Carolina, Davidson is no better off. Duke pays a top faculty salary of $10,500. A professor's salary at the three divisions of the University of North Carolina begins at about $6,500 and goes on up from there. With the additional $150 yearly increase last spring, Davidson's top faculty salary became $6,500. In the state as a whole, Davidson's faculty salaries are comparable to those of such schools as East Carolina, Shaw, and Lenoir Rhyne.

The motion, “that each member of Philanthropic Literary Society be required to submit some form of creative writing during the year in order to retain membership in the Society,” was brought before the group. Later in the evening, a resolution stating, “that the Philanthropic Literary Society hereby publishes and makes known its disapproval of the publication entitled, THE INTERCOLLEGIAN, holding the views of that publication to be unsound in reason and dangerous in implication,” was discussed but voting was postponed until the next meeting to allow more members to express their views upon the resolution. A debate concerning this resolution will form a part of the program of the meeting to be held Monday, November 21st, at 8:30 p.m. in Phi Hall. The meeting was closed with a few words by the society’s president, Dick Morehead, concerning the goals and aspirations of the Society for the present year. Those goals being to promote more creative writing on the campus in general, and to create intelligent analysis and critical thinking on the part of the members of the Society concerning present social and economic problems that confront our society today.

Wofford Terriers (Continued From Page Three)

The Wildcats were behind in the scoring. They were not behind in the scrapping, however. In the first quarter, the Cat offense drove to the Wofford 37 and nearly scored. In the second quarter, they again drove to the Wofford eight, but the Terrier defense tightened. The stubborn line from South Carolina was not to be run over. The second Wofford score came on a pass play that the Davidson fans disputed with the referee by moaning over the ruling. Burns dropped a pass from Jones but fell on it. The referee ruled the pass complete; the fumble recovered thus giving the Terriers the ball on the Cat 32. The score came a few plays later on another pitch-out from Jones, this time to B. B. Stevens who covered three yards around right end to score. The Wildcat touchdown drive was started early in the fourth quarter from its own 22. Dyke Little’s passing to Bill Gramley was clicking with rapid precision. The Cats drove for four first downs in a row with Don Comer going over from the three. Fagg’s conversion attempt failed. The stands became intensely excited at this time and were yelling for another Wildcat touchdown as the score was 14-9. But the Spartanburg Terriers were as riled up as anyone. Starting from their own 25, they marched all the way to paydirt on the same tactics they had been using all afternoon; namely, an option and a couple of good crossbuck plays. This time DePrete went around right end to score. Burns made his third extra point. The absence of Tom Newton and Jim Patterson at ends hurt the Cat team. They missed Don McRee also. Standing out for the Wildcats, however, were Don Campbell in particular, Lyle Lewellyn, David Fagg, Bill Gramley, Ken Conger, Dyke Little, and Dick Belton. The band, too, spelled out D-O-L-E in honor of Davidson's head coach and played “For He’s A Jolly Good Fellow.” Tribute was also paid to the Wildcat seniors who played their last home game. For Wofford, Charlie Jones, Frank DePrete, Weyland Burns, and B. B. Stevens were the standouts.
