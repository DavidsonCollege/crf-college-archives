A NEW COACH

I was able to corner Coach Harry Fogleman a few days ago in between matches of perhaps the busiest sport
at Davidson. Coach Fogleman is one of the newest additions to the coaching staff. He formerly coached tennis at the
University of Cincinnati and is presently a member of two committees of the United States Lawn Tennis Association—the Junior Development
Committee and the Research and Planning Committee.

Tennis is another of the sports at Davidson which is not subsidized. Yet our tennis team has undertaken a schedule
that includes such big-time teams as Michigan State University, University of Indiana, and the University of North Carolina. Coach Fogleman
brings a really different approach to tennis, which he refers to as one of the “other sports rather than minor
sports.” He believes that tennis at Davidson can be an important part of the athletic program. When he took over
the reins at Davidson, the tennis program had sunk to such a point that few people cared to know who
the tennis team was playing. Since Fogleman has taken over, there has been a change. Here I think are some
of the reasons for this change.

Fogleman has a great number of contacts with many of the finest young tennis players in the country through his
membership in various tennis committees. When he arrived at Davidson, he began writing these boys probing to see if they
were interested in coming to Davidson. Some of these boys are at Davidson now, forming the basis of this year’s
freshman team. Why did they come? “I believe you can promote anything if you believe in it and can back
it up.” This is Fogleman's philosophy for building tennis and attracting young tennis players. There is no doubt that he
believes in tennis.

Since coming to Davidson he has supervised the repair of all of the courts. Much of this repair work has
been done through his own labor. He has also put forth a great deal of effort in an attempt to
interest outstanding young tennis players in coming to Davidson. And he has built up a schedule that is geographically representative
as well as containing some of the better tennis teams in the country. He believes in tennis. He also believes
that Davidson can back up a good tennis program. Although he lost one of his prize recruits because he could
not offer him an athletic scholarship, he emphasized that a good tennis program does not necessarily mean tennis scholarships. He
asserts that the educational advantages that Davidson offers and our tennis facilities, which he describes as “the finest in the
South,” present a great deal of material with which to work in recruiting tennis players.

Coach Fogleman has already learned a great deal about recruiting without scholarships. He continues to write letters to young players
with whom he comes in contact. But he has discovered that one of the most important factors in recruiting a
boy is to get him on the college campus. As a result of this knowledge, he has contacted many of
the prep schools and high schools in this area and invited them to play our freshman team. To date he
has already landed two boys for next year’s freshman team as a direct result of these matches.

One more way in which prospective students get an opportunity to see Davidson is through the Southern Juniors and Boys
Tournament, which is held at Davidson every year. This is the largest tournament for young tennis players in the South,
and any tennis player who seeks to be nationally ranked must play in this tournament. Coach Fogleman has an opportunity
during this tournament to show a great number of boys what he has to offer at Davidson.

The final factor which Mr. Fogleman did not mention that he offers to incoming tennis players is Coach Fogleman. There
is no doubt that the national reputation which he has built in the area of tennis is a real factor
in the decision of any outstanding tennis player to attend Davidson.

Coach Harry Fogleman has changed Davidson's tennis picture. He is recruiting some of the more outstanding tennis players in the
country (he already has four boys who have paid their fees for next year). He is continually building his schedule
so that it will include better and more diversified opponents. And he has helped to put the name of Davidson
College before the eyes of a great many tennis fans in the South. He has accomplished these changes not with
pleas for athletic scholarships (although I imagine he would take a couple) but through the use of the material things
which he has to draw from—the school, the facilities, his own ability, and some hard work.

Tennis is a minor sport at Davidson. But Fogleman said, “I believe you can promote anything if you believe in
it and can back it up.” And from all indications these are not merely idle words. Only time will tell
just how well Coach Fogleman can promote tennis at Davidson. I think Coach Fogleman deserves this time and I think
in the very near future, tennis will occupy a very exciting part of Davidson’s athletics—especially the spring part.

Golf Team Places Strong Second to VPI In Conference Tourney

Wednesday, May 8, Davidson's golf team finished with a rush to take second place, four strokes back of VPI in
the Southern Conference Golf Tournament held at the The tournament began Tuesday and at the end of the first round,
George Washington University was in first place with a score of 310. Davidson was in fourth place, nine strokes back
of the leader, and the outcome was in serious doubt with the first six teams all within twelve points of
George Washington.

The outcome of the tournament was not decided until the final few holes Wednesday afternoon. But after thirty-six holes, VPI
emerged with the low score of 624, followed by Davidson with 628, George Washington with 636, West Virginia with 639,
William and Mary with 643, VMI with 645, The Citadel with 651, and Furman with 658. Low man in this

IMAC Drops Two Sports; Softball To End Next Week

Wednesday night the year's newly-elected Intramural Athletic Council met to decide the fate of some of this year’s loose ends—golf,
volleyball, and handball. Golf, the recent addition to the IMAC agenda, has been dropped. Volleyball has also been eliminated from
this year's calendar, but the handball standings will be tabulated after this year's results are compiled next week.

IMAC President Sammy Going announced at the meeting that all handball results not in his hands by Thursday would be
tallied as forfeits for both teams. Because the Mooresville greens are in severe need of repair, the IMAC has cancelled
its proposed golf tournament. Tentative plans call for a tournament to be played in the fall next year.

As a result of the forced elimination of two sports, this year’s IMAC trophy will be awarded on the basis
of only six sports: flickerball, basketball, track, wrestling, swimming, softball, and handball. Under further business, it was agreed that officiating
for next year’s flickerball season will be conducted on the same basis as basketball was this past season. The IMAC
will select its officials from a list of those interested prospects submitted by its representatives.

Going also announced the institution of a new policy regarding the required turn-in procedure for scores of all events. All
scores for a week running Thursday to Wednesday must be turned in by representatives to an IMAC officer not later
than Wednesday night. Failure to do so will result in loss of points for the fraternity.

Seniors Vie With Faculty Wednesday
BY DENNY PHILLIPS

On Wednesday, May 15, the Class of '63 will receive a final send-off from the faculty in the form of
the annual Senior-Faculty Field Day. The Field Day will begin at 1:30 when the golf foursomes tee off at the
Mooresville Country Club. Meanwhile the hardier spirits of the faculty will attempt a rousing game of tennis, with the first
matches beginning at 2 o'clock.

A volleyball game was originally scheduled but Coach Whittle vetoed the idea, feeling that it would be too much for
the faculty, as the big event, the exciting and fearsome softball game begins promptly at 4 p.m. on the baseball
diamond.

Although senior class president John Killian felt the seniors and faculty were fairly evenly matched, Coach Whittle was confident that
the faculty could win the golf matches and softball game.

Dunes Club in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. The competition in the Southern Conference was led by Bill Etheridge of The
Citadel, who shot 70-76 for a two-round total of 146. He was followed by Bob Murphy of George Washington, who
finished with a total of 151. Mims Rogers led Davidson with a first round of 79 and a second round
of 75 for a total of 154. He was followed by Tom Romoda with a 155, Captain Frank McPhillips with
a 159, and Macky McClelland with a 160.

Coach Tom Scott commented that except for a few bad holes in the opening round, Davidson could have well won
the tournament. He pointed out that they shot two 75's and a pair of 78's to give defending champion VPI
a run down to the final wire. The tournament marked the end of this year’s golf season, which saw Davidson
post a 4-0 conference record and finish second at Myrtle Beach. Coach Scott, obviously happy with his team's performance, summed
it up in these words: “I was satisfied with this season's record and really proud of the way the boys
came back the second day of the tournament.”

As host of the tournament, Davidson and Dr. Scott were responsible for all of the many details that go into
running a tournament of this size. As an added attraction to the competition, Davidson alumnus John Belk of Charlotte gave
a dinner Tuesday night at the Dunes Club for the sixty coaches and players who were here for the tournament.
With good food, good weather, and good golf, only four strokes prevented the tournament from being a complete success for
Davidson.

**Baseballers Divide Two Doubleheaders**

BY FORREST ROLES, Davidsonian Sports Writer

Despite brilliant pitching, Davidson’s baseball team managed only a split in their four-game northern swing last week. The ‘Cats dropped
two to Richmond 2-1 and 2-0, but won two from George Washington 7-5 and 13-5.

In the first game at Richmond on Saturday, Tom Hamilton threw a brilliant six-hitter at the Spiders but still lost
2-1. He gave up Richmond's first run in the third inning on a single, a stolen base, a sacrifice, and
a passed ball. Davidson tied it up in the seventh on Don Davidson's triple and an error. Richmond picked up
the winning run in the bottom of the seventh on a perfectly executed squeeze play. Earl Cole suffered the same
non-support in the nightcap as the ‘Cats got only four hits. Richmond’s runs were both scored in the fifth on
a walk, two singles, and an error. The two runs held up for Richmond’s 2-0 victory.

The next Monday, though, the ‘Cats regained their hitting eyes as they banged out 18 hits in a doubleheader at
George Washington. The dual win lifted the ‘Cats out of the Southern Conference cellar, raising their record to 4-10. In
the first game, Barry Teague pitched like a major league prospect. For 4⅔ innings he had a no-hitter, but at
that time the roof fell in on him. The next batter reached first base on a scratch single. Teague struck
out the next two for his 10th and 11th strikeouts, but the last batter reached first when catcher Charlie Marcon
dropped the third strike. Teague then watched as the next two men were safe on errors. Understandably shaken, Teague walked
the next man, and Coach Tom Stevens jerked him. Before Earl Cole could retire the side, the Colonials had tied
the score 4-4. With this score, the game went into extra innings.

In the top of the ninth, the ‘Cats staged a three-run rally to win the game. After one was out,
pitcher Cole singled to left. Tom Hamilton singled to right and Tom Tuttle's fourth hit of the game, an infield
single, loaded the bases. After Lance Walker had popped up, Rick Smyre cleaned the sacks with a triple to center.
Cole survived a shaky bottom of the ninth to come out with the 7-5 win.

In the second game, the ‘Cats wasted no time jumping off to an almost insurmountable lead by scoring nine runs
in the first inning. The big blow was Rick Smyre’s bases-loaded triple, giving him a total of eight runs batted
in for the day. Davidson's starting pitcher Dave Johnson fared better than George Washington's. Until the final inning, he had
given up but one run on two hits. In the seventh, though, he walked three men, one with the bases
loaded. After a single and a two-base error by centerfielder Tom Hamilton had scored three runs, Coach Stevens put in
Phil Squire, who retired the side without further damage, preserving the ‘Cats' 13-5 win.

Today the ‘Cats started their final series of the season against Rollins. Coach Stevens planned to start Barry Teague today
and Tom Hamilton on Saturday. Rollins subsidizes its baseball program and has always proven to be a tough opponent. These
should be two good games.

**Respectable Fifth In Conference Tennis Play**

The Davidson College tennis team captured fifth place in the Southern Conference tournament held in Washington, D.C., this past Monday,
Tuesday, and Wednesday. Last year the ‘Cat netters finished in seventh place. George Washington won the three-day affair by one
point over The Citadel. One of the best matches of the tourney was between Davidson Captain Bobby Austell and Stuart
Levi of The Citadel in the semi-finals. Levi took Austell in straight sets, 10-8 and 6-4; however, the match lasted
for two hours and 58 minutes before the Citadel ace subdued Austell. Senior Bill Backlund, seeded fourth in the number
five singles, was the only other Davidson netter to make the semi-finals; he fell to Bob Morgan of The Citadel
in straight sets.

Other Wildcat netmen making the trip were Gene McCutcheon, Johnny Ariail, Frank Bumgardner, and Bill Shutt. Shutt joined Austell in
the number one doubles; they were seeded fourth for the tournament. The doubles team of Backlund and Bumgardner was seeded
third in the number three doubles.

Before heading to Washington, the local racquet-men fell to a powerful Duke squad, 9-0. The Wildkittens, however, tripped the previously
undefeated Duke freshman team 7-2. Woody Cleveland, Dick Hurd, David Meschan, Jack Goodykoontz, and Jeff Frank all won their singles
matches for the Frosh netters.

Davidson may play host to a second tournament next year. The Southern Conference Tennis coaches unanimously proposed that the tournament
for next year be held at Davidson; this has to be approved by the Athletic Directors of the Conference. The
varsity closes its 1963 season here tomorrow against non-conference foe, East Carolina. Today, the Freshman netters met the Charlotte Tennis
Club, which beat Furman last week 5-4; Furman captured third in the Conference tourney.
