Women’s Basketball (continued)
Notes: Monica Laune ’10 tallied 15 points, five rebounds, three assists, and two steals in the Wildcats’ impressive 68-50 win
at Georgia Southern on Monday night.

Chattanooga and Charleston improved the defense, as “most teams in the SoCon are giving up 70-80 [points] on those same
teams,” Watts said. “Our young team is beginning to understand the importance of changing up defenses and the value of
boxing out.” Thompson exhibited her fair share of boxing out, snagging 12 boards to double up her 10 points in
the stat book. Laune continued her good offensive streak with 15 points, and Paquette notched 11 to round out the
offensive highlights.

As both wins and losses suggest, balance remains the Davidson advantage this season. The squad boasts a solid bench, unprecedented
depth, and well-distributed talent. “In fact, we have had seven different starting line-ups due to the depth of our bench,”
Watts said. “We have the ability to start three bigs — Sophia, Kristen & Julia or we can start ‘speediest’
- Barbara, Alex, Chloe & Katrin.”

Facing threats both inside the key and out, the Wildcats’ “opponents are forced to adjust to our players, or run
the chance of being totally outsized or being a step behind us,” Watts said. As this year’s squad solidifies team
presence, it poses a challenge to even the best individual players in the Southern Conference. With just over a month
in the regular season left, Davidson sits in a three-way tie for second place with Samford and College of Charleston.
As Chattanooga holds the top spot, the competition simmers for some blazing hot rematches in the coming weeks.
