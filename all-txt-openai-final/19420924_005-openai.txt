Mural Of Old Davidson Quadrangle Now Holds Proper Place In Grey Library

A mural painting, which is a gift of the Class of 1941, was placed in its proper place in the Davidsoniana Room of Grey Memorial Library. This painting is set in the original Davidson College Quadrangle. As the chill winds of late September, many changes on the campus are reflected in this valuable painting. The Literary societies remain, but the Chapel has been changed. The name “Shearer Hall” given this building (the college at that time) in honor of his wife, Lizzie Shearer, still stands under the title of Shearer Hall. The spirit of the Summer school students was kept up well above par. Watermelon cuttings, swimming parties, and picnics at Harris Lake, as well as a series of musical entertainments, added another nickname to Shaw Smith’s long string, “Music Under the Stars.” Overshadowing the picnics and parties at Harris Lake was the never-to-be-forgotten mule and wagon hayride. One particularly warm summer, six wagons, laden with laughter, were many friendships formed, and the students still survive. The program opened with prayers and a solo by Buddy Wells of the Junior class. This was followed by the sermon by Rev. Carl Pritchett, pastor of the Watson Presbyterian Church, preached at Davidson’s first Sunday evening Vesper Service in Chamber’s auditorium on Sept. 20. Dr. Cunningham presided at the service and introduced the speaker. The sermon was entitled “He Is Able.” Both the title and the text were taken from Paul’s first letter to Timothy. At the time that this letter was written, Paul was in prison. This text showed Paul’s faith in God even when his life was in danger. Now that many students may soon be in danger of death in the war, Mr. Pritchett reminded them that they must have some of Paul’s faith in God.
