THE DAVIDSONIAN, JANUARY 19, 1928

Intrepid Dowager: Do you know my daughter, May?
Rake: Thanks for the tip.
—Ohio State Sun Dial.

Sometimes the only thing a man gets out of college is himself.
—Minn. Ski-U-Mah.

She: What did Shakespeare mean when he said, “The evil that men do lives after them”?
He: You must remember, dear, that statistics show that most men die before their wives.
—Reserve Red Cat.

Now comes the story of the absent-minded professor who rolled his collar under the dresser and waited for it.

After eloping, a couple stood at the front door of the preacher's house. “I’m going to church services now,” he told them. “Come on and I'll marry you there.”
After delivering a short sermon at the church, the preacher said, “If there is anyone who would like to be married, please come forward.” Fifteen women and four men responded to the call.
—Okla. Whirlwind.

“What kind of tobacco are you smoking, Bob?”
“I didn’t ask him.”
—Blue Dragon.

Phurst: Did you hear that Joe Soak made an unsuccessful attempt at suicide?
Psecond: So he didn’t die?
Phurst: He died all right, but he drank himself to death, and the coroner’s jury found his death due to natural causes.
—Cornell Widow.

“How long have you been in Florida?”
“So long that I’ve spent all my money.”
“We've been here a week too.”
—C.C. N. Y. Mercury.

So the absent-minded professor opened up his bed and jumped out the window.
—Cornell Widow.

“Lizzie returned from the date.”
“Well?” said Becky, smiling.
“He must be a college man,” retorted our heroine. “He not only drank the whole quart without smelling of it, but he also ate the darned bottle.”
—Goblin.

DO YOU KNOW THE MAN WHO—?
On board ship is always organizing deck games, hat pools, smokers, and gymkhanas? Sits behind you at the theater and discloses the entire plot of the play? At a dinner when you are dreaming of Venice over your coffee, forces you to your feet and presents you as the Life of the Party? Calls you by your first name two minutes after he has met you? Greets you by walloping you a clout on the back? Seizes you by the lapel of your coat and attempts to impress his point by poking you in the collar bone with his forefinger? Always selects the wrong seat at the theater and causes a big scene between the usheress and the person holding the right ticket? Disturbs your slumbers on a train by shrieking: “All the finest candy”? Smokes three-for-a-nickel cigars? Always knows the one remedy for indigestion, how to beat the house at roulette, and the address of the best bootlegger in town? Knows the capital of every state in the Union and insists upon telling them all to you? Goes to your funeral just for the drive?
—PARCHER

Clever Clara declares that people who spend over a million a year only want to give the impression that they have money.
—Princeton Tiger.

“He's a bootlegger’s assistant, Your Honor.”
“What's the charge?”
“Thriving while under the influence of intoxicating liquors.”
—Pitt Panther.

“Too bad Shakespeare wasn’t born in London.”
“Why so?”
“I said he was, on that exam.”
—Blue Dragon.

It was a common characteristic of the heroine in the mid-Victorian novel to blush furiously—today she swears furiously.
—Notre Dame Juggler.

Mother—“Oswald, you should never do anything which you would be ashamed for the whole world to see.”
Oswald—“Hooray! I won't have to take any more baths.”
—Oklahoma Whirlwind.
