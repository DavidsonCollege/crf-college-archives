Roommate you'll actually like

Trying to stretch dollars when you're computer shopping doesn’t mean you’re willing to make sacrifices. For further information visit Computer Services Center.

Apple introduces the Macintosh Classic.

If you’re willing to make sacrifices, you should consider the affordable Macintosh Classic. It has everything you need, including a monitor, mouse, and system software already installed. And, thanks to the Macintosh computer's legendary ease of use, you'll be up and running in no time.

Like every Macintosh, the Classic can run thousands of available applications that all work in the same, consistent way—so once you've learned one program, you're well on your way to learning them all. And this is one cheap roommate that doesn’t have trouble sharing.

The Apple® SuperDrive—standard equipment with every Macintosh—reads from and writes to Macintosh, MS-DOS, OS/2, and Apple II floppy disks, which means you can share information with someone who uses a different type of computer.

See the Macintosh Classic for yourself. It'll change your mind about cheap roommates.

For further information, contact Lydia Lorenzin at Ext. 2432.

The power to be your best.
