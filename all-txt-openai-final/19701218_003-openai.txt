Mills Gracious Despite Defeat
By ERNIE SHIPE

To talk to Lewis Mills you would never guess his Richmond Spiders walked away from Johnston Gym a loser Tuesday night. Although Richmond is 1-5 for the season, he constantly radiated enthusiasm. He even got the biggest ovation of the entire game when he followed the Spiders into the gym.

No one on his ball club played what you might call an outstanding game in their 67-54 loss. This is probably why you see Mills' face decorating Richmond basketball brochures instead of any member of his ball club. Even in losing the other night, the baldish young coach doesn't count his Spiders out of the conference race.

"Davidson, East Carolina, and Furman seem to be the front runners now," Mills said, "but don’t count us out. We've got a young ball club and we're looking forward to January when we should be getting pretty tough."

"I have a lot of respect for Coach Holland and his boys," he added. "They looked good against us tonight and should have a fine season."

Mills could have had an easy alibi for his loss to the 'Cats but scoffed it off. Stan Ryfinski, the Spiders' second scorer, missed the contest because of the flu. "Of course we missed Stan, but he has been alternating in the starting lineup with John Welch."

Mills felt his club’s poor ball handling hurt them in the loss. The Spiders committed 25 floor mistakes. The Spiders were in striking distance of the 'Cats through nearly all of the forty minutes. At half they only trailed 32-27 after leading the Wildcats for the first twelve minutes of the ball game. Davidson slowly built their lead in the opening minutes of the second half, but the Spiders rallied with 7:15 left to cut the lead to 50-47. The Wildcats, however, rallied to outscore the Spiders 17-7 in the closing seven minutes.

Joe Sutter ignited the second half surge. After being held to eight points in the first half he finished strong, ending the evening with 22. His showing brought his season average to 20.3. The win brought the Wildcats' conference record to 2-0 and gave them a 3-0 mark overall.

Even though the Wildcats have a firm hold on the conference lead, the picture seems ever brighter considering what the Wildkittens did to Gaston College in the preliminary. The freshmen exploded for 62 points in the second half to outscore Gaston, 117-101. It was the first time either of the Davidson teams have broken the century mark. John Falconi, Paul Wagner, and Steve Gadaire did most of the damage. Falconi was good for 32 points while Wagner and Gadaire hit 27 and 24 respectively.

Holland Remains Optimist
By JOE EARLE
Asst. Sports Editor

Terry Holland is very optimistic about this year's basketball season. After rolling over both Mercer and East Carolina, a team picked by some to challenge Davidson's traditional superiority in the Southern Conference, Holland says he sees no reason why the 'Cats should not bring the conference crown back to Davidson. Holland also feels that the 'Cats should maintain their fourth consecutive twenty-win season.

Perhaps this seems a brash prediction for a team that is missing two starters of the calibre of Brian Adrian and Eric Minkin, but Holland is optimistic. Minkin played for a short period during the Mercer game and Adrian is expected back by the beginning of the Christmas tournament, but Holland says players who have played in the first games have earned their starting positions.

"The pressure is now on SC Adopts At Winter"

In a meeting last week the Southern Conferenceset up limitations on grant-in-aids for both football and basketball. At the three-day meeting, school and conference representatives set limits of 100 football grants and 20 basketball grants to begin at the start of the 1973-74 academic year. According to Athletic Director Tom Scott, the ruling states that each partial grant will count as one grant. Scott explained that Davidson wanted to have the football limitation set at 75. Presently, Davidson gives 52 football and 18 basketball grants. Many athletes, however, are on partial grants. Scott felt the decision could hurt Davidson as other schools with more resources could give 100 grants while Davidson could only hope to reach 75. Presently, the raising of funds for football scholarships is headed by the Wildcat Club. Steve Heckard, who is heading the drive, said that the drive for Adrian and Minkin to take their positions back from the present players, “They have proved themselves under pressure, and are a fine team.”

“Our biggest problem is that we are slow,” he said. “When we play, we have to get ahead early in the game and maintain the lead, for if we get far behind I'm not sure we'd be able to play catch-up ball.”

The ‘Cats have a full schedule ahead of them during the holidays, with a total of seven games to be played. After tackling Georgia and North Carolina State, they will play in the Charlotte Invitational Tournament against Boston, La Salle, and Georgia. After the tournament, the ‘Cats square off against William and Mary and Furman, two more teams forecasted to challenge the conference title, and West Virginia. Holland said he felt that West Virginia would be one of the key games of the season. “West Virginia has averaged over a hundred points a game,” he said, “and that game on Jan. 9 should be an exciting as well as an important contest for us.”

Holland stressed West Virginia's record thus far in the season, particularly their close loss to highly regarded Kentucky, and expressed desire for students to return to see that game in the Coliseum. Holland was impressed with the play of the team in the first two games. “Although we have no really tall men, we have good overall height,” he commented, “and this forces us to work to the free inside man.”

“The fact that we have so many free throws indicates that we are getting inside,” he said. The Wildcats have done well from the foul line, hitting 74 percent during the Mercer game.

He wasn't able to tell whether the Wildcat Club would reach their goal of $150,000 until January. He explained that most of the school's large donors give at the end of the year. The club has until January 1 to reach their goal.
