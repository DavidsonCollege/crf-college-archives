**‘Hasn’t Been Exactly Easy’**

Being a Negro at Davidson is a difficult role which makes the black student keenly aware of his blackness. This was the opinion expressed by three of Davidson's five black students, as they gathered in a dormitory room labeled “The Soul Room" and talked about their problems over the music of Claudine and The Four Tops.

“It hasn't been exactly easy,” said senior Leslie Brown, who with classmate Wayne Crumwell became the first American Negro students to enroll at Davidson. “You realize just how different you are.” Crumwell and sophomore Calvin Murphy agreed. “Since you are different from most of the students,” Crumwell said, “it is hard to identify with large sections of Davidson student life.”

The difference is deeper than skin color, they said. Soon the black Davidson student realizes that he has different tastes in music, food, entertainment, and thought patterns from his fellow students. So to bridge these differences, the black student tries to become a white man in his way of life. But, they said, he soon finds this is impossible, and as a defense mechanism, he falls back on his blackness.

“When I came here,” Murphy said, “I wanted to be identified as a Davidson College student. Now I want to be identified as a black Davidson College student.”

“You can't integrate fully,” Crumwell said, “here or anywhere else. What good is integrating if the feeling behind it is not real?”

Once the Negro student has developed this sense of uniqueness, his tendency is to want to “strike out” against the white world, they added. This feeling displays itself, they said, in various forms, ranging from passive distaste to more radical approaches.

Brown and Crumwell said they felt this realization developing during their sophomore and junior years. Brown said the determining factor in his realization was a PRAM trip to South America, where he said he experienced freedom “like I’ve never felt it before.”

One of the major problems of the Davidson Negro is social life. Few of the white girls’ schools in the area have more than one or two Negroes in their student bodies, and as a result, black freshmen seldom have dates at mixers. Since all the black students are on scholarships, none of them have cars to drive to predominantly Negro schools in the area.

But the problem of social contact is more complex than this. Because of the difference in attitudes and background, Negroes and whites here have little common ground for friendships and meaningful social relations, the black students said. “Both races have their hang-ups,” Crumwell said. “The Negroes are suspicious of white peoples’ motives and the whites have this sense of superiority that is part of their heritage. Therefore, it's almost impossible to develop real friendships (between whites and blacks).”

All agreed that life was gradually becoming easier for Davidson's Negro students, and that the college and student body have tried to create a more natural environment for Negroes. Two Negroes have pledged social fraternities and black students are members of several student committees and organizations.

But the black students feel there is room for improvement. “You'll never get a Negro to come here and enjoy it,” Brown said, “unless you have a larger Negro student body. Sometimes we like to get away from white students and be with our brothers.”

Brown suggested that in order to enroll more Negroes, Davidson adopt Yale University’s system of recruiting. Yale tutors Negro students on campus for a year before enrolling them as freshmen. This, Brown said, is necessary because of the poor quality of Negro secondary schools.

Both Brown and Crumwell hesitated in saying whether or not they would return to Davidson. Brown said he would not, while Crumwell, though not enthusiastic, said he would unless he received a better offer. “I’m basically materialistic,” he quipped.

Davidson is interested in attracting good students, regardless of race, according to Director of Admissions H. Edmunds White in a recent outline of policy on the admission of Negroes. White told THE DAVIDSONIAN that the admissions committee generally accepts students “regardless of race.”

SENIOR LESLIE BROWN ... “Never get a Negro to enjoy it.”Davidson, says White, receives more Negro applications each year than the number who eventually enroll. This trend has been consistent since the first years of Davidson's integration. The decision to desegregate Davidson came in the academic year 1961-62 when the trustees decided to admit a Congolese student for the fall of 1962. The first American Negroes enrolled two years later. Since 1964, the number of Negro applications has ranged from four to 12, but usually runs between four and seven, according to White. White said that he could not remember how many Negroes applied to enter Davidson with the class of 1971, but he pointed out that only one of the three Negroes who were accepted actually enrolled. In each of the previous three years, two students had enrolled, White said. But he asserted, “There certainly is no quota—either a maximum or a minimum.”

White said some attempt is made to recruit qualified Negro students. The admissions office tries to coordinate staff visits to predominantly Negro high schools with the recruiting efforts of Davidson students and alumni. Another factor which leads to the small number of Negro applicants is the fact that virtually no applications are received from Negroes outside of the North Carolina area. Almost all Negro applications have been from South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia. White said that the federal government is encouraging institutions of higher education to recruit qualified applicants from disadvantaged backgrounds through its Educational Opportunity Grant Program. This, he said, affects the situation of the Negro to some extent, but he emphasized that it is college policy to provide financial aid equal to need for any student—regardless of race. “We guarantee this, and intend to follow through on it,” he said.

Recruiters Must Try For Negroes

ED NOTE: This is condensed from an article in “The Chronicle of Higher Education.”

Admissions directors who claim they cannot enroll qualified Negro candidates simply have not been trying, according to the admissions director of a Northeastern University. “People who say ‘Gee, we just can't seem to find qualified candidates’ just haven't been out looking,” said John C. Hoy, dean of admissions at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn. In an article in the Nov. 8 issue of “The Chronicle of Higher Education,” Hoy said Wesleyan raised the number of Negroes in its freshman class from two in 1964 to 39 in 1967. Wesleyan provides stipends of between $2,500 and $3,000 for most Negro students, or nearly all of their fees for the year. The university also provides remedial tutoring in English, writing, and foreign languages for Negro students who need it, he said.

Hoy said he often picks up students during tours for the National Achievement Scholarship Program and visits with Upward Bound classes, which are government-sponsored classes for promising but indigent students. He often dips into the deepest parts of the South—Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi—for applicants. A list of successful Negro graduates of Wesleyan shows a heavy concentration in fields of law and education. Hoy said he feels the university benefits from the presence of minority students. Several of them accompany recruiters on visits to high schools. “The discussion with high school students always goes better when they’re along,” he said. “They answer questions of the student.”

He added that Negro students make the university a more interesting place. “You don't know what you have on your hands until you get nearly 10 percent of your students coming from this group. Their ability to contribute begins to come through. Until then they're too much of a minority to show what they're made of.”

“When you have only a handful of Negro students, they're usually either quiet and conforming, or they're taking a very extreme position. The white students who know them assume theirs is the position of all Negroes,” he said. “With more than 100 minority group kids on this campus now, we have a real richness of political attitude. It ranges from the very militant, black nationalist, Africa-oriented guy and the black nationalist America-oriented guy to the extreme of some guys who say ‘What's the problem? I'm here to get an education.’”

“You get kids organizing black study groups and Afro-American societies and soul sessions. There are enough guys to support a diversity of options to the Negro problem.”

Hoy said he believes it is so important to recruit Negro students that he is willing to accept academic risks in order to get them. “We look for interesting kids that may have had some academic difficulty.” He added he does not believe institutions with programs like his deserve special acclaim. The investment made by universities in minority students will be repaid many times, he said. “Over 20 years these alumni will far outweigh their numbers in contributions to society and as a reflection on their institution.”
