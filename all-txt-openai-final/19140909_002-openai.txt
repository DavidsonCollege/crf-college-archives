### A BIT OF HISTORY

Seventy-seven years ago, when Martin Van Buren was President, and the South was in the early prosperous days of the plantation, a cornerstone was laid in a great wide field in the county of Mecklenburg, N.C. The donor of the gift, which was to perpetuate his name by a man of Irish lineage and thought, was Maxwell Chambers. A little colony of students gathered at the college of which this great building was the center, and with the trees which were set up about it then, grew up through the progress of years a number of college ways and college traditions.

The college met the war fearlessly and heroically, sending some of its best to the front, and when it was over, bent its energies to the reconstruction of Christian education in the South. A growth, slow, it is true, but steady, went on. In the eighties and nineties, the increased prosperity in the South brought increased opportunities to seek an education, and the enrollment increased from year to year by leaps and bounds, and within the last ten years, with the sympathy and help of loyal friends, and the adamant support of faithful alumni, it has climbed to the 330 mark, yet with quality rather than quantity as its motto.

Up through the three-quarters of a century past has gone the thought and life-work of scores of professors, the untiring energies of many a President, the most fruitful powers of thousands of students that have attended it. To this college of memorable and proud past comes this year one hundred and twenty new men. It would not be natural if during the years gone there had not developed traditions peculiar to Davidson. Some have been abolished as useless and hurtful. But to the new men who will soon all be our new friends, we would urge this word: When you are inclined to think that special attention is being paid to you, that you have done the college a tremendous favor by coming, that you are going to be one of the shining lights of your class, and that you can walk with your feet on the ground, but your head above Chambers, remember that Davidson is older than you are, that you are about the three thousand, seven hundred and fifty-third.

### FORWARD, MARCH!

A campus in the summer is like a beautiful corpse. The buildings, the halls, the trees, the walks, everything is still there, stretched out over the campus in quiet repose, but the life is gone. It is the college, but not the college. It is the same place, but not the same place. No man can fail to notice it. Yet nothing could be more natural. We commonly say that the college makes men. Mere buildings do not. A spacious, green campus might be a delight to the eye, but it lays no mighty grip upon a man. All the equipment in the world would not. Principles, ideas, knowledge, and truth, these embodied in the living personalities of professors and fellow-students are the molding influences of college life. The college makes men, true, but not a dead college of mere elaborate equipment and fine campus. When its pulse throbs with active, enthusiastic, purposeful men, then it is a maker and changer of men.

And so not only does the college make men. We are more than the lower formations of life, which respond instantly to very little influence, but exert none. We get, but we also give. Just as truly as the college is making us, and shaping our ideas and purposes, are we making the college, and determining what its purpose shall be and what it shall stand for. There is a continual influence both ways. Now that the campus has shaken off its summer grave clothes, and the college is alive once more, it cannot stand still. It must move in some direction. The trite saying that a college is starting out upon the best year of its history has become a joke, but the sentence has been well-worn only because it should be well true. Every year ought to be the best to that time.“Forward, march!” is the cry of the German generals as they are pressing their soldiers toward Paris. Theirs is a march of destruction. Ours is to be a march this year of construction. We have a beautiful campus, let us make it more beautiful; we have a good student body, let us make it better; we have good athletics, good literary work, a good spirit prevailing, let us make them all better. Professors and students have noticed a new feeling this year. There is more earnestness, more purpose, more determination to make everything count than ever before. There is an air of hopefulness and courage with regard to every phase of college work. It behooves us to encourage this fine spirit at the beginning. It should grow during the year. We have constantly talked in longing terms of the Davidson classes and Davidson teams and Davidson spirit that used to be once. The old standard is good only as a mark beyond which to reach in the future. Talk of the Davidson classes and teams and spirit and success that are to be. When our ideals become part of us, they will begin to be realized. “Forward” in every department, class, team, this year! In the society work, in scholastic standing, in athletic success, in character growth, let progress, steady, sure, and forward be the motto of every student that has been here. 

NEW HANDBOOK READY SOON

The new Y. M. C. A. Handbook has gone to press and will be ready for distribution by the first of next week. This handbook contains much interesting information about the organizations of the college, athletic records, yells and songs, the year’s calendar, a directory of the students, and many other interesting things. The Publication Committee has worked hard on this year’s copy. Some new material is included, the old has been revised, and an attractive and useful little booklet is anticipated. A copy is given free to every student.

Mayor Sloan is building a new grocery store in town. It will be run by Mr. Elliot, who has lately moved with his family into the house occupied by Dr. Arbuckle last year.

A new regulation has been passed at Princeton relieving all Juniors and Seniors of high scholastic standing from compulsory attendance upon their class exercises. It is hoped that this will be an incentive to study and will develop self-control in the upper classmen.
