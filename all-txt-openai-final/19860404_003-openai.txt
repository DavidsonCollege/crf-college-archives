Headlining the news for the week of March 26 - April 2:

**International Superpower news** — On Saturday, the Reagan administration rejected a Soviet offer to discuss a ban on nuclear testing,
suggesting instead that the Soviets accept better verification requirements that could lead to U.S. ratification of two existing test treaties;
to date, there has been no Soviet response to the offer. Secretary of State George Schultz said on Sunday that
the U.S. and U.S.S.R. will not “go anywhere” until both sides quit conducting their diplomacy in public. In other developments,
the State Department said Saturday that U.S. officials in Moscow have talked to Svetlana Alliluyeva, daughter of late Soviet leader

expected to launch its first space shuttle at the end of this year or early next year. Finally, Soviet schoolgirl

In South Africa, 30 people were killed last Wednesday in one of the bloodiest days in over a year of
unrest. Earlier in the week, anti-apartheid black community leaders decided to drop school boycotts and adopt a broader strategy of
black consumer boycotts, rent strikes, and possibly a general strike. In other news, making an overt show of support for
the outlawed Communist Party, more than 20,000 blacks defied government bans on political meetings and gathered in Port Elizabeth for

Ortega said Sunday that he would not talk with contra leaders but would be willing to negotiate with the U.S.
and the “chief of the contras,” which is President Reagan.

**Asian news** — Making his first appearance since his deposition by Corazon Aquino as president of the Philippines, Ferdinand Marcos
called the current government of the Philippines a “dictatorship” and said he still considered himself the rightful president. Marcos also
hinted that he may return to the Philippines. In South Korea, protesting against U.S. support for President Chun Doo Wan
and demanding democratic elections, thousands staged the largest anti-government demonstration in six years.

In the Middle East, after 75 hours of defying Libya, U.S. Navy ships pulled out of the Gulf of Sidra,
declaring the confrontation a “glittering victory.” A Newsweek magazine poll reported that 75 percent of Americans believe the U.S. was
justified in attacking Libyan ships and a radar site. Unidentified sources reported on Tuesday that Egypt was originally part of
a U.S. plan to invade Libya; the Reagan administration has denied the report. Soviet leader Gorbachev accused the U.S. of
conducting a “punitive operation conceived and planned in advance” against Libya and proposed talks on the withdrawal of U.S. and
Soviet fleets from the Mediterranean and urged a conference on Mediterranean security.

plans; Britain was the first U.S. ally to endorse the program, and Israel, Italy, and Japan are expected to join.
In England, the historic British Hampton Court Palace was severely damaged by fire. Finally, in his Easter address to over
200,000 gathered in Rome’s St. Peter’s Square, Pope John Paul II denounced terrorism, torture, war, and abortion.

In other international news: On Wednesday, a TWA Boeing 727 was forced to make an emergency landing in Athens after
a bomb believed to be located in the passenger compartment exploded, killing four Americans; a small Arab terrorist group is

to write an amendment to the Constitution requiring a balanced budget. Prompted by growing concern over falling oil prices, which
hit an eight-year low of under $10 a barrel on Wednesday, Vice-President George Bush left for Saudi Arabia on Friday
to discuss the unstable situation. Fueled by dry, hot weather, fire continues to plague 12 Southeastern and Midwestern states.

Last Thursday, the Department of Transportation said that 21 states already having the 21 drinking age law must make their

In the realm of research and statistics, the following findings were released this past week: The National Center for Health
Statistics revealed that the marriage rate for 1985 was the lowest in eight years with divorces increasing; however, the study
said that Americans were still about twice as likely to get married than divorced. Extensive lung damage among chronic marijuana
smokers is just one of the findings cited by a research review made by the Haight-Ashbury Drug Clinic; the study
was prompted by concern over the rising potency of marijuana on the market today (seven percent THC content as compared
to 0.5 percent - 1 percent in 1976). A study in the American Journal of Diseases of Children reported that
smoking and low I.Q. go “hand in hand.” On Monday, a U.S. government study revealed that many violent criminals, including
murderers and rapists, serve less than seven years in prison. The Presidential Commission on Organized Crime reported that organized crime
will cut a typical person's income by nearly $80 a year.

Finally, the Louisville Cardinals defeated the Duke Blue Devils, 72-69, to claim the national college basketball championship.
