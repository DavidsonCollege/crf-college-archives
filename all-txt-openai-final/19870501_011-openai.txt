**Students Against Apartheid urge divestment**
—Kim Williams & Gordon Watkins—

Having studied the draft of the proposed revision of the Statement of Davidson Trustee Endowment Investment Policy, a group of
students concerned about this investment policy asks that you consider the following points. We are opposed to the adoption of
this draft because of the reasons delineated below.

1. The Sullivan Principles no longer function as appropriate criteria for judging the effectiveness of U.S. corporations engaged in South
Africa.
a. Rev. Leon Sullivan, the author of the principles, intends to abandon them on May 31, 1987 because of their
failure to bring about any significant degree of positive change or improvement in the lives of the majority of the
African workers in the country.
b. The Sullivan Principles have not been implemented. For example, the Fifth Principle of the code calls for “increasing the
number of Blacks, Coloureds, and Asians in management and supervisory positions.” Eight and a half years after the introduction of
the code (1986), 95 percent of all managers in signatory corporations were white, while only 2 percent were African.
c. The Fourth Principle of the code calls for the development of training programs to prepare non-whites for supervisory, administrative,
clerical, and technical jobs. Today, 79 percent of the workers being trained for such positions are white. The proportion of
non-white employees involved in these programs has dropped by more than 50 percent since 1984.

2. Several of the signatories of the Sullivan Code help...

During the last few days, I’ve been contemplating how to write a letter to a world which is separated by
more than space. Should I appeal to emotions? Should I use rationale? How could I bridge the gap of the
experience which separates us? At this point, I am still uncertain which direction I should take. Perhaps honesty will guide
me.

Four weeks ago, I arrived in Managua, Nicaragua, a city which continues to reflect the destruction left by the earthquake
of 1973 and the subsequent insurrection of 1979. My initial experiences of travel, hostels, and restaurants allowed me to perceive
the natural beauty of the country. The peaceful sunsets, the volcanic islands, and the $1.50 steak and beer at the
corner restaurant obscured the reality of the daily life of the Nicaraguans. It was only after I settled in Managua
did my own perspective begin to be challenged by the harsh interactions with the people. The 45-minute wait for an
overcrowded bus lost its novelty. The complaints of food shortages and rising prices confronted my experiences of “cheap,” plentiful meals.
The shack neighborhoods stood in direct contradiction to the beauty which surrounded them. The reports of the war broke the
peacefulness which was so easily experienced earlier. It was a clash of two different perspectives which often left me exhausted
and emotionally drained. I began to see Nicaragua through their eyes.

It’s from within this different perspective that I look toward my own country, my home. Often I feel anguish and
guilt for the suffering which we have needlessly caused. Our own ignorance, our lack of outside perspective is pushing Nicaragua
towards more hunger and blood-letting. Yes, the policy of our government is working; the war of low intensity has served
its purpose well. “They Want To Demoralize Us” read today’s headline in the independent newspaper, Nuevo Diario. That is what
is occurring here in Managua, a demoralization. The sense of common determination is being lost in the face of increased
scarcity. They no longer think in unity but rather in finding food for their family, even if it involves working
the black market. So yes, our policy is working. We are winning and they are losing.

Monday I went to a birthday gathering in barrio Bello Horizonte, a middle-class neighborhood in Managua. We were sitting in
a circle; Nicaraguans, a few Cubans, and myself; discussing the crisis of the economy and uncon...

It’s early morning in America. A young fellow rolls yawning out of bed, slides into his favorite torn Levis and
Bruce Springsteen T-shirt, stretches to absorb the sun glowing through his bedroom window, and decides it’s a grand day to
go looking for a job. Scratching his two-day beard, he reads in the morning paper that Honda’s hiring. He glances
at a clock; it reads 7:00 a.m. He grins thinking that he’ll have a job with Honda by noon.

By noontime, he has returned from Honda, jobless. He rationalizes that the Japanese job interviewers would have hired him if
he had worn his Sunday best: untorn Levis and an ironed Bruce Springsteen T-shirt. This young fellow might have been
hired by Honda (chimpanzees someday “might” write Shakespearean sonnets) if he had known what the reader is about to learn:
How to impress Japanese job interviewers.

One should not shake hands with the Japanese job interviewers as if they were wrestling coaches with kung-fu grips. The
Japanese are not enthusiastic handshakers, thereby endearing themselves to Mrs. Manners. However, one should not misinterpret the fine manners of
the Japanese to mean that they lack personal warmth. As soon as possible, the Japanese interviewers desire to get beyond
the applicant’s resume and into the applicant’s character. They are impressed especially when the applicant volunteers to speak sincerely and
in depth about his personality and his family. Japanese interviewers enjoy hearing about an applicant’s big family — the bigger
the better — which they believe indi...Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

cates invaluable team spirit. Many an American has waltzed through a job interview without being asked specific questions about his
professional knowledge. Compared to such a waltz, an interview with the Japanese is an aerobics class. Fred Seitz expected to
waltz a familiar pattern at a familiar tempo in an interview with Japanese engineers at a new Canon plant. Mr.
Seitz turned up his internal metronome when he was asked to take apart and to put back together a cigarette-packing
machine while the Japanese engineers waited with patience and encouragement. The applicant must do what he thinks is humanly impossible:
resist bringing up the topics of wages and options for upward mobility in the company. Although the Japanese interviewers eventually
bring up these topics, they receive noticeably more pleasure from hearing about the applicant’s child and grandmother than they do
from hearing about his financial goals and career aspirations. Japanese interviewers think about discussing wages and upward mobility the way
most Americans think about preserving forests and beaches: What’s the rush? The Japanese interviewers expect, perhaps unrealistically in the American
industrial setting, that after an applicant receives a job from their company he will desire to work with their company
for as long as he is physically and spiritually able. Even if the second half of the interview goes into
double overtime, the applicant should keep his impatient eyes off his watch. The Japanese interviewers will assume, quite reasonably, that
if one watches his timepiece during an interview then he occasionally will stop to watch his timepiece when on the
job.

The a ans to maintain the apartheid system, through sale of equipment to South Africa’s military and security police. Although
they have supposedly “pulled out” of the country, IBM and General Electric continue to supply, through South African license holders,
computers and other equipment that are used by the security police to implement pass laws and other elements of influx
control. General Electric has also aided South Africa in the development of its nuclear industry, even though the government has
refused to sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty and is suspected of having its own nuclear arsenal. Despite its 1986 announcement that
it would no longer sell cars and trucks to the South African military and police, General Motors similarly continues to
supply the repressive apparatus of apartheid through an “independent”

perspective on Nicaragua consciously listening to the Hagler-Leonard fight. One of the Nicaraguans was criticizing the manner in which the
Sandinistas have handled the economy. His words were angry and hard. Finally, he concluded his criticism by saying: “However, the
fact that a congress of a people can get together and vote for whether another people shall live or die
is absurd.”

I have not raised the issues of freedom of press, religion, etc. for a reason. These are structures which are
inherently understood within a closed perspective. Nor have I raised the issue of proletarian exploitation, private property, etc., for these
too are structures of a closed perspective. At issue is not one ideology or another but rather the rights of
a people to live. Finally, in comparison to the reality of the Nicaraguans, my experience here is easy. I have
sacrificed little and in five months I too shall return to Davidson to finish my studies. However, this experience has
violently exposed how closed our perspective is. Only after we accept that other realities exist shall we begin to truly
respect life. I urge you to consider this and if at all possible, come here and experience it for yourself.

How to get a job from a Japanese boss

Toyota-GM plant has no clocks and requires that its employees not wear timepieces. Japanese job interviewers are impressed by an
applicant who is alert and gleaming with kinetic energy. A stoic need not apply. Jim Ballengee, an employee of NEC
America, explains, “It helps to be a busybody in a Japanese factory.” Japanese employers rarely have trouble finding significant tasks
for busybodies to complete. The Japanese routinely rotate workers through different jobs in order to steal workers away from boredom
and to encourage workers to assume more responsibilities. If the Japanese interviewers take a liking to an applicant, they ask
him whether he would be willing, if hired, to change job assignments and to take part in appropriate training programs.
The applicant is hired only if he replies with an affirmative “yes.” Ira Perlman, vice president at Matsushita Electric Corporation
of America, explains that Japanese interviewers understand “yes” to mean “maybe” and “maybe” to mean “the applicant needs to look
elsewhere for a job.”

The Japanese associate quality with cleanliness. At the Honda plant in Marysville, Ohio, Japanese supervisors devote the last fifteen minutes
of every work shift to “housekeeping.” In evaluating a prospective long-term investment in human capital, the Japanese job interviewers often
assume that the quality of the applicant’s workmanship is directly proportional to the cleanliness of his appearance and language. So,
the applicant would do well to lather his body and his vernacular. To jobless Americans who insist on wearing torn
Levis and Bruce Springsteen T-shirts to job interviews with Japanese corporations, I offer as encouragement these words of Emma Jackson,
a spirited black woman who has been making history in Charlotte for 103 years: “It doesn’t matter what you wear.
Just so it’s clean.”
