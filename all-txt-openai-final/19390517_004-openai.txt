**Sideline Delights**  
By ANDY DALE

**A Few Statistics**  
This week rung down the final curtain on sports for the ’Cats for 1938-’39. Looking at the tabulated results of all contests during the year over a couple of columns, we find that Davidson has a percentage of .583 for the year. The frosh track team and the Beester football squad are the only undefeated teams, with the golf team leading varsity athletes by eight wins against one loss. Tennis follows closely with nine for eleven. The quintet had 170 more points than their opposition to lead that bracket, and the Kit tracksters scored 219 more points than their opponents to pace the freshmen. Only one tie game resulted out of 153 contests during the two terms, and that was in soccer.

J. D. Hicks, senior outfielder and hurler, led the willow-wielders on the diamond with 28 safeties out of 64 official trips to bat. He led in singles, with 21, and tied in doubles with Steere, Edmondson, and Hellekson, all of whom had 6. Steere and Niven led in triples with three each. There was a great scarcity of these, only 14 being knocked all season. Hand had two homers to lead the pack. There is no dope on runs batted in, which are very important to any club. Tommy “Short-dog” Yarborough led the frosh hitters with a high .452 mark, Morris being next with .421, and pitcher Lucas third with .355. Owens, Carter, and Smith all hit .300 or over for the season, and should furnish power for next year.

**High Spots And By-Lines**  
Dave Spencer certainly has proved himself a real athlete by winning four numerals this year. Playing in a majority of games, he has not made any of them by slipping in at the last moment of a lost game... Red Telford joins the ranks of the great also as he wins a track letter, his third “D” for the year... Hayseed Thomas, a reliable chunker and .290 hitter, chosen to lead next year’s diamond squad which loses five veterans, but which will pick up some good replacements from the frosh ranks... Ned Iverson leads the tracksters in points for the season with Walker and Sample tied for the second slot... The Phi Gams took away the softball championship for their third straight year and placed three men on the all-frat team... Editor Casali continues to make the all-intramural teams of his own paper...

**Winding Up**  
As we wind up the school year we cannot but hope that the powers that be will feed Felix plenty of spinach this summer so we can have lots of “Davidson Trounces—” headlines next year. We also hope there are lots of good halfbacks, basketball artists, pitchers, hitters, trackmen, and what not in that new assortment of goods due to arrive here next September. And whether or not they bring the athletes, let’s hope they bring some more of that “Wildcat Spirit.” Vacation, you call us!

**Undefeated Kittens Win Over Winston Trackmen**  
Davidson's strongest Freshman track team in years closed its undefeated season on last Thursday with a win over Winston Hi, 62½ to 52½. The clean sweep of the weights and Kitten tracksters made a season, were never in any danger. Dave Spencer was the big gun for the yearlings, scoring firsts in the javelin, 100-yard dash and broad jump, and was nosed out barely for a second in the 220-yard dash. Strandwitz was second scorer for the Frosh with 11 markers to his credit.

**All-Frat Team**  
In recognition of their excellent playing and sportsmanship, the following men were picked to serve on the all-fraternity softball team. This team was picked by Johnny Tice and Junior Alcorn, the men who officiated in the tournament. The Phi Gams, who won the tournament, placed the most men on the all-frat team, three, followed by the Betas and Kappa Sigs with two each.

**Fijis Beat Kappa Sigs In Softball**  
Phi Delts Win Horseshoes; S.A.E.’s And K.A.’s Tie For Second

For the third straight year the Phi Gams annexed the Inter-fraternity softball crown by downing the Kappa Sigs 10-2. The Sig Eps won the consolation tourney by nosing out the Phi Delts 10-9. With Bill Bolin pitching two-hit ball, the Phi Gams never were in danger after the fourth inning when they put together four hits for four runs. They had chalked up two markers in the second on a walk and two hits, and added their final markers in the sixth on four hits and two walks. Bob Johnson led the hitters with a homer and a double in three trips to the plate.

In the other game, the Sig Eps hopped on the offerings of Ned Iverson for seven runs in the first inning and then sat back and protected this lead for the rest of the game. They scored the winning runs in the sixth inning on three hits and a walk. The Phi Delts chalked up two in the first, two in the fifth, and four in the sixth but the Sig Eps’ lead was too much.

**Horseshoe Tourney**  
Top berth in the frat horseshoe tournament was won by the Phi Delts with a record of seven victories and one loss. The S.A.E.'s and K.A.'s tied for second with five wins and three losses. The Betas took third with four and three. Next were the Sig Eps with four victories in eight games, while the Phi Gams were sixth with a record of three and four.

**Cat Trackmen Finish Season**  
The Davidson varsity tracksters completed their 1939 season with a record of three wins and three defeats. Competition included South Carolina, Duke, University of Virginia, Citadel, Virginia Tech, and Maryville. The year started off with an early-season loss just after spring holidays to South Carolina 69 1-3 to 2-3.The 'Cats eked out over Maryville 68 to 62, and then made it two straight by beating V. P. I. 71-55 for the first time in two years. Virginia broke the victory string by overwhelming Davidson 94-31. This was followed by an expected victory over The Citadel 75 1-2 to 50 1-2, and an expected loss to Duke, 88-38. Garnering points in the discus, high jump, broad jump, and javelin, high point man for the season was Ned Iverson, followed closely with a tie between Captain Boo Walker, distance star, and Charlie Sample, ace pole-vaulter and sprinter.

University of New Hampshire riflemen have won 23 matches in 24 starts.

Last week, the Davidson golf team participated in the Southern Conference Intercollegiate Tournament at Pinehurst, coming in third behind Duke and North Carolina. Pittman led the Davidson shotmakers with a 74-79 total of 153, followed closely by Jimmy Cooper with 78-81—159, Charlie Pegram 76-84—160, and Granville Sharpe 85-86—171. Sharpe was, however, handicapped by an illness during the match. Davidson's entire team was handicapped by a thunderstorm which dominated the entire last round for the 'Cats. This state of weather skyrocketed the scores in the last round of play and prevented Davidson from placing higher.

Skip Alexander of Duke was the low score man for the matches with a 76-70 total of 146 to cop medal honors. The entire Duke team averaged better than 75, while the Davidsons averaged around 80. Davidson had a match scheduled with South Carolina last Friday, but the Gamecocks called the match off on account of exams. Completing the present season with eight wins against one loss, the 'Cats placed among the top teams in Dixie.

The “four most valuable students” attending U. S. colleges and universities will be honored by the Elks National Foundation after a special competition.

Davidson Golfers Take Third Place In Tourney

Frosh Defeat Legion 11 to 5

On last Monday afternoon, May 15th, the Freshmen defeated the American Legion Juniors by the score of 11 to 5 in seven innings. The preceding Thursday, May 11th, the Kittens won over Presbyterian Junior College by the score of 8 to 0 for their fourth straight victory. The feature of the Legion Junior game was the close pitching of Ed Lucas, and also his heavy hitting—securing three hits out of four trips to the plate. He allowed only three hits while striking out six, two of these by Riddle, Junior left fielder. The Kittens got off to a fast start, securing 5 runs in the first inning, and then coasting on to an easy victory.

P. J. C. Beaten

In the P. J. C. game on Thursday, the Freshmen were held to six hits, but were able to convert these into eight runs, seven of these in the fourth frame on four hits coupled with one Scottie error. Ed Lucas again pitched masterful ball in allowing his opponents only five hits while striking out five. No Kitten was able to garner over one hit, as the P. J. C. hurlers limited them to six hits. Going through the season with a record of five victories against three losses, the Kittens closed one of the best seasons enjoyed by a Frosh team in recent years.

Nine Beats Catawba 9-8 As Season Ends; N.C. State Rained Out

Wake Forest Beats ’Cats 9-3 On Wednesday; Edmondson Stars Against Catawba; N. C. State Game Called For Rain; Hicks Has Best Average

After losing to Wake Forest 9 to 3 last Wednesday, Davidson’s varsity nine came back to nose out Catawba 9 to 8 and avenge an earlier defeat at the hands of the Indians. The game with N. C. State, scheduled to be played Saturday, was called off after the first inning because of rain.

With Ray Scarborough pitching five-hit ball, the Deacons never were in danger after the second inning, when they put together three hits and four bases on balls for five runs. The Wildcats scored singletons in the fourth, fifth, and eighth, while Wake Forest finished their scoring with one in the seventh and two in the eighth. Deacon shortstop led the hitters with two doubles in three trips, while Helleckson topped the ’Cats with two for four.

Catawba Falls

In the Catawba game “Hayseed” Thomas effectively scattered 12 hits, while his mates were pounding two Indian hurlers for 16. The ’Cats hopped on Ferguson for three runs in the first on two hits, a walk, and an error. They added two more in the second, two in the ninth, and one in the fifth and sixth. The Indians’ big inning was the eighth in which they scored four runs on three hits and two bases on balls. Morgan, Catawba second baseman, hit for the circuit with a man on.
