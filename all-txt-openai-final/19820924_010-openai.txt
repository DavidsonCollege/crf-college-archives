**Students Form Amnesty International**

One day twenty years ago, two students sat in a café in Lisbon and toasted to freedom. Their so-called freedom
was hardly a reality: they were arrested and imprisoned for almost five years. When a lawyer in Great Britain learned
of the injustice and imagined a similar incident happening in his own genuinely free society, he decided to do something
about it. He founded Amnesty International, now a 250 thousand-member organization which helps people who have been imprisoned for their
political or religious beliefs or for their race or color, but who have not used or advocated violence to gain
freedom.

A group of interested students are combining their efforts to form a Davidson chapter of Amnesty International. The organization, which
won the 1977 Nobel Peace Prize, can already be found in 151 countries around the world. So why form a
chapter in Davidson? Elizabeth Kiss '83, one of the major organizers of the new chapter, explains: “For Davidson, this is
a really important group to have. Here in college and in this country, we are in an atmosphere of freedom.
We need to recognize the fact that there are people our age out there who, if they did what we
do, would land in prison.”

Amnesty International approaches its cases through grassroots public pressure brought to bear on governments who are oppressing people. “Government,” says
Kiss, “can only get away with this inhumanity if it is forgotten.” Amnesty sends letters and petitions to everyone along
the governmental system, from local prison officials all the way to top heads of state. In its twenty years of
existence, Amnesty International has involved itself in 2200 cases, and of those, it has solved 1600 of them. The organization’s
other major role is to educate and to inform people about pertinent social issues.

Amnesty International’s arrival at Davidson marks an important point in human rights awareness. What started as last year’s Coalition on
El Salvador is soon to become an officially sponsored chapter of an internationally respected organization. Amnesty’s first project at Davidson
will begin on Monday with a petition drive against police brutality and civilian harassment in Uganda. A table will be
set up in front of the post office for people who wish to sign the petition and for people interested
in joining Amnesty International. An open meeting will be announced in the very near future. The whole community is welcome.

**Equal Rights the Hard Way: Pushing for what you want**

This past summer I worked in the laundry at Yellowstone Park, only five hundred feet from Old Faithful. Old Faithful
continued to build pressure and erupt every 72 minutes or so, but I noticed a different pressure rise in me
and other women who had everything to gain and nothing to lose from the ratification of the ERA. At the
laundry, I saw firsthand the need for sexual equality on the job, but I didn’t expect such frustration dealing with
these problems.

Davidson has probably made me more of a feminist than I might be if I attended a more liberal school.
My alma mater displays chambermaids on pedestals, and its women’s tennis team hitchhikes to tournaments, all of which forces me
to oppose vehemently its sexist nature. Unfortunately, the state of nature out west reflects sexism elsewhere in the world. There
are two sections to the Yellowstone laundry—a wash floor and a finish floor. The finish floor consists of the drying,
ironing, folding, stacking, counting, and loading of 15,000 pieces of linen a day—from towels to napkins to pillowcases. We also
checked sheets for stains of various types, but I’ll saveThose stories for another week. Tedious and unstraining, finish floor proved
to be the same day after day. Wash floor, on the other hand, tests not only one’s strength and endurance
but also one’s mental capacity to operate steam valves and 350-pound washers and work with chemicals. Usually the big guys,
like Yogi and Boo Boo, work wash floor. Yet my first day at the laundry I was told some women
in the past had worked wash floor. I said I would like to work wash floor. No response. Not until
the middle of July did I finally learn the mechanics of lifting five hundred-pound bins into extractors using a two-ton
crane and experience strained muscles, aching feet, and hands covered with chemical burns, blisters, and broken skin. Being a masochist,
I asked to work wash floor the next day but was refused: You aren’t strong enough. You don’t have the
muscles in your arms, chest, and back that you need. You’d have to give 150 percent to match a guy
physically. Men and women don’t labor well together. It’s too strenuous mentally as well as physically—you need time to recover.
This reply infuriated me. Who could tell me what I could and could not do? Who had the right to
dictate my physical limitations? After working finish floor diligently a few weeks, I again asked to work wash floor. “No,
we can’t afford to replace one of the regular wash floor guys with you, and anyway, you’ll be leaving in
a month, and we don’t have time to train you.” Why outdo myself and run my body ragged just to
prove I could do the work? All laundry workers were paid the same, worked the same hours, and enjoyed the
same watermelon at break. My friends on finish floor were singing, laughing, and having a rollicking time. Why work a
wash floor position that would put me in contention for the Miss Body Building contest or Davidson Homecoming Queen! The
week before leaving I figured I had nothing to lose and asked to work wash floor one last time. Again
I was refused. Upset, I went to my female supervisor and asked for help. This is what she said: “You
can talk all you want about an equal rights amendment and equal opportunity. You can go to the head of
personnel and claim sexual discrimination. You can think you have the right to work wash floor and shouldn’t have to
beg for the job. Fine. But unless you are willing to push for what you want, equal rights doesn’t mean
a thing. Men have to push for what they want, and so do women. Nothing gets handed to you on
a silver platter. You have to get in there, work until it kills you, and push! Then and only then
will you achieve equality.” The next morning, my day off, I was called to the laundry; a guy didn’t show
for work, and they needed an extra person on wash floor. Of all the people with the day off, they
asked me! I was ecstatic! And even with a full crew, I kept working wash floor that last week. Laundry
work, usually associated with subjection of women, became my liberation, for although laundry work is sex-biased, it forced me to
overcome the norm and be aggressive. Despite ERA’s defeat, I personally ensured my rights as a woman. And until an
equal rights amendment is ratified, individual struggles for equality must suffice. Where does that leave us here at Davidson College
with its sexist admissions policies? I figure we can either turn the laundry into an admissions office or turn the
admissions office into a laundry.
