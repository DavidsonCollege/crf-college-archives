Other new chairmen are as follows: Bob Bailey and Rick Onkey for community service, Derek Spencer for alumni; Pat Barrett for scholarship. Scott Tonidandel will serve as house manager and pledge master is Robert Fierro with Tighe Crovetti assisting.

New FIJI officers are president Taylor Hartley, treasurer Will Foy, recording secretary John Rogers, corresponding secretary Sean Scoopmire, and historian Matt Hammett. Other FIJI board members are appointed by the officers, and therefore may change in the future.

Intent is the Cheat continued from page 1

in the rewritten definition. The revision combines the two ideological viewpoints in a statement with guidelines to replace the old standards in the College Governance of Regulations and Procedures found in the Davidson Student Handbook. According to Dean of Students Will Terry, the revised definition will be “widely distributed” to the entire student body and printed in the 1994-95 Student Handbook.

Effective immediately after the second vote by the Student Conduct Council, all faculty and students will adhere to the newly clarified definition and guidelines of “dishonest representation.”

The Debate

The major discrepancy in the debate was the question of intent and its relation to plagiarism. For some faculty members, any misrepresentation of someone’s work constitutes plagiarism—intent not being the distinguishing characteristic. However, for others, intent is precisely what separates an honest mistake from plagiarism.

According to English professor Cynthia Lewis, who was invited to the Council as a faculty consultant, any misrepresentation of work is plagiarism. Whether or not a student has taken the time to learn the guidelines and boundaries of documentation in a paper is not the question; it is still plagiarism, she says. If a student uses direct material without the use of direct quotes and citations or paraphrases without attribution, it is “plagiarism by default,” says Lewis. Students who plead ignorance to the charges of plagiarism claim they do not know how to properly document work that is not their own. According to Lewis, this still constitutes a violation of the rules of writing.

Lewis remarks that in the past, serious “irregularities” in a student’s documentation were reported to the Dean of Students and then the student was brought before the Honor Council for plagiarism.

According to English professor Gill Holland, the definition of plagiarism does not include all types of faulty documentation. He believes the term should be saved for those cases where misleading documentation is used by the writer with the intent to deceive the reader. For Holland, this separates “honest mistakes from dishonest mistakes.” If proper credit is not given in a paper, it is up to the professor to distinguish whether or not there was the intention to deceive, says Holland. An error in attribution, done without intention by many students, is not an honor violation and should not be brought before the Honor Council, according to Holland. “Proper attribution of sources can be very tricky and it is easy to make an honest mistake,”He continues, “Intent is the crucial factor.” Holland refers to Chris Baldick’s *The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms* where it says plagiarism is “usually distinguished by its dishonest intention.”

**The Compromise**

As written for the Student Handbook, intention on the part of the student is what distinguishes plagiarism. The revision refers to plagiarism as “dishonest representation.” Later in the definition, it is made clear that all Davidson students should be “thoroughly familiar with methods for documenting the use of another person’s sentences, arguments, and ideas.” Dean Terry comments, “I feel good about it; it is simpler than the old definition.” The new statement will give more responsibility to the professors for “discovering and ferreting out plagiarism.” Terry states that fall sessions for freshmen will teach the rules and regulations of documentation. According to Lewis, there is now more room for judgment; professors can decide whether or not the student plagiarized. Says Lewis, this will “help the professors” in that they will have “more academic control.” Holland believes the clarification of the definition will be a great relief for faculty, students, and the Honor Council. However, he confesses that, for him, there has been no ambiguity in the term.

**Many fear the Lottery**

Post unofficial assignments on Feb. 23. Students who do not receive an apartment will be forced to shift their group numbers to fit the type of apartments that are available. Once again, students are allowed to apply for only one type of apartment, a 4- or 5-person, not both. In Phase II of the selection process, apartment applications are due on March 15. In this phase, rising juniors will also be allowed to apply for apartments. The remaining apartment assignments will be posted on March 16.

**The off-campus option**

To avoid the complexities of the apartment process, some students may choose to live off-campus. Rising seniors may apply to do so during Phase I of the housing process. In Phase II, both rising juniors and seniors may apply for off-campus status. For the first time, in order to receive off-campus permission, students must attend a meeting at Davidson Town Hall as an orientation for living in the Davidson community. Students will be granted permission to live off-campus in lottery number order. The number of students allowed permission to live off-campus depends on several factors, such as the number of predicted freshmen, and the number of students leaving to travel abroad in the fall. Essentially, RLO wants to ensure that its rooms will be filled.

**The single room option**

Phases I and II of the lottery process only include on-campus apartments and off-campus applications. In Phase III of the lottery process, students may apply for single room vacancies. A single room may be a viable option for seniors who may have been left out of a 5-person apartment group that did not receive a suite. However, many singles may already be occupied by Resident Advisors or students with special medical needs. Single room applications are due on March 29.

**The clustering policy**

Although apartment selections occur earlier this year than last year, double room selections occur at the same time. Women will choose rooms on April 6 and the men will choose their rooms on April 7. Both sessions last from 6:30 to 10 p.m. RLO hopes that those nights will run smoothly with the aid of a simplified clustering policy. Like last year, clusters will be allowed, but only for two rooms. Clusters’ positions in the lottery lines are determined by adding the four numbers and dividing by two. The reduced clustering allows RLO to more effectively monitor fraternity and eating house numbers on halls. No more than 40% of a male hall can belong to one fraternity; no more than 50% of a female hall can belong to one eating house.

**Room retention policy**

This year, students will not be allowed to retain their current rooms for next year. Formerly, certain rooms were designated so that upperclassmen could keep their rooms for the next year. In its overhaul of the lottery process, RLO eliminated this option. Sophomore Chad Richardson expresses his disappointment that he will not be able to retain his large room in Duke by saying, “that’s horrible.”

**Loft elimination**

For the first year, no homemade lofts will be allowed in any dorm. This year, Sentelle has been the only dorm with such lofts allowed. This policy helps eliminate room damage caused by students’ constructions. When a student chooses their room for next year, they will automatically receive a specific type of bed assignment that has been standardized by RLO. Students must leave the bed assigned to their room in that room.

**Information sessions**

The Residence Life Office is trying to avoid student confusion by offering two sessions to help clear up confusion about the new policies. Students are encouraged to attend and ask questions. Freshmen are required to attend “Lottery 101: A Novice’s Guide to Getting a Room” on March 1 in Love Auditorium. The meeting will last from 7-8 p.m. For upperclassmen, an optional information session will be held on January 31. “Lottery 201: Advanced Rooming Strategy” will be held from 7-8 p.m. in the Multi-Purpose Room in Chambers.
