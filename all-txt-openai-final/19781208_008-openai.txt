Charlotte cartoonist labels Davidson corrupt

By BILL PEEPLES,

“I did a cartoon on PTL one time. Boy, did I get a lot of nasty mail from those Christians!
One lady put me on her prayer list, which I couldn’t distinguish from her shit list.”

Doug Marlette’s cartoon on the Charlotte-based PTL Club is only one of many such drawings he discussed at the Minorities
luncheon Wednesday.

Marlette, political cartoonist for the Charlotte Observer, has been drawing since he left the cradle. He has always had quite
an imagination, and in childhood, he had an imaginary ‘friend’ that disturbed his parents.

Concerned, his parents took him to a child psychiatrist. The doctor, noted Marlette, said such a condition was ‘normal for
an eighteen-year-old.’ Actually, he was only five.

His parents played along with the notion of an imaginary friend. “Not only would they set a place for him
at the table, but they gave him more dessert than me,” commented Marlette. “They even let him stay up later
at night. So, I had him run over by an imaginary truck.”

In elementary school, he delighted friends with drawings of Mickey Mouse and Popeye. “I was slow in many ways,” he
said amidst laughter, “but I saw this was going to be lucrative.” In high school, counselors discouraged his desire for
an art career. “I never listened to them.”

Entering Florida State University with an art major, he later switched to philosophy. His training eventually led him to the
Observer, where he began working as the paper’s first political cartoonist.

Marlette’s cartoons have covered a wide range of subjects. Ones he displayed in his 900 Room talk depicted Hitler on
the psychiatrist's chair on the eve of the Nazi march through the Skokie, Illinois, Jewish neighborhood. “I want to march
on Skokie,” read the caption, “but I don’t believe in freedom of speech.”

Another caricature showed President Carter driving a station wagon loaded with camping gear. On the back seat, dressed in toddler's
clothes, Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat were tussling with one another. “If you two don’t knock it off,” said a
beleaguered Carter, “we won’t even go to Camp David.”

The cartoonist described a typical workday to the packed audience. He goes to work at 9:30, and after a conference
with the editors, he tries to come up with an idea for the daily cartoon before 11:30. If the idea
is approved, he goes to lunch, only to return and spend the entire afternoon on a single drawing before the
6:00 deadline.

During a question and answer period, one student asked Marlette if he ever receives any negative feedback from the politicians
he depicts. “So long as you spell their names right, it doesn't matter what you say about them,” he replied.
Jesse Helms even asks for each original drawing that pictures him.

Duke Power is the party that is the most offended by his cartoons and always on the defensive. “Every time
I do a cartoon on Duke Power, the president of the company writes a letter to the editor the next
day.”

Marlette’s main concern is to reflect the Observer's editorial policy. Nonetheless, his own biases are included in his work. “All
institutions are corrupt in that they are self-serving, from Davidson College to the Boy Scouts to the Ku Klux Klan.
If I do cartoons to undermine their self-interest, they get restless.”

He is not under pressure from his superiors to produce cartoons that are against his nature. “I have more freedom
at the Charlotte Observer than most cartoonists in the country,” he noted.
