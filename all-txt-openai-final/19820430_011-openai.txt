### frogless 20; form letter to my important people

Hello, it’s back again

from some remote time zone like a pilot

pushing a button — ;
or like a pilot light in South Dakota that suddenly —
goes out

for a year, or a week, and then melts

all the plastic in America—

like a man who disappears

and returns, impossibly, in Topeka or

a bar & grill in Idaho—

sometimes the soul can slowly vanish

and some time later reappear on the other side;
a man can grow in tunnels.

A transition might be through a slab of concrete
or it might happen in some numb creek between

### frogless 22, letter continued

Re-turning from a bad note
might be like a musician,
I don’t know.

And sometimes it is hard, being

dragged over a rainbow,

it is the unannounced jig,

unpremeditated egg roll, sudden

trillium

sprouting out of the jersey taxicab,
that unkinks the ‘hard, being

dragged’

to reveal a straight and wide truth,
a one-voice chord in the center of
the face.

The sudden trillium might well be
an ordinary mayapple that discovers
Fort Benning

and eats it, Arecibo-like.

### frogless 26, some old things happening in replay - end of the letter

sheets of ice;
it is the change that matters:
the form never changed a thing I tried to sink my bike
the process never changed the result through another 1969 orange chevy
and though a man like a quantum may tunnel with the white canvas top--

through an indefinable existence
yet the tunneling could not change the changing.

### frogless 21, continuation of the letter, containing rejection

A wart can be just a knob,

or a string attached to a tooth; —
a frog might be a lord, a frogless line
a tough confessional

but a rejection is a deal,

a dealer in black vinyl and stainless steelware.

and it is hard to settle with—

just as a man will not write

a letter to the editor while the
inexplicable sock crawls between
his toes, being unready to write.

The sky falls, the sun falls,

months later the typewriter emerges
with rumblings that suck the mud
up from the earth.

months later the sky emerges.

### DAVIDSONIAN, Friday 30 April 1982

I tried to put that bastard through the right front
fender,

straight on, and out the left

with a sound like the prodigal gear

trying to come home again,

to the old dog who eats tangerines.

I wanted this, or please

at least put me over, around, under
even, but not to bounce and break.
That would have been too much. So.

With the only umph I saw in the
still world between my front tire and the chevy, —
I umphed and sprung.

Like a superman, or a frog,

or some boot thrown at the dog or mailman,

I went over and

into the road, not breathing.

not knowing, not knowing,
and plowed there for some years,

and now, often months later,

I am whole, yes.
The light of dead wood.
