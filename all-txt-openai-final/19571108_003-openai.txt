FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 1957 THE DAVIDSONIAN

Battles Long-Idle VMI Breezes By Cats, Generals In C-C Meet

V.M.I. waltzed to a Southern Conference Cross-Country victory Wednesday with 19 points while Davidson exhausted Washington and Lee for the runner-up position, 57-59.

Rated as the number one small college team in the country, the Terriers are considered the best team on the Wildcats' schedule this year.

After three weeks of idleness, Davidson's football team prepares to meet the once-beaten Wofford Terriers tomorrow afternoon on Richardson Field.

In the last two weeks, Wofford has defeated two strong teams, Tampa and East Tennessee, and now has a 7-1 record. Their only loss was a 26-0 setback at the hands of South Carolina.

Although Coach Bill Dole's squad has managed three wins against two defeats for the season, the Wildcats are experiencing a three-week period of idleness before the game. Stating that the Wildcats are in good physical condition, Coach Dole said that with top spirit and performance by the Davidson squad, the Terriers will have a real game on their hands tomorrow.

The return of Paul Barbee and Ralph Setzler to the backfield improves the outlook for tomorrow's game considerably, while improvement by freshmen Harry Ray and Charlie Smith, injured in the West Virginia Tech game, and freshman halfback Ned Davis are the only players missing from the lineup this Saturday.

Hard scrimmaging this week has built the team up again after two weeks of inability to keep in constantly good shape. Tackles Lanny Voight and Charlie Smith, recovered from the flu and injuries, are expected to play.

Keydets Howard Savage, John McDougall, and Bob Williams took the second through fourth positions respectively. Angus McBryde grabbed fifth place with a time of 23.12 and was backed up by Graham Carroll's seventh place and Jim Alexander’s eighth. Bill Loeffler finished second behind McBryde to pace the Generals, who share the same season record as the Wildcats, at three losses and one win.

Charles Parker, Davidson wrestling coach, has been named to the wrestling committee for the 1959 Pan American and 1960 Olympic games. Also chairman of the Southern Conference Wrestling Coaches Association, Parker is now serving his second year on the NCAA Wrestling Rules Committee.

Dear folks,

Thanks to our many readers and advertisers and Davidson College, we of the DAVIDSONIAN staff are here in New York, to have a real ball. The purpose of our trip was to attend a press convention, but Dr. Bevan would say we're “rationalizing.” As we left Davidson our favorite soccer mentor was trying to put more “sock” in his club for the homestretch of the 1957 campaign, which at one time showed possibilities of a .750 finish. The team now has a .333 mark.

Bill Dole was trying to remind the Davidson fans that football was still in season, contrary to reports that flu had wiped out the Wildcats. Tomorrow the Wildcats play Wofford, the top small college team in the country. They still may get wiped out.

The Chambers P. A. system, designed to proclaim Davidson's victories on the athletic field, has proven quite a versatile thing on the campus. It seems that for a short while Phi Mu Alpha got hold of it and broadcast the strains of Beethoven's Fifth (a symphony). Then Homecoming weekend came, and the loudspeakers were used to instruct the students as to what they couldn't do, and why they couldn't do it.

The Davidson soccer squad meets the Washington and Lee Generals in Lexington, Va., tomorrow afternoon. This will be the second meeting of the two teams this year. Davidson eked out a 2 to 1 win on the home field in a thrilling game that ended in hectic fashion. Sophomore Henry Ramsey, whom coach McCutchan says is “coming along,” and Ross Smyth put the ball in the net for the tallies. Pete Anderson was outstanding on defense.

With only three rounds left in the inter-fraternity flickerball competition, the Kappa Sigs pace the league.Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

Furman won the match with a score of 1342. In the prone and sitting positions Davidson trailed Furman by only five points, but dropped 37 points in the standing position. The Wildcats' next shoulder-to-shoulder match will be at Wofford December 13. Each week the team fires in postal matches with such schools as the University of Tennessee, the University of Florida, Georgia Military College, University of Georgia, University of Mississippi, Florida State University, Manor Institute, and Wake Forest.

The six men firing for Davidson were Jerry Gattis, George Hemingway, Jack Lohman, Bob Martin, Topper Ruggles, and Joe Wearn. Gattis posted a total of 268 to lead the Wildcat riflers, while Hancock of Furman won individual honors with 283 points. The Wildcats fell to Duke, 4-1, in their season opener.

The Kappa Sigs downed the Sigma Nus 35 to 0 on Monday and then the Phi Delts 19 to 0 on Wednesday. Leading the scoring for the victors were Otis Lynn and Verner Stanley on Monday and Newt Quantz and Bob Baker on Wednesday. The coach was also high in his praise of goalie Finn, who was spectacular in both of the games and well on his way to filling the shoes vacated last year by Southern Freddy Butler.

The Phi Delts, in third place with 6 wins and 1 loss, beat the Independents 45 to 27 on Monday and then won an easy 57 to 13 victory over the Sigma Nus on Wednesday. The outstanding Phi Delts in these games were Mier, Tankersly, and Dave Wood.
