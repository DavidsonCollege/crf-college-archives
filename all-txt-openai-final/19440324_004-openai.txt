Murray, Alexander Preside Over Honorary Spanish Fraternity

Dr. George Summey Receives Recognition From Pi Kappa Alpha

Sigma Delta Pi, national Spanish fraternity, has initiated five Davidson students recently. Those taken in by the fraternity were L.
R. Drake, Kassner, W. D. Friday, H. M. Alexander, and J. L. Love.

National recognition of seventy-five years of membership in Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity will be given in mid-March to Dr. George
Summey, of New Orleans, pastor-emeritus of Third Presbyterian Church, New Orleans and professor emeritus of Austin Seminary, Austin, Texas. Dr.
Summey, initiated March 17, 1869, at Davidson College, will be 91 years old at his next birthday, June 3. He
was the youngest graduate of Davidson College and is now our oldest alumni.

Attended Seminary

Dr. Summey’s full life gives his statements adequate authority. Born in Asheville, N.C. of substantial Scotch-Irish stock, he graduated from
Davidson with distinction. Answering a call to the ministry, he attended Union Seminary, then at Hampden-Sydney and now at Richmond,
Va., and graduated from there. He held pastorates in Bolivar, Tenn., Covington, Ky., Graham and Burlington, N.C., and at New
Orleans.

Shown above are Colonel William J. Martin and Dr. William J. Martin, Jr., to whom the science building is to
be dedicated April 22. Colonel Martin is largely responsible for the creation of a science department at Davidson, and Dr.
Martin, who died last year, was professor of sciences here, and for a long time president of the college. Prominent
church and political leaders will take part in the dedication.

Five Davidson alumni recently graduated from pilot training at Maxwell Field, Alabama, and Turner Field, Albany, Ga., last week. Lt.

last year from the sophomore class. He was a member of Phi Gamma Delta.

Sumner M. Williams, Jr., son of Mrs. Elizabeth Williams of Clarksville, Tenn., was a member of Phi Gamma Delta. He
graduated from Davidson last year from the sophomore class. He was a member of Phi Gamma Delta.
