TO THE CLASS OF 1888.

Fellow Classmen: Every man who matriculated in this class is, of course, a member; and I am writing a word
to all. I am confidently counting on the old class having its name on the Founder's Plate of this building,
and I want it so stated, publicly and officially, at this Commencement. We ought to put in $1,000 as a
mark for the others to come to. We can do it. One member of the class has given me his
written pledge for $200 and another has done the same for $100. Are there not one or two others who
will pledge $200 and three who will pledge $100 each? Several will give $50, I am sure. We have two
years in which to pay these pledges. It will hurt, possibly, but it will not kill; and I feel that
the class of 1888 can and will do that much for the old college. The students now here and those
to come need the gymnasium; and when we get it we have great plans for developing the systematic physical building
up of every student. Write me now what you will do. Do not wait for the other fellow, but lead
the way somewhere worth while!

Yours in the bonds of the old and in service for the new days,
M. J. Martin.
