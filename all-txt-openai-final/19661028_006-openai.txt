College Girls Respect Davidson Parties

Editor's Note: The following is excerpted from a Winston-Salem Journal and Sentinel of college girls’ opinions about the husband-hunting prospects in North Carolina.

The men at Davidson College are intelligent and work hard, but “when they party, they PARTY!” said a Salem junior. College girls across the state agree with her. A UNC journalism major reports “really great weekend dates” at Davidson. The Davidson gentlemen, “a reality at least on big weekends,” are “so determined to have a good time and so thrilled to have girls on campus that their enthusiasm may wear you out.”

Another Carolina coed was less enthusiastic about her big weekend at Davidson. She described it this way: “Dating on campus for a big weekend there is like going out of a quiet room into a world of hungry people just released from strict diets — a definite frantic effort to raise hell and get your money's worth.”

“You'll have to spend the night in a vacated boys’ dorm,” warned a Duke coed, “and don't expect to see your date ‘til after lunch. He'll be conscientiously at class.”

“Davidson boys are smart, but immature,” said a Duke girl. “They have a preference for country music, alpaca sweaters and ties, and conventional girls in flowered dresses.”

Girls at several of the schools complained about the conceit of Davidson males. But a UNC-Chapel Hill religion major defended them. “The boys carry prestige just by going to the school,” she said.

“If a boy has gone to Davidson, chances are that he is very rich, well-rounded and smart,” added a State girl. “Davidson has the cream of the crop,” agreed another.

But the boys are apparently not the state's top college-age Casanovas. “If a Davidson boy looks deeply into your eyes,” said a Duke girl, “he'll probably propose a bridge game.”

Council Discusses Bonfire, Beanies

A Homecoming bonfire complete with folk singers, a Salem mixer and the demise of this year’s freshman beanies were among the subjects discussed by the Freshman Council in the College Union during chapel period Wednesday.

Council president Mac Davis told the council that the bonfire, which will be held Sunday morning at 1:30, will feature a folk group from New York. If there is inclement weather, the entertainment will be held in the Chambers Building basement.

Or, said a UNC-G girl, “he’s thinking, ‘will she fit into the upper class society of a doctor or a lawyer and be a definite social asset?’”

A Duke girl has a different explanation. “Davidson's lack of available girls tends to encourage proper behavior on dates,” she said, “rather than more basic drives.”

ONCE MORE UNTO THE BREACH

Way back in 1953 I started writing this column about campus life. Today, a full 13 years later, I am still writing this column, for my interest...in undergraduates is as keen and lively as ever. This is called “arrested development.” But where else can a writer find a subject as fascinating as the American campus? Where else are minds so nettled, bodies so roiled, psyches so unglued? Right now, for example, though the new school year has just begun, you've already encountered the following disasters:

1. You hate your teachers.
2. You hate your courses.
3. You hate your roommates.
4. You have no time to study.
5. You have no place to study.

Friends, let us, without despair, examine your problems one by one.

1. You hate your teachers. For shame, friends! Try looking at things their way. Take your English teacher, for instance. Here’s a man who is one of the world’s authorities on Robert Browning, yet he wears $30 tweeds and a pre-war necktie while his brother Sam, a high school dropout, earns 70 thou a year in aluminum siding. Is it so hard to understand why he writes “F” on top of your themes and “Eeeyich!” in the margin? Instead of hating him, should you not admire his dedication to scholarship, his disdain for the blandishments of commerce? Of course you should. You may flunk, but Pippa passes.

2. You hate your courses. You say, for example, that you don’t see the use of studying Macbeth when you are majoring in veterinary medicine. You're wrong, friends. Believe me, someday when you are running a bus kennel, you'll be mighty glad you learned “Out, damned Spot!”

3. You hate your roommates. This is, unquestionably, a big problem—in fact, the second biggest problem on American campuses. (The first biggest, of course, is on which side of your mortarboard do you dangle the tassel at Commencement?) But there is an answer to the roommate problem: keep changing roommates. The optimum interval, I have found, is every four hours.

4. You have no time to study. Friends, I’m glad to report there is a simple way to find extra time in your busy schedule. All you have to do is buy some Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades. Then you won’t be wasting precious hours hacking away with inferior blades, mangling your face again and again in a tedious, feckless effort to winnow your whiskers. Personna shaves you quickly and slickly, easily and breezily, hacklessly, scrapelessly, tuglessly, nicklessly, scratchlessly, matchlessly. Furthermore, Personna Blades last and last. Moreover, they are available both in double-edge and Injector style. And, as if this weren't enough, Personna is now offering you a chance to grab a fistful of $100 bills. The Personna Super Stainless Steel Sweepstakes is off and running! You can win $10,000 and even more. Get over to your Personna dealer for details and an entry blank. Don’t just stand there!

5. You have no place to study. This is a thorny one, I'll admit, what with the library so jammed and the dorms so noisy. But with a little ingenuity, you can still find a quiet, deserted spot—like the ticket office of the lacrosse team. Or a testimonial dinner for the dean. Or the nearest recruiting station.

You see, friends? When you've got a problem, don’t lie down and quit. Attack! Remember: America did not become the world’s greatest producer of milk solids and sorghum by running away from a fight!

The makers of Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades (double-edge or Injector style) and Barma-Shave (regular or menthol) are pleased (or apprehensive) to bring you another year of Max Shulman’s uninhibited, uncensored column.

This is Russ Kennedy of Balboa Island, California, on an in-port field trip as a student aboard Chapman College's floating campus. The note he paused to make as fellow students went ahead to inspect Hatshepsut’s Tomb in the Valley of the Kings near Luxor, he used to complete an assignment for his Comparative World Cultures professor. Russ transferred the 12 units earned during the study-travel semester at sea to his record at the University of California at Irvine where he continues studies toward a teaching career in life sciences.

As you read this, 450 other students have begun the fall semester voyage of discovery with Chapman aboard the s.s. RYNDAM, for which Holland-America Line acts as General Passenger Agents. In February still another 450 will embark from Los Angeles for the spring 1967 semester, this time bound for the Panama Canal, Venezuela, Brazil, Argentina, Nigeria, Senegal, Morocco, Spain, Portugal, The Netherlands, Denmark, Great Britain, and New York.
