SolicA recent talk before the Pan-American Medical Congress told of one of the evils of the international airplane lines. The
mosquitoes from tropical countries often stow away on air transports and are often brought into the United States by this
method. The insects carry with them the germs which produce various tropical diseases, including yellow fever. To prevent the transfer
and spreading of these diseases, Dr. Griffits suggested disinfection of the passengers and airliners, the sanitation of regions around the
tropical airports, and other methods which kill all the mosquitoes found in the planes after they have taken off.

It has been about definitely decided that Germany’s flag shall have the old imperial black-white-red (schwarzweissrote) with a swastika, emblem
of the Nazis, on the white center. Although the Reichstag has not definitely passed upon the bill authorizing the acceptance
of the new flag, it is expected that action will be taken in the near future. The new Reichstag has
just been consecrated, and all the actions and minor details show that the present assembly is becoming more and more
imperial in its feelings. The present Reichstag shows the end of the democracy and the return to some form of
government not unlike the old imperial rule, although no one knows exactly what will be the final form of leadership
adopted by Germany.

K. Cuker, a Czechoslovakian chemist, is planning on running his automobile with sugar as the fuel. He intends to use
the explosive property of finely powdered sugar as the basis of his invention. It is well known that a great
many different varieties of dust explode violently if ignited. Sugar, however, is best adapted to use in an internal combustion
engine because it leaves no ash in the cylinder. Mr. Cuker, in working on his invention, uses a mixture of
alcohol, naphthalene, and sugar powder to run his motor. The liquids tend to guarantee the firing of the sugar powder.
The reason for the desirability of a new type of motor fuel is that liquid petroleums are very expensive in
Europe. It is not known exactly what the cost of operation of the new fuel would be.

The recent California earthquake killed several people and destroyed a great many buildings. A coroner’s jury was formed in order
to find out if it was the fault of the builders that the houses were destroyed. The verdict of the
jury was that the construction engineers should not be held responsible, as the fatalities were a result of ignorance in
building rather than criminal negligence. The jury decided that the faulty buildings were weak because of the haste in which
they were built, owing to California’s rapid advancement. All the contractors who are repairing and rebuilding in the earthquake area
are urged to, as far as possible, make the new structures quake-proof.

The General Electric research laboratory has all kinds of extremely sensitive instruments for measuring length and volume, as well as
pressure. Mechanical instruments can measure as little as one ten-thousandth of an inch, while an X-ray instrument can measure a
distance as infinitesimal as 1-100,000,000,000th of an inch. Pressure gauges measure as little as one-trillionth of an atmosphere. As a
result of these accurate instruments, the General Electric laboratory claims that it can detect the presence of a single atom
of caesium in a cubic meter of space. This is claimed, although no one has ever seen an atom, or
ever hopes to see one with any of the present types of instruments.

The Cunard liner, Franconia, was recently boarded by about fifty “pirates” and frantic appeals were sent out by the wireless
operator before the “pirates” captured the radio room. The “pirates” were members of the Harvard dramatic club and were rehearsing
a play to be produced by them. It is certainly true that the club gained publicity, for all ships in
the North Atlantic tuned in on the SOS of the Franconia. If anyone objects, however, the Harvard club will describe
some of the antics done by some of the alumni who are now high up in political and business circles.

At the present time, we are making history fast and furiously. We wonder exactly what the school books of 1983
will teach of the crisis of March 4, 1933, and of the international strife and squabbling which is present. There
are plenty of interesting and important changes taking place: a revision of the banking rules, a new President with a
great many new ideas which seem to be coming into use, revision of the prohibition law, and a general depression,
which we hope is at its lowest ebb. Abroad we have an overthrow of the German republic, a situation in
Europe which many believe is as dangerous and explosive as conditions in 1914. In the Orient, Japan is warring on
China, and the rest of the world is standing by, watching her. War is also being carried on in South
America. To give any complete information of even one of these phases would take volumes, but the future histories will
probably condense the situation of today into one chapter.

Maybe these faces are ugly, but when a man looks at these, years after he has graduated, there are memories
connected with these persons that he will recall. Besides these “ugly faces” there are also some beautiful faces represented by
feminine pulchritude, which are very pleasing to gaze upon.

I SAW

How sweet to awaken in the morn
When sunbeams first begin to creep
Across the lea, and then to turn
Right back again and go to sleep.
—Thresa Crowd.

Chap I
“Glad to meet you.”
Chap II
“Isn’t the moon beautiful?”
Chap III
“Oozum love wuzum?”
Chap IV
“Do you—”
“I do—”
Chap V
“Do-da-da-da!”
Chap VI
“Where the samhill’s dinner?”

... a certain party ask man-about-town Coley Windham if he heard Gypsy Smith while in Gastonia recently. Coley replied, “No,
you know I seem to miss all those good orchestras.” Tee hee!

... and heard an individual say he wasn’t going home for the Easter holidays because he’s “trained for long distances.”
In a way it’s true; he has lots of ground to cover before June. I suppose those who are going
home will be burning gasoline instead of the midnight oil for a few days.

... that smart little dog belonging to Dr. Cummings all over the place last week. No matter where you were,
he was there too, whether it was in class or at a track meet at the stadium. He was perched
on the Dr.’s desk when classes began Monday morning. Dr. Cummings is an expert at teaching dogs tricks, partly because
he is so firm with them. I hear that at the track meet with Furman Saturday this remarkable creature tried
to enter several events and his favorite diversion was to set a pace for the varsity.

... and overheard a Sig Up discussing Shakespeare with a confrere the other night. They decided that Bacon wrote Shakespeare
plays because some of the language in them is so impolite Shakespeare would have been too much of a gentleman
to use it.

... by The Davidsonian where the college certainly takes an interest in its alumni. It read like this, “We will
be very glad to hear of the death of any of the alumni.”

... genial Professor Fleagle working in his garden of an afternoon last week. He has peas, snap beans, and all
kinds of vegetables already coming up. Speaking of gardens, I hear that another professor had a garden which was not
so successful, but his neighbor’s chickens took a first prize at the Charlotte poultry show.

... a large number of the college contingent go patriotic and attend the recent ball given in honor of the
pages attending the D. A. R. conference. The music was good, the pages charming, and there were so many stags
the girls did not develop that wall-flower complex. Oh, and I forgot to mention it was free and that explains
the large attendance.

Cab Calloway’s Charlotte appearance was also the occasion of another giddy, gay, and glamorous affair. The orchestra came straight from
the Cotton Club in ’ole New York and the music was up to the minute.

... Ed Hancock, president of the Red and Black Masquers, depart for Charleston, city of romance, cool breezes, and beautiful
belles, last Friday. He went especially to see the blooming azaleas and reports a wonderful trip.

TO “I SAW”

Listen reporters and you shall hear
How we “The Davidsonian” revere
With “Quips and Cranks and wanton wiles,”
It keeps our faces wreathed in smiles.
We read your paper every week
And accept its word as law,
And now, may I my mind bespeak
The best column is “I SAW.”
If I should give it honor due
Would you accept me to your crew?
I'll spy on every youth and maid
Who sometimes call a heart a spade.
A gardenia to the writer goes
For holding down the job,
But, why not try some keyhole news
You needn’t turn the knob,
Your knowledge should grow from men
Of the boys we find so fair
Don’t hold out anything you see
We'll help the foolish ones to bear.
(She don’t know Davidson.)
Forgive the writing, it’s a crime
Confessions of a lover’s rhyme
No longer do I have my spies
Please, in the column make me wise.

HOPEFULLY A SILENT LOVE.
