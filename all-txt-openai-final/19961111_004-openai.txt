This year, four Davidson seniors have been selected to attend the prestigious “Business Tomorrow” International Conference hosted by Princeton University’s Foundation for Communication.

Lori Bramblett, Eric Conley, Brad House, and Jeff Scherer will travel to New York City on November 24 to spend three days discussing the future of business with two hundred students and two hundred top executives.

Last year, two Davidson students were selected.

The theme of this year's conference is “Entrepreneurship: The Individual and the Corporation.”

Conley, an economics major, says, “[The conference] deals with how business is changing and how information technology and communications are revolutionizing the business world.”

Of his plans for next year, Conley states, “I’m pretty exclusively interested in investment banking and consulting. I know my capabilities, and the conference will give me insight into the capabilities of technology in business.”

Economics major Bramblett says, “I think it's going to be a great experience to speak with various people in the business industry. There'll be some really important keynote speakers and discussion groups on how to stimulate entrepreneurship in various businesses and how to keep employees in the company.”

“It's not often that one has the opportunity to give and receive information from such a prestigious group of individuals, and I can't really think of a better way to learn how to succeed in business than having the ability to question those who have already done it,” says Scherer, who is also an economics major.

The application process began when Bill Felty, the Career Services Office’s Associate Director for Internships and Placement, headed up the nomination of seven students who had expressed interest in business.

Each of these seven then mailed in an application, and in mid-October, Bramblett, Conley, House, and Scherer were notified of their selection.

Felty says, “Only 200 students were chosen from across the United States and internationally, so to have Davidson students as four of those is a big honor, not only for them but also for the school. . . I’m just really proud of the essays they wrote in the application process that made them stand out.”

If you haven’t been typed at a Bone Marrow Drive, then there is NO reason not to do so this year. Give Project Life money, too. They are saving lives.

Go see the HYPNOTIST at 9:30 in the 900 Room Sat. night. Maybe you will be picked and say funny things. Maybe your friends will be picked and say funny things. Either way, it’s worth it.
