### New Athletic Policy — Guidelines

#### Part 1: General

In October, the Board of Trustees made a policy statement on athletics and physical education. What is the basic thrust
of this policy? The basic thrust is that Davidson is strongly committed to the importance of intercollegiate and intramural sports
and to physical education as essential elements in the life of the college. In a nutshell, the Trustee action provides
for:

a. National level basketball with a determined goal of Top-20 performance.
b. A realistic, successful, and less costly football program.
c. An upgrading of the other sports.
d. A strong program of physical education, intramural, and club sports.

The major change seems to be in the football program. What are the basic reasons for the change? In football,
Davidson teams have always had an uphill struggle. As a small liberal arts college with an excellent reputation, the competitive
situation in the Southern Conference has always been inequitable. It is a great credit to the coaches and players that
despite the severe inequities, they have represented the college with spirit and determination. Unfortunately, it is Number 1 that is
the critical, decisive word. The number of men it takes to play the game, the number of grants required, and
the number of dollars to keep the level at which we have been trying to operate is costing between $150,000
and $200,000 per year in grants alone. If we were to move to a fully competitive situation with 100 players
on scholarship, the annual cost would be $400,000. The question before us, then, was not the difference in cost of
grants under the old program (approximately $170,000) and the cost of the new program based on need (possibly $100,000 to
$120,000) but rather, the difference between the cost of the old program and a fully competitive one which would probably
have required twice our present expenditure. To have committed ourselves to this kind of outlay would have been fiscally irresponsible.

#### Part 2: Basketball

Does the Trustee action imply that additional funds will be made available to basketball for recruiting, especially this year when
five seniors must be replaced? Under current NCAA squad limitations, a maximum of 18 full grants is the limit, and
no more than 6 new grants may be awarded in any given year. Even so, recruiting of the type necessary
for a national level basketball team is an expensive process. There is still a question mark as to what constitutes
an adequate recruiting budget. Consequently, under the direction of the Athletic Director and Athletic Director-elect, we will work this year
on a “rule of reason” basis to see what the job really takes. This year’s experience will provide a base
for future budget allocations.

Will we employ another person in the basketball program, as we did in the case of Duncan Postma and Jerry
Kroll, to help with recruiting and coaching? Most nationally competitive teams have a four-person staff. Postma and Kroll were very
valuable in assisting with the coaching, recruiting, and promotional efforts of the basketball team. We are therefore authorizing the employment
of an additional staff member for the basketball program, with the understanding that his duties, as with the duties of
other persons in the Athletic Department, will be assigned by the Athletic Director-elect for the maximum benefit of the entire
program.

What can be done to improve the physical facilities for basketball? Johnston Gymnasium obviously has its limitations. Certain improvements such
as a new floor and new backboards can and should be made in the near future. Last year’s senior class
pledged $10,000 to pay for major acoustical improvements. The work on acoustical improvements has already begun. A Field House which
would provide multiple facilities for many sports would be more logical and should be put into the priority schedule for
desired college facilities. A campus committee is making a thorough-going study now of future facilities needs. An entirely new indoor
athletic facility would be ideal.

#### Part 3: Football

How large a coaching staff will we have for the new football program? As one of his first responsibilities, the
Athletic Director-elect will be asked to make a complete study of total staff needs for all sports. On the basis
of this study, he will make recommendations as to the number of personnel in all areas, including the football program.

What will be the maximum number of players in the football program beginning in September 1974? The number of players
is a primary variable influencing almost every budgetary item. Consequently, a reasonable limit on the total number “suited up” from
year to year will provide a control on expenditures. In determining a reasonable number, the loss of players due to
injuries and other factors must be considered.taken into account. For instance, as some of the players dropped out of the
program and others were injured this fall, the squad size dropped to approximately 50 by the end of the season.
A starting number which would produce a mid-season average of approximately 60 players would seem to be a reasonable guideline.
To a large extent, this will have to be determined on the basis of experience under the new program. Wildcat
Club available meeting the obligation to foot- will also be a deter- for 1974.

When should the season start and how many games should be scheduled each season? It is recommended that the first
game be scheduled for the third week in September, and that ordinarily a maximum of 9 games be played.

Whom will we play? Building a schedule under the new program will obviously be difficult, especially at first. As a
general rule, we will try in the future to schedule institutions which meet some if not most of the following
criteria, although this will not necessarily be possible in 1974:
a. Comparable academic standing and objectives
b. Ranging in size between 750 (all men) and 3,000 (co-ed)
c. Same denominational affiliation
d. Similar financial support programs
e. Southern Conference members with which we have a good chance of competing successfully

Will we stay in the Southern Conference? We do not intend to leave the Southern Conference at the present time.

Will there be any improvement of physical facilities for football? Facilities generally are adequate. Certain new items, such as a
weight room under the East Stands for football, physical education, and all other sports would be desirable. A watering system
for the practice field and the playing field would enable those facilities to be better maintained. Given our laboratory schedules
and the necessity of night practice, as well as the possibility of more revenue from night games, a new lighting
system for the playing field would be a substantial help. However, consideration of new lights will have to be postponed
until after the energy crisis subsides.

Under the old system, need was not a factor in determining the amount of scholarship aid to be awarded to
the individual. Now that the amount awarded is limited to the individual's need, exactly how will the system work? A
student who is interested in playing football at Davidson must complete the regular application for admission and send all required
information to the Office of Admissions. In addition, he should inform the Head Coach that he wants to play football
at Davidson. If the student and his parents feel that he may need financial aid, the parents should complete a
copy of the financial statement of the College Scholarship Service, mail it to the appropriate office (Princeton in most cases)
and ask that a copy be sent to the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid at Davidson. If the student
is accepted by the Admissions Committee, and if the financial statement is received in the Admissions Office, the student will
be considered for all forms of financial aid. If our evaluation of the financial statement indicates financial need, an award
will be made. At Davidson, most awards are “packages” which include scholarship, loan, and job, in varying percentages. If a
student is awarded a financial aid package and has indicated to the Head Coach that he intends to play football,
the student will be considered by the coach for a supplementary grant. If he is recommended by the coach, the
amount of the supplementary grant will be determined by the coach up to the total of the loan and/or job
previously offered to the student. The grant will replace the job previously offered to him, and depending on the amount
of the grant, part or all of the loan previously offered to him.

For example: John Doe is accepted and our evaluation of the financial statement indicates financial need of $2,000. He is
offered an alumni scholarship of $800, a loan of $700, and a job of $500. If the coach decides to
recommend a supplementary $500 grant, his package would then become $800 alumni scholarship, $500 supplementary grant, and a $700 loan.
If John is an exceptional football player, his package could become $800 alumni scholarship and $1,200 supplementary grant.

In addition to grants based on need, Davidson College also will award a limited number of honorary $100 grants to
student-athletes who make an outstanding contribution to the team but who have no financial need at that time. These awards
not only honor the athlete for the contribution he is making to the athletic program, but also indicate to the
student and his parents that if in the future he needs financial assistance, he will receive special consideration for a
supplementary grant to meet his full financial need. In this sense, these honorary grants are a paid-up insurance policy to
guarantee the continuation of his education.
