Metrophilians Defeat the Eumenean-Pandeinics
Dunbar Ogden Takes Medal as Best Speaker for the Eumeneans.

The Junior-Senior debate which took place Thursday evening, April 13, was won by the men from the Metrophilian Society. The winning team, which consisted of Tink Taylor, Wooten, and Burney, upheld the negative side of the question, Resolved, that the Philippines should be given complete autonomy at once. The affirmative speakers were Henry Patterson and Dunbar Ogden, from the Eumenean, and W. W. Moore, from the Pandeinic. In addition to judging the debate, the judges also decided which of the affirmative speakers should receive the Junior-Senior debating medal given jointly by the Eumenean and Pandeinic Societies. This honor was awarded to Dunbar Ogden.

The meeting, which was regarded as a joint program of the four literary societies, is the only one on record where the regular programs were postponed for Junior-Senior debate. All four societies were present in force, each rooting and cheering for its team as it appeared upon the platform. J. I. Knight, this year’s medal man in his society, was chosen to represent the Phis in the Junior-Senior debate, but on account of his duties with the track team he was forced to withdraw. This left the Phi unrepresented, as the alternate, Wooten, was from the Metrophi. Although Wooten was an alternate, the enthusiasm with which his speech was received by the audience leaves no doubt but that he was the best speaker of the evening.

The affirmative advanced two main arguments. The first, upheld by Henry Patterson, was that in the name of liberty the Philippines deserved complete autonomy. The second, which was upheld by Moore and Ogden, stated that self-government would prove a success in the Philippines. On the other hand, the negative maintained that self-government would not prove successful in the Philippines, and that they were better off under the present system than they would be if they had their freedom. Taylor, Burney, and Wooten each argued their point from a different view. Their statistics from accepted authorities won for them the debate. The debate was characterized by the deep interest and enthusiasm of the speakers both in their main speeches and rebuttal.

The meeting was presided over by J. F. Clark, from the Phi. Henry Morris, a Eu man, kept time. The judges were Doctors Sentelle, A. Currie, and Erwin.

D. R fool used to blow out the gas and now he steps on it.

Vachel Lindsay Presents Many of His Poetic Works
Famous American Poet Reads a Variety of His Best Works to Davidson Audience.

Vachel Lindsay, one of the foremost of American poets, rendered interesting interpretative readings from his wide range of poetical works, in Shearer Hall, Wednesday night, April 26th. His presentation was vigorous, and his poetry exactly suited for the semi-dramatic interpretation that he gave. Mr. Lindsay believes poetry should be spoken, and with his previous training as a Y. M. C. A. lecturer in New York, he left the impression that he is an orator as well as a poet. As an entertainer, lecturer, and poet, Vachel Lindsay will always be remembered by Davidson men.

Mr. Lindsay opened his readings with (Continued on page 6)
