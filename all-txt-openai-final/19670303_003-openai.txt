**Denominational Control No Bar To Excellence**

Dear Editor:

Regarding your editorial entitled “Reform The Board” in the Feb. 10 issue, I thank you as a trustee for your obvious interest in upgrading Davidson College. My question is, can you change the basic stance of the school and still have D.C. as it was envisioned to be? True, the College is operated by the Presbyterian denomination, but its objectives exceed any “parochial” limits. Our ‘Statement of Purpose’ maintains: “The primary loyalty of the college extends beyond the bounds of denomination to the Christian Community as a whole, through which medium it would seek to serve the world.” I don't believe the increasing “lay control” you applauded in the Catholic schools could be any more ecumenical than that. Davidson does not need any legal separation from her controlling denomination in her efforts toward excellence. Both are committed to honor.

**Frustrated Senior Muses**

A FRUSTRATED college senior, one who has once again been brought back to reality, one who is reminded for the last time, perhaps, that few of us are able to build revolutions, to move mountains; this is the position I find myself in. I suppose that all of us pursue our own personal panaceas in our own individual fancies. I never have thought Davidson College was perfect, but I have always felt that it has the potential of attaining a place at the top in the ranks of professional educational institutions. I still believe that we will get there even if it does take much longer than is necessary. In the interim, deliver me from cynicism.

THE FRATERNITY system at Davidson has changed drastically during the past four years. It has been well established that there must be a significant place provided for the independent within the social framework of the college. The Independent has achieved a certain amount of stature (or is this merely a different perspective speaking?) At any rate, I am firmly convinced that there is real concern for the welfare of the 25 percent of the student body which is not affiliated with the fraternity system. I think that a willingness to cope with the situation effectively has been evinced widely by the fraternities. The faculty and administration may have provided the necessary initial coercion, but it has since dragged its heels and left most of the work to the students.

* * *

I SUPPOSE I share the hope of every faculty member that it becomes the job of the faculty and administration to provide for the social needs of the student body. If there were no fraternities what would fill the void? Yes, faculty, you had better hold on to this bastion; I certainly have never argued for its abolition, nor would I. But change is a different matter. Change takes time. There is no easy way to change long-standing institutions. I suppose even the liberal has a certain conservative bias: Why alter what seems to be working? But we have seen a willingness on the part of fraternities to include the independent in much of their activities. Social affiliation is becoming more and more of a real alternative for the Davidson student. And the hoped-for program of 100 percent opportunity for social affiliation seems about to become a reality. There is more recognition than ever before that the fraternity is NOT the “only way to go.”

* * *

SO WHAT IS the complaint? Well, it isn’t new, and it hasn’t been answered. I have quit asking for an answer for myself. But someday it will have to be faced. Davidson College is committed to the Christian faith. In effect, the college subsidizes the fraternity system. The idea that any student can be denied complete participation in such arms of the college is incompatible with the commitment of the college. It is that simple. I can see no advantage that accrues from this tacit approval of the principle of rejection. The fraternity system has never had anything to fear from me. And the next step of the change is on its way. The system obviously has nothing to fear from the faculty. So thank goodness for those people within the system who are willing to give an honest and realistic appraisal of their place in the Davidson College community. These are the people who will make the change, and they are the ones to be congratulated.

* * *

THE ENTIRE DISCUSSION has given me the chance to become a prophet. In time, I prophesy, the incongruence that I noted above will disappear, not the fraternity system, just the system as we know it. And the system itself will be the hero because the ones with the authority to make the change have abdicated their authority; expediency has taken precedence over right. But enough of a political diatribe.

* * *

I GUESS all I have wanted in all of this was to hear a valid explanation from the faculty or the administration. If only someone had called me quietly into his office and said: “Look, John; this is the way it is...." I might have been quiet. Well, things are going to change, but I’m convinced that the change will be slower than is warranted. The liberal arts education is relentless. It pursues you in every area of your life, and this is why it is so important. Discussion of the fraternity problem as I view it has returned me to the down-to-earth world of realism. Maybe I will be able to realize at long last that personal desires and feelings about what is right can’t always be answered clearly. And sometimes there is nothing one can do except relax and wait and hope the cards will fall his way at long last.

* * *

IN A SENSE this is part of my legacy. I wasn't able to draw a final solution, but perhaps there has been something of a contribution to the overall process. So, I look ahead. Him who said, “You will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.” This concern is again echoed in the Statement of Purpose: “Davidson is dedicated to the quest for truth and would set no limits on the adventures of the mind. Hence, it encourages teachers and students to explore the facts of the universe through the full and dedicated use of their intellectual powers.” The Board of Trustees, while understandably conditioned by our church relations, is largely independent of the presbyteries in terms of any dominating control. Rather, we are bound by our basic Christian convictions and our vow ". . . to be faithful in promoting the purpose of the College and in seeking to increase its effectiveness as an institution of Christian learning.” You wrote, “To release the Board of Trustees from their ties to the Southern Presbyterian Church would be one step toward making the school more Christian and less Presbyterian.” I for one believe it is possible to be both! In any case how would you rephrase the Statement of Purpose for Davidson College or the Trustee vows to improve on them? If you suggest a change, give us a choice.

**‘Academic Freedom’ Favored**

Dear Editor:

Mason Stephenson's contribution to “Quo Vadis?” (Feb. 10) is a worthwhile attempt to clear up some of the myths about the merits of the German university. From his description of the university system he draws the conclusion that it is more comparable to the American grad school than to the college. In so doing, however, Stephenson views the college as an institute to fill the educational gap between high school and graduate school.

**Open Letter Reveals ‘Blind, Stupid Fears’**

(ED. NOTE: The following is an open letter to the editor of The Florence Times in response to her open letter of last week in which she criticized the college for hosting an official of the Russian embassy on campus early in February.)

Dear Editor:

The undersigned wish to accept the challenge which publisher Lawton levels at the “American Student at a Presbyterian Church College.” In thinking for ourselves and so speaking, we represent three branches of our country's armed forces. We are neither pacifists nor reactionaries: we are merely opposed to stupidity. We are young, but not too young to learn the difference between freedom and abuse” in publisher Lawton's words—neither are we too young to fight. We would merely ask if publisher Lawton has grown too old to wish that there might be some other solution to international problems than the present bloodshed. In publisher Lawton's estimation, permitting a “bolshevic” to speak on an American campus is an abuse; as he (she?) melodramatically terms it “why should this purveyor of darkness be hosted by

**Patriotic Attestation**

Dear Editor,

The editorial section of last week's DAVIDSONIAN contained an article with reference to the tragic death of an American soldier in Vietnam. I think every American has debated the war we're waging, but your article is most regrettable. While not being sure of ourselves in Vietnam, we are all proud of the courage shown by these men. I find it hard to believe that you do not credit the soldier's statement to patriotism. Mr. Editor, to my mind, this is the highest class of patriotism there is. I have had the opportunity to talk to four boys who have recently returned from this war and they were in unanimous support of its purpose. There was no doubt in their minds that this was a war for personal freedom. Who are you, Mr. Editor, to question the patriotism of a man who has given his life for his country? As for me, I have a guilty feeling when I think about these boys—these men.

**LETTERS TO THE EDITOR**

THE DAVIDSONIAN welcomes letters from any reader, either in support of or differing from its policies. Letters should be typewritten, double-spaced, and should not exceed 250 words. We also will receive longer articles, but they will be subject to editing unless they have been cleared with theEditor,

In order to be printed in the following issue, letters should be received not later than 4 p.m. Tuesday. All letters must be signed.

Who are fighting while I remain here in protective Davidson. Your statement that “for him to have died for a politically contrived debacle is sickening” is one of the most discouraging statements I have ever read. Patriotism is most definitely a question here. Who is to say his death is “sickening?” He believed in his purpose in Vietnam, and he died for that purpose. It is not enough to admire this soldier's sincerity and courage. Why do you say the army is indoctrinating its forces with false conceptions?

Church and Country? The answer is, we maintain, that the greater abuse is not a learned, literate, Soviet diplomat speaking in calm rational language on a campus such as ours, but the blind bigotry of those who would prevent the understanding between men, which such a speaker promotes. We maintain that publisher Lawton’s flag waving and drum beating is not patriotism as we see it and would fight for it, but blind, stupid fears of the sort which cause the very wars which interest and understanding of the sort promoted by such speakers as Mr. Stepunin may prevent. We value our country’s heritage and take pride in calling ourselves Americans, yet we would work to see the senseless slaughter of Americans and “bolsheviks” alike cease once and for all. It might be well that we all took to heart the words of Mrs. John F. Kennedy, who, in a letter to Chairman Khrushchev on Dec. 1, 1963, wrote, “While big men know the needs for self-control and restraint—little men are sometimes moved by fear and pride. If only in the future the big men can continue to make the little ones sit down and talk, before they start to fight.” We are young men; can we not be big men?

Davidson College

Says, challenges the college to the double duty of furthering high school education and providing opportunities for guided study under the independent-study plan. It is apparent that Stephenson makes his evaluation from a comparison of educational systems in that his description of the college fits just about any average college in the American system. This approach fails to recognize that a number of colleges envision a goal somewhat above the goals of the system. These are the ones which try to provide the student with the special experience of identifying with the college. These colleges speak of such ideals as the identity of the college, class unity, and the product (cf. “The Davidson Product” in the College Catalog). I am not saying these ideals should be the foundation of an education, but I think they indicate that some colleges consider for themselves a role above that of the average college. (My choice of the word “above” is not to identify moral values but to use the traditional view of the realm of ideals.) Davidson College does not fit the description of the average American college. One argument often given in support of this contention is that Davidson is more rigorous academically than average. This point of view, however, would merely mean that Davidson is a leader among other colleges, from which it does not essentially differ. A challenge to Davidson to provide independent study as well as the teaching of core material is actually a challenge to the entire system. The only justification for directing it at Davidson in particular would be that Davidson, because of its advanced position, would have to face the problem first. Davidson promises more than academic rigor, however. To many who chase Davidson and similar liberal arts colleges, it was a chance to step out of the American system for four years for the special experience of the liberal arts community. As a matter of fact, few of them will be able to continue the experience past their college years because their personal and social responsibilities will necessitate their return to various positions within the structure of society. From my point of view, the challenge that Davidson fill a role as an intermediate institution in the educational system neglects the special function the college can perform. In accord with Stephenson, I would of course base my challenge to Davidson still on the academics of college education, for the college should be primarily interested in the character of its academic community rather than its Christian identity or the ideal of the Gentleman. Instead of academic rigor, however, I think Davidson should incorporate the ideal which is found in the German university, but which Stephenson failed to mention—academic freedom. The term may at first seem vague, but in Germany it is a well-defined concept which has been realized in the university. Essentially, academic freedom means the absence of authoritarianism in the area of academics. (My previous idea—that the term must mean the students could take what courses they wanted, didn't have to attend classes, and weren't graded—turned out to be false, or at least superficial.) Under the ideal of academic freedom, the student can deal with the material from his own standpoint, whether it is subjective or objective. In the German university, the fact that instead of a textbook, an entire bibliography is used for a course—like Humanities at Davidson—is the first indication of the freedom from authoritarianism in academics. While textbooks tend to present material dogmatically and are usually only poorly documented, a good book in a specific field will have arguments, both positive and negative, for a thesis and thorough documentation. A second sign of this freedom is that the lecture itself is comprised not of a professor's presentation of material but of his own thesis, argumentation, and references. The professor as a rule lectures on the book he is writing, so the lecture-room situation is actually a mixture of academician and student in each individual, including the professor. I can't say how much the individual students take advantage of their opportunity for free study, in the sense of reading, thinking, and reacting, as over against memorizing. With this statement, I do not mean to recall the debate on the role of facts in education. You have to have the facts to support your thesis. The question here centers more generally on the educational process—whether you learn the facts to support your argument or to list on a test. I'm sure some of the German students make full use of their opportunities and could list the facts on a writ. Others wouldn't be able to do it. It's a matter of personal interest and ability. The German university doesn't emphasize finding out quickly personal abilities, as the American system of writs and tests does. It seems to me psychologically good for the student to be able to find out his own limitations for himself and learn to live within them instead of his being shown up on a test. It also seems psychologically good to escape the authoritarianism of education in the South that Ed Dwelle talks about. (DAVIDSONIAN, Feb. 10). I would couch a challenge to Davidson in terms of what it could be: as an academic community, embodying the ideal of academic freedom through whatever means are possible in the situation. Elevating Davidson to this idealistic role is not to neglect its responsibility as an educational institution. It is instead to speak of an educational goal somewhat above those of the average American college. Davidson may not structurally compare with Marburg, but both institutions are concerned with education. This one fact provides the opportunity for an exchange of ideas between the two. As Stephenson says, it would be wrong to try to make Davidson fit into the German structure. Still, it should desire to incorporate the ideas which make up the strong points of German education, in as far as they are importable, into its own structural requirements.

SUMMARIZES PROGRESS
Reekin Recalls Tenure
Collegiate Press Service

Governor Reekin sat back in his chair and watched the rain. He had just finished his fifth term as Governor. He picked up the newspaper and read a page 52 story “Former University California president Clark Curr died yesterday.”

“Ha!” he snorted, “serves him right.”

“What serves who right?” Reekin’s wife Nancy asked.

“Curr died. Serves him right.” Reekin smiled.

“Poor Curr,” Mrs. Reekin said, returning her husband’s smile, “he never really caught on to what education was all about.”

“Remember when I first took office?” Reekin asked. “All those radicals were at Berkeley then and Curr was their leader. First we got rid of Curr, then the radicals, then Berkeley.”

“Yes, it certainly is much better as an agricultural station now than it ever was as a University,” Mrs. Reekin added.

“Cows in Berkeley?” Reekin was doubled up with laughter.

“Your tuition proposals were good too. After you made your famous speech in 1970, ‘Why Stop at $400?’ there was nothing they could do.” Mrs. Reekin's eyes twinkled with delight.

“Well, those boys and girls had to learn to pay for what they were getting. Actually, $2000 per semester was never out of anyone’s income bracket. To pay any less would be the same as stealing.”

“Remember how enrollment dropped from 87,000 to 1500? The University was at its finest hour. Too bad all the professors left, though.”

“But all the football coaches stayed, Nancy, and that’s what counts. UCLA won the Rose Bowl for 11 years straight. They even beat the Green Bay Packers one year.”

“It was marvelous, Ronnie, but if Curr had stayed it never could have happened.”

“Curr didn’t like football; he was incomprehensible. Why, when I went to Eureka College, we had things like English and history, but we had football too. In fact, I majored in the theory of football.”

“I always hated the name multiversity anyway. The ‘multipigskin’ was a much better name.”

“Football was practical, Nancy, and Curr could never see that. He wasn't practical. There was no reason to teach the boys and girls things like philosophy. How could they possibly get any value from their education after majoring in philosophy?”

“The Berkeley Agricultural Station has produced thousands of excellent farmers, Ronnie. It was a great idea.”

“Those boys sure can spade the manure. They'll make fine citizens.” Reekin made quick little motions with his hands as if shoveling manure.

“Changing UCLA to a School of Forestry wasn't such a bad idea either.”

“And you have to admit that the Riverside campus is doing much better as the Institute of Home Economics.”

“The Police Academy at the old Davis campus was just what we needed.” Reekin smiled again. “It's been great, Nancy, but it's too bad I never got anyone to take over as University President.”
