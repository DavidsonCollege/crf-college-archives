#### Changes in Regulations Of Rhodes Scholarships — Are Recently Completed

Notices From Rhodes Trustees State Time Extension for Studies at Oxford University

#### THIRD YEAR RESTRICTED

Choice of University Regulated According to Student’s Nationality

Certain changes have recently been introduced by the Rhodes trustees in the regulations which govern the tenure of the Rhodes
scholarships, and it is desired that these provisions be understood by all concerned.

The scholar is elected for two years in the first instance. If, therefore, he is unable to remain in Oxford
for a third year, it is not necessary (as it formerly was) for him to resign at the end of
his second year, although he is expected to give notice, not later than Trinity Term, in his second year, of
his intention to cease residence after six terms. A scholar who resides only for two years is expected to take
a degree within that time, and normally, therefore, the foregoing consideration will apply only to scholars who are qualified for
Senior standing. If the scholar wishes to continue his course for a third year at Oxford, which is expected to
be the usual case, he will be allowed to do so without further formality, provided (1) that he contemplates, for
his third year, a course of study which, in the opinion of his college and of the trustees, is appropriate
and profitable, and (2) that his work and conduct have been satisfactory. Regard will be given to his performance in
the schools, if he is examined for a degree at the end of his second year. No rigid rule is
laid down as to the class which is expected of a scholar in a final honor school, but each case
will be judged on its merits.

During his second year, the scholar may apply either (1) to spend his third year at another university, or (2)
to postpone his third year at Oxford until a later date. Before these alternatives are considered separately, it is necessary
to explain one principle which applies to both, namely, that neither of these privileges is to be considered as a
matter of course. It is expected that most scholars will spend three consecutive years at Oxford, and it will be
only in exceptional circumstances and on a strong case being made that the trustees will give permission for deviation from
the ordinary course. They will need to be convinced that it is eminently in the interests of the scholar’s immediate
studies and activities that he should spend a year at another university or should postpone the completion of his Oxford
course.

#### Third year at another university

The university at which the scholar proposes to study must be one which, in the opinion of the trustees, is
of reputable academic standing. No allowance can be made for traveling expenses. Permission will be given: (a) For study at
any university in the scholar’s country of origin; (b) to scholars from the United States, Canada, Newfoundland, Bermuda, or Jamaica
for study at any university in North America; (c) to scholars for study at any university in Australia or vice
versa; (d) to scholars from Malta for study in any European university except in England. Tenure of the scholarship will
be subject to satisfactory reports from the university at which the scholar is studying. Payments of a stipend will be
quarterly and can be made only in sterling. While the trustees again do not desire to lay down a rule
as to the results of examinations, it is improbable that they would give permission for study at another university to
a scholar who had not taken his degree at Oxford and obtained at least a second class (if examined in
a final honor school).

#### Postponed third year

The trustees cannot, at the end of a scholar’s second year, give definite permission for him to return at a
later time for a third year at Oxford. On application being made in the sixth term of actual residence, they
will intimate to the scholar, after considering the reasons which he has advanced, whether they will be prepared to consider
a future application. In other words, they cannot bind themselves irrevocably to the future resumption of the scholarship, but can
only indicate whether the scholar’s application, when the time arrives to make it, will be entertained. At such a time
the scholar wishes to return to Oxford for the postponed year, he should make application to the Oxford secretary, with
a full statement of his recent activities and his proposed course of study, if possible, six months and in no
case less than three months, before the date when he proposes to resume his residence. A definite decision will then
be given by the trustees, who will be largely guided by the view of the college authorities and the Oxford
secretary as to the value of the course he proposes to pursue. It should not be assumed that the scholar
is entitled to return to Oxford until this decision has been made known.

The period of postponement must vary in different cases, but the trustees desire it to be known that they do
not consider that the return of the third year should be postponed too long. The intention of the postponement is
to enable a scholar to complete his education under the most favorable conditions and not to enable him to spend
a year in Oxford when approaching middle age. The postponed third year is available at no other university than Oxford.

#### General

During the continuance of the scholarship, at whatever time or place, the general conditions governing tenure and qualifications remain. One
of these conditions is that the scholarship is automatically vacated by marriage, and this rule applies to the third year,
at whatever university it is spent, when it follows consecutively upon the first two years. In the case of a
postponed third year, however, marriage will not operate as a disqualification. If, however, the scholar marries when he has left
Oxford after completing two years of actual residence, he must state this fact explicitly if...and when he makes application to
return for a postponed third year. Marriage will not necessarily be regarded unfavorably by the trustees, but will be considered
together with all the other circumstances of the application. The trustees feel that there are objections to a married scholar
attempting to reside in Oxford during the postponed third year with his wife and family unless he has considerably larger
funds at his disposal than a Rhodes scholarship.

prowess in the Freshman events, leading the field with 75 1-8 points. The other Freshmen scores were as follows: Duke,
57 1-2; North Carolina State, 15; Davidson, 11 1-3, and Wake Forest, 1. Among the Freshmen, new records were set

marks were shattered, but were not counted due to the windage. Childers of the Carolina Freshmen set new records in
the broad jump and high jump and tied the 100-yard dash mark to get individual scoring honors with 15. His
teammate, Hawthorne, who took the hurdles in record time, came next with 10 points. Rex, of State, set new marks
in the shot and discus to also score 10 points.

Sig Eps, Kappa Sigs and Pikas Are Frat Winners
Last Tuesday, May 3, the Sigma Alpha Epsilon baseball team received a very severe beating from the Sigma Phi Epsilon
nine, being downed by the score of 12 to 2. The losers fought hard during the entire contest, but countless
errors gave their opponents too many runs. Wiley and A. Manson pitched for the S. A. E.’s while C. Howard
hurled for the victors.
On Wednesday, May 4, the Pi K. A.’s defeated the Pi Kappa Phi’s in the last game of the first
round of the tournament. The game, which ended with the score of 28 to 8, was featured by several home
runs and a number of three-baggers. In the second inning, the Pi K. A.’s ran in nine, which piled up
too big a score for their opponents to overcome. Kirkland starred on the mound for the winners while Stanley pitched
nice ball for the vanquished.
The following day the Betas met the Kappa Sigmas in the first game of the second round, the Kappa Sigs
winning by the close score of 5 to 2. The contest started very slowly as each team was playing hard
ball. The end of the fifth inning found the winners leading by only one point, but in the final bracket,
they ran in two scores. Pitching for the Betas was Brewer and for the Kappa Sigs was Holland.
This week the S. P. E.’s will meet the Phi Gams in the second and last game of the second
round, due to the fact that the Pi K. A.’s drew a bye to the semi-finals.
