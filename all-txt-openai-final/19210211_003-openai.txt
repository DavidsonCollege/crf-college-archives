Phi Society.
The oratory of Burney and the eloquence of Harold McKeithan made last Thursday night’s program of the Phi Society unusually
good. The query for discussion was, Resolved: That the United States should cancel the war debt owed her by the
Allies. Under the able leadership of “Link” Taylor, the affirmative brought out the following points: That the United States could
and should start the wheels of progress moving by canceling the aforesaid debt; that, as the United States has already
done so much for the Allies, the proposed measure would work no additional hardships on the United States; that mutual
benefit would follow the cancellation of the debt. The negative, under the guidance of Burney, advanced these reasons why the
United States should not cancel the debt: first, that the internal financial needs of the United States are of more
importance than the needs of Europe; second, that the United States is under no obligation to cancel this debt; that
the Allies have gained enough to keep them from needing relief from this burden. The decision was unanimous for the
negative.

Resolved: That movies are uplifting to humanity, was extemporaneously debated by Harold McKeithan and C. G. Brown. McKeithan, upholding the
negative, claimed that movies are educational and that they teach moral lessons. C. G. Brown attacked movies on the ground
that they have a strong tendency toward evil for both young and old. The decision was two to one for
the affirmative.

G. M. Hodgin and P. C. Henderson delivered splendid declamations. D. R. Freeman gave an excellent exhibition of oratory in
his timely oration. The meeting Thursday night, Feb. 10th, will be given over to the election of officers. Full attendance
is desired at this important meeting.

Eu Society.
The constitution of the Eu Society was presented, after a thorough revision, for adoption at the last meeting of this
organization. The articles in their new form were accepted unanimously. The body of the constitution as it now stands is
much shorter than formerly, a large part having been transferred to the by-laws. Another important matter, the time of meeting,
was voted upon. Hereafter the Eu meetings will be held at eight o’clock each Saturday evening instead of six forty-five.

The program was unusually good, consisting of a debate on the subject, “Resolved, that the United States should cancel the
war debt of her allies,” and a declamation on Robert E. Lee. Those supporting the affirmative side of the debate
query were Phillips, Warren, and Elkins; those defending the negative were Bailey, J. C., Fain, and Sharpe. America’s obligation to
her allies and her ability to cancel the war debt constituted the principal arguments of the affirmative. On the other
hand, the bad effect on our allies and the large sum to be canceled were the points advanced by the
negative. The negative received the decision of the judges. Kretchman’s declamation on General Lee was well delivered and was well
suited to an audience of Southern men.

SIGMA UPSILON AND THE BOOKLOVERS’ CLUB TO HOLD COMBINED MEETING
Sunday, 236 men attended these classes. Sigma Upsilon, the college literary fraternity, and the Booklover's Club, an organization composed of
town ladies, will hold a combined meeting in the Civic League Hall, on the night of February 22nd. This is
the first joint meeting ever held by the two organizations and the members of both are looking forward with pleasure
to this innovation.In addition to the regular literary program, several attractive musical features are being arranged.

JOURNALISTIC FRATERNITY DISCUSSES FUTURE WORK

The Delta Pi Kappa journalistic fraternity held its regular meeting on the night of February 1st in the Kappa Alpha
hall. The proposed activities of the fraternity were fully discussed and a tentative program was made out. The phases of
journalistic life on the campus were discussed and various plans suggested by which Delta Pi Kappa could be of much
force in literary production at Davidson. The fraternity also hopes to inoculate into the minds of its members during the
spring term, a working knowledge of the laws and principles of journalism.

SALEM Y. W. C. A. HEARS DAVIDSON VOLUNTEERS

Roberts and Miller Talk on General Subject of Missions.

On Friday night Dave Roberts and Dwight Miller visited Salem College at Winston and both spoke to the young ladies
there at their regular Y. W. C. A. service. The general subject of missions was discussed. The object of the
meeting was to interest the young ladies in mission work and later to get a Volunteer Band organized there. These
fellows were sent by the Davidson Volunteer Band, and the meeting there was held under the auspices of the Salem
Y. W. C. A. Both fellows report a delightful trip. As “P. D.” expressed it, “Who could help it with
a hundred and seventy-five American Beauties all around him?” “P. D.” also says that when he and Dave ate in
the dining room Friday night, two against a hundred and seventy-five, Dave's knife and fork were prone to rattle. At
his request, the reporter did not ask Dave how “P. D.’s” knife and fork behaved.

COLORED MAN’S ATTITUDE TO BE PRESENTED TO STUDENTS

Dr. H. L. McCrory, of Biddle University, to Speak to “Y” Sunday.

At the service Sunday evening Dr. H. L. McCrory, president of Biddle University in Charlotte, will address the Davidson students,
giving them some idea of the way the negro looks upon the relation between himself and the white man. The
object of having Dr. McCrory here is to bring to our students a clearer idea of the other side of
the racial question that is before us at this time. Davidson men will have to consider this matter from time
to time and the address at this time should be very helpful in promoting a proper understanding of the question
on our part. Accompanying Dr. McCrory will be a quintette of his singers from Biddle, which is the Colored Presbyterian
University in the South, and these five singers come from the theological department. Biddle singers have quite a reputation and
their singing should contribute in no small way to a successful meeting. It is hoped that a large number of
students will be present to hear the address and the singing.

There’s a Senior at Dennison who claims the “bumming” record for the last football season. He “bummed” more than a
thousand miles and attended every game without paying a cent of railway fare—The Torch.

BIBLE CLASSES ARE DOING GOOD WORK

Increased interest has been shown in the Bible classes since the new division of classes was made and the study
of the new book taken up. These discussion groups prove very helpful and beneficial to those who attend. It is
hoped that no more of the classes will be combined, as a few have already done, for more good can
be derived from a small class than from a large one. Last Sunday:
