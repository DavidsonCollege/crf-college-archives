**A Crash Course in the History of Davidson College**

By Towner Blackstock

In 1835, the Concord Presbytery set out to establish a college “to bring the benefits of education within the reach of the poor boys of the community and preparatory to the Gospel Ministry.” Within a year, construction began on Davidson College, named in honor of General William Davidson, who died at the Battle of Cowans Ford during the Revolution. You may still see two of the first small, one-story dorms, Oak and Elm Row, in between Chambers and Main Street. They were in place in time for the first sixty-four students to arrive in March 1837.

Initially, Davidson had a “manual labor system,” where students worked as field hands for the College in order to offset their boarding costs. By 1841, too many disassembled wagons stuck in the tops of trees convinced the Trustees that the system didn’t work. Students welcomed the change but remained generally bored in their isolated rural locale. The two literary societies, Eumenean and Philanthropic, with their beautifully furnished 1850 buildings, provided the only social outlet available in the form of writing and debating, and gave a welcome addition to the strict rote memorization expected in a Classical curriculum. They also provided the basis for the Honor Code known and respected by all Davidson students.

For most of its early existence, “poverty and indifference” continued to plague Davidson, including an 1854 incident where the entire student body left school to protest the expulsion of a fellow student by the faculty. However, cooler heads, solid discipline, and a sizable donation by Maxwell Chambers gave the school the support it needed to secure its future. His legacy provided for the construction of Chambers Building, finished in 1860, and in its time the grandest academic building in the South.

After the Civil War, Davidson moved from state to regional prominence, expanding its student body and physical plant. A gym, chemical lab building, library building, and new dorms sprung up before World War I, and student enrollment grew to over three hundred by 1910. In 1921, however, the Old Chambers Building burned, leaving students and alumni alike unsure of the future. A new Chambers Building, completed in 1929, signaled a new era of continued growth and success for Davidson. Other improvements included a revolutionary college-owned fraternity court (now Jackson Court), the first of its kind, added in 1928 to house the fraternities that had existed secretly since 1858 but officially only since the 1880s.

After the Second World War, Davidson has seen many advancements. African-American students arrived in the early sixties, and women were admitted as full students in the early seventies. That period of time brought Davidson its national renown as a top liberal arts college, and the past ten years have only solidified that reputation. Additional dorms, a gargantuan sports facility, and a modern new infirmary have been recently added to the campus, now nearly recovered from the ravages of Hurricane Hugo in 1989. Several renovations of historic Main Street buildings have been undertaken by the College, including the red brick Helper Hotel (1848). Currently under construction is the new arts building, signaling the start of an aggressive building campaign to bring even greater resources and opportunities to the Davidson community.

From shaky beginnings but firm resolve in 1836, Davidson has built upon the faith of her founders an admirable community of 1600 students, a prestigious faculty, and a rigorous and respected curriculum stressing the liberal arts, while providing the opportunities of a larger campus in a small-town environment. Considering it all began with just 64 students (only eleven of whom graduated) and a faculty of just three including the president, Davidson College has...
