THE DAVIDSONIAN, APRIL 29, 1936

MASQUERS ARE TO GIVE FARCE TUESDAY NIGHT

Presentation Will Be a Three-Act Play “Three-Cornered Moon”

TO BE UNUSUAL COMEDY

Play Presented on Broadway And Called “A Romp”

By FITZHUGH DADE

In 1932, when “Three-Cornered Moon” was first presented on Broadway, the august New York Times chortled thus over the comedy: “It is a harum-scarum lark danced on the surface of a down-at-the-heels whirl-wind of impudent irrelevancies—a demented antic—a romp.” Certainly, if the Times unbent to say this about the play, it must have the ability to provoke many a laugh, much enthusiastic comment.

The play—which is only six days off—will be the first comedy which will make its appeal strongest to Davidson students. Unlike several that could have been picked, this play has no aim of improving the dramatic taste of the students, being merely intended to provide a pleasant evening’s entertainment, and give occupation to amateur actors, who would starve in the big world.

From almost every point of view the Rimplegars are moonstruck. Even if you study this family around whom the action revolves you will never hear two words which make sense. In the first act they are considerably well off in the world; and being spared the necessity of working, they take out their lunacy in inventing complicated methods of suicide or in impulsive journeys. But suddenly they find themselves penniless. Mrs. Rimplegar, having sold out the family fortune to a margin broker, puts on her wrapper, does up her hair in a Turkish towel and meanders dizzily around the house. That is why the Rimplegar children all go to work at starvation wages, and become a clan with a cause. But idle or industrious, a Rimplegar is always the same. From one day to the next he never tampers with logic.

The imperturbable Mrs. Rimplegar and her household of mercurial children have their prototypes in any community. The Doctor, who seems to be the common-sensical hero of the drama, is a man we know intimately, and as for Donald the author, every village has one or more of these visionaries.

Characters in this play are likely to be embarrassed by the rather uncomplimentary descriptions in the front of the play-books. Mrs. Rimplegar is a glazed, rattle-brained woman whose gestures are uncertain and whose reactions are belated. She is motherly-looking, but not sugary; although she would probably like to be, she doesn’t dare, her children being what they are. Douglas is about twenty-two. For some reason that is never very clear to anybody, he thinks that he has dramatic ability and would like to go on the stage. In his ordinary conversation he is not—happily—theatrical, but every once in a while he pulls what he calls a gag. Kenneth is twenty-five, and has more dignity than all the other Rimplegars put together, which, to be sure, is not saying overmuch for Kenneth. His speech is affected, his accent being either Harvardian or Oxonian, whichever is most unpleasant to you. Jenny is a red-cheeked, husky Czechoslovakian girl; Ed must be mysterious in some obscure way, for the book merely says of him that he “is eighteen.” Elizabeth is a dark girl about twenty-three, with large eyes and no dignity at all. Kitty, the other female element in the play, is a Brooklyn beauty.

SIGMA PHI EPSILON—Cassali of Welch, W. Va., Frank Taylor of Vartaville and Rell Gholston of Oxford were week-end visitors of Epsilon chapter.

Doctor Stevens, a tall man, heavier built than any of the others, is thirty-two. His face is strong, powerful, his mouth steady and kind. He is the only one on the stage who bears a certain maturity of face and manner.

Donald is a long, lanky person, awkward, with too many legs and arms, but charming. He has a sensitive, immature face and a humorous mouth. He is about twenty-four.

Colorful Costumes Reign Supreme at Bowery Ball

Jailbirds, gypsies, soldiers, sailors and just plain morons were all in their glory last Saturday night at the Bowery Ball, the final major social event of the year. The “grande finale” Saturday night presented a great variety of apparel. Many of the seniors were heard to express themselves as saying that at this “Brewery Ball” more of the boys came “dressed” than ever before since they had been here. Everybody came looking like they were sure of winning the coveted prize given annually by the Pan-Hellenic Council, but alas, there was no prize! The best explanation could be found by looking at Harold Sugg, who came dressed as a Pan-Hellenic representative, with a little placard on his back “We're Losing Money,” and with pockets bulging with the much-discussed money bags. So nobody won the prize—except the Pan-Hellenic Council.

“Hindu” Brown came most appropriately dressed for the occasion. For those of you on whom this witty name was lost, please recollect that our Mr. Brown has a most unusual nickname and this is a very clever play upon the name. Most everybody had a different shirt, skirt or pants but the blazing footwear of the Vowles and Ryburn was a most original innovation. Yes, we will back your vision for you. There were two of those beautiful blue “suits of sin” on the floor and we might add that it was only a coincidence. And the lady with the evening dress on one side and the other leg clad in shorts was most confusing if you were introduced from one side and broke on the other.

You could fall in love with Cleopatra, Rebecca of Sunnybrook, the lady off the Godey’s Magazine, a Scotch lassie or two, or any one of a number of the famous ladies out of the “gay nineties.” If the ladies confined themselves for the most part to pastels not so the male contingent. The red, white, and blue of the decorations looked tame beside the costumes of the house. 

Faculty Members Judge Plays In Salisbury

Professor H. T. Lilly, Dr. W. T. Cumming, and Mrs. W. T. Cumming served as judges of an original short story and one-act play contest which was held at Salisbury recently. The contest was the Mary Harmon Snyder Cup contest which was open to all. The contest was sponsored by various literary organizations of Salisbury. The officials of the contest asked Professor Lilly and Dr. and Mrs. Cumming to act in the capacity of judges because of their recognized ability in the field of literature. There were about twenty short stories entered in the contest and they were judged last week. There were no plays entered in the competition, it was announced.

The prize was won by a short story entitled “The Old Gods,” written by one whose pseudonym is Rex Lyon. It is a story of a Voodoo witch doctor who comes into a southern town from his native Haiti and draws the local negro population back to the ancestral magic rites and performances. The climax comes in a vivid, gory scene of Voodoo sacrifice in a weird setting. The stories are those of adults and not a school affair, as is indicated by the scope of the stories themselves. Dr. Cumming read some of the stories to his classes which are now studying the writing of short stories to illustrate various points in their construction.

Alston Charges Cabinet, Conducts Vesper Service

Reverend Wallace McPheeters Alston, head of the General Association of Young People’s Work, was the guest minister at the Vespers Service last Sunday. He took this opportunity to publicly address the incoming Y.M.C.A. officers and cabinet. Rev. John Knox Coit gave the invocation and after it the Glee Club gave the response, “The Lord is in His Holy Temple.” Rev. Alston took as his text John 5:4: “For whatsoever is begotten of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that hath overcome the world, even our faith.”

The minister gave the approaches that are in use now. One is unconditional surrender by which one seeks the easiest way out. The user of the way of cynicism is defeated but wants to hurt and hinder others. The way of pagan self-confidence is one in which the user says “I am the master of my soul.” A self-confidence is not pagan, however. With the way of expediency, one establishes an ideal and strives toward it whether the way is right or not. This is a daring way. The final way and the only Christian way of approach is that of faith. Faith consists of insight and courage. There are three applications of faith. The first of these is that the faithful are willing to invest without reaping and dare to try something new. The second application is that faith is the only Christian outlook toward disappointment. The faithful find compensation and incentive in disappointment. The last is that they find meaning in suffering. This challenges us to seek sacrifice.

After the benediction, the Glee Club gave “Hear Our Prayer O Lord” as a response.

Discusses Subsidization

An Oxford-style debate, on the subject of subsidizing athletes, was the principal feature of the meeting of the Eumenean Literary Society, Tuesday evening, April 21. In the absence of President Jedway Purnell, the vice president, R.T. Stewart, presided over the meeting and debate. Gene Vogler took the vice president’s chair. After the devotional service, the reading of the minutes, and the business, Percy McLean presented a speech upon the subject, “Steel: A Giant Awakened,” showing the importance of steel in modern life and the extent of the new industries. The subject of subsidization for the debate was chosen at the beginning of the meeting over several suggested topics. At the suggestion of the presiding officer, the debate was in the Oxford style, so that any member could question or contradict a speaker upon his statements. T. Brown, who suggested subsidization as a debate topic, was first called upon to explain the subject. He believed that the present system of supporting athletes in many educational institutions was unsound. He also attacked the present system. The position of the “paid” athlete was defended by Bancroft Moseley and E.S. Wilson. Election of officers and another debate on a subject to be chosen at the beginning of the meeting were scheduled for last night.
