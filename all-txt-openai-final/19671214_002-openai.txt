**Shell Game**

One of the arguments used Monday night at a special meeting held by the Student Body Constitution revision committee to
support its product was that Davidson is, after all, one community, and we should aim for a campus-wide government. While
we were gratified to hear those familiar words, it occurs to us that, in this particular case, the old Davidson
word game has once again taken on the proportions of a shell game.

The particular provision which was being defended by the committee was Article IV, Section 4: "The student shall be as
free as possible from regulation not directly relevant to his education. The standards of conduct shall be formulated with significant
student participation." It had been suggested that the last sentence of this section be changed to read, "The rules of
student conduct shall be formulated by students."

Then here came the campus government bandwagon in all of its glory to be driven down the wrong road as
committee members claimed that such a change would violate the good of setting up an integrated community.

There are three ways that student discipline could be handled:

The present system could be retained. Now the students are allowed to run around making rules, while the faculty and
administration determine which of those rules shall be obeyed and what additional rules shall also be obeyed. The student body
can only write pretty documents requesting changes.

Secondly, the one community concept could be used. Here the dichotomy of the present rule structure would be eliminated. In
an integrated community, all members should help determine what rules are needed to govern that society. Logically, if the students
and faculty share responsibility for determining the rules governing private student conduct, then they should also write rules governing the
private lives of faculty members.

The third alternative would be for the faculty to determine what rules are necessary for their private lives and for
the students to be responsible for the conduct of their private lives.

Davidson College, by virtue of its small size if nothing else, does throw the faculty, administration, and student body into
one society, sharing many communal interests. Among these common concerns are the curriculum, the official college relationship with the Presbyterian
Church, and the financing of the college program. All members of the college community should share the responsibility for these
things because all are affected directly by them. The private conduct of students and faculty members, however, is not such
an issue. Each group should determine what rules are necessary to give order to its own method of living. The
fact that students are all racked together in the close society of storage bins known as dormitories would mean that
the student body would have to impose tighter restrictions upon itself than does the faculty living in a more normal
civil society. These restrictions, however, should be legislated by the student body because it is the group affected by them.

The committee made no substantial effort to apply the concept of campus government to other parts of the student government.
Only here, where the idea is not applicable, did it seek to use the language of campus government. By claiming
that the faculty should make the rules for student conduct, the revision committee is trying to pass the buck for
what should be a student responsibility.

**Faculty Kill-Joys**

Wouldn't you know the faculty would find a way to mess up a fun thing like writing editorials for THE
DAVIDSONIAN? After all the time we spent late at night sharpening the invective keys on our editorial typewriter (that’s the
one with the "we" key where other typewriters have an "I"), after all that time, the faculty decided to make
ROTC non-compulsory. Now all we can do is compliment them on a wise decision, and, gee whiz, that’s no fun
at all.

**‘Schizo’ Students**

As we read the report of Blue Sky subcommittee on student life, we seem to find implicit in many of
its criticisms of Davidson student life a belief that the Davidson student is really "schizo" as a result of the
fragmentation of the educational process. Since the adjective "schizo" is our own and not the committee’s, we had better define
our terms (a Davidson fetish, not limited to editorial writers exclusively) so that all will know what we mean.

Realizing first of all that the definition of the term "schizo" resides ultimately in our "Judeo-Christian heritage" (a term we
have heard before somewhere but cannot define), we will simply say that the term parallels in the student’s life what
the Humanities Department has decided is "overdepartmentalization" in the curriculum. We know of no better way to sidestep the question
of defining the term "schizo" than by relating it to the Humanities Department, thereby obscuring the issue beyond all possibility
of concise definition.

Now that we have "passed the buck" about our definition of "schizo" — "pass the buck" may be defined by
any number of people in any number of places on campus — we can get on to the subject at
hand.

The Student Life Subcommittee’s report says that the "educational process is total" and, ideally, unfragmented into academic and social categories.
Unfortunately, such fragmentation does exist and produces the schizo Davidson student. The dorms are places where students are stored when
not in use, says the committee. They serve no purpose. They merely lie passively between the academic extreme on the
hill and the social extreme on the court. The Hill is a place where students are exercised intellectually every morning.
The fraternity court is a corresponding place where the students are exercised socially, thus producing the liberal Davidson gentleman whom
we all know and love.

The problem with this fragmentation is, for the subcommittee, a simple problem of a lack of diversification in a student’s
contacts. The barriers between what educates and what relaxes never are broken down: The Davidson student has an innate distrust,
therefore, of his relationship to academics. On the Hill, he feels like a wage-earner who has been cheating on the
timeclock. He is afraid the boss will find out he has not been putting in enough hours on the job.
On the other hand, at the fraternity house, he may be accepted "for what he is." The fraternity house is
a way of getting away from academic pressures. However, there are 12 different fraternities with 12 different attitudes toward their
relationships to the Hill as well as with each other. The barriers between students and the Hill are complemented by
the barriers between social fraternity and the Hill. And the barriers between various social fraternities are too well known even
to discuss.

Therefore, the Davidson student is schizo. There are all sorts of arbitrary unspoken rules defining relationships of students and faculty,
students and students. What it seems to us the Blue Sky subcommittee is calling for is a feeling of community
at Davidson. The Davidson community is an intricately stratified structure existing on the academic and social planes. Both planes create
obstacles which prohibit the kind of interaction between faculty and student body that is necessary to the real concept of
community which should exist.

What the subcommittee offers seems to be the best solution: remodeling the dorms, renovation and fuller use of fraternity facilities,
and the creation of a College Union which would provide a "meeting point of the curriculum and the extra-curriculum." It
is only by integrating the present social structure into some meaningful relationship to the academic realm that Davidson students can,
for the first time, discover the meaning of an academic community, a place in which interacting minds enjoy a congenial
relationship, not on the basis of the wage-earner and the boss, but on the basis of a mutual commitment to
knowledge and understanding.

**LETTERS TO THE EDITOR**

**Reed Cites Program’s Weakness**

Dear Editor,

It’s hard for me to write this letter. After helping to organize the Richardson Fellows program last spring, I find
it difficult to express my criticism of its activities. Since I have resigned from the program, however, I feel that
an explanation is in order. Also, I am writing in hope that the Richardson Fellows will recognize and deal with
the serious flaws which, in my opinion, must surely result in the failure and death of the program.

I have two basic criticisms of the Richardson Fellows’ activities as they now exist. First, the program has no adult
adviser. Despite the fact that Mike Mooty is a capable individual, I am convinced that no student can be expected
to administer a $20,000-per-year program, the goal of which he himself must define, while at the same time he inspires
12 students and teaches them "how to succeed." The director of such a program must be a man of age
and experience: he must be an "insider" with regard to the faculty: he must have training in the evaluation of
young people. Needless to say, the Davidson Richardson Fellows desperately need someone with these qualifications. (Arrangements are being made, by
the way, for the hiring of such a person as soon as possible.)

Secondly, the program is not being evaluated in any objective way. Sure, the Fellows sometimes sit down and talk about
how they feel about the program, but unfortunately, no one seems concerned about long-range evaluation. Perhaps the Richardson Foundation is
wasting $20,000 each year. Or perhaps the Fellows are being harmed by participating in the program (e.g., by becoming arrogant
or overly idealistic). Who can say? But at least someonemust try to determine the long-range results of the program, since
it is only by its results that the program can be justified. Besides these basic criticisms, I have several other
misgivings about the program. (All of these weaknesses, I believe, are consequences of the two basic flaws.) With no help
from any older person, the sophomore Richardson Fellows are interviewing the freshman applicants. But are they competent to make these
value judgments? I think not. At any rate, I am certain that these sophomores have no right to intimidate their
fellow students. (I have heard that one freshman was asked, “Why haven't you contributed anything to Davidson since you've been
here?” and several freshmen froze up and were unable to speak when asked to defend their positions.) Are these sophomores
playing God? Furthermore, the goals of the program seem unrealistic—in fact, no one really knows what they are. “We're trying
to develop leadership potential,” they say. But what does that mean? All is not lost, however. Contrary to what THE
DAVIDSONIAN editor believes, the program has not gone “down the drain." A seminar at Chapel Hill and a visit by
civil rights worker Anna Hedgeman were highly stimulating and provocative; also, several Fellows have made important contacts and have secured
excellent summer jobs through the program. But I wonder why it takes $20,000 to set up a couple of seminars
and to place a few students in summer jobs. Why must so much money be spent on office redecoration, on
summer trips for the student director, and on meals for the Fellows? And besides, might it not be true that
the really outstanding student can secure his own summer jobs? And are there not a great many opportunities for intellectual
stimulation, which already exist at Davidson, and which the Fellows could, but don’t, take advantage of? (Or does the program
encourage the Fellows to isolate themselves from the ordinary opportunities and channels of action?) Big deal, you say? Who cares
if the Richardson Foundation wastes $20,000 this year? We all should care, because as Richardson money is being poured into
“leadership” programs, programs of known value (such as the Richardson Scholarships) are being discontinued. In short, I am not ready
to write the program off as a failure. But I, like THE DAVIDSONIAN, have heard too much talk and have
seen too little action. Kirk Reed, ‘68 Davidson College.

Rejection Is Valid

Dear Editor,

Although we agree with Mr. Earnhardt and THE DAVIDSONIAN that the setting of fires in dormitories is a serious offense
often made with little regard to possible consequences, we disagree with THE DAVIDSONIAN’S statement that the rejection of the recently
proposed amendment shows an irresponsibility on the part of the student body. The problem of dormitory fires is not one
which can be adequately solved by additional provisions in the Constitution. Rather, steps should be taken to emphasize and enforce
present regulations concerning student conduct and those activities which may result in damage to or defacement of school property. We
believe that enforcement of standing regulations within the flexibility newly attained by the Student Body Regulations offers a greater opportunity
for the expression of student responsibility than would legalistic graffiti.

Looking By GEOFF SEAMANS Associate Editor

Pass In Review

Every forward-looking, perceptive observer of the Davidson scene quite naturally applauds the decision of the faculty to abolish compulsory ROTC
and to do away with academic credit for the first two years of the program. The ROTC department has traditionally
provided malcontents like myself with something to make mock of. The elimination of its compulsory nature thus has destroyed a
part of the Davidson heritage, has denied us chronic scoffers a convenient target for our derision. I am not ready
to feel particularly deprived now that the program seems to be on the road to extinction, but there remains that
still, small voice within me which whispers, “Oh, damn! What can I go after now?”

Several aspects of the faculty move still remain incredible. That such action could be termed “controversial” (as it was described
by the “Charlotte Observer”) is amazing. That the vote was as close as it turned out to be is astounding.
And that it took until 1967 to get rid of the institution is downright ridiculous. Criticizing the program has long
been, in the words of the good old analogy, like beating a dead horse. To do so here would be
repetitive and uninteresting, though a lot of fun. However, I'll resist the temptation.

A whole tradition of legends has grown up around ROTC activities. Many of these tales find their setting in times
before I happened upon the Davidson campus. For example, there’s the one about the band commander who decided to work
up, on the quiet, a unique contribution to a federal inspection. The day of the inspection arrived, all the units
were in place. At the appointed hour, the troops began to pass in review. Up from the band company rose
the strains of “The Mickey Mouse Club March.” I understand that the band company commander lost some rank as a
result of the incident.

Or there’s the time that some non-ROTC upperclassmen decided to surprise the brigade at another federal inspection. At the end
of the drill, the cadets marched toward the gate out of Richardson Field, only to find them locked. Ever since
that affair, so the story goes, cadets with unloaded guns (excuse me, weapons) have been stationed at each gate to
prevent a repeat of the fiasco.

There are some incidents that I can recall from my own days in the ROTC program. Who could forget the
last drill of Joe Dial’s sophomore year, when he arrived on the field decked out in full beard, eye shades,
white socks, uncut hair, and peace buttons? His company commander ordered him to leave, stipulating that for each minute he
stayed he would receive something like five demerits. Joe stayed, protesting that he was paying full tuition at Davidson College
and was thereby entitled to stay and participate in drill as long as he so desired. He eventually quit the
premises, returning a short while later in normal civilian clothes. He found a good seat up in the stands of
Richardson Field, and watched the rest of the day’s proceedings from that vantage point.

On the other extreme, there is the life story of Pinckney Whitson. The ultimate in ROTC jock-ism, Pinckney was noted
for the intense seriousness with which he engaged in all sorts of ROTC activities, from drill to ROTC field day.
Probably the peak of his career here at Davidson occurred when he challenged the Charlotte National Guard to a rifle
dis-assembly and assembly contest.

My personal experience with drill was actually fairly pleasant. I tooted the baritone horn in the band company, and was
able to sate some of my perverse urges by playing out of tune, missing notes, and generally attempting to make
the hour more interesting. Good training for the GNP Rug Band. In the ROTC classroom, however, my time was less
valuably misspent. My sophomore year, under the tutelage of easy-going Major Fraley, wasn’t too bad, because he seemed to care
about as little as I did. My freshman year, though, was a different story. Led by Major Gill, affectionately dubbed
by the students “The Desert Ox,” the course provoked a mixed response of amusement and pathos, as I and 269
other freshmen suffered through such challenging, provocative topics as “The Care and Cleaning of the Rifle.”
