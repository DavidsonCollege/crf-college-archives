THE DAVIDSONIAN, OCTOBER 19, 1922

On Saturday Coach Grey's Fighting Wildcats celebrate Home-coming Day by a battle royal with the V. P. I. Gobblers. If
ever dope favored one team it favors the Gobblers, but “the dope” is unsteady on its legs now and has
been known to wobble and fall several times during the present season, two noteworthy failures of the dopesters being in
the two tie games of last Saturday between the Michigan Wolverines and the Vanderbilt Commodores and the Heckman-Wildcat fray. The
scores of the previous games are as follows:

You can talk about your artists who painted long ago, of Raphael, Turner, Reubens, Hunt, and Michael Angelo. They were
near divine you say; their paintings were sublime; but for true beauty, I will choose Coles Phillips every time. I
need say nothing more of him, for everybody knows that he’s the guy that paints those ads of girls in
Holeproof Hose.

Martin Foil says Concord is some town. They go to Charlotte for the weekend with a clean collar and a
$2 bill and never change either one.

Ode to Latin 2
By M. W. Trawick.
My Latin, 'tis of thee,
Short cut to lunacy,
O’er thee I'll rave;
Another week, or so
Of studying thee I know
Will send me straight below
Down to my grave.

October 12, 1922, 3:10 p.m.—Gordon enters the library to purchase two sheets of drafting paper.
4:10 p.m.—Gordon leaves the library with two small pieces of drafting paper and his face wreathed in smiles. Why the
Smiles?

D. Sentelle in Bible 2—“There now, M. Black, just keep that in mind and you will have it in a
nutshell.”

Sam Summers says every time he goes home he takes a lower berth. For if you take a lower berth
on a Pullman, it is really higher than the upper because it costs more, while the upper is lower than
the lower. Most people don’t like the upper, although it is lower on account of its being higher. When you
occupy an upper you have to get up to your bed, and then get down when you get up. It
is best to take the lower, although it is higher than the upper for the reason that the upper is
lower because it is higher. In other words, the higher is the lower.

Proposals
Suggested program for chapel exercises:
Monday—Mack Sennett comedy.
Tuesday—Lecture on Revolution, by W.J. Bryan, Wednesday—Tambourine selections Bohemian troupe. Thursday—Five-reel feature Without Benefit of Clergy. Friday—Smoker and Cheer Practice.
Saturday—Discussion as to ways and means of checking the overflow of water on the campus. “The poor we have always
with us,” remarked the Prof, as he handed back the review papers.

The bird who, when asked if he ever kissed his girl under the mistletoe, replied, indignantly, that he never fooled
around the lady’s pedal extremities.

“Who ever said these professors lead a fast life?” asks Snag Dailey, “none of them ever passed me.”

Jew Elliott with pride—“There’s lots to our little town.” Fresh Shaw—“Yes, nothing else.”

Announcement in English I—All themes should be written on one side of the paper and a good many of them
shouldn't be written on either side.

Whiteside—“This chills me to the bone.” McCallum—“You cold weather should wear a Hatie D.”

The scores of the two teams in the first four games of the season are as follows:
- V. P. I. 39; Hampden-Sidney 0.
- V. P. I. 25; Wings College 6.
- V. P. I. 20; Williams and Mary 6.
- V. P. I. 6; Centre 10.
- Davidson 24; Elon 0.
- Davidson 7; P. C. 8.
- Davidson 0; Georgia Tech 19.
- Davidson 6; Wake Forest 6.

The Gobblers have rolled up 89 points to 22 for their opponents, while the Wildcats have scored 37 points against
33 for their opponents. When Centre with its powerful offense only could rush one touchdown across the Gobbler line, the
prospects look black for the Wildcats. By comparison scores, the Wildcats are due to be beaten with a 50 to
0 or by a margin of 31 points—but comparative scores do not take into consideration that the Wildcats have not
been defeated on Sprunt Field in many years.
