### Terrorists murder kidnap victims; Congress fights
By DAVID WILLIAMS

Headlining the events of April 18-24:

**Internationally** — A terrorist group allegedly linked to Palestinian terrorist Abu Nidal murdered three kidnap victims in Lebanon, including two
British and one American. The bodies of the victims were found on a mountain road east of Beirut. British authorities
said they have firm evidence of direct Libyan involvement in the kidnappings, but Libyan officials denied the charges. The Revolutionary
Organization of Socialist Moslems distributed a videotape of a man hanging from a scaffold whom it identified as missing British
journalist Alec Collett, who was kidnapped by Islamic extremists in March 1985. In London, British officials arrested a man suspected
of trying to bomb an El Al flight.

Meanwhile, Libya buried 20 victims of the U.S. raid amid angry anti-American protests. President Reagan said some European allies had
proposed a stronger attack against Libya than the one undertaken by the U.S. on April 14, but that the U.S.
decided on a limited bomb strike. However, Reagan reaffirmed his commitment to act again against Libya if it can be
linked to new attacks against Americans. Reagan said he would not rule out military retaliation against Syria and Iran if
they can be linked to terrorist attacks. Great Britain ordered the deportation of 21 Libyan students described as threats to
national security. The chairman of Britain’s Conservative party said the U.S. owes it favors, such as easier U.S. extradition of
I.R.A. guerrillas, for its support of the U.S. bombing of Libya. Italian Prime Minister Bettino Craxi said Italy would respond
with “severity” to any new Libyan attacks on Italian territory. West Germany and Denmark said they would sharply reduce the
size of Libyan diplomatic missions to their countries.

Meanwhile, Federal authorities indicted seventeen persons, including a retired Israeli general, on federal charges of conspiring to sell Iran more
than $2 billion worth of U.S. weapons, including missiles, helicopters, tanks, and fighter jets. Senate and House committee members recommended
that Congress reject a White House proposal to sell more than $354 million in missiles to Saudi Arabia. The Senate
Foreign Relations Committee announced it will investigate claims that Nicaraguan contras have engaged in drug smuggling, gun-running, terrorist plotting, and
misuse of federal and private funds. U.S. intelligence sources disclosed that a helicopter carrying two CIA employees was shot down
last month by Nicaraguan forces who were attacking contra camps in Honduras. Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev said a U.S.-Soviet summit
is still possible this year if the Reagan administration alters its course of “militaristic and aggressive U.S. actions” in the
Middle East. Soviet commandos captured and destroyed a strategic Afghani rebel base near the Pakistani border in southeastern Afghanistan. Afghanistan
and Pakistan have accepted a new draft proposal on the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan as a basis for
talks in Geneva next month.

In a major policy reversal, President Reagan said he had decided to comply with the unratified SALT II arms agreement
by dismantling two older Poseidon missile submarines. Government scientists said new types of nuclear weapons under development for the Strategic
Defense Initiative could require dozens and perhaps hundreds of nuclear explosions to perfect their design.

South African President P.W. Botha said the government will stop enforcing pass laws, which prohibit blacks from entering urban areas
without government permits. Botha said anyone in jail for pass-law offenses would be freed. Botha also asked parliament to give
the South African Minister of Law and Order powers approaching martial law authority to deal with the country’s recurrent civil
strife. The South African government seized and buried the body of Xhosa tribal chief Sabata Dalindyebo. Five hundred soldiers and
policemen were present to keep his funeral from turning into an anti-apartheid rally.

**In other developments** — Vietnam has indefinitely suspended a U.N.-sponsored program that...allowed more than 100,000 Vietnamese to leave legally and
safely. The Washington Post obtained a secret U.N. file showing that the U.N. War Crimes Commission concluded in 1948 there
was sufficient evidence to prosecute Kurt Waldheim for the murder of Yugoslav partisans. Ferdinand Marcos predicted that insurgents will overthrow
Philippines President Corazon Aquino within a month. Two Cuban refugees who drifted in rubber inner tubes for eight days were
rescued Monday by a Coast Guard vessel 25 miles off the coast of Florida. Finally, Queen Elizabeth II of England
celebrated her 60th birthday Monday.

Nationally — The Reagan administration and Congress began fighting an “historic” Supreme Court battle over the constitutionality of the recent
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings legislation. The administration claims the law violates separation of powers by giving too much budget authority to Congress, while
Congressional attorneys defend the law’s constitutionality and the comptroller general’s key role in the budget reduction process. The Supreme Court
ruled Tuesday that the First Amendment guarantee of free expression does not require a higher legal standard for permitting police
to seize books or movies than to seize drugs or weapons. In a victory for the press, the Court also
ruled that a private individual cannot win libel damages from a news organization without proving that published statements about him
were false.

A Titan 34D rocket believed to be carrying a secret spy satellite exploded seconds after blasting off Friday. It was
the second failure in a row of a Titan 34D. The Federal Reserve Board announced it would cut the discount
rate to 6.5 percent, the lowest level for this key lending rate in eight years. The Commerce Department said that
consumer prices fell 0.4 percent in March, marking the biggest decline since 1950. The decline is mainly attributed to a
record plunge in gasoline prices. The Census Bureau released a study showing that 13 percent of adults living in the
United States are illiterate in English. The House reversed its position on salaries for its own members and voted down
an action that would have let members make up to $7,510 more a year from speeches. It also removed the
cap on other outside earnings. In its first vote on the fiscal 1987 budget, the Senate overwhelmingly turned down President
Reagan's request to terminate 44 domestic programs. The Senate also voted to restore education funds cut under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings and
to raise taxes to pay for the costs.

Governors of five states testified before a House subcommittee on energy conservation that the Energy Department has used “shoddy” site
selection research for potential nuclear waste disposal facilities. The Reagan administration said it would be willing to accept higher excise
taxes on consumers to finance lower income tax rates in the president's tax-revision plan. Saying that product liability lawsuits have
jeopardized industries, the Reagan administration has proposed legislation that would pre-empt state laws and make it difficult for consumers to
win damages for injuries in such lawsuits. The Center for Disease Control proposed to bar immigration into the United States
to people suffering from AIDS. Meanwhile, a study of needle punctures and other accidental exposures to the blood of AIDS
patients has found that the spread of AIDS infections in the nation’s hospitals is extremely rare. Finally, twin tornadoes swept
through Sweetwater, Texas, killing one, injuring more than 90, and cutting a half-mile wide path of destruction.
