Boy on Stairs

At the Lycee,
Two starched sisters, penguins actually,
Emit their pristine sagacity in

peristaltic waves.

We sit, meek fools
That we are, flicking Drosophila

from the microscope stage, being sucked
Wholeheartedly into this pulsating wisdom.

One must tear down walls,
They say, before one may build bridges,

the process engulfing aeons and generations.

Nothing penetrates our inexuviable skin.

With the blink
of a mutant melanogaster eye
Come the etherized ends of others.

Of course, the mosaic vision of the fruit fly
(so they say) is never interrupted by an

Indeterminate wink;

Homo sapiens, however, is quite vulnerable

to this momentary loss of vision.

The walls come tumbling down.
