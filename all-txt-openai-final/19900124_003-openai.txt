Not so long ago, in a galaxy not
so far away, America’s number
1 pizza delivery company
made students an offer:

if your
group orders
more
pizzas than competing groups,
you'll win a free pizza party.

It’s so easy to play. Call your
nearest Domino’s Pizza store
for details.

Domino's
Pizza
Delivers...

The
Contest:

Domino's Pizza will award,
free, 30 large pizzas and
$50.00 cash for liquid
refreshments to the dorm
purchasing the most pizzas
starting Jan. 15 and
running through Feb. 28, 1990.

Some dorms may be
divided or combined at the
discretion of Domino's
Pizza to make the contest
as equal as possible. Call
896-8007 for details.

The
Rules:

1. Carry-out orders and
all deliveries made
from your area’s
Domino’s Pizza store
will be counted if we
are given your group's
name and address.

2. Any pizza over $10.00
will be counted twice.

3. The winning group’s
name will be published
in the local newspaper.

4. The location and time
of the party will be
convenient to both the
winners and Domino’s
Pizza.

5. The 30 pizzas will be
two-item pizzas. The
winner will have the
choice of items. The
pizzas do not have to
be the same.
