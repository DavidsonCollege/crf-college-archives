**Reports From the Locker Room: An Athletic Department Renaissance**

I believe it was two years ago during the NCAA basketball tournament that Al McGuire said, “Lefty Driesell had a
dynasty at Davidson—not Maryland,” as the champions-to-be Indiana Hoosiers walloped Lefty’s Terps. Lefty enjoyed the dynasty of which Al spoke
in the late sixties, but after Driesell’s departure, the empire gradually crumbled. When Terry Holland left, it fell into oblivion.
The names of former Davidson coaches were a Who’s Who of Charlotte unemployment lines.

During the years from Holland's departure in 1974 to 1981, the Davidson Athletic Department experienced a period of athletic impotence,
a sort of Dark Age. Johnston Gym was a feudal state in which coaches and athletic directors were deposed like
so many puppets. For a while, the names of former Davidson coaches were a Who’s Who of Charlotte unemployment lines.
If they weren’t to be found there, one might try the nearest NCAA Championship or Coach of the Year listing.
Basketball was a consistent 5-22. Soccer had a few 0-26 seasons. Women’s sports were just getting off the ground, and
slowly at that. There weren’t too many teams to really get behind and cheer for.

Eighteen months ago Eddie Biedenbach’s basketball program seemed to be pulling out of the tailspin, soccer had had a winning
season, field hockey had gone to Nationals, and things in general were looking up. Then, on a quiet Sunday morning,
the axe fell. Biedenbach was fired, and basketball went through three coaches in ten days. In June, three basketball players
left the school before honor charges could be brought against them. It all reached a dizzying tumult when Athletic Director
Eugene B. Bingham resigned amid controversy.

Ed Farrell took over as acting Athletic Director, put all the turmoil behind him, and aired out the department. It
marked a new era in Davidson athletics.

Certainly, in those dark, stormy years, no dynasties loomed on the horizon. Davidson had no overwhelming success in any sport.
In September of 1982, however, Davidson’s athletic department is standing on the edge of a veritable renaissance.

**Soccer**

Last year Charlie Slagle was named Southern Conference Coach of the Year after he piloted his young squad to a
13-9 record, 6-2 in the conference. Those thirteen wins are the most a Davidson soccer team has ever won, and
the 6-2 conference record left the Cats in second place at season’s end. As Davidson College soccer history would have
it, that would normally be a tall, if not impossible, order to top. Not so in 1982. The Cats, boasting
their most potent offense ever, are strong contenders for a Southern Conference championship this year. Davidson is off to a
3-0-1 start, including a 1-0 win over conference foe Western Carolina. Appalachian State, the perennial conference powerhouse and brief visitor
into the national limelight, is off to a 1-4 start.

The soccer team’s strong contention for an SC title is not a one-year fluke. Slagle, through a network of coaching
friends and acquaintances up and down the eastern seaboard, is bringing in better recruits each year. For a change, the
starters are able to go all-out, safe in the knowledge that quality reinforcements are waiting on the sideline. Next year’s
team will have a strong nucleus of returning upperclassmen with one or two freshmen sprinkled in the starting unit. It
is an ideal situation for the long-term maintenance of a consistently good soccer program. Hats off to Charlie Slagle and
the 1982 Wildcats.

**Field Hockey**

Two years ago Dee Mayes coached the field hockey team to the AIAW National Tournament, the first time a Davidson
team outside College Bowl had visited national competition in years. Last year, amid high hopes for a repeat performance of
1980, the Lady Cats struggled through an 0-6 start due mainly to inexperience, injury, and graduation. The second half of
the season was a complete turnaround as the team rolled to the state finals before losing to twice-beaten High Point.
This year there’s good news and there’s bad news. The good news is they’re off to a...2-0 start. Last Wednesday
they crushed Wake Forest 3-0, and Saturday they looked even better as they ran away from the Charlotte Flickers, 5-1.
More good news is that Carol Heppner, who scored 20 goals in her first two seasons, is back after last
year’s injury. Her return will ease pressure on super-player Amy Crittenberger and add scoring punch to the front line. Better
yet, the team is by no means young—there are several sophomore and junior starters. The dissolution of the AIAW is
the only bad news. For Davidson, that means competing on the Division I level of the NCAA against full scholarship
schools. The realignment will make regional success a difficulty, not an impossibility, however.

Football
Despite the opening-day embarrassment against Wofford, the football team stands in good shape to go 6-4. Keep in mind that
only three Davidson teams have won more than six games and Davidson has never fielded an eight-or-better game winner. The
offensive line fared much better against Georgetown last weekend and promises to flow better against Newberry tomorrow. Once Bob Miller
returns to the lineup, the team will be ready to go. The defense, a vulnerable spot in preseason estimates, has
played outstanding ball. The kicking game remains the only Achilles’ heel, but will improve as the season continues. Again, the
recruits get better each year, so continued success is on the horizon.

Basketball
Nowhere has improvement been so drastic as in Bobby Hussey’s basketball program. Last year at this time Bobby Hussey was
staring the possibility of a 5-22 season dead in the eye. He had two returning starters and a bunch of
supposedly second-rate Southern Conference players to work with, and by season’s end he had molded them into a first-rate team.
Brian Rowan, Cliff Tribus, and Kenny Wilson, who had been lost souls in the Eddie Biedenbach program, became All-Conference caliber
under Hussey. This fall Hussey and his miracle-wielding assistants have brought in seven outstanding freshmen who will challenge the four
returning starters for their positions. The combination of nine players with a year of Hussey under their belts and added
depth should put the Cats in the thick of the Conference title race and may well give them a berth
in the NCAA playoffs. The only problem is the incredibly rugged schedule, which includes the season opener at DePaul. And
if you think these freshmen are good, wait ’til you see what they want for next year! From the new
poster to a great schedule to outstanding recruits, Davidson basketball is on the move.

Baseball
Baseball has not been very, very good to Davidson. George Greir, however, is of a mind to change that. He
comes from an excellent background in baseball, and last year he set the Wildcat program off on the right foot.
Greir, in the mold of Earl Weaver, stressed sound fundamentals, which, once they take root in the program, will eventually
lead to more wins. Add to that an extraordinary recruiting ability (he gets quality players on virtually no money), and
the baseball team is in the same position the soccer team was a few years ago. Given time, the Davidson
baseball program will become a Southern Conference title contender.

Tennis
The men’s and women’s tennis programs are almost undoubtedly Davidson’s most consistent programs. This year they will probably improve. Last
year, the men’s tennis team was young. For a good while freshman Sedge Grey was the number-one player and doing
admirably. This year’s team, well-stocked with juniors and seniors (and don’t forget Sedge with a year’s college experience behind him)
promises to be extremely competitive with the possibility of numerous upsets. The women’s team lost Emmy Knoblock, its first All-American,
to graduation, but there are able players to fill her shoes. Under first-year coach Caroline Brown, the women are strong
throughout the lineup and not inexperienced. Look for another outstanding year.
