**Cats continue slump**

By MIKE ADAMS

The Furman Paladins ran up a 35-0 lead in the first half en route to giving the Davidson football team
a 58-7 walloping at Richardson Stadium on Saturday. Furman flanker Chas Fox contributed greatly to the Wildcats' woes with 6
receptions for 115 yards in the first half. Three of his catches went for touchdowns, including an 11-yard score on
the Paladins' first drive of the game.

The Cats were overmatched both offensively and defensively by Furman. The Paladins piled up 374 yards rushing and 179 yards
passing, while Davidson had only 186 yards of total defense. Junior Jack McCollum started at quarterback for Davidson. He completed
3 of 8 passes for 28 yards and rushed for 23 yards on 5 carries. The Cats could generate no
offensive momentum under him, however, and he was replaced by sophomore Charlie Winborne in the second quarter. Winborne completed 3
passes in 6 attempts while throwing an interception.

Junior Steve Bradley directed the Cats’ offense in the second half. He completed only 8 of 22 attempts, but he
did help salvage a little Wildcat pride with an 80-yard third-quarter scoring drive. Bradley completed 6 of 10 attempts on
the share-the-wealth drive which saw four receivers catch passes. Senior Jay Poag — back after missing the Newberry game because
of an injury — caught 2 passes. Freshman Bryan Overcash also caught two passes, including a superb catch in traffic
for a first down. Sophomore Don Davis made a leaping catch for another first down on the new play. Sophomore
Aaron Edwards got the touchdown when he beat his defender by two steps to get open in the end zone.

The Cats were again restricted to a passing-only offense. The Davidson rushing attack netted only 30 yards on 27 carries.
Despite the 58-7 score, the Wildcats did not have a really bad defensive effort. Furman just had too many offensive
tools to use. Junior defensive end Marcus Allen was the Cats' defensive leader on the basis of one first-quarter tackle.
On their first play of their third possession of the game, the Paladins attempted a sweep to Allen’s side. Allen
read the play perfectly and was waiting for the unfortunate Furman ball carrier when he turned the corner. Allen, who
at 6’1” and 225 pounds, bench presses 435 pounds, hit the ball carrier chest high with an audible crunch heard
to the far corners of Richardson Stadium. Senior defensive back Tony Smith also played well. He made several unassisted tackles
on Furman sweeps.

One way in which the superiority of Furman took its toll on Davidson was in the rash of injuries suffered
by the Cats. For a while in the second half, it appeared as if Davidson might run out of warm
bodies to finish the game. The Cats travel to Charleston on Saturday to play the Citadel. This game should prove
to be another tough one for Davidson. The rest of the October schedule looks no better with games against Pennsylvania
— the 1984 Ivy League Champs — and James Madison.

Davidson’s soccer team suffered through a frustrating week that saw the team have a winless week for the first time
in a month. What made the week especially frustrating is that Davidson didn’t play poorly in either game. Last Saturday,
Davidson lost to Furman 2-1. On Monday, Davidson tied UNCC 0-0. The week left Davidson 4-5-2 on the season. The
Cats are still 2-0 in the conference because Furman and Davidson are in opposite divisions.

The outcome last Saturday in Pembroke, North Carolina was a familiar one: Davidson’s women’s cross-country team — first, the opposition...
well, you’re all Davidson students, you figure it out. The men’s team surprised itself for the second week in a
row, finishing behind Pembroke State University (PSU). The race served as the qualifying race for the NAIA National Championship. Senior
Rob Watkins spoke for the team when he commented, “It was like one of those days when you get in
your occasionally unre...”

Bradley completed 6 of 10 attempts on the share-the-wealth drive which saw four receivers catch passes. Senior Jay Poag —
back after missing the Newberry game because of an injury — caught two passes. Freshman Bryan Overcash also caught two
passes, including a superb catch in traffic for a first down. Sophomore Don Davis made a leaping catch for another
first down.On the new play, sophomore Aaron Edwards got the touchdown when he beat his defender by two steps to
get open in the end zone. Sophomore Don Bergsma shows his soccer acumen.

UNCC stop Cats in their tracks

The game matched the two teams most likely to reach the conference title bout. Yet if this game was a
preview of the conference championship, Davidson will again fail to net a Southern Conference title. The key play in the
first half, and possibly in the game, came after twenty minutes of play. Furman controlled the ball near Davidson’s goal.
In the midst of the melee, a Furman player was fouled in the penalty box and Furman received a penalty
kick. The call was unusual because the linesman, not the referee, whistled for the foul. Furman took advantage of the
penalty and had a 1-0 lead.

“Falling behind hurts our defense,” coach Charlie Slagle said. “When we are behind, we are forced to spread our defense
out. Falling behind allowed Furman to dictate the style of defense we needed to play.”

In the second half, Davidson knotted the score at one apiece on a direct free kick by sophomore Steve Ott.
Davidson had been attacking well all game, but was unable to score until Ott’s rocket. The tie didn’t last long.
Furman got a fast break moments later and scored on a diving header made possible by an unblocked cross from
the left wing.

“We're vulnerable to quick counterattacks because we aren't the fastest team around,” Slagle said. “They executed that break well and
got a solid goal. We had our chances in the game. We just need to finish better than we have.”

The Davidson-UNCC game consisted mainly of struggles in midfield and missed opportunities. Both teams had chances to score but failed.
Senior Sean Austin had a header stopped by the inside of the post. Junior goalie Jim Kelly barely deflected a
UNCC shot in overtime to preserve the 0-0 tie. Unfortunately for Davidson, freshman Tracy Hankins broke a bone in his
foot and will miss at least two weeks. Hankins had started the last three games for Davidson and will be
missed.

Sunday, Davidson hosts Georgia State, ranked 11th in the South. On Tuesday, Davidson hosts North Carolina State. N.C. State is
currently ranked 7th in the nation.

PSU runners capitalized on the Cats’ off day, placing first and third through sixth, totaling an impressive 19 points. Only
junior Greg Foreman’s second place could break up Pembroke’s domination of the first five places. Foreman’s five-mile time of 26:47
was his fastest ever on the Pembroke course and his second fastest time ever for five miles. Senior captain Frank
Hague, Watkins, freshman Bill Whitfield, and sophomore Bill Breidenstine placed seventh, eighth, ninth, and eleventh respectively; but while this represents
very tight team racing, the Cats produced too little, too late.

For the women, sophomore Kappa Peddy dominated the field. Campbell University produced the second-place runner, answering Peddy’s victory. Senior captain
Judy Dalton was third overall, breaking 20 minutes for the first time over a three-mile course. Sophomore Laura Fannin was
Davidson’s next runner in sixth place, and Davidson's victory looked wrapped up. But Campbell countered, placing seventh, eighth, and ninth,
prolonging the Cats’ wait. It was prolonged no longer as sophomores Morrow Reeves and Sarah Langly closed out the Cats’
victory and its fourth consecutive NAIA District Championship.

The women's team most likely will not be allowed to represent the district in Kenosha, Wisconsin due to an NAIA
rule preventing a district's champion from participating at nationals unless the district qualifying race has four or more teams. Since
neither the men’s nor the women’s races included four complete teams, only the top five individuals from each race will
be selected to run at nationals. Foreman (second overall in the men’s race), Peddy, and Dalton (first and third overall
in the women’s race) will represent the district.

The Cats are idle this weekend. Their next race is slated for Thursday, October 17 in Raleigh. The men will
want to avenge their loss to PSU while the women will fend off another challenge by Campbell. The meet is
the North Carolina collegiate cross-country championship, which includes teams from all North Carolina colleges.
