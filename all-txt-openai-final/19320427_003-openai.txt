DEACON TRACK TEAMS HERE TODAY

THE SPORTS PARADE

SALISBURY HI VS. FRESH FRIDAY

CAT-TALES

ODI CASALI

Davidson’s major teams seem to have reached a winning stride once more. The Wildcat track team, by defeating V.M.I., sports
a winning record. The baseball team has several more games to win before it can boast of a percentage over
the .500 mark, but from the way things looked in the last two games, Davidson’s diamond representatives seem to be
headed in the right direction, at least.

Things looked mighty gloomy to Coach “Red” Laird last Thursday, when he took his Wildcat nine to Charlotte to engage
the Hornets, and had to leave “Doc” Mathis and Bruce Peabody on the campus because the two had failed to
make the necessary average in their studies to enable them to go with the team on its trips. But the
way the substitutes performed in the Charlotte game made Laird feel better, since it revealed unknown strength to him. In
the meantime, Mathis and Peabody have studied a little harder and brought their averages above the required mark so that
now both are eligible to make trips with the team.

It certainly seems strange to us that the Davidson baseball team has been able to win only one game on
Richardson Field this season. Ordinarily, a team is more successful on its home grounds than on foreign diamonds. But the
case is just the opposite with the Wildcats. Two teams, Elon and Lenoir-Rhyne, have defeated Davidson on the local field,
but the Wildcats have avenged both losses by winning from these teams on their fields. There must be some explanation
to this.

Perhaps the fault lies in the lack of support to the team on the part of the student body. The
Davidson student body seems to have that famous Wildcat Spirit in every sport except the national pastime, which is the
most enthusiastic and lively game on the part of the spectators in most schools and communities. In order to play
its best game, a team must have the wholehearted support of its fans throughout the contest. When the players fail
to get this support, they slack in their playing and consequently lose games.

One fact which helps reveal that the Davidson team has not been getting the wholehearted support of the student body
is the failure of Davidson students to stand during the seventh inning. This is a custom which is observed in
every big league as well as most college games. Why Davidson students fail to observe it is probably because of
their lack of support to the team.

And another thing. Several Davidson students are prone to hiss at the umpire whenever he makes a wrong decision or
calls a close play contrary to their desires. These students forget that the umpire is also human and subject to
make errors just as the players themselves are. When we consider that an umpire handles about 400 chances in one
game, we find that his percentage of error is very low. Let us not forget our sportsmanship.

After meeting Wake Forest's cinder teams today, both of Davidson's track squads will see action again this weekend. The varsity
goes to Columbia, S.C., to meet the University of South Carolina next Saturday for its third engagement in eight days,
and the Davidson Freshmen will be hosts to Salisbury High here Friday.

Davidson Netmen to Meet Virginia Teams

The Davidson College tennis team left here Monday morning on the longest and most strenuous trip of the season. This
trip will carry them as far north as Richmond and will keep them away an entire week. They will play
five matches in all; the first was with Carolina on Monday, and they will meet four strong Virginia teams before
returning to Davidson. The match with Carolina was the only one in this state for the Wildcat netmen. On Tuesday,
the racquet wielders met William and Mary College at Williamsburg, Va. Today is an open day for the team and
tomorrow they will play a return match with the University of Richmond at Richmond. Friday the Wildcats will meet the
Hampden-Sydney players and Saturday they will close their tour with a match.

CAT CINDERMEN DEFEAT V.M.I.

’Cats Run Wild to Beat Lenoir-Rhyne Bears 21-2

Last Saturday afternoon the Wildcats added Lenoir-Rhyne to their string of victories on the diamond by beating the Bears 21
to 2 at Hickory. Bailey turned in a fine game, letting only seven hits be chalked up against him, while
his teammates gave him good support. The Davidson men collected 22 hits off the four pitchers that the Bears put
on the mound. Mills and Mathis led in the hitting with four hits apiece.

The ’Cats scored two runs in the first, eight in the fourth, three in the following two brackets, and six
in the final inning, to make their total of 21 runs. During the game, every Davidson man succeeded in getting
on the plate four times to retain individual scoring honors with 13. Mills also scored four times to tie with
Mathis for second honors at 10 runs apiece. Blanton, by stealing one base during the week, increased his total to
six to go into a tie with Captain Bernhardt for first place in this department. Blanton also leads in extra
base knocks with 23.

We must step aside for a moment to allow “Buck” Mills, Davidson shortstop, to have his due. Mills not only
led the attack with the willow by connecting for two triples and a single in five trips to the platter,
but he cut off two runs with a leaping one-hand stab of Rhines’ sizzling liner, with the bases full, to
complete a double play unassisted at a most opportune time.

The Davidson nine had their big inning in the second when J.D. Morrison opened up with a single. Morris was
an infield victim, Morrison going to second, and J.G. Morrison’s single taking him to third. McLean singled, Morrison scoring. Pearce
singled to fill the bases, and Bernhardt walked to force a run in. Bradsher forced McLean, and Mills crashed out
a single to tally Bernhardt, and send Bradsher to third. Bernhardt and Bradsher then pulled off a neat double steal,
with the former scoring. Blanton took a base when he was hit by a pitched ball, and J.D. Morrison grounded
out to retire the side.

The Hornets scored two in the second and one in the third frame, while Davidson scored two in the third
and one in the fourth. The Wildcats then went on a scoring spree, adding six in the fifth, three in
the sixth, and two in the seventh to complete the rout.
