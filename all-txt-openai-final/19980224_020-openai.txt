Friday vs. E. Tenn. St./Ga. Southern Noon * Greensboro Coliseum * GREENSBORO

The game: The Wildcats will face the winner of Thursday night's play-in game between Georgia Southern (9-17, 4-10 SC) and East Tennessee St. (11-15, 6-9 SC) ... Georgia Southern is the fourth seed in the South Division ... East Tennessee stands No. 5 in the North ... Davidson (17-9, 13-2 SC) is No. 1 in the North and the top overall seed in the tournament ... The contest is the first of four quarterfinals Friday at the Coliseum.

A Look at East TENNESSEE
Coach: Ed DeChellis (2nd year, 18-35)
Players to watch: Greg Stephens (6-3, Jr., G, 16.4 ppg, 4.9 rpg, 4.9 apg); Reggie Todd (6-7, Jr., F/C, 13.0 ppg, 8.1 rpg); Kyle Keeton (5-11, Jr., G, 10.5 ppg)
Noting the Bucs: ETSU won two of its last three to challenge for the third seed in the North Division ... A 74-65 loss Saturday at VMI dropped the Bucs to the fifth slot ... Stephens, a transfer from Navy, is the leading scorer in the league and one of its top overall talents ... He is a dangerous shooter, evidenced by his 27-point performance against Davidson Jan. 19 in Johnson City, Tenn. ... Against Davidson this year, the Bucs fell at home 71-58 and Feb. 9 at Davidson, 67-47 ... ETSU has fallen to the Wildcats in 21 of the 32 all-time meetings between the two schools ... Davidson dominated the Bucs in last year’s game at Belk Arena, winning by 50 points ... Having hit some hard times since the program's glory years of the late 80s and early 90s, this year’s team is East Tennessee’s best in three years ... Before this year’s league total of six wins, the Bucs had not won more than three conference games in a season since 1994-95 ... ETSU enters the tournament having won three of its last five and four of seven.

A Look at Georgia SOUTHERN
Coach: Gregg Polinsky (3rd year, 21-58)
Players to watch: Cedric McGinnis (6-8, Jr., F, 13.3 ppg, 6.3 rpg); Quincy Wright (6-8, Jr., F, 10.3 ppg, 3.6 rpg); Quentin Martin (6-4, So., G, 10.1 ppg, 3.6 rpg); Fernando Daniel (6-2, Jr., G, 7.8 ppg, 3.7 apg)
Noting the Eagles: Georgia Southern dropped to the last spot in the South thanks in part to its 75-58 loss Saturday at Davidson ... Martin paced the Eagles in the loss to the Wildcats with 13 points on 4-for-11 shooting ... Elvardo Rolle was the only other GSU player in double figures, notching 12 ... Mark Donnelly led Davidson with 15 ... Despite the less than stellar conference mark, the Eagles are a capable squad ... They swept the season series from South Division titleist and defending conference champion Chattanooga, winning 59-52 Jan. 26 in Statesboro, Ga., and 81-68 last Monday at Chattanooga, Tenn. ... Five Eagles tallied double figures in points in the latest win over the Mocs, led by Rolle’s 19 ... Other wins within Southern play: 61-54 over Furman on Jan. 12 and 65-62 at East Tennessee Feb. 2 ... Some noteworthy losses: 82-53 Nov. 21 at Illinois; 96-74 Nov. 25 at Georgia ... While GSU scores a modest 65.6 points a game, its defense has been dismal this season ... The Eagles are last in the conference in field goal percentage defense at 48.1 percent ... Opponents also shoot a league-high 42.1 percent from three-point land against the Eagles ... GSU is, however, second to VMI in steals ... Sophomore Hamp Jones is fourth in swipes per contest with 2.1.

A Look at APPALACHIAN
Coach: Barbie Breedlove (1st year, 9-16)
Players to watch: Beth Schoolfield (5-11, Jr., F, 16.1 ppg, 6.6 rpg); Tiffany Chappell (5-10, So., F, 8.6 ppg, 5.0 rpg); Noel Dolan (5-9, So., G, 8.5 ppg, 71 assists)
Noting the Mountaineers: Otherthan Schoolfield's 16.1-points-per-game clip, the Mountaineers have five players who average at least seven a contest—Chappell, Dolan, Jamie Gagliano, Natasha Lettsome, and Rachel Olander. Gagliano hauls in 7.2 boards a game, Lettsome 6.3. The Mountaineers, decimated by graduation from last year's team and preseason injuries, started the year 3-12. They then won six in a row, moving to 8-4 in the league. Since then, however, the Mountaineers have struggled, losing the last four games of the season. Appalachian is 5-5 at home, 3-8 on the road, and 1-2 on a neutral court, 5-3 when leading at halftime, and 3-12 when trailing at the break. The Mountaineers score just 61.2 points a game—worst in the league—but sport the Southern's second-best defense. Schoolfield ranks fourth in the conference in scoring.
