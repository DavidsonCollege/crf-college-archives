THE DAVIDSONIAN, MAY 22, 1930

Duke Devils Blank Wildcat Nine, 7-0

Kugler’s Great Hurling Ruined by Teammates’ Errors

Playing wide-awake and errorless baseball behind the superb pitching of Tim McKeithan, elongated sophomore hurler, the Duke University Blue Devils reversed the tables on the Davidson College Wildcats and walked away with a 7 to 0 victory. McKeithan surrendered but three hits and had the Cats at his mercy at all times. On the other hand, Captain Doc Kugler probably pitched the best game of his career, but miserable support, poor judgment, and several bone-head plays marred what would have otherwise been a great mound duel. The hard-hitting Blue Devils, five of whom have recently signed contracts with the big leagues, obtained only six bingles from the offerings of Kugler, two of which were scratches. He also bested the Duke hurler in the strikeout route, five to three. However, the Davidson infield was in terrible form, making seven of the eight errors credited against the Cats, and in that lay the cause of defeat.

SENIOR GIFT (Continued from page 1)

The gift this year is very appropriate as it completes the furnishings for the stage. The cyclorama and valance were first viewed by the student body on last Monday at chapel. Dr. Walter Lingle, President of Davidson, expressed his appreciation of the gift at that time. It will be officially presented to Davidson College at the graduation exercises in June, by W. B. McGuire, President of the Senior Class. It will be accepted on behalf of the college by Dr. Lingle. This gift was selected by the Class Gift Committee after some deliberation. This committee included R. B. Erckman, chairman; W. F. Gaffney, F. R. Brown, F. W. Johnston, and W. G. McGavock.

FINAL DETAILS (Continued from page 1)

The academic procession will form at 10 a.m. and at 10:30 o'clock the actual exercises begin. Included in this day will be addresses by the salutatorian and valedictorian of the class, presentation of additional curtains for the auditorium stage as the class gift, and the awarding of second lieutenant commissions to advanced R.O.T.C. students, and college diplomas to 104 seniors. Invitations were mailed out this week to the entire alumni body, inviting them to the exercises, and extra efforts have been made during the past months to get the members of eleven classes to return for special reunions. The alumni will have a predominating part in the program Tuesday, and the class dinners that evening, preceding a dramatic club presentation, will be the highlight of their activity.

Cats Drop Another Game to N. Carolina

Homerun With Bases Full is Feature of Game

The University of North Carolina nine took the Wildcats into camp for the second time this season when they won on their home diamond, 8-3. Cecil Longest was able to keep the eight safe blows of the Cats well scattered, whereas McInnis was wild from the start. Billy Brown was undoubtedly the feature of the game, for in the fifth inning he broke a 1-1 tie by smacking a long homer to center field with the bases filled. Besideshis homer, he garnered a single and a double out of four attempts. The Wildcat pitcher strove hard to even up for his wildness, and got two hits out of three trials. He scored two of the ’Cats’ three runs, one coming from a home run. Goodson and Parrish also got two safe knocks. The latter also added another triple to his long string of three-baggers. Box score and summary:

Pepper Leads Golf Team Next Season

Jack Pepper, Jr., of Winston-Salem, has been elected captain and manager of the Davidson College golf team for the session 1930-31. This is the second successive year that Pepper has piloted the ’Cat golfers, both as manager and as captain. With several good offerings from the Freshman Class, the Davidson team next year will be much stronger than the past season. Pepper was one of the mainstays on the Davidson foursome this spring. He is the champion individual golfer of North Carolina golfers, having been the low medalist in the state meet at Greensboro when the tourney was staged on the Sedgefield course there the latter part of April.

Handbook Dedicated To Mr. F. L. Jackson

The “Wildcat Handbook” for 1930 will be dedicated to F. L. Jackson, treasurer of the college, according to an announcement recently made by Paul Alderman, editor. There will be 800 copies printed this year, and the freshmen will receive theirs at least by August 5. The upperclassmen may obtain their copies upon their arriving at school next fall. On the whole, the Handbook will be essentially the same as it was last year, with the exception of a little different cover design. One new feature will be intramural sports. On account of an addition to the numbers of cuts and advertisements, there will be twelve or fifteen more pages this year.

Beta Theta Pi Wins Finals in Baseball

In the finals of the inter-fraternity baseball tournament, Beta Theta Pi won from Pi Kappa Phi by the score of 6-5. Johnston, pitching for the Betas, held the Pi Kappa Phis scoreless until the fifth inning when they staged a rally and scored several runs, but barely fell short of the mark. In previous games the Betas defeated the S. P. E.’s, A. O.’s and K. A.’s. Johnston and Beacham were the usual battery except in the game with the Alpha Omegas, in which Ballard occupied the mound. To reach the finals the Pi Kappa Phis defeated the Kappa Sigs, 5-4.

...in a cigarette It’s GETTING DOWN to brass tacks, a cigarette is a smoke — made and bought for your own enjoyment. But between just something to smoke, and tobacco character, richness, delicate aroma—in short, something to taste—well, that’s the difference that accounts for Chesterfield’s ever-mounting popularity.
