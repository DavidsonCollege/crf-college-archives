THE DAVIDSONIAN:

BASED ON A POEM
BY JOHN A. ENGEL
SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE
ROBERT ANDERS NILSSON

IN XANADU DID DR. KUBLA K.
A BAKER SPORTS COMPLEX DECREE

WHERE NORMAN, THE SACRED RIVER, RAN
THROUGH CONDOS MEASURELESS TO MAN
DOWN TO A SUNLESS SEA

SO TWICE FIVE MILES OF FERTILE GROUND
WITH WALLS AND TOWERS WERE GIRDLED ROUND:

AND THERE

WERE GARDENS BRIGHT WITH SINUOUS RILLS,
WHERE BLOSSOMED MANY AN INCENSE-BEARING TREE,

AND HERE WERE FORESTS ANCIENT AS THE HILLS
ENFOLDING SUNNY SPOTS OF GREENERY

IT WAS A MIRACLE OF RARE DEVICE,
A SUNNY PLEASURE DOME WITH CAVES OF ICE!

WEAVE A CIRCLE ROUND HIM THRICE
AND CLOSE YOUR EYES WITH HOLY DREAD
FOR HE ON HONEYDEW HATH FED,
AND DRUNK THE MILK OF PARADISE.

that often deal with his own personal experiences and events.
Davidson composers not only write about different subjects, they also express themselves through unique styles. Freshman Less Lincoln has a
reputation for a particularly original musical style that even he can’t find the words to describe. “I don’t want to
call it jazz, synthesized or new age, so what do you call it?”

Lincoln plays a synthesizer with a multi-tumbler sound unit and a keyboard attached to an IBM model 30. He composes
original music with the synthesizer, even though he has never taken piano lessons and only completed his collection of technical
equipment over Christmas.

Lincoln said he composed his favorite song while “sitting around” on Valentine’s Day. “Whenever there’s something that hits me, everything
else simply falls by the wayside. I must get the emotion out.”

Sophomore John Morris said, “I write whatever I think people will like and what will be really bizarre.” Greatly influenced
by REM, Morris performs his music with the band Rumpus, which played for last year’s Amnesty International concert, FAC’s and
several fraternity parties.

Seniors Frank Whitaker and Jay Barron, famous for their mellow musical styles, borrow techniques from favorite composers and add a
country flavor. Both Whitaker and Barron are inspired by the music of James Taylor and U2.

One of Davidson’s newest composers, freshman Croft Stone, composed his first song last spring. He wrote Full Circle to share
an experience that gave him “a very profound awareness of the sanctity of life and existence.”

Stone’s favorite song is Mr. Free, which he composed for a friend.

“Your hair’s blowing in the breeze, you’re Mr. Free
And when I look, all I see is who I'd like to be
Please take me with you, I can
Please don’t leave me all alone in this plastic land.”
