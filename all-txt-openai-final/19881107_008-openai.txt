Fragments of Heaviness: Pressure Pierced

On Selwyn street sun drenched in rain,
Domed at dusk in yesterday’s dream,
Gordian twined, I turned
Light-lorn in heavy cords of hope.
This is the role of heaviness:
To dredge up fossil fish
On bending chains.
From bottomless pools
Thick skin; time crusted—
Heaviness heaves its silent power,
Brooding out of wet millennia.

Things blotted leave no mere murmurs.

No muffled whispers echo in memory’s charnel house;
But Bacon’s mouths triply crucified on Tate’s walls:
Bloated round in screams and teeth,

Their tongues severed and wriggling.

In Newnham her reeds were razed,

With ice—pressure pounded.

The window glaze girded her in frost.

No one heard the cries swell inside

That seemed but golden sighs

Rung round that golden mouth.

She felt the heavy women trod amid the arch

And heard yesterday click away in closed grey
But no one heard her head explode.
On a sun poured summer afternoon:
Oven bubbled beauty
Cords too soon cut.

Another day and moments hang

Like red muscle and blood on meat hooks,
Static but dripping...

Anxious in the cold blue dim.
