**State tuition grants stir controversy**
By LYMAN COLLINS
News Editor

Due to recent editorials in The Charlotte Observer and elsewhere, an increasing amount of attention is focusing upon state grants
to private colleges and universities in North Carolina. Davidson College President Samuel R. Spencer Jr. has been instrumental in instituting
the program of grants to North Carolina students attending the state’s 39 private institutions of higher learning.

Spencer explained that there are actually two programs in effect. Under the first, each private college is given an amount
equivalent to $200 per North Carolina student which is then redistributed to North Carolina students on the basis of need.
The second program is the Tuition Offset Grant under which every North Carolina student is granted $200 regardless of need.

The North Carolina Association of Independent Colleges and Universities is seeking to increase the amount awarded under the Tuition Offset
Grant by $100 for next year. This proposed increase has stirred considerable controversy. Charlotte Observer publisher Rolfe Neill concluded a
recent editorial saying, “if forced to choose (between increased state aid or closing private schools) I have to say close
the private schools—as long as public institutions are not getting all that they need from the legislature.”

Spencer pointed out, however, that the distinction between private and public institutions can only be made in reference to control.
“Private and state-supported colleges are chartered by North Carolina and have no other function than the public good,” he said.
“In terms of function both are public institutions.”

Spencer pointed out that although it is cheaper for the individual students at state universities, it is not cheaper for
the taxpayer. State subsidies to public schools amount to about $2000 per student compared with subsidies at private schools of
$400 per student. “If a private college goes out of business their students automatically become ‘wards of the state’ and
must be subsidized at the state school,” explained Spencer.

Spencer pointed out that private schools have long played a significant role in the educational landscape of North Carolina.

**Leaders initiate Forum and promise more cooperation**

The Inter-Organizational Forum held its initial meeting this week and discussed topics relating to campus and community life. The IOF
is a group organized for the purpose of communicating ideas between various student organizations on campus. Its meetings are loose
and discussion-oriented. Student body president Thom Young added to this by stating that “keeping the IOF informal will pull the
organization on its feet” and make it more effective at Davidson.

The IOF is also concerned with coordinating programs of common interest on campus. Its representatives can better schedule activities, work
closely on campus-wide programs, and mobilize quickly and fully on important issues which may arise.

Dean Will Terry’s suggestion for the creation of an arts and crafts center was the major topic of discussion. Members
of the IOF contributed their opinions and ideas for such a center on the Davidson campus. YM/YWCA President Jay Silver
said, “A lot of tutors run out of things to do with their kids.” He stated that an arts and
crafts center on campus would give tutors more activities for the kids. “It would also keep the kids out of
the dorm, which has been a problem lately,” said Silver. Silver also stated that an arts and crafts center would
be “a good alternative for students on Friday and Saturday nights.”

an outlet as the center to occupy their spare time. Union Board President Billy Hutchings offered to find a way
to finance the center under Union funds if the need was strong enough. Young suggested running a petition for student
interest to be distributed during Senate visitations to dorms. The Davidsonian editor Cathy Landis offered to run a publicity poll
for interest in the arts and crafts center in the newspaper or a feature on the need for such a
center. Landis said, “The IOF can help to alleviate conflicts of interests at Davidson by its members talking together.” DCF
representative Sue Murdaugh also stated that the 200 people in DCF wanted to get involved on campus but didn’t know
how, and the IOF could help in this area. The IOF is most importantly a wealth of information. “All the
organizations coming together in one spot can give you just about any kind of information you need,” asserted Landis. Plans
for the IOF’s next meeting are on January 24.

...played a pivotal role in the history of higher education providing needed diversity and freedom of choice. W.A. Johnson, who
sits on the Board of Governors of the University of North Carolina, sees state aid as a threat to private
schools. “Already we have reached the point where it is no longer entirely accurate to consider the private institutions as
strictly private in character,” he writes. “Increasingly they are acquiring quasi-public status.” He argues that increasing state aid will lead
to increasing state control. “They must be preserved as free and independent private institutions, otherwise they shall lose those very
attributes and characteristics which make them so unique and so valuable to our system of higher education,” Johnson proclaims.

Spencer points out that the private colleges are not competing for funds with the state schools. “As we plan for
the future, the independent colleges come to you as partners—not adversaries—in the educational enterprise,” concluded Spencer.

EMPTY ART GALLERY awaits Tuesday’s opening in remodeled banquet hall. (Hunter Jennings)

Gallery Opening

This coming Tuesday, the new Davidson College Art Gallery/multi-purpose room will open in the old Chambers Banquet Hall. “The hall
is ready, except for some last-minute details,” according to Herb Jackson who supervises the planning and the development of the
gallery itself. “Visitors should be pleasantly surprised by the quality of the work.” The gallery will be used to show
off the permanent collection of Davidson art. A large quantity of work has been done by people associated with the
college and has since been ignored. This will be the first chance to exhibit these collected works. Some of the
work has never been viewed before by the public. On Tuesday, in addition to the permanent collection, there will be
an exhibition of handmade furniture entitled, “Art as Furniture as Art,” by Bob Kopf. This will be only the first
of many exhibits. In addition to serving as an art gallery, the facility will resume its old function as a
place for meals on special occasions and for coffee and cokes. The physical transformation should provide a more pleasurable environment
for these activities. “The old banquet hall no longer looks like a dungeon but is a beautiful facility. It is
sure to be one of the most popular places on campus,” concluded Jackson.
