Boys Bereft of Boarding House by Barnes’ Closing. The boys boarding at Mrs. Barnes' boarding house were quite surprised when
it was announced at dinner Friday that the Club would be closed for several days. This was made necessary by
the illness of Miss Florence Barnes and her mother, the former having a slight attack of “flu.” Practically all the
boys secured places at other boarding houses, while a few are trying “Smiley's.” All the boys who board at Mrs.
Barnes wish her and her daughter a speedy recovery.

TOWN NEWS. Mrs. Barnes and Miss Florence Barnes are not considered to be very sick and it is thought that
they will soon be able to re-open their boarding house. The Misses Schofield are rapidly recovering from cases of influenza.
Mrs. White has been forced to close her boarding house temporarily as she has contracted “flu.” The Davidson Graded School
was closed last Thursday.

Our Training School for Life Insurance Salesmen recently produced $308,000 in forty-five days. During the same period twenty-eight Training School
men produced $2,694,000, an average of $92,000 per man. When an agent signs a contract with the Southern Life and
Trust Company, we don't pat him on the back, turn him loose and tell him to “go to it.” We
give him a preliminary correspondence course, and then a course in our Training School at the Home Office, and then
keep in touch with him and help him overcome his weak points and strengthen his strong points. As a result,
our Training School men are making good. Drop us a line and ask us to give you full particulars.
