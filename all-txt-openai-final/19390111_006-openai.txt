EXAMINATION SCHEDULE FIRST SEMESTER 1938-1939 The works are of the widest variety imaginable, ranging from Dr. Frazer Hood's “History of the United States Army Hospital Number 1” to Dr. Howard Bell Arbuckle’s “Remedy for Stomach Worms in Sheep.” Longest title is Dr. C. R. Harding’s “Attempt at Rebuttal of Some of the Arguments against the Saint John Authorship of the Fourth Gospel.” A close second is his “Study and Criticism of Edward Gordon’s Interpretation of Virgil's Fourth Eclogue.” Dr. Harding also seems to be the only poet on the faculty—at least he is the only one whose verse is recorded as having been published. A hymn and an ode to Davidson College have proceeded from his pen. Professor Chalmers Davidson and President Walter Lee Lingle have written articles for the Dictionary of American Biography. Faculty members Arbuckle, Brown, Cumming, Foreman, Hillhouse, Lingle, Vowles, and Watts are experienced reviewers. Covering a wide range of subjects, the Davidson faculty has contributed to the great mass of the printed word.

George Jones, Stephenson. Kemp will fill an engagement until the day before the ceremony. He will be in Cincinnati on a sort of extended honeymoon when playing here. Featured with the orchestra will be the voices of lovely Judy Starr, Songbird of the South, Bob Allen, romantic young stylist, Saxie Dowson Northcross.

Only relatively late in human history have people been able to think before they speak and speak before they act. Most of us still do it rather infrequently and with rather indifferent success. Miami University’s Dr. Read Bain believes we are suffering from “acute but highly contagious blabitis.”

“In the process of Americanizing our education we have really, without knowing it, drifted away from our older American tradition. Nationalism, even if it is Americanism, is not liberalism. It very easily becomes the opposite.” Dean Christian Gauss of Princeton University deplores the decline of the study of the humanities.

A word to the wise is useless. Easy success is not permanent.

CHESTERFIELDS the Happy Combination for More Smoking Pleasure
More smokers every day are turning to Chesterfield’s happy combination of mild ripe American and aromatic Turkish tobaccos—the world’s best cigarettes. When you try them you will know why Chesterfields give millions of men and women more smoking pleasure... why THEY SATISFY.

In addition to these, contests will be staged to feature the musical ability and general talent of the villagers. Late in the afternoon the villagers will have an old-fashioned barbecue supper which is to be paid for out of the church Birthday Fund of which Mr. A. J. Farrington is treasurer. The members of Unity Church have a unique plan whereby all members pay a penny for each year of his age on his birthday, and when enough money has been accumulated the whole church enjoys an outing somewhere.

The climax to the day will come in the evening program of which Mr. Willie Gant is in charge. The Boy Scouts will hold a public Court of Awards after which prizes will be awarded to the winners of the contests held in the afternoon. Under the direction of Chal Vinson, the play “Neighbors,” by Zona Gale, will be presented by the Women’s Bible class in the high school auditorium where the Court of Awards also will be held.

Directing the Village Recreation Council program are Ivan Stafford, director; Willie Gant, chairman; Mrs. B. B. Mayhew, treasurer; J. A. Farrington, Craven Howard, Miss Ollie Farrington, Miss Sybil Stone, and in addition several members of the Davidson student body. This field day is only a part of the program of the Unity Church under its pastor Watson Street.

“Y” EVENTS
Goodness, faith, meekness, and temperance. If we have these, of course we will want to share them with others, and our generosity will be limited only by our bank-book. If the students here do not exhibit these qualities, the “Y” has fallen down on its job. We have failed to make Christ real to the students. Gentlemen, we have failed you. We have not shown you how Christ can become real to you. We ask your forgiveness and your future cooperation. We cannot do it by ourselves. You have reached the age where you not only feed yourselves, but you operate your own boarding houses. It should be the same with that spiritual food which is so needed for all of us. Don’t think that you can go through life having religion fed to you with a spoon. Have your own religious experience. That doesn’t mean you have to go to revivals. The greatest religious experiences come when we are on our knees before God, beseeching him to lighten our darkness, to give us wisdom, and to make us want to do his will. Christ said, “Him that cometh unto me I will in no wise cast out.” Why don’t you come to him? He has already come far more than halfway. You have only a step.

Don’t confuse action with progress.
