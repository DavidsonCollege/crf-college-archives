THE MEMBERS OF Davidson Methodist Church EXTEND TO YOU A CORDIAL INVITATION TO HONORING METHODIST STUDENTS SUNDAY EVENING, OCTOBER 7, 1951 FOLLOWING VESPERS

Series Get Underway October 29th
The Charlotte Symphony Orchestra’s 1951-52 concert series will begin on October 29 and continue through April 1, according to an announcement coming from Mrs. Charles M. Hassell, of Charlotte, the president of the symphony society. Mrs. Dorothy Herring, secretary to James Christian Pfohl of Davidson College, has been made chairman from Davidson for the annual campaign now being conducted for Symphony memberships for the season.

The most impressive program in the history of the orchestra has been scheduled by James Christian Pfohl, the Symphony conductor. This year the orchestra will be composed of 60 members, a number of the players being members of the music faculty and music students at Davidson College. During the season six regular programs will be given and in order that more people can attend the program and ticket holders may have a choice of nights to attend, each concert will be given on two successive nights. The programs will be held on Mondays and Tuesdays in the auditorium of the Piedmont Junior High School.

Some of the most outstanding artists appearing before the public today will be featured in the series as guest performers. The artists are: Gina Bachauer, Greek pianist, who made an unheralded debut in New York last winter and became the most talked of pianist of the season; Suzanne Danco, Belgian soprano, who has been widely acclaimed for her ravishing beauty of voice, supreme artistry and profound musicianship; Andrew White, concert opera and radio baritone, who has captivated his audiences wherever he appears; Ruggiero Ricci, brilliant young American violinist, who has been acclaimed as an “unquestioned master;” and Louise Nelson Pfohl, pianist, who is well known for her versatility as a pianist.

Adult season tickets are $8.00. A special season rate of $4.00 has been made to students of college age and under. Davidson music lovers may obtain further information and tickets from Mrs. Herring.

STUDENT RED FEATHER GIFT AIDS
It isn't just the crowded city areas that need the 21 Red Feather Services of our Community Chest. Most of these services are equally needed—and used—by residents of county towns and neighborhoods. The most remote home in Mecklenburg County is less than 30 minutes from the nearest Red Feather Service. In these homes, illness or physical handicap may enter. Family worries and child problems may come. Young peoplewill need the health-building, character-building programs of the Girl Scout and other youth services. All over Mecklenburg, there are people who are using Community Chest Red Feather Services. A third of all Girl Scouts in Mecklenburg County live outside Charlotte and belong to the 26 county scout troops. Davidson has 3 troops, Huntersville 1, Cornelius 4, Derita 2, Paw Creek 1, Sharon Church 3, Sardis Church 3, Craig Avenue Church 1, Matthews 2, Morris Field 1, Mulberry Church 2, Homestead Church 1, and Pleasant Grove Church 2. This past year it required an investment of nearly $5,000 or $200 per troop, to keep the Girl Scout program alert and effective in these county communities. These expenditures were carefully reviewed by the Chest Budget Committee and approved as the very minimum needed. This investment made it possible to recruit and train the many volunteers, promote activities such as troop and day camping, and maintain the Girl Scout office with its small but necessary clerical and executive staff.

Sixty children were cared for in temporary foster homes last year by Family and Children’s Service. Fifty were placed for adoption. In all, 1402 Mecklenburg families were served. Four hundred and nine of these persons lived outside Charlotte. Aid given by this vital Red Feather Service also includes counseling on personal and family troubles, or on problems caused by illness or absence of parents, aid to homeless babies and unmarried mothers—legal advice (through the cooperation of the Mecklenburg Bar Association)—emergency financial aid—care of neglected children and vocational guidance.

FRIDAY, OCTOBER 5, 1951

Twenty-five per cent of the nation’s hospital beds are occupied today by mental patients. The Charlotte Mental Hygiene Clinic exists to reduce mental illness. It pursues this aim by treating those who are already sick, by prevention in the case of those likely to become sick, and by educating the public to better understanding of the causes and effects of mental illness. Thirty-four of its clients this past year were from county communities.

The Mecklenburg Association for the Blind works to prevent blindness, aids the visually handicapped, and assists in making life more satisfying for the blind of the entire county. In all, 98 children and adults from rural Mecklenburg were supplied with artificial eyes, repairs on glasses, or benefited through eye examination and surgery. These are only a few of the services active all over our county. The important fact is that they are needed. Other services like the Salvation Army, the YMCA, and YWCA serve us all by making our County a better place in which to live. Also included in the Chest budget this year is the U.S.O., which watches over the welfare and boosts the morale of our youth in service throughout the world, assuring them this home away from home. Another Red Feather Service is the Children’s Home Society of North Carolina, which cares for homeless babies and places them in adoptive homes.
