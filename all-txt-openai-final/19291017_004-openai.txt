ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT STEP

The present visit of the Right Honorable J. Ramsay MacDonald, Prime Minister of the British Empire, to these shores is
one of tremendous importance to the cause of peace. It is to be taken, we trust, as an indication that
the days of national vanity and selfish progress are fading away. We admit freely that it is impractical to dream
of the time when all nations will forget themselves in the call to common service. While divisions as separate governments
exist, the element of human nature will assert itself in the dangerous sport of competition in every field, and the
world will never quite be safe from the military madness of some “High Command.” But the idea is to work
along constructive lines, relegating the pessimistic possibilities, or facts, if you wish, to the background. Only by visualizing and striving
to vitalize a world conception of peace and goodwill can any group hope to promote an effective peace. So let
us join wholeheartedly the ranks of those who see in the trend of recent diplomatic relationships the nebulous form of
Peace triumphant.

The Disarmament Conference of 1924, whether immediately effectual or not, was a step in the right direction, and the Kellogg
pact has evidenced strength and purpose. Geneva still stands as a haven from strife, breathing out the spirit of Woodrow
Wilson and immortalizing his vision. Now comes Great Britain’s gesture, her evident desire to come to a better understanding with
her blood brothers, to straighten out vague doubts as to her sincerity in the imminent question of disarmament, to ascertain
for herself just what America’s intentions are, and through it all to “enthrone peace all over the world.” It was
indeed a promising event when Mr. Hoover took the hand of the Scotchman and greeted him for the American people.

In his address before the Council on Foreign Relations in New York last Friday evening, Mr. McDonald said just about
what had been expected of him. He strongly affirmed that every action taken by both parties had been absolutely open
and above board, and that it was the great hope of the peace forces that the understanding they are trying
to establish will soon become the common possession of all the nations on the face of the earth. He strikes
an epic note by declaring that until moral disarmament has been effected, there can be no hope of physical disarmament,
and it takes no deductive reasoning to see that in that statement lies one of the most vital elements in
the quest for peace. He says that so far as the navies of the United States and of Great Britain
are concerned, that there shall be parity between the two, a state of “absolute equilibrium,” so that the element of
competition, conducive to national war-mindedness, shall be eliminated. He appeals to “national honor” to preserve the power of the Kellogg
Pact, and he predicts success in the new disarmament conference to be called next January, at which the five representative
naval powers will be in attendance. MacDonald believes that a world peace is in the offing.

The frankness of the man, his deep sincerity, and his determined effort to develop the spiritual side of the peace
movement lead us to believe that something of permanent value will come out of the whole project. One striking evidence
of the Prime Minister’s searching insight into the problems at hand and of his realization that the nations concerned must
fully understand the feelings of each other, is the way in which he presents the sea as a living part
of Britain. It seems to us that his declaration is not a cloak of words to blind the better judgment
of Americans, but a human expression, typical of many elements in the makeup of both nations, elements which must be
rightly interpreted if harmony is to result. Says MacDonald:

“For instance, in our case, our navy is the very life of our nation. We have romance surrounding it. We
are a people of the sea. We are a small island. Europe is at our doors for good or for
ill. The lions of our empire have been thrown all over the face of the earth. We have to import
our food. A month’s blockade, effectively carried out, would starve us all. Great powers on the Continent trust to their
land forces. Our land forces must always be a secondary force in the event of any conflict. Great Britain’s navy
is Great Britain itself. As I said, we are a people of the sea, and the sea is our security
and our safety. Ah, my American friends, I hope that your imagination will enable you to see the affection, the
real understandable, human affection that is gathered around our ships of the sea when we look into the future, and
how hard it is to get the British people to feel security if the naval arm is limited in any
way whatever. I put it in front of you, not as a final word, but as a plea for understanding,
a plea for patience, a plea for goodwill. In that way, the very fact that you show that patience and
that goodwill will enable us to change that part of the furniture of our mind and put in its place
more modern, fairer, more comfortable, and more substantial furniture for future use.”

It is our belief that definite good will shortly be seen because of this frank and open attitude which both
nations are showing toward the issues at hand. Faith and cooperation from the public are the keys “to Baldpate” in
this instance. May the old “furniture” of all nations be done with, and the new brought in, and over all
may the age-old ideal of brotherhood hold sway in a very real and practical sense.

ORGANIZED DEFENSE

Much comment has been aroused by the recent action of the Presbyterian Synod of North Carolina. Climaxing the yearly session,
was the appointment of a committee to confer with the trustees of the College upon the advisability of removing the
local Reserved Officers’ Training Corps unit. The harrowing problem appears to be the question of a church school educating its
students in militarism. The Southern Presbyterian Church is a peace-loving organization. However, it would seem that the fundamental purpose of
this phase of the National Defense Act, of 1920, has been confused.

An organized defense must not be considered as a preparation for war! There can be no treaty of peace which
will have as great restraint, on a nation preparing for war, as the knowledge that its prosperous opponent is ready
or can be ready at a moment’s notice. Fear inspires respect; respect inspires caution. War has lost its glamour! No
longer do men set forth on the quest of acquiring possessions, of satisfying lustful desires. This is clearly taught by
members of the local staff, detailed here by the Army Department. The many horrors of actual combat,The discomforts of campaign
are graphically illustrated in class and practical work. The purpose of an Organized Reserve, the purpose of a standing army,
are not to plunge the nation into war, but to keep it in peace. Few men are restrained from entering
Davidson by the presence of the R.O.T.C.

### Cosmic Chaos
**J. W. McCutchan**

Premier Ramsay MacDonald, accompanied by his daughter, has been sweeping the governmental and social world, as only a British prime
minister can. He has rather coquettishly requested the United States to have patience with Great Britain. To use a hackneyed
expression, “It’s hard to teach an old dog new tricks.” He need entertain no fears. The American nation has had
much practice in the art of patience; we have been explaining our jokes to the English for years, or rather
the same joke.

Raleigh has arisen in arms against the advertising campaign which is being advanced for the glorification of Thomas A. Edison.
The complaint is that a large signboard has been placed on the grounds of the state capitol, and consequently shuts
off from view a statue of Washington and a portion of the Capitol building. A large picture of Edison and
an admonition, “Help celebrate light’s golden jubilee,” are on the board. Edison has been a man of peace, and as
such he has been responsible for much of the greatest industrial development the world has ever seen. In addition to
this fact, he is still living. Seldom is a living man honored by the entire country. Surely the philanthropic clubs
and S.P.C.A. of Raleigh will not begrudge such recognition to a man who deserves it.

When Arb Helton, of Granite Falls, N.C., set fire to the cot and mattress in his cell of the jail,
he was merely following the example set by others. Never before in the history of the country has there been
such a widespread epidemic of prison revolts. In New York, California, and Colorado, convicts have set fire to their buildings,
shot and mobbed the guards, and a few escaped. The majority are herded into corners by tear-gas and machine guns,
whereupon they return to work with a longer sentence. It is unfair to judge them harshly. The sense of liberty
is strong in the Anglo-Saxon; we are a distinct nation, not a colony of England.

Spectacular has been the decline of the crossword puzzle. It is true that some of the hard-bitten fans still chew
and gnaw the tips of their pencils, but the public in general has turned to golf, or what have you.
Not so many years ago it was the customary habit to be met by a hair-ruffled individual who asked for
a two-letter word meaning Egyptian sun-god, while he feverishly grasped an unabridged dictionary, a book of synonyms, and three or
four quids of paper in the other hand. “Ask me another?”

Sight of an autograph book in one of the local stores recalled an occurrence of the Freshman year. We were
in the act of purchasing a like book for a friend. The clerk was ready to wrap the chosen article
when it flashed upon us that it would be wise to look inside. To our and the clerk’s mutual amazement,
the book was entirely filled with names. He turned and said, “Kind customer, aren’t they?” And we walked away thinking
how accommodating the world is.

It is discouraging to see the waste of energy that loses itself week by week. If the physical exercise of
jumping the brick wall in front of dormitory row could be converted into horse-power, it would be sufficient to pull
two and one-half elevators to the top of the dome of Chambers every two and one-third hours. This does not
take into consideration the lifting of two hundred fresh caps into the air before and after every meal and upon
retiring. Nor does it count the daily lifting of straws into sodas at the Drug Store. (This is not an
advertisement. Nor a paid ad.)

Aeneas gave way to Aesop, who once said: “The Wildcat clawed the Donkey’s back, whereupon the long-eared creature could kick
with only one leg, and that must needs be weak.” Ain't it so?

It is true that many do not like the physical exercise which accompanies the regular drill. But this can be
little worse to the indolent than the required course in Physical Education. It is hard to believe that there is
a Davidson student who is injuring his conscience because of pacific convictions. There can be little objection to the time
consumed, for credit in semester hours is allowed. Uniforms and equipment are furnished; there is no expense. It must also
be granted that relatively few men, who obtain their commissions in the Reserve Corps, enter Regular Army service. Statistics show
that a very small majority of entrants at the United States Military Academy have attended military preparatory schools. Accurate knowledge
of combat principles does not encourage the normal man to throw himself in fury upon his fellow man. It is
a natural conclusion that if the principal objection to Military Training is a constrained pacific one, then by fulfilling its
purpose, it defeats itself. If it is a question of classes, let it be said that there has never been,
brought to public attention at least, a student who failed in other subjects because of R.O.T.C. work. In the last
analysis, the decision must rest with the Board of Trustees. Let the Student Body assure itself that no decision will
be reached until the Board has prayerfully and carefully deliberated the decision.

### Smokehouse Saga
**By W. C. Ragin (Published Weekly)**

Now that the World Series and the far-famed Davidson-Army game are over, things are again approaching normality. (Pardon the deviation,
but, oh boy! oh boy! wasn’t that SOME game? Final score: Davidson 1 (half) Army 1 (half). Mule meat didn’t
turn out to be so bad.) Let me see, as I was saying when I so rudely interrupted myself, life
is once more settling down in its old rut. I mean it really is. However, have you noticed how positively
doggy the old school is becoming? The latest gasp is having phones in the dormitories. Is there no end to
man’s genius? The telephone is a great little invention, but this little jigger is apt to play havoc (or some
other game) with our otherwise calm and unruffled existence. Look into the future and imagine a scene such as this:

#### CHAOS or From Whitewing to President
**ACT I**

**Scene 1**

**Setting:** The vestibule of a dormitory. A phone occupies a conspicuous position in the foreground. A dead silence reigns; broken
only by the occasional snore of a stude.

**Phone:** Ring-g-g-g-g-g-g! Ring-g-g-g!

(Immediately Silence is dethroned and Pandemonium reigns in its stead. About seventy-five doors open and shut with awe-inspiring results. The
entire rooming force of the dormitory, with the exception of the unfortunates who were trampled in the rush and left
to dot the landscape with their bleaching bones, pours into the vestibule. A violent fight over the possession of the
phone takes place. At last Joe College, the villain, accomplishes the impossible and takes charge of the aforesaid phone by
brute force.)

**Joe:** Hello. Hello. I say, dash it all, hello.

**Female Voice:** Oh! May I speak to Carl Campus?

**Joe:** Toby sho’. (Aside, twirling his villainous mustaches.) Coises! Foiled again.

(Carl Campus is paged and draws nigh unto the fearful instrument to the accompaniment of cries of “Sissy! Sissy!)

**Carl:** Heigh ho there!

**Female Voice:** Oh, is this you?

**Carl:** Yeah, this is me—and you?

**Same Soprano Voice:** Oh Carl, blah, blah, blah.

**Voice from the congregated mob:** Aw shut up!

**Female:** What? Why, Carl.

**Carl (quite flustered):** Now you know I didn’t say that. Blah, blah, blah.

**Other Voices:** Hello, dearie! What’s your address? (Other equally weak wheezes follow.)

**Gal:** Never darken my door again!

**Phone:** Slam!!!!

(Carl runs amuck, and commits hammer murders, mayhem, etc., right and left. Scene ends as Carl hangs himself with the
phone cord.)

**ACT II**

**Scene 1**

**Setting:** Same as in Act I. A dead silence is broken by the ringing of the phone. Doors slam and
eager students pack the stage.

**Joe College:** Hello. Hello.

And so on far, far, far into the night.

**CURTAIN**

Thus, you can foresee the horrible strain to which our nerves will be subjected very soon. And just think how
this little instrument will wreck our characters. Imagine having to withstand the temptation of using all your spare change, pants
buttons, lead slugs, etc., to call up Mary, Jane, Blanche, Tabitha, Abigail, or what have you and tell her how
much you miss her, et al. Oh well, it’s all in the interest of science, so what’s the diff.?
