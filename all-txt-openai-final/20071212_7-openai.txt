**Hook-up culture on campus**

By AUDREY

While the walk of shame isn’t pleasant to make, it can be a notoriously unfortunate outcome after a night of frivolities. And after witnessing a particularly strange one, I began to question the dating scene on campus.

Before I begin, I should briefly tell you the scenario: a girl steps out of a guy’s car at 9:04 am Saturday morning, heels in hand. She immediately begins to laugh and actually starts talking to herself on her fast walk back to Belk.

Though fun, hooking up is not always a great idea.

49. Boy often banned from libraries  

And I must say, I am glad the situation was funny to her. I am making large inferences here, but think of how the night. That dialogue might have sounded like this: “What was his name again? I can’t believe I kissed him!! Ughhh how silly of me...yet, it was kind of fun.”

Regardless of whether it’s a walk of shame or a ride back from a boyfriend (which could be the case), there seems to be so much emphasis on the hook-up culture on campus. But finally, the focus is starting to shift toward the possibility of a dating culture.

The Psychology 318 class put together a survey with some really interesting results. Even though I wish more than 54% of students who were sent the questionnaire answered it, it was still a great start. Let me say that I was relieved to learn that the results reported that “hooking up has not replaced dating.”

In fact, according to the data, we are actually much more willing to be in relationships than to hook up with a friend or a random person.

Hooking up with someone for one night can be pretty dangerous or entertaining (the previous girl thought so), especially when you are guaranteed to see that person the next day.

So let’s focus on the dating culture and how we can support it. The Green CTB Players performed a series of skits Friday afternoon at Rusk House, entitled “RelationSHIT”.

You can guess what the skits were about. Some performances were side-splittingly funny, while others were sad, frustrating, and so real it was as if they were acting out my own experiences.

Unlike radio stars, romance did not die in the ’80s. Surprise us and show us that you’ve still got it! I want personally to applaud the Health Advisors, Georgia Ringle, the acting class, Rusk House, and all the other sponsors for putting these skits together and facilitating a “dating discussion” that took a little while to heat up.

I think it was comforting to hear that we all deal with the issues of dating and honesty. And, believe it or not, there are some healthy relationships on campus.

Dating exists and can exist to a greater extent when we learn to take risks. We most definitely take risks with the classes we take, the presentations we give, and the clothes we wear. Why can’t we transfer some of that gambling to our relationships with other people?

So why not create a Risk Takers Club? A new date every month until you find the shoe that fits? I have a question for all your readers - feel free to email your responses (Audrey33@gmail.com) - how do you meet people on campus?

Yes, I already know the “I am drunk at some party” line, but let’s say you don’t go to a party and you aren’t drinking AND you aren’t on Facebook? Speed Dating? Summit? Team Knitting? Do you think there could be a better way to meet people on campus?

I really would like to take a lot of that energy many of you had at the RelationSHIT performance and discussion and throw it into this column so that we can continue the search for romance.

And for these next few weeks, don’t work too hard! Always make room for love in your life, especially in this season. Happy Holidays and good luck to all those risk takers!
