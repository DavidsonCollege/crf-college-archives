What has a great memory
and comes with a
real handy trunk?

If you buy an IBM Personal System/2™ Model 25 by
the end of this year, you'll not only get a substantial
student discount, we'll throw in a nifty extra:
A sturdy, metal footlocker with brass trim,
16” x 16" x 20".

The computer is a great way to keep on top of
your class work. It'll store lots of stuff you need to
remember. And the trunk is real handy for holding
most everything else.

It’s a neat idea that’s yours for peanuts.

To take advantage of this special deal, contact
your on-campus IBM Education Product
Coordinator. But don’t wait too long. This special
offer expires December 31st.

become stagnant and unmotivated. It is individuals which
enrich and change an organization. This is true in any
selective organization such as a law firm, a corporation, a
varsity athletic team, or even a small liberal arts college.

Selectivity is a part of life with which we all must cope. I
hope people as intelligent as Davidson students can realize
that.

I have left out many things that a fraternity is. I have just
hit the high points. If you want to hear more, just ask a
fraternity member, active or alumni. After all, a fraternity
is for life. In conclusion, let me ask just one thing: please
do not refer to a fraternity as a “frat.” It isn’t.
