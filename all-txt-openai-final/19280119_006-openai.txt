**Y.M.C.A. Arranges Program for Vesper Services During the Next Two Months**

“It seems entirely fitting and appropriate that the last two ‘Y’ vesper programs of the school term should be in charge of two of our spiritual organizations,” said Jim Appleby in his introductory speech at the vesper services last Sunday night when he announced that the last two services of the year would be sponsored by the Christian Endeavor Training Class and the Ministerial Band, with the Christian Endeavor officiating on January 22nd, and the Ministerial Band in charge on Sunday, January 29th.

Inasmuch as a good many of the students leave the hill during exam week, it was decided to arrange the programs accordingly. For the beginning of the new term, the “Y” has engaged a number of very good speakers, all of whom the Davidson student body is very familiar with. The first is Dr. Oren Moore, of Charlotte, who has addressed the Davidson student body on several occasions before. Dr. Moore will come to Davidson on February 5th. On February 12th, a deputation composed of Bill Christian and Bill Gardner, both of whom are former Davidson students and now members of the student body at Union Seminary in Richmond, Va., will have charge of the services.

Bishop E. A. Penick has been invited to appear here on February 19th, but at this time it is not certain if he can accept this date. Pat Crawford, a graduate of Davidson, will speak here on February 26th, or the first week-end in March.

The complete program of the “Y” vespers for the coming month is as follows:
- Jan. 22—Christian Endeavor Training Class.
- Jan. 29—The Ministerial Band.
- Feb. 5—Dr. Oren Moore.
- Feb. 12—Deputation from Union Seminary.
- Feb. 19—Bishop E. A. Penick.
- Feb. 26—Pat Crawford (Tentative).

**Students Criticize Curricular Reform**

Football having passed off the boards, curricular reform is again engaging student attention in several colleges. The undergraduate reformers have taken fair notice of the criticisms overflowing current periodicals and have adopted a vigorous style in attacking their campus problems.

The University of Washington Daily, after publishing a series of student criticisms of the university and its work, has summarized by blaming the faculty “for the lack of intellectual stimulus and study encouragement prevalent on the campus.” The main drawback it conceives as “the faculty’s failure to inspire and challenge the students.”

**Second Chameleon Will be Issued After Exams**
Contributors Requested to Turn Material in to Members of Staff

The second edition of the Chameleon, Davidson College’s quarterly literary publication, will be issued sometime during the second week in February, according to James G. Wharton, editor-in-chief. So far, very little material for the coming edition has been turned in, but it is expected that more will find its way to the editor’s hands before the magazine is ready to go to press. An urgent request is being made for any of the students who have stories or poems to submit them as soon as possible.

**Excellent Program of Latest Pictures at Davidson Movie**

An excellent program has been prepared for next week at the Davidson Theater. Emil Jannings in “The Last Command” will very probably be shown here on Monday and Tuesday. This is one of the latest releases and is said to be one of the outstanding pictures of the season. One of the newest pictures of Esther Ralston, the popular young comedienne, will be shown the following day. Such players as Lois Moran, George O’Brien, Colleen Moore, Mary Astor, Lloyd Hughes, Richard Barthelmess, Tom Mix, and Capt. Tim McCoy will also be featured.Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

There will also be appalling over-emphasis on activities for the sake of being featured. The pictures are as follows: activity’s sake, that insistence on activities at Washington which results in the average collegian striving to be an activity hound from freshman days to the end of college. The faculty is blamed for having failed to eliminate superfluous activities, and the Daily presents the problem as one for the teachers to solve. President C. D. Gray of Bates College has appointed a student committee of twelve to examine the curriculum and suggest modifications and changes. The students will carry on the work begun by a senior committee last year. Three other groups are working on the same problem, one composed of teachers, another of alumni, and a third, serving as advisory, of outsiders.

Students in the College for Women at Western Reserve University have selected representatives to serve as their agents in presenting to the faculty complaints against the curriculum. They are members of the student council, who will work in conjunction with a faculty committee, to whom they will make recommendations after passing on student complaints. The undergraduate curriculum committee at Haverford College is drafting its annual report to the faculty. Its scope is wide, and its suggestions will deal not only with the curriculum proper, but also with the conduct of student affairs and such matters as improvement of library lighting conditions, and prompt dismissal of classes. The main points in an undergraduate report just presented to the faculty at the College of the City of New York propose revision of certain prescribed courses in order to permit greater freedom in the choice of electives, and the institution of honor courses. In developing these points the student investigators became critical of some of the existing courses.
