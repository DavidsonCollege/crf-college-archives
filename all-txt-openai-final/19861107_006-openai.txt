Friday, November 7, 1986 THE DAVIDSONIAN

Hope lies eternally dormant in the human heart, said a keen observer from another part of the world. But the sheer intensity of the haiku master’s optimism takes one’s breath away. One almost welcomes adversity:

“Since my house
Burned down, I now own
a better view of the moon.”
— Masahide

The poet’s sight does not only settle on nature to discover her grace and sublimity; he also observes the darker side. Even a man-made apparition can be the subject from which to draw a lesson:

“The people, we know...
But these days, even scarecrows
Do not stand upright.”
— Issa

Is the poet capable of discerning only the grim, the sober, and the solemn? Here again, we are surprised:

“Oh moon, why must you inspire
My neighbor to chirp
All night on a flute.”
— Koyo

Yet, it is in the solemn that the haiku masters really excel. Some of the finest lines on death are worth quoting:

“The leaves never know
Which leaf will be the first to fall.
Does the wind know?”
— Soseki

As in all literary forms, the translation can never retain the flavor of the original. In the Japanese version, the haiku is full of literary quotations, allusions, and double meanings which would not only be virtually impossible to translate but could not be understood even if a proper translation were made available.
