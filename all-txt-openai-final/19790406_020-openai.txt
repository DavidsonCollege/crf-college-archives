**Spring Frolics promises fun in the sun**

By JEAN SORACCO
Assistant Features Editor

The “Fun in the Sun” weekend is here! Starting off the weekend activities on Thursday will be Raun MacKinnon in
the 900 Room. Raun is a singer and songwriter who plays both guitar and piano. Her performances are at 9:30
and 11:00 with one dollar admission for both shows.

Friday begins with the outdoor concert featuring the “Amazing Rhythm Aces.”

The “Amazing Rhythm Aces” are a pop rock group whose specialty is a wide variety of music: blues and jazz
to rock and country rock. Al Rask, concert chairman, compares them to the Dixie Dregs.

A warm-up band will open the concert at 2:00. The concert will be held next to the baseball field, and
there will be 25 kegs of free beer.

The pop film, “The Three Stooges Follies,” will be shown as usual on Friday night at 8:00 and 10:30 p.m.
in Love Auditorium. Admission is $1.50.

In conjunction with the Spring Frolics theme, a beach party will be held in the Morrison Room Friday night at
9:00. Wading pools and beach towels will be set up. There will even be a boardwalk along one side of
the room.

“In order to give the complete beach atmosphere,” said Julia Pidgeon, chairman of the Union Committee, “Beach music will be
playing, and there will be the added sounds of waves and seagulls.”

Also on Friday night, Palmer Turnburke and Craig Dubose will be entertaining in the 900 Room. Many students may remember
them from last year’s Spring Frolics weekend. Craig and Palmer have “a light, warm style on traditional music from the
Southern Appalachian Mountains.”

They will also perform Saturday night along with Lou Therrell and Vivian Hartsoc. Shows on both nights will be at
9:30 and 11:00 p.m.

The biggest event will be the campus-wide dance on Saturday night with the band “Gaston.”

“Gaston,” formerly “The Magnificents,” have been listed in Playboy as “one of the top influences of rock and roll music.”
The band will play oldies, beach, and disco.

The dance has a tropical theme. It is semi-formal and will be held in the gym from 9:00 p.m. until
1:00 a.m. Tickets are on sale for $1.00 at the Union desk. They will be $1.50 at the door on
Saturday night. IDs will be required at the door.

To end the festivities, there will be a light breakfast, fruit, and pastries at a minimum cost, in the Union
at 1:00 a.m. There will be a hula contest with Will Terry as the judge.

The Union Board Committee hopes that the diversity in the Spring Frolics events and scheduling will provide a little something
for everybody.

**HALO jumpers**

On Friday afternoon, 6 April, the ROTC Department will sponsor a jump team from Fort Bragg to help kick off
Spring Frolics. Six to eight members of the HALO (High Altitude, Low Opening) Jump Team from Fort Bragg in Fayetteville
will begin parachuting onto the baseball field area at about 2:30.

**KING OF PIZZA**

maintains an excellent reputation for being fresh, warm, and of excellent quality. Davidson students enjoy the relaxed atmosphere or the

her love of pop music, folk, gospel, and blues, yet her work surfaces as her own.”
