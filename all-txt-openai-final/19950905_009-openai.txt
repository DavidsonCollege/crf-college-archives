THE DAVIDSONIAN OPINIONS TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 5, 1995

#### The two DC’s

While in Washington, D.C. this past summer, I came to a couple of startling conclusions: my fellow political science majors from Davidson are obsessed with running into me on the Metro, and the similarities between DC (Davidson College) and DC (District of Columbia) are greater than I initially suspected. Who knew the typical Davidson student had so much in common with Newt Gingrich and company?

In early June, freshly recovered from spring exams, Davidson’s entire political science department (or so it seemed) converged upon Washington in an orgiastic frenzy. Why such a fervent migration to Washington? We poli sci majors have an instinctual affinity for the District, and every summer, as if years of politically oriented classes aren’t enough, we flock north for more. In addition to our department’s Summer in Washington program, a large number of us freelanced our own internships. Every time I turned around there was another person with whom I’d had 86 classes. The novelty of attempting to make short but meaningful small talk at 8:30 a.m. on subway platforms wore off instantaneously. After about five accidental run-ins, I expected to see familiar faces all around town. I even began hiding from random strangers who resembled any Davidson student.

By early July, I wondered if I was merely another intern tennis ball the poli sci department machine had spit out to be whacked around on the court of Washington politics. With horror, and an even more shameless metaphor, I began to feel like one of many interning drones who had come to buzz (without play) in homage to the queen bee of policy-making cities. It seemed my individual attempt to enjoy a 3-month escape from Davidson had all been in vain!

As Washington’s population began to look a lot like Davidson’s, I noticed other parallels between these two bastions of intelligentsia. First of all, I realized that among Davidson’s Washington contingent, I knew not only political science wonks but a few art, history, and English majors as well. What beckoned these folks to the Capital? Some strange psychic connection between the two DCs? Foolishly, at first, I had merely contrasted the two places (I thought that the cities’ similarities were limited to a lack of skyscrapers and an affiliation with Woodrow Wilson). For instance, I noticed that while “I have so much work” tops the most commonly used phrase list at Davidson, “policy blah blah blah blah policy blah” remains a steady number one in the District.

As for local celebs, Davidson’s leading personalities include Richard Terry, Polly Griffin, the infamous Judy Krenzer, (Big) Dave, and of course, Bill Gullan. Washington’s top five hotly debated movers and shakers are much more high profile: Newt, Hillary, Marion Barry, Bill (Clinton), and of course Bill (Gullan). To Davidson’s credit, we may not have the big names, but our fine SGA president is making waves in both areas. Bill’s hefty leap into the pool of politics has already created an extra-large splash—the country is bracing for future cannonballing.

Such glaring differences in scale aside, a more thorough examination of the two cultures revealed that these two cities on a hill are actually quite similar.

#### Have we forgotten already?

A little over 50 years ago, one of the most important events in human history came to a close. While any war the size of WWII is obviously a dark part of history, many people saw a strong glimmer of hope emerge from that darkness. For one of the first times in history, different countries with different backgrounds united to fight against a threat to humanity and its values. The US and the other Allies fought in Europe against a government which ruled with and taught hate and fear of one’s fellow man. As the war progressed and was finally brought to a close, the world learned that the enemy which we had been fighting had engaged in horrible and unspeakable offenses against humanity. The Nazi death camps, which caused the deaths of millions of Jews, Gypsies, and political dissidents, were without a doubt one of the greatest, if not the greatest, crimes ever committed against humanity.

This last summer, I visited the newly opened Holocaust Museum in Washington D.C. It was an incredibly powerful experience. Even though there were hundreds of people in the museum, it was dead quiet, and if people spoke, they spoke in whispers. Seeing the pictures and films and reading the histories and letters was one of the most emotional experiences of my life. It blows the mind to imagine that humans were capable of doing those things to each other. You cannot help putting yourself in the place of the victims of death camps and Nazi policies. It is impossible to imagine how it would feel to be awakened and arrested in your own home, to watch your wife stripped naked by a young Nazi soldier, forced to walk naked for miles before being told to stop and dig a ditch, to watch as a Nazi officer walks behind the row of diggers shooting each in the head before pushing them into the ditch, and to know that the last thing you will see is your children and your wife killed. Think about that. It is a horrible thing humans did fifty years ago. I felt shame, anger,and incredible sorrow. The only positive part of the museum is its theme: “Never Again.” That is the only hope; that is the only good that came out of what the Nazis did. The world, and the US in particular, promised “never again.” Never again would we let these abominations take place. On the 50th anniversary of that pledge, one would think that it would receive special consideration and reaffirmation. Yet 50 years after WWII, the policies and beliefs for which people cursed the Nazis have reemerged. Ethnic cleansing is at the center of the conflict in the Bosnian war. Hate of those who are different is why people are dying in Bosnia. Fifty years after the world stood aghast at what had happened in Germany, what is the world doing about Bosnia? Nothing. We are sitting back and worrying about getting involved. We remember Vietnam and say, “it’s none of our business.” Have we forgotten the words on which this great country was founded? “Liberty and Justice for All,” “Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness,” “All Men Are Created Equal.” These phrases are what our country is based upon. This is its foundation. What could be more of our business than something that totally contradicts these basic principles? I cannot think of a better cause for Americans to die for. One thing that all of our great leaders have maintained is that there are some things more important than life. War is horrible, but sometimes it is necessary to endure that evil so that a greater good may be obtained. That is why so many men signed up to fight and die fifty years ago. For the sake of their memories, for the sake of what America has always stood for, and for the sake of humanity, we cannot afford to let these crimes continue. They must be stopped and we must do whatever is necessary to stop them.

Political debate, in Davidson our international politics forum, the Dean Rusk Program, puts up a lot of signs but what exactly does it do? Similar all bark but little bite occurs in Washington where public figures argue, sound-byte, and propose but never seem to accomplish even 2% of their agendas. On a more fundamental level, both Davidson and Washington’s administrations are full of Republicans and religious conservatives. At the same time, in both locales, the media is distinctly liberal. (Did I mention high parking ticket fines?) The most uncanny resemblance, however, lies deep in the psyche of both cities. Basically, people in Washington and Davidson are nerds with a vision. Instead of leading the easy life (a blow-off school or a nine to five job) Davidson students and District residents love to strive for the light at the end of the tunnel. At Davidson, that elusive flicker of hope usually translates as the apocryphal post-graduation career. In the Capital city, the dream is one of a perfect America where every government policy is fair and just. For better or worse, this tendency to aspire to some distant mirage has led many Davidson students and Washington residents to create their own bubble world where the future is first, and everything else is last.

Over time we both become oblivious to the diversity of lifestyles in the outside world; Washington residents acknowledge that the beltway acts as both a psychological and quarantined youngster from that fabulous movie The Boy in the Bubble, most of us never contemplate the territory beyond our artificial boundaries except in the context of class or home.

As much as many of us would like to deny it, we’re a lot more like Newt and his pals than we thought. Perhaps so many Davidson students go to Washington because we easily identify with such one-track minded, ambitious overachievers. On the other hand, maybe it’s just to pay lots of rent, toil away in the heat and humidity and get paid nothing just to beef up anorexic resumes. Who knows? Maybe some of my Washington summer compatriots whiled away their

Very short article

I'll make this brief. Judging by the space left in this section, I have no other choice. Because of the incredible apathy at this school I don't have enough articles to fill this section. Come on people! What's wrong with you? You must have an opinion on something. Get off your butt, sit yourself down at a computer, and write a damn article. It's easy, productive, and if it's in English I will print it. If you need further motivation here are a few reasons why you should send in an opinions article now:

1.) Chicks dig guys who write for the Opinions section.
2.) Studs dig girls who write for the Opinions section.
3.) If you write, then you won't have to read this dumb little statement.
4.) The Opinions Editor, Jefe, is a powerful and popular guy. Getting on his good side is a smart move for any ambitious student.
