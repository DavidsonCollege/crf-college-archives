**Staples Speech Ends Silence**

Dr. George Staples’ speech in chapel last Thursday was a refreshing change from the customary official silence concerning possible reforms
in Davidson's traditional methods of education. His “fourteen points” are noteworthy not only on their own merit but also as
an indication that at least some members of the faculty and administration have positive ideas on this matter.

Dr. Staples’ proposals embody the lessons gained from many years of experimentation in the best colleges in the country. “Core”
courses for the required curriculum, a strong honors program, unlimited cuts for students on the dean's list—all these would do
much toward removing the boredom that pervades our present required courses and would help establish powerful incentives for students able
and willing to do advanced work of high quality.

Other points in the speech concerned plain necessities which have been neglected too long, even by Davidson’s rather flexible standards.
The existence of one-man departments in subjects as important as political science, sociology, and philosophy is unthinkable in a liberal
arts school of our size.

T. S. Eliot has expressed frustration and futility by the phrase, “I have measured out my life with coffee spoons.”
At Davidson, we have been spoon-fed altogether too long. We hope that in the future an attitude of willingness to
make changes and abandon traditions will itself become a Davidson Tradition.—C.H.C.

**A New President's Ideas**

(Editor's note: this editorial was reprinted from THE DAVIDSONIAN of November 18, 1931. It was written by D. Grier Martin,
editor-in-chief.)

The University of North Carolina is to be congratulated on their new President, Dr. Frank Graham. In his inaugural address,
the new President expressed his ideas in regard to freedom in a college or university. A part of his talk
follows:

“Freedom in a university runs a varied course and has a wide meaning. It means the freedom of students with
their growing citizenship to govern themselves in campus affairs, and the right of lawful assembly and free discussions by any
students from anywhere on any issues and any views whatsoever.

“For the faculty, freedom means the right of the faculty to control the curriculum, scholastic standards, and especially matters pertaining
to intellectual excellence; to teach and speak freely, not as propagandists, but as scholars and seekers for the truth with
a sense of responsibility to the truth for the teacher's part in the development of the whole youthful personality; to
organize their own independent association for discussion and statement of views, and as an organic part of the university help
shape university policies by votes, representation, advice, and, may we hope, a larger sharing in the life of the university
and the people of the state.”

In both of these views on freedom, Dr. Graham strikes a phase of college life which is up to standard
in few of the colleges of the state; and Davidson is not among the leaders in this line.

**For A Job Well Done**

This has been a trying year for Davidson College. Many people have been called on to fill roles left vacant
and many have had to play roles created by events. Over on ‘the hill’ men have been at work doing
jobs that go unrecognized and often they receive criticism for the tasks which they have graciously consented to perform, all
in the attempt to lead the pilotless ship.

Those who have seen the labors of men like Dr. Pietenpol and Dr. Bailey and the spirit in which they
have kept the college running cannot but be impressed by the caliber of the work they have done—it isn’t the
flawless work of a perfectly-functioning machine, but rather it is the more crude product with visible flaws, which is often
to be the more appreciated because to err is human.

Pietenpol, Bailey, Martin, Hengeveld—these are the ‘names’ in this league, but it is not to them alone that we direct
our appreciation for carrying on under the pressures and difficulties of the impermanent administration. It is to the entire staff
that have devoted their time and effort to seeing that Davidson College keeps afloat that THE DAVIDSONIAN tips its hat
for a job well done.

**If We Miss The Torpedoes**

Revised Bidding seems to be going the way of all innovations, down the drain. The IFC will take its final
vote on the issue tonight, and we may be pleasantly surprised by its passage, but this is unlikely.

Few issues have been more discussed on campus than this one, and the discussion thus far has failed to turn
up any significant flaws in the system. The most consistent argument advanced by those opposing the new system has been,
“Well, down at our house, we just don’t want anybody telling us what to do.” The discussion in progress usually
ends on this statement because from here on appeals to logic, common sense, altruism, and intelligence are futile.

Bullheadedness has been a trait of the Anglo-Saxon race for thousands of years, especially Calvinistic Anglo-Saxons, so we suppose that
these attitudes should come as no real surprise. At times, and occasions, such strongness of will can be valuable—“Damn the
torpedoes, full speed ahead,” valuable that is if you miss the torpedoes. THE DAVIDSONIAN wonders if the fraternity system will
avoid them.

At any rate, pass or fail, it was, and still is a good idea. Vernon Anderson and Richard Brubaker, originators
of the plan, are to be thanked for their work on it, and congratulated on the forceful manner in which
they presented Revised Bidding. Perhaps a seed has been sown which will eventually take hold in the Student Body and
produce the desired reforms at some later date. We hope so.

**Interim Rule Of Acting President Pietenpol Has Maintained Equilibrium And Tradition**

By BOBBY LIVINGSTON

Dr. Pietenpol became Acting President of Davidson College with the resignation of Dr. Cunningham. In retrospect, it becomes apparent that
he has headed a sort of loose committee-type leadership whose primary aim has been to maintain equilibrium. Other prominent figures
in this cabinet are Mr. D. Grier Martin, Dr. McGavock, Dean Bailey, and the faculty acting as a unit. The
accomplishments and failures of this administration must be measured in light of its self-set aim. Perhaps by the very nature
of its decision, Davidson has not felt the strong leadership it enjoyed in the past. But at the same time,
the traditional goals and implementing plans have not suffered.

In terms of long-term ambition, this has been especially true. The college has not lost stature in the fiercely competitive
field of prestige. It has obtained a typically outstanding incoming freshman class. It has continued to attract strong financial support.

The physical face of Davidson has witnessed sharp alteration in this interim. A new fraternity court, a much-needed addition to
the library, and “Martin’s Gulch” have advanced according to existing plans. The college received during this period from Mr. Charles
A. Dana the largest contribution ever offered by a living individual.

In terms of the immediate college life, the administration has functioned in the face of crisis, partly of its own
choosing. Its policy has been pegged for the hour. Its greatest restriction has been its obvious interim character. It has
borne the brunt of serious local situations. The strong mark of Pietenpol is revealed in the frankness on all occasions
with which those in control have treated the students. This has been appreciated by the student body’s evident concern for
the welfare of Davidson College.

Dean Bailey has imparted a sincerity and dignity to all the deliberations in his province. He demonstrated a willingness to
provide leadership in a period of grave potential crisis, and a desire to let things work themselves out in less
demanding areas. The Honor System received one of the most unintended but yet serious assaults upon its value in the
history of its existence. It has endured, strengthened by the student body’s greater awareness of its significance. Hell Week was
abolished by the IFC after the faculty chose Skit Night to illustrate the need for an evaluation of the ideals
of the student body. What could have been a student rebellion turned into a strong affirmation for the faculty's general
decision to insist upon a traditional ideal.The faculty has responded to this approval by deliberate caution in imposing any specific
restrictions upon any activity. It has been seeking, however, causes and solutions for excesses in student religious conduct, drinking, and
dance weekends. The student council participated somewhat in this, and its potency was illustrated by a return to decency in
vespers for IM GOING.

Staples Speech Praised, Student Dress Is Criticized

Coat & Tie

Dear Abbie,

I won’t be trite by saying that I have a problem, but I do. I come from a nice family.
I went to high school. While living under the influence of these two mediums I learned the positive values of
social graces and neat appearance. I found that knowing I was neatly attired gave me confidence, gave me a more
optimistic outlook, and enhanced others' reactions to me.

My mother is a Southern Lady, Faulkner would call her that; Eleanor Roosevelt would call her degenerate Southern aristocracy—you know
the type. But she believes in God and the frivolity of youth so she sent me to Davidson College, a
safe place, that I might obtain, along with an education, certain of the social graces necessary to identify one with
his native section.

I have attended Davidson for three years. In the course of those three years I have shot an M-1 rifle,
memorized the Ten Commandments, written five research themes, ruined seven shirts in chemistry courses. I am well-rounded, a potential future
leader. Yet I have forgotten what it is to be neatly attired, to shave anytime other than Saturday afternoon, or
to smile optimistically in the morning. These are results of being part of the Davidson College social system.

At first, because I was young and naive, I fought the system. I was ostracized. I became unpopular. Who likes
people who wear ties to classes? I was an outsider, so I conformed. Next year I will make my appearance
in society again. I am completely unprepared for the exodus. I do not hold any hope for myself. I only
wish to save new students from the same initial shock and coma of indifference that I experienced.

Is it possible that there are some here, besides myself, who feel that along with the change in administration, Davidson
College could stand a change in the attire of her students—preferably a change to coat and tie?

Frustrated

OH, YES... USUALLY THEY CIRCLE IN ROLE IN THE

Hours Well Spent

Dear Editor:

I would like to publicly congratulate Dr. Staples on his chapel talk to the Student Body last week. The several
points he mentioned are well worth serious consideration by the students, the faculty, and the administration. There are few who
realize that “Davidson is not as outstanding as we think it is. We tend to pat ourselves on the back
for being a part of such a great institution. But if outsiders don’t share the same sentiments, maybe we are
wrong in our self-analysis. Let's get one thing straight. There’s no place for tradition in education. Advances are being made
in the theory of education and Davidson is slow to keep pace.

Dr. Staples has accounted for his many hours with the “caffeine philosophers” and has shown that they were well spent.

whose conduct it had requested to be made responsible. Specific student criticism focused on such items as a curriculum justified
more by tradition than by the ideal of a complete education, and the observation upon reflection that the faculty as
a whole perhaps evaded the root of apparent problems to arrive at solutions for particular situations. The Pietenpol era has
been relentless in its desire to keep things as they were. The accomplishment of its aim must be admitted. Its
weakness was inherent to its structure.

What We Need Is

By TOM KERNAN

“Well, they are going to give us a new president tomorrow; I didn’t think they would ever get around to
it.” The speaker was the beloved Professor of Advanced Harmonica, Percy Dewlips. I was sharing a table with him while
sopping up the usual morning purgative of Union coffee. Beowulf Brawn, Coach of Yogi and Christian Sunbathing, and Prof. Covington
Clogg, Ethiopian Etymology, were engaged in the same pastime.

“Are you hopeful of any changes in policy, sir?” I asked.

“Certainly,” he replied. “Whoever he may be, and I must say they needn’t have looked beyond their own backyard—but whoever
he may be, he can’t help but realize the need for a new music hall. My harmonica classes simply can’t
play against the drafts in Shearer, when the wind comes through those cracks in the wall. Every period, someone gets
the hiccoughs.”

“An’ a sunporch too,” said Coach Brawn.

“Beg pardon, Beowulf,” said Prof. Clogg, “but why do we need a sunporch?”

“Cause then the students could sunbathe in the winter; honestly, Prof. Clogg, if you could see their white, shivering, little
bodies, when they come down to the gym, it would break your heart.” A large, saline tear slithered down his
cheek and plummeted noisily into his coffee.

“A typical Philistine outlook,” jeered Prof. Clogg, angrily crumbling the remains of a doughnut in his fist. “You all want
a Santa Claus or a Wall Street Wizard, someone who can fatten the college ‘kitty.’ What we need is a
man with some real intellectual insight.”

“Druther have a sunporch,” said Coach Brown sullenly.

“All very well for you to talk, Clogg, when you're over in Chambers where it’s warm and dry and there
aren't any nasty insects crawling around in your desk,” said Prof. Dewlips.

“I can’t help it if your course attracts that particular segment of the animal world,” Prof. Clogg replied acidly.

Prof. Dewlips answered by depositing the remainder of his coffee in his colleague’s countenance, whereupon Prof. Clogg grasped his opponent’s
tie and made as if to leave the room, with its wearer still attached. Coach Brawn joined the fray, attempting
to subdue the contestants but receiving only a blow in the abdomen for his troubles. Acting the part of a
neutral, I slipped off through the crowd of spectators.

“I wonder if getting a new president is worth all this trouble,” I said to the counterman.

“Well, I reckon someone has to keep the faculty members from killing each other. Me, I'd rather work here behind
the counter.”

THE ICONOCLAST

CHRISTIAN DIDACTICS

By BRUCE W. VAN SANT

With all the innovations the school is planning, from a new science building to a new president, there is a
segment in the curriculum, long un-innovated, which has been disregarded. This is in the Bible department. As the school is
responsible to the Presbytery, it is feasible that a theological course be required of its students to further those ideals
for which the student selected Davidson. The question now occurs: Do these courses further or hinder those ideals?

It is evident that after early Church training, Sunday School, and Young People’s discussion Groups, the student entering college is
aware of the historic significance of certain biblical names and carries a rather full repertoire of Bible stories. Re-telling these
tales in big words merely serves to tarnish their luster of tradition and may have some thinking that with all
this repetition, perhaps their meaning is not so deep after all, for the college rendition is no more advanced than
the Sunday School one.

Perhaps this was realized when the administration decided to offer an experimental choice to Freshmen next year. One section will
be able to choose whether they want the usual Bible 11-12, or a pair of vaguely similar courses. Ah-ha! someone
has been thinking! Whoever he was, he must have been a timid soul, for Bible Stories 21-22 is still the
only out for Sophomores.

In addition to the relative ineffectiveness of these two courses there remains the fact that they are intransferrable to most
institutions, and because of the high student fatality rate between the freshman and senior year, which is continually being worn
as a badge of academic achievement by the college, this is a strong argument against the courses as they now
stand. How do the courses stand now? As far as Presbyterian concepts are concerned, John Calvin goes unmentioned beyond the
history classroom. As far as Christian precepts are concerned, their surfaces are merely dusted—be careful not to scratch them!

The solutions to the problems outlined are so various and simple, one can arrive at quite a few even without
a staff of experts on Christian didactics and academics as there exists in the Bible department. A toothsome battery of
courses can be lined up which will provide both new knowledge and intellectual exercises for the masses and needed credit
for the pre-mins; that will be palatable, if not interesting; at the least transferrable, at the most, at the college
level. While we are in the mood for change, let’s not forget the required religion courses: their value can be
heightened considerably, and they can at least have a more collegiate ring to them when they appear on a transcript.
