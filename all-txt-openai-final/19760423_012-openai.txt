**Promiscuity demands responsibility**

By PATRICIA McMURRAY  
Staff Writer

Mecklenburg County is the “clap” capital of the southeastern United States; pregnancy is the single leading cause for young women dropping out of high school in North Carolina; the birthrate in North Carolina has dropped in all age groups except among teenagers.

The increase of pregnancy frequency has been most noticeable between the ages of eleven and fifteen; approximately twenty percent of all pregnancies are planned.

These are only a few of the facts Laurena Page, a representative of Planned Parenthood of Charlotte, mentioned in an hour and a half presentation this last Tuesday.

The truth is that unplanned parenthood and the effects of today’s “looser morality” can be tragic.

The organization feels that people must learn about their bodies and how to control their fertility so as to avoid the misfortunes of sexual ignorance. Planned Parenthood works to solve some of these problems.

The Planned Parenthood of greater Charlotte has a mission. It hopes to “enhance the quality of life in Charlotte and elsewhere by helping people manage their fertility.” Page commented that “the organization has approached this mission through three different program areas: educational, medical, and counseling.” Tours, lectures, advertisements, brochures, television shows, etc., are all a part of the educational program, where the how’s and why’s of planning families are discussed.

The medical services offered by Planned Parenthood include the issuing of contraceptives, pregnancy diagnosis and testing, venereal disease testing, first trimester abortions, Pap smears, and vasectomies.

The counseling services include group visits, individual sessions, and telephone counseling. This program provides information concerning contraceptives, abortions, and other areas of human sexuality. It is Planned Parenthood’s belief that it should provide an opportunity for a person to understand his sexuality through information on birth control, family planning guidance, and high-quality medical service.

The lecture discussion session in Perkins Auditorium on Tuesday was a part of the community education program that works within schools, public housing developments, churches, and clubs as well as colleges. Page traced the history of the organization, described its medical services, and discussed several contraceptive methods in detail.

Since the average female client of Planned Parenthood usually has never been to a gynecologist before, the lecture also included an explicit description of a pelvic examination: “It’s one of those necessary evils that a woman shouldn’t fear. Once you understand the procedure it will minimize the trauma that is often associated with a visit to the gynecologist.”

Originally, Planned Parenthood of greater Charlotte was a telephone clinic that merely provided contraceptive and abortion information. In 1972, the organization expanded to include a small clinic for pregnancy diagnosis and problem pregnancy counseling, with an average of six to eight clients a week. Now there are four to five thousand telephone calls and over 1500 patients per month that use the outgoing patient clinic for prescribing low-cost birth control preventatives, pelvic examinations, pregnancy tests, vasectomies, and abortions.

The clinic does not handle such sterilization procedures as tubal ligations since the anesthesia lends itself to complications that a hospital is better equipped to control. The organization has done everything possible to make the less complicated medical and counseling services available to everyone.

Human sexuality is Planned Parenthood’s business. It is a voluntary, non-profit agency supported primarily by contributions from the community. And, aside from its intrinsic merit, the organization has accomplished some great things in terms of making people become more aware of the responsibility of “sexual literacy.”
