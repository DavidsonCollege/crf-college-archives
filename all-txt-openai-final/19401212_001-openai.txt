Vosburgh Chosen Football Manager— ALENDA LUX UBI ORTA LIBERTAS The Davidsonian No Band Announcement Yet Volume XXVIII. X-528 DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N. C., THURSDAY, DECEMBER 12, 1940. Number 11. Paragraphics By THE EDITOR Congratulations to Jay Bolin, who receives the Tim Pharr Blocking Trophy this year, after a lot of hard work and small glory as “chopping back.” Congrats also to Dave Vosburgh on his election to head managership of the team for next year. * * * The Christmas Service Sunday night promises to be better than in the past years. The Davidson College Concert Band will present its second fall concert Thursday night, December 12, in Chambers Auditorium at 8:15 p.m. The program will consist of numbers entirely different from those presented on the last concert program of the year. The same night Mr. Franklin Riker will present his pupils in a voice recital in Shearer Hall at 7:30 p.m. The Y. M. C. A. directors deserve commendation for their continued efforts to make the Christmas Service a success. They have put a lot of time, thought, and work into the service. I. R. C. and Scabbard and Blade, men’s honorary fraternities, are the top organizations on the campus this year. Both organizations have done considerable work this year and are planning new programs for the future. Red and Black Masquers Honor Mr. Brengel and “Margin for Error” Cast The Davidson College Concert Band will present its second fall concert Thursday night, December 12, in Chambers Auditorium at 8:15 p.m. The program will consist of numbers entirely different from those presented on the last concert program of the year.

Red and Black Masquers Honor Mr. Brengel and “Margin for Error” Cast The play, which was attended by approximately four hundred and fifty students, faculty, and visitors, was a fine play. Mr. Brengel, the cast, and the dramatic club at Salem College deserve congratulations for the excellent production. Davidson really came through in the “Charlotte Observer” all-state football team. Guard Bob Johnson filled a slot on the first team, with Niven, Rainey, Bahnson, and Spencer on the second string and Hackney and Beeson receiving honorable mention. Hackney also received the highest honor—most valuable. Davidson is proud of all these men, as well as those who worked just as hard without the flowers. Social life is certainly picking up on the campus during these past weeks. The KA-Kappa Sig Ball was a large success, according to reports.Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

Bolin Chosen Best Blocker

As yet there is no report as to who will take over the office of Dean. Dr. Sentelle has handed in his resignation, but it will not go into effect until after the change in administration. None of the rumors floating about have been confirmed.

Bolin Receives Tim Pharr

At the football banquet held Wednesday night in the banquet hall, Bolin was chosen as the best blocker. The entire Davidson College OLIVA battalion massed in parade formation Wednesday, December 4. Scabbard and Blade, national honorary military fraternity, held its annual fall tap day. Bolin, winner of the Tim Pharr award, was tapped.

New Manager Will Be Inflicted

Does anyone care about what happens to our religious services? Thus far very little comment has been made one way or the other. There are good reasons both ways, if anyone cares to think about them.

From the number of forms and supports being placed about the foundations and floor of the new buildings, it would seem that the entire structure will be posts and columns, inside and out. Too bad the seniors will never be able to use these new additions to the campus.

Our wildcat is still caged, however!

One odd fact we've noticed is that there has never been a time when all the seniors were in agreement. The Davidsonian wishes to remind all freshmen and sophomores on the editorial staff to be at the Davidsonian office Thursday evening at 7:15 with their assigned articles. The staff is anxious to have the articles in on time so that the Christmas edition can be done in good fashion. Any freshmen who have not written articles for the paper are asked to come and help with headlines. This edition will be in the mail either Tuesday or Wednesday.

Senior blazers can now be obtained through Marvin Sink, local representative of the Hamilton Taylor Company. This year the blazers will be light tan in color and made of Shetland cloth. Seniors will have their coats made to order. They will cost $15 and be ready in two weeks. Sink urges all seniors to contact him and get their measurements as soon as possible in order that they may get the coats soon after Christmas.

That was nice applause that greeted the close of Dr. Lingle's talk Monday concerning the arrival of our newly-selected president. Dr. Lingle has done a good job over a trying period and has earned the respect of the students.—W. A. D.

500 Musicians to Participate in Production
