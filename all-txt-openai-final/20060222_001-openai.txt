SGA, EAC
to improve
recycling

By AMELIA RICHMOND
Staff Writer

The campus recycling bins are
so contaminated that the recycling
company will often dispose of
Davidson’s recycling in the trash,
according to Richmond Blake
'09, head of the Student
Government Association’s (SGA)
environmental committee.

The company that handles
Davidson’s recycling has a policy
that they will not process recy-
cling if more than 30 percent of it
is contaminated, including lids on
bottles and entire bags of material
in the bins.

To address this problem, SGA
voted last semester to make
improving the campus recycling
program one of its six goals for
the year.

SGA’s environmental commit-
tee is currently working with the
Environmental Action Coalition
(EAC) to improve environmental
awareness on campus.

“SGA’s environmental commit-
tee is working on decreasing con-
tamination and increasing campus
recycling participation,” Blake
said.

Many students are concerned
about the lack of recycling on
campus. While the Court has
recycling bins from the physical
plant and each house has a big
blue bin, they are often not used.

Paul Farmer heads to dinner with students before Sunday’s talk.

Humanitarian Farmer
speaks about work

By BRIAN MORAN
Staff Writer

Dr. Paul Farmer, humanitarian
physician and founder of the inter-
national organization Partners in
Health (PIH), delivered the 2006
Smith Lecture in the Duke Family
Performance Hall on Sunday.

Farmer’s speech focused on the
nature of the HIV epidemic in
developing nations and the strategy
employed by PIH in fighting the
disease.

Farmer began his lecture by
emphasizing the gravity of the
HIV/AIDS epidemic.

“This is a profound disruption in
the lives of millions of people,”
Farmer said while discussing the
impact of HIV on African life
expectancy.

He argued against experts who
suggest that medicinal treatment is
the only cost-effective means of
dealing with the health crises in
developing countries.

Although he said this type of
treatment is important, he stressed
the necessity of improving overall
living conditions in order to suc-
cessfully combat HIV.

“An AIDS project must be com-
prehensive to be truly effective,”
Farmer said.

Community-based support,
which increases adherence to a
plan of care, increases survival
rates and consequently decreases
drug resistance to the diseases.
“You can’t have a movement
without the citizens. The experts
can’t lead one alone,” Farmer said.

According to Farmer, health care
is a human right that all individuals
deserve regardless of their socio-
economic status.

“All of us know what it’s like to
be sick. The idea of not being able
to have care because you’re poor is
offensive to many people,” Farmer
said.

Farmer then described PIH’s role
in Haiti, where the organization
first began its work.

“AIDS is the leading infectious
killer of adults in Haiti,” Farmer
said.

Farmer cited the lack of knowl-
edge regarding HIV/AIDS as one
of the greatest obstacles to success-
ful treatment in developing
nations.

A particularly striking example
of this impediment was the story of
a Haitian HIV patient named
Joseph.

Joseph had abandoned all hope
of survival and was preparing for
death because he was simply
unaware of the treatment he could
receive.

“My job was to convince him not
to give up,” Farmer said.

After six months of treatment,
Joseph was healthy. He now works
with PIH and the World Health
Organization.

New budget increases
student tuition, fees

By KATIE PFEIFFER
Senior Staff Writer

Student tuition and fees will
increase by 5.3 percent next year.
The $78 million budget, approved
by the Board of Trustees last
month, also included a 6.9 percent
increase in financial aid and a 3.5
percent increase in the faculty and
staff salary pools.

Students and their families pro-
vide $45.9 million of the $78 mil-
lion budget.

Therefore, even a full-tuition
student is not paying the full cost
of an education at Davidson.

In order to continue to provide
top educational services, the col-
lege spends more money on stu-
dents than it receives from them.

In 2004 to 2005, the annual
budget report found that one stu-
dent’s education costs
$47,786. Tuition, however, was
$34,903 that year.

“My personal goal is to decrease
the percentage that students pay.
We can do this through gifts and by
endowment performance,”
President Bobby Vagt said.

When deciding how much to
raise tuition, Davidson looks at the
amount of tuition and rate of
tuition increase set forth by com-
petitive state schools to which
Davidson students have applied,
such as University of North
Carolina.

Davidson’s budget is drawn
from a combination of endowment,
gifts and tuition.

The college has asked for an
unrestricted $300,000 in addition
to the regular budget.

Adderall abuse
prompts concern

By JACKIE MCKEON
News Editor

Before escaping campus for
spring break, students must first
face the stress of midterms.

To survive the heavy workload,
an increasing number of college
students, including some at
Davidson, are abusing the prescrip-
tion drug Adderall, an ampheta-
mine used to treat Attention Deficit
Disorder (ADD) and Attention
Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

A student enjoys yesterday’s unseasonably warm weather.

“Some people use it if they real-
ly need to do work,” an anonymous
student said. “Coffee only keeps
you going for a half-hour or hour.
Adderall lasts longer.”

Students who take Adderall
without a prescription cited poor
time management and study skills
as a factor in their decision to take
the drug.

“A guy on my freshman hall had
a prescription. One night, I had
