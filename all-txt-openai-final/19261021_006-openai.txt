THE DAVIDSONIAN, OCTOBER 21, 1926

The “Y” officials announce that they will co-operate with the men of the Church in furnishing speakers for nearby churches
that are without pastors.

A great man and a great meeting: Dr. Ben Lacy here on November 7, to conduct the fall meeting of
the “Y.”

Davidson Leading Race for State Grid Honors

Davidson is now leading all teams in the state in games won, having five victories to her credit, and no
defeats. Teams conquered by the fighting Wildcats so far are Elon, Wofford, Guilford, Presbyterian College of South Carolina, and State.
Davidson also showed the best defense among the “big five” in the state by having only six points scored against
her.

Individual honors in the race go to Spurlock, mighty back of Lenoir-Rhyne, who leads all comers with eight touchdowns and
one extra point, for a grand total of 49 points. Spurlock added three touchdowns to his list in the game
with Emory and Henry, Saturday. Leggette is Davidson’s high-scoring man, with 18 points. Dick Grey is second with 13 points.
Grey is the state’s leading drop-kicker, with four field goals to his credit. By this means he has won two
games for the Wildcats, his toe being the deciding factor in both the P. C. and State games.

Individual scoring and team records are as follows:
- Spurlock, L-R: 8 TD, 0 Ex.Pt., 0 F.G., 49 T.P.

Others who have scored only extra points.

The need for new tennis courts has long been felt at Davidson and now for the first time it seems
as if that need will be satisfied. According to the plans announced by Mr. Hobart, who is in charge of
the construction work done on the campus, operations will soon begin for the building of quite a few new courts.
It is planned to build four courts directly behind Watts dormitory, and work will begin on these late this fall
or early spring, so they may be used before the end of this school year. However, a great many more
courts than these will be constructed. There are to be two terraces of courts on number 9 fairway on the
college golf course. Here there will be plenty of room for the spectators to watch the matches. Work on these
terraced courts will begin in the spring so they will be ready for next fall.

W. L. Poteat, of Wake Forest, has an excellent article which he calls “Thirty Silent Years.” The theme of this
topic deals with the years of Christ's life about which we know very little, and the author presents Him in
a very real way and handles his subject in a truly masterful style. Drop by the “Y” room and read
this article; you'll enjoy it.

Just to remind you—Tom Glasgow will be the “Y” speaker this Sunday—plan NOW to be there.

Davidson men are helping the Sunday School department of the Cornelius Presbyterian Church at present.

has received a book called in which 13 heroes of college campuses of both English and American colleges are discussed
and their acts of heroism given. The reason why this book should be especially interesting to men of Davidson is
the fact that one of the heroes whose story is given is a Davidson man. His story is as follows,
briefly: “David Yonan was born in Uramia, Persia, in 1880, of parents who though originally Moslems, had embraced Christianity and
remained true to their trust, even in view of the loss of social standing because of their adoption of this
new religion. So reared in such an environment, David quite naturally wanted to learn more about his religion, and decided
to come to America to study. He came over here and entered a preparatory school in Virginia and in the
fall of 1896 entered Davidson. His course of study was made doubly hard because he had to study English as
much and a whole lot more than most foreign languages of today. But in spite of a handicap like that,
he rapidly became a leader on the campus and one whose reputation, physical, mental and moral, was of the highest
type. He graduated in 1900 and decided to spend the summer in Davidson. He was invited to go on the
annual picnic of the College Church at Catawba River, and during the day quite a few of the party went
in bathing. Yonan did not go in, but while he stood and watched the swimmers, he suddenly heard a cry
for help coming from a young man by the name of Fred Hobbs, and despite the fact that he could
not swim, he nevertheless plunged into deep water in a vain attempt to save his fellow student. He sank immediately
and before rescuers could get him he drowned.” The author gives this noble and unselfish deed proper recognition and heads
this story under the caption, “Greater love hath no man than this, that he lay down his life for a
friend.” Surely we can derive great benefit from this heroic account and great pride that Davidson produced a man of
such worth as this. Don’t fail to go by the “Y” room and read these stirring stories, and above all,
the one which tells of a true Davidson MAN.

“You ought to consult a mag. You know how it is nowadays. There’s a specialist for everything. If you have
a cold on your chest, you don’t just go to a doctor anymore—you consult a Pulmonary Specialist. It’s all a
little complicated at first, all you learn what the right names are, but there’s really a big idea behind it.
The point is—you get better service. Just so in this matter of clothing. The college man who knows his way
around, doesn’t go haphazardly to any clothing store for his apparel. He goes to the store that’s known to specialize
in college clothes. That’s why so many campus men come here—they know the clothes we have are right. College styles
by Society Brand—designed according to college men’s ideas. There are none better, and we have the service that goes with
them. We enjoy being consulted.”
