THE DAVIDSONIAN, APRIL 23, 1931

TRACK TEAM MEETS V. M. I. SATURDAY

THE SPORTS PARADE

STATE TRACK MEET MAY 2

B. B. SHOTS By B. B. SUGG

Following yesterday’s game with Duke University, which had not been played as this issue went to press, cries of “peanuts,
cigars, cigarettes, candy, and cold drinks” at varsity ball games played at Davidson were temporarily silenced until 1932. The remaining
games on the varsity schedule will be played on the opposing teams’ home grounds. However, during the first two weeks
of May, the Freshmen have several other teams to meet here, which will undoubtedly be of interest to the student
body in enabling them to observe prospects for the 1932 season.

Upon observing the games played last week, when the varsity won only one of three games, the need for hurlers
has become more and more apparent. However, we believe that the elimination of frequent miscues by the infield would strengthen
the team to a great extent. Lefty Thompson’s pitching against Lenoir Rhyne was way above par, and the best that
Davidson fans have been permitted to see this season. We like the way Lefty works; he wastes no time, and
when he pitches, they usually split the plate.

Incidentally, with track practice constantly going on during games, we wonder that a pitcher is able to tell whether he
is in a ball game or a track meet. Fans, too, are sometimes bothered by observing the game through a
haze of track uniforms. In the same manner, track meets are sometimes hindered greatly by balls knocked out in baseball
practice, and no one would be at all surprised to see a runner in the 440 come sliding into the
tape in the attempt to beat out a ball rolling down the track ahead of him.

Nab Armfield has been doing excellent catching behind the bat, and has seldom been seen to miss a pitched ball.
Proctor, also, on the initial sack, rarely fails to rake ’em in if they are in reasonable reach. And when
a ball is knocked into center field, Bradsher never misses. He covers territory all the way from second base to
the hedge fence, and lets ’em fall softly in the old “tar bucket.”

With wins over Wake Forest and South Carolina, and a loss to Duke by a scant margin of two points,
the Wildcat track team has been clicking excellently. Since their win over South Carolina last Saturday by a margin of
over 50 points, and since South Carolina beat Furman by slightly less than the same score, we figure that the
’Cats are about 90 points better than Furman.

Alec Earle evidently runs by machinery. He takes first place in the mile run, takes a workout of three or
four laps, and then wins first in the two mile. What a man! It seems that we'll have a man
to replace Soup Brannon, whose consistent winning so far has been indispensable in winning meets. We'd like to have a
nickel for every time Soup and Alec have circled the track.

The weakest spot on the team seems to be in the high jump event. A second place in this event
would have been sufficient margin to win the Duke meet for us, but the Davidson jumpers were unable to come
through, and Duke won all three places. Grimey George has consistently taken first place in the high and low hurdles
in all meets, and also placed second in the hundred yard dash against South Carolina last Saturday. His running of
the high hurdles, his specialty, is a superb exhibition of perfect hurdling.

Saturday’s track meet with V. M. I. should be a close and interesting meet, and providing old man Pluvious holds
back his weekly torrents, which he has not done for the last nine consecutive Saturdays, any number of records should
be broken. If McCall should be able to perform, the Wildcat team would be greatly strengthened.

Univ. of S. C. Defeated By Wildcat Cindermen

Fleagle and Earle of Davidson, and Bostick of South Carolina Feature in Meet

Davidson's track team won its second meet of the week last Saturday on Richardson Field by overwhelming the University of
South Carolina cindermen, 89½ to 36½. The Wildcats took first place in ten of the fourteen events and tied for
first in another; while in four events they took all three places. Fred Fleagle, Davidson dash ace, featured the victory
by taking first place in each of the three events he entered, and scored 15 points for the Wildcats to
earn individual honors. George, also of Davidson, scoring 13 points, came in second in the 100-yard dash, and won both
hurdle events. The running of Earle also featured the meet. The Wildcat distance man came in second in the mile
run and then stepped out to win first honors in the two-mile run, barely nosing out Brannon. Bostick, of South
Carolina, showed class in the high jump. After tying with Dupree, a teammate, for first honors, he gave an exhibition
in which he cleared the bar at six feet. Bostick, with eight points, was also high scorer for the losers.
Despite a slow track caused by rains, the time in several of the events was rather fast.

Summary:
100-yard dash — Fleagle (Davidson); George (Davidson); Duvall (South Carolina).

Guilford Quakers Crush Wildcats by 6-2 Score

The Davidson baseball nine tasted rather bitterly of defeat at the hands of the Guilford Quakers here last Friday, the
17th, when the Quakers came out with the big end of a 6 to 2 score. Both teams took advantage
of bobbles and temporary wildness to score their tallies, for there was only one run earned in the whole tilt,
and it was made in the ninth inning by the Guilfordians. The visitors scored four runs on three hits coupled
with two errors made by the Wildcats; a walk, and a hit batsman in the first two innings, at which
time Bailey was relieved by Croker. In the remaining seven innings Croker allowed only six hits, which he kept well
scattered. Nelson, the Quaker heaver, let only seven men pass first base during the entire nine innings.

Wildcat Nine Loses To N. C. State, 9-2

Visitors Score Nine Runs on Eight Safe Blows

On Monday, April 20, Davidson College’s baseball team lost to N. C. State by a score of 9 to 2.
Although the visitors garnered only eight safe hits off Mathis and Bailey during the game, they were given eleven free
passes by the two Davidson pitchers, and the team muffed four times to add to State’s score. Lanning hurled excellent
ball for State throughout the entire nine innings, allowing only seven hits and keeping them well scattered. He held Davidson
scoreless for seven innings when the only error made by State was made by Wilkie, followed by Whitley’s double which
brought in the score. Davidson’s other tally came in the eighth on two singles.The first frame, a base on balls,
a sacrifice by Wilkie, and a hit by Morris for the first score. They scored twice in the second, twice
in the fifth, and four times in the eighth. Morris obtained three of the eight hits allowed his teammates, and
Bernhardt and Goodson divided four of Davidson's seven total.

Wildcats Win From Lenoir-Rhyne Bears
Lefty Thompson Pitches Fine Brand of Ball, Allowing Visitors Only Five Hits
ERDLAY LOSING PITCHER
Proctor’s Triple and Homer Account for Four Runs

Lefty Thompson, Davidson hurler, was in rare form here last Thursday afternoon and his teammates did timely and effective hitting
to give the Davidson Wildcats a 6 to 1 victory over the Lenoir-Rhyne Bears. Thompson surrendered but five hits, whiffed
six, walked but a single man and in the last four innings sent the visiting batsmen back to their benches
in one, two, three order. Proctor’s triple and home run, which scored four runs, featured Davidson's hitting.

Davidson Golfers Score 17½-12 Win Over Furman

Out of four matches played in a golf invasion of South Carolina and Georgia, the Wildcat golf squad won one,
tied one, and lost two. Georgia Tech defeated the Cats at Atlanta by a score of 13 to 5 on
Monday, April 13. On the following day, Davidson lost to University of Georgia, 10 to 8. On Wednesday, the 15th,
Greenville Country Club of Greenville, S. C., was met and tied, 9 to 9. The first entry in the win
column came as Davidson overwhelmed Furman by a score of 17½ to ½. Next Wednesday the team leaves for Sedgefield,
N. C., to play in the annual State Tournament. Last year Jack Pepper won the individual competition over the thirty-six
holes of medal play. Prior to the tournament itself will come two matches. On Thursday the Cats meet Duke and
on Friday Carolina will be played. The tournament will consist of thirty-six holes of medal play. The scores of the
four men who compose each team will be added up and the lowest aggregate team score will win the team
competition. The lowest individual score for the same thirty-six holes will be awarded the State title.
