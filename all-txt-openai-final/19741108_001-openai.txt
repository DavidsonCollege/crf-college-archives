Building Up And Tearing Down

CORNELL

By MARK WILENSKY
Managing Editor

The resignation of Vice-
President for Finance and
Development C. David Cornell
caught most students by sur-
prise. Cornell, credited by
many with keeping the college
on a sound financial basis
during his tenure here, left
Davidson for Cal. Tech.

Cornell explained that
interference from the presi-
dent’s office was a prime
reason for his departure.
He painted a not too rosy
picture of the college’s finan-
cial picture for the future,
warning that unless
something is done, the college
could be down by as much as
$1,000,000 in 1976.

He summed up the state of
the college’s financial hierar-
chy by saying: “The art of
management is the art of get-
ting things done through other
people. Spencer isn’t willing to
do this. He wants to get into
details. The men who replace
me will have to realize that
they must function in a way
that allows the president to
get into a lot of detail.”

Upon arrival this past Sep-
tember, students were in-
troduced to the new E.H. Lit-
tle library. Within a month the
entire structure and plaza
were completely finished. The
building now dominates the
campus.

And while the library’s
aesthetic appeal cannot be
denied, it came not without
problems. Student study
carrels have not yet been
assigned, having once been
returned to the suppliers as
unsatisfactory. The all-night

study rooms remain locked,
and the filing system has not
yet relocated all of the books
from Grey Library.

On Sept. 27, E.H. Little him-
self put the finishing touches
on the library in a well-
attended dedication
ceremony. This was also
Parents’ weekend, and the
campus was a spectacle of
guests and special events. The
gala atmosphere, however,
could not ignore the serious
situation existing “across the
tracks.”

It was reported that David-
son College was acting as a
slum landlord in the black sec-
tion of town. Pictures and in-
terviews with tenants sup-
ported the allegations. College
officials first claimed lack of
knowledge, then denied the
charges.

Houses owned by Davidson
on Ridge Road and Eden
Street were found to be rat in-
fested, ill-kept and in some
cases had broken doors and
cracked windows. At one
house extension cords were
strewn room to room to
operate an old washing
machine. In addition, “squat-
ters” had taken residence in
Davidson-owned buildings.

College President Samuel
R. Spencer Jr. and Business
Manager Robert A. Currie in-
vestigated the charges and
called them untrue. The town
sent in building inspectors
who claimed college-owned
homes passed “all town or-
dinances.” Mayor Sadler’s of-
fice, however, was not satis-
fied. Following an investigation,
federal officials claimed that
75 percent of Davidson’s
homes could not pass federal
codes. The town organized groups to
investigate the problem. At
this point, little progress by
the town has been made.

After reports by the Charlot-
te media, the college sprang
into action. Old homes were
razed and families relocated.
Repairs have been made,
although in no way has the
problem been eliminated. The
Student Government
Association overwhelmingly
approved a resolution deploring the conditions.

Spencer and Currie ex-
pressed regret over the con-
ditions. Spencer, one day prior
to the publication of the in-
vestigation said, “we are by
no means a slum landlord.”
Currie claimed, “the college
wants to get out of the housing
business.” Since the initial
report, Spencer has had
Currie working on the housing
problem.

The laundry remains a con-
troversial issue among college officials.
According to Currie, all single
students will be required to
pay a compulsory laundry fee
through the 1977-78 school
year. Last year the laundry
operated at a loss of $7398.
Paying the fee for the first
time, a group of women
organized by Dana English ob-
jected to the laundry doing
women’s clothes. As a result,
two bins now exist in the laun-
dry, one for men’s clothes and
one for women’s.

Men and women students
have tried for years to get the
laundry to change to a volun-
tary system. While men have
petitioned and complained for
years, this year’s policy con-
cessions to women students
was the first policy change in
years.

“Since it is not feasible to
operate on a voluntary basis,
the fee must remain compulso-
ry as long as we continue
in the laundry business,”
Currie stated.

“It’s just our feeling that
we’d lose money with a volun-
tary operation. That’s just my
opinion,” he added. “I don’t
foresee the laundry being
voluntary.”

The question of censorship
has commanded much student
attention in the last few
weeks. Spencer decided that
certain “tasteless” words
must be deleted from the 1974
edition of “Quips and
Cranks.” Student editor Jeff
George refused and the issue
was stalemated. Student
representatives of campus
organizations joined with
George to protest the ad-
ministration’s censorship
policies.

Students retained an at-
torney and threatened the
college with a suit focusing on
the issue of a free press. Since
the Board of Trustees were
