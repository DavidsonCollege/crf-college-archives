Act Now Against Global Warming

Enormous storms. Killer heat waves. Devastating droughts. The 1990s were the hottest decade on record, with a major increase in
weather extremes.

Climate scientists now overwhelmingly agree that global warming is real, and that increased temperatures will lead to rising sea levels,
destruction of forests, the spread of tropical diseases, and more.

Polluters Wage War. To meet these threats, 179 nations recently adopted the Kyoto Protocol, which calls for real steps to
reduce global warming. But the United States has lagged behind, pressured by a powerful coalition of polluting companies such as
Ford, GM, and Exxon — the Global Climate Coalition (GCC).

The GCC’s main goal is to stop any real action to curb global warming. Fight Back. Davidson College holds a
large portfolio of stocks — including, very likely, stocks in the companies that make up the GCC. So join the
Cool the Planet campaign and demand that our school divest from any companies who are part of this polluters’ lobby.
