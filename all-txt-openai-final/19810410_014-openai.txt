2—The Muse Paper

Stephen

Stephen flew out the house so fast
slamming doors behind red sneakers

mud on the carpet
old oak doors still echo
in the hollow rooms

He trampled Mama’s favorite rose garden

Daddy never fixed the gate

Stephen never shuts it

it creaks on stormy nights

He trampled Mama's favorite rose garden

Stephen ran away from home
with a bag lunch in his kerchief

he left the jelly out
Mama knows he’s gone

The butter knife rests in peace

on the jelly jar lid

while the Big Kitchen frowns

He trampled Mama’s favorite rose garden

Stephen left his room a mess
yesterday's socks on the floor,

jeans on his dresser,
slingshot on his bed
Boy, is he gonna get it

He trampled Mama’s favorite rose garden

Mama rocks and rocks

on the saggy front porch
with her grey head bowed

clutching a rose in her fingers—

all that’s left

she listens for the creak of the gate
as she rocks her sorrow to sleep.

American funeral today

Just Momma and TV and

mouth agape, in

63: 3 yrs. old stood

watching the sad eyes in NY dissolving

into the black parade of a flag-draped casket.
Momma why, and do all people die

like that and in a church like that?

All have a funeral and go to heaven.

Famous men and Presidents go

through St. Patrick’s, he guessed.

Will you remember him for me? she

hugged the child.

He stared at the precision salutes of the USA
and Momma’s swallowed tears.

Turned the pictures of The Torch Has Passed...
A big black coffee table book on JFK.

One black and white shot showed that

36 raised his hand with no smile and swore

an oath on a Bible in an airplane.

Why don’t we put the bumper sticker

on the bumper? It says, he points,

LBJ for the USA.

We're from Texas and

he is too, isn’t he. That's right, he’s not running in 68.

Yet the TV showed Others Frantically

Running in

68: 8 yrs. old climbing

into Daddy's lap and arms.

Now look and remember, Daddy asked
with rare damp sad eyes.

And they watched a Sirhan shot senator—
Look,

Free ‘at last, free at last, Thank God Almighty—
Look

at the black and white tears in black-and-white.

St. Patrick’s Cathedral

Headlines recited

GOP elected 37 Pres in 68

despite the fact he wanted his parents’
Democrat. But not, in

72: 12 yrs. old stared in astounded shock
and questioned why an Alabama nominee
that Daddy said was a racist, sort of,

was sort of dead.

73: 13 yrs. old came home early from school

with Momma’s signed excuse,

To see the televised coverage

of the funeral of 36 LBJ

While Momma cried, because she was from Texas
and he was too...

78: 18 yrs. old swallowed heavily over

the phone with Momma and Daddy

when the Vice-Pres. and Sen.

“Happy Warrior” Minnesotan HHH died, wasted.

He was LBJ’s and Momma's VP.

79: 19 yrs. old saw Iranians
holding 52

In a rage. People screaming
at the CBS glass eye barrel
and never at themselves.

In a rage, he punched

off the TV, and took a shot
of J&B.

Black screen stared at him,
scared, shaking and silent.

Turley Howard

Vivien Leigh burns down Atlanta

My parents first saw that film
In the Empire Theatre, Maryport
Sometime in the late thirties just before
Uncle Tys got sent down for stealing
Loose coal off the railway cutting
(The Railway’s property so the Railway's lawyer said)
To keep warm in winter his wife from Moss Bay
And their five children, one consumptive.
That is to say: during our
Hard times, seventy years after your misery.
And the people there
Are still hard parish-bound members
Caught between a cold, fishless firth
And the empty, unprofitable coal-seams.
And strangers live as far away
As the next street but one.

On the Iredell County School Board
The faces are the same
As the Maryport Magistrates’ Bench.

Even the names sound alike and somewhere in the room
Are Fenwick, Crellin, Haston, Lowther and Graham.

Here the inflexion, the rhythms of speech are pure

Workington North Side sometimes.

The faces: scarred numb by the uncomprehended

Isolation, dull local hebetude of the bounded

Life:
Mooresville, NC.

To travel three thousand miles from home

And find the remains of your own neighbours

At a distance of two hundred years.

You good old boys

You recidivist rednecks

You Southern Gents

White mansions

Back porches

greeyuts

Fried chicken

Wild turkey

Doc Watson

Jack Daniel

Virgil Cain

D.W. Griffith

Jimmy Carter

Tom Dooley

Robert E. Lee

Rhett Butler
All you who dream of Dixie and then look away

Scarlett was an English girl who never got
her tongue around the accent

And died years later, divorced

Lonely, drug addict, mad some said

And tonight, an alien in this land

I shall tell a Southern Belle:

Who finds slightly false to her ears
The note struck by an English lover.
