**New Police Chief Chosen**

By DUNCAN V. FRASER ’86

The town of Davidson has gained Jack Warlick as the new Chief of Police. Although Chief Warlick has only been with the Davidson Force for 2½ months, he looks forward to an auspicious future and sees no major changes or problems that would affect either the town or the college. As the Chief put it, “Davidson is a small town and its crimes are more larcenies, domestic calls, and minor offenses rather than murders or other types of major crimes.”

Chief Warlick has quite an impressive list of credentials from his past eleven years in law enforcement. Warlick attended Military Police School while in the service at Ft. Gordon, Georgia, and served in Vietnam. Returning to the states, he continued his military service as an Honor Guard at Ft. Sheridan, Illinois. Upon leaving the service, Warlick spent one year on the police force of Newton, N.C. and then joined the Burke County Police Department where he attained the rank of Shift Commander before coming to Davidson. Furthermore, Warlick attended Western Piedmont Community College where he earned a degree in Police Science and Gardner-Webb College where he completed his Bachelor of Social Science. Chief Warlick has also earned the Criminal Justice Education and Training Standards Commission’s Certificate, the highest law enforcement certificate in North Carolina.

Chief Warlick hopes to be able to improve the police force as its new Police Chief. “We have enough manpower,” he says, “and the only thing that could be improved is the mechanics” of the system. With only six to seven calls on an average day and a population of about 3200 including the college, the Chief says that the 6 full-time and 1 part-time members of the force are more than adequate. The Davidson campus police are a branch of the town’s force, although they work at the direction of the college administration rather than the town. Warlick is aware of this unique situation and would like to see the town force “have a closer working relationship with the campus police.” For the most part, however, the only issues in which the town police participate are complaints of excessive noise, off-campus traffic violations, and major crimes, such as the theft of property from Belk Dorm over this past summer.

Chief Warlick came to Davidson primarily for professional advancement and looks forward to working with both the town and the college. Considering Chief Warlick’s credentials and his experience in small-town law enforcement, most would agree that Davidson has gained a new police chief who is a credit to the law enforcement community.

**Community Liaison Chosen**

By MELISSA MCKEITHEN ’83

The SGA Campus-Community Liaison Committee was established last fall as a means of opening communications and promoting interaction between Davidson College students and members of the Davidson Community. This fall the CCLC will make its first appointment to a position which it has been working on for nearly a year. The position is a student liaison position between students of the college and members of the town council. CCLC members Sherburne Laughlin and Melissa McKeithen have discussed this proposal with council members individually and they have agreed to the possibility of its benefits as well. The following is the proposal which the SGA has accepted.

“Because there are, at times, matters before the town council which may involve students of Davidson College and because the council may at some time need a contact among the students, the Student Government Association Campus-Community Liaison Committee wishes to propose the establishment of a student liaison.”Position. It is not the intention of the committee to make this a voting committee member or one who is involved in affairs which are not of concern to the students. The position should be mutually advantageous to both students and the town. This position will mean:

1) Representation of Davidson College students as concerned members of the Davidson community in matters of direct concern to Davidson College students.
2) Providing council members with direct and organized access to Davidson College students, thereby allowing a clear and reliable channel of communication between the town and the students.
3) Making other students aware of activities, concerns, and events of the town.
4) To serve as a specific channel for the concerns and ideas of the student body. This representative will refer students to specific council members and/or committees.

Nationwide Campus Population Rises

(CPS) Defying predictions, college enrollment will increase as much as two percent again this fall, thanks largely to an influx of part-time and older students, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) says.

The NCES itself has been one of the most consistent predictors of dramatic decreases in college enrollments, pinning its projections to the number of 18-to-24-year-olds in the population — traditionally the prime age bracket for college enrollment. In 1980, for instance, NCES said college enrollment would peak in 1981 at 11.7 million students, and then begin a steady decline lasting through the 1980s.

But 1981 enrollment topped 12.3 million. This year, NCES projects enrollment will hit 12.5 million. The agency now predicts enrollment will begin a slow descent in 1984, leveling off at around 12 million by 1990.

“The college-age population did peak in 1981, just as we predicted,” explains Dr. Vance Grant, director of NCES’s annual Back-to-School Forecast. “What we weren’t counting on were so many older students coming back to school.”

The 18-to-24-year-old group swelled to 29.5 million people last year, but will decline by half-million increments roughly every two years to 25 million by 1990, Grant says. “Ten years ago nobody would have guessed we’d have as many older students as we do now,” he explains. “So while we’ll be getting fewer and fewer full-time, traditional students, that decrease will be offset by the influx of non-traditional enrollees.”

He speculates that two-year community colleges will get most of those students. Another recent study predicted a four-percent population boom for two-year schools this fall.

The economy and the need for more people to occupy high technology fields are probably the two main reasons for the increasing numbers of people returning to school, Grant adds. “I think a lot of it is job-oriented,” he says. “Some of it may reflect the affluence in some parts of society where people have more leisure time. And the economy and unemployment in other sectors of society are also factors. When job opportunities are not too good, people look for something that will give them an edge.”

Arson Gang Snuffed; Three Arrested

By JEFF HOLLAND ’84

Mecklenburg County Police arrested four Davidson teenagers over the summer and charged them with arson in connection with a fire two and a half years ago which destroyed a Cornelius shopping center. The police learned of the possible involvement of the youths during an investigation of a fire at the J. King Harrison Warehouse in Charlotte.

The 1980 Cornelius fire destroyed a Western Auto Store and about four other stores. At the time, County fire investigators were not sure if the fire was a result of arson, and the cause was listed as undetermined.
