George Bush will continue the Republican prosperity

R. Anders Nilsson

In 1980, inflation was 13.5 percent and interest rates reached 21.5 percent. The “misery index,” which measures how healthy an economy is by combining the rate of inflation with the rate of unemployment, stood at 19.5 percent. A “malaise” had set over America that brought despair to consumers on fixed incomes who witnessed a steady escalation in prices. Soaring interest rates dashed young couples’ hopes of purchasing their own homes. The average income of black families fell 12.5 percent between 1978 and 1981. While the weakest in the economy were hurt the most, middle-income earners and the wealthy suffered as well. Once again, the Democratic Party had promised solutions to the economic worries of Americans, and had failed to deliver.

In desperation, voters turned to Republican candidate Ronald Reagan, in the hope that the economy’s steady decline could be reversed by the former California governor’s belief that under Jimmy Carter, the Federal government had hindered the economy more than helped it, and that a program of spending and tax cuts would energize the economy, lifting it out of the stagnation of the Carter years. Following a recession in 1981-’82 (the last gasp of the Carter administration’s economic program), the domestic economy entered into the longest peacetime expansion in the nation’s history, creating more than 17 million new jobs between 1982 and 1987. By the end of the Reagan Administration’s most recent calendar year in office, the misery index had dropped to a low 10.5 percent, the prime interest rate had fallen to 8.22 percent, and the rate of inflation had plummeted to 3.7 percent. Housing had become more affordable, and building starts had increased. Real income for black families had risen 14 percent between 1982 and 1987, and, from 1983 to 1986, almost 900,000 black families escaped poverty. The Reagan-Bush Administration cut the top marginal tax rate from 70 percent to 28 percent, spurring investment in an economy ravaged by the tax and spend policies of the Democrats.

How are these facts relevant to the 1988 election? In the words of Vice President George Bush, speaking before the 1988 Republican National Convention, “When you have to change horses in midstream, doesn’t it make sense to switch to the one who’s going the same way?”

The facts speak for themselves. The U.S. economy has witnessed an unparalleled period of economic growth and prosperity. Men and women, blacks and whites, as well as management and labor, have all benefited. The Democratic candidate for President, Massachusetts Governor Michael S. Dukakis, is clearly swimming in the wrong direction with respect to the national economy. He has referred to the domestic economy as a “swiss cheese economy,” full of holes. The holes of which the Governor speaks, however, are either minute or nonexistent, as a majority of the 17 million new jobs created since 1982 pay an average of more than $22,000 a year.

Why, then, would the American people elect as president a governor who: A) in his first term imposed the largest tax increase in Massachusetts history ($540 million), B) in his third term sought a $222 million tax increase (which the Massachusetts legislature refused to pass), and C) engineered a state government spending increase of 72 percent from 1983 through 1987 (an increase that outpaced the cost of living by four times)? To elect Dukakis would return the nation’s economy to the days of Carter malaise and place the well-being of working Americans at risk.Americans in the hands of a governor whose state’s property taxes are high would be jeopardizing their economic futures by electing a governor whose economic program so resembles the failed policies of the Carter Administration. The American people have a historic opportunity to choose a president whose policies will continue the present economic expansion while addressing serious fiscal concerns, the greatest of which is the federal budget deficit. The answer to this and other economic questions cannot be found in the failed tax and spend policies of the Democrats. George Bush and the Republican Party offer the American people hope for the future, built on the accomplishments of the past.

Bush Presidency a must for an effective foreign policy
Warren Cooksey

The most clear-cut constitutional responsibilities of the President of the United States—other than his primary duty of executing the law, of course—are concerned with defense and foreign policy. Thus, when this year’s candidates are considered, two questions arise: first, who would make a better commander-in-chief? Secondly, who would form a foreign policy which would be of greatest benefit to the United States? The answer to both of these questions is George Bush.

To begin with, George Bush would make a more effective commander-in-chief. Having witnessed the success of American actions in Grenada, Libya, and the Persian Gulf, he understands the need for limited demonstrations of force in some cases. Michael Dukakis, on the other hand, is on the advisory board of the Jobs With Peace Campaign, which considers such actions “threatening.” Dukakis opposed U.S. involvement in the Persian Gulf; however, American actions there destroyed most of the Iranian fleet, which led to the cessation of conflict. The citizens of Grenada are much happier now, and it has been a long time since we heard anything threatening out of Libya.

In addition, George Bush would run a far more effective program of arms control negotiations. The INF Treaty is proof positive that the principle of negotiating from strength is sound. Furthermore, it is highly likely that Michael Dukakis would act too hastily to cut weapons, a supposition based on his support for the nuclear freeze in the early 1980s. In order to preserve fairness, slow, deliberate negotiations are best. Finally, a Bush team would be more experienced in arms control, since Republicans have been working on it for the past seven years.

The Middle East presents another problem in foreign policy; one that Michael Dukakis would only exacerbate. While I doubt that anyone has a solution to the Middle East dilemma acceptable to all parties, George Bush’s experience and approach would be more beneficial.
