**Wildcats Drop Slugfest to UNC-C, 13-12**

By BOB BARNES

Davidson dropped a 13-12 decision to UNCC in baseball Wednesday afternoon in the wildest game of the season. The game featured seven different pitchers (five from UNCC), three home runs, five lead changes, one ejection, one bench-clearing, and one post-game parking lot confrontation.

Scott Redding, making his second start of the season, gave himself early support in the first inning with a three-run, opposite-field homer. Scott Weaver’s sacrifice fly brought in the fourth run of the inning. UNCC got back two of the runs with a home run of their own and then added three unearned runs in the fourth to go ahead 5-4.

The Cats scored another four runs in the fifth on the strength of RBIs from Philip Gordon, Weaver, and Redding. The lead was short-lived, however, as UNCC scored twice in the bottom half of the inning and added three more runs in the sixth on James Dickerson’s homer.

The eighth inning provided fireworks on both sides. Davidson opened the inning with walks to Chip Knox and Keith Helfant. After two outs, Gordon walked to load the bases. Weaver then lined a two-strike single up the middle to drive in a pair of runs. All hell broke loose at the plate as on-deck batter Redding showed his disgust with the UNCC catcher (who intentionally left his mask in the baseline) by throwing the mask over the fence. The umpire immediately showed his disapproval by throwing Redding out of the game. The entire UNCC team charged a lonely Redding at the plate. No punches were thrown, but the UNCC catcher somehow managed to shove Redding and remain in the game.

Jeff McSwain put the melee behind him and drilled an RBI single to left to knot the score. Doug Wiley walked on three balls and Bob Barnes’ infield hit scored Weaver to put the Cats ahead 12-11. UNCC responded with a pair of runs in the eighth off reliever Wiley (1-1), but the Cats were unable to pull ahead in the ninth. John Mahoney, Weaver, McSwain, Redding, and Barnes all had two hits apiece, and Weaver and Redding each had four RBIs.

Earlier in the week, the Cats split a home-and-home series against Pfeiffer.

**Men’s Tennis Opens Tournament**

By TIM MCGAUGHEY

The men’s tennis team played tough, exciting tennis yesterday, winning eight out of nine matches in the opening round of the Southern Conference tournament here at Davidson. The team won five of six singles matches and all three doubles matches. The Cats played tough, pressure tennis winning five three-set matches.

Senior Victor Taylor was ecstatic over the team’s play. “In the four years I’ve been here, this is the best that we’ve done on the first day,” he said. Coach Jeff Frank said, “This is the best start we’ve had since we won the tournament in 1973.” Frank explained that the key to the team’s success was great play in crucial three-set matches. Two such victories over Appalachian State provided crucial points which put the team in a tie for second place.

Leading the tournament is Furman with 45 points followed by the favored University of Tennessee Chattanooga and Davidson tied with 41 points. The Cats lead two conference opponents, Appalachian State and the Citadel, that they lost to in the regular season. Both teams have only 29 points. Far behind are VMI with 11 points, East Tennessee and Marshall with 8 points, and Western Carolina with 4 points.

The scoring system gives eight points for the champ, seven for the runner-up, and so on until the eighth place team receives one point. Each person plays three matches and receives points based on the minimum position that that player can end up even if that person loses all the rest of his matches.

The Cats completed the regular season this week with a final 15-10 record. During the week the team posted a 1-2 record. Saturday the Cats lost to ASU 5-4 on hard courts. Tuesday the team demolished Marshall 9-0 before falling to regular season champ UTC by the score of 7-2. The SC Tournament continues through Saturday.Gets Into Wilderness
By EMMA CARNE

For anyone keen to venture out of the confines of the Davidson campus and into the great outdoors, the Outing Club is the ideal means. Funded by the Union and run by students, the Outing Club organizes biking trips, mountaineering and backpacking excursions, as well as more exotic trips such as white-water rafting. It also provides a variety of equipment for free loan, including canoes, backpacks, sleeping bags and camping paraphernalia. (These are available on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 7-8 pm in the Tora Room.)

The Outing Club's purpose is to get people into the “wilderness,” release them from everyday pressures, and also provide a valuable educational experience. The new President, Bob Bruce, is keen for Davidson students to realize the potential of the club and make full use of its many resources. Most outings and excursions are free or cost a nominal sum, and they are open to all who are willing to get out and enjoy themselves in the fresh air.

This term’s outings have included biking almost every Saturday and two backpacking trips. A two-day bike ride is scheduled for this weekend, and a white-water rafting expedition next weekend. Further, the club sponsored the Spring Frolics scavenger hunt and also organizes Ultimate Frisbee every Friday and New Games at weekends. Bruce plans to arrange for speakers to come and talk at the meetings next winter; he also intends to help promote student environmental awareness and to send donations to various relevant charities such as the Greenpeace Foundation. He has brochures and information for anybody who is interested in working at summer camps or learning wilderness skills from such organizations.

In the first game, the visiting Falcons exploded for eleven runs in the final two innings to best the Wildcats 16-8. The Wildcats wasted 14 hits in the loss, including three hits by Barnes and two each by Tim Waters, Mahoney, Redding (both for extra bases), Knox and Helfant. One of Waters’ hits was an inside-the-park homerun in which the Pfeiffer right fielder lost a catch by running into the fence. Matt Walker (2-5) struck out five, but fell victim to seven errors.

In the return trip, Davidson avenged its loss by knocking off Pfeiffer 8-7. Mick Smith’s three-run double in the fifth keyed the win. Mahoney added a 3-5 performance — good for 3 RBIs — as did Barnes. Helfant and Redding each collected doubles in the decisive four-run eighth inning. Behind some good fielding, Barnes picked up his second win in a row to up his season record to 3-5, despite yielding 13 hits. The Cats now have a record of 8-19. They host conference foe Western Carolina this Saturday.

Women’s Tennis Now 17-5
By STEVE SOUD

The women’s tennis team enjoyed a banner week and enhanced their chances for a bid to the NCAA Division III national championships by building their record to 17-5 with wins over Division I schools UNCC and Appalachian State.

On Monday they trounced UNCC 7-2. ‘Nuff said. Tuesday they stunned the Apps, who had won the match the last four years, with a late comeback. At the end of the singles the match was tied 3-3, and the first doubles team clouded hopes with a loss. The other two doubles teams set about hammering nails in their coffin as they fell behind. They came back to life, however, and pulled off a thrilling rally for the 5-4 win.

“It was a very exciting win because they’re a scholarship program,” Coach Caroline Brown said. “We usually have to win in singles, but we won in doubles.” It was a crucial win, because on Tuesday Brown will be waiting by the phone for the national selection committee to call. After the wins Brown figures, “I would have to think our odds are better.”

The squad is already psyched to play Furman next Thursday in the regular season’s final match, which will be the seniors’ last home match.
