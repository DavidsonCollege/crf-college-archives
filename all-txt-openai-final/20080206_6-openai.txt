**APTS & Writer’s**

The Hollywood writers’ strike began on Nov. 5, when members of the Writers Guild of America (WGA) refused to produce scripts for sitcoms, late-night TV, and films. Strikers picketed outside Los Angeles and New York studios, demanding “residuals” - higher payment for work that is broadcasted online or on DVD. The WGA’s primary opponent is the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP).

According to a YouTube promotional supporting the WGA’s strike, writers get four cents for a $19.99 DVD. The same rate applies to all media sold on iTunes and similar websites. When VHS was developed, writers willingly endured an 80% decrease in pay in order to help the fledgling film industry. Now that the industry is booming, the movie and TV producers have yet to increase the writers’ pay rate. The WGA would like to double the DVD rate to eight cents. Michael Winship, the president of WGA East, said, “The seven-word mantra is: ‘When you get paid, we get paid.’” Nick Counter, president of the AMPTP, countered, “The DVD issue is a roadblock to these negotiations.”

The strike has made waves in both the film industry and the Southern California and New York economies. Thousands of small businesses get their revenue exclusively from entertainment studios and production companies. These businesses provide such necessities as lighting, technology, costume, and food for the film industry. According to Smart Answers columnist Karen E. Klein on Nov. 12, these small businesses have all lost their revenues; some even have gone out of business. The economic effects are massive in L.A., reaching nearly one billion dollars. L.A. is home to the 26th largest economy in the world, where most TV and film-related businesses are located.

Television viewers have felt the effects of the strikes ever since the writers began the strike. Jay Leno, David Letterman, and Jon Stewart went off the air because of the strike, while NBC broadcasted reruns of their shows. Nights off the air cost a TV host an estimated $100,000 per night. If the strike goes on long enough, daytime chat shows and soap operas may be affected as well. Daytime shows record about a week before transmission, while TV dramas and comedies have scripts planned months in advance. Films are the last to suffer, since they have pre-written scripts months in advance and more time for production than TV.

In late January, Jay Leno and Conan O’Brien went back on the air and have been improvising their shows since their return. Both plan to use their time back on the air to support the WGA. One way they believe they can prove the importance of writers is by showing just how poor quality their shows are without scripts. O’Brien wrote, “Of course my show will not be as good. In fact, in moments, it may be terrible.”

**Rock it out**

Whether your ideal night of music means watching the latest undiscovered funk rock band or singing along to a group rendition of “Bad Moon Rising,” Charlotte’s Tosco Music Party was guaranteed to bring musical flavors to savor. On Jan. 26, the neoclassical-inspired Dale F. Halton Theater of Central Piedmont Community College transformed into a venue for a night of eclectic music featuring nearly 20 performers from around the world.

The Tosco Music Party, less formally known as the TMP, was created 22 years ago by talented guitar and arts aficionado, John Tosco. Outlined in the TMP Mission Statement, Tosco believes it is their “mission to present a wide variety of acoustic music...[with] a sense of community...[and] to provide a venue in which professional and amateur musicians can meet.” Tosco gained his inspiration for this informal concert from his own jam sessions at home. He commented, “What started in our living rooms has moved on to larger venues” with musical friends and family. Held tri-annually in Charlotte and again for the fifth time at the CPCC location, the winter-season TMP once again proved to be a musical smorgasbord of high-quality acoustic performances.

Starting at 6 p.m., people of all ages gathered in an impressively long line, waiting to claim a seat for the 7 p.m. sold-out show. And by 7:30, the eager crowd enjoyed an informal and friendly welcome from Tosco himself. He quickly gave the stage over to the brave first act—12-year-old singer-songwriter Maddie Shuler, whose soft melodies inspired by her family (who were present at the concert and claimed about two rows) could rival most ballads.well be terrible.” One Virginia viewer commented, “You feel like saying, ‘Can these people do anything by themselves, without writers?’ It looks like the answer may be no. David Letterman owns his own company, Worldwide Pants, which in turn owns his late-night TV show. Accordingly, he plans to forge a separate agreement with the WGA. Fortunately, the strike could be coming to a close. The WGA is having “informal talks” with Hollywood executives, such as Walt Disney Company Chief Executive Bob Iger and News Corporation President Peter Chernin. The WGA has even signed interim agreements with some independent film studios and TV production companies, although discussion still continues between the WGA and the AMPTP. Even if the WGA and the AMPTP reach a resolution, the 12,500 members of the WGA would have to ratify the terms. This strike could make a positive impact, spurring frustrations and creativity.

‘America’s Next Top Model’ writers on strike with WGA

THE DAVIDSONIAN WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 6, 2008

on the entertainment industry. Daniel Tokle of Lakewood, California wrote, “The bright side is that maybe unknown writers like me will be able to get their work noticed out of sheer desperation. Hopefully, they will find the talented, unnoticed writers that were unable to get their scripts noticed.” One man from Spring, Texas was cynical about current TV programming and saw the strike as a chance that “...we might get to rethink how to entertain.” Since the strike appears to be coming to an end, we may not gain these benefits. However, we have learned how much we need our writers to keep us happy, amused, and inspired.

with Charlotte’s Tosco Music Party

The Healing Force Nigerian quartet

Other performances included: a pan-flutist, blues duo, Americana group, all-female quartet, bluegrass group, and an eclectic quartet. One highlight of the evening was a performance by classical pianist Harriette Line Thompson, a Charlotte legend whose elegant talent has led her to Southeast Asia, New Zealand, Australia, and all over Europe. As proof that music does keep you alive, to this day, 90-year-old Thompson still runs marathons in Aspen. Another impressive performance came from Charlotte’s newest trendy a cappella ensemble, VOX, conducted by talented Yale graduate David Tang. They silenced the audience with a moving piece entitled “Judgment.”

Two of the more original performances of the night came from upbeat, ethnic groups. Jamie Laval and Ashley Broder made up a Celtic violinist and mandolin duo that revolutionized traditional Scottish and Irish tunes by bending the simple melodies around new sequences and creating a playful dialogue between the instruments. The result was phenomenal. A Nigerian African quartet called “The Healing Force” provided another opportunity to admire the talent of world-music performers located right in Charlotte. Using a set of traditional African drums, “The Healing Force” enacted a “call-and-response” dynamic with the audience by using Nigerian phrases of well-wishing. After only a few minutes, “The Healing Force” had energized the audience and calmed their spirits.

Interspersed throughout the acts were five sing-alongs. A group of 13 singers and musicians performed the songs “You Got It,” “You Belong to Me,” “I Want You Back,” “Bad Moon Rising,” “Mrs. Robinson,” and “There’s a Place in the World for a Gambler.” The sing-alongs added an enjoyable, interactive dimension to the evening. Those who were familiar or unfamiliar with the lyrics belted out their enjoyment.

Directly after the performance, tables set up with CDs, t-shirts, and information on the performing groups opened. People seized the chance to buy up the merchandise, as the TMP shows rarely feature the same artist twice. The next show will be Apr 12 at 7 p.m. at the Dale F. Halton Theater. Call 704.330.6534, or visit www.toscomusicparty.com. If you cannot make this performance, not to worry. On the first Wednesday of every month there is a smaller, open-mic version of the TMP at 8 p.m. at the Evening Muse in uptown Charlotte. Call 704.376.3737 or visit www.theeveningmuse.com to learn more about this event. No matter which event you attend, you will not be disappointed.
