Hockey wins 4 out of 5 games in a week and readies for state

by Jim Northrup ’82

Davidson’s field hockey team won three of four games in five days of play during the past week. The Cats
beat Richmond 2-1 on Friday, whomped VCU 2-0 on Saturday morning, fell to Division I Duke 1-0 in Monday’s home
game, and defeated Wake Forest 2-1 on Tuesday.

Athlete of the Week

Richmond scored first on an especially rough field. Caroline Scragg tied the game up five minutes later. Amy Crittenberger scored
again for Davidson in the second half: “That was the best game we’ve had this season,” said Coach Mayes. “Our
offense took it all up and down the field; the defense really supported the offense. They’re getting used to their
positions and to each other now. It was a team effort.”

Amy Crittenberger, Field Hockey

Amy, a junior from McLean, Virginia, continued her hustling, consistent play that has made her a team leader this season
as the Field Hockey team went 4-1 for the second half of the season. She has played excellent ball despite
a nagging hip injury she received three weeks ago, and scored two goals in games over Richmond and Wake Forest.

Neither cold Virginia weather nor a rough field stopped the Cats on Saturday morning. Lou Hamilton scored for Davidson in
the first half and sophomore Courtney Hall scored Davidson’s second goal in the second half. Said Mayes, “We weren’t as
sharp as we were against Richmond. We were patient, we played our positions, and we communicated well on the field.”
