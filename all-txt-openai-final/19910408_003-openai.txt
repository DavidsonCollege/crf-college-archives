The SGA reconvened on April 2 after a week’s break for spring vacation. Cammie Covington began with old business that had been waiting for approval, and the proposal to create the new SGA Athletics Council to replace the old Athletics Committee. She also read aloud a letter from Ambassador Jack Perry who was responding to a letter he had received two weeks before from the SGA. The SGA had thanked him for his positive comments about the student body in the most recent issue of the Davidson Journal.

Michelle Blake addressed the SGA on the first item of new business. Solidarity Week begins Sunday, April 7. The week will be called “Frolics with a Focus” to help tie in the events of the week with Spring Frolics. Many events have been planned, and YSSC sponsors a program on Leadership Training. On Friday, there will be activities on the football field, and on Saturday there will be a reggae band behind the Commons. Look for details about the events around campus.

Susan Daniels reported next. On April 17 at 7 pm in Eu Hall, Bonnie McAlister will be leading a program on leadership training. The program is open to all students interested in leadership skills at Davidson and beyond. Jackie Carberry was appointed by the SGA as chair of the Security Committee, and John Beyer and Catherine Turner were appointed to the newly-formed Athletics Council.

The final item of business discussed was the proposal for the SGA budget for 1991-92. After much explanation, debate, and comparison to the past year’s budget, the SGA voted to pass the budget. Class senators will be elected soon.

Hunger Awareness
By Jackie Carberry & Mary Russ

As we sit in our rooms late at night, studying for our big test, munching on Doritos and slurping a soda, it is often easy to forget the plight of those less fortunate than ourselves. Those who will never see a bag of chips or a can of soda for as long as they live. Those who go for days, sometimes weeks, without a bite to eat. Those who lead a morbid, depressed life yearning for mere morsels of the sustenance we take for granted every day.

Anyone who participated in the Oxfam Fast last November got a taste of the bitter yearning that hunger can inflict. For us, however, it was an experiment. For others, it is a way of life. Statistics report that 20 million Americans go hungry every day. Many of the hungry are also without homes. According to the National Student Campaign Against Hunger & Homelessness, we produce enough food to feed everyone in the world. Yet, one person dies from hunger-related causes every forty seconds.

If any of these statistics have disturbed or moved you at all, perhaps it is time for you to take action. On Saturday, April 13th, the Hunger Awareness Committee of the YSSC will be sponsoring Davidson’s First Annual Hunger Cleanup. Part of a nationwide effort, we'll be joining over 500 other schools across the country to fight hunger and homelessness while...

Rape Awareness Holds Campus Forum
By Frances Morton

On Tuesday, April 2, the Rape Concerns Committee presented a forum on Campus Rape. The committee presented a film followed by a candid discussion of rape on the Davidson campus. The Rape Concerns Committee, founded last year as a subcommittee of the Women’s Concerns Committee, was begun because some of its members felt that the issue was not receiving the attention it needed on campus. They have been successful in addressing this important issue and have gotten people talking by speaking to first-year students, the eating houses, and other interested groups.

Sara Carlson and Rob Kelley, members of the committee, hosted the presentation. Kelley joined the group after a friend came to him seeking comfort after being accosted and he realized how helpless he was to help her. Carlson also knows several people on campus who have been raped and would like to increase awareness. The film, hosted by Susan Dey and Corbin Bernsen, consisted of four interviews with college women who had been raped. Two of the women had been accosted by strangers, the other two by men they knew and had initially trusted. One out of every six women on the average college...Campus will have been raped or found themselves a victim of attempted rape before.

Robertson Speaks On Non-Coital Reproduction
By George Lafaye

Dr. John Robertson, professor of law at the University of Texas at Austin, spoke at Davidson on Thursday, April 5. The topic of his discussion was the legal and ethical aspects of non-coital reproduction. He spoke about such specific methods as in vitro fertilization, embryo freezing, and the use of surrogate mothers.

The lecture was part of a continuing series of lectures by the Medical Humanities program, with support from the Area Health Education Center of the Carolina’s Medical Center.

Dr. Robertson began with what he considers to be the constitutional right to procreative freedom: the right to have babies is the corollary to the right not to have one, as expressed in the Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade. He believes that persons who are allowed to procreate sexually should be allowed to utilize whatever technology they can afford to have a baby.

Concerning this last point, Dr. Robertson emphasized that access to this technology would be limited by a person’s ability to pay. He compared this to other rights saying, “I have the right to go to Washington and petition the government, but that doesn’t mean I have the right to have the government pay for my plane ticket.”

He continued his talk by looking at different methods for non-coital reproduction and the specific legal and ethical issues associated with each.

First, he reviewed in vitro fertilization which is used in women with blocked fallopian tubes. Many ethical issues arise from this method because ten or more eggs are fertilized in order to increase chances of bringing one to term. Parts of the anti-abortion movement believe that it would be wrong to deny any of these eggs the opportunity to go to term, but that is often medically impossible to implant all the embryos because of the risk of dangerous multiple births. Dr. Robertson answers this by saying, “All experts agree that an embryo is not a person and as such does not have rights or interests.” Thus, the state would have no right to intervene on behalf of an embryo to keep it from being allowed to deteriorate.

One of science’s answers to the questions of extra embryos is to freeze them. Therefore, if the initial attempt at fertilization fails, a later attempt can be made. This would be done without the initial hormone therapy and surgery necessary for the first stage of in vitro fertilization. For Dr. Robertson, this is a useful technology which “should be permitted,” but he recognizes the need to formulate stronger agreements between the two parties before freezing begins.

The necessity for this was illustrated in the recent Tennessee case, Davis v. Davis. In this case, a divorcing couple fought over several frozen embryos. The woman wanted them implanted, but the man did not want to have children from this broken marriage. Although the case is still under appeal, Dr. Robertson suggested a way of dealing with this and similar cases. The prime consideration should be who would be hurt most by a decision against one or the other. For instance, if the woman...
