### Davidson Student Arrested in Drug Bust
By ED PATTE

During the waning days of the 1987 spring term, officials from the Mecklenburg County Police Department and the State Bureau
of Investigations arrested and charged Davidson College freshman John Brinkman with two counts of possession of illegal substances and one
count of sale and delivery of marijuana to an undercover officer.

Earlier during the spring term, an undercover State Bureau of Investigations Officer, posing as the hometown boyfriend of a Davidson
student, approached and purchased marijuana from Brinkman.

With this evidence in hand, S.B.I. and Mecklenburg County officers obtained a search warrant that later led to Brinkman’s charges
of possession. Brinkman’s problems with the use of controlled substances during the fall and winter terms of 1986-1987 were originally
brought to the attention of his hall counselors Bob Boyd and Jim Earle. Brinkman was advised to attend counseling sessions
provided by Davidson College but did not comply.

When Brinkman’s soliciting of illegal substances was discovered during spring term, the matter was brought directly to Dean of Students
Will Terry. In compliance with his drug policy, Dean Terry alerted the Mecklenburg County Police Department. The arrest of Brinkman
for selling marijuana demonstrates the distinction Terry makes in dealing with drug pushers as opposed to drug users.

“In a conversation with the Mecklenburg County District Attorney, I have his assurance that he will press felony charges against
any individual found selling drugs on this campus. I have also contacted the Mecklenburg County Police and asked them to
cooperate with any agency to seek out any person selling drugs on this campus. I will not hesitate to report
any suspected pushers on campus or in the town.”

Terry’s drug policy follows a different track when confronted with drug users. “We will still seek to deal with the
user therapeutically rather than punitively, if the user will take the matter seriously. The measures we are taking have the
explicit endorsement of the Board of Trustees and the President.”

After spending a night in jail, Brinkman was released on bond. Although originally charged with three felony counts for his
sale and possession of illegal substances, Brinkman agreed to serve time at a rehabilitation clinic in Wisconsin and two of
the charges were dropped. Brinkman is now serving probation for the sale and delivery of marijuana to an undercover officer,
but if at any time during his probationary period he violates his parole, he will have to serve out his
two-year sentence. Brinkman currently resides in Milwaukee and is applying for entrance to the University of Wisconsin. According to the
Dean of Students’ Office, he is under indefinite suspension and for one year is completely ineligible for readmission to Davidson.

### Aquino Orders Cabinet Resignation; Spotlight on Bork
By KATHERINE PRICE

Headlining events Sept. 10-17:

Around the world — Philippine President Aquino dismissed Finance Secretary Ongpin on Friday. Aquino also accepted the resignation of Vice-President
Laurel as Foreign Affairs Secretary. The departures of these two men follow earlier dismissals by Aquino of her 26-member cabinet
in the wake of an unsuccessful coup attempt led by Col. Gregorio Honasan.

Amid tensions in the Persian Gulf, United Nations Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar traveled first to Iran and then to
Iraq in efforts to persuade the nations’ leaders to participate in a cease-fire. Iran and Iraq have been at war
for 7 years. Secretary-General de Cuellar’s visit produced few, if any, immediate results. Recent tanker wars in the Persian Gulf
threaten to escalate into worldwide conflict if the fighting continues. The U.S. began escorting Kuwaiti ships in July to protect
Persian Gulf shipping interests. The reflagging of Kuwaiti ships under the American flag has been interpreted as U.S. support for
Iraq in its war against Iran. Other nations, such as Britain and France, have also become involved in the Persian
Gulf by helping to detect mines allegedly planted by Iran.

At a meeting in Montreal this week, twenty-four nations signed an international accord in an effort to protect the earth’s
ozone layer. The Montreal meeting focused on the dangerous effects fluorocarbons have upon the earth’s atmosphere.

Across the nation — U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Edouard Shevardnadze met in Washington this
week, generating hopes that the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. may be moving closer to a ban on medium-range nuclear weapons
in Europe. While U.S. officials continue to state that a summit meeting between U.S. President Reagan and Soviet Leader Gorbachev
has not been set, reporters seem optimistic that a superpower summit will occur. Soviet news sources reported that a timetable
for Soviet withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan also was discussed.

Senate Republicans ended their 4-month filibuster of major arms control legislation on Friday, as the Democrat-controlled Senate seemed assured of
victory. Senate members anxiously await the results of negotiations between U.S. Secretary of State Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze
on arms control matters.

Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork becomes the focus of congressional attention this week as his nomination goes before the Senate
Judiciary Committee. Bork, who was nominated by President Reagan, is well-known for his controversial views of court decisions involving abortion,
women’s rights, and civil rights. Bork’s critics cite his opposition to the court’s decision in Roe v. Wade (which legalized
abortion) as an example of how his constitutional interpretations will affect U.S. law. Bork’s nomination could be a victory for
Reagan as his presidential term nears its end. Leading the opposition to Bork’s nomination is Democratic presidential candidate Joseph Biden
of Delaware. As Judicial Committee chairman, Biden will be enjoying national visibility, which will put pressure upon him to perform
well in the hearings. Biden has recently been accused of...plagiarizing in his political speeches, and he tried to dismiss such
claims in a news conference on Thursday. Another Reagan nominee, William Sessions of Texas, was unanimously approved by the Senate
Judiciary Committee for the position of FBI Director. Sessions was nominated to replace William Webster, who left the FBI position
to become head of the CIA. An agreement was reached by House leaders to give Nicaraguan rebels $3.5 million in
nonlethal aid. The proposal is expected to be approved by the Senate, but to be vetoed by President Reagan. Pope
John Paul II paid his second visit to the U.S. this week. The pope toured the southern U.S., delivering impassioned
pleas for faith and commitment. The pope remained firm in his opposition to female Catholic priests, divorce, and homosexuality.

Court houses with initial equipment and furnishings.” Nevertheless, most of the items Emanon auctioned are found under the heading of
Fraternity Responsibility, and therefore Stephens and others apparently believed the kitchen equipment was theirs to sell. Stephens consulted both the
Business Office and Comptroller’s office before the auction to determine the ownership of property. According to Gail Hoke, Business Office
Staff Secretary, Stephens approached her about the auction and she provided him with the written guidelines which she stated were
very clear about the ownership of house property. Stephens concluded from these guidelines that Emanon owned the kitchen supplies. Stephens
said that before the auction he tried to contact Doenges several times to inquire if Kappa Sigma would like to
purchase any of the kitchen equipment but he was unsuccessful. The money raised by Emanon’s auction paid for a weekend
beach trip to Kiawah Island for the house and a “very sizable” donation to Hollis Moore, the house’s cook. The
remaining funds are being contributed to the Christian Children’s Fund.

The most obvious consequence of Emanon’s actions was to force a delay in the opening of Kappa Sigma’s kitchen until
the fraternity was able to restock the auctioned equipment. The second consequence, which is more serious, is that the school
will have to replace the kitchen equipment, a cost Doenges estimated at $10,000.00. The fact that Kappa Sig had to
delay its meals was simply a minor inconvenience, according to Doenges. Emanon was the third house in recent years to
fail and change hands and the first one to have this type of problem. Dean Terry is confident that this
will not happen again as the guidelines for Patterson Court houses are being revised and made more clear, and because
he will “padlock any house from now on that closes.”

Fee Continued from page 1

recalls that there were “approximately 200 cars on campus throughout last year that were not properly registered.” Furthermore, campus security
had a problem last year with unregistered, run-down automobiles. In one case, a car with no engine was simply left
on campus after the end of the school year. This car had to be towed away and the cost was
absorbed by the school since the owner’s identity was unknown. A second reason behind the new fee was the issue
of fairness to the Davidson students who do not keep a car on campus. As Sutton points out, “the cost
of parking should be placed on the shoulders of those students who keep cars on campus, not simply every student.”
Finally, both Hughes and Sutton state that Davidson College was one of the few colleges in the country, if not
the only one, that did not charge a parking registration fee. Although many students think that the $30 fee is
too high, Sutton and Hughes maintain that the figure is the lower average from a survey they conducted of parking
fees at private schools around the country. Students, as may be expected, are upset about the initiation of the registration
fee. As one junior pointed out, it was another rising cost of Davidson College similar to the significant increases in
tuition for the past two years. Many students, however, see no problem with having to pay for parking as long
as the funds generated are used to improve the parking situation. Even so, they were angered that there has yet
to be an explanation of how this new revenue is to be spent. Junior David Ray states, “I think it
is a large sum especially since there was no reason given for the increase, and I don’t know where it
is going.” Some members of the SGA Senate also seemed distressed concerning the revenue appropriations. One SGA member stated that
last spring, when the Senate reluctantly passed the resolution for a flat parking fee, they were told the money would
be appropriated to the development of parking on campus. Yet the money was placed in the general funds, a budget
area which, the SGA member states, “is not earmarked for any specific item.” When questioned about this situation, Hughes noted
that in years past all revenue generated from parking and security has been placed into general funds. Sutton also confirmed
that the money is going into the general funds, but said that it would be appropriated to parking development when
it begins. Unfortunately, due to the complexity of the building plans for the new dormitories and the sports complex, specific
action to improve parking at Davidson is uncertain at this time. Sutton emphasized that he is sympathetic to the students’
needs and complaints and indicated that he will meet this week with the Director of Facilities Planning, Grover Meetze, to
discuss plans for using the registration fee revenue for much-needed parking improvements. For frustrated students, however, the new parking fee
appears to mark a seemingly unending and escalating trend towards a more expensive Davidson education.
