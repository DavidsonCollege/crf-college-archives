MONDAY, APRIL 29, 1991 CAMPUS LIVING THE DAVIDPHONIAN

Who is M.C.W.ASP?

Do you know? Do you know?

"WE DON’T HAVE A FIRE"
- my apologies to Billy Joel

No yearbook ‘90, condom controversy
Fiji house, headball fling,
Passed out on KA porch, bike theft,
There’s no freshman housing left
Korner pub and KKK -
What’s it all about?

Freshmen mixers
“Lame, kitsch”
Say the frosh in Belk and Rich
Fortune features ol’ D.C.
We still have no directory
US News rates us 10
“The Panic” finds a niche.

M.C.

Marlo Coke
To Chill, I need in this closed place
A Davidson VA
Bad head sober

We don’t have a fire
If they see smoke they’re dreamin’
It’s the shower steamin’
We ain’t got no fire

My drunk roommate’s gone
That’s why the alarm is on
Texaco tows everyone
The Baker Underground is done
Windows after meals clean, Gender Studies, Streetcar
Soccer’s nat’l fame
Blues Traveler
“But Anyway”

Football wins some games
Internat’l Fair, Gantt’s P.C.
Sonia Sanchez, Smithereens
Meg and Doug are Watson-bound
Quips & Cranks is saved
Field hockey, Deep South
D.A. Thompson opens mouth
“No school spirit jokes here, boy -”
Calls come in a wave

Peace vigils, Gulf War
Another editorial
Candlelight, T.V.
Fat Bob’s over there
Person D’s exploded car
More editorials on the war
McKillop doesn’t start the seniors
Jamie shaves his hair

Feminism, missing laundry
Publish/perish controversy
Abbott and McMillan honored
Connells, Residue
Margaret Atwood
Building boom
D & E apartment room
K is renovated
National Review

Pink lion, egg fights
Black Crowes, late nights
KA didn’t matter anyway
Spring frolics, rainy days
“No hats” is a bogus rule
IKA’s late initiating, Terry is uncool

Apartment cable work’s near done
“Losing My Religion”’s on
Lake campus, graduation
Autonomy emancipation or 3-month vacation...

We don’t have a fire
“It sucks it’s at night,
But let’s get out.
Alright.”

We don’t have a fire
Looks like a coed dorm;
I know that’s not the norm
We don’t have a fire
But false alarms go on,
And on, and on...
