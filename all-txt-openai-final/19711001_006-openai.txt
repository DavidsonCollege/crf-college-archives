Draft Makes New Inroads On Campus

By ROBERT TOUCHTON
Asst. Managing Editor

The Selective Service System has announced that no student entering college this past summer or this fall will be eligible
for a student deferment from the draft. Those who had been enrolled full-time during the 1971-72 school year can retain
their deferment until they graduate, reach age 24, or fail to make satisfactory progress in their academic work.

President Richard M. Nixon asked that student deferments be eliminated when Congress passed legislation extending the draft past June 30.
Final action on the bill is pending.

According to Curtis Tarr, Director of Selective Service, “Few incoming freshmen students are likely to be inducted in the near
future because of the student deferment phase-out.” Curtis explained that of the approximately 1,034,000 incoming freshmen males, about 80% are
18 years old and only 20% are 19 or older. The 18-year-olds will not be subject to induction until 1973,
when draft calls are expected to be low. At least one half of the 19-year-old freshmen should have lottery numbers
high enough to preclude their induction. About 50% of those remaining will be ineligible due to mental, moral, or physical
deferments. Consequently, a maximum of 50,000 men will be directly affected by the student deferment phase-out during this year. Of
these, about 25,000 will not be inducted because of enrollment in Regular, Reserve, or National Guard units, participation in ROTC
programs, or procedural delays.

Tarr promised that college students will not be drafted in the middle of a semester or term. “If called while
enrolled, they will be allowed to postpone their induction until the end of the semester or term. If in their
last academic year, they will be able to postpone their induction until after graduation.”

Incoming freshmen are advised not to file applications for student deferments. “If the pending Selective Service legislation does not pass,”
Tarr said, “it would now be in a registrant's best interest to obtain a student deferment which would extend his
liability until age 35. Should Congress change the legislation to provide for deferments for new incoming freshmen, which is most
unlikely, applications for deferments will not be jeopardized by delaying their submission until after passage of the new law.”

Student 2-S Deferments Now Subject To Drop-Add

By TOM BRUCE
Staff Writer

Students who utilize the new drop-add options approved last year by the faculty may unwittingly nullify their student deferments under
present Selective Service laws. Officials in the Registrar's office stated recently that the 2-S classification is applicable only to those
students who are pursuing full-time courses of study at Davidson. Draft regulations require that the College notify local boards whenever
a registrant is taking a less than normal load in any given term. Hence, students who elect to drop a
course without adding another should be aware of the jeopardy which their status may be in.

The registrar's office stated further that an up-to-date listing of each student's schedule is compiled shortly after the start of
each term. The lists are checked and students who have reduced their loads to two courses or less are labeled
as part-time students. This is a measure that must be complied with under existing law. Part-time students are not eligible
for the 2-S classification. Officials from the Charlotte Draft Office confirmed that when they receive notification that a 2-S registrant
has dropped a course, they begin reclassification procedures at once.

If Congress were not to reinstate the President’s induction authority, he could authorize the induction of those registrants who hold
or have held deferments. In such an unlikely event, draft officials believe that manpower requirements could be met by inducting
those young men who have recently dropped deferments. Recent college graduates or dropouts would make up the bulk of the
inductions.

Davidson ROTC officials sent Wednesday a letter to those sophomores who were not enrolled in ROTC last year to suggest
a program through which two years of military science can be squeezed into one, thereby assuring those students of officer
classification upon graduation and deferment from the draft.

Although new freshmen are most affected by the new deferment procedure, more sophomores than freshmen have an immediate concern for
being drafted because of last summer’s lottery. Most freshmen will be in next year's drawing, therefore not being eligible until
1973.

Career Service: Education On And Off Campus

By GRAY WILSON
Managing Editor

After a wait that took more time than it did to institute the Honors College, Davidson has finally begun development
of a career service program. Career service is a cooperative education program which provides students a chance to spend a
term working at a job that is...either career or service related. Envisioned by the Blue Sky Committee four years ago
as an integral part of the curriculum, the program has been placed under the direction of Assistant Professor of Economics
Randall Kincaid Jr. “My job initially will be to solicit ideas from students, faculty, and administrators,” stated Kincaid, “and then
to draw up a proposal which incorporates those ideas. There are many students on campus who have held internships and
who have had other experiences which give them good insights into the way the program should be developed. I hope
they will share those ideas with me.”

Career/service, often government-supported, was designed to give the student a continuing education on and off the campus for several advantageous
reasons. First, the program acquaints the student with the practical aspects of their field. Second, it gives students a chance
to finance their education without dropping out of school. Finally, the program lends to the maturing and the perspective of
the student.

Vice-president for Academic Affairs John M. Bevan commented on the place of career/service at Davidson: “It will provide an opportunity
for young men to be out of school for a term not only to serve but to test a career
choice. There will be no academic credit given, but the student will have a leave of absence to work for
a social agency, a hospital, a governmental agency, or even within the college itself.” Bevan added, “The program is set
up not just to get the student out into the world but to allow him to be in and out
at the same time. This is no shuttle system. Career/service is for those who want and can work with it.”

Bevan was particularly interested in the correlation of career/service with the extended studies program. He speculated that with an extended
studies project and an independent program a student might possibly receive a full term of credit while working at a
career/service job away from campus that same term. Bevan said that the two programs would work out especially well together
if the academic project endorsed by a professor for extended studies was closely related to the career/service job the student
is involved with. In this manner, a student is paid for work which complements another academic project that he has
undertaken. “It is inevitable,” Bevan said, “that these two programs be intertwined. What is important is that the academic credit
be defined and approved by a professor.”

Bevan has seen career/service work. He mentioned the success of an intern who worked with him in higher education out
in California a few years ago. He remarked that this winter term nine students will leave Davidson to participate in
a marine biology research program in Wood's Hole, Massachusetts. Each will have an extended studies project to complement their work.
Bevan has also received requests for students interested in work which fits in well with career/service. Recently he corresponded with
a camp for emotionally disturbed children in Florida which would like to hire college students for counseling. He said this
might provide an excellent career/service project for psychology majors.

Career/service, one of many academic interludes being developed around the country, is fairly new in liberal arts colleges, although it
has existed for over fifty years in engineering schools. However, several well-known liberal arts colleges—Antioch and Kalamazoo, for example—have such
a program. The Blue Sky Committee suggested that the program be one involving “work, service, or research at an off-campus
location.” The report continues: “Living and working thoughtfully in a real world of action broadens the traditional pattern of educational
experience and contributes to the development of self-discipline, self-confidence, independence, personal understanding, social sympathy, and maturity. The program is a
recognition that not all worthwhile educational experiences have to take place in a classroom.”
