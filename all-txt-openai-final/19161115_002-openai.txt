"VOCATIONAL TRAINING FOR BULLIES."

At this season of the year the Sophomores are taking great interest in a course not mentioned in the catalogue
but given with the tacit approval of the faculty, that is, field work in petty tyranny. They are authorized to
indulge in one of the most pernicious of human instincts, the abuse of power and the gratuitous interference with the
rights of others. The student daily of the largest university of the world puts the common belief with brutal frankness:
“That there should be a certain amount of animosity between the two lower classes is not alone natural, it is
also desirable. The old adage — that everybody loves a fight holds on the campus as it does elsewhere.”

That “everybody loves a fight” is a genial explanation of the state of Europe and it is undeniably “natural” to
delight in the annoyance of inferiors, but the campus does not seem a suitable place for the deliberate cultivation of
primeval viciousness. Recent regulations have done away with the grosser forms of hazing but have left the moral evil of
it untouched. Saving the freshmen from the torture and danger of the old customs is doubtless desirable, but the net
gain is slight, since the milder forms of tyranny meet with more general toleration and inflict more lasting injury upon
the characters of those who impose them and those who submit to them. To tie a man to a railroad
track, to bury him alive or brand him with silver nitrate are not pastimes in which one is apt to
find delight after his sophomore days, but the habit of imposing one’s will upon others in the matter of dress
and conduct is not so easily outlived. A man who has been allowed to dictate to younger and less educated
men what color neckties and socks they shall wear, what they shall sing and where they shall walk, is apt
to carry into later life the belief in class destruction and intolerance which his college training has given him.—N. Y.

IN THE LIBRARY.

For the benefit of inexperienced debaters, a small collection of books about debating is placed in the Reference Room, to
be used as reference books. These can be studied to advantage even by others than first-year men.
