COMMISSIONER TALKS AT CHAPEL SERVICE

Bruno Friedrich Tells of Salvation Army’s Work in Foreign Countries

INDIA LEADS IN EAST

“Soap, Soup and Salvation” Is Army’s Eastern Motto

Commissioner Bruno Friedrich of the Salvation Army spoke at the chapel service Wednesday morning, February 5. The speaker limited his talk to his work with the Salvation Army in foreign countries. However, he first gave a short history of the Salvation Army. He told of its foundation by General Booth and of the countries where it now works. He then proceeded to tell of his experiences in the work, stretching to villages where the people know no trade other than thievery. Here he explained the motto of the Army, “Soup, Soap and Salvation,” came into good use. After feeding and cleaning these people up, he and his fellow workers taught them useful occupations. This work proved so successful that the government of India turned twenty villages over to them and also allotted them some money with which to carry on their work. The Salvation Army hopes in the future to take over the old military posts and work with a larger group of natives. Friedrich then told of his work in Siam and in the famine-suffering districts of China. He also said about his experiences in the United States during the wild and wooly days. The Commissioner was born in Germany and spent most of his life there.

Frosh Become Better Shots After Practice

As another week of practice passes, freshmen out for the rifle team are becoming better shots and good records are being turned in. Under the tutelage and surveillance of Cathey, Quick, and officers of the R.O.T.C. staff, the group of first-year men are quickly gaining experience. The rifle range is being altered to provide individual targets, thus relieving the boys of the necessity of waiting for each other to finish. C. W. Sample turned in a 98 score this last week for a new high. Ten shots at one target make up the one hundred percent total. Targets are shot at in four positions: prone, kneeling, sitting, and standing.

PROMOTION OF R.O.T.C. CADETS IS ANNOUNCED

New Appointments of R.O.T.C. Officers For Second Semester Is Published

The Military Department has announced the new appointments of the R.O.T.C. Cadet Officers for the second semester. The official promotion of these men has been delayed by inclement weather, but it may be made at the parade held by the local detachment. The appointments include Cadet Major W. C. Cathey, Cadet Captain in charge of plans and training; Cadet Second Lieutenant W. H. Pierce and J. R. Pearce to Cadet First Lieutenants. Cadet D. B. Griffin was transferred from Company B to Company A; Cadet First Lieutenant G. A. Leukel, from Company C to staff as assistant to the personnel adjutant.

Suddenly he exclaimed, “I have left my gold pen in the hotel room!” Let not the reader be misled into thinking that this untutored exclamation was the result of a sudden inspiration. He promptly jerked out his watch and said, “Sure, I got fifteen minutes to make it.” And he turned and started to run away.

HEAD OF EDUCATION DEPARTMENT TALKS
(Continued from Page 1)

A sincerely righteous person is tremendously powerful in the close intimacy of the family group. Studies in childhood are constantly magnifying the importance of early home life in the production of social attitudes. If the young child is to know about God, if he is to learn a distinction and emotional reactions between right and wrong, the home must become the first school of religion and morals. The program of religious education in most of our Protestant churches is so poorly organized and executed that the school of the church, at its best, can do little more than supplement the work of the Christian home in building character.

A few suggestions as a beginning of a new approach follow: first, let the church seek leadership which is not only consecrated but intelligent; second, extend the program of religious and moral instruction beyond the brief Sunday period; third, revamp the curriculum and procedure of the church schools, so as to interpret the message of Jesus in terms of present-day issues; fourth, allow the young people more active participation in the work of the church and the control of its affairs; fifth, study and apply the teaching techniques of Jesus, who was the Master Teacher.

The church school also needs to secure the cooperation of the day school in the giving of moral training based on Christian principles. At the top of the church's educational ladder stand the Christian secondary school and college. These institutions, upon which the church must ultimately depend for trained leadership to direct its affairs, have been shamefully treated. The church should hasten to strengthen its colleges, make them financially independent, secure for their faculties the finest talent available, make the tenure of teachers secure and satisfactory, and encourage them to bring the whole realm of knowledge under tribute to the gospel of Jesus Christ. For out of these colleges must come the men and women who will be the builders of Christian character in the future.
