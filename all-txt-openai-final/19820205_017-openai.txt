**Cats Dunk Cadets**

McConnell was the first to rise to his feet after classmate Jamie Hall put the ball through the net. That feat in itself is by no means miraculous or even noteworthy, except that both seniors were playing their last regular season home game, and that Co-captain Tommy Mac was finishing his home season hardly mentioned, let alone glorified.

But McConnell was the first one to his feet from his chair. Rather uncharacteristically for a senior co-captain, that is where Tommy has spent most of his time this season—watching from a chair. But he’s had no problem adjusting to that role, and that’s one of the keys to this team’s success.

“What I’ve tried to do every single game is to prepare physically as if I was a starter and to prepare mentally as a coach. This way I’m always ready whenever I’m called on. Whatever is needed of me—whether it’s to play 38 minutes or one or no minutes—it’s whatever Tommy Mac has to give.”

This time around, Coach Hussey called on Tommy to play 14 minutes, and Sparky made every one of those minutes count. Standing just inside the half-court line, Tommy put up an alley-oop pass to Jamie Hall. Jamie, back to the basket, grabbed the pass and jammed the ball into the hoop for a small but commanding 2-0 lead. That was the first of a team-high 5 assists for McConnell.

On the other end of the assist was Hall, who likewise has been on the other end of the leadership. Where Tommy has led the bench, Jamie has led the floor.

“I’ve taken a lot of leadership, especially on the road. I try to keep them loose. I just try to give as much leadership as I can. I’m not one who tries to vocalize the leadership, I just try to display it.”

There was plenty of leadership in that behind-the-head dunk. So much, in fact, that the game quickly turned into a Davidson dunk exhibition, as the Cats attempted probably more slam dunks in a game than in any game in the last decade and perhaps in school history. All this came despite the fact that Davidson didn’t take a 6-point lead until after 14:30 of play. Such a contest can be disastrous, as Coach Bobby Hussey explained. “When you come out, score a couple of easies, or score on a spectacular play, it’s probably the worst thing that could happen to a team.” He quickly added, “It’s a human tendency—I understand it.”

But as the co-captains were connecting on alley-oops to wow the crowd, Skip Brown hasn't seen a whole lot of action, but he’s made his fair share of commotion. Says Coach Hussey, “Skip’s a great team man. Skip’s Skip every day. He probably has the greatest morale of everybody on the team. He contributes in intangible ways.”

After Skip stepped on the court Monday night, junior Cliff Tribus said, “Everything’s gonna work out if we can get Skip to score.” Skip scored.

The team showed other signs of improvement against the Keydets. Brian Rowan has established himself as an inside force to be reckoned with, and he showed it Monday. He hammered in two dunks, including a two-handed stuff off the inbounds pass for four of his 13 points. He hauled in 5 caroms, dished out 4 assists, and was three times a thief as well.

Jamie Hall played his best inside game in recent memory. His last four points came on a pair of dunks, and he was fouled on neither. The Cats were victorious, 79-63.
