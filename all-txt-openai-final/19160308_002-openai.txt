HONORS
The very striking statement made by President Wilson the other day, “That the man who seeks the Presidency for what
he can get out of it is an audacious fool,” and this, together with the fact that he is again
seeking the Presidency, carries much in it that is worthy of thought. It seems to us that this goes to
the very heart of the question and shows that an honor should stand for service and if it does not
stand for that, it is not worth having. It should be a question of giving and not of taking.

But to come a little closer home, let us take college honors. They are not exactly parallel to the honors
which come to men after they leave college, for a college honor should train the man and even allow him
to make mistakes—mistakes which are costly many times and which should certainly be avoided as far as possible. Therefore it
should not be an absolute requisite that a man be entirely fitted for a place before he goes into it,
but he should be much better fitted for the world’s work when he leaves the place.

There is a tendency in college life to give too much to a few men and not distribute the work
of the student activities, and such is the peculiar make-up of college men, there is a tendency to take too
much work when it is given to them. This circle causes much harm to both the student activities and to
the men. One of the best methods to avoid this evil is found in the practice of many colleges to
have a regular plan by which the honors that may go to a man are limited and during any one
year he cannot hold more than a certain number of offices. For many reasons this plan should be adopted at
Davidson. A committee has been appointed to investigate and report to the students about a plan of this kind and
no time should be lost in putting some definite working plan into effect. It is infinitely more fair, both to
the student body and to the individual. It will help men to guard their health. It will many times provide
the different student activities with better men. It will give training to more men. And last and best, it will
enable a man to better serve that with which he is connected. Let us have the report of the committee
and put some plan into effect as soon as practicable.

DR. WALTER LINGLE CONDUCTS SUNDAY SERVICES
Dr. Walter L. Lingle, of Union Theological Seminary, Richmond, Va., spoke three times here Sunday. In the absence of Dr.
Richards, he preached to the congregation Sunday morning. His sermon was very interesting, on the subject of witness bearing. Dr.
Lingle chose as his text: “And ye shall be witnesses unto me.” In a powerful sermon he showed very clearly
how our witness bearing depended upon three separate things—“What we know,” “What we say,” and “What we are.” Dr. Lingle
spoke very interestingly and instructively to the Ministerial Band and again at the evening service. The service for the evening
was the annual meeting of the local organization of the American Bible Society.ciety. "The minutes of the last meeting were
read and the same officers were re-elected. After this part of the service, Dr. Lingle delivered a masterful address on
'The Origin of the English Bible.' Dr. Lingle is an old Davidson man with the best interests of the college
at heart, and the student body as well as the townspeople were glad to have him with us.

DR. HAMILTON TO LECTURE HERE

Dr. J. G. de Roulhac Hamilton, head of the department of History at the University of North Carolina, left February
29 for a lecture tour of one week under the auspices of the American Association for International Conciliation. He will
visit the international polity clubs of a number of the Southern universities. Dr. Hamilton will speak at Davidson this month.
He also speaks at the University of South Carolina, University of Georgia, Vanderbilt, University of the South, University of Louisiana,
and Tulane University.

CLASS BASKETBALL

Although plans have not as yet been definitely arranged, it is almost certain that the spring season of class basketball
will begin next Wednesday. Since Coach Kluttz has been coaching basketball, considerable interest has been shown of late in this
branch of athletics. Heretofore the classes have been playing the series in the fall, but beginning with this spring, there
will be a spring season also. Each class will play two games, the season closing the last of the month.
