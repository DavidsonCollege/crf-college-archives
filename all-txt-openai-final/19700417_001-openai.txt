LIX NUMBER TWENTY-THREE

Senate Approves Self-Scheduling Policy

By GRAY WILSON
Asst. Managing Editor

The student Senate has adopted a proposal calling for self-scheduled exams in an attempt to bring positive action by the
faculty before final Spring Term exams.

The proposal will go from the Senate to the faculty Educational Policy Committee.

Students have overwhelmingly approved an amendment to the Student constitution making 24-hour open dorms the official policy of the student
government.

With results in from all voters except those in Little dormitory and those living off campus, the tally stands at
614 to 90 in favor.

The amendment does not change the actual legal status of open dorm hours, but states the principle of unlimited hours
as official student government policy.

The amendment instructs the student government “to take such action as may be necessary to bring this policy into immediate
effect.”

But it is unsure what, if anything, the student government will do in response to this instruction.

SGA President Ran Coble said, “Just putting it in the constitution will not make it so.”

RHC President Cecil Burney told RHC floor representatives Monday that he was not certain as to what action he would
take once the amendment passed.

He suggested that the RHC could declare the dorms open and declare that students were no longer obligated to report
violations or take the matter to the faculty again.

Coble declined to say that it barred the student government from enforcing present open dorm hours.

Student government officials Thursday morning announced they have dropped intentions to press objections to the legality of the amendment.

The student takes the consequences for any infractions of the exam mechanism, including mistakes in his schedule or violations of
the examination period itself.

The Senate also discussed progress on the question of 24-hour open dorms. SGA President Ran Coble urged a more moderate
approach to the subject in view of the recent faculty rejection.

Coble said that the present tactic is to find out “how the faculty feels about jeopardizing the other student proposals.”

The predominant idea was the creation of a student-faculty Committee to recommend changes as often as necessary to adapt the
code to a changing situation.

That view expressed by sophomore Whit Ayers summed up the view of the Code of Responsibility held by the students
who attended Tuesday night's hearing--conducted by the Trustee Committee on Social Life.

The‘We will at least recently have equal numbers of students amendment on election tech- colleges in two states,’ President Peter
Hobbie said. Supporters of the Moratorium, but as a Christian who happens to be an American, never have committed treason
against our consciences and our faith. In response to this allegation, Registrar Jay H. Ost stated that such information was
contained in a memorandum which was sent out to all students in the spring of 1968; they plan to re-enter.
All previously enrolled students must be guaranteed re-admission to Davidson if they apply within one month of the beginning of
the term they plan to re-enter.

The intent of the amendment is “mainly political,” according to Franklin Anderson, one of the sponsors of the petition which
brought about the amendment. For its winning efforts, the Old Gold and Black of Wake Forest University received the first
place check for $50. Runners-up to THE DAVIDSONIAN were the University Student of Johnson C. Smith University and the Queens
Current of Queens College.

Hobbie reported that about 30 fasters lasted the whole three-day fasting period. Many of the fasters dropped out after one
day, many more during the long hungry hours of Tuesday. Nonetheless, the red-and-white “Fast for Peace” armbands could be seen
anywhere one went on campus.

Trustees Postpone Code Until Next Fall’s Meeting

By JOHN McLEAN
Managing Editor

McLean: Do you believe that the recent behavior of the courts has eroded students’ confidence in the court system?

Vernon: I don’t think the drug case created so little confidence in the court system, but it made us realize
what we had done when we voted in the Code. I hadn’t looked at what it was forcing me to
do.

Roberts: If you read the Code, of course, you do have business in dealing specifically with these areas (drugs and
sex). They are specifically mentioned. I think the question is whether it should mention these, but it does. It is
one question whether or not you agree with it, but if you're on the Court you're responsible for maintaining it.

Bliss: I think this is a very likely conclusion to the present situation. I think that the recent activities of
the courts show that the system as it is now constituted can work and does work. It could be argued
that because of certain values that would be maintained, it should be perpetuated. I'm not really sure I’m arguing in
favor of the college maintaining its present situation. The advantages I would see to maintaining it if I were to
argue that it ought to be maintained probably center on the separate community which the college has been traditionally and
which it would lose, will lose, if it becomes a part of the larger community. It would lose the values
which characterize the present small, rather isolated community.

EDITOR’S NOTE

During the Winter Term, the college court system passed through an “ordeal by fire” in handling a series of cases
involving the alleged sale of hallucinatory drugs by a Davidson junior. The defendant was tried and convicted by the Regulations
Court at the end of the Fall Term. The Court of Appeals sustained the conviction, and the defendant appealed to
the Board of Trustees. But before the board met, the College offered a retrial in a court of the defendant's
choosing. He selected the Court of Appeals, saying he could not get a fair trial in the Regulations Court.

Again the Court of Appeals found the student guilty, but suspended his sentence. Two days later, the student was charged
with an honor offense. He was convicted by the Honor Court and pressed an appeal to the Court of Appeals.
On the strength of a defense by associate professor of philosophy Alan B. Brinkley, he was acquitted of the Honor
conviction.

At the first of the Spring Term, several court members were asked to participate in a round-robin interview session on
the courts. Professors Jerry A. Roberts (Regulations Court), Frank W. Bliss (Court of Appeals), and students Tom Vernon (Court of
Appeals) and Johnny Baker (Investigating Committee Chairman) agreed to be interviewed by Editor-in-Chief Ed Shoaf and Managing Editor John McLean.

McLean: Are college courts competent to deal with drug cases, in view of the complications with civil law in this
matter?

Roberts: Members of the courts have raised this question among themselves and we have made arrangements to have some outside
legal counsel sit down and discuss with us legal matters pertaining to this question. Members of the court definitely have
some reservations about this. The drug case happened to be a situation in which the court really didn’t have much
cooperation. I really feel that we didn’t do a very good job on that one.

Vernon: There would be, perhaps, a significant loss of trust around here in that you don’t know who’s taking three
courses and who’s just walking around. I generally have my door open, but I wouldn’t have it open for just
anybody in that situation.

Baker: It is beyond the competency of the Investigating Committee, being students and amateurs, to investigate adequately matters involving drugs.

McLean: The talk about “definite procedures” seems to be saying that college courts should become adversary proceedings rather than courts
which serve to force the defendant to admit guilt, as it is now.

Roberts: Traditionally this is the way college courts are supposed to operate. I would be extremely hesitant to change this.

Bliss: I think this is a very likely conclusion to the present situation. I think that the recent activities of
the courts show that the system as it is now constituted can work and does work. It could be argued
that because of certain values that would be maintained, it should be perpetuated. I'm not really sure I’m arguing in
favor of the college maintaining its present situation. The advantages I would see to maintaining it if I were to
argue that it ought to be maintained probably center on the separate community which the college has been traditionally and
which it would lose, will lose, if it becomes a part of the larger community. It would lose the values
which characterize the present small, rather isolated community.
