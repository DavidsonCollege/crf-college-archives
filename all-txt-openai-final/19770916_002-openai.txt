Currie announces revision of accounting system

By PEG TRAVIS
Staff Writer

College Business Manager Robert A. Currie, Jr. has proposed a new system for management of the houses on Patterson Court
in light of the inconsistent bookkeeping procedures which have caused difficulties in the past. This new system should provide an
easier method for the treasurers to maintain bookkeeping efficiency.

Each year Currie and the house treasurers meet to discuss operation and regulation of the court. Last spring the group
decided that the existing system of simply auditing the houses was insufficient. “This should be an ongoing operation,” said Currie.
“What the fraternities and houses need is help throughout the school year rather than just a summary of previous years.”

Recently appointed Fraternity Liaison Auditor Harry L. Albert, Jr. '77 is reviewing last year’s budgets and records as well as
determining which system will be most satisfactory. “One thing that Harry has done in working for us,” Currie stated, “has
been to prepare a uniform accounting system for the six fraternities or clubs that are not nationals. The national fraternities
have their own forms requiring periodic reports. These non-nationals do not have any uniform system. That’s what we’re trying to
do—to set up a system for them so that they can keep proper records.”

In his recommendations for the new accounting system Albert states, “Of course, we hope that the four nationally affiliated eating
houses will comply to the greatest extent possible and still maintain the procedures outlined by their respective national offices.” Currie
emphasizes that with this new system he is not trying to direct the houses but “to pinpoint for them any
trouble spots” that might arise. “We try to advise them about the variables that are involved, such as utility rates,
food rates and the number of members.”

Currie also emphasizes that the treasurers themselves are not to blame for the state of the records. “Continuity is the
difficult thing here. We normally have different treasurers every year. They only go through a brief training period.” Currie commended
the house treasurers saying, “Most people on campus really don’t realize the skill and time it takes to do a
good job as fraternity treasurer.” Each house has a budget that varies from $30,000 to $50,000. The treasurers’ duties include
preparing a budget, setting board and social rates, collecting dues, complying with wage-hour laws, making payments for services, and filing
quarterly and annual tax reports. Albert intends to meet with the treasurers of the six non-national houses individually and present
his recommendations for a uniform system.

purpose and policies of the College as set forth in the Davidson College constitution.” This revision is expected to be
approved in the October Trustees meeting.

Opposes bids

Spencer also sought to head off recent attempts by some students to reinstate written bids to fraternities on the Court.
Spencer complained that any such move would bring Davidson closer to the old social system (85% fraternity membership, 15% independent)
which, he said, branded some as “social illiterates,” channeled loyalties narrowly, insulated people, and prevented students from making broader friendships.
Spencer acknowledged that all the eating houses “have informal ways of letting a person know that he or she is
welcome or unwelcome” and that “this sometimes involves hurt and disappointment,” but he insisted that “the hurt is far less
than that of a student who is formally and publicly rejected.”

“I am strongly convinced that it would be a serious mistake to take even one step backward toward a system
based on formal exclusion.” Spencer contended that the current self-selection system provides a place for fraternities and said that those
fraternities are vigorous and healthy.

Supports Women

Spencer said that he supported the efforts of the women at Rusk House in spite of fears expressed by some
that the House could move toward the practices characteristic of many sorority groups. He believes that the Rusk House alternative
is a means of meeting the needs of women on campus.

Special needs and desires of women on a campus that still "betrays the fact that we are a college for
men which has graciously permitted women to join us." Spencer underscored the College’s genuine desire to recruit and make "at
home" more black students, staff, and faculty members. He promised that "special attention" would be devoted to the recruitment of
blacks.

**Evaluation**

Spencer pledged that the new Academic Vice-President, Price Zimmerman, would work in cooperation with faculty and students to devise procedures
of faculty evaluation for promotion and tenure. Spencer believes that students do not have the professional qualifications or experience to
make some of the judgments that go into evaluation, but admits that students "are in a better position than anyone
else to judge some of the aspects of good teaching," and thinks that they "should have an important part in
evaluating those most directly responsible for their education."

**Budget**

Spencer announced that the College operated without a deficit during its last fiscal year, in keeping with his Administration’s policy
of avoiding the deficits that today plague some small colleges. "There were ups and downs on both sides of the
budget, but the over-runs on the expense side were balanced by additional revenue on the income side." Major expense over-runs
were in Athletics ($110,000), Instruction ($77,000), Utilities and Repairs ($38,000), and Investment Service ($20,000). A larger-than-anticipated freshman class, favorable investment
earnings, and an increase in gifts to operating expenses from alumni all brought unexpected revenue that preserved the balanced budget.

Spencer reminded the audience that he had last year advised "that during the first full year of the athletic program
directed by the Trustees, there would be an over-run in that area. I also said that the athletic budget this
year would be made a realistic one, and that those responsible for the administration of it—and all other areas of
the budget—understand that the budget is a limit which cannot be exceeded except for reasons over which the College has
no control."

**Lovell on DAV**

[Continued from page 1]

Lovell’s initial task will be to raise the necessary funds for the power boost. His immediate goal is $70,000, and
he will contact foundations, civic organizations, and individuals seeking financial commitments. Last spring the college submitted an application for a
grant from HEW to fund the shift to high power, but the college has only been told that the application
is "accepted for consideration."

"The thing that is holding us back is money. Once we get the money, we know what kind of equipment
we want; once we get the equipment we can go on the air, once we go on the air we
can start developing an audience, then we can expand," said Lovell.

In the meantime, Barrett is gearing his staff for the shift to high power by introducing a training program. "I
want ours to be a very professional staff, with each person licensed. We’re also striving for an extensive knowledge of
the music being played, the technical equipment, and last but not least, an awareness of proper radio decorum."

Lovell, too, stresses the need for a professional attitude among student staff, and at the same time points out that
such student involvement can be a big "plus" factor when promoting the station to the public. "I want people to
listen and be able to say, ‘Hey, those are students that are doing such a remarkable job!’"

The high-power WDAV will emphasize educational and classical programming, but Lovell emphasizes that the precise format will be determined after
the station goes on the air. "We have to try our product on the community and then get feedback from
the community," Lovell said. That feedback will be weighed when determining the format, "so that we finally become what we
become because of the influences around us."
