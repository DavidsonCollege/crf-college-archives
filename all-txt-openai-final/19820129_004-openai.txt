Commons and Court Co-operate

The SGA Food Committee has ne-

February, and continues through the
rest of the school year, provides for de-

livery of Sealtest dairy products to Pat-

terson Court houses. “If it succeeds, the
program may expand to other areas of food
purchasing,” Food Service Director Car-
leton Pritchard said.

So far this year the Commons and the
Court have been, at best, indifferent to
each other. The new agreement may
change this situation. Lentz Ivey,
Chairman of the SGA Food Committee,
views the agreement as “an opportunity
for the Court and the Commons to en-
gage in a working relationship to cut
food costs.”

Ivey estimates that the new
agreement will allow the Patterson
Court Houses to reduce their dairy bills
by 10-25%. Currently, the houses buy
milk every week at a cost of $2.65 per
gallon. The new Sealtest contract,
which takes advantage of bulk buying,
lowers the cost to $1.86 per gallon.
Although the houses are not required
to join the new agreement, Ivey feels
that “it would be beneficial if all court
members participated, to have everyone
at least give it a try.” Most of the houses
have indicated that they will try the new
program.

ATO President Ralph Lasley likes the
agreement because “it will save us a lot
of money and, if it expands to other
foods, it will be even better.” KA Presi-
dent Eric Crum favors the agreement
but admits that “it’s not going to do
much for us, since we don’t drink much
milk.”

The SGA food committee discussed
plans for a food cooperative earlier this
year. On 16 December 1981, the com-
mittee met with the presidents, treasur-
ers, and cooks from Patterson Court;
Business Manager Bob Currie, and Prit-
chard. The group agreed to pursue the
food co-op but recognized difficulties in
billing and milk delivery.

The group met again on 18 January.
They decided that Pritchard’s staff
would handle the billing, that this arran-
gement would be the trial run for the
system, and that Sealtest would deliver
the products to each house. Pritchard al-
so distributed contracts and asked for a
letter of intent by 1 February.

Even though the new arrangement
will not benefit the Commons, Pritchard
favors it because he wants to cooperate
with the houses. “I think we ought to
work together,” said Pritchard. “I don’t
feel we should compete with them [the
houses], and we are making every effort
not to compete.” He has offered to con-
duct a workshop that will show Patter-
son Court members how to make long-
range cost-effective food accounting.

On February 10, in the minds of many upperclassmen concerns
the impact that the Commons will have
on membership in the Patterson Court
eating houses. A Davidsonian survey
showed that 25% of students said they planned to
remain in the Commons next year.

This is approximately a 15% sample. It
was not a strictly scientific poll, but the
results are likely to be significant.

The survey showed that 28% of the
freshman men intended to stay at the
Commons and 21% of the freshman
women planned to stay. Twelve percent
weren’t sure.

When students were asked to ex-
press an opinion on the possible estab-
lishment of a new all-women’s eating
house, there was a notable difference in
responses. While 78% of male students expressed
their approval, only 37% of women
agreed. Also, 32% of the women ex-
pressed an interest in eating in a new all-
women's eating house.

Several freshmen said they were
still not quite sure they understand self-
selection and are apprehensive about the
coming decision.

Self-selection was instituted follow-
ing Davidson's conversion to co-educa-
tion in 1971. At that time, the fraternity
bid system was eliminated, Sig Ep and
Fiji moved off campus, ATO lost its na-
tional charter and admitted women, and
Kappa Sigma became Fannie & Ma-
ble’s.

The poll was conducted by inter-
viewing 51 freshmen, 32 men and 19
women, at mealtimes in the Commons.
