Excellent Showing Made By McFadyen and Parker

Coach “Doc” Unger’s Wildcat matmen began defense of their State Championship in January by downing Duke's grapplers 16-12, in an exciting match at Durham last Saturday afternoon. At the end of the first five matches, the Cats were trailing the Dukes by a 5-12 count, but from that point on, the Cats had it all their way. Coach Unger was particularly pleased with the showing of McFadyen (165) who pinned Haines of Duke after 8:37, and Parker (135) who pinned Brown of Duke after 7:03. “Parker is a much improved wrestler,” stated Coach Unger, “and he will be one of our main point-getters throughout the rest of the season.” Blue, Davidson, and Walker lost his match by a 6:37 time advantage from Stevenson. “All the boys were a bit nervous in their first collegiate meet, and Blue lost due only to lack of confidence,” Coach Unger said. Bixler, of Davidson, lost to Friedlander of Duke by a time advantage.

This season finds Davidson with a basketball team representing one extreme and a wrestling club indicating the other. Some rallying point must be reached for the first. With Davidson making her bid for Southern Conference membership this month, the members of that board can’t help but be unfavorably impressed with the team, which hasn't won but one game and that over the Statesville “All-Stars.”

Coach Newton must fill nine vacancies left by this year’s graduates. They are: Albert Cumbie, Wood Burns, Wade Barrow, John Armstrong, Bill Johnston, Kiesewetter, Bill Hancock, Dick Fields, and Lawrence Reid. All of these men saw a great deal of service and will be missed to no small extent when the footballs start flying next fall. Some say that Johnny Allen, although he lost his match, seemed greatly improved and had some hope that Irvin Hogan, who was on the freshman team last year, would return to school this semester and would therefore be eligible next fall.

WILDCATS DOWNED BY NORTH STATE TEAMS

Quick and Armstrong Star As Cagers Drop Games to Elon And Catawba

Following a mid-term lay-off, Davidson's fighting Wildcat basketballers bowed to the Catawba Indians, 25-27, and to the Elon Christians, 30-43. Quick and Armstrong led the Wildcats with their scoring. Bauer, Indian forward, rang up the only and deciding point of the extra period to win by a score of 27 to 25. The game was featured by the nip and tuck struggle throughout. In the first half, Catawba matched goal for goal with the Wildcats, but Davidson led 11-10 at the half-time. Catawba led 25-22 with two minutes left, but Quick made good a foul shot and Barrow rang up a field goal to tie the score. In the extra period, Bauer scored the only point to win the game for Catawba.

Davidson and Catawba played to a deadlock in the regular time limit of their game at Salisbury last Wednesday night, but in the necessary extra point the Indians were able to chalk up the only tally to win by a score of 27 to 25. The game was featured by the nip and tuck struggle throughout. In the first half, Catawba matched goal for goal with the Wildcats, but Davidson led 11-10 at the half-time. Catawba led 25-22 with two minutes left, but Quick made good a foul shot and Barrow rang up a field goal to tie the score. In the extra period, Bauer scored the only point to win the game for Catawba.

The Wildcats romped off to an early lead of 9-5 in the opening minutes of play, but by the intermission the visitors had run up a ten-point lead, 23-13. Roye, Elon guard, led his team’s scoring with fourteen points, while Captain Bill Quick accounted for eight of the home team's points. John Armstrong shone on the defense for the losers. Seventeen personal fouls were called on each team, but Elon converted thirteen to Davidson’s ten.

The Wild Kittens have been sharpening their claws this past week and are expected to swing into action this week with a new ferocity. The Frosh meet Wingate here Tuesday night to start the week, and Friday they leave with the varsity to invade the courts of Wake Forest that night and State on Saturday night. The cagers of Belmont Abbey come here on Tuesday the eleventh for a return game against the Freshmen.

Coach Unger expressed the opinion that Duke had been underrated this season, and that, according to Coach Tillson of V. P. I., the Dukes were not in good condition at the time they lost to Washington and Lee. Next Friday, the Cat matmen will meet Washington and Lee.

Fraternity Basketball Gets Underway As Kappa Sigs Are Defeated

With a blast of the whistle by Referee “Mokey” Faison last Monday evening, the inter-fraternity basketball tournament got under way. In this game the Phi Gams eliminated the Kappa Sigs from the running by a score of 28-24. The game was all Phi Gam, leading 12-7. The last quarter, however, was a different story. The Kappa Sig team fought back, but the Phi Gams held the lead and then held it to win.Knot the count at the 1 so looked good for the Wildcats, Pacer ie ee ars naa | otitte title are still good,” quoted it needs is more help from you— ACI pla with the ‘At os : Be ee they have held three scrimmage GhachnUneerna in GN Oner: 5 let’s pledge ourselves to help SHRITEE ERE Peer PUT Cee santo nies ee noes HONE Eh Hap practices and the, Freshman ma-]) Teena eae State will them realize that it’s their duty AOA tep up into a | hen the score was knotted at 2 set i | Fy chine is definitely clicking more] ‘ peace: to train before a game, to fight pai Weelerre ra WY Gr PLATE ACR PSOE Pee te sane erent IL riod, the I hi Boxers Train ‘Conclave Will smoothly, Jack Lee and Perry to the last during that game, fennnad out at ecollemanaid dts not | ances ld to win by a score-et | Sloan, both of whom were unable and to keep that, ‘Wildcat nodehnitely avhetherormnotne 28-24 | | Medicated r whether or e I |to enter the fray against State Spirit” going.
