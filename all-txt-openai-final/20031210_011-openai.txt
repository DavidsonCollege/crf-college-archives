#### Women start conference season on winning note

**Win over Wofford, close loss to Ga. Tech give team cause for optimism**

It had been a long time since the women’s basketball team played in the friendly confines of Belk Arena, with
its last home contest coming on Feb. 22 against East Tennessee State.

Since that game, the ‘Cats had played 11 straight on the road, including six to open the new 2003-04 season.
The Wildcats closed out that streak this past week against ACC foe Georgia Tech, and then finally returned home for
their SoCon opener against the Wofford Terriers.

Coach Annette Watts knew that the opening part of the 2004 schedule would be a stiff test for the ‘Cats,
saying before the season, “We open the season with an NCAA tournament team in Michigan State, and five of our
seven opponents have a great chance of advancing to the tournament this year. No matter what happens, I know that
we’ll be able to bounce back for conference play. We may not see the benefits of the schedule until the
second round of the conference tournament, but it will pay off down the stretch.”

The Wildcats did struggle somewhat during that stretch, starting the season with a 2-3 record coming into last week’s match-up
with the Yellow Jackets, but were close in every contest.

Against Georgia Tech, Davidson showed it was already battle-tested for success, as the ‘Cats jumped out to an early 20-12
advantage in the first half. Davidson had several opportunities to push that lead into double-digits, but instead traded baskets with
the Jackets before Tech ran off a 5-0 run at the end of the half to cut the deficit to
three at 27-24.

In the second half, Davidson again clung to a small advantage throughout, including a 46-42 advantage with 7:08 to play
in the game. In the next four minutes, however, that lead quickly disappeared, as Davidson committed four turnovers and four
personal fouls to fuel a 9-1 Tech run and a deficit that the Wildcats could not overcome.

Despite the loss, the game highlighted the Davidson strength of team defense that Coach Watts has harped about in the
preseason. The ‘Cats held Tech to 29% field goal shooting in limiting them to only 38 points from the field,
but that aggressive nature also sent the Jackets to the charity stripe 36 times during the game.

As senior Meghan Bryant noted after the game, “Our defense is incredible, but we need to learn to focus on
our fouls [because] we can’t win if we foul them all the time.”

The Wildcats were unable to convert that defensive intensity into a win, as the offense was slowed by a season-high
22 turnovers, but the defeat still showed “a lot about this team that people don’t know about,” according to Bryant.

On Saturday, the Wildcats finally returned to the home crowd, beating the visiting Terriers (0-6, 0-2) 79-61. Whereas the Tech
loss displayed the defensive strength of the ‘Cats, this match-up really showed the depth on the 2004 squad. With nine
players averaging more than 15 minutes a game thus far, and seven players having already received at least three starting
nods this season, the Wildcats have a depth that has rarely been seen at Davidson.

In the first half of play against Wofford, with the score knotted at 29 and 4:48 remaining, the Wildcats finally
managed to pull away from the Terriers in mounting a 13-0 run to close the half. “[Wofford] hit some big
shots in the first half, and we were having a hard time pulling away,” noted Bryant, “and that run was
the spark that really helped us get going.”

That run also epitomized the depth of the ‘Cats, as five different players scored in that stretch. For the game,
the bench contributed 40 of the 79 points, with Bryant and Robyn Flewelling ‘04 chipping in 16 and 17 respectively.

Following that decisive 13-0 run to close the half, the Terriers never mounted much more of a challenge. The closest
the Terriers would get was 49-38 with 14:08 to play, but the ‘Cats quickly responded with a 10-1 run to
put the game completely out of reach.

Davidson next has the week off for finals, and will play host to Winthrop on Dec. 18 in its final
non-conference game of the season.
