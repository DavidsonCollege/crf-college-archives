~~ THE DAVIDSONIAN, MAY 5, 1922. ATHLETIC NEWS ~~

The cat clan made at least one hit and Freeman and McMillian each came through with twin smashes. But Davis
kept them fairly well scattered and by his perfect control and support managed to pull out niches in the Wildcat
Hall of Fame.

No. 5. Allen Ralph Flowers, Jr., Ex-’20.

Ralph Flowers, of Sumter, S. C., stands out as the greatest half-back ever developed by Bill Fetzer. In the cage
game, he was a great forward and he played two seasons on the baseball team. After two years at Davidson,
“Buck” went to Georgia Tech and for three years played half on the Golden Tornado. Five feet eight inches tall
and tipping the beam at a bare 140 pounds, Buck was fast, nervy, and heady, and certainly deserved an All-Southern
berth. Walter Camp mentioned him for All-American honors. The Atlanta Constitution, speaking of his great work, says: “Flowers, the 17-year-old
Davidson half-back, is one of the South’s most brilliant football players. Despite his light weight, he is a fierce tackler,
a good line smasher, a brilliant punter and broken-field runner—all in all one of the best halves the South has
seen in many a day. In the first game of the '17 season, Ralph out-punted Roberts and Ingram of Navy,
ran riot through broken fields and seizing the ball raced 70 yards through the entire Navy team for a touchdown.
In the next game with the ball on State’s 1-yard line, the whistle for the half blew and Flowers’ field
goal, which should have been the margin of victory, was the only Davidson score. State won 7-3. Flowers was the
first man to score on the Golden Tornado in 1917 and shares honor with King, who crossed the Jackets’ goal
line, the last man to score on Tech. In the remaining games, Buck was all there and his work in
the Auburn game wrecked their hopes of a championship. Ralph was a hard man to guard on the hardwood and
was one of the heaviest scorers. On the diamond, he played in the outer gardens and was a perfect fielder.
After finishing at Tech, Buck has been engaged in coaching their Freshman teams.

DAVIDSON GOLFERS DEFEAT SALISBURY’S COMBINATION

The Salisbury followers of the gutta percha met a stinging defeat last Wednesday afternoon, at the hands of Davidson.

A good start and a hot finish proved to be the undoing of the Wildcats. Clemson harvested three counters in
the first on a base on balls, two sacrifices, a double, and a triple. The winning run came across in
the eighth. Herron singled to center, was sacrificed to second, and scored when Freeman threw away Reaves’ bounder. The Wildcats
went out in one, two, three order for the first four innings.

SOUTH CAROLINA ENCOUNTER (Continued from page 1)

Duckett, Wil 4 0 1 1 0 0
McLeod singled and went to second on Turnipseed’s error. Brice popped up and McMillian whiffed but Freeman brought Hankie home
with a single and promptly stole second. Brown singled to right and Freeman counted. M. Erwin doubled to open the
eighth and was sacrificed to third by Brother Luke. Crawford’s timely bingle allowed Mac to canter over with the tying
run. McLeod forced Pat at second but everything looked rosy when Brice bounced a base hit over second. But McMillian
ended it all by forcing Brice at second.

Summary: Two base hits—Batson, McMillian, McLeod. Left on bases—Wofford 5; Davidson 8. First on errors—Davidson 3; Wofford 4. Struck out—by
Sorrel 6; by Taylor 0; stolen bases: Brown, Crawford, L. Erwin; sacrifice hits: M. Erwin, Freeman, L. Erwin; umpire: Grey.

Furman Game.

Looks like old times, yea, verily. No Davidson team was ever more under the spell of the Furman horseshoe than
the 1922 Wildcat baseball team. Despite the fact that the Purple was out-hit, out-pitched, and stole but one base to
the Wildcats' four, they managed to get away with a 3 to 2 victory. How do they do it?

Boushee was on the hill for Davidson and deserved a better fate. Until the sixth inning, one hit was made
off of him and he had kept second unexplored territory. Davidson scored in the second on Roushee’s single, a stolen
base, M. Erwin’s single, and McLeod’s error of Crawford’s bounder. McLeod tallied in the sixth after he had struck out.
Bradburn fumbled the third strike and he was safe at first. Brice’s infield out put him at the half-way sack
and McMillian’s single scored him. Furman tied the count in their half on two singles, a stolen base, and McMillian’s
wild peg. The winning run came over in the eighth on a pair of singles, a sacrifice hit, and Freeman’s
error.

The match started at 2:30 p.m., and although it lasted until nearly 6 o'clock large galleries were present all of
the time. Salisbury did not send over the same team which was here in the fall but their whole team
was a strong one and played excellent games. Those composing this team were: Walker and Lloyd of the first team,
Witherspoon and Sigmon of the second, and Hennessee and Yeager of the third. Bachman and Professor Woods, representing Davidson, crossed
clubs with the first, second, and third Salisbury teams in the order mentioned. The first two teams led off the
match and were followed in order by the second and third. The Davidson team played its usual good game and
defeated Salisbury’s first team 3-up 2. The second team of Myers and DeArmon were excellent, and they won their match
10-up 6. Our only loss was in the third match, where Gracey of Davidson and Walker of Salisbury played a
nip and tuck game, finally resulting in a tie. Both players made numbers of excellent iron shots and long-distance putting.

OPENING GAME
Clemson Game.
Sad business at Clemson last Friday. The Tigers snatched a 4 to 3 game from the Wildcats despite the fact
that the former made but five hits, no stolen bases and two errors while the losers pounded out 11 hits,
stole three bases and made but one miscue. Clemson won because of their superior ability to hit when hits meant
runs. They wasted but two of their safeties, while six of the Wildcats’ knocks went for naught. Every member of
the Wildcats played a good game, but the breaks were against them.

All our skill, facilities, and lifelong knowledge of the finest tobaccos are concentrated on this one cigarette—CAMEL. Into this ONE
BRAND, we put the utmost quality. Nothing is too good for Camels. They are as good as it’s possible to
make a cigarette. Camel QUALITY is always maintained at the same high, exclusive standard. You can always depend on the
same mellow-mild refreshing smoothness—the taste and rich flavor of choicest tobaccos—and entire freedom from cigaretty aftertaste.

And remember this! Camels come in one size package only—20 cigarettes—just the right size to make the greatest saving in
production and packing. This saving goes straight into Camel Quality. That’s one reason why you can get Camel Quality at
so moderate a price. Here’s another. We put no useless frills on the Camel package. No extra wrappers! Nothing just
for show! Such things do not improve the smoke any more than premiums or coupons. And their added cost must
go onto the price or come out of the quality.

One thing, and only one, is responsible for Camels great and growing popularity—QUALITY.
