Cat netters fall to third place
in disappointing SC tourney

By BRUCE HOLLIDAY

Poor weather, hard courts,
and tough draws all spelled
trouble for Davidson’s tennis
team as they finished a disap-
pointing third in the Southern
Conference Tournament held
in Richmond.

Furman swept the first four
divisional titles and the over-
all competition with 64 points.
The Citadel placed a sur-
prising second with 52 points
and Davidson was close be-
hind with 49 points.

William and Mary barely
fell short of the Wildcats with
48 points and the Appalachian
State squad fell completely
apart to finish fifth.

Undefeated in regular sea-
son conference play, the Wild-
cats had been picked as slight
favorites to capture the title.
Davidson’s challenge was de-
alt a severe blow, however,
when rain forced the play from
the relatively slow outdoor
hard courts to the very fast
indoor courts.

Davidson had played its
entire Southern Conference
schedule on the clay courts
and their inexperience on the
faster surfaces was a telling
factor.

Also, because of the rain
delay, much of the competi-
tion was played all Saturday
night and in the early morning
hours on Sunday. Coach Jeff
Frank indicated that the sur-
face rather than the hours
bothered his team the most.

“Nobody is ready to play at
four in the morning, but the
indoor surface affected us
more than the hours. The ball
was skidding a great deal and
our team doesn’t play that
sort of game very well.”

Freshman John Trout
proved to be the bright spot in
Davidson’s record as he came
home with the Division Six
title. Trout did not lose a
single set during the tourna-
ment and defeated Appala-
chian’s Maharaj from South
Africa in the finals.

“Trout had worked as hard
as anyone on the team on his
hard court game. He put in a
lot of extra time and the
beautiful thing was that it
paid off,” explained Frank.

John Mitchell and Steve
Holman picked up a pair of
second place finishes in the
third and fourth divisions
respectively and Brian Cooper
managed a fourth in Division
Five.

In doubles action Chip Bon-
derant and Stewart Boswell in
the first Division and Steve
Johnson and Holman in
Division Three finished third.
Mike Barnhill and Andy
White lost a close match on
the first day and could manage
no better than fifth.

Coach Frank feels that Da-
vidson played well enough but
just didn’t get the proper
breaks.

ECU dominates track championships

Eastern Carolina University
ended ten years of Southern
Conference (S.C.) track domi-
nance by the College of Wil-
liam and Mary while Davidson
again wound up in the cellar in
the 1976 S.C. Championship
track meet held here Satur-
day.

Final scores in the meet
were E.C.U., 187; W.& M.,
134; Furman University, 100;
University of Richmond, 87;
Appalachian State University,
41; Virginia Military Insti-
tute, 32; The Citadel, 27; and
Davidson College, 12.

Davidson track coach Ster-
ling Martin, who was a bit
surprised by the Pirates’ vic-
tory, said, “E.C.U. had the
potential to win last year, but
they just didn’t have every-
body doing their best like they
did this year.”

Martin was very pleased
with the meet, and felt “it was
one of the best we’ve attended;
we dispelled a lot of coaches’
doubts about our ability to
pull this off on a six-lane
track.” Performances in the
meet were exceptional, with
six new conference records and
one new Davidson record set.

The first of the new records
was Richmond’s Chris
Gooch’s hammer throw of
155’8”, bettering the old mark
by over three feet. The E.C.U.
440 relay team’s record of 40.6
was also outstanding, qualify-
ing them for the N.C.A.A.
nationals. Drexel George of
William and Mary put the
shot 56’4½” to break the third
record of the meet.

East Carolina’s Marvin
Dobson broke the old 120-yard
high hurdle record by .1
second when he ran :13.9, and
Pirate speedster Carter Suggs,
North Carolina’s fastest prep
sprinter ever, broke his own
record (shared) in the 100-yard
dash when he broke the tape at
:09.4.

The Wildcats only took four
places in the hammer throw at
137’9¾”, John Stanfield’s
fifth place high jump of 6’6”,
John Lewis’ fourth place pole
vault of 13’6”, and Doug
Horn’s fifth in the 3,000
meter steeplechase, his time of
9:26.5, a new Davidson re-
cord, his fifth new record of
the season.

The Cats ended their season
2-4, a losing season but never-
theless one highlighted by a
fifth-place finish in the David-
son Relays plus a number of
excellent individual perform-
ances. All in all, a total of
eight new records were set and
re-set during the season.
