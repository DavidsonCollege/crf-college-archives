14 THE DAVIDSONIAN ARTS MONDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 1993

Noted scholar of art history Albert Elsen will speak on Rodin and the “Burghers of Calais” on Thursday, November 4,
at 8 p.m. Elsen has written many publications on Rodin and has been involved in many Rodin exhibitions, as well
as many others in the field of modern sculpture. Elsen currently is researching the limits of artistic freedom and is
involved in pioneering a course on the history of this artist from ancient to modern times.

Dr. C. Shaw Smith of the Art History department is very excited about Elsen’s pending speech. Smith says Elsen has
“vast knowledge on Rodin, and will give that knowledge to the campus. In a way, he is presenting the piece
to campus - giving us the knowledge to really enjoy the piece.”

Speaker to discuss Rodin

Smith knows that Elsen is excited about seeing Davidson’s Rodin, “Jean D’Aire," and is looking forward to speaking about Rodin.
Writings on Rodin by Elsen are on reserve in the library and in the Visual Arts Center for students to
read in advance. Elsen will be giving a special seminar for art history majors on Friday morning, but his speech
on Thursday is open to the public.

Elsen is the first speaker in a series of guest lecturers in the history of art. Others to come will
be Carol Duncan, speaking on “Public Spaces, Private Interests: The Shaping of the Metropolitan Museum of Art” on February 14
and Paul Tucker, speaking on Claude Monet on April 14.

The distinguished American poet, Alan Shapiro, will read from his work in the 900 Room of the Davidson College Union
on Tuesday, November 2, at 7:30 p.m. Writing in the Boston Review of Shapiro’s body of work, critic Tom Sleigh
says, “At forty years old and already the author of four superbly written books of poems, Shapiro has produced work
of such authority and originality that he has permanently enlarged my hopes and expectations for contemporary poetry.” The four books
are After the Digging (1981), The Courtesy (1983), Happy Hour (1987), and Covenant (1991). Happy Hour won the William Carlos
Williams Award of the Poetry Society of America, and poet C.K. Williams called Covenant “a marvelous work, one of the
best I’ve come across in years, and one which grows richer and richer on every reading.”

Shapiro was born in Boston and received his B.A. Magna Cum Laude from Brandeis University in 1974. During the late
‘70s he taught creative writing at Stanford University, before moving to the Chicago area, where he served as Poet in
Residence at the University of Chicago and as Associate Professor of English at Northwestern University. In 1989 he moved to
North Carolina, where he now serves as professor of English at UNC-G. His poems have been published in America’s most
important magazines and journals, including American Poetry Review, TriQuarterly, Poetry, Yale Review, and Partisan Review. Shapiro’s latest book, In Praise
of the Impure, a collection of critical essays on poetry, has just been published by Northwestern University Press, and will
be available for purchase and signing along with his books of poems at the reading.

concert at Spirit Square in Charlotte, Wilcox will perform in the 900 Room. Students can attend for only $3. The
musician has been a long-time favorite of Davidson students. Senior John Dalton remembers "sitting around at his high school listening
