SPORTS

Sports All That

By JIM HAMILTON

“The Student” rested his rump on the grandstand seat. His date sat beside him, her arm in his, her warmth distracting. “Dern,” he thought, sneering at convention, “Why do we have to come to this ball game when we could be out at the river lying on a blanket instead of sitting on this hard seat.”

Then came the kickoff and he begrudgingly rose, vowing silently that he would not hop up and down all afternoon even if everyone in front of him was standing and he couldn't see.

The cheerleaders made an effort to stir up enthusiasm, but “The Student” scratched his chin in an intellectual gesture and whispered “Mickey Mouse” to his date. He liked the yell that ended “Booyah,” however, because it reminded him of something T. S. Eliot might have contrived.

As the score grew against his team he ascended even more into his above-it-all attitude. Midway in the fourth quarter he took his date by the arm, got up and left.

Gentlemen, how many of us fit into this mold? The most disgusting thing Saturday was not on the football field, it was in the grandstand. When our team got behind due to a couple of intercepted passes, (and I mean this in no way an alibi for ineptness or a request for enthusiasm when there is no cause for it,) most of us threw up our hands in frustration and, if actions prove anything, lost all interest in the game. And this isn’t just true of Saturday; it occurs regularly.

The players can tell when the students are not behind them as anyone who has talked to them will tell you. One freshman, possibly irritated with the Court of Control, remarked to me, “How can they expect us to have class spirit in an institution where there is no school spirit.”

I know Davidson breeds intellects and sophisticates, but when we get so pseudo-intellectual that we can’t let our hair down a little bit and show some school spirit for fear our dignity will be scarred, I think we better re-examine our set of values. A man may think he’s too big to stoop and effervesce at a ball game. However, “big” men do not hesitate to encourage others. The ones that think they are too big are really the little.

A New Star

A study in perseverance—cross countryman Larry McNeill. Larry was a three-sport star at McCauley Prep School. When he came to Davidson he initially elected to go out for basketball and baseball. His positions in each were against him. In baseball, at first base, he had to compete with slugger George Hart, in basketball at guard with Mintz, Weeks, Ferguson and others of such caliber. In both, though perhaps a valuable member of the team, he would never see regular action.

So Larry switched to cross country. After running his sophomore year to get in shape for basketball, he came out officially this year. At present, Larry is running number two man behind Angus McBryde. And Coach Whittle says he'll be one of his top men again next year. There must be a moral in this somewhere.

THE DAVIDSONIAN

Gridders Engage Wofford; Soccer Squad Meets W&L

By PETE WYRICK

After a disastrous homecoming, Davidson’s football squad journeys to Spartanburg to meet the Wofford Terriers tomorrow night. V.M.I. had gone undefeated for their last fifteen games and Dole’s men were seeking a homecoming upset. Two hours later V.M.I. had extended its victory string to sixteen games and the Wildcats were trudging off the field on the short end of a lopsided 42-7 score.

The strength of the visiting team became readily apparent when early in the first quarter Keydet quarterback Bill Nebraska went over standing up from eight yards out on a quarterback sneak for the first touchdown. V.M.I. scored twice more during the first half and left the field at halftime with a 21-7 lead.

LONE SCORE

Davidson’s lone TD came late in the second period as fullback Dave Warden plunged over from three yards out. Usher converted, giving the Wildcats their final point of the afternoon. The Keydets came out and scored three more times in the last half to squelch any hope of a Davidson comeback. The Wildcats had come back strong in the opening minutes of the third quarter, but soon succumbed to V.M.I.'s powerful ground and aerial attack.

DAVIDSON DRIVE

A determined Davidson drive was halted fifteen yards out. This was the final 'Cat threat as V.M.I. went on to lock up the victory.

Tomorrow night in Spartanburg, Davidson runs up against the Terriers of Wofford College who will certainly be seeking revenge for their defeat last year. In last season’s contest the Wildcats handed them their first defeat of the season and ruined their rating as the nation’s finest small college team. Wofford will be looking for their fourth victory of this season having won three and lost four. Wofford boasts a strong passing attack featuring the combination of Little All-American Charlie Bradshaw to end Jerry Richardson.

“Watch out, dear—he’s after your Camels!”

THIS IS THE 1958 version of Coach Whittle’s Cross-Country Team. Left to Right, McBryde, Cole, Eckbert, Thompson, McNeill, Fleagle, and McKeithen.

Harriers Run Richmond, Try For Third Family Win

By BOB WINSOR

Fresh from a 4-0 shutout over Belmont Abbey the Davidson soccer squad headed north to engage Washington and Lee in Lexington on Saturday. The Wildcats met North Carolina State on Oct. 24, here at Davidson, and lost in the first overtime 2-3.

Foreign Men Voice Opinion On Soccer

By BILL GODWIN

Team Captain Gordon Neville, John Keiter, and Claude Finney played an outstanding game; the rest of the team also turned in fine performances.

Special students from Europe have made a real contribution to Davidson's varsity soccer team, according to Coach J. W. McCutchan. He said that the experience they had received before coming to America, however, had made it easier for them to win places on the squad.

The players themselves spoke rather about the limitations of their experience in soccer. Wiecher Bergsma, who is currently leading the Wildcats in scoring with 11 goals, said soccer was considered a regular form of gymnastics in Holland. “Soccer is on the same level with volleyball and handball.”

On Tuesday, Oct. 28, the Cats traveled to Belmont Abbey where they won by a 4-0 score.Men place an unblemished conference record on the line when they meet Richmond’s Spiders here tomorrow afternoon at 4:30. The unbeaten ’Cat freshmen raced East and West Mecklenburg High Schools in a triangular match here today. Last Friday at Greenville, Angus McBryde loped in with top honors as Davidson edged Furman 36-37 and left the Citadel, with 51 points, far behind in a three-team meet. In the freshman division, David Gilmour lost for the first time this year as another Wildkitten, strong-running Mack Brownlee, finished the 2.8-mile distance in 16:11. Larry Kinney, Ran Shaffner, and Dave Page were also among the top ten finishers as the frosh turned their match into a near rout.

RICHMOND MEET
Coach Heath Whittle sees tomorrow’s match as a nip-and-tuck affair, with Angus McBryde being closely pressed by Richmond's Cochrane. King Cole, Whittle’s number three man, will not be able to run because of an injury. The real test comes this Wednesday when both ‘Cat squads journey to Lexington, Va., to take on Washington & Lee and VMI. The powerful Keydets will be hard to beat but the ‘Cats should have little trouble getting by W&L for a second-place finish.

FROSH HOPE
Whittle believes that if his freshmen can outrun VMI they will be in a good position to challenge Duke in the State Championship meet at Raleigh on Nov. 10. He expects little trouble from Wake Forest, Carolina, and the other freshman state entrants. The Wildkittens currently boast a 5-0 record with wins over Wake Forest, as well as Furman and the Citadel. Mack Brownlee has come along fast to challenge Gilmour’s status as the number one man. The Varsity outlook is not as bright, however, in spite of the fine 2-0 conference record already notched up. Whittle sees no better than a fourth-place finish in the Conference meet as William & Mary, VMI, and West Virginia are expected to be sure bets for the top three places.

Kappa Sigs Keep Lead; IMAC Sets New Rules
The Kappa Sigs broke ahead of the pack once again this week in the furious flickerball race, with an assist from the Phi Delts and the Betas. Betas and the Phi Delts, with 7-2 and 6-2 records, respectively. The Phi Delts and the Betas both handed the ATO's, previously tied with the Kappa Sigs for first, their second and third defeats, leaving the latter alone in the top spot with a single loss. In another important game Wednesday, the Kappa Sigs beat the KAs, last year’s champs, to solidify their hold on the top rung. Should the Kappa Sigs remain unbeaten in the remainder of their contests, they will capture the crown, last held by the green-shirted boys in 1954. Sigma Chi pigskinners topped the Phi Gams on Monday and routed the PiKAs, 40-7, on Tuesday, to move into the runner-up slot. Close behind are the Betas and the Phi Delts.

INTRAMURAL ATHLETIC COUNCIL
The Intramural Athletic Council meeting saw several important matters come up for discussion. Through arrangements with the athletic department, the Council has secured permission to grant intramural referees other than freshmen the choice of either the usual seventy-five cent pay or a free cut in Physical Education. A concurrent stipulation would be that each fraternity shall choose three referees prior to the flickerball, basketball, and softball seasons, who will attend several sessions of a refereeing school. During the season these officials will be rotated at the interfraternity contests.
