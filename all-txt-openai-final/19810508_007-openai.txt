May 8, 1981—The Davidsonian—7

Griffin's .417 batting average
leads Cat’s late season surge

By STEVE SOUD
Staff Writer
The Wildcat baseball team
finished its 44-game race with a
strong sprint on the home
stretch by winning four of its
last five games and leaving
several school records by the
wayside. The team’s final season
record is 18-26.

Junior third baseman Allen
Griffin led the record-breaking
attack as his 4-for-5 batting
performance against Wingate
Tuesday gave him seventy hits
and pushed his average to .417.

Griffin's seventy hits is an
all-time high at Davidson, and
he is only the second Wildcat
player to ever reach the .400
plateau. George Weicker, who
batted .448 in 1975, is the only
other player in school history to
accomplish the feat. Although
Griffin batted .400 twice in high
school, he entered the season
looking for a .350 mark. But,
“with a little luck and a lot of
help from John Porter,” Griffin
far exceeded his expectations.

Just how did senior Academic
All-American Porter help? The
fleet centerfielder gave coach
Charlie Slagle the option of the
hit-and-run, and when Porter
broke for second, holes opened
up for Griffin.

Senior John Haskell, who
lashed out a school record
sixteen doubles, will be denied a
repeat performance by graduation.

The team started the week off
well as it swept its UNCC series
with an 8-4 win. The Cats
pounded out 14 hits and became
the first to sweep the season
series with the Charlotte rival.

Saturday the team outplayed
the Tar Heels of UNC-Chapel
Hill, but came out on the short
side of a 9-7 score. The Cats
outhit the Heels 15-12, and
fielded flawlessly while the
Heels erred three times. The big
difference was two Chapel Hill
home runs.

Against Wingate the team
scattered sixteen hits to win an
8-7 thriller. Wingate went ahead
1-0 in the first, but with two out
and nobody on in the bottom of
the second the Cats loaded the
bases and pushed across three
runs. Wingate had its own
three-run inning, but the Cats
again loaded the bases for three
runs that put them ahead to stay.
Slagle went full throttle with
several hit-and-runs, and Joby
Merton stole third and home.

The 1981 Davidson baseball
team finished 18-26, an improvement
over 1980 (15-24), but the .312
season batting mark really stood
out. Slagle pointed out clutch
hitting and fielding as rough
spots to smooth over for next
year. “Where we could have used a
strikeout or a pop fly, we gave
up a hit. Fielding-wise it was
the same thing,” Slagle said.

Slagle specifically pointed to
the April 4 doubleheader loss to
UT-C as the season’s turning
point. Davidson was 2-2 in the
conference and still in the
running for the Conference
crown. Apparently, however,
the team was looking ahead to
the East Tennessee State game
and lost the doubleheader. The
Moccasins finished seventh in
the Conference standings, one
place behind the Wildcats.
Looking back, pitching stands
out as the team’s chief weakness.
Senior Jonathan Young posted
the best record, with a 5-3
performance, junior Rusty
Colechia (5-7) and freshman
Scott Redding (4-4) were the
most consistent hurlers though.
Next year’s team will again
have a hard time on its Division
I schedule, especially with the
loss of Haskell, Merton, Porter,
Jeff Ray, and Captain Cam
Zurbruegg to graduation.

The Wildcats’ season batting mark stood at a
remarkable .312 this year. (Michael Ke)
