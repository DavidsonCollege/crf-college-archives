On Wednesday, Dec. 5 from 7-10 p.m., Summit Coffee will host a holiday party for the purposes of general merriment
and hospitality.

Hours of building access for all students: Lights On Davidson began Monday, Dec. 3 and will continue until the morning
of Thursday, Dec. 20. During this time, all students will have 24/7 CatCard access to Chambers.

In addition to the book signing, Summit Coffee will kick off a two-week toy drive. A group of Summit employees
will be making the trip to LCH in late December to play Santa Claus, give gifts, and read books to
the young hospital patients. Gifts of all types and sizes are encouraged (ages 8-14). Come on out, relax, enjoy a
fine beverage, and support a good cause. The event is the latest in an ongoing series of fundraising events held
at Summit Coffee.

In January 2007, Summit announced the formation of SummitCares, a branch of Summit Coffee which raises money for a variety
of local charities. Summit hosts one SummitCares Party each month with a designated charity in mind.

Students who currently have late-night CatCard access to other academic buildings will have 24/7 access to those buildings during Lights
On Davidson. All audio-visual equipment in classrooms is for academic use to be shared by all and is not for
the exclusive use of a single person or small group. Signs stating "in use" are not permitted.

**Lost and Found**

While conducting a zone check at the Presbyterian Church, Officer found that the front and side doors were unlocked. Officer

11/30/2007 9:56 a.m. Scooter Incident Student Health Center
Officer received a call that a minor accident had occurred at the Student Health Center parking area. Upon arrival, the
reporting officer met a Physical Plant employee, who stated that she had been operating the maintenance scooter involved in the
accident. The employee explained that after parking the scooter, it rolled forward approximately 30 feet striking a parked, 2004 green
Honda Accord. The scooter caused numerous scuff marks on the passenger side and rear bumper. The vehicle’s owner was also
on the scene. The Physical Plant employee believes the parking brake failed, causing the scooter to roll into the vehicle.
The reporting officer estimated the Honda Accord's damage at $400.00.only and is not. On exam days and on any days
when ~ will have to be removed and sent to Lost. Academic, from page I lack of faculty,” Martin said.
When professors switched from teaching six classes to five, it became more difficult to allocate one of their classes to
this concentration. Martin also explained another faculty concern that has thwarted the success of prior proposals. “How do you define
[the environmental studies concentration]? There has been no cohesive consensus among the faculty,” Martin said. Ingram also cited “interdisciplinary squabbles”
among the faculty as a contributing factor to the proposals' previous failures.

Martin explained the content of the final draft of the concentration, which a six-member committee drafted. The concentration would contain
six courses, one of which would be a required “Introduction to Environmental Studies” class already offered through the Center for
Interdisciplinary Studies. The concentration would also require one natural science course, one social science course, one humanities course, and one
capstone course. The concentration went before the Educational Policy Committee (EPC), which approves all new courses. Martin explained that this
is where all other prior proposals have failed. However, for the first time last week, the committee passed the proposal.

“If [the concentration] passes this academic year, it will be in working order for next fall. [Dean of Faculty Clark
Ross] wants this to happen sooner rather than later,” Martin said. Ingram discussed whether an environmental studies concentration was too
specific to fit with the liberal arts education philosophy. “The concentration could be perceived by some as too narrow, but
without it, aren’t you forcing kids into graduate school who want to go into this field? This is the only
concentration that requires courses from all three disciplines of the College,” Ingram said, pointing out that the proposal complements the
liberal arts education philosophy.

Ingram also said that the College is in the midst of a “running search” for a professor with an environmental
studies emphasis. The new professor will be made possible with the help of a donor endowment. “We’re hoping for someone
to galvanize the campus around environmental issues,” Ingram said. The Duke Endowment pays for several three-year critical teaching positions, which
employ part-time professors. It is assumed at the end of the three years that the College will assume the professor’s
position at its own cost. Davidson is currently looking to begin a three-year teaching session with a professor who brings
a rich knowledge of environmental studies to the College.

The concentration, which has been approved by the EPC, goes before the faculty next week for final approval. If approved,
current seniors would be eligible for credit for the concentration if they have completed all the other necessary courses and
take the capstone seminar course offered this spring.
