A Tip From Jefferson

SUPER SNOOPINGS

On February 21, 1825, Thomas Jefferson wrote from Monticello to his grandson the following axioms which he thought would be good to live by:

1. Never put off 'til tomorrow what you can do today.
2. Never trouble another for what you can do yourself.
3. Never spend your money before you have it.
4. Never buy what you do not want because it is cheap; it will be dear to you.
5. Pride costs us more than hunger, thirst, and cold.
6. We never repent of having eaten too little.
7. Nothing is troublesome that we do willingly.
8. How much pain have cost us the evils which have never happened.
9. Take things always by their smooth handle.
10. When angry, count ten, before you speak; if very angry, a hundred.

One hundred and fourteen years haven’t changed the wisdom of these rules although some of them do not follow the present-day plan of living or the trend of thought. The full observation of these axioms would shatter our present-day credit system, ruin the pleasure of bargain hunting, and wreck the expensive pastime of keeping up with John Jones when he gets something new.

Jefferson, one of the greatest Democrats, would find the democracy of today altered from the democracy of his day. He would find the well-known straight and narrow path with an unfamiliar curve. The fundamental articles of his party’s faith have been distorted by certain circumstances which he would never have dreamed of.

Jefferson was one of the greatest opponents of ignorance ever to live. He believed education was the answer to all national and political problems and he would certainly be downhearted by the ignorance represented by the voters of the twentieth century even though education is advancing even faster than Jefferson himself could have hoped.

Jefferson also believed that human nature need not be an excuse for itself nor forgiven because of its crudeness. He maintained that there is no limit to the improvements it can undergo. It is without a doubt that he would be appalled by the current state of affairs.

Yet certain members of the student council have not hesitated to say the “general welfare clause” grants that body absolutely unlimited pow- ers.A limiting definition is needed. THIRTY-NINE. opinion who Ever since the election for the Editor of The Davidsonian was stopped by the Stu- dent Council the entire Student Body has been beset by rumors—rumors which were false or exaggerated, or rumors which were true, The students had no way of knowing just where they stood, mainly because the action of the Council is secret. First of all then, I suggest that the Council take the initiative in making it legal for its actions to be announced to the Student Body. It was perfectly right for the Council to investigate the election, but they stopped it and offered a new method of selection of the editor’ without making a thorough investigation of the charges in what seems to have been an attempt to evade the issue. Naturally, under such peculiar circum- stances, the amendment failed to pass and the Council sought other action. All this time various rumors were circulating the campus, and after one decision had been reached the groups affected appealed the case. Additional evidence was produced, enough to clarify the matter, and one of the groups was found innocent; yet the others were to be punished in such a way that the most harm would have been done to the group found not guilty even by the Stu- dent Council! Davidsonian In its inquiry the Council seemed to be more eager to punish, through any avail- able technicalities, than to seek out the truth. Their duty should have been to do justice—to ascertain whether there was guilt or innocence instead of simply hunting guilt. The Council sought to prove guilt be- cause complaints had been made, but ay body governing elections properly should function on its own.

Sincerely, E. T. LIIPFERT. it was plain that officials were neg- ligent in conducting them—actually to the extent of violating the rules —nothing was done, because no ac- cusation was made. When it finally completed its hearings the Council realized it find any of the accused parties guilty, but in the statement to the Student Body it was nat made clear that they were inno- cent. Could it be that the Council did not want to admit its error? It had wasted about ten days and had accomplished nothing. Had the Council investigated the matter properly and unbiasedly this delay could have been avoided. (By “un- biasedly” I mean searching for Truth; not Guilt alone). It developed that the groups in question had to practically prove innocence instead of the Council's having to prove guilt. The Council let the issue be clouded by de- tails and impressions when it should have looked at the whole and done justice. A As a result the Council caused worry and trouble to the candidates and the accused parties. Its action brought forth a feeling of mutual martyrdom among the questioned groups, which perhaps created~a could not cooperative feeling approaching the very combine which was supposed to exist and which the Council was to make sure would not be. The Student Council is said to be “the most esteemed body on the campus.” See that it regains that position.

Since you read the sports pages rather more dili- gently than a lesson assignment, you probably noticed in the Ob- server last week the cartoon show- ing the agents of a travel bureau trying to think of a cruise that they might sell to Admiral Byrd. Well we know the answer, and we speak with some authority. For our stateroom was only a few steps away from his on a Bermuda bound boat some ten days ago. Now, a semi-tropical island might seem a bit out of the arctic ex- plorer’s line, but of course, his wife, two daughters and Harvard- man son may have had some in- fluence. BERMUDA hard to understand should go to Bermuda, though. (Incidentally, “the Bermudas” is a more accurate term, since it is a group of islands numbering some- where between 100 and 400—the number depending on how big a rock has to be before you call it an island.) “Picturesque” is the first word that comes to mind in de- scribing it. It’s a sort of incredible mixture of the mountains (judging from the air and rough terrain), the sea-coast, and a dash of Eng- land. The oddest sight to David- It isn’t really why anyone river or spring on the place. Bicycling is the prevalent mode of transportation, though you can get a carriage if you're lazy or have a yen for comfort. Driving on the left doesn’t seem so strange after a half an hour or so, and from then on it’s automatic—with embarrassing lapses. Don’t let any- body tell you there are no autos on the island. The law is that there be no private autos on the public roads. The government has several trucks, an ambulance, etc., and if you're a Vanderbilt you can drive about your estate to your heart's content. No real need for cars, though, since the whole island is only about 15 miles long and very narrow. But anyway, it’s a place where horses are startled by a loud, me- chanical noise, and the dogs never bark at a bike. 7* Rollins College has been given 100 acres of Florida jungle-land to add to its campus.
