CAMPUS CAMERA

Flyers Receive Bid

An invitation was extended the latter part of last year to the Davidson Club. However, it was too late to
act before the close of the session. There are chapters of this fraternity at Duke and N. C. State, and
it is hoped that interest in flying here at Davidson will warrant a fraternity. The Flying Club has also been
invited to join the Intercollegiate Flying Club. This is a national association of clubs which sponsors meets each year. Contests
in bomb dropping, stunting, racing, and other phases of aviation are held at these meets.
