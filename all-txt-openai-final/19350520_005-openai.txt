### THE DAVIDSONIAN, MAY 20, 1935

#### DAVIDSON SEIZED BY DIME LETTER GET-RICH MANIA
**Majority of Students Approached Are Unfaithful to Their Chains**

By Hal Overton

Dime! Send A Dime! Share the Wealth! Such was the caption of many a letter that poured into the local
post office last week as the Denver chain letter fad invaded Davidson. Most of the letters are alike, bearing the
title: “PROSPERITY CLUB—In God We Trust.” Following a list of six names and addresses come the suggestive words—Faith, Hope, Charity.
The following is a typical letter:

“This chain was started in hope of bringing prosperity to you. Within three days, make five copies of this letter,
leaving off the top name and address, and adding your own name and address at the bottom of the list,
and mail to five of your friends to whom you wish prosperity to come. In omitting the top name, send
that person ten cents wrapped in paper as a charity donation. In turn, as your own name leaves the top,
you will receive 15,625 letters, with donations amounting to $1,562.50. Is this worth a dime to you? FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS AND
WATCH THE DIMES ROLL IN.”

Opportunity knocks but once, but once it knocked several times for many fortunate students last week. One sophomore received 5
letters in the same day. The total cost of continuing the chain equals 28 cents—6 three-cent stamps and a dime—a
paltry price to pay for $1,500! But the wretch who breaks the chain is hard-hearted and keeps six people listed
from getting a total of $390.50, the price of 7,810 ice cream sodas, or 2,003 and 1/3 banana splits.

Thirty-two of 50 students questioned, or 64 percent, admitted having received chain letters. Most of these got more than one
such letter, the average being 2.34 per person. According to these figures, 384 students out of the student body of
600 have been blessed with the opportunity to become rich, receiving a total of over 750 letters to date. The
darker side of the situation, however, is shown by the fact that of 68 letters received, only 9 had been
answered—slightly over one-tenth.

The rewards of regular Sunday School attendance are shown by the case of one faculty member who has been the
recipient of seven “Send A Dime” letters and one “Send A Dollar” letter. Another faculty member has received three dimes,
representing a profit of 3 cents over the original investment. This was the only case discovered where money has actually
been received, though the local postmaster reports feeling several dimes.

Many dreams of dollars were shattered on Thursday morning, however, when would-be profiteers woke to read that “Send-A-Dime” letters were
a lottery and therefore illegal, and that participants were to be prosecuted. The whole scheme started weeks ago in Denver,
took hold at once, and soon postmen were weighted down. Post office receipts for April climbed dizzily and many extra
workers found full-time employment in handling the inflated stream of letters. Soon this fad had spread to Chicago, Los Angeles,
Seattle, New York, and throughout the rest of the country. Scores of arrests have been made, but the chain still
goes on. Racketeers in Philadelphia thought of putting their own names at the top of the list, sent out thousands
of letters, and got back a dime for each one.

Variations of “Send-A-Dime” have been “Send-A-Kiss,” “Send-Ten-Dollars,” “Send-Pint-Of-Whisky,” and “Send-Bale-of-Hay,” according to statisticians. If a single chain went unbroken, every
man, woman, and child in the United States would receive a letter within a month, and there are hundreds of
different chains. The originators and charter members of the scheme are the ones who got rich; the others pay. Nobody
knows who started it all, but Postmaster Jim Farley has been accused of originating it as a selling scheme for
his three-cent masterpieces. At least the post office is getting rich.

#### Next Year’s Officers Elected By Orchestra
The Davidson College Salon Orchestra held an election of officers for the coming year at their regular practice last Wednesday
night. The following men were chosen to lead the orchestra next year: Wilbur Edwards, president; William Lunk, vice-president; Harris Bradley,
secretary and librarian; and R. R. Purdy, manager.

The Salon Orchestra consists of six violins, four woodwinds, two basses, tympani, and piano. It has given several concerts this
year and plans a more extensive program for next year. At a recent concert, a silver free-will collection was taken
up for the purpose of buying keys for members of the orchestra. When sufficient funds have been collected, those men
who have served three years with the orchestra will be presented with keys similar to those given recently to band
and glee club members.

#### Davidson Athletic Roll of Honor
(Continued from Page 4)

Fort, Blackwelder, and Quarterman, one of the first groups of candidates to be selected because of their unbeatable records in
wrestling for the past season, also form part of the list.

#### RETT, COCHRAN TO REMAIN HERE
**Military Heads Permitted to Continue Next Year**

Major J. T. Rhett, P. S. M. & T., and Captain F. M. Cochran, Instructor in Military Science and Tactics,
will remain at Davidson College for another year, according to orders received from the War Department. Major Rhett has been
at Davidson for four years and states that he has enjoyed the four years very much and especially enjoyed working
with the high type of men at Davidson College; also that he went to college in an adjoining state and
knew a lot about Davidson, and that he had never heard of anything that was not in favor of the
school.

Captain F. M. Cochran, who has also served four years at Davidson, came here direct from service in the Philippine
Islands. He was a colonel in the late World War and established the first C. C. C. Camp in Western
North Carolina. He has been in charge of the Freshmen taking R.O.T.C. and also has been directing the work on
the improvement of the golf course, under F.E.R.A. He states that he has gained an intimate insight into this fine
branch of the service, that his associations here both officially and socially have been most pleasant, and that he is
quite proud of this year’s graduating class who entered with him four short years ago. He hopes they can keep
somewhat in touch as the years go by.

#### Graham Gives Athletic Day Address Here
(Continued from Page One)

Dr. C. K. Brown, who was to present this award, said that it was now between two fraternities, the Kappa
Sigmas and S.P.E.s. The deciding game will be played soon. Jim Morgan was presented the basketball award by Greer Martin.
This trophy is given each year to the member of the basketball team who shows the most team spirit. Coach
Newton presented the blocking award, for the best blocker on the football team, to Jim Morgan. The “Wildcat football” were
awarded by Dr. S. C. Lyon and Captain N. G.Pritchett, for showing the most interest in Davidson Athletics. Following these
awards, Dr. Lingle introduced Dr. Frank Graham. Dr. Graham said that all of the University of North Carolina men had
great respect for Athletics, for the University team always came back and said that the Davidson team won generously, lost
gracefully, and never quit fighting. He said that it seemed to him as if Davidson Athletics were a cross of
wildcats and cavalry. Not only has Chapel Hill a great respect for Davidson but also it has an appreciation for
the fine men that they send there to law, medical schools and also for the men Davidson sends to their
faculty. Dr. Graham said that he had specifically in mind Bob Fetzer, one of the Davidsonest men there is, another
Captain Pritchett. Dr. Graham said he believed Captain Pritchett and Bob Fetzer were two of the finest men in the
Athletic field. Dr. Frank Graham closed his address with the remark that Chapel Hill stands with Davidson this morning, knowing
that Captain Pritchett has been at Davidson and that his spirit will remain here close to the heart of the
Davidson College Athletic Association. In conclusion, Carleton Chapman presented the student body gift to Captain Pritchett, a set of matched
luggage.

FLAME WITHIN
This is one of Ann Harding's best pictures. She is co-starred with Herbert Marshall. Both are in the medical profession
along with the love profession. She will not give up her career at once but promises in her own manner
to marry Marshall. In the meantime, another enters her life. This is where the plot thickens.

Wednesday and Thursday, May 22 and 23
LES MISERABLES
A close-knit and powerful screen recountal of the Victor Hugo classic, Fredrick March and Charles Laughton give memorable performances.

Friday, May 24
IT'S A SMALL WORLD
Gay dialogue in a wisp of a story presents Spencer Tracy and Wendy Barrie as two whose cars crash in
a Louisiana swamp. Tracy falls hard, but believes that Barrie is a notorious divorcee. Complications are adjusted with numerous laughs.

Saturday, May 25
PEOPLE WILL TALK
The cleverest of the Charlie Ruggles-Mary Roland comedies. Their daughter, Lelia Hyams, has been married to Dean Jagger, and their
first battle has been fought but not won. Deft human comedy-wholesome in fact, so bring the family.

Several Fraternities Commence Renovation
With the blossoming forth of Spring, the College fraternities have awakened to begin their annual landscaping, cleaning, renovating, and reconditioning
of the houses. Some of the chapters that have already gotten busy with the work are the Pi Kappa Phis,
the Betas, the Phi Deltas, and the K.A.’s.

The Pi Kappa Phis have landscaped their grounds, reconditioned the floors, refurnished the house throughout, bought a new library, tables,
lamps, chairs, and sofas. The Beta Theta Pis have reconditioned the floors of the house, improved their landscaping, and bought
new furniture. The Phi Delta Thetas have refurnished their porch with gliding chairs, constructed a horseshoe playground, and bought new
furniture for the house. The Kappa Alphas have bought new rugs, books, tables, and draperies, and reconditioned the floors.

Foot-Sore Juniors Join Military Frat
Scabbard and Blade Keeps Sergeants on Jump
A youthful bugler sounded reveille last Tuesday at the hour of 6:00 a.m. Sleepers wearily pulled bed covers over their
heads in an effort to ward off the notes of impending doom; but something stronger than that made a few
jump warily into their blue denim fatigue uniforms and race down flights of stairs to the roll call of Scabbard
and Blade initiates. When they had come out of the stupor and answered “here,” to bed they went again. Thus
started the unique Scabbard and Blade initiation last Tuesday morning at 6 o'clock. Near the Davidson College Presbyterian Church, the
detail was formed to execute varied movements in extended and close order drill that were followed until they formed on
the quadrangle in front of Georgia at 3:30 o'clock for calisthenics. Dismissal for a dress parade and more calisthenics followed.

Proudly goose-stepping as Ed Windham performed, Captain Bud Wooten, Adjutant and Battalion Commander, led his one-man band, “Sergeanteir” discipline. Okey
Cathey and Battalion Commander Coley rigidly enforced discipline among the ranks of their one-squad companies. Each man was required to
wear at all times of the day a pack that contained four bricks. Accompanying this were curtain rod rifles. Inspection
completed, the men raced to see who was the greatest follower of the Greek messenger, Mercury. Not wishing to omit
any of the parts of a battalion's base, a guardhouse was established at the well from where the men circulated
to and from their posts from 4:20 to 11:00 o'clock with one-half hour for supper. The posts were relieved every
hour thus giving one man an hour on and two hours off duty. The posts ran as follows: No. 1,
Chambers Building to Carolina Inn; No. 2, Church to North Entrances of the School; No. 3, North Entrance to Watts
Dormitory; No. 4, Watts Dormitory to Henderson's Boarding House; and No. 5, Entrance of Fraternity Court to the Church.

Formal initiation was held at 6 o'clock Wednesday in the Quadwrangler’s Room of Chambers.

Davidson Hi-Y Conducts School Chapel Service
The Davidson Hi-Y took charge of the chapel services of the local high school last Thursday, with Dr. C. K.
Brown the chief speaker. The program was conducted in the same manner as the formal meeting, the same opening ceremonies
being observed. This was followed by scripture reading and prayer by Rev. Elzie Myers, of the Methodist Church. Pete Metcalf,
of the senior class, then discussed the work of the Hi-Y, pointing out the significance of the symbol. Immediately following,
William Withers, outgoing president of the local organization and a member of the senior class, introduced the speaker, Dr. C.
K. Brown. Dr. Brown discussed safety and safety rules to be observed by every boy. In his talk, he pointed
out that self-confidence was a virtue, but that “cocksureness,” an American trait, was a real rut in which to fall.

The newly elected Hi-Y officers for the 1935-36 year will be Lewis Parker, president; Bob Wood, vice-president; Kenneth Pope, secretary;
and James Mooney, treasurer. They succeed William Withers, Richard McClain, Samuel Thompson, and Harold Mooney in their respective posts.

Council Plans Bigger Dances
(Continued from Page One)
The plan was accepted unanimously by all of them. If the student body as a whole accepts the plan as
readily, one of America’s leading orchestras will be guaranteed. Members of social fraternities who wish to be a member of
this plan will pay their Pan-Hellenic Council representatives the one dollar a month, and non-fraternity men who wish to be
members will pay their dollar to any council member they wish. The idea of having members of the plan pay
one dollar a month is to secure enough members at the beginning of school to merit getting a leading orchestra,
so that Davidson can go on and get the contract before anyone else. If the members of this plan don’t
become members but wait until the time of the dance to buy tickets, they will have to pay about seven
dollars, which will be two dollars more than the members who pay their dollar a month from September to January.
If the students really want the best at Davidson, they must plan to become a member of this plan for
bigger and better dances, and make a date this summer for Mid-winters.

FOR THAT 7TH INNING STRETCH
It’s the tobacco that counts, and there are no finer tobaccos than those used in Luckies.
