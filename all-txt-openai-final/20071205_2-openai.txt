2 THE DAVIDSONIAN

AIDS, from page 1

Only 12 percent of the U.S. population account for 19 percent of new HIV cases over the past couple of years. Case, who leads the Davidson in Mwandi trip, and Sanders, who attended the Mwandi trip, shared that there are similar misconceptions about AIDS among Mwandi’s population. According to Case, AIDS is a “death sentence” in rural Africa, where access to drugs that inhibit viral replication is less accessible than in the US. “People are shunned if their status [of having HIV] is known,” Case said, so many people there refuse to be tested. The anger many people in Mwandi feel over the disease’s devastation drives Mwandians to find scapegoats for their suffering. According to Sanders, at one church service she attended in Zambia, the minister preached that “the disease was brought to Africa by the white people to eradicate races from the planet.”

The statement’s harsh undertones result from the Mwandians’ frustration that innocent children are being infected by the disease, whereas many Mwandians previously believed that the disease was a punishment from God for sinners. The main problem in Mwandi is the lack of knowledge about AIDS’s sexual transmission and the Church’s abstinence-only education. Church is the Mwandians’ main social outlet and could serve as an effective means for AIDS education. According to Sanders, however, the Church preaches, “Abstain, Be Faithful, Condomize” and only gives condoms to married couples. However, Sanders offered some context, saying, “sex for them is a way of life... that is their income, that is the way they get food and money. Men don’t like it when you ask them to wear a condom.” Case reaffirmed this, saying that, “the power structure is perpetuating AIDS in Africa, especially among women.”

Many people in Africa received mixed messages about the disease when, according to Flores, “the President of South Africa publicly stated that AIDS is not caused by a virus,” he said. However, if people who have public influence in Africa do not share the truth about AIDS and prevention methods for the disease, they could easily see the demise of their country. “Some of these [African] countries are going to collapse if things continue the way they are,” Wessner said. To fight AIDS in both the U.S. and abroad, Baez urges people to realize and promote alternative forms of protection. “Abstinence is not working,” Flores said. Baez shared there are also measures that can be taken to spread AIDS awareness at Davidson, including normalizing HIV testing and making condoms readily available on campus. Flores attributed increased AIDS awareness on campus to Warner Hall. “You have to take the initiative to spread awareness or else people will never talk about [AIDS],” Flores said.

That they have a better understanding of what we do, organizations are beginning to realize we are a good investment and we have become more sophisticated in our events.” The Mobile Community Dental Clinic represents one example of growth in recent years. Through grants and donations, the Dental Clinic was dedicated in 2006 and now provides dental care for working adults, senior citizens, and immigrants who do not have access to dental care. Johnson’s successor as Executive Director is Jay Laurens. For the past eight years, Laurens was the Executive Director of a nonprofit agency serving individuals with developmental disabilities such as mental retardation, autism, and traumatic brain injuries. With experience operating six community-based, residential facilities, combined with his previous professional experience, Laurens was an ideal candidate to pick up where Johnson left off.

Davidson College and Ada Jenkins

The College has had a very good relationship with Ada Jenkins in recent years. Various members of the Town and College community, in addition to all Bonner Scholars, volunteer at Ada. James Wudell ’11, who volunteers as an after-school tutor at Ada, values his experience because “it allows for building a relationship with kids over a long period of time.” However, Wudell is slightly concerned that “students don’t follow through on their commitments to the program. In the class I work in, we’ve gone from having too many tutors to not enough in the course of a semester.” Mary-Moore Lowenfield ’11 also volunteers as an after-school tutor and echoes Wudell’s positive feelings. “It is so easy to become self-absorbed in college, and it is so nice to be able to take a break and think about others. Ada provides a way for college students to really reach out beyond themselves.” But again, like Wudell, Lowenfield sees room for improvement in Ada-College relations. She suggests making the children feel more comfortable visiting the campus. “The kids at Ada Jenkins are sometimes afraid to step on campus, into this ideal setting which can seem at times so far away from the real world.” She cites Halloween as a successful attempt to make kids more comfortable visiting campus. “The kids still talk about how much fun that night was,” Lowenfield says, “and I think we need to seize more opportunities to get them here, and break down the barrier between the College and the Town.” Jenny Geyer ’09, who has volunteered at AdaFor over two years, commented on Ada’s growth. “With the rise in the population of Latinos, Ada has developed programs that ease people into the community, from Yoga to computer training in Spanish and English classes. They have really tried to make the transition easier and help out those that are being affected by all the development in the area.” Jon Wolf ’09, who has also volunteered at Ada for several years, attributes the growth of the after-school program to the quality of the leadership under program director Diane Means. “The tutor training process has become more streamlined and helpful, due mainly to the program’s wonderful ability to take feedback and make changes,” Wolf says. Most notably, the schedule for the children in the program has changed a lot. “Because they serve multiple schools, their kids arrive at the center at varying times, and they’ve done a great job keeping up with this, and tailoring the schedule to maximize the effectiveness of the program,” Wolf says. “The tutors, I think, have also very much benefited from these changes. My first year tutoring there, I felt like a good bit of my time was used ineffectively, but since they’ve changed the schedule, I think tutors are far better utilized, and I’ve not felt like my time is wasted.”

Ada Jenkins’s Success and Services

Its diversity of programming makes The Ada Jenkins Center unique. Johnson refers to Ada as a “clearinghouse for folks that want to help and those that need help. I am constantly amazed with all that happens at Ada Jenkins.” Johnson attributes Ada’s success, in part, to “the solid foundation of family support, youth education, and job preparation. From this foundation, we have been able to add lots of depth.” Over the years, Ada has added a social worker, bilingual support for the Latino community, partnerships with other non-profits in the area, growth in the after-school program (which began with 20 kids and now helps close to 60), and a medical and dental clinic. “We began with little seeds that have now flourished into a tree with all our different programs as branches,” Johnson says.

Today, Ada Jenkins offers three basic categories of service: education, family, and health.

The Future of Ada Jenkins

In addition to its current lineup of programs, Ada is creating a Financial Stability Services program. Johnson feels that “25% of our base is truly ready to enter this program now, and the other 75% can become ready through our other three core services. The goal of the program is to teach people to become self-reliant and independent.” Another effort, called “Ada without Walls,” hopes to reach out to communities by working with other non-profit agencies and providing programming closer to where people live. As part of this effort, Ada has begun partnerships with Huntersville to assist with its large Latino population by talking with Latino residents, educating, and providing information. Additional efforts also include providing programming, computers, and health resources to the Smithfield community in Cornelius.

Town development, however, is the main issue that Ada faces over the coming years. Despite major economic pressures to develop, Johnson is confident that the Town can maintain the diversity that makes it so unique. Johnson says that “there is a strong desire among everyone in the community for the diversity of our town to be retained. It is what makes Davidson unique. We are the only community in Mecklenburg that has truly been able to retain the ethnic and economic diversity of the past, and we are going to do everything we can to stay that way.” In order for this to happen, Johnson says that there must be “discussions with the West Side regarding what it wants to be going forward. We need to make sure everyone is better prepared to make decisions, and the way we do that is by helping to educate and providing affordable housing throughout all of Davidson.” Johnson believes that Ada’s role in this process is “to be nimble and adjust to changes of the Town and the effect this has on the community it serves.” As a Town Commissioner, Johnson hopes to be able to assist with this process. “It takes all types of communication,” Johnson says. “With my background, I hope to be able to help members of the Town Board understand the needs of the community. However, we cannot simply listen. We must listen to understand. There is lots of information being exchanged nowadays,” Johnson said. “But what is the quality of that information, and are we really listening? We have to do more communication face-to-face. That is what I want to help do.”
