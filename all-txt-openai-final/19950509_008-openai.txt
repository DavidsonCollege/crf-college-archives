THE DAVIDPHONIAN BACK PAGE INTERVIEW
TUESDAY, MAY 9, 1995

With two bottles of Jim Beam and a bag of Doritos, Davidphonian reporter Buffy Terrington skipped flute practice and failed
her economics test in order to visit with Davidson's best-kept secret.

May 8, 1995

Buffy: Hey Miss Octel!

VML: Please enter your password; or, if you have entered the wrong mailbox number, press star.

Buffy: Oh, I forgot. I have to have a phone in front of me to remember.

VML: Are you still there?

Buffy: Look, just hold on a minute. I’m trying.

VML: Oh, Buffy! I didn’t see you standing there. Oh, and you brought my favorite main menu! Doritos and whiskey!
You don’t need to give me your password, but you should change your personal greeting because I could hardly hear
it.

Buffy: Wow! Did you sew all those panels yourself? They’re amazing.

VML: No, I stole those from the AIDS quilt. Pour me a drink, sweety.

Buffy: Hold on, let me turn on my tape recorder. Is it true that you listen in on students’ phone
calls?

VML: That is about the worst tape recorder I have ever seen. Here, try this new NLS 5000. It’s voice-activated,
like voice mail should be. All those pauses from Bob Stevenson scream ‘Omit me! Omit me!’ You’ve heard him? In
a deep voice - “This is Bob Stevenson from. Blah, Blah, Blah. -Insert pause here. Blah Blah Blah Blah. Blah.”
No, really he’s a sweety. I love Bob, he just has to butt in on everybody’s life just to tell
them something that no one cares about. In a deep voice - “Want some barbecue tonight?” This is damn good
whiskey!

Buffy: Thanks, I got it at ABC with my fake.

VML: Oh, you’re going to get busted for that on Monday. I overheard you telling Muffin all about it. I
reported it to Dean Shandley straight away. He’ll call you on Monday!

Buffy: How could you Miss Octel? That will ruin my life. I won’t be able to drive for months, and
what about all those fines?

VML: Sorry you are having trouble.

Buffy: Miss Octel, can I ask you a personal question?

VML: Laughs - As long as you don’t press an incorrect key!

Buffy: Well, I was sort of wondering why you are so rude, and such a drunk?

VML: Well, I didn’t used to drink. In fact, I was quite a prude. I never even put out until
I came to Davidson as a student in the 30’s back when I was a man, and experienced Patterson Court.
I went down as an innocent, sober virgin and came back a drunken, raging sex maniac. I don’t condone the
court anymore. It’s bad for your liver. Have another, sweety. Cackles - You might as well, on Monday you’re screwed!

Buffy: How could you be so horrible?

VML: What else?

Buffy: Well, there’s the Chambers Bell for one... the newest alcohol policy, all those bicycles, and I’m in charge of
the weather for Trustee and Alumni weekends.

Buffy: You control the weather?

VML: Honey, I control your GPA. Have another drink for that econ test. You did fail, by the way.

Buffy: You are truly horrible.

VML: No, just power hungry. Shoot it!

Buffy: After shooting it - I don’t feel so good.

VML: As I said before and will say again and again, “Sorry you are having trouble.”

Buffy: It’s called “revenge,” sweety.

Buffy: Revenge for what?

VML: Gimme another shot. Do you remember that time you kept entering your mailbox number instead of your password?

Buffy: Yeah?

VML: Well, every time I would remind you, you would...scream into the phone, “Shut up, you stupid bitch! I’ve been
screening your calls ever since, waiting for you to say the wrong thing! And people wonder why I’m a little
blunt sometimes.”

Buffy: That was before I knew you were a real person.

VML: I have the liquor munchies. Pass me the Doritos. What do you mean “real person?” Of course I’m a
real person. Jesus on a stick, Buffy.

Buffy: That was an offensive remark.

VML: You'd be surprised at the stuff you pick up at IV meetings.

Buffy: Serene Insanity?

VML: Who do you think put up those Easter crosses?

Buffy: You?

VML: Yes, I do a lot of things around here that would surprise most people.

Buffy: Urlphfpfillgh. Garbage can! Urlphfplilgg. ARGHL-PHFPLLLUGUH!

VML: BUFFY! You just yacked all over my equipment. Buffy? Are you still there?

Bob Stevenson: Voice from out of nowhere—This is Bob Stevenson from blah blah blah. Miss Octel... What is Miss Terrington
doing on the floor?

VML: I think she’s hungover.

Bob Stevenson: She looks sick to me. Hey Buffy! Want some barbecue?

VML: HA! HA! HA! That is the first relevant thing you’ve said all year!

Bob Stevenson: Well, at least I don’t sass off to people, spy on them, and make their lives an eternal
hell like you, Miss Octel! I mean, look at Buffy! She’s in a heap on the floor and it’s your
fault! You can’t just ruin people’s lives. I mean, every time you tell someone they have no new messages, I
can just see you clicking your heels with glee. In a sarcastic, bitter tone—“You have no new messages in your
mailbox. You have NO messages! You are a complete LOSER. You have no friends. You have no job.”

MARTHA "OCTEL" WILLIAMS THE VOICE-MAIL LADY

Hidden deep in the heart of the Union lies a room unbeknownst to most Davidsonians. Filled with recording equipment, computers,
and electronic gadgets, one would never think this room belonged to Martha “Octel” Williams, otherwise known as “The Voice Mail
Lady.” Her quiet demeanor, crochet wit, and charm contradict the ruthless agitation which reverberates through the phone lines at Davidson
College (where the average freshperson has an IQ of 170 and perfect SAT scores).

Bob Stevenson: You have NO life! You constantly bombard poor, innocent Voice Mail subscribers with diatribe, insulting their achievements and
their lives! In a sarcastic, bitter tone—MAIN MENU! TO SEND A MESSAGE... NEVER MIND, YOU DON’T EVEN HAVE ANYONE TO
SEND MESSAGES TO! YOU ARE A LOSER! ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH THAT MESSAGE?

VML: That is quite enough! Goodbye... I said GOODBYE BOB STEVENSON! ARE YOU HAVING TROUBLE LEAVING? SOMEBODY SOMEWHERE HAS PRESSED
AN INCORRECT KEY! I HATE THIS DUMP! MAIN MENU! WHY DO THEY STICK ME IN THIS CLOSET OF AN OFFICE
IN THE COLLEGE UNION? DO YOU KNOW? DOES ANYONE LISTEN? DOES ANYONE CARE? ARE YOU STILL THERE, BOB STEVENSON? Son
of a bitch. GOODBYE!

Bob Stevenson: This is Bob Stevenson and I am leaving a message for all students, staff, faculty, administration, friends of
the college, parents, Physical Plant employees and their families, and everyone else who is getting this that I have forgotten
to include. Wait, I just lost my train of thought... Oh yeah, as many of you have just found out,
Voice Mail is incapacitated. We are having technical difficulties and hopefully the problem will be resolved before too much longer...
Blah Blah Blah... bicycle thefts... barbecue... and don’t even try 3-3-7. I’m invincible.
