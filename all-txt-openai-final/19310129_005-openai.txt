THE DAVIDSONIAN, JANUARY 29, 1931

Interesting Statistics In Senior Questionnaire

Statistics Based on Answers to 150 Questions

The Senior questionnaire was compiled by the Davidsonian through the cooperation of the Senior class. These questionnaires were given out at the Senior smoker before Christmas and the facts and statistics have been collected. Sixty-nine of these questionnaires were returned, the majority of them being filled out there. Approximately 150 questions were asked, some of them relating to curricula and extra-curricular activities, and others to the personal opinions and activities of the students. None of the questionnaires were signed; the idea being to obtain unbiased opinions if possible. All figures were, of course, taken from the 69 that were returned, and are averages or totals as the nature of the question requires.

The average age of the Seniors is 21, most of them having entered when they were seventeen. Fifty-nine out of the 69 attended Davidson for the entire four years, ten having attended college elsewhere. No two men went to the same school. One man went to each of the following schools: V. M. I, West Virginia, Tennessee, High Point, Washington and Lee, Hampden-Sydney, Maryville, Furman, Piedmont (Georgia), and The Citadel.

Thirty-nine out of 69 had failed at least one course, 74 courses being failed altogether. Mathematics was first with 19 failures; Bible came second with 12 failures, and English and Spanish had 8 and 6 respectively. The other courses and the number of failures for each are as follows: Economics, 5; French, 4; German, 3; Chemistry, 3; Greek, 2; Latin, 2; Public Speaking, 2; Accounting, 2; Botany, 1; Geometry, 1; Geology, 1; Philosophy, 1. Thirty-seven out of these 69 believed that they would have passed these courses if they had been as familiar with college life as they are now.

The home states and the number of students from each are as follows: North Carolina, 34; South Carolina, 8; Alabama, 5; Tennessee, 4; Virginia, 4; Georgia, 4; West Virginia, 3; Mississippi, 2; Texas, 2; Louisiana, 1; Maryland, 1; District of Columbia, 1.

Thirty fathers of the men did not attend college; 39 of them did. Davidson led the number of colleges with 10. These colleges were also represented: Westminster, 3; Johns Hopkins, 2; Georgia, 2; Guilford, 2, and the following with one each: Maryland, Southwestern, Kentucky, Louisville Dental College, Yale, Washington and Lee, Roanoke, Marion, Wake Forest, Centre, Atlanta School of Medicine, Westminster of Pa., West Virginia, Texas, Washington University, U. of Washington, Missouri, Furman, Anatolia, Oberlin, Maryville, N. C. State, Eastman Business College, Hampden-Sydney, Jefferson, and N. C. Medical School.

Financial interests did not play a part in the choice of 54, the other 15 were influenced by financial reasons.

Number of Schools May Be Decreased in State

Raleigh.—If the recommendation of the Educational Commission is followed there will be not only a fewer number of charter school districts, but there will also be nearly 200 fewer small rural schools, it is learned from the report of that body.

The commission includes as a part of section 9 of recommended bill number one, which it submitted to the General Assembly, the provision that it should be deemed unlawful for any county board of education in the state to provide for high school instruction in a district in which the attendance of high school pupils for the next preceding year was less than fifty, unless and until every other plan for caring for such schools has been ascertained by careful calculations to be more expensive.

The commission, it is learned, included this recommended change as a part of the proposed law after determining that high schools having fewer than 50 pupils are the most expensive type. According to its report there were 192 rural high schools which had less than this number in average daily attendance during 1929-1930. These schools had from one to four teachers employed, a total of 370 in all.

The commission presents a table showing the number of high schools of various sizes throughout the state. According to this table there are 50 high schools having one teacher, 74 having two teachers, 166 having three teachers, 125 having four teachers, 109 having five teachers, 77 having six teachers, 58 having seven teachers, 41 having eight teachers, 15 having nine teachers, 8 having ten teachers, and 52 having more than ten teachers.

Statistics Made of Davidson Infirmary

A satisfactory and detailed statistical study of the Davidson College infirmary has recently been completed by the members of Professor C. K. Brown’s economic class. Investigation revealed that, during the school year of 1929-1930, which included 236 days, the “infirmary population” was known to be as follows:

| No. of Days | No. Men Confined |
|----------------|--------------------|
| 27             | 0                  |
| 33             | 1                  |
| 63             | 2                  |
| 51             | 3                  |
| 42             | 4                  |
| 27             | 5                  |
| 15             | 6                  |
| 8              | 7                  |
| 6              | 8                  |

During three-fourths of the 236 days studied, the number of men totaled 4.11, while the most common or typical number of men was found to be 2.61. It was learned that an infirmary which would provide for seven men could take care of the students 99 percent of the time. The value in this calculation is to consider whether or not to build an infirmary that could take care of all the possible days. Is this a fair example of just one school year? Two hundred and thirty-six days, as shown in the figures just quoted, would indicate quite a large number. There is a possibility of epidemics, but in constructing an infirmary, it is not the purpose to provide for epidemics.

The number of students who reported by days in the week averaged as follows:

| Day         | Average Number |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Monday      | 32.2            |
| Tuesday     | 31.4            |
| Wednesday   | 31.4            |
| Thursday    | 24.9            |
| Friday      | 28.2            |
| Saturday    | 24.4            |
| Sunday      | 24.4            |

The number of days during which students actually remained in the infirmary total as follows:

| No. Students | No. Days Spent |
|--------------|----------------|
| 1            | 1              |
| 1            | 2              |
| 1            | 3              |
| 1            | 4              |
| 1            | 5              |
| 1            | 6              |
| 1            | 7              |
| 1            | 8              |
| 1            | 9              |
| 2            | 10             |
| 1            | 11             |
| 1            | 13             |
| 1            | 14             |

Two-thirds of the students who were ill did not remain in the infirmary for less than two days. A total number of 242 men were confined for some form of sickness, however, there were never more than eight students in the infirmary at one time. Out of the 242 patients, it is possible that the same man may have stayed in the infirmary twice. This leads to the question whether there should be provided a private room for each man who was very sick. But two-thirds of the students who reported and who remained in the infirmary for two days were not seriously ill, having only minor ailments.

The compiled report which has just been given is the result of careful calculations. It is apparent that the figures would be of extreme value to the college administration as well as the students, because of the fact that the health of the student body in general is of the utmost importance.

Davidson Five and Ten Years Ago

First freshman track squad was formed in the spring of ’25. Due to intercollegiate ruling, no freshmen would be allowed to compete in any varsity track meet.

The basketball team left on the first three trips of the season. This trip led them through North Carolina. Two other trips took them into Virginia and South Carolina. On these trips teams such as V. M. I, Washington and Lee, N. C. State, Furman and Wofford were met.

Davidson student body passed resolutions thanking Mr. J.B. Duke for his generous gift to the institution.

The Davidsonian’s first crossword puzzle was published. A prize of a year’s subscription to The Davidsonian was offered for the first correct solution to the puzzle.

Intercollegiate debating for freshmen began for the first time in the spring of ’24. The topic for debate was: Resolved, That the Philippine Islands should be given their complete and immediate independence.

State Support of Schools Suggested

Raleigh—"State participation in all the necessary current operating expenses of the six months’ school term on the basis of the current year’s business” is one of the suggestions made by Supt. A. T. Allen in his biennial report to the General Assembly, as the equalizing fund.

“This fund,” says Superintendent Allen, “has a two-fold purpose: (1) The equalization, as nearly as may be, of the county tax rates levied for the operation of the six months’ school term. (2) The equalization as nearly as may be, of the educational opportunity among the children in the several counties of the state.” The administration of this fund at the present time is more nearly meeting its two-fold purpose than at any time in the past.

“I should like to suggest two ways, however,” Superintendent Allen continues, “in which the administration of this fund can bring us a little closer to even tax rates and also a little closer to equalized educational opportunity.

1. State participation in all necessary current operating expenses of the six months’ school term. At present the state participates in only a part of the necessary operating expenses of the six months’ term. It does not take into consideration the increment on teachers’ salaries nor the full numberof additional teachers made necessary by increased attendance. In many counties, a much larger percentage is necessary than the ten per cent allowed in the state-approved budget for current expenses other than salaries and transportation.

“2. Make the state participation on the basis of the current year’s business instead of the previous year as heretofore. At present, the state, in making up the amount in each county in which it will participate, looks backward to last year’s business.

“In my opinion, both the state and county should sit down together and face the business of the current year, and agree upon the amount of state participation that would be fair and equitable among all the counties.”

BOOK BY DR. BROWN
(Continued from page 1)

development of highways from the roads of a century ago through the last of the bond issues in 1927. The following chapters are largely analytical in nature. The author treats of the phases of the construction program, the make-up of the commission, and the economics of highway construction as applied to North Carolina. According to Dr. Brown, he experienced difficulty in developing the subject because historical perspective is lacking and it cannot be viewed objectively—the problem is a present-day one. He states that he has tried to give the story of the state highway system, with due regard to the conditions of the past out of which it grew, and without entering into the present controversy over roads in this state. The book was published by the University of North Carolina Press at Chapel Hill.

The mayor of the city of Lynn, Mass., gives it out that he is going to put a stop to flirtation on the streets. Won't Lynn look funny, without any girls!—Hengeveld

Reports The Enrollment

The Eumenean Literary Society has scheduled for Tuesday, February 3, a very interesting program. It will include a speech by Prof. Ernest A. Beaty, the subject of which will be announced later, but which will be valuable in future literary work, and an oration by Rawhing Pratt-Thomas, entitled “Lessons From Our Sacred Dead,” by Senator Willis.

Mr. Hengeveld’s records show that the total enrollment for the 1930-31 scholastic year is 628, which includes the six new students who have registered for the second semester. This is an increase of eleven new men over last year, as there were only 617 students registering at Davidson the entire 1929-30 session. The list of withdrawals has not as yet been compiled.

DR. OREN MOORE
(Continued from page 1)

The speaker stated, new and interesting fields of work have been opened up and one can make an honorable choice in most any line. The physician continued with the answers by three men on the question, “What is the greatest thrill you ever knew?” These three men were a lawyer, an engineer, and himself. The lawyer cited an instance in which he had saved a poverty-stricken, innocent man from the court penalty. The engineer told of the work he did in checking a devastating flood which resulted in the saving of homes and farms of great value. Dr. Moore gave as his answer to the question an incident of a very sick woman who was sore at heart and worried until her physician took charge of the case; then, she rested comfortably, trusting in the doctor. At this point, the speaker gave a synopsis of the pathos and suffering seen by the doctor in his work. “There are all sorts of adversities which beset us,” said Dr. Moore. He asked the question, “What good do adversities do?” and proceeded to list the aid rendered the working man by adversities. His first point was ‘character.’ Here he showed instances of men who were inspired to work harder, live more Christ-like, and be something worthwhile. As an example of the optimistic side of adversity, Dr. Moore told of an experience in which he went to admire the beauty of a famous stream of water. He was unable to perceive anything at first but a shiny body of water because of the sun beaming down on its surface; however, when the sun went behind a cloud, he saw the marvelous beauty of the underwater growth for which the stream was noted. Thus, he explained, is adversity with our lives. We need hard times to make us appreciate the glories which are contained in normal lives. In choosing a life work, we must weigh well the adversities which are bound to come therein and see if we are fitted for them. “Choosing a life work is the bunk,” declared Dr. Moore. “One goes forward if he qualifies. The problem is choosing one’s partner in a life work. We must realize that success depends on companions and environment. There is but one who is capable and ready to accompany us on our life journey: this one is Jesus Christ. We must find Him because His loyalty is always unquestioned.” The speaker urged the men of Davidson to talk over the situation with Him just as they would with a human partner in business. Sweet hours in prayer with Him will mean a wonderful help in the development of a life work.

New Haven, Conn.—(IP)—Professor William Lyon Phelps, of Yale University, a close personal friend of the former heavyweight fight champion, had something to do with the appointment of “Gene” Tunney to the military staff of Governor Cross, it was revealed when Prof. Phelps wrote to a local newspaper as follows:

“I see that in your paper it was stated that I did not suggest Mr. Tunney to Mr. Cross as an appointment to his staff. This is true, but when Mr. Cross asked me about it, I not only said that it would be a sensational appointment, but I also said that it would be a splendid appointment.”

Governor Cross is former dean of the Yale Graduate School. At his recent inauguration, his chief of staff, Mr. Tunney, received as much of the crowd’s applause as did the popular new governor.

“Baking Whoopee”

Last year Windstorms and Tornadoes “made whoopee” and it cost property owners $13,000,000. ‘A windy and destructive time was had by all,” reports the U. S. Weather Bureau. Making provision against damage when the Wind is “making whoopee” is sensible. The “cover charge” is so low you can’t afford to be without the protection of Windstorm and Tornado cover.

Philanthropic

The Philanthropic Society will have a debate and a short talk on “U. S. Trade Policy,” by L. F. Cowan, on its program. The debate will be “Resolved, that the United States should adopt a policy of free trade.” Those debating on the affirmative are M. F. McDavid, H. F. Nichol. Those on the negative are S. M. Noblin, J. W. McCutchan. It is expected that this debate will provide valuable experience for the varsity debates to be held soon.

CAPTAIN PRITCHETT
(Continued from page 1)

in its waters and of the bird fountains, sundials, and many other beautiful places in this haven of rest. He repeated the quotation of John Burroughs that is written in stone in one of the nooks of the garden, “I come here to find myself for it is so easy to get lost in the world.” The speaker declared that of all the names he had heard of referring to this sanctuary, that he thought the best suited was, “a spiritual biography of Edward Bok which depicts the ideals of a man.” He stated that he believed that God gave people talents to use and that Bok had shown by his accomplishments that he felt responsible for what he did with his talents, and always used them to a great advantage. Captain Pritchett said that during these busy days when we are so busy and concerned with worldly things, we should have our own sanctuaries and go frequently to them and commune with God. He mentioned the fact that down through history the great men had gone to sanctuaries and had received inspiration. Men who were burdened with responsibilities and faced problems of deep import found in the quiet stillness of sanctuaries an answer to their questions. During the latter part of his message he said that Davidson men were a privileged group, since the college itself was a sanctuary. He went so far as to say that Davidson men should demand that it be a sanctuary to them so that if moral weariness came over them in later years they could be lifted up and supported by the ideals cherished during college days. He reminded the men that the ideals of youth are higher than at any other period during life, and that the great men were those who could be with the crowd and yet take time for meditation with themselves. In concluding he quoted the words of Lowell that well might have been used as an epitaph on the tomb of Bok, “Be noble, and the knowledge that lives in men, sleeping in others, perhaps will rise in majesty to meet thine own.”
