The volleyball team continued its impressive conference run, sweeping Georgia Southern and knocking off Wofford in four games. But they
lost 3-1 Sunday to Furman, a team that always seems to have Davidson’s number.

“It’s a disappointing loss,” said coach Lisa Marston, “but I’m not disappointed in our team’s play. We haven't beaten Furman
in at least five years.”

The Paladins took the first game 15-12 before dropping the second 15-6. Then they muscled their way to wins of
15-10 and 15-11 to preserve the victory.

“We need to keep our heads up and keep working hard,” Marston said. “We know everyone is after us.”

Other results for the Wildcats included a 3-0 loss to Wake Forest on Oct. 8 and a 3-1 victory at
Georgia State on Oct. 12. Davidson is now 10-11 overall and 7-3 in league play.

The field hockey team went on the road for three tough out-of-conference games over fall break. They defeated Siena 6-1,
lost to American 4-0, and outlasted Virginia Commonwealth 3-2 in double overtime.

Davidson won in convincing fashion over Siena University on Oct. 11. Their six goals were the team’s highest single-game total
so far this season.

The Wildcats fell to a talented American University squad two days later, but then bounced back Sunday with a thrilling
double-overtime victory against VCU. Attacker Lisa Holthaus had a big day, scoring both of Davidson’s goals in regulation. With the
score deadlocked at two, the teams headed into overtime, where Erin Smith came through with the game-winner in the final
minute of the second OT.

The cross country teams ran through dreary weather at UNC Charlotte Saturday. The men’s team finished 12th out of 14
teams. Of the 15 Davidson runners, 13 registered their best time of the season, and five had their best time
ever. Brent Ferrell once again led the team with his career best — 26:27. Rookie phenom Neil Burt was second
in 26:43.

The women’s team shocked Western Carolina in a meet that included seventh-ranked N.C. State and top 25 teams Wake Forest
and UNC. All but one of Davidson’s female runners recorded their best time of the season.

HOMECOMING AT DAVIDSON: METHODIST 19; WILDCATS 16
Wildcat secondary poses primary problems

By MICHAEL J. KRUSE
Editor in Chief

After playing reasonably well in the first two games of the season — both resounding Wildcat wins — Davidson’s secondary
has had some FOOTBALL Notebook problems in its last four outings.

Three weeks ago against Guilford in Greensboro, the Quakers’ potent pass-catching duo of Junior Lord and William Rochelle shredded the
Wildcats’ defense for a combined 23 catches for 316 yards. And things haven’t gotten much better since.

Against Methodist Saturday, Monarch quarterback Brian Turner made good on 13 of 21 pass attempts for 264 yards, and connected
with receivers Leonard Bellamy, William Ray, and David Foster for completions of 48, 41, and 24 yards. Bellamy was Turner’s
favorite target, hauling in eight balls for an astounding 153 yards. The 6-foot senior wide receiver caught the 26-yard touchdown
pass with 1:16 to go that gave the Monarchs the victory.

“We've got good guys back there (in the secondary),” coach Tim Landis said. “We gave up some big plays. I’m
sure we'll get better and we've got to continue to work on it.

“They haven't really had to throw against anybody they’ve played against. They just kind of ran the ball on people
and hadn't really been challenged. And we made them throw the football — that was our game plan. They threw
it and made some big plays. We just got beat on a couple big plays.”

Parvin continues to impress

Jeremiah Parvin, a 6-foot, 185-pound freshman, averaged 41 yards on five punts Saturday against the Monarchs. The rookie with the
big boot provides something the Wildcats have not had in recent seasons — a punter with a consistently booming foot.

“Jeremiah’s been punting the ball awful well,” Landis explained. “He brings us something we haven’t had in the past. We’re
real excited about him. He’s been playing good on defense as well, and he’s running down and covering kickoffs. So
he’s having a good year.”

Tailback Nate Hagerman had his first real strong showing of the season. The 5-foot-10 junior, who is pound-for-pound one of
the strongest players on the Wildcat roster, compiled 44 yards on 10 carries against Methodist, including an 18-yarder. Quarterback Tommy
Dugan suffered what Landis called a sprained ankle midway through the first quarter. Before the injury, Dugan did not complete
a pass in seven tries and threw an interception. “We'll just have to see how it is,” the coach said.
“Hopefully there’s nothing broken. I think it'll be day-to-day this week.” Backup Matt Strader saw his most significant action of
the season, going 8-for-15 through the air for 78 yards and running nine times for minus-23 yards.

Henderson, Ariail lead tackle parade

Rookie standout defensive lineman Bo Henderson and Shreve Ariail, the Wildcats’ stalwart at middle linebacker, shared the team lead in
tackles Saturday, each registering 11 takedowns. Freeman Belser, another freshman, and Chris Frederick each pitched in eight, while Chris Hess
and Marcus Williams had six apiece. Four Wildcats had sacks — Henderson, Belser, Andre Carelock, and Ben Spivey. Henderson and
Williams also recovered fumbles. Brian Langley, after making his first four field goal attempts of the season, has missed his
last three. The junior placekicker, who is still flawless on extra points this fall, missed one last week at Washington
& Lee, and muffed 37- and 27-yard attempts Saturday versus the Monarchs.

“Obviously, I think the wet turf played into it a little bit,” Landis said. “But knowing Brian, the way he
is, he certainly wouldn’t want to use that as an excuse. He’s had a tremendous season, and I know he’ll
bounce back.”

Wildcats’ upset bid falls short, as Methodist wins

Wildcats frustrated by W&L

LEXINGTON, Va. — Washington and Lee scored 22 unanswered points in a six-minute stretch spanning the second and third quarters,
as the Generals earned a 32-22 victory over the slumping Wildcats in front of a Homecoming crowd of 4,000 on
Oct. 11.

"But we feel like we run the ball pretty well.” But Methodist came right back with two touchdowns to take
a 13-9 lead on runs by DeCarlos West and Marcus Reaves, and things weren’t looking good for the Wildcats early
in the fourth quarter. Davidson trailed by three and Methodist had the ball with five minutes remaining. A defensive stop
was needed to assure any chance at victory — and the Wildcats rose to the occasion, holding the Monarchs to
three plays for seven yards and forcing a punt. The punt was then blocked by Chad Wright and recovered by
rookie Ryan Crawford, who took it seven yards for the dramatic go-ahead touchdown.

Matt Strader looks to pitch the ball in Saturday’s game. Strader replaced Tommy Dugan, who suffered a sprained ankle in
the first half. Bill Giduz for the winning touchdown, spoiling what, for a minute, looked like a Davidson win for
sure. Four weeks in a row now, the Wildcats have entered the fourth quarter with a good chance of winning.
And four weeks in a row, the ball hasn’t bounced their way.

“These guys are working hard and getting after it,” said coach Landis. “I think today’s game will be a valuable
lesson for us, and that given this opportunity again we will come out with the win. I thought it was
a tremendous effort against a good, solid football team who has aspirations for the national playoffs.”

Saturday at Randolph-Macon 1:30 * Day Field * Ashland, Va.

Coach: Scott Boone
Current Record: 4-0 (including this weekend)
Last Year's Record: 7-3
Last Meeting: Oct. 26, 2006 — Randolph-Macon, 31-24 (at Ashland, Va.)

Players to Watch: Sidney Chappell (Sr., QB, 6-1, 175), Neal Ferguson (Sr., RB, 5-11, 215), Michael Hurt (Sr., RB/WR, 6-0,
175), Joe Seetoo (Sr., DB, 5-9, 180), Chuck Davis (Jr., DL, 6-3, 265)

Notes: Seven offensive starters return from last year, including first-team All-Old Dominion Athletic Conference quarterback Sidney Chappell. Chappell led the
team in both rushing (566 yards) as a junior. Also returning to the offense is first-team all-ODAC running back Neal
Ferguson. Randolph-Macon returns its top six rushers, top two passers, and top five receivers this season. Explosive running back/receiver/kick returner
Michael Hurt and top wideout Francel Smith make the Yellow Jacket backfield one of the most dangerous in the ODAC.
Hurt was one of three RMC players to earn first-team all-state honors last season. This year's defensive squad returns seven
starters and is led by all-conference recipients Joe Seetoo and Chuck Davis, who ranked second and third, respectively, on the
team in tackles last season.

Jack Morse here at Wilson Field. The 10-point decision marked W&L’s first win over the Wildcats and Davidson's third straight
loss after a promising 2-0 start. Generals quarterback Christian Batcheller completed 18 of 28 passes for 288 yards and four
touchdowns, tying a school record for scoring tosses in a game. The sophomore signal-caller, a high school teammate of Davidson
tight end Wes Jones at Patrick (Va.) County, bombarded a soft Wildcat secondary with passes over the middle. That, in
part, helped W&L overcome a 14-3 deficit midway through the second quarter and race to the upset.

For the Wildcats, Tommy Dugan once again sparked the offense, rushing for a touchdown and throwing for another. Running what
has often been an unstoppable option attack so far this season, Dugan led the squad with 101 yards on the
ground. He added 185 aerial yards on 15-for-30 passing. Fullback Eric Ferguson scored two touchdowns and Eric Sapp paced all
receivers with eight catches for 103 yards.
