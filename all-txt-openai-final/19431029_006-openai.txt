Page Six; THE DAVIDSONIAN Friday, October 23, 1943

Our Team

by JOHN ASHE

Coach Gene McEver, with characteristic skill and initiative, has whipped into shape a scrappy Wildcat squad. This squad, which is composed mainly of freshmen, would be found in the grandstand and not on the gridiron during peacetime conditions. However, possessed with patriotism for their college and a determination to keep a football team at Davidson, these men reported for practice with a keen will to learn.

Knowing that they lacked many of the qualities that have been characteristic of Davidson football players in the past, they have worked diligently and for long hours with the hope that they could form a football team that would lead every Davidson man to be justly proud of and to “Back the Cats.”
