**Terry axes water fights, saves Nichols headaches**

“It’s a great way to meet dowsing with bucketsful of air. Fortunately, get old fast. And what...”

The sound of tromping feet echoed up the darkened stairwell. The second-floor landing was reached, the door burst open, Kamikaze screams accompanied a blitzkrieg charge down the hallway. Doors slam shut, towels hastily shoved beneath them. Frantic efforts to hide from the coming onslaught. And then... the water. Bucketsful, trashcansful, containers of all sizes and shapes, anything which could be recruited by the attackers to carry their wet cargo. The assembly, the attack; then, the retreat into the night, leaving a sloshing hall full of the drippingly exhausted, the victims of the oft-renowned water fight.

Since the early 1960s, water fighting has been a Davidson tradition. Before that, such incidents were apparently much less frequent, though not so infrequent as to make unnecessary the inclusion of the following passage in the D.C. rules and regulations handbook:

“The defacing or damaging of the property of others or the taking part in any procedure from which damage is the natural result is treated as a serious offense and may result in exclusion from the campus or from the college. Representative of such procedures are the throwing of water, the throwing of objects at windows, the stoppage of drains, the flooding of dormitory floors....”

This message appeared in the handbook through the academic year 1967-68.

In the late 1950s, water fighting had really emerged as a campus staple. At that time, it was allowed by the Administration as an accepted means of relieving tension and having a good time. During the course of the 1960s and early 1970s, water fighting came to be recognized as the principal cause of several significant problems. It was this which caused the Administration to tighten up their policy on water fights. They changed their attitude from one of benign neglect to one determined to see the elimination of water fights as a traditional campus activity.

College procedure, as it now stands, is to impose a fine of $25 for the first offense, $50 for the second, and so on, advancing in increments of $25. The goal is to discourage water fights, and, through repeated discouragement, to effectively eliminate them.

Dean of Students Will Terry explained that there are two reasons for this policy. The first, and most important, is to remove from students’ minds the possible impression that the Administration's attitude is one of benign neglect.

A few years ago, Davidson experienced a two-year wave of vandalism. While not all of this vandalism had to do with the dorms, much of it did. After tracing the careers of the vandals (who were mostly seniors), it was discovered that their troubles had begun on their freshman halls (which were the most destructive on campus). “This, then, was partly our fault,” said Terry. “By allowing such occurrences as water fights to progress, we were in effect condoning them. If water fights were allowed, then, many felt, anything was allowed.” When asked whether there was a causal link between the water fights and the vandalism, Terry replied, “Yes.”

The second reason has to do with the direct damage caused by water fights. Water fights became a tradition in the early ’60s and the dorms are showing the effect. A third reason that the policy towards water fights has changed is that in most cases the halls involved will not take the responsibility for cleaning the hall up. “The janitors don’t like to clean it up,” Terry said. Supervisor of Custodians Tom Conner agrees: “Water fights? They’re pretty #!?7¢*!.”

“I used to think that water fights had some therapeutic value,” said Terry. “I think they may still.” Outside, water fights are fine. However, for the reasons above, water fights indoors are not worth the trouble. “We’re trying to stop the tradition,” he explained.

The majority of those students interviewed seem to agree with the present water fight policy. In fact, some took an even more conservative viewpoint, citing potential bodily harm as another reason for prohibiting water fights. The majority of this year’s Hall Counselors are taking water fights and their potential disadvantages very seriously. This is a reflection of the position adopted by the Administration. This year’s freshmen have been told “No water fights.” Many feel that they are not worth the cost; others fear the potential damage. Some, however, disagree. First Richardson's Bobby Ervin, the veteran of one water fight, said, “I've enjoyed it.” Many upperclassmen agree, claiming release from tension, a boost for hall spirit, and the opportunity to meet new people.people as water fighting's chief advantages. "Freshman girls," said one Fourth Sentellean. A sophomore from Fourth Belk added, "They’re better than panty raids." However, most do recognize the danger, and almost all mentioned outdoor water fights as a possible safe alternative. Sophomore David Huie suggested inter-hall water fight skirmishes, arranged spontaneously and held outdoors. Spontaneity was considered the prime requisite for a successful water fight; as Huie points out, spontaneity is not exclusively restricted to indoor water fights. Huie also felt sexual repression to be among the fights. Freshman Advisor Doug Horn expressed agreement with the Administration’s stand; this, however, did not mean, for him, the end of the road. Davidson students have always shown themselves capable of finding new means of relieving tension. So, as Second Belk’s Richard Terry said, “Maybe it’s up to us to find something more ingenious to replace it.” First Watts may, in fact, have already come up with at least a temporary solution: the fake water fight. Cannon dorm was the first victim of this new form of attack, receiving a thorough soaking.

The Charlotte Observer staff is "a lot of good people trying to get the best news coverage and the most interesting newspaper," commented Professor of English Gil Holland. He was one of eight Davidson professors who recently got an inside look at the workings of the Observer. The half-day visit, coordinated by Director of News and Photography Buck Lawrimore, was one of many that the Observer has held recently. The session with the Davidson professors, however, was one of the lengthiest. The faculty members met the Metro news staff for a long lunch, toured the office for a look at the new copy flow system, and attended an actual staff conference meeting. There they observed as the editors decided which articles to run and budgeted actual page space. The professors were encouraged to comment on both the content of the paper and the method of selecting and presenting stories. Professor of Sociology Norman Koller, one of the attending professors, was "very impressed by that kind of openness."

First and foremost, the faculty members were impressed with the news wire service. The news wire service, for example, is extensive. The Observer receives wire reports from an unusually large number of news services. They choose only a fraction of these stories to use. "It brings up the whole question of ‘What is news?’," commented Professor of Religion Alex McKelway, one of the professors who participated. Professor of Physics Locke White, Jr., was struck by the way the Observer follows through on these wire reports. "They say they do an immense amount of work with their wire reports," White said. Apparently, the attitude is not just to accept a report as complete in itself, but rather to use the wire information as a lead to obtain additional information. Ironically, one of the common complaints by professors was that the Observer doesn’t give enough in-depth information on stories. "Every now and then it would be nice to read a story in the Observer that I wouldn’t understand," commented McKelway. In-depth stories with scientific or technical explanations are few and far between. Professor of Humanities Pat Edmondson, who also attended, expressed surprise about the "constraints in terms of time, space, and balance" that the editors must wrestle with. The Observer staff realizes that the average reader has only a high-school diploma and spends 15 minutes a day reading the paper. "So they aim for a smorgasbord," Edmondson explained. Professor of Mathematics Ben Klein said that the editors see the paper as "a sort of supermarket." He conceded that before the visit he never realized how much the editors’ hands are tied in terms of space. The resulting arrangement, Klein said, is "maybe not how I would allocate space in order to read, but they were writing in terms of what would sell." This concern for sales has resulted in the targeting of various geographical areas. Klein called it a "conscious decision to emphasize the news of the Carolinas specifically and of the Southeast more generally." Professor of Speech Jean Cornell believes the Observer has always done a good job on local coverage.
