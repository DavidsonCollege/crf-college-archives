11 - BB: Free Speech Assassinated in Coup

Like a dog on the front porch of the SPE house, free speech has died an untimely death here at Davidson College. The editors of The Davidsonian have decided to eliminate the Booze Brothers column due to several complaints and one threatened lawsuit. The lawsuit was threatened after an item in last week’s BB called a certain group of individuals “Will’s Boys.” (That would probably hold up in court — since when is it libelous to be called a friend of the administration? One would think that it would be desirable to be on the Dean’s good side.)

The Booze Brothers have taken a survey of the Davidson student body and found that 99 percent of the material in our column is funny — the other one percent, of course, is material in which your name is mentioned. Oh well, joke you if you can’t take a screw. (Credit that to Robin Williams — you’ll not snare me on a plagiarism charge!)

On a lighter note, the 40 Days to Fitness Boys (down to three participants following the failure of young Ivey) go off training at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, April 29. We'll be having a BYOB party at an as yet undisclosed location. Y’all come... Everybody but Johnny Mod (who, we understand, will be taking GRE’s) is going to Chapel Thrill tomorrow...

If you're really pissed about the cancellation of BB, write to Save BB, c/o The Davidsonian, Box 218, Davidson, NC 28036; or, if you’re really concerned about our well-being, send your contribution to Save BB, P.O. Box 3011, Davidson, NC 28036... We hope somebody’s stupid enough to send money to us... For the last time ever, shalom!

Editors’ note: For those of you mourning the death of BB, all hope is not lost. We are now soliciting new humor columns. We will read anything, but we would prefer a column that has fewer personal attacks. Send your submissions to The Davidsonian, Box 218, or call extensions 148 or 149.
