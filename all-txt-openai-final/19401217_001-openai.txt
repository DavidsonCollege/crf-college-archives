DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N. C., THURSDAY, DECEMBER 17, 1940. Number 12

Paragraphies By THE EDITOR

Council has signing of Will the Pan-Hellenic now ed the Bradley, which seems to suit the majority of the students
well, after listening to various “sessions” on dance band preferences. After so long the Council has gotten us a band
we like, which is fine. Thanks to the Council, and may it continue.

Our dances should rate with those at other schools, just as everything else does.

Exam schedule also appears this week, which should cause “consternation-in-the-ranks.” As usual, the majority will have an exam the first
and last day with two on one day in between.

Because of the brevity and the fact that it was the last issue before the holidays, the staff is publishing
but four pages in this issue. The paper was organized on Thursday night, and a great deal of credit is
due to the entire cast and operating staff. The whole thing had that “professional touch,” and should raise the status
of the Masquers considerably.

The entire staff joins in wishing the student body, the faculty, and the college administration and staff a very happy
Christmas and a prosperous New Year.

Vosburgh and the theater pulled a scoop on us in the announcement of the free ticket to be given each
week. It's a fine idea, especially to the lucky man.

Jim Ho really racked up the points on Thursday night, leaving a record. He also cracked the team record with
the final score of 18 to 1.

We like the upperclass review schedule much better than that of the freshmen and sophomores. Many upperclassmen have about one
every week, with no concentration such as underclassmen get when they have all their reviews within such a short period.
It seems much better to spread them a week apart, instead of cramming all into a week which causes two
to fall on the same day many times.

WILL BRADLEY TO PLAY FOR MID-WINTER DANCES

MCA Ends Drive For Christmas Fund

“Margin for Error” went over big with the boys, and the entire cast and operating staff deserve a great deal
of credit. The whole thing had that “professional touch,” and should raise the status of the Masquers considerably.

The YMCA drive for the Christmas Fund, which began last Thursday and closed Monday night, had as its goal the
collection of $1,000 in pledges from members of the student body. Pledges were signed now will not be called for
until sometime in the early part of the second semester.
