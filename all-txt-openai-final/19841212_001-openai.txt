#### Task Force Identifies Problems And Sets Goals

By DAVID McGEE

The Presidential Task Force on Racial/Ethnic Concerns last week released its report that calls for broad changes and development of
Davidson’s policy toward minorities. The report proposes a policy statement for the College to pursue, discusses current strategies and policies
here, and explores successful policies of schools similar to Davidson. The task force’s report is not complete, however.

Before the task force submits its report to President John Kuykendall, it will seek suggestions from the Davidson community in
two forums.

Faculty are invited to a forum Jan. 9, and students are asked to attend another forum the following day.

“We are looking forward to these forums,” co-chairman John Griffith said. The task force hopes, he said, that students will
attend the forums after studying the report in order to facilitate more meaningful discussion.

According to the report's policy statement, “[u]nder the leadership of the President, with participation of faculty and administration, and where
appropriate, alumni and students, reasonable and attainable goals and strategies for the implementation of this policy will be developed. For
the immediate future, the goals and strategies will focus on blacks. The administration will evaluate progress on a regular basis,
and will report to the Board of Trustees.”

Policy recommendations include seeking Trustees, faculty, staff, and students of various racial/ethnic heritages and enriching the academic program here with
the contributions and experiences of racial/ethnic groups.

Other goals would foster a community supportive and responsive to all races, minimize the attrition among Davidson minorities, and involve
more fully black and other minority students in the life of the College.

#### SGA Reschedules Elections

By TED WILSON

In a special meeting Monday night, the SGA Senate voted 22-1 to suspend the by-laws and reopen the sign-ups and
elections for Union, Davidsonian, Y-Corps, Miscellany, and Wildcat Handbook offices. Sign-ups now will run from Dec. 11 until Jan. 8
in the Deans’ office, and elections will be held Jan. 15.

The meeting was held to determine whether the Elections Committee had adequately publicized the sign-up deadline. Junior Rob Vaughn claimed
the committee had not.

Vaughn, who failed to meet the deadline, said “the Election Committee is responsible for adequately publicizing the election,” which includes
using two campus media, and indicating deadlines and eligibility requirements. He argued that the committee failed to publicize the event
adequately.

At the beginning of the meeting, SGA president John Laughlin said a two-thirds vote of the Senate was required to
suspend the by-laws which mandate that the election sign-up deadline is the second week of December.

#### Davidson Names New Athletic Director

By LEE WHITE

Davidson last week selected Kit Morris as the new Athletic Director. He will assume his duties Jan. 1. Morris comes
to Davidson from Yale University. At Yale, Morris was associate director of athletics for varsity sports.

During his three years there, Morris coordinated a 33-team Division I program with an operating budget of $2.5 million. Morris
served with Yale’s Berkeley College as a resident fellow.

The selection of Morris ends a search begun last May when former Athletic Director Ed Farrell resigned the position to
devote his efforts to coaching football. Farrell held the post until last October when tennis coach Jeff Frank, field hockey
coach Pat Daly, and Physical Education Director Sterling Martin took on the director’s duties up to the selection of a
new athletic director.

Prior to his years at Yale, Morris was assistant to the director of athletics at Harvard from 1978 to 1981.
In addition, during the summer of 1981 he served as dean of students for Harvard's summer school.

Morris, a native of Jackson, Miss., received a bachelor of arts degree with concentration in English, history and government from
Harvard in 1974. He earned a master’s degree in education from Harvard in 1978.

#### College Surveys Students, Gathers Data For Self-Study

By DAVID VAN PELT

The SGA and faculty self-study committees are currently compiling student, faculty, and departmental reports for use in the College’s self-study
project.

The SGA distributed three different surveys to random student samples according to President John Laughlin. “We've had a high rate
of return,” Laughlin said. “It should make our findings statistically valid.” Laughlin hopes to have all student surveys collected by
Friday.

The samples, which were distributed to 200 students each, will form the bulk of the SGA self-study report to be
completed by the end of January.

Laughlin said surveys were designed to discover “any glaring weaknesses that students perceive in the College,” adding that the final
SGA report will serve as a reference for faculty committees in their own self-study projects.

The SGA formed three committees to distribute the surveys and organize the self-study report, according to Laughlin. The student activities
committee, chaired by sophomore Mickey McDonald, covers extra-curricular events, such as Patterson Court, intercollegiate and intramural sports, and religious life.

Senior Will Cardwell chairs the student services and Physical Resources committee, which deals with such areas as student housing, the
infirmary, and financial aid. Junior Anne Lambert chairs the Government and Academic Concerns committee, which includes curriculum and the SGA.

“Much of what we have done so far is gather information,” said psychology Professor John Kelton, Chairman of the faculty
self-study steering committee. The faculty self-study project consists of
