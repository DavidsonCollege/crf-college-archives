AN INTERESTING BIT OF HISTORY

In Meriwether’s “Life of Raphael Semmes,” recently added to the American Biographies in the Library, is a brief account of his capture and burning of the “Jabez Snow” in Brazilian waters. The students of Davidson have an interest in this incident, due to the fact that Mr. Hill, superintendent of grounds, was a “boy before the mast” on this luckless coal ship which encountered the great Confederate seaman at the mouth of the Amazon. The cargo and provisions for two years were transferred to the Alabama, the members of the crew were put in irons, but the captain, mate, stewards, and, as Mr. Hill says, “we three boys” were given the freedom of the ship. He remained on board the Alabama for about two weeks, at the end of which time he and the other prisoners were transferred to a Dutch ship, which carried them to Rio de Janeiro and put them under the protection of the American consulate there. From Rio de Janeiro, Mr. Hill came to Philadelphia, and has lived practically ever since in the United States. It is interesting to note that he has visited Africa, South America, and Central America since he came to this country.

The diploma hanging on the wall in the reading room and bearing the name of Daniel B. Wood is of peculiar interest to the student body at present. This diploma bears the date of July 27, 1840, and the signature of Samuel Williamson as president. This alumnus of the college was in the first Freshman class in Davidson and was in the second class that graduated. His grandson, J. K. Fleming ('19), is in our student body.

See J. H. CARSON, our Davidson representative—he'll put you “next” to the nifty kind.

A few days ago the whole school, except the first grade, was favored with a talk by Dr. Bolling Hobson, on “Teeth and the Care of Them.”

On Saturday afternoon an interesting game of basketball was played between the girls of Davidson and Cornelius, at the latter place. The Davidson team, while smaller than their opponents and handicapped by lack of experience, played an aggressive game, but succumbed 11 to 2.

On Monday afternoon from 2:30 to 7:00, about thirty Davidson men enjoyed a dance given at the Country Club, to Charlotte. Many of the ladies who were at Junior Speaking attended, and in addition to the Davidson assemblage, there were a number from Charlotte. The Academy Orchestra furnished some very good music for the occasion.
