PAGE SIX THE DAVIDSONIAN FRIDAY, OCTOBER 15, 1948

Back in the old days of Davidson student's life, there was a row of wooden privies in the rear of
the Old Chambers Building. One of the events of the year, when the students got the mob spirit, was the
burning of “the bushes.” Pine lumber made a great fire.

It is estimated that each Davidson student uses about one hundred gallons of water per day. Back in the former
days of Davidson, this amount would have lasted a student for several weeks—using the old pail method.

Back in 1889 the students of Davidson, believing President Shearer responsible for the suspension of two popular students from the
college for two weeks for going to Charlotte without his permission, burned him in effigy on his lawn.

Dr. Foreman, former Davidson professor, was recently selected by the International Council of Religious Education to write the weekly International
Uniform Sunday School lesson, which is copyrighted on behalf of 40 Protestant denominations. He succeeds Dr. Louis Newton, noted clergyman,
in writing the column which goes to 1,600 weekly newspapers and is released by WNU Features.

At present, Dr. Foreman fills the chair of Doctrinal Theology at Louisville Theological Seminary, Louisville, Kentucky. A member of the
class of 1911, he served here from 1922 until 1947 when he left to accept his present position. While at
Davidson he was considered to be one of the outstanding professors.

The “D” Club is made up of those who have earned a “D” in any sport here at Davidson. It
was stated that this year’s Follies will be presented in the Spring, though the exact date has not yet been
set.

Another meeting of the club was held Wednesday morning.

Dr. Lindquist’s addresses on the final day told of the universal violence in the world and how only that one
linked to God by faith in Christ can possibly deal with it. He emphasized that the main theme from Genesis
to Revelations is that God loves. Dr. Lindquist stated that man can only come through the world unshaken by practicing
the spiritual strategic points of nearness to Christ; second, absorption in the revealed or understood things of life. From these
two lists, the speaker pointed out three great truths: “God understands the mysteries of life,” “God loves,” and “God lifts.”
If you live and love, you must do something about it, and God most certainly will.

Prof. Beaty Speaks

After Dr. Cunningham outlined the program, Professor Beaty delivered a brilliant oratory and exhorted the students to practice the spiritual
strategic points outlined by Dr. Lindquist.Student influence someone the wrong way, as a tudent net I tion f is. hire
