Love Secret #1

DIFFERENT PEOPLE MEAN DIFFERENT THINGS AT DIFFERENT TIMES WHEN THEY USE THE WORD LOVE. BEWARE

GUIDE TO WHAT'S YOUR LOVE PROBLEM?

LOVE IS CONFUSED

BUY AN EXPERT

MAYBE YOUR PROBLEM IS THAT LOVE IS AN ILLUSION. LET'S LISTEN TO ONE EXPERIENCED SCIENTIST OF LOVE:

"Love is just a simple-minded little..."

CHAPTER I:

COME ON, ADMIT IT. YOU HAVE A PROBLEM. WELL, I'M NOT SURE I REALLY, LIKE, HAVE A PROBLEM.

OW, COME OFF IT. LOOK AROUND YOU, WHAT DO YOU SEE? HAPPY SMILING, NUZZLING, GROPING COUPLES FEEDING EACH OTHER GRAPES,
GAGGING IN THE RAIN, TALKING BABY TALK, GAZING INTO EACH OTHER'S EYES, RAMMING EACH OTHER JOYFULLY IN BUMPER CARS, GRABBING
EACH OTHER'S THIGHS UNDER THE CAFE TABLE WHEN THEY THINK NO ONE'S LOOKING...

LOVE IS A EUPHEMISM FOR A GRAB-BAG OF PRIMITIVE SEXUAL IMPULSES, UNRELENTING NEEDINESS, NEUROTIC ANXIETY, AND BRAIN-SQUEEZING SOCIAL PRESSURE. YOU'RE
PUSHED TO COUPLE WITH YOUR SO-CALLED SOUL-MATE WITH ALL THE POTENCY AND RAPTURE OF TWO SEA SLUGS ENCOUNTERING EACH OTHER
ON THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN. AND I SAY THIS BECAUSE MY GIRLFRIEND DUMPED ME THREE WEEKS AGO.

AND THERE YOU SIT, ALONE, SURROUNDED BY FRIENDS AND WELL-WISHERS...

CAN YOU SPOT YOURSELF IN THIS PICTURE?

GOD, YOU'RE ONE UP GROUNDS EATING AWAY AT YOUR HATEFUL LIME LIFE.

CHECK ANY OR ALL BOXES THAT DESCRIBE YOUR MENTAL STATE. THERE ARE NO RIGHT OR WRONG ANSWERS...

LOVE IS PROFOUND ECSTASY. LOVE IS PROFOUND SUFFERING. LOVE IS MAGIC. LOVE IS A TRICK. LOVE IS THE GREATEST THING
IN LIFE. LOVE IS A CURSE. LOVE IS AN ADDICTION. LOVE IS THE BEST. LOVE IS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE
STRUGGLE TOWARD SELF-FULFILLMENT. LOVE IS NEVER HAVING TO SAY YOU'RE SORRY. LOVE IS ALWAYS HAVING TO SAY YOU'RE SORRY. LOVE
IS REAL. LOVE IS AN ILLUSION. LOVE IS A DREAM. LOVE IS A NIGHTMARE.

MAYBE YOU SHOULD GO HOME AND WATCH TV UNTIL YOU PASS OUT AT 2 AM... OR MAYBE YOU SHOULD TAKE
CONTROL OF YOUR LIFE AND GRAB SOME OF THAT LOVE FOR YOURSELF.

Love Secret #2

HE MAY BE RIGHT, BUT DON'T GIVE UP.
