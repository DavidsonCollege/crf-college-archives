### Students, Townspeople Walk to Fight Hunger in the Crop Walk

By Jeff Fuller

For most Americans, not having enough food is hardly ever a concern. Davidson students most likely have their meals at
Vail Commons or their houses without thinking of what it must be like to live in a country where hunger
is a definite problem. However, Davidson does have several opportunities for students to learn about and fight against hunger.

CROP, Christian Rural Overseas Program, holds CROP lunches every second and fourth Wednesday of the month in the 900 room
from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. The meal usually consists of corn bread, beans, and rice to symbolize a meal
one might be fortunate enough to eat in a famine-stricken country.

The meal is accompanied by a video or discussion, and students are encouraged to donate two to three dollars. The
next CROP lunch will be held on October 13.

On October 10, CROP is holding a CROP walk beginning at the Village Green, at the corner of Concord and
Main, at 1:30 p.m. Money will be raised by participants who will solicit pledges.

Twenty-five percent of this money will go to help Mecklenburg County, especially the Senior Center which will receive a considerable
portion of that money. The rest of the money will go to needy nations like Bangladesh, India, and Somalia, and
a gift package will be sent to Midwest flood victims.

The first CROP walk was held in Bismarck, North Dakota in 1969, and since then the number of walks has
grown to about 1,800 per year involving 3.17 million people as participants and sponsors.

Davidson’s CROP coordinator Lisa Sitek would like to encourage Davidson College students to participate in the CROP walk or sponsor
a participant. “I would like to see us raise over $500 and get over 100 students [to walk],” she said,
describing her goals for this year’s walk.

She also hopes people will realize that participating in the CROP walk is a short time commitment and “it’s really
not that hard.” People are also needed to work rest stops during the walk. If interested in participating in the
CROP walk as a walker you can pick up sponsor forms on the Union Pit desk or from a CROP
walk recruiter.

### Some Random Sports Thoughts

Nips continued from page 15

five-yard line.

* Please stay off the referees’ backs during flickerball games. We have witnessed some awful treatment and these people deserve
better. Remember that except for Judy, these referees are students. Maybe you should criticize yourself as a player before criticizing
others around you. We would also like to see more campus-wide involvement. For the season, there have been way too
many forfeits.

* This upcoming Saturday there is the annual 100-inning softball game at Moore’s field in Mooresville. The game starts at
six in the morning and runs until eight that night. We hope that professors and students come to play about
twenty innings. We plan to continue the tradition and play the full 100 innings.

* We especially like the climbing wall in Johnston gym. If you haven’t gone you need to visit during the
hours of seven until nine, Monday through Thursday. Go bug Charlie Blake.

Some real random thoughts:
* Las Vegas v. Duke in the 1991 NCAA basketball championship was definitely a fix. No question.
* Lennox Lewis should be fighting Riddick Bowe before Evander Holyfield gets his rematch.
