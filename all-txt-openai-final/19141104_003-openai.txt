TENNIS TEAM WINS.

WEATHERWAX BROTHERS’ QUARTET. The Weatherwax Brothers’ first public work was in the fall of 1896 when they sang throughout northern Iowa in the notable McKinley campaign. They made such a hit everywhere that there was an immediate demand for them to do other public work. This quartet, in addition to regular music, also performs as a trumpet quartet.Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

---

The Davidson tennis team, composed of Crawford and Johnson, are again victors in intercollegiate tennis. This time the victory was over Elon College. The Davidson team, arriving at Elon a little late, was rushed immediately to the tennis court. The match opened with Elon copping game after game in the first set. Davidson, however, soon became accustomed to the new court, fed seven straight games, winning the match in straight sets, 6-4, 6-0, 6-1. The feature of the match was the hard smashing game waged by both Crawford and Johnson. Rushing quickly to the net after each serve, they met each return with a hard smash, completely disconcerting Elon’s team. Davidson will play Guilford next at Guilford, and Trinity and Carolina on her home court, probably in the Spring.

ILLUSTRATED LECTURE.

At the regular mid-week prayer meeting service, which will be held in Shearer Hall at 8 o'clock tonight, Rev. Philip Sidersky, a Christian Jew, who has been engaged for some time in special evangelistic work among the people of his nationality in Baltimore and other large Eastern cities, will give an illustrated lecture on “Israel Among the Nations.” The members of the church, the people of the town, and the student body are cordially invited to attend this lecture. The success which has crowned Mr. Sidersky's labors among the people of the “Nation without a country” should enable him to give a most interesting and profitable address.

WEATHERWAX BROTHERS.

Trumpets are comparatively seldom used on the Lyceum platform, and it is a treat to hear them when well played. The trumpets which they made a specialty for this use were perfect. As to their vocal work, all four brothers have fine voices and have had years of practice together, which has resulted in most excellent harmony. They have all been natural musicians from their infancy, and as someone has truly said, “Their voices have a decided family blend.” A unique feature of this organization is that there are two readers in the company.

Carolina—The first issue of the Carolina Magazine came out last week. It contained a number of splendid articles.

NEWS WITH OTHER COLLEGES.

Clemson—Fifteen hundred football followers saw Clemson defeat Citadel 15 to 0. The touchdowns occurred in the second and third periods. The game was very interesting and hard-fought, the strongest men being James and Coggins for Citadel, Webb and Schillette for Clemson.
