#### Coach Hussey Gives Some Insights into Davidson Basketball - Greiner, Iordanou

Walk into any athletic department and ask the director (the grave man behind the massive desk) what it takes to field a winning team in college sports today and he’ll have the answer quicker than Greek’s knee goes up on a save. He will undoubtedly reply “Money.” Money, money, money; the sure way to win. Buy players, buy coaches. Hell, buy everything! The college sports scene is truly capitalistic with one unrecognized exception: the Davidson soccer team.

In 1977 the team was 0-16. This year Charlie Slagle piloted the team to a 13-9 overall record with a 6-2 Southern Conference record good enough for second place. But here’s the amazing thing. The team did all this with nary a scholarship nor a real increase in budget. Clearly, the team wins on heart and sheer love for the game, not superior talent.

Much of the credit goes to second-year coach Charlie Slagle. Don’t think we’re the only ones noticing all this, either. Slagle was chosen Southern Conference Coach of the Year. His enthusiasm for the team greatly influenced its performance.

Coaching alone does not produce winning teams, however. The 1981 edition of Wildcat Soccer was laden with talent in several key areas, especially defense. Senior goalkeeper Mike “Greek” Iordanou earned first-team All-Conference honors for his steady play in the cage, and senior sweeper Terry Greiner made the second team. Dan Blood and Brian Hamilton played stellar defense as well, but the All-SC voters neglected them.

On offense, sophomore Chris Roberts was again the crucial cog in the Davidson machine as he tallied 10 goals and 7 assists for first-team honors. Senior Chuck Price and sophomore Peter Burr were offensive keys as well.

The team has an even tougher schedule next season, with several top teams coming to Davidson. The Wildcats will have SC power Appalachian State in their sights, and if they gun down the Apps, they’ll be looking for first place.

### Girls Look Forward to Division II Braggin’ Rights Against Meredith

The old coaches’ adage goes, “You play the way you practice,” but the women’s basketball team is having a hard time living up to it. They’re not doing in games the things they’re doing in practice, and the UNC-G team proved themselves rather unwelcome guests as they walked off with a decisive 67-40 win.

The Greensboro defense was very aggressive—a little too aggressive in fact as they continuously harassed the Davidson guards with a very physical game in the backcourt. Although this didn’t help the Cats any, it certainly didn’t decide the game. Davidson did very little to support its own cause. They simply couldn’t generate any offense and suffered numerous defensive lapses.

Credit must be given, though, to a good Greensboro team. The visitors had outstanding scoring threats, both inside and outside, who seemed at times to be unable to miss.

Coach Mayes shared her feelings about the game, “The UNCG game was perhaps our most disappointing one so far this year. The players didn’t do what was expected of them on offense. Instead of being disciplined and running the plays the way they do in practice, they started to play a game of free-lance. Without meaning to, they started to play as individuals, each trying to win the game themselves, instead of playing as a unit of five. Defensively, there was simply too little communication. This allowed UNCG to score a lot of points from the inside.”

Both Coach Mayes and Coach Boyer said, “Despite the team’s record and the disappointments of the last game, this year’s team has definitely improved over last year’s. And even though it’s difficult because of our record, the players have kept a good attitude, and the outlook for the rest of the season is still a positive one.”

The Lady Cats have one of their biggest games of the season coming up at home this Tuesday, January 26, at 7:00 P.M., against Meredith, their only other Division III competition in the State.
