IMAC Basketball: 50 Teams Take To The Courts
By HUNTER GOURLEY

IMAC’ers abandoned the flickerball fields and headed south for the winter — to the basketball courts inside Johnston Gym. The
1984 IMAC basketball season got underway in early December. And basketball, probably a more familiar pastime for most sportsters than
flickerball, met with a big turnout. These sports enthusiasts included jocks, ex-jocks, former junior and high school standouts, mere role
players, unhappy bench warmers, weight watchers, and assorted pot-bellied and balloon-bottomed hacks — enough people at least to field some
fifty teams. That’s nine women’s basketball teams, nine men’s A-league teams, and a whopping 32-team, five-division men’s B-league.

In the brief post-Thanksgiving 1984 half of the season, 34 games were frantically played in the vain attempt to beat
the inevitable onslaught of before-holiday testing and paper-writing.

Women’s League Games
Rusk opened the season with a convincing win over a freshman team, Second Richardson Deuces Wild. Both teams benefitted from
fairly diverse scoring. Of course, Rusk obviously benefitted more in the 48-12 victory. Jan Withers led all scorers with 14
points, followed closely by Mary Edwards with 12, and Michelle Kresken and Susan Taylor hitting 8 apiece. Kelley Malone bagged
a third of the Deuces’ total points.

BEP and F becomes a charter member of the Rout of the Month Club with its unmerciful demolition of fourth
Rich’s Cloud Nine, 51-5. Dana Lemon hit for 28 points while Janet Bitter was the solo scorer for the storm
Clouds. The Subterranean Devils crawled out of the basement to earn Rich its first basketball victory of the young season.
The Devils trounced F & M’s Little Miss Trouble and the Mellifluous Poptarts, 25-10.

Coach Pat Daley led the Old Ladies to victory in a 26-7 game against Shrieks at Midnight with her 15-point
outing. Dean of Students Sue Ross provided the tenacious defense for the Ladies, collecting four big fouls. Daley sank eight
shots in a 30-24 beating of sometime-power Rusk. The other rival eating house, and also perennial power, Warner Hall’s Court
Cases gobbled up F & M’s Little Miss Trouble, 45-10. Annie Porges, Becca Bates, and Debbie Podolin combined for one
half of the Cases’ points.

For those people who love happy endings, the once down-and-out Deuces Wild rebounded from their opening season loss to Rusk
and claimed victories over Rich rivals, the Devils, in a 21-14 game, and the luckless Cloud Nine, 36-14. Deuces’ Max
Curry hit for 10 in each game.

Men’s League Play
The Ubbies started the season off right with an 83-38 drubbing of Second East Belk. There were five Ubbies’ scorers
in double figures. Jay Poag led the pack with 22 points, Lou Krempel hit for a solid 17, while Mike
Cate, Doug Neil, and Scott Morrison got 10 apiece. Pat Millen and Donald Davis led the Easter’s with nine points
each.

The Ubbies continued their high-scoring, rim-banging streak by turning off the volume on Allowed Liquid Sound, 48-28. Cate was high
scorer with 17 while the Sound’s Tyler Long hit for 12. Slaughter remained the trend as the Bud Men from
PiKA cut off third east Belk’s Third Legs, 45-14, and Emanon’s Midnight Train overran the Skeets of Third West, 49-21.

In other, more evenly matched league play, the SPE’s Unmentionables beat the Fiji Purple Cadillacs, 51-43, in a prestigious victory
in what may be the final year of the hotly-contested rivalry between the two off-campus frats.Jody McClain smoked the nets
for the Purple Cads with seven hits for 14 points. Joe Moss was MVP with 24 in Yeast Belch’s 65-42
win over Emanon’s Debbie’s Bums. Dick Shea went to the hoop for 21 of Moses and the Promised Land’s 69
points in their six-point overthrow of the Ruling Coalition. Starrcade ’84 fell to the Collapsible Rims despite the Dave Flowers-Steve
Soud Show, who combined for 24 points. Second west’s Slamming Seconds wiped third center’s C-Men off the court, 49-28, behind
Aaron Edward’s seven buckets. John Ponder’s 14-point debut enabled the Women of Vietnam to destroy the Purple Cads, 36-25. Belk’s
third center Bliff’s Yodeling Ogres outscored the Ward 20-11, with Matt Newsome tallying 12 points and Jeff Carter taking home
the honors for the Ward with 8. The Ogres and Ward currently share the Wheelchair award for their respective efforts
in the lowest-scoring men’s game prior to Christmas, successfully out-underscoring the Ariel Circus’ three-point Sleeper over Book of the Month
Club, 28-25. The Heat-Seeking Monster Missiles squeaked past KA’s Dunderheads 28-25, and PiKA’s Manson Family Singers fell to second center
Belk’s Hot Rocks, 30-26, in other potential wheelchair games.

Men’s A-League Games

Last but not least, Men’s A-league basketball. Becca and the Huts kept their cool, barely beating BSC’s Breeze in a
37-36 greaser. Dave Turner took game honors with 14 points, while Jim Sowerby and Will Cardwell combined for 23 of
Becca’s points. The Hod Squad from SAE had a difficult time for a while against rival frat PiKA’s tough junior
team, Three Seconds, in their five-point victory, 47-42. Scott Brandon proved to be the dominating force in the game, contributing
22 to the overall Hoddy effort. The mostly freshman squad, Death by Ru Ru, shocked the older Pax team, Basket
Cases, knocking off the bigger Bigger and Brechtelsbauer-led team 67-3. Former Wildcat Billy Naso hit for 16 for the victors.
Ru Ru went on to keep the Cool Breeze slack with a three-point victory, 37-34. Charles Showers hit eight baskets
to lead all scorers. Three Seconds got one in the win column by outlasting the hapless Old Men, 52-43, with
Alan Futral contributing 17. Undefeated Hod Squad evened Becca and the Huts’ record at 1-1 with a hard-fought 39-36 victory.
Finally, the defending IMAC champions, Supreme Court, successfully defended its title against SAE’s Far Side in a lackluster 44-37 performance.
