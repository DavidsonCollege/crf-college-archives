_THE DAVIDSONIAN, MARCH 28, 1934_

**BEAT CAROLINA!**

**Around the Wildcat’s Lair**

**TENNIS TEAM LEAVES**

Although it is legally spring, Old Man Winter has certainly made a valiant last stand. The weather Monday afternoon, when the Wildcats were defeated by Michigan State’s Spartans, was much better suited to football or ice skating. The extreme cold was responsible for a great deal of the loose play which was exhibited. The biting cold made the ball hard to handle, and a good many errors were made by both teams. The Wildcats just didn’t seem to be able to connect with the spheroid at the proper times. However, Woody Burns, who has an almost sacred position to fill, and Wimpy Ravenel both turned in nice performances. Burns handled some hot ones around the initial sack with mid-season form.

On account of the rainy, cold weather last Saturday, the Davidson student body was deprived of seeing some real class on the cinder track. The Carolina team, which recently won the Conference Indoor Meet, has a number of record holders. The boys from Chapel Hill will also be leading contenders for the outdoor title, and you would have seen a lot of good men in action. A rather amusing incident occurred Thursday afternoon when some of the Carolina men were taking a workout during the freshman track meet. LeGore, Carolina’s record-breaking javelin thrower, was tossing a javelin around rather aimlessly when one of the High Point boys asked, “Can you throw that thing?” LeGore modestly replied that he was not so good; and as he said it, he trotted along and tossed it about one hundred and seventy-five feet. On his next throw, with a little more effort, he hurled it some six feet beyond the two hundred-foot mark. The high school boy was last seen moving sheepishly away and possibly realizing that he could and did “throw that thing.”

The Wildkittens snatched six firsts and nine seconds in thirteen events to win their first track meet of the season. Most of the events were slow, but there is a lot of good material in the class of '37 for track teams in the future. Dickson bagged the high scoring honors with sixteen points. He won both the century dash and the broad jump with comparative ease. Dick Johnson, who was alternate captain of the frosh eleven, looks promising in the weight events. Incidentally, he won the shot-put with a distance of forty-three feet, two inches. Brown of the frosh ran a very nice race in the mile. The High Point boys put up a good fight and the meet was by no means a walk-away. Hendrix was the star for High Point, scoring thirteen points for his team with first places in the pole vault and discus and second in the javelin. He has vaulted as high as twelve feet in high school competition, but in the meet with the frosh he cleared eleven-four, simply to break a tie between a teammate and himself.

While most of us go home for Easter vacation, two Wildcat teams will be out to win more honor for old Davidson. The racquet wielders left today for an extensive southern trip. Under the leadership of Captain Halverstadt, the racquet wielders ought to bring us back no less than six good scalps. Coach Laird’s nine will be taking on Carolina in a two-game series in the meantime. The annual Easter Monday game between the Wildcats and the Tar Heels will take place in Concord this year. If you can get over there, you'll see some classy baseball. The golf team is in the last stages of sifting as this column goes to press. Bill Bowman, a sophomore who has been shooting in the 70's, will undoubtedly be the number one man. Furman will be the linksmen’s first opposition in Charlotte on April 12. A large step toward better spring sports has been taken by the authorities in their securing of Bob Crosland to help with the tennis team. Davidson has never had a tennis coach and he will certainly be a great help to the team.

**Training Rules are Published By Club ‘D’**

**Club Asks Co-operation From Student Body**

In order that the student body may be familiarized with the training requirements governing those men out for track and baseball, the following list of rules and regulations is published at the request of the D Club. Stricter enforcement of its new constitution is desired by the club, and the co-operation of every student will be appreciated. A list of those men who have signed the pledge is being printed in the hope that such co-operation will be facilitated. Strict adherence to these regulations is desired and expected by the D Club.

**Racquet Wielders Leave For Southern Matches**

The school tennis team left today for an extended tour of Southern colleges at which scheduled matches will be played.

**Eight Men Chosen For Golf Team As Tournament Ends**

**Squad Ties Faculty 12-12 in First Elimination for Varsity**

**BOWMAN LOW MAN**

**Season Opens April 12 With Furman in Charlotte**

After a drawn-out struggle, the golf squad succeeded in tying the faculty with the score ending—12-12. Eight men were selected from the list of sixteen entries in the tournament with the faculty. Out of these, four men will be selected for this year’s team. W. F. Bowman, sophomore, selected number one man, with his scores ranging from 75 to 80. B. C. Barnes was a close second, while J. B. Bunn placed third. W. C. Cannon and C. F. Hamrick tied for number four position, and F. M. Cochran and S. M. Hutaff tied for fifth place. A. W. Price placed sixth. Only a few of the entries have been shooting in the seventies this early in the season, but out of this squad the team should be composed of four players capable of playing consistently in the seventies by the time the season begins.

The golf team will open the season on April 12 by playing Furman, one of the strongest teams in the Carolinas, at Charlotte. Although this year’s squad has not been showing up as well as that of last year, it has hopes of developing in time to produce a dangerous team. However, this year’s schedule is a hard one, with Carolina, one of the best golf teams of the South, and Duke on the list.

**Wildcats To Engage University Saturday**and Wake Forest on Baseball Schedule

After having opened the baseball season with a loss to Michigan State on Monday, Coach Laird’s boys will begin their attempt to retain the state championship when they play North Carolina University at Gastonia on Saturday. The varsity will play one more game during the holidays, taking on Carolina again, this game to be played at Concord. With the reopening of school on Wednesday, April 4, the ’Cats return home for a two-day engagement with N. C. State, and on the following Monday and Tuesday, they journey to Wake Forest for two battles with the Deacons.

The freshmen will not have any games during the holidays. Their first game after returning from the Easter vacation will be with Gastonia High at Davidson on April 12. The coaches are trying to schedule one or two more games before that date, but as yet no definite games have been booked.

The racquet wielders will return to school after spring holidays. Led by Captain Jimmy Halverstadt, seven men will make the trip, including the manager, W. M. Thompson, and the following five men named in order of their playing position: W. T. Thompson, J. W. Lafferty, M. J. Barnett, F. H. Scott, and C. B. Lewis. Two teams will be played in Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina.

Managers Elected

At a recent meeting of the basketball lettermen, William B. Ravenel, of Charleston, S. C., was elected varsity basketball manager for the season of 1935. Donald B. Bailey, of Rock Hill, S. C., was chosen as freshman manager at the same time. These two men, and Jack Hellinger, of the class of '35, served as junior managers for the past year. Ravenel succeeds Fred Smyre, of Gastonia, as varsity manager. Jimmy White, of Graham, was the freshman manager this year. These men will have charge of spring practice on the local courts, which will begin in several weeks.

Meet With Carolina Saturday Called Off

Dual Track Meet Cancelled Because of Weather

A steady rain which churned the track on Richardson Field into a soft and muddy condition made it necessary to call off the dual meet that was scheduled last Saturday with the University of North Carolina. The university had sent a team of championship calibre to meet the Wildcats and it is to be regretted that the inclement weather prevented the student body from witnessing these outstanding athletes in action.

Davidson's tracksters, under the direction of Captain Pritchett, had trained diligently in preparation for this contest and were anxious to compare their strength with the high-class opposition offered by the Tar Heels. In Cochran, Evans, McPhail, and Armistead, the Wildcats have a nucleus around which Captain Pritchett is endeavoring to build up a strong team.

Robert Crosland To Coach Tennis Team

Will Also Help With Freshmen and Beginners

Davidson has procured Robert M. Crosland, former Middle Atlantic tennis champion, to coach tennis for this season. He will be on the courts every Saturday afternoon at 1:30 o'clock to coach the varsity. However, he will devote some time to the freshman team and beginners in the fundamentals of the game.

Crosland has been one of the foremost tennis players of this section. Besides his Middle Atlantic championship, he was for several years a top-notcher in the southern championship tournament, at one time runner-up. He has also won many minor tourneys throughout the South.

In spite of the fact that Crosland is in business and has been coaching professionally in his spare time, he has developed such stars as Lenoir Wright, former star of the University of North Carolina championship team, and Teddy Burwell. Burwell showed his ability in the Wimbledon tournament by running the famous Cochet to five sets. Captain N. G. Pritchett has secured the services of Crosland not only as a great help to the varsity but to stimulate interest in this sport.

Shirts and Shorts

There is nothing miserly about the cutting of HANES Wonderwear. No skimping of a half-inch here and there. HANES Shirts, Shorts, and Union Suits (both light and heavy) always tally with the tape-measure. A size forty-two is a size forty-two.

No Underwear could grow as HANES has grown, unless it offered comfort, quality, and style! You'll be happy in HANES!

Davidson Kittens Defeat High Point

Dickson Leads Field by Scoring 16 Points

Walter Dickson led the field in scoring when last Thursday afternoon the Davidson Wildkitten tracksters, in their first meet of the season, defeated the representatives from High Point High School on Richardson Field. The freshmen amassed a total of 64 points, even though they won only six first places out of 13 events. They captured nine second places to give them a sufficient margin for victory and leave High Point with 53 points.

Two first and two second places gave Dickson a total of 16 points, which was the high score of the meet. Hendrix, of the visiting team, was second in scoring with 13 points, gained by virtue of two firsts and one second place.

A summary of events:

100-yard dash—Dickson, Davidson, first; Fowler, Davidson, second; Robinson, High Point. Time 10.5.

Mile run—Brown, Davidson, first; Chastain, High Point, second; Higgins, Davidson. Time 5.6 minutes.

220-yard dash—Melton, Davidson, first; Fowler, Davidson, second; Jarrell, High Point. Time 25.0 seconds.

High hurdles—Potts, High Point, first; Dickson, Davidson, second; Deyerly, Davidson. Time 16.9 seconds.

440-yard dash—Fowler, High Point, first; Gladden, Davidson, second; Vann, High Point. Time 58.0 seconds.

220 low hurdles—Jarrell, High Point, first; Deyerly, Davidson, second; Brock, Davidson. Time 27.5 seconds.

Practice Game Won by Wildcat Baseball Team

Mooresville Nine Downed 7-5 in First Game

The Davidson Wildcats downed the Mooresville nine, 7 to 5, in a practice game on Richardson Field Wednesday afternoon, March 21. This was the first game the Davidson team has played this season.

A hit by Morgan to left field brought the first run of the afternoon to the Wildcats while an error by the Mooresville team scored a second run in the first inning. Three singles, a triple by McLean, and two errors gave Davidson five more runs in the third inning.

Jenkins and Richardson aided the Wildcats on the mound in the last three innings of the game. Three bases on balls, two men hit by pitchers, with three singles, gave the Mooresville team five runs in the seventh inning.

The batteries for Davidson were Coble, Burns, and Ravenel. The Mooresville batteries were Gadd and Beane.

Michigan State Is Decisive Winner In Battle With ’Cats

Coble and Jenkins Pitch for Davidson; Parker for the Visitors

McCANN HITS HOMER

Erratic Game Caused by Inclement Weather

Pounding away at two pitchers, the Michigan State baseball team defeated Davidson Monday by the decisive score of 16-6. After a slow start due to the cold, rainy weather, the game warmed up in the last few innings with a barrage of hits.

McCann of Michigan State started the fireworks in the first half of the second inning with a home run, the first score of the game. After that, the hitting of both teams picked up and the score remained close with Michigan State slightly in the lead until the eighth inning, when the visitors broke loose with two doubles and two singles, scoring six runs, to take a decisive lead.

In the fifth inning, Jenkins replaced Coble on the mound for Davidson and pitched the remainder of the game. Parker pitched the entire game for Michigan State. McCann, first baseman for Michigan State, was the outstanding hitter of the game, with one homer, a double, and a single to his credit. Fager of Michigan State chalked up three hits, as did Mackorell for Davidson.

Davidson staged a belated rally in the last half of the ninth with three straight singles and a double, bringing in a total of three runs. With two out, Harris batted for Jenkins, but failed to make a hit.
