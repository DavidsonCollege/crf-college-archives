COACH YOUNGER SIGNS
(Continued from page 1)
Beginning of the past season it was said that Davidson had no material for a football team but with the
men willing to work and the coaches working them hard, a team was turned out that won a widespread reputation.
The Wildcats went into games with odds against them, but when they came out they had the respect of everyone.
The football boys won seven games, lost two by 6-0 margins, and tied one 10-10. The Wildcat goal line was
crossed only twice during the season, and one of these on a blocked punt.

The basketball team made a creditable showing the past season and has played a fast game with heads up. The
baseball team has been playing with the jinx this season and has had hard luck, but it has finally broken
the losing streak. The players are ever-anxious and Coach Monk lacks reserve pitchers to rely upon.

Coach Monk has become a part of Davidson and along with Coach Tilson constitutes the main gear of the Wildcat
machine. These two men have probably done more for athletics at Davidson than any other persons. The student body feels
that as long as these men are here that a clean and splendid athletic policy will be followed out.

DAVIDSON NINE DEFEATS GUILFORD
(Continued from page 1)
Laird went well until the beginning of the eighth, when bunched hits caused him to retire in favor of Wells.
Smithdeal, McBane and C. Smith played the better game for Guilford, especially at the bat, Smithdeal getting a home run
and two singles out of five times at bat. Vance, Covington and Simpson hit best for Davidson, and between them
they secured 10 of Davidson's 17 hits. Vance hit a home run with the bases full in the second inning,
while Covington hit a triple.
