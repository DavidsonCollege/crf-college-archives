### Kruse’s Cubby  
#### Pigskin revival  
By MICHAEL KRUSE

Yes, we do have a football team. Granted, it has been hibernating for a few decades, but this year it is rolling out of bed, rubbing its sleepy eyes, and rising from the virtual dead. Now, at 1-0, I am not saying that they are headed to a national championship. But they are talented enough and spirited enough to make a legitimate run at a winning season, which is, based on the woeful history of football at Davidson, akin to winning the national title.

This team is good. And at this juncture in Coach Landis’ rebuilding scheme, good is right dandy. Great waits a tad down the road. So we have a capable football squad. What now? I’ll tell you what now.

At Maryville this weekend, the crowd was relatively large, rambunctious, noisy, and at times even obnoxious. And they actually cared. As Davidson clearly established and maintained the upper hand, disgruntled Scots fanatics began to play armchair quarterback. They yelled play calls at the coaching staff, screamed at the offensive line to get their heads out of where the sun don’t shine, and even offered some not-so-friendly instructions to the Scots’ Division III All-American linebacker. The refs received death threats.

One especially precocious mom sitting in the back row below the press box turned around when her Maryville meatball son recovered a fumble, looked brazenly at the three Wildcat coaches standing there, struck a sassy pose, and pointed to a pin attached to her bosom showing him. She was like 60. And she was talking smack. Tiny little Maryville against tiny little Davidson. And to these people, it was Florida-Tennessee. You know why? Because Maryville is their team. And Davidson is our team. And we should act like it, because this year there is no excuse.

Now I understand that the kind of people who actually read the Cubby on a weekly basis are the kind of people who will probably show up at the football games anyway. So it’s up to you, my loyal readership. Spread the word: the Wildcats make their Richardson Field debut on Sept. 28 against Emory & Henry, the 12th-ranked Division III team in the country. It is Homecoming. And we’ve all got some work to do.

Maryville, Tenn. - Tradition has the Davidson football team sing the fight song after every win. After the Wildcats ended a nine-game winless spell with a 24-14 victory over Maryville (0-2) on Saturday, all 56 players were ready and willing to test their somewhat rusty voices and belt out "O Davidson." But the song was only icing on the cake for Davidson (1-0), as it had the Scots singing the blues for most of the afternoon.

The much-improved Wildcats shocked the feisty Maryville crowd by dominating the first half on their way to a 10-0 advantage at intermission, and then rejected the Scots’ spirited comeback bid in the second to hold on to the confidence-building victory.

“Coach (Tim) Landis was talking before the game about how he wanted this to be a new era in Davidson football and to erase the losing traditions that we’ve had in the past,” said co-captain linebacker A.R. Barrington. “And this was a huge, huge step.”

That it was, as the Wildcats posted nonpareil efforts on both sides of the ball. The offense, which averaged 260 total yards last season, amassed 220 in the first half alone and finished with...403, nearly doubling '95’s weekly rushing output (125). Much of that was thanks to sophomore slasher Lorenzo Moll, who picked up 138 yards on 25 carries and tallied two touchdowns, the last one coming with 4 minutes, 6 seconds left in the contest and sealing the deal. But Moll was hardly a one-man wrecking crew, as rookie fullback Eric Ferguson rumbled for 56 yards. “We rushed the ball real well and that opened up the play-action pass,” said Landis. Signal-caller Tommy Dugan, who put Davidson up 7-0 with 3:08 left in the first quarter on a 4-yard touchdown scamper, connected on 10 of 17 tosses for a respectable 161 yards, including bombs of 37 yards to Ben Brown and 33 yards to flanker Mike Harrington. Not quite Florida’s Fun ‘n’ Gun, but a drastic betterment over last fall’s often stagnant offense.

Quarterback Tommy Dugan, who scored the season’s first touchdown against Maryville, sets to throw during practice.

But the defense was equally impressive, even more so in the first frame. Led by Jay Ariail, Ben Spivey, Chris Hess, Wes Thornton, and Barrington, the new Stunt 4-3 formation gave up just three first downs and 29 rushing yards in the first 30 minutes. The corps forced five turnovers, which led to 10 decisive Wildcat points. “I think defensively, they’re a lot better this year than last year,” said Maryville head coach Phil Wilks. “They made the big plays. We gave up the big plays. We turned the ball over. Davidson’s got a good, well-coached football team.”

“I’ve never seen it so hyped on the sideline,” said safety Max Nelson amid a sea of postgame smiles. “It was unbelievable - people were bouncing around, jumping around, going nuts. That’s what it’s all about. A lot of our momentum was kept up by the sideline spirit.”

“It was a good team effort,” said Harrington, who hauled in three catches for a team-high 71 yards. “We deserve it. Every single one of us.”

And that fight song, it’s a damn catchy tune.
