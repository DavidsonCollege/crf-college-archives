Kruse’s Cubby
The week that was
Johnson City
By Michael Kruse

JOHNSON CITY, Tenn. - Johnson City. Along with Kingsport and Bristol, one component of Tennessee’s Tri-Cities area. About an hour
north of Asheville, three and change from Davidson. The land of the Buccaneers - home of East Tennessee State University.
And for me this past week, a second home. My home away from home.

My never-ending quest to provide both basketball teams with in-depth, unprecedented coverage in the Davidsonian took me on two separate
junkets to this educational mecca of Eastern Tennessee in a span of less than 72 hours. I was there on
Wednesday to cover the men’s 79-60 win and then again Saturday to witness the women’s loss to the tattooed, muscular,
frighteningly un-Lady-like Lady Bucs. I was one with Johnson City.

The New York Times states at the top of its front page every morning, “All the News That’s Fit to
Print.” The Johnson City Press, undoubtedly in an effort to emulate the Times (as every paper should), writes, “What the
people don’t know will hurt them.” Ah, the people. The people, after all, make the place. And about 1,500 of
these people, perhaps masochistic in nature, flocked to the so-called Mini-dome Wednesday night to suffer with their beloved Bucs, who
hold a vice-grip on last place in the conference’s North Division.

The Mini-dome is a grossly misnamed building. It stands out against the rest of the architecture on campus like a
hideous, colossal monstrosity of a sore thumb. The basketball court sits in the middle of the cavernous structure like a
needle in a haystack. The fact that this earth zit seats over 14,000 for hoops does nothing but add to
a claustrophobic feeling of emptiness.

The fans that do show up, however, are a downright boisterous bunch considering their team is 5-12, and only three
of those five wins have come against Division I opponents. The fans’ spiritual leader is the Bucs Crazy, a thirty-something
who runs up and down the aisle in front of the bleachers every time ETSU does something reasonably well.

“Is he a student?” I asked a local reporter.
“Oh, I doubt it,” he said. “He’s been doing this for years.”

But must the second statement necessarily follow the first at ETSU? That’s my question. But to satisfy my humor demand,
I didn’t need to look any further than two spots down press row. There sat a pony-tailed man wearing a
suede magenta blazer and lavender trousers with what appeared to be an enormous pizza (I hope) stain blanketing his crotch
area. His name was Marky and he hosted a weekly ETSU hoops talk show on WKEB in Johnson City. He
asked a single question at Buc coach Ed DeChellis’ postgame press conference and was shot down with a resounding, “No.
Next question.”

The man was two things: (1) a living joke, and (2) a personification of hope that, yes, there is a
chance for me and other Davidsonian sports staffers who harbor dreams of one day making this their career. That is,
as long as the Bucs aren’t the team, the Press isn’t the paper, and Johnson City isn’t the town.

Donnelly shoots down lowly Bucs
Men’s hoops rebounds from loss at Boone, thrashes cellar-dwelling ETSU

JOHNSON CITY, Tenn., Jan. 22 - After seeing Appalachian’s Tige Darner hit eight three-pointers and single-handedly beat Davidson Monday night
in Boone, Mark Donnelly put on a long-range shooting show of his own 48 hours later against East Tenn. St.
Donnelly nailed 6-of-7 threes on his way to a career-high 29 points, as the Wildcats (9-8, 3-3) coasted to a
79-60 victory over the last-place Bucs (4-12, 0-5).

“Mark Donnelly was sensational, just sensational,” said coach Bob McKillop. “He played an outstanding offensive game. He’s got a hair-trigger
release, he’s got terrific size, he’s got long arms, and people look to get him the ball.”

The 6-5 junior is shooting 55% from three in Southern Conference play and is in third place overall in the
league at 42%. Bolstered by Donnelly’s marksmanship, the Wildcats had perhaps their most efficient and effective offensive effort against a
Division I opponent this season. The game was all but over before intermission, as Davidson finished the half with an
18-6 run and took a 38-23 lead into the locker room.

The margin grew to a game-high 21 points (55-34) on a pair of Landry Kosmalski free throws with 11:01 remaining.
Eight Wildcats logged double-digit minutes, even with forward Stephen Marshall on the bench nursing a sore ankle. And the team
posted 22 assists, including a career-best 12 from Ali Ton, and shot 65% from the field. Chadd Holmes broke out
of a recent mini-slump, scoring 14 and grabbing 8 boards. Kosmalski added 13 points and David Burns provided a spark
off the bench with 6 points in 10 minutes.

ETSU, on the other hand, shot just 38.6% from the floor and dropped its ninth straight contest. “We can’t shoot
34% (in the first half) and expect to win,” said first-year ETSU coach Ed DeChellis. “It’s pretty evident we’re just
not at that level.”

“They’re the best team we’ve played in the conference this season,” said Troy Seymour, who led the Bucs with 13
points, 6 assists, and 5 rebounds. “Davidson’s a very good basketball team,” continued DeChellis. “They’ve got competitive kids who can
all beat you. They’ve got all the pieces to the puzzle. This is a team we could see in the
conference championship.”

Actually, the Wildcats swept the top four spots twice (men’s 200 free and 400 IM), and they dominated throughout, winning
every event except the men’s and women’s 50 free. “We’ve come a long way in a week. Everybody was expecting
to do better than last week, but this was an impressive performance,” head coach Rich DeSelm said. “We had our
B medley relay beat our A medley relay for both the men and the women, and that really shows our
depth.

“The difference between this year and last year is a testament to our hard work and to good personnel. Everybody
is excited to be swimming for this program, and we have some talented people. Hopefully, this is a sign of
things to come this year and in the future.”

The women opened the meet by winning the top three spots in the medley relay, and the men followed by
claiming the top two. Then Kathleen Paffenroth ran away with the women’s 1650 (18:11.98), beating her closest competitor by more
than 30 seconds. Lynsay Madley took third in the event (18:46.04).

But, possibly the most exciting event of the day was the men’s mile. Rob Saldin went out in the lead
and held it until the middle of the race when Freddy Schnell swam past. Schnell held on for a comfortable
win, but a race developed for second between Saldin and Charleston’s Brendan Betts. Betts enjoyed a two-second cushion after 56
laps, but then Saldin turned it on, closing out the last ten laps with an enormous kick that left Betts
five seconds behind.

“It was exciting. It’s two and a half minutes faster than I’ve ever swam it before,” Saldin said about the
race. “It was also the first time I’ve swam the mile in 2 or 3 years. It’s exciting to see
some of my other events develop.

“I thought I would try to stay close enough so I’d have a chance to get him when it came
down to the last 500 yards. I had enough left to come back fairly strong. I was fortunate that I
was able to keep it close in that middle part of the race, and, with a good kick home, I
was able to move by him.”

Four Wildcat records fell later in the afternoon. Terry Dolch bettered the standard in the 100 back when he led
off the second-place medley relay (52.83). Mary Shell Brosche set the 200 back record in her win (2:07.15), and Scott
Harper lowered two marks on his way to wins in the 400 IM (4:10.91) and 200 fly (1:56.19).

“I hadn’t been feeling that confident coming in, but I hadn’t had a chance to swim my favorite events and
I wasn’t feeling good in practice,” Harper said. “But today I got to swim in the 200 fly and the
400 IM and I felt pretty good in the water.

“A lot of people are swimming their best in season, if not their lifetime best times. Watching Rob (Saldin) come
back in the mile psyched me up big time. That was awesome. We’re looking good for Southern States.”

The Wildcats had eight double winners on the day. In addition to Harper’s record-setting double, McCabe took the 200 free
(1:46.07) and 500 free (4:55.71), Michael Hart won 1m (227.10) and 3m diving (211.28), and Schnell 1650 free (17:08.73) and
200 back (1:56.24) for the men. On the women’s side, Paffenroth followed up her 1650 with a 200 fly win
(2:12.07), Zannah Bozzone won the 200 free (1:57.20) and 500 free (5:11.49), Brosche took the 400 IM (4:35.10) in addition
to her record-setting 200 back, and Elizabeth Fraser won the 1m (181.65) and 3m diving (166.58).

“Last year, we (the women) won by a point after a missed score. It’s amazing to me what the freshmen
have provided,” Allison Hobgood said. “The overall atmosphere and the whole makeup of the team is different.”

In addition to the great swimming, the divers had one of their strongest days of the season. Not only did
Hart and Fraser pull off double wins, but walk-on divers Becky Latanich, Dave Jenson, and Michael Gillespie all scored for
the Wildcats.

“Each meet is getting better. The freshmen guys (Gillespie and Jenson) had never done it before, and for Becky this
is her second year, and she’s way ahead of where she was last year,” diving coach Ted Hautau said. “Elizabeth
is our best girl, and she’s doing a good job. She’s really learned how to compete. (Michael) Hart is having
his best season ever, he’s greatly improved and gotten a lot smoother. Everyone should peak well at Southern States.”

“I think everyone performed beyond their level and gave 128% today,” men’s co-captain Bo Craig said. “I’ve heard no less
than ten people with personal bests today, and I’m proud to be a senior on the swimming and diving team.”
