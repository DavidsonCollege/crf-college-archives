Colonel Scofield Passes to His Reward
Had Lived More Than Fifty Years in Davidson.

An ominous hush crept over the campus Wednesday when the news spread that Colonel Scofield had passed to his reward. Although the Colonel had been laboring under a dread disease for some time, his death was rather unexpected. A distinct shock was felt among the students, and their hearts made sorrowful when, in reminiscence, the familiar figure of the Colonel was summoned only to be saddened by the thought that he is no more.

Colonel Scofield was one of the best-known inhabitants of Davidson. He was born in 1847, in Columbia, S. C. In 1857 his family moved to Davidson. The father of the Colonel was a contractor and received the contract for the construction of Chambers building. At the completion of this task, the family moved to Illinois by wagon, where they remained during the war. Meanwhile, his father died, and Mrs. Scofield with her son returned to Davidson in 1867.

In 1870 the little grocery and confectionery store was established. This marked the beginning of Colonel Scofield’s business career at Davidson. He has since proved himself to be one of the most prominent merchants and businessmen of the locality. He was the builder of the linen mill and also helped lay on the telegraph lines in the community. For some years he was the efficient station agent for the railway company. Later the Colonel was employed in building the Y. M. C. A. building and the church. He was also active in the service of his church and held several offices. He was a deacon and for some time treasurer.

Health finally forced the Colonel to give up his more active duties to live a quiet life. He had remained undisturbed in his store until his death. At 3:30 Thursday afternoon, the funeral services were conducted in the Presbyterian Church by Dr. Richards. A large number of the town people and a good many of the students showed their loyalty and respect for the “Old Colonel” by attending the funeral services and later going in solemn procession to stand with bowed heads before the grave. The high esteem with which the Colonel was held was fully evidenced by the great abundance of flowers, presented as tokens of love from friends, including the students. The pall-bearers were the officers of the church. An honorary escort was composed of the president of the student body, the old and new presidents of the Y. M. C. A., and the presidents of the classes. The students heartily sympathize with the close friends and relatives of Colonel Scofield. We feel that we have lost a sincere friend, but our loss is his gain, for he has been called to a higher life.

Mrs. C. F. Myers, Mrs. A. W. McAlister, mother of J. W. McAlister, '19, and L. L. McAlister, ’20, accompanied Mr. Myers and Mr. Hamtree, who came from Greensboro to attend the last Y. M. C. A. service of the year.
