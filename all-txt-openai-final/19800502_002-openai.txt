In interviews with The Davidsonian this week, four seniors shared some of their thoughts about their college careers, their feelings about Davidson, and their plans for the future.

John Boggess, a member of the 1979-80 College Bowl team, is not sure what he will be doing next year. He has taken the Foreign Service Examination but has not yet received the results from the State Department. Boggess said that he might remain at Davidson next year and work for either the Admissions Office or the Union or look for a job on the close peer age that made it appealing, Boggess said. In particular, he continued, “small classes, the small eating, and the small town” as contributing to Davidson’s ambiance. He warned that, in his opinion, overcrowding is Davidson's most serious issue, as overcrowded eating houses and classrooms and waiting lists for housing can be avoided if the College would commit itself to maintaining enrollment at 1300. Boggess recommended that students “not get into a rut,” but rather explore a variety of disciplines and take courses that broaden horizons. He also said that given the opportunity to do it all again, he would not have majored in Political Science, but rather in English Literature or Theater, broader and less concrete fields.

Ann Tutwiler, chairperson of the Union Speakers Committee, Political Science major, and recent initiate of Phi Beta Kappa, will be going to Kenya next year to teach. Unlike Boggess, she said that given the opportunity again, she would not come to Davidson. She would choose a more politically active campus, preferably located in a larger Northern city. Tutwiler said that the things she likes best about Davidson are its Honor System, the friendliness of the people connected with the school, the “sense of community,” and the academic program. The provinciality of the school and the male-female social system (which she blamed on the attitudes of students, not the infamous ratio) displease her. Tutwiler urged all students to take advantage of the programs the Union has to offer, especially cultural events and speakers. She also recommended that everyone consult the Experiential Programs Office and spend their summers doing more than “grilling hamburgers.” Tutwiler observed that most students study too much and that they should spend more time getting to know people better. She advised students to select courses not for their content but for the professor who is teaching the course. That, she says, is the important thing.

Billy Taylor, a chemistry major and former Sigma Phi Epsilon president, hopes to attend medical school next year at the Medical College of Georgia. In weighing likes and dislikes, Taylor said that knowing what he does about the College, he would opt to come here again. He cited the abundance of good people in the community as a reason. However, one thing he feels is an imperfection in the school is that more students don’t take advantage of the many opportunities offered outside of academics. Taylor stated that all students should be careful to “explore other opportunities offered outside of the classroom” and to “take full advantage of the Center for Special Studies.”

Ann Eglin feels about Davidson much as Billy Taylor does. Eglin said that she feels so good about her Davidson experience that she has talked her brother into coming here next year and is trying to convince her sister, a high school junior, to come here also. Another younger sister is a junior here now. Like Taylor, Eglin views the people as being the “most important part of Davidson.” She stated that there are a (See Focus on Seniors, page 11)

Physical Plant Director Grover Meetze said the contract for the two new dorms should be signed soon. Once signed, construction will begin immediately for completion in September 1981. The dorms will be double occupancy with two floors each. They will be air-conditioned and will have a kitchenette and washer-dryer on each floor. Meetze said there are no plans at this time for turning them into 1600 students in terms of dining and housing, despite Davidson’s commitment to just 1300 students. When asked about Davidson's commitment to 1300 students, Meetze said all immediate plans, including the Commons as well as the two new dorms, are aimed at 1600 students. Dean of Students, Will Terry, said, “the two dorms will end this frantic search for off-campus housing.”and will enable those students wanting to remain on campus to do so. Perhaps now room drawing will be less hectic, although I’m pretty sure the students will continue to make it hectic in order to have something to do. There are no plans for putting a lake in the middle of Patterson Court.

Carrier current radio ready in fall

The campus carrier current radio station should be on the air next fall, according to Janet Coleman, one of the station’s organizers. Students are now painting the room in the basement of Belk which will serve as the broadcasting center, Coleman said. “We’ll be moving the equipment into the room early next week,” she added. About 30 students, most of them freshmen, have expressed an interest in working with the carrier current station, according to Coleman. No officers will be chosen this year, although Coleman said ultimately there may be campus-wide elections for the station.
