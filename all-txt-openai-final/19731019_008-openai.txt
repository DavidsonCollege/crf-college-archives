**Gridders Seek Momentum At W&M**

**AN ANALYSIS By GORDON WIDENHOUSE Sports Editor**

(Ed Note: The following is a personal observation of the present crisis facing the football team at Davidson as they prepare for the two very tough opponents, William and Mary and the Air Force Academy. It focuses on what, in the author's opinion, the Cats need to change as they look to meet the crisis.)

Facing what could be considered its most important crisis of the season, the Davidson College football team travels to Williamsburg, Va. tomorrow for a clash with the William and Mary Indians.

“We have to get ourselves together sometime,” explained head coach Dave Fagg. “Perhaps this will be the week.” But even more important than getting it all together is the idea of momentum. For, a look at the remainder of the Cats’ schedule depicts why concern is at hand. On the Saturday following the clash with the Indians, the Cats will be paired against the Air Force Academy, one of the strong major college teams over the past few years. It seems a necessity for the Cats to get their offensive and defensive momentum ready for the Falcon contest.

Against the Indians, the Davidson squad will be out to prepare their passing attack for the Falcons. With quarterback Dave Harper having only sporadic success in recent games, the passing scheme has been little more than minimal. But the entire problem has not rested totally on Harper’s shoulders. On many occasions, his receivers have been guilty of dropping passes which should have been easy catches. Interceptions have also been key defects in the offensive potential of the Cats. There have just been too many inconsistencies within the framework of the offense. Fagg spoke of this as leading to a simplification of the offensive strategy. But if the showing against Furman last week was any indication of this move, then it seems that another alternative should be found.

Running has also been a difficulty for the Cats, to say the least. Several factors can be observed as leading to this situation. Initially, the offensive line of the Cats has not been opening the holes necessary to have an effective running game. Without adequate blocking, a halfback has little chance of getting through the defensive line. The line has, however, been up against players who have a greater physical size, so it would be difficult to blame them, although more efficient blocking could be expected. A second reason for the lack of rushing offense would be the injuries sustained within the backfield. Halfbacks Dave Ingold, John Webel, and Foney have been injured, which has further hampered the running game.

A vastly improved Furman team overpowered Davidson 38-7 last Saturday. Davidson was plagued throughout the game by the mental errors that have stopped the Cats all season long.

“During the game, I had the feeling that we were not being physically beaten,” said head coach Dave Fagg. “I thought we played well and the films showed that people were just making mental errors and failing to execute.”

In some respects, the Cats looked better than they have all season, particularly on offense. “This was the first time we were able to sustain a drive this year,” Fagg remarked. “In fact, we moved the ball better on them than Richmond did.”

Furman scored first midway through the first quarter on a 14-yard run to cap a 55-yard drive which took nine plays. The Cats tied the score two minutes later when Larry Hardaway scored on a two-yard run. The offense marched 62 yards in 10 plays to set up the score.

“We had the best protection we've had all year last Saturday,” Fagg said. “The coaches and I were very pleased with the performance of the offense as a unit.”

After the first quarter, however, Furman completely dominated the game, scoring twice in the second quarter to make the score 14-7 at halftime. Davidson took the second half kickoff but fumbled two plays later. Fagg felt that this was one of the most important plays of the game. “We had run it once before for 17 yards,”but the second time we tried it, a man missed his block and Harper never had a chance to give a good pitchout to Hardaway,” he explained. The Paladins capitalized on the turnover and scored to put the game out of reach. “That's just an example of how mental errors, the mental breakdowns, have hurt us this year,” Fagg said. Two more touchdowns in the fourth quarter made the final score 38-7. Despite the rather lopsided score, Fagg emphasized that he was pleased with the performance of the team as far as the Cats' attitude was concerned. “I told the team that the coaches and I were pleased with their poise and attitude during the game,” Fagg stated. “They never gave up. What continues to displease us is the breakdown in mental execution.”

Fagg offered several reasons for the team’s lapses in execution under game pressure. “Right now, we have so few people on the team,” he explained, “that it’s impossible for us to practice under game-type situations.” Fagg went on to explain that when the team scrimmages against the same formation that opponents will use, they often have a trainer or a coach included on the opposing team. “I think we played a very fine Furman team,” Fagg said. “They are certainly the most improved in the conference this year.”

Davidson is now 1-5 on the year with an 0-4 record in the Southern Conference. Despite a poor record, the team has several bright spots. David Harper is ranked among the top 20 passers in the nation and Walt Walker is still among the nation’s top 10 in receiving. If the Cats cannot change this trend, then they will be in for a long afternoon, not only in Colorado Springs, but also in Williamsburg.

The Cat defense has not looked up to par in its latest outings either. The Paladin runners made easy prey of the off-tackle plays, as well as the jaunts around end. The defenders had kept opposing offenses in check on most occasions, except for the times when Davidson offensive errors put the opponents in excellent field position. But there was a limit as to how long the defenders could continue their containment. That point has obviously been reached.

Little needs to be said of the Indians. Suffice it to note that they have a good running game and a fine passing offense. They also have 34 returning lettermen, with their starting backfield intact from last season except for one position. The Indians are also considered one of the three contenders for the Southern Conference crown. Davidson needs a good showing to take with them to Colorado next weekend. And the problems they must solve in order to do this are quite large. The time for “putting it all together” has arrived.
