THE DAVIDSONIAN - TUESDAY, JANUARY 26, 1999

‘Cats register solid road victory over UTC

On a night when Ben Ebong was absent from the Wildcats lineup, Stephen Marshall most emphatically arrived. In front of
a crowd of 5,082 at UTC Arena in Chattanooga, the 6-foot-8 junior forward from Midlothian, Va. turned in a 23-point,
9-rebound performance to lead the ‘Cats to an impressive 68-54 victory over the UTC Mocs. It was a victory which
came without the services of Ben Ebong, who is nursing an ailing back.

Marshall, dubbed “Dancing Bear” by Davidson Wildcat radio broadcaster Frank Santore, finished 9-15 from the field and 5-5 from the
line. He has now hit 14 consecutive free throws and 27 of his last 28. “We firmly believe that Stephen
can play against anyone in the country,” states Wildcats head coach Bob McKillop of Marshall, Saturday’s Fox Sports South Player
of the Game.

Tied 35-35 at intermission, McKillop’s crew wore down and all but eliminated UTC’s offensive attack in the second half with
a variety of stifling zone defenses. “We tried to change looks on them, and mix it up a lot,” said
McKillop, whose ‘Cats are now 10-7 overall and 5-2 in Southern Conference play.

With 9:00 left in regulation and the ‘Cats up 51-48, Davidson guard Michael Bree connected on perhaps the most critical
three-point basket of his young career, giving the ‘Cats a 6-point edge. The bucket was Bree’s only tally on the
night. After holding the Mocs scoreless over the next four minutes, the ‘Cats delivered the decisive blow with 5:25 left
to go, when Ali Ton caught up with and corralled an erratic downcourt pass, then pivoted and drained a clutch
three-pointer, giving Davidson a commanding 59-48 lead. UTC never recovered.

“It was a great, great win for us in a tough place to play,” said McKillop, who is now just
two victories shy of 150 for his Davidson career. “Our bench came alive, our veterans came up big, and we
flowed well. That’s as good as we've been offensively all year. We were simply phenomenal in transition.”

The ‘Cats shot 47% from the field and an impressive 71% from the line, while UTC was held to just
38% from the field on the night. What, then, can possibly explain Stephen “Dancing Bear” Marshall’s offensive outburst on Saturday
night? Coach McKillop has a suggestion. “Landry (Kosmalski) gave Stephen a real tough time in practice on Tuesday. Right from
the start Landry told him, ‘If you want to establish position in the post, you’re gonna have to fight me
for it.’ He really lit a fire under Stephen.”

Kosmalski may, then, be the team’s finest motivator. If so, it must be noted that he ain’t too shabby a
performer, either. The 6’7”, 215-lb. power forward from Bedford, Texas contributed 13 points and 7 rebounds to the Wildcats’ cause
on Saturday night.

Freshman Brian Turner continued his torrid three-point shooting for the ‘Cats, finishing with 6 points (2-2 from 3-pt. range) and
4 rebounds in just 15 minutes of action. Ali Ton served out 5 assists and nabbed 2 steals, and earned
his coach’s praise for a host of intangibles he provided. “Ali didn’t have a tremendous night numbers-wise, but was still
very central to our success,” said McKillop.

For UTC, Idris Harper finished with 17 points, and Mare Smith had 10 rebounds.

‘Cats put Citadel through “basic training”

After jumping out to an early 16-point lead, the Davidson Wildcats were able to hold off the feisty Citadel Bulldogs
for a 70-60 victory. The win moved the Wildcats to 9-7.Overall and 4-2 in conference play, Davidson [70] defeated Citadel
[60]. Citadel dropped to 6-11 and 0-7 in the conference. Citadel’s only lead of the game was a 4-2 lead
with 18:04 to play in the first half. In the next five minutes, Davidson went on an 18-0 run sparked
by Brian Turner’s two three-pointers. Chadd Holmes’s layup with 12:58 to play in the first half gave the Wildcats a
20-4 lead. The lead did not last long, though, as Citadel bombed their way back into the game from three-point
land.

“We thought it would be easy to score,” said Coach Bob McKillop, “but an 18-point lead evaporated in a matter
of minutes.” The Wildcats scored the last five points of the half for a 37-31 halftime lead, capped off by
Davor Halbauer’s 60-foot prayer to end the half. The Bulldogs shot an amazing 64.3% from three-point land in the first
half on 9-of-14 shooting. The Bulldogs only connected on two shots inside the arc the entire first half. Citadel was
able to get as close as two points early in the second half, but they never could manage to tie
or take the lead against the Wildcats.

Every time Citadel had a little run, Davidson had the answer, but the Wildcats were never able to really put
away the Bulldogs. The Wildcats were led by Landry Kosmalski’s 15 points and six rebounds. Davor Halbauer had 11 points,
and Ali Ton had seven points and 10 assists. The game marked Ton’s sixth double-digit assist game. Ben Ebong had
a great game off the bench with 10 points, five rebounds, five assists, and three steals. Brian Turner showed off
his explosive scoring abilities with nine points in nine minutes off the bench. Eight different Wildcats attempted a three-pointer, paced
by Davor Halbauer’s eight attempts. As a team, the Wildcats shot 35.7% (10-28) from long range. When Citadel began hitting
their threes, the Wildcats began to force up more threes of their own.

“It’s a simple response to answer a three with your own three,” said McKillop. It definitely wasn’t the prettiest game
of the year, but the Wildcats were able to hold off a Citadel team that got very hot from three-point
land, and in the words of Coach McKillop, “A win in conference play is a win.”

### Wrestlers pinned in three straight matches

By David Moncure, Sports Writer

The weekend of January 16-18 was not a memorable one for the Wildcat wrestlers as they lost all three of
their matches. The ‘Cats fell to Duke by a score of 28-12, then to Virginia Tech 40-3, and finally they
were shut out by VMI 42-0. On January 16, Davidson faced in-state rival Duke at home but was unable to
capitalize on the home arena advantage. Junior Ian Kaplan continued his season-long winning ways by capturing his match 3-2. Freshman
Jeff Storms had a thrilling overtime victory for the ‘Cats, prevailing 5-3, and sophomore Dan Carman won his match by
forfeit.

The next two matches against Virginia Tech and VMI, held in Blacksburg, VA at Virginia Tech, proved even less successful
for the Wildcat wrestlers. Kaplan was the only Davidson wrestler to obtain a victory against Virginia Tech, defeating his opponent
in an incredible overtime match. Kaplan was not as successful in his match against VMI, as he and his teammates
were handily defeated.

The Wildcats hope to rebound from their recent woes in their home match against Norfolk State at 3:00 p.m. on
Saturday, January 30.
