Matmen Lose In Virginia

An injury-riddled Davidson mat squad journeyed to Virginia last Friday and Saturday, and then returned home with two more Southern Conference losses to its record. At VPI, the Cats started strong with Johnny Kelton, undefeated Carlyle Charles, and Jimmy Jung coming through with successive decisions after a forfeit in the 121-pound class—the score standing 9-5 at that point. In the succeeding four matches, there was a complete reversal, and the Tech team left the mats with a 17-9 victory. 

However, the next night the team continued its losing ways by bowing to a strong VMI squad, 29-3. Not a single point could be registered for the visitors until the heavyweight match. Stubby Evans, a former 155-pounder, garnered three points by decisioning the big military man. Although many injuries have constantly plagued the team, there is a good chance that the boys will win some glory in the conference wrestling tournament next week.

Ah, not so, mi'lord, ne For you see, H'l know whereof I speak, and though it must be reluctantly admitted, chivalry is old and decrepit, at these many years been quite sick, still she lingers on despite it. Apparently, this was to assure entertainment en route. Elsewhere under the same skies, my up-to-date housemaid reports many romantic interludes of not quite familiar characteristics but of nonetheless passionate intensity. As for instance, our old friend, George, who forsakes his squirrel to fool at the sec- Shame, George!

It’s all in our money. “Song bird” Rush and his pretty partner turned in a swell performance. “Dos” is still trying to find out who got him to sing. They always refer to it as the pursuit of happiness. No one has ever caught and held it for any length of time.

“Bull” and “Slates” seemed to be all over the floor, too. Way to go boys! Oh, yes, a rumor is circulating that a couple of the boys found a new dream girl. Just ask “Old Joe” and “Higgy” among others. Erwin, what happened to your girl? You should have told her that you would leave your boxing gloves at home.

Trew and Neil tried an impossible task the other night, that of skiing. Campbell, what's the lowdown on your weekend activities? Odell and Herb were off on their usual mysterious jaunts. Sure did enjoy the “eta” feed. Heard that Bill Cleve gave the Wildcats an unexpected fight before they fell to the Presbyterians, 54-52. Bill Iverson salted the game away with a field goal in the last minute of play. Iverson led the Cat scoring with 14 points closely followed by Cheek with 12, and Hopper with 11. Snee led the Tigers with 17 points as he took top scoring honors.

Tom and Dick Stockton, Ralph Futrell who, although have not played in too many of the games, have proved invaluable to Coach Baird in practice and deserve a tremendous amount of credit.

“ONE SUNDAY”
Secretary of an old friend, dillying and dailying like the antique that he is. George allows as how he condones the principles laid down by John Donne of England fame, who said that the curse of a lover's being constant was that her lover becomes old and sick. We saw to that before Shakespeare's time, and despite a brief flourish during the war (Confederate, that is) when other like devils were rampant, she is now quite, quite dead. But not so, in lord. For you see, in sunny Rock Hill on a Sabbath day, I distinctly saw Long Paul Jenkins making merry and his girl was actually driving him around. When they passed through Charlotte (the windows were already fogging up) she mentioned casual-like to appear to be conversing trivially, that she had some little history to read about. With grace unbeknownst since the Cavalier poets reigned, Chesterfield satisfies his chariot around in the middle of the square, and with a grave countenance announced, as any because it’s MILDER.
