**Venereal disease fairly widespread at Davidson**

**Chlamydia bacterium can cause pain, sterility**

**By TRIPP HELMS**

As many as 50 percent of Davidson’s sexually active students have or have had chlamydia, a sexually transmitted disease, estimates
Davidson College Physician Audrey Shields.

Although this does not represent an “epidemic,” Shields says that three to four male students are being treated for the
disease each week at the college infirmary.

There are somewhat fewer cases treated among female students, says Shields, but this is because the disease is harder to
detect in women. Also, many women see their own private doctors instead of coming to the college infirmary.

This worries Shields because some “older doctors” may not know to look for chlamydia because it has just recently become
prevalent in sexually active people.

Some sexually active Davidson students recognize chlamydia’s prevalence on campus. One student remarked, “Yeah, it gets around. You sleep with
two or three people and you’ve got it. It’s almost like catching a cold.”

Many women who have chlamydia spread it unwittingly because most women show no symptoms. The few women that do show
symptoms may experience pelvic pain and irregularities in menstruation.

Symptoms are more prevalent in males, showing up in 75 percent of infected men, but Shields says that men often
disregard them. The most common symptom of chlamydia among males is pain in urination.

A man who has chlamydia can develop urethritis, an infection of the urethra. Although it is not common, urethritis can
lead to an inflammation of the testicles that causes sterility.

Chlamydia is more dangerous to women infected with the disease. It begins as an infection of the cervix and can
move through the uterus to the fallopian tubes. Scar tissue from the infection can block the fallopian tubes, which may
result in infertility.

Eleven thousand American women become sterile each year because of pelvic inflammatory disease, another possible consequence of untreated chlamydia.

The disease is completely curable when treated with antibiotics. Because it is so hard to detect, Shields treats the disease
if there is any suspicion of its presence in a patient.

**Students face computer shortages in end-of-term crunch**

**By SUSAN PEARSALL**

The end of a term is usually characterized by excessive student activity at the Computer Services Center as the mad
rush to turn in papers by the Friday 5:00 deadline begins. This term, it has been more difficult than ever
to type a paper or to get it printed at the Computer Center because of the school’s relatively small supply
of IBM PCs and the ever-increasing demand for the computers and printers.

The situation has become worse because the school’s four printers have been breaking down throughout the year. Only two printers
are currently available, and often a student must wait for a half hour to print out a paper. According to
the Center’s director, John Casey, a request is pending in the school’s budget (to be approved in March) for funds
with which to purchase more public-use PCs and more printers. The same request was made last year and was approved,
but no funds have yet been made available, and the school has bought no new equipment.

**Thefts plague Café grocery**

**By JON BOLES**

Union Café staff are instituting measures to deter shoplifters in response to a recent series of thefts from the grocery
store. In addition, there has been concern over the disappearance from the Student Store of a class ring valued at
approximately $200.

Dining Service Supervisor Diane Stone says that no one has been implicated in the shoplifting incidents, which consist mainly of
“minor things—drinks being drunk and the empty bottles put back into the coolers and problems with people who go to
the register, have already eaten something and then forget to pay...that’s understandable.”
