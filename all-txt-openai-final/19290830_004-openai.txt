DR. WALTER L. LINGLE (Continued from page 1)

1902, and being chairman of that body for 24 years. His visits to the campus have been frequent, and his investigation of educational conditions during the past several years as chairman of the educational committee gave him an added insight. It is felt at Davidson that Dr. Lingle is one of the most capable men in the Southern Presbyterian Church. He is a lecturer, a writer, an experienced executive and educator, and has a wide range of friends throughout the south and in many northern cities. He has already written a message to the alumni, friends, and students of Davidson, and the portion which dealt primarily with the students is quoted below:

“I wish that I might know every student personally. That may be impossible. It is a rather large contract to learn to know six hundred men personally, in addition to performing all the duties which belong to the president’s office. But if that is not possible, I would like for every student to feel that I am always accessible, whether in my office, in my home, or on the campus, and that I will always count it a privilege to be of any possible service. I feel that this same thing can be said for every member of the faculty. The college exists for the sake of the students."

DAVIDSON PROFESSORS TRAVELLED AND STUDIED

Many Institutions and Countries Visited by Faculty This Summer

Members of the Davidson College faculty have materially benefitted themselves this summer, many of them studying in institutions scattered all over America, while others chose to spend their time and obtain the accruing benefits by traveling in Europe, Africa, and Asia.

Cumming, Prof. J. H. Davis, Jr., and Prof. T. E. Lothery, Jr., were students at the University of Chicago, and Prof. W. R. Weaver, Jr., attended Middlebury College, school of Spanish in Vermont. Among those traveling were Dr. M. E. Sentelle, dean and professor of Bible and philosophy, who spent three months in Egypt, Palestine, Syria, Sicily, and Greece; Dr. T. W. Lingle, who has been touring for seven months in northern Africa, Asia, and southern Europe; Prof. H. T. Lilly and Prof. A. V. Goldiers, who have been in Europe, the latter in Spain most of the time; Dr. W. P. Cumming, who went to Alaska after studying at the University of Chicago, and Prof. F. K. Fleagle, who toured Central America and studied a while in Mexico City. Miss Cornelia Shaw, librarian, has also been in Europe this summer, the major portion of her time being spent in Norway and Sweden.president and the faculty are there for the sake of the students.
