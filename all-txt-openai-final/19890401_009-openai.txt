*&*&*& THE DAVIDSONIAN’S 75TH Anniversary Issue &*&*& April 1989

The typical Davidson student in 1914 received an educational experience that contained some of the same traditional features that remain
a part of Davidson today. The main three aspects of Davidson life that date back to 1914 are the Honor
System, the serious, stimulating—and rigorous—academic atmosphere, and the various range of social opportunities. Of course, these aspects were practiced and
pursued in different matters and settings that reflected the times of 1914.

The Honor System, for instance, was written and practiced simply and straightforwardly as it is today, yet its contents were
different. The Davidson College Catalogue in 1914 presented the Honor Code in three parts.

The Code held that students not cheat, steal or damage property and that they report those that do so. It
further included a clause prohibiting the hazing of freshmen. Hazing was defined as subjecting freshmen to cruel and unnecessary duties
outside of their normal obligations. The Honor System appeared to have been as serious and as important to the college
as it is today.

### A day in the life... in 1914

The academics at Davidson were challenging. Admissions wasn’t at issue as it is today—staying in school was. This fact explains
why the freshman class of 1914 contained 115 students and the senior class just 45. Almost 70% of the faculty
were Davidson graduates and were further schooled at such institutions as the University of Virginia, Johns Hopkins, and Yale. More
emphasis was placed on language and literature than is today.

The social events perhaps best represented the term “old fashioned” as we know today. This is especially true when speaking
of “co-ed” activities. Girls were a rare occurrence on campus. Perhaps that’s why, according to college archivist Chalmers Davidson, the
men often shouted “fire” when they spotted a girl. Actually, Dr. Davidson remarked, the call was a warning to men
wearing robes or to those not adequately dressed. When girls did come, they stayed with helpful and willing townspeople for
the weekend, often as

President Woodrow Wilson visits Davidson, his first alma mater May 20, 1916

Creating a great deal of excitement, President Woodrow Wilson visited Davidson on May 20, 1916. According to the June 1,
1916 issue of The Davidsonian, Wilson decided to visit his former college during his visit to Charlotte. Escorted by Secret
Service men, Wilson and the president of Davidson, W.J. Martin, along with their wives, drove through the streets of the
town, which were lined with many hoping to catch a glimpse of Wilson. Wilson visited his old dorm room, Chambers
13. He reminisced about his college days as he pointed out the place where he used to cut wood to
heat his room. His next stop was to visit the Eumanean Society, of which he was once a member. When
asked to make a speech from the balcony, the President said, “I was just confessing to Dr. Martin that this
is the one place that I cannot make a speech. I have tried here before.”

The article also included Wilson’s grades. “In the fall: excused absences, 2; Logic and Rhetoric, 95; Greek, 87; Latin, 90;
Math, 74; Composition, 96; Declamation, 92; Deportment, 100; Average, 87.67 per cent. In the Spring: (On the account of sickness)
Excused absences from prayers, 44; Excused absences from church, 3; Excused absences from recitation, 66; English, 97; Greek, 88; Latin,
94; Composition, 85; Declamation, 92; Deportment, 100; Average, 93.42 per cent; Average for the year, 91.50 per cent.”
