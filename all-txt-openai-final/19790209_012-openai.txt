Student gets strong reaction to suicide ad

LITTLETON, CO. (CPS)—
Female, 21, student, gives self
three weeks before popping pills
for suicide. If you know good
reasons why I shouldn't, please
write P.O. Box 131, Littleton,
Colo.”

When Arapahoe Community
College student Dyan Smith
placed this ad in a Denver-area
student paper, one student
respondent already had her
second-guessed. “What a ter-
rific way to get a term paper
done!” he wrote Smith. “Damn
good idea!”

Smith had, indeed, placed the
ad in the Collegiate Camera in
December as part of a project
for a “Man and Death” class at
ACC. But the project idea the
sophomore psychology major
had chosen arbitrarily began to
pose “problems with ethics.”
Smith’s doubts started when
sincere, concerned replies began
to pour into her post office box.
“I began to think, ‘Do I have
the right to subject these people
to this anguish and the sharing
of very personal emotions?’”
The matter was further com-
plicated, Smith recalls, when,
at about the same time Smith's
“suicide” was planned, a Denver
woman called a local TV station
threatening suicide. The wo-
man, who refused to identify
herself or her location, spoke for
almost two hours with KBTV
personnel, who attempted to
dissuade her. When the station
publicized the call, several peo-
ple called to suggest Smith as a
suspect. The real suicidal caller,
incidentally, was never located.

When the respondents thus
discovered the ad was a hoax,
several wrote back expressing
hurt and anger. “I felt bad,”
Smith said, “but I’m glad I did
it.”

For one thing, the 49 respon-
dents provided an answer to the
reason for Smith’s experiment.
A Harvard student performed a
similar project in 1969, and
Smith wanted to find out if her
plea for help would get the same
responses as his had ten years
ago. Her idea was to see if there
would be differences between
the ‘we’ generation of the
sixties and the ‘me’ generation
of the seventies.”

According to her data, there
is. Whereas only 58 percent of
the Harvard student’s respon-
dents included addresses and
phone numbers where they
could be reached for help, 88
percent of Smith’s respondents
gave that information.

Smith did receive one nega-
tive reply (“Get more pills, set a
date, and I’ll join you,” the
letter read). But other replies
provided Smith with some “ve-
ry interesting” reasons to carry
on. One letter advised her to
read Slapstick, a novel by Kurt
Vonnegut, to find out why life
was worth living. Another sug-
gested “visiting Montana or
Coors Brewery, or dancing to
Saturday Night Fever” at a
local disco as remedies for her
“despair.” Still another said he
would personally advise post-
poning suicide to “see if the
Broncos go to the Super Bowl.”
Most, Smith said, wrote to
suggest she “look at other
people’s problems to see how
lucky she was” or to “turn to
God.”
Smith’s results also differed
from the Harvard study in that
over twice as many males
responded as females. The male
Harvard student experienced an
exact reversal of that ratio.
Smith said that some of the
males assumed she was despon-
dent over a break-up with a
boyfriend, and asked her for
dates in their letters. “Seems
like a kinky way to get a date.”
