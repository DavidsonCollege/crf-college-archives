~~ THE DAVIDSONIAN, OCTOBER 30, 1930

Alumni From 13 States and Forty-Five Classes Return

Former Students of College Returned by Airplane, Motor, and Train for Annual Home-Coming Celebration Saturday

CLASS OF 1930 LED

Members of 1866, 1871, 1876, and 1878 Classes on Campus—Three Hundred Attend Luncheon

Davidson College alumni from 45 classes and 13 different states last Saturday returned for the annual Home-Coming celebration of their
Alma Mater. Classes represented extended from that of 1866 through 1932, and from 1895 through 1930 there was an uninterrupted
representation, for at least one member of all the classes in between were at Davidson for the festivities.

Practically every known modern means of conveyance was used by the returning sons of Davidson. Capt. Geo. H. Weems, formerly
R.O.T.C. commandant, but now stationed at Langley Field, Va., returned by airplane. A few used the train, but the majority
came by motor. A few hours after the exercises had concluded most of the alumni were en route to their
various homes throughout the continent, and their many expressions of enjoyment were conclusive proof that the day had been happily
spent.

Many alumni, of course, arrived at Davidson only in time for the game, but those on the campus early during
the day and who came by the alumni office to register approximated 200. The class of 1930 led in registration
with 18 members of the youngest group of alumni putting their names in the book. The class of 1912 had
a dozen of its men here; 1914 had 11; 1907 had eight, and 1926, 1906, and 1899 were each tied
with seven each. Had every alumnus registered, the list would perhaps have changed slightly the classes which led.

Davidson was honored by the presence of four of its older alumni. These included Gen. W. A. Smith, ’66, of
Ansonville, N.C., commander of the North Carolina Confederate Veterans, who returned last fall for the first time since he left
to enter the War Between the States in 1864; S. H. Hearne, ’71, of Albemarle, who has not missed a
homecoming or commencement of Davidson since 1926; Dr. E. M. Summerell, ’76, of Mill Bridge, and Dr. Geo. F. Robertson,
’78, of Mount Holly.

North Carolina led in the state representation, naturally, but South Carolina, Georgia, and Virginia sent their largest delegations to any
Home-Coming of Davidson during the past several years. Other states having men on the campus last Saturday included Texas, Illinois,
New York, Maryland, Florida, Tennessee, West Virginia, and Alabama.

Alumni were here to listen to addresses by three members of the Davidson faculty, to enjoy an alumni luncheon attended
by approximately 300 people, to witness a scrappy and exciting football game between V.P.I. and Davidson, and to attend a
stunt night program. Included in the alumni visitors were 20 members of Davidson’s 1910 state championship team, and 14 of
the 15 members of the Alumni Council.

Alumni Marriages

Carroll-Pegues

Mason L. Carroll, Jr., ’27, and Miss Frances Pegues, both of Greenville, S.C., were married on October 14. Mr. Carroll,
who is a native of York, S.C., went to Greenville after his graduation and is connected with the J. R.
Lindsay Cotton Company. Mrs. Carroll obtained her education at Hollins College.

Carson-Phillips

Thaddeus Rudolph Carson, ’30, of Gastonia, and Miss Marjorie Phillips, of Washington, N.C., were married on October 11. After leaving
Davidson, Mr. Carson became connected with the Myers and Hanes Mills, of Gastonia.

28 Alumni Died Since Last Home-Coming Day

List of Deceased Alumni is Published Below—Five Met Deaths in Violent Accidents

It was originally planned that a list of the alumni who had died since last Home-Coming Day would be read
last Saturday, and Rev. J. T. Pharr, ’12, of Cass, W. Va., member of Davidson’s 1910 football championship team, had
been chosen to do this. However, the exercises lasted longer than expected, and this part of the program had to
be omitted. The list of 28 names is being published below, for the alumni, no doubt, would like to know
the names of those alumni who had been claimed by death since the last homecoming of Davidson. The names include
five men who died by violent deaths, four of them being instantly killed and fatally injured in automobile accidents, while
a fifth accidentally shot himself while on a hunting trip. Below is the list, according to classes:

Correction

The editor of this page corrects, with pleasure, an error made in an article published on this page October 9th,
in which it was stated that Dr. Neal L. Anderson, '85, had resigned as pastor of the Independent Presbyterian Church
at Savannah, Ga. because of ill-health. The source of information was a newspaper, who had the matter confused. Dr. Anderson
simply resigned on the 13th anniversary of his ministry there in order to take up other work on which he
had long ago set his heart.

Gridiron Heroes of Two Decades Ago Were Center of Attention Last Saturday—Twenty-Two Were at Davidson

PERMANENT PLANS
Team Expects to Re-Unite in 1935 for Quarter-of-a-Century Celebration

Davidson’s gridiron heroes of 1910 were in the spotlight of attention at Davidson Home-Coming Day, as they returned for the
first time for a reunion. Exactly two decades ago they had won the championship crown of North Carolina for the
Presbyterians, and after twenty years they came back to their football training grounds, and saw the lads of Davidson put
up a great fight against V. P. I., only to be defeated by a monumental one-point margin.

Twenty players from all over America, the coach and the manager of the famous team were here Home-Coming Day. This
meant that all but two of the living members of the squad in America were at Davidson. The only absentees
were Dr. C. R. Wilcox, ’11, Rome, Ga. and S. H. Kerr, ’13, of Catonsville, Md. Rev. E. S. Currie,
’12, of Haichow, China, was unable to be here. The only deceased member of the team is J. N. Van
Devanter, ’15, who died last year at Albuquerque, New Mexico.

Assembling at specially arranged headquarters in the vacant house of Davidson’s fraternity, the squad attended the morning exercises in a
body, went to the alumni luncheon together, and at the football game sat grouped about the 1930 players’ benches. Cheer
leaders gave a yell for them, and the stands joined by standing in honor of these men during the cheer.

Following the football game, they reassembled at headquarters, where they had as special guests Mrs. Oren Moore, of Charlotte, formerly
Miss Louise Murphy, their sponsor, and Mrs. P. W. Booe, of Davidson, at whose home they had their training table
while at Davidson. With appropriate remarks, Coach Simmons presented them with small tokens of appreciation. Later, each man filled out
a questionnaire, the substance of which will be later divulged in The Davidsonian.

At night they had an elaborate banquet just to themselves. Coach Simmons was toastmaster, and he allotted each man a
few minutes in which to tell of how fate had treated him. A letter was read from Captain Norton G.
Pritchett, Davidson's professor of physical education, informing the group that Coach Simmons had been given honorary membership in the “D”
Club. Dr. DeWitt Kluttz, captain of the 1910 team, presented a gold football to their mentor. The group authorized Coach
Simmons to send a cablegram to Rev. Currie in China. They also decided to meet five years from now in
a quarter-of-a-century reunion, and perfected an organization with Dr. Kluttz their captain, as head, and E. H. Graham, of Goldsboro,
better known as ‘Tiny” Graham, as secretary.

On exhibition in the office of the alumni secretary all during the day was the football actually used in the
defeat of the University of North Carolina in 1910. The score was 6 to 0. The football had been stuffed
and shellacked, and on the outside was printed, “1910. U. N. C., 0.; D. C., 6.” This football was on
the banquet table for the feasting eyes of the squad. During the day, the men also wore badges that distinguished
them as members of the title team.
