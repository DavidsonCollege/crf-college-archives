GOODRUM, from page 11

some respect by responding to it, I feel that The Davidsonian should replace this column with expanded sports and news coverage. The column takes up a great deal of space which could be employed by two or three other staff writers with ideas to express. Upon examination of the masthead, I see an expansive Davidsonian staff which could capably undertake some investigative reporting of more substance and interest to the Davidson community. There should be no doubt that they want to be involved in the continuation of The Davidsonian, as they signed up for it in the first place.

In the interest of higher extracurricular involvement by students, instead of letting her loose, how about cutting Lucia loose?

Respectfully,
Tom Goodrum, Jr. ‘90

Just keep those sweet little notes pouring in...
