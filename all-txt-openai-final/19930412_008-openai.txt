#### The Art of Tattoos
By Rachel Newcomb

We drove ten miles east on Independence Boulevard until the traffic thinned out and we were almost in Monroe. Jolly Roger’s was on the right. Ann DuPre’s Honda seemed out of place among the beat-up old American cars that lined the parking lot. I followed my friends into Jolly Roger’s Tattoos, which looked like a bait-and-tackle shop. The walls inside were completely covered with examples of tattoos and their prices, ranging from flowers to skulls to huge fiery dragons.

Jolly Roger came out from a room in the back and sized Ann DuPre up. “Show me what you want done,” he demanded. She pulled out a wildflower book and showed him a quarter-sized picture of a sunflower.

“A hundred, hundred fifty at least,” he said shortly. “I’d have to draw that pattern up myself, and even then, I don’t think I can get you that kind of detail.” He walked into another room and came back a few minutes later with a business card. “I don’t usually do freehand. You need to go see Carl in Concord. He does freehand.” Jolly Roger handed her the card.

Carl’s tattoo business was located in a small house in a residential neighborhood in Concord. Here, big notebooks were filled with the standard designs you could choose from. Ann DuPre filled out a form verifying her identity and proof that she was over eighteen. While she waited, she talked with Carl’s wife (who was also the receptionist) and watched Carl skillfully cover a man’s arm with a tremendous, intricate dragon.

It was well after dark when Ann finally sat in his chair. He looked over the design she wanted and quickly sketched it onto a stencil. Then he wiped the skin on her ankle and placed the design down. With tiny electric needles that sounded like a dentist’s drill, he filled in her skin with ink—vivid gold, yellow, and orange hues of a sunflower with a brown center. It took him no more than fifteen minutes. He gave her instructions on how to care for it until the skin healed and took her money. The cost? Twenty dollars.

Humans have been tattooing their bodies for thousands of years. Last year, a 5,300-year-old man was found buried in ice with tattoos that appear to have served some sort of ritualistic or identification purpose. Since then, humans from almost every culture have tattooed themselves at some point in time. According to Jane Mount, a Davidson anthropology major who did her senior thesis on tattoos, tattoos began to spread to the West in recent times when sailors visiting other cultures would get them. In the West, tattoos have been perceived as deviant but have recently exploded in popularity. Mount mentioned that on a recent visit to San Francisco, she noticed that tattoos are incredibly popular.

A number of Davidson students took the stage at Cunningham’s Makeshift Theater Wednesday to open the third phase of the 1993 Studio Theater Season. “Reasonable Circulation,” directed by Katy McDaniel, revolved around the workings of the secretarial pool in a New York publishing office. The second play, “The Great American Cheese Sandwich,” directed by Barclay Cunningham, documented one family’s trials and adventures and how all is made right by a cheese sandwich.

“Reasonable Circulation” followed the personal and professional challenges of five workers in an office. Bob Pascal was highly effective as a calm and calculating executive, a part he was born to play. Likewise, Jonathan Brooks delivered a capable performance as the young actor who is working while waiting for his big break. Susie Criscione kept the office moving as the executive assistant. Each of the performances was excellent, but the show was stolen by Sue Kisla and Holley Wilson, who delivered their lines with perfect Long Island accents as they talked of Agent Orange, engagements to be, gastritis, and some guy named Marko.

The second show featured a very strong ensemble performance. “The Great American Cheese Sandwich” was a wonderful surprise in more ways than one. Rogers King surprised everyone as the transvestite younger brother, a part he may also have been born to play. Sorry Rogers. The younger sister was Candy Brown, whose purity and innocence were never in question despite her rather late stage of pregnancy. Joshua O’Neill rounded out a cast that included stellar performances by Bobby Ramsey and Valerie Whitlock. Valerie gave yet another solid performance as the mother of the family. Bobby, who will also be in next week’s shows, was astounding as the father, and together Bobby and Valerie kept the show moving wonderfully.

Two more one-acts will be presented on Wednesday and Thursday of this week at 7:30 in the Makeshift Theater of the Cunningham Fine Arts Building.

“About two and a half years ago, two friends and I went to Jolly Roger’s tattoos. I got one then, a little dragon on my ankle,” Mount said. “Then last year, I took Images of Women, an anthropology class. I did a paper on images of women with tattoos and how women with tattoos actually are. Obviously, there are some biker women who wear leather and have tattoos, but then there are also normal, everyday people.”

Mount hopes to pursue photojournalism or to work in an art gallery. For her thesis, she interviewed local tattoo artists and videotaped their work. Prices range from twenty dollars for something small up to elaborate designs which cost hundreds of dollars. A freehand artist will copy an original design created by the customer and make a stencil of the image, which is then transferred onto the skin. The skin is cleaned with antiseptic, and most tattoo artists use either fresh needles sterilized by hospital equipment or new needles. The machine punctures the skin, and tattoos are outlined in black and filled in with color. Before these machines were invented, individual holes were poked into the skin with ink, a lengthy, painful process. People have even tattooed their skin by pulling a threaded needle through it with ink on the thread.

Mount says tattoos nearer the bone are more painful because they pinch the skin to the bone. Areas of the body with more padding hurt less. It also depends on the ability to tolerate pain. According to Mount, many of the tattoo artists she interviewed said that some men have a harder time getting tattoos due to a lower pain threshold. Carl, the artist who tattooed DuPre, told her that he has had a number of men faint but never a woman. From designs used for religious or ritual purposes to decorative designs, tattoos have fascinated man for thousands of years. In recent years, tattooing has become more widespread. Mount estimates that at least thirty people at Davidson College have tattoos. I asked her if she planned to get any more. She laughed.

“They say that tattoos are addictive. I’ll probably get another one when I decide what I want. You have to consider if you want it all your life. Tattoos can be removed by laser surgery, but this is very expensive. I think a tattoo should be something meaningful about you or your life. But some people like them for aesthetic reasons. I think it’s a great thing just to have an image for you."

Movie Review... The Worst Movie I Ever Saw By Scott McLean

I recall that my family once went to see Hands of Steel. In the many years since then, I have not seen or heard of anything that could even remotely reach the depths of atrociousness that movie attained. The closest thing I’ve observed to it was what I saw on my last jaunt to the Movies at the Lake when I was bamboozled into seeing The Crush. Walking out of the theater, I decided that I would have rather slid down a bannister, have it turn into a razor blade, and then land in a pool of lemon juice than to have gone to this thing. Yes, it was really that bad.

The story starts off when Nick (Cary Elwes, the guy in black in The Princess Bride) moves to Seattle to begin work with a trendy magazine and starts looking for a quiet place where he can write. He ends up living in the guest house of a well-to-do couple who have a 14-year-old daughter named Darien (newcomer Alicia Silverstone, and as somebody mentioned to me, doesn’t her character’s name conveniently rhyme with Damien?). As you can probably guess, Darien develops a “crush” on Nick and sets about eliminating anyone or anything that interferes with her plans for him--this includes using a hive of angry wasps among other things.

I have one thing to say to the producers of this film: What’s your damage? I mean, what were you thinking? Please enlighten me because I’m dying to know how something this bad can be made. If the story wasn’t bad enough, as it was, then the acting made this horrible film even worse (if that’s possible). I am convinced that Alicia Silverstone attended the Madonna School of Acting. Girl, there’s a dollar in the mail--go out and buy some real acting lessons. The one (and only) positive thing I can say is that it was so bad the whole theater was roaring with laughter during the greater part of the flick. For this one, I say enter at your own risk and consider yourselves warned.
