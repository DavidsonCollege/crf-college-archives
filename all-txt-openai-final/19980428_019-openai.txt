THE DAVIDSONIAN

Co-Most Valuable
Jamilah Sawyer

Entering the outdoor track season, Sawyer was the only person on the roster who had earned All-Conference honors in an
individual event last year. She was named All-Conference in the 100m hurdles as well as the 4x100m relay. So what
could she do to help the team this year? Repeat. Sawyer was the only member of the women’s team to
be named All-Conference at the Southern Conference Championships this season. She earned the honor with her second-place finish in the
100m hurdles in 15 seconds flat. Sawyer is a good sprinter and excels in hurdles. Her season-best time in the
100m hurdles of 14.87 was also the team’s season-best time and was only less than two-tenths of a second off
the school record which she set herself last season. She also posted the best time by a Wildcat this season
in the 400m hurdles and the second-best in the 400m. This season she ran the 400m leg of the Distance
Medley Relay team that broke the old school record by almost six seconds. In the 4x400m relay, she ran on
three teams that came within three seconds of the school record.

Co-Most Valuable
Smyth Bitter

Arguably the most promising runner to grace the women’s track roster in years, Bitter has had an enormous impact during
her rookie season. She posted the team’s best performances of the season in three different events and broke the school
record in two of them. Both the 400m record and the 800m record fell with Bitter’s arrival on the Davidson
track scene. Her other team-best time was in the 1500m. In that event, her time of 4:46.17 was under six
seconds off the record. It seems more than probable that she will break that record as well before she leaves
Davidson. Along with Sawyer, Bitter carried the relay teams throughout the season. In the 4x400, she ran in the team’s
four best performances this season, three of which were within seconds of the school record. She also ran the 1600m
leg of the record-setting DMR team this season. At the Southern Conference Championships, Bitter claimed fifth place in the 400m,
making her and Sawyer the only Wildcat runners to place in the top six in individual events.

Best Rookie
Jill Neumayer

Another rookie mid-distance runner, Neumayer was routinely the number two finisher after Bitter in the 800m and 1500m events. Her
season-best time in the 800m was 2:21.71. This was three seconds behind Bitter’s record-breaking season best and was 0.6 seconds
off the old school record in the 800m. Neumayer placed ninth in the 1500m with a season-best time of 4:57.62,
making her the second-fastest Davidson runner in the 1500m this season. She was a critical member of the relay teams
as well. She ran on teams that posted three of the top four finishes this season in the 4x400m, including
one that placed fifth at the Southern Conference Championships.

TUESDAY, MARCH 24, 1998

Jamilah Sawyer once again was dominant in the sprint events this year. She came within two-tenths of a second of
breaking her own record in the 100-meter hurdles this season.

Now that the heroics of Stewart Sloan have secured a spot in the playoffs for the Wildcats, Coach Cooke and
company can move on to their next task: The Citadel.

The Citadel is one of three teams to pull itself out of the crowd of mediocre teams filling the rest
of the playoff spots. Drew Williams 202 4341 104 19 21 1 8 .250 14 28 .303 Western Carolina is
one of the three teams in the Southern Conference that have a winning record in conference play. The remaining seven
are all below .500, and five of them are below .400.

The Citadel is therefore a formidable opponent. The key to their success is no secret. They live and die by
pitching. Three members of the starting rotation rank in the top ten in the conference in earned run average. Brian
Rogers, a 6-foot-6 righty with a tremendous curveball, will most likely pitch the first game against the Wildcats. Rogers is
eighth in the conference in ERA. He is also first in strikeouts with 127 on the year.

Beyond Rogers, two major obstacles are Drew Williams, who ranks ninth in ERA in the conference and second in strikeouts.
He is also tied with Rogers for second in the conference in opponents’ batting average. Another key player is Tom
McGintee, who is fifth in the conference in that category. He is also third in strikeouts.

The Citadel’s hitting is good, but is secondary to the pitching staff. Plus, the rotation is not invincible. In an
outing against Rogers earlier in the season, the ‘Cats scored seven runs off of the ace in a losing effort.
That effort shows what the key to the game is — defense. If Rogers is off his game, then judging
from past experiences the ‘Cats should be able to score runs on him. The problem then will be keeping the
Citadel batters at bay. In the previous outing against Rogers and his squad, the ‘Cats scored nine runs and still
lost by three.

Even worse is the possibility that Rogers will be hot. Then the ‘Cats chances to win will rely on giving
up as few runs as possible and hoping that Rogers grows tired or that the Citadel relievers are unable to
hold a lead.

The Citadel is a very tough team. Then again, in a double-elimination baseball tournament, absolutely anything can happen.
