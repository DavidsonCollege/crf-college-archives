**Repairs, permits and money delay sports complex opening**

**Martin says problems extend beyond athletic department**

By JAY CHAUDHURI

Minor repairs and budgetary problems have delayed the opening of most of the athletic facilities in the Baker Sports Complex, according to Athletic Director Sterling Martin. Currently, the new gym is open primarily for use by varsity athletes, and no definite date has been given as to when the complex will open for general use. Reasons for the delay can be traced to problems in several areas of the complex.

Although the swimming pool was opened for a swimming exhibition during the inauguration of the building, the permit granted by the county was temporary. Currently, the pool is pending a permanent permit from health authorities.

While the upper level racquetball courts are playable, water has seeped into the area around the lower level courts. Until then, the courts remain a safety hazard.

Another area of the new gym that needs attention is the weight room, which currently has no weights. The athletic department is attempting to order new nautilus equipment valued at $28,000, rather than recondition the old equipment.

The athletic department is presently maintaining the same amount of staff members. However, personnel needs to be added in the weight room, swimming pool, and security, according to Martin. These budgetary requests are estimated to cost $250,000. However, permission must be granted by the college before many of these changes can be made.

As a result, this area is now being recarpeted. Furthermore, equipment for the courts has not been moved from the old gym. The upper level basketball courts to be used for intramurals still need faceplates to cover the volleyball net inserts.

"The pressure lies somewhere else besides the athletic department," said Martin. "Everything could fall this week or next week but a lot depends on the college."

Until those requests are approved and the repairs are completed, students can still expect to use the Johnston Gym facilities.

**Campus may be getting cable television soon**

Last Friday freshmen selected eating houses or fraternities, decisions which will help shape Patterson Court next year. FIJI and PAX were especially influenced by the freshmen’s decisions. The other houses experienced little overall change in membership patterns.

PAX executive board and members made the decision at their meeting this week not to reopen the house in September. Whether PAX remains open for the rest of the semester depends on whether members continue to use the house. Only six freshmen and three upperclassmen decided to join. Contributing to this decision included the strain which rush put on house members.

"We're such a close group," said PAX President Joe Treadway, "and the pressure to rush members was causing tension." The fact that 33 percent of freshmen decided to join the Commons also affected PAX’s situation, Treadway said, "We decided to give co-ed eating a break." It remains wide open whether PAX will ever reopen. "The future of co-ed eating is up to our freshmen," said Treadway.

On the other hand, FIJI successfully recolonized their fraternity with a pledge class of 15. Members from the national organization assisted in the effort.

Students may enjoy cable services soon if the costs of acquiring them are not overly expensive.

An ad hoc SGA committee was established last year to look into the possibility of installing cable television in the dorm lounges and Patterson Court houses. This year the committee, chaired by Brooks Geer, continues to work with the Residence Life Office and Lakeside Cable of Mooresville on the project.

Richard Terry, Director of Residence Life, stressed that cable would be "a luxury as opposed to a necessity."

Terry said that when he got to Davidson, there was a file on cable TV and that investigations had been done. Nothing was decided, however, and Terry said that he was a little "gun shy" about the project. "There is no guarantee that it will happen."

Lakeside will be giving the college an estimate on the cost of laying the ground cable; and if a proposal is
