**“What about those starving children?”: Let's be informed!**
Amy K. Carr

I was first exposed to the topic of world hunger at an early age. My Mom employed guilt as nutritional
motivation. “What about those starving children?” she would screech upon discovering a mound of lima beans hiding in my napkin.
After she refused to send the disgusting legumes to Africa, I avoided the entire topic by cleverly flushing the mushy,
wrinkled limas down the toilet.

A liberal arts education has replaced my innocent ignorance with some realizations about world hunger. The most conservative estimates predict
that over 500 million people, or 10% of the world’s population, suffer from chronic malnutrition. The World Food Council estimates
that 40,000 children die of hunger-related causes every day. Insufficient access to a healthy diet limits human ability to develop
full physical, emotional, and intellectual potential. Hunger is a problem of international scope.

No doubt, the topic of world hunger arouses disturbing pictures of malnourished babies with swollen bellies and penetrating countenances. Hunger
is not just a “Third World problem.” In 1985, the Physician’s Task Force calculated that hunger afflicts some 20 million
Americans. A Charlottean’s recent article on the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal attests to the bleak reality that
hungry people reside in Mecklenburg County.

Theoretically, hunger is unnecessary. Tremendous food surpluses provide us a temporary reprieve from the catastrophe predicted by Sir Thomas Malthus.
Even a decade ago, the hunger problem was perceived as one of too little food for too many people. Now,
the problem is recognized as one of distribution and access. Hunger is not a matter of choice—no human being chooses
to be hungry. Most of the world’s hungry people are unable to feed themselves: many are children, elderly, or disabled,
others are subject to unjust political and social situations, and still others are the victims of natural and human disasters.

As educated members of an affluent community, we have an obligation to help the hungry. Tremendous public and private efforts
have reduced the percentage of hungry people in the world in the last decade. The absolute numbers of hungry people,
however, have risen due to population increases. Stirred by Bob Geldoff’s Live Aid, we rallied to support African famine victims.
Ironically, less than a year later, crooner Willie Nelson addressed another urgent public problem. He tugged at our hearts and
pockets with concerts benefitting America’s troubled farmers, who, like their foreign colleagues, have suffered not because they cannot coax food
from the land, but rather because a world food glut has lowered the prices they receive for their produce.

What an obscene paradox the juxtaposition of these two concerts creates—one provided aid for the starving people who don’t have
enough food, while the other aided those harmed by producing too much.

The first step in solving this enormous problem is to become thoroughly informed about the topic. Analysis of world hunger
requires an interdisciplinary approach. As a liberal arts college, Davidson is fertile ground for consideration of the ethical, political, social,
and economic dimensions of hunger. Davidson provides resources for examining the numerous facets of world hunger: many faculty members conduct
research in the area; the curriculum addresses the topic; and our library possesses extensive literature addressing hunger.

The Dean Rusk Program in International Studies has chosen world hunger as the topic for its first annual spring conference.
The conference will be held Tuesday and Wednesday, April 19th and 20th, in the Chambers Gallery. With financial assistance from
NCNB, the Rusk Program has been able to attract the following distinguished authorities: John Mellor, Director of the International Food
Policy Research Institute; Dean Freudenberger of the Claremont School of Theology; Ambassador Marshall Green, expert on population dynamics; Anne de
Lattre, Director of the Club du Sahel of the OECD in Paris; and Nevin Scrimshaw of M.I.T., and Jean-Pierre Habicht
of Cornell, experts on nutrition and health issues related to world hunger.

All members of the Davidson community should seize the opportunity to learn more about this important international issue. Faced with
such an opportunity for stimulating discussion, ignorance ceases to be innocent.

**Faculty compensation, tuition and the budget**
Wolfgang Christian

A recent article in The Davidsonian gives the impression that faculty compensation is a major cause for next year’s tuition
and fees increase. Without breaking the confidentiality of discussions within the Advisory Council for Finance Personnel and Development, I wish
to use data from documents available to the college community to make the case that faculty compensation adjustments were in
fact modest and to examine the forces that drive compensation increases so that faculty, administrators, students, and parents can better
understand the budget. Although I am secretary of the Advisory Council, the following opinions are my own and may not
be shared by the Council.

The link between tuition and compensation can be shown to be weak by a number of arguments. The 7.9% tuition
increase was, in fact, a poor revenue source when it comes to producing a balanced budget, since every 1% increase
in tuition currently produces a net increase in revenue of only $83,000. This low figure is due in part to
the fact that one third of the revenue raised is put back into financial aid. A more realistic procedure for
setting tuition, and one adopted by the Advisory Council, is that it should be determined by the needs of the
total college budget and by comparison with otherTop liberal arts colleges and that we should continue to meet all legitimate
financial need through our aid package. Whatever income is produced goes into the College budget along with other revenue sources
such as endowment income and annual fund. Next year the total budget, including auxiliary enterprises, for Davidson College will increase
from $25,446,620 to $29,236,946 while faculty compensation costs will increase from $5,912,139 to $6,363,493. Compensation costs have therefore decreased from
approximately 23% to 22% of the total budget. Clearly, faculty compensation increases haven't driven the budget any more than other
areas of the college. The compensation increases that have been arrived at have been determined not by seeing how much
tuition can be charged, but by following interrelated factors: (1) inflation, (2) a comparison with other schools of similar quality,
and (3) advancement in grade. I will attempt to estimate each effect. The effect of inflation on compensation is the
easiest number to arrive at since it can be tied roughly to the consumer price index which registered an increase
from 325.7 to 340.2 during the year ending in December of 1987. Inflation therefore contributed to about $263,000 to the
compensation increase.

The annual Professional Affairs Committee (PAC) report provides a basis for comparison with other colleges and, although it is an
administrative decision where we wish to place ourselves vis-a-vis other schools, Davidson is in the bottom 50% of many comparisons.
For example, one table shows that Davidson faculty compensation for all ranks is 8th out of the 12 colleges ranked
highly selective in admissions by Cass and Birnbaum, and another table places Davidson compensation 4th among North Carolina institutions. Assistant
professors were, however, last when ranked among highly selective colleges and 18th when compared to other North Carolina institutions. Davidson
was being outbid for young faculty and some adjustment in the salary scale had to be made in this year’s
budget, particularly at the lower end. The PAC report recommends faculty is only 43; 51 faculty are between 55 and
65. Assuming faculty retire at age 65, two faculty members per year will retire over the next four years, hardly
enough to provide advancement in grade for the remaining 108 faculty. The increase in the size of the faculty that
occurred in the 70’s has resulted in a large number of faculty members who are in the middle of their
academic careers and will expect advancement as their professional stature and contributions to the college grow. Providing some measure of
advancement is an issue of fairness and morale and will add about $100,000 a year to the compensation needs of
the college. I have shown that the $450,000 faculty compensation pool increase that could actually be budgeted for next year
was not out of line with legitimate needs. It should be clear that the problems I have outlined will continue
to challenge us in the coming years. I do not have any easy solutions, but Davidson should seriously consider letting
the student body increase to 1,600 (with sex-blind admissions) at a rate of 25-50 students per year while keeping the
administrative costs constant as a way of having an appreciable fraction of the budget devoted to instruction and scholarship. Slowly
adding young faculty to provide an acceptable student/faculty ratio would then smooth out the bump around 40 in the current
faculty age distribution. Such policy changes, together with an increase in endowment income and perhaps a retirement incentive program, would
do much to produce a rational compensation structure.
