Davidson Professors Highlight Coming November Gallery Crawl

By Will Montgomery

Two distinguished artists and Davidson Art professors, Herb Jackson and Russ Warren, are featured artists in the upcoming Gallery Crawl this Friday, November 1. For the unfamiliar, Gallery Crawl occurs every first Friday of the month through spring. Galleries in and around Spirit Square in Charlotte open their doors from six to eight p.m. to introduce the upcoming month’s exhibits. Typically, the evening is festive with crowds of visitors conversing and sampling wine and hors d’oeuvres as they migrate through exhibits.

Russ Warren’s show opens at the Hodges Taylor Gallery and runs through November 27. Warren is a highly acclaimed artist originally from Houston, Texas whose work was selected for the 1984 Venice Biennale and was shown last year in the North Carolina Triennial, among others. Dot Hodges, of Hodges Taylor Gallery, says that his work shows influences of Central American folk art, perhaps as a result of his Texan roots. Warren often distorts images of horses and bulls, and draws upon images from Hispanoamerica. Hodges mentions that his work demonstrates a balance between bestiality and humor. Part of the success of his imagery resides in his use of color, Hodges asserting that “his palette is very exciting.” Warren himself explains that an important part of his work comes through “playing with opposites.” Light and dark, cold and hot colors, or soft and harsh imagery set up contrasts and conflicts that energize the works. He comments that his work training horses influences his recent work.

When asked if there were special ideas to keep in mind when viewing his work, Warren said that he thinks great art is universally accessible and he doesn’t believe that a painting works if you have to have first read a book to understand it.

Herb Jackson is one of the premiere artists in North Carolina and the Southeastern United States. His show is currently exhibited at the Jerald Melberg Gallery and will run until November 16. Jackson describes his work as the record of an inward journey. Each painting contains over a hundred layers of paint, molded and scraped on top of the other. He uses acrylic paint mixed with ground pumice to construct these layers. The use of the pumice creates a gritty, powdery texture and as layers build upon layers, the painting takes on elements of sculpture. Jackson’s technique has been described as a type of excavation, where like the archaeologist, the artist moves in to uncover hidden information.

Jerald Melberg comments that the recent group of paintings being shown at Melberg Gallery have become more sculptured with the introduction of mica flakes. The mica flakes are larger, heavier, more geometrical, and in some cases the iridescence of the rock comes through the paint. Melberg mentioned that some visitors to the show have commented upon the intensity of color. Melberg somewhat agrees, but directs attention to the “quietness” of several paintings. These pieces are contemplative, with a serene and meditative quality. Plenty of room has been given between thepaintings to emphasize the spiritual resonance of the viewing experience. This Friday’s Gallery Crawl is an opportunity to see outstanding art and get into Charlotte for a change. Dinner in Charlotte before or after the Crawl always makes for a pleasant evening, especially this Friday since it is Parents Weekend. The Melberg Gallery is located at 119 E. Seventh Street across the street from Spirit Square. The Hodges Taylor Gallery is located at 227 N. Tryon Street and is one and a half blocks north of Spirit Square.

### Matt Bumstead: Whistlin’ Dixie

When Reba McEntire belted out her latest single from the stage of the Opry House a few weeks ago, millions watched; many of them cried. As Garth Brooks wailed and howled through “Shameless,” “The Thunder Rolls,” and “Friends in Low Places” in Winston-Salem on October 19, the crowd exploded. But they did so with uncommon zeal, with sheer joy, with an emotional frenzy akin to that which you see in films of The Beatles or Elvis in concert.

What is it, then, about country music that is so wrenching, that drives fans to make pilgrimages of thousands of miles just to catch a glimpse of their favorite artists, that drives me to write this column every week?

Well, there are a number of reasons. One is the ability of this genre of music to bring to life the song that the artist is performing. It is here that country music, for any thinking, feeling human being, triumphs completely. Songs are most often about love, winning it and losing it. Sometimes that love is for a family member; sometimes it is just for life itself.

Country can make you cry. With powerful lyrics and stirring vocals and instrumentals, these songs have the power to convey raw emotion to the listener to such a degree that the listener is completely given over. But it can also make you laugh. Or it can make you sing along, unable to keep from smiling at how fun the lyrics are. Next time you hit a Patterson Court party, look at people’s faces when they dance and sing to “Friends in Low Places.”
