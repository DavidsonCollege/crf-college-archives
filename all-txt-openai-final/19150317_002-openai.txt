EDITORIAL.

“He's a preacher, a man and a boy.” With this happy phrase were Dr. Graham's qualities once summed up when
he was pastor of the Presbyterian church here. His residence in Lexington since and his change of work has not
changed him, and Dr. Graham comes to the church this week for a series of special services with the same
freshness, vigor, earnestness, and appeal to old and young which characterized his former pastorate here. His friends of the town
have warmly welcomed him back, and much interest is being taken in the services. They will be a blessing and
inspiration to the community. Yet it must be remembered that one man, no matter how zealous and effective he may
be in his speaking, is powerless alone. He must have the support and interest and prayers of every man and
woman in the community. Only thus will the meetings this week be of lasting benefit to the life and ideals
of Davidson. It will be a privilege open to every Davidson man to come into contact with Dr. Graham and
form a friendship with this “man and boy” who has deep and sincere sympathy with the problems of our college
life, and who is willing to help us solve them with the aid of his experience of many years in
dealing with college students. Any time spent in attending the services this week and in learning to know Dr. Graham
will be richly rewarded.

time one of our men “pastes the pill." And it's well that we support our athletics in such grand style.
But is athletics the only side of our college that needs support? What about that Annual? Have you signed up
yet? Remember that the poor editor has toiled unceasingly for a year over the details of that publication; that the
manager has spoiled the classic beauty of his immaculate white walls with row on row of prosaic figures and that
every man on the staff has pulled out many a love lock in some fervid moment of inspiration. In all
seriousness, fellows, do you think that you show any college spirit when you try to get out of paying the
just price for a publication which has taken so much time and trouble? This week you are given a last
chance to obtain one of the best Annuals in the history of the college and to show your appreciation to
the men who have produced it. Take advantage of this opportunity.
