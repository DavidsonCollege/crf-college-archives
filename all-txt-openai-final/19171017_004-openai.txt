LECTURE ON CHINA GIVEN IN SHEARER HALL

Mrs. Gary Lee gave an interesting and instructive lecture on China, Saturday evening, October 13, in Shearer Hall. Mrs. Lee
was assisted in the program by several of the townspeople dressed as Chinese. Mrs. Lee spoke of four phases of
Chinese life—Industry, Economy, Temperance, and Stability.

“The marvellous economy of the Chinese is shown in the way they save on all things,” says Mrs. Lee. “Even
a single grain of rice is picked up by a small child. The children are trained in economy from the
time they can walk. Their diet is the simplest but very nourishing.”

China’s industry is unparalleled in the history of any nation. They make the most of everything. Every spare moment is
turned to some employment. Mrs. Lee attributes the great brains and strong bodies of the Chinese to their economy and
industry.

The Chinese are a very temperate people. Many years ago strong drink was wiped out of China by an order
of the Emperor. The opium trade was forced on her by England, with the sword and through the agency of
the East India Company, says Mrs. Lee.

“That China is peace-loving has been adequately shown in the present world-war. Her stability is unquestioned, because of her resources
and her industry. Her stability is compared to that of Stone Mountain, in Georgia.”

All through her talk Mrs. Lee showed her sense of humor by comparisons of manners and dress of the Chinese
to those of the Americans. She very humorously scored the present style of evening gowns worn by American women.

POTEAT SPEAKS TO THE Y. M. C. A.

“Christianity is in greater danger than it has ever been since the Saracen invasion,” Dr. Poteat, President of Furman University,
told those who were present at the Y. M. C. A. on Friday night. He related briefly his reasons for
believing this, and spoke of the great work that the Y. M. C. A. is doing among the men in
the camps of our country and elsewhere. He said that it, like nothing else, is giving to our fighting men
that touch of home and religion that keeps them clean and fearless.

As the outcome of the war means much to the cause of Democracy and Christianity, he showed that we must
do our part in keeping the work of the Y. M. C. A. going. He then told them of a
great campaign that is being launched throughout our country. He appealed to them as Davidson men to help the colleges
of the South raise their part, which is $100,000. And to do it with the same spirit of sacrifice that
our brothers have shown in entering this great war.

STEAM PIPE BEHIND RUMPLE IS REPLACED

Although the steam heating pipes of Rumple had been in service only ten years, it was found necessary to replace
the drain pipe. This necessitated the shutting off of the steam, but now everything is ready for the winter and
no more trouble is anticipated.
