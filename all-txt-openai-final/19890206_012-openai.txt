From WDAV, page 1  
15 quit school in mid-term days after the results were announced. I was a crack classical DJ myself. Our advisor would plead for us to play “nice” classical music for the late afternoon drive-time and dinner hours. I always made sure she received the very latest in fine classical music: Penderecki, Schoenberg’s twelve-tone works, Ginastera’s microtonal string quartets, Ives’ Concord Sonata, perhaps a nice opera by Anton Berg. If it was background music you wanted, I was your man. But I digress. The station went from 10 to 18:40 in the fall of 1978. Because we could not afford remote monitors at that time, students took turns babysitting the transmitter in its shack near Lake Norman while their colleagues were at the board. More than a few romances began out there before we hooked up the remote controls in the summer of 1978. I was on the air with Lea Walker ’79 when the so-called “mutiny” took place. After the Trustees announced that the station would no longer be run or staffed by the student body, then-Station Manager Carrington Thompson ordered that all equipment bought with student funds be removed and turned over to the SGA, in the hope that a second station could be set up for the students. I have visited WDAV-FM’s new studios and heard its programs. WDAV-FM “as we know it today” did not begin in December of 1978. It began much, much earlier. WDAV-FM would not exist today were it not for the hard work of literally hundreds of Davidson students from 1969 to 1978. Incidentally, I think you may still have our old broadcast equipment around somewhere....

Sincerely Yours,  
Sidney R. Barrett, Jr. ’79  
Station Manager 1976-1978
