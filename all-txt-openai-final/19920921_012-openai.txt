THE THEME SONG

Sung to the tune of “My Favorite Things” from The Sound of Music.

Biting on tin foil, dog farts and foot fungus,
high impact SS, etc., stung us,
these are a few of the things I think suck.

Bee stings and back zits and pesty bee stings,
a life-threatening bone-crushing wreck with a truck,
these are a few of the things I think suck.
When hung-over, when the grades stink,
when I'm feeling sad, I simply
remember some things that suck worse,
and then I don't feel so bad!

Burning your mouth on a hot piece of pizza,
calling her Nancy when her name's really Lisa,
taking a leak and having no luck,
these are a few of the things I think suck.

Met heads and bed heads,
these are a few of the things I think suck.

When the car dies, when the pipes burst,
a big wooden splinter,
licking a pole in the middle of winter,
when I'm feeling sad, I simply
remember some things that suck worse,
and then I don't feel so bad!
