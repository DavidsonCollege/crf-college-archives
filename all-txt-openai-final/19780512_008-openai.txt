compiled by Linda Hoopes

JOEL SHIRK, as Johan Johan, together with Jake Darby as Tib and Richard Devon as Sir Johan the Preest, will follow the Medieval Dinner with their presentation of "A Very Merry Play."

'Merry England' recreated by authentic dinner, play

This Saturday night, May 13th, the Heraldic and Genealogical Society, in conjunction with the Davidson College Union Minorities Committee and the Committee on Cultural Events, will present a medieval banquet (in the mode of sixteenth-century England) and a contemporary (i.e., fifteenth-century) play interlude.

The bill of fare will include such varied items as Carnelyne (a beef pie with cranberries, currants, honey, and spice), lemonwhyt (lemon rice with almonds and peas cooked in white wine and honey), and charwordon (pears cooked in ale and seasoned with honey). Beverages will include beer and spiced wine.

The play, which will follow the banquet, will be "A Very Merry Play Betwene Johan Johan the Husbande, Tib, his Wyfe, and Sir Johan, the Preest." It is a Tudor "moral interlude," a satire of contemporary sexual mores on the eve of the Reformation.

Festivities will begin at 6:30 p.m. in the 900 Room. Tickets, $3.50 per person, are available at the Union Desk.

British students offer a different type of play

By CAROL LOPTSON
Staff Writer

The play Gotcha, by Barry Keefe, will be presented on Friday, May 12 and Saturday, May 13, at 7:30 p.m. in Cunningham Fine Arts Building. Direct from London, the workshop production focuses on the alienation and lack of identity of a working-class London youth.

It stars Rusk Scholars Tom Cairns in the lead role, Liz Woodham-Smith and Kerry McQuade, and Davidson student Jim Humphries. Rusk Scholar Simon Curtis is directing the play. Tickets are 50 cents.

"It's a hard-hitting play with a lot of dramatic impact, although it is humorous at times. This is a good opportunity to see a different type of play," said Humphries. "It's a pretty daring play."
