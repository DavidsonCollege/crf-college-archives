THE DAVIDSONIAN

Before he was Dr. Evil

“So I Married an Axe Murderer” reviewed

By Kye Erikson
Staff Writer

Do you think you have a rough life? Are the tests and the papers starting to get to you? Well, if they are, I have something to say—it could be worse. Your dad could be a verbally abusive drunk who does nothing but walk around without pants, glorifying Scotland. Then there are the possibilities that your mother could hit on your best friend, your brother could have a head the size of an orange on a toothpick, and you could be engaged to an axe murderer.

Of course, this is not the lifestyle of the average Davidson student, but if you have no idea what I am talking about yet, you have some homework to do. It is time to bone up on your knowledge of classic films. I am talking about Mike Myers' breakthrough film “So I Married an Axe Murderer.”

This slapstick comedy recounts the relationship between Charlie (Myers) and Harriet (Nancy Travis), the apple of his eye. However, these two have no ordinary relationship. Charlie has a problem—he compulsively breaks up with his girlfriends for reasons ranging from kleptomania to an overpowering odor of beef and vegetable. It seems as though Charlie might finally be getting over his fear of relationships as he grows closer to Harriet.

Unfortunately, Charlie’s paranoia reaches a new level when he visits the washroom and sees in the Weekly World News an article which his mother mentioned earlier about a woman who married men and then murdered them on her honeymoon. There were a total of three former husbands. They all lived in various places and had various professions, from a lounge singer in Atlantic City to a Russian Martial Arts expert in Miami. Charlie immediately thinks that Harriet is the honeymoon killer by putting the pieces of her life together with the article. He tries to break off the relationship.

When Charlie finally breaks up with Harriet, he regrets his decision. He makes it up to her with a window-side poem. On their honeymoon, Charlie begins to get suspicious and the plot reaches its peak. What follows is a rooftop scuffle and a surprise ending.

I highly recommend this film. It is not only a classic, but the roots of newer Mike Myers characters can be seen in it. It is easy to perceive Wayne in Charlie’s sarcastic remarks to a waitress in a coffee shop. Dr. Evil also surfaces in this movie in facial expressions of Charlie as he listens to his father’s drunken rambling about a head with its own solar system or about his hatred of the one and only Colonel.

If you have not seen “So I Married an Axe Murderer,” go out and watch it today. Put aside those silly problem sets, and forget about those papers. Most importantly, don’t worry about any remaining midterms; there is one more after it. Go out and rent it today.
