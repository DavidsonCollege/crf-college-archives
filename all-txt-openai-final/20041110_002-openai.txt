Women’s Committee hosts
‘Corporate Ladder’ talk

possibility of on-campus
day care facility

The Davidson Women’s Committee hosted
“Climbing the Corporate Ladder in a Skirt” last
Thursday in Chambers Gallery.

Shannon McFayden ’82 and Lynn Ford ’84,
female executives from Wachovia in Charlotte,
described their career path to an audience of
Davidson College female students. McFayden
and Ford discussed their experiences involving
the balance between a career and a family,
and larger issues such as gender inequality in
the workplace.

Associate Director of Career Services
Monica White opened the talk with her per-
sonal thoughts on gender in the workplace and
shared statistics which confirmed the existence
of gender inequality.

“There is progress being made and that is
important, but it is also important to know that
there is still a gap,” she said.

McFayden, a psychology major at Davidson,
fell into banking after a mock-interview ses-
sion with an executive at First Union in Char-
lotte. She married a Davidson graduate and her
career caused them to move from Charlotte to
Florida for a period of eleven years.

“I loved my job but it was causing me to travel
all of the time and it was horrible being away
from my children,” said McFayden.

The family moved back to North Carolina
and McFayden now serves as Senior Execu-
tive Vice President and Head of Corporate and
Community Affairs at Wachovia in Charlotte.
Her husband is now a stay-at-home dad.

Lynn Ford, also a psychology major at
Davidson, began at Wachovia in Winston-Sa-
lem.

“I was interested in how psychology mani-
fested itself in the workplace,” said Ford.

Ford eventually moved to Wachovia in Char-
lotte and married a fellow banker. She contin-
ues to work at Wachovia and the business she
focuses on deals with retirement.

Her husband currently works out of their
home and has the flexibility to take care of their
daughter while Ford is at work.

McFayden and Ford shared their personal
encounters with gender discrimination at the
workplace and offered their advice to Davidson
College women on how to handle this sort
of discrimination.

“It was great to find two women who are
managing the corporate world and their fami-
lies and hear stories about what kinds of ob-
stacles they have encountered along the way
in their careers and homes,” said Meredith
Lorenz ’05, co-president of the Women’s Com-
mittee.

The Women’s Committee hosted numerous
events this fall and has big plans for the spring.

They hosted an intimate discussion about
sexuality with Georgia Ringle early in the fall
and a luncheon with the cast of “Love of the
Nightingale,” which focused on the issues of
rape, incest, and sexual assault that exist in the
play.

The organization also supports the possibil-
ity of a day care facility on campus.

“The Trustees and Bobby Vagt are consider-
ing a day care facility for faculty, staff, and com-
munity members,” said Lauren Heinz ’07.

Locations are currently being considered and
the day care could provide a chance for biol-
ogy and psychology student research, as well
as work study positions.
