ALL-AMERICAN FOOTBALL TEAM NOTES

“To him who in love of nature holds Communion with her visible forms she speaks a various language; for his
gayer hours she has a voice of gladness and a smile and eloquence of beauty, and she glides.”

Leopold Stokowski, conductor of the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra, reserves the right to pique the wonder of his audiences. Despite their
rabid disapprobation of ultra-modern music, Mr. Stokowski has avowed his determination to play what he chooses, and urges his listeners
to be more tolerant toward present-day music.

The selection of an All-American football team is a favorite detail of our national sport. Who, at one time or
another, has not picked a team that he or she would back against the world? Mr. Grantland Rice makes an
annual choice that is regarded by many as “official.” So do many other lesser-known experts. But any selection must always
be open to criticism. In the first place, it is rather difficult to totally suppress any partisan feeling that might
tend to influence the view; or emotional frenzy of the instant, or disappointment, or personal prejudices that have a distinct
place in the breast and often affect the reasoning of every football fan. In the second place, the average fan
has the privilege of witnessing only a very few outstanding teams in action. Consequently, his perspective is indeed very limited
and his ultimate choice must depend upon the press account of the various games throughout the season, and upon the
records of the separate teams and individuals. In the third place, every football season is so full of high spots;
there are so many moments of raw drama, so many bids for fame and glory that in the last analysis
personal opinion must figure largely in the final rating.

Times have changed since the era of the late Walter Camp's All-American lineups, which read like the rosters of the
Yale, Princeton, and Harvard teams. In the last decade, the West and South have risen to challenge the time-honored supremacy
of the East. In the above tabulation, it is interesting to note that the personnel of the two all-star elevens
hail from widely distributed sections of the country. There are seven mid-westerners, ten easterners, four far-westerners, and one southerner.

Suppose we begin with the backfield. Public interest naturally focuses on the men who carry the ball and is prone
to overlook the flashy play of heroic linesmen who make the “holes” for their luckier mates. Just here let us
explain the absence of the name of one of the greatest football players of recent years—Al Marsters. Only the irony
of fate, in the guise of an injured spine in mid-season, prevents consideration of Dartmouth’s brilliant ace. “Special Delivery” Al—at
the time of his injury, prior to which he had played in eight games—had passed, plunged, and run roughshod over
some of the most outstanding teams in the East to score 108 points and lead the nation in scoring. A
victim of hard luck, cut down at the zenith of his playing prowess, he saw his dream of leading the
East’s team against the West in California on New Year’s Day culminate in a hospital cot in Hanover.

Pause a moment and consider our first-string backfield—Cagle, Uansa, Musick, and Carideo. Surely no one can offer an appreciable criticism
of this great quartet. As an aftermath of Chris Cagle’s meteoric career last year, certain sports writers have shown a
tendency to minimize his achievements during the campaign just passed. Jealous critics have openly avowed that he was a mere
“flash in the pan.” Such statements distort the truth. Despite Army’s comparatively poor showing this season, Cagle’s great all-around play
has been strikingly evident in every contest. Cagle was good enough to make the All-American grade for the past two
years—a time when great backs were all too many. It might have been expected that he was due for a
let-up this season. It is extremely difficult to maintain perfect form for three years in a row—but let the records
speak for themselves. The Cadets’ two defeats at the hands of Illinois and Yale, and the tie game with Harvard,
were marked by the running, passing, and plunging of this red-headed, loose-jointed human greyhound “Red” Cagle.

When the University of Pittsburgh's great juggernaut takes the field, the ghost of the original “Galloping Ghost,” Red Grange, streaks
up and down the gridiron in the person of Toby Uansa. Without a doubt, this fleet-footed youngster is the greatest
broken-field runner in present-day intercollegiate football. Uansa gets into motion with chain lightning speed. He never hesitates; never pauses too
long in picking openings. When he runs and tacklers hurl themselves at him, he shakes a hip this way, or
that way, shimmies along to one side or the other—just how are you going to stop a guy like that?
Running back kickoffs for touchdowns seems to be his hobby. His sensational play has been a consistent highlight of the
Panther’s drive toward the national championship and his brilliant ball-toting alone merits him an undisputed place on this year’s mythical
eleven.

Jim Musick, of Southern California, draws the fullback assignment by virtue of his all-around ability. At hammering a line, he
ranks with Ernie Nevers, Stanford star of a few years ago. Musick ripped Notre Dame's line to shreds in Chicago
this fall, but Rockne’s 1929 edition of “The Four Horsemen” galloped to touchdowns faster than Musick could count them by
the battering-ram method. Weighing 195 pounds and standing six feet tall, his is the ideal build to back up a
line—which he did with crushing finality. Add his exceptional ability as a kicker and passer and you have the basis
for his choice.

Only the presence of Musick keeps Parkinson, rated above Uansa by many Smoky City fans, off our first eleven. Like
his Southern California rival, he is a husky chap—a human pile-driver, who was a constant threat to Pittsburgh’s opponents. As
a big factor in all of the Panther victories, he consistently crashed through opposing lines on spinner plays for long
gains. A good blocker, a sure tackler, his defensive work was on a par with that of any fullback in
the country.

McEver is, without a doubt, the greatest halfback that ever wore the colors of Tennessee. Short of stature, with beetling
brows and bowed legs, dubbed the “Wild Bull” by sports writers, he is one of the fastest moving ball carriers
in the nation. Perhaps the most remarkable thing about him is his supreme confidence in himself.Although not of a boastful
nature, he frankly admits that he can perform surprising feats on the gridiron. And usually he is right. McEver is
the spark-plug of a grid machine that has been unbeaten in three years—the leading scorer in the Southern Conference—the gridiron’s
“pinch-hitter” in whose heels lies destruction. Purdue University’s brilliant backfield terrorized “Big Ten” opponents in its march toward the 1929
conference title. For the third consecutive year ‘Pest’ Welch lived up to his nickname with a vengeance. Best known for
his great showing against Harvard two years ago, this package of dynamite had his greatest season this fall. Equally adept
at hitting the line or running interference; possessing an uncanny sense for diagnosing opponent’s plays; an accurate forward passer, a
talented kicker, a dashing broken field runner. What more can we say? It’s tantalizing to omit such backs as Elder,
Hewitt, Bergherm, Lom, Banker, Karcis, Glasgow, Pharmer, Savoldi, Masters, Murrell, Clifton and a host of others too numerous to mention.
But what can we do when places are so limited? Who but Frank Carideo, Knute Rockne’s unruffled field-general, could logically
lead this all-star group? Let Carideo’s bid for a place rest on his team’s present unblemished record—a noteworthy achievement that
was due in a large measure to his own faultless generalship. A great quarterback must necessarily possess all of the
vital qualities of leadership, a chess mind, uncanny judgment, an inspiring personality. But Carideo is more than a mere master
mind. In addition to his genius as a leader, he can do everything—punt, drop-kick, place-kick, pass, hit the line, skirt
the ends—just what else can you expect from one man? Carideo had to be good to outrank such star pilots
as Holman, Simral, Putnam, French, Wittman, Eisan, Saunders, Wood and Booth. Any one of these men is a logical choice
to lead the second team, but we think that Albie Booth deserves that honor.

“The Outlook and Independent” (New York), among others, derides the “spoiled darling’s” piquancy and observes that many other outstanding conductors
mix modernism in their programs with no fuss about it. “Truth is,” says “The Outlook and Independent,” “Stokowski dearly loves
his little sensation. Three years ago, to rebuke late-comers, he played an entire program with members of his orchestra straggling
on and off the platform. The following year he elected to conduct in a darkened hall, with a single amber
light above his shapely head. This season, ticket-holders who arrive late must wait forty-five minutes in the lobby and enter
after the intermission.” Not all famous men are great enough to humble the world’s greatest orchestra, and this may have
gone to his head, but common sense should remind him that his listeners are paying his salary, and that he
is, therefore, a public servant. And in polite society, public servants, and otherwise, do not wholly ignore their employer's wishes.

We receive news that Ignace Paderewski’s engagement to play in Charlotte in January has been cancelled, owing to the pianist’s
ill health. Paderewski has always been a favorite in music circles, and it is to be regretted that Charlotte and
vicinity will miss this opportunity of hearing so great a master. He made his first appearance in America in 1891
at Carnegie Hall. His American concerts were frequent thereafter until the World War, at which time he became interested in
political affairs of his own country, Poland. In 1917 he raised considerable sums of money and offered the United States
an army of 100,000 men and 50 trained officers. In 1919 he was elected premier of Poland, and the Polish
Republic was thereupon recognized by the Allied Council at Paris. After the war, Paderewski again took up his music. He
continued playing and composing and made more American tours. Plans for his latest tour have been frustrated by his illness.
His major compositions are two operas, a symphony, a sonata, and Variations and Fugue for piano.

In view of the fact that there are many students who desire to acquire an appreciation of music but who
cannot fit the course in History and Appreciation of Music into their programs, Professor Cullum has formulated plans for a
series of lecture-recitals to be given in the Donie Room of Chambers, presumably in the evening. All interested students are
invited to attend these meetings, and no one need fear the word “lecture,” for, according to Professor Cullum, there will
be less talking and more music. The Music Department has many victrola recordings which will be put to appropriate use
in the course. As yet the date of the first lecture-recital has not been announced.

Into his darker musings with a mild And healing sympathy that steals away The sharpness ere he is aware.” —
Bryant.

Nature is the goddess of all things. Every act of man can be traced to her own mind; each thought
man holds; each love that speaks to him; these let fall clues leading at last to Nature’s lair. The spirits
of heaven and hell obey that bidding. Sometimes they rise in anger, sweep away the impotent insect called man, and
laugh at his futile endeavors to resist; again they sway tongues as harbingers of excellent beauty. Fertility is the goddess
and Nature is her name. From this old earth have come all great creations; paintings, poetry, beauty, life: patches of
brown, black, green, like an intersected filigree of lightness and dark. The sustenance of man comes from Nature; his food,
his plowshares, his weapons, his gold, his clothing, the covering for his home, even unto his life.

In 1837 when the college was founded, Dr. Hall Morrison was appointed president and as his assistant, Thomas Robinson. Mr.
Robinson was steward as well as superintendent. He realized that expenses could be lessened by using college property to raise
foodstuffs and cotton. So a system was founded whereby each student was fed from the college farm, and a little
income was brought in through the sale of cotton.

“Look to the rose that blows about us—Lo, Laughing, she says, into the world I blow: At once the silken
tassel of my purse Tear, and its treasures on the garden throw.”

There are two things in the life of every man: cash and credit. Cash is the price he pays in
today; credit is the sum he leaves for the tomorrow. It is his interest; his accounting; his reward. Ability is
the catafalque of credit; reward is the ciborium of ability; ability, reward, credit are the sodality. Shadows creep over the
whole world, crawl in, crawl out. Deep shadows, dense as the fog of the thousand seas, wavering as the mind
of love, long as the expression of infinity. And they are the networks of nature: here is happiness, here sorrow:
there is love, here hate; there is life, here death. Eternities of growing shades, lavish in their distribution of checkered
fates. Shadows creep out, coil back; writhe on, die out, gain power, seek life, lounge on and on, and man
goes as the shadows go; driven as the shadows are driven; obeys nature as the shadows.
