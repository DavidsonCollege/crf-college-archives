Wildkittens Lose Again As Duke Wins Fast Game
Duke Freshmen Win by Score of 26-12 as Bird Stars for Visitors

The Duke University Freshmen swamped the Wildkittens in their own lair Thursday night and reeked revenge for the oft-repeated triumphs
of Davidson over the Methodists. The final score of the game was 26 to 12, which pictured accurately the difference
between the playing of the two teams. Lead by a flashy, red-headed Bird, who scored five field goals, more than
the entire Davidson quint, Duke took the lead from Davidson after they had run the score up to Davidson 6,
Duke 2. The first half ended with the Methodists leading by one field goal at 8-6. It was in the
first of the second period that the visitors showed their real form, scoring eight consecutive field goals and running the
score up to 24-8 before the Davidson crew could locate the basket from the field. Crawford, Davidson's captain, after leading
a rather futile long-distance attack, connected with two neat shots in the last few minutes of play, starting what looked
like a neat rally. The scoring of Duke with the exception of Bird was very evenly divided, each of five
other men getting one or more field goals, Gattling being next to Bird with five points. He and Candler stood
out as two exceptional guards, while Leftwich for Davidson also looked best at this position. The line-up and summary follow:

Davidson Fresh (12) Pos. Duke Fresh (26)
Hunt (2) ----------------- L.F. ----------------- Bird (10)
Kerr (2) ----------------- R.F. ----------------- Adams (2)
Crawford (C) (8) --------- C. ----------------- Rowe (C) (2)
Leftwich ----------------- L.G. ----------------- Gattling (5)

for Carruthers, Bawer for Gattling. Field goals: Davidson 4, Duke 12; foul goals, Davidson 4 out of 6; Duke 2

SPORTOGRAPHS
By Ernest Milton

We've had a number of athletic contests at Davidson for the past week or two, and now we are to
go lacking for a while. The wrestling team is up in Virginia now, with the University of Virginia to be
met tonight, and V. P. I. Saturday night. The freshmen are away on a trip. Last night they played Oak
Ridge. Tonight they are handling State, or vice versa. Friday night the little Deacons have a second chance at the
yearlings. And Saturday night the Duke team will entertain them on their home court. Furthermore, there might be a game
somewhere in North Carolina with another team Monday night, so Manager Christenbury remarked before leaving.

After the game here with Furman Saturday night the Wildcat varsity team will start toward the Southern regions, meeting Clemson
on Monday night, Furman on Tuesday, and Wofford on Wednesday, at Clemson, Greenville and Spartanburg, respectively, all ensconced in the
Sandlapper State. Only a day of rest is allowed them, and the Wildcats start another journey of more potency, because
of state significance. The State Techmen will cavort with the Wildcats in Raleigh on the night of February 20. With
Sunday sandwiched in their schedule, Duke at Durham February 22, Carolina at Chapel Hill and Wake Forest at Wake Forest
follow on consecutive nights.

Thus devotees of sportdom can watch the spring football practice and give their moral support to the coaches. The squad
is diminishing in size. We suggested that some of the aspirants show more of that “sticktoitiveness.” Grammarians are asked not
to consider the word just used. We are aiming at the thought.

It won't be football alone long, for Coach Tex Tilson says that the baseball men are going to be called
for duty the middle of this month, with Captain Frank Alford in charge. Then you can listen to the crack
of the bat, which intermingled with the thud of bodies in impact will keep music in the air on Sprunt
Field. Add to that the tramp of the track men, and you'll have the spring schedule complete. The cinder path
men, and the field event men are to be issued an invitation the middle of the shortest month in the
year, simultaneously.With the urge on the baseball players, by the way, we hope students have not forgotten that we are
to have a state high school track meet here this spring. The one of last year was merely a starter,
insignificant as compared with the one that is being planned for this year. Everybody was new at the game of
handling such a meet, but the announcement was made last year that never again would there be any confusion whatsoever,
and that before the first pistol shot of the event occurred, every minute detail would have been arranged, and that
students would know what to expect before they come to Davidson for this occasion. Urge that high school of yours
back home to be well represented here, and if it is a small high school, ask them to send along
what they have. Competition will be keen, and the gathering interesting. The more the merrier, as the old adage goes.

We hesitate to comment on the freshman team this week. In the Duke game, our hopes were still left, even
though the Methodist yearlings won. But after the Wake Forest game, we wonder what the final result will be. Extensive
comment is deferred until after the state trip. We suggest that a little more life be shown on the court,
that they move around a great deal more than they do, and that they work together as a team, and
not as individual players, trying to see how much honor each one can get.

Davidson Wrestlers Win 29-0 From Concord Team
Coach Weems Withholds Letter Men for Virginia Trip—Others Winning Each Match

Last Monday night, the Davidson wrestling team won a hard-fought match from the Concord “Y” team by the score of
29-0. The score tells a different tale from the real events of the match. As a matter of fact, the
Davidson team had extreme difficulty in winning all of the matches. The Davidson team was composed entirely of non-letter men,
which made the match more even. Mauldin made the best showing of the evening, throwing his opponent in two minutes
and eight seconds. Cole was Concord’s best man, losing his match to Bohannon by a time of two minutes and
fifteen seconds. Four of the matches were won on falls and three on time.

Intermixed with the wrestling matches were three boxing bouts. These proved to be the greatest feature of the evening. The
match between Dick Flynn and Dick Grey was especially fast and furious. The others, however, did not fall far short
of this one.

115 pound class—McLeod, of Davidson, won from Deaten, of Concord, by a time decision of eight minutes.
125 pound class—Flythe, of Davidson, won from Wallace, of Concord, by a time decision of seven minutes and fifty-two seconds.
135 pound class—Hansel, of Davidson, won from Wallace, of Concord, by a fall in eight minutes and six seconds.
145 pound class—Garrison, of Davidson, won from Bruton, of Concord, by a fall in five minutes and thirty seconds.
158 pound class—Bohannon, of Davidson, won from Cole, of Concord, by a time decision of two minutes and fifteen seconds.
175 pound class—Crinkley, of Davidson, won from Hoover (captain), of Concord, by a fall in three minutes and fifteen seconds.
Heavyweight class—Mauldin, of Davidson, won from Erwin, of Concord, by a fall in two minutes and eight seconds.

The three boxing matches were three-round affairs. The first two matches had two-minute rounds and the last had minute and
a half rounds. Crawford won from Embrey in the first match by a clear decision. In the second bout, Kearns
won from Copeland. The third bout between Grey and Flynn was very close.

Reports are current that we might get two of the best high school athletes in North Carolina, and at the
same time two of the finest men in the state. Their first choice is Davidson, and we hope that it
will be the ultimate choice. One of their classmates made the remark that they are not the type of men
to accept in- E. & J. Burke, Ltd. Sole Agents U. S. and Canada Long Island City, N. Y.
