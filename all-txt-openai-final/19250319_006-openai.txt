Keen Competition Causes Change in Wildcat Championship Chances

The prospects for the Wildcat varsity baseball team are brightening as the season progresses and the squad rounds into shape.
Early in the season, it was announced that there was scant hope for a pennant, but keen competition for every
position has changed the outlook. Everyone is inclined to believe that Davidson will be a strong contender for state honors.

Several strong men from last year are missing, but Coach Younger is gratified at the showing the new men are
making for these positions. Probably the weakest spot of the team will be in the pitching department, as Flake Laird
is the only veteran hurler to don the Red and Black uniform. Ogden and Hampton are showing up the best
from the new men who are trying out for pitcher.

Under the willow, we find Sim Wrenn and Sam Summers staging a hot battle for the catching position. Wrenn is
a veteran at the business and will probably secure the position.

The position that is being fought for the hardest is first base. Frank Alford is showing up well at first,
and Abe Kugler is also staging a merry battle on the initial sack. Frank is a terrible hitter and Woodham
is also in the running.The captain of last year’s Fresh outfit is a beautiful fielder and handles himself like a
veteran. He will either play first or second and bear the brunt of the receiving. He seems to be sure
of a place; he is a veteran and a mean hitter. Davis, McConnell, Welts, Alford, and Laird will be the
ones from whom the varsity fields will be selected. All the applicants out are fighting for a berth, and when
the season opens and the umpire shouts “play ball!” there will be nine fighting, snarling Wildcats in there fighting until
the last man is out in the ninth. Captain Teddy Covington is leading all contestants for third base. Covington is
well-nigh a perfect fielder and a good hitter in the pinches. Sion Alford seems to have shortstop pretty well sewed
up. Simpson and Kimbrough are staging a hot contest. In the field, Harry Vance is the most sure of a
place.

METHOD FOR CHOOSING TENNIS TEAM CHANGED

Davidson tennis is taking a forward step in throwing away the old method of running the tennis team and selecting
from the student body a squad of twelve men from whom the team will be selected before each meet. The
four men, Price, Beall, Staley, and Trotter, were placed upon this squad as were McCutcheon, Dick Carr, and Crosland who
showed up well last year. Wood Brown and Wells are scheduled to play for one place upon the squad as
are Lockhart and Roland Parker. Then these twelve men will engage in a “Round-robin” tournament in which each plays the
other one match, the final standing determining who will represent Davidson. This tournament will be run off as soon as
the weather permits. The fourth man of the squad will always be open to a challenge from the others.

Ford Dealer for facts regarding a convenient plan of payment. Alexander won out over Red Ay varsity idea in the
back of your head that you need a “tux”? Probably you’re right—most young fellows do need one nowadays. We’ve some
new ideas, too—in tuxedos. Coats with shawl collars or notched lapels. Lustrous fabrics of black flannel, worsted, or herringbone. Black
vests of brocaded silks—white ones of pique, silk poplin, and bengaline. Shirts, ties, studs, socks, shoes, and hats to complete
the outfit.

MRS. BAKER (Continued from page 1)

In addition to concert work in New York City, Mrs. Baker was for two years choral director in the Finch
School, a very exclusive conservatory on Fifth Avenue, and later was the vocal director at Mrs. Dow's School. Mrs. Baker
came to Charlotte nine years ago and was for three years choral director at Queens College. She later established her
own private studio and during the past few years has been developing some of the most popular voices in Charlotte.
As a chorus and choir director, she has been eminently successful. During her stay in Charlotte, she has been director
of the chorus choir of Hawthorne Lane Church, Second Presbyterian Church choir, Ivey chorus, Carolina Concert Club, and Charlotte Musical
Art Club.
