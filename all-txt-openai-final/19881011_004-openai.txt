### Tuesday, October 11, 1988 THE DAVIDSONIAN EXTRA

#### SAIL INTO OUR NEW DAVIDSON OFFICE

First Charter National Bank, headquartered in Concord, N.C., is having a Grand Opening to celebrate its arrival in Davidson and the Lake Norman area. And you're invited to join.

We'll start celebrating with a ribbon-cutting at 8:45 a.m. on Monday, September 26. We'll be serving doughnuts, sausage biscuits, juice, and coffee — and we'd love for you to come. If you can’t make the ribbon-cutting, simply drop in any time during the Grand Opening (regular banking hours); we'll be serving coffee, punch, and cookies. Plus, while our supply lasts, we'll have colorful balloons for the young folks accompanied by an adult.

#### Free Gifts For New Accounts. Banking’s a Beach at First Charter.

Throughout our Grand Opening, we'll be offering you your choice (while supplies last) of any one of three great gifts — a deluxe custom beach towel, a no-slip porcelain boat mug, or a roomy, rayon/canvas boat tote — when you open a First Charter personal checking or savings account with $500 or more. Towels, mugs, and totes will be on display in our lobby during the Grand Opening to help you with your decision.

#### Grand Prize Drawing

Our Davidson Grand Opening will culminate with a Grand Prize Drawing to be held Friday, October 14, at 6 p.m. The prize? A fabulous, 2-seater Zuma sailboat. Get all the exciting details at the bank.

#### Do Plan To Join Us — And Bank The Way You Prefer.

Through opening an office in Davidson, First Charter takes another step in demonstrating a commitment to offer you an alternative in financial services. For you in the Davidson/Lake Norman area, it means you now have a strong, well-managed, independent bank. We're “local folks” dedicated to helping you bank the way you prefer. Lawrence Kimbrough, President of First Charter, was born in Davidson, graduated from Davidson College, and resides in Davidson. Mike Mittelman, Branch Manager for our new Davidson office, is also a resident of Davidson. He has over 11 years of banking experience in Davidson where townspeople and students alike have counted upon Mike for sound financial counsel. Lawrence, Mike, and all their associates at First Charter look forward to seeing you during our Grand Opening and to serving you for many years to come.
