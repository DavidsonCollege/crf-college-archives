Dear Mom and Dad,
You'll never believe what a great place it is here at Camp Davidson. All the guys on my hall are
real nice. We have so many activities. We went swimming in Lake Norman yesterday and had a mixer with the
girl campers last night (Me and Joey snuck outside to shoot off fireworks).

We have arts and crafts classes every day. We also have sports and science. We made some ice cream and
sang songs in Chemistry class yesterday! Boy that was fun! (Joey wanted to throw it at the girls.) My counselors
also showed a new kind of fingerpainting. They called it ‘abstrakt’.

They’ve got a new golf course here, too! Me and Joey are practicing so we can beat Dad when we
get back to the Club. Maybe Dad can come down here and play on Parents’ Weekend. Make sure to tell
him not to drive on the grass. Mr. Silver gets real mad when people do that. Mr. Barrel says that
pretty soon we'll get a new gym and that it might even have indoor tennis courts. The whole family could
play tennis on Parents’ Weekend.

They have a real nice rifle range, too. I wanted to join, but my camp counselor says I have to
be 12 years and wear a uniform. There’s no dress code at Camp Davidson, but it seems that almost everyone
wears a shirt with the name of another camp on it.

The mess hall is real nice, too. There’s enough room to fly a kite in there. The food’s not too
good, but they make great jello (Joey says it's good for throwing at girls).

Almost forgot! They do my laundry too. And now they even paint our rooms. No more messy do-it-yourself painting. Our
counselors are just like big brothers. And Uncle Will, he’s my Biiiigggg brother. And of course, there’s Aunt Sue.

They're taking real good care of me at Camp Davidson.

Love,
Dennis
P.S. Send plenty of brownies!
