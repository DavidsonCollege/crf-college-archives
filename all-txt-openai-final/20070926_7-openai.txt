Getting acquainted with Brando?

By MIKE WELLMAN
Arts & Living Editor

Marlon Brando may be one of the most influential actors ever to have graced the screens of Hollywood. Nominated seven times for Best Actor by the Academy and winning twice, Brando was world-renowned for his raw screen presence, his antics in the backlot, and his influence on American culture over his almost half-century-long career.

Brando made headlines when, as a means of protesting the depiction of Native Americans in film, he became the second actor to refuse to accept an Oscar after he won Best Actor for his performance in “The Godfather.”

Brando crusaded for the civil rights movement, the rights of Native Americans, and the Jewish Zionist movement. If you’re in the mood for powerful drama and great acting, then these Marlon Brando movies may be perfect for you.

A Streetcar Named Desire — One of Brando’s earlier movies, “Streetcar” was his breakout performance. In this adaptation of Tennessee Williams' famed play, “Streetcar” tells the story of Blanche Dubois, a fragile and desperate woman who arrives on her sister’s doorstep in a state of panic after losing her family’s plantation. The frenzied emotions of a woman attempting to escape her past and the brutish, conniving nature of Brando’s Stanley Kowalski create tension at every turn. Stanley’s interactions with Blanche and his anguish-filled cries of “Stella” are what old Hollywood is made of.

On the Waterfront — Another film directed by Elia Kazan, Waterfront tells the story of a simpleton ex-boxer who moves from the ring to working as a small-time crook for the corrupt boss of a dockers’ union. Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando) falls in love with the sister of a man he unwittingly helped kill, and the conflicting senses of morality and justice move him to reconsider his life and fight back. With the drama of an unfolding underworld of corruption and Brando’s pensive, charming nature, I consider this Brando’s best performance.

Apocalypse Now — Directed by Francis Ford Coppola (“The Godfather”), “Apocalypse” retells the story of “Heart of Darkness” in the context of the Vietnam War. Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) is sent on a mission to eliminate a renegade military outpost led by the lauded Captain Kurtz (Brando), and travels through a jungle where the darkness of the human soul overtakes men. Though Brando, primarily viewed among shadows, does not receive much airtime in the film, he does convey well the depravity that Kurtz is driven to during war. The redux version of the film is also available and makes the already epic film substantially longer, but the material is worth seeing.
