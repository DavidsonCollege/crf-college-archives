BOLSHEVISTS ROUTED

to get to supper with no undue loss of time. Nevertheless, they deployed as skirmishers and the advance party sallied
forth into the woods in the direction from which the shots, or sounds of shots, came. Assembly was sounded and
the first engagement officially declared ended.

For an unrivalled example of helluvial suicide, the first platoon of “C” company shone forth as a bright and luminous
light by deploying in the face of a supposedly deadly fire opened from the crest of a hill some 700
yards south of the road. This was the second attack of the Reds, and occurred a parassany or so nearer
to the college. Instead of forming his fighting line on the protected side of the road, the commander of the
reserve of the advance guard valiantly deployed his men in plain view of the enemy and raced across the cotton
field in anticipation of a hand-to-hand combat with the upholders of the crimson hue. The attacking forces, however, in view
of the fact that the cartridges were loaded with paper bullets in lieu of the usual metal jacketed affairs, were
able to progress some distance across the open country before the battle was officially pronounced as over. Reports from all
boarding houses concur in declaring that supper was heartily partaken of by all present.

Inspiration to the
College Man and Alumnus

THE MOVEMENT TO ADEQUATELY ENDOW ALL SOUTHERN PRESBYTERIAN INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING PRESENTS AN EXAMPLE OF THE LARGENESS OF VISION
OF MODERN ECCLESIASTICAL STATECRAFT.

We all recognize that an educated and inspired ministry, a loyal and efficient teaching force, and professional men who are
Presbyterians in deed and creed, are essential to the continued prosperity and power of the Southern Church.

The ranks of Church leadership must receive continual reinforcement; and the vision that guarantees the adequate equipment and inspiration of
that reinforcement, must command our every resource to realize and perpetuate it for the Church.

Higher Education For All
At MONTREAT

Montreat Means

The Young People’s Conference
Stunt Day at Montreat
Education to the
Church Man & Lay Worker

THE MOVEMENT TO ADEQUATELY EQUIP THE SOUTHERN CHURCH'S GREAT SCHOOL OF CHURCH METHODS AT MONTREAT IS MERELY AN EXTENSION OF
THAT STATESMANSHIP TO THE WHOLE CHURCH.

The fact that we have long emphasized the need of higher education for the ministry much to the neglect of
those whose early education was inadequate, and of the laymen in general, cannot be denied. We must regain our place
as exponents of higher education, and we must, with a new vision, assure that the knowledge and inspiration of our
Church’s history, creed, and practice reach every Layman.
Montreat is the answer.

Montreat is for the Whole Church
By the Whole Church
