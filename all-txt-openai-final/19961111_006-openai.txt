Russian President Boris Yeltsin recovers quickly after bypass surgery

Russian President Boris Yeltsin is recovering faster than expected from the quadruple bypass surgery he underwent last Tuesday. Yeltsin reassumed presidential power from Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russia's Prime Minister, less than 24 hours after the surgery. On Thursday, Yeltsin, still in the hospital, announced that November 7, once known as Revolution Day, will now be called Day of Accord and Reconciliation. Rather than celebrating the proletariat dictatorship, the day will now officially commemorate the victims of the revolution.

Bosnia accused of arms smuggling

Central intelligence agencies throughout Europe unofficially accused Bosnia of smuggling serious weaponry, including 155-mm howitzers, into the country. Such artillery shipment violates the Dayton Accord, the Bosnian peace agreement created in Dayton, Ohio, last year. According to intelligence reports, guns are being shipped into Bosnia by way of the southern Croatia port.
