**We need to make the decision to care**
Steve Baggarly

I am spending this spring term off campus in Philadelphia with the Philadelphia Center. The Center is a liberal arts
urban semester set up by the Great Lakes College Association, which consists of two courses and an intern experience somewhere
in the city. As my internship, I have been working and living with a community of Franciscan brothers and sisters
who run the St. Francis Inn. The Inn is a soup kitchen that serves a healthy sit-down meal 11 times
a week, and a place where other individual needs are met. The brothers and sisters, along with volunteer help, also
run a shelter for homeless men, one for homeless women, and two thrift shops. All of these are located in
northeast Philadelphia in a section known as Kensington.

Kensington is never going to make it on any postcards of Philadelphia. It used to be home to a variety
of factories and mills, but most closed down over twenty years ago and today it is one of the poorer
sections of the city. One of the brothers is thankful that the elevated train still runs through, otherwise no one
would even know it was here.

When I first arrived in Kensington, I was struck by the atmosphere of violence. Explosions of anger by people long
frustrated with their circumstances, or the violent illusions of some mentally ill or those on drugs or alcohol. People fighting,
out of the boredom of unemployment, and prostitutes giving themselves over to male violence. Even city officials and gangs of
youths beating on homeless people as they sleep. The need to be tough in order to survive the street.

The course this country has chosen condemns the poor every day, putting them at the mercy of our military mentality.
But all this is only a manifestation of an unquestioned, deeper violence that controls our society. The violence of the
American Dream. This tells the poor that they are worth less than others, inferior from day one. It says that
the poor are “different” from us, and that we are all responsible only for ourselves. This is the real violence,
a family with two houses and three cars unwilling to share their lives with the mother and three children who
have to live in a burned-out home in north Philly. And this is what our society is based on.

A good friend of mine listed on an application two pages long all her high school activities and honors, some
of which include: member of the student executive council and debate team, president of two clubs and an active member
of several others, fund-raising chairman for two food drives to help orphaned boys, voted the best student leader and most
likely to succeed, church lector, catechism teacher, and a 3.7 G.P.A. in advanced courses. And she got a 1000 on
the SAT (I do not contend, here, that the SAT score is an activity or a type of honor). She
sent this list to a liberal arts college (not Davidson) and was surprised she was turned down. She and her
father made an appointment with the dean of admissions to see just where and how things had gone awry. The
dean explained it to them this way. “Margaret,” he said coolly, “Your activities and honors enable me to believe that
you're a fine young woman and that you're going to contribute a lot to the society in which you live.
But we, at this time, are looking for students with at least 1,100 on the SAT, whom we feel...

There is a fear of poverty in our country. This keeps us afraid of not only the poor themselves, but
also of threats to our personal property. And so, in refusing to believe that our only security is in loving
our enemies, we train for war instead of peace. Many of the people here at the Inn are involved in
social justice issues, especially world peace. We can never divorce the pursuit of peace from the poor. The course this
country has chosen condemns the poor every day, putting them at the mercy of our military mentality. So much time
and funding, so many lives spent in building the war machine rather than in reaching out to brothers and sisters
who need someone to care about them. And we all lose, for we only love ourselves and our God as
much as we love the least of those among us.

Feeling unwanted and unloved is more tragic than any disease or financial loss ever could be. They may not have
degrees, but the people I’ve met here are the best teachers I’ve ever had. They are teachers of reality in
many ways. In them, I constantly face myself. Not only are all of my weaknesses exposed in my attempts to
relate to them, but I also see my own value as an individual, my gifts. And I come to see
more clearly the God that chooses to be one of us, hoping, falling, loving, and agonizing with us. The God
that comes to us in the guise of the poor and hurting. There is something very special about the poor.
Part of it is a life that really relies on...God, while others are easily caught up in relying on themselves,
and miss who they really are. Many of the poor don’t realize the inner opportunities of their position, while many
others are too afraid to seek that special understanding of life that comes with poverty. These are a few perspectives
that I've been gaining on the situation as a whole. But what it really comes down to is the time
spent with people as individuals. Knowing the poor as friends, understanding people a little more, and not being afraid to
care, these are the struggles within me as I remain here. It is a very personal struggle, changing and challenging
from day to day. But the choice to put myself in this position was the beginning. As it is almost
graduation time once again, I think of this great symbol of responsibility-taking. And I see the hunger, addiction, mental illness,
and homelessness of Kensington often being the result of decisions made by other people. What we stand for and how
we live our lives does matter. Every decision we make or fail to make affects people, usually people we never
see. And yet we never consider them when we make decisions.

And I see the hunger, addiction, mental illness, and homelessness of Kensington often being the result of decisions made by
other people. We need to make the decision to care. Many of the people I’ve met ultimately are on the
street, or live in a garbage dump, or hustle, or huff tywol (the most popular and cheapest high on the
street, a mixture of kerosene, cleaning fluid, and other liquids, inhaled through the mouth or nose) because no one has
cared. No one cared at home, at work, at church, or in the neighborhood. And this is the heart of
the solution. People ready to give their lives to living with, caring about, and learning from those who are less
fortunate. No amount of funding or programs can ever take the place of people being there. Feeling unwanted and unloved
is more tragic than any disease or financial loss ever could be.

Knowing the poor as friends, understanding people a little more, and not being afraid to care, these are the struggles
within me as I remain here. And I wonder if perhaps, the very slums that surround me are a reflection
not of those living there, but of those who have the means to change them, but refuse to do so.
And maybe the sleek new buildings downtown don’t reflect those who work there, so much as the potential of the
souls of the poor at whose expense, and by whose sweat, they were built. Baggarly is a junior sociology major

SAT does not indicate performance would be able to perform well, here, as a freshman. I'm sorry. You should have
taken one of those SAT preparatory courses,” which I consider a euphemism for an SAT cram course, which the dean’s
own daughter had taken two times at 500 greenbacks a shot. The dean’s advice and credibility for that matter are
questionable on two accounts, on his placing too much emphasis on the SAT and on his insinuating that by taking
a cram course one can improve his SAT score and his performance as a freshman at the same time. There's
still the tendency to think the SAT’s the best indication of freshman-year performance we've got, and that’s too bad. Christopher
Jencks and James Crouse, in their study published in Phi Delta Kappa magazine, contend that the SAT indicates the ability
to reason and familiarity with mathematical concepts, and indicates much less the student's achievement and probable freshman-year performance. The idea
of doing away with the SAT and administering to juniors and seniors achievement tests, which would measure what a student
has learned in such core subjects as history, physics, and foreign language seems slow in becoming anything more than an
idea, especially after seeing its heyday pass by in 1982 when some top colleges, including Harvard, indicated they were going
to pay more attention to achievement tests and less to SAT’s. David Owens, whose multi-million-dollar Princeton Review leads the pack
of profitable cram courses, persuades that his business allows the student to increase his SAT score by 150 to 250
points by taking advantage of the SAT’s weaknesses. And he admits freely that the Princeton Review in no way increases
the student’s freshman-year performance. Like any other person who has gone through Owens’ program twice, the dean’s daughter should have
learned how to identify and how to skip the SAT’s unscored section, a group of experimental and often difficult candidate
questions used for future tests. She should have learned how to crack the SAT’s answer code, how to identify and
avoid the easy answer in the hard portion of the test, and how to identify and grab the easy answer
in the easy portion of the test. So much time and money spent, and, yet, her freshman-year performance shall remain
unchanged. After sharing dinner and an evening with Margaret and her family, I couldn't help but feel she would grow
up to be a fine woman and a respected community activist and that one small liberal arts college made and
is continuing to make one helluva mistake.
