### WEDNESDAY NIGHT BREAK

The break this Wednesday night will feature coffee, doughnuts, and more of the scintillating conversation that was in evidence last
Wednesday. There has been a slight change in Break tradition, however.

There will be no hostesses at this break due to the lack of interest in this form of diversion last
week. We hope to see more interest in meeting the girls of Davidson on future dates, and those that have
comments along these lines are urged to voice their opinions to some member of the Union Staff.
