THE DAVIDSONIAN ARTS & LIVING

Taking music to the next level

“Shocking,” says Damion White ‘05, when asked to depict his upcoming debut album: not because it’s wild and uncultivated work, but because it is turning out to become one that might win numerous awards in the near future. This 22-year-old graduating senior is definitely ready for the next level musically.

White might have literally started working on his album this semester during independent study, but it has technically been a long process that started his sophomore year. “I wanted to find some way to heal my community. I never thought about entering the music industry, I was still thinking about the NBA,” he says as he laughs. “But realistically I wanted to be a teacher, but then I heard Jesus Walks by Kanye West and thought WOW he is becoming popular with this song.” And around that same time he was introduced to the Sloan recording studio and was then able to take Dr. Lawing’s electronic music class. “A blessing,” is how White describes everything that has happened to him. That is where White’s rollercoaster ride began and he has not gotten off yet.

White planned to finish his CD by April 11, but his perfectionism got in the way; he wanted to step it up a notch. He decided to get his CD’s pressed (not burned) and packaged for a more professional look. Damion is now trying to get his CD, “Independent Study,” rightly called, rush ordered so Davidson can get the first sneak peek.

As talented as White has become, he did not create “Independent Study” alone. He credits two people for taking him under their wings, producers Edrick Milles and Davidson student, Cory Maluski ‘06. “They recognized my desire, and allowed that to excuse my music incompetence,” White said. He has also collaborated with Trenita Brookshire ‘05 and Christian Hunt ‘05 on the more smooth tracks on his album. “Independent Study” completely surprised me, because after a while of listening to the CD, I completely forgot it was Damion White, Davidson student, and I started to think it was a song I could be hearing on MTV or BET.”

White makes music for all types of people, which is why he describes his CD as “urban.” He says it is urban because it is not rap or hip hop; a mix of people can experience city life, and we connect in the urban scene with club, Southern, rock music etc. which all fall under the umbrella of urban. If you are looking for something new and refreshing, check out Damion White’s CD, “Independent Study,” for $10 and you can pre-order right now.

Avoid the fever of spring

It’s getting to be that time of the year when the weather is beckoning us forth from Chambers and the library, but the weight of our books keeps us from going farther than a blanket on the lawn. This is a shame. But even ifPapers and tests rule out a full weekend of outdoor bliss, yet you must continue to eat and sleep. Why not take these activities outdoors? The Outdoor Advisor is ready to make this as easy and efficient as possible for maximum enjoyment.

**Sustenance**

A hearty meal does a lot to keep you healthy and alert for your academic as well as extra-curricular pursuits. Therefore, skimping here is not recommended. While the tables behind Commons or on the patio of the Union provide a breath of fresh air, why not prepare the whole meal yourself at lovely locations such as Hobart Park or the lake campus? Use one of the grills there or come to Davidson Outdoors and rent a stove. You can make Silver Turtles (ground beef, vegetables, spices wrapped in aluminum foil and cooked over coals for 15-30 minutes) or try your hand at pita pizzas (tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, and toppings of choice on a pita, sautéed in butter).

For the more adventurous hearts and bellies, DO has great resources, such as *Cooking the One-Burner Way: Gourmet Cuisine for the Backcountry Chef*, *Lipsmackin’ Backpackin’*, and *Camp Cook’s Companion*. Each cookery is filled with intriguing recipes that have fun names like “Tilton’s Traveling Oatcakes,” “Mr. Natural’s Fried Fowl,” and “Hanging-by-Your-Boots Upside-Down Cake.” Whether you’ve had a long day of hiking or of researching, these tasty treats are sure to please.

**Slumber**

Warning: These meals may create the urge to continue the camp experience. In this case, you could head out to the cross-country trails and find a nice little side path where you can set up camp. Check the forecast, and then don’t forget a flashlight, a warm hat, and some water. You may also want a watch so you won’t miss class or breakfast the next morning.

For a less rugged experience, you could talk to Lynda Daniels in the Union about renting Erwin Lodge for the evening. (It’s free to students, but no alcohol is allowed on the premises). This little oasis includes a full kitchen, flush toilets, and a fireplace.

Even if all of this seems completely unappealing to you, the Outdoor Advisor hopes you will at least put down the books long enough to toss around a Frisbee, ride a bike, or go for a walk on the trails or around town.
