**Escape the Dark Ages through IMAC ©**

By MIKE ADAMS

Only two more days to Christmas vacation — and then two weeks of luxurious freedom. Ah, but there’s a price
to pay. When we return to Davidson with our new clothes, new skis, new cars and so on, we will
begin the real winter term. The three-week trial period will be over. The Dark Ages will commence.

The Dark Ages. Seven weeks of classes, reviews, and papers; seven weeks of rain without snow; seven weeks of unmitigated
drudgery. It is enough to send a vulnerable mind over the brink, to snap that slender thread between genius and
insanity.

There is one sure-fire escape from the mind-numbing tediousness of winter term — sports. Of course, it is impossible for
us all to play on the varsity teams, and some of us just don’t have the jump shot or the
corner kick to play IMAC basketball or indoor soccer. No, some athletic pursuits are more arcane. Fortunately, Davidson students have
proven quite adept in the past at creating wintertime sports.

The all-time winter favorite — a spring, summer, and fall favorite as well — is the Beer Run. This is
a basic sport involving running about your dorm to find someone with a car — and sometimes someone with cash
— to take you to the Pantry, nee 7-11. New rules changes have made a 21-year-old team member a necessity.

Another favorite is Post Office Cross Country. This involves a cold, windy trek to the P.O. and is usually concluded
with vigorous cursing and stamping when the box is discovered to be empty. P.O.X.C. is closely akin to another classic
winter-time sport: the Dorm Dash. The Dorm Dash usually occurs on a day when you go to class in just
a sweater because it’s “so pretty” outside. While you are in class, the temperature drops 57 degrees and a driving
rainstorm begins. Hence, the sprint back to the humble domicile.

A game that many students play, although few admit to actually liking it, is Sidewalk Skating or its tricky variation,
Step Skating. It will rain all day on Monday and on Tuesday morning you’ll run outside with a smile on
your face because it’s so sunny only to discover that it is also very cold, that everything is frozen, and
that it is impossible for your feet to maintain contact with the ground.

The Davidson Pentathlon continues to be a favorite in the winter. This five-stage competition involves first, receiving a paper topic;
second, rushing to the library to check out all the books on your subject before anyone else can get them;
third, scurrying through the periodical stacks; fourth, rushing across campus to be the first to get a PC to write
your paper; fifth, sprinting madly to Chambers to turn it in before the 5 p.m. deadline.

No discussion of winter-time sports would be complete without a mention of the campus-wide juggling festival. Every student on campus
will be juggling something in the last weeks of February. Students will be trying to keep two papers going while
studying for a major review. Others will be trying to prepare for senior comps without completely forgetting that they have
other classes. When exam time rolls around, juggling is definitely Davidson’s sport of choice.

Naismith invented basketball to keep his charges from going stark raving mad in the Massachusetts winter. Davidson students, while perhaps
not creating something with basketball’s staying power, have been able to keep their heads above water with their own version
of the “Sporting Life.”
