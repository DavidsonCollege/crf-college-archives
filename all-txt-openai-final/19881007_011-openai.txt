**Just what did the debate mean?**

Alan Thornburg

What did the Bentsen-Quayle debate mean to the American people? Most media sources say that most folks vote for the
top of the ticket. That’s probably true, but don’t we care to know about the man who has a real
chance of becoming our Commander in Chief by default? What did our citizens learn about J. Danforth Quayle in Wednesday
night’s contest?

First, Senator Quayle certainly had the most to gain. We had all been led to expect a stumbling, whining young
man that was to remind us of a boy just dragged from the classroom and asked to run a board
meeting. Well, Quayle didn’t do that poorly, but he did show us that you can’t make a nationally credible candidate
in a few weeks even if you are Lee Atwater. The Senator had a few problems, such as his nervousness
showing, making his subjects and verbs agree, and changing his thought in mid-sentence. But none of this came as a
surprise; it probably just filled us with anticipation about the answer we hoped was just about to emerge. We heard
few answers, however. Instead, we saw an over-scripted puppet. When asked what he would do if he found himself in
the Oval Office, Quayle said he would pray and then get to know his cabinet. That’s OK for a first
attempt, but you have to wonder what kind of independent thinking is going on when the fellow can’t put together
something a little more creative the next three times the question is asked. That question is broad enough to allow
an opportunity to say just about anything; a perfect lead-in to talk about those pleasant-sounding programs of which every candidate
has a host. “Yea, but I only have one answer written here for that question.”

What about that combative spirit we’ve heard about on the Senate floor? He really hit hard when he blasted the
Carter grain embargo and called “tax-hike Mike” the biggest liberal since McGovern. “We must save the country from those weak
left-wingers. We must have tough laws and judges, values...

**Dan Quayle: The Politics of Profit**

Daniel Grau

George Bush had his fingers crossed Wednesday night. Bush, and many political analysts, thought that if Dan Quayle could simply
avoid making the kind of blunders which litter his campaign trail, then he would win the debate and instill confidence
in his abilities and in his intellect. And despite dozens of minor mistakes, mispronunciations, errors in logic, and the retarded
pace of his thought, Quayle may have managed to avoid any blunder dramatic enough to raise questions in the minds
of voters. For some, however, Quayle’s performance was more disturbing than reassuring.

Consider Quayle’s conception of the poor. Tom Brokaw reminded us of the sixty-five million children belonging to families who live
in poverty, and he asked Quayle “to describe to the audience the last time you may have visited with one
of these families personally and how you explain to that family your votes against the school breakfast program, the school
lunch program, and the expansion of the child immunization program.” That is a loaded question, but if it tells us
something about the anchorman’s politics, the answer tells us something about the politician’s attitudes. Perhaps it was just distasteful meter
when Quayle responded: “I have met with those... people.” But the fact that Quayle regards the poor as sub-human, or
at least sub-Quayle, can be seen a little further in his answer. The hungry people at the food bank in
Fort Wayne, Indiana, “didn’t ask me those questions about those votes,” Quayle said. Why? “Because they were glad that I
took [pause]... time out of my schedule to go down and talk about how we’re going to get a food
bank and making sure that a food bank goes in Fort Wayne, Indiana.” It is doubtful that hungry people skipped
over the question of their next meal to thank the Senator for penciling them into his busy schedule. But it
is possible. James Joyce opens his story, “After the Race,” by describing the effect of expensive cars racing near Dublin:
“...sightseers had gathered in clumps to watch the cars careering homeward and through this channel of poverty and inaction the
Continent sped its wealth and industry. Now and again the clumps of people raised the cheer of the gratefully oppressed.”
In Quayle’s world, the poor people of Fort Wayne are also gratefully oppressed.

More importantly, the poor people of Fort Wayne lack Quayle’s connections: Some think that the press has been unfairly hard
on Quayle about his connections. When it was revealed that the National Guard admitted Quayle due...

The Magic of the Open Luncheon
Jay Barron

So, what we’re talking about here is a little bit of magic... Shaw’s magic words, (and his magic flower)... people
magically appearing every Wednesday at 12:30 IN SPITE OF our publicity, or lack thereof... and a nutty, zany, and sometimes
even inspiring feeling of magic when something really clicks and somehow a roomful of very different people are sucked in
by a speaker, and for a half an hour we're all taking the time to think about someone ELSE’S experiences
for a change, something we almost assuredly hadn’t thought much about before.

So, for example, what I’m talking about is a teacher from the Soviet Union and a student from the Soviet
Union; Davidson folks who traveled to Central America; students who worked in southern Africa; international students talking about being slapped
in the face by America and “how nice everybody here is”; a doctor who worked in Korea; the mayor of
Charlotte; a peace marcher; a few Christmas stories; a children’s lawyer; a conservationist. We’re talking about scrounging up a little
more diversity than you may find in the Davidson day-to-day. We’re talking about “doing lunch”!

So, this Wednesday you may have a class at 12:00, and maybe even another one at one, in which case
you’re slam out of luck. Maybe you don’t, BUT you DO have a paper and a review and a paper
and a seminar and a paper... so taking time out would be really inconvenient. Schucks. But maybe you’re intrigued, ever
so slightly... $1.50 for a sandwich, a salad, a Dannon, & a beverage sounds about fair (even though we don’t
have us one o’ them fancy-schmantzy electro-gizmos for yer lunch ‘card...). So, maybe you'll come up to the 900 room
for lunch at 12:30, or even bring your own and listen to the speaker at 1:00, and take a chance
on getting hooked on the Open Luncheon.

This week our own Caroline Craig will talk about service opportunities here in Davidson. Next week we’ll move on to
Mr. Stan Khan, education in black South Africa. On November 2, Ortmayer/Haskell/Kazee Bush/Dukakis/Bentsen/Quayle, and so on. You'll be getting a
schedule under your door. So, make some time for the Open Fun (choose Open, by the way, means OPEN to
and for everyone...) and please feel free to get hooked.

He didn’t stumble on these points, as they were on his script. We can’t indict the man for having rehearsed
answers. The candidates should be well prepared. But, when Quayle four times cites the only major piece of legislation he
has authored (the Job Training Partnership Act), one must ask, “Is this the only thing Dan Quayle wants us to
know about his record, and is this one bill enough to recommend him for the position of second in command?”
If there is more to Mr. Quayle, why isn’t he sharp enough to stop reciting his prepared statements and tell
us who he really is? The American people were told that they would see the man as he really is.
If that’s what we saw, the man who had the most to lose lost it. Many of us do care
who will be the next Vice President. If you care, doesn’t the prospect that Mr. Quayle might fill this seat
give you reason for concern?

To his father’s intervention, and when it was revealed that the National Guard assigned him to a desk job, despite
his training as a welder, Republicans dismissed the charges. Republicans admit that Quayle benefitted from his family’s wealth and power,
but these were isolated incidents. They insist that Quayle does not subscribe to the politics of privilege. The debate told
another story, however. For instance, why is Quayle qualified? Because he has connections. “I’ve met with the Western political leaders.
Margaret Thatcher, Chancellor Kohl. I know them. They know me.” Perhaps Quayle envisions N.A.T.O. as a kind of country club—elevated,
elite, host to all the right people. Similarly, why can we count on him should the President be incapacitated? Because
he will have had lunch with the Cabinet: “And I will know them on a first-hand basis. Because as Vice-President
I’ll sit on the National Security Council. And I’ll know them on a first-hand basis because I’m gonna be coordinating
the drug effort. I’ll know ‘em on a first-hand basis because George Bush is going to recreate the Space Council
and I’ll be in charge of that.” The repetition of “know them on a first-hand basis” betrays the habit of
Quayle’s thinking. Privilege does not merely characterize Quayle’s youth: it deeply informs his picture of the world and how to
behave in it. In his statement of qualifications, as well as in his conjecture about Presidential succession, Quayle’s mind repeatedly
returns to the question of contact, of connection, and of power through social circles rather than through individual virtue. Quayle
constitutes living proof of that cynical adage, “it’s not what you know, but who you know.” And what Dan Quayle
is assuring us is that he either knows now, or he will know, the right people.

It was quintessential Quayle when, asked what experience most shapes his political philosophy, the candidate recalled the “Midwestern advice from
a grandmother to a grandson”: “You can be anything you want if you just set your mind to it and
go to work.” And Quayle will pass this advice along to his children, although with a slight twist: “You can
be anything you want if you just set your mind to it and go pull strings.”
