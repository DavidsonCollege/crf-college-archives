**Trustees Vote To Underwrite $35,000 For Athletics Commended**

The request for the underwriting of $35,000 for football and basketball scholarships by the Board of Trustees seems to be
a definite forward step that may eventually lead Davidson’s intercollegiate athletics out of the proverbial woods. This is still far
less than the other Southern Conference colleges are spending on these two sports, but is about $10,000 more than has
been contributed by the Wildcat Club in the past years. Under the proposed setup, the Wildcat Club would continue its
fund-raising activities and whatever sum it collected would be included in the $35,000 figure. If this figure is not attained,
however, the college assumes the responsibility for making up the rest of the amount. It was specified by the trustees
that $30,000 of this amount would be devoted to football, and $5,000 to basketball. Of course, it remains to be
seen whether this increase will materially change Davidson’s athletic situation when rival schools are still spending much more. A considerable
group here feels that the athletic dollar will go farther at Davidson than at many other schools. Davidson is no
less expensive than other schools, but many think that with our present capable athletic department and better use of alumni
connections throughout the Southeast, Davidson can do much better. At any rate, we feel that with some increase in funds
and a reasonable guarantee that the funds will be forthcoming, we can hold our own against reasonable opposition.

**IFC Scores With Name Bands, But Will Someone Fix P.A. System!**

With the announcement this weekend that Ray Anthony is returning to Davidson for Spring Frolics, we hasten to proffer a
word of commendation for the IFC members. They have done a splendid job in signing three of the top dance
bands in the country for the interfraternity dances this year. It is doubtful whether they could have done better under
any circumstances in getting well-established names in dance music. We hope, however, that this spring the past difficulties with the
sound system in Chambers will be borne in mind, and that those in charge of Anthony's concert and Spring Frolics
will see to it that suitable equipment is available. Just about everybody will agree that it’s better if you can
hear the vocalists as well as see them. It does seem a bit wasteful to spend several thousand dollars on
a “big name” band, only to see its effectiveness marred by the failure of the sound system.

**College Giving Long Due Attention To Business, Economics Majors**

The creation of a separate Department of Business is especially noteworthy insofar as it represents an improved opportunity for men
attending Davidson who are preparing to enter the business world. Perhaps there was a time in the past when the
great majority of the students at Davidson were preparing for one of the professions such as the ministry or medicine.
Though we still have many “pre-s” enrolled here, the growth of the college has seen a corresponding and proportionate growth
in the number of men majoring in business and related fields. Without reflecting on anyone in particular, we think it
fair to say that for many years the college tended, or at least seemed, to deemphasize the importance of business,
economics, and related fields as contrasted with the more liberal arts. It is not without significance that students leaving Davidson,
and planning business careers, have many times deemed it wise to study an additional year or so at other institutions
in order to better equip themselves. It is not impossible that the business major often has been made to feel
like a stepchild in the eyes of a good part of the college community, and we are glad to see
that he is now getting more of the attention deserved him by the college.

**“THE Honor CARRY out DARIt&G PLATOON THE PRESCRIBED NOW white bh) pares?**

**Carolinian At Oxford**

(Ed. note: The following is a reprint from the January 31 issue of the State Magazine and was written by
another American student at Oxford. Hubert Cannon graduated from Davidson last year and was awarded a Rhodes scholarship.)

A tall young South Carolinian, armed with a six-foot Confederate flag and a detailed map of his native state, came
to Oxford University last fall. In a spacious suite at Christ Church, one of Oxford's most famed and aristocratic colleges,
this young man is already proving his favorite axiom: “You can take a man out of the South but you
can’t take the South out of a man.” Hubert N. Cannon of Lancaster has won one of the most coveted
awards in the academic world: a Rhodes scholarship. He is at present the only South Carolinian to hold this honor.
In 1902 the last of Britain’s great empire builders died and left an immense fortune to endow the scholarships which
bear his name. Since then thousands of carefully-selected young men have come to Oxford from all parts of the English-speaking
world. Here they have fulfilled the vision of Cecil Rhodes and returned to their homes to foster a clearer understanding
between the English-speaking peoples. It is said by many Americans who have suddenly found themselves transplanted temporarily to Oxford that
only one aspect of university life here is similar to that in the United States: sleep. Students even wake up
differently here. In the early morning a scene takes place in Hubert’s room that is worthy of a high-flown British
movie about high-flown people. An elderly man quietly comes into the sitting room, draws the curtains and lights the fire.
Then, carrying a pair of shoes that he has polished, he walks into the bedroom and announces in solemn British
tones: “It’s half-past seven, sir.” This is Jim, the “scout” or college servant assigned to Hubert. To Jim, Hubert is
one of the dozens of undergraduates he has fathered and mothered in his 52 years of service. Like with many
other scouts, his profession is a family tradition. His own father tended to Oxford students for half a century. As
in America, meals are eaten rather than injected with a needle, but here the similarity ends. Manners, setting, and the
food itself are different in nearly all respects. Hubert eats in the most beautiful dining hall in Oxford. It is
an enormous, oak-paneled room with a timbered ceiling built in the reign of Henry VIII. The table manners of Hubert’s
English companions would seem atrocious in South Carolina. But then American manners make an equally bad impression on the viscounts,
lords, and baronets who eat their pie with fork and spoon and squash peas on the back of their fork.
It is the food itself, however, which makes Hubert appreciate the joke that British concoctions are the best food for
those who do not like to eat. It is so different, in fact, that even English students dislike it. Kippers,
porridge, steamed pudding, and boiled potatoes form the staple diet of the Oxford undergraduates. But Oxford authorities laugh off the
age-old comments and say that any improvements would deprive students of their richest sources of wit. But it is not
to eat that people come to Oxford but to study, and for that Hubert, like every other American here, considers
this ancient university well-suited. Lectures themselves are relatively unimportant and few students attend them regularly. There are no quizzes or
class participation and attendance is optional. Their most remarkable feature lies in the fact that those students who go must
wear a short, black, shapeless, cotton gown over their normal clothes. It is rather in the tutorial system that the
real value of Oxford education lies. Hubert, who graduated last June from Davidson College with an A.B., is taking a
course here in politics, philosophy, and economics, a combination generally referred to as P.P.E. Twice a week he visits his
tutor, a specialist in these subjects whose main duty is to prepare him for final examinations two years hence. For
these one-hour private tutorials, Hubert writes and reads to his tutor an essay on some aspect of the course he
is studying. The tutor then discusses with him its merits and faults and assigns a vast amount of reading material
in preparation for next week's work. To Hubert, this system has three important advantages. In the first place, he can
travel at his own pace and is not geared to the average level of a large class. Secondly, he can
feel that the man most responsible for his education takes a definite and personal interest in his progress. And finally,
it gives him a feeling of independence and responsibility. Although a high academic standard is required to win a Rhodes
scholarship, this in itself is not enough. Cecil Rhodes distrusted the mere bookworm and by the terms of his will
only young men with wide and varied interests were eligible. Oxford encourages these interests extremely well. Sports are at least
as popular here as in any American university. Each of the 21 men’s colleges has its playing field and during
the year one sees everything from soccer and squash to cricket and jiu-jitsu. Every student participates in sports and Hubert
is no exception. He has gone in for probably the most popular one here: rowing. During the past two months,
he has spent nearly every afternoon on the Isis, a branch of the Thames. In the evenings, so many activities
go on that most students are afraid to stay in their colleges for fear they will miss something worthwhile. Not
only does Oxford boast two legitimate theaters where many first-rate plays are shown prior to their London opening, but there
are clubs and societies which bring some of the most famous speakers in the world to Oxford. The Oxford Union,
a debating society of which Hubert is a member, is, together with that at Cambridge, the recognized proving ground for
future British statesmen.

**Marburg Writes Appreciation For Davidson’s 1948 Gift Fund**

(Ed. note: The 1948 Christmas gift fund money was sent to the University of Marburg in Germany. This letter was
received recently by Dr. Cunningham to show the continuing appreciation of the students at Marburg for the gift.)

Dear Dr. Cunningham,

At Christmas, 1948, the students of your college were kind enough to choose the University of Marburg as the recipient
of their annual Christmas collection. Your extensive and generous gift reached us in the early summer of 1949. And now,
on the fifth anniversary of this charitable action, symbolic of the spirit of reconciliation and helpfulness on the part of
your American students, I am writing you to express again the thanks which my predecessors sent you at that time.
As a result of the difficult conditions of those years, many students were undernourished and poorly housed; they were therefore
most thankful for the more substantial meals in the university cafeteria and in the various dormitories which were made possible
by Davidson College's generous gift, which was apportioned by a committee of teachers and students formed for this purpose. Especially
grateful were the sick students, who received, through the student physician, medicament and particularly nourishing foods from your shipment. Rest
assured that the generosity of your students has not been forgotten; we shall always remember it gratefully as a gesture
of solidarity and as an important step on the path to a fruitful relationship between our two institutions.peoples in the
future. We hope very much to be able to welcome you someday in Marburg, in order to thank you personally;
we would therefore be grateful if you would let us know in case you plan to come to Europe. The
theological faculty heartily joins in hoping to have you here as our guest. With best wishes from the University of
Marburg for you and your college in the coming year, and in grateful remembrance of your helpful initiative, I remain,

Sincerely yours,
THE RECTOR.

Y Program Seen As Energetic And Far From “Complacent”

In Stein Wilson's discussion of the YMCA last week, there were some glaring errors, a touch of fallacious reasoning, and
a gist of truth. It was truthful to the extent that it recognized that the Davidson Y has shortcomings and
that there is some student resentment to the Y program on the campus. In a moment I will deal with
the article’s fallaciousness and lack of proper reasoning.

First of all, let me explain my interest in this matter. As the one who holds the publications post on
the Y Cabinet, I am concerned that the Y be given favorable publicity. More than that, I am concerned that
the picture that is given of our YMCA is a truthful one, and further, that it is one that is
seen in the light of actual experience and fact—not one based on lack of adequate knowledge of the entire situation.
This point of view is also not the official Y opinion, but is the view of one of its members
who has a vital interest in the organization and its well-being. For an official answer, you may see Sam Magill
or Charlie Williams.

The fact that compulsory Y membership has its inadequacies is recognized not only by the Y Cabinet as a group,
but also is seen by the Y Board of Directors, a far more powerful policy-making group, and the current Y
secretary. The defense for such an organizational structure lies in other hands, but I imagine that the finances of the
Y and the whole Christian background of the school enter into it. Davidson is committed to the Christian ideal in
education and has been so for as long as there has been a school here. It is the natural desire
of the college to have some all-encompassing method of organizing the students in their Christian expressions. This is the Davidson
Y. This utilizes the paternalistic concept of providing for student needs.

By JIM MOORE

Your writer cannot entirely justify the paternalistic approach, but certainly one needs to recognize the situation as it is if
he is to understand what is happening. As a matter of fact, the reaction against the compulsory Y membership character
of the Y is a part of a greater reaction against paternalism itself that is today expressing itself among students.

Where Wilson falls down hardest in his approach to the Y situation here is in his statement, “The Y Cabinet
has become complacent in respect to its service to the student body, and one reason for this is the fact
that it does not have to perform any real service to the student to keep up its membership.” Now, is
the very fact itself (Y Cabinet complacency) true in fact as he says it is? In the mid-year report of
the Davidson YMCA the one rather startling conclusion one gained from hearing facts, figures and the story of great work
and effort being put forth, was that the Davidson Y is anything but complacent.

Your Y carries on a great variety of functions, among which are those more or less strictly in the Christian
realm, as deputations, Sunday School extension, College Bible Class, chapel programs, fall services, gift fund. Then there are a great
many social organizations aided and frequently directed through Y personnel, as the Gra-Y, Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts, community work and
social activities. The YMCA secretary attempts to be, first of all, the student's secretary, for he regards his job as
that of one who tries to aid students through the Y. He not only goes so far out of his
way as to organize a summer placement bureau, he also is alive to current needs and has helped form a
freshman council.

The cabinet has regular meetings at which current developments of the various posts are discussed and general business is taken
under consideration. Also there are more informal Friday night gatherings at Secretary Magill’s home, where broad policy matters are often
hashed over. Frequently the cabinet has occasion to review its program and approach and has discussed at great lengths our
difficulties and shortcomings. There are a great number of ways of looking at the multitude of problems that have confronted
us.

There is the question of participation of more students in the program. To begin with, there is a definite point
of no return in the number of people who can effectively be employed in the Y. That isn’t to say
the Davidson Y has reached that point. In some areas, after exhaustive efforts to reveal places for development, few feasible
ones have been found in which to enlarge the scope of the work. Take Sunday School extension for instance. Will
Terry has been writing to churches in this area since school began, asking them if they need Sunday School teachers.
The replies are often unencouraging to say the least.

But even if this is true, the Y is always anxious and ready to get new blood and ideas into
the organization. One point that is often overlooked in this discussion is the decision as to those on whom the
responsibility lies. Is it that of the Y, or the individual student's part to see that he takes advantage of
what the Y has to offer? All of this talk of the Y not following up on its promise to
get more people to work has some validity, perhaps, but much of it seems to me to be way off
base. What man ever won a girl after making the first flirtatious advances, and then sitting by waiting for her
to come knocking on his door? The way seems now well open to some wooing and winning of the Y
by students rather than the present standing by and waiting to be called.

But Politics At Davidson Is So Ungentlemanly

The columns of the Davidsonian and the conversation in the College Union are largely concerned with one subject—complaining and griping
about the state of things at Davidson. This is not unnatural. A student group is always more liberal than the
older generation which is represented by the faculty, administration and trustees, or if not more liberal, at least more eager
for change. At Davidson there is no way to express this understandable feeling except through futile and therefore usually destructive
talk. We have the feeling that very little which we as students advocate has any chance of becoming reality, and
so we are often for anything which is different from the status quo whether we have carefully evaluated it or
not. In order to develop any sense of responsibility, there must be the possession of some power. The student body
now has practically none. The statement is often heard that our only right as Davidson students is to leave school.
There can never be better feeling between the factions composing Davidson until such statements as this lose any claim to
being true even in part.

There is now an organization which is supposed to represent the student viewpoint. But the Student Council is generally looked
upon by its constituents as the tool of the Dean. Why is this? In the spring when we have student
elections, there is no particular interest or excitement in evidence around the campus. The various candidates have five minutes worth
of pleasantries to say in chapel, and we have another Student Council. It has been elected without the airing of
a single issue. Its members cannot be blamed for not knowing what the student body wants it to work for.
There has been no chance to measure public opinion. Only students who have been well known personally stand a chance
in such an election. A man can easily be elected on his personality without having the slightest interest in the
problems of student government. If open politics were permitted on the campus as it is in most institutions, various groups
could express themselves in the support of a certain idea. Persons who were interested in the Student Council could have
a say before they were eliminated in the preliminaries. The candidates who were successful would have some idea of what
concerned the students. Last year, it seems very likely that Lyman Kiser would have been elected by either method, but
if there had been campaigning Lyman would have had an easier course in working for the things which the student
body wants. He has done a good job in many ways, but he has had a difficulty in that he
has no way to show that the student body is behind his proposals and he cannot be sure himself. If
the president had been elected on a platform in competition with candidates having other platforms, he would not be faced
with this problem.

Politics would even seem beneficial in the YMCA elections. Stein Wilson, in last week's edition, pointed out many shortcomings of
the Y. These are bound to exist so long as the Y is controlled by an almost hereditary president. He
works his way to that position through the activities of the YMCA which remain largely rumor to the student body,
and he, too, has no way to learn what the students actually want from the Y. The situation last spring
when Hallett Ward seemed likely to be the next YMCA president illustrates the fact that when we are denied the
opportunity to exchange ideas concerning the future of an organization with candidates for its offices, we will turn to any
candidate who seems to offer a drastic change, whether good or bad.

If these advantages which I have attempted to show seem valid to you, why is it that student political activity
is forbidden? Davidson seems hardly the place where campaigning would go to extremes either in expenditures or the making of
combinations. It is too small a school to blindly vote blocs. Regardless of the election system used, we will think
of the person running and not of somebody’s candidate. It would be of decided advantage to us if when we
think of persons we could also think of issues. I believe that we would have a much more satisfactory relationship
between the various groups at Davidson if we could air our gripes thoroughly at election time and could then give
our support to student officers who were working for things we had decided to support.

P. S. Let me add a suggestion and a request to Dr. Davidson in this week’s column. I think it
would be a great convenience if some book deposit slot were provided in one of the library doors so that
reserve books which had been checked out for the weekend could be returned on Sunday night. This would end the
mad Monday rush to get them in by 10 a.m.
