Bailey and Jones Make Out- Chapman and Horine Doing standing Records Graduate Study

More and More Students Choose Educational Fields

Dr. P. H. Gwynn, Jr., was recently appointed as a member of the Governors Commission on Education as a result of the accusations made by three teachers in the Madison County schools who were unjustly deprived of their jobs.

Two Davidson alumni, Carleton Chapman and Field Horine, are now engaged in graduate work in the fields of medicine and German. Chapman, who received his degree here in 1936, took his final examinations for his first Oxford degree in June. During the summer months he made a tour of various European countries, visiting Paris, Interlaken, Vienna, and Prague. He is now at work on an advanced thesis in the field of medicine, and hopes to qualify for his second degree at the end of the current academic year.

Horine, class of 1938, now holds a fellowship at Columbia University. He has also been on the staff of the International House in New York. He has relinquished his broadcasting activities to devote his full time to his graduate work, in which he is a candidate for the Ph.D. degree in German.

Teaching, as a profession after we get out of college, does not appeal to many students. However, statistics show that every year more and more students are turning to this type of life work. It is interesting to note how many Davidson graduates of the last few years have turned to this profession. Here are a few who have chosen teaching as their life work: A. C. Adams, teaching mathematics at Statesville; L. M. Allison, teaching history and social science at Concord; J. E. Chrisman, teaching science in N. C. School for the Deaf; J. W. Helms, director of music and teaching biology at Huntersville; R. M. Kellogg, teaching mathematics at Concord; W. R. Laws, teaching Latin at Chamberlin-Hunt Academy in Mississippi; R. H. Lindsey, Principal of Elementary School in Lowell; J. I. Moffett, teaching social science and coaching athletics at Kings Mountain high school; D. D. Rhodes, teaching social science at Glade Valley.

Foreign Mission Fellowship Gains Galiceitatne

Foreign Mission Fellowship, a national society which replaced the Student Volunteer Movement, is well organized to carry out the work of the dissolved movement. The members of the Fellowship expect to meet together at different times during the year in various homes for discussion, a mission, and a social hour. Last year, with an approximate membership of 36, several speakers and motion pictures were presented, and it is possible that the same type of program will be carried out this year.

Bailey and George Jones qualified as expert riflemen and were selected to compete in the national matches at Camp Perry, Ohio. However, they were later eliminated. Both Bailey and Jones made highly successful records in every proficiency test.

The Davidson unit measured up to its usual high standard, the Major points out. Every Davidson student enrolled at the camp passed the course offered, remarked Major Ballard, with an approximate proficiency of 85 points out of a possible hundred.

Replaces Student Volunteer Movement

A special tap day, patterned on the familiar O.D.K. custom, will be staged by the Davidson high school Hi-Y club at an assembly program tomorrow. Four members will be initiated to the club, which is sponsored by the Davidson “Y.” Supervising all Hi-Y work this year is Locke White, member of the “Y” Cabinet. Definite plans for the year’s work have not been announced as yet. A tentative outline of activities, however, includes the inauguration of a thrift club at Mooresville. Casey Jones is slated to head the local group, while Elridge Brown and Bill Boyle will lead the Cornelius organization. Leaders for the Huntersville and Mooresville clubs will be appointed later.

Modesty like a blue serge suit, is always becoming.

Incompetence most often springs from indifference.

That bottomless lake surrounded by near-sighted friends—Adversity.pressure” sales - we are liable to complete. The Fellowship is primarily concerned with those students who wish to go into the Foreign Mission fields, its purpose being to promote interest and prayer in Foreign Missions both here and abroad. A student wishing to join the society must sign a Purpose Statement, “I propose to be a foreign missionary, and will plan accordingly. Until He leads me to the field, I will support the work by my prayers and gifts and witnessing. If the Lord's later leading should direct me into other service, I will seek to give Foreign Missions its rightful place of prominence in my ministry.”

men seem to regard business as a battle, with a minimum of mistakes, delays, etc. No complaints are ever yet run-it-self and paid a profit. Thousands of ocularly deficient people who have been prohibited from reading under ordinary light will have access once more with the advent of Polaroid. Lecturer, Wheelwright was a professor of physics while inventor Land was a student at Harvard University. Mutually interested, they collaborated and formed the Land-Wheelwright Laboratories, a research organization that perfected Polaroid. Mr. Wheelwright is currently engaged in a National lecture tour. Other lectures will be given in Charlotte in conjunction with “I. E. S. Week” Oct. 3-8, at the Chamber of Commerce on Saturday, Oct. 8, and at the Mint Museum Oct. 6.

Dr. John Redhead

The going becomes more interesting towards the top. No man has failed until he has made his last attempt. The redeeming feature of a pawnshop is the ticket. A retailer is a man who can tell the same story twice. You can't cure a disease or a condition by ignoring it. A man thinks he knows—but a wise man knows he doesn't. Progress depends on getting a clear view of obstacles. You can't demand respect; you've got to command it. Little price cutters, don't cry; you'll reach the bottom by and by. A sure cure for business is a heavy dose of brains. A good swift kick sometimes does a man more good than a lot of friends. The man whose only aim is fame is apt to miss fire. It is easier to raise objections than it is to get busy. Cold feet often carry a hot head away from trouble.
