### Additional Debaters Added to Varsity Squad in Monday Night Trial

**Five Juniors and One Senior Win Places**

**FOUR SOPHS CHOSEN**

**Marriage and Divorce Question Discussed by Twenty-Three Men Who Answer Call**

Monday night 23 men answered the call for varsity debate tryouts in contesting for a place on the squad. The squad as chosen consists of five men who have positions on the squad without trying out in lieu of their service on the varsity teams of last year, and 10 men chosen from the 23 men who spoke Monday night. The five varsity debaters of last year are H. T. Powell, A. T. Dillard, W. K. Pritchett, L. K. Pritchett, and R. C. Grady. The remaining 10 members of the squad as selected Monday are, in order as they were chosen: C. R. Pritchett, W. L. Dumas, R. M. Christian, R. E. Kell, W. B. McGuire, Reid Graham, Frank Hall, F. D. Miller, Riggs McConnell, and F. D. Daniels. The five teams composed of the 10 men will be selected from this squad of 15 men before Christmas. The judges for the preliminaries were Dr. C. K. Brown, Dr. T. W. Lingle, Prof. D. R. McCrew, Dr. J. M. McConnell, and Prof. A. Currie. These men, in co-operation with the Forensic Council, will later choose the teams to represent the college in the nine engagements. The subject of the trial speeches was, “Resolved, That Uniform Marriage and Divorce Laws Should Be Adopted by All States.”

### Wrights Urges Thought About the Larger World

**Americans Often Too Hasty in Passing Judgment on Foreigners, Says Speaker**

“When an American points an inquiring finger at French morals, the Frenchman hastily questions the Parisian divorces secured by scores of people from this country; when he sneers at the lack of censorship of foreign theaters, the man from the Continent says, ‘How do you Americans allow such a book as Elmer Gantry to be published?’” These questions and many others may be flung at visitors to the old countries, said Rev. Douglass L. Rights, pastor of the Trinity Moravian Church, of Winston-Salem, in his address at the “Y” vesper service last Sunday night, in speaking of “The Student in the Larger World.” In the opening of his address Rev. Mr. Rights stressed the fact that the limits of a nation’s “human relationships rather than its territorial boundaries, are the determining factors in its progress, as the history of many small nations proves. America, great in material resources, must not neglect to broaden her human relationships to keep step with modern times. The student in this larger and all-inclusive world is anxious to learn, and then he desires to find his field of greatest usefulness, where he may adapt himself to meet the needs of men. This process of world adaptation will be hindered by the many prejudices which students and others hold concerning foreign nations and customs. Illustrating his point by relating experiences encountered on the second visit of the A. E. F. to Paris, he declared that the French are not any more immoral than many of the Americans who flock there to get divorces. Italy will ask for an opinion on the Sacco-Vanzetti case.

### Student Criticizes and Reviews First Issue of Chameleon

It is always a difficult task to review college literary work. Shall one take the intrinsic merit of the writing as a standard, or, rather, shall the gauge be that of promise for the future? It is a question. This year’s Cham, despite the desire expressed in its mentor’s “editorial,” fails in our humble eyes to measure up to the heights of its predecessor. The material, in the first place, is too sparse—32 pages against an average of 48 last year; the variety of forms, too, is less. What is in Cham, however, is fairly good—some of it. The list of contributors is small, with versifiers, speaking comparatively, predominating. It is to be regretted that an error in printing, the failure to substitute a new table of contents, marred the mechanical make-up of the book. Rough Boggess’ “This Violin” heads the program—and rightly. His story has a degree of power, although it might have profited by restraint. The inquest into Barrie, “Between Each Parenthesis,” is also a charming thing, well-done, but to our minds Boggess’ “—And His Victor Recording Orchestra,” is the best of the lot—subtle, perhaps, for some readers, but clever. The theme of “The Dirty Cherub,” a Brown McQueen production, is somewhat flimsy, but Browne has sketched a neat story around it. “The Golden Gift” is unsatisfactory, while “Vignettes of Life,” by Bernard McClaugherty, suffers, we think, from the use of a too vivid present tense—yet how avoid it? The idea is good. As for the poetics of the volume, they impress us with rather more force than does the prose. Bob Witt, sole Freshman representative, proved slightly better in his “Fancy” than in “The City,” although both present a charming style. Brown McQueen’s five or six contributions are universally good, deserving more space than can be given them here. Frank Hall shows promise of better things to come. Warren Ogden and James Caligan are familiar names to the old students. Johnny McKnight’s contributions, with the possible exception of a line or two in “Shadows,” are trite. As a whole, Cham has slipped somewhat.

### Otto is Recipient of Captain’s Bars

Capt. J. A. Otto, the latest addition to the officers of the R. O. T. C. department, received his commission as captain on November 22nd. Captain Otto entered the service in 1917, after completing four years at Texas A. & M. His commission as second lieutenant was received after he had finished the prescribed course at the first officers’ training camp, held at Leon Springs, Texas. From Leon Springs he went to the 37th Infantry, stationed at Laredo, Texas, and he remained there until 1919, when he was transferred to Brownsville, in the same state. It was at Fort Laredo that he was first promoted, becoming a captain, which rank he retained until 1922, when, with numbers of other army officers, he was demoted to the grade of first lieutenant. From 1919 until 1927, Captain Otto was transferred to various army posts, including Fort Brady, Michigan; Porto Rico, Fort McPherson, and Fort Benning. In 1927 he was ordered to the R. O. T. C. department at Davidson, where he will remain for the next four years. The captain, with his wife and daughter, have been cordially received at Davidson, and despite the short time that he has been here, has already become one of the most popular members of his department.

### Campaign to Aid Youth of Mountain Section is Started by ‘Y’ Cabinet

**Twenty Scholarships Will be Provided for Boys**

**THOUSAND DOLLAR GOAL**

**Davidson Men Back Alumnus in Hospital and School Work at Banner Elk**

The Y. M. C. A. Cabinet has decided, after careful consideration, that the object of their annual campaign would be to raise one thousand dollars to go to make up twenty scholarships of fifty dollars each for the mountain boys attending the Plum Tree High School, at Banner Elk, N. C. The enterprise at Banner Elk is one noble in purpose and productive in results. It consists of four institutions, one of which is the Lees-McRae Institute for girls. This organization is an up-to-date and well-equipped school, offering splendid opportunities for mountain girls, drawn chiefly from North Carolina, but coming from Tennessee, Virginia, Kentucky, and Georgia. In addition to the girls’ school, the Grace Hospital is also situated at Banner Elk. This hospital is an efficient organization, having the services of two competent physicians and several registered nurses. It is the only hospital for miles around and serves a great number of the mountain people. The original work on Banner Elk was begun in 1900. The first real leader of the enterprise was Rev. Edgar H. Tufts, Sr., under whose careful and prayerful guidance it became an organization of far-reaching influence for the betterment of the mountain population. The Lees-McRae Institute was the first to be built after the erection of the church. A few years later the hospital became a reality. A few more years passed and

### NO MORE RUNNING

Never again will Davidson students be put to flight as the result of a frenzied “D Club” yell, according to a joint statement issued by Johnnie Mel-ton, president, and Coach Younger. Paddling raids will not be conducted either by the club or by any of the members, as it is felt that school spirit is suffering and that the consensus of student body opinion is opposed to such.

Educator Speaks at Initiation Tomorrow

The public initiation of the newly elected student, faculty, and alumni members of Phi Beta Kappa, national honorary fraternity, will occur tomorrow evening, December 9th, in Shearer Hall, at 8:00 o'clock. The principal speaker of the evening, Dr. David A. Robertson, will be introduced by Dr. T. W. Lingle, president of the local chapter. Dr. Robertson, from Washington, D.C., has for a number of years been dean of the College of Arts, Literature, and Science at the University of Chicago. Since 1918 he has been prominently connected with the Association of American Universities, of which he has served as secretary for five years. He carried on an investigation on behalf of the association of several American colleges in 1924. He is at present acting in the capacity of assistant director of the National Council of Education. He is particularly interested in international relations and is in charge of the Division of International Relations of the Council.

Preceding the public initiation, the private initiation will take place at 7:00 p.m. After the public initiation, the old and new members will proceed to the Maxwell Chambers Hotel, where they and their lady guests will (Continued on page 2).

Nestled away in the fastness of the Blue Ridge mountains, quite a distance from civilization as most people know it, there lies an institution which has for its purpose the preparation and training of the native sons of that region. Down in the foothills of North Carolina, only a few hours' ride by auto from this institution of which we have spoken, there lies another school for boys. This school, however, does not confine its student body to a certain region but serves young men from every corner of the southeast. The hill school is in its primary stages of development; as yet it is not fitted for the great work that eventually will fall to its lot in that great section of the land. The other school has stood majestically for years and years, making a name and reputation for itself that is well known throughout the country. Both are Presbyterian institutions, both have the same great fundamental aim, and yet it has only been in comparatively recent years that the two have come to be connected in any appreciable way. Banner Elk Mountain School has for its supervisor Mr. Edgar Tufts, a graduate of Davidson College in the class of 1921, and this is the only link between these two schools, of a common spirit, accommodating men of the same stamp, and by all means schools that should feel a very close and sincere attraction to each other.

For the last four years, the Davidson College Y. M. C. A. has conducted what it termed as "a missionary enterprise." This has been a yearly campaign to raise funds for a worthy enterprise, and the vital fact about the campaign has been that the money has come directly from the students, thus creating a feeling of real interest among the boys, and giving them reason to be sure that they were contributing to a cause that meant something in the furtherance of His Kingdom here on earth. For four years now, this student enterprise has been directed to the work of Warren Cox in China. Cox and his great work at Hang Chow Christian College has been a thing of heartfelt interest to men of Davidson, but this year, due to the unsettled conditions in China, the "Y" thought it best to find a new channel for the student campaign. This, of course, was no easy matter, but it was decided that no worthier recipient than the Banner Elk School could be found, and so it is to this institution that the current gift will go. It was thought that the nature of the new campaign would prove especially appealing to Davidson men, and serve to bind the two institutions together in a way that will prove a mutual benefit.

The average amount required to see one boy through a term of school at Banner Elk is $150. This sum takes care of the room, board, and tuition of one boy. By working at odd jobs around the school, or by doing special work out of school hours, most of the boys can make about $100 per year, but outside of this, nearly every one of them is absolutely penniless. It is unthinkable that these mountain boys, of the very purest Anglo-Saxon stock and needing only the opportunity to make good, should be forced to give up their chance to receive the benefit of the training at Banner Elk. And yet that will be the situation unless an outside factor steps in. Realizing the tremendous need, the "Y" is putting on this missionary campaign to raise $1,000. This sum will make up enough to grant 20 boys $50 each, thus allowing them to take advantage of this wonderful opportunity.

Clemson Fills Florida Date on Grid Schedule
Guilford Added to List
Ten Games Booked as 1928 Program is Announced
FOUR HOME GAMES
Charlotte Selected as Scene of Wake Forest Battle—Many Teams Offer Terms

Contracts have been signed with Clemson and Guilford Colleges for football games next season, supplementing the schedule of the past year with the omission of Florida, according to a statement made yesterday by Prof. W. W. Wood, graduate manager of athletics. The schedule, thus arranged, calls for one more game than in the 1927 season, making ten in all. Negotiations were carried on with a number of other colleges and universities, but because of the inability to arrange suitable dates, locations, and other features, it was not deemed advisable to accept them.

Professor Wood, in announcing the program for next year, said that it was the purpose of the Athletic Council to provide games for different sections of the South in order that larger numbers of alumni might be allowed to see the Davidson team in action, and this idea was borne in mind in locating gridiron contests at Charleston, S. C., Lexington, Va., Charlotte, and other cities in this state, as well as the Clemson game. The opening date is one week earlier than the schedule of the past fall called for, being September 22nd, when Guilford comes to Davidson. The Clemson team will oppose the Wildcats the next Saturday, probably in South Carolina, and on October 6th, Elon (Continued on page 8).

Fraternities Show Favor of Present House Plan
Pan-Hellenic Council Makes Suggestions and Recommendations at Recent Meeting

Practically whole-hearted support of the present fraternity housing situation was voiced at a recent meeting of the Pan-Hellenic Council, at which were present representatives of the three local fraternities on the campus also. It was at this meeting that a set of resolutions was adopted for presentation to the board of trustees regarding the question. The resolutions were adopted after a reopening of the question of fraternity houses, following a silence of two years. Two years ago, by action of the board of trustees, the fraternities were allowed to move from the campus into houses on private property near the campus.

The members of the Pan-Hellenic Council, in discussing the house situation, suggested for the consideration of the board of trustees, that certain of the fraternities had gone to a large expense in acquiring property in the town, chiefly through the help of the alumni, and that this property was acquired under the impression that the action of the board was final. From a national viewpoint, it was pointed out that over 90 percent of the colleges and universities in the United States and Canada have adopted the policy of allowing the fraternities to build their own homes off of the campus, and that several institutions materially help the fraternities in acquiring property and building thereon. And that it is the policy of the influential fraternities for their chapters to own their own homes as the most satisfactory plan, and also that many of the larger fraternities will not grant charters to chapters in schools where fraternity houses are not allowed off the campus, and that if the fraternities were permitted to remain off it would be an incentive for more (Continued on page 8).
