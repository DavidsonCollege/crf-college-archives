Dr. E. W. Sykes Speaks On Peace With England
Coker President Makes Splendid Address to Davidson Students.

At last Sunday’s “Y” service Dr. E. W. Sykes, President of Coker College, Hartsville, S. C., gave a very interesting and profitable lecture on the subject, “One Hundred Years of Friendship Between the United States and England.” The lecture was well colored by touches of humor and wit throughout. After a few songs, prayer by Gus Summers, and the scripture reading, Matt. 5, by Pat Crawford, Buchanan gave a beautiful selection on the violin, accompanied by Purdy on the piano. The lecture followed.

“The welfare of civilization,” stated the speaker, “is wrapped up in the subject which we have under consideration tonight.” Taking up the settling of America by the French, Spanish, and English, a brief history of the American people was given up until the present time. The Spanish came to America for conquest and gold with which to wage a war on Protestantism in Europe, the French came for trade, and the English came for liberty and freedom. Each got what they sought. The question naturally arose as to which should rule. Hence the French and Indian war was fought, the outcome in 1759 being in favor of the English.

In England, George II was succeeded in 1760 by George III. Influenced by his mother and Blackstone, he strove to become an absolute king, but the English people, with their love of justice, would not stand for taxation without representation. Seeing that his policy met with great opposition from William Pitt and others and that a conflict must ensue, he shrewdly transferred it to America by agitating the colonists, hoping to bring the English people over to his side by such action. The Revolutionary war followed. Fighting ceased in 1781. Terms of peace were signed two years later, chiefly through the instrumentality of Benjamin Franklin, which gave to the United States the land east of the Mississippi river and south of Canada. The great English nation was broken in two parts, but the two to forever remain as friends.

When Napoleon with his desire to rule the world ascended the French throne he set his eyes on the Spanish possessions...

CHIMNEYS OF CHAMBERS ARE RECEIVING OVERHAULING

The chimneys of Chambers are being trimmed and remodeled, mirabile dictu! The top of the venerable old domicile is gradually assuming a more modern appearance. Weather will tell on even a pile of bricks like those in Chambers, and for several years past the tops of the chimneys have been in all stages of decay, which not only looked disreputable but was a source of great discomfort to those residing below. However, for the last few days workmen have been busy tearing down the old tops and putting up new and better ones. The chimneys now taper up at the top instead of having an overhang, which makes a neater and more efficient smoke conductor.

Mr. and Mrs. Fred McGill, missionaries to India, are receiving congratulations upon the birth of a daughter, who bears the name of Frances. Mrs. McGill was Miss Pearl Johnston, a co-ed in the class of ’04.

Position at which Wildcats held Wake Forest for six downs one foot from goal line Saturday.

Wake Forest Is Victor 10-7 In Great Contest
Red and Black Held Opponents Six Times on One-Yard Line.

Wearn Field in Charlotte was the scene of a great battle Saturday between Davidson and Wake Forest, old rivals, in which the latter forced the Wildcats to take the short end of a 10-7 score. Although outweighed 10 pounds a man in the line and 14 pounds in the backfield, the Wildcats put up a classy exhibition of football and until the final whistle blew the outcome of the game was in doubt. With less than two minutes to play Davidson received the ball on its 10-yard line and by passes and broken field running forced the pigskin to the 30-yard line of their opponents. Twice it seemed that Heckman, the big back who played such a remarkable game for Wake Forest, was on his way to the goal line with no opposition before him, but each time the Wildcats caught and threw him before he could pass that last chalk mark.

In the third quarter Wake Forest...

Seniors Win From Juniors And Lose To Freshmen
Pretty Fights Put Up in Class Basketball League Contests.

In a better game than the score would indicate, the Juniors were finally forced to yield to the Senior five by a score of 42 to 22. The game was exciting from the very first and at the end of the first half it was doubtful which team would come out the winners. But at the start of the second half the Seniors got the jump on the Juniors and from then on the latter were never able to overcome the Seniors’ big lead. There was much interest in the game, and time after time the rooters for each side cheered their favorites. Captain George Mauze was easily the star for his fighting Junior five, while Ormond starred for the Seniors. The official line-up follows:

Juniors (22) Position Seniors (42)
Houghton (10) Ormond (C) (16) Right Forward
Brake (2) Freeman (14) Left Forward
Mauze (C) (10) Doubles (8) Center
Money (0) Price (4) Right Guard
Bradley (0) Neal (0) Left Guard

Subs—Juniors: Covington for Brake; Hunter for Covington. Seniors: Cornelson for Neal. Field goals: Houghton 5, Ormond 7, Doubles 4, Freeman 7, Price 2, Mauze 2, Brake 1. Foul goals: 2 out of 7; Mauze 6 out of 11. Referee: Coach Hengeveld. Score keeper: E. H. Mauze.

Fresh-Senior Game.

The Freshmen defeated the strong Senior basketball five Friday night by the close score of 18 to 17. The contest was just as the result indicates, forty minutes of the hardest fought basketball which has been seen on the local court in many a moon. The large crowd present witnessed a classy exhibition of lightning passing and fast floor work on the part of both clubs, and went away satisfied that the class league is going to see some mighty lively times before the final summary. The defeat of the Seniors completely upset the dope, as they were scheduled to romp away with the lowly Fresh, and...

DR. DONALD RICHARDSON TO VISIT ALMA MATER SUNDAY

The program committee of the “Y”...has been unusually fortunate in securing a speaker for the next Sunday night “Y” service. Dr. Donald Richardson has accepted an invitation to come and spend the entire day on the hill. He will speak at both the church services and at the “Y.” Dr. Richardson is a Davidson alumnus. While here he made the honor roll for four years, having the second highest average made since the founding of the college. He is now professor and vice-president at the Theological Seminary at Nanking, China. He is in America now on furlough. Dr. Richardson is a young man himself and comes in constant contact with the young men of China. He will speak about the life of a college man in China as compared with that of one in this country. This will be particularly interesting to Davidson students, since Dr. Richardson's college life in America was the same as ours. He will tell us, too, of Davidson’s part in the missions of China. The combination of such a gifted speaker and such an interesting subject is rare, and an unusually fine meeting is expected.

Wildcats Break Leashes And Take In Queen City

Davidson Special Takes Large Number of Rooters to Town for Wake Forest Game.

For the first time since the Davidson Wildcats were rounded up in September, the bars were let down Saturday and the bloody animals were allowed to roam the plains in freedom. They swarmed from their lair and in mighty packs attacked the Queen City. Strange to say, the inhabitants of the aforementioned city were not in the least alarmed at the sight of the vicious beasts but opened up the gates of the place to the felines and allowed them to roam the streets at will. The Wildcats were conveyed to Charlotte by means of a special train and great was the excitement thereof. The first signs of merriment were displayed before the coaches pulled out of the historic village of Davidson. A lad from Georgia, where they raise ’em wild and wooly, a member of the class whose (Continued on page 5)

advanced the ball by line rushes to Davidson's one-yard line and first down. Four times they bucked the line in a mighty effort to carry the pigskin over but each time failed by less than a foot. On the third down Spratt Moore dived over the line, and met Heckman in mid-air, stopping him in his tracks. A punt by Hunter was blocked back of the goal line and went out of bounds, Wake Forest recovering. The ball was put in play again on the one-yard line and this time it took the heavy Baptist backs three tries to finally carry the ball over. The deciding three points of the game were made in the last five minutes of play by Heckman. Rushing the ball to the Wildcats’ five-yard line again, they failed to gain. Heckman dropped back and drop-kicked the oval between the bars for a win.

Trinity Meets Davidson In Tennis Matches Here

Local Racquet-Wielders Picked and Are in Fine Condition.

Ambitions will be smashed and hopes realized Thursday afternoon when the Wildcats, using the team of Trinity as a lever, pry off the lid of this fall’s intercollegiate tennis. The match will probably be a close one and the Davidson racquet-wielders are bending every effort to come out of the match carrying the Red and Black high above the Methodist colors. The local team has been picked. The two letter men of last year, Bradley and Cunningham, have again won berths on the Wildcat Special that plans to go through the season without suffering a defeat. The other seats on the special will be held down by Ormond and Wilkinson. Prospects are bright for a banner year and the team feels confident that their highest hopes will be realized. Besides the Trinity encounter, the team will also take on Wake Forest before Jack Frost puts an end to the racquet-raising game. Last year’s state champions feel secure in their ability to repeat, but the Wildcats are an obstacle that will have to be overcome first.

The third round of the tournament went off according to schedule, no upsets marring old man Dope’s forecasts. None of the matches went more than two sets. In the semi-final round Bradley easily defeated Wilkinson, 6-1, 6-0, 6-1. In the upper bracket Ormond and Cunningham played the hardest fought match of the tournament. After losing his first two sets in listless fashion, 0-6, 1-6, Ormond seemed to awaken and to play an unbeatable brand of the court game. Although the next three sets were keenly contested, Ormond succeeded in capturing them all, 6-4, 8-6, 6-4.

Davidson scored their first touchdown in the second quarter, on a 50-yard run back of an attempted drop kick of Heckman’s, by Moore, off tackle plays by Bethea and McFadden, and a cross buck in which John Schenck carried the ball into the end zone. Spratt Moore was the outstanding star for the Wildcats. Time and again he was called on to carry the ball around ends and always he made a gain. His playing in the Wake Forest game has caused many followers of football to (Continued on page 2)
