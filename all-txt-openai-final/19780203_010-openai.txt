Former Senator Sam Ervin entered the 900 Room last Friday afternoon, shook hands with C. Shaw Smith, poured himself a
cup of coffee, and sat down in front of the stage to confront an assemblage of over a hundred students.
In appearance, he was much the same man that graced national television and the cover of Time magazine a few
years ago, perhaps a little older, yet younger than his seventy-eight years might indicate. But beneath the skin, he was
much more at ease. Gone were the days of senatorial debate. Gone were the days of Watergate and a torn
nation. The man was just what he should be, a retired, venerable statesman free to discuss his life of dedicated
public service. And the audience was eager to hear what were indeed words of wisdom.

Ervin began the discussion with warm words of praise for his former colleague, Hubert Humphrey. The remainder cannot be described;
it would be an injustice to do so. Instead, the material that follows includes quotes and paraphrased statements made by
Senator Sam.

On Bert Lance: “If I had any money, I wouldn’t want to put it in the bank like Bert Lance’s.”
The senator said he admired President Carter’s sticking by the former budget director.

On Jimmy Carter’s first year as President: “His intentions have been the best in the world, and I admire his
openness.” As for the President's mistakes, “experience in office makes a president.” He should not have become “immediately active in
such matters as the Panama Canal and ERA, which I believe to be second in importance.” Carter did the right
thing in relieving Mr. Morrison as a D.A.

Proper U.S. role in South Africa: We should deal more with domestic affairs, rather than intervening in the affairs of
other nations. “I remember a story my grandfather once told me. He was returning home one evening, when he heard
a woman’s screams coming from a familiar farmhouse. Curious, he entered the house only to find a friend beating his
wife. He said, ‘Henry, you ought to be ashamed.’ The man’s wife picked up an iron skillet beside the hearth
and replied, ‘If you don't get out of here, I'm going to hit you with this thing. If Henry wants
to beat me, that’s his business and none of your’n.’ I guess that's what we ought to do with these
foreign nations: leave them alone.”

On the Democratic Party: One ought to make decisions using one’s “God-given faculties,” not necessarily according to party policy, for
“truth will eventually emerge out of difference of opinion.” As for the current North Carolina senate race, “I don't endorse
particular candidates. I endorse the whole Democratic ticket.”

On Jesse Helms and the two-party system: “I hope the Republican Party will continue to be a major political party.
I’m a firm believer in the two-party system. We need it for our government to work. Personally, I’m very fond
of Senator Helms, for I can disagree with him without being disagreeable. I’m a friend of most all Republicans except
on election day.”

Why Andy Young has kept quiet recently: “He probably heard the old adage that a man hardly ever regrets saying
too little.”

Executive terms: “Governors should not be able to run for re-election. They’ll spend too much time running for a second
term, and so will their appointees; and not enough time being statesmen. I also think we should have a one-shot
presidency. I think we’d be much better off. Power corrupts.”

On labor unions: “Every man ought to have the freedom of joining or not joining a union. I don't believe
in compulsive unionism. I told George Meany that if the unions, just like churches, can’t get their members by persuasion,
they ought to leave people alone. They ought to worry about themselves and stay out of politics.”

The current volunteer army and national defense: “The volunteer army is a cop-out for politicians that want support from young
men who are opposed to the draft. Every able-bodied individual ought to have to serve, regardless of most circumstances, for
a specific time, in addition to maintaining a volunteer service. Retirement age for the armed services ought to be a
lot more than twenty years,” for military retirement and “Social Security are going to become our biggest financial burden.”

Hyman Rickover “Has a lot of power [See SAM, page 12] ... The U.S. Government Awards the Ram-Jet Supercharger Patent
No. 3118435. And dual patents pending NOW! BETWEEN 1107 / MORE MILES PER GALLON FOR YOUR CAR New Ram-JetActually “Jet
Assists” Your Car Engine... Makes It Burn Up To 15 Gallons Of Air For Every Gallon Of Gas... And Gives
You As Much As 15% More Clean Power! Jet Like Acceleration!

We believe Ram-Jet is the most exciting piece of high-performance automotive equipment since the V8. Yet it weighs only a
few ounces. Installs in a couple of minutes (No special tools or training needed—you won't even get your hands greasy).
Costs less than a tankful of gas. And saves you so much gas, it's like getting up to one gallon
in every ten FREE!

The brainchild of Ed Almquist, internationally famous automotive engineer and the “Thomas Edison of high-performance accessories,” the Ram-Jet took over
20 years to develop and perfect. How does it work? Just as a jet engine requires a certain supply of
air to operate, so does the gasoline combustion engine in your car. And it’s the carburetor that mixes this air
with fuel to fire the cylinders and make your car go.

The problem is that carburetors were invented over 50 years ago when gas was plentiful and cheap and air pollution
wasn't even talked about. The carburetor hasn't changed much since then: It's still a big compromise! It only works perfectly
on those rare occasions when all driving conditions are perfect. (Which averages only a couple of minutes at the most
out of every driving hour.) Your carburetor just cannot efficiently adjust itself to your stop-and-go driving, sudden bursts of speed;
or to put it in technical terms, those many occasions when your engine is operating under 0-10" - high-load conditions.
When this crucial mixture of air and gas is not right on the money, the result is a loss of
power with a lot more gas being burned than is really necessary!

SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS
Easy instructions show you how to install in just a few minutes. No special tools. No training needed. Fits all
cars and trucks.

Now, at last, the Ram-Jet to the rescue! It solves both problems at once. It brings your 50-year-old carburetor design
into the Jet Age:
1) It works like a “mini-computer” to automatically adjust the air/gas mixture to your every driving need. It thus steps
up gas molecularization, reducing the over-rich mixture before it becomes wasteful. Just as a jet engine sucks air into it,
the Ram-Jet automatically and safely jets air into the gas mixture the very split second your driving conditions require it.
2) It captures the polluted air that would ordinarily be fed back into your engine and re-energizes it into a
“Jet Stream” that is once again ignited into useful clean power instead of clogging up your engine and making it
hesitate and stall and waste gasoline and power.

Thousands of similar devices sold in Europe for more than $20 apiece. The Ram-Jet Supercharger is now available to you
for just $14.95. Because of a special arrangement, it comes to you direct (no middlemen) from the inventor-manufacturer himself, Mr.
Ed Almquist.

WHAT DO PEOPLE SAY ABOUT THE RAM-JET SUPERCHARGER?
An airline pilot writes: “I have a Ram-Jet. And suddenly my little six-cylinder engine seems to have the power of
an eight. It’s amazing!” — Philip Shade, Plymouth, Conn.

The Rev. P. Mick from Harvey, Illinois says: “So many of my parishioners have a Ram-Jet. We found out that
we average eight to ten more miles per gallon with much more engine pep and power.”
