### Dr. Wendy Farley delivers the 1999 Otts Lectures
**Anger, fear, and lust in Christianity and Buddhism**

Last Wednesday and Thursday evenings, the 1999 J. M. P. Otts Lectures were given in the 900 Room by Dr. Wendy Farley, Associate Professor of Religion at Emory University. The title of the lecture series was “Between the Fangs of Affliction: Passion and Contemplation in Christian and Buddhist Thought.” In the two nights she spoke, Dr. Farley examined and explained similarities between Christian and Buddhist thought on how we can live fuller, more enriched lives.

The lecture on September 29 was entitled “Enthralled: Anger, Fear, and Lust in Christianity and Buddhism.” Dr. Farley suggested that passions such as anger, fear, and lust distort reality due to the ego’s tendency to magnify itself. She discussed the goals of the Christian monk Dorotheus of Gaza and the Buddhist monk Shantideva to transcend these emotions and find compassion. Both thinkers believed that through strict self-discipline, one could overcome passionate emotions and embody compassion. Anger and lust were grouped together, loosely described as masculine passions — those dealing with the pride of the ego. Fear, however, was classified as a feminine passion in that it exhibits the ego’s sense of inadequacy. According to Dr. Farley, the goal of the contemplative traditions of Christianity and Buddhism is a perspective freed from ego distortion — that while you most certainly love yourself, you also demonstrate thoughtfulness for others.

The lecture of the second evening was “Contemplation: The Liberation of Reason.” Dr. Farley explained that present understanding of reason is a narrow interpretation of ancient religious traditions. Reason today refers to using analytic and deductive approaches to comprehend empirical observations. However, while the application of reason to science and technology is useful, logical or technical reason distorts reality because it only deals with directly observable aspects of the world. In Christian and Buddhist traditions, reason had broader connotations. This permitted the application of reason to such questions as “What is justice?” and “What is truth?” Dr. Farley explained that in Christian and Buddhist thought there is a belief that through application of thought and dedication to a task, one can reach a higher contemplative stage of reason—a stage which once reached, liberates.

What does this mean for Davidson students? Dr. Trent Foley of the Religion Department suggests that, according to Dr. Farley’s lecture, classical Christian and Buddhist thought proposes that students think of studying as more than simply a means to get a good grade. It becomes instead a discipline through which something higher can be experienced. “That would put a whole new spin on studying, making it, perhaps, a more spiritually significant activity than one might initially suspect,” Foley said.

### Campus center construction to begin soon
*Story continued from Front page*

Ted Baker of Jacksonville, Fla., co-chaired the Campus Center Fundraising Committee. The Center will be named for the family of Carl and Emily Knobloch, major sponsors of the project. The parents of two Davidson graduates, the Knoblochs have been strong supporters of the college for many years, serving on several committees and helping to fund scholarships and the college’s indoor tennis center. Mr. Knobloch is the retired chairman and CEO of Production Operators Corp., and is currently chairman of Automated Logic Corporation. The Knoblochs reside in Jackson Hole, Wyo., and will be on hand for the groundbreaking ceremony.

According to Dean Shandley, “Davidson by its very nature — small, rural, residential — is an ideal spot for building a strong sense of community. Having a central gathering place for students, faculty, and staff to come together daily will take full advantage of these opportunities.” Davidson students will not be alone in...benefiting from the new Center. The state-of-the-art performance hall will host Artists Series, traveling shows, and student performances, all open to the general public. “The theater will be an opportunity for the college as a whole and provide new visibility for a variety of performances,” says Joe Gardner, Davidson professor of theatre and speech.

The groundbreaking ceremony will feature performances by the Davidson Jazz Ensemble and a cappella groups, the Delilahs and the Generals, as well as remarks from College President Robert F. Vagt, Carl Knobloch, and others.

The occasion kicks off the 18 estimated months of construction that it will take to complete the Knobloch Campus Center. As of now, the spring semester of 2001 is the projected finish date. Dean Shandley assuaged some concerns over the construction saying, “The noisiest stuff will take place in the summer.” The firm under contract is MacLachlan, Cornelius, and Filoni out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. This firm was chosen because they specialize in the construction of unions and performing arts facilities in a small college setting. Above all, Dean Shandley expressed the groundbreaking as an opportunity to thank the Knobloch family for making the campus center a reality through their generous donation. Because of the overwhelmingly positive experiences of their daughters Emmy and Eleanor at Davidson, Carl and Emily Knobloch decided to help the college realize its ambition of a new campus center.
