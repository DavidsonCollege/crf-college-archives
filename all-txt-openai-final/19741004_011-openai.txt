Facts In Abundance As a ¥.

By CAPTAIN AMERICA
and
BUCKY
With B.B. and M.T.
Have we got a surprise for
you peons this week! We
actually have facts, yes, you
heard it, actual facts, which
even deal with IMAC results.
On Wednesday a big IMAC
surprise occurred as president
“Bowsie Kuhn” Andrews
helped b.m.o.c, E.H. Little roll
out the first ball to usher in the
'74 flickerball season.
Sudden Sam was supposed
to get the nod but he was busy
checking out the low rent
districts.

In opening action, R-III over
R-Basement; an inter-dorm
contest in an overtime thriller
(yawn), 36 yards to 2 yards.
That’s what you get for living
below sea level in R-B, right
Cocise?

Veteran Dike welcomed R-I
to the game of flickerball 42-0
in a total thrashing. For you
freshmen (or women) this 0
means that R-I did not cross
the goal line. Too bad.

The revamped Gozinyas
totaled their PGD brothers by
a 30-6 slate in an intra-fraternity match. “I thought the
Gozinyas were the Gamms,”
said a slightly bewildered C.A.
Wetzel (M.T.) then said, “Obviously the Gamms that are
Gozinyas are better than the
Gozinyas that are Gamms.”
Eat shit M.T. do-da do-da.

ETC. (What the hell
does that mean?) had a
little extra as they nipped R-II
19-18 in a closey.

On Thursday, the Gnads
“sacked” Emanon in a big upset 12-7.
Midget coach Mark Sumwalt had this to say about his
team’s success, as he
modestly admitted, “Our hall
sucks. If they didn’t have me,
I don’t know where the hell
they would be.” Dig yourself
out of that one Mark!

In another “who cares” contest C-IV swooped on C-III 37-
25 as star q.b. Kevin Dougherty sat this one out suffering
from rabid raccoon bites.

Rob ing and Q.B. Mark

molesters to their opening win
