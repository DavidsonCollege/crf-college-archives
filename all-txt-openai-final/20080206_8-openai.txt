### Presidential Debate

This year, The Davidsonian has decided not to endorse an SGA presidential candidate. After Monday’s SGA debate, our staff was too divided and, more importantly, impressed to limit our discussion to one candidate. Instead, we offer our insight and perspective from the debates in the hopes that a discussion of the merits of each candidate will benefit the student body.

Richmond Blake ’09, class president for the past two years, presented a devoted, approachable, and organized platform committed to fostering a campus environment open to increased diversity. His desire to address the needs of minority groups on campus was notable, and we agree that his self-acclaimed “gentle but persistent” personality is a plus. The only fault we found was his lacking energy. Although certainly passionate and informed, Blake’s stage presence lacked zeal, and this is something an SGA president needs as a speaker.

Current SGA vice president Davis Greene '09 proved to be a relatable candidate and excelled as an engaging and talented speaker. His amiable persona at the podium and eagerness to answer questions were well received and would serve him well in the position as president. Again, we found few faults, one being that he occasionally steered questions towards his own agenda without fully answering the question at hand.

Both Blake and Greene have achieved incredible goals in their respective positions over the last few years. Blake was instrumental in creating co-ed housing as well as increasing the number of recycling bins in dorms and on campus. Similarly, Greene was influential in the successful Real Talk series and has shown great foresight and initiative advocating environmental sustainability. Both have proven their abilities in a way that Seth Kester-Irwin '10 has not. His lack of experience in comparison to the other candidates cannot be denied. Kester-Irwin preached fixing the small problems on campus and cited Blake’s “wish list” initiative and Greene’s multi-cultural resource center as goals too lofty to be achieved in a one-year presidency.

If it is not the role of the SGA to raise these issues and begin change initiatives, then whose responsibility is it to address student concerns? The SGA’s purpose should be to help steer this college towards a better future, and small issues alone will not make a lasting impact on our changing campus.

We'd like to encourage the student body to consider the respective assets of each candidate. We are confident that Blake and Greene would make excellent presidents. So, do not vote for your friend because he is your friend; do not vote for a candidate without serious consideration.

Instead,

The Davidsonian

### LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

**Staff editorial unjustly blames Patterson Court**

While I agree with the principle of last week’s staff editorial regarding environmental issues on campus, blaming Patterson Court for waste isn’t fair. Court rules hold that no beer cans may leave the basement, and this rule is followed almost universally. Any rare beer cans found on the lawn shouldn’t be there per PCC regulations. Those that wind up there are recycled, along with all cans downstairs and all solo cups. It’s worth mentioning that almost all waste stemming from PCC social functions should be credited to the administration, which has repeatedly denied requests by houses on the court to allow kegs, which eliminate all of the aluminum from cans, and to not require solo cups, which require the manufacture of much more plastic than necessary.

### Quick withdrawal from Iraq sets disastrous precedent

**Matt Petit, Guest Columnist**

Vietnam, Somalia, and Iraq: These conflicts defined generations of policymakers. Each involved military operations under embattled presidents and tragic loss of American lives. In all three, the U.S. practiced or considered abrupt retreat. But withdrawal has a price beyond the battlefield. Though most call these interventions failures, each had justifiable goals. But saying that an intervention was justifiable does not mean that it is justified—each casus belli had major flaws. Military planners in Vietnam, Somalia, and Iraq underestimated the difficulties ahead. In these cases, the U.S. contributed to its own hardships, sowing seeds of failure.

Americans have not dealt well with failure, often portraying our efforts abroad as all-or-nothing, requiring full support of the people. When support fades or disappears, these interventions lose legitimacy, funding, and eventually face withdrawal. And while retreat is at times a necessary option, it is not always wise. Quick withdrawal from Iraq is undeniably popular. The public calls for our troops to return, saying that we need to get out.Out of this death-trap and redirect our tax dollars to less destructive projects. This type of withdrawal, however, sets a dangerous precedent both in our policy and in others’. The outcry resulting from Vietnam and Somalia created political and psychological aversions to intervention. The “Vietnam syndrome” kept us out of political and ethnic cleansing in Guatemala and Yugoslavia. Somalia’s aftermath kept focus off genocides in Rwanda and Eastern Congo. The effect of retreat led to ignorance, ignorance to inaction, and inaction to millions of deaths. While just a few hundred U.S. or UN forces could have stopped genocide in Rwanda, intervention was unpopular and hence off the table. An abrupt pullout from Iraq would not only ignite its smoldering civil war, cost countless Iraqi lives, and further destabilize the region. It would also tempt future administrations to fall into the trap of blindness and ignorance. Look at Somalia, Myanmar, Sudan, Eastern Congo, Pakistan, and now Kenya. Once the U.S. and international organs pull back in caution, complex emergencies become catastrophic. Disengaging from the world to deal with our own problems is both illogical and immoral. Following our lead out of Iraq, powerful nations will not lend the necessary manpower to combat these crises. Instead, organizations like the African Union are left with small contingents of poorly-trained and understaffed units stationed in nightmares like Darfur. The rise of these new crises is not a call to turn our backs, wipe our brows, and thank our luck for getting out in time. They are desperate cries to the international community, with the U.S. at its head, to become more involved in peacemaking and peace enforcement. Rather than doing away with the UN, we must strengthen it; providing diplomatic and military tools to address these horrors. Disengaging from the world to deal with our own problems is both illogical and immoral. Global crises like natural disasters, genocide, and human rights violations are our problems because they are inextricably linked to both our security and moral identity. As the most powerful nation in the world, we are also the most responsible. Even in the face of failure, we must never forget that responsibility.

McCain true American, but not true conservative

No one can deny that John McCain is a great American. His father, Admiral John S. McCain Sr., had the power to reassign him from Vietnam combat duty. McCain refused and suffered unspeakable tortures at the hands of beings not worth the label “human.” He was also given the chance for an early release. He chose to remain with his fellow soldiers, showing duty and courage above and beyond most. John McCain the soldier is certainly presidential. John McCain the senator, however, is not. Each year, the American Conservative Union rates the conservativeness of U.S. Senators and Representatives. They view a multitude of votes and see how the congressmen voted, rating them on a 100-point scale. McCain has a lifetime rating of 82.3. For reference, Sen. Jim DeMint has a lifetime rating of 98 while Sen. Hillary Clinton has a lifetime rating of 9. However, McCain’s rating has recently taken a dive. From 1990-1997, his average rating was 88; from 1998-2006 it was 74. In 2006, the most recent year of ratings, McCain merited a 65. Why have his ratings plummeted? Over the past several years, John McCain has come to love being the media darling. Media darlings do not make good conservatives. He has excoriated corporate America and the wealthy to the point of opposing tax cuts. McCain has begun to wear Al Gore’s cape and warn of the horrors of global warming. He has voted against English-only initiatives and for the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act, which creates a race-based government for Hawaiian natives. He has also called for closing Guantanamo Bay, wishing to move the terrorists to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas and give them legal rights. I would rather this country’s anti-terrorism strategy not involve bringing terrorists inside our borders, at the very least. McCain loves to be known as the man willing to reach across the aisle by bringing together Republicans and Democrats. But on the way across the aisle he stomps on conservatism and the Constitution. Several abominations have come from those aisle-crossings, but two ugly decisions rise above them all. First, McCain-Feingold—the same Russ Feingold of the “censure the president” crowd. Under the guise of campaign finance reform, this bill in effect revokes the freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment. Second, the McCain-Kennedy decision (Chappaquiddick’s Kennedy) disregarded the sovereignty of the United States, while granting illegal aliens amnesty and a chance for citizenship. It would have left the borders gaping and punished Americans. John McCain is a far cry from a conservative, Constitution-loving candidate. The most recent evidence of this is the endorsement he received from The New York Times. If the Times endorses McCain in the same breath as endorsing Hillary Clinton, he must immediately be discounted. If I were McCain, I would have demanded a retraction or at least attempted to distance myself from that paper. For his actions in Vietnam, John McCain earned the “Great American” label. Few have his courage; Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton do not. Therefore, if only to prevent a White House under one of their thumbs, I will gladly punch the Republican ticket in November for John McCain.
