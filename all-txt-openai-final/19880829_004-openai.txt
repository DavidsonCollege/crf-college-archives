that they might not have learned from orientation?

- “Gain weight quickly and get it over with.” - Caroline Hoffman

aren’t what they’re made out to be, and learn about co-ed showers at odd hours.” - Julie Zimmermann
- “Never leave your meal card anywhere, don’t ask really obviously stupid questions, and leave while you still have the
chance.” - Melissa Givens
- “Get used to feeling like shit and looking like it too.” - Fred Burrell on his way to class
much too early in the morning.
- “You never fail ‘till you stop trying.” - Tracey Perez
- “Never set glasses on the conveyor belt in the Commons.” - Ellen Ott
- “There is time for activities. Get involved!” - Molly Graver
