**Rugby Balances Finesse, Brutality And Beer**

By HUNTER GOURLEY

Know much about that English corruption of American football? Something about it? Anything at all? Nothing? Well, join the crowd — mostly onlookers of course. Only a crazy person would play if he or she were completely ignorant of the game. Then again, many people might maintain that only the completely ignorant play anyway. Perhaps they are correct.

The name of this relatively new (to America, anyway) sport is rugby football or simply rugby. It is catching on in the U.S. and Canada in much the same way that soccer did.

People seem to enjoy rugby for many of the same reasons they like ice hockey. Both sports provide exciting, fast-paced action and full contact, not to mention a precarious balance between finesse and brutality.

Though watching any sport can be enjoyable to some people, spectator satisfaction for most viewers seems logically to correspond to a knowledge — or at least a vague awareness — of the game being played. Many people at Davidson know a little something about rugby simply because of its association with post-match keg parties.

This introduction to rugby is perfectly understandable, since the party no doubt makes much more sense than the match. Spectators and participants alike find no real enigma in these post-game activities: when one is hot, tired, and very thirsty, cold beer tastes great. Besides, nothing takes better care of a headache and other pains, physical (muscle) and social (a lost match), than a few cold ones poured down in rapid succession.

But remember, as a general (informal) rule and common courtesy, it is considered evidence of one’s own bad taste (and perhaps the beer’s good taste) to attend a rugby party without first watching some portion of the match itself.

Remember playing “smear the queer” as a kid? Rugby is similar to that childhood game, but with more rules and some kicking added — all to make it seem more complex, more grown-up.

There are fifteen players on each starting team. Usually the biggest and strongest eight athletes play the forward positions. They function much as an offensive and defensive line do in football. Three shorter, stockier forwards play on the front row. The lightest and most fleet of foot of the forwards occupies the middle position as the hooker. The hooker is supported on either side by the two other forwards, called props.

Behind them is the second row of forwards. These four players must be big and tall because they do most of the pushing and driving against the opposing team.

The last row consists of one person, the eight man, who controls the ball with his foot when his own forwards win possession. Together these eight players form the scrum. Hence the term “scrummer.”

When you see one team’s scrum binding together and locking heads with the opposing scrum, that is called a scrummage. They perform this rather odd ritual in order to possess the ball which the scrum half, or quarterback, tosses into their midst. The hooker taps the ball back into his second row and the entire scrum attempts to outpush their opponents and “walk over” the ball until the number eight man can control it.

Meanwhile the scrum half has run around to pick up the ball and pass it backwards (there are no forward passes) to a group of seven smaller, quicker runners called backs.

The backs are like the running backs of football, but they must also play defense, lateral, and kick. Angling back from the scrum at a 45 degree angle or less, they are composed of the standoff, the inside center, the outside center, and the left and right wings. Behind this line of backs is the fullback, who plays like football’s free safety and lets no man or ball get behind him.

Ideally, the object is to get the ball out to the fastest players, the wings, and advance until a four point try (touchdown) is scored. This ideal is rarely achieved, however. Much can happen to complicate things from the time the ball travels from the scrum to the backs. But this is more than enough for now. Perhaps something concerning the complications next week.
