MOORE'S BATON

and the Band swung into the “Star Spangled Banner.” Eyewitness reports stated that there were at least two French horns,
a trombone, a tuba, and a glockenspiel playing, but these have not been verified. You see, Old Man Winter had
once again put in an appearance and had frozen the valves, tubes, knobs, and whatnot essential to the successful manipulation
of the Band's instruments. A fiercely burning can of Sterno was to no avail, yielding only a scorched hand and
a tarnished horn. Someone suggested singing, but when it was realized that Henry Hansen was not in the crowd, the
idea was abandoned as being worthless, since singing is worthless unless it falls on enlightened ears.

The crisis was here. It was do or die, now; the honor of the Davidson Band was at stake! Officers
and conductors alike stood and gave rousing speeches on the value of an indomitable spirit! Excitement was at a fever
pitch as a vote was taken to decide whether the Band would fail and retreat to the buses, leaving the
field wide open for a raucous Georgia Tech cowbell, or would go through their formations, voiceless and windless, in the
tradition of noble sacrifice. The votes were counted! A shout went up as the results were announced: three for marching,
two against! The other forty-seven eligible voters had gone back to the buses while Captain Jim Larkin was speaking with
terrifying vehemence from behind his baritone case.

But all was not lost. At the halftime, the backsliding Bandsters showed up, wrapped snugly in seat covers with “Trailways”
emblazoned in red on them. The formations were promptly done: a sleigh, a star, a T, and a D. An
awed multitude watched as the brave band of erstwhile musicians did their paces, and then broke into a thundering ovation
as fifty-four sets of cleverly placed ears, noses, and lips turned brilliant blue on the closing strain of “All Hail,
O Davidson.” As the Band filed back into the stands, spirits soared as the crowd doubled in size. You see,
there were fifty people already sitting in the Davidson stands, and the Band catapulted the number to way more, making
the event unforgettable by the unbeatable spirit of the Davidson College Band.

SLUM CONDITIONS

Toilet facilities here are also of the outdoor variety. Not until a fire gutted a Negro dwelling on Brady’s Alley,
less than a hundred yards from Main Street, nearly causing the lives of three of its inhabitants last spring, did
Davidson awaken to the situation. Championing the cause of the Negro situation was Dr. Carl Pritchett, pastor of the College
Presbyterian Church, who organized the citizens of the town in an effort to combat these conditions. After careful investigation and
consultation with experts, the only workable solution found to the problem would be the establishment of a Negro Housing Project.
A plan was devised whereby the project could be carried out on a business basis and not in a strictly
charitable manner.

The basic idea was to provide means for credit for Negroes who desire to build their own homes. Assuming the
responsibility for one of the houses is $3000.00. The Piedmont Bank and Trust Co. would ordinarily lend $1800.00 (60 percent),
with the owner paying $300.00 (10 percent). This leaves $900.00 (30 percent) to be covered. The money raised by the
YMCA Christmas Gift Fund will serve to back the credit on that sum of $900.00 so that the bank can
loan 90 percent of the total cost of the $3000.00 home. The YMCA Christmas Gift Fund for 1950 will be
used to buy government bonds that will bring a 2 1-2 percent interest. This interest will be used as credit
to back the loans. After the situation is well in hand and the money is no longer needed, the money
will be turned back over to the YMCA to be used in some other worthy cause in the Davidson Negro
community.

Bad conditions, such as those that exist in Brady’s Alley and the Davidson stands, and the Band catapulted the number
to way more, making the event unforgettable by the unbeatable spirit of the Davidson College Band.

FRIDAY, DECEMBER 1, 1950 Shearer Town are injurious to mankind, not only physically and morally, but mentally, spiritually and psychologically.
In the words of one of the Negro men of Shearer Town — "A man just doesn’t have no will
to go out and work and try to make something of himself when he ain’t got nothing to come home
to. If he had a nice house that he could be proud of, he'd feel more like trying to do
something to keep it, and his family in good shape.” In the past two years, Davidson students have subscribed successfully
to The YMCA Christmas Gift Fund to aid such worthy causes as the development of a YMCA Camp in Ilo
Ho, in the Philippines, and assistance to students in Marburg University, in Germany. This year, the students have an opportunity
to see first-hand the fruits of their efforts. By helping these people to help themselves, the community will prosper.
