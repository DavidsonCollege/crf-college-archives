THE DAVIDSONIAN, MAY 8, 1924

BANQUET SHOWS SPIRIT GOOD BOY HARRY

Cinder Path Men Place Third In State Meet After Decisive Top Baptists and Methodists at Raleigh—Gracey Bests Javelin Record—Cops First Place

The Wildcat Track Team came out third with 21¾ points, in the state track meet held at North Carolina State College Friday and Saturday, May 2nd and 3rd. Carolina won the meet with a score of 107⅝ points, State came next, having won 57⅝ points, while Wake Forest and Trinity brought up the rear with 14 and 9 points respectively. Carolina won seven first places, State six, the other first place being won by Gracey, of Davidson. Two new state records were made, Hamrick, of State, and Moore, of Carolina, the former hurling the discus 126 feet 9¾ inches, the latter winning the low hurdles in 24 4-5 seconds. Byrum, of State, was high point man of the meet, winning the 100, 220, and 440 yard dashes. Gracey was the chief scorer for the Wildcat aggregation, winning 9 of their 21¾ points, by winning the javelin with a throw of 167 feet 7 1-5 inches. This throw bettered the former college record established by McComb last year, by 9 feet 11 1-5 inches. Gracey also came in third in the high hurdles and fifth in the shot.

The other points were won by Streibich, who tied for third place in the pole vault, winning 2½ points; by McConnell, who placed third in the mile, hanging up three points for the Presbyterians; by Williford and Goodykoontz, who won fifth in the two mile and 220 respectively, each receiving one point, and by McBryde, who tied with three others for fifth place in the high jump, winning a quarter-point.

Laird Relieved by Boushe in Third Inning Which is Disastrous Frame—Spikes is Trinity’s Star Batter

An avalanche of hits coming at times when they were most needed, gave the Trinity Methodists a 12 to 4 victory over the Davidson tossers in Gastonia last Saturday afternoon. Laird, pitching the first three innings for the Wildcats, was accorded miserably.

Timely Hits of Blue Devils and Errors By Wildcats Give Trinity Gastonia Game

Vance led the team in batting, each with four hits. Boushee was right behind them with a double and a triple to his account. Moore, R., was the big hitter for the South Carolina boys. Hannah pitched good ball except for the fatal 6th and 13th innings. The P. C. team led with the score at 4-1 until the sixth, when Hannah showed signs of weakening. The bases were full with no out when he hit Kimbrough and walked Boushee and Simpson. They all three came in on Covington’s sacrifice hit and Vance’s.

Washington and Lee

The Wildcat cinder men closed their invasion of the Old Dominion with their most disastrous defeat of the season when they met the stellar Washington and Lee aggregation at Lexington on Monday, April 28th. The final tally gave the Generals the big end of a 104-22 score.

Howard, an entree for the United States Olympic team for 1924, starred for the home team and easily featured the meet. He captured first place in both the 880 and the mile, and apparently could have taken the two-mile with ease, when he came in only a second behind his running mate.

For the first time, Gracey, the Wildcat track star, failed to take a first place. However, he covered himself with glory when he hurled the javelin 160 feet 3 inches, smashing the college record by almost a foot; he also accounted for 9 of the Wildcats’ meager total of points. McConnell and Captain Streibich copped second honors in the mile and pole vault respectively. Other Red and Black men placing were Anderson, Williford, and Koenig. In the last event of the day, Red Anderson, the Wildcat dark horse, sprained his ankle when he heaved the javelin 155 feet for a good third place. The results are not available.

CHAMPION WIELDERS OF WILLOW BEING DECIDED

The class baseball schedule has been cut down to an elimination series of three games this year. This is due to the fact that the varsity field can only be used this week, and the freshmen field is not suitable for games at the present time. Work is to be started Monday planting grass on the regular field and it is for this reason that no games are to be played after this week. Managers were elected by the different classes last week and the following men were selected: G. M. Hodgin, Senior; Ed. Morrison, Junior; N. E. Sappenfield, Sophomore; and J. C. Bernhardt, Freshman. A schedule has been worked out by the managers and eligibility rules made. The schedule worked out was for the Freshman-Sophomore game to be played Monday, the Junior-Senior game.

Not all of the past should be forgotten, though. Particularly, one event of the past week, when Harry Price kept the state singles championship for Davidson. Harry played stellar ball at Greensboro, for when his opponent had already copped two sets, he came back and took the next three. Good work. This makes the third straight year Davidson has copped the singles championship. And Staley and Price didn’t miss much bringing the doubles championship back to the Hill, either, for they stayed in there until the semi-finals. Good work all the way ‘round.

Gracey loses his shoe in the state meet in high hurdles, and still gets third place. Some folks argue that if he had lost both of them he would have come in first. We argue, though, that if he hadn't lost his one shoe there would have been a different tale.

Red Laird certainly stuck in there and fought them this past season. He pitched some great battles. By the way, how does this sound: Davidson 5, Oak Ridge 5 (10 innings). Davidson 1, State 2 (12 innings). Davidson 5, Furman 8 (12 innings). Davidson 7, P. C. 4 (13 innings). That doesn’t sound so bad after all, does it? Indicates some good games were played. Twenty-five innings in two days would sound like three games, almost, but it only meant an extension for a few innings of good work.The two games listed above. The Freshmen seem to stand in a good way toward the interclass baseball championship. They are using their regular team, and they know how to work together. The Sophs received their defeat Monday, 5-2, and the Yearlings are meeting the winner of the Junior-Senior fracas today. That was a good game Monday, parenthetically speaking.

When one sees Sapp handle that ball out on short he can’t help but believe that Sapp has the idea that he’s still behind the bat. The grapplers are going to have a big trip next year when they meet Uncle Sam’s navymen at Annapolis. You may be sure they are going to train hard with this big meet in view. There'll be other important matches, too. Cromartie is training hard for his Olympic trials. Everybody is hoping that he'll maintain that enviable record of his, and we're going to watch for the results after we leave here.

Trinity scored six of her nine runs, the Davidson fielders played on nearly even terms with the Methodists. Trinity’s six runs in the third frame were made when Turner and Spikes singled past third, Bruin doubled, Dempster doubled, and Johnson and Chappen singled. Davidson's first two runs were scored in the initial inning of the game. Sion Alford was hit by a pitched ball, Marrow scratched an infield hit, sending Alford to second, both runners were advanced on Smith's sacrifice. When Vance singled, both runners crossed the home plate. Again, in the seventh, Davidson scored two runs, when Saunderson, the Trinity hurler, went up in the air, walking four men. He was replaced by Dempster, who held the Wildcats scoreless.

Spikes, Trinity’s star fielder, was the hitting ace of the game, getting a home run, a double, a single, and walking once out of his four trips to the plate. Laird demonstrated his versatility by playing jam-up ball in left field after being called from the slab, and by handling first base like a veteran when he was shifted from the field.

P. C. Game
With Laird pitching in top form and the rest of the Wildcat crew hitting the ball freely at all times during the game, the Davidson ball club triumphed over Presbyterian College in a 13-inning game. The game was played at the fairgrounds at Rock Hill, on Tuesday, April 29th. The outstanding feature of the game was Laird’s ability in striking out the P. C. men, 20 of them fanning at his air-tight ball. Marrow and Alford gave able outfield support, resulting in nine runs for the Trinity batsmen. Boushee went to the mound near the end of the third inning, and Laird was shifted to left field. Except for the third, in which Trinity scored six of her nine runs, the Davidson fielders played on nearly even terms with the Methodists.
