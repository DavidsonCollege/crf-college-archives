Davidson tops VMI for McKillop’s 177th

He tried to sneak away. He tried to stroll quietly off the court as he had done so many times
before. But the flashing “177” on the scoreboard and his team conspired against him, forcing Bob McKillop to stop at
center court before a standing ovation from the Belk Arena crowd.

With Davidson’s 68-60 victory over VMI Saturday night, McKillop recorded his 177th win, surpassing “Lefty” Driesell’s benchmark to become Davidson’s
all-time winningest coach.

“I am humbled and honored,” said McKillop. “But you can’t win 177 games without great players, a great coaching staff,
and a great college community supporting you. My thanks to my players, the fans, the coaches, this college’s administrators and
faculty, and my family.”

In addition to breaking Lefty’s record, McKillop and the Wildcats snapped a four-game losing streak in their first home conference
win of the season.

“Any time you can break a four-game losing streak and win a conference game at home, it’s exciting,” said McKillop.

Neither the Wildcats nor the Keydets produced any offensive fireworks during the first half, and Davidson held a slim 3-point
lead at the intermission, 26-23. Most startling of all was the Wildcats’ ineptitude at the free throw line—none of their
six free throw attempts found the basket. By the end of the night, only four of 10 attempts from the
line had been successful.

Wayne Bernard scored a game-high 25 points against ASU.

Sophomore forward Chris Pearson, who made his 18th start of the season Saturday, showed flashes of the great athleticism and
instincts that coaches have touted for the last two years. With three acrobatic hook shots from underneath the basket, Pearson
scored six points in just over three minutes to end Davidson’s first half scoring. He finished the night with 10
points and led the team with seven rebounds.

The offense came alive in the second period to complement the intense defensive effort the Wildcats had put forth all
night. The offensive production helped Davidson keep VMI in check during the second half as the scrappy Keydets fought to
keep the game within their reach. Junior Martin Ides scored 10 of his game-high 16 points in the second half
and sophomore Wayne Bernard tallied 11 of his 16 in the last 20 minutes also.

“I’m feeling really good about my basketball now,” said Ides. “And I think the guys are feeling more confident about
going to me.”

The Wildcats need confidence right now as they face the heart of their conference schedule, which includes two Appalachian State
games, a road trip to Wofford, and a nationally televised contest against perennial south division foe College of Charleston. If
the same Davidson team that played the second half Saturday night shows up to play the remainder of the 2000-01
season, the Wildcats (8-11, 2-4) have a chance to right the ship. The deft ball handling of Bernard, along with
the strong inside presence of giants Ides and Pearson, has the potential for an offensive explosion. And the Belk Arena
fans saw flashes of that concoction Saturday.

According to Ides, “I think we can put things together. We keep doing the things we have been doing—playing hard
in practice and making shots—and now it’s finally coming together.”

ASU overpowers Wildcats

If the Wildcats ever discover the formula for success this season, they may look back on Tuesday as the day
they hit rock bottom. Davidson (8-12, 2-5) suffered its fifth loss in six games, this time in a 78-68 loss
to an Appalachian State team coming into the game with a 5-14 record without its top two scorers from last
season.

As has been the case many times these last few weeks, there isn’t one thing you can point to as
the reason for the loss. The Wildcats’ 35.5 percent (22-62) field goal percentage...

Pct goal shooting percentage certainly jumps out at you first. Two of six free throw shooting also catches your eye.
But the stat sheet doesn’t fully explain the Wildcats’ continuing struggles. In a game they never led, Davidson simply could
get nothing going offensively. That more than anything else is why the team has fallen to the bottom of the
North Division of the Southern Conference.

“With the record we have, we are less than mediocre,” said head coach Bob McKillop. “We don’t have the luxury
of skipping a beat. We can’t afford to have two or three guys off the page. That’s what happened tonight.”

The free throw line, which had plagued the Wildcats for most of the season, instead helped them make a second-half
comeback. Wayne Bernard and Jason Dickens each connected from the line to cut Appalachian’s lead to one at 47-46. But
that was as close as it would get. Bernard (25 points) and Jason Dickens (16 points) kept Davidson from getting
blown out, but it wasn’t enough. Appalachian used a 14-4 second half run to close the deal. No field goal
was bigger than Noah Brown’s three-pointer at the 6:10 mark with the shot clock winding down, which gave the Mountaineers
a comfortable six-point cushion down the stretch.

“They had tremendous patience,” McKillop said. “They were able to execute just as the shot clock was winding down. They
deserved to win this game.”

Davidson suffered an 84-70 loss to the Statesboro, Ga. After falling behind by 11, Erege and Michael Bree, and Jason
Dickens and La game-high six boards.

Drexel 84, Davidson 73. Sophomore Jason Dickens became the first Wildcat in nearly five years to score more than 30
points in a game, but his effort alone could not save Davidson from defeat December 26 in Albuquerque, N.M. Drexel
got 29 points from senior center Joe Linderman to counter Dickens’ 31, helping the Dragons to an 84-73 victory in
the opening round of the Lobo Invitational hosted by the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, N.M.

Davidson 75, William & Mary 70. Neither Davidson nor William & Mary held more than a five-point advantage the entire
game until the Wildcats took control with under three minutes left in the game en route to a 75-70 victory
in the December 30 consolation round of the Comcast/Lobo Invitational hosted by the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, N.M.

Davidson 73, Western Carolina 57. Junior Emeka Erege led Davidson with 23 points—20 in the first half alone—as the Wildcats
won their conference opener 73-57 on the road at Western Carolina January 3. Davidson opened up a 19-point lead at
the half as Erege scored half of the Wildcats’ 40 points, thanks to a career-high four three-pointers. In the second
half, sophomore Jason Dickens became the top Wildcat offensive weapon, as he tallied 14 in the period to finish with
18 for the game.

UNC Greensboro 69, Davidson 68. The Spartans of UNC Greensboro rallied from a seven-point deficit with 2:30 remaining to defeat
the visiting Wildcats by a final of 69-68 January 6 in the Wildcats' second conference game of the season. Peter
Anderer, a 6-1 guard from New York, N.Y., hit 8-of-10 field goals, including 5-of-6 from beyond the arc, to lead
the Wildcats in scoring with 21 points.

ETSU 59, Davidson 55. The Wildcats lost in the waning seconds of the January 8 home contest as East Tennessee
State won a 59-55 game over the Wildcats that was riddled with miserable free throw shooting. ETSU managed to shoot
just 32.3 percent from the field, and not much better from the free throw line (44.4 percent). But with the
game on the line, the Bucs hit the free throws that counted the most. D.J. McDuffie drained two free throws
with 15 seconds left to give ETSU a 58-55 lead.

Georgia Southern 84, Davidson 70. Georgia Southern Eagles January 13 in Statesboro, Ga. After falling behind by 11 early in
the second half, the Wildcats rallied to take a 57-56 lead with 10:13 left.
