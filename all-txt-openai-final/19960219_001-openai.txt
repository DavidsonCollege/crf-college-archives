**SGA issues a minors resolution**
**Proposal prepares to go before faculty for vote**

The quest for minors has entered Round Two of its struggle to gain faculty approval. Tuesday, the SGA unanimously approved
the Council on Academic Affairs’ revised proposal for the institution of minors into the official curriculum.

The new proposal would make minors optional for departments to offer, constitute 5 to 7 courses in the desired subject,
and require a 2.0 GPA for all students wishing to minor. It would also not allow students to pursue two
minors or minor with a double major. The changes allow for departmental flexibility in creating a minor and would not
require departments to offer a minor.

The proposal is now before the Educational Policy Committee, where it will undergo a one-month review. The EPC wants to
make sure the new proposal is significantly changed and will check with peer institutions that have minors about the administrative
costs and success of such a program.

According to Senior Rick Onkey, who attended the EPC meeting, the EPC “sensed a lack of student support for minors.
Despite the SGA vote, many teachers had not heard personally from students on the issue.”

Director of Career Services Carol Jordan states minors would let “the student make himself or herself more unique and competitive
(in trying for jobs) and will be to that student’s advantage.”

The CAA proposal responds to those worried that minors will dilute the liberal arts experience by saying, “The core requirements
for graduation already encourage students to explore a variety of courses in different disciplines.”

Sophomore Psychology major Brian Weddell favors minors, saying, “I already will have enough courses in Spanish and French to get
minors in those areas, but instead I can only list them as unofficial ‘concentrations’ on my resume.”

The EPC should vote on the proposal sometime in the middle of March. If it passes there, it will be
up for formal and final approval during the April faculty meeting. If it survives that vote, minors would be available
for students to pursue beginning next semester.

SGA President Warren Buford states, “If students want to have minors, they better become vocal about it to faculty members.
With student-wide support, the measure can get passed.”

**CANNING THE KEG**

The days of kegs will soon be over — the Self Study Sub-committee on Student Life found that they are
too risky. See more self-study results on page 2.

Some call it the “end of an era.” Others are calling it “safety precautions.” Everyone agrees it will be a
major change in the way Davidson parties on Patterson Court.

As a priority recommendation from the recently released self-study states, “The college should ban the use of common containers, including
kegs, for any student social function on campus.” The self-study says a “double standard” is being set by allowing kegs
on Patterson Court but banning them from all other areas on the campus. In addition, all seven national fraternities ban
the use of kegs and spending ofChapter funds on “Sr |Self-study recommends that kegs be banned from the Court. “The
policy will be enforced,” says Holmes. Following this policy would lead to: BYOB or — Dean Shandley states the change
as one “about safety and health, not about abolition or abstinence.” At the forum, a North Carolina Governor’s Council report
was cited. This reported that it found Davidson to be the only college in the state to allow kegs at
parties. John Cowan, PCC president, indicates his concern for the current policy and assured the change was not totally an
alcohol control tactic by the administration, but an issue of insurance. He says, “The insurance problems began to worry almost
everyone on the council. Even if we all say that we would not sue (in the event of an accident)
it is no guarantee that a parent or insurance carrier would not (sue) also.”

Stating, “Considering that most of the college’s policies relating to the court aren’t enforced anyway, I don’t think this will
make that big of a difference.” Junior Suzy Spressert, Rusk President, says, “I think that eventually the school is going
to have to make some major changes. I understand that we’re going to have to move to BYOB in the
future ... but I don’t think we’re ready for that until we do (further) research.” Despite the mixed student reaction,
it seems most will simply have to prepare for the change. According to RLO director, see Party’s over on page

Davidson’s men’s and women’s Swimming and Diving Teams battled to strong finishes in the Southern States meet, held at Davidson
this past Thursday through Saturday. “We went into this meet talking about it being six sessions over three days. We
were very good every session, and we got better over the course of the six,” Head Coach said. “There was
tremendous support, and with the training done and the competition experienced and the passion, I thought they (the team) were
excellent.”

Georgia Southern won both the Men’s (661 points) and Women’s (771.5 points) titles, but Davidson’s swimmers recorded many personal bests.
“You can’t really be disappointed by that (not winning) when you swim so well. It’s a lot better to go
in and swim well and place 3rd than to win and not swim well. So there is no disappointment,” Senior
Churchill Hooff said. Senior Katharine Welling echoed Hooff’s sentiments. “The meet went really well,” she said. “There were a lot
of great swims, and we had a lot of fun. We came together well as a team. This was a
great way to end my four years of swimming here.” Welling broke a school record in the 200-yard backstroke (set
earlier this season by Allison).
