THE DAVIDSONIAN
TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 10, 1998

On Saturday, Nov. 7 at 8 p.m., students, faculty, and community members crowded into Chambers Gallery for the fifth annual FLAG (Friends of Lesbians and Gays) fashion show. This year, the show was MCed by Bill Stoops and Dan Wingate. As they were introduced by FLAG’s co-presidents Brad Shipman and Alice Owens, Stoops and Wingate made quite an entrance, setting the tone of cutting-edge fashion for the evening. While Stoops was the epitome of style right down to his black platform shoes, Wingate wowed the crowd with a form-fitting, short black dress.

The evening’s models were just as smashingly attired (or un-attired, in some cases). Each act had a particular theme, with music and choreography to complement the fashions. Former co-presidents Emmi Happoldt and Irene Middleton were decked out for the holidays in Santa hats, gold tops, and festive red sequined bras. The Union Board emerged as sprightly fairies, then bowed to the command of their fearless leader Cintra Pollack. The creators of the Gender Resource Center made quite a statement in gender-bending fashions that were both creative and thought-provoking. Models Brian Joyce and Maggie Avery showed by example.

Perhaps the classiest act of the evening was a collection of fashions titled “Styles of Brotherhood” and modeled by 15 of the student body’s African American men. This last act was followed by the presentation of awards by Middleton and a final appearance on stage of all of the show’s models. The FLAG fashion show, always one of the year’s most highly anticipated and well-attended events, was once again a huge success. Hopefully, its message was not lost on the audience: the empowerment and excitement that comes from a campus-wide focus on diversity should concern us every day. The FLAG fashion show should serve as a call to attention to diversity, not just an annual attempt at creating awareness.

Violinist Koljonen performs stellar recital

Distinguished chamber musician and recitalist Martha Koljonen presented a violin recital in Hodson Hall on Monday, Nov. 9. Accompanying Koljonen were pianists Ruskin Cooper, a teaching associate in the Davidson Music Department, and Katerina Souvorova, Davidson’s staff accompanist.

Koljonen’s program included “Tempo di Minuetto in the Style of Paganini” by Fritz Kreisler and “Three Dances for Solo Violin” by Donna Kelly Eastman. She also presented Beethoven’s Sonata No. 1 in G Major, Op. 96 and Brahms’ Sonata No. 3 in D Minor, Op. 108. Despite the challenging nature of the repertoire, Koljonen gave spirited, energetic, and immaculate performances of each of these works. The crowd responded with great enthusiasm and reverent applause upon the conclusion of the Brahms sonata, a work that demanded both virtuosity and stamina.

Koljonen began studying violin at age eight in Detroit. She earned her Bachelor of Music degree from Cleveland Institute of Music where she studied with David Cerone. Koljonen has also studied under Mischa Mischakoff and Jasha Brodsky. Her career has included playing in the Opera Orchestras of Santa Fe and St. Paul, the Alabama Symphony, and the Virginia Symphony. She has served as concertmaster in both the Savannah Symphony and the Charlotte Symphony. She has been a member of the Charlotte Symphony since 1980. Koljonen is also Davidson’s violin instructor and director of string studies.

Koljonen has also co-founded and played with numerous smaller musical groups. In Savannah, she was a founding member of the Chamber Soloists.of Savannah. She was the violinist of the Birmingham Musica Antiqua and also in the New Cadek Piano Quartet in Tuscaloosa, Ala. In the Charlotte and Davidson area, Koljonen is the violinist in the Nikos Trio. Bill Giduz and Melissa de Castrique contributed greatly to this article.
