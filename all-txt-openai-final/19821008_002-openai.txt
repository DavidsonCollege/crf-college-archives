### Trimester & Semester

Semester or trimester? This is a question that is going to be mentioned more often than band parties during rush for the next two weeks. Already you can hear little snaps of conversation like, “One hundred courses? We’ll lose one hundred courses?” and, “Man, I could really go for fewer exam periods. I mean with Humes and all.”

Judging from the response at Wednesday’s open Semester Planning Committee meeting for students in Chambers’ Gallery, a lot of students are taking this issue seriously. Most students were concerned about the possible change to semesters lessening the academic potency of a Davidson education. And rightly so; there is no excuse for a change in scheduling to adversely affect academics.

Although the proposal to change from trimesters to semesters is straightforward, the reasoning behind it is somewhat more complex. It is hard to tell exactly if the positive aspects of semesters outweigh the negative unless it is put into operation. For example, will more time for faculty and student research outweigh the loss of approximately 100 courses during a school year and an increase of one and a half students per class? Will enough students take advantage of the expanded exchange possibilities with other students on semester systems? These questions complicate the issue considerably. It is considerably better to try to think them out as best possible beforehand. The school need not afford the frustration of moving to an unsuccessful calendar system.

This is an important issue and deserves lengthy discussion. It may be that a semester system would significantly improve the quality of education here.

On Tuesday, 12 October, the SGA will hold a student referendum on the issue. The results will be presented to the faculty.

We at the Davidsonian would like to know what you think about the semester-trimester debate. Send us your letters either pro or con and we will print a group of the best of each in next week’s paper. (Be sure to follow the letters policy.)

Following are a few points you might want to consider:
- Would a semester system increase or decrease academic pressure (and is that good or bad)?
- Is it better to have fewer breaks, and why?
- Is longer faculty and student research time worth fewer classes and more students per class?
- Is it better to concentrate on fewer courses for longer or to take more shorter courses?

Think about it, vote, and send us a letter.

### Good & Bad

BY A. G. MEADOR ’85

Here’s the thing. After reading this week’s letters about Good and Bad Things, I don’t think anyone can dispute the Badness of this week. The stock complaints about eight midterms plus the Fiji party just about broke the mailbox, and these are legitimate Bad Things. But I noticed a theme in other letters that I think bears some examination.

In short, nature is fighting back. Last Tuesday night, while returning from a crepe-filled study break, I experienced one of the most intense frights ever. By mere smell alone, I thought I was back at The Upper Room, a small devotional publisher/tourist attraction with whom I had an internship last summer. That scent—that cloying, insidious smell—of Millie-the-circulation-secretary’s perfume was there, was with me. The farther I walked, the more intense it got. I have been found out, I thought; Someone is finally getting even with me for all the Bad Things I said last summer about Millie’s perfume. And I understood; it is one thing to denigrate someone in a secular organization, but this was The Upper Room and everything, and Millie was nice.

So I figured, this is it. Millie’s perfume is mine for life, my own Scarlet Letter. Embarrassing, maybe. But even Hester got used to looking like a cheerleader; I could at least buck up and face the music. And then I passed someone exclaiming to a companion, “...and these bushes are just lovely, don’t you think? Nature’s perfume, just for us.” Yow, I thought. I’m saved! It’s just those goshdarn bushes. No problem. I’ve been let off, after all.

But I kept thinking. Other Bad Things involving nature besides those stinky bushes have been prominent on campus this week. For example, my roommate was assaulted just the other day by a squirrel hurling large, green nuts at her. Bad Thing. An omnipresent black dog on our campus is always seen in different locations, but it has never been observed in motion. Bad Thing. Ants have started holding youth propagandist rallies in our dorm; they practice marching in our sink, on my expensive typewriter, and across any food left out. Bad Thing. Finally, someone wrote in that everything is dying. Nature is not only fighting back, it has decided to pack up all Frank Hobart’s bushes and trees and go somewhere else. Even the pretty fall leaves [suggested by one as a Good Thing] are ultimately Bad: when used as a dessert topping or breakfast cereal, they turn soggy immediately.

Keep up the great response. Word has it that this is the most popular feature ever. Bring letters to the Davidsonian office before Tuesday night. Like we have deadlines here...

Next week: In-depth interview with Gray Chucques, exchange student from Seoul, Korea. Topic: “Why My Shoes Are Fit to be Tied.”
