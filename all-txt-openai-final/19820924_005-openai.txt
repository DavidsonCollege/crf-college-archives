### New Professors on Campus

#### C. Shaw Smith

This fall, C. Shaw Smith begins a two-year appointment as the new associate professor of Art History. Smith is the son of Union Director C. Shaw Smith Sr., and his appointment to the faculty marks his return to the Davidson community after a fifteen-year absence.

Smith finds that he, and not the college, has changed: "I’m so different... I’m seeing a whole new side of it. I enjoy the discussion, the intimacy, the focus on particular events. It’s a participatory place.”

Smith, who attended UNC-Chapel Hill as a Morehead scholar, received his master’s and doctoral degrees in Art History. His interests are diverse. They span from athletics and “crummy” novels to “Delacroix and Romantic Landscape Painting,” the subject of his recently completed dissertation.

A bachelor, Smith’s first love is France, where he spent two years studying and traveling. In May of 1980, Smith was involved in a “sequel to history,” serving as a translator/reader for Pope John Paul II’s mass for the people in France. Someday he hopes to live and teach permanently in France, a country in his eyes with only one negation—“They don’t have any pro football teams.”

#### Maj. David C. Hill

Maj. David C. Hill, assistant professor of military science, is a member of the National Guard called to duty for a single tour with Davidson’s Army ROTC unit.

Hill, who has served for nine years with the police department in Columbus, GA, holds bachelor’s and master’s degrees in criminal justice from Columbus College. While on active duty from 1957-72, he was commissioned as an infantry officer and served at Fort Benning and in Vietnam.

#### S. Shepard Jones

S. Shepard Jones, retired Burton Craig professor of political science at UNC-Chapel Hill, will spend the fall term at Davidson as Covington Distinguished Professor of Political Science. A Middle East specialist, Jones served as a special assistant to the U.S. delegation to the United Nations conference in San Francisco in 1945, and as public affairs officer for the Near Eastern, South Asian, and African Affairs Bureau. He also served tours at the embassies in Pakistan and Amman.

A graduate of Georgetown College in Kentucky, Jones holds a master’s degree from the University of Kentucky. He did additional graduate work at Harvard and at the Geneva School of International Relations, and earned his doctorate at Oxford University, where he studied as a Rhodes Scholar.

#### Karl A. Plank

This September, Professor Karl Plank made a long-anticipated transition from eight years of post-graduate work in Religion at Vanderbilt University to Davidson College. He received his undergraduate degree from Hanover College and believes strongly in the importance of a liberal arts education and the role of religion in this study. “The study of any discipline should be interdisciplinary. A liberal arts education should promote a sense of common inquiry throughout many different but related disciplines.” Plank is particularly excited about teaching a course on Jewish and Christian parables later in the year.

Professor Plank feels that a sense of camaraderie has developed among the small group of new teachers at Davidson. “We try to help each other out with any problem or questions we encounter in what has been a new and very wonderful experience.” At Vanderbilt, Plank served as an organist and has composed hymns. Plank finds his new surroundings both comfortable and intriguing: “I live across from where the sidewalk stops at the end of the cemetery. I’m sure it must be symbolic.”

#### Karen Brautigam

Karen Brautigam, visiting assistant professor of art, recently completed the requirements for the master of fine arts degree at Michigan State University. A graduate of Miami University at Oxford, Ohio, she is a painter.

Her works have appeared in shows at Miami, Michigan State, Northern Illinois University, Western Michigan University, Fort Hayes State University, and elsewhere.

#### Melinda Roshon

Ms. Melinda “Mindy” Roshon is a new member of the psychology department. Born and raised in Ohio, she went to undergraduate school at Denison College. She received a master’s degree in Psychology from Florida State University, and is in the midst of working on her Ph.D.

After working as a student all her life, Ms. Roshon finds that life on the other side of the podium is interesting, but that it involves much more work. She explains it this way: “Preparing each day’s lecture is like preparing a major paper every day.” And we thought three or four a term was rough!

#### Irl C. Bivens

Irl C. Bivens, a native of Monroe, has been appointed assistant professor of mathematics. Bivens is a graduate of Pfeiffer College, and holds the Ph.D. degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

He formerly served as an instructor and as G.C. Evans Instructor at Rice University.
