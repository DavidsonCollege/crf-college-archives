Jump, Little Children

Jump, Little Children will play Richardson Field

By Kate GREENE & JASON SCHMIDT Guest Writers

Before all of you returned to the haven of NASCAR racing, we ventured to the yuppie terror of Jack Straws to preview the sounds of the first concert on campus, Jump, Little Children.

While the venue is a sound catastrophe, the band was funky, eclectic, and musically wild. Accordion, mandolin, cello, upright bass, harmonica, and other musical oddities compose the multifarious sounds of JLC.

Waffling between mellow, folky melodies and demonic rap-like sounds, these Charleston “children” perform a show that is satiating. Musically they travel all ground; at times the drums solo, at others, they provide a completely danceable beat. At others, the electric guitar wails in a heavy metal fashion or simply provides the background sound.

Visually they entertain with the expertise of all true kindergartners. One of their members, inspired by junior Brit Taylor, jumps in the bounciest of fashions while swinging an enormous stand-up bass made suddenly weightless.

Another member, possessed by demons, changes facial patterns with every note and sports a neo-mango silk shirt. Crowd-wise, they'd inspire jumping beans. During their three encores, the band’s spontaneous jams spurred on even the tiredest of fans till the wee hour of 2 a.m.

JLC will be performing on Richardson Field on Thursday, August 29. Gates open at 8 p.m. The show is free for students, faculty, and staff; admission is $5 for the general public. Bring your toys and come prepared to dance.
