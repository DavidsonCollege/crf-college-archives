from Last Summer & Cele. A Postpubescent Romance

Moon never ignores our need’s unmasking

but leers sputtering from a pole at sundown’s cue,

gilding sickly fluorescent her fondling arm,

so what, but Cele stains the window gold--our bed with a view

adds an enigmatic sun for the asking,

she loves me & eggs sunnyside up, Honeymoon!

belts Lady Day, dawn spills again down the high white dune

in this place where we ring with love’s alarm.

The screen door is nervous with flies, east wind

flips bored through pages of reread mags,

I’ve gnawed raw quicks of all but one thumbnail:

with hip rich surfers Cele’s buzzed down

Jamaica way to cop enough dope to lay

us & the rest of July back lazy: icebergs

sink ominously in my tom collins: today

a pastel telegram cries NABBED MONTEGO BAY

STOP UNDER JAMAICA JAIL.

Mother’s adopted home, child of alimony,

gathers its allotted ivy, garland of the nouvelle riche.

I’ve come to perjure me, bribed with wired cash,

for the sake of this dollfaced woman, in a week of correct

manners phrase why my undiploma’d poverty

is not on her account...Taxied to the scallopedged drive,

I tramp between stiff magnolias, rucksack & twilight

in either hand. She’ll be lounged in the gazebo,

perfumed with scotch, stalking her shadow

through a batch of novellas; there. Summoning wiles,

I lift the mosquito net to greet her, wordlessly

she leans my ear to those fallen breasts

which brought me to this pass, dreaming we’re alive.
