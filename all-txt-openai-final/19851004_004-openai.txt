**Features By ANDY CLARK**

Though John Kuykendall begins only his second year as president of Davidson College, he has already observed and experienced many
changes within the Davidson community. It is likely that he will share in many more such changes as the year
progresses. From the following discussion of Kuykendall’s hopes and goals for Davidson College, it seems he will hardly have time
to experience the “sophomore slump.”

**Davidsonian:** You have just completed your first year as president of Davidson College. What important changes have occurred at Davidson
since you yourself were a college freshman?

**Kuykendall:** Of course, in the environment of the campus itself, coeducation is a major, very obvious change. As a concurrent
feature, the increase in size of the student body and consequently the faculty and staff is another change. It is
a bigger place. The situation at Davidson when I was an undergraduate was one of relative simplicity in terms of
organization of the College. The student body was more homogeneous, and a more easily comprehended unit than it is today.
Another remarkable change which we are just now beginning to experience in full force is the change of Davidson from
a relatively isolated, rural community to Davidson as a suburb with distractive business, industry, and inhabitants. It is still a
very particular place to live, what with the coming of Lake Norman and the people there who don’t really face
in on the College, but look out to jobs in other places and the emergence of several industries in the
neighborhood. Maybe the most significant change, though, is the well-deserved reputation the College has for academic excellence. It was good
then, and some people knew it was good. But I think it is better now, and more people know that
it’s very good than did twenty-five or thirty years ago.

**D:** What Davidson characteristics or traditions which you experienced as a student here would you like to see revived (for
example, Chapel)?

**K:** I think the community lacks the opportunity to be together on a regular basis as an entire community. I
am not saying, “Let's reinstitute Chapel,” but I think that the concept of convocation in a broader sense than something
which merely happens twice a year is one which has some merit for a community the size of Davidson. I
would hope that without any rigors of attendance qualifications we could move in the direction of having occasions periodically in
which the whole student body would be invited to come together for a meeting of mutual interest. I am not
saying that we go back to chapel. I am saying that I think that tradition has been abolished entirely only
to our detriment. I think that it would help us as a community if we had other times when we
were expected to come together. In the same way, and again with the same warnings against obligatory attendance, I think
that as a church-related college the community lacks the opportunity to worship together almost completely now. There are many opportunities
for people to worship, and they have a voluntary atmosphere which I think is most conducive to general worship. I
always had some problems as a student with the idea that you are required to show up to worship God.
There does seem to be something of an anomaly to compel people to go to worship and then tell them
they are free people. But the other side of it is, we have indigenous to the College no regular opportunity
for those who wish to come together and worship under the auspices of the College to do so. There have
been experimental worships, but there is a real problem of when and where and how you do it because of
the existence of other worshipping groups in the community. I do think it’s something that the community lacks.

There is at least one apparent change that I noticed when I first returned last year, and that was the
alienation of some of the athletic teams from the college community. I think the atmosphere is much more positive this
year in that regard than last year. It was a shocker to me to go to my first football game
at Davidson in a number of years and to see the scarcity of students at the ballgame. That’s not quite
the case this year, but I think we have a way to come. It was a given in Davidson life
in my generation that you participated as a spectator in sporting events because people you cared about were doing it.
There was a sense of community which has been questionable in the last few years.

**D:** In your Inaugural Address, you spoke of Davidson’s call to scholarship and servitude. Looking ahead, how can the College
continue to develop and strengthen these qualities in its students?

**K:** The seriousness with which the College has already undertaken both of those things, in my judgment, assures a future
which will be positive in that regard. One of the main things I was trying to say in the Inaugural
Address was that these are both traditions to which Davidson has committed itself so thoroughly, that it’s almost unthinkable that
we would back off and go in another direction. With regard to scholarships, Davidson has always had a remarkable balance,
in my judgment, between the traditional, the classic liberal arts approach to things, and the innovative. After my student generation,
Humanities was introduced as a very experimental, avant-garde sort of thing which has come to be in many institutions a
“stock and trade” approach. But Davidson did it early, and Davidson has done it as well as any and better
than most.

**D:** Last year there was a focus on recruiting minority students to Davidson. Do you feel that Davidson is succeeding
in its efforts?

**K:** I think the answer is a qualified “no.” You can argue that Davidson is succeeding better than most, and
that may or may not be statistically verifiable. The fact remains that in terms of...Actual numbers: Davidson has not succeeded
over the last year if one simply plays percentages. One reason, in my judgment, is that we are just now
at the point of the implementation of many of the stipulations of the task force report. The effort to enhance
our recruiting efforts through the hiring of a full-time minority admissions officer is one which could not begin until the
new fiscal year beginning on July 1. Consequently, we don’t know what the presence of a person in that job
will mean for us in the long run. Certainly, candidly, we didn’t do as well as we aspired to do
in our recruiting of minorities for this year. If one counts black minorities, Hispanic-American minorities, and Oriental minorities, we probably
look pretty good compared to previous years in terms of this entering class. But it’s not all the success we
hoped for, and I think Davidson deserves, if not an “A,” at least a “B+” for effort in these last
months. But in terms of performance, I don’t think it is time to give us a grade yet.

D: In terms of the 1984-85 school year, and in terms of the longer range, what major aims or plans
do you have for Davidson?

K: This is the year in which we completed our once-a-decade self-study. In November, we will have a visiting team
here to review with us the self-study to evaluate how we measure up to the standards of the Southern Association
of Colleges and Schools and to make recommendations for how we might improve. Coupled with that is the institution at
Davidson for the first time in many years of a “strategic plan.” It will mean essentially a forecast of the
college generation just ahead of us, say a five-year forecast. We have a task force that is working on the
development of that strategic plan document with an eye toward presenting the document to the Board of Trustees at their
winter meeting in February. The outcome is intended to be a kind of patterned future in which we set goals
and objectives on a regular basis and work toward those goals and objectives. The idea in this document is that
each year you update it. Where some goals are accomplished and can be set aside, then you amend it and
where new goals need to be added, you add them. This is an ongoing process.

In the course of this year, as I mentioned already, the implementation of the task force report and its various
recommendations is a phenomenon of the academic year 1985-86 and not 1984-85. Our situation with regard to intercollegiate athletics is
probably a step down the road but needs to come to greater focus within this next year. Working with Kit
Morris and others, I will be trying to bring that to its conclusion. We are at the near end of
a campaign or a piece of a campaign to complete the solicitation of funds for several good causes — for
the sports complex (the first phase of which is the Knobloch Tennis Center), for the location of a suitable home
for the visual arts, and for the enhancement of the revenues for the endowment of the Dean Rusk Program. We
anticipate and hope for a renewal of our grant from the Sloan Foundation which will enable us to go further
in that new liberal arts program in the next few years. Again, lots of things are happening not out of
continuity with what has gone before, but new steps which show that the college is very much on the move.

D: If you could change just one aspect of Davidson life — whether it be academic, social, or physical in
nature — what would it be?

K: When I got here last year, I said, in an effort at good humor with one of the television
reporters, that I just needed to stay out of the way of people who were doing what they were doing
very well and not mess anything up. And I guess I still feel that way about most things that go
on here. Surely, there are aspects of Davidson life that are less than perfect. I sometimes wonder about the overall
quality of life for students in the Davidson environment, especially in such things as dormitory life. I do not think
that compared to other institutions comparable to Davidson that we have the same quality of community in dormitory life in
terms of maintenance of the facilities and in terms of the shared responsibilities for quiet time for other people. But
the other side is that most people seem to, if not thrive, at least get along all right. I think
we work together and sensitize each other to things. I think that last year, if you had asked me the
same question, I would have said we need to make ourselves aware of where we are with respect to racial
minorities and where we ought to be. That is still a concern, but I think we have come a step
toward at least envisioning the kind of future we want there and working toward that future. In other areas, I
feel that we will be doing the same thing. Right now, under the auspices of the Sloan Foundation, we are
engaged in the “New Liberal Arts.” The intention of that term is to remind us of the way in which
that classic approach in our generation is influenced and informed by technology. Computers — who could have imagined ten years
ago the utility of computers in a liberal arts education ten years later at Davidson? Here we are, trying to
keep up with things in that area and in other areas in which technology impinges upon our curriculum, because we
understand that kind of open orientation to the future is going to make the traditional piece of what we do
meaningful as the cycles of the years go by. That is not to say that everything fresh and new is
going to work. And it’s certainly not to say that we are going to throw out the old and start
de novo at any stage of Davidson’s life. We’ve (continued on page 5)
