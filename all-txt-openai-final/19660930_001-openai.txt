**VOL. LVI**

The Wildcat pep band has dropped “Dixie” from its song selections in response to objections from undisclosed sources and the prodding of Athletic Director Tom Scott. The band left off the popular marching song for the first time at last Saturday's Furman game in a move marked by racial overtones. The silence was suggested—but not dictated—by Scott on Sept. 22 with the informal support of two members of the Faculty Athletic Committee. In addition, the Confederate flag traditionally flown at home football games will come down, on Scott's orders.

Scott said this week that his action in both cases was prompted by the “objections of some people—some alumni, administration, and students—who expressed opinions tied in with integration.” He declined to further specify the sources of complaint, saying only that there were “half a dozen or a dozen people” involved. The Confederate flag has flown here on football Saturdays for a number of years, according to Scott, most recently atop the gym along with the American flag and flags of several other schools. Its removal, along with the omission of “Dixie,” Scott said, came because “it was thought that some of the colored students would object to it, tying it in with the Civil War.”

According to Dave Hoag, director, the band always played “Dixie” at least once a game—during the first time-out—and, if Davidson won, again at the end. “Under existing conditions we just felt it wouldn’t be wise to play it,” Scott said. “But we couldn't tell them (the band) not to since they're a volunteer organization. We just recommended it.” The recommendation had the informal endorsement of two members of the Faculty Athletic Committee, R. R. Bernard and Locke White. “We agreed that if the song was causing embarrassment, perhaps the boys might leave it off,” said Bernard, the committee’s chairman. “It's a shame, but anything with racial overtones is that way."

Hoag emphasized that his band was not explicitly ordered to quiet “Dixie.” “Dr. Scott just told me that since the school was integrated, it would not be a good idea to continue playing it. It surprised everybody in the band," Hoag said. “They could not believe it, but I told them my hands were tied.” He said the song’s popularity stems from the crowd spirit it elicits. “When we didn't play it last week at the game, at least 15 people came up to me and asked why.” He also said that last year the band usually followed “Dixie” with “Yankee Doodle Boy.”

“We hadn’t done it this year, but we'd start if it would help.” Although it was often regarded as the Confederate National Anthem during the Civil War, “Dixie” was written in 1859 by an Ohio native, Daniel Decatur Emmett, for a N.Y. minstrel show. Band member Geoff Seamans said: “If the college wants to move into the twentieth century—and I'm not sure they do—they could do something more substantial than taking away ‘Dixie.’ I don’t see much meaning in it in the first place other than as a fight song.”

**College Progressing Toward Challenge Goal**

Alumni Director Bill Bondurant admits that he is overwhelmed by the amount of money already received from alumni, new friends of Davidson, and corporations to meet the terms of the Ford Foundation. Even though the drive to amass 5.5 million dollars is only little more than one third over, the college has now received about 2.5 million dollars in gifts and pledges. Bondurant is confident that Davidson, like all other colleges taking advantage of the Ford Foundation, will be successful in its drive and will receive the 2.2 million dollars from the Foundation. This drive is the first part of a 10-year effort by President D. Grier Martin to add $25 million to the resources of the college. At present, the permanent endowment of Davidson is 13 million dollars. Most of the money given in this drive will go to the permanent endowment and will be used to guarantee increased salaries for the faculty. The money raised in this drive is in addition to the normal amount raised from alumni and other sources which goes into the living endowment. This endowment is used for the normal operating expenses of the college and probably also for the financing of the proposed new library.

Bondurant remarked that this drive is the first major additional fund-raising program in 17 years, commenting that most other small liberal arts colleges had had several drives in this same period. He praised the students for the money they had raised by finding new friends of Davidson College. He said, however, that this campaign could have produced still better results if there had been someone to better organize it. Bondurant also praised several local corporations who had given money for the first time to Davidson. The next report of the progress of this drive will be given to the Trustees at Homecoming.

**Faculty Homes Reopen**

One tradition, Sunday night visitation of faculty homes, has been preserved by the Religious Life Committee and work is going forward to find a positive alternative to the suspended tradition of vespers. The committee met last Friday and again yesterday in an attempt to outline a program of worship opportunities for the college community but reached no other decisions that it is willing to release. It did agree to continue the program of faculty open houses on Sunday evenings even in the absence of a formal religious service. During the month of October, certain faculty homes will be open for visitation from 8 to 10 p.m. beginning October 8. A schedule listing which homes will be open for the four Sundays in October will be released soon. According to former chaplain Will Terry, the committee will report to the faculty on its progress during its regular meeting Tuesday. This report will be followed on Thursday by another meeting for continued discussion, but Terry said it is not known when a formal proposal by the committee will be submitted.Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

Who is now pastor of the College Presbyterian Church has expressed his desire to get away from the idea that the proposals of the committee will be simply a substitute for the old vespers program which was suspended by the college trustees for two years last spring. He explained last week, “This is an entirely new approach and method to provide an opportunity for students and faculty to worship.”

Fraternities End Discrimination

Davidson fraternities had to comply with a Board of Trustee non-discrimination clause by Sept. 1. The background of the clause, fraternity response, and a survey of the national fraternity situation in connection with this question are examined on page six by staff writer Ed Embree.

IFC Plans Exhibits, Beauties

Homecoming exhibits on a voluntary basis were approved by a vote of 6-3 by the Interfraternity Council Tuesday night, and the deadline for submission of pictures of Homecoming Queen candidates was set for Wednesday, Oct. 19. Any student organization may submit a candidate with the selection of the queen being made by a faculty committee after meeting the candidates. Any fraternity or freshman hall may submit a Homecoming exhibit in competition for a $25 prize. Council members thought that the exhibits were a “pain in the neck,” but decided that they were traditional and should be continued. One-way traffic will be instituted on dance and concert weekends at the fraternity court beginning this weekend. The campus police will enforce this regulation.

College Image Aided

Twenty-eight Davidson juniors and seniors will begin representing the college to North and South Carolina high schools next Monday in a student-originated recruiting program designed to attract more good students to Davidson. Under sponsorship of the Student Council and the admissions office, student volunteers will go to many schools that the admissions office could not visit before. “As far as I know or the admissions office knows,” says Tom Earnhardt, Student Council Vice-President who proposed the idea in his platform last spring, “we're the only school doing this.”

“I am tremendously pleased with it,” commented H. Edmunds White, Davidson Admissions Director, “but I am even more pleased that so many of our able students are willing to do this for the college.” White pointed out that the program is an addition to the regular visits of the admissions officers and is not a replacement for the visits. This program would, he said, “tell that we are interested in the high school even though we haven't had the time or the staff to send.” The admissions office has already conducted two training sessions for the students involved, and may have a third. The students receive necessary information on admissions procedure, financial aid, and estimation of a boy’s chances for acceptance. Taking class cuts if necessary, each student uses his own time to travel to the high schools. Accompanying this project is a public relations program in which groups of three to five students will discuss higher education with students and parent groups. Groups are selected for their diversity, in order to get a group of volunteers representing a wide cross-section of college life. This second program will begin around Nov. 1, and be available to high schools in North and South Carolina. Like the student recruiting program, it uses only juniors and seniors. The public relations team is sent to a school “to talk in general about college opportunities, but not specifically about Davidson,” according to the admissions director. Part of the emphasis in the public relations program will be given to military service, industrial education, considerations in choosing a college, college social life, and honor systems. If high schools want only regular representatives of the admissions office, they have the option of saying “no” to the student program.

Ian And Sylvia To Entertain

Tomorrow’s Concert Has Been Moved Indoors. Ian And Sylvia Head First Concert Weekend

Davidson's first concert weekend of the year featuring Ian and Sylvia will begin with a hootenanny of local talent on Saturday afternoon at 3 p.m. “Entertainment, that is the name of the game,” David Jennings in charge of hootenanny plans was quoted when describing this function. Jennings said that the hootenanny will feature seven groups and a number of individual contestants who will play on a stage in front of Chambers. The top winners competing for cash prizes will perform during intermission at the concert that night. “There is a lot of talent here, and if people come, they will definitely be entertained,” Jennings concluded. After the hootenanny, a box supper will be catered on the patio of the Union. Chicken seems to be on the menu at the nominal price of $1.50 and will be served from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. At 8 p.m. the main event of the weekend begins. Ian and Sylvia, folksingers well-known to Davidson music lovers, will play in concert on the stage of Love Auditorium. Appearing here two years ago, this couple was rated “as one of the best concerts of the year.” Vince Foster, social council chairman, added to this comment: “We were really lucky to get them... they have been making albums recently.” Foster advises people to “come early to get seats in the auditorium.” Over 1,300 people are expected to hear Ian and Sylvia, and many may be sitting in the aisle or on their date’s lap. “The fraternities are not planning parties after the concert,” Foster said, and the combo party in the basement of Chambers will feature “Casper and the Ghost Riders.” Creeper, the lead singer of the mixed band, heads the Virginia group, which Foster adds, “has a very good reputation.” The party will go on from 10 p.m. until 2 a.m.

Social Council Plans Country Square Dance

Shake it up, babe, and swing your partner, round and round! Two dances, one square and one rock, will be sponsored by the College Union Social Committee next Saturday night from 8 until 12 p.m. outside on the campus, according to Ben King, social director. He added that the “Texas-style bar-be-que” which had been scheduled for that Saturday night has been cancelled. King said that “Scottie and the Flames” will entertain on the lawn in front of Chambers Building for the combo party. At the same time, the Union will be holding a square dance in the parking lot behind Martin Science Hall. King blamed a probable lack of student interest for the cancellation of the bar-be-que, adding that he thought a sufficient number of similar events have been held since school started to satisfy student appetites.
