During the past year, in the course of our ramblings around the campus, we have been trying unsuccessfully to get
some concrete dope on the construction of the new gym. From what we have been able to discover, there is
little prospect that this work will begin in the near future. This means that for the next year at least,
the majority of our home basketball games will have to be played on the Charlotte Armory floor. This cuts down
on the size of the cheering section and handicaps the ball-club itself — it is almost the same as playing
on a neutral floor. These are definite handicaps, but in spite of this, the course that the administration is following
is sound. When funds were collected for our new athletic plant, prices were at a pre-war level. Now the costs
of materials have skyrocketed and the sum collected will not be sufficient to build a gym to compare with the
one originally planned. As a result, the powers that be have decided to postpone the groundbreaking until prices drop or
until more financial aid is forthcoming. This is hard on those of us who would like to have the use
of the new plant during our college career, but from an unselfish point of view, it’s better this way. Most
of us will never benefit directly from it (except as spectators in later years), but the Davidson students of the
future will profit from this farsightedness on the part of the athletic department.

Reports from reliable sources have it that the baseball park is soon to be transferred from its present site to
Freshmen Field. From this corner, that looks like a wise move. It will admittedly take lots of work to get
the new plot in shape, but once it’s done, it will be a great improvement. For one thing, it will
enable the outfielders to snag a few of those long flies that drop into the concrete stands on Richardson Field
for ground rule doubles. It also will make it possible for the track squad to use the cinder path without
interference from the baseballers.

The crowds (?) at recent track meets, baseball games, and tennis matches haven’t been anything to brag about. It’s hard
to believe that in a group of 900 plus men, there are so few who are interested enough to attend
the athletic events on the campus, regardless of whether or not the various teams are on the winning side of
the ledger. From now on, let’s drag ourselves out of our respective sacks and take in the ball games. The
players need and deserve more support.

While booting the softball around with the worst of them for a week on the interfrat front, we have heard
lots of complaints about the umpiring. Aside from the fact that most of them are alleged to be totally blind
and unable to distinguish between a ball and a strike, the chief gripe has been that these volunteer (or drafted)
arbitrators aren’t much help when disputes arise which involve technical rules. To prevent bad feeling and needless delay on the
playing field, the umpires should be selected, instructed, and assigned by the intramural sports department, as was done during the
football season. While we are at it, the same thing goes for volleyball. Only impartial officials should be allowed to
call those net touching infractions.

LOOPING THE LOOP

Duke’s 5-4 victory over Carolina’s baseball club came as a distinct surprise to most of us. Just goes to prove
that you can’t sell the canny Blue Devil coach, Jack Coombs, short. After an erratic beginning, his charges have apparently
hit their stride. — The Wildcat’s tennis match with Georgia Tech was much closer than the 3-6 score might indicate.
The locals really threw a scare into the Southeastern Conference champs before going down to defeat. — Chan Highsmith, ace
North Carolina center, who suffered a serious back injury in last season’s game with Virginia’s Cavaliers, has decided to hang
up his moleskins for good.

day over the Duke Blue Devils, Clemson Downs ‘Cat Trackers

Clemson’s cindermen downed the ‘Cat tracksters Saturday in a meet on the Cadets’ track. It was the second loss of
the season for Pete Whittle’s charges who still showed a lack of strength in the dash events. The Red and
Black took half of the first in the 14 event card, but lacked sufficient reserve strength to pile up the
points. In the 100 yard dash, they failed to gain a point and only garnered a single marker in the
220 on Jimmy Sifford’s third slot.

Gray, Hopper Star

Jack “Gunder” Gray continued his winning ways by romping to the tape first in both the mile and two mile
runs. For his efforts, he tied with Ed Hopper as the high point maker for the ’Cats. Both had 10
as Hopper sprinted to victories in both the high and low hurdles. Since both of these boys are sophomores, Coach
Pete Whittle is looking to big things from them as well as Freshman Harry Temple who finished only a few
steps behind Clemson’s ace half-miler Carl Pulkinen, who ripped off a smooth 2:2.5.

Other blue ribbons were captured by Bob Lacy, Lennox Turnbull, and Bill Brownson. Lacy cleared the high jump bar at
five feet nine inches, Turnbull hurled the discus 127 feet 1-2 inch, and Brownson let fly with a 169 feet
11 1-2 inch heave in the javelin. With these boys as a backbone and a little more help in the
sprints, Pete could weave a winning aggregation on the cinder paths. Summary:

100 yard dash: Whitmore (C), Morgan (C), Facchin (C). Time 10.2.
220 yard dash: Morgan (C), Cureton (C), Sifford (D). Time 22.8.
440 yard dash: Allen (C), Donkle (C), Bingham (D). Time 53.4.
880 yard run: Pulkinen (C), Temple (D), McAlister (D), and Chambers (C) tied for third. Time 2:02.6.
Mile run: Gray (D), Pulkinen (C), Koop (D). Time 4:37.
2 mile run: Gray (D), Price (C), McKeithen (D). Time 11:04.5.
Low hurdles: Hopper (D), Marbury (C), Gault (C). Time 26.3.
High hurdles: Hopper (D), Port (D), Jordan (C). Time 16.6.
High jump: Lacy (D), Lynch (C), Early (C). Height 5 feet 9 inches.
Shot put: Holhouser (C), Facchin (C), Eborn (D). Distance: 41 feet.
Discus: Turnbull (D), Dunaway (C), Vann (D). Distance: 127 feet 1-2 inch.

Racketeers Whip Duke, Lose To Georgia Tech

Last week saw the Wildcat tennis team play two of the tightest matches ever witnessed on the Davidson courts. Thursday
the racketeers took their second loss in ten starts Friday when they were forced to bow before an invading Georgia
Tech team. But the Wildcats started their northern trip yesterday, boasting a record of 9 wins and 2 losses.

Victory Over Blue Devils

Putting on a magnificent exhibition, the racketeers took the Blue Devils in a 6-3 battle which saw Buck Archer lose
his first singles match of the year. Playing in the number two slot, Buck was defeated by Duke’s Eddie Davies
who usually occupies the number one berth. Covering the whole picture at a glance, the Wildcats won 4 of their
singles matches and 2 of the doubles to chalk up their third Southern Conference victory against no defeats.

Second Loss

However, Friday saw the netters lose their second match of the season, tasting defeat at the hands of the invading
Southeastern Conference champs from Georgia Tech. Although losing by the fairly wide margin of 6-3, the match was much closer
than these figures would indicate. Bo Roddey and Glen Turpin won the only singles matches for the Red and Black
that afternoon. But the losers in the singles put up fights which often pushed the sets to 14 and 15
games. Topping the roster was Ted Keesler’s second set with Adams, playing in the number three slot, which went to
20 games. Ted finally won the set 11-9. Bo and Whit Cobb won the only victory in the doubles in
straight sets.

’Cats Head North

At present, the Wildcat racketeers are invading the North and are boasting a record of 9 wins and 2 losses.
Yesterday the netters were to be found in Bethlehem, Pa. where they played Lehigh College. Today they were in New
York playing N.Y.U., and tomorrow they again return to Quaker territory to compete against Penn State. Next week they go
on to play Yale and Georgetown.

Roddey-Cobb Combine Hot

Looking over the general tennis situation, your reporter has nothing but praise for the fine job Bill Lufler has done.
Starting off the season with unorthodox pairings, Bill has very ably built up a winning tennis squad in his two
years on the Davidson campus. Strong in his singles, Bill has been worried about his doubles combinations which have usually
been the best feature of Lufler teams. But we have to hand credit to Bo Roddey and Whit Cobb who
are now boasting a record of 7 wins and no losses in the doubles. Bo, at present, has won 8
singles matches, his first and only loss being to Jack Sunderland of the Kalamazoo squad. After winning Thursday over the
Duke Blue Devils, the racketeers took their second loss in ten starts Friday when they were forced to bow before
an invading Georgia Tech team. But the Wildcats started their northern trip yesterday, boasting a record of 9 wins and
2 losses.Two of the mainstays of the rapidly improving Davidson nine, which blasted Cincinnati University last week, 9-7. Guy, (left)
an ex-third sacker, has been shifted to first and his big bat has been a major factor in the comeback
of the locals. Shepherd, (right) in addition to his work with the stick has played a fine defensive game throughout
the season.

K.A.s - Betas In Softball Lead

After the first week of play on the softball front, two teams are clinging to the lead, with a trio
of other contenders hot on their heels. The pace setters, the KA’s and the Beta’s, battled their way to the
top by winning 2 victories in as many starts. The KA’s took their pair from the Phi and the Pikas
by scores of 8-5 and 14-13 respectively. The Beta’s topped the Independents 8-2 and then took a high-scoring fracas from
the Sigmas 16-15.

Close behind the leaders were the SPE’s who defeated the Pikas 8-4; the Pi Kaps with a lone win over
the luckless Sigmas; and the SAE’s who blasted the Phi Delts 12-7. Next in line were the Phi Gams who
broke even in two outings, their triumph coming at the expense of the Independents. The Phi Delts hold undisputed possession
of the seventh slot followed by the Pi Kaps, Independents, and Kappa Sigs.

Lufler Whips French Star

In his second exhibition match of the season, Bill Lufler recently defeated Henri Crosson, a 6 foot 8 inch French
pro, in a tight battle. Losing his first set by the discouraging score of 0-6, he came back to win
the next two sets 7-5, and 6-4, and with them, the match. His first appearance was on the Davidson campus
where he met Fred Perry. Early this spring, Coach Lufler resigned his post at the Charlotte Country Club, which he
had held since 1940. More recently, he has signed for one year at the Belle Meade Country Club in Nashville.
These new duties will not interfere with his duties at the St. Petersburg club, and we hope it won't take
him away from Davidson.

Since he has been at Davidson, Bill Lufler has concentrated on building up the Wildcat squad, and in doing so,
he has brought a sweet taste of victory to the Red and Black. Going through last season undefeated, this spring
his success will in no way be dimmed by losses. The schedule he laid out for the netters was a
tough one, and before the season is out, at least two matches, four losses would not be a bad average.
Next year we will begin to hunt for more, but so far all we can say is well done.

Coach Story’s gridiron charges are working hard to polish up their attack to give William and Mary and N.C. State
a run for their money next fall. The boys are working hard on fundamentals such as blocking, tackling, running, passing,
etc. Those who may wish to see the visible results for themselves may do so tonight at 7:30 on Richardson
Field.

Although next season’s schedule has not been officially released, it will be essentially the same as last season’s schedule with
the addition of a game with William and Mary. Elon College will be substituted in the line-up in place of
Erskine College. William and Mary will be the team to beat next fall. Present predictions rate her second only to
Carolina in the Conference ahead of Duke, State, and Wake Forest; however, the Wildcats, and especially the Norfolk aggregation, are
laying for the Braves. More power to them!

Cagey as usual, Coach Story makes no predictions as to the prospects for '47. He admits that it will be
a tough schedule and that the team will have to play good ball to make any kind of a showing.
Probably the most outstanding man during spring practice has been Cliff Turner who may possibly break into the regular line-up
at tailback next fall. Cliff shows lots of improvement all the way around over last fall. By working on fundamentals,
Coach Story is trying to perfect the Wildcat gridiron machine. Some of the linemen who deserve honorable mention are: Eborn,
Strait, Bailey, Richards, Johnson, Sharpe, Stricklin, Boyd, Preyer, Alexander, and Brown. Fowle, Walker, Richert, Whitehurst, Rimer, Adams, and Austin likewise
look pretty good. Mac Erwin, head man in the fullback department, has been out of practice with an injured knee,
and it is doubtful whether he will get in the games or not.

Duke - Carolina Win In Tourney

Davidson Finishes Tenth, Bryant, Jones, and Bumbarger Qualify

Competing in what will probably be rated as one of the top amateur tournaments of the country this year, the
Wildcat linksmen returned to the Davidson campus with nothing but praise for the par-busting exhibitions put on by their Southern
neighbors. The Davidsonians were unable to place a man in the championship flight composed of the top 16 men qualifying
and which included the cream of the Southland's pellet-pushers. However, Manager Don Bryant came through to place in the second
flight, while Freeman Jones and Tommy Bumbarger placed in the third and fourth flights respectively. Missing the trip was Bill
Hodgin who last year reached the finals along with teammate Don Bryant.

In the team honors, Duke returned to the Tar Heel state with the first place rating, while Carolina finished second.
The Blue Devil players shot an aggregate score of 627, while the runners-up had a total of 630. The Wildcats
were far back in the running, finishing tenth.

Sullivan Wins Medal Play

Grabbing individual honors in the finals was Dave Sullivan from the University of Miami in Florida. In the final playoff
of the championship flight, the winner defeated Sonny Ellis, defending champion of last year from L.S.U. Those North Carolinians who
qualified for the championship flight were Jim McNair, Art Wall, and Bailey Glen of the Blue Devils, while Harvie Ward
was Carolina’s lone representative.

Future Matches

As this sheet goes to press, the Wildcat linksmen will be at Clemson in an attempt to reap revenge for
their defeat at the hands of the Tigers in the opening match of the season. Later during the week, the
team had matches with High Point College, and they take on The Citadel in Charleston tomorrow. Next week, the golfers
will be seeking their second win over N.C. State as well as competing in two matches with Wake Forest, the
second meeting with the Deacons to be played in Charlotte on Friday.

Cincinnati Downed By Wildcats, 9 - 8

Making its first home appearance in new uniforms last Wednesday, the Davidson baseball team won its first game of the
season, belting the University of Cincinnati, 9-7. The victory broke a nine-game losing streak for the locals.

Earp Winning Pitcher

The ‘Cat runs came in two big innings. Six hits coupled with several errors and a number of walks enabled
Davidson to tally four runs in the fourth and five in the fifth frame. Mapes was the big gun in
the Wildcat attack getting two hits in three trips to the plate—one of which was a double into the centerfield
stands.

Earp started on the mound and pitched beautiful ball until he was relieved by Torrence in the fifth. The latter’s
wildness kept the team in hot water throughout the remainder of the game with the visitors scoring once in the
sixth and seventh innings, and two in both the eighth and ninth.

Furman Is Victorious

Before a large Spring Frolic crowd, it was a different story with the Davidsonians losing to a visiting Furman nine,
8-6. Davidson started the scoring by pushing across two runs in the second frame, but the South Carolinians scored three
in the third and four in the fourth to take a commanding lead. The ‘Cats kept pecking away, scoring three
in the seventh and one in the ninth, but were unable to forge ahead. The victors’ last run came on
Centerfielder Schuyler’s homer into the left field hedge.

Davidson outhit their rivals 12 to 6, but erratic play afield and Whiteheart’s wildness made the difference between victory and
defeat. The invaders bunched their hits to advantage while Davidson’s were well scattered.
