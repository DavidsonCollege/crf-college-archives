The preliminary results of the “Core Drug and Alcohol Survey,” which 253 randomly-selected students filled out last spring, have been
tabulated. They are a summary of the raw data from the Core Problematic Experiences as a Result of Alcohol and
Drug Use. Davidson stacks up against other small colleges, defined as private four-year institutions with student populations of 2,500 or
less.

The survey revealed that 86 percent of Davidson students had consumed alcohol within the past year. Seventy-four percent of underage
students consumed alcohol in the 30 days prior to the survey. “Binge” is defined as consuming five or more drinks
in one sitting. The national average is 39 percent. As for the use of illegal drugs, 32 percent of the
students admitted to using marijuana in the past year and 15 percent admitted to using it regularly. Thirteen percent used
an illegal drug other than marijuana in the past year. Almost four percent of students reportedly use illegal drugs other
than marijuana.

#### Problematic Experience

| Experience | Davidson | Small Colleges | Nat'l |
|------------|----------|----------------|-------|
| Trouble with Authorities | 13% | 13.9% | 12% |
| Got into an argument or fight | 19 | 27.3 | 35 |
| Tried to commit suicide | 0.8 | 1.6 | 1.4 |
| Seriously thought about suicide | 3.6 | 5.1 | 4.9 |
| Been taken advantage of sexually | 18 | 14.1 | 11 |
| Done something later regretted | 6.9 | 5.9 | 5.8 |
| Had a memory loss | 52 | 39.1 | 36 |
| Got nauseated or vomited | 46 | 31.8 | 48 |
| Had a hangover | 62 | 52.7 | 61 |
| Driven a car while under the influence | 67 | 61 | 66 |
| Taken advantage of another sexually | 0.4 | 0.9 | 0.4 |

Except for the higher rate of binge drinking on campus, Davidson’s figures deviate rather insignificantly from national averages. The Core
survey also attempts to gauge the possible negative effects of drug and alcohol use. In the current standings, Davidson finishes
in the middle of the pack for small liberal arts colleges. But the school should take little pride in its
mediocrity. Davidson does not differ noticeably from national averages in most of the results. Regarding alcohol, the numbers are high,
but they are high for most other colleges and universities.

#### Thirty-day Prevalence of Substance Use for Davidson Students

| Substance | Davidson | Small Colleges | Nat'l Univ |
|-----------|----------|----------------|------------|
| Tobacco | 86% | 29% | 30% |
| Alcohol | 77 | 75.5 | 72 |
| Marijuana | 32 | 26 | 28 |
| Cocaine | 0.8 | 1.6 | 1 |
| Amphetamines | 1 | 2 | 2 |
| Hallucinogens | 0.8 | 2.6 | 3 |
| Steroids | 0 | 0.6 | 0.8 |
| Other Drugs | 0.4 | 0.9 | 0.4 |

Every school knows that it cannot eliminate underage alcohol use on campus, but can only do its best to manage
it and make sure it does not become excessive. The results indicate that Davidson does rather well in accomplishing that
goal. Only 19 percent of students reported driving under the influence of alcohol, 15 percent below the national average. The
numbers indicate that keeping parties on the Court and under the security of police and risk managers deters students from
driving off-campus to get alcohol, ultimately decreasing the chance that students will drink and drive.

The figures regarding the use of illegal drugs should receive further examination. They require that the following questions be answered:
Do patterns of drug use at Davidson deviate significantly from national patterns? Why is it that the smart, well-educated students
of Davidson do not have a notably lower rate of illegal drug use compared to students elsewhere? Does this campus
need stricter penalties or extra prevention programs to combat a drug problem? The stricter drug policy and greater focus on
education are the most visible steps Davidson has taken to decrease illegal drug use on campus. Only time will tell
if these changes will lessen drug use. Until then, the college community should read the accompanying charts and figure out
for themselves if the results are appropriate for what we all think Davidson is or should be.

#### Ethnic conflict threatens education in Burundi

Ethnic violence between the underclass Hutus — at 85 percent of Burundi’s population, the vast majority — and the upper-class
Tutsis erupted in October 1993 when the country’s first democratically-The elected Hutu president was assassinated in a failed coup by
the Tutsi-run military. The Hutus’ main grievance is their lack of access to power, while the Tutsis are concerned about
their survival as an ethnic group if the Hutus were to gain power. After the conflict began, many Hutus could
not finish school because of terrorist dangers. Safety is not guaranteed for Hutus because the Tutsis control the army. In
1995, a Tutsi-led ethnic cleansing program sought to rid the campus of Hutus. Grenades were thrown into Hutu rooms and
the armed militia came on campus. The Yoders helped 15 Hutus continue their education by renting a house in the
city from which they could commute. Educational access was further limited to Hutus in January when the government closed the
university to first- and second-year students and required them to serve one year in the army before they could return.
Because the army was Tutsi-controlled, Hutus did not feel safe there and could not complete the government requirement. The new
law denied Hutus university access.

One female Hutu medical student, Suzy remembered, was tall and, therefore, looked Tutsi. “Most Tutsi are taller than Hutus,” Suzy
said. “This student was really scared on campus, so she passed as a Tutsi. When the Tutsi found out she
was a Hutu, she had to flee. Security guards had to go back and get her bags. She only finished
her third year of medical school.”

“The morale of students was low,” Suzy continued, noting the high percentage of them with AIDS. “They are irresponsible with
life, drinking and having sex. It really saddened and surprised me. All wars bring morale down.” The paranoia and mistrust
in Burundi made concentrating and studying difficult. Many Hutu students kept a duffel bag packed and moved each night to
a different sleeping place. Once Hutus did not feel safe enough to take final exams. College-aged international volunteers would stay
in the room with the Hutu students while they took their exams. This was part of an experiment to determine
whether having outsiders present would modify the behavior of rebels and reduce the level of conflict.

Suzy, who has a background in counseling and is currently researching and preparing presentations on forgiveness, frequently met with groups
of women to give them a chance to tell their stories and work through their grief. The Yoders found it
especially hard because they heard both sides of the story. “Each side was so convincing,” Lauren said. “The people were
sharp, articulate, polished, but were imprisoned in their ethnicity. Their interpretations of history reflected their ethnicity.” The Yoders tried to
remain impartial by mixing with people from both ethnic groups. This kept them from being targeted as foreigners sympathetic to
the Hutu or Tutsi cause.

“The violence was amazing,” Lauren said, “especially since everyone was gracious. Even the soldiers were generally pleasant with us.” Traveling
by road was dangerous in a countryside controlled by rebel soldiers. Ambushes and vehicle burnings were common. Only about a
third of the country was safe in which to travel. The Yoders would check with the United Nations security office
or with U.S. embassy officials before traveling to find out the latest danger spots. The Yoders recall rebel soldiers who
ambushed vehicles, forced passengers to strip, and displayed them at the local marketplace.

To ensure their own safety during their road trips and to avoid attracting bandits, the Yoders drove an old beat-up
Toyota. On one trip, they encountered a military checkpoint every 10 miles. During their two years, the Yoders were involved
in numerous peace projects: development of a so-called peace soap opera for Burundi radio which showed Hutu and Tutsi families
living side by side, overhearing each other’s pain and fear across a bamboo hedge between them; reforestation projects in Zaire;
refugee assistance in Rwanda; community and church leader meetings in the “Great Lakes” region of Africa to present a united
front to the government and rebels in support of negotiations; and news transmittal from those inside Burundi to those in
exile. Through peace committees with Hutu, Tutsi, soldiers, and the general population, the Yoders felt trust was slowly being established.
But peace may prove longer in coming. A peace meeting scheduled for Aug. 25 was canceled because the government felt
the mediator was no longer impartial.

When asked whether the Yoders planned to write a book on their experiences, they said they would never want to
benefit from the suffering of the Burundians. “I would see it as an invasion of privacy,” Lauren said. Suzy described
her experience as “heartrending.” Lauren called his “challenging.” He said he hopes to return to Burundi in two or three
years. But his bigger hope is that it will be to a Burundi at peace.
