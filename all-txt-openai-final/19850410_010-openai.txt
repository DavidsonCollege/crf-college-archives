We’re Still Waitin'

The SGA Elections Council needs to get its act together. As of a foul-up in procedure last week, Defense Advisors had to be elected in the runoff election. This kind of error on the part of the Council represents serious flaws in election policies and in the way they are followed. Nothing has changed.

Last year the Council decided to prohibit Honor Council candidates from actively campaigning. The decision was made at the last minute in reaction to a problem the previous year. A student claimed he was misinformed about the policy concerning campaigning. His claim was not unfounded, as the policy was not even in writing at the time. In an attempt to eliminate confusion, the Council overreacted and prohibited all active solicitation of votes. By announcing their decision on the day signups began, the Council caught candidates completely unprepared.

This lack of organization was again obvious in last winter’s elections for campus media and Union offices. Although the SGA had an elections policy specifying the dates for signups and elections, students complained that this information was not publicized. The Elections Council decided to hold the elections as scheduled. The Senate voted to reopen the signups and elections for these offices.

In this baffling turn-around, the SGA bent over backwards to accommodate the rights of one group and bulldozed over the rights of another group. The decision reflected a total lack of concern for those people conscientious enough to find out the sign-up dates and conform to long-established policy. It also ignored the efforts of those students who had spent time and money campaigning, only to find out they had to start over again.

This lack of organization ultimately hurts the candidates and the student body. Candidates are unsure of elections policies and even if they are resourceful enough to obtain a copy of the bylaws, do not know whether they will hold or be overruled. Voters have the additional responsibility of seeking out candidates and having to recast votes.

Hope For The Future?

Newly elected SGA president Beadsie Woo has the responsibility to change this situation. Her commitment to make the bylaws “a tighter document” is the first step in eliminating the confusion in elections. Her proposed self-study, if conducted thoroughly, can bring inconsistencies in election procedure to light. If the results of the study are acted on rather than ignored, Woo could set a precedent reducing future policy misunderstandings.

Nothing has gotten any better so far in the election situation, as evidenced by continued problems. We urge the members of the reinstated SGA Charter and Bylaws Committee to take their responsibility seriously in the coming months.

**Opinions Policy**

The Davidsonian "Opinions" section is the only forum on campus for extended commentary on pertinent issues. We will print opinions articles on any subject of general interest we receive from the campus community. We adhere to these guidelines:

1. We require that all articles be in our hands by 7 p.m. Monday.
2. We accept typed articles and those written legibly, double-spaced.
3. We require that opinions be signed. We will print unsigned articles only if a compelling reason exists for withholding the author’s name, and the author is known to either the editor or executive editor.
4. We will not edit opinions for style or content but we reserve the right to edit for rules of common English. We will inform the author of substantial changes.
5. Since space for Opinions articles is limited, we reserve the right to select articles from those we receive for publication. We will attempt to print any article we withhold from publication for space reasons the next week.
