Beyond Disgusting ... M.A. Shirbalion & Dick Flaccidstein

Two Completely Anonymous Writers Discuss Beating It!

Yo. Davidphonian readers ... s’up? Now, we're sure you’re familiar with the two pedants who normally fill this void, but
they’ve graduated and moved on to high-paying careers. So, in this, the last officially unofficial publication of the 1992-93 school
year, we’ve been forced to take over. The lazy bastards couldn’t be prevailed upon to write one final column. Sheesh,
what a couple of losers (especially that Seth guy). Not to worry, in an historic moment of intertribal good will
(Jews and Gentiles, stupid), we’ve decided it's time to take a stab at that critical problem facing us all: masturbation.
What did you think we were going to say, “Bosnia-Hercegovinia”? Of course not! This is the Davidphonian, remember? And what
does that mean, boys and girls? That’s right, sexual innuendo like you wouldn’t believe. Unless the Bosnians are dry-humping cows,
we don’t want to hear about it.

Let’s begin by examining the critical issues surrounding masturbation. First of all, is it a SIN? The short answer: YES
IT IS. PEOPLE ARE ROASTING IN HELL RIGHT NOW FOR PLAYING WITH THEMSELVES. Recall this famous passage: “And Moses spake
unto the children of Israel, saying to them thusly (thus did Moses say as he spake unto the children of
Israel): Six days shall ye labor and on the seventh shall ye lay around the house reading the Sunday paper
and watching the Brinkley Group (verily Sam Donaldson sheweth himself to be a putz); but though ye shall find nothing
for your hand to do until seven o’clock when Sixty Minutes appeareth and you recall that thine homework surely has
not yet been done, neither old and strongly grounded in good sense. In its modern form, the warning is usually
accompanied by everyone’s older brother’s admonition (also scripturally based): shall ye “Verily, shall draw thine hand and beat thy meat,
for it is not kosher.” What would the chicks do if the power went out and the Union was flat
out of batteries. Ye go blind and grow hair upon the palm of your hand.” This, we regret to admit,
IS ALSO TRUE. Remember Oedipus? They say he put his eyes out with a stake. Very phallic, isn’t it? He
put his own eyes out alright, but it was chronic masturbation and not tragic realization that caused it. Although, now
that we think about it, Oedipus also had some kind of mother fetish (“Today on Geraldo...”) so maybe that wasn’t
such a good example. But it's true nonetheless, YOU CAN GO BLIND.

Speaking of chronic masturbation, perhaps you’ve heard the old saw that guys who play with themselves more than six times
a day can’t get women, THIS IS FALSE. WOMEN ARE STRONGLY ATTRACTED TO A MAN WHO IS COMFORTABLE WITH HIMSELF.
THEY ALSO LIKE TO WATCH. We know of many people on campus, men and women, who really aren’t just combing
their hair while the water runs in the bathroom. Quite common, actually. And where would you ladies be if the
power suddenly went out all over campus or the Union ran out of batteries? Mighty lonely, that’s where.

So you see, there’s really nothing WRONG with masturbation (although we’ve heard they give kids at camp something in the
water that makes it difficult to become interested, as it were). But be warned, all ye who enter these seductive
portals face ETERNAL DAMNATION for their acts (also blindness and social alienation). However, if being a sightless crispy critter in
one of the lower planes of hell doesn’t bother you, why then wack away. Wack a friend, even.Here is the
cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

---

In these troubled times, mutual masturbation (“slow massage or fast frottage”) is a quick way to avoid personal intimacy (and
the germs that go with it) while experiencing ten seconds or so of absolute bliss. And for the women in
our audience, straight or lesbian, the literature tells us that you can have between 20 and 50 orgasms in a
single hour! Go on, girl.

All I Really Needed to Know I Learned as a Hall Counselor

As a hall counselor last year, I supplemented my counseling activities with a little opinions column aimed at the freshman
class to give them a little advice here and there about how to make it at Davidson. Before I leave
my dear soon-to-be alma mater, I feel compelled to impart upon my freshmen from last year a little parting advice
from an old friend.

I warn you, a year of hall counseling can hurl a person’s views from the most idealistic stars and crescents
in the sky straight into the lion’s mouth of cynicism. You learn things about Davidson as a hall counselor that
you would never know otherwise, and as a hall counselor, I want to share some of my education with those
of you who may never have the chance to be a hall counselor. Perhaps my outlook has changed a bit,
or at least my willingness to tell the truth. You decide. Here’s the final chapter in my Little Instruction Book
of Davidson:

* People you don’t like
* Always take the elevator
* Drive if possible
* Drink heavily at Gourmet Society and Gallery Crawl
* If your directory isn’t within reach, call the union desk
* Make team
* Erase your roommate’s messages
* Ask SAE’s if they’re having a party
* Spit on the walls in Chambers
* Leave used condoms on the stairway in Duke
* Steal toilet paper
* Use girls’ bathrooms if you’re a guy, and guys’ bathrooms if you’re a girl
* Tear down FLAG flyers
* Don’t go to class
* Call your teacher a dick in class
* Vote for Jesse Helms
* Break windows to get into the girls’ dorms
* Shoot fireworks at people from your room in Belk
* Throw food in the Commons
* Don’t pay your phone bill
* Egg Kappa Sig
* Flood KA and blame the Phi Delts or other houses
* Throw Back the Night people
* Get Playboy on the microfiche, leave it on, and walk away
* Take someone’s books off their carrel and put them somewhere else
* Take books out of the library without checking them out
* Start a fight at the Pub
* Sneak your own beer into the Pub
* Pee on the seat
* Do rebel yells at inappropriate times
* Write a column for The Davidsonian

Just remember, when it comes time for you to leave Davidson, you’ll really regret it if you don’t act like
a miscreant while you can still get away with it. Every once in a while, if you look closely enough,
the Chamber Maids are laughing at you.

Has anyone else noticed how much sex is in this Davidsonian? Something is wrong with the Editors.
