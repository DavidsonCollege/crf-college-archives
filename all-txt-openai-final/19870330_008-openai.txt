**Cats’ baseball split wins and losses here and away**

By MATT NEWSOM

The Wildcat baseball team got a taste of life on the road this past week as they traveled to Greenville, SC, to play Furman and Raleigh to play NC State. Of the five games played last week, only Sunday’s 7-1 victory over Youngstown State was on Davidson's home field.

Last Friday, the Cats invaded Furman with thoughts of increasing their perfect 3-0 conference record by sweeping the Paladins. The weekend got off to a good start as senior Steve Condon, a draft choice of the Milwaukee Brewers in the Major League draft last summer, increased his stock in this year’s draft as he raised his record to 4-0 by winning the first game of the doubleheader 12-3. The Wildcats scored three runs in the first inning on back-to-back homers by Alan Lewis and Dave Turgeon and never looked back. Turgeon homered again in the fifth inning, and second baseman Peter Hughes added a two-run blast in the seventh.

In game two, Billy Waitsman scattered six hits and gave up only two runs as the Cats lost a heartbreaker 2-1. The loss was quite uncharacteristic of this year’s team which is averaging just over seven runs a game. Billy Masse led off the game with a solo home run for the Wildcats’ only score.

Davidson’s bats returned to action for Saturday’s game as the Cats pounded out eleven hits and were rewarded with eight runs. However, the offensive attack of the Wildcats was not enough to overcome Furman’s fifteen-hit, eleven-run effort. Masse went three for five and scored four runs. Dave DePaul also had three hits and added four runs batted in. Turgeon continued to hit the long ball as he hit his third home run of the weekend.

A beautiful Sunday afternoon saw the Wildcats returning to the friendly confines of their home field as they played host to the Youngstown State Penguins. (Just how many penguins are there in the state of Ohio, anyway?!?) Freshman Greg Wilcox turned in the best pitching performance of his young career by spinning a four-hitter while striking out six Penguin batters. After allowing four men to reach base in the first inning, Wilcox promptly shut the door on the visitors from Ohio by retiring the next fifteen batters in a row while evening his record at 2-2. He barely missed notching his first career shutout by allowing one irrelevant run in the top of the eighth inning. Meanwhile, Davidson batters reached Youngstown State pitchers for seven runs on eight hits. Masse was three for three with three runs scored. DePaul broke open a 2-0 game in the fifth inning by ripping his sixth home run of the season, a three-run shot over the right field fence.

The Wildcats hit the road once again on Wednesday, losing a tough game to ACC-foe NC State. Coach George Greer decided to give his top three pitchers time on the mound in preparation for this weekend’s conference series. Dave Fitzgerald started for the Cats and gave up two runs in three innings before giving way to Billy Waitsman. Waitsman pitched three innings as well while allowing no runs on just three hits. This performance dropped his earned run average to a very respectable 1.48. Steve Condon relieved Waitsman in the seventh and gave up three runs en route to a 5-3 Wolfpack victory.

Davidson was to have played Wake Forest yesterday, weather permitting, before traveling to Asheville this weekend to play.

**Davidson track performs well**

Track Coach Gary Andrew has been smiling quite a bit lately... If last week's performances at North Carolina State’s Wolfpack Invitational are any indication, that smile may soon become a fixture.

Although there were no team scores recorded for all competitors, the Wildcats performed admirably against several key rivals. The women’s performances were highlighted by freshman Kathy MacDonald and Chelley Alexander. MacDonald matched the Davidson high jump record at 4'10". Chelley Alexander clocked a 5:20.7 in the 1500 meter run. Sophomore Maureen Harris added to the strong performances of her teammates in the shot-put and discus.

Senior Greg Foreman’s 4:01 1500 meter run was undoubtedly the Davidson men’s performance of the day. Running nearly the same pace throughout the race, Foreman is a threat to break school records in the 1500, mile, and just about anything else he runs this season. His efforts will play a major role in the team’s success this year.

Senior captain Emil Cekada and junior John Lantis turned in strong performances in the 800 meter run. They, along with freshman Jay “Refrigerator” Clugston and Foreman, are threatening to break the school’s 4 x 800 meter relay record. Clugston turned in a strong performance in the 3000 meter run and appears ready for the task.

A pleasant surprise at the Wolfpack Invitational was junior David Maynard’s performance in the 1500 meter run. If his efforts last weekend are any indication, the school’s 4 x 1 mile record may also be ready to fall. Maynard could add needed depth to the Davidson attack.

Davidson runs against Lynchburg, J.C. Smith, Barber-Scotia, Livingstone, and Claflin next Saturday at 10 a.m. The following Friday and Saturday, the 28th Annual Davidson Relays will be held. There will be over thirty men’s and twenty women’s teams competing. The student body is welcome to attend both events.

The Wildcats’ golf team, coming off two wins last Thursday, looks poised to perform well in conference play. Captain Craig Carlock is optimistic about the team's prospects, “It’s early in the season and the scores are coming down.” In last week’s win, the Cats' four top scores for eighteen holes totaled 326, which was enough to beat Belmont Abbey and Lenoir-Rhyne by 22 and 29, respectively. Davidson’s two medalists, Gates Grainger and Craig Carlock, fired 77 and 81 respectively on the difficult Hickory course, with Carlock shooting a very impressive 37 on the back nine.

In another tournament last weekend at Elon College in Burlington, the team placed fifteenth of twenty-three teams, an improvement from last season when the Cats placed near the bottom of the pack in many tournaments. In addition to Grainger, who shot 75 and 79, and Carlock, freshmen Tom Goodrum and Casey Awe, sophomores Scott Prince and Sean O’Neil, and seniors Tyler Long and Steve Bradley have all made significant contributions to the team this season. Carlock and coach Tim Tallent have instituted mandatory practices for the first time this season. As a result, the team’s scores have shown improvement. Right now, the team is gearing up for its next match, which will be April 2 and 3 at Winthrop College, and the conference tournament April 21 and 22.

Last Friday, the Cat netters defeated Wooster College 8-1. On Saturday, they downed Colgate 7-2 in Atlanta. Top performers for the Cats in singles are junior Bill Young, who sports an impressive 10-2 record, the no. 2 doubles team of Trip Caldwell and Jim Thompson (7-3), and the no. 3 doubles team of Michael Meyer and Rick Hodge (8-2). The team’s overall record is above .500 at 7-5.

Soccer

Davidson’s soccer team has resumed practice after the winter layoff. According to Coach Charlie Slagle, the team is currently playing matches every two weeks, practicing three or four times in between. Slagle anticipates having to make roster changes in two to three weeks, and he probably will cut four players from the current squad.

This weekend the team will play two matches, one at Furman and the other in Atlanta against the Data Graphics team. Coach Slagle anticipates a promising journey, though not without reservation: “It should be a good weekend. I don’t know if we’ll be strong enough without (Jim) Kelly and (Michael) Spear.” Regardless of the outcome, the trip should provide some experience and develop a new camaraderie for the 1987 squad.

The Davidsonian Wildcat Athlete of the Week

This week’s Bryant-Wilks Wildcat of the Week is junior tennis player Bill Young. Young currently owns a 10-2 record in singles, playing at the no. 2 seed. According to Coach Jeff Frank, his stature is increased by his move from no. 3 seed last year. He has made the transition from the lower seed and in the process has defeated the no. 2 player from Duke. Congratulations, Bill, and continued success.

Women’s Tennis Competes

By HAP BRYANT AND WHIT WILKS

The Women’s tennis team has begun their 1987 season positively, having amassed a record of 5 wins against 3 defeats. Thus far, the Cats’ first season in Division I has progressed well. On Monday, the team defeated both Kalamazoo and Ohio University, running their record to 5-2. Unfortunately, the Southern Conference’s no. 1 team and defending champions, Furman, gave the Cats a rude awakening on Wednesday, handing them a 7-2 loss. Even though the team fell, they learned a lot in the match against Furman, according to Coach Brown. She intimated that the team has realized that they can play with Furman. Furman’s experience, she said, was a deciding factor in the match. The team now sees the task in front of them, and they must make the adjustments.

Thus far, no one player, other than the 4th seed Debbie Podolin, has excelled in singles. Currently, her record is 6 wins and 2 losses. The lineup consists of junior Amy McNelis at 1 and sophomore Marion Stone at 2. The 3rd and 4th seeds are freshman Virginia Hall and Podolin. Sophomores Alice Stubbs and Jane Price round out the rotation as the 5th and 6th seeds. In the crucial doubles, McNelis and Hall play the top slot, Stone and Stubbs the second, and Podolin and sophomore Martha Johnson play third.

According to Coach Brown, the Cats have a solid base in singles. Now they must work on their doubles play. She feels that against Furman and UTC, doubles could turn the tide. A pressing test faces the team on April 5th against the conference’s no. 2 team, UTC. She hopes to have the kinks worked out by the time of the Southern Conference tournament, April 18-20. At the tournament, she hopes to win 4 singles matches and 2 doubles matches. She hopes this will fulfill the dream of “Chasing the Championship.”
