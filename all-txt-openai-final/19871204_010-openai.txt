DARWINISM -

FRESHMEN

by Billy B. Metcalf

Forrest and Dappy
is a lawyer,

Day One: All members of the freshmen class seem to be the same. There were few differences though...

Week Two: Certain hipsters start using language patterns typical of the famous "frat boy" lingo.

"Hey lads! It was sweet, dudes! Went to face metas! I was down on the court with Alex Hayden and Bertin, the brothers, and they were pepping me so right with the SEG action, man."

"Freshmen, if you didn't take us with you, man, you're tripping the ha."

Week Four: Baseball hats begin to appear in the commons, worn by the fashion-conscious.

Week Five: Freshmen experience their first "feast" with alcohol.

"Leave it all when you get it all wrong!"

"Boy, am I disappointed. We can be restrained from parties now!"

"You're supposed to enjoy my side! Get here or we're backwards! Drink the same."

Week Ten: Freshmen learn the horror of exams and rush. Subsequently, the days of all-nighters and engagements begin.

"I'd rather have my teeth kicked in by a gang of fascist lesbian bikers on heroin!"

"Maybe if I tried a new approach..."

"Oh look! A car is on fire!"

Realizing that flared pants and punno snake were no longer in vogue and the fad was fading fast, he embarked on a self-help program...

"Try the intellectual approach..."

"Maybe it's my approach..."

"Well-read yuppy... on there are a few poems I'd like to read..."

"Get down the her-"

"WB girl?"

"No snake. Is that how you met?"
