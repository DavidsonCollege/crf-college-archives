**Spring concert electrifies**

**Love Davidson Symphony Orchestra is here to stay**

Last Monday night, the Davidson College Symphony Orchestra performed the second concert of their inaugural season, under the baton of Richard Prior. The repertoire consisted of classical pieces by W. A. Mozart and F. J. Haydn, as well as a romantic Piano Concerto by Edvard Grieg which featured the fabulous pianist and faculty member, James Swisher.

Many had eagerly awaited to hear the harmonious sound of the orchestra once again, and the audience’s high expectations were fulfilled, if not exceeded. The orchestra has dramatically escalated in ability and musicality since their first concert in the fall.

The program opened with one of Mozart’s finest works, the Overture to Die Zauberflöte (The Magic Flute). Although mostly serious in nature, the opera also features several comic moments. The ensemble conveyed the solemn atmosphere of the plot while maintaining the comical element with artistic touches such as the crisp, abrupt tempo change to Allegro.

This opening piece immediately illustrated the musical precision and accuracy of the group. The well-balanced orchestra expressed a dynamic sense of responsive interplay, creating a light and lively dialogue. The piece ended with a powerful cadential movement which anticipated the forthcoming music.

The orchestra performed their most difficult and challenging piece next, Haydn’s Symphony No. 45 in F sharp minor. The difficulty arose due to the semi-programmatic nature of the piece. Beginning with the oboes, each instrument was gradually phased out at the end of the fourth movement until only a duet violin part remained, performed by Amanda Merril and Elizabeth Parker. This portion of the concert exposed the extraordinary talent and ability of each individual section.

The crowd was astounded by the closing number of the concert.

**An American Poet**

**Philip Levine presents writing**

Davidson’s 900 Room was the first stop for poet Philip Levine after the announcement that his most recent collection of poems, The Simple Truth, won the 1995 Pulitzer Prize for poetry.

Levine told the audience Tuesday that they were lucky he had won the award, because otherwise he would be in a foul mood and not nearly as entertaining.

Levine, the Writer-in-Residence at Vanderbilt University (“writer-in-silence,” he calls it) during the 1994-95 academic year, is no stranger to recognition for his work. He received the American Book Award for Ashes (1980), the National Book Critics Circle Award for 7 Years from Somewhere (1979), and in 1991 he was awarded the National Book Award for What Work Is.

He read selections from his New Selected Poems (1991) including “My Son and I” and “Heaven,” along with the title poem and “No Buyers” from The Simple Truth, and a few unpublished poems.

Noted for his willingness to write for and about the unheard voices of America’s downtrodden, Levine’s subjects range from Detroit’s blue-collar factory workers to Spanish anarchists.

According to Christopher Buckley, the editor of a collection of essays on Levine’s poetry, his poems “engage the smug and ungenerous powers of the world and make anger and moral indignation stand up for the disenfranchised.”

Levine facilitates this connection with his subjects primarily through the use of persona poems which allow him to assume different voices and express conflicting perspectives.

He is not constrained by conventions, actuality of time and place, or point of view.

Not this pig.

Levine spoke candidly about the problems of communication between men and women, adding that poetry is the closest we can get to communicating without the use of our bodies.

Throughout the reading he jokingly patted himself on the back for his new Pulitzer, remarked on how bad the losers must feel, cajoled the audience, and mentioned repeatedly that the pitcher of water on the podium was actually straight vodka.

His humor and his unflinching honesty combined to give what he later referred to as “hope for our poems,” with emphasis on our.

Levine also announced the 1995 Vereen Bell awards for creative writing.

Rachel Newcomb ‘95 and Geordie Schimmel ‘97 tied for first, while George Weld ‘95 took second place.

Third place went to Will Boye ‘95 and Jack Livings ‘96. Shayna Chazin ‘96 received an honorable mention.

**Performing the Shrew**

**Shakespeare class gives the sixteenth-century classic a modern feel**

By Emily Simmons

I often find it hard to get into Shakespearean plays, not only because of the language, but also because of all the metaphors and other jokes directed at a sixteenth-century audience. This was not the case with the Performing Shakespeare class’s version of The Taming of the Shrew.

This version of the well-known Shakespearean comedy sheds new light on some old themes, appealing more to a twentieth-century audience. In addition, a lot of the gestures and motions let in the audience members on a lot of the jokes and metaphors.

This version of the classic has some new interpretations about the place of women and men in society. The program even has the definition of “shrew,” which highlights the fact that only now does that word refer to women (or wives) who are “given to railing or scolding or brawling.”
