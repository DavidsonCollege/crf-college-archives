### THE DAVIDSONIAN NEWS BRIEFS

#### Davidson Grad Establishes Athletic Scholarship

When Robert Norris graduated from Davidson in 1972, he was renowned for his outstanding leadership, academic, and athletic talents. From
being voted Wildcats’ Most Valuable Football Player, to receiving the King Academic Award, to serving as President of the Phi
Gamma Delta fraternity, his achievements were widely recognized. Norris and his wife, Kay, recently donated $500,000 to establish the Norris
scholarship in honor of his father, Amos Norris. The recipient of this full-cost scholarship must be a Davidson student at
the top of his class academically and must have the potential to become an all-Southern Conference football player. The first
recipient of the Norris Scholarship will be a member of the Class of 2001. After graduating from Davidson, Norris earned
his MBA and law degrees at UNC Chapel Hill. Today he is a co-founder of one of North Carolina’s largest
law firms.

#### SGA Considers Creation of Intra-Council

The creation of an SGA Intra-Council made up of all SGA and council chairs would “maintain activity within all committees
and councils and ... ensure current communication between the Senate and the committees and councils,” according to a document distributed
at last Thursday’s SGA meeting. SGA Vice President Clair Freeman, who introduced a measure proposing the formation of the council
at last week’s meeting, says the first Intra-Council meeting will probably take place immediately after Spring Break.

#### New Chancellor Approved This Month

Freshman Adam Hickey became the 96-97 SGA Chancellor this month, filling the position formerly held by Dennis Seavers. Warren Buford,
SGA President, says that the president works with the vice president to nominate a candidate for the position. The nomination
first goes to the Student Executive Council for approval and if approved by the SEC, is voted on by the
Senate.

#### New Junior Class Senator Sworn In

Ray Hill was sworn in as Junior Class Senator at the commencement of last Thursday’s SGA meeting. The shifting of
several SGA senatorial positions, including Sara Beth Hamlin’s resignation, Clair Freeman’s election to the position of Vice President, and Saad
Gul’s move to Junior Class President, resulted in a vacant post in the Junior Class Senate. Hill, as the next-in-line
vote getter in the last SGA Senate elections, was chosen to fill this position.

#### Davidson Will Have Male A Capella Group

Freshman Brad Chase wants Davidson "to have a wide variety of musical groups and programs" and will have an informational
meeting at 7:30 P.M. in the Morrison Room of the Union to initiate Davidson's first male a capella group.

#### What do you think about race relations at Davidson?

**BLACK HISTORY MONTH**

"I feel Davidson is progressing in its attitudes toward race relations, but there are instances where I notice racism subtly.
I think that it is the responsibility of all people to get to know people as people, beyond color."
- Sophomore SGA Senator Wesley Hart

"I think living in Lingle has been my best opportunity so far [to experience racial diversity] just because there are
so few minorities at Davidson. Davidson needs to create more of such situations."
- Naresh Nagella

**TREAT YOURSELF TODAY!**I just happened upon it and it's been one of my best experiences. On the whole, I think
race relations are pitiful. I know many people here who had high school situations much more diverse than Davidson. There’s
room for improvement. Junior Mary Baxter, who lives in Lingle Manor, which houses 13 women, 4 of whom are not
minorities. I don’t think they are the best they can be. Whenever they have cultural events on campus, it's the
same people who go... not the people who need to learn things.

Junior Vanessa Sims: Race relations at Davidson mirror race relations for the nation as a whole. Both groups seem to
be getting more and more polarized. But Davidson seems to throw this mirror out of focus by not drawing from
a more diverse student body in terms of socio-economic and regional diversity. Instead, too many groups form and all coexist
separately. It makes it seem like all people can’t get past their group and attack racial problems here on a
community level.

Sophomore Sean Keesee: I think things are pretty segregated and I think that people have pretty much accepted that. But
I don’t think there’s too much conflict between races.

Junior Mattison Ward: I came from a predominantly white community in the North. Coming to Davidson, I didn’t know what
to expect. I figured there would be more racial diversity on campus. I was surprised and disappointed by the segregation
apparent in the Commons.

Freshman Jen Marenberg: SELF-STUDY For many administrators, two years of research is over, but as Professor Magdalena Maiz-Peña, one member
of the Self Study committee which just released its 77-page “Report on the Student Experience,” states, “Very important work needs
to be done.” The report names some 80 recommendations to improve the student experience at Davidson. Assistant Dean of Students
Leslie Marsicano states, “It is a road map for the next couple of years... all the changes recommended in the
study need to be continued and pursued aggressively.” The report names 10 priority recommendations which will take place “rapidly” according
to Dean of Students Tom Shandley. The overall study addresses and recommends changes to many other areas of student life
from eating, athletics, religion, and physically challenged to international student concerns. The process consisted of evaluating 225 student questionnaires, talking
with every student organization and all the Court houses, interviewing individual students, faculty, and staff, and alumni, and comparing the
Davidson student experience to many other national studies. Here are some of their suggestions:

— The creation of the new Union which extensively expands the options of the current one
— Establishment of standards which mirror the National Interfraternity Conference “Basic Expectations,” and creating an annual review for all Patterson
Court Houses along those guidelines
— Transportation link to Charlotte which would operate on a regular basis
— Steps to increase students’ knowledge of the use and abuse of substances, enhancing pledge education and lengthening PE 101
— The ban of common containers, including kegs, for any social functions on campus
— Addressing gender problems on many levels, including a call for the college to “aggressively recruit, hire, and promote women
in administrative, academic, and staff positions and to work towards changing the college culture which fosters the disparagement of women”
— Efforts to diversify the student body with respect to minority populations

Students can read a copy of the study in the Dean of Students Office or the library.
