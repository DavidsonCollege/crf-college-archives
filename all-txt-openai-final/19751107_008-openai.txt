The First Annual Darryl L. Douglas Invitational Sailing Regatta was held at Lake Norman this past Saturday.

After the last race of the day, the final standings showed Duke University first, with a low score of 27;
Davidson second, with 32 points; and the University of Virginia third, with 42 points.

Old Dominion University, North Carolina State University, and Christopher Newport College finished fourth, fifth, and sixth respectively.

Davidson team captain David Frances skippered the A Division boat, with freshman Laurie Bingaman as crew. Sailing in the B
Division boat were Chuck Barrineau and Stuart Campbell.

The pattern of the afternoon was set during the first three races. In the first race, Davidson’s Frances, using the
advantage of familiar home boats, took a clear first.

Duke’s Brent Baibehenn, drawing on his extensive Jet 14 experience, took second to Davidson in the first race and won
the second race.

The University of Virginia, off to a slow start with a disqualification in the first race, took first in the
third race.

The next home regatta will be at Lake Norman on Saturday, November 15.

.WDAV uses ABC

“Some people at other stations I found out that apparently only ABC and Mutual Networks News were offering their services
at no cost to college stations,” said Golden. “I had heard both Mutual and ABC news and much preferred the
latter.

“ABC news is the largest in the country. They have been very helpful and have practically bent over backwards to
help us. They probably benefit from this deal with some sort of tax write-off.

“Howard Cosell’s twice daily sports commentary is available in the Contemporary package, but we don’t plan to use it unless
there is enough of a clamoring from sickie sports fans in the area to have him,” added Golden.

“Hopefully this is just one in a whole line of improvements we will be making at the station this year.
For example, we are looking into the possibility of going stereo. Our engineer, Jeff Watts, thinks he knows where we
could get a stereo generator for practically nothing.

“Right now, though, we are concentrating on getting ABC News on the air by the beginning of next term or
in January,” concluded Golden.
