**Grant To Establish New Professorship**

Davidson has received a $600,000 grant from the William R. Kenan Jr. Charitable Trust for the establishment of an endowed
professorship, President Samuel R. Spencer Jr. announced to the Board of Visitors this afternoon. The funds will be invested by
the college and income from them will be used solely for a professorship of "eminence and distinction," supporting a teacher
"whose enthusiasm for learning, commitment to teaching, and interest in students will make a notable contribution to (the) College community,"
according to the stipulations of the grant.

"The grant from the Kenan Trustees is especially important to Davidson at this time," Spencer said. "It represents a recognition
of academic quality and performance which helps to establish the college further as a very desirable choice for both prospective
students and faculty, and it provides resources which will enable us to add to the faculty another professor of the
highest calibre."

The Kenan name is well known in North Carolina. Kenan was born in Wilmington, and one of the largest trust
grants has gone to the University of North Carolina for professorships. Besides UNC and Davidson, 13 other colleges and universities,
all of national prominence, have been given grants for Kenan professorships.

In making the grant, the Kenan Trustees did not specify that the recipient should be in any particular academic field,
Spencer said. But they did express their hope that the Kenan Professor would have a "special interest in students."

The remaining members of President Samuel R. Spencer Jr.'s advisory study commissions have been chosen, completing the memberships of those
groups. The newly elected and appointed members are 15 faculty members, 15 appointed trustee members, and four administrative advisers on
the commissions.

The members elected by the faculty to the Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics are Dr. W. G. McGavock and Dr. Locke
White. Dr. Anthony S. Abbott was appointed by Dr. Frontis W. Johnston, dean of the faculty, who is also the
administrative officer on the commission. Charles F. Myers, John M. Belk, and Lawson Withers are the trustee members of that
group.

**Visitors To Meet Spencer, Senate**

Some 40 members of the Board of Visitors and their wives are on campus today and tomorrow to get acquainted
with the new president and learn more about the students’ new Code of Responsibility. Included in the two-day session is
a lunch meeting with members of the student Senate.

Saturday morning the visitors will discuss "Student Freedom and Student Responsibility" with Mathematics Professor William G. McGavock, Dean of Students
Richard C. Burts Jr., and three students. The main concern of the meeting will be the code, which allows students
new freedoms in governing their own conduct. The meeting will conclude with the football game on campus with Davidson and
VMI.

Board of Visitors Chairman L. Richardson Preyer won election to Congress Tuesday, triumphing over Republican William Osteen in North Carolina's
6th District. Preyer, a former federal judge, resigned his judgeship in 1964 to run for the N.C. Democratic gubernatorial nomination.
After losing, he joined the North Carolina National Bank in Greensboro.

The new congressman was among those mentioned as possibilities for the Davidson presidency last year after the resignation of President
D. Grier Martin. However, Preyer denied that he had ever received any kind of nomination for the job.

The Board of Visitors is drawn from eminent businessmen, academicians, and public officials. Among the present members are Secretary of
State Dean Rusk, former N.C. Governor Terry Sanford, and Dr. William Friday, president of the University of North Carolina.

**HANDBOOK ELECTION**

Wednesday has been set as the filing deadline for students running for editor of the Wildcat Handbook, with the election
set for the following Wednesday, Nov. 20. Filing for the office is open to juniors. One person has filed so
far, said Tom Baker, editor of the handbook. Baker said applicants should have some knowledge of publications, but said such
knowledge is not prerequisite.

**Committee To Examine College Chapel Policy**

By DANNY WHITE
Staff Writer

Citing the ideals of student maturity outlined in the Code of Responsibility, the SGA Senate Tuesday adopted a resolution calling
for a voluntary ROTC program at Davidson. The Senate also appointed a committee made up of senators Covey Carter, Steve
Salyer, Floyd Strand, and Roger Mills to study the college's chapel program.

The resolution dealing with voluntary ROTC, which will be presented to the faculty, reads as follows: "We of the Student
Senate resolve that, in relation to the ideals of student maturity and responsibility as presented in the CRAP Report, enrollment
in the ROTC program at Davidson be made voluntary for the student."

**NUMBER SEVEN**

**WALTER L. LINGLE JR.** ... names trustees

**STEVE SALYER** ... freshmen "can’t make a fair decision in the summer"

**RICH COWART** ... "if it doesn’t stay here (when voluntary), it shouldn't be here"

**CECIL BURNEY** ... freshmen "weren’t really told before they got here"

**HARRY GOLDMAN** ... "I abstain"

**SAM C. L. CHESHIRE** ... required ROTC "makes no sense under the CRAP report"

Dr. Ernest F. Patterson, Dr. George L. Abernethy, and appointee Jon Fuller are the faculty members on the Commission on
Extra-Campus Responsibilities. Dr. Richard C. Burts Jr., dean of students, is the administrative member, and Trustee members are the Hon.
Jack Etheridge, Dr. E. D. Phifer, and the Rev. J. W. Kennedy.

The faculty members on the Commission on Coeducation are Dr. Frank W. Bliss, Dr. Charles E. Ratliff, and appointee Wilmer
H. Welsh. Dr. Warner Hall, the Rev. Neill McGeachy, and Fred Smyre are trustee members.

Dr. J. H. Ostwalt, registrar and associate dean of the faculty, is the administrative officer. Dr. William G. Workman, Dr.
Cora Louise Nelson, and appointee Dr. James G. Martin are the faculty members on the Commission on Social Patterns. C.
Shaw Smith, director of the College Union, is the administrative officer on that commission. Harllee Branch, Hugh Cannon Jr., and
the Rev. John Miller are the trustee members.

Walter L. Lingle Jr., president of the Board of Trustees, appointed the trustee members. The chairmen of the trustee committees
corresponding to each commission were automatically placed on the appropriate commission. Such trustee committee chairmen are Belk, McClure, Phifer, Hall,
and Branch.

Two of the faculty members on each commission were elected by the faculty at large. The other member was appointed
by Dean Johnston. Student members of the commissions, appointed by the student Senate, were announced last week. The commissions are
expected to complete their studies and issue reports by the end of the academic year.To say that the Senate favored
the continuation of the ROTC program if it can justify itself on a voluntary basis. A committee was appointed by
the Senate to study the exact procedures involved in implementing the voluntary program. The resolution was passed only after a
rather lengthy debate that saw several senators concerned about the possible extinction of the total program if it were put
on a voluntary basis. All the senators present voted for the resolution except Harry Goldman, who abstained. Whit Ayers, Chip
Clark, and John Passmore were absent. Gary Cash cited figures from the ROTC Department which said that generally only 10
percent of the freshmen usually say they would take the course if it were voluntary, but on the other hand,
an average of 60 percent of the sophomores generally enroll in advanced ROTC. Rich Cowart recommended that the ROTC program
must orient incoming freshmen to the benefits of the program through letters, chapel programs, and hall discussions so that the
freshmen would not be making their decision out of ignorance. President Joe Murphy said he hoped the voluntary program would
induce the ROTC Department to convert to a saleable product.

2 Dorms Open Saturday Night

Five residence halls will hold open dorms tomorrow, according to Peter Hobbie, president of the RHA. The time of the
open house will vary for each dorm, depending on the time set by each dorm’s house committee, he said. Open
dorms will be conducted under two main guidelines, said Hobbie. The first states that “doors should be left open,” while
the second says that “students should be fully dressed.” Separate bathroom facilities will be provided for women guests, Hobbie said,
and someone will inform the residents when five minutes remain before the end of the open period, and also when
the open period has ended. The schedule of dorms that will be open is as follows: Belk, 1-2 p.m. and
4-6 p.m.; Duke, 6-8 p.m. and 10-11 p.m.; Little, 4-6 p.m. and 10-11 p.m.; Richardson, 4-6 p.m.; and Watts, 4-6
p.m. and 10-11 p.m. Cannon and East dormitories will not have open house.

Student Government Lacks Unification, Hobbie Claims

By DANNY WHITE
Staff Writer

Some people may be satisfied, but Peter Hobbie is very concerned about student government at Davidson. Hobbie, vice president of
the SGA and president of the Residence Hall Association, is in a strategic position to evaluate the role of student
government at Davidson.

TEXT OF RESOLUTION

“We of the student Senate resolve that, in relation to the ideals of student maturity and responsibility as presented in
the CRAP report, enrollment in the ROTC program at Davidson be made voluntary for the student. We favor the continuation
of the program at Davidson if it can justify itself in this voluntary manner. A committee will be formed to
study exact procedures involved in introducing this voluntary program.”

Senate Backs Commission Studying Five Year Plan

By JULE YOUNG
Staff Writer

Seven Davidson students concerned with the college's commitment to the present social situation are conducting a study of Davidson's policy
toward low-income and minority group students. Tuesday night the SGA Senate sanctioned the group as the research commission on the
five-year plan. The committee, presently chaired by George Robinson, is concerned that many potentially able students from ghetto backgrounds are
never able to achieve educationally because of the problems of their environment. According to Robinson and Robert Pyeatt, another committee
member, “These students are bright but somehow fail to score well because of cultural deficiencies, background, and environment.” The group
is considering the possibility of recommending a five-year program for such students. According to Robinson, such a program would enable
those who are bright but culturally and economically deprived to pursue a less concentrated five-year period of study. “We haven't
firmly formulated the details of our proposal,” Robinson commented, “but such a five-year plan would provide a lighter load for
the students, allowing increased opportunity for adjustment, development of motivation, and remedial academics.” Both Pyeatt and Robinson seem to feel
that such a program would do much more than improve equal educational opportunity. “Of particular importance,” said Pyeatt, “is the
fact that such a program would bring an increased variety of backgrounds to Davidson, promoting a more realistic cross-section of
today's society and its problems.” According to Robinson, many colleges and universities are beginning to deal with these problems by
establishing programs that give special attention to able underprivileged. He listed Harvard, California at Berkeley, Dartmouth, Cornell, CCNY, and Antioch
as centers of efforts to enroll and assist these students. In programs at these schools, overall personal strength, emotional toughness,
and creative promise were substituted for grade and test performances as requirements for admission. Pyeatt pointed out that “Cornell sees
no direct correlation between SAT scores and the academic performance of people in the culturally deprived category.” In keeping with
this philosophy, the committee rests its hopes on the possibility that, given a realistic chance, the bright poor can not
only survive but can also help create a better educational experience at Davidson.

Hobbie said, “I'm satisfied with the work of the Senate itself. I think it is stronger than the old Student
Council because people this year are generally more willing to work. However, student government is not based solely on the
Senate, and there is conflict and contention among such student organizations as the Union Board, the IFC, and the RHA.
Student movements and activities could really be effective if they all came under the control of the Senate, but in
the past, the areas of control have been divided up among various organizations. Student government must be unified. Right now,
student government is hurting. Too many people think of the Senate as a debating club when in reality it should
represent all student power and give control and direction to student movements. The Senate wonders just how far its authority
goes, but I do think the new Constitution will eventually remedy the present disunity.”

Hobbie cited the improvement and enlargement of social life on campus as the major issue facing student government in the
immediate future. “The building of social life on campus has been neglected,” he said. “I'm referring to the lower areas
of entertainment such as Union activities and individual social life, not concerts. This is the purpose of the RHA—to bring
social life to the individual on this campus.” Hobbie, a member of the presidential Commission on Social Patterns, expressed the
view that there is an immediate need for more entertainment on the campus.

PETER HOBBIE government is disjointed

“It's great to plan for a new College Union for 1974 but what about now? The Senate can help by
bringing pressure on the administration now to get changes and spend more money. The Union has neatly overlooked the freshmen
and independents by referring to fraternities. The increased social life I am talking about is not just for independents but
would benefit all students.” Hobbie said that it is up to the student government to create the sense that social
life can be found on the campus through the RHA. Relating to the RHA in particular, Hobbie said that there
is a basic conflict between the administration's idea about the RHA and his own. “The administration thinks of the RHA
as a corporate organization which is not realistic. There can be no unity in a dorm except perhaps in a
freshman dorm. The RHA Constitution is negative in outlook and was written with the objective of cutting down on dorm
damage. It’s a deal whereby the administration says they'll give us open dorms if we'll keep them up. However, the
idea of rules is contrary to the spirit of the Code of Responsibility.”
