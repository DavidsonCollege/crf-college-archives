SUMMER SESSION NEWS

One hundred and thirty-six students are now attending summer school. They are expected to return for the second session beginning
next Monday, to bring the total enrollment for the last five weeks to 236.

Summer School Dean Fred Flagg announced that all classes will meet six days a week and that registration will be
held Monday evening from 6 until 9:30 when the first class period will begin.

In order to save old students inconvenience, the Registrar's office will be open for registration Saturday afternoon for anyone who
wishes to sign up then or is entitled to do so. The schedule of courses is the same as announced
in the Summer School bulletin which is placed in the lobby of Chambers with these exceptions: Psychology and Physics 52,
Radio Communication both listed as possible alternative courses will not be given.

Also included on the calendar for the second term of work:

Tuesday—9:30-11:00 (outside)
Wednesday—10:00-11:00
Thursday—Chapel—Library 57
Sunday—2:30-4:00
Sunday—Evening Service 7:30—Vespers on the Square

Our own College Faculty is to be the Vespers speaker this Sunday evening. As the time is seven, the service
will be held outside. Everyone is urged to attend.

Thanks to Dean Flagg and his staff for their tireless efforts.
