**McLuhan’s Day**

Marshall McLuhan made famous a couple of years ago a phrase which has since come to be distorted in its popular use. The phrase, “The medium is the message,” and, loosely defined, it meant that the method of communication is a very significant part of what is communicated. McLuhan’s phrase is a useful way to approach an analysis of this week's election of the first president of the newly-constituted Student Government Association. If there was any significance to the elections other than as a test of political machines, it was that the students who turned out to vote for Joe Murphy wanted a new medium of communication.

Because no election is ever settled on the basis of issues, it cannot be said that this desire for a new way of communicating was a factor in the minds of all voters. It was the only issue at stake, however.

Student politics, as well as faculty and administration-trustee politics, at Davidson have been marked for the last several years by a quiet, behind-the-scenes, individualized approach. Dirty wash is not waved in the open. Issues are raised and agreements between college factions reached in kid-glove conversations initiated by individuals. New ideas are couched in terms that offend almost no one. The approach was comparable to carefully chipping away barnacles to get at sunken treasure. A more explosive approach has been avoided because of the fear it might blow up the treasure as well as the barnacles.

How successful has it been? Like any method, its success has depended on the abilities and energy of those using it. During the past two years, it produced a long-overdue curriculum and calendar revision, incorporating a couple of imaginative and excellent major concepts. It now appears to be on the verge of bringing about a new attitude towards the ways in which the college should guide the development of maturity in conduct.

These successes do not, however, mean that the proven approach is necessarily the only nor the best approach. In a given set of circumstances, it probably is the best. Joe Murphy’s supporters apparently felt that the old method had either not proven itself or that the situation now favors his less than subtle, give-’em-hell-and-don’t-take-any-bull-for-an-answer approach. In either case, the question was one of approach. Joe Murphy’s specific proposals differ little from those of his run-off opponent and the current student government administration. At stake was the concern about how one should go about accomplishing those goals.

Murphy’s election puts student government on a mountain ledge, from which it can scale new heights or fall into the valley of disrepute. The Murphy approach has succeeded greatly outside of the South at colleges and universities where its advocates were perceptive enough to realize that they had to have more than just an approach to offer. By the same reasoning, the Murphy approach will fail dismally if it offers nothing more than distorted McLuhanesque vibrations.

**A Blue Sky Code**

Preambles traditionally rank alongside editorials as primary depositories for empty tripe. But there are exceptions. One is the draft preamble to the report of the Committee on Rules and Punishments. Except for the fact that it is written with all of the literary beauty and grace of a Japanese radio instruction booklet, the preamble is a fitting beginning for the revision of rules and regulations governing student conduct.

A new philosophy about the role of conduct regulations is set forth in the preamble, a philosophy that employs some of the assumptions and advantages of the Blue Sky curriculum. It recognizes the absurdity of trying to develop an individual capable of making mature decisions by depriving him of the opportunity to make such decisions. Individual responsibility is seen as a part of the learning process.

One assumption inherent in the preamble is that students have already developed some degrees of maturity by the time they enter Davidson. The same assumption was made by the Board of Trustees when they approved the Blue Sky curriculum, and it is justified if even half of the praise meted out to each new freshman class can be believed. But the philosophy of the preamble does not assume that the college should therefore have no concern for the way in which a member of the college community decides to carry out his daily activities. Indeed, the whole basis for the preamble’s philosophy would seem to be that Davidson has not been taking seriously enough this concern. Rules have taken the place of thought in the college’s attitude towards the role it should play in helping the members of its community lead responsible lives.

It would be hard to make a case that graduates of Davidson College are seriously lacking in the ability to make mature decisions. However, as Dr. John Kelton, psychology professor, noted a month ago, it is likely that these alumni would have been at least as prepared to make such decisions regardless of the college they attended. The credit for this ability goes to the raw material received by the college rather than to what the college did to that material.

No reason exists, however, for the college to be satisfied with turning out graduates who have only picked some traits of maturity by chance encounter. The college should be interested in fostering this development instead of restricting it by the use of closely defined limits on the conduct of the community's members. There is no reason for a man to leave Davidson no more prepared to accept responsibility for his actions than he was when he entered the college. The responsibility given to students along this line now consists of the option to obey or not obey the college’s rules. With regard to the drinking rule at least, the most common decision is to break it. Civil disobedience is one thing; breaking a rule on the sly is another.

The CRAP report is off to a good start in its preamble. It is now a matter of waiting a couple of weeks to see whether the rest of the code of responsibility lives up to its beginning.

**A Doubting Nation**

Perhaps the most shocking thing about the entire U.S.S. Pueblo episode was not the audacity of the North Koreans in seizing the American ship and its crew. Nor was it the course of inaction taken by the United States after it had lost its first ship at sea since Civil War days. Nor was it the total lack of defense for the American vessel when it went cruising in known dangerous waters. The most shocking thing of all had to be the reaction of the American people... as typified right here in Fort Atkinson.

Up and down our Main Street the tremendous “credibility gap” that had spread out of the White House in recent years had left the people in doubt... wondering which side actually was telling the truth... wondering whether the vessel was in international seas when captured or not. They remembered the false reports that came out of Washington after the “spy plane” was shot down over Russia. They remembered the false reports issued by the White House concerning the missile situation in Cuba. And they recalled other attempts by the administration in Washington to cover up the truth. They remembered those things and wondered. They were a bit hesitant about coming to verbal defense of this nation in this newest crisis because they could not be sure that they had been fed the right facts. They were as pro-American as any citizens ever were, yet they did not want to get caught off base again with comments or opinions that might prove to be rather silly in the light of the truth.

Isn’t that the real shocking thing about the U.S.S. Pueblo? Isn’t the greatest tragedy the fact that Americans now cannot trust their leadership? It’s time to close that “credibility gap” forever... and for the White House to quit dishing out only what it wants the American public to hear.

**LETTER TO THE EDITOR**

**McMillin Finishes Attack On Lack Of Responsibility**

(Continued From Last Week)

Yes, dear reader, I am sure you are excusing yourself at this moment by saying, “Why should I take the blame? I never tampered with a fire extinguisher.” Then, I ask you, who should be to blame? You should. You have done nothing to prevent its happening in the first place. Surely you are familiar with the statement that “freedom entails responsibility.” It seems that you feel it is your right to take unlimited freedom unto yourself while delegating all the responsibility to someone else. You want the freedom to destroy the fire protection devices for your pleasure, but you want the college to be responsible for your safety. You want the freedom to take your tests when you see it for your convenience, but you want the college to leave its time open to administer them. You want the freedom to drink whenever and wherever you please for your socializing, but you want the college to be responsible for maintaining law and order. You want the freedom to choose not to fight in a war to protect your personal conscience, but you want the rest of society to be responsible for protecting your freedom.

My immature friends, you are quick to pounce on hypocrisy in others wherever you can ferret it out while you blandly allow yourselves the freedom to practice hypocrisy of the grossest sort. I sometimes feel, as I observe you, that you really think you can freewheel your way through life without being bound by even the smallest rules of organized human conduct. One fairly insignificant example seems to typify your whole attitude about yourselves. My office is located in Phi Hall, between the seminar rooms. Outside, it can be 20 degrees or rain may be dispassionate, objective, erudite look at the possibility and desirability of peace in the world today.

It was, according to Lewin, anticipated that, in the event of a world peace, there would be many unforeseen problems encountered by nations unprepared for such a state of affairs, and this group was organized to give the government some idea of what to expect. There is a lot of folderol about some secret mountain and secret meetings and the anonymity that oneHere is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

would expect from such a group. ‘Fortune’ magazine's January issue carries a pretty good refutation of this part of the book and most people say that it is not really a commission report but a satire written by some person high up in the state, Galbraith, say some; other guesses are less probable. No matter who wrote it or where it came from, it is published and being distributed. And it is very convincing. I shall quote three sentences: “It is an incorrect assumption that war, as an institution, is subordinate to the society which it serves.” “Without it (war) no government has been able to obtain acquiescence in its ‘legitimacy’ or right to rule its society.” “In general, the war system provides the basic motivation for primary social organization.” The whole book is a thorough examination of the problem and its conclusion is that, given the state of affairs that reigns today, world peace is neither possible nor desirable and before the world is ready to support peace, there will have to be some very basic changes in human endeavors. One time this boy gave me a book and said that it would change my life so be careful when you read it. Well, it was the dullest thing I had ever seen since Kant but I will take the same chance he did: it will change your life. —SAM DARBY

The Bulletin

By HEYWARD CARTER Associate Editor

The Myth of Frustrated Leadership

One of the most often repeated and most believed concepts of the Davidson student body is that it by nature is a mass of frustrated leadership. Since nearly everyone was Mr. Something in his high school days, reasoning goes, nearly everyone must still have a good bit of his former leadership ability and willingness, but most have to remain a part of the crowd because there are just not enough leadership positions. A very few boys, when they get to Davidson, quickly establish themselves as chiefs; the rest of us are Indians either because the competition is too stiff, or because after a hard four-year stint in high school we decide that we'd rather sit this one out. But after one or two years of sitting it out, most of us get pretty bored and we get the idea that just maybe there is somewhere on campus where we can use all that talent and leadership our high school annuals said we have. Some say that this ‘search for usefulness’ is the eventual realization of the upperclassman of the waste of doing nothing at college. Maybe, but I think it’s more of a simple reaction to two or three of the most boring years anyone could ever spend anywhere. But what are we late bloomers supposed to do when we finally decide that a little action—not too much—might be good for us? Well, supposedly we’re doomed to futility and frustration because all the campus offices and jobs have already been filled. Maybe that was true at one time, but at Davidson today there are almost too many committees, programs, projects, and clubs for the student body to run them all. There are certainly too many for us to know what’s going on in half of them—or for us to care. The point is, though, that they are there and if we want them we can have them, and if we don’t want them we can make our own. A good example of this is the STEP program, which was non-existent until a professor and a few upper-class students decided it was needed as a means for the college to help the town, in some ways. Or, on a different level, the Blow-Up '68 program, started this year, again by upperclassmen, to bring the fraternity more into college life as a whole. The thing that stops most people before they begin to start any sort of project is the idea that it would just be too hard to carry out, even though they may have the interest and the time. Money and experience seem to be the two main barriers to getting beyond the idea stage. Money and experience are two things, however, that we are starting to have a good deal of now at Davidson. For almost any interest or idea a student might have there is a faculty member who shares the interest and who would be willing to advise. And with the establishment of a fund through the student union to finance student projects, any worthwhile program can at least make a start without having to worry too much about money. Already in the past two or three years a number of programs have developed, not prompted by the administration, but by the students alone, and there are plans for more next year. So perhaps in a year or two, if not now, the myth of frustrated leadership at Davidson will be as dead as the student body once was.

Student Blue Sky Group Needed

Having attended the National Student Association Conference on Education reform, we feel that Davidson student government needs to do some serious thinking and acting in the area of its role in the life of the college, and in particular of the students it says it represents and serves. We have found the Davidson student government unimaginative in its actions, and in its aims: it is badly in need of creativity. We have also noted a general unwillingness of the student government to undertake to solve the problems it obviously faces. Although it has done more than in the past, a union rug and new soft-drink machines are a sorry show, especially when one thinks of the possibilities. In the same manner that the faculty embarked on the Blue Sky program, we feel that the student government should move into a thorough examination of its role and influence. With a new constitution, we need to explore the possibilities under it. Although students may lack the experience which faculty members have usually gained through age and background, it is an invaluable experience for those engaged in “liberal education” to participate in the shaping of that education. Mistakes may be tolerated when in the long run they are for the good. Therefore, we recommend that a special committee be established to examine the role and influence of student government at Davidson College, and that this committee concentrate especially on ways the student government can be of benefit to the students, both in their education and in their general welfare. Recommendations which centered around proposing a student Blue Sky committee were presented to the Student Council this morning by the council’s delegates to the National Student Association Conference on Educational Reform in Atlanta, Ga., Feb. 22-25. This is the text of the report, which was presented by freshmen Harrison Higgins and Steve Engstrom and sophomore Franklin Anderson. The scope of this committee should be without limit, and the committee should include the most creative students on campus as well as the usual political appointees which any committee receives. The committee should be allowed a budget that would allow it to consult other schools and to carry out extensive research into the feasibility and advisability of various innovations at Davidson. In particular we wish the committee to consider the following proposals, both for their intrinsic value and for their ability to lead on to further ideas: — The student government budget should be increased to about $10,000, a figure commensurate with the role the student government could play in the life of the students. This could be accomplished with a $9.00 per year increase in the activities fee. — An experimental college should be established in order to allow students to take courses not offered in the regular curriculum, to allow students to share their knowledge of special areas with others, and to keep the faculty aware of student needs and talents in the curriculum. — The student government should seek an endowment, or sources of income separate from the college, for use in its projects, with perhaps a paid employee to raise funds. It is reasonable to expect that foundations might be willing to supply funds for imaginative, creative, and experimental student programs. — The committee should check into the possibility of incorporating the SGA under non-profit corporate status. — A fund of about $1,500 should be established for the purpose of bailing students out of jail, and for defending students against unfair judicial action by the college, should the occasion ever arise to appeal a case to federal court. The major goals of this fund would be to keep a student in school getting his education—which is, after all, the purpose of the college—and to make the administration more careful to observe a student's constitutional rights to substantive and procedural due process. — A radio station should be established under the jurisdiction of the publications board. It should be commercial but still cater to student needs. — The possibility of establishing a North Carolina federation of student governments to serve the various colleges should be investigated. Such a federation would have substantial advantages in obtaining speakers and concert groups. — The student government should examine its religious commitment, asking if it is fulfilling it, and the role of the YMCA, asking how the YMCA contributes to the commitment. — If Davidson is really a Christian school, and bans discrimination by student organizations on the basis of race or creed, why should the faculty continue to remain both racially and religiously segregated? — The student planning program for high school students, and student efforts at recruiting should be revised with the specific aim of obtaining more Negro students, both to end the token integration now present and to widen the scope of the student body. — Orientation should be an introduction to a liberal arts education and NOT an indoctrination into administration policy. Steps should be taken to correct this situation before September, especially considering the already extensive student influence (if not control) in orientation. — The student government should establish its own lectureships like the Otts and Reynolds lectureships, more extensive than the Great Issues Program, and should have a significant voice in committees for the Otts and Reynolds lectureships. — The students should have equal membership on all faculty committees, but most important of all, those dealing with faculty tenure and recruiting. After all, it's our education. — Somebody should do some serious thinking on the theory of student legal rights, and compile federal decisions in this area, to fill in a vast absence of knowledge. (For instance, the court decision establishing in loco parentis was made by only a low-level state court in Florida in the 1910s.) Such information should be published in the “Wildcat Handbook,” and students should be thoroughly briefed on their federal rights.
