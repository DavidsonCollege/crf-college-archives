By FIELD HORINE

TIME: Last week, or last month.
DRAMATIS PERSONAE: They speak for themselves.

Third class on one of the Hamburg-American Line steamers, crossing from Hamburg to New York.

At the regular meeting of the Philanthropic Literary Society on Tuesday night, Feb. 1, the society heard talks on the North Carolina School for the Deaf and on the Berry School of Rome, Ga. 

Chrisman, who has been associated with the N.C.S.D. in Morganton, spoke to the society about the state institution for the deaf and dumb. He presented many interesting facts about this school, located at Morganton, and emphasized the fact that pupils when they enter the school can neither hear nor speak, but when they have completed the course offered by the school they are able to carry on a conversation as well as the average person.

A. L. Skinner then spoke to the society on the Berry School located in Rome, Ga., and the work carried on by Miss Martha Berry. Skinner gave the history of Miss Berry's life, with the beginning of the school in a small log cabin and its growth and expansion to the beautiful brick and stone buildings of today. Skinner's father has been an official in the Berry School for many years.

A short extemporaneous address by W. B. Walker on “The High School I Attended,” concluded the program.
