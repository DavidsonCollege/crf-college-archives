The close of the 1920 Class Basketball Series brings to light the fact that for the second time the class of 1922 is the undisputed title holder. The quint representing the Junior Class amply demonstrated the fact that they are the best by going through the inter-class series with six victories to their credit and no defeats. In only one game were they seriously threatened, having to push themselves to the limit in that contest with the Fresh wherein they nosed out their younger rivals by one goal only. The rivalry during the entire series was very much in evidence and large crowds were on hand at the different contests to cheer their cohorts on to victory. The games were interesting and hard-fought and all the teams displayed a brand of basketball plus fighting spirit worthy to be proud of. A summary of the season in games is as follows:

Juniors, 19; Seniors, 11.
Sophs, 29; Fresh, 12.
Fresh, 23; Seniors, 21.
Juniors, 24; Sophs, 20.

—A Merry Christmas and Happy New Year—was rather closely bunched, the latter part of the season they were rather more spread out. Each team displayed flashes of brilliant teamwork that did not show up the individuals alone, but the best shots were not to be denied and the ones given below led their teams in scoring. Though the Varsity team is practically intact this year, some of the men who have been putting up such good games during the class series will be right there with the goods, and the old letter men will have to make a hard fight to retain their old positions. The leaders in scoring are as follows:

Individual Standing Points
Doubles ('22) ------------------------ 63
Ormond, A. P. ('21) ----------------- 50
McConnell ('24) --------------------- 44
Ormond, A. C. ('22) ----------------- 43
Mauze ('23) ------------------------- 42
Crawford ('23) ---------------------- 37
King ('21) --------------------------- 30
Pitts ('24) --------------------------- 30

Team Standing Points
Junior (Class '22) ------------------- 170
Soph (Class '23) --------------------- 149
Senior (Class '21) ------------------- 120
Fresh (Class '24) -------------------- 116

Juniors, 36; Seniors, 20

The Seniors closed their class basketball career Friday night by losing a hard-fought game to the Juniors. The victory was the twelfth straight win for the '22 quintet and rounded out the second season that they have won the championship with a perfect average. The Juniors showed their superiority early in the game by rolling in five baskets before the Seniors had a good shot at the goal. The Seniors then seemed to take on new life and during the remainder of the half they collected five baskets while the Juniors had to be satisfied with two. This half was cleanly played, only one foul being called. The half ended 14-10 in the Juniors’ favor.

The Juniors opened the second half with a rush. By the almost perfect shooting of A. C. Ormond and Doubles, and the guarding of Ervin, the Seniors were completely swamped. Miley showed up best for the Seniors in this half. Besides his usual good floor game, he led his team in scoring, making shots from near the middle of the floor. The Juniors were without the services of their high-stepping guard, Price, but his place was ably filled by McCrary. This lad in his first game of class basketball played a splendid guarding game and added eight points to his team’s total. The centers, Heizer and Cornelson, each got three baskets in the first half. But they must have called it a draw, for neither was able to score in the second half. The line-up was:

Seniors. Position. Juniors.
Ormond, A. P. (6) -- Ormond, A. C. (12)
King (2) ---------------- Doubles (10) Forwards
Heizer (6) -------------- Cornelson (6) Center
Miley (6) --------------- McCrary (8)
Johnson ---------------- Erwin Guards

Referee: Schenck; timekeeper: Miley; scorer: Richards, W. J.
