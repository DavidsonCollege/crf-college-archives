THE DAVIDSONIAN

By MIKE WELLMAN
Arts & Living Editor

For those who haven’t been hit in the head by a brick in the last five years, computers can now
connect to the internet without any wires. Now you can too, as the entire campus (excluding a few buildings off
Main Street) is connected to the campus wireless server.

So you sit in the middle of the baseball field eating Cheetos and hammering on your laptop like John Henry,
we thought you could use some help figuring out how to spend your extra internet time. Without further ado, The
Davidsonian’s websites to watch:

www.pandora.com

PANDORA

So you like music, but you’re stuck listening to that same copy of Bruce Springsteen’s “The Rising”? Check out Pandora,
a cool interactive internet radio site that allows you to select your favorite artists and get recommendations of other songs
that fans of your music also enjoyed.

The website is free, and if you don’t like a song, you can give it a thumbs down to skip
to the next. So go ahead, find out what you can get if you mix Kenny G, Kiss, and Kanye
West. I dare you.

www.threadless.com

A million websites try to sell you the newest and trendiest t-shirts. Threadless is a bit different, because it allows
anyone to submit a design to be voted on by members and printed only if it is deemed worthy. From
slogans that will make you laugh out loud (“Stupid Raisins, Stay Out Of My Cookies”) to amusing cartoons like a
baby Cerberus to stuff that just plain looks cool, Threadless is fun to watch, perhaps even useful.

www.woot.com

Against all common sense, the people behind Woot choose to give consumers as little choice as possible. As a matter
of fact, starting at 1 a.m. and ending at the same time the next day, one item a day goes
on sale on Woot at lower-than-average prices. If you miss it, you miss the deal, but chances are that after
you see something you like, you’ll tune in like it’s the evening news. Named after the noise you exclaim when
you see the offer, some examples of recent deals include Microsoft Zunes, big-screen TVs, portable GPS devices, and digital cameras.

www.d-purr.com

(Coming September 10th)

Although it’s not out yet, chances are good that you’ll be hearing a lot about D-Purr pretty soon. Described as
a student-run internet magazine that allows any student to write an article on any topic that they’re passionate about, stories
promise to range from lingerie shopping to evaluations of Locke’s Second Treatise of Reason.

Hoping to achieve the admirable accomplishment of one new article per school day, D-Purr allows anyone to have their voice
heard on campus. Before you know it, Davidson’s presence on D-Purr may be roaring by the end of the semester.
