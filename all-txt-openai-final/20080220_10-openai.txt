The women’s basketball team defended its home floor effectively against UNCG on Friday and Elon on Sunday, beating both teams
by scores of 76-50 and 68-54, respectively. These two wins improve the Wildcats' record to 16-9 overall and 10-4 during
SoCon play.

Against UNCG, Mercedes Robinson ’08 began a stellar week with her 10th double-double. She scored 20 points and secured 11
boards during the contest. Kelly Gassie ’09 and Danielle Hemerka ’08 joined Robinson in double figures; Gassie sank a season-high
14 points while Hemerka drained 12 points to complement six rebounds. After jostling for position, the Wildcats broke away from
the Spartans with a 10-0 run to establish a 27-17 lead which they would protect successfully for the remainder of
the game. UNCG chipped away at the lead behind its leading scorer Kemena Brooks, but after trimming the lead to
27-23, Gassie and Alex Thompson ’10 stretched the lead back out to 31-23. The Wildcat defense played particularly well against
UNCG, holding the Spartans to 6-22 shooting from the field in the first half and allowing only nine points in
the final 9:42 of the second half. Due to this lockdown defense, Davidson stretched the lead and earned the 76-50
victory.

Davidson’s win over Elon on Monday marked the team’s ninth straight win against Elon and its fifth straight win at
home this season.

The Davidson Wildcats women’s tennis team saw its four-match winning streak come to a brutal end Saturday against No. 63
Virginia Tech when the Hokies blanked the Wildcats 7-0. Recovering from this overwhelming loss, the Wildcats secured their fifth shutout
of the season by blanking Radford on Sunday afternoon. The Wildcats did not surrender a single point during their recent
winning streak, but were unable to establish much resistance to the Hokie attack. Virginia Berry ’10 (6-7, 6-4, 7-6 (6))
and Lora Dushanova ’09 (6-1, 0-6, 7-6 (5)) managed to take their singles matches to three sets, but both fell
in third set tiebreakers. Also competing in singles for the Wildcats were Kelsey Linville ’08 (6-3, 6-2), Kim Whelan ’08
(6-0, 6-2), Michelle Fanney ’09 (6-4, 6-2) and Alison Rauh ’11 (6-3, 6-2). Rauh and Whelan teamed to lose 8-6
in the third doubles match, surrendering the point to the Hokies. Berry and Linville (8-3) and Fanney and Teresa Wang
’10 (8-1) also competed in doubles for Davidson but could not turn the tide.

The tables turned on Sunday when Davidson blanked Radford 7-0. Contributions came from every member of the squad. First, the
doubles duos of Linville and Berry secured an 8-5 victory in No. 1 doubles. Samantha Galainena ’11 paired with experienced
Meredith Skeeters ’08 to win her first collegiate doubles match 8-6 at the No. 3 spot. Wang and Fanney also
defeated their doubles opponents 8-3. The singles matches proved just as successful. The only match that went to three sets
for the Wildcats was Skeeters versus Ashton.e 3000 meter for third place 0:04.75 in the 3000 meter for sixth place.
Mercedes Robinson '09 earned SoCon Player of the Week recognition after two solid performances.

Som-Pimpong leaps, Robinson, 'Cats win two in SoCon

Robinson continued her hot play with another double-double; this time she scored 17 points, grabbed 11 rebounds, and distributed six
assists. Thompson scored 18 points and dished six assists in the contest, and Julia Paquette '10 added 13 points to
the effort. The Wildcats stumbled out of the gates, trailing 8-5 early against the Phoenix. Yet Davidson kept its composure,
responding with nine straight points to open a 14-8 margin. The Phoenix again made a push, tying the score at
21, but the 'Cats shut down Elon for the rest of the half, outscoring them 12-3 to extend their lead
to 33-24. Davidson consolidated its lead in the second half, using an 8-0 run to stop the team from this
point onward. The Wildcats successfully fended off a few minor rallies as they rolled to a 68-54 win.

Robinson’s collective performance earned her SoCon Player of the Week honors for the first time this season. She averaged a
double-double for the week with 18.5 points per game and exactly 11 rebounds per night. Robinson shot 56 percent (14-of-25)
from the field for the week. She was one of five Wildcats to shoot over 50 percent during the week,
and she hit seven of her nine free throws over the two conference games.
