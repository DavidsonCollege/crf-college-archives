**Davidson falls to Wofford, Guilford**
**Losses drop Wildcats to 0-6**

— By BRUCE NEWSOME

In the past two weeks, the Cats lost to Wofford 32-15 and Guilford 21-14. Both losses were disappointments since at the beginning of the year coach Vic Gatto felt that his team could match up evenly with both teams. Also, the Cats beat Wofford in Spartanburg at the Terrier homecoming last year 10-0, and the Guilford Quakers came into the game with just one victory this season.

In the Wofford game, the Cats’ offense came out of its comatose state that it had been in for the previous two games. It erupted for 334 yards total offense. However, once again turnovers plagued the Cats. On the opening drive, Peter Hughes was stripped of the ball at the Wofford 14. On Davidson’s second possession, Terry Hines fumbled at the Cats’ 10-yard line and two plays later the Terriers scored. Finally, midway through the fourth quarter with Davidson down by 11 points, Hughes’ pass was picked off and the Terriers scored 5 plays later to finish out the scoring 32-15.

After playing well in the two previous games against Fordham and Dartmouth, the Davidson defense was unable to stop the Wofford wishbone attack. The Terrier quarterback killed the Wildcats. He ran for 85 yards and two touchdowns. Most of these yards came off the option play where he would either outrun the Davidson outside linebackers and defensive backs to the corner or cut back against the grain and run like a fullback through the secondary.

The specialty teams also continued their woes as kicker Brian Jacob missed two field goals in the first half that could have given Davidson the lead. Coach Gatto was not pleased with his team’s performance. He was quoted in the Charlotte Observer as saying, “I was disgusted with the way we played.”

In the Guilford game, Davidson got behind early and the Cats' second-half comeback fell short. Guilford scored a touchdown in the first quarter and two in the second quarter to take a 21-0 lead at the half. Davidson had one possible scoring drive stopped by a fumble at the Quaker 32-yard line. This fumble is a continuation of a discouraging trend that the Cats have exhibited all season of turning the ball over when they are in scoring range. Davidson came out of the locker room at the start of the second half ready to play. Mike —

### Cross Country Team Copes Well with Inexperience

By LEE CANIPE

“Our team is very young. The freshmen have sort of been thrown into the fire,” says senior Bob Cornish, captain of the men’s cross country team. If Davidson’s program has a single nemesis it could very well be this inexperience. Of the nine runners on coach Gary Andrew’s men’s team, six are freshmen while none of the five Wildcat women have had any previous collegiate cross country experience.

But, despite their lack of seasoning, the Davidson runners have been able to hold their own this year, earning respectable finishes while putting valuable experience under their belts. At the North Carolina collegiate state meet on October 13, the men placed sixth out of eight teams and the women were eighth out of the nine squads that competed.

“It was the hardest meet we’ve run this season, but the freshmen weren’t overwhelmed by running against Carolina, Duke, and teams like that. We held our own,” says Cornish. While the two second-division finishes were in themselves disappointing, Andrew points out that the field last Thursday at —

### Soccer Wildcats Return to Winning Ways

By WHIT WILKSAfter a few difficult weeks which saw the team decimated by injuries, Davidson’s soccer team has played very well of late. Davidson has won four of its last five games, improving to 7-8-2, heading into an important road trip to Liberty and James Madison this weekend. Peter Cobb scored twice as the Cats defeated Georgia State 4-2 on Oct. 8. Davidson traveled to Erskine last Monday night and came away with a 3-0 win behind outstanding play from Rob Ukrop. Last Thursday, the team took on perennial power N.C. State in Raleigh and gave the Pack a tough game before falling 6-3. On Saturday, Davidson defeated UNC-Wilmington 1-0 on a goal from Ukrop. Scott Zucker recorded the shutout. Sunday, the Cats faced Georgia Southern and earned a hard-fought 3-2 victory. Rob Vest, Lance Long, and Ukrop were the goal scorers for Davidson. This was Ukrop’s 7th goal in the last four games. Davidson has done an impressive job in dealing with an unusual amount of injuries this season. Players such as Tracy Hankins and Bruce Nofsinger were expected to play major roles but have not been able to do so. Coach Charlie Slagle has had to go with younger, inexperienced players who naturally have made some mistakes. Freshmen Ukrop and Long have been exceptional in the field while goalie Doug Long has turned in several strong performances when he has played. Freshman Rob Ukrop is the second leading scorer on the soccer team. UNC-Wilmington was “one of NCAA championship caliber.” Joining the Wildcats at UNC-W were UNC-Chapel Hill, N.C. State, Duke, Campbell, East Carolina, St. Augustine, Methodist, and Brevard. A bright spot for Andrew was the fact that out of the 14 Davidson men and women that started the relatively flat course at Wilmington, 12 of them came back with personal best times. “I was very pleased with the overall effort that we gave. Some people improved their times by a minute or even more.”

Leading the men’s team was freshman Chris Otrok, who finished the 8K course in 27:10. Otrok has been at the head of the pack for Andrew in all five races so far this year but has been closely followed by Ted Richardson, Joe Parvis, Will Farr, Cornish, and Jay Clugston. “One of our strengths lately has been pack running,” says Andrew. Last Thursday, the Davidson top five grouping was just a little over a minute apart. Sophomore Katie Reynolds paced the women’s team at UNC-W, crossing the 5K finish line in 21:11. Reynolds has stepped in to fill the void left by freshman Kathy Beach. Beach, who began the season in the top position for Davidson, has been sidelined for the last three meets with a stress fracture in her foot. Andrew hopes to have her back before the next meet at home on October 29. Andrew notes the “potential for future top performances” out of both teams, glimpses of which he might have seen at the West Georgia Invitational on October 1. Against a field of teams from comparably sized schools, the Davidson men took second place out of 12 and the women were fourth in a race featuring eight teams. Cornish singles out that meet as a turning point of the season. “At the West Georgia meet, the team got together as a team and started running like a team,” he says. Both teams have been steadily making improvements as they gear up for the home stretch. “We have been progressing the way we would like and hope to finish strong at Furman,” says Andrew, looking towards the NCAA Southeastern Regional meet at Furman University.
