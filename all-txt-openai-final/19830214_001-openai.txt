**Humanities Under Fire**

**Faculty asks Dean to rescind letter**

**BY DAVID RESNIK ’85 AND MIKE TANTILLO ’85**

The faculty endorsed a Humanities program request that Vice President of Academic Affairs and Dean of the Faculty T.C. Price
Zimmermann rescind his letter of 3 February 1983 by a vote of 79-8 in a called faculty meeting.

Zimmermann sent the letter to members of the Humanities staff. It announced the appointment of Professor of Philosophy and Acting
Chairman Earl MacCormac as the single director of the Humanities program and called for “a major revision of the Humanities
program.”

“A major revision of the academic program should have been jointly agreed upon by the two [Humanities] staffs and the
administration,” said Director of the Second Year Humanities Staff and Professor of English Anthony Abbott.

The twelve members of the Humanities staff who submitted the request found “the manner of the decisions and their method
of presentation both a violation of the faculty’s constitutional prerogatives and a discourtesy to those individuals involved in the Humanities
program.”

They believe Zimmermann ignored Article III, Sections 1 A and F and Section 3 of the Davidson College Constitution in
his letter. According to the constitution, “The President and Vice President for Academic Affairs share with the faculty responsibility for
proposing Educational Program and Policy,” which includes “curricula, curriculum requirements, and academic standards... establishing regulations and changing of academic departments.”

“The letter of the law is not clear, but the spirit of the law is,” reminded History Professor Earl Edmondson.

Zimmermann has not yet decided whether he will rescind his letter.

President Pro-tempor of the Faculty and Religion Professor Dr. David Kaylor thinks that Zimmermann “will see the wisdom” of the
faculty’s request because it is “a reasonable request” and Zimmermann is “a reasonable man.”

He offered no comment as to what the Faculty will do if Zimmermann regrets their request, adding that “nothing like
this” has happened in recent years.

Zimmermann based his revision proposal on an evaluation of the Humanities program conducted by the consulting team of Harold Martin,
Marvin Levich, and Jed Rabb (see related article).

First Year Director of Humanities and Religion Professor Max Polley expected that Zimmermann “would work with” the first- and second-year
Humanities teams. He said that the Dean did not consult either team and that the consulting team “never met with
the Humanities staff as a whole.”

The Humanities staff had already held a meeting to discuss revisions on 31 January 1983. Zimmermann’s letter took them by
surprise. “We didn’t know that they [the administration] had any inclination for a new director or a revision,” said Polley.
Kaylor thinks Zimmermann should have used the letter “only as a last resort.”

**Students to Self-Select**

**By JEFF HOLLAND ’84**

Freshmen received forms last Thursday for this year’s self-selection. The forms were due Sunday and will be run through the
computer Monday night. The results should be posted Tuesday outside Dean of Students Will Terry’s office.

Freshmen selected an eating house by one of two methods: listing three different houses, in which case they will be
put in the first house with an available space; or “shotgunning” — naming only one house. If they “shotgunned” and
no space is available in the house, they will be put on that house’s waiting list.

If no space is available in any of their three choices, the students will be put on a general waiting
list. After a one-day waiting period, they can have the Dean’s office move them from the general list to the
waiting list of their choice.

The assignments will be made using the computer this year, and this is expected to speed and simplify the process.

An eight-member Supervisory Committee on self-selection, a sub-committee of the Patterson Court Council (PCC), headed by Freshman Advisors Crittenberger and
Mike Mason, will hear complaints on the part of both students and houses if there is any problem. Crittenberger advises
that anyone with a problem concerning self-selection contact a member of the committee.

Other members of the committee are: Lisa Herard (Emanon), Cambria Melton (EFC), Lee McCormick (PAX), Rob Spaugh (SAE), and Ed
Whitesides (PiKA).

Responding to suggestions that the freshmen are confused about the self-selection process, Crittenberger said that freshmen were given a number
of chances to find out about the system. “They should know they have to meet people if they’re going to
get in a house,” she said. “I don’t think it is our job [the Freshman Advisors] to tell them, ‘Well,
by this point you should know this many people,’ and so on.”

Dean of Students Will Terry agrees that problems exist in communicating the self-selection system to students. He said they have
held big meetings in Love Auditorium for all freshmen, but many did not come. Terry said this was a little
early in the year for students to comprehend fully the system. This year, he said, they tried to work through
the freshman halls and hall counselors, but problems still seem to remain. He said, “If someone could come up with
a good way of communicating these things to freshmen, it would be great. A large part of the problem, I
think, is with misinformation.”

Confusion may be due in part to a decreased emphasis this year on specific rules a house sets for accepting
students. Both Terry and Crittenberger felt these rules (such as meeting 10 percent of the house or knowing a certain
number of officers) were too hard to enforce. Terry said that enforcing such a rule was difficult because houses found
themselves trying to draw specific lines. “Everyone loses that way,” he said. “It backfired on everyone.”
