**Batters drop opening four, Coach blames poor pitching**

The Davidson College Baseball team has opened its season with a disappointing 0-4 record.

Three losses were to Connecticut University on Friday and Saturday and one loss was to Catawba yesterday.

In the opening game of the season against Connecticut at Davidson last Friday, the Wildcats started ace pitcher Joel Tew
and appeared to be in control of the game after five innings of play when the score stood 4-1.

The roof collapsed in the next two innings however, as the Cats’ pitching staff was burned for twelve runs, putting
the game out of reach. The final verdict was a miserable 4-19 defeat.

Davidson dropped a closely contested 1-2 decision to Connecticut in the first half of Saturday’s doubleheader. Tim Barr started on
the mound and went the entire game giving up only one earned run. However, there was no hitting to support
Barr’s pitching effort as Wildcat batters scattered hits and could only score a single run.

In the second game, the Wildcats probably played the poorest they have thus far this season.

Mike Hall opened at pitcher and did not have a good day, but the Davidson defense was responsible for much
of the damage, as numerous fielding errors led to several unnecessary runs.

Hitting was also weak as the Cats were unable to score any runs. The final score was 0-15.

After having Tuesday’s home game with Heidelberg College cancelled because of rain, the Wildcats traveled to Catawba on Wednesday and
lost 2-7.

Joel Tew was the starting pitcher again, but he was unable to control his game and left after three innings.
Tim Barr replaced him but also had difficulty with the Catawba batters.

Ed Willingham showed the only hitting power as he smashed a hard double that brought in a run.

According to Coach Palmer Meunch, the Wildcats have lost their first four games primarily because “the pitching is not coming
along as well as expected. Also, nobody is hitting particularly well now.”

Davidson will have the chance to get untracked against Pfeiffer again today, and with a home doubleheader against Marietta College
on Saturday.

**Wrestlers crush way to 5-5**

The Davidson wrestling team’s 47-6 victory over the College of Charleston gave the team a 5-5 dual meet record, and
it sent the wrestlers into the Southern Conference Tournament on a winning note.

Only four wrestlers entered the competition, but three of the four placed in their respective weight classes.

Mark Scandling, Ralph Holloway, and Jack Summe all placed fourth.

Mark Scandling lost in the semi-finals of the 150-pound weight class, but bounced back to win a consolation match before
losing a 1-0 overtime decision to an old rival from the Citadel.

Ralph Holloway lost to the number one seed at 167 in the opening round. Holloway won two more matches, and
then lost a 6-2 decision to his opponent from William and Mary.

Jack Summe lost in the semi-finals and then reached the consolation finals, where he lost 8-0 to the heavyweight from
Richmond.

The three fourth-place finishes in the tourney, and the 5-5 dual meet record are the best showings for a Davidson
wrestling team in three years, and it leaves some optimism for next year. The team will lose only one senior,
and hopes to acquire several freshmen to fill in the weak spots.
