THE DAVIDSONIAN

Don’t call the Ghostbusters

By MARK CHEN

Ghostbusters ranks among the most popular movies of all time. It was the biggest grossing movie of the 1984 summer season. The song “Ghostbusters” became a top ten hit on the pop charts. Ghostbusters T-shirts were everywhere and the Republicans, in order to cash in on the popularity of the movie, put out a “Fritzbusters” T-shirt. Bill Murray’s asking price per movie skyrocketed beyond the range of Earthbound astronomers.

Two of my friends thought the movie was hilarious. Whenever I mentioned this week that Ghostbusters was going to be shown at Davidson, people immediately said that they would have to see it. By all the standards of democracy and consensus, Ghostbusters is one of the best comedies of all time. Which means that this reviewer is in a very small minority.

I saw Ghostbusters the summer when it was released. Everyone told me how hilarious the movie was and to look out for the performance of Bill Murray. Murray, they told me, was the best part of a very funny movie. Following their advice, I put down my four dollars for a ticket, sat down in the dark and waited to ache with laughter. I waited, waited, and waited. I was still wondering what the fuss was all about after the movie ended.

To me Ghostbusters simply rambled from skit to skit, grabbing comedy ideas like a desperate improvisational act, and then wasting what good ideas it had. This opinion did not change after I reviewed the movie once again this week. A second viewing only showed even more wasted opportunities for a really good comedy.

Murray is at the heart of the movie's problem. Almost all of the movie is subordinated to letting Murray get all the best lines, the best skits, and the best girls. What happens is that Ghostbusters becomes a one-man show, with all the rest of the cast doing nothing more than playing straight men and women to Bill the Clown. Putting Murray in the center of the movie wouldn't be such a bad idea if he were very funny. The problem is that he isn’t. Murray always plays one type of character — the obnoxious brat who thumbs his nose at authority. This style worked very well in Stripes, when he was ragging the army, and in Meatballs, when he was twisting all the boring

Elvis Costello returns

By LEE EICHELBERGER

It is refreshing to know that in these days where high-tech has dehumanized the music industry, the roots of blues and country have not been forgotten by today’s performers. On his latest album Elvis Costello has cast aside the intricate and stifling production values that plagued his last two albums in favor of a cleaner, leaner sound. King of America, his latest effort, unnerves hardcore Costello fans, but fills a void left after the release of Imperial Bedroom and places Costello back in music’s center ring.

In an effort to cast aside the pop star image that didn’t suit him, Costello changed his name back to Declan McManus and for the new album he has all but shed the Attractions. Instead, he has chosen elder Jazzmen Ray Brown and Earl Palmer and surviving members of Elvis Presley's TCB band to support him. However, he has been primarily influenced by TexasRules of summer camps. In Ghostbusters, Murray has got the show completely to himself. There is no authority to battle, except for the idiot EPA inspector (perhaps that’s why the Republicans used this movie). This bastion of authority comes in about halfway through the picture and is soon put in its place by Bill the Magnificent. So what you get is a movie in which Bill is the life of the party. The plot shambles along, picking up ideas like burrs, throughout the picture. When things get dull, the makers of Ghostbusters throw in something else and hope. This desperate effort to find something funny results in a stew where leftovers get thrown in. The plot alternates between Murray chasing the girl, the Busters going after a ghost, Murray trapping Weaver into a date, the Busters getting another ghost, and then winding up with a general apocalypse. This is supposed to be funny. The result is often this scene (but be careful not to laugh too hard):

Ramis: Don’t cross the currents.
Murray: What happens if we cross the currents?
Ramis: I’m not sure, but life as we know it throughout the universe might end.
Murray: O.K. Be careful.
Chen: Yeah, wow, zowie, yeehaw, yip, yip, yip.

This joke gets repeated a couple of times, so the audience can get it. These comments will probably not change anybody's mind. The people who liked Ghostbusters the first time will want to see it again. The people who have never seen it can ignore this carping and go with the majority. Ghostbusters will be shown on Friday night in Love Auditorium at 7:30 and 9:45 P.M. Before the movie will come a Three Stooges’ short film, Spook Louder. Curley is in this one, so Spook Louder is a kind of Stooges classic.
