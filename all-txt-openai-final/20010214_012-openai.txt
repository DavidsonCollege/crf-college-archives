Although the team is young—eight new players grace the roster—Coach Frank is confident that the new players will adjust well to the program.

Men’s TENNIS Spring 2001 SCHEDULE

This season’s men’s tennis team, which returns seniors Whit Hansen, Billy Boykin, and Chad Phillips, stands poised to maintain its energy and competitive edge that carried it down the home stretch last season. The Wildcats began their spring season with two of their most formidable foes—UNC Chapel Hill and the University of South Carolina.

“It was not bad for only two weeks of practice,” head coach Jeff Frank said. “The Tarheels had practiced ten more days and had three matches under their belts going into that match. We put in as much time as we were legally allowed but you can’t get prepared to play a team that good in two weeks.”

But the losses to the Tarheels and the Gamecocks taught the team some valuable lessons.

“It let us know where we are and what we can work on,” said Frank. While Chapel Hill appeared to dominate the Wildcats, winning a 7-0 victory that included a loss for Hansen in a tough three-set match, Chad Winebarger and Geoffrey Mullen kept their matches competitive with second set tiebreakers. Coach Frank also complimented the number one and two doubles teams on their performance.

The women’s team began their spring season Feb. 6 with a 6-0 win over UNC Asheville.

“We’re hoping to improve on last year’s record with more experienced play and the addition of two new freshmen that will certainly impact the lineup in order to end in the top echelon of the conference,” head coach Caroline Price said. “I’m looking forward to a promising season of good competition. Last year our team was dominated by sophomores and freshmen with talent but a lack of experience and leadership. This season, however, the young team is back with the experience they need to be competitive in the conference,” said Price.

“We'll try to win the conference championship and better last season’s record,” said captain Kelley Cantrell. “Close match ups will come from Appalachian State, UNC Greensboro, and College of Charleston.”

Southern Conference Tournament is slated for April 19-22 in Charleston, S.C.

*Southern Conference game

The Wildcats hit the mat again this February 17 against Gardner-Webb in Boiling Springs, N.C. Starting time is slated for 7:00 p.m.

—Sports Information Department*Boldface home game* — their outstanding play. But with four returning starters this year, the Wildcats look to improve their play with added maturity and confidence. Coach Price commented enthusiastically on the three outstanding tournaments the Wildcats played during the fall, highlighting doubles combination Elizabeth Moreno and Yasa Hilu.

Following the loss to Chapel Hill, the Wildcats rebounded with two consecutive 6-1 wins over Queens College and Belmont-Abbey. After losing the first set, Hansen secured a victory over Belmont Abbey’s Sergui Pletosu without dropping a single game. Boykin, Phillips, and Bryan Stonestreet also notched two wins last weekend.

The Sunday match versus the South Carolina Gamecocks, ranked 37th in the nation according to the ITA, had a different tone with a 2-5 loss. The Wildcats surprised South Carolina with their doubles play, which included victories for Hansen/Boykin and Winebarger/Gould. The lone singles win came from an outstanding performance from freshman Bryan Stonestreet.

“Those two really began to click towards the end of the fall season, namely in their match against Tennessee,” said Price. “I expect them to continue improving their play and serve as a major factor in the doubles.”

This season, Price looks upon returning players Moreno, Kelley Cantrell, Hilu, and Gayle Jones as well as freshmen Lindsay Offutt and Katherine Hatch to play in the lineup. Said Price, “I expect a competitive season from a matured, solid team ready to attack our 25-match schedule.”

“Lack of talent will not be the weakness for the Wildcats but rather a lack of experience,” said Frank. “Although our schedule…”
