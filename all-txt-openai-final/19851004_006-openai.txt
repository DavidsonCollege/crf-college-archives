**Soccer team beats VMI, ties Erskine**

By ANDY BARRON

Davidson’s soccer team did not have a blockbuster week equivalent to their previous week’s effort. Yet the Wildcats showed tremendous poise in coming back to tie Erskine 3-3 last Saturday and determination in beating VMI 3-1 on a rain-soaked field on Wednesday. Davidson is now 4-4-1 on the year and 2-0 in Southern Conference play. The Wildcats are the only undefeated team in their half of the conference.

After the great success of the week before the Erskine game, a letdown loomed as an ominous threat to Davidson’s rapid turnaround of fortune. Erskine was the perfect opponent to lull Davidson into a lackluster performance. Though Erskine is 16th ranked in the NAIA and gave defending national champion Clemson all they could handle, it isn’t easy to get as excited about playing Erskine as it is when playing Duke.

At first, Davidson’s fears were realized as Erskine jumped out to a 2-0 lead in the first half. “Erskine got some great shots,” coach Charlie Slagle said. “We weren't playing that badly, they just happened to be playing well.”

Momentum made a quick shift to Davidson's side just before the first half ended. Senior Sean Austin got clear on a breakaway and beat the goalie to get an open shot on goal. Before Austin could shoot, however, he was tackled by Erskine’s goalie. The referee awarded a penalty kick which senior Wallis Goodman deposited in the back of the net. The goal came with nine seconds remaining in the first half. Halftime score: Erskine 2, Davidson 1.

In the second half, Davidson gave “a clinic in set plays,” in the words of assistant coach David Flowers. Junior Steve Stith launched a rocket shot into the upper left-hand corner of the goal on an indirect free kick to tie the game. Later, sophomore Steve Ott, who tapped the ball to Stith on the second goal, gave Davidson the lead on a direct free kick. “I knew we’d have to do well on set plays to score consistently against the caliber of competition we scheduled this season,” Slagle commented. “Lately, we’ve been executing set plays well and it’s helped us a lot.”

Unfortunately, Davidson wasn’t able to hold the lead for long. Erskine scored again to knot the score at three. Neither team was able to score again despite twenty minutes of overtime. Slagle was not disappointed with a tie. “I look at the game thinking we came back from a 2-0 deficit, not that we blew a 3-2 lead,” Slagle said. “They were a tough team. Both sides played well and I'm glad we got out of there without a loss.”

Davidson’s game with VMI last Wednesday could not have been played on a wetter field. Despite playing on a surface that bore a closer resemblance to Lake Norman than a soccer field, Davidson scored quickly and never trailed. Senior Tony Cabrales rammed a crowd pleaser off the post that landed, conveniently, at junior Bran Shockley’s feet. Shockley took advantage of the situation and scored an easy goal to give Davidson a 1-0 lead. Shortly afterwards, sophomore Tracy Hankins made the score 2-0. In the second half, junior sweeper Chris Jones headed in a goal on a corner kick to make the score 3-0. VMI also added a header on a corner kick to make the final 3-1.

Davidson hosts defending Southern Conference champion Furman tomorrow at 11:30 a.m. This could be a preview of this season’s Southern Conference championship game as Furman is the clear favorite in the conference’s Southern Division. On Monday, Davidson hosts cross-country rival UNCC.

**Cross country team**

By RAND HARTSELL

To the victor go the spoils . . . (or some such thing as that). Afternoon shopping trips to Charlotte? Beach Boys tickets? Getting the coaches’ ears pierced? Hot-pink running tights? What kind of workouts are these?

After cruising to victory for the second straight weekend, Davidson’s women's cross-country team evidently feels it’s entitled to a few frivolities. Davidson scored 16 points to Furman’s 39. Apparently, however, the Cat’s afternoon excursion into Charlotte has resulted in a lapse of mental focus. When asked how she expected the team to do in this weekend's NAIA regional meet at Pembroke State, senior captain Judy Dalton, suffering from acute psychological unpreparedness claimed, “Well, if we get our offense together, I think we score two touchdowns.” More likely, however, is that Dalton was merely delirious from Monday’s...Strenuous workout. None of the team members seemed too adverse to Coach Sterling Martin’s recommendation that everyone “take it easy.” The workout will have served its purpose by this time next week. The women should continue their winning ways. With all the runners improving every week and the soccer team scrambling for control of the ball.

Gridders now 0-4
Newberry thumps Davidson
By MIKE ADAMS

Newberry College ran and passed over, around, and through Davidson to hand the Wildcats their worst defeat of the season, 41-0, on Saturday. Newberry outplayed the Cats in every aspect of the game. They piled up 452 yards of total offense while holding Davidson to 103 yards. Newberry had 26 first downs while the Cats could manage only seven. Newberry gained more yards rushing and more yards passing than Davidson.

Offensively, the Cats seemed unable to generate anything. Davidson’s longest drive of the day gained only 40 yards in eight plays. Sophomore Charlie Winborne got his first start at quarterback but was ineffective. He completed only three of ten passes for 19 yards. Winborne also handled the punting chores for the Wildcats and had nine punts for a 33-yard average. Winborne was forced to punt because the Wildcats’ regular punter and leading receiver, senior Jay Poag, missed the game due to an injury. Juniors Steve Bradley and Jack McCollum also saw action at quarterback. Bradley was 1 of 18 for 67 yards and McCollum completed five of ten passes for 46 yards.

The Cats were again hurt by an ineffective ground game. The rushing attack actually lost 28 yards in the game. One positive offensive note was the play of freshman Brian Overcash. He led the Cats in receiving with six catches for 40 yards. Davidson has little depth and it is encouraging to see contributions from freshmen.

Davidson's defense gave up a lot of points and a lot of yards to Newberry. Head coach Vic Gatto spoke well of their effort, however. “Our defense really stayed with it at Newberry, but we were on the field too long,” he said. Davidson has little depth at almost every defensive position and Newberry was able to wear them down. Sophomore nose guard Emanuel Burch and junior defensive end Marcus Allen played well on defense for the Cats. According to Gatto, “Burch has had four good games in a row.”

The struggling Wildcats will try to improve their 0-4 record against the Paladins at Furman in a 1:30 game at Richardson Stadium on Saturday. Furman may be the toughest opponent of the year and they are coming off of a big win against North Carolina State this past weekend. Poag will probably be available for Saturday’s game, but senior running back Horace Manor will not be able to play.

Optimistic about regionals with the addition of sophomore transfer Sarah Longley, the Cats should have little trouble with Campbell University or Pembroke State. Should Davidson win the meet, they will travel to Kenosha, WI in November to compete in the NAIA National Championships. It would be the women’s team’s fourth consecutive trip to Kenosha.

The men’s team hopes to accompany the women to the championship. While the first two races of the season left much to be said in terms of the men’s team’s overall performance, Saturday proved to be their best effort to date. Even though the Citadel was far and away the class of the field, Davidson’s men’s team nearly avenged their early season loss to Furman. The final tally showed the Citadel the easy winner with 17 points. Furman squeaked by the Cats 56-61.

One reason for the Cats’ improvement was junior Greg Foreman’s long-awaited return to form. Foreman followed senior captain Frank Hague by only 16 seconds as Hague set another personal record for 5 miles. Senior Rob Watkins, freshman Bill Whitfield, and junior Emil Cekada fill out Davidson’s scoring.

Davidson will again need strong performances tomorrow. Their only competition will come from Pembroke State. In order for the Cats to qualify for the National Championship, they must win the meet. Senior Taylor Simpson's return from an injury hiatus will aid the Cats’ cause. The flat course will be to the team’s liking. With good running, both the men’s and women’s teams will have the good fortune of enjoying the spoils of victory — the excursion to Kenosha and the frivolity of taking their exams early. The NAIA National Championship has a penchant for coinciding with the weekend of fall term exams.
