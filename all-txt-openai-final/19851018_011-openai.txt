Hearts

To the Editor:

A mechanical heart? The phrase conjures up images of Buck Rogers or the worst politician one has ever seen. But
this latest gadget in the medicine-for-profit field is also a sad metaphor describing our age.

For millennia, the heart has symbolized the core of human concern; the center of compassion; the universal locus of love.
From the Tin Man in the “Wizard of Oz” to the latest country-western tune, our culture repeatedly affirms that a
“good-hearted” person will care about others, will reach out to strangers, will be “a bridge over troubled waters.”

But over against this poetic notion stands a glaring self-centeredness. Let the poor feed themselves; let the homeless find a
box somewhere; let the starving overseas eat cake if there is no bread. It has fallen to the rock musicians
to stir the national conscience about world hunger. Our political leaders are too busy arguing over what kind of weapons
to put into space, or how to give a tax break to those suffering “middle income” folk (with $30,000 or
more a year). Who wants to spend money on wheat when a shiny, nuclear-powered, x-ray “thing-bob-whizzer” can be purchased for
just a few billion dollars? Why worry about the homeless, when we must find a way for people to own
both a house in town and a cabin at the lake?

Which brings us back to our metaphor of the mechanical heart. Here the medical industry has certainly struck the right
chord for our national mood. Humana Hospital, a for-profit medical chain, is working on a high-tech, super-sophisticated 21st-century marvel. When
it is perfected, it will lengthen the life of anyone who can afford the latest model. Though a small step
for humankind, it will be a great leap forward for people who find that money is no object in their
pursuit of longevity. Meanwhile, the infant mortality rate continues to climb in West Virginia, and Chicago hospitals are documenting cases
of protein deficiency in local children. Sorry kids, we have no hi-tech milk, no space-age vitamins. But if you live
long enough, maybe someone will buy you a new heart someday.

We do need new hearts. But the kind we need cannot be built in the laboratory. They can only be
discovered as people care for the least, the last, and the lost. Like the Tin Man, we may have more
heart than we realize. I hope so. But it is clear that the Wizard cannot invent one for us, nor
install it on the easy credit plan. To rediscover our heart, we have to look at the suffering among the
helpless, and then we must look deep within ourselves.
