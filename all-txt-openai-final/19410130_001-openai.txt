Davidson's annual Festival Chorus under the direction of our own

Annual Mid-Winter Festivities Begin With Friday Dances; Local, Queens, and Davidson Musicians to Perform

Exams have ended and brought with them a feeling of relief and accomplishment. The annual Mid-Winter Festival will be presented in Chambers Auditorium on February 9, at the vesper service. The program will feature Gounod's Messe Solennelle with orchestral accompaniment by the Little Symphony augmented by musicians from Queens and Davidson. Mrs. Arthur Rohr, soprano from Kannapolis, and Mr. William Barnett, baritone from Charlotte, will be soloists.

Sir Hubert Wilkins, world-renowned explorer and scientist, will deliver a lecture on "Aviation and the War" on Wednesday, February 5, at 8:15 p.m. in Chambers Auditorium. Sir Hubert has had extensive experience with airplanes and the current World War. He is known for his Arctic explorations and his attempt to explore the Arctic regions with a submarine. He has spent ten years in the Arctic and six years in the Antarctic, participating in seven different polar expeditions, more than any other living man. The King of England knighted him at forty, and recently the British called on him as a special scientific consultant.

The flu epidemic laid about one-sixth of the student body out at one time or another. At present, no official statement has been made concerning when exams will take place. The efficient infirmary staff has been instrumental in keeping the flu epidemic in check.

Ray McKinley, one of the nation's outstanding drummers, will be one of the artists featured when Will Bradley's orchestra plays for the Pan-Hellenic Mid-Winters series. McKinley was one of the original members of the Bradley orchestra and has been favorably compared to Gene Krupa by musical critics.

Davidson's basketball team steps to the firing line in a big way this week, with four games slated. This week will influence the Cats' final status in the conference to a large extent, and they need all our support, especially when playing out-of-town.

Dr. Lewis Schenck, professor of Bible at Davidson, has recently published a book entitled "The Presbyterian Doctrine of Children in the Covenant." This book deals with "A historical study of the significance of infant baptism."
