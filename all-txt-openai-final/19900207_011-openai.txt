THE DAVIDSONIAN

A moving drama written from actual narratives recounts the years of slavery through EMANCIPATION. Take yourself back to the 1930s
to the Virginia Old Folks Home for the Colored. You will hear the tales and tribulations of the elderly—spry and
sprite. It could be any old folk’s home... you will delight in the stories.

GERMAN BIER, from page 10

In terms of production and marketing, there is no German equivalent to our Budweiser. Instead, there are hundreds of microbreweries
across the country, each brewing its own brand of beer. Beck’s, described by Fischer as “an average German beer,” is
about as common in Germany as Bud is in America, but no further parallel can be drawn between the two.

St. Pauli Girl, named after the Hamburg Red Light district, is rarely seen in Germany. Lowenbrau is the type of
beer available at a gas station on Sunday.

All of the beers tasted this week can be purchased at Belk of Southpark and La’Mart Deli and Wines on
Sharon Amity. Spaten, one of our favorites, is also sold locally at Tastefully Yours in Cornelius.

On the whole, however, Charlotte’s selection of German beer has been low lately. Southpark Belk’s beer guy attributed this to
“the German debacle.” Apparently, someone associated with one of Charlotte’s German restaurants was nabbed for bootlegging large quantities of German
beer across multiple state lines by the ABC officials. As a direct result, the ABC board has been monitoring the
importation of German beer very closely.

Next week Dr. Robin Barnes, Kris Rengel ‘90, and German student Sonja Fecher will join me in tasting the balance
of the German beers currently available in the Charlotte market.

This column is written out of the concern that in a quest for quantities of beer, people too often overlook
its quality.
