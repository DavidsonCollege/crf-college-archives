Demerson discusses Roman Catholic sodality in Brazil

By Laura McCandlish

When West African women were enslaved in Brazil, they transformed their Yoruba-derived religious practices under a Roman Catholic disguise. Last Monday night in the 900 Room of the College Union, an Ethnic Studies Lecture Series explored this topic in a discussion entitled, “The Sisterhood of Our Lady of Good Death: The African Face of a Roman Catholic Sodality in Northeastern Brazil.” Dr. Brenda Flanagan, English professor and chair of the Ethnic Studies program, introduced the evening. Carla Demerson outlined the historic roles played by religious associations among enslaved Africans in Brazil. Bullock '02, who has an Ethnic Studies concentration in Latin America, presented the speaker, Dr. Bamidele Agbasegbe Demerson, the Curator for Education at the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History in Detroit, Michigan.

Demerson began his presentation on a personal note, explaining that he and Dr. Flanagan had been friends since they were students together at the University of Michigan, as they met “over a quarter of a century ago.” Demerson has conducted anthropological field research in West Africa, South America, and North America. His research reports on comparative families and visual arts have appeared in numerous journals and anthologies.

Demerson’s focus is on Brazil, and when he does field work, he said, “I focus on myself and the society we live in as I go to study a different society, so as to understand our similarities and differences.” Through the use of slides and personal observations, Demerson gave the audience an inside view of The Sisterhood of Our Lady of Good Death, a Roman Catholic sodality whose membership is composed of women of African descent. This sodality, Demerson explained, provides an opportunity to examine how “the folk” in Northeastern Brazil have transformed some aspects of the Catholic Church to conform to their social and spiritual needs.

Demerson highlighted the annual mid-August festival that the sisterhood sponsors in the town of Cachoeira in the state of Bahia. This festival appears to honor the Virgin Mary, known as Our Lady of Good Death, for her victory over death and her Assumption into heaven. However, the sodality’s women, by remembering the history of slavery in Brazil, use the festival to also celebrate the liberation of their foremothers from bondage. This ceremony appears Roman Catholic at first glance, with its sacral acts, liturgical vestments, and sacred foods, yet the rituals are permeated by the Sisterhood of Candomble, a West African Yoruba-derived religion practiced in Bahia.

In this presentation, Demerson outlined the historic roles played by religious associations among enslaved Africans in Brazil. He discussed a disturbing image of the woman, Anastasia, often depicted by Afro-Brazilians with an iron mask, representing their “obligatory baptism into the religion of their enslavers.” As the slaves were exposed to new religious practices, they adapted and transformed them to fit their own cultural and spiritual needs.values and gods, they began to meet in private to continue their African religious rituals,” Demerson said. They worshipped their Yoruba gods, Orixas, in the disguise of the Catholic saints. Allen Lee '01, who has an Africana Ethnic Studies concentration and plans to study abroad in Brazil, thanked Demerson at the close of his presentation and introduced the debate portion of the evening’s lecture. Lee introduced Davidson Spanish professor, Dr. Luciano Campos Picanco, who has his Ph.D. in Francophone Caribbean Literature and specializes in Brazilian Culture and Society. Demerson and Picanco then engaged in a debate on the religious practices in Brazil, specifically whether the sisterhood presents a Brazilian or African appearance of Catholicism. Following the debate, Jenny Corke '00, who also has an Africana Ethnic Studies concentration, closed the program.
