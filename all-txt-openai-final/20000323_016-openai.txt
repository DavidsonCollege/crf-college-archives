Irwin Belk track to make its debut Saturday
Wildcats’ first home meet since 1990

In 1991, Davidson’s track was reduced to three lanes in order to facilitate the NCAA College Cup at Richardson Stadium.
After nine years on the road, the Davidson Wildcats will host a home meet on Saturday.

Coming off their best season in 20 years, the Wildcats are ready to show the Davidson community what it’s been
missing.

“There’s just something exhilarating about being able to perform in front of your peers,” senior co-captain Adam Marcotte remarked. “I
think almost any athlete would attest that a crowd full of cheering friends will inevitably enhance the team’s performance.”

“With Davidson’s track program taking a giant step forward, the opportunity to host a home meet provides the team with
an arena to showcase our hard work by delivering incredible performances,” junior Keith Chapman added.

Chapman is no stranger to stellar performances, having already blazed an outstanding 1:57.27 this year in the 800-meter dash.

The Irwin Belk Invitational will be the second meet in the outdoor season for the Wildcats. This past weekend, Davidson
joined UNC, Bucknell, Wofford, Wake Forest, Duke, and others at UNC Charlotte. In his collegiate track & field debut, Ryan
Ferrier delivered an outstanding performance and led all the 5000m runners with a time of 16:14.

Teams competing in the Irwin Belk Invitational:
- Appalachian State University
- Campbell University
- Coastal Carolina University
- Davidson College
- Gardner Webb University
- UNC Asheville
- UNC Greensboro
- Wofford

Greg Schernecke, Davidson’s freshman phenom in the sprints and jumps, hopes there will be a large turnout to watch his
long jump on Saturday so that people can see him “get nasty.” Schernecke recently set the indoor school record in
the 200m dash with a time of 22.8 seconds, offsetting the previous record, which was set in 1997.

For the first time ever, Davidson is looking to send some of its very own to the prestigious Penn Relays
in late April.

Coach Gary Andrew has suggested that if the 800m runners perform well in the coming meets, then they will be
able to qualify for the Relays.

Front runners for the trip to Philadelphia include Dan Gibson, Davidson record holder in the 800m, 1500m, and indoor 5000m;
Jay Jahnes, who has delivered several heroic performances recently in the 800m and 1500m; Keith Chapman; and freshman Jimmy Swansborough.
These Wildcats will be aiming for solid times Saturday in their bids to qualify for Penn.

Davidson’s two-time Track & Field MVP, Brent Ferrell, hopes for the opportunity to improve his personal bests and set more
school records.

“I hope we’ll have some records go down this Saturday,” Ferrell said. “The new track is a truly wonderful facility—people
should see us use it.”

“The new track provides a medium for some excellent performances,” senior Thomas McElveen said.

@ Paula Abdul’s "Forever Your Girl" was the No. 1 album on the Billboard Charts. Milli Vanilli’s album was in
the top 10 and New Kids on the Block made an appearance in the top 20.

Cross country team wins academic honor

The Davidson women's cross country team has earned a major academic honor from the Women's Intercollegiate Cross Country Coaches Association.

The Wildcat women's team was one of 109 teams to earn Academic All-American honors for 1999. To earn the honor,
a team must finish the fall semester with a team GPA of 3.00 or better. The Wildcats, who finished ninth
at the Southern Conference Championships, had a team GPA of 3.26 this past fall. They were one of only 69
teams to earn the honors “with distinction” by achieving at least a 3.25 GPA.
