Sweep 8 Boot
A photo essay

Davidson vs. Colgate. Davidson has the ball on its own 25, first and ten. Coach Ed Farrell sends in the
play — Sweep 8 Boot.

(1) Quarterback Bob McCarthy (13) fakes a sweep around right end to Craig Pyles (45). The two guards, Nicky Guy
(67) and Chip Howell (62), pull left to block for the bootlegging McCarthy. Colgate’s Carl Nesselbush (44) slips Guy’s block
and turns the play back in toward the middle. Defensive end Sid Harris (82) closes on the quarterback.

(2) Harris catches McCarthy as he crosses the line of scrimmage.

(3) Harris and an unidentified Colgate player drag McCarthy down for a gain of three yards.
