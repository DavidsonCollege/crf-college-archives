### Typography for the People

There is a new typesetting machine on campus, working under the aegis of the Davidsonian, and all the world is
abuzz about it. At least everyone here at the Davidsonian has been caught up in the fuss, and if that’s
a representative sampling, then this machine’s fame has become legend. Your parents, through a non-deductible contribution to the Activities Tax
(regressive, I’m told), have bought a $22,000 typesetter for your enjoyment. Permit us to show it off a bit.

The first thing to catch your eye as you peruse the news is the size of the type. Headlines are
big, photo credits small. What the new typesetter can do that other small machines can’t is change type size by
the finest of fine degrees, allowing us the aesthetic freedom to self-select the size most suitable to our format. [The
text you are reading has gradually shrunk — before your very eyes — from normal size (eleven points tall) to
pre-1970s Davidsonian standard (eight points tall). It was a trifle small.]

More typographic fun: to fit a tad more copy into a given space, we slim each letter by four percent.
Why four? Visual appeal. The machine could just as well make it two or five or fifty, or even expand
by the same amount. [The text you are reading has gradually expanded — before your very eyes — to 130
percent of its original (96 percent) size.]

Not impressed? Here’s the coup de grâce — accents and special characters. Suppose Søren Kierkegaard were to pay us a
call: we could say so. If Nick Graham wants to put Œdipus in this week’s film review, then by all
means let him! Ångströms. Señoritas. Zaire. Make up your own if you like and send us a letter about how
bad “Himés” has become. We can take it. (There is a drawback. I was called upon to describe the day’s
reading assignment in Dr. Taylor’s Jesus. “*Pratorium” was spelled “Praetorium,” un-digraphed,” I observed. I was firmly rebuked. Typography does that.)

Beyond digraphs (Æ, Œ, and ß) lie the ligatures ‘fi’ and ‘fl.’ Beyond ligatures: superscript, inferior, and SMALL CAPS.

### Zip-Plus-Four

The campus got its new zip code schema this week, and what a blessing! If you haven't cracked the code
yet, here's a tip. Append your box number to 28036. Compare. Neat trick with numbers, right? Sadly though, postage is
hopping to twenty cents next month in order to fund, one supposes, the Postal Think Tank that dreamed it all
up. What's next, the campus asks. The day may be forthcoming when the sleek zip-plus-more code is inaugurated, promising a
new age in speedy mail service. Here's how it might go, should you wish to drop us a line years
hence:

### Dressing Down: A Reply to Eric Long and His Pakistani Garb

For someone who displays a modicum of intelligence in his aversion to prep and beach, Mr. Long evidently chose not
to utilize that degree of intelligence while writing a major portion of his article in the Davidsonian. In “Dressing Up,”
Mr. Long urges us to “look beyond the Davidson image,” whatever he conceives that to be. In an article attacking
prejudices, Mr. Long seems to have a few of his own.

Mr. Long labels the “styles and standards” of the South as “boring.” Well, there’s no accounting for taste, but as
a Southerner, I can tell you just what my old man has to tell those who share your opinion: love
it or leave it. You have identified the South with the prep look and beach music. I am an authority
on neither, but I refute your belief that their popularity can be explained in psychological and sociological terms. I assert
that the prep-look is not a fad but the norm for the upper class. Having lived among the upper class
(though I do not consider myself to be included in this group), I can assure you that whether you are
in Ohio, Los Angeles, or Miami, the old men will be wearing the same thing on the golf course. The
reason for the prep-look popularity among others can be...Accounted for by several theories. First, I theorize that people are aware
of the degree of freedom of expression they have at college. At home, where one is known by his past
actions and appearances, one need not declare his individuality and social class; the people included in your "practical environment" are
aware of your standing. However, when someone arrives at college, he can present whatever image he chooses to. The same
is true of several other situations, such as a trip abroad or a simple vacation. Many opt for the "sophisticated,
leader-of-the-pack" image. However, they merely become followers within that pack and are led by whatever social trend is embraced by
Madison Avenue or Hollywood. You can see that this has nothing in common with tradition. People also tend to mask
their insecurities. The only people who aren’t insecure are either crazy or dead. Some people cope with their insecurity by
endorsing guns. Some people cope with it by seeking to restrict guns. Others seek to mask their insecurity by fading
into the group. By wearing those “alligators and topsiders,” preppies are identifying themselves as being independently insecure. For my purposes,
the term “preppies” does not include the true upper class, who, with exceptions, generally display this taste in fashion. Preppies
are also sensitive to the image of the upper class as being satisfying, leisurely, and at once very desirable. Though
they cannot become true upper class from appearances, they emulate the upper class. Thus, in the relative freedom of the
college environment, you have what appears to be a hell of a lot of wealthy, socially elite students. Preppies aren't
alone in this general trend; one might be surprised to see the other “worldly” possessions of many a Cadillac-owner. This
all comes back to Mr. Long and his controversial Pakistani garb. Despite the “worldliness” Mr. Long displays in his example
of the leather-jacketed girl with “ornate tattoos over her legs and breasts,” Mr. Long still doesn’t seem to understand why
his debut of Pakistani fashion was met with “laughs and snickers behind [his] back.” If none of this is your
cup of tea, well and good. You're probably one of those who read for content. But the fruits are yours
to enjoy, regardless. The Davidsonian | PO Box 218 Davidson, NC 28036-0218-NC-Davidson-Davidsonian, The-28036 or were people just polite enough not
to laugh in his face? Mr. Long must realize that people’s clothing is an expression of themselves. Even the individual
insincerity of the prep-look is overshadowed by what Mr. Long calls “a million other preps.” By wearing preppy clothes, these
people are identifying themselves as being members of what amounts to a “preppy consciousness.” What was Mr. Long identifying himself
as? A Pakistani exchange student? A subversive? A trail-blazing individual doing battle with the “Davidson norm?” Whatever he was doing,
it came off as what it was: trite. I am glad that Davidson's students trusted their initial common sense and
socially instilled instincts, subsequently expressing their surprise and humor at Mr. Long’s spectacle. Perhaps if we were true to our
instincts, we wouldn’t have those idiots parachuting onto the World Trade Center. I didn’t have the opportunity to witness Mr.
Long’s fashion promenade or the reactions of the observers, but I believe the only one at fault, suffering from a
lack of practical “enlightenment,” was Mr. Long. It is not that Mr. Long violated the norm that elicited these reactions;
it is his inherent insincerity (possibly unknown to him) that shocked people and subsequently angered (embarrassed?) him. Mr. Long is
not a Pakistani. He is not an exchange student. This is not Pakistan. Mr. Long got what he deserved. The
“weirdos” and “hippies” Mr. Long referred to are sincere in their garb, just as I am when I pull on
my boots. I was wearing my clothes and listening to my music when Urban Cowboy was Saturday Night Fever. If
Mr. Long wants to avoid the social criticism and alienation he met with, I suggest he pack up his Pakistani
clothes and wear the clothes people are used to seeing him in, be they oxfords, Nikes, or topsiders.
