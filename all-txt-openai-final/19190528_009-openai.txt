**We Are Coming, Blue Ridge. Look Out! Show Them the True Davidson Spirit**

The last chance to get good reservations for the Blue Ridge Conference will soon have passed. The committee has invited one hundred college professors to the conference, so the space is filling up fast. A dozen Davidson men have signed up, and several others are most sure to be there. Everyone who can should by all means go to Blue Ridge. To those who have signed up, do not fail to bring your Davidson pennants. All the other colleges will be there showing their college spirit, and Davidson will, too. Chalmers says to leave out all “extras” and pack in plenty of “pep.” Davidson should have the best showing at this conference she has ever had. Those who have signed up so far are: L. L. McAllister, D. M. Chalmers, L. B. Schenck, C. B. Robson, L. G. Calhoun, J. S. Brown, Ralston Bitzer, W. P. Cunningham, Dr. H. B. Arbuckle, and Mr. and Mrs. R. W. Miles, Jr. Davidson should have a splendid year in the “Y” next term from the number going up to Blue Ridge. Let everyone come back next fall with a will to put the “Y” across.

**“WE DIE FIGHTING,” BUT WATCH US COME BACK**

Davidson made a very creditable showing in the Southern Intercollegiate Tennis Tourney held in Atlanta, May 22-May 24, the Wildcats finishing in the final brackets of the doubles and in the semi-final of the singles. The entries were: Georgia Tech, Tennessee, Tulane, Mercer, and Davidson. Georgia Tech ran the doubles in a hard-fought match against Davidson, while Tulane won the single honors. Davidson sent as her representatives D. F. Hall, Jr. and F. H. Spence. Both played sterling games and kept up the old tradition “That we die fighting.” Mercer University was eliminated by an unfortunate misunderstanding. Davidson defeated the University of Tennessee 6-1, 6-2, 1-6, 7-5. Hall’s service was perfect, keeping the Tennesseans on the defense at all times, and his well-placed passes missed the back line by only a few inches. Tech defeated Tulane 6-4, 6-7. Tech played great tennis in the finals.

**The Peanut Parcher**

“You did very poorly in attendance. Your report only gives you 72.”
“There’s a mistake somewhere,” said E. Flinn, “I didn’t take that this year.”

Mason sent his first consignment of personal property home last week via parcel post and Barber Junction.

Did you know that there are 108 steps between the Cupola and the ground and vice versa?

We have heard of all kinds of propositions, but Morrison's washing club is a novelty in the fields of high finance. “Forty cents a week, or if you want to pay in advance, two dollars a month,” is the proposition with which he insults the intelligence of the student body.

Ex-temporary-professor of Military Science and Tactics, R. D. Hall, left for home on May 20th. No, we don’t know what tickets he was taking.

May we suggest to Babe Sherrill that he refrain from tumbling down steps when slipping out of church?

Master Elwood Boney has a new playmate in the person of a mud turtle.

Little boys who meet the seven-eleven next year must have their faces clean, hair slicked and parted in the middle, shoes shined, and wear white blouses. They must not speak unless spoken to, and under no circumstance shall they stare at the girls who pass through on the trains.

We suggest a special phonograph record bearing a choice line of uncomplimentary remarks for the benefit of those who fail to pull any mail. Said record to be played in the post office just after the mail from every train has been put up.

“I generally pull that one in society,” said Liston as he apologized for one of his usual weak ones, which as usual had failed to get the usual laugh.

May 14th—Edward Owings Guerrant Lilly gets to chapel on time.

**THE BUSHVILLE WEEKLY BUNGLE: Thank goodness, it doesn’t come oftener.**

The student council ticket composed of Spann, Spence, and Liston wished to thank the party giving it its one vote in the recent elections.

Ow Harrel has discovered a way by which he may cut down the high cost of smoking. He has planted the entire supply of ashes which he cut from his veteran pipe during the month of May, and says that he hopes to find a good crop of tobacco when he returns in the fall. Sharks of finance take notice and see how it is done by an expert.

R. T. L. Ect. Liston in a recent deal asked the following question, as he was trying to buy a certain article. “I'll start at five dollars and you start at ten dollars. If I keep on coming up will you keep on coming down?”

**Homecomings:**

When Johnnie comes marching home.
Class reunions.
When the cows come home.
When that report pulls in.

At the coming term of the local court of injustice, the case of the famous beef trust will be tried. The boarding house managers led by the chief of the Yiddese, Jew Wilson, have brought suit against the beef trust composed of Campbell, Sherrill, and McPheeters, not Inc. The case will be argued before his honor, Ikey McAlister. The affirmative, no, we mean the prosecution, will be represented by C. Gaither, the sinking young lawyer from Catawba County. He will be contradicted by His Majesty Spann, who read law for several years under Junie McLees, the eminent author of numerous works of jurisprudence among which may be mentioned “The Civil Rights of a Hobo,” “Is Crap-Shooting Legal?” If public opinion had its way, all parties concerned would be banished to Charlotte, or some equally dead hole, for an indefinite period.

In the Peanut Parcher’s bone-head contest, which has just closed, John D. Wiley secured the dog. The race was close until the 15th of May, on which date the above-referred-to gentleman aroused himself and endeavored to read his Eco parallel for the term, since the exam was to be held on the following day. Chapter four in a certain work on statistics was among the readings assigned. John D. went in search of the said book, which he knew had a red binding, and finally came upon what he considered was the object of his quest. After he had read some ten pages of the book and made some remarks the substance of which was that the professor had already told them all of that stuff in class, another boy entered the room and informed Mr. Wiley that he was engaged in perusing Angell’s “Chapters from Modern Psychology.”

Be sure you know what you are doing and then do it.

All things on earth must end, and so we have come to praise and bury the Peanut Parcher—until next fall. For the time has come to say farewell, and gone, and so have you. And we are glad you have—for we know you enjoy being with your home folks again, and that girl: Oh, she must indeed be glad that you have left Davidson. We've tried to entertain you here this spring, and if we haven't succeeded—well, some people never could appreciate good things anyway. But now we have come to that one good thing which must always touch every heart—Goodbye. The Peanut Parcher has finished speaking.

THOS. SPENCE.

The Seniors’ Own. (Continued from Page 5)

“Rolling Stone Gathers No Moss,” So It Is With “Pebble.” Dr. Thomas Clarence Stone, C. O. D. BV. D. “Pebble,” the man from Stoneville, and Boaz’s delight. He is not exactly a lady charmer but has high ambitions, hoping some day to rise to the accomplishments of “Guy” Jones. “Pebble” lacks only one thing that Jones has, and that's slick hair. But maybe that can be acquired. He has been borrowing snake oil recently anyway. “Pebble” expects to get everything out of tobacco that there is in it, as was shown in his Junior oration—even from a plug of “Brown's Mule” to a Pall Mall. “Pebble” has many accomplishments, but greatest of all is his ability to act as guide in “D” Co. Recently he lost his company on the athletic field, and they were all out of step but “Pebble.” He takes Terrestro—and after July the first he will drink it for two purposes. But “Pebble” is a great business man as was well shown by his great success on the Davidsonian. He has quieted down during his Senior year and is no longer a “Bloody Soph,” but a refined gentleman, and an honor to the class with which he graduates.

“Rail Road” Clarke. “Star.” “Bob Clarke, the star heaver of the Presbyterians, will probably oppose the Virginians this afternoon.” So read the headlines of the Charlotte Observer, and "Rob" Clarke did oppose them, in fact he shut them out. The next day the Observer read thus: “This ‘unassuming’ young chap pitched brilliant ball and the husky lad can also hit, driving out three hits in five appearances at the bat.” Thus we send “Railroad,” as he is most commonly known on the campus, into the game of life, to make hits on diamonds and play the hearts—in fact we noticed he had some very good tryouts and general practices during the recent commencement. We hope that he will continue to fame in the world of chance when he begins his career in the business world at his native home—the VILLAGE of Estill, S.C.

We Now Invite Your Attention to Our Next Subject, “Jeff” the Counterpart of “Mutt” of the “Bud” Fisher Duet. Audrey, son of Clyde, more commonly known among the “Riff” and “Raff” as “Jeff,” is one of the greatest prodigies of the class of ‘19. Those of us who room in Rumple are lulled to sleep every night by the lullabies of this famous tenor singer, accompanied on the mandolin by himself. Being small in stature this species of South Carolina, upper four hundred is not, by far, small in mind. By a series of petitions he has succeeded in getting off more than two years’ work in his Senior year. This we attribute largely to the influence of his studious roommate—who is also looking forward to a “Dip” with a telescope. No doubt young Inman expects to enter the grand opera or the “Russian Ballet.” We wish him luck in either.

John D. Watt—The Greatest of Electricians. “Heap sees and few knows”—that's John D’s. motto. He says he goes to Cornelius Saturday nights, but we know when his girl comes to Charlotte, and he can’t kid us. Anyway, he seems to be making progress somewhere, and let us hope that it is not in Cornelius. Somebody asked the other day if John D. was a Jew. No, this smooth black hair is just natural, and does not mean that he is “Yiddish.” They all like to smooth his pretty black hair, however.

Sam, Gilbert, Dalton, Ga. “FL A.C. O. T. S. Gilbert” came here four years ago popping his ear. Since then he has been popping bum jokes and Field Artillery “bull” ever since. We have no doubt that in future years he will be popping corn for five cents per bag, thus demonstrating the fact that he is a business man and not one of the common herd. Gilbert has been sorely disappointed in love this spring and we think that it is due to the fact that Hammett poured a pitcher of water in his boots. These boots have been placed in alcohol and are being preserved as an heirloom for the future Gilberts. We have no idea when the annual will be out but if he doesn’t stop going to Charlotte so much we know that the money will soon be out. (His palms always did itch for “de mun.”)

“Yank” Boswell, Penfield, Ga. Boswell says he hails from Penfield, Ga., but we always thought he was from Winston-Salem until he received a small insured package. Since that Boswell has been a little crazy but I guess everything will be O.K. if he has a few diamonds put in the contents of the little “package.” Boswell has so much love for “Jay Bird” that he followed him to Winston at six o'clock in the morning to find out if he passed “Bug.” This goes to prove that their love is mutual. Another proof is that he presented a turtle to “Jay Bird” the night before the exam.

Possum Dunlop. Despite the fact that Possum is getting very old and gray-headed and set in his ways, he’s falling in love. He recently went on a visit home during senior week and the number of fair dames that he met would surround or astound you. He spoke of meeting up with a very fast young flirt and as Possum is a flirt they seemed to suit each other and fell in love. He says her name is Miss Ethel Alcohol, so that it is no wonder that she has intoxicated him with love.

Edward On the Go Lilly. The Lilly of Winston and the Social Lion of Salem are one. We were astonished the other night when after returning from his seven-day visit to Winston-Salem he was said to have gently lifted his pillow from under his head in his sleep, and to have folded his arms gently around it and to have kissed the flirtish idol three times. Will wonders ever cease?

GRIT AND ACCURACY: Students, as a rule, are apt to improperly emphasize the importance of the routine class work in its bearing on their future success. By this statement it is not meant that we should not apply ourselves diligently to the details of class work, but rather to call attention to the valuable opportunities in the experiences of college life for the acquisition of an erect and manly expression, and last but by no means least, that grit which enables one to play a seemingly losing game and smile.

Every student owes it to himself to avoid that handicap of mental and physical indifference which is known as “slouchiness” and to cultivate accuracy of thinking and acting. Alertness leads to an access of ease and bearing that distinguishes the natural leader from those who make it a habit to follow. Accuracy in thinking is likewise a necessary asset to a successful career. Far too many students are satisfied with approximate answers. Practice in coordinating ideas and expressing them tersely and clearly will be rapidly reflected in the ease with which others grasp the matter which is intended to be conveyed.

Grit is perhaps the greatest asset of all. The ordinary student is not prepared for the rough edge of life. His feelings are too easily hurt and he is ready to give up the sponge at the first jolt. The idea of grit belongs in the classroom as well as on the campus and every student should endeavor to acquire that which makes for real accomplishments in every walk of life. In short, one should keep the goal in mind and not remark the roughness of the road.—The Tarheel.
