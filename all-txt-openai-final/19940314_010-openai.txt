**Scott's Oscar picks from the '93 flicks**

**BY Scott McLean**

It’s that time of year again when the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences honors those films and performances which they consider to be the year’s best. In keeping with tradition, I have again undertaken the task of predicting who will be honored at this year’s ceremonies on March 21. This makes three years now that I have tried to second guess Oscar and pick the winners, and I’ve correctly named the recipients of the Academy Award for the past two years (I don’t mean to toot my own horn here, but like Dolly says, “Sometimes you’ve got to toot your own horn or nobody will know you’re coming.”)

What’s my secret? Well, let’s just say that the members of the Academy are a conservative bunch whose decisions are not difficult to anticipate. The Academy usually chooses one film which racks up at the ceremonies, and this year that film is Schindler’s List (Do Driving Miss Daisy, Dances with Wolves, The Silence of the Lambs, and Unforgiven ring any bells?). That being said, let’s take a look at the nominees in the four major categories: Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Picture, and Best Director.

**Best Actor:** Daniel Day-Lewis, In the Name of the Father; Laurence Fishburne, What’s Love Got to Do With It; Tom Hanks, Philadelphia; Anthony Hopkins, The Remains of the Day; and Liam Neeson, Schindler’s List. Despite great performances by all the fellows in this category, the two front runners here are Tom Hanks and Anthony Hopkins. I do believe that, at this point, Oscar is leaning toward Mr. Hanks due to the fact that Anthony Hopkins just received an Oscar two years ago (for The Silence of the Lambs) and the Academy frowns on honoring an actor again so soon. Also, Hanks received the Golden Globe for Best Actor, which is usually seen to be a precursor of Oscar action.

**Best Actress:** Angela Bassett, What’s Love Got to Do with It; Stockard Channing, Six Degrees of Separation; Holly Hunter, The Piano; Emma Thompson, The Remains of the Day; Debra Winger, Shadowlands. The ladies had a terrific year in film as well, but this looks like a one-woman barbecue with Holly Hunter as the chef. She has won all the major critics’ awards and it looks like Oscar has her name written all over it, too.

**Best Director:** Jane Campion, The Piano; Steven Spielberg, Schindler’s List; Jim Sheridan, In the Name of the Father; James Ivory, The Remains of the Day.

The Davidson College student band scene was extremely active two years ago with Thurn + Taxis, Electrolux, and Residew all appearing on campus. Since then, the number of campus bands has dropped significantly. The band Three Days hopes it will have a hand in changing the dying Davidson music scene.

Residew, a band comprised of former Davidson students, formed in 1990-91 and performed at colleges from Ohio to Mississippi, but has since broken up. Not surprisingly, the band bowed to the pressures that students face after college when they try to balance playing in a band and going to graduate school. Music critic Tom Bavis says, "It is difficult to have a band on campus because everyone is so busy with other activities, but living in the communal environment of college has its advantages as well of being able to get together whenever they want.”

Freshmen Andrew O’Dell and Ravi Jain met some of those difficulties last semester but managed to form a band this semester. By word of mouth, Jain finally formed Three Days. One problem when organizing a band, according to Jain, is that “there is a surplus of guitarists, but very few drummers, bassists, and singers on campus.” Karl Ruch serves as the drummer for Three Days; he also doubles as the drummer for the Davidson CollegePep Band. Both Jain and O’Dell believe that Ruch is the most accomplished drummer on campus. In addition to Jain, Ruch, and O’Dell, the band includes Andy Morris and Will Nolen. The band is comprised of four freshmen and one sophomore, so if they stay together, they should be around for a couple of years. Three Days plays traditional, college-type music, but they are also trying to play music that could be used in some type of Christian worship. They hope to be able to play for fraternities using traditional music, but also perform in Charlotte for youth groups. The band plans to spice up worship songs using rock and roll. They want to show kids in youth groups that God’s influence extends to music. Both Jain and O’Dell emphasize that they are not just a Christian band. Bands often have difficulty in finding their place on campus, because there are few locations where they can show off their skills. Playing at a fraternity is risky, because people often have set ideas of what bands at parties should be like. Three Days plans to wait until they can perform for an hour and a half continuously before they attempt to play on campus. They have been concentrating mostly on college music since they formed, but they still hope to continue their idea of performing for youth groups and for worship services. A need for talented bands definitely exists on campus, and Three Days will, hopefully, lead a revival of bands on the Davidson campus.

With the production of Sam Shepard’s Buried Child, the theater department definitely put something new before the eyes of the Davidson population. And when people see something new, their first reaction is often negative. The “I don’t get it, so it must not have been very good” attitude is natural, and I’m sure many people grumbled those very words as they left the theater. What Dr. Gardner and his cast brought to us the last two weekends is a style of drama many of us have probably never seen before. Even beyond last semester’s brave production of Equus, Shepard’s Pulitzer Prize-winning play challenges the audience and makes them wonder if they should laugh, cry, or throw up their hands in frustration.

Shepard’s style is not one which lends itself to the once-a-year theater-goer. If you go to a play for the same reason you go see a Tom Cruise movie, to escape from the world for an hour or two, you probably do not like Buried Child. In fact, when you see Buried Child, you don’t escape from the world at all, but have a surreal version of it thrust right before your eyes. In its depiction of an extremely dysfunctional, even incestuous family, Buried Child is frighteningly real and flavored with an absurd humor. His characters like Tilden (Scott Lenhart) the fallen football star, Vince (Derek Judson) the forgotten son, Dodge (Jared Govan) the paralyzed grandfather, and Bradley (Frank Jernigan) the incomplete man appeal to very real fears of the human psyche. Shepard personifies our fears of paralysis, anonymity, castration, and failure in each of these characters, and then he exaggerates them by having them enact a ridiculous series of events. Father Dewis (Jared Floyd) represents the failure of organized religion, and his affair with Halie (Jennifer Neale), the mother of this failed family, turns to him futilely as a source of hope and redemption. For years, she has buried the past, primarily her incestuous offspring, and in the course of the play the family's terrible secrets are unearthed. In the end, Tilden digs up their child and symbolizes the catharsis they have all experienced. Shepard nags the audience as much by what he does not present as by what he presents. This dramatic style probably left many people puzzled.
