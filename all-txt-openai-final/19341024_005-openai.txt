#### Y.M.C.A. GROUP HEARS SWEETS
**Presbyterian Educator Speaks On Companionship In Sunday Service**

Dr. Henry H. Sweets of Louisville, KY, addressed the Y.M.C.A. Vesper service last Sunday night. Dr. Sweets is Executive Secretary
of the Assembly’s Committee on Christian Education and Ministerial Relief. The service was in charge of Don Bailey, who read
from the scripture in the fourteenth chapter of John, verses one to seventeen. Carleton Chapman opened the service with an
organ prelude, and Warren Babcock furnished the special music, playing Schubert's Ave Maria as a cello solo. Bob Coit led
the meeting in prayer.

Dr. Sweets took the phrase “the Communion of the Holy Ghost,” found in II Corinthians XIII:14, as the subject of
his talk. The nearest equivalent to the word communion in our everyday speech, according to the speaker, is partnership. We
may examine this phrase for years and not come to know its full meaning. The more experience we have with
this communion, the more it will come to mean to us.

“In these modern times of social, political, and moral upheaval,” said Dr. Sweets, “youth does not want to enshrine a
force or a master in its heart, it needs instead a friend and companion.” If we will enter into communion
with God, He will become our partner, silent but active. In the business world there are many jobs which an
individual cannot perform, but which can be handled very well by a partnership. So it is with the problems of
life. God is infinite in power. With Him as partner we may share in His omnipotence. We may fail in
many things, but by looking to Him and relying on His help we will succeed in the end.

The Bible is God’s method of making Himself known to us. He made the Bible and He can best reveal
to us the meaning of its pages. If we will open our hearts and study this Book we will come
to feel Him always at our side ready to help in any problem. What the power of God can accomplish
in partnership with man is well exemplified by the life and work of Dwight L. Moody. Moody spent his life
going throughout all the countries of the world, and with God’s help he established many churches, seminaries, libraries, and schools
which stand as a monument to his life of service. God wants everybody to give themselves to Him in that
way. If we will accept God as our partner, He will remove all fear from our lives. We will be
able to go through every day knowing that we have an infinite power on which we can rely.

At the conclusion of his talk, Dr. Sweets dismissed the meeting with the benediction.

#### International Club Will Convene Here This Fall

The International Relations Club will convene here at Davidson this fall. Several speakers of note will be included in the
program, which will be varied, and which promises great entertainment for those present. About two hundred delegates are expected to
attend this year, and the college will do all it can to provide entertainment for them. These delegates will come
from all over the South, and the club hopes that this will be a great asset for the school. Members
state that the club's purpose is to create an interest in international affairs and relations. This is considered one of
the finest college organizations in existence in the country.

Prospective members will be sent bids. They will then write articles on the subject of international relations, and those having
the best articles will be accepted. This organization is run much on the same principle as fraternities. The bids will
be sent out sometime next week. The time set for the first meeting is sometime next week, and is in
the Fraternity council schedule.

#### Dr. G. B. Watts Speaks At Book Club Meeting

At a meeting of the Bessie Dewey Book Club of Charlotte held October 19th at the home of Mrs. W.
L. Burroughs on Brandon Road, Dr. George B. Watts of the Davidson faculty was the speaker. His subject was “The
Beginnings of French Literature.” Dr. Watts gave an interesting resume of the early French works and stated that the early
French plays were given in the churches by the priests. His lecture included “The Song of Roland,” “The Aucassin and
Nicolette,” and a short sketch of the life of Francois Villon. Mrs. Watts was also a guest of the club.

#### East Dormitory Comes To Fore In Orderliness

“East Dormitory ranks at the top in orderliness,” was the statement of Mrs. N. T. Smith, supervisor of dormitories and
friend of Davidson's great body of roomers. For some time there was a prevalent opinion among the students and among
the parents of the students that old East was an undesirable place to room. In other years several unfortunate circumstances
occurred which placed East in a bad light. Although these unhappy events were in each case given an immediate remedy,
a pall continued to hang over the dormitory’s name. Mrs. Smith's statement enables East to take a position of honor
on the Davidson campus. Mrs. Smith added that as usual Davidson has a fine group of boys and that so
far there has been very little trouble.

#### Grier Martin Receives Old Annuals For Files

In response to a request for old annuals made in the last issue of the Alumni Journal, Grier Martin, the
alumni secretary, has received ten old issues. These are wanted to make a complete file for reference use by the
alumni. The office is also trying to make a file of pictures of all football teams that have represented the
college.

In addition to the complete file of annuals since the year 1923, the Alumni Secretary has secured annuals for the
years 1898, 1903, 1905, 1913, 1914, 1915, 1916, 1917, 1918, and 1920. Grier Martin stated that the Alumni Office would
appreciate any other old annuals the owners would donate.Alumni of the Delta chapter who visited the hill last week were:
Lee Vanstory, Greensboro, and Mr. Donald McQueen and wife from Dillon, S.C.

F.E.R.A. Work Now Employs Students
One Hundred and Sixteen Students Now In Government Employment

Professor Fleagle states that it is a remarkable and noteworthy fact that since the opening of school up until last
Tuesday all men who have applied and qualified for FERA work have been given at least part-time jobs. The number
of these students is one hundred and sixteen, although a few of these men were not able to work at
the time they were called upon because of football. Nevertheless, the greater majority of these men have already felt the
aid of the FERA and the others will benefit by this aid at the end of the football season.

During the month of September, there was a payroll of seven hundred dollars for the work done in the three
weeks of September that the school was able to employ student labor. The amount for the month of October will
be a great deal larger although it will not reach the maximum of one thousand and ninety-five dollars that the
government allows this school. The men employed by the FERA are occupied in twelve projects, among them being: Working in
both the general library, the Chemistry and Physics libraries, and also in the Sunday School library; supplementing janitor service in
college buildings, in Davidson High School, and Cornelius High School. A number of students are assisting the faculty members in
the grading of papers and in the laboratory work. Some of the men are employed doing clerical work in Mr.
Jackson's office, Mr. Williams’ office, and in Mr. Grier Martin’s office, also in the office of the Y.M.C.A.

The largest group is employed in keeping the tennis courts, the golf course, and the stadium clean and in good
shape. After the janitors leave in the afternoon, it is the work of one of the groups to keep a
fire in the boilers to provide hot water for the buildings. There is a group available to make any electrical
repairs that may be needed in the dormitories. Some of the students earn their paychecks by assisting in R.O.T.C. and
music; also several men are painting the military equipment.

Dr. J.W. MacConnell Is Honored By State Appointment

Dr. J.W. MacConnell, the college physician, has recently had the distinction and honor of being commissioned as a member of
the Consulting Surgical Service at the North Carolina State Hospital in Morganton. This appointment was extended to him by Governor
Ehringhaus, but the job is not new to him as he held the same office under Governor Cameron Morrison. Dr.
MacConnell, who also holds a position on the Executive Committee of the National Federation of Medical Boards in addition to
this recent appointment, is recognized as one of the foremost physicians in the State.

John Foster, John Creech, and “Cokey” Preston, members of the Senior class, were initiated into the chapter last Thursday night.

Pi Kappa Alpha: The following are prominent alumni who visited the Beta chapter during the past week: G.S. Sherrod, Wilson;
Fred Slane, Statesville; Charles Little, Charlotte; and R.W. Morrow, High Point.

Phi Delta Theta: The members enjoyed having Julian West from Barium Springs, and John Lafferty from Rome, Ga., as guests
for the Duke game.

The Body Student is cordially invited to meet with their parents and friends at the Social Center after each game
for refreshments. The Social Center is nicely equipped with many new additions including a new radio and a great deal
of new furniture. Each year, the Y.M.C.A. secures for the fall services some very interesting and helpful member of the
Presbytery. This year the Y.M.C.A. has been fortunate enough to secure Dr. Belk for the services. These services are to
last from October 28 through 31st. Students are invited to interview Dr. Belk about any problems they see fit.
