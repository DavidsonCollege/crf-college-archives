DR. McGEACHY SPEAKS AT Y. M. C. A. MEETING

Dr. A. A. McGeachy, of Charlotte, spoke at the Y. M. C. A. meeting last Thursday, his subject being “The
Tower of Babel.” The life here in college was shown to be a preparation for the life hereafter. Ideas and
impressions made now will be retained throughout the rest of the livelier career. Everyone ought to live for the common
good instead of for selfish ends. Instead of working merely for self, one should be more useful. The greatest problem
today is building moral architecture. When the ancients tried...To build the ‘Tower of Babel they failed because they did not
have the proper material. This is a warning that it is impossible to build something imperishable out of something perishable.
Something that will last cannot be built of brick and slime. Stone is needed for such building. The permanency of
what is built depends on what is put into it. Good character is one of the essentials in building up
something that will last. Christ, in choosing His Disciples, chose those that He knew were stone. One of the main
reasons that the old Tower of Babel was not finished was on account of the confounding of languages. It is
the same way today. People should understand each other better. Words will not tell the truth. Something is needed so
that each one will be understood by the other. Work is better understood than words. Working for self crowds out
working for others. More moral enthusiasm is needed. A man will never build anything unless he loses himself in helping
others. The old Tower of Babel was not finished because the builders were not building for the right purpose, and
the people of today will not succeed unless they build on Calvary and in the name of Jesus Christ.

At the Y. M. C. A. meeting tomorrow night at 7 o'clock, the speaker will be Rev. Mr. Erwin, pastor
of the local Methodist church. This will be the first time that Mr. Erwin has addressed the students, and all
of the members of the Student Body are requested and urged to be present.

Ready-to-Wear Always the Same Price $15. Aside from the price feature, which is of course, our strongest bid for your
patronage, the ability to clothe young men—and particularly college men—with the style Suits and Overcoats they revel in, is the
most appealing attribute of this shop. We know what the young fellows like to wear, we know their tastes—their ideas
of style—and we know what hard service their clothes are usually put to. Our prices are the same, year in
and year out, and in addition to the style and service obtained in these clothes, you have the satisfaction of
saving, at least, a five dollar bill on every purchase. We solicit the patronage of the boys of Davidson College,
and promise in return more than value received.
