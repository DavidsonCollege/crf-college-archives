**“Scales” By JOHN EARLES**

Things with scales have been entering Chambers Building--but not the kind of scales used by the science departments. Over the past few weeks, several snakes have found their way into Chambers, only to discover that the only way out is in a Hefty bag.

The first snake was found by custodian Gordie Eddy in the south basement. After recognizing the creature as a copperhead, Eddy beat the animal until it died. Despite Eddy’s speedy discovery and removal of the snake, workers in the mailing room and language lab have remained concerned. Sharon Broome, Central Services assistant, expressed the general sentiment when she admitted, “There just wasn’t room enough for me and the snakes.”

For science majors taking the MCATs, the presence of a snake in the Gallery served as a welcome tension breaker. The reptile was discovered during one of several ten-minute test breaks and quickly became the center of attention. “The snake appeared to be a copperhead,” said senior Lara Glenn, “and was in a position as if he were going to strike.” For several minutes, the snake remained relatively motionless and allowed itself to be observed by a group of amused science majors as others called for campus security.

Upon the arrival of Public Safety Director Jackie Hughes, the snake remained passive. In the time that elapsed before his end, the snake seemed to accept his fate in the realization that he would be no match for the sole of Hughes’ boot. With some tensions released, the students were finally able to return to their testing.

Only three days later, a small snake was discovered in the third-floor classroom of President John Kuykendall. The snake was noticed in a desk near the back of the room at the beginning of class. On examination, Junior Mark Wainright deduced that the snake was non-poisonous and could be removed easily. “I put my notebook in front of it to distract it,” he said, “and then grabbed it by the back of the head.” Students briefly debated whether the snake should be dropped out the window or taken downstairs and released. For the snake, the final decision was unfavorable. On Kuykendall’s request to aim for the bushes, the snake was tossed out the window.

One explanation for the snakes' appearance can be due to the construction of the Baker Sports Complex. This construction has likely displaced many snakes which now seek shelter from the increasingly cold nights. As recent events demonstrate, however, Chambers Building is not a place where they will feel welcome.

This snake thought that it could escape notice in one of Chambers' classrooms, but the studious reptile was not so lucky. The trespasser met its end rather quickly, as did other visiting snakes two weeks ago. Photo by Frank Gibbes.

**“I always tell my parents I’m doing well in my classes,” and other lies we tell our parents By LIZ DAVIDSON**

Whenever Rachel Epps’s parents call her on a Friday or Saturday night, they are greeted with their daughter’s friendly recording: “Hi, Mom and Dad. I’m at the library now.” Actually, Rachel is probably studying. However, she is more than likely not studying anything academic. Still, her parents are comforted by the message, leaving me to wonder what other lies do we tell our parents?

The most universal lie is in response to the question “What are you doing?” And the answer? "I'm studying.” Often, there is the sound of beer cans opening, loud music, and drunken laughter in the background. Still, the lie is pulled off with relative ease. After all, most of us got here because we studied. It isn’t an entirely new concept to our parents.

“I always tell my parents I’m doing well in my classes,” said Barclay Cunningham. “That follows pretty naturally after the initial ‘I’m studying.’ Then the lies get more specific from there. Like, ‘I don’t let boys into my room,’ and ‘The parties here are fun, but no one drinks, especially not me.’”

The girls on First Rich have the lies down to a simple system. “When your roommate's parents call and your roommate isn’t there, you tell them she’s at the...library,” Mandy Aycock stated, recalling a time when her parents called and were overjoyed to hear that she was “studying.” Lies also vary depending on parents. Phrases such as “I’m getting enough sleep,” and “I eat breakfast every day” slip out with ease, along with my favorites: “My room’s not a mess,” and “My life is organized.” It all depends upon what they want to hear. We are artists before we are scholars, creating a fantasy world of our parents’ dreams.

Thoughts of May bring senior panic
By LUISE WEINRICH

I got the idea for this article from three of my friends. We have been discussing our fears and hopes for the future, and all of us admit to having little or no idea of what is ahead of us. Where will we be on May 14? How will we survive? What about graduate school? (All this pressure on top of the normal Davidson stress!). We stayed up talking about it very late for several nights, and then my friends came up with a plan. They decided to try out some of the careers and lifestyles they are considering to see how it feels to be a lawyer or a musician or an art teacher. They did this in an efficient, simple, and inexpensive way: they wrote the name of their considered occupation on a sheet of paper and posted it over their beds. Every morning they looked at the paper and imagined that they were what the sheet said. They dressed as a lawyer would dress, or walked as a musician might walk, or spoke as a professor might speak. This approach did seem to give them some insight into their potential professions.

The “lawyer” couldn’t stand to think of having to behave as a lawyer would have to behave in order to assure her clients of her competence in court. She felt that she couldn’t speak or move as spontaneously as she would like, and she hated the thought of wearing conservative clothing and dark shoes most of the time. Maybe this is a stereotypical view of what a lawyer is like, but there is a kernel of truth in it. At the least, my friend learned that a certain orientation towards others is unnatural or uncomfortable for her, and she began to realize that some titles that sound good are just not a good match for her personality.

My other friends got something different from the experiment. This approach helped one student to stop worrying and to feel as if she was making progress toward finding a career direction. For another student, the would-be art teacher, this exploration squelched her desire to teach: “I looked at how I wrote ‘art teacher’ on the paper, and I realized that I could never teach art, because I can’t draw!”

This method is just one of many ways that seniors are dealing with stress about the future. I have felt the pressure in my own life, and I was curious to find out if others thought about it as much as I do. I talked to about 15 seniors, most of whom I didn’t know before writing this article. Here is what they said:

“I think about it [the future] every day. Planning for the future is definitely blocking my ability to enjoy my senior year. I think some people are serious [about planning] and some haven't thought about it.”

“It’s terrible! It’s rotten that I think about it every day.”

“I got too stressed out about making decisions, so I decided not to make any more.”

“I think almost everyone is frightened, even if they are not admitting it, even to themselves. A big part of it is the change in the relationship with parents. We don’t want to admit it, because we've been trying to get away from them since adolescence, but it is hard to break away.”

“I’m really excited about what's gonna happen, because I don’t know what's gonna happen. It’s like being dropped off at camp for the first time; you will feel empty for a while even if there is a lot of fun stuff to do.”

“I’m thinking about it all the time, but most of the time I’m just thinking that I don’t need to think about it so much.”
