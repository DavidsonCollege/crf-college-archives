THE DAVIDSONIAN

Unbeaten Trackmen Will Meet Davidson Goes To Raleigh Saturday With Perfect Dual Record

In their last dual meet of the year, the Wildcat track squad journeys to Raleigh Saturday to engage North Carolina State College. It will be the outstanding meet of the year for the Davidsons, taking on added importance since a victory Saturday will give the Cats an undefeated season.

Evenly Matched

The event will be very evenly matched, although star performer Mike Andrews is gone from the team that the strong Davidson squad decisively defeated last year. The Terrors will put a strong team on the field. Outstanding in the field events for State is Trent Ham, who tosses the discus and shot and also high jumps. J.C. Jones is a speedster in the high and low hurdles.

Distance Runs

State’s greatest weakness is in the distance runs, and it is in this department that the 'Cats hope to rack up the deciding points. On Tuesday of last week on Richardson field, the cindermen overran a mediocre team from Presbyterian College by 98 to 38. It was their fourth straight victory. The Cats took first in all events, both field and track, except the high jump. Walker Jed, a somewhat horizontal bar at an even six feet for his team’s only first. The Blue Stockings were weakened by the absence of Aiken, their top performer, and of several crew students, who have been representing the school.

Lacy Brothers

In this week’s meet Davidson will count heavily on the Lacy brothers, Ben Washburn, George Peters, and Arthur Pendleton, who have accounted for most of the points to date, to bring home the bacon. If successful Saturday, the trackmen will be Davidson’s only undefeated team of the year.

N.C. State Defeats ’Cats

Davidson Loses 10-7 Showing Best Offensive

Showing their greatest offensive strength to date, the Wildcat baseball team failed to stem a Furman rally in the sixth and came out on the short end of a 10 to 7 score on Richardson Field Saturday.

Big Inning

Davidson had a big inning in the fourth, pushing across four runs to go ahead 6 to 3. These tallies came as a result of singles by Grosse and Peters, Maloney’s two-bagger, a base-on-balls, and an error. This lead was short-lived, as Furman racked up four of their own runs in the sixth and never headed up again. McDaniel took over the mound duties for the Hurricane in the fifth and held the Cats scoreless until a ninth inning rally gave them one run.

Neisler Throws

Paul Neisler pitched the game for Davidson, but was pounded for sixteen hits. Dewey Schuyler led Furman with four safeties, while Proctor of gridiron fame had three for five. For Davidson, Frederick, Grosse, Peters, Maloney, Phillips, and Major each hit safely once. Loughridge and Graves each connected for two base blows.

Pre-Flight Wins

In another home game on Wednesday of last week, the Cats dropped their second encounter of the season to the North Carolina Pre-Flight school, 8-5. After holding a 5-3 lead at one point in the game, Davidson faltered again in the stretch, and a four-run splurge in the ninth provided the margin of victory for the Cloudbursters. Davidson has one more game set at press time, which had not been definitely scheduled.

Fijis Slim First

Rallying behind the pitching of Jake Alexander, the surprise Phi Gam softball team held a slim first place in the deciding cup race when the scores were tabulated Monday. The Fiji average was three wins to no defeats, after they had met the S.P.E.’s; the Phi Deltas, who forfeited.

The S.A.E.’s with a 3 to 1 ratio held a precarious second berth, having lost to the K.A. team and having won from the Beta, Phi Delt, and S.P.E. teams.

Four Tie

Four teams were knotted for third place with two victories and one loss apiece: the Kappa Sigs, Pi K.A.’s, Phi Kappa Sigs, and Betas. The Kappa Sigs, who held first ranking by virtue of wins over the strong Pi Kap team and the Pika aggregation, were ousted in a rout by the Betas. The Betas also won over the Phi Delts but lost the opening game to the S.A.E.’s. The K.A.’s succeeded in clipping the second place S.A.E. crowd.and the weakened Pika team but fell before the fast pitching of Jack Wayman and his skillful Pi Kappa Phi mates. This team also defeated the Pikas but were nosed out in one of the closest contests of the series by the Kappa Sigma team.

Three Low Teams

In the loop cellar with three losses each were the Sigma Phi Epsilon, Phi Delta Theta, and Pi Kappa Alpha teams. With the series less than half completed and with some of the crucial games to be played this week, Monday's standings did not appear to be decisive, since, for example, the league leaders had met only the three basement dwellers of the circuit.

Hold Tennis Team Seeks Initial Win On Road
Squad Meets Richmond and William and Mary

Davidson’s tennis team, still seeking their first win of the season, are on their last road trip this week, meeting the University of Richmond in Richmond today and traveling over to Williamsburg for a match with William and Mary on Friday.

Down east last week, the Cats suffered defeat again at the hands of Duke and Carolina, going down in both encounters by the score of 7-0. The Cats were completely outclassed by the Blue Devils, but gave the Tar Heels a much stiffer match than indicated by the score.

Georgia Tech

On the local courts last Saturday, the Nettlers were nosed out by the Engineers of Georgia Tech, 4-3. Davidson dropped four out of five of the singles matches to the Yellow Jackets, but came through in both the doubles events. Feature match of the afternoon for the Wildcats was Captain Sutton's hard-won victory over Maddox of Tech. Maddox was favored to take the match in straight sets. Craig Schmidt came close to providing the winning point for Davidson in his singles match with McCall. Schmidt, playing for two full hours, took the first set 10-8 and forced his opponent to the limit in dropping the last two sets.

Summary:
Singles:
Abell (Tech) defeated Byrd, 6-4, 6-1
Sutton (Davidson) defeated Maddox, 2-6, 6-4, 8-6
