Question Phi Society
Week Has Meeting | Revision of Constitution Discussed; Repeal of By-Laws Probable

The members of the Philanthropic Literary Society attended a meeting held Tuesday night. The meeting was called to discuss the question: “What would you think of the Red and Black if Scott and others were to write it?” The members discussed the revision of the constitution and the probable repeal of by-laws. The by-laws are comparatively simple and more adaptable to present needs. Definite decisions will be made at a future meeting.

Initiate New Men

Another event of the evening was the initiation of the new members. A committee headed by John Horton recommended to the members of the hall prospects for new members and sent bids to the newcomers. The new members are the following: Chrisman, George Coates, James Ewart, Harold Harkey, Frank Hulen, Bob Ley, Ralph Monger, Reid Patterson, John Simms, Marion Bryant, Ogburn Whisnant, and Ivan Wetmore. They underwent a short ritual-pledge.

Sunday Class Hears Boggs

Y. M. C. A. Secretary Gives Talk on “Pride”

Wade Boggs, Y. M. C. A. secretary, made the best talk that has been heard in the last four years before the Sunday School Class, according to the enthusiastic reports of its members. Taking I Timothy, 3:6 as the theme of his text, Wade made it clear to the students that “Pride” was the deadliest of the seven sins. He supplemented his original text with several other passages of scripture, proving beyond a doubt that pride is condemned. The devil tried to incite the pride of Adam and Eve, leading to their condemnation. Similarly, our own pride, whether in a scholastic, physical, intellectual, or fraternal sense, can lead to sin in everyday campus life.

Pfohl Announces Novel Plans For Homecoming

Lyon Speaks To Freshmen

Largest Pep Meeting Followed By Free Show

One of the largest pep meetings of the year heated up the Davidson spirit in preparation for the Homecoming game. A feature of the meet was a talk by Dr. Scott Lyon, science professor, who extolled the way the “Wildcats” never give up until the game is over. Freshmen and a large group of upperclassmen, under the direction of Elmore Holt and his yelling assistants, cheered the team. A climax to the meet in the gym was the announcement of a free show to be given to the students at the end of the pep meeting. Dr. Lyon, in his talk, told the boys that one great thing about the Davidson team was that they did not stop playing until the final whistle had blown. His last illustration, of a mountain lioness who achieved under great difficulties, brought down the house. Freshmen turned out at the conclusion of the meeting for a short shirt-tail parade to the front of the campus, ending with a night yell and “Oh Davidson.” At nine o'clock, the students gathered again to attend the free movie.

Band Composed Entirely of Bandmasters to Be Special Feature

In connection with the plans for Homecoming, there will be three bands at the Davidson-University of North Carolina football game here Saturday. James Christian Pfohl, Director of Music at Davidson College, announced that in addition to the Davidson College Band, there will be the Lenoir High School Band, representing the University of North Carolina, and a band composed of the bandmasters of North and South Carolina. The latter band should prove of great interest, Pfohl stated, since it is the first time an organization of this type has been attempted in the South. The members of this group will wear their individual uniforms and will play the instruments they are most familiar with. Archibald Graham, director of the Berryhill High School Band and formerly drum major at the University of Oklahoma, will be drum major of the novel group. The Davidson Band will have spats and gloves added to their uniforms. Many new arrangements and effects are being planned for the game.

Paintings: Are Received Here

Dr. Lyon Obtains Reproductions From Rochester For Laboratory

Three of a new series of optical history paintings have just been received from the Bausch & Lomb Optical Co., Rochester, N. Y., which commissioned the distinguished New York artist, Harold Anderson, to reproduce on canvas such scientific characters in history as Alhazen, the Moor; the Dutchman, Huygens; and the Bavarian, Fraunhofer. According to Dr. Scott Lyon, professor of Biology, who obtained these reproductions, they will be hung in the laboratory for the inspection of science students. Richly colored, the picture of Alhazen, who was born in 965 A. D., shows this Arabian mathematician demonstrating to some friends his theory of the refraction of light by means of a stick thrust into a basin of water. No less interesting is the painting of Christian Huygens, in which the Dutch astronomer and physicist explains to Louis XIV and members of the French Academy his wave theory of light. Fraunhofer is represented as an enthusiastic young man explaining to a skeptical friend his method of reading and measuring the dark lines in the solar spectrum.

Ivey's Sponsors Broadcasts

Ivey's “One of the South's Great Stores” is broadcasting all the home games played by the Davidson Wildcats over radio station WSOC. Paul Norris and Joe McLeskey announce the games, and Lloyd Ranson, representing Ivey's, talks during the half about the fashions seen at the game. Ivey's has sponsored the broadcasts.Cities of the part in the festivities of Winthrop-Newell and Sprunt. Helen Burch, Marion Kuhn, Giggie Davidson day. Among those squiring the young ladies about were Brothers Calvin, McGarity, Pratt, Preyer, Lauck, Dunford, Hines, Williford, and Alice Wright Murphy. Mr. and Mrs. Turner of Pink spectrum by means of a spectroscope, an instrument of his invention casts of the Erskine, Duke, and Furman games, and plans have been made for the broadcast of the Carolina and Wake Forest games later in the season. These pictures depicting optical progress and the advance of science through the ages were conceived by Bausch & Lomb as a pictorial record to focus the mind of the student on characters and contributions of great significance to the human race. The broadcasts are kept as free of commercial announcements as possible in order to ensure the greatest amount of football reporting for the listeners.

Gilmer went to Marion to visit relatives. Don Bailey, alumnus of the chapter, was a guest for the weekend. Pledge Brothers Holland and Oglesby to Be Initiated Into Club. The Eumeanean Literary Society held its meeting Monday night in Phi Hall due to repairs being made on Eu Hall. The obliging invitation of Henry Harkey to use Phi Hall was gratefully accepted. The main event of the program of the evening was the presentation of papers prepared and read by applicants for membership. So far, two men have been passed on and bids sent to them earlier in the month. These were Stuart Oglesby and Jack Holland. At a later meeting, they will be initiated with the rituals of the ceremony. Another item of the evening was an Oxford-type debate, held for the purpose: Is the best we could get for the purpose? Answering his own question, he brought out the fact that the main device by which the devil keeps mankind from salvation is by stirring up his pride. Men are not willing to humble themselves and admit that their own efforts to save themselves are not sufficient. Every member of the class enjoyed his talk, and more like them are on the program for the ensuing year. Let's all attend!

Gift from Bausch & Lomb. In the scientific bureau of Bausch & Lomb, the discoveries and laws of science are applied daily to a host of problems in every scientific field. Whether it be a centrifuge spinning cells at enormous speeds so that biologists may study the effects of gravity, or a new ophthalmic lens designed to aid the vision of those in whose eyes the human lens has lost its youthful elasticity, or a spectrograph whose sensitive optics separate the spectrum lines to detect minute impurities in metals. All of these developments, involving the latest scientific instruments, depend upon the accumulated scientific knowledge through the ages. They are built not only on the accomplishments of modern scientists but also on those of Alhazen, Fraunhofer, Huygens, and other great optical pioneers.
