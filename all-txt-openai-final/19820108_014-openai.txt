The Polish Crisis: Three Statements

The following statement is from the Strike Committee of the Szczecin port and shipyard in Szczecin, Poland. December 14, 1981

To all nations and people of good will who value the cause of democracy, freedom, and workers’ rights:

At the risk of their lives and personal freedom, despite the Draconian orders of martial law, despite the attempt to
fetter us with fear, hundreds of thousands of Polish workers and patriots went on strike, voicing the following demands:
--that the declaration of a state of war be revoked;
--that all those arrested be freed;
--that all democratic and union rights won by the nation in August be restored.

We appeal to you: Support us in our struggle with mass protests. Support us with moral aid. Do not stand
idly by while democracy in the heart of Europe is in danger of being stifled at birth. Be with us
in these difficult moments. Solidarity with Solidarity. Poland has not yet perished.

To the Editors:

At midnight on December 13, 1981, the Polish army and police raided the offices of the independent trade union “Solidarity”;
thousands, perhaps tens of thousands of people were arrested in their homes. The prime minister, minister of defense, and first
Secretary of the Polish Communist Party in one person, General Jaruzelski, declared martial law. Polish society, whose overwhelming support Solidarity
has its strength, has exercised tremendous restraint in the face of countless acts of provocation on the part of the
government. In the course of sixteen months of existence, Solidarity has committed no illegal acts; it has rigorously respected the
Polish constitution and all forms of political life accepted in civilized societies. Each and every voice from Solidarity, even if
termed “radical” by the Communist party or the Western press, has been no more than the exercise of the right
of all citizens to freedom of expression.

The Polish government has violated the rights of all citizens to freedom of expression. The Soviet Union has been intervening
in Polish internal affairs since 1944. The junta of General Jaruzelski, by linking the arrests of Solidarity members to those
of former party officials, is clearly attempting to blame Solidarity for the thirty-six years of indolent and devastating communist rule
which have brought Poland to economic collapse. The strikes called by Solidarity have resulted in the loss of one day’s
work in sixteen months; the losses due to mismanagement and lack of supplies have resulted in the loss of over
twenty days of work. We appeal to every democratic government, and to all those who believe in the Polish people’s
right to basic freedoms, immediately to halt all transactions, economic and other, with Poland, until every member of Solidarity is
freed.

To the Editors:

On the night of December 12, the Polish authorities decided to declare Solidarity illegal--this means they decided to declare society
illegal. When we signed the Gdansk Accords at the end of September 1980, it was in the hope that from
this moment the method of government in Poland would change, that the process of economic collapse would be stopped, and
that society would regain its voice. Our hopes were misguided. In the course of sixteen months, out of twenty-one points
of accord, only three have been realized. During this time negotiations took place concerning both minor matters, e.g., economic reform.
None of these accords were realized. For sixteen months the government was on strike. The Polish authorities took no action
whatsoever toward strengthening the economy; instead, they blamed Solidarity for thirty-six years of indolent and devastating communist rule.Here is the

and ‘incompetent economic management.’ For thirteen months we waited for the enactment of the law on censorship; for twelve months
we waited for the law needed for negotiations concerning trade unions. We have now been waiting sixteen months.

In the course of the past months, the government has been trying to undermine the fundamental right won by working
people in August 1981—the right to strike. “Solidarity” has no access to the media, which are controlled by the communist
regime. In an atmosphere of endless attacks and insults from the authorities, the strike, the political strike, was the sole
remaining weapon. (In 1981, strikes took up little more than one working day.) It is hardly surprising that Polish society
has no confidence in the government. Since none of our accords, hopes, or expectations have been realized, we have with
increasing frequency had to demand structural changes in the system of government. At the end of last week, these demands
led to a call for a national referendum on the degree of confidence on the part of the people in
the existing government.

It must be stressed that neither Solidarity nor any of the dissident organizations in Poland have ever issued any statements
concerning the Warsaw Pact or the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance. The current conditions have involved us in countless provocations.
Some examples: the October 1980 crisis provoked by the trade union; the March 1981 assault on Solidarity representatives during their
visit to the national council in Bydgoszcz, where they had been invited for talks; the November 1981 incident in Silesia,
where so-called “unknown agents” scattered containers of poisonous gas—seventy workers were subsequently hospitalized. There is no lack of examples. The
current attack is yet another attempt to stifle Solidarity and deprive Polish society of the limited freedom which it fought
for and won in August 1980.

I appeal to you: do not allow Poland to be crushed by totalitarian Soviet imperialism. Send letters and telegrams to
the White House demanding that the American government exert economic and political pressure on the Soviet Union. Demand that the
UN call on a committee of observers to investigate violations of human rights in Poland. Since the Polish government has
ratified human rights pacts that General Jaruzelski’s junta has now repudiated, the crisis is not merely an internal affair.
