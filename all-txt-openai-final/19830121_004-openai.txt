**Presidential Search Consultants Meet Students**

By JEFFREY MANN

The faculty and SGA are currently selecting the advisory committees that will help the Board of Trustees in choosing a new president to replace Sam Spencer, who plans to retire on 1 July 1983. SGA signups for interested students end today at 2:00 at the Union desk. SGA President Tim Johnston, Vice-president Boe Young, Chancellor Mark Oldenburg, Senator Burt Taylor, and senior class President Sherburne Laughlin will interview the candidates before selecting the five-member committee by next Friday, 28 January, Johnston said.

Johnston said the exact role of the committee in relation to the Trustee committee, which will make the final decision, is not yet defined. “The Trustees did say that the job will involve a lot of work, a lot of time, and a really definite commitment as well as confidentiality,” he said.

Nominations for the faculty advisory committee will close today with balloting next week. In accordance with the Faculty By-laws, the Professional Affairs Committee nominated ten candidates for the five positions. Additional candidates can be placed on the ballot if nominated by five faculty members.

“My anticipation is that the faculty committee will be involved all the way through; reading dossiers, interviewing candidates, and making the final nomination. That’s the way it was done before [in 1968 when Pres. Spencer was selected] and I hope it will again,” said Vice-chairman of the Faculty David Kaylor.

Chairman of the Board of Trustees Fred Stair could not be reached for comment about the Trustee Search Committee. Dr. Stair has not yet announced the members of the committee.

Drs. Frederick Ness and Ronald Stead of the Presidential Search Consultation Service held an open meeting with students on Wednesday. A letter from Board of Trustees Chairman Fred Stair described the PSCS as a “non-profit consulting group... to assist us at the beginning of our search for a new president.” He added that the group is “not here to identify or select the final candidates for us, but rather to help assure that the selection process is handled with the greatest effectiveness.”

Comments at the open meeting echoed concerns at the Trustees’ open meeting on Friday, 7 January. Students and faculty raised, among others, the issues of the role of the president as a fundraiser as opposed to a campus leader, women and minorities at Davidson, and the requirement that the president be a Presbyterian.

**Pritchard Attains Culinary Fame**

By CARL HOBSON ’86

Davidson’s culinary delights made the big-time last month as the Associated Press spread the tale of Carl Pritchard’s “Garbage Burger,” which topped the “most delicious” column of a Washington and Lee University poll. Washington and Lee’s news department took advantage of the Food Service Director’s Convention to poll incoming delegates about what students were eating, and not eating. Davidson's delegates promptly told of Director Carleton Pritchard's ground-beef brainstorm.the “garbage burger.” Mr. Pritchard says he and the staff just made it up of about everything: hamburger, bacon bits, pickles, onions, mushrooms, olives, tomatoes, and cheese. Unfortunately, the concoction, basically “a mixture of McDonald's, Wendy's, and the backyard grill,” said Pritchard, didn’t hit it off with the students. “We’ve had to put it together right in front of them and it didn’t look too appetizing.”

Washington and Lee Food Service Director Jerry Darrell attributed the “garbage burger’s” instant notoriety to its name. “I just can’t see students getting excited about something called a ‘garbage burger’ - it immediately grabbed the attention of the delegates.” It also grabbed the attention of the Associated Press. The Washington Post, New York Times, and the Charlotte Observer all carried stories about the garbage burger. Pritchard even heard from a couple of radio stations, one of which, WUTQ Country AM of Utica, asked Mr. Pritchard if he would send them a sample for a live taste test.

Jacob’s Ladder

“Jacob’s Ladder,” a seven-foot tall welded steel work by the late Charleston, South Carolina sculptor Willard Hirsch, will be dedicated at 4:45 p.m. this Monday in Vail Commons at Davidson College. The sculpture, which depicts the ascending and descending angels of Jacob’s dream as told in Genesis 28:10-29, is a gift of Mr. and Mrs. James D. Vail III of Lake Forest, Ill., for whose family Vail Commons is named. It will occupy a space on the north side of the building, on a landing between the first and second floors.

Hirsch was born in Charleston in 1905 and attended the College of Charleston. He went to New York as a young man and studied at the School of the National Academy of Design and the Beaux Arts Institute in the early 1930s. Many of Hirsch’s works have found their way into gallery and museum collections, private homes, and gardens. One of them was selected to represent South Carolina in IBM’s collection, Sculpture of the Western Hemisphere.

Vail is executive director of training for American Hospital Supply Corp. in Lake Forest, and serves on the Davidson College Board of Trustees. Two of his sons have attended Davidson.

Ammar to lead Y-Corps

By TIM MCGAUGHEY ’85

Newly elected Y-Student Service Corps president Doug Ammar ‘84 hopes to increase the communication among Y members, town leaders, and all Davidson students. Ammar wants the Y to be a conduit “for exchange of college resources and town needs.” The Y has planned a retreat to Bondarken Camp in Flat Rock, North Carolina this weekend. Ammar sees this trip as a way to establish communication with the first of his three groups: Y-Corp members. Treasurer Chris Blake believes that this trip will “give members a goal for the organization.”

In order to communicate better with its second target, the town of Davidson, Y leaders met on Thursday, 6 January with town leaders. Community liaison Pete Skillern ’85 wants students to be “aware of the needs of the community.”
