Antigone

Continued from page 10

a very vital part in this production as they add much to the storyline as well as provide most of
the music and dance.

Three international students are in the cast: Christina Lopez-Ibanez from Guatemala, Constanza Jaramillo from Colombia, and Katharina Altpeter from Germany.
Additionally, two younger chorus members are from the Davidson community and add variation to the chorus. Elizabeth Thornberry is a
student at Davidson Elementary School, and Tate Gardner is in eighth grade and is the son of Dr. Joe Gardner,
faculty member.

In order to view this production of Antigone which promises to be most interesting and filled with multi-talented actors, come
to any of the following nights of performance: February 20-22 and 27-29. All shows begin at 8:00 p.m., and the
location is Hodson Hall/Cunningham Fine Arts Center.

chart-topping song, is overwhelming. Diffie will be a strong contender for next year’s Horizon award; he has many big songs
already. I might not rank him here on personal preference, but his popularity and talent justify his receiving this “honor”.

10. Ronnie Milsap -- An odd choice to round out the top ten, but after almost 40 number ones, Milsap
is still going strong. His live performances are among the best I’ve ever seen (in any format of music). He
still makes great music, and he still sells records. He deserves to be recognized for his many contributions to the
field.

So, there we have it. What about Lionel Cartwright, Mark Chesnutt, and all the others? Well, take your pick; the
number of strong male performers vying for the top spot is ever-growing. It’s really hard to go wrong with many
of them; but, as I see it, these are ten of the biggest around today.

LOVE SECRET 49

WHAT DOES LOVE FEEL LIKE?

FOR THE NEW LOVER, PASSION OVERWHELMS ALL RATIONAL THOUGHT.

OBSESSIVE CONTEMPLATION OF THE PERCEIVED SUPERIORITY OF THE LOVED ONE CONSUMES THE LOVER. THE LOVED ONE BECOMES A SOURCE OF
ENDLESS DELIGHT.

SUSTAINED LOVE REVERIES CAN LEAD TO OPTIMISTIC CONCLUSIONS.

THE LOVERS BASK BLISSFULLY IN EACH OTHER'S REFLECTED SPLENDOR.

THE LOVERS ENTER A SECRET WORLD OF THEIR OWN.

WHEN THEY BOTHER TO CONSIDER OUTSIDERS, OUTSIDERS MAY FIND THE LOVERS’ EXUBERANT BEHAVIOR A CAUSE FOR CONCERN.

MUNDANE EVERYDAY EXPERIENCES BECOME SUFFUSED WITH THE SPECIALNESS OF THE SENSATION.

THE EXISTENCE OF OTHER LOVERS MAY FEEL SORRY FOR THEM.
