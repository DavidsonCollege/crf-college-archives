Speedboat recharges lake campus

The Davidson College Athletic Department recently purchased a new motorboat for use at the lake campus. The boat, an 18-foot Competition Ski Nautique marketed by the Southeast Correct Craft, Inc. of Orlando, Fla., is intended primarily for use by P.E. classes, but will probably also receive use from the Water Ski Club and the July Experience program for high school students.

Since the creation of the lake campus in 1963, Davidson has offered sailing, canoeing, and waterskiing programs for students. The waterskiing program has centered around three boats. One has been a runabout originally purchased in 1963. The other two were sold to the college by former basketball coach Terry Holland and former lake campus director Bruce Parker.

Over the years, all three of these boats have needed repairs from time to time and a new boat was needed if the Athletic Department was to continue to offer waterskiing as a P.E. course.

The Athletic Department became acquainted with the Correct Craft Company as a result of the efforts of Kevin Taylor of the Water Ski Club. The company caters to colleges, offering them substantial discounts on the purchase. In addition, the college will return the craft each fall to the company along with $500 and receive a new boat.

Lake Campus Director Sterling Martin is optimistic that this feature of the arrangement will save money that otherwise would be spent on boat maintenance.

The Ski Nautique is considered to be one of the top brands of competition boats which will be a plus for Davidson if a competitive motorboating team is ever formed. The boat will not be available for general use by students.

The purchase of the boat is part of a larger effort by the Athletic Department to provide better waterfront facilities for college use and so that the lake campus will become more of a selling point for the college.

As part of this “rehabilitation project,” the department is working closely with Physical Plant Director Grover Meetze on the possible construction of new docking facilities.

The purchase of the Ski Nautique was financed by the sale of the three boats that were previously at the lake campus and from the Athletic Department budget.

An additional source of revenue will be a hydroplane regatta which will be held at the lake campus the last weekend in July. The Optimists Club of Charlotte has leased the lake campus for the regatta and guaranteed at least $500 to the Athletic Department which would cover next year’s payment to the Correct Craft Company.

Athletic Director Thom Cartmill is pleased with the purchase and feels that the Ski Nautique will turn out to be “a very worthwhile program for all areas of the college.”

Track teams have mixed week
Runners strive to improve season

The Davidson men’s track squad lost their first meets of the 1977 season, losing to Lynchburg 105-57 on March 19 and to Washington and Lee 81-64 on March 12.

However, despite the losses, there were some bright spots for the team.

Carl McPhail turned in outstanding performances in both meets. Against Lynchburg, McPhail won the 110m high hurdles (15.6), the triple jump (43’ 3/4”), and the 440m intermediate hurdles (57.4). Against Washington and Lee, he again won the triple jump (42’ 1 1/2”), the 440m intermediate hurdles (57.01), and the 120 yd. high hurdles (15.83).

Doug Horn was another outstanding performer in the two meets for the Wildcats. He won the 1500m run against Washington and Lee with a school record of 4:18.51 and placed second in the grueling 5000m run (16:23). In the Lynchburg meet, Horn won the 1500m run with another record time of 4:06.5 and captured the steeplechase (9:45.6).

Jarry Taylor easily won the hammer throw against Lynchburg with a toss of 122’ 3” and his younger brother, David Taylor, placed third in the discus against Washington and Lee with a throw of 128’ 4”. Coach Sterling Martin feels the younger Taylor may be Davidson’s best bet in the discus this year.

In the Washington and Lee meet, many old school records were broken: Pat Jenevein (4:35) and Sal Caporale (4:37.2) in the 1500m run; Jim Douglas (52.36) and John Stroud (53.08) in the 400m run; Greg Kunkleman (2:09.5) and Jenevein (2:12.5) in the 880m run; and Caporale (23.9) and Phillip Gilbert (23.2) in the 200m run.

Perhaps the brightest spot in the week for Davidson was the women’s track team who scored a 55-36 victory over Lynchburg.

Nancy Brown turned in a good day’s effort with first place finishes in the 1500m run (5:41.5) and the 800m run (2:44.5).

Other standouts for the women included: Kathy Wilson who captured first place in the long jump (13’ 10 1/2”); Susan Curtis who won the 100m hurdles (18.55); and Nora McNeill who won the 100 yd. dash (12.3).

Coach Sterling Martin commented on the women’s efforts: “They did an outstanding job considering the fact that their program is in its infancy and they do not have a budget to work from.”

Davidson's next meet will be against Appalachian State on March 29.
