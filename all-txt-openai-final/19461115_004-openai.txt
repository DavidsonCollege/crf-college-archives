Lamarr Williamson, president of Beta Theta Pi social fraternity, was last summer representative of the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.
to the general committee meeting of the World’s Student Christian Federation, and is a member of Sigma Upsilon. Williamson was

Plans are in the air for a dinner-dance some time before the Christmas holidays. The affair will take place in
Charlotte with a local orchestra furnishing the jive.

More seems to be a KA theater of operations. Seen at the Winthrop Autumn Ball were Brothers Dick Baster, with

However, the main trouble turned out to be, not a lack of capable linemen, but a somewhat ragged pass defense
and no pass offense. Davidson tossed a total of 10 passes, for no completions and 4 interceptions. If Story can
