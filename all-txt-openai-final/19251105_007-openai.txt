Student Body President Will Remain Out for Rest of Year Says Rumor

“Nick” Sappenfield, president of the student body, football star, and one of the most popular men on the campus, in all probability will not return to college this year on account of the injury he received in the Elon game. It will be remembered that “Nick” broke his leg in this contest and has been in a Charlotte hospital for the past seven weeks on account of this injury. While here at the game with State Saturday, “Nick” was driven to Davidson from Charlotte and watched it from the sidelines. He felt duly rewarded for his trip by the smashing victory which Davidson secured. After the game he was in the best of spirits. His leg has practically healed and he is able to walk on crutches. The plaster cast will be removed within a short time. Although it is a question as to whether “Nick” will return, it will be hard for him to resist the call of his alma mater and its fighting football team which he has so often led to victory. All in all, we predict that he will be back with us next fall.

WORLD COURT CONFERENCE

Dr. Russell presented in a concise and forceful manner an account of the growing unity of the world, portraying the distinct trend toward unity during the last 300 years, and advocating courts of arbitration and a feeling of goodwill from within as the means of preventing future wars. He gave as the bases underlying world associations: a spiritual basis, feeling from the heart; all nations democracies; and no oppressed people in the world. These three conditions he laid down as essential to world peace.

GOLF COURSE IS IN FINE SHAPE FOR THE TOURNEY

Greens and Fairways Have Been Put Into Good Condition

The Davidson golf course is now in excellent condition for the fall golf tournament which will be held soon. All the holes have been gone over, some of them changed, others added, and the length of the course has been increased 500 yards. Hole number 5 is now 538 yards long, number 6 is 450, while number 2, the old number 1, is also 450 yards in length. Par has been increased by these changes to 36. These improvements would have been made at the beginning of college, had the weather not been so dry. Dr. Arbuckle expects an unusual amount of interest to be taken in the fall tournament. Besides the advantage of being able to play on the improved course, every contestant will play with the knowledge that he has as much chance as anyone to win. A handicap will be given to everyone, so that the result will not depend so largely upon how much skill a player has, but upon how he uses that talent which he possesses. The men on the Davidson golf team will be picked by the results of this tournament. Any freshman showing ability will probably be placed on the team, for, although a freshman may not play in any Southern Conference matches, there will be many contests with neighboring clubs. The management will be selected at the same time as the team.

The afternoon session was given to open forum discussions, in which the speakers of the morning were asked questions in further explanation of their positions. Saturday evening was devoted to the work of the Student Organization, the work of this organization being presented by Mr. Veach, Field Secretary of Y. M. C. A.

The principal speaker of the Sunday session was Kirby Page, who in the morning presented the tendencies pulling apart and those tending to pull people together. Mr. Page brought to mind the increasing national interdependence of the nations, and the political tendencies toward separation, a combination of which he gave as the cause for war. He strongly urged international agencies for promoting peace and declared that war must be outlawed by the nations. During the afternoon conference, Mr. Page, after conducting a discussion of the points in regard to the World Court and other questions involved in his morning address, concluded the program with a touching plea for the real application of the principles of Jesus, which must be applied to end war. At the conclusion of his appeal, he dismissed the conference with prayer.

Miss Zupke sang "Smiling Thru," accompanying herself on the piano. She followed this by two other short songs, one of them being "Oh Katrina." John I. Smith, valedictorian of the class of '23, was on the Hill this weekend. He is in the cotton mill business with his father in Greenville, S. C. One of the features of the program was the playing on the violin by Miss Aud, who was accompanied by her sister. These were all classical Russian numbers. Her best selection was the "Song to Orpheus." Mr. and Mrs. Zupke next played two Russian dance numbers on Russian instruments which greatly resembled our banjos. The next number on the program featured Mrs. Zupke, who sang two numbers in her native tongue. The names of these numbers could not be interpreted by the reporter. As a closing number, the quartet rendered the "Stars and Stripes Forever." The whole program was very interesting indeed and enjoyed by all who attended.

There will be three more numbers presented here this year under the direction of the Piedmont Lyceum, whose headquarters are in Asheville. These programs are sponsored by the Junior Class in order that they may raise the funds to entertain the student body and their guests during "Junior Speaking."
