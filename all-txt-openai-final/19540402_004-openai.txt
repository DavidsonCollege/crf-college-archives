**SENIOR SKETCH No. 4 Finklea:**

By BILL MOFFETT

When the faithful unfolded their Daily Workers one Friday morning three weeks ago, they found on the front page a letter answering the current subscription drive. Unsigned, it read in part as follows:

“We are students in a small southern college whose policies are determined by contributions from Wall Street imperialists and reactionary religious fanatics who, under the guise of liberal education, seek to cram down our throats policies and practices of decadent American imperialism—all in the name of liberty.

“Every day we fair-minded and peace-loving youths of America are being impressed by the Pentagon puppets and Wall Street warmongers into the Army to serve as instruments of imperialistic aggression...

“Your journalistic truths are displayed only sporadically by our fascist librarian who seeks to deprive us of the true benefits of the free press.

“We hope our lone subscription has aided your valiant efforts to spread the Real Truth.”

Through outstanding work on the part of Davidsonian reporters, it was revealed today that the author of this bold letter was none other than Jack Finklea of Florence, South Carolina, presently a senior at Davidson College! When confronted with this amazing discovery by a member of the faculty’s Un-American Activities Committee, the bleary-eyed Finklea replied adamantly, “I stand behind the fifth.”

Later, in an exclusive interview, Finklea told reporters that the Workers Of The World! behind the fifth (amendment)” together from “the works of our beloved fathers in the faith, Marx and Lenin.”

“We have great hopes for the future,” he continued. “Already plans are being made for a gigantic peoples rally on May first. Comrade Crisp will deliver the special address to the cement pourers at the new dorm construction, and I will lead the Peace Parade to the library—that magnificent debris of artistic fossils—for a demonstration against the tyrannical boys on the spreading of Real Truth by our Russian brothers.”

Proudly gloating over the success of the new organization in forcing the resignation of Dean John C. Bailey, Jr., whom he referred to as “that notorious suppressor of student opinion,” Finklea indicated that bigger and better things are to be expected from Cell 69.

“Comrades, unite! We have the whole world to gain; we have only our diplomas to lose.”

**One Sport Man**

The big Kappa Sig ace is not only a tennis player, however, he was a big threat in interfraternity football last fall, and captained the all-fraternity team in basketball for the men in green. Corky will be counted on heavily during the remainder of the season and he may well be one of the top contenders when the Southern Conference tournament comes once more to the local courts in early May.

**INDO-CHINA**

should and can be made with the Communists and that American intervention is not absolutely necessary; secondly, they will assert that we cannot possibly attempt to hold the line against Communist forces all over the world, and that the security of Indochina is not so vital to us that we should send American forces to that theater.

I submit that the second argument proceeds on false premises, and I believe that any military analyst of the day would agree that Indochina is a vital position in our defenses against Communist expansion. With full position of Indochina, the Communists could easily move westward into weak Thailand, and thus menace Burma and India; and they would have a spearhead into the Southwestern Pacific area, which includes Malaya (which already is experiencing a great deal of trouble with Communist rebels), Australia, New Zealand, and the Philippines. It is difficult to see how anyone could realize that the security of this whole territory would be endangered by Communist domination and still maintain that we should not take the necessary steps to prevent it.

As for the first possible argument stated above, it should be obvious that any truce negotiated with the Communists in Indochina now would have to be on terms named almost entirely by them. The Communists know the French are getting fed up with the endless fight there; they will surely hold out for such terms as will give them what would actually amount to a victory. We should realize by now that the Communists would not stop with the domination of Indochina. Their plan calls for world domination, and every move they make is calculated to put more and more territory under Communist rule. In short, any truce in Indochina at the present would merely be a repetition of the now-despised Munich appeasement of 1938, and if we do not realize this we will be deceiving no one but ourselves.

If the Indochinese problem can be solved satisfactorily by mere U.S. financial and material aid and/or astute diplomacy, the “whole free community” will be much better off. But if intervention by U.S. troops becomes necessary to save the situation there, I do not see how we can afford not to take such a step. As Secretary Dulles said, “united action” on the part of the Allies against the Indochinese Communists “might involve serious risks. But these risks are far less than those that will face us a few years from now, if we dare not be resolute today.”

**THE DAVIDSONIAN**

**Artist Reuben Rubin Speaks Informally**

Mr. Reuben Rubin, internationally famous artist, lectured informally on painters and paintings in the College Union Ballroom at 4:00 o’clock this afternoon.

Born in Galatz, Rumania, in 1893, Mr. Rubin went to Jerusalem in 1912 to study at the Bezalel Art School. After a year there he went to Paris, continuing his studies until the First World War interrupted them. In 1918 he resumed his study of art in Cerbauti and Bucharest, taking an active part in...the Zionist movement in those cities. After this, he returned to Palestine and settled on the sand dunes of Tel Aviv. Rubin is one of the trustees of the board of the American Fund for Israel Institutions. When the new State of Israel was created, Al Neumann (left) and Perry Daniels will be on campus Sunday night with the Michigan Singers. Both are alumni of Davidson College. Mr. Rubin served as its first ambassador to Rumania. Rubin returned in 1980 to his painting and studio in Tel Aviv. During the past year, Mr. Rubin has had two one-man shows in New York. His paintings figure in numerous museums throughout the United States.

OFF-MOORINGS... (Continued From Page Two)

turn to other solutions of the problem found in a true amateur program entered into with colleges, which are genuinely homogenous. Even the Wildest Club goal of “batting 500” in football is entirely unrealistic when seen in the light of the overall athletic goal. The Southern Conference has practically no school which is comparable to us in size and composition of the student body, in academic standards, in curriculum, and finally in the amount of athletic subsidization. This leads some to conclude that we should alter some of our differences to be more compatible with the characteristics of the group. It would seem to this writer to present a far more courageous, more prudent, and more justifiable stand to begin honestly and much more diligently looking for colleges which have the same basic aims and programs as we. No athletic program can succeed without competition. It is important also to provide competition on the same general level so as to ensure workable agreements as to policing practices that will be followed, eligibility requirements that will be comparable from college to college, and to secure continuance of trust among member colleges. This move will doubtless prove unpopular with the modern exponents of commercialized football, but as Mr. Tom Robinson on Tuesday put it (paraphrased), “Speak out on a subject about which you feel strongly when your conscience says you should, even though it may be an unpopular stand.”

MEET ANNOUNCED

Dr. J. H. Ostwalt, chairman of the Davidson College Student-Faculty Conference Committee, announced Wednesday that the committee’s next meeting would be held on Friday, April 9, 1954. Dr. Ostwalt said that at that time the committee would discuss its plans for the remainder of the school year. The main purpose of the Student-Faculty Conference Committee is to work out problems relating to college life through the cooperation of the students and faculty. Besides Dr. Ostwalt, the committee consists of Professor E. A. Beaty, Mr. Donald Plott, Lyman Kiser, Charlie Johnson, Floyd Feeney, Jim Daughdrill, and Moody Smith.

STUDENTS TO GIVE RECITAL MONDAY

A student recital will take place on Monday evening, April 5, at 8:15 p.m., in the College Union Ballroom, at which several students of the Department of Music, Davidson College, will perform works they have recently studied. A partial list of participants includes the following names: Wayne Burgess, Harry Orr, Leighton McCutchen, John Shannon, Grant Sharp, Thornwell Frick, and James Patterson. The public is invited, and friends of the performers are especially urged to show their interest in the students’ work by hearing them.

Mathew Brady Portraits Now Displayed in Union

Occupying the spotlight on the display board of the College Union this week is a collection of portraits by Mathew Brady, a noted Civil War photographer. The exhibit, which comes to Davidson from the Ansco Film Company, is being sponsored by the Davidson College Camera Club. Andy Simons, president of the club, said the display will remain in the Union through Sunday, April 3.

FEENEY IS PRESIDENT (Continued From Page One)

He was on the freshman basketball team last year and is very active in several interfraternity sports. Buddy Dye was elected in balloting this morning in chapel. Dye, who comes to Davidson from Charlotte, is a pledge of Kappa Sigma.

STUDENT GROUP... (Continued From Page Two)

they could also help to spearhead any program for the administration among the 800 lost souls on this campus. If the noise for accepting a program comes from members of one’s own group, it has a far better chance of being accepted than one which is crammed at us with little or no explanation. The need for this group is urgent and immediate. Rumor already has it that the administration is not going to decide whether the freshmen will eat all year in the Union until this summer, when all the books have been balanced. If such a decision is made without consulting those who are most directly affected—the students—then we may as well kiss good-bye to any student-administration rapport or singleness of purpose, which exists now on shaky ground. This group should have leaders and it should exercise the leadership which has been sadly neglected and unexploited among the student body. These men would have the responsibility of presenting concrete, reasonable recommendations to the administration, and also of aligning the students behind the plans which are considered to be mutually acceptable and helpful to both groups of the college. With smart leadership and the support of us other kindred souls, it could well be a large step in the direction of positive student government.
