NEW CONSTITUTION IN PHI.

With the return of eighty per cent of the whole system, it was found necessary to dig a twelve-foot channel
for the drain connecting the gymnasium.

Evidence of Mr. Hill’s genius and mechanical ability is seen in his newly-invented tunneling machine. This machine was planned and
constructed by him to be used in digging a drain pipe for the gymnasium.

Presbyterian Theological Seminary
Louisville, Kentucky

Full staff of Professors. Curriculum modern and comprehensive, with practical training. Unusually good Library facilities. Comfortable dormitories and home.Life for
students. Write the President Charles R. Hemphill.

Neling machine and he returned ready to build one for this job. The material used was obtained either from the
college or from the Davidson oil mill. With this machine capable of boring six feet of trench and removing twenty
cubic feet of dirt while remaining in the same position, an electric motor furnishes the power; drives the knives which
do the actual digging, and also delivers the dirt over two belt lines to the top of the ditch. Among
the new men are many inter-high school debaters who are expected to do good work. There are also others who
are capable of rapid development into good speakers.

The Philanthropic Society will begin the year with a new constitution, which calls for several radical changes. There will be
only one meeting a week of the Senior society which will take place on Saturday night. At this meeting, the
program will consist of a debate, oration, and declamations by the class on duty. The constitution also provides for a
Junior society, which consists of Freshmen and upperclassmen who have received less than three credits. This society meets on Monday
night, the vice-president of the Senior society presiding. Shortly before the spring term closes, the members of the Junior society
who have received six or more credits are voted on for membership in the Senior society. By this arrangement, neither
the Junior nor the Senior society will be too crowded for the frequent participation of its members.

The Eumenean Society will continue to operate its Freshman society on the plan used last year. As yet, no arrangement
has been made for only one meeting a week, but the society will act upon this at its first meeting.
This action is necessary because recitations are now being held on Monday, the college holiday in past years. Of course,
the new men know that the literary societies offer opportunities for development and friendships which can be had in no
other way.

The present Freshman class is composed of one hundred and two members. This is about seventy behind last year’s Freshman
class. There are of course a few to come yet. This is as good as could be expected under the
present condition of affairs. The new men are a nice looking crowd and will doubtless be a credit to the
institution.
