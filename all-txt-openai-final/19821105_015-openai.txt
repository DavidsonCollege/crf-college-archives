### Newcomers

Seven of the following players are the vaunted recruiting class of 1982. The eighth is a walk-on who has an excellent chance of sticking with the team.

They’re not going to turn Davidson into a Top 20 program tomorrow night or the next full moon. They won’t even turn it into that caliber program for Christmas. By January, however, they will be contributing enough to really help the team, and their contribution may well be the needed boost to get Davidson back into the NCAA playoffs.

#### Harold “Pepper” Bego, 6-0, 160

The first thing you notice about Pepper Bego is his fluid and smooth-as-silk movement with the ball. The talent is there, but Bego, a high school forward, will have a long transition to the point guard position.

He penetrates well, and he passes well, but, as is the case with most freshmen, he needs to improve defensively. His best shot is the baseline jumper, but he isn’t afraid to take the ball to the hoop against anyone. He will be a great one.

#### Gerry Born, 6-7, 210

Born does a lot of things you don’t notice unless you’re watching him specifically. He outrebounds two players on a missed fast-break layup here, he makes a good pass there, he drives for a left-handed jumper over there.

Hussey says, “He probably has as great a nose for the ball as anyone you're gonna see. He’s in the top three in rebounding every day. He can score, and he passes pretty well.”

Born is versatile as well. He can play the three or four spot, but can play the second guard as well.

#### Rafael Hernandez, 6-6, 200

Rafael Hernandez is an unmined vein of talent. Says Hussey, “A player. A talent if there’s ever been one.” The problem is all that talent needs refining, but Raf is gradually getting the hang of it.

“He’s had difficulty picking things up,” explains Hussey. “But when a play breaks down, he gets it in on sheer talent.” Midnight Madness showed that, as he had a banner performance. He’s strong, has great leaping ability, and is an excellent rebounder. In time, he will be a great one.

#### Jim McConkey, 6-9, 220

McConkey, betwixt celebration of a St. Louis World Championship, has “worked on his weaknesses a great deal.” He is a fine shooter within his range and has a wide array of inside moves. He’ll play the five spot, but like the other freshmen he’s having difficulty learning the new systems.

He hits the offensive boards well and is a very good tap-shooter, but he will need more strength to compete on Davidson’s schedule.

#### Bill Naso, 6-1, 170

Bill Naso is a walk-on point guard who won’t quit. Hussey marvels, “He’s a tremendous competitor. He’s a true point guard. He does a lot of good things. He’ll make somebody else better if nothing else happens.”

Naso’s ballhandling skills have earned him the nickname “E. T.”, and he’s a good passer besides. He often tries to do too much with the ball, though, a common freshman mistake. He comes to us from Myers Park High School in Charlotte.

#### Ken Niehbur, 6-7, 210

Bluntly, Ken Niehbur is a ball. Ask anyone who tries to rebound against him. Niehbur is the sort of player who doesn’t worry about scoring points—he wants to rebound. He gets very good position and then hauls it in. He averaged 17 rebounds per game in high school.

“He’s been a really pleasant surprise,” says Hussey. “He knows his role. Ideally he should be a 6-9 center rather than a 6-7.” Don’t bother telling him that—he’ll play like a 6-9 center anyway. He’ll play in the four and five spots.

#### Bill Pollock, 6-10, 215

Surprisingly, Bill Pollock is playing at the number three small forward position. “We think he’s going to be a very good shooter,” says Hussey. “He can run. He needs to learn how to be more aggressive.”

That, surely, is his biggest weakness, but with time he'll become stronger and more aggressive. He may play a little of that number four post position. He is a talent, though.

#### Ted Wolfe, 6-8, 205

Like Franz, Wolfe is a good chemistry player. “He understands the importance of playing as a team,” says Hussey. Wolfe is a rugged player, somewhat reminiscent of a Tribus with a smaller range.

He is a fairly strong rebounder and hits the offensive boards well. He’ll play the number four post position.
