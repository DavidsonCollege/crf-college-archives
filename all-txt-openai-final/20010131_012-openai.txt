**AD Murphy impressed by coach’s experience at academic schools**

Less than a week after Joe Susan was hired at Rutgers as its offensive line coach, Davidson Athletics Director Jim
Murphy introduced Mike Toop as Davidson’s 25th football coach at a press conference on Dec. 18.

Murphy selected Susan over Toop last April when seven-year coach Tim Landis left for St. Mary’s (Calif.). When the position
came open again in December, Murphy wasted little time in hiring Toop.

Unlike with Landis and Susan, however, the school signed Toop to a multi-year contract that Murphy said “lends itself to
longevity.”

Toop’s experience at academic-minded schools such as Davidson, and his mentors, which include Indianapolis Colts general manager Bill Polian, were
the two qualities that most appealed to Murphy.

Polian coached Toop at the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy from 1972 to 1976, and gave him a strong recommendation for
the Davidson job.

“Coach Toop has a history of working at very strong academic institutions,” said Murphy on Saturday. “(He) is a very
strong football person.”

To bring stability to a coaching staff that has been in constant upheaval for the last three seasons, Toop will
retain all of last year’s assistant coaches. The only exception is Carter Westfall, who followed Susan to Rutgers.

For the past two seasons, Toop served as the defensive coordinator for the University of Connecticut. The Huskies played on
the Div. I level last season.

Toop was the defensive coordinator and linebacker coach at the University of Pennsylvania for seven seasons (1992-1998). Penn won three
Ivy League Championships and set an NCAA I-AA record for consecutive wins with 24 during his tenure.

While at Penn, Toop was named the 1995 American Football Quarterly Magazine National Division I-AA Defensive Coordinator of the Year.

For four seasons at the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, Toop started at middle linebacker, guiding the Mariners to a school-record
nine wins in his senior year in 1976. He was also named the team’s Most Valuable Player, along with All-Conference,
All-East, and Honorable Mention All-America honors.

Toop is a native of East Northport, N.Y. He and his wife, Diana, have two children, Marcus (14) and Jaclyn
(10).

**Toop no stranger to win streaks**

The first thing you notice when talking to new Davidson football coach Mike Toop—besides his bald head, thick mustache, and
heavy New England accent—is a shiny piece of hardware on his left hand.

It is a silver ring containing a red stone in the middle and an inscription that reads “Undefeated Back to
Back 21-0.”

He earned the ring as defensive coordinator at Pennsylvania University, where for two seasons in 1994 and 1995, his team
didn’t lose a game.

“This is the only thing you’ll see me wear from another school,” he says.

Since being introduced as Davidson’s coach last December, Toop has been working toward one simple goal: To replace the ring
from Penn with one that he earns here.

“I told the team, if we break the streak, I'll take it off. That’s the plan.”

“The Streak” currently stands at 17 consecutive victories. It spans over two seasons, and now the tenures of three head
coaches.

What’s unique about Toop’s hiring is that it doesn’t come as a result of the failure of his predecessors.

He is here precisely because of their success.

Davidson’s last two coaches, Tim Landis and Joe Susan, used their tenures as springboards to higher-profile jobs.

Landis guided the Wildcats for seven seasons, including a school-record eight wins in each of his last two years. In
April 2000, he became head coach at St. Mary’s (Calif.).

Landis was replaced by Joe Susan, who led the school to its first undefeated season in 103 years before taking
an assistant position at Rutgers in December.

Now it’s Toop’s turn to continue that success, and it couldn’t come at a more crucial juncture.

After spending more than 10 seasons in relative anonymity as an I-AA Independent school, the Wildcats next year will join
nine other schools in the football-only Pioneer League.

Combine that with a roster that currently contains only 42 players, and you can see the challenge Toop is facing.

“That’s a very small number,” he says. “Depth is a concern.”

It is also why Toop spent his first month as head coach on the road recruiting. His message to dozens
of high school seniors: Get a top-notch education and play for a winning football program at the same time.

“There’s a reason why they were undefeated,” he told them. “This team knows how to win, and expects to win.

“I’m not going to sell Davidson,” Toop said Friday. “Davidson is going to sell itself.”
