12 Dr. Tom Scott, former Davidson Director of Athletics and past Chairman of the NCAA Basketball Committee, died on November
24, 1993, in Charlotte. He was instrumental in bringing the Final Four to Charlotte this March, plus many other NCAA
events which have been held in North Carolina. Though seldom recognized publicly, Dr. Scott helped bring more NCAA events to
North Carolina than any other state. Since 1958, Charlotte has hosted 56 tournament games, more than any other city. A
graduate from Kansas State Teacher’s College in 1930, he began coaching at Concordia and Central Missouri before becoming the head
basketball coach at the University of North Carolina in 1947. In five seasons, Scott posted a 100-65 record and was
hired by Davidson in 1955 as athletic director and head basketball coach. In 1960, Scott relieved his coaching duties and
hired Lefty Driesell to coach the Wildcats, and for the next nine years, Davidson would enjoy “the glory years,” finishing
in the top 20 seven times with seven 20-win seasons.

“If it wasn’t for him, I might still be coaching high school,” said Driesell, “I always was indebted to him
for that.” Serving as the athletic director until 1974, Scott was a member of the NCAA basketball tournament committee from
1966 to 1975. He chaired the tournament committee from 1969 until 1975. In 1977, Scott was inducted into the Helms
Foundation Hall of Fame for Athletic Directors. North Carolina coach Dean Smith adds in summation, “He was a man of
integrity and certainly will be missed by all.” -Sports Information

Four new members were inducted into the Davidson College Athletic Hall of Fame last month. The four individuals are Charles
G. “Lefty” Driesell, a 1954 graduate of Duke University, John Porter ’81, Auburn Lambeth ’51, and the late Maj. Gen.
Thomas G. Corbin ’37. From 1961 through 1969, Driesell firmly established Davidson as a national basketball power, recruiting All-Americans Fred
Hetzel and Dick Snyder. He also led the Wildcats to six 20-game winning seasons, four finishes in the top 10,
and two trips to the final 8 in the NCAA tournament.

Porter is the only athlete in Davidson history to twice be honored as a first team Academic All-American. A pre-med
major, he stood out in the classroom and on the baseball field as he was named to the Skoal/Happy Days
Academic All-American team in 1980 and 1981. Porter was named to the All-Southern Conference team three times. His best season
on the field was in 1980 when he hit .383, scored 34 runs, and stole 23 bases.

Corbin was an outstanding blocking back for Davidson’s football team in the 1930s. He also played baseball and participated on
the rifle team. He graduated from Davidson in 1937 and then went on to earn a degree from the U.S.
Military Academy in 1941. Corbin eventually became the youngest general in the U.S. Army Air Corps.The Maj. Gen. Thomas G.
Corbin Merit Scholarship has been established in his name. Lambeth captained both the football and baseball teams in his senior
year at Davidson.

Men's hoops tastes success over break

Hoops continued from page 11

Davidson 72 Furman 62: The game between these two rivals stayed close until there was 17:34 remaining, when Davidson took
the lead for good, never to look back. Davidson used a balanced attack on offense, with four players in double
figures. Alpert led all scorers with 15, followed by Zimmerman and Narat with 14 apiece, while Spain added 11.

UTC 80 Davidson 70: Riding a three-game winning streak, Davidson traveled to Tennessee to face the conference’s best team. Down
by 6 points at the half, UTC showed why they are alone at the top, drawing several fouls and then
making their foul shots, hitting 29 of 37 attempts. Zimmerman and Alpert both fouled out as Davidson was called for
29 fouls. Williams led all scorers with 19 points.

Davidson 65 ETSU 63: After suffering a tough loss, the Cats bounced back with a big road victory, coming back
from a 10-point halftime deficit, and then holding on for the victory in the final minute. Narat burned the field
for 26 points, hitting 11 of 17 attempts. Spain chipped in 19 as he emerges as a consistent scorer in
the paint, missing just one shot while gathering 6 boards.

App. St. 94 Davidson 89: Entering the game with a 9-3 record, the Cats looked to gather their 10th victory
of the season, but the Mountaineers hung tough and pulled out the win, holding the lead for all but 14
seconds of the second half. Again, Narat had an awesome performance, scoring 29 points with 12 rebounds and 7 assists,
but the App. State scoring trio was too much.

The Citadel 68 Davidson 61: With the temporary decision preventing Shannon Faulkner from attending classes, the Bulldogs came out fired
up and pulled a huge upset by beating the Wildcats last Wednesday.

Davidson 78 VMI 60: Ending a week of frustration, the Cats delivered a beating to VMI, opening up a 23-point
halftime lead and cruising the rest of the way. Spain turned in a career-best 21 points, helping Davidson capture its
10th win of the season on the third try. Davidson will now travel to Statesboro, GA, to face Georgia Southern
on Wednesday and then gets a chance to knock off the conference leader UT-Chattanooga this Saturday at home at 7:30.
Of the remaining 11 games, 10 are in the Southern Conference.
