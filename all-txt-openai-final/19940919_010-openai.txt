RTS & LIVING MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 19, 1994

At the Greek Festival held September 9 and 10, revelers dance and a little boy looks on jealously while learning about his heritage.

GOING GREEK: A LITTLE TASTE OF ATHENS
By Rachel Newcomb

I can remember attending several Greek festivals when I was little, in Charlotte as well as in Columbus, Ohio. They tend to run together in my memory now, but I have dim recollections of the big tents, traditional folk music, brightly-colored caftans for sale, and the food—tables piled high with baklava, meat and cheese pastries, salad, souvlaki, and wine.

This year was the first time in several years that I have been back to the Greek Festival in Charlotte. As far as I’m concerned, food is still the main event, but there are other attractions as well. Held last weekend at the Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Cathedral, the 17-year-old festival features costumed dancers, music, and tours of the church. There were rooms set up within the church selling traditional Greek clothes, tapes, authentic pottery, cookbooks, religious icons, and more. A “bakaliko,” a type of grocery store, sold such staples as feta cheese, salad dressing, and frozen pastries. Outside under a big tent, the musicians and dancers performed to a well-fed audience. Greek music is extremely diverse, with influences running the gamut.

Patrick Donley's "Cyclical Nature"
By George Weld

When I first walked into Patrick Donley’s show in the Edward M. Smith Gallery in the VAC, I couldn’t help thinking of this time last year, when one of Cort Savage’s immaculately crafted sculptures was installed there. That sculpture periodically spat balls onto the floor, so that after a while, the room seemed filled with them. The gallery this year is filled again with balls, one in each of Donley’s paintings—they dominate the paintings and unify the entire show.

In fact, this is one of the most unified exhibits I’ve ever seen, visually and thematically: all of the paintings are bright and arresting, and their textures are similar. Most are multi-media works, incorporating collages (including prints of works by Botticelli, Hokusai, and William Blake), and many include a curious petroglyph-esque spiral, meant, I suppose, to reflect the central thematic concerns of this show, which is called "Cyclical Nature.” The paintings themselves make these concerns fairly clear: regeneration, life processes, and the nature of history.

In one painting, Homme Moyen Sensuel, photographs of a man in various stages of life spiral outward from the center of the painting’s central sphere; he begins in the center as a baby, and at the outer edge of the sphere, he is an old man, his face distorted, his individuality blurred. In another, Chrysalis, a young girl stands in a clamshell, a la The Birth of Venus; over her head is a butterfly (which, I noticed with interest, is a real butterfly glued onto the canvas), and on the very edge of the painting another butterfly seems about to fly out of the frame.

Thematically, these two paintings are fairly typical, and their techniques—use of the spiral motif, references to canonical art—are as well. The spheres serve various purposes in each painting; sometimes they work interestingly, sometimes not. In the painting, Nature Morte, the sphere is filled with cut-outs of...Various still-lifes—fruit in various arrangements, Matisse’s goldfish—which are all instances of nature rendered through art, subjugated by the imagination. Outside of the sphere are prints of photographs of a flower, birch trees, and two pieces of actual birch bark. These, I suppose, represent nature in its wildness, untamed by the human imagination. Interestingly, these outside images cross the boundary of the sphere, infringing on the realm of the human. The blurring of boundaries is evident in other paintings, as well—Donley embellishing and extending the hair of Botticelli’s Venus, for instance, or filling in the legs of flying devils in a painting by Signorelli. These paintings violate the boundaries that separate “high” or classical art from contemporary art, co-opting the ancient for use by the cutting edge. Unfortunately, instead of feeling cutting edge or provocative, these paintings seemed boring. They are arresting but not enduring; they grab one’s interest but do not keep it.

The clean, meticulous execution that made Savage’s sculpture last year interesting has the effect in these paintings of making them seem stylized and decorative. The overwhelming unity of the show doesn’t help, either; whatever seemed interesting in the first painting I looked at felt clichéd by the time I'd finally gotten to the end. While I was initially struck by the boldness of color, by the time I'd spent twenty minutes in the gallery, I felt bombarded, as though I’d been aimlessly wandering through a Fruitopia advertisement.

Byzantine chants to Turkish and Iranian music. I was struck by how Middle Eastern the music sounded. The food, as always, was excellent. Common dishes such as souvlaki (shish kebabs in pita bread) and gyros were served, but there was much, much more. My favorites were the tiny cheese pastries known as “tiropitakia” and the spinach and cheese pastries, “spanakopittes.” Of course, there was sweet baklava for dessert, a delicious honey and nut pastry. For those among you who might be ambitious chefs, I have included the recipe for spanakopittes.

COOKING WITH RACHEL
Spanakopittes

- 10 oz. frozen chopped spinach
- 1/2 cup finely chopped onion
- 3 Tbsp. olive oil
- Nutmeg, salt, & pepper to taste
- 1/4 cup fresh dill or mint
- 1/3 cup ricotta cheese
- 1/4 cup feta cheese
- 1 lb. phyllo dough (available in frozen section of Harris Teeter)
- 1 stick melted butter

Defrost the frozen spinach. Drain it, then squeeze out as much remaining moisture as possible with your hands. Sauté the onion in oil until tender and golden. Add spinach and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until mixture is dry. Season to taste with nutmeg, salt, and pepper, and scrape into a bowl. Cool to room temperature. Stir in the dill or mint, the ricotta, and the feta, crumbled into small pieces. Defrost the frozen phyllo dough a couple of hours before using. Peel off two at a time, always keeping the remaining pieces under a damp towel. Place the two pieces of phyllo on a flat surface and brush with butter. Cut into five strips the short way. Place a tablespoon of filling about an inch from the top of each one. Fold a corner across the filling and keep folding as if you were folding a flag. Bake at 350°F for 20 minutes. Makes about 50 triangles.
