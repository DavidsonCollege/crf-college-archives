Williamson "Phis Go Swinging in the Corn” | Quips and Cranks Will Appear At Early Date on Davidson College Annual Will Have New Column By ‘Chubby’ Choose New Beavers King As President Charlie Akers announced that at the next meeting of the Beaver Club, Dr. Rene de Visme Williamson in an interview Monday night said that although he has been at Davidson only one year he has come to like the college very much. Dr. Williamson seemed to think a great deal of both the administration and the student body. Although he is a professor's son and no stranger to college life, he said he had seen or heard of very few schools that were governed quite as ably. Dr. Williamson said he likes free-speaking students who have ideas of their own and do not hesitate to disagree with his own theories. He encourages individual thinking and dislikes the student who gives his lectures right back at him. He says the Davidson student body as a whole is very homogeneous and united.

Dr. Williamson's father was a professor at the University of Chicago. His parents took him to France a few years after his birth where he lived until he was twelve. He still has many childhood recollections of aerial bombardments, strict rationing of food, and German prisoners. The family returned to Vermont where his father was a professor at Middlebury College. He graduated from Rutgers University and later received his Master's and Doctor's degrees at the University of Chicago.

An old-fashioned hay-ride and picnic was the kind of social decided upon when members of the local Philanthropic Literary Society held a joint meeting with the Spectators’ Club of Queens-Chicora College last Thursday night. Above is a group of Davidson students as they arrived at the exclusive Red Fez Club on the Catawba River near Charlotte, where the picnic was held. The hay-ride and picnic included swimming, shuffleboard, strolls in the moonlight, and even a big apple (Courtesy, Charlotte Camera Club).

Davidson student body has a great spirit of unity and camaraderie. Dr. Walter L. Lingle, President of Davidson College, spoke yesterday afternoon in Charlotte at the unveiling of an arch leading to the site of the birthplace of Mrs. "Stonewall" Jackson. The Charlotte chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy is at the entrance to a grove of trees which was the location of the house where Mary Anna Morrison Jackson was born. Mrs. Jackson was the daughter of the Reverend Dr. Robert Hall Morrison, one of the founders and the first president of Davidson. He built the house in which Dr. Lingle spoke.

Citing Article 3, Section 6 of the College Rules and Regulations as his theme, President Walter Lingle made an urgent plea in Chapel Friday for the student body to cover more adequately its unclad feet. Students looked inquiringly at unclad feet stuck in moccasins and various other informal pedal coverings and polo shirts but, no, Dr. Lingle was not referring to them.Lingle was re-| Mathis, Tom Cauble, Hector Me-| Charlotte ground of Wings Mountain.
