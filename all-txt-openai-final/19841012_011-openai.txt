#### From The Green Room: College Bowl Season Begins
By TIM WAPLES

Do Amoebi really thunder? Have you reached the Otter Limits or attended the Relentless Picnic? Was Rasputin a Social Darwinist?
Do you believe Stu King when he says “I Phelta Thi?” Will you See Rock City or will you just
Get Out of the Way? These are the questions on the minds of all College Bowl diehards these days.

That’s right — this year’s edition of intramural College Bowl is underway, with 24 teams and over 100 students. Each
team is involved in divisional head-to-head action, from which only the top teams will advance to an elimination tournament. Monday
night saw the year’s first action. This year’s powerhouse teams are off to fast starts, and the rivalries are already
heating up.

The preseason favorite has to be Get Out of the Way, a face-lifted version of last year’s champion, Better Luck
Next Year. Junior Anne Lambert replaces Stewart Cauley, lost to graduation, and joins returning seniors Tim McGaughey, John Munson, and
Ann “The Meteor” Meador. However, a number of challengers are determined not to heed the defending champion’s new name. I
Phelta Thi returns for their fourth year, and Stu King has managed to bring together the old warhorses from the
freshman year runner-up team, Ross Holt, and Bob Loper. Furthermore, King has brought new blood to the team in sophomore
phenom Gordon Watkins. Watkins may have Stu passing out “B.G.” buttons if he lives up to his stellar second-half play
of Monday night.

Get Out of the Way’s John Munson was unimpressed by Thi’s challenge, responding “Get a real name, I Phelta Thi.”
However, Munson and his cohorts have other potential worries. The resurgent Thundering Amoebi were the only team to mar BLNY’s
sparkling performance last year, and they return five savvy seniors to action this year. The Buzz Aldrins are back for
the third time, with sophomore Dan Murrey picking up the slack for Sara Beasley (now with the varsity team) and
completing the KA contingent. Les Idiots Savants, a sophomore team, will be rubbing elbows with the established franchises, while George
and the Neon Gerbils, Monday’s most impressive winner, will be tough. Section Eight was idle this week, but they'll try
to draw on the Fiji tradition of College Bowl excellence in reaching for the top spot.

The only way to keep up with all the action, aside from watching here weekly for the scoop from the
Green Room, is to come to the matches, played between 7 and 8:30 p.m. on Mondays. Players and spectators can
also check the College Bowl Corner, beside the Union Desk for weekly schedules, standings, and rankings.

Bowie: No More Surprises?
By STEVE MANK

David Bowie has always been rock and roll’s greatest source of surprises. A virtual chameleon, Bowie has changed personas as
frequently as he has changed musical styles. When he went from being a Bob Dylan sound-alike to the demented Major
Tom of "Space Oddity," everyone thought Bowie was showing his true colors. After that, he was Aladdin Sane, then Ziggy
Stardust, etc., etc., ad infinitum. Now you can ask any critic and you’ll hear he’s “repented,” “gone straight,” “found equilibrium.”
It’s good that Bowie's gone straight. Even better, he hasn't stopped surprising. Bowie's latest surprise: no more surprises.

His latest L.P., "Tonight," is not a bad record. In fact, it will probably be the most popular one this
year, with hit singles, controversy, and in-depth criticism into the Bowie mystique. But aside from its “groovy” cover, it is
a tad too formulaic. It sounds like nothing new. Less than half the cuts were written within the last five
years. Only two were entirely original. What's worse, the songs with which Bowie had the least to do compositionally are
among the best tracks.

Gone are the Grand Experiments. Where once a Bowie album meant witty, bizarre, and sometimes scary lyrics, "Tonight" features unimportant
free associations without even a hint of irony. Partner in crime Iggy Pop helped to pen many of the pieces
here, possibly in hopes of resurrecting the songwriting talent that made “China Girl” off the "Let's Dance" album such a
surprise hit. Unfortunately, it doesn't work. “Don’t Look Down” and “Tonight” are standard reggae (though Tina Turner’s vocals on the
latter are a splendid contribution). “Neighborhood Threat” at times sounds annoyingly like Foreigner/Loverboy. “Dancing with the Big Boys” is simply
not a great song. Only “Tumble and Twirl” delivers any kind of musical umph.

There are two cover versions on the album: The Beach Boys’ saucy “God Only Knows,” to which Bowie adds even
more sauce, and Leiber and Stoller’s (“Hound Dog”) “I Keep Forgetting.” Each song is good, perhaps even great, but in
a musical and historical sense, hardly more than his standard fare. The band is in essence the same as on
"Let's Dance." The sound is big, the musicianship is great, but having all those maestros in the studio at once
does get a trifle excessive. Naturally, Bowie's ever-improving voice is in great form as he goes from growling tenor to
almost below audible range. At times his notes are strange — not wrong, just strange — but again, this is
normal Bowie.

The new Bowie we've seen on the last two albums cannot be the real Bowie. Surely it is yet another
mask in an unending procession. This Bowie is talented — a good singer, songwriter — but he is not the
innovator he used to be. That's okay, though, because once he releases his next disc he'll be someone entirely different,
and just like before, we'll forget about some of the weaker efforts he made as another person.
