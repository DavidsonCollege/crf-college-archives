A. C. Winn and Rev. Williams. At the conclusion of these rallies, it was found that the young people desired
another rally and a candlelight service was held later on. At present plans are in the mak- ing for establishing
another com- munity center in the Unity section. The plans are advancing rapidly and will soon be put into effect:
There are also plans under way to hold another series of fall rallies and to provide for a monthly skat-
ing party for all the young people of the community. To carry on work of this nature, all kinds of
talents are needed. If you have an abundance of energy and a desire to serve others, this is your opportunity.
