**No parties before exams, says Terry**

In an agreement between Dean of Students Will Terry and the Council on Campus and Religious Life, it was decided that the self-selection period will be shorter than originally planned. Terry had proposed that the self-selection date be set for early December, before the exam period. The CCRL reviewed this proposal and decided that it would not be fair to football and soccer players to have self-selection this early. The CCRL has scheduled self-selection to begin January 12 but placed a moratorium on parties for five days before exams. According to Terry, this does not mean that parties at this time of year can be moved to dorms because no permissions will be granted to have parties. Exceptions to this are brief parties that will be held in the College Union. Terry believes that this policy will work to everyone's advantage. Quoting a professor, he said, “The semester system is the grinch that stole Christmas.”

**SGA Phonathon exceeds goal**

The SGA concluded its annual phonathon last Thursday, raising over $252,000. This year’s total exceeded the $200,000 goal by 25 percent. Sigma Alpha Epsilon raised the most money with $73,000 in pledges, Kappa Sigma collected $50,500, and Kappa Alpha raised $38,000. The scholarship is aimed at attracting promising students interested in public service. Davidson’s sophomore nominees must compete within their respective states. Only 100 Truman Scholars are named. Winners receive $7,000 annually through the last two years of undergraduate school and the first two years of graduate school.

**Spencer donates collected items to needy Davidson residents**

Spencer House held a “Food, Clothing, and Deed” drive and succeeded in raising $40 and several bags of clothing. The articles were taken to Davidson where they were distributed to needy people. This is the fourth year of the drive. Kathy Johnson, service chairman, said, “I consider the drive very successful and I wanted to thank everyone who contributed. I especially wanted to thank Grover Meetze.”

**Grover Meetze to retire after 30 years**

Grover Meetze, director of facilities planning, has announced that he will resign effective January 1990. In a letter to the college, Meetze indicated that since plans have been set for the next 30 years, "it is in the best interest of the college to establish a new administrative authority in facilities planning to provide the needed continuity for this extended period." Meetze will continue to reside in Davidson.

**Truman Scholar nominees selected**

Jennifer McGrady, Kristi Mitchell, and Laura Sizemore have been nominated from a pool of 14 Davidson candidates to compete for the Truman Scholarship.

A loss is always painful, especially when it is someone’s life that is taken. Recently the college community experienced such a loss. A natural response to loss is grief. While grief is a common human reaction to loss, there are no “hard and fast” rules to how it will be experienced. Grief will affect each individual in an ideographic manner. There are common expressions of grief. Misery and despair may cause those left behind to see life as empty and all ambition worthless. Apathy inhibits...any effort and movements are slow; behavior and expression reveal the sorrow. There may be fleeting desires to be with the person who has died, especially if there are reminders of the person. Frequently, grief reaches physical intensity; the chest tightening, breathing becomes irregular, eating disturbances and sleeping difficulties may become apparent. Some survivors will find it difficult to concentrate. The grief reactions are often accompanied by self-doubt, painful self-questioning, shame, and guilt. It is advised that if you experience any of these symptoms, not to deny their existence. These are natural human responses; don’t deny yourself the opportunity to mourn. If the grief process is too uncomfortable for you to handle alone, seek help (it is a sign of strength when you recognize assistance will help). Utilize your support group; friends may be experiencing the same feelings—talk to them, use them as a forum for self-disclosure. Also, take advantage of the support services available in the College—the counseling center, the chaplain’s office, the Dean of Students’ office, or your faculty advisor.

If you think a friend may be considering suicide, be direct. Talk openly to the person in order to find how serious the person is about the decision. Listen to the person, show that you care. Reassure the person that you are always willing to talk about things that may be troubling him or her. Help the person seek professional help and offer to go with the person to the source of help. As the concerned person, you do not want to avoid the issue. Avoid offering “empty” reassurances, such as, “You have it a lot better than most people.” Instead, assure the person he or she can be helped. Don’t keep what you may know about the person a secret. Don’t leave the person alone. By no means feel responsible for saving the person. You can help the person by showing that you care and by helping the person get professional help. But you cannot control what the person decides to do.
