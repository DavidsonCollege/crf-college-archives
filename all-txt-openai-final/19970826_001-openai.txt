This is Dean of Admission and Financial Aid Nancy Cable’s favorite time of the year.

After reviewing 3,183 applications, selecting 1,153 potential Davidsonians, and distributing financial assistance, the Admissions and Financial Aid staff can finally
see the 472 students of the Class of 2001 arrive on campus.

From the largest number of applicants in Davidson’s history, 242 men and 230 women from 38 different states and 16
foreign countries enrolled as freshmen.

Seven hundred hours of volunteer work, a lawn-mowing business that has yielded $21,800, and study of an ancient Indian martial
art called Kalari Payat are just a few accomplishments of individual students. The Class of 2001 seems to have more
students dedicated to one activity as opposed to numerous commitments than previous classes had, particularly in the case of volunteering.
These new students are academically strong, with 95 percent coming from the top 20 percent of their high school and
19 percent graduating as valedictorian or salutatorian.

However, the Class of 2001 is also one of the most diverse, with 30 African Americans, one Hispanic American, and
22 international students attending pre-orientation. These numbers are the culmination of a five-year effort to...

chance to practice their abilities Sept. 12-14, as the Union sponsors the Hurricane Hugo Juggling Festival.

**New students share thoughts, hopes, fears**

The second day of Orientation began bright and early Thursday as Union staff members herded freshmen through New Student Check-In.

With social security numbers and checkbooks in hand, hundreds of bewildered freshmen secured their BTI cards, student IDs, and a
chance to don a hula hoop and sombrero for the camera.

Many freshmen had only been at Davidson two short hours, but were willing to share first impressions.

“Everything seems well planned and it’s all running smoothly,” said Kelly Byrd of Thousand Oaks, Calif. “Everyone has been very
nice.”

Overall, most new students felt reassured by the personal attention and cordial welcome they received from Davidson staff and students.

Kurt Hirsekorn of Moorestown, N.J., echoed this sentiment, noting that the “friendly atmosphere of the South has been comforting” in
the face of freshman anxieties.

Hirsekorn, who swims and plays golf, came to Davidson because “it offers the best combination of academics and sports.”

Katherine Miller of Upper St. Clair, Pa., also found Davidson’s Division I status attractive in making the final decision to
attend.

Two concerns, though, hinged on the dorm issue.

“My greatest fear is that I won’t be able to fit everything into my room,” said Stephanie Kohler of Atlanta.

David Farnum of Roanoke, Va., named his greatest anxiety simply as “Richardson dorm.” Soliciting a swap of rooms, he mentioned
that he was willing “to give sexual favors.”

“No, really, my real fear is looking like a freshman. Wide-eyed, clingy, wide-eyed.”

Farnum cited his reception to the Bonner Scholar program as a welcome which “lessened the impact” of these potentially overwhelming
first days of school and the realization that the furniture in his room is immobile.

Some freshmen, such as Michael Brady of Tampa, Fla., found it “liberating” to wave goodbye to parents and life at
home.

“I have older friends who’ve prepared me for what to expect,” he said.

In fact, many newcomers received warnings from older siblings and Davidson graduates of a “rude awakening” forthcoming.

Other students, however, worried about maintaining friendships and relationships from home while they are away at school. David Kang of
West Plains, Mo., observes that “starting over is a bittersweet experience.”

Not only is it hard to leave old friends behind, but many freshmen share apprehensions about making new friends, particularly
among roommates. Rebecca Rich, for example, had not yet met her roommate as of registration.

“I worry about living with someone else,” she said. Amidst check-in confusion, “I’ve already misspelled my name and I sounded
illiterate saying those mad libs over the radio.”
