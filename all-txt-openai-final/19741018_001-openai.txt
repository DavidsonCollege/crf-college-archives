**WDAV Board Discusses Watt Hike**

*(Ed. note: The possibility that Davidson College may someday establish and operate a 50,000-watt FM radio station has sparked much discussion concerning the fate of student-operated WDAV under such circumstances. The following questions and answers, prepared by the WDAV Board of Directors, seek to clarify all pertinent considerations of such a venture.)*

**Q. IS IT TRUE THAT DAVIDSON IS PLANNING TO DEVELOP A HIGH-POWER RADIO STATION?**

A. The possibility is under consideration by the college staff and trustees. But no decision on any change of the radio station has been made at this time.

**Q. IF A HIGH-POWER STATION IS DEVELOPED AT DAVIDSON, WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO WDAV?**

A. The FCC has assured us that it is thoroughly legal for one institution to own two FM stations. It is not uncommon for a university to have a high-power public service radio station and a low-power (10 watts as WDAV has now) station for a student activity. Another option would be a student station operated on carrier current as in past years. But nothing at present seems to be in the way of WDAV continuing to operate as a 10-watt student station if the college does decide also to develop a high-power public service facility.

**Q. WHEN MIGHT A DECISION ON HIGH POWER BE MADE?**

A. The matter will be discussed by the Board of Trustees at its meeting on campus Oct. 25. The trustees will probably be asked at that time to authorize the college to employ a broadcasting consulting firm to investigate the possible physical and financial aspects of Davidson’s developing a high-power radio station.

**Q. WHY IS THE COLLEGE CONSIDERING THE DEVELOPMENT OF A HIGH-POWER RADIO STATION?**

A. Because the college is aware of a need for such a station in the Charlotte area, and believes it would benefit both the college and the public if Davidson were to operate one. There is no station in the Charlotte area now broadcasting classical music or other serious programming on a regular basis. Some 10,000 residents of the area have signed petitions requesting that such music be broadcast. Of special interest is the support of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The CPB has chosen as its goal the establishment of at least one public service radio station in each of 100 major population centers, including the Charlotte area. It provides funds totaling some $40,000 to enable stations to progress over three years from a small staff to a desired level of five full-time staff members programming 18 hours a day, seven days a week. The CPB is interested not only in good music but also public interest programs in areas of education, information, news, and coverage of important local issues.

**Davidson Represented At SFEE Meeting**

By ANDREW LAMAS
Senior News Editor

Two members of the administration and as many students attended the third annual conference of the Society for Field Experience Education (SFEE) in Atlanta last weekend.

“Attending the SFEE Conference was important for Davidson because it gave us an opportunity to meet people from every part of the country who are doing experiential programs,” said Ken Wood, director of Davidson’s new Office of Education. “From these people we learned of some exciting program ideas. It also gave us an opportunity to get feedback on our developing program,” he said.

Vice President for Academic Affairs John M. Bevan was a featured guest of the SFEE conference. Bevan presented a paper on the “Educational Institution’s Role in Field Experience Education.” He offered a few futuristic impressions concerning our changing lifestyles. As society becomes increasingly mobile, the average person will have to learn to relate to other people more quickly, he said. If it is possible for a person to retain a sense of permanency in a fast-moving urban world, he/she will have to look beyond those features of the present day (e.g., the land) that have traditionally provided security.

People will have to learn how to cope with vast amounts of information and how to avoid “information overloads,” Bevan told the conference. If America’s value system has in the...Past been based on the work ethic, surely modern man will have to make adjustments when the computer and increased automation secure man more and more leisure time, Bevan said. Like most of the delegates to the SFEE conference, Bevan felt that institutions of higher education have the obligation to help prepare young men and women for the drastically different world that awaits. John Duley, an officer of the SFEE, said that the purposes of his organization are “to encourage the development of field experience education, facilitate sharing of ideas and activities among institutions concerned with field experience, support exploration of issues in field education, and be a source of expertise for those seeking counsel regarding field experience programs and projects.”

Field experience education encompasses a wide range of learning activities. “Experiential learning, or field experience education, is an activity undertaken in a particular off-campus setting under the sponsorship, but not the direct supervision, of a faculty member,” said Wood. “It may include one or more of the following: cross-cultural experience, pre-professional training, institutional analysis/career exploration, work experience, service-learning, social/political action, personal growth and development, and field research,” he said.

According to Bevan, a liberal arts professor should be one who is able to relate ideas of life and knowledge to wisdom. Presentations at the conference reflected doubts that the professor will be able to fulfill this model—or the student to understand it—unless both professors and students participate in some type of experiential learning. “I think field experiences are important for Davidson students and professors because action is just as necessary as reflection, practice as important as theory in human development and in any viable education program,” said Wood.

The reasons behind changing to public transportation are numerous. The situation of European inflation, particularly in Italy and France, has pushed the cost of everything up to such a level that there is no room in a student’s budget to pay parking fees, etc. French said, “You rent cars when you need them. You can get some pretty good rates with unlimited rental and we wouldn’t have to pay so much insurance. We could save on CPB grants to provide funds for stations to develop specific program series.”

Another factor prompting interest in high-power radio is that Davidson must remain in the consciousness of the Charlotte community. In the future, we must count on Charlotte for substantial support. We cannot possibly offer the kinds of adult education courses CPCC offers, nor can we reach the thousands of local students UNCC reaches. But we could serve the Charlotte community by providing the kind of high-quality educational and music programming so many have asked for. Charlotte has been and should remain our “home city.” By meeting a genuine need of the city in a way which will be apparent 18 hours a day, we can provide a true public service.

Q. WHAT EVIDENCE IS THERE THAT SUCH A STATION AT DAVIDSON COULD SUCCEED?
A. Similar stations have succeeded at other institutions, such as Wake Forest and Union Seminary at Richmond. Union, which has a smaller student body than Davidson, operates a 50,000-watt educational FM station, broadcasting classical music and educational programs. Public response has been so great that seminary leaders consider it one of the best developments at Union in recent years. Already more than 60 percent of the station’s operating revenue comes from listener contributions, and leaders believe that the station will soon become self-sustaining.

Threatens Classics Abroad

“My family and I went over there two summers ago and covered Labban’s itinerary. Using public transportation we were able to cover the same itinerary that he covers every year,” continued French. An example of the raging inflation that French has to deal with can be found in Grecian prices. “Gas cost $2.50 a liter (0.95 (See CLASSICS, page 8)
