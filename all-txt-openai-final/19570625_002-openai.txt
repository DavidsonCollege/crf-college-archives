IMPORTANT ISSUE (onth. room + a)

The usual editorial column has
been deleted in order that we might
fully publish the momentous petition
that is soon to be presented to the
SULZER SCHOOL Student Council. Incidentally, it is our editorial policy
to be fully in favor of this proposed
change as stated in the petition.

(3) that a series of compulsory
classes be instituted in the Art of
Relaxation; which classes to be taught
by Dr. Norman Vincent Peale during
that period now occupied by Chapel
activities, and

(4) that any student desiring
non-athletic amusement equipment such
as earth movers, building wreckers,
steam rollers, or any equipment belonging to the Weston Waterproofing Co.,
should be provided with the same.

This resolution to have full and
immediate force, any existing rules
and/or regulations notwithstanding.

(Signed by 150 members of the
SULZER SCHOOL Student Body, this petition may be viewed in room #230,
Belk Dormitory, between the hours of
3:00 - 4:00 a.m., by any interested
party.)

QUESTION: WOULD you favor
PLACING THE FULL SCHOOL YEAR
ON A SUMMER SCHOOL BASIS?

(THAT IS, CONCENTRATING ON ONE
COURSE FOR SIX WEEKS, FINISHING
IT, AND BEGINNING ANOTHER)

Scott Woodmansee: I wouldn't
favor it because doing this
would distract from the purpose
of a liberal arts college. There
would be no correlation of subjects.

Bob Martin: No. This would not give
the student enough diversification
and would therefore become monotonous.

Harry Shaw: I favor our present system
because not only does the student
get more out of the course, but he
has more time for athletics and for
extra-curricular activities.

Jim Reynolds: I favor the intensification
of courses because specialization
leads to a better understanding
of the subject matter.

Charlie Massey: I favor it but I think
there would be too many administrative
problems, conflicting courses, etc.,
to make it feasible.

Bob Shoffner: I'm in favor of it.
Hey, see that cute chick crossing the

SOCIAL ERE)

Brice:
When one sits down at a bridge
table with his friends to play a
hand of bridge with friends or
enemies, either one of two procedures
may be followed: the players
may play bridge or carry on a conversation, but they cannot do both.

Nothing can more frustrate a good
player than seeing the other players
discuss such trivial matters as rain,
moon, or world wars.

Furthermore, when one sits down
to play with a partner with whom he is
unfamiliar, and hears one's partner
begin a tale about a date he had
or a dull class just finished, one
had better get a new partner, for
one is in for a rough night. Play in
the Union and one will see what I say.
