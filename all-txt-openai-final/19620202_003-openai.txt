TROUBLE AT WILLIAM & MARY

It seems that all is not well in the wonderful world of sports at William & Mary this year. According
to Bill Brill, sports editor of The Roanoke Times, the Indians’ head basketball coach, Bill Chambers, may be looking for
a new job at the end of the current season. Indian fans are very unhappy about this season’s 5-11 record,
and the most dissatisfied of them all is Milton Drewer, the school’s Athletic Director. According to editor Brill, Drewer and
Chambers get along with each other about as well as a couple of gamecocks armed with spurs and all. Drewer
criticizes Chambers’ recruiting policies, and Chambers blames a lack of scholarships and the poor basketball facilities at W&M. (The Indians’
home court, old Blow Gymnasium, is renowned as the worst in the conference.)

Editor Brill seems to favor Drewer in the argument and uses Lefty Driesell as his example of a hustling coach
who can get the job done despite handicaps. The following paragraphs were in Brill’s column last Sunday:

Davidson’s facilities are no better than W&M’s, and it’s more difficult to get a boy into Davidson because of the
extremely high academic standards. Yet Davidson has the best freshman team in the conference, a tribute to the hustle of
coach Lefty Driesell. Virginia Tech coach Chuck Noe, who doesn’t count himself among the Driesell admirers, admits that the Davidson
coach did a fine recruiting job. “I’ll say this for Driesell,” said Noe. “He really went out and scratched, and
he brought in some good boys. Davidson will be real tough next year.”

We appreciate the compliment, Mr. Noe, but you might be interested to know that Davidson is tough this year. Noe
may not know it, but the Wildcats have won ten straight ball games, and are rated as the conference dark
horse.

Getting back to the William & Mary trouble, we don’t see that Drewer has the right to criticize anybody. He
also serves as head football coach, and in five seasons his grid troops have compiled a dismal 13-35-1 record. This
year the Indians finished in the league cellar with a 1-9 record.

A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION

The recent announcement that Wildcat squads will play Princeton in basketball, and possibly Virginia in football next season provides a
real challenge for all of those connected with athletics at Davidson. We approve very much of this action taken by
Dr. Scott and the athletic committee, which draws up our sports schedules. We feel that this action is a step
in the right direction, and is indeed a shot in the arm to our athletic program. If nothing else, playing
such big-name schools is excellent for the prestige of Davidson. Both Bill Dole and Lefty Driesell are looking forward to
the challenge, but both men realize that their players and themselves are going to have to give 100 percent effort
at all times to perform the rigorous tasks which face them next season. Next year may very well prove whether
or not Davidson College has the right to compete on a big-time basis.

YOU'RE ON THE AIR, DAVIDSON

Davidson publicity director Taylor Blackwell announced that radio station WCGC in Belmont is planning to broadcast several remaining Wildcat basketball
games. The station carried last night’s Erskine game, and plans to broadcast the Richmond and Furman games (both away) back
to area fans. Blackwell said that WCGC has become very interested in the basketball situation at Davidson, and it may
carry many of the Wildcat contests over the air next season.

Frosh Get Revenge Against Baby Deacs

The Davidson freshman basketball team tasted sweet revenge last night as they rolled over Wake Forest, 78-53, for their 8th
win against 3 losses. Paced by Fred Heizel’s 28 points, Dave Thomas’ 17, and Don Davidson's 16, the Wildkittens stomped
the Baby Deacons, who had nipped them by one point in the opening game. The ’Kittens jumped off to a
26-8 lead before Wake Forest knew where it was, but the visitors began to chip away, and at halftime Coach
Joe Hunt’s men enjoyed a mere 37-33 lead. The Baby Deacs closed this margin to 37-36 at the beginning of
the second half, but they never got the lead as the ’Kittens went on another rampage to put the game
on ice. As the final buzzer sounded, icing was added to the cake as Charlie Marcon’s arching overhead push shot
from the far corner swished through the nets to write the final victory margin at 25 points.

Tommy White turned in one of his best performances of the year, as he rebounded well and pumped in 8
vital points. Paul Briggs also did a good job, as he continued to show an excellent eye from the free
throw line. Barry Teague was forced to sit out the game due to a sprained ankle sustained in the Oak
Ridge game.

Georgia Visits Davidson Pool

BY CHARLIE SHAPARD
Davidsonian Sports Writer

A busy schedule awaits the Davidson mermen, who now hold a 2-1 record following a close defeat at the hands
of VPI, 52-43. Coach Dwight Shoe’s men begin the after-exam splash tomorrow afternoon by playing host to a very tough
team from the University of Georgia, which holds victories over Alabama, Georgia Tech, and VPI. The Bulldogs are led by
Rolfe Pinkerton, a sprinter, and Charlie Gentry, who could be a standout in almost any event. On Monday, February 5,
the Catfish travel to Charleston in hopes of dunking a relatively strong Citadel team, which has some fine swimmers including
the conference title.

The following Davidson swimmers scored points in the VPI meet just prior to exams:
- 220 freestyle—Carter Mebane (1st)
- 200 medley—Tom French (2nd)
- 50 freestyle—Jack Hollenbeck (1st)
- Diving—Bill Whittington, Dick Fromm (2nd)
- 200 butterfly—Charlie Shapard (3rd)
- 100 freestyle—Hollenbeck(1st) 200 backstroke—French (2nd) 200 breaststroke—Stefan Young (1st), Bill Dexter, conference 100-yd (2nd) breaststroke champion The 440 freestyle—Mebane
(2nd) Cadets hold victories over both 400 relay—Davidson (1st—Mebane, Hollenbeck, Ambrose, Baum)

Matmen Tour Georgia
BY BILL PRIDGEN
Davidsonian Staff Writer

Yesterday morning at 10:30, Davidson’s matmen left on a trip to Atlanta for matches with Emory University in Atlanta and
the University of Georgia in Athens. The team journeys to Atlanta first and Coach Charlie Parker stated that the trip
would be, in effect, “a journey into the unknown.” He said that he had little or no information on either
of the two teams that his matmen would come up against on this trip. Parker did, however, reveal that he
expected Georgia to be a lot tougher than Emory, since the Bulldogs beat Emory “pretty bad” when the two teams
met earlier this year. He also added, “Emory has a really good 137-pounder, Walter Edwards, who was a conference champion
last year.” Parker expressed disappointment that Russell Walls, the team’s regular heavyweight, was not able to make the trip because
of a rib injury received in practice Tuesday.

M Threatens Streak
Tribe Seeks Revenge; ’Cats Seek No. Eleven
BY STEVE CLARK
Davidsonian Sports Editor

Seven come eleven, and if number eleven does come, it will be tomorrow night in Williamsburg, Va., where the win-happy
’Cats meet William & Mary at 8 p.m. Number ten came last night when Erskine fell to the local troops,
71-57, in Johnston Gymnasium before approximately 2000 fans. However, only a second half surge provided Davidson its comfortable 14 point
victory margin.

COLD ‘CATS
Cold as the weather outside in the first half, the ‘Cats hit only 9 field goals in 34 attempts for
a poor 26.2 per cent. Taking advantage of the usually hot Davidson shooters’ cold spell, the Flying Fleet tossed in
50 per cent of its shots, and went to the dressing room with a 29-29 tie with the favored Wildcats.
However, Coach Lefty Driesell warmed his men up during intermission with a heated verbal lashing, and the red and white
clad cagers returned to the floor with no intentions of being denied their tenth consecutive win. Gunning in 52 per
cent of its second half shots, Davidson brought its overall percentage for the night up to 37.3.

BEERMAN IMPROVES
Wildcat scoring was evenly distributed among Bill Jarman (21), Bill Beerman (15), Terry Holland (11), and D. G. Martin (10).
Other point makers were Haywood Evans (6), Danny Carrell (4), Lyman Dillon (2), and Howard Arbuckle (2). Beerman continued to
show tremendous improvement, and the 6'4" sophomore from Pittsburgh, Pa., gave every indication that he is ready for 40 minutes
of action each game. Besides pumping in 15 points, he pulled down 7 rebounds. Jarman and Martin were top rebounders
with 11 each, while Holland garnered 10. The ‘Cats were dominating off the boards as they out-rebounded the shorter Erskine
players, 54-33.

CONFERENCE FOES
This afternoon the squad left for a three-day trip to Virginia, where they will meet Southern Conference foes William &
Mary and Richmond. Thus the ‘Cats get a chance to improve on their 2-3 conference record as well as a
chance to continue their winning streak. Double victories on this road trip would probably soar them to a sky-scraping third
place in conference standings. Driesell and his men are aware of the dangers that confront them on this trip. Tomorrow
night's opponent, William & Mary, has won 5 out of 6 home games this season, the only loss being to
VPI. The Indians have been known to scalp more than one high-riding team which dared to set foot in old
Blow Gymnasium, which is like a matchbox full of ants on basketball nights in Williamsburg.

TRIBE IMPROVED
Davidson clipped the Tribe 62-47 here on January 3. However, W&M, which has a not too impressive 6-11 record, seems
to be a new team since its examination break. In their first two games following exams, the Indians have lost
to nationally ranked West Virginia by only 9 points, and have defeated Furman by a 79-67 count. Monday night's foe,
Richmond, has compiled a 6-13 record up to date, and is 4-5 in the conference. Led by a sensational 6'4"
sophomore, John Telepo, the Spiders have gunned down such common foes as George Washington, The Citadel, William & Mary, and
VMI. Many of their 13 losses have been at the hands of powerhouses such as West Virginia, St. Joseph's, and
Memphis State.

Evans’ Outside Shooting Kept Terriers Honest
BY SPRATT
Davidsonian Sports Writer

Consistent throughout the season, “Wildcat of the Week” Haywood Evans rose above his consistency last Saturday night, and sparkled in
a “lacklustre” win over Wofford. Evans won no blue ribbon against the Terriers. The honors for scoring and field goal
accuracy went to Terry Holland, and Bill Jarman copped the rebound laurels. But Evans did give testimony to evidence that
will have to be reckoned with by future opponents.

TERRIERS GAMBLED
The Terriers knitted themselves into a tighter zone, attempting to clog up the board power of Jarman and Holland, and,
in effect, gambling on the ‘Cats’ outside weakness. However, before the second half was over, the junior guard from Rocky
Mount, N. C., had proved outside weakness a fallacy, and the Wofford gamble a downright security risk. He sparkplugged action
by pumping in 18 points from the floor, 12 in the second half. Praise-stingy George Cunningham of The Charlotte Observer
went so far as to credit Evans with a second-half save of the faltering “Tamecats.”

HONEST BALL
And Evans admits, “It was one of my better halves, though not one of our better games.” He goes on
to explain his second-half surge in basic basketball terms. “We have to keep them honest,” he says. One gets the
feeling after last Saturday night that there'll be a lot of “honest” basketball around here in weeks to come.

I-F Basketball Resumes Action
I-F basketball action gets underway again tonight after a long layoff dating back before the Christmas holidays. Exams interrupted the
schedule following the holidays, and Greek Week activities postponed games slated to be played this week. However, for the next
two months Davidson's favorite intramural sport should proceed on an uninterrupted basis, and plenty of heated action is in store
again this season.

The Phi Delts and SAE’s are defending co-champions of the I-F roundball league, and should be strong contenders for the
title again this year. However, both of these clubs were beaten prior to Christmas, and the three remaining undefeated teams—the
KA's, Phi Gams, and Kappa Sigs—appear to be the best bets for this year’s laurels. Current standings are as follows:

Kappa Sigs 2 0
Phi Gams 2 0
KA's 1 0
Phi Delts 1 1
SAE’s 1 1
Sigma Chis 1 1
Pikas 0 1
Pi Kapps 0 2
Sigma Nus 0 2
