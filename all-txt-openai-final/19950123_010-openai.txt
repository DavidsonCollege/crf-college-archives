**Rachel’s Fourmost Movie Favorites**
By Rachel Newcomb

Since this is my last column as Arts Editor, I'd like to indulge in another article about my favorite things.
This time I want to talk about movies. Not the kind of movies which are enjoyable but easily forgotten when
you leave the theater. Or the kind that take you on an emotional roller coaster ride full of cheap thrills,
leaving you drained of tears or aching with laughter at the end. Those movies are fine, of course, but they
don’t change your life. And that’s what I want to talk about. The kind of movies that make you shiver
with astonishment at how good they are. Movies you could watch over and over and each time notice something new
about them. There are very few movies like that, but I can name my favorites.

**4. Kiss of the Spider Woman.**
Starring William Hurt and the late Raul Julia, this movie is about two men sharing a prison cell in Latin
America, one jailed for conspiring against the government, the other for a minor sex offense. Raul Julia, a much underrated
actor who died last year, is brilliant as the intense political prisoner. Hurt acts with great sensitivity and depth when
his character falls in love with Julia’s. It is an excellent portrayal of relationships which form under duress between people
who otherwise would never have met.

**3. The Graduate.**
This movie is hilarious. It is especially appropriate for those of us about to graduate who are wondering where in
the world we’ll be next year. In one of his earlier roles, Dustin Hoffman plays an aimless college graduate who
spends the summer vegging out by the pool. He begins an affair with a friend of the family who is
also the mother of a girl he wants to date. The scrapes he gets into are extremely funny, and although
this movie was made in the 1960s it truly stands the test of time.

**2. The Sheltering Sky.**
Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci brings the Paul Bowles novel of the same title to life in this sprawling production. Debra
Winger and John Malkovich star as a bored couple seeking adventure and oblivion in North Africa after World War II.
The landscape is spectacular and the story is extremely moving. Much of the story takes place in Morocco, which is
one reason why I like it so much. But it’s still a good film, albeit a bit hard to follow
at times.

**1. Cinema Paradiso.**
This is currently my all-time favorite.

**Globetrotters Return Home to Tell Their Tales**
Students gain exposure to remote cultures
By Renu Bhatt

“It was the best thing I ever could have done with my study abroad experience,” says junior anthropology major Karen
Morris. This is a common sentiment among many of the returning Davidson students who spent last semester abroad. Many of
them share fond memories and experiences with the Davidson College community, yet each student has had a unique experience.

Imagine Niger, where the villages have polygamous societies and white people are scarcely seen. Morris traveled to Niger, where she
studied traditional children’s songs and two West African languages, Hausa and Djerma. Although she has an elementary level ability in
these languages, Morris was able to communicate with the people she worked with. During a visit to a Nigerian village,
Morris worked as a Peace Corps volunteer. She was only the fourth white person the natives in the village had
ever seen. Because it is unheard of for a woman of Morris’ age not to have a husband, she was
forced to invent the existence of a husband. Otherwise, she was given five marriage offers while in the village. She
had the pleasure of finding out that she is worth three cows and two camels!Morris says that she definitely would
like to go back and travel throughout Africa. Farther south on the African continent, Julie Timmons, a biology major, was
studying in Botswana. The focus of her trip was ecology and conservation. Timmons did an independent study on termites, trying
to discover the optimal living conditions for them. She learned that termites require lots of moisture and low temperatures.

Timmons found the people that she met in Botswana very friendly. She lived with a family and studied the language
with them for a few weeks. She also enjoyed the slow-paced life that the people of Botswana live. Like Morris,
Timmons spent a week living in a native village. While there, she had some entertaining experiences. The children in the
village, who rarely saw white skin, would rush out of their huts screaming, “Makgoa! Makgoa!” “Makgoa” means white person. A
man in the village gave Timmons a chicken as a gift, which she was expected to pluck and cook, which
she did.

One thing about Botswana that concerns Timmons is the country's overwhelming population of elephants. The countryside is swamped with elephants
which destroy gardens, homes, and forestry, despite the fact that some are very useful. Because of an international ban on
ivory, the government and people of Botswana cannot do anything about the problem. The elephants are endangered in most parts
of the world, but not in Botswana, where they are a nuisance.

Christmas on the River Wild

While many of us spent the break letting Mom dote on us, some laughed in the face of death.

Did you have any interesting stories to tell about your Christmas vacation? Talk to the students who either canoed or
sailed with Davidson Outdoors. Seven trip leaders accompanied by Ed and Marlys Daugherty (Davidson Outdoors directors) ventured out to the
Rio Grande. They canoed about 18 miles a day for a total of 85 miles down the river. In addition
to learning more about canoeing and running rapids, the students hiked in scenic areas, relaxed in Hot Springs, and splashed
around in the natural pools of crystal-clear rainwater. Marc Le France commented that the desert area was foreign to him,
and he loved seeing how the water had shaped rocks and cliffs through the years. The group only saw two
people during the entire 12 days along the Rio Grande. Students who speak Spanish tried to thank the two Mexicans
for the use of their land. After the students spent half an hour piecing words together, the Mexicans shocked the
group by answering in nearly perfect English!

Two new trip leaders, freshmen Duncan McFarland and Patricia Evans, had their first experience in planning trips, driving the vans,
and making decisions. Everyone got to know each other well and developed nicknames with funny stories behind them. After spending
twelve days out hiking and canoeing, the group enjoyed showering, eating, and relaxing in a hot tub at the home
of Stephen Eliot’s relatives.

The sailing expedition, led by Sumner Mitchell and Ann Dupre Rogers, was a little different from past years. Instead of
spending the night docked at the coast, the boats were anchored together out in the water. Rogers said it made
the experience more enjoyable without the distractions of crowds, other boats, restaurants, and bars. An all-night sail, sightings of dolphins,
jellyfish, and birds, and warm weather made the trip exciting and pleasant.

If you missed out on these wonderful Davidson Outdoors activities, be sure to sign up now for upcoming events at
the Union Desk. You can find information about all the activities at the Davidson Outdoors office in Johnson Gym or
