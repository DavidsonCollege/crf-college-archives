enjoyed the full moon Friday and Saturday nights. In spite of the May Day dances at girls’ colleges around, there
was an excellent showing of the fairer members of the fairer sex. Thanks to the resourcefulness of Brothers Scruggs and
Upchurch, the program at the banquet Saturday night was most entertaining, with bits of poetry by faculty brothers Winn and
Davidson and the playing of some compositions by Scruggs and Upchurch. One of the highlights of the evening was the
awarding to George Gunn of the cup which is annually given to Phi Alpha’s most worthy Beta.

PHI MU
(Continued from Page 1)
Mu Alpha emphasized the relation of the various branches of the Fine Arts along with its more specific proposals regarding
music. A noteworthy aspect of this project is that it is the result of student interest and not of faculty
prompting. It was felt that the papers would have much more significance because they spontaneously arose in this manner.

will be assigned to each hall meeting to cite the necessity of collecting these clothes and the methods to be
used in collecting them. The plan of collection will be to place on Thursday morning on each hall in the
dormitories an appropriately marked box where the students can deposit their old clothes. The Chapel program Thursday morning, May 8,
will be conducted by the club to further promote the drive. Thursday night a member of the club will visit
each man in his room to make sure that everyone takes part in this worthy cause. It is hoped that
the drive can be concluded by Friday night, but the boxes will be left on the halls as long as
necessary.

as a major problem of society. The course was designed for the in-service training of persons who had already had
experience as law enforcement officers. The curriculum included not only technical phases of police work, but broad and practical training
in fields closely related to the work of law enforcement. During the period of training, classes were held on Tuesdays
and Thursdays in the chemistry lecture room, in the basement of the Science Hall, from two to four in the
afternoon and from seven-thirty until nine-thirty in the evening. The school was not active from December 13th through April 30th,
reconvening on May 1st. At that time, the faculty of the Police School, which included several Davidson College faculty members,
a number of visiting experts, special agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and officials of the Mecklenburg County Police,
were again present to assist the officers in the final phases of their training. The members of the Administrative Committee
of the School are: Dr. C. K. Brown, dean of the faculty of Davidson College; Special Agent in Charge Edward
Scheidt, of the Charlotte Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation; Chief Stanhope Lineberry, Mecklenburg County Police; and Mr.
John L. Payne, Director of Public Relations, Davidson College.
