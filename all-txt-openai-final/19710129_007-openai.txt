The Sigs knocked off Cannon II 63-54 behind balanced scoring, with Bill Barnhill and Frank Clark each tallying 14 points and Bill McKenzie and Greg Gerdy adding 13 and 12, respectively.

The Betas rang up three wins to tie the Sigs. Randy Ely and Kevin Harkey netted 31 and 21 points, respectively, as the Betas edged the Gamms 74-71. John Willits hit 21 to pace the Gamms. Ely tallied 18 to lead a 54-50 win over the Pi Kaps. Pat Curley and Clint McCann scored 18 and 16, respectively, for the losers. Last Thursday, the Betas nipped the SAE’s 62-61, with Harkey collecting 23 points to spearhead the win.

The surprising SPE's ripped the Nu’s 81-30 to post their third straight win. Larry Duncan popped in 16 and Steve Suflas garnered 12 for the winners who led 42-9 at halftime. The E’s are 2-1 following the loss to the Betas, and in fourth place, a half-game ahead of the Independents, Cannon II, and East I, all 2-2.

In League B, the Pikas stretched their lead to one-and-a-half games with wins over Watts-Belk and East II. Jack Ballenger hit 14 points to lead three teammates into double figures in the 56-38 victory over Watts-Belk. Monday, the league leaders were forced to the limit before subduing East II 74-69. Floyd Strand gunned in 21 points as four Pikas hit twin figures to offset a 31-point barrage by freshman John Simms.

The Delts climbed into second with a 74-38 romp over the ATO’s. Mike Deese and Bob Lewis pitched in 11 and 10 points, respectively, for the winners.Winners, but game honors went to Tau Mitchell Johnson with 16. There is a four-way tie for third between the Machis, Taus, Gamms, and Watts-Belk, all at 2-2. The Machis rapped the KAs 71-57 after being bombed 83-46 by East I. John Saunders outdueled the KA’s Steve Williams 34-33 to pace the win. The high-scoring senior bucketed 28 against East II, but Mike Harding hit for 22 points and John Simms added 17 for the victors. The Taus won over the Pi Kaps 66-55 behind Johnson's 22 points. After the loss to the Delts, the Taus slipped past the Gamms, 53-48, as Jim Montgomery and Mort Chiles each tallied 16 points. Charlie Parks’ 15 points led the Gamms. The Gamms nipped Cannon I, 57-55, in addition to the Delt and Tau setbacks.

Eldon Basham pumped in 20 points and Frank Folger chipped in 15 more for the victors. Charlie Slagle put in 20 for Cannon II. East I dropped to 1-3 after the losses to Cannon II and the Pikas, but showed great potential in the rout of the Machis. The KAs are 0-3 after the loss to the Machis, a half-game out of the cellar, currently occupied by Cannon I by virtue of an 0-4 slate.

Cat Swimmers Beat J.C. Smith
By PETER MICHAEL
Sports Writer

Davidson's swimming team meets DeKalb College in Atlanta today, looking for their second straight win following a crushing victory over J.C. Smith. Saturday, the swimming team will meet Emory to complete their stay in Atlanta. Coach Tom Stevens is looking for victories, although he knows little about the opposing teams. Davidson's victory over J.C. Smith was by a 74-27 margin. Davidson was led by team captain Jim Newton, who captured first place in the 50 and 100 yard freestyle, and Jack Hobbs, who won the 200 yard backstroke and the 200 yard individual medley. Coach Stevens remarked that, “Some of the times weren't as good as they could be, and some were pleasing. You have to take into account the calibre of the competition. I was very pleased with the diving of Eric Vernon and John Knox." Vernon took Davidson's first first-place finish in diving competition. Other winning swimmers were Lee Guertler in the 500 yard freestyle, Greg Devane in the 1000 yard freestyle, John Fawcett in the 200 yard freestyle, and Raymond Grubb in the 200 yard. Davidson also captured the 400 yard freestyle and medley relays. In addition, Mait Browning unofficially won the 200 yard breaststroke, 33 seconds ahead of the nearest J.C. Smith man. He was not officially entered because Stevens had no wish to run up the score after the meet had already been won.
