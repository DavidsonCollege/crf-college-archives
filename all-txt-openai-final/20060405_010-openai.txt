**Singles night? Not for ladies**

The March 30 singles housing lottery resulted in an almost even number of women and men receiving singles—49 and 51,
respectively. After the lottery took place, 34 people ended up on the waitlist. Seems pretty fair, right? Wrong. RLO has
screwed up. Again.

While there is certainly an even distribution of male and female singles next year, many more women requested singles than
men. In plain terms: all 34 people on the singles waitlist are women. Under last week’s lottery, only 59 percent
of women received the singles they requested. Men fared better, as 100 percent of them received a single. This is
inexcusable. RLO should have anticipated potential gender interest disparities. While logistical considerations must be taken into account, RLO should have
been more creative and flexible in responding to student interest in single rooms.

For the Martin Court F housing lottery, students had to submit applications before the actual selection process began. This gave
RLO time to assess student interest in apartments. Since more men than women applied to live in F, RLO allowed
more male than female apartments. The result: 12 apartments will house men next fall and seven will house women. Such
an approach should have been applied to the singles lottery.

Most of Davidson’s singles (64) are located in Tomlinson Dormitory as eight-person pods. Had RLO made an additional female pod,
the percentage of females and males who received single rooms would have been more evenly distributed, 64 and 84 percent,
respectively. Instead, RLO took a pod that, by usual standards, would have been reserved for women, and offered it to
the men in line.

As expressed time and time again in these editorial pages, students often perceive RLO’s decisions as arbitrary. The handling of
the singles lottery only confirms—and perpetuates this perception. Simply put, RLO should be more aware of student perceptions and be
more fair in its decision making.

Davidson is a “residential college;” the school website touts the fact that 95 percent of students live on campus. To
keep campus residents satisfied, the school needs to do a better job of meeting student needs. When Duke re-opens in
2007, more singles and doubles will be available. But the fact that sophomores will live in senior apartments next year
is a pretty clear indication that seniors are choosing to live elsewhere. RLO’s actions in the coming year will likely
determine whether this year’s 50% increase in off-campus residents will be the beginning of a trend or the exception to
the rule.

**LETTERS TO THE EDITOR**

**Coverage of Outpost unjustified, biased**

Last week’s cover article on the future of CoHo’s house (“New neighbors on the Patterson Court scene,” Mar. 29) was,
for many Davidson students, an enormous disappointment. Its discussion of organizations vying for the house was horribly biased and completely
detrimental to the process that will soon take place as the school selects a group to fill the vacancy. All
eligible organizations who are interested in the house will be given opportunities to appeal to CCRL for recommendation to President
Vagt. The article inexplicably selected one of these potential groups, the movement for a new Outpost, and shamelessly promoted it
over all others by means of a full page of nostalgic photos and encouragements from alumni. The Davidsonian’s bold disregard
for the other potential groups has given these groups an overwhelming disadvantage. Its article, more closely resembling an editorial than
a balanced account, convinced readers that the Outpost is the best option for the campus. This perspective is as ridiculous
as it is unfounded; there are no current “leaders” in the competition for CoHo’s house because the process has yet
to even begin. I sincerely hope that future discussion within our community of this important matter will be notably more
evenhanded, giving each valuable student organization the respect it deserves.

Guest Columnist

The media? A fog of talk-show pundits, government leaks, advertisements, press releases, entertainment shows, magazines, and newspapers. Some appealing to
specific audiences with overt perspectives and prejudices, some striving for objectivity or neutrality. The news? Car chases, extended live coverage
of lottery winners, Michael Jackson’s latest deviance, gruesome murders, or boring stories about corporate takeovers, American political maneuverings, or distant,
complicated conflicts. Mostly inconsequential, disconnected stories that seem irrelevant to our lives. Buried somewhere within that barrage of information are
a few genuinely important...Stories or real news from credible sources. But usually, at the end of the day, I can
never quite remember exactly what I learned about the world or where I learned it, or if it was true.
I don’t think I’m alone. I think that we have forgotten how different real news is from all the other
types of information floating around the media. According to a 2004 survey at the Pew Research Center for the People
and the Press, 18- to 24-year-olds are spending less time watching, listening to, or reading traditional news sources than the
same age group 10 years ago. Less than a quarter of our age group reads a newspaper. Sixty-eight percent of
us “check in on the news from time to time,” while “just 29 percent watch or listen at regular times.”
On the Internet, “it has become increasingly common...to come across news inadvertently while online for other purposes...More than eight in
10 Internet users under age 30 (82 percent) say they inadvertently come across news online.” More and more, we are
running through the media haze, pursuing our specific informational interests and occasionally bumping into good, general news. At the same
time, we are bombarded with information and images, intentionally targeted by advertisers, political commentators, and others who want to shape
our interests and desires. This trend of unintentional news consumption poses a significant problem for our generation: all media becomes
confused with reliable news. We no longer hold the news apart. This trend is even more risky in a world
where not even all supposedly credible news sources are created equal. A 2003 report by the Program on International Policy
Attitudes at the University of Maryland about public perceptions of the Iraq war concluded that “a majority of Americans have
had significant misperceptions [about the war]...and that the frequency of those misperceptions varies significantly according to individuals’ primary source of
news.” The series of seven polls found overall that 80 percent of Fox viewers, 61 percent of ABC viewers, 47
percent of print readers, and 23 percent of NPR/PBS consumers held at least one of the following false assumptions: 1.
that evidence of links between Iraq and al Qaeda has been found, 2. that weapons of mass destruction have been
discovered in Iraq, or 3. that world public opinion favored the US going to war with Iraq. Eighty percent! The
recent three-year anniversary of our invasion of Iraq reminds us of the importance of this data. If you aren’t intentional
about seeking news, particularly from sources with records of good reporting, then you may end up sending your neighbors to
fight in a war under false pretenses. You may not get the full story on social security reforms, tax cuts,
or Guantanamo Bay prisoners. So why don’t we 18- to 24-year-olds seek out news regularly? The most common answer, especially
around Davidson College, is “too busy.” However, isn’t “too busy” really another way of saying “it’s not a priority?” So
why don’t we recognize the value of news anymore? I think it’s because we confuse real news gets lost in
the media haze. We no longer hold the news apart. But real news is different from other information in that
it is built on commitments to accuracy, reliability, truth-seeking, and fairness. Journalists try to provide a check to government and
power. The value of our consumption of news from credible sources with these values to the health of our democracy
cannot be overstated. My advice, my plea: intentionally read newspapers, in print or online. Read “The New York Times,” “The
Economist,” or “The Wall Street Journal” and listen to NPR when you’re in the car. Make it a priority now.
Don’t be misinformed. Don’t wade indiscriminately through the media haze like a zombie. And for God’s sake, don’t watch Fox
News. Adam Martin ’06 is a political science major from Dothan, AL. This op-ed was written for the Critical Issues

CORRECTIONS
“New sbtatibocs on the Patterson Court scene” (Mar. 29) was written by News Editor Kate Gillespie and Senior Staff Writer
Emily Kota. Vice President and Dean of Students Tom Shandley was quoted in “KA removed from campus until 2007” (Mar.
29) as saying “Frats have been struggling with this for decades.” The quote should have read “Fraternities have been struggling
with this for decades.” A graphic on page 5 accompanying the story “Committee begins process to select Pan-Hellenic sorority” (Mar.
23) was incorrect. Instead of printing the Zeta Phi Beta sorority letters, we printed the Phi Beta Sigma fraternity letters.
The dates of April at the Lake in “Davidson catches spring fever” (Mar. 29) were incorrect. The actual dates are
Apr. 22 (3 - 7 p.m.) and Apr. 27 (7 - 11 p.m.).
