FLASH!
(Continued from Page 1)

In the single instrumental boogie contest, R. E. Collinger received the first place award for trombonists. He and T. Dorsey played until they were both blue in the face before the judges could render a decision. Crew Mowens received an honorable mention award for the trumpet and was told by the judges to return to Davidson and practice a little more. He had hopes of winning the national award and receiving the name of “Hot Lips Mowens.”

After this day of going mad on their instruments, the band then went to the Hurricane Club and the bill was footed by the college. It is now their plan to invite high school bands here on a three-week session of jazz to be held in Shearer Hall under the national baton swinging champ, J. C. Prettycorny.

ATHLETIC SCHEDULES
(Continued from Page 1)

Students seem very adaptable to this game and it seems likely that inter-collegiate bridge tournaments will be scheduled with such schools as Elon.

There was quite a great deal of excitement at Coach Spittle’s seven o'clock phys ed class yesterday morning. It seems that a luckless fellow student had the misfortune to break his neck during a rousing game of murder ball. His last words were: “I regret that I have but one neck to give for my phys. ed. class.” As they were taking away the body, Coach Spittle was asked if he had a statement to make. He replied, (and I quote) Ha, Ha, Ha. (end of quote). This unfortunate incident did not, however, interrupt the game which was continued without further loss of life.

FLOOR SHOW
(Continued from Page 1)

P.M., and the last show, 3:00 A.M. The head hostess, a certain woman of mystery by the name of Miss Steal, says that the girls will stay in the “Y” Guest House and one will be able to find them there at all times when not in revue.

Mefoofsky Interviewed

Percy Bysshe Mefoofsky of the Senior Class is unique among Davidson students. Word being received at this office of his peculiar claim to fame, our wandering reporter went to his room at 76½ Rumple to interview him. We found him deeply engrossed in a weighty tome. Curiously we glanced at the title; it was Dr. M. E. Sentelle’s The Hegelian Dialectic and Its Relation to Donald Duck.

Percy peered at us vaguely. “Nothing like relaxing with some light reading,” he said. “Too true,” we replied. “You must get Santayana’s new work, The Idealism of Heels Buttons Fisher in Reference to Amour. An amazing charlatan, that Dr. Fisher.”

Mr. Mefoofsky put his book up and looked at us inquiringly. “Now, Percy, just what is your distinction? It must be unusual,” we said, “for Brown J. Philipson is green with envy; Neutron Fairyqueene can't sleep nights; and Marshall-Vernon Upperschild hasn’t eaten now for 4 days. Everyone but us seems to know your secret, but, you see, we have been—well—away for three weeks. You see, we had a box of Hershey bars sent to us by our aunt, Hezekibah Splooch, and we committed the faux pas of feeding them to our pet Gila monster, Murgatroyd, in front of Georgia. So we've been hiding out in the loft of the Cornelius Grand Opera House. But things are quiet now, and we are able to come to you and ask—WHO ARE YOU, REALLY, OH MAN OF MYSTERY?”

At this blunt query, the man calling himself Mefoofsky paled. His furtive pink eyes shifted uneasily. Then, it was as if a new idea struck him. He lifted his head; his eyes flashed proudly. We heard his heroic falsetto exclaim: “I am the only man in this college not in Omega Diddly Klappa!” And we bowed our head in awe.
