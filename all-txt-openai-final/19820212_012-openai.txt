Sister Introducing Brother to Big Church on Christmas Eve

This is Big Church where Grown-Ups come on Sunday so there are no toys. God lives here.

Daddy plays the organ. Mommy sings in the choir.

Sometimes you can hear the rest of the choir sing with Mommy.

Sometimes the people sing. Then we stand up and open this book and sing. The program says hymn 152. That means learn the one on page 152.

Mostly we just sit. Mommy says we can’t chew gum and we must be polite in a pew.

The man up front is the pastor. He tells stories every week about God and Jesus and reconciliation and smiles a lot. When you grow up you can be a pastor because he only works on Sunday when there’s nothing good on TV.

There’s lots of stuff to do while the pastor talks.

Like count those big round drains in the ceiling.

Or look at the stained glass windows and copy the pictures of God.

At the end, some men pass around big plates. We put money in them and if you're poor you can take some out and God gets the rest and I think he gives it to Santa Claus so he can make more toys.

Mommy says Santa will come after midnight if we're good and polite and act right in Big Church tonight.

Hey lady blue eye there’s a new sky.

It's wave-tray azure tint tablet for some metal flake initials and it’s lying next to your nose. That new sky is doing nothing. It’s lying, not laying. I can’t see if you are a blue-eye. I can’t see past your porta-sky and behind the plastic lenses...

you're looking past the metal flakes at me because my clear eyes have to squint on snow-lit days,
