**Students join nation in commemorating 9/11**

The Davidson community joined the rest of the nation on Saturday in commemorating the third anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks. In a service at noon at the Chambers flagpole, SGA President Katharine Hubbard ’04 addressed a gathering of students.

“We all remember where we were when we heard the news,” Hubbard said. “Three years have passed, but we still remember the horror of that day. We should be happy to be at Davidson where we’re loved and safe.”

The event, introduced to members of the campus community in the Crier as a “Patriot Day Memorial Service,” was the third annual commemoration of the events and the second such ceremony to be held at Chambers flagpole. Members of the Davidson College Army ROTC Color Guard processed with an American flag and raised it to half-staff to start the ceremony.

Chuck Ostendorff ’06 was part of the procession. “Participating in this ceremony is something meaningful to me, not just as a Davidson student or an American citizen. It reminds me that the cadets now in college could be fighting the War on Terror in the near future,” said Ostendorff.

College Chaplain Rob Spach closed the ceremony in prayer, calling for a unified and peaceful world and reminding those present that the memories of September 11 should not be forgotten. Spach recalled the reaction on campus to the initial news of the attacks three years ago and the gathering of students at the Alvarez College Union for mutual support. Spach also commented on the relatively small number of students present at this year’s ceremony. “Last year, many students stopped by the service on their way to class, but this did not occur this year because September 11 fell on a weekend,” he said.

Many students stood by the flagpole after the ceremony and reflected on their memories of September 11, 2001. Some shared stories of lost friends or accounts of how they first heard the news and where they were. “I watched both towers fall with my own eyes. While I did not lose any close friends, five of my brother’s and sister’s friends died that day,” said Amy Traynor ’07.

Davidson’s was only a small ceremony in comparison with other commemorative events that took place. In New York, families of those lost three years ago gathered at Ground Zero to remember their loved ones and to recite the names of all 2,749 victims. Four moments of silence were held: at 8:46, at 9:03, at 9:59, and at 10:29 a.m., the times when the two towers were hit and when they collapsed. The ceremony ended with a performance of Taps by a children’s choir and one trumpeter from the New York City Fire Department and one from the Police Department.

In Washington, a ceremony was held for the families of those lost in the Pentagon at a granite memorial in Arlington National Cemetery that lists the victims’ names. Meanwhile, at the field in Pennsylvania where Flight 93 crashed, two large bells were rung and the names of the 40 passengers and crew members were read.

Both President Bush and presidential candidate John Kerry gave speeches on Saturday which acknowledged the memory of the attacks and pledged to stop terrorism in the United States. The site of the World Trade Center is slowly changing to become more than a scarred, empty site as early stages of construction begin for the 1,776-foot Freedom Tower that is planned to be completed in 2009.

...enriched student life, enriched faculty members, and it takes the whole class up and enhances the education for everyone.”

Vice President of Academic Affairs & Dean of Faculty Clark Ross felt the same way. “The opportunity to perform research attracts better classroom teachers who are informed, up to date, and excited about their own research,” Ross said.

Sabbaticals and research and travel grants provided by the college enable teachers to conduct research, travel to professional meetings, purchase research equipment, and hire students as research assistants.Professor Herb Jackson is involved in research every day. He spends around four hours per day painting in his studio at home or on campus. “People think of research in terms of just books and papers,” he said. While on sabbatical in the fall of 2003, Jackson held two exhibitions: one of large paintings and drawings at the Christa Faut Gallery in Cornelius, and another of small oil paintings at the Hickory Museum of Art. Jackson also traveled to the Hawaiian Islands and produced eleven drawings using oil crayons. However, whether he is in Hawaii, France, or on the Baltic Sea, the art Jackson produces is different depending on where he is. Jackson linked faculty research to the phrase “practice what you preach.” “I don’t think I could demand the work ethic out of students if I wasn’t demanding the same from myself,” he said.

Joint faculty-student research is also strongly supported at Davidson. The small student body and absence of graduate students allow students to assist faculty with their research. “At a high-quality liberal arts college, research and teaching should be complementary,” said Ross. One example involves Mathematics Professor Laurie J. Heyer, Biology Professor A. Malcolm Campbell, and a group of Davidson students. They have spent the past four summers developing MAGIC Tool, which stands for Micro Array Genome Imaging and Clustering Tool. MAGIC Tool is a software program that is used to analyze biological data through a two-part analysis of image and clustering. This program also has the advantage of being able to run on any type of computer.

“In 2000, I started thinking about how useful software like this would be, and obtained funding from the Faculty Study and Research grant program to start work on it in Summer 2001 with one student, Physics major Adam Abele ’03,” said Heyer. Abele and Moskowitz completed the program in the summer of 2003. Campbell offered feedback from a biologist’s point of view and promoted the program through biological professional organizations. During the summer of 2004, Heyer traveled to different universities to teach people how to use the program. “People could not believe that this software was developed by a small group of undergraduate students,” she said. Similar software is available commercially, but colleges and universities cannot always afford the $5,000-$20,000 price tag. The software developed at Davidson, in addition to being free, is the only program that offers the two-part analysis.

Mac Cowell ’06 will be performing research with Heyer this fall. “The one-on-one interaction with the professor, the challenge and creativity involved in creating something that is unique and novel and may contribute to the world - it all works to get me fired up and enthusiastic about something, and as a result, I learn a lot,” said Cowell.

Professor Russell Crandall of the Political Science department is in Washington, D.C. for the 2004-2005 academic year. In Washington, Crandall is working at the U.S. Department of Defense as an advisor on Latin American security affairs and writing a book. “My main task is to synthesize intelligence reports with my broader understanding of the region. In other words, it is like taking a couple of disparate novels and condensing them into a Readers’ Digest version,” he said.

Life in Washington D.C. is proving to be very different from life at Davidson for Crandall. “Unlike an academic setting, such as Davidson, where professors largely act independent of each other, in the government bureaucracy there are endless numbers of procedures and inter-agency processes that need to be followed. Key policy-makers spend much of their workday, which usually includes weekends, attending meeting after meeting,” Crandall said.

Crandall is writing a book on the U.S. interventions in the Dominican Republic, Grenada, and Panama. He is also co-editing volumes on Mexico's political economy, and security and democracy in the Andes.
