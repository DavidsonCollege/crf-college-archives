**ROTC, from page 1**

Cadet of the Month. In order to attain these titles, a cadet must go before a board of military and
ROTC program representatives and answer a series of military-themed questions. For each cadet, the awards represent years of dedication to
the program. Lee, who was attracted to Davidson because of its ROTC program, says his devotion comes from both his
admiration for the program and his desire to have a strong role in planning his future.

“I’ll have more control over what I do after [ROTC] if I put more into it now,” says Lee. “I
care about the program here, and I want to see it succeed.” Lee, who holds the highest leadership position in
the Davidson program, has ambitions to study International Relations and eventually to attend law school after his time in the
army. As for his involvement in the army, Lee would most like to be involved with the Military Intelligence Branch
and the Special Forces, two fields that he says are “based on regions of the world in which it’s necessary
to have a concept of International Politics.”

Perry began her ROTC career during the second semester of her first year at Davidson, after she attended a guest
PT session that gave her a taste of what the program was like. “Military service had been in the back
of my mind for a long time,” says Perry. “I realized after talking to [former ROTC leader Major Bill Geiger]
that ROTC was really something I wanted to do.” Her next semester at Davidson, Perry took part in the Beaufort
Plus program, a Davidson-sponsored “study abroad” program focusing on marine biology. When Perry returned, she became squad leader, along with
Lee.

in the program, so we had to step up,” Perry says. This semester, Perry is the 49er Battalion’s Command Sergeant
Major, the battalion’s third-highest rank. The position, which Perry refers to as the “top of the chain.”“of information,” involves communicating
with each squad in the battalion’s six schools, maintaining high morale among the cadets, and making sure that program standards
are being met. Lee and Perry will likely hold the battalion’s top positions next semester. In the meantime, both cadets
plan to attend the National Advanced Leadership Course this summer in Fort Lewis, Washington. Perry’s future plans include attending a
Cadet Troop Leadership Training program in Mannheim, Germany, in which she will “shadow” a Second Lieutenant at a base there.
Ultimately, Perry would like to join an aviation unit and fly helicopters. She is currently studying for the AFAST (Alternate
Flight Aptitude Selection Test), which she calls “the SATs of flying,” a critical step in pursuing her goal of becoming
a pilot. Both cadets credit their success in ROTC to strong leadership within the program, especially that of Major Leslie.
“He’s all about our success, and making us do things the best we can,” says Lee.

Lee and Perry continue to devote much of their time and effort to ROTC and the military life. For them,
the army lifestyle is unparalleled by anything that normal life has to offer. “After I graduate, it’s a way I
can make a difference and give something back to my country,” says Perry. “I wouldn’t be fulfilled with a regular
9-5 job.”

Isn’t that the ‘Back to the Future’ car? Yes, it’s one of two DeLoreans owned by sophomore Joe Palatinus ’05.

On this SUV-dominated campus, one car stands out: the DeLorean, as in the car from “Back to the Future,” owned
and driven by Davidson’s own Joe Palatinus ’05. The DeLorean comes in only one shade—stainless steel—and features the famous gull-wing
doors. Palatinus says this stylish portal does not in any way impede parking or entering and exiting the vehicle. The
only problem posed relates to automatic doors sometimes locking them inside the vehicle.

With the whopping 4300 cubic centimeters of storage space—conveniently located under the hood—Palatinus can take this baby to places a
Nissan Xterra wouldn’t dare to tread, though friends cannot tag along since it lacks a back seat. As the last
models hit the roads in 1983, tape decks come standard. Manufacturing laws cap the speedometer at 85 mph, yet DeLoreans
can apparently make it up to 120 mph in optimal conditions. How could this timeless machine ever have gone out
of production? Regardless, DeLoreans can be found today among an aesthetically evolved class of car owners. As Palatinus found out,
DeLoreans are obtainable with a bit of effort. In research for a school project, he discovered a DeLorean for sale
but a few miles away. He jumped at the chance and now his family proudly owns not one, but two
such beauties. Should you be interested, DeLoreans can be found for sale on the Internet, and, unlike new cars, their
value remains relatively constant over the years. With a Volvo engine and a stainless steel body, DeLoreans are dependable machines
that have survived the test of time remarkably well. But really, who needs a practical reason—owning a DeLorean is like
having a piece of cinematic history in your garage, and you know that, deep down, you wish you had one
too.
