Weak Frosh Lose To Strong Senior Team

In the first contest of the inter-class basketball series, a strong senior team swamped the hapless and unorganized freshmen by a 50-17 score. The Centennials were led by Captain Bankhead with fourteen points while Faison and Anderson each accounted for 10 counters. Joyner, although playing only part of the game, led the losers with 7 points followed by King and Ragsdale with 4 each. The seniors took the lead from the beginning and were never pushed as they scored almost at will. They will offer stiff competition for the juniors and sophs and will be right in the race for the class championship.

Davidson Funds to Aid In Lighting Mutoto Mission
By Charles L. Crane

NOTE: Dr. Crane, '07 in charge of the Mutoto Mission in the Belgian Congo, to which will go the A. Christmas Gift Fund.

“First of all, I wish to express sincere and hearty...Appreciation to the Y. M. C. A. Cabinet for the warm response to the request that the students’ contributions this year go toward the completion of the light plant at Mutoto Station. Funds for lighting the Morrison Bible School and the hospital.

“Some years ago, the need for a light plant at Mutoto became so acutely apparent, a careful survey was made of the available water. It was hoped that a plant could be erected which would furnish both lights and water. However, certain factors...

The Hospital at Mutoto, as in all Mission Africa, provides a work that challenges the full efforts of Dr. and Mrs. Smith, with the native nurses. This building has no lighting facilities whatsoever, and with only a few kerosene lanterns, the doctor and nurse have to find their way at night with a flashlight. With the funds now on hand, together with the students’ contribution, it may be possible not only to provide the lights for the Hospital and Bible School, but a small X-ray equipment for the Hospital as well.

“It is only necessary to add that every loyal Davidson alumnus will join with me in gratitude to the students for their gift this year to Africa.”

WATTS AND GEORGIA MEET
(Continued from Page 4)

Rats before the game this passing from pre-game ballyhoo scan the tentative lineups, first the Rats: RE, Wilson; RT, Cade; RG, Parker; C, Faison; LG, Barnes; LT, Fryfogle; LE, Cook; Q, Hornbeck; RH, Dickson; LH, Edwards; F, Carlson. The line averages 160 pounds and the backfield 155. A statement from the Rat coaching staff reveals that “in fair weather we have had time to teach our tactics and the finer points of the sport. With this ability as coaches, we therefore look for a close battle against our opponents.”

Due is Captain Sellars of the Hounds: “Our line is especially strong and heavy, averaging 175 to 180 pounds per man. Men are anxious to go and I feel we will stop Georgia cold and win by at least one touchdown.” The line: RE, Hall; RG, Parker; C, Jones or Summerell; LG, Wallace; LT, Cline; LE, Mosely; Q, Verner; RH, Walker or Hickman; LH, Long; F, Sellars; RT, Wynn.

...for ’em. Buddy, I can’t pay a higher compliment than that. Girl or cigarette... when I tumble that means I’m Chesterfield’s my cigarette. And I'll tell all hands they’ve got a hearty good taste that makes a sailor happy. And listen, they’re milder... for the good things a cigarette can give a sailor.
