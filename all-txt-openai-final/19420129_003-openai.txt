Library Begins Book Campaign Tomorrow

Dr. Davidson Makes Plans For Victory Campaign

Books for soldiers, sailors, and marines will be collected in the dormitories this weekend. Dr. Davidson, Director of the Library,
has received literature on the Victory Book Campaign from the state headquarters in Greensboro and has replied to requests for
cooperation. An announcement will be made in chapel and a student committee formed to visit each dormitory room to collect
books from students who have any they wish to contribute. Popular novels, humorous books, books on sports, music, scientific texts
if not earlier than 1935, biography, plays, poetry, if over five years old are useful. In fact, the type of
books wanted is that which would be of interest to young men of military service age. No magazines are asked
for as they are comparatively easy to get near the camps. If any prefer to give cash, this can be
used for the campaign managers to purchase books.

The Victory Book Campaign is sponsored by the American Library Association, the American Red Cross, and the United Service Organization
for National Defense. It is a nationwide undertaking and many colleges nearby have already begun work. National Headquarters are in
Room 1630, Empire State Building, New York, but collections made in Davidson are to be sent to the state headquarters
in Greensboro. This will be handled through the college library as far as students, faculty members, and officers of the
administration are concerned.

Purposes of the campaign as stated in the official literature are: (1) To collect gifts of books for soldiers, sailors,
and marines as a supplement to the library services maintained by the Army and Navy in forts, camps, posts, stations,
and on ships; (2) to provide reading matter for the U.S.O. houses outside the camps and for the American Merchant
Marine Library Association; (3) if the supply is more than adequate, to provide books for men, women, and children in
areas where industrial activities have increased population so that existing library resources are inadequate or nonexistent.

All Contribute

All students, faculty members, and officers of the administration are requested to go through their books and see if they
have items of interest to the causes to be served. College library assistants will visit the dormitories to ask for
these books. An announcement will be made in chapel concerning details. Faculty and administrative officers are asked to bring their
contributions to the college library and turn them over to the desk assistant. They should be marked “Books for Victory
Book Campaign.” Students may do the same if they are out when called upon in the dormitory.

MIDWINTERS DANCE SET [Continued from Page One]

will have great popular appeal because of his versatility. Powell is said by experts to have a knack of creating
moods for dancers, because of the fact that his arrangements are so brilliantly and intricately executed, and also because of
his excellent rhythm. For this reason, he is extremely popular with college dancers, as is evidenced by the fact that
he is playing for the famous Washington and Lee Fancy Dress Ball on Thursday of this week, and the rest
of the weekend at V.P.I. Besides the fourteen pieces in his band, Powell is bringing with him two vocalists: Peggy
Mann, “dynamic song stylist,” and Dick Judge, “romantic baritone.” Included in the aggregation is a “Band within a band,” the
“Six Teddy Bears,” an organization similar to Benny Goodman’s famous sextet. Also featured is “Feather” Austin, sizzling trumpeter, who has
been compared favorably by many with Harry James and Bunny Berigan.

Phi Installs New Leaders

Bill MacLauchlin was installed as the new president of the Philanthropic Society at the monthly meeting of the group Tuesday
evening, January 27 in the society hall. Other new officers for the second semester include George Ogilvie, vice-president; Buddy Wells,
secretary; John McLeod, first critic; Joe Hopper, second critic; and Paul Kissling, sergeant-at-arms. Jim White will continue to serve as
treasurer, since this office is held for the whole year.

MacLauchlin made the customary inaugural speech following his installation as the occupant of the president's chair. He pointed out what
the aims of the society should be and what accomplishments he would attempt during the present administration.

Bill has been active in Y.M.C.A. work during his years at Davidson. At present, he is on the “Y” Board
of Control and serves on the “Y” Cabinet as the head of boy's work and community service. He has worked
among the negroes, has taken part in establishing new scout troops, and has led the Gray-Y work in some of
the schools of Charlotte. President MacLauchlin was elected a member of the Election Board last fall and is a member
of Eta Sigma Phi, honorary classical fraternity. He was second critic of the Phi Society last semester. Ex-President Tom Plonk
announces that a prize will be awarded to the member of the society who wrote the best prose paper during
the first semester. These papers are being judged by members of the faculty.

Speakers Set For Services

Announcement of forthcoming Vespers Services has come to The Davidsonian from the President's office. On February 1st, this Sunday night,

‘42 Riflemen Set Matches

More emphasis will be placed on the rifle squad as a representative team of the college in this year's competition,
according to Lieutenant Spencer, of the R.O.T.C. department. There will be an improved schedule for the sharpshooters, and there are
several prospects “loosening up their trigger finger” on the target range at the armory. Nine shoulder-to-shoulder matches have already been
scheduled, three more are being planned for, and there will be postal matches (in which scores are compared by mail)
with such representative schools as University of Pittsburgh, Georgia Tech, University of Georgia, University of Hawaii, and others. Veterans of
last year’s team who will be firing again this season are: Stubbins; Kerr; Jones; Gowdy; Yocum; McArthur; Wilson, R.D.;

SIGMA UPSILON

The Davidson chapter of Sigma Upsilon, the national honorary journalistic fraternity, met on Friday night in the Phi Gamma Delta
House. The program consisted of papers by several of the members. Harwell Darby gave his initiatory paper on “Journalism.” Following
this was a stream of consciousness paper on a morbid soul by Bill Sprunt. Bill Lyman read the chapter epic,
“The Mallory.” From the book he is writing concerning the psychology of Nazism and Behaviorism, Dr. Williamson read one of
his chapters. After the papers, the members treated themselves to a round of refreshments.

Bryant Weds

James Robert Bryant, Jr., a member of the present senior class, was married to Miss Sarah Elizabeth Brownlee, last Saturday
night at the home of the bride’s parents, Mr. and Mrs. W. Frank Brownlee, of Charlotte. Dr. William Harrison Williams,
pastor of the Pritchard Memorial Baptist Church, officiated at the ceremony. The vows were spoken in the living room of
the Brownlee home on Lexington Avenue.

The bride was given in marriage by her father. Her sister, Miss Frances Brownlee, served as maid of honor. The
bridegroom had as his best man, a member of the freshman class at Davidson. Both are members of the freshman
class at Davidson.

New Courses

A course on public speaking is being offered to Juniors and Seniors during the coming semester. This course is to
be taught by Prof. C.K. Brown. Because of uncertainty as to the number of students that will take this course,
it is still in its experimental stage. Depending upon the demand for public speaking, Prof. Brown is not certain whether
he will continue the course.and will continue to teach the course. Bob Bryant is also a member of Sigma Delta
Pi, honorary Spanish fraternity, of which he is secretary. Applied math will be taught by Professor Wood, and meteorology by
Professor Fulcher. Students entering the army before next fall will have the opportunity to get these courses.

Bob Bryant is also a member of Sigma Delta Pi, honorary Spanish fraternity, of which he is secretary. He also
represented Beta Theta Pi on the Pan-Hellenic Council. This Phi Mu Alpha concert will be presented in early February in
Chambers Auditorium.

K-Sigs Visit Buzzie Councill. Brother Dick Copedge, laid up with an injured left wing, was left behind. Also making the
trip were pledges Durant and Ford, Frosh Grapplers Butch Caldwell, Claude Hackney, and Bob McLeod. Brother Henderson went to Chapel

spent a quiet weekend at home, while Brother Hay was being well entertained. Brother Bobbitt was seen at the usual
evening’s entertainment in Charlotte.

The chapter regrets to say that we are losing three upperclassmen because of the world situation: Dick Manning, Dick Smith,
and Tommy Yarborough are leaving. These men will be missed greatly.

Phi Gamma Delta Celebrations were in order last weekend not so much because the student body passed the exams, but
