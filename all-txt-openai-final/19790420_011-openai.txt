Al Rhyne was the QB in last Friday's spring game for the White team. The Black team, with Brian Whitmire
at the helm, won 17-7.

### Thirty Tryout for Cheerleading Squad
By BERT MOBLEY, Sports Editor

Think back to the basketball game against UT-Chattanooga that was played in Johnston Gym this past winter. The Wildcats won
70-64, but John Gerdy’s 36 points were not the only reason. The Wildcat fans helped a lot, too. The students
were yelling so loud and furiously that the poor Moccasins were intimidated beyond hope. The Chattanooga coach was yelling his
lungs out, but the kids on the bench could not hear him.

If vociferous crowds have anything to do with winning games, then the cheerleaders are in a large way responsible for
victories. The role of the cheerleader is an important one, and about thirty people are hoping that they can be
off-court and on the sidelines next year, keeping the crowd excited and helping the Cats on to victory. Tryouts will
be held this Friday afternoon at 2 p.m. at Richardson Field. Approximately 18 of the 30 are girls and the
rest are boys. Seven boys and seven girls will be chosen. There were only 12 on the squad this season.
A majority of this year’s hopefuls are freshmen.

Doug Crosby explained that all 30 will have to try out whether they were on the squad this past year
or not. Both Crosby and Coach Barbara Biedenbach agree that last year’s squad was the best ever and this year’s
will be even better. If the squad is going to be better, then rest assured that tryouts will be more
difficult than ever. The hope-to-be cheerleaders will have completed a two-week clinic before Friday to prepare themselves for the tryouts.

“Tryouts this year are a lot rougher than ever before. We're asking more, and I'm very impressed with the people,”
Crosby said. He continued, “They have been catching on quickly and are willing to try anything even though they may
be scared.”

There will be three categories of competition in the tryouts. The people will be judged on stunts, cheers and chants,
and dancing (girls only). The judges will also be looking for good posture and the way that one presents himself.
Two seniors, Rick Kelley and Debbie Jo Bumgarner, will be judging along with Mrs. Biedenbach and Mrs. Denise Fry. Both
Biedenbach and Fry were, at one time, captains of the N.C. State cheerleading squad.

The squad that will be chosen will have a busy fall and winter next year. Crosby said that the group
will definitely go to more away games and play a bigger part. There will also be a workshop coming up
this summer for the ones that make the team. All 14 will go to a cheerleading camp, probably at UT-Knoxville.
Most of the guys will also go to a gymnastics camp at Knoxville.

The acquiring of Mrs. Biedenbach has been important to the squad according to Crosby. “She helps us with ideas and
gives us constructive criticism. We would not be as good as we are without Barbara Biedenbach,” Crosby said.

The Davidson cheerleaders proved the importance of spirit and just plain noise in the win over Chattanooga. But the squad
wants to do even more next year. Crosby feels this way, “Cheerleaders can be an integral part in the way
a game goes. Especially in basketball, there is more of a one-to-one contact with the players. The cheerleaders become like
a part of the team.”

### Cats Hope to Impress Pro Scouts
By MIKE LINS, Staff Writer

Davidson is not respected nationally as a stepping-stone into the minor leagues of baseball. In fact, in the recent past,
only three players have signed with professional teams: George Weicker (Cincinnati), Tim Barr (Atlanta), and Stan Brown (Pittsburgh). This statistic,
however, does speak well for Davidson’s program considering no scholarships are given in baseball.

This past week at a home doubleheader against Western Carolina University, five professional scouts viewed the games hoping to find
new talent from Davidson and WCU. WCU won the first game 4-0 while the Wildcats bounced back to win the
second game 7-2. Both games provided an impressive show for the interested scouts since both teams had outstanding players.

In the first game, WCU pitcher Rick Adair, a hard-throwing left-hander, allowed seven hits spread throughout seven innings to shut
out the Cats. The Wildcat hitting was led by sophomore third-baseman Cam Zurbruegg who had two singles against Adair and
added two more singles in the second game. Zurbruegg’s four-for-six hitting perpetuates his strong hitting; he now leads the Cats
at the plate. Senior left-fielder Tim McDowell also had four-for-six hits and had two stolen bases. Sophomore John Porter hit
three-for-six at the plate and likewise stole two bases. Junior catcher Bob Lapple, who has impressed scouts all season, continued
to show his skills.

### Trackers Lose
By ROB GILLISON, Assistant Sports Editor

Davidson’s men’s track team finished their dual meet season with a 107½ to 55½ loss to the Citadel. Although the
team was soundly defeated, there were some outstanding individual performances. Phil Gilbert took first in the 200-meter race. Lance Sisco
won the 110-meter high hurdles, and Mike Heinig won the javelin toss. John Hoots and John Stroud set personal records
in the 1500 and 400-meter races respectively. Each took second place.In their event, Coach Karl Kremzer praised the work of
Dave Nichols, who played impeccable defense by throwing out two opposing runners at second base. Lapple hit two singles in
the second game against WCU. Senior pitcher Ron Cannon hurled the winning game for the Cats, allowing only four hits
with one earned run. Cannon, a strong-throwing left-hander, has started for the Cats since his freshman year. His 2-4 record
this year does not adequately reflect his hurling ability. Cannon definitely has good control and a wicked curveball, but his
fastball may lack the velocity needed to interest the scouts any further. Throughout the double-header, the scouts saw a lot
of action at its best. Hopefully, some of the players mentioned have shown the scouts enough to someday be seen
among the pro ranks. Splitting in the double-header moves the Cats to a 2-6 Conference record with a 7-16 record
overall. This Friday, the Cats face the Citadel in a double-header at Charleston.

Citadel took second in the hammer and won the discus. "Dave has become a fine weight man through sheer determination
and hard work. I’m sure he’ll set the school record in the hammer by next year (his junior year)," Kremser
said. The team is now looking forward to the Southern Conference Tournament. "We won't score a lot of points, but
we do have some strong individuals who will do well," he said. Kremser also added, "This year should be judged
on personal achievement rather than dual meet record. We've got some people who are really breaking through and should be
outstanding next year."

It is lamentable that in this age of mass media sports, the announcers and color men have become such a
big part of the game. It is even more lamentable that these commentators are so bad. I might also note
that it would be fruitless (maybe impossible) to try and name a top group of sports announcers on the airwaves.
Therefore, in the spirit of the Academy Awards (and a certain Davidsonian centerpiece), I would like to award our major
network commentators on the basis of their lack of ability, ranging from the repulsive to the inane.

The first category is Worst Ex-Jock Commentator. The nominees are:
- Oscar Robertson: The worst announcer in the history of the NBA.
- Joe Garagiola: He shows us that one needn't be a successful jock to be a bad announcer.
- Alex Hawkins: He proved once and for all that people with Southern accents aren’t intelligent enough to handle jobs
that require even a minimal amount of intelligence.
- Al DeRogatis: His "left-right double deep zig-out with a twist-a-flex corner turn on 3" analysis of most pass patterns
and his general obnoxious manner merited firing long before it actually happened.
- Bones McKinney: Bones proves to us that even if you’ve been away from playing long enough to learn something
about broadcasting, you can still be inept.
- Johnny Unitas: I’m beginning to wonder if anyone this stupid could really have been a good QB.

The Winner: Al DeRogatis. How can you argue with this choice? He was awful.

Next is Worst Minor Sports Commentator. The nominees are:
- Dick Button: It’s bad enough that they put figure skating on TV, but he sure likes to babble on
about it.
- Chris Schenkel: He’s versatile. He does everything poorly.
- Chris Economaki: No, I can’t spell his name. Not only that, I don’t want to know how to. Not
only that, stock car racing isn’t even a sport.
- Jim McKay and Bill Fleming: I can’t tell them apart and they’re both boring.

The Winner: Chris Schenkel. He’s the worst of a bad lot. If it’s any consolation, Chris, there isn’t anyone anywhere
any worse.

The last category is Worst Baseball Commentator. This is a hard group to pare down. But here are the nominees.
They are the bottom of the cream of a really bad crop, or something like that.
- Mel Allen and Bob Prince: Even if they don’t win this award, they can take heart that they’ve been
bad for longer than anyone here.
- Tony Kubek: Tony’s a notch above the Ex-Jocks I mentioned before. That’s no compliment.
- Curt Gowdy: Curt once claimed that Bobby Grich was the only major leaguer without a vowel in his last
name. He has made some intelligent remarks in his career, though, just not any in the last five years.
- Joe Garagiola: You just can't leave him out.

The Winner: Curt Gowdy, hands down.

That concludes these rather uncomplimentary awards. I add that the omission of any particular announcers is not meant to be
construed that they are any good either, but that they must have a clown.
