TWO CARLOADS OF COAL WILL BE SECURED

Despite all rumors to the contrary, there will be no holiday for Davidson students on account of the scarcity of coal. Mr. Jackson, when interviewed, blew up all hopes by smiling and reading the following statement from the Clinchfield Fuel Company:

“We hope to get you out another car of coal by tomorrow (January 18) or Saturday at the outside, and it should reach you in ample time for your requirements; and we will get off another if nothing very serious does not happen.”

Of course, with railroad traffic demoralized, it is not certain when the first car will reach here, but alas! there is at least hope.

L. M. CURRIE LEADS CHRISTIAN ENDEAVOR

The College Christian Endeavor Society held its regular meeting in Shearer Hall on Sunday evening at 6:10. The meeting was led by L. M. Currie. The Scripture reading was taken from Galatians 6:1-10. The subject suggested by the reading was “Young Christians Looking Forward.” In the discussion that followed, the idea was brought out that young Christians must press on and aspire to greater things, forgetting what is behind them, and looking forward that they may grow in grace and knowledge. The officers elected for the spring...term are E. G. Lilly, President; G. W. Brown, Vice-President; and J. E. Cassell, Secretary and Treasurer. 

Spring. At least three weeks’ supply in the college bins. It has been decided to discontinue the heating of the gymnasium, as this is not absolutely necessary. The outlook for the town is not so bright. There is very little coal in the yards and a great many unfilled orders on the books. Coal is being sold only in half-ton lots and less, as there is no certainty as to when the next shipment will reach here. The townspeople are urged to use the utmost economy in burning their coal, and to co-operate with the local dealers in every possible way.
