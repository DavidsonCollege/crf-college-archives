Doug Jobe, newly elected president of the SGA, is ready to work for and with Davidson—the college and the community.
In an interview with The Davidsonian, he shared some of his plans for his year in office.

“One of the things I want to do is build more unity on campus to increase our outlook and make
ourselves feel better. Our school is more unified than most, but it can be even stronger. And through our being
more unified I think we can increase our general morale on campus,” said Jobe. “I feel that we study in
a great environment with this community [the town of Davidson] and I feel that we should try to give something
back. I think we need to give something back and show our appreciation for the environment we have.”

Jobe includes more group social events with Patterson Court houses and establishing a spirit contest at basketball games among organizations
in his plans for campus interaction. Speaking about the relationship of the college to the town, Jobe said, “I want
more interaction between the SGA and the community. Another thing I’m looking into along with the Union, is establishing a
student-run carnival for the children of the community in which students, faculty, administration, SGA, the Union and Patterson Court could
all come together and show our appreciation and all have fun in the process.”

What experiences motivated Jobe to seek the SGA presidency? “I’m the type of person who likes doing things for other
people,” said Jobe. “Because I love this school so much, I wanted to give something back to it. When I
came in, it was fantastic. I want to make it even better so others can cherish it as much as
I do in future years.”

This past year Jobe has served as a SGA house representative and as a SGA representative to the faculty committee
on Education Policy. He is also a hall counselor.

“After watching Tripp Helms this year in SGA, I realized what a phenomenal job he had done. I felt like
I knew what needed to be done to do a job as well as Tripp, if his could even be
matched. From that experience I feel well-endowed to be able to give the student body a president that is capable
of representing them really well and helping to bring out their best interests.”

Jobe believes that students can and need to play a significant role in student government. “Students need to realize that
SGA can be a force for them. If we can all come together through SGA, since we are all broken
up in eating houses, classes, majors, we can accomplish things for ourselves, all in a positive manner,” Jobe stressed.

“I would like to encourage all the students to get involved and feel like the SGA is a form of
expression for them and to use it to the best of their ability by contacting me, their own representatives, or
Kristi [Kessler] about points they feel need to be discussed. More importantly, SGA meetings are open and I more than
encourage people to come to just sit in and hear what's going on on campus or to express a viewpoint.
I want as much open communication and student involvement as possible. That’s how we accomplish better things.”

Jobe hopes he and the SGA can “accomplish better things” in the next year by tackling campus issues such as
divestment from South Africa, the revision of the semester system and campus security. On divestment and security, Jobe stated, “I
would feel that most of the campus is for Davidson College to divest, and personally I would feel that it
is a tragedy that we haven't divested yet. Basically, from what I understand from the Trustee’s meeting, the Trustees are
discussing some action and they fully understand the disgruntled nature of most of the students about our investments as a
college into South Africa. I see it developing into a large issue on campus. The SGA will seriously consider the
issue, and although it’s a big issue, I’m confident that action will be taken.”

Jobe also stressed the need to increase and improve campus security: “I’m confident that the lighting will be updated and
security will be greatly improved over the next year. Great strides have already been made this year. My main focus
is to instate a viable escort service on campus such that the availability is there at any time and such
that students don’t have to worry about their own security late at night when they cross campus. The escort service
must be viable such that everyone on campus knows that it works and that it’s for their own good. By
increasing security, we can make ourselves feel more secure, make ourselves feel better and feel better about the school, thus,
increasing our general outlook on student life.”

In conclusion, Jobe wished to add his appreciation to the student body for “giving me this opportunity by this show
of confidence in me. I’m very honored and hope to give everything possible to serve the best interests of the
student body.”
