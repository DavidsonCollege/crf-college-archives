- Improving the academic quality of the student body, since applicants with stronger academic qualifications would fill spots currently taken by football players.
- Enabling more aggressive recruitment of minority students who do not play football through substantial savings in need-based financial aid.
- Increasing our chances of getting into a conference such as the CAA or the Sun Belt by improving women’s sports.

Disadvantages include:
- Losing a traditional sport with a devoted following in some quarters.
- Losing a program that has helped to recruit and retain minority students.
- Uncertainty of long-term prospects for success in other sports in Division I given our small size [relative to the size of other Division I schools].

Option #5. Drop football and move to Division III.

THE DAVIDSONIAN

We would save $1.06 million, enabling us to add the $350,000 to women’s sports necessary for a 54/46 ratio and the $340,000 for the new athletic complex with $370,000 to spare.

Advantages include:
- Sufficient funds to improve the physical education program and build new intramural fields.
- NCAA regulations would permit us to showcase one men’s and one women’s sport so long as they are not basketball.
- The academic quality of the student body would improve, since applicants with stronger academic qualifications would fill spots currently taken by football players.

For disadvantages see above under options #3 and #4.

Recommendations

In light of the announcement on 29 November 1988 that the trustees will vote in December on a committee recommendation to move football to Division III (option #2 above), we recommend:
1. That the faculty affirm its strong support for physical education and competitive athletics as a vital part of a Davidson liberal arts education [Amended: and its appreciation of the positive contribution of student athletes to the life of the college];
2. That the faculty affirm its belief in fair treatment of all students and its hope that Davidson will soon become a model for equity in men’s and women’s athletics;
3. That the faculty instruct the Faculty Admissions Committee to admit only academically qualified students;
4. That the faculty urge the trustees to adopt an athletics policy consistent with Davidson's overall commitment to academic excellence.

Given Davidson's goal of national recognition for academic excellence among liberal arts colleges, we believe the most appropriate goal for Davidson athletics is competitiveness among liberal arts colleges--that is, within Division III. If the Trustee Committee on Athletic Policy’s recent recommendation to move football to Division III is a first step toward Division III for all sports, it is a step in the right direction. But if the trustees do not intend to move the entire athletics program to Division III, we believe this decision will have to be reconsidered. The savings from moving football to Division III will not suffice to treat women fairly and operate the new athletic facility without cutting the basketball budget (the only other source for significant savings within the athletics department). Budget cuts in the basketball program will hamper basketball’s competitiveness in Division I. If the trustees wish to keep basketball in Division I, they may yet have to end intercollegiate competition in football. We therefore recommend:

Text of the Report of the Faculty Committee on Intercollegiate Athletics

5. That the faculty urge the trustees to create immediately a task force to study the role of physical education and competitive athletics at Davidson. What would physical education, intramural and intercollegiate programs and budgets look like under Division I and under Division III? This task force might include members of the athletics department as well as representatives of the Trustee and Faculty Committees on Athletic Policy and Educational Policy. It should make its recommendations in time for consideration in the 1990-91 budget.
6. That the faculty ask President Kuykendall to see that all trustees receive a complete copy of this report, including recommendations and appendices, prior to their upcoming December meeting.

REPORT, from page 1

Case said, “Most people seemed to support most of the points in the recommendation. Basically the differences in the dollar figures associated with the different possible strategies were a surprise. I don’t know that it was so much a surprise as an enlightenment.”

Assistant professor of economics Chris Bell found the numbers in the report to be “eye-opening.” “I had never realized what the per-athlete expenses were,” he said, referring in particular to the $38,700 per basketball player. “It amounts to more than what an assistant professor makes.”

Kazee agreed with the report’s conclusions, “For the most part I do. The report does not make a strong recommendation for one of those very narrow options, as I interpreted it, but it does make clear that if Davidson is to comply with Title IX and maintain its academic excellence, certain options are less consistent with those goals. The report is careful in making it clear that Davidson will have some very difficult questions to answer if it maintains its program as it currently does,” he said. “About the only way that Davidson can do that is...to dramatically increase its spending for athletics, which would be difficult to justify. What made the report most helpful, I thought, was that it made pretty clear what the costs and benefits for each option were to the college with regard to athletics.” Bell agreed. “I thought it was very well done and appropriate that it didn’t focus on the win-loss record, but on the financial aspects of the football team.”

“We didn’t use records of athletic teams,” said Martin. “The issue we were addressing was ‘what is the role of competitive athletics at Davidson,’ what is the appropriate level of funding, etc. As long as you equip both players comparably for each sport, that would be fair.”

“My understanding is that in terms of number of coaches, quality of coaches, recruiting budgets, and style of transportation, [budgeting] is supposed to be fair and equitable,” Krentz said. He added that it looked as though the vast majority of teams’ budgets went to these aspects and not equipment.

Reaction to the report was not entirely favorable across campus. “No one should pay any attention to the faculty report,” says basketball coach Bobby Hussey. “It’s totally ludicrous. Division III is a half-step above intramurals. The best thing would be to find a big trash can for the report.” Hussey characterized the committee members as “frustrated jocks” and questioned the faculty’s authority to pass judgment on athletic affairs. “What right does the faculty have to recommend anything concerning athletics? That would be like me making a decision or offering my opinion on some academic endeavor of theirs. They’re not qualified.”

“I think it’s totally unfair that faculty have gone through the players’ personal records,” he continued. “It’s unfair, and I’m not even sure it’s legal.” Hussey also raised objections to the report’s singling out of football and basketball players’ academic records in the text and accompanying tables while not breaking down figures of other male athletes or female athletes in any sport. The records included in the report are SAT scores and grade point averages of athletes over a period of years, and Honor Code violations by sport. Bell defended the use of SAT scores. “It is relevant in that some people have a concern that admissions standards are being lowered systematically,” he said.

However, Krentz said that SAT scores were downplayed. “SATs are not universally recognized as a barometer of academic success,” he said. “We do not place a whole lot of stress on that point for that reason.” Dean of students Will Terry said that the Honor Code figures of 23 convictions of football players, or 27% of the total since 1977, unfairly portrayed the current situation. “Of that 23, only nine were since [football coach Vic] Gatto got here, and only five were people that he had recruited. I do not think that these figures are a major indictment of the present students playing football at Davidson.”

Krentz said that Terry “was particularly concerned that [Honor Code data] not be used in a way that any individual could be identified. We decided not to break it down by years.” The way the football situation has progressed in the media has subjected Krentz to some heat over the last several weeks. Krentz’s wife, Jeri Fischer, is a staff writer for The Charlotte Observer. He denies any connection. “I had nothing to do with the publication of any of the stories in The Charlotte Observer. My wife and I agreed a long time ago to keep our careers separate.”

Krentz said he has no idea how the trustees will react to the report. “The trustees did not ask for the report,” he said. “The trustees will have a chance to read the report. The report has collected a lot of useful and interesting information.” “I don’t think that anybody is really gloating over the report,” said Bell. “I’ve had a very positive experience with most of the football players I’ve come across. I don’t think that anybody’s pleased that they found out about this right before finals. The respect I have for the football players, I think, is shared by the rest of the faculty.”
