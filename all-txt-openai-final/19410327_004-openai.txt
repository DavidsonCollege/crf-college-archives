THE DAVIDSONIAN

Among THE GREEKS

With Spring Holidays so near at hand, most of the S. P. E.'s spent a quiet weekend on the campus
in preparation for a big time tournament in Greensboro.

As usual, some of the brothers ventured off to places far and near. Brother Mason traveled over to Charlotte as
did Brothers Bevo Royster and Ben Turnage. Brother Wilson went over to Derita. Jim Owens and Lawson Withers went to
York, S. C.

Brother Morton made an extended tour of the deep south, going as far as Florida. “Gay Dog” Hollar again commuted
between Hickory and Salem, and Cobb went to his home in Winston-Salem. Greensboro seemed very enticing to two of the
brothers, claiming as its victims P. Umbarger and B. Stumbarger. Covington, Hipp, Long, Williamson, Robinson, Hite, Morris, McCall, Eve, Miller,
and Parrigan managed to stray over to Charlotte. Bobby Gaither went to Spartanburg, John McCrea went to Winthrop, and O.
D. Evans made his weekly visit to Hickory. Garvey spent Saturday night at Winston-Salem where he attempted to increase the
size of his lock.

PHI DELTA THETA.

For the most part, the brothers of Phi Delta Theta used the past weekend for a sort of breathing spell
between Military Ball and Spring Vacation. After all, there's a limit to human endurance.

Brother Bocker takes this week’s prize of one box of Stanback hair-straightener for being the wildest of the wildcats. Close
second in the contest proved to be...

At the student Sunday School class at Phi Hall on March 23, Mr. F. L. Jackson, the guest teacher, chose
Philippians 4:8 as the topic for the lesson. To show the value of forming good habits, principles, and convictions during
college days, which is the formative period of life, Mr. Jackson drew parallels between the construction of the new buildings
on the Davidson campus and the development of a man’s character. He stressed that man’s soul is walled in by
suspicion, and discouragement are “fifth column” activities of the mind.

In further explaining the necessity of proper development during this critical period, Mr. Jackson made an analogy with the construction
of the new buildings on the Davidson campus. He stressed the importance of forming good habits, principles, and convictions during
college days, which is the formative period of life.

This week there are quite a few new books in the library that should be called to the attention of
the Student Body. The first of these is a book of manners for young men and women, called This Way,
Please, written by Eleanor Boykin. This book solves the question of manners for the college age, dealing with a wide
variety of cases, including party manners, business and table manners, social correspondence, right clothes, introductions, and more. The book is
written in a most interesting manner with many good illustrations.be Pledge Ar-| the discussion. Importance of carefulness in having |
