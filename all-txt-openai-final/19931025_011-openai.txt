**Theater department tackles psychological drama Equus**

By Jacob Abraham & Allison Wright

Alan Strang seems to be just another teenager dealing with typical teenage frustrations. He has a pair of loving parents,
a girlfriend, and a job caring for the horses at a local stable. What would possess such a seemingly normal,
well-adjusted young man to sneak into the stable one night and savagely blind six horses? Such is the quandary which
faces Dr. Dysart in the theater department’s fall production of Equus, running from Tuesday to Sunday.

Miles Mowry plays the child psychologist who is trying to get inside Alan’s head and cure all his problems. In
the process of psychoanalyzing Alan (played by Adam Knapp), Dysart must trace the significant events in Alan’s past that led
up to this brutal act of violence. As he studies Alan, Dysart must come to grips with his profession and
the power he wields to change, and perhaps destroy, the unique perspectives of his patients. At the same time, he
must somehow help Alan deal with his own sexuality and his strange obsession with horses.

Andrew Smitherman and Rachel Hall play Alan’s parents, whom Dysart consults to try to piece together Alan’s childhood. Jennifer Don
plays Jill, the girl who is drawn to Alan and who is instrumental in his sexual awakening. The other important
characters in the play are the horses, which are symbolically represented on stage. Led by the main horse called Nugget
(played by Edwin Thomas), the horses move about on stage wearing metallic horse-head masks and stilt-like horseshoes. The members of
the cast remain on stage throughout the play, sometimes serving as an on-stage part of the audience; they also work
as stage hands and jury members.

The simple-looking stage functions as Dr. Dysart’s study and the stable area, among other settings; a rotating circular stage is
also employed to create a special effect in one scene. Some controversy has surrounded Peter Shaffer’s play in the past.
Along with the play’s complex and mature themes, Davidson’s production will include a nude sex scene towards the end of
the play. While lighting effects will be used to make the nudity less overt, the play does seem to be
aimed towards a mature audience. Whether or not the play sparks controversy, Equus promises to be a thought-provoking psychological drama.

**The last of the singing cowboys**

By Geoff Graham

The evolution of Country, or any musical genre, is as inevitable as the passing of time itself. The Country and
Western of the forties and fifties lent itself, slowly but surely, to the rock, pop and country blend we hear
today. “Coal Miner’s Daughter” and “Railroad Lady” gave way to such modern-day hits as “Homesick” and “We Shall Be Free.”
There’s no good or bad in this. We can condemn or praise all we want, but in the end, we
must accept the change as unavoidable.

A few old timers still hang on, but their numbers are dwindling. Like the cowboys of their inspiration, they’re a
dying breed. One such singing cowboy is Don Edwards. Goin’ Back to Texas, his second album, pays tribute to the
Old West of his childhood. The elderly guitarist moans elegy after elegy, lamenting not only the passing of the lonely
cowboy, but the passing of the prairie wilderness as well. You’ve never heard him on the radio, for he no
longer fits the country mold, but nevertheless, all his songs sound familiar. They all yearn for a past which, as
children, we all dreamed of, yet never could touch.

Did you give a heart rebel yell at the end of The Outlaw Josie Wales? Did you want Silverado to
go on forever? Did you wipe tears from your eyes on the last page of Lonesome Dove? I did. If
you feel the same way I do, come by and listen to Don Edwards. You'll enjoy it. In today’s world,
where the longhorns, outlaws, and red wolves have all but vanished, this aged cowboy hangs on as the last of
an ancient and dying breed. In “Say Goodbye to Montana,” the old coyote sings, “All honor to the cowboy/Your praises
they will sing/For you never sold your saddle/That’s the most important thing.” Don Edwards has yet to sell his saddle,
and as long as he keeps playing, our heroes will always be cowboys.

**Is there a ghost in the Hardin House?**

By Towner Blackstock

The Harding House sits between the Admissions Building and Careers House on North Main Street. For many years home to
a Classics professor and his wife, the residence now houses single Davidson professors. The unpretentious structure easily goes unnoticed by
most passers-by. But perhaps there’s more to the Harding House than meets the eye. If we are to believe rumor,
there’s something up there. If we are to believe the experience of two former Davidson professors, there’s a ghost in
the Harding House.

Old houses are strange things, to be sure, and often have strange noises, odd occurrences, and so on. But might
there be something more? Dr. Bonnie Marshall taught Russian here until just last year. For a while, she lived...in the
upstairs of Harding House, although not quite comfortably. When she first arrived, the entire room was covered in black soot,
apparently from an old furnace duct. After four attempts of her own to clean it and a few more by
physical plant workers, they finally painted over the mess. A minor inconvenience, to be sure, but then there was the
door. Every day when she returned from class, the door that she had locked securely in the morning stood ajar.
After a great deal of fuss, the physical plant re-hung the door frame, which took care of that problem...for the
most part. The stubborn door still came ajar a few more times during her stay. If this all wasn’t enough,
a certain spot in the hall constantly remained “freezing cold...it didn’t matter what time of the year it was.” Even
in summer heat, this cold spot sent shivers down spines.

To add to her troubles, our berated professor returned once to her apartment to find a large puddle of water
on the floor of her study. After mopping it up, she went into the kitchen, where another puddle of water
covered most of the floor. Maybe the roof leaked? No, there were no stains on the ceilings or walls, or
any apparent other sources of leaking. Then there were the noises. Dr. Marshall got used to the “very pronounced” sounds
of someone stepping across the attic floor, of water running, and even banging. Yes, old houses can creak and moan,
but this proved a little too much, enough to be annoying. Perhaps squirrels, or birds? That doesn’t explain the furnace.
Shortly after her moving in, several physical plant workers placed a new furnace in the attic, which took most of
the afternoon just to get up there. The men left, planning to install it the next day. That night, Dr.
Marshall heard a huge crash directly overhead, much to her distress. In the morning, the workmen arrived to discover, much
to their dismay, that the furnace had fallen on its side in the attic right over Dr. Marshall’s bed. Yet
they could not explain how such an enormously heavy, not to mention stable, piece of machinery had just turned over!

Later in the year, Marshall invited another professor, Dr. Becky Marcon of the Psychology Department, over for dinner. After eating,
they sat talking and began discussing feminism and religion. At this point, the noises that constantly pervaded the house seemed
to grow louder. “Just ignore them,” said Dr. Marshall, pointing out that these noises happened all the time, and that
she “refused to let these get to me.” The footsteps in the attic, the “huge banging sounds,” and the running
water noises all grew to the point of interrupting their conversation. Suddenly, the smoke alarm in the ceiling directly above
the stairwell fell and...

Garth Brooks offers a priceless performance
By Joanne Griffiths and Lisa Knox

How many people do you know that would pay $170 for three and a half hours of pure excitement? We
did! No, this is not about a bargain hunter’s indecent proposal, but rather two nights, October 1 and October 2,
of drooling over THE man of country music: Garth Brooks. Unfortunately, the opening act, Stephanie Davis, was less than impressive.
The only song worth mentioning was her attempted rendition of Garth’s “Learning to Live Again” to which she did no
justice. Her mild "success" could be measured by the enormous number of empty seats inside the coliseum compared to the
packed lobby of fans standing in lines for Garth paraphernalia.

Our high-cost, high-class tickets enabled us to get a superb view of Garth in his second-skin Wranglers as he opened
the show rising from below the stage with “Standing Outside the Fire,” an intoxicating number from his latest release In
Pieces. After such an outstanding opening, he continued to whip the crowd into a frenzy with such boot-stomping favorites as
“Shameless,” “Friends in Low Places,” “Rodeo,” and “That Summer.” His slower songs were equally well-received with the crowd drawing out
their lighters for “The River” and “Unanswered Prayers.” Tribute was paid during the second concert to the Kulwicki and Allison
families during “The Dance” for the deaths of the two car-racing greats killed earlier this year. WTDR distributed flashlights to
the crowd upon entry to shine during the song.

The second night was packed with even more energy than the first. Garth delivered a stellar show outlasting the previous
night’s by forty-five minutes. During his second encore, Garth claimed he was having such a good time that he wasn’t
quite ready to leave and stayed on to please the crowd with four additional songs, including “If Tomorrow Never Comes.”
Garth’s personable performance left a good number of his fans speechless. As sophomore Addria Capps put it, “What can you
say? It was Garth Brooks!” Looking back on our expensive weekend, we have come to a decision: our lives are
better left to chance, we could have kept our money, but we’d have had to miss...
