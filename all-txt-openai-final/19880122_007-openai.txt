**Wildcats jump to quick lead in Southern Conference**

**4-0 conference start is best since 1969-70**

By PHILLIP PRESCOTT

With 3 conference wins this past week, Davidson is off to its best start, 4-0 in the conference, since the 1969-70 team coached by Terry Holland that started 10-0 in the conference on the way to a 22-5 season.

Davidson had a close game Wednesday on the road against the Virginia Military Institute. Davidson held a slim lead throughout the game but was never able to pull away, as VMI always cut the lead to within 10 points or less. When Davidson got a 5-point lead, 66-61, with about 10 seconds left in the game, they seemed assured of the win until Ramon Williams hit a running three-pointer with a second left in the game, making the final score 66-64 in a Davidson win.

VMI was led by its twin brother backcourt of Damon and Ramon Williams, both 6-1 sophomore guards, with Damon scoring 19 points with two steals and Ramon 17 points and two steals. For Davidson, Derek Rucker had an off game going 5-16 from the field and scoring only 12 points, but Jeff Himes saved the day, scoring a career-high 32 points and getting 15 rebounds. Jay Schmitt also scored 10 points, and the defense was led by Himes’ 4 steals and Rucker’s 2 steals.

Saturday, Davidson was back in the friendly confines of Johnson Gym in a televised conference game against the University of Tennessee-Chattanooga. The game was highlighted by a spectacular performance by Rucker, who scored a career-high 39 points, and a swarming Davidson defense which held UT-Chattanooga to 35% from the field in an easier-than-expected 81-65 win. The key to the Davidson win was containing Chattanooga’s senior star center Lance Fulse to a quiet 14 points and 10 rebounds. Senior guard Morris Lyons was limited to a measly 4 points. Chattanooga was led by 2 new faces, Benny Green, a 6-3 sophomore guard transfer from Kansas State who scored 23 points, and Shendi Moon, a 6-5 sophomore forward who scored 13 points and grabbed 10 rebounds.

Davidson was led by Rucker’s 39 points on 3 three-pointers and 14 points from the charity stripe, and Himes scored 13 points before fouling out. On defense, Davidson was ignited by Rucker’s 4 steals and Alan Hunter’s 2 steals.

**Around the horn**

“Kill the Umpire!” “Shoot the Referee!” -- calls of the wild, threats of exasperated fans, but more often than not, justified cries of a group of people who feel they have been slighted by the inane acts of the few men who hold authority in a sports event. Call them what you will -- refs, umps, linesmen, back judges, officials -- these men and women suffer verbal assaults day in and day out. But with the stupidity they sometimes show, the abuse is warranted.

Last Saturday, for instance, at the Davidson-Chattanooga basketball game, fans witnessed one of the worst displays of officiating on record. It seemed that the officials, on most occasions, thought about the right call and then made the exact opposite one. To the observers in the stands, the mistakes were frustrating. When the Cats were looking to put the game away, Jeff Himes came down with an airball that had already passed below the rim. Then, some bald guy on the far sideline blew his whistle. He said the basket should count because it was “goal tending.” Any reasonably-educated sports person knows that the ball has to be above the rim and has to have a chance to go in before goal tending can be ruled. However, this idiot didn’t know that, or if he did, he didn’t apply his knowledge when the heat was on.

Another case: Jay Schmitt, who suffers all kinds of physical abuse every time he enters the lane, was bodied up to Lance Fulse. Fulse proceeded to elbow him. Who was the foul on? Schmitt, of course. Why, he was over the guy’s back, don’t you know? No, I don’t know, you bum! These kinds of calls went on all during the game, on both ends of the court, giving new meaning to the word “incompetence.”

So the Southern Conference has bad referees. Big deal. In big-time sports, the officials are well-trained and disciplined, and they make the right calls 99% of the time. Wrong. In the A.C.C., there is Lennie Wertz. Some will say that he is a good official, but he has made some of the worst calls this sports fan has ever seen. In the Major Leagues, there are guys like Dave Pallone and Charlie Williams. Dave Pallone doesn’t know the strike zone from a free-fire zone. He is probably the most inconsistent umpire in...the business. Charlie Williams is the only umpire ever to have thrown Steve Garvey out of a game. And for what grave offense? Garvey said, “We’ve got to buckle down out here.” And Williams is a major league umpire. Under the present system, he could be working the World Series next year. The seventh game of the World Series in 1987 was a prime example of the travesty that officials have levied on sports, both college and professional. The “men” working that affair blatantly missed at least three calls, and possibly more. Lee Weyer, one of the better umpires, even got in on the act when he called Tom Herr of the Cardinals out at first after Herr had obviously stepped in under Frank Viola’s tag. To take some of the burden off the “human” officials, the N.F.L. instituted the instant replay rule. This has been a joke in itself. In the N.F.C. Wild Card game this season, the referee in the replay booth absolutely screwed up at least three times at the beginning of the second half. John Madden and Pat Summerall were dumbfounded, wondering if the replay officials were watching the same film they were. So, instant replays aren’t the answer. Well, what is the answer?

First, organizations need to scrutinize their officials more thoroughly before hiring them. Too many times a Dave Pallone slips through the cracks of the system. Secondly, sports governing bodies need to censure their officials when they do a bad job. They should do their job well, or find another one. Thirdly, the officials themselves shouldn’t be uptight about criticism. You know that if Dean Smith says something to an official, he’s got a valid gripe. Therefore, the referees should listen to him, not give him a technical. Granted, they have to draw the line somewhere. If the coach or player starts ranting and shouting profanities about the referee’s heritage, a technical is in order. But not for walking out of the “coach’s box.” Don’t misinterpret this column. There are some good officials, who do an admirable job every time out—Joe Forte in the A.C.C., Doug Harvey in the majors, Mark Crowther in IMAC. Unfortunately, most officials in most leagues don’t do their jobs properly, and I can sympathize with Bobby Knight when he slams a phone down or throws a chair onto the court. Well, maybe not a chair.

Conference update
By LARRY DAGENHART, JR.

It was a week of upsets. Davidson, in its finest outing of the season, rolled over UT Chattanooga 81-65 Saturday in Johnston Gym. Derek Rucker scored 39 points and set a career high for the second time in three games. Monday night, the Cats took care of a less experienced Western Carolina team 86-67. Senior Jeff Himes led all scoring with 26. The win put Davidson at 4-0 and left it in sole possession of the top spot in the Southern Conference, the Cats’ best start since 1970. Overall, Davidson is 10-5. Furman is continuing to hang tough in second place. The Paladins are 4-1 coming off wins of 76-73 over Western Carolina and 77-62 over UT Chattanooga. Monday’s win was Furman’s first win over the Moccasins since 1981. Currently, after a two-game losing streak, UT Chattanooga is in fourth place at 2-2 (11-5). Third place Marshall, who beat Appalachian State 88-80 Saturday, was upset by East Tennessee State Monday 84-74. The Thundering Herd is 1-1 in the conference and 10-5 overall. After the victory over Marshall, East Tennessee State has improved to fifth place at 3-1 (6-6). The Buccaneers also beat VMI last Saturday 86-65. Appalachian State is in sixth place at 1-3 (8-7) after beating VMI 98-82 on Monday. Freshman Rodney Peel scored 26 points in his first college start. Seventh place Western Carolina is 0-2 with losses to Davidson and Furman. The sudden resignation of former coach Steve Cottrell a few months ago is definitely not helping things in Cullowhee. Citadel, who is 0-2 in the conference, was upset by Coker College Monday 54-51. The Bulldogs blew an eleven-point lead with 9 minutes remaining as Coker scored 14 unanswered points. Overall, Citadel is 3-9. Cellar-dweller VMI is 0-3 (3-9) and has lost five in a row. Well, there’s a quick update on the state of the Southern Conference. As for this weekend’s matchups, we have: Davidson at Appalachian State, The Citadel at Marshall, East Tennessee at Western Carolina, Furman at VMI, and Tennessee Chattanooga at Southern Mississippi.
