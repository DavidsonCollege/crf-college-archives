**The Bavihaonias TO MEET WG&L**

**Unbeaten Matmen Face Stern Tests**

What do you do if you're the Davidson College wrestling team and you've had minuscule budget, no wrestling scholarships, and a strong schedule? You go on out and start the season undefeated, which is just what coach Charlie Parker and his charges have done this season.

Starting out this year’s slate with three relatively easy opponents, the mat-cats have rolled up wins over St. Andrews College, Catawba College, and UNC-C. However, Parker is no optimist. With such wrestling titans as VMI, The Citadel, N. C. State, and Chapel Hill on the schedule, he knows that the team is in for some rough going. Parker predicts about the same finish this year for the Wildcats as last year, 6-2. He expects to finish no higher than fourth in the Southern Conference, behind talent-laden William and Mary, East Carolina, and VMI. Parker sees a dogfight for fourth place between Davidson and The Citadel, which Davidson meets on February 4-5.

Despite the dearth of scholarships, Parker’s matmen are remarkably cosmopolitan. Only two wrestlers are from North Carolina—Ronnie Williams from Fayetteville and Frank Shinn from South Iredell. Of the rest, four are from Virginia, with others from Tennessee, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Washington, D. C. This is a young group, the only senior being presently undefeated captain Ron Williams. Other starters are undefeated freshmen Rob Benton and Rob Jacobs, whose older brother Jack was last year’s captain, and sophomore John Scandling.

Parker's pessimism notwithstanding, the 'Cats appear solid in all weight classes, having to forfeit only at 118 lbs. The team’s next match is on Wed., Jan 21 against Washington and Lee at Lexington, Virginia. The next home match will be a tournament featuring VMI, Furman, and The Citadel on February 4-5.

**‘Cats Meet Georgia**

The Davidson swimming team boosted its record to 2-1 with a win over DeKalb College last Friday, but the Wildcat swimmers will have a tough time staying above the .500 mark during the next week. The watermen will swim against two tough Georgia teams within the next five days. Today the ‘Cat natatorium will be invaded by a good Emory University team. Emory beat Davidson last year. Tuesday the Wildcats will journey to Augusta, Ga., where they will swim against Augusta College.

“Augusta has a good team,” said sophomore Jack Hobbs, a Davidson swimmer, “and we're going to have to swim pretty good to beat them.” Hobbs explained that both schools have a scholarship program for swimming, and that this gives them a decided advantage over Davidson.

Hobbs himself was a key factor in the ‘Cats win over DeKalb. He earned two first-place finishes and swam on the medley relay team which took first. Freshman Rusty Saylor also took a first place, in the breaststroke event, while divers Eric Vernon and John Knox added to Davidson's thirty-point margin by taking first and second places, respectively.

“Everybody is finally getting in good shape, and the times are coming down a lot,” said Coach Tom Steve. Hobbs is within one second of the school record for the 200-yard freestyle.

**Three Thinclads Represent ‘Cats In Richmond Tourney**

Three Davidson track standouts have been invited to participate in the Chesterfield Jaycees Invitational Meet today in Richmond. Tommy Richardson, Ray Swetenburg, and Mark Connors will represent the Wildcat thinclads at the Richmond Coliseum.yard individual medley and within three seconds of the school mark for the 200-yard backstroke. “I think I can break both of these records before the season’s over,” said Hobbs. “I’m getting in pretty good shape now.”

Saylor is also threatening a college mark. His best time for the 200-yard breaststroke is only four seconds away from the school record. The poolmen will have to be at their best for the next five days in order to maintain a winning percentage. The swimmers’ previous victory was over UNC at Asheville. Their only loss came in the opening meet of the season, when they dropped a decision to Morris Harvey. Stevens attributed this loss to the lack of training over the Christmas break, explaining that the team had only four days to practice for the meet.

“A real big event” in the track competition, and coach Heath Whittle was understandably pleased by the invitations. “We are very happy that they have been chosen,” Whittle stated. “This is the first time we have had participants in this event in five or six years.”

The thinclads will participate in two other meets as part of their winter track season, the VMI relays on Feb. 5 and the Southern Conference Championships on Feb. 19. Both events will be held at Lexington, Va. Richardson will run in the 60-yard dash at Richmond. He won that event last year in the Southern Conference Indoor Track Championships. Swetenburg will participate in the 60-yard high hurdles and the triple jump. He placed third in the SC indoor track tourney and won the hurdles last year. Connors is a freshman from Suffern, N.Y. He will participate in the 600-yard run. Connors ran a 48.7 in the 440 in high school, a time that approaches the Davidson record.

The team as a whole has improved over last year, particularly in the distance events. Several freshmen, notably distance man Rick Bell, have added a great amount of depth to the Wildcat squad.

... Elections (Continued from Page 1)

Miscellany Editor and members of the Review Board. Frank Erwin was victorious in the race for Miscellany Editor, securing 58.26 percent of the vote and defeating Bob Bolick 342 to 245. Elected to the Review Board were Tom Case with 371 votes (42.11 percent) and Dwight Grady with 277 (31.44 percent), beating out David Hanig (233 votes).

In the rising Sophomore Class, despite the fact that thirteen candidates were seeking seats in the Senate, the top three contenders carried over fifty percent of the vote cast, so no run-off was necessary. Vince Rabil with 138 votes (22.51 percent), Robert Corlew with 101 (16.48 percent), and Blain Batner with 95 votes (15.50 percent) were the three victors in the rising Sophomore Class.

Lear stressed, concerning the fact that this was the last election he would supervise, “I want to thank everyone who helped with the election, especially the people who manned the polls, and especially Jim Winn, who ran the computer for us.” He noted that there would have to be someone else to set up these next runoffs, possibly new rising Senior Class President Mike Creasman, but more likely individuals previously unconnected with elections.
