**Staff Editorial: Students Deserve Option of Coed Halls**

College life is about much more than going to class and getting a good job after graduation. For many students,
what we learn from our hallmates can be just as important as what we learn from our professors. Yet Davidson’s
current policy of having only single-sex halls keeps many students from living next to and learning from members of the
opposite sex. On our campus, where many students join single-sex fraternities and eating houses and much of our interaction with
the opposite sex takes place either at Court parties or in the formal atmosphere of the classroom, there is all
the more need for men and women to live side by side, learning from each other by sharing the same
environment.

The upcoming renovation of Belk this summer is an opportunity for RLO to reexamine its current policy of having all
halls be single-sex and instead offer the option of halls that are coed by room. Belk, which in recent years
has taken advantage of its two bathrooms per floor to give men and women the option of living on opposite
ends of the same hall, would be an ideal starting place for the College to initiate a coed-by-room housing option.
Richardson, with its two bathrooms per hall, and the “pods” of single rooms in Tomlinson would also provide possible locations
for coed-by-room halls.

RLO’s current policy of offering only single-sex halls seems rather antiquated at a time when men and women routinely visit
each other late at night and friendships between the sexes are far more common than serious relationships. Why should a
group of friends that happen to be of opposite sexes not be allowed to live next door to one another?
While some colleges and universities have taken this concept to extremes by offering coed bathrooms and even coed roommates, there
does not seem to be an immediate desire for either of these options here at Davidson. Living on a coed
floor should be a choice, but it’s just the type of choice that administrators need to trust students as young
adults to make. It’s also demonstrative of the small but important choices Davidson students will face in the years beyond
picking up that diploma.

Undoubtedly, this choice will not be for everyone, though Davidson students deserve the option of living on a hall with
both men and women. Doing so will not just help preserve friendships, but also allow us to know and learn
from one another in ways that classroom discussions and parties just cannot accomplish. In months or years, we’ll be sharing
workplaces and living spaces with members of the opposite sex, so why put off that education until after college?

**Media Plays Role in ‘Cult of Thinness’**

We are embarrassed by Joe Taylor’s inappropriately biased, illogical column in last week’s Davidsonian. Many of our classmates share that
sentiment. Responding to a lecture on media representation and thinness given by Dr. Sharlene Hesse-Biber, Mr. Taylor managed to equate
anorexia and bulimia with stupidity. Such an argument is neither logical in light of psychologists’ description of the disorders nor
sensitive to many of Mr. Taylor’s very intelligent classmates, some of whom are struggling with the diseases.

Mr. Taylor’s argument is so obviously biased against women and men with eating disorders that his reasoning manages to fall
apart without our intervention. But let us try anyways. Mr. Taylor begins by refusing to believe that media could be
responsible for the creation of body stereotypes: “media is a reflection of what people want to see.” Apparently, it is
“natural” for women to be thin and men to be muscular. The disparity of gender in such a statement should
be obvious: Mr. Taylor falls into sexual stereotyping that awards strong, healthy bodies to men and frail, thin bodies to
women.

There are many exceptions to these predetermined gender roles (both gay and straight): women who want to have strong, muscular
bodies and men that want to have thin, healthy bodies. Are these exceptions denying or ignoring what Mr. Taylor assumes
to be “natural” drives? Eating disorders happen to men as well as women. While Mr. Taylor does acknowledge media’s attempts
to capitalize on bodily insecurities, he offers little in the way of condemnation of this exploitation. Mass media does create
standards, many times unrealistic ones because its images and information shape our social and cultural norms. And its unrealistic body
images are not limited to thinness: people who compulsively work out in order to achieve the bigger, better body suffer
from similar exploitation as those obsessed with losing weight.

Some people may desire to be thin or muscular because it means they’ve achieved a personal health and wellness; others
want that because it means they’ve achieved a state of financial success. It would not surprise us if Mr. Taylor
had never intimately known or cared for someone with an eating or body image disorder. If he had, he would
realize those who suffer from eating disorders are very real, sometimes very intelligent people who suffer from a frightening disease.
It is clear, too, that Mr. Taylor suffers from a lack of information on either the psychological underpinnings of eating
disorders or the ways...Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

That cultural discourses shape our norms and biases. Uninformed editorializing like Mr. Taylor’s makes it all the more difficult for
a community to engage in productive and supportive discourses on the causes and remedies of the disease. Those who suffer
from it are likely to feel stigmatized and unable to seek help for their problem. As Davidson students, we should
do better.

Todd’s Music a worthwhile store

Lauren Law’s article on Todd’s Music did nothing but perform a blatant disservice to the small yet comprehensive independent store.
Where was the mention of their huge inventory of used CDs and local musicians? How about the stacks of records
or variety of posters they carry? As a faithful shopper there, I’ve found the store to be a good match
for people who enjoy both shopping for and talking about music. Clearly, your staff writer was too entranced with their
small jam band section to do more than glance around the store and scribble some notes. Stores like Todd’s are
what keep the personality and quirkiness in buying music, and Law, clearly a serial Wal-Mart music shopper, missed the store’s
best quality. Todd and Josh (bandmates in Banana Pudding) are the most personable music store employees I’ve met. Yes, they
are very familiar with the jam band genre, but they know what they carry and will give you an honest
answer on what you’re about to buy. Finding a good music store to shop in isn’t about saving gas money.
If that’s what you’re worried about, you may as well stick to snatching songs off of Kazaa.

‘Stupidity’ not the only factor at work

I was dismayed to read last week’s article claiming “stupidity, not capitalism, is responsible for eating disorders.” Now I certainly
do not blame capitalism for every eating issue, and I agree that “the media is a reflection of what people
want to see.” I even agree that it may be “perfectly natural for human beings to want to exhibit those
qualities [sex appeal and health].” (And by the way, since when does extreme thinness exude sex appeal or health? Look
at the paintings of Renaissance women—I don’t see any ribs or hipbones sticking out there). What I do NOT agree
with is the idea that people suffering from eating disorders are stupid because they pursue those elusive ideals. Mr. Taylor’s
advice to abstain from purging, starving, and fad-dieting makes this complicated issue far too simple. For instance, many anorexics and
bulimics are perfectionistic, Type-A people with high intelligence and even higher standards for themselves. With this kind of background, I
am pretty sure they are aware that advertisements portray often unrealistically thin women, that diet and exercise can reshape/maintain a
slim figure, and that throwing up is not a socially acceptable method of weight control. They also are still driven
to achieve this (albeit unrealistic) “perfect body” for themselves. Why? Perhaps to mask self-esteem issues, to please their parents, to
earn social accolades, or to meet criteria for a certain sport. The fact remains that in this society, thinness is
valued; if you want to “be” somebody, you had better be slim or be Queen Latifah. In a sense, people
with eating disorders start with “more” self-control and discipline than the general population. They find a way to achieve their
“ideal” body and to satisfy their stringent standards. Inevitably, though, the dangerous patterns start becoming the “controller” instead of the
“controlled,” and starving/purging/laxatives/etc. become the entire focus of their lives. It is sad, it is true, it is terrifying, and
it is treatable... but one thing it is not is “stupid.”

Bush no ‘gay-hater’

Leslie Smith’s column (“Fear, ignorance, keep Bush against gays”) was nothing more than an absurd and poorly argued polemic. That
President Bush rabidly hates gays simply because he opposes homosexual marriage is, if you were to believe Ms. Smith, irrefutable
fact. Of course, this is always the last defense of anyone engaged in an argument with conservatives: when in doubt,
don’t bother addressing the issue, just call them bigots. Even more absurd, she argues that, because the numbers of homosexuals
and the numbers of four ethnic minority groups are roughly equal, Bush therefore hates all minorities as well. By her
logic, since the number of homosexuals in the country roughly matches the number of African-Americans, it is obvious that the
President also hates all black people. This ridiculous, spurious argument never once looks at the substance of the issue. There
may be a case to be made for gay marriages, or at least civil unions, as no rational person will
argue that homosexuals are not human beings, not even the President. Some might even question the federal government’s right to
involve itself in such matters. Alternatively, a Utah polygamist recently brought his case to court following the Supreme Court decision
decriminalizing homosexual sex and argued that polygamy should be every bit as legal. Senator Rick Santorum (R-Pa.) voiced this concern
of a slippery-slope last year and, of course, was called every derisive name that you can imagine. Furthermore, should it
be left to activist judges, or the voters as citizens, to redefine the institution of marriage? It is possible to
engage in civil debate on this issue without resorting to Ms. Smith’s childish, last defense of name-calling rhetoric.
