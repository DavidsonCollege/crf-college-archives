Wildcats, from page 12

The Wildcats found themselves unable to sustain their momentum when they traveled to Spartanburg on Saturday. Despite 15 points each from Cohen and Kuhlman, Davidson could not hold onto the basketball in the final minute and dropped a heartbreaker to the Terriers. Kuhlman converted an old-fashioned three-point play with 1:36 remaining to tie the game at 60. Wofford answered with a foul shot by Jamar Diggs and a transition lay-up by Noah Dahlman after a Wildcat turnover. Nik Cochran '13 converted a lay-up with 36 seconds to play which closed the gap to 63-62. Wofford sealed the game, however, when Cameron Rundles converted two foul shots and Brad Loesing added a transition lay-up in the final seconds.

The Wildcats again struggled from the floor, converting only 43.1% (22-51) of their field goal attempts. The difference in the game came at the foul line. Although both teams shot exactly the same percentage (63.6%) from the charity stripe, the Terriers attempted twice as many foul shots as the Wildcats (28-44 vs. 14-22). The Wildcats also failed to help their cause by committing 20 turnovers. They also received credit for only three assists on their 22 field goals. Dahlman led the Terriers with 17 points. Rundles added 13, and Tim Johnson tallied a game-high 16 rebounds.

Davidson appeared to be in control of the game early in the second half, expanding a 31-28 halftime advantage into a 39-30 edge after a technical foul was assessed to the Terrier bench. Wofford refused to fold, however, reeling off a 14-0 run to establish a 44-39 advantage. The lead swapped hands several times before a three-point play by Rundles with 7:47 left gave Wofford a lead it would not relinquish. The results of the brief road trip moved Davidson’s record to 8-10 overall and 3-3 in the Southern Conference. The loss to Wofford dropped Davidson out of a tie for second place in the South Division. The Wildcats will return to action on Wednesday night at 7 p.m. when they host the Western Carolina Catamounts.

They finished their 2009 season with a 7-17 team record and a ninth-place SoCon finish. The 2010 season looks promising with five starters returning and three new recruits. In Saturday’s match at the Hoke Sloan Tennis Center, the Wildcats did not let up as they battled No. 66 Clemson. Davidson eventually fell to a 5-2 loss but put up a good fight. Calum Gee ’12 and Walker Lyons ’11 played an impressive doubles match, winning 8-7 at the No. 2 doubles spot.
