AMONG THE GREEKS—
(Continued From Page Two)

Mr. Holler, who told a spicy joke to get everyone present in the right mood. Mr. Holler also thanked for a splendid job on our school paper, the “Sig-Epigram,” which is published twice every year. After the banquet, the entire fraternity retired to the dance. Heading the procession of cars was brother Trammel in his shiny new Studebaker. With the aid of numerous back-fires, he ascended the steep hills of Route 49 which leads to the exclusive “Red Fez” clubhouse located on a bend of the Catawba River. The moon was shining through the beautifully placid waters as the procession arrived. Inside, a cherry fireplace warmed everyone and the music put rhythm in every foot. Doug Hill's orchestra proved to be not only tops in the field of soft, romantic music and rhythmic Latin-American selections, but also a poor-man’s Spike Jones. Breaking their union vows, the musicians turned comedians (and comediennes) in a hilarious arrangement of the “Swan of the Dying Swan.” During the intermission, cokes were enjoyed inside, and the moon outside. We would like to thank Professors Peyton and Sellars for serving as such excellent chaperones, and we hope their time was spent enjoyably.

PHI DELTA THETA
It all concerned the unanimous decision of the Christmas party which was held in the ballroom of the Hotel Selwyn this past Saturday night to be the function long remembered by the country. The tranquil atmosphere which prevailed in the lobby of the hotel was rudely shattered when the weird but wonderfully costumed brothers of Gamma began to arrive about seven o'clock. Brother Whit Cobb, whose dressing was interrupted after he got only as far as his long underwear, nearly caused a wreck as he crossed Trade Street on his way to the party. The realistically decorated Selwyn ballroom was most desecrated, we mean decorated, by the Phi Delt crew of artists and interior decorators under the inspired direction of Brother Hartley Hall, IV. So realistic were these decorations that Brother Frank Hooper, after several dippers of “supersonic cider,” was seen trying to milk the cardboard cow which grazed in one corner. These realistic decorations also fooled Brother Guthrie, who, during the course of the evening, tried to open the door which leaned into the other corner of the hall. Honest Bill Iverson served as toastmaster for the banquet. Inspired by the atmosphere and by his date, Miss Carolina, Bill was at his funniest. Dr. Chalmers Davidson's postprandial speech climaxed the evening. They felt that this prize should have gone to their dates.

Bates Cleaners
A miniature electronic device collects and transmits to ground observers 24 different kinds of information about flights of the Navy Aerobee high-altitude rockets which travel at nearly 3,000 miles an hour. Although the Navy’s submarine service had less than two percent of the total Navy personnel, the submarine forces sank two-thirds of all Japanese ships sunk by the Navy during World War II. In reviewing cases of Navy and Marine Corps personnel discharged during the war with less than honorable discharges, a Navy board has found that about one-third of those who requested a review are entitled to a better grade of discharge than they actually received.

“A FRESHMAN’S ESSAY ON GIRLS”
I'm through with all women, they're all untrue, They make you, they break you, and laugh when they're through. They wreck and degrade you with motives most base, Then reward all your love with a slap in the face. I'm done with all women, there’s not one alive, That's worth all the misery that men must survive. I'm through with all women, they cheat and they lie, They prey on us males to the day that they die. They tease us, torment us, and drive us insane, Say, who is the blonde that just came in?

In reviewing cases of Navy and Marine Corps personnel discharged during the war with less than honorable discharges, a Navy board has found that about one-third of those who requested a review are entitled to a better grade of discharge than they actually received. Since September 2, 1948, a total of 138 World War II heroes have been awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor.

KAPPA ALPHA

If you see a bunch of rather dazed but happy guys wandering around the campus, you can be pretty sure that they are K.A.'s. The K.A.'s threw their winter function last Saturday, and it was really adult. It was held out at the American Legion officer's club at Morris Field. The dance floor and refreshment room downstairs were decorated in crimson and old gold by those dear ole handy pledges. Things got started with a buffet supper prepared by the airport Grill, which consisted of chicken salad, slaw, fried chicken, cake, and potato chips, plus all the accessories. It was delicious. Everyone ate and bulled for almost an hour, and then moved upstairs for some entertainment which the pledges had gotten up. First on the program was “Hot-Lips” Roger Cornell on the piano, and Dan McKeithen. They gave a rather peculiar rendition of Swanee River, and then came two fine boogie-woogie actors, Hal Haynes and some anonymous character who turned out to be Quincy Jones. They put on a half-hour of songs (hill-billy style), dances, and jokes. Then Tim Harden announced the girl who had been chosen as the K.A. sponsor. This was the high point of the evening for the girls, and silence fell over the crowd as the girls were awaiting the announcement. The lucky girl was beautiful Miss Jean Garrison, who was escorted by Art Lindsay. Billy Knauff arrived at this moment, and the dance was quickly begun. A complete list of couples is unavailable, but the following includes most of them: “Sister” Blythe with Adams, Barron with Hedrick, Boyle with Dick Dobson, Chuck “P. J.” Greene with Jimmie Glynn, Carolyn Butcher with Randy Kabrich, Anne Raaser with Henry King, Conally Smith with Chuck Kirby, Mary Ann Campbell with Jim Larkin, Art Lindsay with Flynn Long, John Lyles with Wilkes, Theresa Cunningham with John Jaxter, Helen Sophie with Bill Macaulay, Dot McCleod with Sam McDaniel, Pat Whitaker with Dan McKeithan, Betsy Harris with Charlie Mitchell, Teeka Long with Jack Payne, Sarah Anne Rossberry with Ebby (The Body) Gene Fred Peyer, Patey with Regen, Nancy Barron with John Parker, Ed West with Bill Adams, Manley McWilliams with Jack Roddey, Jane June Delamor with Mary Anne Car- and Robinson. Aileen Kabrich with Bryass Knauff was hot and the brothers’ dancing was in rare form. A fine time was had by all, and the very appropriate booby prize which Brother Whit (Vent the back) Cobb was awarded during the evening.
