18 MEN ON HONOR ROLL
Seniors Lead List With Grand Total
Nine Students Who Made Over 95 Per Cent.

The honor roll representing those that have attained an average grade of at least 95 per cent for the fall term has just been announced. The large number from the Senior class is accounted for in part by the fact that under a rather recent ruling of the faculty those Seniors that have a sessional grade of 85 per cent are not required to stand the final examination on the individual subject concerned, and hence it is much easier to reach 95 per cent than under the former regulation. Further, Seniors of course know how to study to better advantage and have the privilege to a larger extent than the lower classmen of choosing what studies they will pursue. The following is a list of honor roll men:

Seniors.
Cassell, J. E., Christiansburg, Va., 98.17.
Brown, C. K., Cleveland, N. C., 98.00.
King, A. D., Bristol, Tenn., 96.17.
Fricker, A. F., Baltimore, Md., 95.86.
Jones, G. O., Chattanooga, Tenn., 95.83.
Deaver, R. R., Brevard, N. C., 95.71.
Brown, J. S., Hendersonville, N. C., 95.57.
Ormond, A. P., Talladega, Ala., 95.33.
Miley, W. H., Davidson, N. C., 95.17.
Dunlap, J. M., Charlotte, N. C., 95.00.

Juniors.
Richards, J. M., Davidson, N. C., 96.00.
Bailey, J. C., Rock Hill, S. C., 95.57.

Sophomores.
Ogden, D. H., Mobile, Ala., 98.00.
Davidson, R. F., Chester, S. C., 97.14.

Freshmen.
Jones, R. R., El Paso, Tex., 95.29.

Juniors Wallop Sophs by 23-6 Score
Erwin, Moore and Dick Star for Juniors—Tucker and Sorrells for Sophs

The inter-class gridiron season had an auspicious beginning last Saturday when the Juniors and Sophs met on Sprunt Field in their annual football classic. The game fully upheld the traditions of former class battles and was a fight from start to finish with the Juniors emerging victorious by a 23-6 score. When the teams took the field, they appeared to have the weight on their opponents, and later Coach McFadden’s charges displayed an ability and fighting spirit that could not be denied. The Sophs were unable to penetrate the famous “graveyard defense” put up by the Juniors, and time after time were forced to kick. The first score was made in the opening quarter when by steady plugging the Juniors took the ball up to a place from which Luke Erwin romped across with the first six points, adding another one in a minute. The second touchdown, coming in the first few minutes of the second frame, was the result of a pretty pass from Dick to Erwin, who negotiated the remaining 20 yards in fine style. He then added his fourteenth point with another goal. In the second semester, the Sophs, rejuvenated by the intermission, came back with determined efforts to stem the tide of defeat. The Juniors received, but a minute later John Grey, the speedy left end of the Sophs, scooped up a fumble behind the line of scrimmage and raced 40 yards for their only touchdown of the day. A violated technicality kept them from a chance at goal. The next advance of the Juniors was stopped on the four-yard line by firm (Continued on page 2)

Debates to be Held This Spring
Wake Forest and Mercer to Be Met in Forensic Contest—Preliminaries Feb. 18

The scene of conflict shifts for the time from the arena of athletics to the arena of forensic struggles. Davidson will have two inter-collegiate debates this spring. The first of these will be against Wake Forest, and will probably be held in Greensboro on the 1st day of April. The second is with Mercer University, of Macon, Ga., and will be held in Spartanburg, S. C., April 20th. The subject of these debates is, “Resolved, that the United States should cancel the loans made to her Allies during the great world war.” This subject was proposed by Davidson, her opponents having the choice of sides. At this writing no sides have been chosen. Preliminaries for the inter-collegiate debate will be held in the Society Halls, February 18th, and the semi-finals in Shearer Hall, March 4th. Two teams of two men each are to be selected, with two alternates. This debate is open to every member of either Literary Society, and you are urged to come out and try for a place on the team if you have any ability at all along the debating line. It has been some years since Davidson has met Wake Forest in a debating contest, and this one is looked forward to with eager anticipation. Mercer has been met for the last two years, Davidson winning in '19, and Mercer winning last year. This debate will break the tie, and Davidson is anxious to have it. The preliminaries of the Fresh-Soph debate will be held in the respective Society Halls on February 14th. The finals will be held in Shearer Hall, March 7th. The subject for the debate is, “Resolved, that the Smith-Towner Education Bill should be adopted.” This debate is open to all Freshmen and Sophomore members of the two Literary Societies, and everyone is urged to go out and try for a place on one of the teams. In the preliminaries, each society selects a team of three with one alternate, irrespective of classes. These teams meet in Shearer Hall on March 7th. Each society awards a medal to the best individual debater on its team.

Maj. T. G. Hearn, Experienced Officer to be Instructor
Has Won Warm Place in Hearts of All Davidson Men Since Beginning His Work Here

Thomas Guerdon Hearn, Major of Infantry, United States Army, is now at the head of the department of Military Science and Tactics of Davidson College. Major Hearn is a native of Alabama, having been born near Tuskegee, that state, in the late eighties. Major Hearn entered Auburn with the class of 1913 and remained there for two years. While at Auburn he was very much interested in debating and literary society work. Leaving Auburn, Major Hearn entered West Point with the class of 1915, with which he was graduated as cadet lieutenant. While at the academy Major Hearn was on the football squad for one year and also an entrant in the annual indoor meet as a member of a tug-of-war team. During his Senior year he was superintendent of the Children’s Sunday School of the post and in 1914 he was the academy's representative to the general Y. M. C. A. conference at Northfield, Mass. A glance at Major Hearn's “write-up” in the 1915 “Howitzer”—the West Point annual—gives us some interesting side-lights on his character: “Nothing can make him sore except to mention the fact that it was Booker T. Washington that put Tuskegee on the map.” Likewise the 1915 “Howitzer” informs us that Major Hearn is an A.B. of West Point. Now don’t assume, as did one of our professors, that he holds a Bachelor of Arts degree—ask the Major about it sometime, and if he's feeling good perhaps he will tell you the story, taking particular care to inform you that itis not a B.A. degree. On the 19th day of December, 1917, Major—then Captain—Hearn was married to Miss Charlotte F. Jadwin, a daughter of Gen. Edgar Jadwin, of the Corps of Engineers, U.S. Army. Mrs. Hearn is here with her husband. Since his graduation from West Point, Major Hearn has specialized in the machine gun. He has done “post-graduate” work on his favorite gun at the Infantry School of Arms at Fort Sill and in several of the various staff schools that were conducted overseas. For a time while at Camp Forrest, Ga., he was second senior instructor in the automatic rifle school and while overseas was one of the three judges at the great inter-army Machine Gun Meet at Le Mans, France, in 1919. Overseas, Major Hearn commanded the Sixteenth Machine Gun Battalion of the Sixth Division. Upon graduation from West Point as a second lieutenant of infantry, Major Hearn was assigned to the Sixth Infantry, then stationed on the Mexican border. His regiment, as a unit of Pershing’s famous Punitive Expedition, hiked 360 miles into the interior of Mexico and back again. From the Sixth Infantry, Major Hearn was soon transferred to the Fifty-third Infantry, and from the Fifty-third to the Sixteenth Machine Gun Battalion of the Sixth Division. With the Sixteenth Machine Gunners, he trained at Camp Forrest, Ga., and later at Camp Wadsworth, S.C. The Sixteenth sailed from Hoboken for England in July, 1918. While at a rest camp in England, Major Hearn had the rare privilege of listening to an address by Rudyard Kipling, the greatest living English man of letters. “His personality is compelling, magnetic—he made an unforgettable impression on me,” was the way Major Hearn expressed himself.

ADDITIONAL SEATING FACILITIES PROVIDED FOR IN GYMNASIUM

No doubt the students will hear with pleasure the glad tidings that the gymnasium has at last been equipped with three tiers of seats in the gallery. Those unfortunate ones among us who have had to go through the unpleasant and disagreeable sensation of standing during an entire basketball game will rejoice now that this ordeal is a thing of the past. The need of an arrangement of this kind has been long felt, especially during the last year or two, due to the large increase in our student body and to the added number of basketball games played on the hill. Then, too, many of us have been forced to sit on the floor every Saturday night at the “movies.” In every available chair, two to three students are crowded like sardines and every now and then a bench groans and cracks under its added burden, while occasionally one crashes to the floor, much to the surprise and discomfort of its occupants, who ruefully pick themselves up amid the jeers of their delighted neighbors. Now that adequate seating arrangements have been provided, pictures can at last be seen with some degree of personal comfort.

Davidson Loses to Durham “Y” in Opening Game

Visitors Furnish Best Exhibition of Team Work Ever Seen on Local Court

Davidson took the short end of a 41 to 16 score in the first game of the season with the Durham Y.M.C.A. team. In this game, the old Davidson fighting spirit was displayed but that could not overcome the advantage in size and teamwork that the “Y” quint had. This “Y” from the town whose name is always associated with the ancient and honorable “Taurus,” was composed of old college stars, men of stature, experience, and basketball instinct, and without a doubt it is the best team in the two Carolinas. The game started with all the ginger and pep that both teams could put into it, each eager to make the first goal and thus gain the advantage. Durham obtained the lead in the first minute of play, never to be headed. The rooters were loud in their support of the Wildcats but not stinted in their praise of the “Y” team’s good work. Their style of play coupled with hard passing and accurate shooting presented an unbeatable combination against which the “Red and Black” quintet fought hard, and at times seemed to have conquered. For Davidson, Roberts and Romefelt were the mainstays and the point gatherers, while for Durham “Y,” Starling and Knight were the chief scorers. The game was remarkably free from fouls, the Durham team not committing even a technical foul during the whole game, and the Davidson five only two or three.

Line-up:
Davidson. Position. Durham “Y”
Roberts (6) ........ RF ........ Perry (10)
Schenck, J. (2) .... RF .... Starling (10)
Romefelt (6) ....... C ....... Knight (13)
Schenck, L. (C) .... LG .... Mangum (5)
Davis
Cline (3)

Substitutes: Shepherd for Davis (2), Crawford for Schenck.

Marked Success Attends First Life Work Campaign

Large Number of Students Hear Impressive Messages of Dr. Thompson

The Davidson conference marks the beginning of the Life Work Conferences which will be held at the various Presbyterian colleges throughout the South. Full preparation was made for the conference here. Several weeks ago, Rev. Edward E. Lane, the Life Work Secretary of our Southern Presbyterian Church, who is in charge of these conferences, was on the hill organizing prayer groups and arranging interviews. During the conference, practically every floor in the college conducted a short prayer meeting at 10 o'clock each night, and over a hundred personal interviews were held between different students and the conference leaders. Dr. Tolly Thompson, ‘05, an old Davidson man, held the conference here. Every meeting was marked by a large attendance and a deepening interest among those present. The interview hours were crowded. The general impression among most of the students seems to be that these meetings were the best ever held on the hill.

Thursday Night.

Dr. Thompson built his first address Thursday night on the passage, “I call you not servants but friends.” He stated that we formed our friendships in proportion to the personal worth of our associates or in proportion to the amount of good they could do us or we could do them. He then proposed to study our relations with Christ under these heads. Christ, the speaker said, embodies all those qualities which we most admire in our friends. He was absolutely truthful, even when on trial for His life. He was unselfish, spending His whole life for others. He was brave, and absolutely fearless when supporting some great religious truth. He was spotlessly holy, as the demons themselves bore witness. And His whole life was filled to the brim with love for the children, for His disciples, and even for His enemies. Was ever such a man as this? Again, a man's service to you, said Dr. Thompson, is of value according to the amount of good it does you and according to the cost at which the service was rendered. Christ has given us the most priceless gift in the world: He has revealed to us the value of our souls and opened a way to us whereby we may gain salvation. And He has done this for us at the expense of the greatest agony, physical, mental, and spiritual.
