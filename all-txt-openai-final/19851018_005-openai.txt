**M&M Soda Shop Continues Tradition**

By Nelle McCorkle

In any other restaurant, seeing a customer ring up her own total on the cash register might be startling; at
the M&M Soda Shop on Main Street, this sight indicates business as usual.

Mary Potts, owner and co-founder of the M&M, began the business with her late partner and friend Murray Fleming on
October 28, 1951. Fleming, the other “M” in the shop’s name, died in May 1984.

Of the firm’s payment policy, Potts said, “I think it [allowing students to total and pay their bills directly into
the cash register] gives them the feeling that we trust them. The whole thirty-four years there’ve been a few who
love to do that. A few squeeze their own orangeade—I think it makes them feel at home, and that’s what
I want.

“Lots walk out and forget to pay—they’ve always come back and paid.”

One of the M&M’s great appeals is its unchanging menu. With helpers Judy Nance and Willie Torrance, Potts prepares M&M
specialties of egg salad and Big O's [a crushed ice concoction including fresh-squeezed orange juice] Monday through Saturday from 7:30
a.m. to 3:00 p.m.

Busily preparing for Friday night's Class of 1950 reunion party to be held at the M&M, Potts calmly announces that
she will use twelve pounds of bread for the party sandwiches. “The students,” she explains, “really keep me going. It's
always so great when they come by to see you and they usually do!”

**College Bowl: Right on the Button**

By Sara Beasley

Lights are flashing, bells are ringing, and buzzers are buzzing in the Union.

It’s Monday night and College Bowl Intramurals are keeping players and spectators on the edges of their seats. “Who was
the first man to run the four-minute mile?” “Roger Bannister!” answers Rand Hartsell, with a brilliant “buzz.”

College Bowl Intramurals have gotten off to a fast and fun start. Where else can you find freshmen making seniors
look foolish? Where else can you watch the Universal Solvent interact with Nutt's Knights in a chemical conflagration? Where else
can you watch Jim’s Mom was a Queenie suffer from the Solipsistic Plague?

Next Monday's games offer promising matches. Watch Sons of Buzz Aldrin (led by hot-on-the-buzzers Dan Murrey and Richard Tankard) take
on Alcoholics Unanimous. Relentless Picnic offers tantalizing food before every match. “Will Bfongo Motts and the Apemen be able to
digest it all? And will Les Idiots Savants, featuring Rob Norman, be able to beat the New Wrong, featuring Steven
White’s calm assurance at the buzzer?” Come to the Union any time from 7 p.m. until 8:30 p.m. to catch
College Bowl action.

The Varsity team will be traveling to Berry College once again for the Invitational Early Bird Tournament on November 1-2.
Team members are giving up a visit with their parents to play College Bowl against other teams from the South.
This year’s team is quite different from last year’s senior-dominated squad. Sophomores Jeff Gregory and Mark Chen, juniors Edwin Page
and Gordon Watkins, and senior Sara Beasley compose the team. They are younger but they hope to maintain Davidson's strong
record in College Bowl tournaments.

**Policeman Enjoys Young People’s Company**

By Jeff Lesesne

Davidson police officer Rickey Moore became one of the newest members of the Campus Police force in September of 1984.
Moore came to Davidson from the Iredell County Sheriff's department, where he served from 1982-1984.

Moore, a native of Mooresville, went to the police academy and became a lieutenant in 1972. He served with the
Mooresville Police Department until 1979.

In 1980, Moore became Chief of Police at Holden Beach, N.C. The Holden Beach town board awarded him a commendation
for extraordinary service in dealing with organized crime and drug trafficking.

Because of his discouragement with law enforcement, Moore resigned from the Holden Beach Police Department in 1982. He came to
Davidson after a five-month break.

“It is more appealing to work around young people,” Moore said. “I've enjoyed it more than any place I've ever
been, as far as law enforcement.”

Moore holds the qualifications for an advanced law enforcement certificate. He has taken over 1000 hours of credit in law
enforcement schools. He has training in family crisis intervention and domestic problems, as well as experience in dealing with organized
crime and drugs.

Moore was a fireman and ambulance attendant in Mooresville before becoming an officer. It was from this safety work that
he became interested in police work.

Moore is married and has one son in the Air Force.
