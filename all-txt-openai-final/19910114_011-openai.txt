Nomad's Horoscopes

If today is your birthday, so
what.

* *

Capricorn (Dec. 22-Jan. 19):
If you were an animal you would
be reptilian or something that bur-
rows through dirt. Be ready for a
man named Eddy. Taurus would
be included if he didn’t have better
things to do.

Aquarius (Jan. 20-Feb. 18):
Person will say, “You have acne.”
Focus on benzoyl peroxide and
staying home. If you read your
cards right, you just might be
able to market your face as a

pizza.
Pisces (Feb. 19-March 20):
The stars don’t like you. What
you thought was rain was actu-
ally several constellations wee-
weeing on your head. Jackie’s
gonna be a football star.
Aries (March 21-April 19):
Diane’s debutante backseat of
Jackie’s car. Spotlight on Zamfir,
master of the pan flute. High-
lighters highlighted.
Taurus (April 20-May 20):
If you had a hammer, you’d ham-
mer it in the morning. You'd

hammer it in the evening. All over
this world.

Gemini (May 21-June 20):
Worms will crawl in your ears
while you sleep, eat your brain,
and bore through your skull by

morning. Don’t worry, they’re only

worms and need to eat, too. Tin
and noble gases in the picture.
Cancer (June 21-July 22):

I’ve got a headache this big and it’s
got Excedrin written all over it.
Concentrate on why you are here,
what your career plans are, why
you are here, and what your career
plans are. Roses are red and bruises
are a black-purplish color, Scorpio
is a collection of stars in the sky
and you are not.

Leo (July 23-Aug. 22):

Today is your day. Expect the best
of all worlds. But today you will
also vanish from this earth or, at
least, be in an accident involving
garbanzo beans (also known as

chickpeas), so enjoy it while you

can, which won't be for long I can
tell you right now.

Virgo (Aug. 23-Sept. 22):

A booger will sit under your nose
between your nostrils where you
won’t be able to see it until you are

getting ready for bed in the eve-
ning at which point, it is too dry to
remove, so you have to wear it for
the rest of your life or get it re-
moved with the risk of also losing
your nose, which would be good
since you’d lose eleven pounds
since you have a big nose.
Libra (Sept. 23-Oct. 22):
There’s really not much to say
except that what you are doing
right now is stupid and anything
else you do today, tomorrow, or
any day is also stupid. Dentures
in the picture.

Scorpio (Oct. 23-Nov. 21):
Islands in the stream, that is what
we are. Nothing in between. How
can we be wrong. Sail away with
me. To another world. And we
rely on each other. Aa-aa. Islands

in the stream, that is what we are.

Sagittarius (Nov. 22-Dec. 21):
The world is an egg in your hands.

You put the egg in some water in

order to make a hard-boiled egg.

You cook the egg too long. Be-
cause of what you did and be-

cause the world is an egg; you,

therefore, cooked the world too

long. Way to go. Hope you’re

happy.
