#### Fairies lament of boredom, report slight softball action

By THE THREE FAIRIES

This has been undoubtedly the slowest week in IMAC sports history. The lack of action has been attributed primarily to
the popularity of certain indoor sports over the past week, and there’s been no volleyball. Rays, lays, and J's replaced
bases, bats, and balls.

We would be able to write a half-decent article this week, if first, anything had happened; if, second, we could
obtain a visa from the history department in order to leave the library; if, third, we really cared.

In the little softball action which did occur, Felix Japp and John Tatum umpired their best game of the year
as Richardson I fell in a hard-fought forfeit to the Inquisition.

Proving their entrepreneurial abilities, the speedy pair of Japp and Tatum was able to pick up an extra two bucks
by officiating the Castrati’s 18-8 victory over PIKA at the same time (God bless free enterprise!).

Speaking of “umpires,” why don’t you jackasses start writing something about these games on the cards so we will be
able to abuse people we don’t know. Go ahead, make something up.

In other thrillers, the Flaming A’s blasted Buford’s Battalion 9-0, Spring Fever fragged the Rowdy Rotcies 24-13, and the Bongs
stained D.C. and the Polychetes 12-5.

The Wooley Greys forfeited to Cannon II, as Mike Gibson showed up and the rest of the Greys refused to
play. Incidentally, the print-hungry quasi-jocks of Cannon II have repeatedly begged us for ink. These boys are under the mistaken
impression that they have talent, a quality lacking in the entire freshman class. By the way, we transferred in as
sophomores.

Passive Indifference had the Thi’s down 11-5, only to be ten run-ruled three innings later, 22-12. Jimmy Stephenson made dinner
on time.

Division-leading Spring Fever had their bubble burst by Brad Sebastian and a new softball. Sebastian hit two ridiculously long home
runs to the opposite field, leading the Kerwood Derbies to a 13-3 victory. Eyball made dinner on time and A.D.
didn’t eat.

This column is now being torn by internal dissension.

All three Phi Delt softball teams went down to defeat this week.

A fourteen-run fourth inning lifted SAE #1 past Delt B, 14-4, the Panama Reds nipped Delt A, 4-3, and Your
Face forfeited to Embo.

OOPS! Rob Mitchell misses a fast one during IMAC softball action this week.

#### Appalachian St. tramples trackmen, SC championships to run next Friday

By DAVE KELLER
Features Editor

Davidson’s trackmen suffered their third loss of the season last Thursday when they fell to Appalachian State 105-56 in a
dual meet at Boone.

With a smaller team than usual, the Cats “ran as well as we expected,” according to track coach Sterling Martin,
but were overpowered by ASU, who also took second place in last week’s Davidson Relays.

“We didn’t stack the meet like we could have, but then neither did they,” Martin added; “The score was just
about what we had predicted.”

The Cats had only two first places in the contest—Jarry Taylor’s 131’ hammer throw and Carl McPhail’s 44’9½” triple jump—but
had a number of good second place performances.

The high point of the meet came when Doug Horn took second place in the mile with 4:16.6 to break
the old school record of 4:18 set by Pete Ashcraft in 1956. Horn was beaten by two seconds by ASU’s
Louis Blount, who passed Horn on the final stretch.

Other Davidson second place finishes were Allen Schaberg in discus, Bill Cole in the steeplechase, Ray Berberick in the javelin,
Bob Schermer in the 100 and 220, and McPhail in the 120 high and 440 intermediate hurdles.

McPhail’s time of 15.1 in the highs was a personal record.

Fred Borch, after trailing the field by almost half a lap, came back to take second in the three mile
run, and John Stanfield also had a second place in the high jump.

Stanfield cleared 6’0” and went out at 6’2” after sustaining an ankle injury which, according to Martin, “could possibly hurt
him in the conference meet.”

The Cats’ next action is here Saturday against The Citadel in a meet which Martin calls “our toughest yet.” Martin
added that “we should win if everyone is healthy and performs up to par.” He said that his strategy for
the contest would be to “get firsts where we can and rely on our greater depth to carry us through.”

The trackmen, with a 2-3 record, need The Citadel meet for an even season.

A week from this Friday, the Southern Conference championship meet will be held at Davidson. Martin urged that, as for
the Davidson Relays, he needs a large number of students to help run that meet.
