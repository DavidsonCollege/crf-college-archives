**New coaches inject shot of vitality into b-ball**

By SUZANNE CRAYMER

Davidson’s basketball program is under new leadership with the appointment of a former assistant coach and a member of the 1982 national championship team at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Bob McKillop and Matt Doherty were named head coach and assistant coach, respectively, last May. McKillop is replacing Bobby Hussey, who resigned in mid-April after an eight-year record of 108-127.

McKillop served as Davidson’s assistant coach in 1978-79 and returns after 10 years at Lutheran High School in Long Island, New York. McKillop left Lutheran with an overall record of 182-51, and says he comes to Davidson with a commitment to win while maintaining academic integrity, a sentiment Doherty shares.

“I am looking forward to coaching in an atmosphere that combines the commitment to excellence in athletics with that of excellence in academics,” stated McKillop. “At Davidson, there exists that rare combination of not only coaching at the Division I level, but also the highest possible academic prestige.”

McKillop demonstrates his commitment to academics by lecturing at such camps as the National Coaches’ Clinic and the Italian National Olympic Federation. In accepting his position in May, McKillop identified recruiting as one of his first priorities. He gained such experience while serving as a scout for the Utah Jazz last year and working as Davidson’s assistant coach in 1978-79. During his year at Davidson he recruited ‘83 graduate John Carroll, who holds Davidson’s second-best record in career assists. This year McKillop filled the vacancy caused by the departure of 1988-89 freshman Bruce Elder with Detlef Musch, one of his players at Lutheran.

Assistant coach Doherty started on North Carolina’s 1982 national championship team with Michael Jordan and James Worthy. He was drafted by the Cleveland Cavaliers after his senior season. Due to injuries and other reasons, Doherty did not remain with the Cavaliers. He soon moved from basketball to Wall Street.

“After being on Wall Street for four years I realized it wasn’t what I wanted to do and came down to Charlotte in the hopes of getting into real estate.” Yet his longing for basketball led him into broadcasting the Davidson games on radio. When McKillop offered him the position in May, he readily accepted and has now been at Davidson for five months. His main job is recruiting next year’s team.

According to Doherty, “There’s a certain attitude in coaching. You dream, envision and then expect. The harder you work, the more you fulfill your dreams.”

“There are four components of any good athletic program,” he explained, “a school athletic director, coaching staff, a facility and players.” “We have three and I’m working on the fourth.”

Citing Davidson’s excellent academic record as well as athletic promise, Doherty thinks of Davidson as an easy product to sell to prospective players. “People from all over want to go here,” he stated. In addition to recruiting new players, Doherty also expects a lot from Davidson’s senior players. “The program needs a shot in the arm,” he concluded, “and we're going to give it to them.”mp sb abi ‘Volleyball team 3.055. | a challengers. | aa Bitk ree ask ¥ 3hOG ee - Bile © atte? ] = a in the country.” Doherty says, “After working on \ What will Davidson football look like in Division III?

Last winter the Davidson trustees decided, on the recommendation of both the athletic committee and former Athletic Director Kit Morris, to drop football from the Division IAA level to Division III. The expected mass exodus of football players provoked by the decision left the Wildcats with slightly over 30 returning players, only 13 of whom can be considered returning starters. This gives fifth-year head coach Vic Gatto an excellent core for his starting lineup; but where this core ends is where the problems for the 1989 season begin. With only a dozen or so freshmen joining the squad, the biggest challenge facing Coach Gatto and his staff is developing a depth that will be sorely needed in the latter part of the season, as injuries begin to take their toll.

Finding a starting quarterback seemed like the least of the Wildcats’ worries as Peter Hughes, the starter for the better part of the last three years, seemed ready to return for his senior campaign. Unfortunately, a summer hand injury will keep him out until at least the third week of action. Ready to replace Hughes are junior Mark Wainwright and sophomore Matt Matheny. Both are capable but unproven since neither has seen playing time during the regular season.

The offensive line (avg. 6'3", 250 lbs.) should be strong this year as Gat Caperton and Burt Williams return for the fourth year. Add last year’s offensive MVP junior Chris Woods, junior Paul Byrne, sophomore Ashton Lloyd, and senior Jeff Swyers, and the Wildcats’ offensive line should match up well with every defense on their schedule. Behind this beefy line is what could be a collection of the best backs Coach Gatto has ever assembled at Davidson. With a switch to the Power I formation this fall for a more ball-control offense, the Wildcats should improve on the 135 yards per game they averaged in 1988.

Junior Bryn Robinson, 1987's leading rusher, is returning after knee surgery. Last year’s freshman surprise and leading scorer, Mike Wright, will see significant playing time as well. Expect to see number 30, junior Ralph Isernia, line up in a variety of spots this year. After averaging over 13 yards per attempt when the ball was in his hands last year, he is sure to become this year’s all-purpose back. Junior Kearns Davis will handle the wide receiver position while senior Tony Lambert and sophomore Jebo Barnes will be at the tight ends.

If senior co-captain Ken Nazemetz recovers from a pre-season shoulder injury in time for opening day, the defensive front four will all be returning starters. The pressure provided by two-time defensive MVP senior Mike Rogers, senior Tim Weaver, and junior Steve Veitch should keep opposing quarterbacks looking over their shoulders all season. The rest of the defense, except for senior co-captain Harry Schiavi, is filled with question marks. At linebacker, all of last year’s pro...
