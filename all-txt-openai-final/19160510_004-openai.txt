CLASS BASE BALL. In an exciting game on Wednesday, May 4th, the Sophs won from the Fresh with a score
of 12 to 9. Until the seventh inning, the Fresh had a big lead, when the Sophs pulled up and
won, owing to their own heavy hitting and the errors of the Fresh. Batteries: Sophs, Fowle and King; Fresh, Nimocks
and Burns. On Friday, May 5, the Fresh were again defeated, this time by the Juniors, by a 14-7 score.
The game as a whole was slow and accompanied with weak fielding and batting. The Juniors hit Nimocks' delivery pretty
freely, while the Fresh didn’t succeed in bunching many hits off White. Batteries: Juniors, White and White; Fresh: Nimocks and
Burns. The Sophs defeated the Juniors Monday morning 6 to 4, thereby tying the latter team for first place honors.
The game was close and interesting throughout, although misplays were rather frequent. The pitching of McKeithen for the Sophs was
a feature. Batteries: Juniors, W. Keesler and B. White; Sophs, McKeithen and King.

DAVIDSON WINS TENNIS MEET FROM ELON In a match that proved easy for Davidson, Saunders and Finley defeated White and
Hardcastle, of Elon, last Friday afternoon in both doubles and singles. Saunders from the first was the star of the
afternoon, while Finley at the net allowed nothing to pass. Hardcastle, for Elon, played a steady game, and White also
came in with several spurts of pretty play. In the first set in doubles, Davidson took the first four games,
but Elon came in with a couple and the set ended 6-2 for Davidson. The second set was the hardest
fought of the match, but Davidson finally won 8-6. The first match of singles was played between Saunders and Hardcastle.
Saunders won both sets, 6-4, 6-2. Finley won from White 6-4, 6-0.

SOPHS DEFEAT “ALL-STARS.” A picked team from the Soph class, including Varsity players, defeated an aggregation of stars from the
rest of the student body in a fast game Thursday, the score being 6 to 4. The latter team was
strengthened by Coaches Fetzer and Kluttz, and also “Ty” Caldwell. The Sophs found Currie easy in the first of the
game, while the All-Stars were powerless before the speed of Hengeveld. Lawson, who succeeded Hengeveld in the sixth, was not
quite as effective and four runs were scored off his delivery. Alford succeeded Currie in the sixth and allowed but
one hit. This, coupled with a pass, enabled the Sophs to score their final tally. The pitching of Hengeveld and
the catching of Coach Fetzer were features. Batteries: All-Stars, Currie, Alford and Fetzer; Sophs, Hengeveld, Lawson and Saunders.

SCRUBS DEFEAT KANNAPOLIS. The Davidson second team defeated Kannapolis at Kannapolis Saturday afternoon by the score of 13 to 0.
The game was featured by the hitting of McKinnon, who made a home run and triple. The pitching of Currie
and the fielding of Boswell also were features. Score: R. H. E. Davidson 13 12 2 Kannapolis 0 8 7
Batteries: Currie and Keesler; Roberts, Taylor and Williams.

Professor Fulbright, who has been conducting a class in expression here for about four weeks, is leaving Saturday. Mr. Fulbright
had made many friends here who regret his leaving.

HIGH SCHOOL GIVES COMMENCEMENT PLAY On last Friday night, the High School commencement play was presented in Shearer Hall, and
proved interesting to all. First on the program was “A Tom Thumb Wedding.” Among some of the distinguished couples at
the wedding were Mr. and Mrs. Wilson, Mr. and Mrs. AndrewCarnegie and Mr. and Mrs. Vanderbilt. The bride was Miss
Mildred Hobbs, the groom Howerton Alexander. The second number was “A Quarrel,” and following this a selection from Miss Minerva
and William Green Hill, with characters William Green Hill, Joe McConnell; Jimmie, Hubert Mooney; Frances, Ruth Ervin. Then Miss Dorothy
Finlayson sang a solo, taking the part of Geraldine Farrar. The last number of the evening was “O You Teacher,”
with Sam Brady as teacher and Douglas Brown as assistant teacher. The whole exercise was a success, and all the
pupils went through their parts in a creditable manner, due largely to the careful coaching of the teachers.

LYCEUM ATTRACTION.

On last Saturday evening the last number of the Lyceum course, that the M. C. A. has been giving this
year, was presented in Shearer Hall. The entertainment included a number of solos, duets, impersonations, and concluded with a one-act
play which embraced all of the above parts. The impersonation given by Mr. Bohannan, of the Irish father with his
little motherless child, was good. Another impressive feature of the entertainment was the appeal made in speech and song to
the persons in the audience to remember their mothers and fathers. The form of the song in each case was
the acrostic of “mother” and “father.” The songs and accompaniment of Mrs. Bohannan formed another pleasing part of the program.

“The Palace,” Davidson’s moving picture house, opened its doors to the public on Thursday night with a large attendance. Two
performances will be given each night of the week, at 7:15 and 8:00, with a matinee on Saturday at 3:00
p.m. D. W. Lane, '17, is operator. The management announces a change of program each day, showing four reels of
first-class pictures at each performance.
