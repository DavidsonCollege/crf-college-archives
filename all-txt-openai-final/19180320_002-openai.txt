**EDITORIAL**

We are here to serve our COLLEGE, ALUMNI, our GOVERNMENT, and AMERICAN UNIVERSITY. We are going to be in it.

**THE CLUB**

We favor conserving daylight. No tin or copper going into the Philanthropic Society medal this year.

Statistics from the Columbia University Library show that three hundred and twenty-six books were published last year by three hundred
of its alumni. One-half of the authors graduated within the last six years. The date of graduation of the other
authors dates back as far as 1853. This is a fine record. Do you know what Davidson did last year
in book making? If not, we can't tell you here. Ask Miss Shaw.

**IMITATING HEAVEN**

There is a conundrum connected with the shaven heads of those of our student body. Why are their heads so
much like heaven? There is no dyeing or parting there. The other day we requested a reporter to go and
get a write-up of two members of the faculty. He turned red so that we could not see him blush
and said, "I can’t do it! Get someone who hasn't had his head shaved." Another was heard to complain that
he had neuralgia since he had his (red?) hair clipped. The majority think it is fine sport.

**DAVIDSON HISTORIC**

The community in which we are set has a number of places of interest for those who are hero worshippers
and for those possessed with a mania for historical data and detail. Gen. D. H. Hill is buried in the
Davidson cemetery. The grave of General Davidson, which is of more than historic interest, is at Hopewell Church, not far
remote. Near Mount Mourne there is a spot of interest. On the roadside is a large slab bearing this inscription:

"Site of Torrence Tavern, Where Skirmish Between British and Americans Occurred February, 1781. Erected by Mary Slocum Chapter D.A.R., 1914."

There are other spots of interest. There is an old tree nearby which we are told is significant in the
history of the Presbyterian Church in North Carolina. If you want to see a freak in the form of a
wonderful rock formation, take the hike to Egg Rock. These are places worth seeing.

**AMERICAN UNIVERSITY CLUB**

We were glad when Professor Currie, at chapel Monday morning, presented the cause dear to the hearts of all of
us. This is that Davidson is to have participation in the club house in Paris. What a fine idea! For
the Davidson men who, with Private Peat, "come smiling out of hell," there will be afloating place in Paris—a place
that is theirs. The Red and Black colors and pennants will rouse their spirits. The Davidsonian will be there to
inform them of things on the Hill. All of us doubtless approve of it. This approval will cost the college
one hundred dollars a year. Make your approval evident by not forgetting to give your contribution to McConnell or to
Professor Currie. It is a real privilege to have a share in equipping this place for college men. Make your
donation tonight.

WHY THE CLASSICS?

Much labor and ink has been shamefully wasted in knocking the study of classics in a college curriculum. This thing
of casting them off is superficial and tends to substitute other elements in the place of culture—one of the greatest
things which can be obtained from a college course. What makes a poem or a drama or any form of
literature a classic? Here is the apt definition of Dr. Harding: It lies in the expression of the primary emotions
and sentiments of the heart, which were essentially the same as they are today. They were expressed in a velvet
smoothness. Today is just the past again entered through another gate. Most of the fine ideals held up now as
some new striking propaganda have their counterpart and analogous situation in classical literature. This is illustrated by a passage from
Sophocles’ Oedipus the King in which the Priest says:

"Do not give us cause
So to remember this thy reign, as men,
Who having risen, then fall low again;
But raise our state to safety."

What but this are Americans today saying to the greatest Davidsonian? We do not use these columns for advertising purposes
but we would like to urge men interested in culture and literature—the very best that has been thought and said—to
take Greek literature in their work next year. It is a profitable study. On Greek mythology and literature the foundation
for English literature is found. Why not study this as a foundation for literature and as an interpretation of human
nature? Sophomore English would mean much more to a student if at the beginning of the term two or three
weeks would be devoted to a rapid study of Gayley's Classic Myths, or some other accredited edition of mythology. When
planning your course for next year, consider this Greek literature. Both Professor Fulton and Dr. Harding will recommend it.

MAJOR MCCONNELL'S LETTER

In another column of this issue is a fine and highly interesting letter from Maj. T. W. MacConnell. He makes
us feel better about conditions in camp life and gave The Davidsonian a welcome suggestion. We are always glad to
hear from Major MacConnell. Many thanks to him.

The following are the books which have recently been received at the library: "English and Engineering," by Aydelotte; "A Biography
of William F. Hatcher," by Eldridge Hatcher; "Studies in Milton," by Sampson; "The Life and Letters of John Fiske," by
Clark, two volumes; and "These Many Years," by Matthews.
