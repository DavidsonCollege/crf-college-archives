**Vance and Fowler**

By DAVID WILLIAMS

The office of citizen “is the most important public position in America,” U.S. Senator Wyche Fowler ’62 said last Friday in an address at the annual Spring Awards Convocation, where he was presented an honorary degree by the college. “But the office of citizen is too often taken for granted, left vacant by apathy, or filled only halfheartedly,” he said.

Fowler, a Georgia Democrat who last November became the first Davidson alumnus elected to the Senate, said that only 38 percent of those citizens eligible to vote went to the polls during the 1986 elections. “By this simplest means of citizenship, voter turnout, we are becoming bystanders in the governing of our Republic,” he said. “This is not the citizen envisioned by the Founding Fathers as they constructed the charter of our freedoms, our Constitution.”

Observing that the American Constitution “is a declaration of the values that bind our diversity into one nation under God,” Fowler said that “these values taken together form the image of the American citizen.” He said, “That citizen as envisioned by the framers is above all an active citizen, a tolerant citizen, and an educated citizen.”

Fowler stressed that the survival of American democracy depends directly on “the citizen’s ability to understand his or her constitutional rights and duties and to translate that understanding into civic activism.” He said American citizens need to “renew our sense of community and our sense of a public life that is much more than the sum of our private lives.” He asserted that the American democratic system “will never be harmed by vigorous disagreement and debate” or by the “involvement of its citizens,” but that “it will languish in the presence of indifference and apathy.”

Regarding the notion of tolerance, Fowler noted that the American population “is one of the most ethnically, racially, and religiously diverse on earth.” He said that the democratic way of life depends upon the “willingness of large numbers of people simply to be tolerant of others.” He noted that tolerance is “the core constitutional virtue, because it makes possible our other civic virtues.”

Fowler said that the role of education in a democracy should be “to help get individuals into shaping our citizens being the foremost.” He added: “Just as the Constitution embodies our national ideals and values, so does Davidson’s educational heritage embody our deepest beliefs about ourselves and our world.”

Also receiving honorary degrees at Convocation ceremonies were Former Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and Davidson alumni, William Pritchett ’29 and John Templeton ’37. Vance was Secretary of State from 1977-1980 during the Carter administration. Pritchett is a Professor Emeritus of Classics at the University of California-Berkeley and Templeton is Professor of Surgery at the Jefferson Medical College of Philadelphia.

**On Foreign Policy**

By DAVID WILLIAMS

At a luncheon before Convocation last Friday, former Secretary of State Cyrus Vance agreed to answer questions from students, faculty, and alumni concerning international affairs. Following are excerpts from his remarks:

On “glasnost” and reform in the Soviet Union:

Soviet leader Gorbachev has come to the conclusion that his country has been slipping for the last twelve years or so, and that it can no longer continue as it has or it will become really a second-rate world power. Therefore, he feels that radical reform is necessary both domestically in terms of the economy and also in terms of their international trade.

As a consequence of this, I think you are going to see a concentration on modernizing the Soviet economy to the extent they are able to do this. In order to do this, I think the Soviet Union needs a period of relative quiet in external affairs and therefore I think that we are going to have a period during the next several years ahead where we have more leverage in international discussions and negotiations than we have had for twenty or twenty-five years.

Now, to me this means we shouldn’t be starry-eyed. It means we’ve got to remain strong.
