I Gained Blessed Relief

“Before I took ‘Inner Aid’ I was a nervous wreck; I couldn't speak. About two weeks ago, Dr. Cunningham appeared
before the student body, announcing several investigations were begun by the faculty, and another by the Student Store managers. Now
after only six years of taking this wonderful stuff, I have found blessed relief. People don’t believe I’m the same
person. I only beat my wife once a week instead of six times, since I learnt of your cure-all. Please
send me one year's supply at your price, 25 cents.” Signed, Paid advertisement by Dave Blevins.

STUDENT BODY TRAITS...
In a recent statement printed on Page One, Dr. Cunningham expressed the hope that the infinitesimal amount of money made
on the campus would hold him in good stead. He spoke of the faculty investigations and the bibliomanic pursuits. The
Student Store managers have instituted a search to find means of raising the profit even more. In order to aid
this, they have hiked up the cost of tennis shoes and set up a counterfeiting machine in Cop Linker’s workshop.

Friday and Saturday
“THE JAZZ SINGER”

At the annual meeting of college students held at Fort Knox, Kentucky, the honor system—after everybody was searched they signed
a pledge. Mr. M. I. Cheatham, chairman of the meeting, commented on the Davidson Development and in closing he couldn’t
believe he had only one dollar left. I was delirious!
