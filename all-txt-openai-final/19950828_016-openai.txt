Outdoors’ Odyssey

taxes freshman participants
Eighty students take part in outdoors adventure

By Beth Lindsey

Eighty freshmen, tired and
dirty but exuberant, returned to
Davidson last Thursday after a six-
day journey sponsored by
Davidson Outdoors.

The week-long adventure in-
cluded a mixture of hiking, rafting,
“fun-yacking,” canoeing, and ser-
vice. The 80 freshmen were di-
vided into eight crews with 22 up-
perclassmen leaders.

After hiking for three days,
the crews explored various rivers
such as the Chattooga and the
French Broad before completing a
final service project and returning
to Davidson for orientation.

According to its leaders, the
Odyssey offers freshmen an in-
valuable opportunity to make the
transition to college life more eas-
ily by mixing freshmen with
upperclass students, faculty, and
staff in a non-academic environ-
ment.

Says Jean Boehmler, a sopho-
more trip leader, “It was so much
fun. We spent our day of service
with a river conservation group at
the Chattooga. Because the river is
so scenic, we spent our day work-
ing with the group to preserve the
cleanliness of the river by reseed-
ing, draining, and maintaining the
local trails. We really learned a lot
about the area and got to help out.”

The reactions of freshmen
were also positive. Freshman
Shauna Griffin enjoyed hiking the
Appalachian Trail and working for
Habitat for Humanity. Her favor-
ite part, however, was “getting to
know nine other people really well
before classes actually start.”

Freshman Erin Floyd agreed
and added, “I was dirty, wet, and
smelly when I got back but it cer-
tainly was worth it to meet fellow
freshmen and to make a few con-
nections before school officially
starts.”

Athletic Director
search continues

The slow train that is
Davidson’s search for a new ath-
letic director left the station over
the summer and is gradually be-
ginning to pick up speed.

The five-person search com-
mittee and two advisory members
are currently picking through ap-
proximately 85 applications to fill
the position left when Terry Hol-
land became Athletic Director at
the University of Virginia.

Just as he did five years ago
before Holland came to Davidson,
Sterling Martin is serving as in-
terim athletic director.

Over the summer, the search
committee met three times, in part
because President Kuykendall,
who is also the search committee
chairman, was out of the country
for a long time.

After it finishes reviewing the
applications, the group will likely
narrow its list to 10-15 people to
bring in for preliminary interviews
and then bring in three-five final-
ists for more extensive interviews.

While the group has yet to sit
down and discuss what exactly it’s
looking for in a new A.D., mem-
bers seem to recognize the impor-
tance of a couple traits. Most im-
portantly, they apparently want
somebody who supports and wants
to maintain the high academic stan-
dards at Davidson.

In a list of general criteria that
went along with an ad in the NCAA
News and the Chronicle of Higher
Education that the school was re-
quired to publish, Davidson said
its new A.D. should demonstrate
“a strong commitment to academ-
ics and the success of student ath-
letes in and out of the classroom.”

At the same time, though, the
committee wants to continue the
tremendous success of athletics
recently. “Basically, we’re looking
for someone who understands
Davidson,” Nisbet said. “Davidson
is in a unique situation, being a
small school and playing in the
Southern Conference.”

A national reputation, which
Holland brought with him, does
not seem to be a requirement in this
search. “We’re not necessarily
looking for someone with a na-
tional reputation, but someone who
knows what’s best for Davidson,”
Nisbet said.

There is no set timetable for
having a new A.D. in place, al-
though some committee members
would apparently like to see some-
body in place by the end of the
year.

“We won’t move any more
slowly than any other schools,”
Kazee said. “If anything, knowing
John, we’ll move more quickly
than others.”
