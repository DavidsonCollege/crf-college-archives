Solidarity goals

More letters

Dear Editors:

Divest from South Africa

An open letter to all Davidson students:

We would like you to know about us. We, the Solidarity Committee, are committed to bettering the Davidson College environment
for all students, regardless of their race, nationality, or creed. We are working for you; we are working with you.

The pages of The Davidsonian have been full of articles on racism on our campus. Many black and international students
feel isolated at Davidson. We can all see that there are problems which need to be addressed because they are
everyone's problems. The Student Government has called the Solidarity Committee to work for solutions to racism and isolation and all
that separates the Davidson community. We will be working on a grassroots level to combat the subtle, and sometimes not-so-subtle,
expressions of racism.

Ignorance is one of the main reasons for racism on our campus. Many students believe there is no problem of
feeling welcome here, perhaps because they “fit in” to campus life immediately. However, some minorities face many problems. We will
seek solutions through various activities and forums that will enable students to participate and to learn from one another. Our
goal is to achieve what our name represents—Solidarity. And when the quality of life improves for all Davidson students, then
perhaps the Solidarity Committee will no longer be needed.

We believe Davidson has the capacity to change. Please enable us to help you be a part of that change.
Our meetings are open, and we welcome your ideas. The next meeting will be at 7:00 on Monday, November 20,
in the Lilly Conference Room of the Library.

Solidarity Committee Chairs

Since graduation in 1988, I have looked back fondly upon my memories of Davidson College. Outside of the safe harbor
of Davidson, people aren’t as friendly or as willing to offer a smile; nobody does my laundry or my cooking
for me; and I can find no place to get free beer. Davidson certainly is a unique place, a Paradise
on earth. Too bad such a wonderful college has to earn its keep from its investments in oppression and slavery.
By retaining its vested interests in companies dealing in South Africa, Davidson is giving its tacit consent to genocide. I
love my alma mater, but I cannot support such an institution which fosters so much affection amongst its white middle
and upper class student body and cares so little for the teeming masses of blacks in South Africa. Therefore, I
am sending my token contribution of $25 to the annual fund. However, the moment Davidson divests from South Africa I
will increase my contribution to at least $150 per year. My small contribution will not change the minds of Davidson’s
trustees, but should more graduates take the same notion, the trustees would have a sound financial reason for getting off
the pot and giving F.W. de Klerk a sound vote of no confidence by divesting.

“They are Davidsonians who will make a difference in their communities.”
