SYMPOSIUM INITIATED

Hawkins Analyzes LSD Effects

By JIM COOLEY
Staff Writer

Dr. David Hawkins, a psychiatrist and faculty member of the University of North Carolina Medical School, initiated a second semester LSD symposium sponsored by the College Union and the YMCA in a chapel address to the student body Monday on the history, effects, and dangers of the controversial drug.

Hawkins traced the development of the drug directly to experiments by a young Swiss investigator, Dr. Albert Hoffman, in 1943. After publication of his results four years later, research was stepped up; but before elaborating on the rather alarming aspects of this research, Hawkins turned to a consideration of the drug and its effects.

He described LSD as a tasteless, odorless, colorless derivative of a fungus which, taken in very minute quantities (75-100 micrograms), can produce profound effects from eight to 24 hours. Few other drugs work in as small a quantity as LSD, yet there is “very little physiological effect,” he noted.

The common adjective used to classify LSD is “psychedelic” which Hawkins translated from the Greek as “mind-manifesting.” LSD actually changes the function of the mind in a manner similar to alcohol and opiates, he explained, but it lacks the lingering effects which the latter produce.

Hawkins admitted that there are several problems in trying to describe what it is like to take a “trip.” Sense impressions are so vivid and unusual that a proper vocabulary does not exist to describe the experience. Another problem results from the fact that the drug affects different people in different ways and even the same person experiences various effects when he takes the drug at different times.

A person's “psychological make-up” at the time of taking LSD, and, even more importantly, the setting in which the drug is taken alter the drug's effects. LSD is obtained in the form of a pill; however, illegal distribution of it is usually in an aqueous solution which is placed upon a sugar cube. Approximately 30 minutes after taking the drug, lights become bright and seem to shimmer. Hawkins described the changes in perception which take place through the use of a rug which seemed to increase in depth and to exhibit beautiful, brightly-colored patterns upon its surface.

Laughter and uncontrollable giggling are symptomatic of the user's extreme happiness during the trip, but these periods of happiness can be followed by other periods of deep depression. A sense of empathy and of thinking that one knows the answer to everything leads the user to what Hawkins termed “the transcendental moment of oneness with the universe” or which has also been called “the clear white light.”

The LSD trip can be a terrifying experience, Hawkins commented, with the periods of happiness followed by depression. The subject should never be left alone while under the influence of the drug. “It is an interesting, intense experience for some,” he concluded, “but for others it is sheer hell.”

Again considering the research which has been carried out recently, Hawkins outlined four areas in which LSD has potential importance. It can be very important in research on mental illnesses, specifically by mimicking certain aspects of those illnesses, and it can be used for the training of mental health workers by giving them some idea of the distortions experienced by schizophrenics. Hawkins indicated that LSD could also have significant therapeutic value, particularly among chronic alcoholics. The fourth possible value of LSD was in providing what Hawkins called a “new religion” through an “expanding of the consciousness.” Though neither agreeing nor disagreeing with the LSD-oriented religious movement headed by Timothy Leary and Richard Albert, he admitted that no new moral or ethical system nor a new philosophical outlook has yet appeared from this movement.

Three dangers were outlined by Hawkins which have arisen from the casual use of LSD. The danger which is present while actually taking the drug is that of poor judgment and the resulting fear, terror, and motivation to self-destruction which has already caused a death at Chapel Hill. Hawkins expressed the opinion that most users of LSD are above average, often artistically inclined, young people from upper middle-class backgrounds. He accounted for their turning to the drug as a desire to break away into new experiences beyond those offered by the middle class. The question which must be asked, explored, and faced by young people today, according to Hawkins, is “Is this trip really necessary?”

Holmes To Hungry d Show

Folk singer and writer Jake Holmes will be appearing nightly at the hungry d club next Monday through Saturday. The hungry d will open each night at 7 p.m. in the Morrison Room. The room is being completely redone for the engagement. Holmes will give one-hour performances at 8 and 9:30 p.m.

The hungry d is Davidson’s equivalent of a night club. The club began as a supper club last year and was very popular. This year the club will be run on a coffee house format. The $1 cover charge includes hors d'oeuvres and drinks. There will be no dinner menu, but food can be ordered at the table. Dress and atmosphere are informal.

Holmes comes to Davidson after engagements in similar clubs at schools in the area, including Duke, UNC, East Carolina and East Tennessee. Particularly at Duke, he was overwhelmingly received. Reservations are not necessary, but the Union advises anyone attending to reserve a table for the time they wish to come. Reservations will be taken at the Union desk, either in person or by phone.

Officer Disputes Story About White Incident

Security Officer Albert Carriker has denied the account in the last issue of THE DAVIDSONIAN of his part in an incident which involved a student who was injured when the rope he was using to climb up the side of Richardson Dormitory broke.

New Library Site Proposed

By BOB DUNHAM
Staff Writer

The area between the College Union and Duke Dormitory has been added to the growing list of possible sites of the proposed new library building. The site was proposed by J. Russell Bailey, an architect from Orange, Va., who visited the campus Wednesday to look over the campus and evaluate possible locations. The Guest House site, which had appeared to be heading the list as the most likely candidate, was felt by Bailey to be too small; he felt that the library would be cramped in the area. He also rejected the idea of making additions to the presentDavid Fisher (R) beams as he and Terry Eastercamp (back to camera) get the rush from Don Gately (L) and Bayard Miller (center).
