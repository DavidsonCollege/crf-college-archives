**Administration examines Davidson’s male/female ratio**

By DAVID PETRANICK

Ever since Davidson began admitting female degree-seeking students in 1973, a popular point of debate has been the changing role and importance of coeducation at Davidson. One especially perennial topic concerns the male-female ratio in admissions. The current ratio is approximately sixty males admitted for every forty females admitted. Many of the questions asked about admissions deal with this specific ratio. Why are more men admitted than women? Should the ratio be a purely fifty-fifty one, or should Davidson adhere to a strictly sex-blind admissions process? Basically, is Davidson living up to its commitment to co-education?

The topic is a delicate one to deal with, especially in light of the consequences involved. Accordingly, decisions made in this area are the responsibility of the Trustees. As the administrator of the college and its activities, President John Kuykendall ’59 is responsible for the implementation of Trustee decisions such as the aforementioned admissions policy. To fully understand the Trustees’ policy and Davidson’s subsequent actions, however, it is useful to have a grasp on the history of coeducation at Davidson.

As most know, Davidson’s Board of Trustees in the early seventies arrived at the conclusion that part of the college’s future involved welcoming female students into Davidson’s normal four-year curriculum, thus shedding what was becoming a slightly outdated single-sex format. There were (and still are) several good reasons for becoming a coeducational institution, not the least of which remains obvious to this day, that there are literally thousands of intelligent, talented, and qualified females who would certainly contribute much to Davidson’s academic and social atmospheres. This has been proven by numerous Stuart Scholars, honors graduates, merit recipients, and other distinguished female leaders in the Davidson College community.

Most rooms which have been open in Chambers during evening hours will be locked at 5 p.m., and some rooms on the south wing of the building which will remain open for study will be locked at midnight, according to a new policy which is currently under negotiation. Registrar Sue Ross says that, due to faculty complaints about the condition of the rooms in the mornings, most of those rooms will be closed so that janitors can make sure that all rooms which are open during the night are clean before 8 a.m. classes. Ross says that the policy, which she emphasizes is still being negotiated, is already in place but will simply be more strictly enforced in the future.

What most do not realize, however, is that coeducation at Davidson got off to a slow start in its first few years. Gardner Roller Ligo, who is now the Associate Dean of Admissions, was a member of the consortium group of 1971-1972, and she recalled what it was like to be one of Davidson’s first female students. “There was a recognizable difference in the sizes of the male and female classes,” Ligo stated, “and this was a direct function of the applicant pool at the time.” As a matter of fact, the original plan set forth by the Board of Trustees was a two to one (male to female) ratio based on projected plans of enrolling one-thousand men and five-hundred women in the student body. The Board later moved to a plan which linked enrollment ratios to application ratios, and which also called for continuous review of the policy. By 1982 the policy, which was regularly and constantly evaluated by the Board of Trustees, had taken on a new range in the form of the current sixty-forty ratio. Again, this ratio was dictated by the results of the applicant pool.

Dr. John Griffith, Vice-President for Institutional Advancement, took the position of Dean of Admissions in 1979, and with it he inherited the two-to-one plan. Griffith pointed out that at the time he took office, the number of qualified women applying to Davidson (as compared to earlier years) was increasing, while the number of qualified men was actually remaining more or less constant, despite increased recruiting efforts. Thus, from academic, recruiting, and social standpoints, it was not only feasible but advantageous to change the policy.

Throughout the eighties, there have been many who have wanted to see Davidson go to a fifty-fifty ratio, or even a sex-blind policy. Dean of Admissions James Hendrix, Jr. ’63 questions the logic behind a switch to sex-blind admissions. “The main question we would have to ask ourselves when implementing such a policy would be ‘To what end are we doing this?’” This proves to be a particularly apt question when one realizes that at a school of Davidson’s size, the percentage range cannot empirically swing any farther than a sixty-forty ratio, simply because the ‘special groups’ at Davidson, e.g. sports, music, etc. would take a beating. If in any one year, the ratio were to hypothetically hit a mark of seventy men to thirty women, women’s sports would have a hard time fielding very many teams at all. The same is true if the situation were reversed.

Therefore, it becomes understandable that Davidson must maintain a reasonable rate of acceptance and not risk using a sex-blind type of system. This does not in any way suggest, however, that Davidson is shirking its own duty to co-education. Rather, as Kuykendall stated, “the Board of Trustees’s decision seems to reflect what we are witnessing take place in the applicant pool.” There are many, however, who maintain that there are in reality some females on the ‘waiting list’ who are essentially stronger than some of the males who are actually accepted. As Griffith and Kuykendall both point out, though, this may not be entirely accurate. “The main problem,” according to Kuykendall, “is that you are trying to evaluate people with parameters that are impossible to set. Every applicant is unique and therefore different, and there is really no way simply to rank everybody on a numerical scale according to SATs or other test scores. Other factors, such as extra-curriculars, have to be taken into account.”

Jim Shaw, an admissions counselor who graduated from Davidson in 1985, agreed with Kuykendall. “We do not just look at test scores as the determining factors in a student’s acceptance to Davidson. While we do rate applicants on an academic scale, they are also rated on a ‘personal’ scale. That is, will they make positive contributions to Davidson?” Ligo also added, “There are two main factors involved. One, can the applicant do the work? And two, will he/she fit in?”into the college community?” When dealing with this particular topic, one is bound to run into several misconceptions. Many of these myths need to be clarified:

Myth 1: Male alumni are more likely to contribute to their alma mater than are their female counterparts. Not true, says Hendrix. “There is no evidence at all which would support that statement, mainly since women have not been here long enough to gain any telling statistics.” “Another difficulty with that,” Kuykendall added, “is the fact that women have been at Davidson for a relatively short time, and thus many may not yet be in a suitable financial position to make major gifts to the college.” Also, there are quite a few females who do play an important role in the college. Ligo, of course, is a perfect example, as is Melissa Jones, ’86, who works in the President’s office, and Kaudie McLean, another admissions counselor.

Myth 2: The football program takes up spaces that should go to other deserving students. “Coach Gatto does not recruit those players who could not make it on their own,” asserted Ligo. Further, “Coach Gatto’s first two recruited classes (’90 and ’91) were some of the strongest in terms of grades and test scores of many of the previous years.” “Besides the football team,” she added, “other sports, the arts, and other special areas of college life also receive extra consideration.”

Myth 3: This issue is currently being ignored by the administration and the Board of Trustees. As Griffith stated, “This policy is constantly re-evaluated every year for timeliness and practicality.” “A very important issue such as this is certainly a concern of ours, and if a change seemed appropriate, I am confident that the Board would take the matter under advisement.”

The final problem, however, is yet to be solved. Why does the applicant pool continually show this sixty-forty ratio? Over the last four years, Davidson has had 7,519 students apply for admission. Of these, 4,381 (57%) were men. Last year’s numbers showed an even more vivid example. A total of 2,014 students applied for admission, 1,203 (59.7%) of which were men. Hendrix believes there are a few reasons for this continued trend. As was stated, coeducation at Davidson is a relatively new game, and this could present some problems in attracting female applicants who might not know as much about the school. Another more serious possibility is present, however. Shaw pointed out that the admissions staff always makes sure that they are as honest as possible with prospective applicants, which might unfortunately create worry in some of the female prospects. “This is very possibly a circular process,” said Shaw. “The average female might come in, find out about the ratio of male to female students, start to think that it will be too hard for her to make it, and select herself out of the application process without giving it a chance.” Hendrix admits, “We might have a slight ‘Catch 22’ situation in that aspect.”

The Board of Trustees is scheduled to meet at the end of this month (they meet three times yearly). At this time, it is unlikely that the issue will be located on the agenda. The final solution, though, could very well lie within the school itself. As Hendrix summed up, “One of the main problems we are having is that we (the admissions staff) are puzzled by this applicant rate of sixty-forty. I hope that we can do a better job of recruiting in the future and develop Davidson’s applicant pool further in terms of quality and contrast.” If Hendrix’s wish comes true, Davidson could very possibly be ready for another change.

Classrooms may soon be locked. “There has been a policy in place that all rooms are locked at night except during exams because at that time, everyone is studying in the library,” Ross said. “I have tried to be flexible about leaving rooms open under the assumption that students will help out by making sure that the rooms are left in the condition they were in before they started studying there.” Ross said a number of factors influenced the decision to enforce the policy now. A number of faculty members have complained about the disarray of desks and writing on the boards when they have entered their classrooms in the morning, according to Ross. Ross also said windows have been left open and lights left on which creates unnecessary expense in heating and electric bills for the building. Several rooms in Chambers, additionally, have equipment such as maps which need to be in locked rooms during the evenings, according to Ross. Faculty have also complained about the noise in the hallways of the Chambers building during the evenings when they are in their offices working, and Ross said she is also concerned about the safety of those who are studying in Chambers.

Ross said in the past the problem was not so significant because the college employed a night watchman (not associated with the Davidson police) who regularly walked through Chambers to prevent such problems from occurring. That position has since been eliminated, and the college now relies on campus police officers for the safety and maintenance of the building. “With a smaller number of rooms open, we can simply ask the police to make it part of their schedule to walk through the building at midnight and lock the doors and to work that into their rounds, but they can’t be walking through this building all the time,” Ross said. Ross said that the policy is currently under negotiation, but she emphasizes that without students agreeing to take better care of rooms, students will not be able to study in Chambers at night. She says she does want to hear from students who are concerned and that students are her first concern. The final policy decision will be announced in the next issue of the Dean’s Outbasket.

“Davidson is a community. The buildings are here to be used, but there have to be guidelines because there are times when students have not been entirely responsible. I feel that the faculty complaints are legitimate, and I have adjusted the policy in light of the student body and what I consider to be the fair response. Right now, it’s not assured that Chambers will be open for studying during exams. That’s not a God-given right.”

SGA president Conrad Doenges expressed the concern that alternative places to study are not available to students late at night. “The 24-hour study room is occupied for people who study there. Continued page 5
