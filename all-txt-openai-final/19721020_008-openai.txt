At Kodak, it’s not unusual for a 25-year-old like Jim Carroll to win the title of senior research physicist. Like
any company involved in a lot of basic research, Kodak has felt the pressure of modern technology and the need
for young, fresh thinking. So we hire the best talent we possibly can, and then give them as much responsibility
as they can handle. Whatever their age.

We have departments and divisions, like any company. What we don’t have are preconceived ideas about how an expert scientist’s
time should be spent. So when we received a request from the medical community for assistance in experimenting with lasers
as a possible cancer treatment, we turned to 25-year-old Jim Carroll, who is deep in laser technology, and gave him
the go-ahead. He built two half-billion watt laser systems, one of which Kodak has donated to the National Institute of
Health.

The lasers proved unsuccessful in treating cancer, but we'd make the same decision all over again. We entered laser technology
because we have a stake in business. We let a young researcher help the medical community look for a means
of cancer treatment because we have a stake in the future of mankind.

To put it another way, we're in business to make a profit. But in furthering our own needs, we have
often furthered society's. After all, our business depends on our society. So we care what happens to it.

Kodak

More than a business.
