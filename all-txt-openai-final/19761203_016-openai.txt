**14 Riflers hit upon money plan**

In attempts to raise funds for the purchase of badly needed equipment, the Davidson College Rifle Team has toyed with
several schemes. The latest of these, and the one which seems to hold the most promise for success, is the
proposal to hire out team members as "Hit Men," or more correctly, now that the team has gone coed, "Hit
Persons."

First suggested last spring, the idea met enthusiastic response from the varsity shooters. Coach Capt. Jerry Flannigan feels that the
proposal will be beneficial to the team for two reasons. "Not only will this be an important source of income,
but it will allow opportunity for my shooters to get in some valuable practice during hours when the range may
not be open," he said.

Discussions with College President Dr. Samuel R. Spencer Jr. added weight to the team’s decision. In a recent interview, Dr.
Spencer praised the rifle team for their ingenuity and commented, "Having our very own Hit Men here at Davidson will
be a great step forward for this institution. This will help to give Davidson some badly needed publicity, and put
us back on the map."

Athletic Director Thom Cartmill feels that this move will cause a major shift of emphasis in Davidson athletics. "I see
the rifle team moving up; I see them moving to fill the void left by the poor performance of our
football and basketball teams in recent years."

For the past three weeks, team members Katherine Whitney and Rob Mitchell have been conducting a preliminary feasibility study of
the Davidson campus. "Things should work out just fine. From the bell tower of DCPC, the top of the dome,
the library roof, and assorted Belk windows, we can just about cover the entire campus. I’m looking forward to a
great season," said team captain Tom Miller, basing his comments on the study.

When word of the team’s intentions leaked out recently, the response was encouraging. Already 16 freshmen have made inquiries. Faculty
feelings were mixed on the issue, however. A letter expressing great concern was received Wednesday, signed by the seven members
of the first-year Humanities staff.

On the other hand, Professor Rogerson of the Spanish department seemed rather elated over the whole thing, as he hurried
down to the rifle range to discuss the possibility of group rates for a contract on his entire two sections
of Spanish I students.

"As a member of Davidson’s rifle team, I feel that this experience will be a rewarding one for (most) of
those concerned. I feel that it will help to increase team spirit as it creates an air of competition among
those shooters vying for contracts," said team member Tom Niblock.

"The added income will be especially useful. Having only seven weapons severely limits the team’s ability to perform at their
optimum," he continued. "The money we earn through our hard work will be used to purchase new weapons and scopes.
This will enable us to expand our operations and bring more freshmen into the program," said Flannigan.

This is the dawn of a new era in Davidson's history. You can be part of that history: support the
rifle team. You can’t afford not to!

**Football improves training supplies in expansion drive**

Something-at-large

Athletic Director Thomas Cartmill announced today the football team’s acquisition of a number of items from the rest of the
athletic department.“Tom (Couch) and I figured that the only way we were going to get a winning football team here
would be to get the combined effort of the entire athletic department behind the grid program,” said Cartmill. “Since most
of them didn’t want to comply, we just used a little persuasion and confiscated all this stuff.”

Taken first were the budgets for all other sports—intercollegiate, club, and IMAC. “We left ’em a little bit,” said Cartmill,
“but we got all the real loot for our kitty. In a few years if we start to win big
we'll let ’em have a few funds, but right now they can get by with playing all home games, playing
in street clothes, whatever. We may loan ’em a few jocks.”

When this reporter found Assistant Director Tom Couch, he was towing the soccer goals behind his new air-conditioned golf cart.
“These durn goals, they make the best towel baskets you ever did see,” he noted. “And this field, why, we’re
going to use this one for left-handed pulling guards with even-numbered jerseys to train on, if I remember correctly.”

When asked about his new golf cart, Couch quipped, “Ain’t she a beaut? It’ll do 35 without even trying, and
it’ll pull like a mine mule. Of course, we had to sell the track team into slavery to buy it,
but believe me it’s worth every cent.”

Other acquisitions are numerous. The track locker room will be used to store the football team’s socks. “Some A-rab sold
us a whole truckload of slightly irregular socks,” said Couch, “and we are going to need a whole lot of
space for them. You know how important they are to a winning program.”

Also taken was the Universal weight machine, which will be placed behind the East stands and used for hanging out
wet uniforms to dry. When asked if the machine will be accessible for use, Cartmill said, “Heck no! How can
those clothes get dry with a bunch of people pushing and pulling on that machine?”

Couch noted that the swimming pool was one of the first items to go. “We got a special deal on
an outboard motor from the Evinrude place, so we're going to bolt it down at the deep end of the
pool and make the state’s biggest whirlpool out of it. We hear that Williams College has one almost as large,
but what the heck,” he chortled.

During the interview, this reporter noticed a large number of footballs, each with “IMAC” written on it in large print,
in the corner of Cartmill’s office. He said this concerning the balls: “Oh, yeah! Well, we figured if we could
get our players more accustomed to handling the ball then we’d have a lot fewer fumbles, so we took all
of these from Jeff and are going to give all our backs and ends one each to sleep with. We
hope there’ll be no emotional involvement,” he added.

When asked about the large number of workmen applying their trades in the gym, Cartmill said, “We’re going to turn
that outdated, drafty gym into the finest facility for entertaining recruits in all of college football. We’re going to have
three floors of plush suites, a movie theater, a bar, and who knows what else. It’ll be fully staffed, air-conditioned,
just like your best New York hotels. No way we can lose in recruiting with that baby.”

Plans for buying a Lear jet for recruiting have not been finalized.
