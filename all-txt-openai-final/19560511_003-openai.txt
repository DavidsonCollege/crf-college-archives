FRIDAY, MAY 11, 1956 THE DAVIDSONIAN PAGE THREE

LOOKING BACK

Mr. H. B. Arbuckle in his speech at the Athletic Banquet mentioned that this sports season had been “one of the most successful in recent years” for Davidson. Since no conference championships were won, what has made it so? Records are the best testimony. In addition to the track records in the 880, mile, shot put, and mile relay, the swimming team broke seven of their 10 records this year. They were the 50-yard freestyle, Tom Rivers :24.1; 100-yard freestyle, Tom Rivers, :54.8; 200-yard individual medley, Bill Carrell, 2:30.3; 200-yard breaststroke, John Edwards 2:40.9; 400-yard relay Speir, Winfrey, Carrell, and Rivers, 3:49.4; 200-yard freestyle, Jerry Clark, 2:26.2; and diving, Basil Sharp 65 points.

In basketball, Hobby Cobb set new marks in field goals, 200; free throws, 140; season points, 540; career points, 1470; and career average 16.7. The team set a new single-game high of 108 points against Guilford and a season total of 1816. In football, the Wildcats led the conference in total defense but looked most impressive in averaging 150.1 yards per game in passing to break a conference record set by Maryland with Jack Scarbath in 1950.

The gift of $153 presented by Dave Regen of the “D” club to Coach Whittle at the banquet was sufficient to complete the fund started several years ago to pay for a curb for the track to make it official and eligible for conference meets.

ON LEAVING

The sports staff of the Davidsonian would like to pay tribute to the man who has made the phrase “a little extra effort” live for many Davidson athletes. Coach Carroll Hambright helped make the Cat forward wall one of the most feared on the gridiron in this area and his swimmers rewrote the record books, but as the time approaches when he will leave after a four-year stay, most of his friends will look back and realize that Carroll will be remembered primarily for his hearty smile and laugh that cheered everyone around him.

Cindermen Enter

The Wildcat track squad finished up its regular dual meet season last Saturday with a 69-62 victory over N. C. State at Raleigh, and is this weekend involved in what is expected to be the closest fight ever witnessed for the Southern Conference crown. Fifteen men will represent Davidson at Blacksburg. Davidson, Richmond, William, and Mary, and the hosts VPI are expected to be the chief contestants for the team title. Outstanding candidates for individual championships for Davidson are Pete Ashcraft in the mile and half-mile run, Bill Gramley in the shot and discus, Phil Koonce in the sprints, and the best relay team in the history of this school—Ashcraft, Diuguid, Mallory, and Elder. All of these men will, however, get plenty of competition. Ashcraft will be opposed by DeTombe of W&M, Chukinas of Richmond, and Wingfield of VPI, Koonce’s main trouble will come from W&M’s Fillman, and there are several relay teams capable of 3:25.

The chances for a team victory have been somewhat reduced since neither of the javelin hopefuls, Martin and Smith, will take the trip. Highlight of the Raleigh meet was Pete Ashcraft's new mile run record of 4:20.5, an improvement of his own mark by 0.4 seconds. Pete got his first defeat of the year in the 880, but ran another good race in the mile relay which was to decide the final outcome of the meet. Other good performances were made by Gramley in the weight events, Koonce got another triple victory, Al Elder continued with another 440 win, Dave Regen surprisingly won the high hurdles, and pole vaulter John Holshouser made 10’6” for the first time in competition.

The season has seen four new school records; the won-lost record for the year is 7-2, and Coach Whittle now has only two to go before joining the exclusive “100” in track coaching.

Nine Get Awards

250 students, coaches, and guests attended the annual Sports Dinner to honor outstanding performers in all sports. Nine special awards and 126 letters were presented during the two-hour ceremonies. Dyke Little, Wildcat quarterback and first baseman, received the newly announced $1,115 McConnell Scholarship, gift of Mr. Joe McConnell, a graduate of Davidson who is now chief counsel for Reynolds Metal. Football coach Bill Dole awarded to Donny McCree the Stowe Memorial Scholarship and to Ken Conger the Armfield Scholarship. Semi Mintz was selected as being the freshman showing the most versatility and leadership in athletics. Mintz, a 6’ 2” Raleigh boy, was a star performer on the basketball team and played number one on the tennis squad.

As a token of appreciation, departing Coach Hambright was given a desk set and red blanket with a black Davidson monogram by the members of his '55—'56 football, swimming, and track teams.

WILDCAT BASEBALL

A bare-handed first baseman, a Beechnut Tobacco spitter on second, a Charlottean shortstop, and a dirty-uniformed “Pong” on third base, were firing a baseball at each other. Strange though they may seem, these figures appear foremost around the clay of the Davidson diamond. Shortstop Billy Morris (the Charlottean) and second baseman Buzzy Hope (the spitter) are playing their last year for Davidson. Between them, they have the leading batting averages for 1955 and 1956, Hope leading the Wangs last year and Morris this. Buzzy attained the position of second team all-conference last season. In addition to chewing almost a whole package of Beechnut a game, Hope also does some relief pitching which is sparked by a fine knuckleball. A regular for four years, he is alternate captain of the ‘56 squad. His glove work and hard hitting make him all-conference material.

Billy is the fastest man on the team, a brilliant base-runner, a good bunter, and possessor of a good pair of fielding hands. This year the team voted him the most valuable player. Surely Buddy Lewis, his uncle, who plays for the Washington Senators, is proud of such a nephew.

Dyke Little, usually a hatless, muscle-bulging tee-shirter, is the Wildcat first baseman. In his first year, he was fresh and was bestowed the outstanding man-athlete award by the D Club. The freshman baseball squad has the strongest infield.He is the winning dark “horse” candidate filling the heretofore unsettled third base position. Coach Clemen points to the fact that if the old axiom “a dirty uniform makes a good ball player,” then Don should soon have a contract with the Yanks. In addition to being a powerful hitter, Comer is developing into one of the team’s best base runners. Don’s arm is true, a con- siderable addition to the team. 

Bill Gramley and McCree were also recognized for having been picked to the all Southern Conference academic team, an honor which is rewarded by twenty volumes of the American People’s Encyclopedia. Phil Koonce, for the third consecutive year, was the recipient of the Merchant Award for high point track.

126 WEST FIFTH STREET “Opposite Ivey's St. Entrance” CHARLOTTE

COACH HEATH WHITTLE, director of interfraternity sports, holds the athletic trophy which Kappa Sigs won today.

Final Standings:
- Kappa Sig: 1201
- Phi Delt: 1190
- Sigma Chi: 1080
- KA: 881
- SAE: 860
- Phi Gam: 828
- Beta: 795
- ATO: 732
- SPE: 618
- Pika: 567
- Independents: 500
- Pi Kappa Phi: 478

In a contest that was not decided until the final day of competition, the Kappa Sigs staved off a final surge of their closest rivals, the Phi Delts, to win by the narrow margin of eleven points the coveted interfraternity sports trophy. The Phi Delts were aided on the final day as a result of capturing the tennis tournament. In the finals in tennis, Steve Norton beat Ned Austell for the singles championship, and Norton and Harold Hoffman downed Tom Lee and Billy Hopper for the doubles. The team victory went to the SAE’s who not only won both events but placed representatives in the semifinals of each.

The extremely narrow margin of only 11 points in a total of a thousand was almost a duplicate of last year's results when the boys in green and yellow won by 14. The third running Sigma Chis amassed 1080 points to also finish over the one thousand mark. The Sigs placed 121 points behind the winners but 100 points ahead of the fourth place team. The scoring in varsity competition was Kappa Sigs 160, Phi Delts 132, and KAs 97. The Kappa Sigs won first place in swimming, wrestling, and track.

MORRIS TOP BATTER OF YEAR

Following last Tuesday's loss to Furman in the season finale, Wildcat statisticians released the following records for the squad’s performance for the season. Captain Billy Morris led the team in batting with a .443 mark in 19 games (only collegiate games are recorded). Mack Dagenhart was the only pitcher to pitch more than 25 innings. In the game Tuesday, the Purple Hurricane scored two runs in the third and seventh innings to give the Cats their ninth one-point loss of the season. Wallace, Comer, and Morris tallied once apiece for the losers. Moore of Furman was the winning pitcher.
