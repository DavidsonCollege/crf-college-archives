**Bow Wow Wow**

**The Last of the Mohicans**

Let’s face it. The first thing you notice about this record is the cover—an artful recreation of Edouard Manet’s “Dejeuner sur l’Herbe,” featuring the undraped Annabella and the other members of the band in poses from the painting. This cover is indicative of the humor to be found in the EP, the new four-song release from this Blitz dance band. While the record breaks little new ground from their debut LP, it is a solid release which suffers mainly from its brevity.

The EP opens with the most immediately appealing of its songs, which not coincidentally is the single release—this is the cover of the classic pop song from the Strangeloves entitled “I Want Candy.” This song is roughly a cross between Bo Diddley, a jungle chant, and a football cheer. As performed by Bow Wow Wow, it features a screaming guitar underpinned by an awesome bass and drum breakdown. Annabella’s voice is perfect for this light pop ditty; she is the idealized nymphet proclaiming her love for her boyfriend and demanding “I want candy!” This release might just give them the widespread exposure they now lack.

The other songs from the record are sexual sagas possessing a darker innocence: One song, “Louis Quatorze,” opens with the wonderful line “I love it when he says so seriously / With his gun in my back ‘Honey, / Close your eyes and think of England.’” The other songs (“Cowboy” and “Mile High Club”) are fiercely rhythmic tales of sophisticated teenage lust. To separate their tone from “I Want Candy,” these three tunes are somewhat murkier, with Annabella’s rapidly maturing voice floating over a wave of guitar and drum. The record’s production is superior to their debut album in the spaciousness of the sound and the self-assured playing which was at times lacking from their earlier release.

Overall, The Last of the Mohicans is a respectable addition to the music previously released by this extremely young band. The major fault is that with only two songs on each side, you have to get up and turn the record over every six or seven minutes. That shouldn’t be too much of a problem, though, since you'll probably be standing up dancing anyway.

Zaid further suggests that the conflict is not between the masses and the elites, but rather among elites who can’t agree on how to treat the masses. Responsible for the crisis are those leaders who can’t agree on how and who should rule, but agree on using violence to force consensus. Zaid argues that violence, however, cannot create consensus, nor legitimacy, but only polarization and political vacuum in the long run. Violence from two sides creates popular abstention—to side with anyone in a civil war can cause you to lose your life when the next bunch comes through. In a civil war, it is the political idealists who suffer the most.

Debunking these myths is hardly possible, though Beck charges the “and other groups” with idealism. Actually, the Coalition supports what I see as a more and more realistic political solution that takes into account the power structure and power struggle of Salvadoran society, which those with ideological blinders seem unable to perceive. Specifically, the Coalition supports: 1) a U.S. policy of no military intervention and cessation of unconditional military aid; 2) negotiations to reduce arms flow from other sources; 3) negotiations between political factions in El Salvador; and 4) fundamental and lasting changes in the structure of Salvadoran society. However, while the Coalition supports negotiations as an avenue towards a political solution and moving away from violence, and building consensus to work for reform, without reform, the poverty of peasants will be like a tank of gas to which an ambitious leader need only hold a match.

If you recall, the “realistic solution” offered by the Reagan Administration and first proposed in State Department spokesman Thomas Enders’ speech of July 16, 1981, was the elections (U.S. Dept. of State, “El Salvador: Democracy or Dictatorship,” Current Policy No. 337).
