This weekend Davidson played two hard-fought matches in the Nike Invitational at Charlotte’s Transamerica Field. The ’Cats opened up tournament
play with a game against UAB and, despite trailing twice, held on to a 2-2 tie after 110 minutes of
soccer. In the next round of the tournament on Sunday, the Wildcats battled Winthrop in a closely contested match but
fell by a score of 1-0.

Davidson’s offensive attack was aggressive early in Friday’s game and tested the Blazer defense often. In the 30th minute, Yannick
Pilgrim ’11 barely missed on a header when it bounced directly down after hitting the crossbar. Despite the ’Cats' early
offensive pressure, it was UAB who struck first in the 13th minute to take a 1-0 lead. Finally, the ’Cats
were able to capitalize on a scoring opportunity in the 30th minute when Alex Caskey ’11 juked the UAB defense
and slipped the ball into the lower left corner of the net, past a diving UAB goalie for his second
goal of the season.

The teams entered the half tied 1-1, and the game would go back and forth in a scoreless and purely
defensive fashion until the final six minutes. At this juncture, UAB’s Michal Mravec scored to put the Blazers on top
2-1 with only five minutes remaining in regulation. The pressure was on for Davidson, and Yannick Pilgrim ’11 answered the
call. Just two minutes later, Pilgrim collected a pass from Whitey Bolan ’09 and fired a shot into the lower
right corner of the goal to tie the game at 2-2 with just minutes left until overtime. For the last
few minutes, both teams sought a game-winner, but neither could find the net, and the game headed to overtime.

In the overtime period, goalkeeper Matt McElroy ’11 played spectacularly after replacing Robby Goldsberry ’10 in the first half. He
registered two important saves that kept the game at a tie after two overtime periods as the ’Cats registered a
point.

To close out the tournament, Davidson played Winthrop on Sunday. After the first half, Davidson led in 7-6 shots and
7-3 in corner kicks. The game remained scoreless until well into the second half when Winthrop scored in the 62nd
minute off a deflected shot. Towards the end, Davidson had a chance to tie when Caskey faced off one-on-one with
the Winthrop goalie. Unfortunately, Winthrop’s goalkeeper came up with a clutch save that preserved the win for the Eagles. Caskey
led the team with five shots on goal, but the Wildcats were unable to find the net in yet another
heart-breaking loss. Caskey and Pilgrim earned All-Tournament honors for their performances in the tournament.

“In the UAB game, we came from behind twice in one game showing great resilience,” said Coach Matt Spear. “In
the Winthrop game, they made a big play, and we did not.”

Davidson will look to get back on the winning track as it travels to South Carolina on Saturday for their
final non-conference match.

Davidson golfer Michael Saari ’09 shot a final round 71 to lift himself to a fourth-place finish in the season-opening
Raines Development Group Intercollegiate, held at the Country Club of South Carolina. His performance helped the ’Cats to an eighth-place
finish overall out of the 18 teams which competed in the tournament. Saari shot a three-round total of 211, five-under-par,
on his way to his first top-five performance of his career. The team posted a cumulative total of 877, which
averaged out to 13-over-par and their best finish in two years.

The ’Cats' solid finish could also be attributed to the performance of newcomer Jackson Taylor ’12. He recorded the second-lowest
three-day total on the team with a 220. This figure earned him a tie for 39th place in the first
collegiate tournament of his career. Right behind Taylor was consistent performer Bobby Urso ’11, who posted a tournament stroke total
of 221 and tied for 41st place overall. Adam Lewicki ’11 and Christopher Rollins ’11 helped to solidify Davidson’s spot
in the top half of the tournament field with efforts of 228 and 234 strokes, respectively.

The buzz of the tournament surrounded the Georgia Southern Eagles, who shot a collective total of 22 under par, 842.
This magnificent effort broke the previous record of 849 established in 2005 by USC Aiken. Catching the spotlight as well,
William and Mary’s Brent Paladino earned medalist honors, firing a three-round total of 202 (14-under-par), which demolished the previous tournament
mark of 207 set in 2002.

Off to a promising start, the Davidson golf team looks to build on this performance in their upcoming tournaments.The Davidson
golf team hopes to continue their improved play in the 2008 season. The ’Cats will return to the course for
the Mizuno Savannah Intercollegiate hosted by Georgia Southern in Savannah, Ga. on Oct. 5.

QBs make difference in college football
Curtis YOUNG

There’s an old adage that’s constantly repeated these days in college football circles: defense wins championships. While championships are not
won without a solid defense, perhaps we need to rethink the way we look at how games are won in
college football. It has become popular in recent years to deemphasize the quarterback position. We saw game-manager Craig Krenzel win
a National Championship with Ohio State in 2002. Matt Flynn, not exactly a household name, won the title with LSU
last season. Ohio State and LSU won with great defenses and a bit of luck.

The common denominator for most championship-caliber teams over the last 15 years, though? That would be great quarterback play. We
watched Florida State dominate the ’90s with Charlie Ward, Danny Kanell, Thad Busby, and Chris Weinke. Miami rejuvenated its program
with Ken Dorsey and Brock Berlin. Oklahoma’s resurgence? That can be credited to Josh Heupel and Jason White. USC? Carson
Palmer, Matt Leinart, John David Booty. Those are the obvious examples. But let’s examine a different angle for a moment.

Looking at this season’s rankings, we see some odd names near the top. Missouri, for one, has been a constant
disappointment in the Big 12 (previously the Big 8). Well, led by last year’s Heisman runner-up Chase Daniel, the Tigers
have pushed their way into the nation’s elite. Those perennial powers Miami and Florida State? They have hardly been able
to post winning seasons for the past few years. In fact, Miami is coming off a 5-7 campaign that hardly
hearkened back to the program’s glory days.

Has the quarterback position become more important over recent seasons? I would argue yes. The spread offense has evolved to
the point where passers routinely complete over 65 percent of their throws. Offenses are running more plays, scoring points in
record numbers, and putting incredible pressure on quarterbacks to win games, as opposed to simply managing them. The playing field
has, to an extent, been leveled. Quick players with great hands have become much more important in this era of
spread offenses. Luckily for teams like Missouri, Kansas, and Wake Forest, there are many more of those types than the
enormous, freakish athletes prowling the field in cities like Los Angeles (USC) and Baton Rouge (LSU).

Granted, most National Championships will still be won by the traditional powers, even in an era of considerably more parity.
Power programs still possess more resources and will get the best athletes. All other things being equal, the better athletes
will win most of the time. The increased focus on the quarterback in the spread offense, though, has made what
was once unthinkable imminently possible. Would it really be that much of a surprise if Missouri won the title this
season? How about South Florida? Hey, it could happen. Both have experienced, talented (albeit short) quarterbacks to march them up
and down the field. The spread quarterback is the great equalizer. Speed rules, and the power offenses of the past
are now the exception.

I would never sit here and write that the basics of old-school football no longer hold true. Teams still must
be able to move the ball in short chunks of yardage and must be able to keep other teams from
doing so. Turning and handing off to a tailback being led by a fullback, though? That’s nearly obsolete. We’ve seen
Appalachian State win at Michigan’s Big House behind diminutive—but lightning-fast—quarterback Armanti Edwards. We’ve seen Wake Forest win a combined 20
games over the last two seasons. We’ve even seen Kansas rise to prominence behind 5’11 QB Todd Reesing. Ten years
ago, this simply would not have been possible. Underdogs could pull upsets, but could not sustain excellence for an entire
season (BYU’s 1984 National Championship notwithstanding). Football’s popularity has led to an increased talent pool that spreads good players across
the country, but the evolution of the spread is the greatest reason for all of the upsets. Previously, one player
could only do so much. In today’s college game, one player at the quarterback position can make all the difference
in the world.

If you are curious and adventurous, then pack your bags and say goodbye to the status quo. Study abroad to
earn college credit, experience a different culture, learn a foreign language, discover who you are, and much more. USAC, your
gateway to the world.
