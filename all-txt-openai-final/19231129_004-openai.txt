THE WILDCAT GRID RECORD

Athletic records at Davidson have been kept with little care in the past, so the record which follows has many breaks. It seems to have been the custom after an unsuccessful or mediocre season, to omit the scores and merely state whether the games were won or lost, and in some cases the victories and defeats are unavailable. Because of this fact and the failure to keep a record, some of the scores in the years 1923, 1905, 1912, and 1913 are missing. Any information which alumni...can give in regard to the missing games, and any corrections in the scores as tabulated, will be greatly appreciated. Please address all communications to C. M. S. Mcllwaine, Box 263, Davidson, N. C.

COACHING TRIO
(Continued from page 1)

graduate of the University of Georgia, has made it hard for any team to defeat the Fresh eleven, and he has made it possible for the eleven to win for Davidson. Coach Rawson is not only an athlete himself, but he is a producer. He was a letter man at Georgia in baseball and basketball for four years, was picked on the All Southern in basketball for four years and in baseball for two years. During the war he played on the Camp Hancock football team, playing the backfield along with Howard Berry, the All-American half-back. He coached G. M. C., Riverside Military Academy, and Thomasville, (Ga.) High School, in football, basketball, and baseball, during the past five years. The Fresh have made a record this year and it is due to the hard work that Rawson has put out and the interest he has shown in Davidson. The Wildcats will have a chance to use the home gridiron, Richardson Field, next season. Three or four games at home, with a couple more in Charlotte will give the students a chance to support the team to the limit.

UNDERWOOD, Halfback, Carolina

Underwood has proven himself a capable back this year. He has been used in the majority of games and his work has come up to expectations. In him, the Fetzers have developed another capable back.
