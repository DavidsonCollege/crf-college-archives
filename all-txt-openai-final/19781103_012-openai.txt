DAVE BRUBECK and his three sons will jazz up Love Auditorium on Friday night. Get your tickets now!

music, music, music...

Although last week provided the campus with lots of good music via the Opera and Meisburg and Walters (not to
mention the Dynamic Upsetters) this week might even top that.

The headliner act of the week is, of course, Dave Brubeck. He and his three sons, composing the New Brubeck
Quartet, will present a concert on Friday, November 3 at 8 pm in Love Auditorium. Tickets are $4.00. They have
performed internationally and have two top-selling jazz albums currently on the charts. It’s definitely a “don’t miss” show!

Next is Davidson’s own Wind Ensemble, giving its first indoor concert on campus in several years. Directed by William Lawing
and featuring solo pianist Cynthia Lawing. The concert will be held at 8:15 pm, November 6 in Love Auditorium.

And finally on November 10-11, Davidson hosts the 19th Annual Sacred Music Convocation. Featuring nationally known organists Martha Folts and
Arthur Lawrence, the convocation gathers church musicians, educators, clergy and laity for discussion of old and new religious music, and
for performances by leading artists. This year’s concert is a recital on Friday, November 10, by Ms. Folts in the
College Church. Students interested in attending the entire convocation, including meals, lectures and workshops should contact the music department.

area talent is showcased

Remember Top Hats and Cat Tales? Well, some of the top performers in that show along with other talented Davidson
students will get their chance to break into the “big-time” (well, almost) on Saturday. Sam Sommers and Liza White, Windfall,
Harry Pickens and his Trio and performers of comparable caliber from other area schools will be performing in the Charlotte
Consortium Showcase to be held in the 900 Room.

Performers from UNCC, Belmont Abbey, Barber-Scotia, Queens, Winthrop, Wingate and Sacred Heart colleges will be featured, and committees from each
school similar to our Intimate Performers committee will attend for the purpose of checking out the “local talent” and possibly
booking some of the acts for their schools.

The Showcase was started last year and has two primary objectives: to give students opportunities to perform and to provide
area schools with a source of low-cost programming. As a result of last year’s Showcase, Davidson booked two or three
acts for the 900 Room, and several Davidson acts received bids to perform elsewhere. William Brown, assistant Union director, predicts
that this year’s Showcase will be even more successful, as it is being held earlier in the year when most
of the booking had already been done last year. Performers will include WCBW (a great bluegrass band which performed last
year), jazz and blues singers, pianists, and a classical guitarist.

SAM SOMMERS and Liza White, of Top Hats and Cat Tales fame, will join the showcase. Tickets are $2.00. The
event runs from 7-10 pm (although there will undoubtedly be some “after-hours” jamming as there was last year). If you’ve
got some free time on Saturday, come check it out.
