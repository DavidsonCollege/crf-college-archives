Sideline Comments By STEVE CLARK

TOURNAMENT TALK

The victories over William & Mary and Richmond last weekend virtually clinched a berth for Davidson in this year’s Southern
Conference tournament, which is slated for March 1-3. However, a win over VMI tomorrow night would mathematically clinch a berth
in the tourney. If the Wildcats down the Keydets, they would have a 5-3 record, with three conference games remaining.
So the worst record with which they could finish would be 5-6. Meanwhile, The Citadel is currently 1-7 in league
play, with four remaining games. The best the Bulldogs can finish is 5-7. But the Bulldogs, which were picked to
finish third in pre-season standings, are not entirely out of the picture. They may easily pass William & Mary (3-9
with four more games) before the season ends.

However, getting into the tournament, which has been the biggest problem for recent Wildcat fives, is not a problem or
the worry of this year’s contingent. The ’Cats are a shoo-in this year, and the big struggle is to try
to finish third in the standings, in order that powerful West Virginia would not be met until the final game.
This will be the first year since 1958-59 that a Davidson team has been in the tournament. That year the
Wildcats, which finished 8th in regular season play ahead of VMI, met the nationally ranked Mounties in the opening round
and were thoroughly trounced.

Incidentally, the ’Cats got a look at the site of this year’s tourney when they beat Richmond this past Monday
night in the Richmond Arena. Many people feel that the Arena, which seats 5,000 people, is not the place for
the tourney. VPI would, quite naturally, like to bring it to their new field house, which seats 10,000, and in
which the Gobblers have yet to be defeated. However, Blacksburg lacks adequate hotel and eating facilities to accommodate players, coaches,
press, and fans. Lefty Driesell offers the best solution to the problem—the Charlotte Coliseum. The Queen City, which is centrally
located, has excellent overnight and eating facilities, and the Coliseum would be a neutral court.

Least concerned with the whole matter is Coach Lefty Driesell and his miracle men, who keep taking them one at
a time. Says Driesell, “We're not concerned right now with how long this streak will last. We're only concerned with
how we're going to beat VMI.”

REVENGE GAME

The Wildcats will be after more than another win tomorrow night when the Keydets stroll out onto the floor in
Johnston Gym. The home cagers are seeking revenge for the first time this year. The boys from Lexington, Va., stomped
the ‘Cats up there earlier in the season, 84-60. Big gun for the Keydets in that game was Captain Norm
Halberstadt, and it will be interesting to see if the much improved Davidson defense can put the clamps on the
chunky, 6-foot senior from Brooklyn.

A NICKEL WILL DO IT

If you find an extra nickel in your pocket tonight, how about picking up a copy of today’s Charlotte News.
Max Muhleman of the News and a photographer graced our campus Wednesday in search of the effect of the winning
streak on our school. Muhleman has written a big feature on his visit, and the article is in today’s edition.

And speaking of sports writers, we accept George Cunningham's apology in Wednesday morning’s Observer. Cunningham was careful to point out
that the WILDCATS (instead of Tamecats) have the nation’s fourth longest winning streak, “exceeded only by Ohio State (17 straight)
and Kentucky and Oregon State (15 each).” Just keep giving us that front page coverage, Mr. Cunningham, no matter what
you call us.

Kappa Sig Hoopsters Grab I-F Cage Lead

The Kappa Sigs took a commanding lead in the I-F basketball race this week as they swept three straight games—two
of them from such major challengers as the ATO’s and Phi Gams. Going into tonight’s action the Sigs are out
front with a 5-0 record, and the Sigma Chis find themselves in second place by virtue of a 3-1 mark.

This week's I-F checklist includes the following: On Monday, Bob Bost pumped in 14 points as the Pikas sped by
the Sig Eps, 45-26. Paul Duvall hit 18 points and directed the ATO’s over the SAE’s, 51-41. Freshman David Johnson
scored 23 points as the Independents knocked off the Phi Gams, 52-41, despite Larry Leafer’s 16 points. Durwood Settles hit
12 as the Kappa Sigs bumped the Sigma Nus, 48-33.

Wrestlers Whip Emory and Georgia

The Davidson matmen returned from their tour of Georgia with victories over Emory and the University of Georgia. Last Friday
the team beat Emory, 31-5, by virtue of five pins by Tom Wright (123), Dick Wray (130), Linton Wray (137),
Billy Mills (167), and Jim Alexander (177), and two decisions by Butch LeDoyen (157) and Tom Day (unlimited). On Saturday
in Athens the ‘Cats tripped Georgia, 19-10, as Wright, D. Wray, Mills, and Day gained decisions, while Alexander again pinned
his opponent. Coach Charlie Parker's men now have a 5-3 record, with excellent chances for victory in Blacksburg, Va., home
of last year’s champions, VPI.

On Tuesday, the Betas defeated the Pi Kapps, 46-31, behind Tommy Hamilton's 11 points. Harry Cline’s 14 points led the
Sigma Chis by the Sig Eps, 62-43. Lee Coward hit a 25-foot jump shot at the buzzer as the Kappa
Sigs came from behind to nip the ATO’s in overtime, 50-48. In the same game Kappa Sigs Jim Fuller and
Johnny Rogers had 16 and 14 points, respectively, while George Sledge paced the Taus with 21. J. D. Whitehead’s 14
markers led the Pikas in their upset over the Independents, 36-32. Yesterday afternoon, Jim Fuller and Johnny Rogers combined again
for 21 and 20 points, respectively, as the Kappa Sigs routed the Phi Gams, 68-47. The SAE’s downed the Sigma
Nus behind Ed Hines.

Catfish Get Dunked Despite New Record

BY CHARLIE SHAPARD
Davidsonian Sports WriterRiddled with flu, the 'Catfish met defeat in their last two outings as their record dropped to 2-3.
They lost to Georgia, 58-38, last Friday, and were clipped by The Citadel, 61-35, this past Monday. Against Georgia, the
400-yd. medley relay team of Tom French, Stefan Young, Jack Hollenbeck, and Barry Branch broke the school record by 4
seconds with a time of 4:11.3. Concerning The Citadel meet, Coach Dwight Shoe stated, “There were four events that could
have been easily won rather than lost. By winning these events we could have reversed that score in our favor.
However, we learned what we will have to do to do well in the conference meet.” The events the Davidson
mentor was referring to were the 50, 100, and 220-yd. freestyle events, and the 200-yd. breaststroke event. In the 50
and 100, Hollenbeck and Branch were just touched out by Cadet swimmers. In the 220, Carter Mebane was off the
winning time by 2.5 seconds. In the 200-yd. breaststroke, Young and Citadel’s conference champion Bill Dexter were both timed in
2:37.5, but the latter took the judge’s decision. This afternoon Georgia Tech invaded the Davidson pool, as the 'Cats hoped
to bounce back with a victory over the Engineer paddlers. On Tuesday, the 'Catfish travel to Duke for another non-conference
meet. Against The Citadel freshmen, the Wildkittens came out on the short end of a 44-22 score. The 'Kittens, led
by Jim Grey, John Alexander, and Steve Davidson, will also travel to Durham to take on the Baby Imps.

MEET YOUR FRIENDS AT THE W. INDEPENDENCE AT WILKINSON BLVD. CHARLOTTE WHILE ENJOYING THE BEST

VMI Visits 'Cat Cage
Cagers (12-6) Triumph In Virginia; Hit Clemson Here Monday Night

“How long will it last?” is the 64 thousand dollar question that Davidson basketball fans (and non-Davidson fans) keep asking
themselves with each and every Wildcat victory, and as tension mounts concerning tomorrow night’s 8:15 clash with VMI. N. Y.
Halberstadt, who maintains a 20-plus point scoring average, is considered the best outside shot in the Southern Conference. 6-7 sophomore
Bobby Watson, a deluxe rebounder, gives the Keydets the big man they have been lacking for so long, while seniors
Gene Lazaroff and Weldon Eddins provide added scoring punch to the VMI attack.

CRUCIAL WINS
The 'Cats continued their winning ways on a recent journey into Virginia. During this crucial road trip, they thumped William
& Mary, 61-54, and Richmond, 55-52. 6-7 sophomore Terry Holland paced the win over William & Mary by pouring in
20 points and nabbing 13 rebounds. Big Bill Jarman directed the Richmond victory with 19 points, including 9 for 11
free throws, and 12 rebounds. Bill Beerman, D. G. Martin, and Haywood Evans also sparked in the two wins. Beerman
scored 11 points against W&M, and held Richmond star John Telepo to 6 points. Martin was his usual scrappy self,
hauling down 9 and 8 rebounds in each game, and throwing in vital points both nights. Evans pumped in 10
against W&M, and two of his 11 against Richmond were last-second free throws, which clinched the game.

CLEMSON COMES
If the 'Cats get by VMI, the most serious threat to the streak comes to Johnston Gym on Monday night
in the form of Clemson. The Tigers, who recently lost to Wake Forest by a mere one point, own a
7-10 record, including wins over The Citadel, Richmond, George Washington, and William & Mary. This coming Thursday night, Davidson travels
to Greenville for a clash with Furman.

Game Schedule
This year's baseball team faces a rugged 28-game schedule that includes 4 doubleheaders. The schedule is as follows:

March: 17—Pfeiffer, HOME; 21—Catawba, away; 23—Catawba, HOME; 24—Yale, HOME; 29-30—Ga. Southern, away; 31—Jacksonville, away.
April: 2-3—Rollins, away; 4—Mercer, away; 7—VMI (2), HOME; 11—Concord College, HOME; 12—Richmond, HOME; 14—VPI (2), away; 18—Furman (2), HOME; 21—Geo.
Wash., HOME; 25—Mercer, HOME; 27—Belmont Abbey, HOME; and 30—The Citadel, away.
May: 1—The Citadel, away; 5—West Va., away; 7—William & Mary (2), away; 11-12—Ga. Southern, HOME.

Game time at home will be 3 p.m., except for doubleheaders and Saturday games, which begin at 1:30 p.m.

Strong Field Left Whittlemen Behind
“Under the circumstances, I think the boys did as well as could be expected,” said track coach Heath Whittle after
Davidson’s indoor runners failed to place in the VMI Relays held at Lexington, Virginia, last Saturday. Over 400 athletes were
entered from Navy, Duke, UNC, Maryland, William & Mary, East Tennessee, Mt. Saint Mary’s, The Citadel, VPI, VMI, and Davidson.
Whittle termed it “the fastest and best meet ever.” Four meet records were either broken or tied, with All-American football
end Greg Mather of Navy leading the way with a record-breaking 54’-1½” toss of the shotput. Davidson entered Bob Cordle
in the 60-yard dash, Andy Boggs in the shotput, and Ken Kelley, John Harris, John Sharp, and Dick Eberhart in
the 880-yd. and mile relays. Team scores were not kept, but the University of Maryland easily won the most first
places with five. Navy and UNC were second with two each.

DAVIDSON CAPTAIN D. G. MARTIN, this week's “Wildcat of the Week,” has developed into one of the conference’s best.

The Davidson freshmen completely overpowered the University of North Carolina frosh last night to the tune of 79-65 in Chapel
Hill. Thus the 'Kittens avenged an earlier 4-point loss to the Tar Babies. Big Fred Hetzel, the 6-8 Landon Prep
School product, did everything but dust the backboards as he poured in 24 points and pulled down 18 rebounds. Charlie
Marcon was deadly from the outside and equally as effective on some driving layups as he dropped in 18. Dave
Thomas and Phil Squier hit some clutch baskets and scored 10 each. Don Davidson was a demon on the boards,
and scored 8 points. Tommy White turned in another good performance with 8 markers, and John Barrow contributed one point.
Leading by 34-30 at the half, the 'Kittens came back after intermission.

Freshmen scoring averages as follows:
Fred Hetzel 22.3
Don Davidson 16.0
Charlie Marcon 14.8
Dave Thomas 12.5
Phil Squier 8.6
Paul Briggs 7.1
Barry Teague 5.7
Tommy White 4.5
John Barrow 1.5
