Town to begin second public art project
Book Garden will create functional community space

The town of Davidson’s campaign to support public art is once again underway. The Public Art Commission’s first sponsored piece,
“A Bouquet for Davidson,” was dedicated last Saturday at a ceremony in which Davidson professor Cort Savage, Public Art Commission
chair Karen Donelly, Mayor John Woods, and the sculptor, Andy Dunnill, spoke to a crowd of about 50.

The dynamic sculpture was dedicated to the late Kate McIntyre, former Downtown Davidson director and an adamant supporter of public
art. McIntyre initiated the push for a public art commission before passing away in 2007. Her husband, Pat Macon, spoke
at the dedication.

The dedication took place in conjunction with Downtown Davidson’s “Art on the Green” event, which celebrated the town’s vibrant artistic
life, with local artists demonstrating and selling pottery, drawings, paintings, and a number of other crafts. The festival ended Sunday,
when the College Symphony Orchestra and Jazz ensemble performed at the year’s first Concert on the Green.

Now, the Commission has received two new contributions from town members to begin another project. A festive community book garden
is planned for the space behind the Davidson Public Library.

The Commission projects that the project will cost around $100,000, of which $35,000 has already been raised. The town expects
to fund the remaining costs through private grants and tax allocations. The garden should be completed in 2010.

Although many see the project as a great improvement to the town, both functionally and aesthetically, some worry about the
way further development might damage the area’s flora. “I am concerned the proposed improvements and the work to install the
improvements will kill the tree on this site,” Doug Boone, a Davidson community member, commented. “Most professionals don’t understand how
to build around trees they are trying to save.”

The designs for the garden, drawn up by the town planning staff, were originally exhibited at the Davidson Town Hall
in February as part of a larger exhibit showcasing the many possibilities for improving the town. The book garden was
among many other ideas still unrealized, such as several public sculptures and a transformation of the Main Street bridge near
Cornelius.
