THE DAVIDSONIAN, May 7, 1920

RAINS GO DOWN IN DEFEAT AT HANDS OF SOPHS.

In a regular up-hill game, the Sophs overcame a three-run lead and proceeded to pound out an 8 to 4
victory over the Seniors. The Seniors got hog wild in the opening stanza and pounced on Robert's delivery for a
trio of counters. The Sophs, fighting doggedly, however, finally evened things up in the seventh. The features of the contest
were the all-round playing of “Sandy” Erwin. This spry youth from Bailey knocked out a triple that decided the contest,
and then caught a hot liner, relaying it to second, to first, completing a neat triple play and incidentally killed
an attempted Senior rally. Cathey had the Sophs guessing during the earlier stages of the game, but his support weakened,
and towards the last, easy chances went for safeties. Roberts had a first inning as wild as a March hare,
but calmed down after that, and had the “Brains” eating out of his hand.

Score by innings:
Seniors .......... 301 000 000—4
Sophs ............ 101 000 222—8

Batteries: Sullivan and Cathey, Nash and Roberts.

THERE IS NONE SO GOOD

ARCH. B. TAYLOR, '11; Manager

LAST GAME OF SEASON GOES TO FURMAN, 3 TO 1.

Lads Fail to Hit at Opportunities, Team Fields Well.Game of the season witnessed the defeat of the Red and Black
team at the hands of the Baptists in Greenville by the score of 3 to 1. The game was a
fast and very pretty one, barring the tricky tactics of Furman.

It has never been the policy of Davidson to kick or offer an alibi for losing a game, but on
this occasion, she has just grounds. The Furman pitcher continually scratched the ball by means of tacks in his belt
in order to use what is termed an “enemy ball,” which is far from considered good sportsmanship. While it not
only aided him, it handicapped our pitcher in his delivery. This is not the only complaint that can be made
against Furman, but why state more? The opinion of the whole Davidson team is that Furman should be completely dropped
from her schedule hereafter.

Currie pitched excellent ball and under ordinary conditions should have won. Padget, by means of his “freak” delivery, also twirled
a very good game. For Furman, Nixon starred with the stick, getting three hits out of four up. For Davidson,
Crawford and Ratchford put up the best brand of ball, each getting two hits. The box score follows:

ELON AND TRINITY BOW BEFORE DAVIDSON TENNIS TEAM

Our tennis team returned to the Hill Monday grandly and rightfully bearing the “Veni, Vidi, Vici” banner. For while our
baseball team was losing two hard luck games to Tech, and our track team being barely nosed out of second
place in the state meet, Hawkins and Spence were conquering Elon and Trinity across the tennis net.

The team left here Tuesday and arrived at Elon Wednesday morning. In the afternoon of that day, Hawkins and Spence
defeated Gray and Newman in two consecutive sets of doubles. Immediately afterwards, Spence repeated this feat against Holland in the
singles. The following day, the boys journeyed to Durham where they met the fast Trinity pair. Here, in two close
and hard-fought sets, our couple defeated Cornwall and Shinn in doubles. Then Hawkins beat Shinn two out of three sets
in singles, and Spence in his turn did likewise with Cornwall.

Fellows, our team has beaten two of the best teams in the state and intend to give Elon a drubbing
that we can see next Wednesday. We want this pair in Atlanta next week, to enter the Southern meet. We
yet have a chance to wreak vengeance on Tech if we will only give Spence and Hawkins a chance to
show them up. Tennis men, we congratulate you on your victory, and wish you the same success in the future.

Miss Mary Lafferty and Miss Hunt were among those who visited Mooresville last week. Miss Rosa Shumaker went to Charlotte
last week on business.
