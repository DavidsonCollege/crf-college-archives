Sixty-Four Sons of Davidson College Alumni Are Now Enrolled as Students

Survey Shows That These Men Are Sons of Sixty Alumni, for Four Former Students Have Two Sons Enrolled

FIRST OF RESEARCH

Alumni Office Has Asked Assistance of Students in Preparing “Relative” Data

Sixty-four sons of Davidson College alumni are now enrolled as students at Davidson, according to a survey which has been completed by the alumni office here. This is the first of a series of reports which will be made on a research started last week on the relatives of the present student body who have attended Davidson. Over half of the students have already responded with returned blanks, and the report today is supplemented by the information contained on them, and the alumni secretary's knowledge of alumni and their sons.

These 64 men are the sons of sixty alumni, for four of them have two sons enrolled. No alumnus has three sons at Davidson at the present time. The double honor is shared by Rev. C. H. Little, of Charlotte; Rev. J. K. Parker, of Mount Mourne; Rev. E. B. Robinson, of Talladega, Ala.; and Rev. W. T. Thompson, D.D., of Richmond, Va.

An examination shows that these 64 men have come to Davidson from ten different states and two foreign countries. Besides the two Carolinas, the other states are Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and California. Foreign countries represented in the group are China and Korea.

All but two of the 60 fathers are still living. The two deceased ones are the late Rev. L. A. Simpson, ’76, who died in May, 1917, and the late Rev. M. A. Ray, ’06, who died February 20, 1930.

More individual members of the class of 1899 have sons at Davidson than any other, for they lead with seven, and the classes of 1900 and 1906 are tied with six alumni each. However, alumni of 1900 have as many sons as 1899, for one member of the former class has two boys here. The earliest class represented is 1876, and the latest is 1910.

The number of sons of Davidson men enrolling here is rapidly increasing. When the first survey was made at Davidson seven years ago, approximately 45 of them had boys enrolled. Last year the number was in the neighborhood of 55, and this year it jumped to 64.

Davidson Men in Eastern Carolina Meet on Monday

Alumni, Ministers, Trustees, Parents and Prospective Students to Gather at New Bern. Other Meetings

Davidson College alumni in the eastern part of North Carolina will hold their first alumni gathering next Monday night at 7 o’clock, when alumni of this institution, ministers of Albemarle Presbytery, trustees of Davidson, parents of the students now enrolled here, along with the sons of alumni and other prospective students meet in the First Presbyterian Church at New Bern for a supper and meeting afterward, at which Dr. Walter L. Lingle, president of Davidson, will be the guest of honor and principal speaker.

Arrangements for this meeting have been under the direction of Rev. R. E. McClure, ’20, pastor of the First Presbyterian Church at New Bern, who has sent out attractive “circulars” to all concerned. Considerable interest has been manifested in the approaching gathering, and fully 150 people have been invited to attend. This number includes approximately 90 alumni residing within two hours’ drive of New Bern, over a territory that covers ten counties.

Dr. Lingle is to be in Wilmington, and will drive to New Bern, where he speaks to the Parent-Teachers Association and ministers of Craven County at 4 o'clock. After attending the alumni meeting in New Bern he returns to Wilmington for a day or two before he comes back to Davidson.

Plans are also progressing for a series of alumni meetings in the eastern part of the country. Dr. MacConnell has been invited as special guest of the New York chapter on March 16th, and has agreed to also attend meetings in Philadelphia and Baltimore. The date of March 17th has already been accepted by officers of the Philadelphia chapter; and acceptance of March 18th as the date for the Baltimore assembling is expected momentarily.

Honor System Here Nationally Known

The honor system of Davidson is nationally known. During the past several years over 200 requests have been received by officials

AFRAID? OF WHAT?
By E. H. Hamilton

A Chinese girl who saw Mr. Vinson before he was shot heard the bandits threatening him with guns. “Aren’t you afraid?” they asked. “No,” he answered, “I am not afraid. If you shoot me, I will go right to Heaven.”

Afraid? Of what?
To feel the spirit’s glad release?
To pass from pain to perfect peace,
The strife and strain of life to cease?
Afraid—of that?

Afraid? Of what?
Afraid to see the Saviour’s face,
To hear His welcome, and to trace
The glory gleam from wounds of grace?
Afraid—of that?

Afraid? Of what?
A flash—a crash—a pierced heart;
Darkness—light—O Heaven’s art!
A wound of His a counterpart!
Afraid—of that?

Afraid? Of what?
To enter into Heaven’s rest,
And yet to serve the Master blest,
From service good to service best?
Afraid—of that?

Afraid? Of what?
To do by death what life could not—
Baptize with blood a stony plot,
Till souls shall blossom from the spot?
Afraid—of that?

The above was printed in many of the church papers, and was re-printed in last week’s issue of The Literary Digest, which used it in connection with a news account of the death of Dr. Vinson. It is from the pen of Rev. E. H. Hamilton, 1917 graduate of Davidson, who is a missionary, but who at present is at 495 Ashby St. S. W., Atlanta, Ga., on furlough. Mr. Hamilton is the author of the words to “O Davidson,” and was a visitor on the campus last spring, shortly after he had returned fromHere, great were the demands that the college authorities have several hundred small booklets containing the constitution and by-laws printed for distribution. The greatest influx of requests came after Dr. R. S. Kelly, secretary of the General Education Board of New York, made an exhaustive study of Davidson, the report of which was sent to most of the educational institutions of America. In his report, Dr. Kelly lauded the excellency of the student government and honor system. He also traveled extensively, and wherever he went he had words of praise and commendation for the effectiveness of student government at Davidson. The great number of requests have somewhat followed his itinerary.
