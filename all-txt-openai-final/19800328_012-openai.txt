Ralph Nader

He has been called the man who gives the most distinction to the “high office of Citizen of the Republic;”
his every action is subject to controversy. The man is Ralph Nader, and he will be on campus Tuesday, April
2, with a lecture entitled “Consumerism in the Coming Decade.” Nader’s remarkable history of achievements indicates that he is probably
America’s most effective social critic and consumer advocate.

Nader first gained recognition in 1965 with his book Unsafe at Any Speed, a scathing indictment that lambasted the auto
industry for producing unsafe vehicles. In the meantime, he and his national network of citizen action groups have investigated nuclear
energy, medical practices, unsafe drugs, and pesticides—to name a few.

Passage of a Truth in Testing Law in New York is Nader’s most recent accomplishment. This legislation made available previously
undisclosed information concerning the Education Testing Service (ETS). He and his organization are still investigating ETS, the company which administers,
along with many other standardized tests, the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), taken by thousands of high school students each year.

Nader is the founder of Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group that has spawned Congress Watch, The Tax Reform Research
Group, Critical Mass Energy Project, and the Health Research Group. In order to retain his independence, Nader has refused any
government or corporate funding, and has turned down corporate positions.

Ralph Nader was born in 1934 and raised in Winsted, Connecticut. He graduated magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa
from Princeton University in 1955 and received his law degree from Harvard in 1958.

There will be a breakfast with Mr. Nader Tuesday morning (8:00 a.m.) in the 900 Room, and he will be
speaking at 10:00 a.m. in Love, with a question and answer period following his lecture.

Field Day

The Campus Wide Field Day will take place this Friday between 2:00 and 5:00 p.m. There will be a wide
range of student activities in front of Chambers, including guitar playing, croquet, and volleyball.

The Field Day is part of an even more varied program for 107 highly qualified or early entrance students who
will arrive here this evening for the SGA Admissions weekend. This is just the second year of the event and
organizer Ben McCall is optimistic about its success. According to a survey, 78 of the 119 students invited last year
are now at Davidson.

In the 900 Room

After a rough week of classes, very little is as relaxing as the sounds of a good band such as
the Stewart-Tussing Band, performing this weekend in the 900 Room. This four-man act combines classical and rock sounds to produce
music all its own. Kevin Stewart, lead vocalist, plays the acoustic guitar and the foot pedal bass. Gary Tussing, cello
player, adds a classical dimension, bringing his eight years of experience playing with the Florida Gulf Coast Symphony. Bill Pound
adds flair on the flute as well as the electric guitar, while doing his bit with the vocals. On the
drums, Sean Stewart, the band’s newest member, completes the group. The sound produced by this curious mélange of instruments can
best be described as acoustic jazz-rock. Join them in the 900 Room Friday and Saturday nights at 9:30 and 11:00
p.m.
