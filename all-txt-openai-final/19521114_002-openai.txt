**Executive Committee Clarifies Stand On Current Holiday Issue**

November 13, 1952

The Executive Committee of the Faculty would like to express its appreciation of the spirit shown by the students in requesting single cuts on January 2 and 3, 1953, instead of asking for an extension of the Christmas recess to include those days, which was more greatly desired by them. The Committee concluded, after careful study, that it could not grant the request for single cuts, partly because the benefits therefrom would be so uneven among the students, and partly because it would be impossible to do any worthwhile work with greatly depleted classes on those two days.

The committee then considered the feasibility of extending the holiday to Monday morning, January 5. Such an extension did not seem wise. In the judgment of the committee, it would be unfair to many students having plans for the week before Christmas to make the two days up by beginning the holidays on December 20 instead of December 18. To make them up by reducing the time allowed for examinations seemed to the committee to have disadvantages from the viewpoint of the students that made a return to work on January 2 preferable.

For a number of years, the Faculty has tried to place the holiday period so as to allow as much time as possible before Christmas Day, thinking that this was the most important part of the period to the bulk of the students, and especially to those who wished to seek employment during the recess. This year, with Christmas falling on Thursday, it seemed desirable to begin the holiday on the 18th and to reopen College on January 2. A holiday of more than two full weeks could not be provided without making Commencement a full week later in June or without reducing the examination periods. Both of these alternatives appeared to be more disadvantageous than reopening on January 2.

The Faculty is anxious to adjust the calendar to the reasonable convenience of the students and their families. When the present year's calendar was prepared, the faculty acceded to a request from the students for a long Thanksgiving holiday. Any suggestion that the Faculty set the reopening of College for January 2 to offset the advantage of the long Thanksgiving holiday is entirely without warrant. The customary full two weeks at Christmas were provided for, and they come to an end on the morning of January 2 for the reason that they begin as early as the close of College exercises on December 18.

The desire of the Faculty to meet the reasonable convenience of the students is indicated by an action of the Executive Committee, taken in connection with the discussion of the recent petition of the students. This action requests the Faculty committee on the calendar to consult with the student members of the committee on Student-Faculty relationships before fixing the calendar in future years.

**A Modest Proposal: A Step Toward A Better Davidson**

The problem of the date of return from Christmas vacation has been discussed as democratically as possible for the past several weeks in The Davidsonian. After considering the matter last week, the Executive Committee did not decide in favor of either proposal presented to them by Jack Ruth or Bob Henry, president of ODK, and the reasons for their decision have been released in this issue.

To this writer, it seems that the question goes far beyond the decision, for we feel that in a sense it is a test case and under present conditions an ever-recurring one. The Davidsonian has campaigned hard and vigorously for the extension, but now feels that this, as all other previous issues, belongs to the past. However, the principal or problem that occasioned these issues is not dead, but still present.

It is the opinion of this writer that this and similar problems stem directly from the very apparent lack of a functioning student body-faculty joint relationship. There have been many suggested remedies for this situation, but this paper proposes only one. That is the reactivation of the Faculty-Student Conference Committee.

The Constitution provides for such a committee made up of three faculty members elected from the faculty, and five student members to be the presidents of the upper classes, the freshman advisor, and a fifth member selected from ODK. Its purpose is to facilitate a free and frank interchange of ideas and viewpoints upon college matters of general interest to the students and faculty. Any member of the student body can meet with this committee to express any ideas and participate in the discussions. However, to our knowledge, it has neither existed nor functioned during the past four years.

The reestablishment and reactivation of the committee would not be an “all-take” and “no-give” proposition, but set up for a long-range view toward an ultimate and practical solution. The keynote is advanced cooperation in attempted long-range planning, as contrasted with mere destructive criticism. In addition to meeting and deciding on countless minor problems, this committee could meet with the Calendar Committee to avoid any possible conflict in the scheduled Concert-Artist Series, to aid in the establishment of holiday schedules, to make recommendations toward the holding to or the abolishing of the oft disregarded review period schedule, and in general to decide on the many problems that are characteristic of each school year.

The need is already apparent. It is for us now to take steps toward fulfilling that need. Words and platforms are sometimes meaningless, goals and motives sometimes empty, and action sometimes complacent. Perhaps past Davidsonians have campaigned for the same things, but this is neither an idle protest nor an attempt to fill up a week's editorial column. It is, however, an attempt to propose not only the right step, but the only step for a cooperative Davidson. It is a forward step and a completely different attitude. It is an endeavor to examine issues before those issues are actually created—to discuss problems while they are still in the formative stage. How different is this attitude from our present ineffective criticism of previously decided issues.

Even a casual observer would recognize the fact that shortsightedness or complacency would destroy all future hopes for improvement, and preserve the existing system. The Davidsonian challenges the faculty-administration, student body, student council, ODK, and any other person intimately concerned with the welfare of Davidson College, not only for the reinstitution, but for reactivation of a concerned and active Faculty-Student Committee. It is a choice between long-range planning and short-range griping. The decision is yours as is the ultimate solution for all future problems.—F.H.

**THE CABBAGE PLANTER: Forest Fires, Alexander Trial Focus Attention On W. N. C.**

Mountains are earth’s undecaying monuments. —N. Hawthorne.

Two recent events have focused much of the country’s attention on the hill-country of Western North Carolina and Tennessee. More serious between them are the intermittent and widespread forest fires; the other, more colorful event is last Wednesday’s trial in Asheville of Tom Alexander, accused of killing a bear on federal, protected property. The case was heard under Judge Wilson Warlick, one of the South's outstanding jurists. It was Judge Warlick, as you remember, whom Fall Services speaker Thompson claimed credited 100% of his cases to drink.

This may all be true, but that ignores a lot of details. For instance, Tom Alexander may have been feeling pretty good when he shot that bear last May, but it’s a sure bet if he hadn't had something to warm him up and soothe his nerves, he would have been bound to miss the bear and hit a tourist. Though tourists are protected in the Great Smokies, the charge against him then would not have been homicide, but at most, eliminating a public means of support. Tourists, in one form or another, are a necessary evil in the mountains, and since they don’t taste near as good as bear meat, the chances are they'll stay around longer.

Testimony in the Alexander trial revealed that there were about twenty holes in the bear in question. Chances are there weren't many more than twenty shots fired. Tales of the marksmanship of Western North Carolina go back as far as the days when Davy Crockett was wandering around North Carolina, Virginia, and Tennessee. One of them has to do with a shooting match he lost by default. Crockett was shooting with Mike Fink. Shooting first, Crockett aimed at a cat 150 yards away on the fence of Fink's potato patch. According to those who are supposed to know, “the ball cut off both the old tom cat's ears close to his head, and shaved the hair off clean across the skull, as slick as if he'd done it with a razor, and the critter never stirred, nor knew he'd lost his ears till he tried to scratch 'em.”

Firing next, Mike Fink aimed at a far-off sow and a litter of pigs, and kept “loading and firing for dear life, till he hadn't left one of them pigs enough tail to make a toothpick on.” Crockett saw that Fink had left about an inch of tail on one of the pigs, so he added a shot and cut it off as if it “had been drove in with a hammer.” Supposedly Crockett then added, “That made Mike a kinder sorter wrothy, and he sends a ball after his wife as she was going to the spring after a gourd full of water, and knocked half her comb out of her head, without stirring a hair, and calls out to her to stop for me (Continued On Page Four)

**’52 Grad. Finds AB Degree, ODK, Phi Bate Prime Requisites For Lucrative Occupation**

One of the joys of a college education is that, after graduation, one can expect his scroll of parchment to be a passport into the business world, garnering jobs for him which would otherwise be unattainable. The four years a student spends at college are considered as time well spent, for during this time he is expected to derive some knowledge and acumen of the affairs of the world, and also the ability to translate this newfound knowledge into practical experience. The college handbook will tell you that a man's college education will develop initiative and stimulate creative thinking. Now, more than ever, the trend seems to be back to the good old liberal education which includes a smattering of everything; the thought being that a liberal education insures a more fully developed, better acclimated executive for the large corporations. That’s why every spring we see representatives from all types of businesses descending upon the campus in droves, promising five-figured salaries and four-figured ulcers to the budding young graduates who are diligently seeking jobs. It really is quite heart-warming to think of such a future in sight.

One would expect that, the better a student is in his studies, and the more diversified his interests while he is on the campus here, the more lucrative would be his offers after his career has terminated. We have Phi Beta Kappa to honor those who have excelled in the realm of scholarly achievement, by dint of putting in many hours above and beyond the call of duty and who should derive some benefits thereof in later life. For the Big Men on the campus, there is a highly selective organization of the campus known as Omicron Delta Kappa, which is the Valhalla on earth for important leaders in college functions. Both of these are highly respected honor societies, and rightly so, for they not only recognize superiority in talented students, but also excite keener competition among the undergraduate student body. Thus when someone speaks of a person being both Phi Bate and ODK, there is sudden silence and hats are respectfully doffed in homage to the person who could corral both of these honors. Yea, verily, and a mighty man is he.

Since these plaudits are included in a man’s record, it would seem only natural that the choicest plums as far as jobs go would fall into their laps, and because of their laborious efforts in college they would, in later life, partake of the “serendipity” which Professor Erwin spoke about in chapel the other day. They, theoretically, would be the fair-haired boys of the world. Such, tragically, is not always the case. Last weekend one of 1952's BMOC’s, a Phi Bate and ODK man, returned for a visit to the dear old AlmaMater; this aforementioned one being affectionately known as “Desert Head,” due to the distinct similarity which his cranial extremity bears to a wind-swept sand dune. After the genuflections were finished—this honor we accord all visiting dignitaries—we questioned him about the lucrativeness of his job, and if it entailed any great responsibility, for we were anxious to hear the details from this tycoon of industry. After great deliberation and stuttering, he explained that he had entered the railroad business lately, and had already risen to chief engineer, conductor, dispatcher, and co-ordinator for the crack Sunburst Limited on the famous Lionel Lines. He furthermore informed us that all his trains operated on 00 and 027 gauge track, and all his engines puffed steam and were equipped with the latest in whistles. Finally, he rather sheepishly admitted that he was running the electric trains in the toy department at Ivey's in Charlotte, and benevolently answering all queries from his juvenile audience about the intricacies of making electric choo-choo’s stop and go. He said his brain was being taxed severely by operating the complicated switches and adjusting the delicate transformers, and he sure did wish for the good old days when all he had to do was study philosophy, psychology, and American Civilization and Thought. Pretty soon they are going to put two trains on the platform for him to run, and he's worried about having a nervous breakdown trying to keep them from running together. Really it is quite a touching story, to hear the occupational hazards which he suffers in his newfound position. Suppose a train should jump the track; then he is responsible for getting the whole thing back on the rails all by himself. Truly, no compensation is worth such unjust anguish. Therefore, undergraduates, press on! You, too, can succeed in the vigors of the business world. Drop by the toy department at Ivey's any time; old “Desert Head” will be glad to give you his secrets about how to be a success after college. That is, if he isn’t fired first.

THE FREE LANCE: FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 14, 1952

What Are Limitations On Free Press At D.C. And Elsewhere?

A recurring topic of argument at Davidson is the matter of a free press. Oddly enough, it is less complained of by those directly associated with the paper than by those who have no connection with it. When the former group gets hot under the old Arrow, however, they usually have good reason, and they were rather warm last week. Freedom of the press like all other freedoms must remain that and not reach a stage wherein it becomes license. By license, we mean any practice which is an abnormal extension of a freedom so that it inhibits other freedoms. Newspapers are not free to print anything they wish. In addition to the familiar libel suits, there can be suits for crimes such as printing pornographic matter or weather reports with faked authentication. Very few American newspapers have maintained a strictly unbiased news policy for any length of time. The “good gray Times” of New York is perhaps the most famous example of an objective paper which has remained objective, though for several years after its inception it was anything but. There are many theories which go into deciding how much slant to put into the news columns. Perhaps the most outstanding is an idea that the readers haven't time to interpret the news for themselves and need certain partially opiniative statements to guide them. Traditionally the appearance of a by-line over a story means that there may be some of the writer's own opinion in the story, but so many wire service stories come out with them that they are almost meaningless to modern newspaper readers. It is no easy problem for managing editors to decide how much or how little slant will appear in their columns. Certain tabloid papers make it a point to play up the gory and macabre angle of stories in order to sell more papers. Difficult as it is to determine the front page or general news policy, this problem is dwarfed beside the question of how to run the editorial page. Many metropolitan sheets have their own united (to some degree) editorial staff and in addition print large amounts of canned copy like Pearson and Pegler. A college editor can multiply by infinity the extent of the difficulties along the aforementioned lines. He has to grapple with inaccuracy due to reporter ignorance in his news columns and some fire heads on his editorial page. Nowhere on earth do more world reformers exist than in the ranks of those who clamor to get their two bits worth of yak on a college ed page. There are various factors which contribute to this wildness but they are not our immediate concern. As the size of the college diminishes the editor has to tread even more carefully, for there are various special interests which have the power to kick him or the paper or both off the campus if he steps on any toes too hard. This close restrictive potential makes his job of decision harder for he can see some glaring wrongs and yet cannot reach out and pin them for fear of reprisal. At best it’s like juggling two primed A-bombs. It is conceivable how in an isolated case an administrative veto might itself approach the state of being license while ostensibly devoted to the purpose of preventing the school paper's freedom from exceeding its bounds. Alexander Hamilton stated that the “Liberty of the press consists of the right to publish with impunity truth with good motives for justifiable ends though (it) might reflect on government magistracy and individuals.” We are inclined to agree with this somewhat loose definition. If a thing or a man be wrong or right we think a paper, even as an individual student, should have the right to say so providing the motive of the paper is essentially constructive and based on intelligent reasoning. Because that truth will hurt a man or create an illusion contrary to what an administration might desire created is not sufficient cause to keep it out of print. A wrong is a wrong no matter if a cripple or a circus strong man says or commits it. The real danger in criticism is that in print it may indicate that a thing or a man is all bad. Nothing is all bad. At times it is foreseeable how favorable publicity in excess might create an equally distorted view. It is a regretful though nonetheless obvious fact that no one group anywhere has achieved perfection. It is a valuable service to have faults illumined. It is not always a succulent service. In brief we think with Edwin C. James, late managing editor of the N.Y. Times who said, “Freedom of the press is not a freedom to print what the editors like (or dislike), but a freedom of the people to read what they want.” We believe the American college student wants to read the truth.

DAVIDSONIAN ABROAD:

Davidson Student Beholds John Knox’s Hq; Thinks Edinburgh Lived Through It, So Can We

You walk down Princes Street in Edinburgh among the mid-morning crowd of shoppers, and on your side of the street are all the fashionable stores, where in the summer the prices are even higher than in London, and on the other side of the street, beyond the jangling, hurrying trolley cars, are the Edinburgh Gardens. You've seen formal gardens before, in London, in Florence, in Paris, and the Parisian formal gardens are the best-kept in the world—but you've never seen gardens which people enjoyed so much. On this morning, when warm sunlight beats down tenderly on the soft grass, you lie down full-length and gaze up at Edinburgh Castle, set high above the Gardens and all of Edinburgh on a rocky prominence, war-like and forbidding even on this airy summer day. But you've been riding on the train all night from London, and you got precious little sleep, because there were a couple of drunken sailors in the compartment next to yours who came in to goggle at the teen-age Belgian girls in your compartment every few minutes, and who were finally thrown off the train about three o'clock in the morning. Fortunately for your national pride, the sailors were English and not American. So now, in Edinburgh Gardens, instead of looking up at the castle, you promptly fall asleep, and wake up only when the pangs of hunger force you to seek out some eating place. You cross the street again to rejoin the jostling crowd in front of the stores. You pause, out of curiosity, at Woolworth’s—for lo, the forces of American economic imperialism extend even to the uttermost reaches of the earth, and you can buy a coke as easily in Paris, Johannesburg, or Sydney, Australia, as you can in Davidson—a lot easier on Sunday. Finally, you drift into Mackie’s, a safely Scottish establishment, to get something to eat, and are immediately confronted with a queue. There is nothing the British love better than a long queue, unless it be a cup of tea. They will stand in line for hours waiting for a bus, waiting to get just a wee glimpse of Princess Margaret Rose, waiting for a cinema, or just waiting because they see somebody else waiting. It’s a national pastime. Now, though, they are waiting for food, and you have to wait with them if you want to get rid of that gnawing pain in the pit of your stomach. Finally, you get your food, and then you wonder if it wouldn’t have been better to starve. The reign of austerity in Britain has continued now since the beginning of World War II, and the beleaguered little island is faced with a slow war of attrition against economic forces which is perhaps not as terrifying as the German blitzkrieg but is certainly just as dreadful and requiring even higher moral courage, if that is possible. You spend the rest of the day sightseeing in Edinburgh Castle, John Knox’s home, and the University of Edinburgh. Then, enough walking for the day—back to the Gardens to hear the pipe band! Now, in July, it stays light in Edinburgh until ten thirty: it’s summer and the countryside is gorgeous with purple heather in bloom, and the moors stretch away to the distant horizon in tangled, barbarian magnificence. But in winter, they say, it’s dark at half past three in the afternoon, and the cold wind from the North Sea cuts through you like a whip. The moors become a dismal, jumbled stretch of lonely land, and there is no heather.

FROM THE EDITORS MAILBOX:

Christian Pacifism Seen As Solution For International Tension, Leading To Peace

Dear Editor:

Some will argue that the topic which I propose to discuss is extraneous to the immediate concerns to which a newspaper should devote itself. Christian Pacifism has never been a popular position, and in view of the situation of our generation, surrounded as it is with international tension, defense preparations, the draft, and actual combat in the Far East, it has been dismissed as a fanciful dream, incapable of application in a relativistic, or as Niebuhr would term it, “immoral” society. Even admitting that Christ, in his famous talk on Christian ethics often called the “Sermon on the Mount,” explicitly pronounced the principle of non-retaliation of violence for violence, most Christians will join with our nation's leaders in insisting that pacifism is unrealistic. In a school like Davidson where we are reminded daily of the fundamental worth of Christian teaching, an active ROTC unit is maintained which has as its sole motive the schooling of students in the principles of armed combat. We listen to the 5th chapter of Matthew for five minutes in the morning and then drill for two hours that afternoon, somehow completely unconscious or at least unconcerned with the patent inconsistency. The clergy enjoins its congregations to consider military service a duty to God, since it is only by fighting to preserve our liberty that we can be assured of the free expression of our Faith. Christians and non-Christians alike join in maintaining that “cloud-contained” idealists should compromise their pretty ideals and join their fellows in combating the ugly realities of contemporary life. Communism will not be thwarted by turning the other cheek, for it will not stop at two blows but will stomp the fundamental individual and national rights we hold most dear into the dust of godless despotism. Not only is pacifism considered unrealistic, but many maintain that it is cowardly and selfish. The pacifist, they assert, remains aloof from the responsibilities of citizenship in time of war but is quite willing to enjoy its privileges once the crisis is past and his fellow citizens have, with “blood, sweat and tears,” preserved national freedom. These are but a few of the arguments commonly advanced against pacifism. What can the Christian (Continued On Page Four)
