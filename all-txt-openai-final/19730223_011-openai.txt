Tribe Tops A League With Unbeaten Record

We look at the League this week as a lot of big games took place, which resulted in the top
teams staying, for the most part, on top. In Division 1, the Cleveland Indians still hold strong to their top
term.

In basketball action last week, the Indians triumphed in a contest against J Team, winning 77-67. Mark Roden and Juan
Sanches scored 16 points to lead the Indians, while Lewis had 18 and Harper pumped in 22 points to pace
the losers. The Tribe's record now stands at 8-0.

F&M No. 1 stayed right on the Indians' heels as they picked up a couple of wins to go to
a 7-1 slate. Their biggest test was against Emanon No. 1. Randy Ely dominated a close, low-scoring game as his
team nipped Emanon 40-38. F&M led by as much as 10 points through the second half, but an Emanon full-court
press brought them back to within two points with 20 seconds left. Emanon stole the ball and set up a
final shot with nine seconds left, but the shot went long and a jump ball resulted in a desperation shot
that just missed. The final score was F&M No. 1 40, Emanon No. 1 38. Gordon Glasgow had 12 points
and Larry Ruddell had 10 to lead Emanon.

A big game between F&M No. 1 and the Cleveland Indians was scheduled for last Tuesday night, but it was
postponed by the Athletes In Action practice. The game will presumably be made up at a later date.

PDT No. 1 also stayed in the top four of the league's No. 1 division as they increased their record
to 8-2 in their latest action. The talented duo of Marty Williamson and Chris Young led the Gammas to two
victories. First, against the hapless KA’s (0-10), Williamson tallied 20 points and Young 11 to lead PDT No. 1 to
a 78-38 stomping of the cellar dwellers. Next, against PDT No. 3, the Gammas had to work a little harder
as they still won handily by a 61-48 margin. Williamson once again had 20 and Young added 12 to pace
the Gammas. Koss Manire and George Weicker led the Delts with 12 apiece.

Prior to losing to F&M No. 1, Emanon picked up two wins to move their record up to 7-2. They
beat PDT No. 2 66-45 as Frank Folger pumped in 22 points and Calvin Allen added 14. A Sunday game
almost saw Emanon stumble as they nipped a tough Soul Patrol team 58-56. Ruddell and Glasgow paced the winners with
13 and 10 points, respectively, while Demery led the Soul Patrol with 20.

In Division 2 of the power league, PKA No. 1 continues to roll. Against PAX A, they ran into someone
who did not feel like playing dead, and at the end of regulation time, the score was tied. However, the
Pikas did not let this phase them (does anything phase the Pikas?), and they rolled off a six-point win. Bill
McKinnon had 19 for PAX while Tom Dover and Charlie Slagle added 12 and 11 points. Previously, the PKA’s had
dumped Us 59-47 as they held Sam Upchurch to a lowly six points. Five days later, Upchurch, obviously upset, went
out and canned 42 points, his high total for EMAC.This year, as Us handed the Wizardry a 61-44 defeat, Cpehureh
had warmed up for this performance with a 24-point spree in a victory over C2. PDT stayed just behind the
leaders as they picked up three big wins in the last two weeks. First, they obliterated the Delts 57-28 as
Eddie Womack and Hester Hesterburg picked up 14 apiece to lead the way. Next, the Delts simply outran the aptly
named Old Men as they won 69-49. Don Henderson had 15 points and Jim Brown 13 to lead the winners,
while Howard Arbuckle, Chip Stone, and Rollie Sumwalt had 12, 11, and 10 for the losers. On Tuesday, the Delts
ran their second-place record to 4-1 as they knocked off the SPE’s in a wild, rough game 52-44. Jim Brown
had 16 points and Andy Davis had 12 to lead the Delts.

DON'T FENCE ME IN
Some rugged IMAC action as playoff time draws near. Big John Simms had 28 to lead all scorers for the
SPE’s. The SPE’s had a good week despite losing to PDT. They picked up an easy win over Cosbies Cosmos.
Alexander had 15 and Simms 14 to lead the Nationals to victory. Sanders totaled 22 for the losers. The SPE’s
also dealt Delts a 73-39 as Simms had 16, Alexander 12, and Stanzel 17 to pace the winners. The SPE’s
hold down third with a solid 8-2 mark. The Old Men are hanging tough in fourth with a 6-3 record.
They went one for one in the week as they picked up a loss and a fortunate forfeit win over
GPG and got a win. So League A looks like this as the end of regular season play gets closer.

Overtime victors. Mike Whalen exploded for 22 points while Eric "The Big Bo" Schaling picked up 16. However, it was
the Pika bench that came in and did the trick according to Pika Assistant Coach Tommy "Bo" Verhn. Strangely enough,
Verhn also ended up refereeing.
