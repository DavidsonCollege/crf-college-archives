Delightfully comic performance a nice surprise

By MARTHA JOHNSON

The Acting Company presented Shakespeare's *As You Like It* to the Davidson community last night in Love Auditorium. The play,
which was the second Artists Series performance of the season, was imaginative and delightfully comic. Shakespeare's comedy turned out to
be a nice surprise for those expecting confusing dialogue and tragedy. The action progressed from the court of Duke Frederick
to the forest desert of Arden, where the Duke had banished his brother. The plot contrasted four relationships between couples
and their reactions to love, women, and marriage.

Orlando, a nobleman, is forced to leave the court after winning an unlikely bout against a wrestler, but after being
betrayed by his brother, Oliver. Rosalind, daughter of the banished Duke, and Celia, her cousin, flee after Duke Frederick orders
Rosalind, who had fallen in love with Orlando, away. Oliver follows Celia, whom he had fallen in love with. Both
couples ended up in the forest, where a counterplot develops between two country couples.

Much of the hilarity and confusion of the play occurs when Rosalind disguises herself as a young boy. At one
point she even captures the heart of a shepherdess. The comedy ends happily with the senior duke unbanished and each
couple wed. Stephen McCabe, set and costume designer, added an imaginative twist to the drama. The setting and costumes of
Act I, in simple grays and whites, were surprisingly 20th century in taste, but McCabe's efforts to blend the old
and new were successful. The set designer beautifully coordinated the forest scenes of Acts II and III in pastels with
a carnival atmosphere, as kites and umbrellas served as trees. The costumes in the final acts, however, more closely resembled
the expected Elizabethan exuberance. Most important, McCabe created scenery and costumes to fit the gaiety and wit of the play.

The acting was well performed, with no awkward moments and a smooth flow of clearly delivered dialogues. Excitement was sustained
from the first act's wrestling match to the singing and dancing of the final scene. The actors were well cast,
particularly Philip Goodwin as Jacques, a servant, who was responsible for brief serious insights such as the famous “All the
world’s a stage...” speech. The Acting Company's production of *As You Like It* opened February 9, 1985, in New Jersey.
The company, which has toured successfully with various shows since 1972, works to provide experience for young actors and actresses.

**Music Convocation today**

By ANDY BALL

Davidson College will host its 26th annual Sacred Music Convocation next Friday at 9:30 a.m. in the Cunningham Fine Arts
Center. The Convocation celebrates classical music used in the worship of God. This year’s Convocation will emphasize, in particular, the
music associated with Luther's German Mass. Among the musicians who will perform during the two-day event are George Ritchie, organist,
Richard Luby, violinist, and Wilmer Hayden Welsh, organist.

Ritchie is Head of the Organ department and professor of Organ at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln's school of
music. He is scheduled to speak at 10:30 a.m. Friday and 9 a.m. Saturday and will perform an organ recital
at 8:15 Friday evening. Luby is a music faculty member at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and
Artistic Coordinator of the Society for Performance on Original Instruments. He will perform a recital of unaccompanied violin by J.S.
Bach at 2 p.m. Friday. Davidson Music Department chairman Welsh will perform during the Service of Luther's German Mass of
1525 at 3:30 p.m. Friday in the Davidson College Presbyterian Church. Reverend Karl D. Bachman will be the presiding minister.

“The Convocation is held to provide a meeting ground for church musicians, ministers, and anyone else who is interested in
music as a form of worship,” Welsh said. “It should challenge the musicians to do more interesting things in their
church music.” Welsh added that the convocation should be especially appealing to Davidson students because of the various historical aspects
of this type of music.

**Speaker gets first-hand look at non-violence in India**

By DAVID WILLIAMS

Lilith Quinlan, founder of Common Ground in Louisiana, spoke at Davidson Wednesday concerning her experiences in India this past summer
with the Gandhi Peace Foundation. Thirty-six American and Asian citizens participated in the program, which was entitled “Alternatives to Violence:
Education and Experience in Non-Violent Social Change.” Quinlan said she traveled to India for two purposes: “to learn about non-violence
from people who have a history in non-violence,” as well as “to live with these people and have the discipline
and be exposed to the extreme differences in culture.” Quinlan said she learned much about the non-violence movement and about
the spirit of Gandhi from her experiences. “This trip put Gandhi's feet on the ground,” she said.the ground for me.
It made me understand that what he did was so rooted in the faith, the people, and the culture.” Quinlan’s
group had to deal with a large degree of culture shock upon arriving in India. “We realized that we had
to struggle for the joyful expressions that came naturally to the Indians,” Quinlan said. “Also, there is no waste in
India, as there is in the United States. And every inch of land is used for immediate sustenance.” Quinlan was
alarmed that “the oppression of women is still overwhelming” and that “education is in a very bad state” in India.
She noted that Gandhi once remarked, “people must have enough to waken the potential for human kindness.” “When you see
the suffering of the people, this is a dire reality. Forty-eight percent of India’s people live below the poverty line.
Twenty-two percent are unemployed,” she said. Despite these “frustrating” social conditions in India, Quinlan also said: “I found a great
gentleness in the people. There is a common understanding about what spiritual growth and saintliness is. This has to do
with casting away the ego and the sin.” Quinlan noted that “nonviolence is very direct and simple, and is very
deep within the Indian people.” The Gandhians, with whom she spent most of her time in India, are a “part
of the Gandhi movement who make pledges of nonviolence and the simplicity of life. They are committed to the poor
and emphasize non-involvement in political parties.” Quinlan is a former Davidson resident.

“Blood Simple” a deceptively good film
By JENNY LIVINGSTON

“Blood Simple” is one of those movies that has been labeled AN ART FILM, and promptly ignored by the general
public. One assumes that AN ART FILM must be vague, bizarre, boring, or just a pretentious piece of bullwang that
never made any money because the only people that went to see it were pretentious bullwang critics. The reputation is
widely deserved, but “Blood Simple” doesn't quite fit the bill. At first glance, “Blood Simple” has all the elements of
AN ART FILM: a two-hour-plus running time, a low budget, unknowns in all the major roles, heavy-duty themes like Death
and Betrayal, and a reasonably unorthodox director. But at its very heart, “Blood Simple” is nothing more than a good,
old-fashioned thriller with a couple of twists along the way. Set in suburban Texas, it's basically a white trash love
triangle between a woman, her tacky husband, and her husband's studly employee. The husband, of course, finds out about his
wife's little rendezvous at Billy Bob's No-Tell Motel, and decides to have the two lovers bumped off by a fat
good ole boy in a beige polyester leisure suit. Now, this is not exactly an original premise, but it is
only the beginning. From this hackneyed storyline emerges a thoroughly unpredictable chain of events. Hats off to the screenwriter. In
this case, the screenwriter, Joel Coen, is also the director. Maybe Joel should stick to writing. It’s not that his
direction is bad, exactly; it's just that he shoves it down your throat. The work of a good director is
invisible — he lets the actors act and he lets the story unfold. But in “Blood Simple,” Coen's directing openly
competes with the plot and actors. From extreme close-ups to superfast zooms to long shots at inanimate objects, Coen seems
to have a whole bag full of camera tricks he's just been dying to try out. All of this is
very distracting. The viewer can find himself paying more attention to these little tricks than to what is really going
on in the movie. It is unfortunate that his direction has a tendency to overshadow the actors, because they are
all really good. The casting director has a good eye for realism. The actors don't look like actors; they look
like people, warts and all. They act like people too, so much so that it is easy to forget that
they are acting. There is one exception to the excellent casting — the husband is played by Dan Hedaya (better
known as Carla's estranged husband Nick on “Cheers”). He's proficient, but he looks more like New Jersey than Texas. And
his Marlon Brando-esque enunciation is less than appropriate in the midst of these so-thick-you-can-cut-it-with-a-knife Texas accents. He is menacing, though,
and he adds a lot to the overall scare potential of the movie. And “Blood Simple” is definitely scary. Coen
refuses to fall into the common trap of mistaking gore for horror. The movie is plenty gory, but he uses
his gore effectively. He uses it to scare the audience, not gross them out. It's impossible to say whether Joel
Coen set out to make AN ART FILM, but we can be glad that he didn't really succeed at making
one. Despite his artsy film tricks, he has produced a movie of general interest and appeal. This one gets a
thumbs up.
