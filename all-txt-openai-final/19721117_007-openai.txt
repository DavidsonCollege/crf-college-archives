Students Air Housing Hopes To Committee

On Thursday, Nov. 9, the Committee on Future Campus Housing met with students to get ideas for new housing and renovating old housing. The students were from Grey House, North Main House, and Belk, Duke, and Little dorms. Several students felt that long halls were excellent for freshmen, but that new dorms should have suites for smaller group living. Mike Collins, a member of Grey House, suggested several suites clustered around a lounge for 12 to 16 people.

Committee chairman Will Terry said that the committee had been thinking in terms of suites with a common lounge, washer and dryer, carpeting, kitchen, and air conditioning. However, Student Body President Ralph Peeples cautioned against the suite idea for freshmen and sophomores because he was afraid the individuals may become isolated from meeting others in the College. "I would suggest waiting until students are juniors or seniors to live in clusters like this,” Peeples said.

Several of the coeds said they thought more single rooms should be built. Director of Student Housing Scotty Nicholls said, “Of all the girls that came here this year, 85 percent requested single rooms.” Mary Hobbie also suggested that architects consider that women also will live in the housing. “Little dormitory must be made for giants," she said. “We can’t see in the mirror, reach the soap in the shower, or reach the top bookshelves.” Winnie Hollis pointed out that the clothes rods in the closets are too low to hang long dresses on.

Students from Belk, complaining of cramped quarters, poor lighting, long unbroken hallways, and a lack of sufficient lounges, suggested that these factors be considered in new housing. Other students said they would like to see porches, balconies, bay windows with window seats or desks, and moveable furniture in new dorms.

The question of where new housing should be located brought a wide range of opinions. Several students and committee members favored the wooded area next to the baseball field. Professor Robert Manning, a member of the Committee, pointed out that putting housing around Patterson Court could lead to the campus being divided into an academic and residential area.

Dorm Junket Gives New Housing Ideas

In an effort to discern new trends in student housing, Dean of Students Will Terry and Student Housing Director Scotty Nicholls visited Bard College, Vassar, and Wooster College in hopes of applying such methods of housing to Davidson.

Mrs. Nicholls said that Bard's housing program offered “just about the ultimate in flexibility as far as room arrangements were concerned.” The furniture in the rooms (all of which were singles) consisted of various sizes of boxes that could be used as closets, bookshelves, etc. A long wooden plank served as a desk and the bed was made of a wooden pallet covered with foam rubber. The walls had long rows of peg-holes in them by which the various furniture could be attached. The carpeted floors were spattered with paint that students had used to decorate their walls. The moveable spotlights served for lighting. A kitchenette, laundromat, and recreation room filled the first floor of the building.

Mrs. Nicholls was impressed with the concept, but not with the finished project. She remarked, “When we drove up in front of them, I thought they were still under construction.” The natural wood effect attempted on the exterior evidently had not held up to the New York weather.

Vassar’s buildings were a mixture of old and new. There was a cooperative dormitory housing about 30 students; this impressed Mrs. Nicholls. Here the residents cleaned and cooked for themselves, thus cutting down on expenses. Also, Vassar had built a series of townhouses. Each apartment contained four or five bedrooms surrounding a full-sized kitchen and a living-dining area. Each apartment had its own entrance. Most of the housing committee felt that this was detrimental because it did not encourage meeting neighbors. Mrs. Nicholls said, “There would be a great opportunity for everyone to stay in their own little groups.”

Wooster College was in the process of renovating several of the dormitories, but little could be discerned from the sketches and plans that were available. According to Mrs. Nicholls, no further trips are being planned. “I really feel at this point we know what we want. I think it's time to get on with it,” she said.

Mrs. Nicholls feels that Davidson's new student housing will be some type of townhouses. However, no definite plans have been made about the actual architectural layouts yet. Freeman-White Associates, who accompanied the housing committee this summer, have drawn some preliminary sketches, but these are by no means definite. In fact, the college has had offers by at least two other architectural companies and the board of trustees has not yet commissioned an architectural firm.Half and a living half. He suggested that housing surround Jackson Court. Another housing site considered was the area south of the soccer field. Some liked this area because they felt it would keep students from being centralized in one corner of the campus, while others believed that this would divide the student body.

Finance and Development C. David Cornell, future housing facilities now being proposed by the Committee on Future Campus Housing could very well cost the student 100 percent more than the average rate of a present dormitory room, $700 as opposed to $350. The approach that the college is now taking to the state of the campus living situation is twofold; first, plans are now being made for the renovation of the present dormitories and second, proposals are being submitted for the construction of new student living quarters, although it is not known whether they will take the form of dormitories as Davidson now knows them.

Cornell explained that the cost of dorm renovations will be defrayed by raising the rents of the individual rooms in years to come, that is, it will be a self-liquidating debt. The money needed for the financing of proposed facilities could be obtained by borrowing money from three possible sources. The first alternative is to borrow from a private agency, repaying them out of revenues from the endowment fund over a period of 25 to 30 years. The second possible borrowing source is again from a private agency which would not only construct the facilities but run them in the future as well. The final source is the Federal Government. Money can be obtained in this way through the Housing and Urban Development Bureau (HUD), to be repaid over a 40-year period. Cornell feels, however, that federal money should be a last resort inasmuch as HUD dictates certain specifications for projects that it finances. “HUD sets up both maximum and minimum size and quality margins for an operation like this and Davidson might not want to follow these guidelines,” Cornell said.

Cornell went on to say that most of the proposed new living facilities could be expected to cost between $7000 and $8000 per room to build and that the result of this kind of expenditure would most likely be a rise in the room rent of the student to about $700 per year. “The college thus has to decide whether or not emphasis will be placed on renovating the present dorms for which the room rent would be raised to $500 per year or on building new dorms or on building cheaper new dorms for which the rent could be placed at $500," he said.

According to Cornell, the problem is that the Committee for Future Campus Housing is asking for facilities that are too lavish. He feels that the rise in the cost of campus living that such new facilities would represent would place Davidson out of price competition with similar colleges in the South; Washington and Lee University, the University of the South, and Hampden-Sydney College for example. “This kind of building project could drastically affect the education and perhaps the complexion of the student body itself,” Cornell said.

In response to this, Dean of Students Will Terry, who is a member of the future housing committee, said that he doesn’t believe that the college should have to raise the room rent above $600 for any of the proposed structures. Terry went on to say that it is the responsibility of the college to provide adequate housing for students and that, to him, the monolithic dormitory is in many ways inadequate. Terry sees compartmentalized living units similar to those found in Duke dormitory as the answer. These units would allow students a greater degree of privacy as well as a closer relationship with their neighbors. Terry explained that the college must realize that rigid finance shouldn't block the fulfillment of Davidson's philosophy of the residential college community. “Policy and finance must be compromised,” he said.
