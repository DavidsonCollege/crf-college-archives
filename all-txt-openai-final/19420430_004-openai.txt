PORTS SURVEY
By BUTCH PHARR

With the close of the Interclass Softball Tournament usually comes the picking of an All Class Team composed of the most outstanding players from the four competing teams. To avoid sticking his neck out too far, as is usually the trouble with the selection of such teams, your editor has chosen a team compiled with the aid of the managers of the class teams, several of the referees, and a few of the sports authorities among the student body (names withheld for obvious reasons).

Position Player Team
Catcher ____________ Garrison ____________ Junior
Pitcher ____________ Wayman ____________ Junior
First Base __________ Crowell ____________ Sophomore
Second Base ________ Young ____________ Junior
Short Stop __________ Walters ____________ Senior
Third Base __________ J. Thomas __________ Sophomore
Short Field _________ Larson ____________ Sophomore
Right Field _________ Murray ____________ Junior
Center Field ________ S. Hay ____________ Freshman
Left Field __________ MacKinnon __________ Senior

Adolph Larson was a unanimous choice for the short field position, receiving every vote from both managers and referees. Ed Murray and Jack Wayman polled the second number of votes for their positions, with John MacKinnon running third. The winning Juniors placed four men on the all-star team with the losing Sophomores placing three. The Seniors, who were runner-ups in the tournament, placed only two men, while the Freshmen placed one.

Other players deserving honorable mention, but who did not quite make the team, are Chester Pierce, catcher; Davis Thomas, pitcher; Bill Faison and Jim Jackson, first; Alf Taylor, second; Bill Summers, third; Rab McGeachy and Joe Barnwell, short; Dick Miller and Joe Bivens, fielder.

Star of the week is Trackman Arch Taylor, who broke two school track records in the Carolina A.A.U. Taylor set a new mark in the 120-yard high hurdles with a time of 14.9, and in the 220-yard lows with a time of 22.4. Pete Whittle, the present track coach and intramural director, has held the records since his hurdling days at Davidson. One-man track team Taylor was the only Davidson entry at the meet, and his two firsts in the hurdles and a third in the 100-yard dash gave Davidson a fourth place in the meet. The N.C. State Wolfpack took first in the meet and will run against the Wildcat speedsters on Richardson Field next Saturday in what should prove to be the closest meet of the season for the Cats. Andrews of State will vie with Taylor for individual honors in the conflict Saturday. He has run up an average of 20 points per meet so far, participating in both the dashes and in the field events.

On another extended trip through the southern states is the varsity tennis team, having scheduled matches with North Carolina, Lenoir Rhyne, Tennessee, and Centre. Buck Archer, Mac Bruce, Craig Schmidt, Gene Sutton, and Lyman Parrigan are making the trip accompanied by Senior Manager Gus McLean. The team is sporting new jackets for this occasion and should at least be the best-dressed team if not the winners. Tod Welborn challenged Lyman Parrigan for his position on the squad last Saturday but was finally beaten in the last set. Welborn broke his racquet in the middle of the fray after each one had taken a set.

Four Teams Knotted For Inter-frat Lead

As the softball race enters the third round, teams representing Kappa Sigma, Kappa Alpha, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and Phi Gamma Delta boast clean slates.

Sigmas Win

In the initial round, the Kappa Sigmas, paced by George March, trounced the Pikas by a score of 11-5. On the following day, the Sigmas took a 9-6 decision over the A’s. With Wood limiting the Betas to six bingles, the SAE’s rolled to a 15-7 victory in their first encounter. With the Phi Delts as the opposition on the second day, the SAE’s copped their second decision by pounding out a 14-2 win. Although inactive in the second round of the tourney, the Phi Gams also have an unblemished record. Kappa Alpha, with one of the outstanding pitchers of the league in Davis Thomas, opened their season by edging out the Pi Kaps 5-3. Landing on Gene Bingham for seven runs in the first inning, the KA’s coasted in to an 8-3 win over the Pikas for their second victory.

KA vs. SAE

In the third round, the KA’s meet the SAE’s in what should be the outstanding tilt of the new season.

DAVIDSON TENNIS TEAM

'Cats Defeat Morris Field

With two victories under their belt, the Davidson baseball team set their cap for bigger game this week with the Cats invading Carolina and Duke for return engagements. Coach Norman Shepherd matched his nine against the Blue Devils in Durham Tuesday and the Cats took on the Tar Heels the following day in Chapel Hill.

Neisler Wins

With Paul Neisler going the route, the Cats won their second victory of the campaign by defeating the Morris Field nine of Charlotte by a 20 to 1 count. Neisler pitched superbly all throughout the game and, led by Ace Maloney with two home runs, jumped on the army hurlers for 20 tallies and were never in any trouble.

Lose To Wofford

In another return engagement, the Cats lost a heartbreaker to the Wofford Terriers at Spartanburg in ten innings, the score being 13 to 11. Earlier in the year, the Cats had defeated the Terriers at Davidson for their first win of the season.

Arch Taylor, with a brilliant showing in the Carolinas’ A.A.U. behind him, leads the track Cats against Mike Andrews and the N.C. State Wolfpack here Saturday afternoon in what looms as one of the closest oval encounters of the year.

Taylor Sets Records

Taylor shattered Coach Whittle’s records in the hurdles, racking up new times of 14.9 in the 120 highs and 22.4 at the 220 distance. Andrews, with an average of over 20 points in meets to date, is rated as one of the chief decathlon threats in the nation. The Brooklyn...N. Y. sophomore steps off the century in 10 seconds and under, prances an equally torrid 220, and tops it off by leading State’s weight men in the field events. Pete holds a record of three wins against a lone loss, with victories over South Carolina, Furman, and P.C., while the V.P.I. defeat is the only blot. Captain Blanton Williamson, Taylor, the Lacy brothers, Sprunt, Belk, Spencer, and all the other Wildcats appear to be in their best shape for the current season, and hopes are running high for an upset triumph over the favored Wolves. Davidson holds a season record of three wins and one loss.

People in this vicinity seem to know good value. Perhaps that’s why so many of them come in and ask to see a Hamilton. It's America’s Preferred Gift Watch.

Varsity Tennis Team Matches; New Coach

Golfers Have Tough Week

Following their long period of inactivity since their big meet in Athens, the Wildcat Golfers faced a tough schedule this week. They met the College of Charleston in Charlotte on Tuesday afternoon, and journeyed to Chapel Hill today to meet the strong University of North Carolina team, and go to Durham tomorrow to play the Champion Duke Blue Devils.

Gaither On Team

Bob Gaither became the fourth man on the team last week when he defeated Charlie Upchurch in a challenge match. Gaither shot a hot 75 to take Upchurch one up after they had played 18 holes. The team now consists of Captain Pete Cavert, Tommy Bumbarger, Frank Mebane, and Bobby Gaither.

Conference Tourney

The team will go to Winston-Salem the weekend of May 9 for the Southern Conference Tournament.

The tennis team got off Monday on another long trip. On Tuesday their first opponent was the strong Carolina team.

Five Make Trip

Wednesday they met Lenoir Rhyne’s netters followed by a match with the University of Tennessee on Thursday. Friday the Cats meet Center College in Danville, Ky. Archie, Bruce, Schmidt, Sutton, and Parrigan made the trip. The team has shown considerable improvement since the Florida trip during the holidays. Much of the improvement has been due to the activities of their new coach, Mr. C. W. Gelwick of the Myers Park Country Club in Charlotte. Mr. Gelwick is also coaching the frosh team. The Cats have been greatly handicapped by the poor home court and have had to play all their matches in Charlotte. Added to this, many schools have had to interrupt their sports schedules because of the war and tire situation. As a result, some have canceled their matches with the Davidson netmen.

DON’T QUIT COLLEGE if you are 17-19 and want to become a Naval Officer! You can serve your country best by acting on this new Navy Plan now!

YOU WANT to fight for your country. Are you willing to work for it? To toughen yourself physically? To train yourself mentally for a real job in the United States Navy? If you are, the Navy wants you to enlist now. You don’t have to quit college. You can stay in college, continue your studies to prepare for active duty in the air or on the sea. And your college will help you do it! In cooperation with the Navy, it offers all freshmen and sophomores who are seventeen and not yet twenty, special training that may win for you the coveted Wings of Gold of a Naval Aviation Officer or a commission as a Deck or Engineering Officer.

You may volunteer to become a Naval Aviation Officer. In this case, you will be permitted to finish the second calendar year of college work before you start your training to become a Flying Officer. However, at any time during this two-year period, you may have the option to take immediately the prescribed examination for Aviation Officer and, if successful, be assigned for Aviation training. Students who fail in their college courses or who withdraw from college will also have the privilege of taking the Aviation examination. Applicants who fail to qualify in this test will be ordered to active duty as Apprentice Seamen.

How to Become an Officer

To get this special Navy training, you enlist now as an Apprentice Seaman. Then you may continue in college, but you will include special courses stressing physical development, mathematics, and physics. After you successfully complete 1½ calendar years in college, you will be given a classification test.

Aviation Officers

If you qualify by this test, you may volunteer to become a Naval Aviation Officer. In this case, you will be permitted to finish the second calendar year of college work before you start your training to become a Flying Officer. However, at any time during this two-year period, you may have the option to take immediately the prescribed examination for Aviation Officer and, if successful, be assigned for Aviation training. Students who fail in their college courses or who withdraw from college will also have the privilege of taking the Aviation examination. Applicants who fail to qualify in this test will be ordered to active duty as Apprentice Seamen.

Deck or Engineering Officers

Those who qualify in the classification test and do not volunteer for Aviation will be selected for training to be Deck or Engineering Officers. In that case, you will continue your college program until you receive your bachelor’s degree, provided you maintain the established university standards. Those whose grades are not high enough to qualify them for Deck or Engineering Officer training will be permitted to finish their second calendar year of college. After this, they will be ordered to duty as Apprentice Seamen, but because of their college training, they will have a better chance for rapid advancement. At any time, if a student should fail in his college courses, he may be ordered to active duty as an Apprentice Seaman. Pay starts with active duty.
