wm THE DAVIDSONIAN, JANUARY 21, 1921.

For nearly a Century Columbia Theological Seminary has been training men for the Gospel Ministry. It is under the control
of South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, and Florida, with a membership of 89,000 communicants. Its Faculty was never more complete and
efficient than at present. Many improvements to the plant are contemplated for the near future.

Senior—“Five licks—gimme a good angle.”

THE KISS.

We wonder who the library authorities had in mind when they subscribed to “Needlecraft.” Maybe it was Cutie Mahood and
Bertha Bethea.

But So It Is.

The man must have had a crude sense of humor who first called a shampoo preparation “Cocoanut Oil.”

Tongue Tied? Florist—“Say it with flowers.” We know another sign language.

COLLEGE PROVERBS.

Many co-eds believe in making headway while the moon shines.

He fell like a fish for this good-looker,
He asked her to wed,
The pretty Vamp said,

12 yards of cloth. The collar band is size 30 and the sleeves a yard and a half long. This
is what we call a terrible shirt!
