### Completion Schedule for New Dorms Still Uncertain

By TRIPP HELMS

College officials are uncertain when the three new apartment-style dorms, originally slated for completion in August, will be ready for occupation.

The dorms, located between the golf course and the soccer fields, are in various stages of construction. C building, the one farthest from Patterson Court, is expected to be finished first. Construction on buildings A and B will be completed approximately three to five weeks after C.

One hundred and forty-four seniors were planning to live in the apartments until a letter issued from the housing office this summer informed them otherwise. The seniors have been placed in temporary housing until the new dorms are ready.

Because their dorm will be the first completed, the residents of C building have been placed in lounges and faculty and staff homes—what Director of Residence Life Tom Jennings considers the most temporary housing.

Building A is the next to be finished, and its residents are living in lounges and perimeter houses. Residents of building B have been placed in perimeter houses.

Adjustments will be made to student housing fees on a case-by-case basis, according to Jennings. Students living in faculty and staff homes will not be charged for the amount of time that they occupy their temporary housing. Perimeter house residents will be charged the double room rate.

Jennings has not set a price for those living in lounges. Because there is no phone service, and occupancy varies from two to four students per lounge, Jennings is still trying to determine what rate structure will be used.

Administration officials are meeting this week with the contractors to finalize the date of completion for dorm C, according to Jennings. Following this meeting, Jennings plans to meet with C residents Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday. The time and date will be announced by the Residence Life Office.
