#### Lecturer to reveal Michelangelo's secrets
By Jacob Abraham

Since 1959, the annual R. J. Reynolds Jr. Lecture series has brought various experts to Davidson to speak on topics relevant to their particular fields. This year, art historian Leo Steinberg will come to the Love Auditorium to speak about “The Outrageous Secrets of Michelangelo’s Famous Pieta.” Steinberg joins the ranks of such distinguished past lecturers as Arnold Toynbee, Archibald MacLeish, Paul Tillich, Dean Rusk, and Maya Angelou. The lecture is free and begins at 8 p.m., Tuesday, January 25.

Steinberg will be on campus to share his considerable knowledge as the retired holder of the Benjamin Franklin Chair in art history at the University of Pennsylvania. Born in Moscow in 1920, Steinberg has earned numerous distinctions and published several books during his career. His published work includes writings on artists such as Michelangelo (Michelangelo’s Last Paintings, 1975) and Picasso. In addition, he has written epigraphs on modern art (Other Criteria, 1972) and post-modernism. His book, The Sexuality of Christ in Renaissance Art and in Modern Oblivion (1983), gained critical acclaim for its candid treatment of controversial subject matter.

Steinberg’s past distinctions include the Frank Jewett Mather Award, the highest writing award of the College Art Association. He also became the first art historian to earn an Award in Literature from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters.

#### Turning back time to remember a classic: vinyl
By Josh Larned

Records. They’re bulky and extremely delicate. They scratch and warp easily. They skip if you so much as breathe on them. Their antiquated sound is grainy and muffled to the modern music listener. Their cardboard covers become quickly tattered when handled. They’re wonderful. They’re also making a tremendous comeback. At least they are in my mind.

With the advent of the cleaner-sounding compact disc and its solid backing by the music industry, many speculated that vinyl would go the way of the dinosaur. Indeed, although sales plummeted dramatically during the late 80s, pressing and consumer demand for records have not desisted. On the contrary, their popularity is clearly on the upswing as evident in their renewed appearance on many record store shelves. Why?

First, a number of consumers are finding that rare and hard-to-find releases simply cannot be found on compact disc. For example, many classical and jazz recordings remain unavailable in any other medium. My own grandfather was on the verge of purchasing a compact disc player last year but, upon learning that he couldn’t find any re-recorded selections by Erroll Garner (his favorite pianist), he happily saved his money and went back to spinning his RCA fully-automatic belt-drive turntable.

Furthermore, according to Ted Weiner, music director for WDAV, “There are a number of rare classical recordings which are currently being released on CD. However, there are many archives of 78 and 33 1/3 recordings which have yet to be found on CD.” In addition, vinyl offers a plethora of rare rock ‘n roll music in high demand for its unavailability, its value, and nostalgic appeal. Where else can one find an azure pressing of Elvis Presley’s Blue Hawaii or a copy of the Rolling Stones classic Sticky Fingers with a workable zipper? Did you know that the original release on 45 of Bob Dylan’s “Blowin’ in the Wind” is worth in excess of $500 in average condition? And what about those bands of our parents’ yesteryear? I certainly haven’t seen any Chuck Berry or Bill Haley and the Comets recordings on CD other than the few songs issued on some compilation. For many, vinyl offers what CDs still do not.

However, vinyl as a medium extends more worth than just a collectors’ appeal. The advent of record companies catering to a wide array of music, rather than specializing in a particular genre of music, has made it almost impossible for many talented up-and-coming bands to break it big initially, let alone afford the unfathomable price of production. Because record pressing is inexpensive and still readily available, many bands consistently turn to vinyl as a means of presenting their art. Such a fact is evident in the increased number of seven-inches (45s) placed on the market by independent record labels.

#### Bearden scholarship given for black artists
By Thomas Mew

In addition to the new Visual Arts building, some prospective art majors will have another incentive to attend Davidson. Two scholarships, each worth $10,000, have recently been established for African-American artists at Davidson. The scholarships, which will be given beginning in the fall of the 1995-96 school year, were established by Nanette Rohan Bearden, the widow of world-famous artist Romare Bearden.

Romare Bearden was known for his powerful and intense collages, one of which is owned by Davidson. The college also owns a lithograph of Bearden’s work. During his lifetime, Bearden was devoted to assisting young artists.and was instrumental in the formation of the Cinque Gallery in New York, which helped to expose young talent. In addition, he formed an organization known as the Spiral Group, which was made up of 15 African-American artists. He was also born in Mecklenburg County and spent part of his childhood here. Nanette Bearden was inspired to create the scholarships after a visit to Davidson’s new Visual Arts Center. Bearden, who is director of the Nanette Contemporary Dance Theatre, worked with art department chairman Herb Jackson to develop the scholarships. These new scholarships, coupled with the impressive Visual Arts Center, should be instrumental in attracting new art students to the college.

Screen Scene

See Philadelphia before The Piano or Heaven and Earth

By Scott McLean

Before I begin this week’s excursion into the world of cinema, let me first say that I hope everyone had a great break. If y’all were like me, you probably took in a couple of movies over vacation; maybe a light-hearted comedy or some such film that you could easily just sit back, relax, and enjoy. Knowing that a good film critic’s work is never done, I went in search of meatier films at the theaters - those potential Oscar winners that the studios always release this time of year. So, without further ado, here’s the scoop on this season’s critically acclaimed films.

The Piano, along with Schindler’s List, looks poised to be a big prize winner at this year’s Academy Awards ceremony. Writer/director Jane Campion’s tale of a mute mail-order bride in New Zealand in the late 1800s has received heaps of praise from virtually every critic in the country and star Holly Hunter is considered a virtual shoo-in for the Best Actress Oscar. Like others who have seen this flick, The Piano struck a chord in me as well; however, I think this instrument needs some fine tuning. Hunter is indeed stellar, turning in a tour-de-force performance; yet, even with her, the great supporting cast (Harvey Keitel, Sam Neill, and Anna Paquin), and the extraordinary cinematography, I found myself fidgeting throughout the whole movie. A full bladder may have had something to do with this, but quite frankly I found it difficult to feel anything but apathy for any of the characters. Maybe it was just me, but I can say without uncertainty that this is definitely an over-hyped flick, though I am sure that it will do big business with those who are curious to see what all the fuss is about.

The Piano won’t be the only film to fall into this category though. Heaven and Earth will join The Piano as a magnet for the curious, and like The Piano it also has breathtaking cinematography, though cinematography alone does not a good movie make. Eagerly anticipated as the final chapter in Oliver Stone’s Vietnam trilogy that includes Platoon and Born on the Fourth of July, this film takes a look at the war from a Vietnamese perspective. Based on the autobiography of Ly Le Hayslip, this is the story of her experiences from the French occupation of Vietnam through her immigration to the US at the end of the war. Stone has a good story to work with here and you really feel for the hardships of Ly Le and her family, but Olly really bungles it proving that the third time isn’t always a charm. The two problems I had with this film were that the actors’ accents were so thick it made it nearly impossible at first to understand what anyone was saying; secondly, Stone overdoes the suffering village girl storyline to such an extent that the entire movie seems almost like a parody. Not only do the characters constantly bicker among themselves over which one of them has suffered more, to top it off the film ends with a family reunion in Vietnam that degenerates into a “I have suffered more than you” roundtable. This renders the entire production as something like a really bad joke. Oliver, you should have stopped while you were ahead.

In case you were beginning to get the impression that every film I saw over the break sucked, there was one film that I did enjoy: Philadelphia. Oscar-winning director Jonathan Demme’s first project since Best Picture winner The Silence of the Lambs, Philadelphia is about a lawyer (Tom Hanks) who sues his firm after they fire him upon discovering he has AIDS. Demme again uses the same extreme close-up technique he employed with The Silence of the Lambs which requires great acting to pull it off successfully. He’s got plenty of that here between Hanks and Denzel Washington, who plays the lawyer Hanks hires to represent him, and a great supporting cast that includes Mary Steenburgen (Parenthood), Jason Robards, and Antonio Banderas (The Mambo Kings). This is a super film that skillfully handles a very touchy subject matter.

That wraps it up. Next time, I'll review Schindler’s List. Until then, I’ll see you at the movies!
