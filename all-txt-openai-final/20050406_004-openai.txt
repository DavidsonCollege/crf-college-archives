#### School hosts national conference

**By Liz Barry and Jackie McKeon, News Editors**

Davidson College hosted the sixth annual Chinese American Intercollegiate Conference (CAIC) last weekend. The weekend’s workshops and speakers revolved around
the theme of “Understanding the Chinese American Diaspora.” CAIC executive chair Mark Grotjohn ’05 considered the conference a success. “I
wish the turnout could have been a little larger, but I was pleased with how the conference went overall,” he
said.

Two years ago, CAIC was opened up to non-Chinese American participants. Davidson embraced the movement toward cross-cultural understanding by creating
workshops that encouraged “dialogue among all participants across ethnic and cultural backgrounds.” “The diverse student population that did show up
was a very big sign of success,” Grotjohn said.

Retired physics professor and Lt. Governor of Delaware, S.B. Woo, presented Saturday’s keynote address entitled “Asian Americans Need Group Political
Clout.” Woo previously served as a Fellow at the Institute of Politics at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard
University and the National President of the Organization of Chinese Americans. Workshops, such as “Asian-Americans and Film,” “Asian Gangs and
Violence,” and “China: The Next World Power?” took place for the rest of the afternoon.

Martin Wong, co-editor of the Asian American pop-culture magazine, “Giant Robot,” delivered the endnote address, “Ten Years of Asian American
Culture.” Wong has edited for McGraw-Hill Publishing, done freelance writing for numerous magazines, and contributed to dot-com companies. A concert
occurred during the conference. Vocalist Serra Honey opened for the Filipino alternative rock band “Titofelix” on Saturday.

Harvard University students founded the CAIC six years ago to establish an intercollegiate dialogue about Chinese American issues. Harvard, Columbia,
and Duke Universities have hosted the conference in previous years. Members of Davidson’s Asian Cultural Awareness Association and the East
Asian Studies Program helped to organize the conference.

### Automatic Suspension

“The Task Force took seriously reports from Campus Police that dangerous people are often associated with the sale of harder
drugs and their presence on campus endangers the community,” stated the Alcohol and Drug Policy Review composed by Marsicano. “It
was hoped that tougher sanctions might act as a deterrent to prevent students from experimenting with harder, more dangerous drugs.”

The current alcohol policy requires that beer be served in cups at Patterson Court parties. CCRL voted to eliminate this
requirement and allow beer to be served in cans, citing the unintended negative consequences of the current policy. The Alcohol
Policy does not address the college’s response to drunk driving offenses. CCRL supported a recommendation outlining three sanctions for a
first drunk driving offense committed on campus: notification of parents, revocation of campus driving and parking privileges, and counseling. They
propose that the second offense be handled by Campus Safety with criminal charges.

North Carolina state law indicates that for persons with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08 or higher, driving privileges are
revoked for 30 days. Any person convicted of driving while impaired may be fined a maximum of $2000, receive up
to 24 months in prison, and the DMV will revoke the defendant’s driver’s license for one year.

Chief of Police Fountain Walker emphasized that Davidson College policy does not override North Carolina state laws regarding drunk driving
and underage drinking. “Officers look at the circumstances at the time of the incident,” Walker said. “There are lots of
different charges that may apply and everything an officer would do is going to adhere to North Carolina state law.”

The remaining recommendations will be voted on at the next CCRL meeting. Issues to be addressed include the distribution of
alcohol to minors, drinking games, and risk management and party guidelines. After intensive debate, the Task Force proposed that “drinking
games be allowed on campus when played by individuals of legal age.” They support maintaining the current policy which prohibits
recognized student organizations from sponsoring drinking games.

The median class rank of those reporting rank was the top two percent, and 77 percent were ranked in the
top five percent of their high school class.School classes. The middle 50 percent of SAT scores of students admitted was
1370 to 1500; ACT scores ranged from 29 to 33. “Each year, it’s a little stronger, a little deeper, a
little more interesting. One of my favorite applicants lives on a shrimp farm in rural Guatemala with no electricity, and
we hope she'll come to Davidson,” said Wookie Payne, Director of Multicultural Admissions.

Admissions is not reporting any statistics about the number of admitted students who are minorities at this time because racial
identification is optional on the application. Sixty accepted students and 360 applicants chose not to identify with a race. “In
general, our applicant pool reflected about the same amount of ethnic diversity as last year,” Payne said. “There are lots
of things about applicants that we don’t know. It’s another reason that what we’re doing here is a whole file
review.”

Acting Dean of Admission and Financial Aid Chris Gruber agreed that it is misleading to immediately report these statistics. “Through
different types of reporting that have to take place, we learn more about students,” Gruber said. “The profile of the
students that have currently been offered admission is going to be different from the class that ultimately enrolls. Those top
students are being sought after. They’re looking at the top schools in the country.”

Now that the application process is over, it will focus on convincing the admitted students to enroll at Davidson. Decision
Davidson will be held on April 16, and admissions officers will be traveling all over the country throughout April to
recruit students for future years and encourage those admitted to enroll. Letter-writing campaigns and two online chats will occur, and
area receptions sponsored by alumni will be held for accepted students.

Scholars Weekend is scheduled for 130 scholarship candidates on the Thursday and Friday before Decision Davidson. About 15 percent of
the incoming class will be on merit scholarships, although not all of these will be awarded over Scholars Weekend. “Students
are coming that are still participating in scholarship competitions,” Gruber said. “They will have interviews and auditions and will be
going to classes and shadowing students.”

Overall, Payne stressed that the admissions process was similar to past years, although there were more applicants. “Each year it’s
a little stronger, a little deeper, a little more interesting,” Payne said of the applicant pool. “One of my favorite
applicants lives on a shrimp farm in rural Guatemala with no electricity, and we hope she’ll come to Davidson.”

Organizations, including Patterson Court eating houses and fraternities, are prohibited from “scheduling, advertising, planning or allowing drinking games or contests.”
To deter underage students from participating in drinking games, the Task Force recommends that such an infraction carry a heavier
fine than a standard alcohol violation.

The Task Force was divided on whether students of age should be permitted to play drinking games on Martin Court
porches. Questions remain about identifying who is participating in a drinking game if underage players are present and whether porches
are private or public spaces.

Finally, the Task Force has attempted to streamline the risk management policies by recommending that the rules for risk management
parties be based on “attendance rather than party type.” Organizations would be accountable for having risk managers, student ID checkers,
bartenders, and police officers based on whether a party reaches 30, 60, or 80 students. When a party reaches 30
people, the Task Force recommends the presence of a sober risk manager. Parties that reach 60 attendees would be required
to have two risk managers, an ID checker, and a bartender, and a party of 80 students or more would
require the presence of a police officer.

“The goal of the proposed change is to streamline and simplify the policy,” said Professor Fred Smith. “Safety is our
primary concern, while keeping in mind that we don’t want to make parties no fun.”

PCC President Annie Butler said many members have expressed concern over the proposed change. “While understanding the need to simplify
the rules and prevent misunderstandings, most houses feel the recommendation is an oversimplification,” she said. “It affects different sized houses
very differently as far as what they can and cannot do.” Butler plans to present PCC’s recommendation at the April
12 CCRL meeting and to Vagt.

The Alcohol and Drug Policy Review Task Force was established at the request of Dean of Students Tom Shandley. The
members included Marsicano, Walker, Professor Cindy Hauser, Smith, Kristen Higbee ’05, Katharine Hubbard ’05, Jennifer Mickle ’05, and Weston Waxweiler
’05.
