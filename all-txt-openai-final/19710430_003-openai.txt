#### Guttmacher Advocates Abortion Legalization

"I think we have a moral obligation to provide a woman with the opportunity to choose whether she wants to
give birth or not," said Dr. Alan Guttmacher, president of Planned Parenthood World Population, in a lecture in Perkins Auditorium
Tuesday night.

"For me abortion is not murder. I admit it’s something that hits you in the gut. Someone who feels it
is murder can't be persuaded otherwise," Guttmacher declared.

"And for that matter he can't change my mind," he added.

"Wherever abortion has been introduced, the birth rate has dropped dramatically. As the experience of Bulgaria and Rumania has shown,
we can manipulate the birth rate by changing the ease with which a woman can get an abortion," Guttmacher said.

Guttmacher stated that voluntarism has not been given an adequate chance to control the birth rate. "It's cheap to save
lives yet it becomes very difficult and expensive to prevent lives.

"You just don’t have the same motivation for birth control that you have for medical treatment. If a woman spits
up blood, she'll go 20 miles and take four buses to get to a doctor. Birth control can wait until
next week," he said.

According to Guttmacher, the source of the present problem is the spread of medical technology throughout the world. "Population growth
in its present form is a relatively new phenomenon. Since World War II, death rates, especially in the developing countries,
have dropped dramatically. Birth rates, however, have remained relatively stationary.

"The problem is that people reproduce geometrically, not arithmetically. Fortunately, there are 30 countries, including most of the world’s largest,
which have official policies on birth control," he said.

#### College-Owned Organ To Receive New Collars

Davidson College’s new Wicks pipe organ will have gleaming bronze collars added to about half its 3,576 pipes this summer.

Some 1,800 exposed pipes will have the new collars installed by Ralph E. Blakely Jr., a Davidson alumnus who tonally
finished the new organ, located in the Davidson College Presbyterian Church.

Martin Wick, president of the Wicks Organ Company of Highland, IL, which built the college’s instrument, is donating the slides,
valued at some $2,500, and Blakely will install them as a free service to the college.

Since the organ was completed a year ago, it has drawn many visitors, some as far away as Washington, D.C.,
and Boston, Mass.

Paul Creasman, a representative of the Wicks Company in Charlotte, calls it "one of the finest instruments within 500 miles."

It is the only organ in recent years to be designed according to the "silver tone" concepts of the Baroque
organ builder Gottfried Silbermann.

Davidson music professor Wilmer H. Welsh made the designs for the Wicks Company.

#### May Reschedule Collins

The College Social Council will have nearly 8,000 dollars extra to spend next year.

However, according to Council Chairman Duff Bruce, the excess will just cover an anticipated cut of next year's social budget.

The money was to be used in bringing folk singer Judy Collins to Davidson for Spring Frolics, held two weeks
ago.

Miss Collins cancelled all her engagements that weekend because she had strep throat, said Bruce.

In a meeting last Friday, the social council decided to save the surplus money for use next year.

"Our budget is going to be cut next year," said Bruce, "so we will use the extra money to make
up the difference. This will enable us to have the same number of programs next year as we did this
year, even though our budget will be less.

"I'm not exactly sure how much we have to hold over, but it is a major portion of the 8,000
dollars."

Bruce explained that part of the money was used during Spring Frolics.

"As soon as we knew that Judy wasn't coming, we made the carnival rides and movie free. We used a
small amount of her money to cover the cost of these activities," he said.

Bruce discounted the possibility of having Miss Collins appear at Davidson later this year.

"There would really be no sense in trying to get her back this year," said Bruce.

"We've got enough planned for the rest of this year, and there really isn't enough time left in the year
to organize another big weekend.

"With the girls’ schools graduating early, and beach season going on, we wouldn't want to bring Judy Collins down here
and risk not filling the house."

"I know all this year's seniors are disappointed, but it would be impractical to try to schedule anything big on
such short notice."

Bruce also mentioned that Miss Collins might come here next year, but he could give no details.

"We know she can't be here at Homecoming, so Midwinters would be the earliest possible date. We hope that she
will give us some special consideration next year, since she cancelled out once," said Bruce.
