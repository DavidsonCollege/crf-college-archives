INTER-INSTITUTIONAL MEMO

TO: Frontis or current occupant
FROM: Grovie
SUBJECT: Brick update

Here's the brick update you wanted. I've included some history so you can see the background of this controversy. I don’t think our collegiality quotient has suffered too much, but I do think our fast action on this issue is warranted.

- 1839—Chalmers Davidson unearthed the first request for brick pathways, written by Marshall Ney. “More brick!” he demanded in an addendum to the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence. Ney was denied when they realized the campus had no buildings to connect with walkways.

- 1919—Woodrow Wilson proposed the Twelve Bricks Plan. When the Senate refused to ratify it, Wilson shouted from Eu Hall, “Oh hell. I'm going to Princeton.”

- 1970—The campus erupted in protest over Cambodia and Kent State. ROTC drills were cancelled, three professors held a peace vigil, and campus bricks were thrown at administrative windows. This was a turbulent time in buildings and grounds.

- 1978—Building and Grounds, along with Development, Alumni Relations, and the Economics Department, revealed its revolutionary concept for the reddening of Davidson. When we finally realized the serious nature of the brick situation, we began a radical overhaul. We brought in consultants to evaluate our needs. In talking with groundsmen and the gardeners, they estimated Davidson needs at around 2,000 acres of bricks to compete with other schools of comparable size. Thus was spawned the 1,987 Program. So far we feel like all College groups have responded real well to this. Why, 58 percent of this year’s seniors have pledged one percent of their first patios toward the Program. You may have seen their symbolic brick thermometer located in the Davidsoniania room. We're very pleased.

But back to the problem. We're right at 1,200 acres (over halfway there!), but in all our planning we seem to have overlooked the maintenance aspect of this Program. Frontis, those bricks are getting dirty. The SGA Student Brick Evaluation Committee with the Subcommittee on Mortar circulated a survey; there was a student referendum protesting students having to walk on them; and 91 faculty members signed a statement.

Expressing their distaste for the whole matter. The situation has come to a critical point mudwise. Our response to this needs to be decisive, unifying, yet compassionate. Your dry cleaning idea is unfeasible at this point in time, I'm afraid. When we talked to the laundry manager, Mrs. Beaver, she said the cost would run at least four cents per brick. With 1,200 acres of bricks, she said they'd have to buy extra cleaning compound and maybe even hire a new worker. So we've decided to spray water on the bricks instead. We've been doing it all week, and we seem to be getting results. Even though only the tops of the bricks are getting clean, we think the students won't know the difference. Our only problem left is what to do with all that dirt from those bricks.
