WITH OTHER COLLEGES.

The Technique and Yellow Jacket—A call for volunteers has come to the students at Georgia Tech to enlist in the Corps of Engineers. The Secretary of War has removed all preliminary tests and formalities so that now the question of appointment rests solely on the competitive examination to be held during the week beginning June 25, 1917.

College Topics—A mass meeting was recently held at the University of Virginia which was attended by the Faculty and over 1,000 students. Resolutions were adopted pledging their support to President Wilson and their intention to install a system of military training as a means of preparedness.

The Vanderbilt Hustler—Two hundred and four students at Vanderbilt signed up for military training and definite plans are being outlined for the formation of the companies. The Co-eds are not behind in these days of preparedness, and twenty-five have signed up as Red Cross nurses and have signified their willingness to go to the front.

The Trinity Chronicle—The students at Trinity College also endorsed military training at an enthusiastic meeting, where about 300 men voted for it. The Faculty has granted their petition and an officer will be on the campus to take charge after the Easter holidays.

The Guilfordian—The second annual declamation contest for High School girls in North Carolina was recently held at Guilford College, under the auspices of the two literary societies for the Co-eds. The representative from Jamestown won the contest.

The Cadet—The world of art and his many friends mourn the death of Sir Moses Ezekiel, the noted sculptor, who died in Rome on March 7. He was a loyal alumnus of the V.M.I., graduating in 1866, a member of the famous class that fought at the battle of New Market. His statues of Virginia mourning for her dead and of “Stonewall” Jackson will remain as his monuments at the V.M.I.

Washington and Lee—Newspaper reports of recent date state that fifty of the students have organized an ambulance corps, three hundred and ninety have signified their willingness to accept the government's offer for military training in colleges and universities, and President Henry Louis Smith has made application to the government for the establishment of such a corps. There are about one hundred students who have not taken any definite course of action as yet.

TWO DEBATES TO BE HELD
(Continued from page 1)

Represented by Harley S. Garland and Florence M. Gaines, with H. Reid De Jarnette as alternate. R. W. Cousar will serve as alternate against Emory. This debate marks the close of a series of three between Emory and Davidson, the honors being equally divided so far. Emory claims the distinction of never having lost a series, and is well known for always putting out a team of excellent debaters. Against them Davidson is sending a strong aggregation, and the contest bids fair to be a close one. The Roanoke debate is the first one ever held with that institution, and though Davidson manifestly has the unpopular side of the question, her two men are sure to be heard before the decision is announced.

TWO MORE GAMES PLAYED

(Continued from page 4)

Davidson defeated Elon in the Easter Monday game at Greensboro 3 to 6. The game was close and interesting at all stages. Lawson, pitching for Davidson, kept the Elonites well in hand, allowing but four hits. Stiteler pitched good ball for Elon, but Davidson bunched hits at opportune times. The Davidson team played together well and showed much improvement. The feature of the game from the hitting standpoint was Flowers' two-bagger in the seventh inning, which drove in three runs.
