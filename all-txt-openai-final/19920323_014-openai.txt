Men's Track Begins Outdoor Slate with Florida A&M, Wake Forest Relays
By Peter Hurtado

The men's track and field team began its chase of outdoor records in promising fashion with strong meets at Florida A&M and Wake Forest this past week. Though no records have fallen yet, the men seem poised for success.

Sophomore Duncan Spears led the way for the Wildcats with lightning times in the 400m hurdles (56.6) and 400m relay split (50.5) at Florida. Duncan’s 400m hurdle time makes him the 4th fastest in Davidson history in the event. Senior Ted Richardson posted a fast 5000m time of 15:37.8 at Wake Forest. He and senior Chris Otrok seem ready to make their mark as two of Davidson’s finest mid-distance runners. Freshman Lee Sutton put the shot an outstanding 45' 2 1/2", placing him among the top ten shot putters, and less than 5 feet from the school record.

The men’s strong corps of mid-distance runners should cause several relay records to fall. Strong 800m performances by Pete Hurtado (1:58.9), Mike Grant (2:01.8), and Joe Beach (2:05.9), as well as the mid-distance efforts of senior John Alsobrook and Erik McMichael, put the 4x800, 4x1500m, and distance medley relay records in jeopardy. The 4x800 relay team of Duncan Spears, Erik McMichael, Mike Grant, and Peter Hurtado comes off a strong 3rd place performance at the Southern Conference Indoor Meet at the end of February.

Rob King began his season in the hammer throw at 87' 1/2”, his first ever attempt in the event. Freshman Will Lazenby threw the disc 101' 4" in his first collegiate meet. DJ Ruggles also posted a fine long jump of 20' 7 3/4", placing 8th overall at Wake. The men travel to the Raleigh Relays this weekend, and coaches Gary Andrew and Beth Manson are confident that the men can challenge several records.

After a successful indoor season, the women’s track and field team began their outdoor campaign with promising performances at the Florida A&M Relays last weekend and at the Wake Forest Relays this weekend.

Senior Kathy Beach continued her domination, setting a new school record of 4:43.8 in the 1500m run to place 2nd at Florida A&M. Beach also ran an outstanding 800m relay split of 2:20.2. At Wake Forest, Kathy posted a fine 3000m time of 10:16.4, only seconds away from her own school record.

Freshman Maria Whitehead set a new school record of 33' 11 1/2" in the triple jump at Wake, eclipsing her own record set at Florida the week before. Maria also posted fine times in the 400m (63.3) and the 400m hurdles (70.7).

The mid-distance corps of Carolyn Meadows (11:11), Jean DeMoss (11:24), and Lisa Sitek (11:29) started the outdoor season with excellent times in the 3000m run. DeMoss also ran an outstanding 1500m at 5:21.9, and looks to break 5:00 this spring. Sitek’s 5000m time of 20:15 is also a great start for the season.

Heather Tarpley placed 5th at Wake Forest with a discus throw of 122' 9". Heather, the squad’s most versatile athlete, also ran well in the 400m and 400m hurdles. Finally, the distance medley relay team of Beach, Tarpley, DeMoss, and Meadows placed first overall at Florida A&M with a time of 13:14.6.The women travel to Raleigh Relays next weekend, and look ahead to the Southern Conference Championship at Marshall. A Reminder From the Davidson Compliance Office: The Student-Athlete's Role in the Recruiting Process (From the NCAA Recruiting Guide)

“Student-athletes who are currently enrolled at your institution can play a role in the recruiting process. For example, they may host prospects during their official visits to campus, and they can write letters to prospects after September 1, at the beginning of the prospects’ junior year in high school.

“Student-athletes cannot recruit off campus at the direction of a coach, and they cannot be given expense money for recruiting except in connection with their role as student hosts. They may come into contact with prospects off campus, so long as the contacts are incidental and not directed by a member of the coaching staff for recruiting purposes. [Bylaws 13.1.2.3-(e)-(1) and 13.1.2.8]

“Student-athletes may receive telephone calls from prospects after July 1, following the prospects’ junior year in high school, so long as the calls were made at the prospects’ expense. The rules about student-athletes making telephone calls vary between divisions. Student-athletes cannot make telephone calls to prospects if the calls are made at the direction of a coaching staff member or financed by your institution or its boosters. In Division I, student-athletes cannot make recruiting calls that are part of a regular admissions program. [Bylaw 13.1.2.3-(e)-(1)]”

Oddo is realistic about the chances of competing with scholarship teams. “We’re heading toward the level of being competitive,” he says, “but it’s going to take us several years to compete with the Division I scholarship programs.” Oddo’s goal for now is to capture some individual Southern Conference champions; he points out Knowles, Fierro, Stewart, and freshman Giorgio Hiatt (142) as potential candidates. “That’s attainable,” he says.
