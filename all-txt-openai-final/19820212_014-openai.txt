**Muscle Men**

Reaching in

the muscle men break away my crown

tearing at my hair

pulling free the outer shell

their dark stone anger caves me in

and runs ahi aes

Sifting fingers s own

to aun themselves grudgingly to my base

- filling my groin with curling spikes of pain

my bowels are undone and replaced with biting rain

caustic churning finality:

my ribs are snapped off,

bent backwards then up

tearing one then another splintering

and throws into my eye socket

to pry away my bony mask

and release the burning bird wing gasp

my breath of soul

air. the wind

**TWO DEVILS**

“Braggart!”

My three crowning spines glow sul

Ashly white

Frost-stricken from those

Holes bored in the clouds of AcKeron

(Blazed goldblack friction).

Suspended by the thin red tubes which

Keep me alive;

I am Belial,

The slothful poet in the pit of Babel

—Inverted tower/Well of Souls—

(Walls of Sounds)

Frozen glass curtains stained

From the chaos of despair as souls

Beg for the quench of the Lethe—

I spring alert frowning.

Toes glinted contracted

(Grasp the writhing whip of scorpions).

Sound the alarm in a sputter of moth wings.

I am also Moloch,

The carnal gross warmonger

Pimp of youth and ideas

Of chortled replies and incoherent filth.

Our Angels wings

Like silver acetylene afterbirth

Shredded by our frantic Maenads

Of pride and hedonistic self-satisfaction.

We are of ourselves

Fleeting black sunpricks

Growing larger and

Sprouting light-fed tattoos.

Mirror to mirror progression

Amidst the rudimentary jostlings of

Free Will.
