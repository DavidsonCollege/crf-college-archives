An Order to the Moon

Big dull yellowish-white round spots of clock
Made moons to me off of their four-sided
hollow-eyed
steeple-bearer
It spired upward

To be blockaded by the overcast shadow of sky
big dull yellowish-white round moons

Spider-webbed by branches they imitated
The hidden cause of the highlighted clouds
Somewhere and above

speckled white

pure round

Domineering their church pointed up black
between trees and the seemingly endless
period of time
Pointed blacker than the sky
Vertex cross turned to vapor when
attempting to give an order to the
moon pure moon

big dull yellowish-white round order

The next morning I woke and
Found myself ashamed
