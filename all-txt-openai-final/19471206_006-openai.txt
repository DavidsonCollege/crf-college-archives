Page Six THE DAVIDSONIAN

Miss Cochran Is Chapel Speaker

Miss Cochran graduated this past Tuesday from Smith College, Massachusetts, and is now secretary for the Student Volunteer Movement for Christian Missions. Miss Cochran is acquainted with missions as she has been with her parents who are missionaries in Asia throughout the world. Near and Far East missions are spread throughout Europe. This movement is particularly active in the Far East, but since then the various nations have seen non-denominational missions.

FACES GREAT TEST... (Continued From Page One)

One of the greatest opportunities in history for Christians and non-Christians alike is held by the leadership of the Y.M.C.A. Membership in the Y.M.C.A. is growing, with a wider interest today than at any other time in the past. Leadership, tested by the war and with broad experience due to work in foreign countries, combined with loyalty to the association on the part of both secretaries and Christian laymen, government and educational officials, and non-Christian leaders, makes the association one of the most significant lay groups engaged in the restoration of Japan.

The Japanese Y.M.C.A. is meeting the challenge with an intensive program for students. Student associations have sprung up anew in more than 100 colleges and universities. The first postwar national student conference held last September in Tokyo drew 165 delegates instead of the 90 expected. Students came from all over the country. One student stood for two days and nights on a train so jammed he sometimes had difficulty putting both feet down at the same time. They paid their own way and brought enough money and food to last the whole conference week. Other Y-sponsored conferences fared well, too. In the physical education field, 845 teachers attended institutes in five cities. The story of the secretaries and staff is one of courage and devotion. All have stuck to their jobs despite outside offers of salaries many times what the "Y" is able to pay. It is the conviction of Russell Durgin, director of youth activities under Gen. MacArthur and past leader of the Y.M.C.A. in Japan, that the former military leaders are discredited in the eyes of youth. Also, that most young people are open-minded and eager to find the "new democratic way." Christianity, they feel, is worth studying and democracy is the ideal. The "Y" is...

These kindergarten children, shown here with their parents, used to attend school at the Sendai Y.M.C.A. before it was destroyed.

A hundred dollars which the Tuesday evening volunteer cotton pickers raised assembled a 25-piece Davidson College Concert marching band. Later, when he came to Davidson as Director of the Music Department, Mr. Pfohl reorganized the band into two sections. The Davidson Concert Band has been a guest at North Carolina College, Pinehurst College, and Greensboro College. The band opened the Mt. Airy Civic Concert Series with a concert in Mt. Airy on Friday evening, December 5. The Davidson concert will be the only home appearance of the band this semester. Dr. A.A. Harding, past president of the American Bandmasters Association, said, "The Davidson College Band has made a reputation earned by excellent performances over a period of years."

---has stated that it is the most rapid strides of any col- feweinusical organization in the country during recent years. It is unusual for a violinist to perform with a concert band, but Mr. Sipe’s talent makes the combination particularly effective. This group traces its roots back to Davidson. Mr. Sipe, a talented student, plays with the Davidson Symphonic Band, Symphony Orchestra, and the Queens-Davidson Orchestra.
