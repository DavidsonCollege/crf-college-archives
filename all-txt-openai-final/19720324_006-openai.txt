Some inner-city ghettos have special schools for little boys who don’t talk.

Not mute little boys, but children so withdrawn, so afraid of failure, they cannot make the slightest attempt to do anything at which they might fail.

Some don’t talk. Some don’t listen. Most don’t behave. And all of them don’t learn.

One day someone asked us to help.

Through Kodak, cameras and film were distributed to teachers. The teachers gave the cameras to the kids and told them to take pictures.

And then the miracle. Little boys who had never said anything looked at the pictures and began to talk. They said, “This is my house.” “This is my dog.” “This is where I like to hide.” They began to explain, to describe, to communicate. And once the channels of communication had been opened, they began to learn.

We're helping the children of the inner-city. And we're also helping the adults. We're involved in inner-city job programs to train unskilled people in useful jobs.

What does Kodak stand to gain from this? Well, we're showing how our products can help a teacher—and maybe creating a whole new market. And we're also cultivating young customers who will someday buy their own cameras and film. But more than that, we're cultivating alert, educated citizens who will someday be responsible for our society.

After all, our business depends on our society. So we care.
