J.O.) also returns and should improve with more time as a starter. Jim Stanfill (9.85, 3, 28.3) posted Davidson’s second
highest win total last season and was used mostly in middle relief. The added starts should help him improve over
the course of the season.

The Wildcat mainstay in the bullpen the past two seasons has been Brad Wanzenberg (3.21, 1, 28). His five saves
in '89 led the team for the second consecutive year. In '88 he placed third among NCAA Division I relievers
with 11 saves. With more save opportunities, Wanzenberg should return to double digits. Middle relief is where the Wildcats have
had their biggest problems as opponents enjoyed scoring two of the three highest run totals in the seventh and eighth
innings against the Cats.

The rest of the pitching squad will be vying for these spots as well as occasional starting duty. They include
freshmen Lenny McAlister, Randy Spaw, and Andy Paul as well as junior David Williams (8.84, 1, 36.7).

“I think there is a bumblebee,
Sitting on my left knee.
I hope it doesn’t sting me.”
