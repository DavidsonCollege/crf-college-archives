@ the davidsonian December 3, 1976

As I lay dying,
softly crying,

never ever sighing,
my soul was lying
from fear of flying:
what use trying

to go on plying

the trade of denying
or just implying;

we can continue slying
the family stone.

Veneer

Walking through High Point
the last time I was in N.C.
the factory drew me in.

Chippendale, Early American
Art Deco and Louis XIV.
What other periods
and names can I drop?

I stop transfixed.
A love chest—Mahogany—
and
—Veneer.

The roses in Jackson Court
were lovely.

On my knees, I groveled

in your earth, dear God,
and rejoiced.

Ode to a Greaser

Leaden windows staring in,
drenched with vain morbidity

concealing the crushed flowers
of a never-was Pepperland.
Who, what, where, when, why;
empty hours turning into
years,
years,
years.

down the middle, an end-around

in the game plan of God’s grace.
Tides of agape breaking on the shore
of a hubris circumscribed by

Full of naught I wander on, parting the vale of tears

This is my rock and roll love letter
to you

This is my rock and roll love letter
to you
Gonna sign it, gonna seal it, gonna send it away
Gonna send it today.
