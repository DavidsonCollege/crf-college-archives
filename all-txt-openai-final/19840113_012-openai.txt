The arrival of 1984 brings all manner of interesting possibilities for our own Davidson College. The Davidsonian, in conjunction with the editors of a noted publication located in Lantana, Florida (it rhymes with Inspirer), has gained access to the inside line on what’s ahead for '84 here at Davidson. With enthusiasm and the assurance that the future is as easy to see as the gunk in the corners of Chambers bathrooms, we present these absolutely true predictions.

* * *

With so many young lovebirds swapping rings and ringing those wedding bells these days, the College will replace the Humanities program with an interdisciplinary look at home engineering. “Who needs Plato when there’re dishes to be done?” one coed will exclaim.

* * *

Princeton has Brooke, and Yale has Jodie, but Davidson will score an admissions coup this spring when funk star Prince accepts the prestigious Stuart Scholarship. His reason for leaving behind lucrative record contracts and scantily clad young women? “All I wanna do is dance, play music, sex, romance. Try my best to never get bored,” he will croon. Prince will express interest in becoming a hall counselor, but first he’ll join the Women’s Concerns Committee and the Peace Coalition.

* * *

The new athletic facility will be finished surprisingly early next October, just in time for the 1984 Midnight Madness. The Hattie Johnston Gym (what used to be called the Peregrine House Restaurant) will be located between the laundry and the security hut. “The Presidential Search cost a lot,” Trustee Fred Stair will explain in reference to the facility’s diminished size.

* * *

The long-lost son of Chalmers Davidson will appear in the Davidsoniana room next August, claiming to be the College’s one and only true archivist. The son, calling himself Peter Stuart Ney, will challenge his alleged father to a trivia tournament about Davidson history. Chalmers will naturally say nay to the pretender, and Ney will say “Chalmers” back.

* * *

A huge swarm of pileated woodpeckers will roost in the Chambers dome, messing up the bells and forcing the College to spend millions on bird food and disinfectant. “What was killed was eaten,” Captain Hughes will exclaim.

* * *

A whirling dervish will descend from above and annihilate the Philanthropic Hall, while leaving the rest of the campus intact. “Gosh, it’s a shame,” Davidson’s 21st Rhodes Scholar, SGA President, AI Coordinator, Sig Ep member, PUG member, Jazz Ensemble member, hall counselor emeritus, and Phi Society member Hunter Monroe will say.

* * *

When the entire class of ’88 vanishes in the Freshman Regatta, a search will ensue. The Biology department will blame “Normy,” a monster they claim closely resembles the dreaded Loch Ness monster.
