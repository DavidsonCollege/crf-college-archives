Women avenge early season loss to Eagles, grab fourth place with win

Carolyn Kirsch scored a game-high 22 points to lead Davidson (14-8, 6-5) over Ga. Southern (11-12, 5-6) Saturday in Statesboro,
Ga., 75-62. The win gave the Wildcats fourteen for the season, tying the all-time program high set by last year’s
squad. Davidson will look to break that record Monday at Tenn.-Chattanooga. The win over the Eagles avenged an earlier 66-63
defeat at Belk Arena in January. The Wildcats now stand a game ahead of Ga. Southern for fourth place in
the conference.

CK, Scooch, Mo leave winning legacy

By MICHAEL Kruse
Sports Editor

It’s about 20 minutes after the women’s basketball team’s win over Western Carolina last Monday. There are two girls playing
on the near hoop in Belk Arena. One looks to be 10 or 11, the other a couple years younger.
The older one is wearing a t-shirt that reads, It’s a man’s game...Not! She dribbles around the perimeter, looking to
pass to an imaginary teammate.

“CK, CK, CK,” the younger one yells from the other side of the court, calling for the ball. I take
note. CK. Carolyn Kirsch, of course.

“What’s your name?” I ask the girl with the t-shirt. It’s Marilyn or Melody or Harmony or something like that.
But it’s not CK.

“Who’s your favorite player?” I ask, knowing full well what the answer will be.

“CK,” she says with a smile and in an of-course tone.

Carolyn Kirsch and fellow seniors Monica Winter and Amy Scalcucci will play their final regular season game in Belk Arena
Saturday against Marshall. Along with last year’s class, the trio has spearheaded the remarkable ascension of Wildcat women’s basketball over
the past four years in the Southern Conference, willing the squad from perennial cellar-dweller into legitimate title threat.

The mere fact that there is a little girl running around the Belk Arena floor pretending to be CK, that
area youth girls basketball leaguers come to all the home games, that they scurry down to the locker room after
them - pen and program in hand - looking for autographs, all of this is real-life proof of just what
this class has done for this team.

After suffering through five- and four-win seasons in 1992-93 and 1993-94, the Wildcats won a program-best 14 games last year
and advanced to the league semifinals in Greensboro. The goal for this season - and a realistic one - goes
beyond the semis. And Kirsch, Winter, and Scalcucci were at the heart of this remarkable emergence, a building block progression
to recognition and respect.

“This group of seniors has given the program real credibility here on campus and in the conference,” said coach John
Filar earlier this month. “They’ve shown the younger ladies what kind of commitmentIt really takes to be Division I athletes.”
Winter, earlier this season, became the program’s all-time assists leader and Scalcucci will leave Davidson as one of its best
three-point markswomen ever. Kirsch, who dominated the European continent at an American high school in Heidelberg, Germany, earning All-Europe hoops
honors three times and, between basketball, soccer, and volleyball, capturing eight European championships overall, was selected second team all-league last
year and is a virtual lock for first team this season and a very tenable Player-of-the-Year candidate. “I couldn’t be
happier with the program,” Kirsch said recently. “This is my favorite team over the last four years. I think the
coaching staff has its stuff together and I’m just really happy overall. I couldn’t ask to end my career at
Davidson any better.” If they don’t yet, the record books will soon say that Kirsch is the finest all-around women’s
basketball player in Davidson history. She is the program’s all-time leader in rebounds, steals, and free throws, and will likely
become its most prolific scorer tonight at UTC. “As of right now, there’s no doubt. She’s by far the best
women’s basketball player ever to pass through here,” said Filar. “I hope one day - and I hope it’s soon
- they’ll retire No. 14. I don’t think anyone else could wear No. 14 quite like Carolyn Kirsch.” Indeed. She
has left an indelible mark of success on women’s basketball at Davidson - as a bubbly personality on and off
the court, as a player unmatched in talent and production in the program’s annals, and as perhaps the driving force
behind the creation of a Wildcat team on which winning is not simply a dream, but an expectation and a
reality. For anyone ever again to even have the opportunity to wear No. 14 would be an injustice. Even so,
Kirsch will likely end her competitive basketball career at the conclusion of this season, opting to continue her education rather
than play professionally. She is a Psychology major and has applied to six grad schools. “I’m ready to live a
life without competing,” said Kirsch. “As it gets closer and closer, I’m so scared to have a life without basketball.
I guess I want people to remember me as somebody who really had a passion for the game.” She stumbles
a little, then thinks for a few seconds. “I just want them to remember me.” Well, the little girl with
the t-shirt sure will. And chances are, she won’t be the only one.

Records to fall this week
By AARON DUNHAM
Staff Writer

The two most important Davidson women’s basketball records could fall this week. First, with just one more victory, the 1996-97
Wildcats would become the all-time winningest team in the history of the program. That milestone will represent quite an accomplishment
for head coach John Filar, who resurrected the formerly defunct program just five short years ago. Secondly, senior standout Carolyn
Kirsch will likely become the school’s career scoring queen tonight in Chattanooga, Tenn. With her 22-point performance Saturday against Ga.
Southern, Kirsch now has 1293 career points, just six points shy of Mike Frankhouser’s mark.

Our Own Crazies

The Davidsonian sports section has been very critical of the poor fan attendance at Davidson basketball games in recent weeks.
And although we are still disappointed by the number of fans showing up at Belk Arena, we must give some
credit to a particular group of students who do. The Phi Delts have been extremely vocal during the women’s games
this season, firmly establishing themselves as Davidson's “Cameron Crazies.” Most often perched behind the visiting team’s bench, they not only
support the Wildcats and harass the opponents, but also have a firm knowledge of the game. Before the Western Carolina
contest, one Phi Delt brother walked into the press room to ask if he could borrow some chairs. The bunch
wanted to hold up chairs throughout the game to mock Catamounts coach Gary Peters, who was suspended for the game
because of a chair-throwing incident.
