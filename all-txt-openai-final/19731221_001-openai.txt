The Vol. LXIII, No. Twelve

By MARK DEATON
Managing Editor

The North Carolina Alcoholic Beverage Control Board informed the college Thursday that present practices of dispensing beer in the Union
were illegal. State agents, in a meeting with College President Samuel R. Spencer Jr. and Director of the Student Union
C. Shaw Smith, indicated that the college was in violation of state law through its current practices of providing free
beer in the Rathskeller of the College Union. Because Davidson does not have a license to sell beer, the contribution
system in the Union bar, where students are encouraged to make a contribution for the free beer, is prohibited by
law.

Two ABC Board agents, having heard in Charlotte that beer was obtainable at the Davidson College Union, entered the Rathskeller
about 9:30 p.m. on November 16. After having bought two cups of beer, they asked how much they should contribute.
The bartender indicated that 15¢ would be an adequate contribution. Having this exchange of money over the bar in return
for "free beer" convinced the agents that Davidson was in violation of the law. The Schlitz clocks behind the bar,
a gift from a distributor, led them to believe that the Union was not getting beer from authorized retailers, but
direct from the distributor. This, they explained, is illegal.

"We will comply immediately with what the ABC Board says, and we trust that fraternities will do the same," said
Spencer. "They warned us that we were unwittingly in violation of the law. They were very nice to Davidson, but
they are obviously interested in seeing that the law is enforced properly."

Assistant Director of the College Union Duff Bruce indicated that several changes in policy would be necessary to ensure compliance
with the law. "If a fraternity had free beer for a party, but charged for students to hear the band,
they would be in violation of the law," Bruce explained. "When you have free beer, you have to let everyone
in. For example, a freshman hall or eating house will not be able to keep anyone out." Neither students nor
townspeople could be excluded from such an event, making the college liable to check for identifications to establish the drinking
age of the people involved. In addition, brown-bagging would have to be more closely supervised, ensuring that those who checked
liquor were over the 21 age limit.

"We want to be very sure we're not in danger of violating the law. It is not worth the damage
to the reputation of the college to be slack in our responsibilities where alcohol is involved," said Bruce. Bruce expressed
hope for obtaining a license to sell beer in the future. "If the Trustees give us the right to seek
a beer license, I think it would simplify things," he said. "We're not trying to make beer a business here.
If we did get a license it would not be a matter of us making money from the sale of
beer." Spencer did not advocate seeking a license at this time.

Rhodes Scholar

Davidson College Senior Pete Kyle of Lubbock, Tex. has won a Rhodes Scholarship for two years of study at the
University of Oxford, England. The Rhodes award, the 18th won by a Davidson student, is considered the most prestigious scholarship
for graduate study available to American college students. It pays virtually all expenses for two years at Oxford. Kyle plans
to work toward a degree in mathematics and logic.

Kyle won his scholarship at the Gulf States district competition in New Orleans. Another Davidson senior, John M. Douglas Jr.
of Charlotte, was a North Carolina finalist but did not win in Southern district competition in Atlanta. Kyle has achieved
a near-4.00 average while at Davidson and has run cross-country and track for the college. During his junior year at
the University of Marburg, Germany, Kyle was named an assistant to his mathematics professor, a responsibility usually reserved for graduate
students. In the 1972-73 national Putnam Mathematical Competition, he ranked among the top three students in the South. He is
also active in the Episcopal Church.

On a motion passed through the Faculty Executive Committee last week, classes after the Christmas break will resume on Tuesday,
Jan. 8 and the following Saturday, Jan. 12 will be observed as a class day. Classes after the winter break
will resume on Tuesday, March 5 and Saturday, March 9 will be a class day.

RECRUITMENT PUSH

This year's basketball recruiting expenses are being increased with no official ceiling. TheResults of the recruitment program will determine the
scope of Davidson basketball in the future.

**Basketball Program Allotted Increased Recruiting Funds**

By GORDON WIDENHOUSE

(Ed Note: This is the first in a series of articles regarding the future status of basketball at Davidson College.
The series will focus on the recruitment aspect of Wildcat basketball. The following installment deals with the College’s present policy
regarding recruiting.)

With the recent decision by the Board of Trustees of Davidson College to restructure the athletic policies of the institution,
there has been an increased emphasis on the future of the basketball program here. One of the most important factors
in maintaining a top-level program in this sport is recruiting. Thus, the recruiting element of the program is now undergoing
a transitional period.

College President Samuel Spencer sketched the principles which will dictate the college’s policy towards recruiting in the coming year. “It
would really have to be classified as an experimental year,” Spencer stated. “What will be done in the future will
depend on the events of this year as far as recruiting players is concerned.”

The trustee policy regarding the basketball program has been stated as being very concerned and dedicated to maintaining a program
of national prominence with particular emphasis on establishing the team with a top-twenty ranking in the national polls. Spencer was
quick to affirm the determination and support of the Trustees and the administration in their allegiance to this type of
program. “Everyone is behind keeping our basketball program at the top of the Southern Conference and continuing to provide the
financial and material support for a nationally prominent program here,” he asserted.

He also pointed out that there would be a key meeting on Jan. 9 to discuss the recruiting policy of
the college for the basketball program. At this meeting will be trustee and administration officials, as well as the coaches
and other athletic personnel. “This meeting will be the determination of a set policy for the coming year as far
as recruiting is concerned. As yet, there is no established guideline as far as the recruiting budget goes for 1973-74.”

The preliminary policy, which has not met the final approval of the necessary constituencies, would give the program “unlimited financial
resources, within reason,” to recruit the best possible talent for future basketball at Davidson. Spencer emphasized the qualification “within reason.”
“It’s very important that we remember to keep the expenditures within reason,” he explained.

**Slater To Implement Price Hikes**

By BRUCE CORSER
Managing Editor

Ron Scott, Director of ARA Slater Food Service, has indicated that he will enact a series of proposed alterations in
the Davidson Dining Service in order to offset inflationary food prices and the energy crisis. The revisions, to become effective
immediately following the Christmas recess, are expected to compensate for a 22 percent increase in wholesale food costs since September
1973.

Desserts, vegetable and potato items, and breakfast foods such as omelets, bacon, sausage, and toast will cost more upon students’
return in January. In addition, there will be an extra charge for each refill of punch, Pepsi, Teem, Mountain Dew,
and milk. However, this elimination of the “no limit” refill policy doesn't include coffee or tea. Also, the price of
milk is to be hiked to 20 cents per glass, up from 15 cents.

Scott revealed that henceforth Bailey House will close on Saturday, except during special weekends when business will merit opening. During
weekdays, the price of a complete dinner at Bailey will be raised 10 cents. The dinner will still include one
each of salad, vegetable, potato, roll, and oleo pattie, though this increase will not affect the special line sandwich prices
featured at lunch in Bailey, Scott noted.

Until now, Slater has been experiencing a 5-6 percent increase over projected food costs. The upcoming increases should adequately compensate
for the deficit. Scott has been reluctant to make these changes and said that he had been “holding off to
see how far we could go with current prices.” “Because of our size,” he continued, “the operation here at Davidson
is readily affected by inflation.”

However, Scott emphasized that any profit made above the budgeted profit margin would be passed along to students in larger
helpings of food or increased service. “We will also be making some changes in our menu by replacing unpopular items
and increasing menu variety,” he added. Indicating some concern for student tastes, Scott concluded, “We try to satisfy students the
best we can with the amount of money we are receiving.”
