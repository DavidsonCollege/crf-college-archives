Scraps of plans and puzzles, a-sent and read

she’d never dreamed of Boston, or of settling down to stay

the scraps of plans and puzzles had been left for other days

white linen and a garden never seemed so close at hand.
——with the easiest solution of giving someone else command. —

the wine in other mountains, and songs in other tongues

were too painful to imagine for a heart not always strong

and lonely thoughts of empty in the houses and the nights

made her wonder if the feeling free was really worth the fight.

you can only bend a habit; try to hide from what you need.

So she sits before the mirror, waiting for some sweet reprieve.

the current moves so swiftly, and we always linger slow

piecing scraps and bits together that might tell us what to know.

but if you see her in Boston, with a fireplace and some trees,

if the edges all seem smoother, and she finds her mind at ease,

wish her stars and yellow apples, and a soft piano chord,

with the hope that any puzzle will be answered in reward.
