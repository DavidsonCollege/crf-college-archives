The Davidson College Union has several projects that should add a new dimension to the Davidson social scene. These range
from a big show for Homecoming to a renovated basement of the College Union. President Joe Earle stated, “We have
a lot of good ideas for Homecoming, but there are still some contracts to be settled.” He added that one
of the acts would be “The Proposition,” a comedy team similar to “The Ace Trucking Company,” but with a different
style. Earle stated that the Homecoming concert would be “Muddy Waters.” He added that Ellen Kearney is performing in the
Union this Saturday.

“The Union has two parts to its program. These are the social and the co-curricular.” The main social event now
is the facilities offered by the new bar. Earle stated that “the bar this year is being radically altered in
the interest of providing the students a place for Rest and Relaxation.” Chairman of the Union Bar Lenny Vincent said
that the bar is being redesigned to better serve the students.

refused to give its approval for the Davidson program. They also terminated a number of programs that had already been
in operation, such as those conducted by Carleton College and Wooster College.
