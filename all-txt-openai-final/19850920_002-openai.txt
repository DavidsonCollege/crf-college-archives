Alumni Office Trains Admissions Recruiters

Last weekend the Davidson Alumni Office held the Annual Alumni Leadership Conference. The Conference trains leaders in the Davidson Alumni Admissions Program (DAAP) and the Annual Fund which includes the Living Endowment, the Wildcat Club, and WDAV. Approximately 150 alumni came to Davidson for the program. One of the program’s main aims is to train members of the 34 DAAP teams across the country responsible for helping identify and recruit “able and outstanding” students for Davidson. President Kuykendall and Ben Craig, Chairman of the Board of Trustees, both addressed the group.

Davidson Cadet Graduates Top Of His Class

Senior history major Andrew Myers graduated top ROTC cadet out of 62 participants in the U.S. Army Ranger Course at Fort Benning, Ga. He competed among 210 ROTC cadets from across the U.S. to participate in the course. Of the 210 cadets, 62 were selected to participate and only 36 graduated. In the two-month Ranger course, ROTC cadets, U.S. Military Academy cadets, Army officers, and selected enlisted personnel undergo rigorous training with limited sleep and food in mountains near Dahlonega, Ga.; in the desert at Dugway Proving Grounds, Utah; and in a swamp environment at Eglin Air Force Base, Fla. Participants begin the course with 19 days of physical, leadership, land navigation, and demolitions training at Fort Benning. Among other skills, the course develops leadership and decision-making abilities under conditions of stress. Training averages 19 hours daily during the 58-day course. After graduating from Davidson College next spring, Myers will be commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army.

Ambassador To Address South African Policies

Ambassador to Somalia Peter Bridges will speak on U.S. policy toward South Africa at Davidson Sept. 23. He is in the United States as one of a number of ambassadors to African nations sent across America by President Ronald Reagan to discuss his administration’s views and policy on South African apartheid. Ambassador Bridges will make a public address at 7:30 pm Monday in the 900 Room. A career Foreign Service Officer, Ambassador Bridges was called back to Washington from his post for a recent Chiefs of Mission conference to discuss developments in southern Africa and the administration’s response to them. At Davidson, Ambassador Bridges will speak on that conference's results in addition to U.S. policy toward Africa as a whole. He comes to Davidson under the auspices of the Dean Rusk Program in International Studies. Ambassador Jack Perry, director of the Rusk Program, said, “Peter Bridges is one of the outstanding American career diplomats. We are particularly glad to welcome him to Davidson, where student interest in South African developments is running high. He will make a solid contribution, I am sure, to our year-long consideration of complex South African issues.” A native of Louisiana, Ambassador...Bridges is a graduate of Dartmouth College. He is one of the Foreign Service’s leading experts on Italy, having served two tours there. In his last tour there, 1981-84, he was Deputy Chief of Mission at the US Embassy in Rome. He is also known as a Soviet and East European specialist, with tours in Moscow and Prague. He has served in Panama, has worked in the State Department on United Nations affairs, and has been Ambassador to Somalia since Jan. 1985. Ambassador Bridges’ speech at Davidson is open to the public at no charge.

Mahoney Leads Student Group In India

Assistant professor of religion William Mahony is leading a group of 18 students to India this fall in his fourth visit to that country. He was in the country in 1971 and 1972, when war broke out between India and Pakistan, and in 1984, when Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated. Mahony has seen changes in India in the last 14 years, and he now sees the country as an emerging, capable, and confident nation. Public health has improved, and there are more political parties, better technology, a more even-keeled relationship with the United States, and more Indian home industries, Mahony said recently.

“In a lot of ways we all share the same hopes and aspirations,” Mahony said. “India is the world’s largest democracy, and it’s a secular democracy. Indians stress family and education. We all need our health, we all hope for the health of our loved ones.

“I think a lot of times Americans are not sensitive to these similarities and we tend to think of other people as ‘other,’ that is, different from us, and when you start separating people like that, you invite dangerous misunderstanding.”

Mahony expects his students to realize that, culturally, India is more a continent than a country. India has more than 300 languages. Many groups of various ethnic, racial, class, linguistic, and religious backgrounds are bound politically, but are extremely different culturally. When questioned about his aims for the program, Mahony said he wanted his students to learn something about the similarities and differences between India and the United States.

Students will live on a college campus near Madras in southern India for the first five weeks of the 10-week term. They will examine archaeological monuments, farming villages, health care centers, and game preserves. In the other five weeks, students will be on tour, looking at similar sites in central and northern India. They will stay in state-run bungalows — similar to hostels — when they travel. After the term ends Nov. 11, students have time to tour individually and return to Davidson for winter term.

Mahony will teach three academic courses for Davidson College credit — the history and culture of India, an introduction to the Tamil language, and an independent studies project. His wife Pamela is accompanying the group.

Term-in-India demonstrates Davidson College’s commitment to international awareness and its traditional emphasis on South Asian studies, Mahony said. Sixteen Davidson students and two students from other schools in the South Atlantic States Association of South Asian and African Studies are participating.

Mahony is a MacArthur assistant professor of religion. He is assistant editor of The International Encyclopedia of Religion and has served as an editorial consultant and contributor to Encyclopedia Britannica. A 1973 graduate of Williams College, Mahony earned the master of divinity degree from Yale and received his PhD from the divinity school of the University of Chicago.
