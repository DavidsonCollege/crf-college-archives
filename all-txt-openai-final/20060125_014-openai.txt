14 THE DAVIDSONIAN

By MIKE CHAPMAN

The month of January has been a busy one for the Davidson wrestling team, which has competed in six matches
in a mere nine days. Unfortunately for the ’Cats, only one victory emerged during this mid-winter stretch. This 39-9 victory
occurred versus Belmont Abbey, one of two squads competing in a tri-meet here on Jan. 14. The ’Cats lost a
close match to Gardner-Webb in their opening dual, but managed to take the first six bouts from Belmont Abbey later
that night, gaining a 32-0 lead that they never surrendered.

Co-captain Matt Leonard ’06 (149 lbs) opened the dual in winning style by pinning his opponent in under three minutes,
while Patrick Coman ’06 (125 lbs) and Jim Avola ’07 (141 lbs) shut the door on the Crusaders with victories
of 4-0 and 8-0, respectively.

“We wrestled well against Gardner-Webb and Belmont Abbey,” said Coman. “Jimmy Colavita [’09] looked good stepping in for Trebor Clavette
[’08], and if [Matt Pendle ’08] wasn’t injured we would’ve had a great chance at beating Gardner-Webb.”

The following Wednesday, the Davidson wrestlers headed to Lexington, Va., for a match against VMI. This competition was the second
league match for the ’Cats. Pendle, back from injury and losing with less than a minute to go, surprised no
one when he gave the ’Cats their first lead with a pin in the 157-pound bout. A year ago, Pendle
set the single-season record for pins, racking up an astounding 14 victories by pin as a freshman. The ’Cats retained
the lead when Marcus Boyd ’07 earned a 23-17 shoot-out victory in the 174-pound weight class, and Sam O’Hair ’09
bumped up one weight class only to improve the lead to 19-15 with a clutch 3-2 decision at 184 pounds.
With one match to go, Wil Carter ’09 wrestled up one weight class as well and competed in the 197-pound
bout, only to fall to Keydet junior Correy Murray 18-5, ending the match in a 19-19 tie.

“Sam O’Hair stepped it up big time against VMI when he wrestled up a weight class and still managed to
get the win,” said Leonard. “The match was still disappointing, especially for us seniors who have worked so hard these
last four years and had to settle for a tie.”

The Wildcats traveled to Ashland, Ohio, last Sunday for the Ashland University Wendy’s Classic Duals. Lacking the intensity they showed
against VMI, the ’Cats came home winless, losing to Kent State (10-40), Cleveland State (15-25), and Slippery Rock.

The most exciting match of the day was versus Cleveland State, where the two teams exchanged the lead seven times.
Coman, Avola, and Pendle’s victories, along with Boyd’s pin, gave the ’Cats a 15-12 lead, but the Vikings came back
to win the last three bouts and earn the victory. “Our guys wrestled hard but we didn’t have that same
fire as on Wednesday. It’s a long season though, and we’ll just have to get it back for the matches
this weekend.” --Patrick Coman ’06

Avola, Pendle, and Boyd had the best performances for Davidson, with each earning two victories and a loss. Both of
Boyd’s victories were pins. “The Wendy’s Duals were a bit of a letdown after an emotional match against VMI,” said
Coman. “Our guys wrestled hard but we didn’t have that same fire as on Wednesday. It’s a long season though,
and we’ll just have to get it back for the matches this weekend.”

The ’Cats will host Anderson College and Campbell Saturday in Belk Arena. The match begins at 6 p.m.
