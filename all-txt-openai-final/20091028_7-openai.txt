Friedman Visit Reignites Religion Department Debate

Davidson—Thomas Friedman, New York Times columnist and author of The World Is Flat, will be speaking at Davidson this November. His arrival, however, has caused quite the controversy between the Religion and Physics departments at the last faculty meeting. Many in the Religion department believe that Friedman’s speech will finally cement the theory that the world is indeed flat.

Lewis Grant, professor of religion, cited this picture as evidence against a spherical Earth. “About 500 years ago it became quite posh to believe the world wasn’t flat. Some unaccredited scientists came up with pretty radical and unbelievable ideas when you think about it. We have been saying the world is flat way before the last half millennia,” said Lewis Grant, an associate professor of Christian Theology. “In most religious texts it says the world is flat and now we finally have another voice in academia on our side. I will be very interested to see Friedman’s empirical data to prove the world is flat. Friedman is going to lambast all the non-believers.”

In the meeting, Physics department chair Donald Roosevelt commented, “I cannot believe this is up for discussion. Why are we talking about something that was disproved in the Middle Ages? The title of his book is a metaphor for the current state of the global economy.” A smug Grant sniped back, “We will see about that. Have you seen the cover of the book? Who are you going to believe, Copernicus or God?”

The score will be settled when Friedman gives his lecture this November. Grant commented, “I see

Parents’ Weekend 2009 has come and gone, but its aftermath lives on in the traumatized minds of all involved.

“My dad won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1996; he’s a pretty smart guy,” said freshman John Ramos-Horta yesterday. “But he burst into tears when I took him to my international politics class. He passed me a note that said, and I quote, ‘WAT THE F**K IS UR PROF TLKING ABOUT I M SO CONFUZD.’”

“My mom spent hours crying over the homework from my philosophy class,” scoffed junior Flora Hamm. “She sobbed that she didn’t know why she and my dad had sent me here in the first place, and withdrew me the next morning, demanding a refund. She said that any school with student standards as high as they are here at Davidson should only be attended by superhumans.”this as part of a larger trend in academia to return to more traditional beliefs. Finally, we will disprove the existence of a heliocentric universe, germs, and evolution. I mean, does anyone really believe humans came from monkeys anymore?”

Parents’ Weekend Suspended Indefinitely Due to Stressed-out Parents

“Both my parents had panic attacks over the number of events that were planned for them,” added sophomore Peter Little. “They came to my classes, watched me study for two tests and write a paper; we went to see a play, ate in Commons three times a day, and attended a number of other activities, such as study groups, meetings, and Court parties. They were extremely displeased with the lack of free time here at Davidson. They want me to drop out and attend a local community college.”

Parents’ Weekend has been canceled indefinitely after such negative feedback. “Obviously, keeping parents ‘in the know’ has proven disadvantageous for the college,” stated President Tom Ross in his announcement yesterday morning. “When it comes to agonizing their children, for some parents, ignorance is bliss.”

UBERTAS

technology, though I can change oil, brake pads, and compute a ridiculously laborious task. What happened to the traditions and customs that made America great? We ought to be honoring beer and fireworks, not toodling around because you just had the best wheatgrass smoothie ever. I’ll be damned if I even know what that is. I’m a hard-working citizen, and I already have enough bullshit sprinkled into my mouth. You’ve got a thumb up your ass and your Blueberry phone against your fat, stupid mouth as you try and reverse out of the Starbucks in your Volkswagen Beetle convertible. You oughta be ashamed. We are prouder than this, America. We invented steak and D-Day. If George Washington toodled, he would say one thing: “Just crossing the river to go blow up some Redcoats LOL!”

End of story: you’re about to Tweet, think a minute. You don’t need to announce anything to anyone. Real Americans already know you're adopted.

Description: Poli Sci majors are those unique individuals who really do know how laws are made. They speak often and loudly about economic upheaval in Latin America or President Obama’s health care plan. For them, any location is a good location to talk politics. They thrive on debate, enjoy learning about power struggles, and sneer at anyone who cannot name all of their congressional representatives. They often dream about going to law school, are fiercely invested in a political party, and get a real kick out of khaki pants and sweater vests.
