IMAC Basketball: A-Teams Match Up Evenly

By HUNTER GOURLEY and SCOTT HUIE

The A-league, though small in number (only nine teams), is big on competitiveness. Post-Christmas play leaves everything up for grabs: no teams remain undefeated, no teams winless.

On the first school day of the new year, SAE’s second team, the "Far Side," earned its first mark in the win column in a 42-37 squeaker over Basket Case, a Pax team of renowned volleyballers. They aren’t bad at hoops either. Far Side used its well-balanced attack against the Cases whose big gun was Bill Bigger, with a 14-point performance. Meanwhile, amongst other E-baggers, the Hod Squad kept its win streak intact, wearing out the Old Men, 53-34. Senior Scott Brandon banged for 17 points and Dr. Tom Kazee was held to four buckets by the Hoddy D.

PiKA’s sophomore team, Three Seconds, held its own in the lane against the Satterwhite-less defending champs, the Supreme Court of KA, 56-47. J.D. Fleenor and Rob Ellison combined for 29 points to close the case. The brothers of Cool Breeze grabbed their first victory of the season, toppling Far Side 43-38 behind Keith Ellis’ 10 points. In other action, Death by Ru-Ru, a fearless contingent of freshmen, defeated Becca and the Huts, 59-50. The contest featured former Wildcat Billy.

Naso, who hit for 15 points, and Jim Sowerby, who drove the lane for 19 points in a losing cause. A week later, it took four O.T.’s for the Hoddy Squady to dispose of Ru-Ru, 50-48. The E’s were missing Brandon, but Tony Cabrales filled the void, sinking two clutch free throws in the waning seconds. The Court was Supreme over the Old Men, 56-41, behind Michael Holt’s 17 points. Bill Giduz juggled his way to 10 points for the Old Men.

This month’s upset belonged to Pax’s Basket Case which nipped previously unbeaten Three Seconds, 37-36. Losing his breakdance ability, Rick Greene found his J, tossing in 11 for the winners. The Old Men bowed to Becca’s Huts, 60-59. Will Cardwell’s picture-perfect jumpshot accounted for 18 points for the PiKAs. The Huts also disposed of the Far Side, 52-39. Elsewhere, the Old Men rebounded with a 40-30 trouncing of Basket Case, with Kazee banking in 16. Three Seconds downed Cool Breeze, 68-53, behind Alan Futral’s 23 points. Ru-Ru fought off Far Side, 47-45, in a well-balanced attack. And finally, the KA-SAE rivalry was as intense as ever, but the Milk Drinkers prevailed, 41-40, behind Stephen Dockery’s 14 points. Yes, ladies and gents, A-League means satisfaction!

Women’s Basketball Breaks Streak With Win
By ANDY BARRON

Davidson's women’s basketball team has some good news and bad news for the rest of the school. The good news is the team ended a 30-game losing streak with an 88-81 win over Meredith. The bad news is the women are 3-7, including two forfeit wins over Converse, and have a long way to go before winning becomes the rule instead of the exception.

“I’m pleased with the effort and improvement by the team,” said Coach Patty Daley. “Our turnover rate has improved amazingly and we are scoring a lot more points. Our scoring is higher because everyone is contributing and we're moving the ball up the court better.”

Sophomore Heather McKee has been one of the Wildcats’ strengths. McKee is averaging 18.1 points and 7.5 rebounds per game, both team highs. Junior co-captain Amy Hartman is averaging 12.1 points and leads the team in assists with 57 over eight games. Sophomore Mary Griffith is the other player averaging in double figures. Griffith is scoring 10.3 points a game for the Lady Cats.

On Tuesday night, Davidson hosted Coker College. Unfortunately, Davidson was inconsistent offensively and its porous defense allowed Coker to prevail, 90-80. McKee led Davidson with a stunning 35-point, nine rebound effort. Griffith added 14, mostly from long-range.

The Lady Cats’ main problem is rebounding or, to be more specific, blocking out under the boards. Coker was difficult to stop because it generally got two or three shots when it needed them.

“I thought we could have played much better,” Daley said. “We were rushing on offense and not getting the shots we wanted to get. It looked like we were going through the motions.”
