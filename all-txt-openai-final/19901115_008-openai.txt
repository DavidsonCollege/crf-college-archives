Men's Cross-Country

Great Finish And Looking Ahead

By PETER HURTADO

The men’s cross-country team closed its most successful season in recent years in fine fashion, turning in Davidson’s best overall
team performance since 1986 at the NCAA Region III Championships at Furman Saturday.

Davidson placed 29th in the 32-team field of the top Division I teams in the South, in a race which
awarded berths in next week’s National Cross-Country Championships.

Davidson’s top 6 runners ran personal-best times for the 10K course in the Wildcats’ final race of the fall.

Junior Captain Chris Otrok led the way for the ‘Cats, placing 153rd; Chris’ sensational time of 33:54 for 10K was
the fastest by a Davidson man since 1986. Junior Ted Richardson shaved a minute off his time last year, and
closed his breakthrough season with a time of 34:14 (169th).

The lone senior this fall, John Moss, closed his final season with a truly outstanding effort, running a personal-best time
of 34:46 (191st). John’s vast improvement this season should extend to his final season of spring track.

Close behind Moss was Ian Stewart (34:52, 195th). Ian’s consistency this fall was a huge plus to the squad.

Davidson’s top seven were rounded out by Pete Hurtado (35:44, 226th), Freshman Cam Dauler (36:28, 239th), and David Kerns (37:11,
248th).

The men’s season was marked by a large improvement in depth, as well as by truly outstanding personal performances.

The solid contributions of freshmen Dauler, Wharton, and Bellew should continue next fall, and the improvement of the middle pack
of sophomores Stewart, Kerns, and Hurtado also bodes well for next year’s squad.

The consistency and leadership of juniors Otrok and Richardson led the squad to its finest season in recent years. Both
men were named all-Big South, and both are now among the fastest Davidson men ever for the 8K distance.

Coach Gary Andrew was quite pleased with this fall’s performance, and looks forward to a strong spring track season.

Women's Cross-Country

Fastest Davidson Woman Ever

By PETER HURTADO

In their final competition of a very successful season, the women’s cross-country team placed 28th in the 29-team field at
the NCAA Region III Championships at Furman this Saturday. The high-powered race featured the fastest women in the South, and
Davidson ran against some of the nation’s most powerful teams.

Davidson’s fine showing was highlighted by the performance of co-captain Kathy Beach, whose time of 18:58 for 5K is the
fastest time ever by a Davidson woman on this championship course. Beach also became the first Davidson woman to crack
the top 100 finishers of this elite field (91st), a great finale to her outstanding season.

Unfortunately, the team’s characteristic depth, so improved from recent years, was absent last Saturday. Freshman standout Karen Marshall followed Beach
at 20:44 (196th). Marshall’s sensational season bodes well for the future.

Senior Laurie Reams closed her final season with a solid performance of 21:24 (215th). Jean DeMoss (21:45, 223rd), in her
first ever season of cross-country, also had a strong fall. Close behind was Amy Bertram (224th, 21:49), who was running
in her first collegiate race.

Freshman Lisa Sitek (22:26, 232nd) improved vastly over the fall. Davidson’s squad was rounded out by Senior Co-captain Katie Reynolds
(234th, 22:40).

The fall season was marked by solid depth and improvement. The team will miss seniors Laurie Reams and Katie Reynolds,
both of whom have contributed to the team’s march to prominence.

The immediate impact of freshmen Marshall, DeMoss, and Sitek should extend to next fall. Heather Tarpley should continue to provide
depth next season.

The continued improvement of this young squad, led by the front-running and leadership of Kathy Beach, has coach Gary Andrew
optimistic about the chances of a conference title next year.
