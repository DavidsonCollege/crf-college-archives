Madam Welcomes Returnees

I drove faster than my 45 m.p.h. allotment in my haste to return to the Madam. The so-called "vacation" finally
halted. "Vacation," a term that implies relaxation, had grown into a struggle. And the Madam was my comfort.

Perhaps the Madam herself was not what enticed me away from "home." Certainly her girls—English, Mathematics, and all the others
with whom I’ve struggled—did not cause me to drive away. It was the simple fact that there is presently nothing
better to drive to.

"Home" is where the average Davidson student goes during his breaks. He returns to Mom, the old home place, friends,
Wolf the Dog, and broken Big Ben.

In Cold Excites

Frigid, Atrophied Spirit

In these our days disarrayed, is it true that only unused bicycles and forgotten old blankets feel an anticipatory flutter
of excitement in their inanimate little hearts? Contrary to popular rumor, a fuel shortage really does exist. But that doesn’t
matter, since we forget 90 percent of what we hear, anyway.

Yes, we've reached the middle of the term and the anxiety monster is back, first cousin to Mr. Rack, though
they never have been able to get along together. The dorms are cold and unemployment is going up, even bothering
to go to college.

Crawling into Watts Dorm about midnight one evening last week, I was blasted by one stereo playing the latest hit
single, "I Want’cha to Breathe."

A game of "Procrastination" with me, even though it’s a rather ex-diversion when it comes to drawing a "Problem Card."
She drew "Pollution," but Henry immediately told her to forget it and put it on the bottom of the deck.
"We don’t play with that one anymore," he grumbled, looking dully at the board. Henry’s roll told him to go
past "Go," but not to exceed 55 m.p.h. Excited, Harriet rolled again, but succeeded only in pulling a "Shortage Card"
which said, "Go directly to Home. Do not pass the Filling Station. Do not collect $200."

That was enough for me. I hopped up, ran out of the door, and bumped right into Ms. Melinda Make-do,
who was humming "It’s Just a State of Mind, Honey." She turned the ignition. The needle registered "E," but I
was determined to go as far as I could.

For an indeterminable length of time, the 55 m.p.h. signs rushed past me, until the collection of thirty-six.

Sometime later it happened that a figure from the sea stopped and anointed my stony head with whale oil, awakening
and coronating the new spirit, which was suddenly delivered out of my cold within, which was shouting.

Here are the stories, hiding from Papa because he spanked too hard have been cut down. A half-built house stands
in the forest’s place.

Even the student’s room where there were dreams of victory and revenge has become a younger sibling’s dreaming place.

The first night has yet to come. The friends are the student’s salvation.

Some of the gang are already there. They all go to State.

Their greeting is quick, easy. So is their departure.

I arrived at the Madam’s house at noon. I entered without knocking. All was in order as I had left
it. The girls—Shakespeare, Sonnets, and Modern Writers—were upstairs waiting to grasp me, hold me.

But they could wait. I sat upon an easy chair and let the Madam pet my curly-minded head.

"There, there, honey. All can’t be so bad. It’s gonna get better. There, there."

Numerous Rip-Offs Pollute Relaxed Campus Atmosphere

Once upon a time, two roommates decided to build a loft in their dorm room. A friend offered to let
them use some lumber which he had in storage.

When the friend went to get the lumber out of storage, however, the lumber was gone. Resisting the urge to
say, "Who’s been sleeping in my bed?", he reported the loss to the proper authorities.

This tale is incomplete because the lumber was never found.

Naturally, this story is a real-life example from Davidson College. It is also a real-life example of the degeneration of
the Honor System.

We have been lucky here at Davidson. We have been able to leave books, wallets, and other possessions in the
library or on campus itself. Unfortunately, this aspect of campus life is changing.

There is an increasing amount of theft going on in the library and in the dorms.

This reasoning: "He (she) would lend or give me what I need anyway. I need it right now, so I'll
go ahead and take it. He (She) won’t mind."

In many cases, this argument may be true. We all have friends who come in to
