**Abroad last fall? Here’s what happened back on campus**

By WALKER SAIK

For those Davidson students who went abroad in the fall, welcome back to a school that has very little to
do with anything you saw, whether it be Africa, New Zealand, Europe, or anywhere else you made it to. The
first week must have been rough, but the luxuries of free refills, Diet Dr. Pepper, and the Vamonos Van have
to be refreshing.

Considering, though, that most students are busy island hopping off of Australia, diving in the Caribbean, or eating cheese pies
in Greece, keeping up with Davidson athletics can be a bit difficult. But then again, remembering attendance at most Davidson
home events, following each sport while on campus may be difficult as well. So take this as a bit of
a review if you were on campus and as an informational session if you were away. It’s just a bit
of a summary of what happened around here in the fall.

Football disappoints with a 2-7 record despite a stellar season by running back John Leverett ’05, who eclipsed 1982 graduate
Ray Sinclair’s all-time rushing record with 3,165 yards. Leverett was the PFL’s offensive player of the year, while linebacker Brendan
Dete ’05 won the same award for his play on the defensive side. The season opened with a bit of
a doozie when QB Damion White ’05 passed for a school-record 431 yards to nearly come back from a 17-point
first quarter deficit against Coastal Carolina. After a touchdown with 1:38 on the clock to pull within seven, Davidson recovered
the onside kick and drove down the field, but the Wildcats were stopped on fourth and goal at the five.
On the bright side, homecoming brought a dramatic victory, with several defensive stands late in the game to preserve the
21-14 win over Butler. Otherwise, close losses to Austin Peay and Dayton were matched with blowout losses against San Diego
and Georgetown. Davidson was shut out in two of their last three games after scoring a point in 56 straight
games.

As one of those awful mass e-mails pointed out, women’s soccer reached the Conference Finals, becoming one of the most
improved teams in the nation according to an NCAA ranking. New coach Greg Ashton took over the squad and led
them to a 12-9-1 (7-3-1 SoCon) record en route to becoming SoCon coach of the year. Sarah Hobart ’05, Kara
Koehrn ’06, and Nancy Haskell ’08 also got all-conference recognition. After not even making the conference tourney in 2003, the
’Cats got hot at the right time, having a conference stretch where they went 5-0-1, with Hobart allowing only one
goal. In fact, Hobart became Davidson’s all-time saves leader on the season during the SoCon tournament. The storybook season really
came to life, though, in the conference semifinal match against top-seeded UNC-G, who had defeated the ’Cats the previous seven
times. After not recording a shot and trailing 2-0 in the first half, Kara Koehrn took over and scored the
next two goals to knot it up at two. The winning goal was set up by Kara, whose shot was
blocked and sent straight to sister Kristen Koehrn ’08, who won it for the Wildcats, 3-2.

Men’s soccer (11-10-1, 4-3 SoCon), meanwhile, started slowly but nearly returned to NCAA’s after a stellar conference tournament. The team
had an early six-game losing streak.

**Returning stars have tennis teams looking to start strong**

As the men’s and women’s tennis teams prepare for a new spring season, results against tough opposition and talented newcomers
have both sides looking optimistically toward their futures. The women’s team appears ready for a deep run in conference play
with a combination of both talented freshmen and a strong returning core including five seniors. Three of those seniors have
held the top three positions on the team since their first year, giving this team a truly tested line-up. Last
year’s team ran through SoCon play with an 8-2 record, as well as a 17-10 mark overall, but the Wildcats
were not able to translate that success into the conference tournament, falling to College of Charleston 3-4 in quarterfinals action.
The mix of returnees and newcomers, however, has Meghan and Kelly Fillnow ’05 calling this group “the deepest team Davidson
has ever had.” The success of the fall season lends proof to the Fillnows’ claim, as the team posted impressive
results in the College of Charleston Tennis Invitational, where Davidson women were...Victorious in both Flight A and B singles as
well as the Flight A doubles, Davidson also showed well at the Wake Forest Invitational and at the N.C. State
Fall Invitational. The ’Cats opened up the spring season with a tough 6-1 loss at No. 15 UNC, but that
did not serve to discourage the high hopes for the 2005 season. Particularly promising was the play of the three
freshmen, including Kim Whelan ’08, who was the lone Wildcat winner on the day.

On the men’s side, youth still reigns despite five of six starters returning from a team that advanced to the
quarterfinals of SoCon play a year ago. Despite the relative lack of experience, the team “fared better during the fall
season than in the past few years,” according to Joe Cheany ’06. The ’Cats participated in several tournaments this fall,
including the Washington and Lee Fall Classic and the Davidson/Jim Causey Fall Classic, where they posted impressive results.

During the Washington and Lee Fall Classic in September, three singles players, John Bolton ’07, Jay Chitty ’07, and Jared
McKiernan ’07, and the doubles team of Russ Burns ’05 and Matt Hartman ’08 placed first in their brackets, with
Flav Simihaian ’08 reaching the finals of his bracket. During the Davidson/Jim Causey Fall Classic in October, the doubles teams
managed to win 11 of 12 matches while three singles players, Burns, Chitty, and Simihaian, finished the tournament undefeated. “I
think that, barring the injuries that affected us last year,” says Cheany, “we should have a great season and be
in contention for the conference championship.”

The team had a rough streak and couldn’t seem to find its old form until it fought out three straight
overtime victories against Furman, Wofford, and Elon. In the game against Wofford, John Latting ’06 reminded people how good he
was by scoring the tying and winning goals in a game that could have swung the season. Like the women’s
team, Davidson upset UNC-G, ranked 2nd nationally, in the semifinals after Marco Antunez ’07 fed the winner to classmate Cass
Baltz ’07. The squad lost a 1-0 overtime match, however, to College of Charleston in the finals.

Women’s cross-country notched another solid 3rd place in Conference, despite probably deserving a better finish. With the pick-up of three
solid first years in Brittany Crawford ’08, Brenna Burns ’08, and Annie O’Donnell ’08, Coach Jen Straub continued to find
success with her team after posting a conference championship last year. A surprising down-season by top dog Allie Martin ’06
proved to hurt the 'Cats too much, though, and most of the others had tough races at the SoCon championships
to prevent a Championship repeat. Kelly Fillnow ’05 continued dominance in her senior year.

Men’s cross-country, on the other hand, continued to struggle as several of their runners went down early with injuries. With
a team that lacked much depth, losing Matt Rhodes ’07 to a bout of mono really hurt the team early
on, but the emergence of Sam Morris ’08 provided a bright spot for a team that took home 6th at
SoCons.

Volleyball had its second straight rough year, finishing 7-9 in the SoCon and 10-23 overall. Their opening 2-12 record could
have wrecked their confidence, although losing eight of their last 10 conference matchups couldn’t have been good either. After opening
his coaching career at Davidson with a stellar 23-11 season in 2002, Coach Tim Cowie has suffered two straight sub-.500
seasons and two first-round conference losses.

Coming off of a first place divisional finish in 2003, field hockey never found its old form and finished 4th
in the East Division of the NorPac. The bright spot of the year, however, was most certainly the play of
goalkeeper Sarah Nolan ’05, who was one of four goalies in the nation invited to play in the North-South All-Star
game. She holds the school record for saves and will certainly be missed next year.

Plenty else went on as well, with golf and swimming warming up for their spring seasons. Wrestling opened up to
a historic 6-0 record, and basketball had a huge upset against Missouri. So if you’re sick of studying, which happens
surprisingly quickly for formerly abroad folks, head out to a game of your choice.
