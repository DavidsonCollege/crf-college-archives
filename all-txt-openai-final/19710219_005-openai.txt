Invitation Sparks Reactions - Davis

To The Editor:
Rennie Davis should not appear on this campus. The reason is very simple. It is financial. The trustees, alumni, and some students have been very upset with some of the recent changes that have been made at Davidson, such as the allowing of alcohol on campus, the abolishment of fraternities from Patterson Court, and now the appearance of Davis as a speaker. Much of Davidson's gifts come from businessmen, doctors, etc., who represent a somewhat conservative class in America. These recent changes, including affiliation with NSA, have disturbed these people so that they have reduced their gifts to the college. In North Carolina, almost one-half of the private colleges, including Queens, are running deficits in their budgets. Davidson is nearing this point, for it is raising tuition so much that it is pricing itself out of the market. Since I have been here, tuition and board have gone up over $600. It is time for the students of Davidson to recognize that their noble projects and ideas have hurt the amount of gifts given to Davidson. I am sure that the expenditure of $1000 for Davis could have been used for better means, and hopefully for means that would not further alienate our alumni, who are the true lifeblood of the continued existence of this college.

To The Editor:
Having seen the item 1000 dollars underscored as a main point for not even listening to the controversial Mr. Rennie Davis, I wonder if Davidson men have matured past the proposed country-club state. To me, education always meant learning to differentiate between those ideas which one could accept and those which prove untrue. On a "well-reputed" campus completely closes its ears to a viewpoint it does not share, it fails in its educating process.

The Impossible Dream? DuRant Move Criticized

To The Editor:
The results of Chip DuRant’s crusade against the appearance of Rennie Davis here at Davidson could prove to be very interesting for the future of this college. The only legitimate issue in the whole mess is that of the $1,000 which Mr. Davis is to receive for his contribution to our academic community. The Administration felt compelled to say that there is nothing actually illegal about having Mr. Davis appear here, but that such a choice at such a price would probably be in poor taste, according to the Administration. Mr. DuRant has simplified the problem somewhat by removing the debate from the area of real issues. He is concerned with the effect on Davidson's "image" the presence of "a convicted criminal" on campus will have. By the very nature of his position, it appears that Mr. DuRant will not be much impressed by some diehard who might point out to him that the way to support America and its institutions, such as freedom of speech, may not necessarily lie in refusing to listen to certain people who elect to use, or even abuse, their freedom of expression, or seeking to deny them a public hearing. It can be hoped, however, that students who are confronted with Mr. DuRant’s petition will consider that there is still a draft, that the war in Asia has continued its weird growth seemingly beyond anyone’s control or purpose, and that even at pastoral Davidson there is some real disagreement about the details of our community’s functioning. Mr. Davis has personally committed himself to his own answers to these sorts of problems. I am not sure what effect on Davidson’s image Mr. Davis’ speech will have. It does seem, though, that applications for admission here are way off this year, although Mr. H. E. White seems to feel that a basketball team with a national ranking is all that we will need to get those applications rolling again. The cancellation of Mr. Davis’ scheduled appearance would further typify this institution’s image as a provincial, parochial finishing school with delusions of grandeur, run primarily for the benefit of those who have come and gone rather than for those who are here.

Granted, Mr. Davis will make his plea through a whirlwind of sensationalism and promote grossly antagonistic suggestions, especially if he perceives they are having their desired effect. What would fluster him the most would be to have emotionally calm students on hand to pick apart the logic of his statements or at least to tear them away from the created emotion which Tinsley Notices.Jesus Movement supposedly beginning in California, known as the Jesus Movement. The astounding fact is, however, that this revival is not confined to the west coast. It has already begun all over the nation . . . and, on our campus! Six students from Davidson attended a conference in Illinois over Christmas at which 12,300 young people from all over the nation and world spent four and a half days praising, singing, learning, and living together as Christian brothers and sisters. On our campus, right now, there are weekly prayer meetings, weekly student services (through the chaplain Scott Woodmansee and students), daily group prayer, Bible studies several times a week at different locations, groups that go around to nearby churches to sing and spread the Good News, and groups set up to undertake certain projects which they feel called to work on. The Jesus Movement is not only coming, it's here! And, if you want to give it a chance, discuss it, or argue against it, you shouldn't have too much trouble finding a proponent of the movement near you.

clouds them. If questioned either as to whether or not he is worth one thousand of those hard-earned green things or as to what purpose “our” money will be used for, I could only hazard a meaningless guess. But in terms of value to the Davidson community's education in our growing sphere of existence, I see our exposure to him as a necessity. Bar we now the door, it will close much easier the next time.

To The Editor:

The latest controversy on campus concerning the coming of Rennie Davis prompted me to pay closer attention to a recently read passage. It goes: “Nothing is more embarrassing, in the ordinary intercourse of life, than this irritable patriotism of the Americans. A stranger may be well inclined to praise many of the institutions of their country, but he begs permission to blame some things in it, a permission which is inexorably refused. America is therefore a free country, in which, lest anybody should be hurt by your remarks, you are not allowed to speak freely of private individuals, or of the state; of the citizens, or of the authorities; of public or of private undertakings; or, in short, of anything at all.” Alexis de Tocqueville.

Does this have any bearing on the free speech movement of Mr. DuRant? I think it does most definitely, for he is attempting to deprive me of my right to hear another side of an important issue. I feel the coming of Rennie Davis to our campus will provide an educational experience to all those who hear him, whether they agree with what he says or not, and this to me is what our speaker program is all about.

Fu Manchu Plot Exposed

To the Editor:

Mr. Burney’s expose of our rampant nepotism was enough in its way, but it failed to turn the searchlight of rigorous inquiry upon the powers behind this shocking abuse of sound academic personnel policy. This I now shall do.

The hidden hand behind the insidious plot to plunge Davidson into idiocy and mental retardation is none other than that of the notorious Dr. Fu Manchu. His local agents, cleverly disguised as grammar-graders, under-skinkers, Raleigh men, associate professors, and campus dogs, have already set up numbered Swiss bank accounts to receive the golden harvest their guileful master expects. This will have two sources: the first from the idiots and retardees, whose services, after they have been turned into human vegetables, the plotters will farm out to the military-industrial-labor complex, always in need of disc jockeys, customer’s men, pickets, quiz-show audiences, roller-derby stars, generals and chairmen of the board. The second, far richer, will come from the exploitation of the colossal Eskimo Pie mines which undergird this entire campus. These were discovered, and their existence concealed, by agents of the Doctor’s in the guise of tree-trimmers and power-and-light men.

You have been warned; sauve qui peut. Fortunately, I am in a position to assure the transfer of any interested Davidson student into an institution of higher learning where he and he alone will determine his choice of studies, of teachers, of hours, and of life-style and associates. Its alumni include some of the world’s most famous men and women, and its history is most impressive. I am serious, so help me Eli Yale; and I await the inquiries of any and all who feel themselves menaced by idiocy or Eskimo Pies. Naturally, Mr. Burney has the first priority for my recommendation.
