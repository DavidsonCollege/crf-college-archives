### At a Glance

#### Trustees Set Meeting
The second Board of Trustees’ Meeting of the 1977-78 school year is scheduled for February 16 and 17. On the
agenda for the Education Committee is an interview with three professors who are up for tenure. Final decisions will be
made in the spring. The Finance Committee will approve the budget and discuss investment management of endowment funds. The Development
Committee plans to meet with Davidson's professional consultant, Mr. John P. Butler, on the 1987 Program. It will also review
different projects at Davidson, including the Martin Science Building, the College Commons Program, and the WDAV Radio Campaign.

#### Ostwalt Recuperates
Professor of Education and Psychology J. H. Ostwalt appears to be recovering nicely from a heart attack suffered over the
Christmas break. Ostwalt is under a doctor’s supervision and taking diagnostic tests. No statement has been released from the medical
examiner’s office regarding Ostwalt’s work schedule, but one can be expected within the next week. “It looks good,” Ostwalt commented.
“I feel fine.”

#### Library Locates Books
Director of the Library Leland M. Park announced in a memo to the College on February 8 that 96 books
have been located since the publication of the list of lost books and bound periodicals. This brings the three-year total
down from the 762 level to the mid-600s, or about 220 books per year. Eleven of the 39 bound periodicals
that were missing have also been found. “The total is still unacceptable, yet it is certainly improving, and for that
we are grateful,” said Park.

#### Tea for Two...or Three
Second Cannon has begun inviting professors to tea on Sunday afternoons to talk with them on an informal, non-academic basis.
Two or three professors are invited each Sunday to tea held in Cannon lounge at 4 pm. “The purpose of
the teas is for the hall to have a chance to meet professors and get to know them as people.
It also enables faculty and students to discuss topics of current national and local interest, including problems at Davidson. It’s
a chance to find out about the courses these professors teach and the programs they sponsor,” said freshman Carol Loptson,
who helps arrange the teas. The program began last Sunday when the freshmen women invited Professor of German Hansford Epes
and Professor of History David G. Rice.

### Winkler Assumes Editorship
By AMANDA HALL
Production Manager

Professor of German Julius S. Winkler will serve as permanent co-editor of the Miscellany beginning with the Spring 1978 issue,
sharing power equally with the student editor or editors. The innovation, proposed by former Miscellany editor Bill Barnes and Professor
of English Gill Holland, will probably lead to the development of a better magazine, according to Barnes. With students serving
only one-year editorships, the magazine suffered from a lack of continuity. According to Barnes, the new editors had to practically
rebuild the Miscellany each year. Winkler’s editorship will alleviate this problem and help coordinate ongoing business like subscription and communication
with the North Carolina Arts Council, who subsidizes the magazine.

Another important factor in creating the permanent co-editorship is that Winkler will give the magazine more influence because he has
connections and knowledge that student writers do not. Barnes believes this year is a good time to create the co-editorship
because several prominent literary magazines in the area have ceased publication. An improved Miscellany should be able to increase both
its subscribers and contributors significantly.

The Media Board gave the new co-editorship a one-year tentative approval, scheduled for re-evaluation at the end of the current
editorship. Gary Hart, Patsy Daniels, and Winkler explained the tentative approval as a period in which the editors will establish
policy and standardize procedure. They do not expect the Board to reject the co-editorship at the re-evaluation. The reason behind
the change is to have a good magazine, not to give the faculty control of a student publication, emphasized Barnes.
“Winkler is the sort of person who is willing to let other people do the work as long as it
gets done well. What we want to do is run a better magazine. A good Miscellany would be a credit
to Davidson College and the English Department. We have the money and the talent to put out a good magazine,
but we haven’t.”said. Barnes cited student editorship as the reason the Miscellany has not been as good a magazine as
possible, partly because of lack of enthusiasm, partly lack of continuity, and partly because the students know few people in
the literary field. The Philosophy Journal, initially an offshoot of the Miscellany, will not be affected by the editorial change.
Although the journal originally was to receive funds through the Miscellany budget and is a publication of the Miscellany organization,
it now has a separate editor and staff. “The only connection the Philosophy Journal has with us is that we
share the same office,” said Hart.

Ethiopian fighting intensifies

Ethiopia: Fighting has intensified between Ethiopia and Somalia over the occupation of the Ethiopian province of Ogaden. A major controversy
is developing over arms supplies to the two warring states. The Soviet Union has supplied $1 billion of arms to
Ethiopia, with Cuba, East Germany, and South Yemen supplying personnel and training. Israel’s Prime Minister Moshe Dayan has announced that
Israel is also selling arms to the Ethiopian government. The U.S. has refused Somalian requests for arms but is sending
$6 million in food to that country.

Washington, D.C.: Sadat has been in the U.S. since Saturday meeting with President Jimmy Carter and key Congressional figures, urging
the U.S. to pressure Israel. In a meeting with Congressmen Tuesday, February 7, Sadat requested arms aid from the U.S.
No indication has been made concerning arms sales but Carter has indicated that U.S. policy toward Israel will not change.

Washington, D.C.: The controversial 332-page reform bill is currently under consideration in the House. It would extend the death penalty
to include such offenses as treason and limit the flow of national defense information to the public. In other areas,
the bill discourages granting of parole and harmonizes conflicting crimes. The ACLU called it an improvement over the past system
but feels it will strengthen governmental power.

Devon considers course of action
[Continued from page 1]

College may allege in support of its decision.” If the PAC cannot resolve the matter by informal methods, it can
submit a recommendation to the Faculty Hearings Committee (FHC) to conduct a hearing. If the FHC concludes that adequate cause
for dismissal was not established, it will submit a report to the President. Should the President reject the report by
the FHC, he will submit his reasons, in writing, to the FHC and to the faculty member. He will then
allow time for a response before giving the case to the Trustees for consideration.

Wolf explained that the PAC had never received a formal complaint from Devon, and that it could take no further
action unless she submitted a statement. The PAC informed Devon of its decision immediately after the meeting. Devon commented, “I
have to think about what action I am going to take.” She explained why she had not earlier submitted a
statement to the PAC. “The burden of responsibility for proof rests with me. It’s difficult to establish absolutely whether the
administration evidenced personal malice, discriminated on the basis of race or sex, or violated academic freedom in their evaluation of
me.” She said she could establish her academic and professional qualifications but that the PAC was looking for evidence of
discriminatory measures employed by the Administration in their evaluation process.

Washington, D.C.: In response to last week’s crash of a Soviet nuclear satellite, President Carter will seek an agreement with
the Soviet Union to curtail further such satellite launching.

New York: As reports of shortages came in, the United Mine Workers and the Mining Industry reached a tentative agreement
that will provide a 37 percent increase in benefits and wages over the next three years. If the agreement is
approved it will end a record-breaking 63-day strike. It is estimated that production will resume in late February.

Hong Kong: Groups of 50 to 60 tourists have been allowed into Communist China. Visitors say that on their four-day
trip from Hong Kong to Canton they were allowed to see agricultural communes, machine shops, as well as being able
to spend free time in the cities.

Briefly:
President Carter will expand aid to college students, proposing a $1.2 billion program to increase the number of middle-income students
helped by $1 million.
New York City received 17 inches of snow. It is estimated to cost $8-10 million to clean up and clear
the city.
The U.S. Postal Service quotes a $688 million deficit for fiscal year 1977.
