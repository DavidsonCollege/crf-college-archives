**Anti-apartheid groups “Teach-In” over Homecoming**

By MARGARET CARROLL

Amidst the Homecoming festivities on Saturday, some 75 people gathered behind Vail Commons for a “Teach-In” sponsored by the Charlotteans for a Free Southern Africa and Davidson alumni in favor of divestment. The teach-in consisted of speakers, booths, music, and banners in favor of divestment in South Africa.

The participants also marched in a silent vigil around the campus carrying a huge canvas sign depicting a “show of hands.” The sign, seven feet square, showed a map of Africa in blue with South Africa highlighted in red and a Davidson seal with a sword piercing through the seal into the heart of South Africa.

The Charlotteans are an organization which provides information to the community about the situation in Southern Africa and how the policies of the US government and various multinational corporations support apartheid.

Senior Julie Mayfield, president of Davidson Students Against Apartheid, acted as coordinator of the event, working with the Charlotteans and Monroe Gilmour, head of the alumni in favor of divestment.

Speakers at the teach-in included NAACP regional representative Katherine Egland, up from Gulfport, Miss., state NAACP President Kelly Alexander, Jr., Davidson religion Professor David Kaylor, Gilmour, Mayfield, senior Kevin Dunn, and two black South African students who did not introduce themselves for fear that their government would reprimand them.

Egland commented to The Charlotte Observer that Davidson is betraying its affiliation to the Presbyterian Church by not pulling out of South Africa. The Church has already made plans to liquidate its stock in South Africa and is on its way to being completely out of South Africa.

Kaylor said, “Most of the speakers stated that Davidson is a leading institution with Christian commitments that should exercise moral leadership by supporting divestment.”

Duke, UNC-Chapel Hill, NC State, and Johnson C. Smith are North Carolina schools that have completely divested. Alexander said in The Observer, “Davidson isn’t any backwater institution. It trains the elite. It is more important for you to be morally right than to save two or three dollars.”

The Observer also reported that Davidson officials calculate that total divestiture would cost the school’s $67 million endowment as much as $275,000 per year.

Mayfield claimed that the teach-in was a great way to attract alumni and student attention and to continue to give the Davidson Board of Trustees a message that they need to hear. The Trustees still support the Sullivan Principles, which were established by Rev. Leon Sullivan.

These principles tried to improve the behavior of companies in South Africa by supporting equal employment, wages, and improved housing for the blacks. Sullivan himself has now renounced the principles and realizes that the mere presence of companies in South Africa shows support for apartheid. Although the Trustees of Davidson acknowledge that the situation in South Africa needs improvement, they still hold on to the Sullivan Principles as the answer.

Mayfield said that overall the teach-in was “a great success,” and she claimed that “it showed that the community is aware of the situation in South Africa.”

One of the signs at the Homecoming game read “Davidson IN the end zone; ALL of South Africa!” The two South African students, although they would not speak about the situation, pointed at a pro-divestment sign as the crowd yelled, “Davidson out of South Africa.” Also, the two sang their national anthem, which is illegal in South Africa now.

“The pressure will continue until Davidson has divested,” stated Mayfield firmly.

for nine months before shipping off to Korea. He married Jane Smith who waited back in Easley, S.C., while Craig spent 1954-55 as an Army lieutenant overseas.

After his discharge, he returned to Wachovia to continue his banking career which lasted almost 40 years and took him through banks in Pennsylvania and several North Carolina towns.

His most recent move was to Charlotte and First Union Corporation, which he was serving as president at the time of his death.

He brought his keen business acumen to numerous Davidson alumni service posts, including the annual fund, the alumni association board, the Wildcat Club, and the Board of Visitors.

He was first elected to the board of trustees as an alumni trustee in 1973 and succeeded Fred Stair ’39 as chairman on Jan. 1, 1985. He headed the search committee that brought President John Kuykendall to Davidson, and has played a vital role in the formation and “silent phase” of the present campaign for Davidson.

“He had a vision for Davidson that he did a great deal to bring about,” Kuykendall says. “He really had Davidson at the center of his life. He was everything a board chairman and an alumnus ought to be. He loved Davidson for what it meant to him in the formation of his life.

“He was a great companion and boss to work with. He had a remarkable way of touching the lives of individuals. He supported students, faculty, and staff in a multitude of ways. Many people at Davidson have lost a close personal friend.”

A colleague from Charlotte said on his death that Ben Craig would want to be remembered not just for his professional career but also for his service to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg community. Craig served as a subcommittee chairman for the United Way and founded the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Council on Literacy, serving as its first president.

He is survived by his wife, Jane Smith Craig of Charlotte, and three children: Cathryn Craig Coles, Sarah Jane Craig ’81, and Ben T. “Chip” Craig Jr. ’86.
