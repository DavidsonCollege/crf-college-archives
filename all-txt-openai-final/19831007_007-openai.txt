#### Mysterious Sentelle Attic Paintings Rediscovered

By ROSS HOLT

In a dim and dusty vault high above the everyday movement of Davidson life, little creatures live. They dance, pray,
kill, and make love, frozen forever in paint above the clouds in the attic of Sentelle Dormitory.

Over the past few years, the attic paintings have been discovered, lost, and rediscovered as various residents of Sentelle stack
chairs or pull out loft ladders and haul themselves into the dark other world. Some do it simply to investigate
somewhere they’ve never gone; others make the climb because they’ve heard rumors of tales the old-timers tell about shrines, altars,
and rituals deep within the recesses of the attic.

The paintings lie in a cube formed by the huge upright beams that support the center of the roof. In
addition to the beams and their diagonal supports, the mysterious artist has nailed on horizontal scraps of 1"x4" upon which
to complete his enigmatic work. Scattered about the cement floor are crumbling chips of cement and red-painted bricks, the last
vestiges of an altar. A twisting wire hangs from the roof beams, traces of candle wax peeling from its end.
More wax has coagulated in places on the horizontal boards, frozen where it once dripped over the sides.

The figures themselves are sexless, flowing white ghouls with Kilroy-style heads, hair of yellow and eyes of red. They seem
to be lorded over by all-red, apparently all-seeing beings, each with one huge eye and a tail. Some of the
white figures dance; two symmetrical friezes on the west side of the cube portray combat with swords or spears; on
the north face, the head of a hapless figure explodes; on the east side, another figure stabs itself with a
sword. Interspersed among the creatures are palm prints made with some red substance, probably paint.

But the haunting questions persist. To whom belongs this holy-of-holies? Whose field of Ha Ha is hidden amongst the rafters?
Who spent hours in that dark attic scratching away with a paintbrush and a few cans of paint, and why?
And once this mystery artist completed his work, for what purpose was it used? The old-timers as well as the
new visitors will all speculate. Perhaps some strange cult operates beneath the veneer of Calvinist Davidson. Maybe children of another
Davidson generation played with their less-than-legal toys in the attic. Or perhaps an organization of brotherhood herded its initiates into
the shrine for their secret rites.

The answers, however, lie at the Davidson Art Department. Professor Russ Warren ended the speculation when he recognized photographs of
the “shrine” as the work of a former student of his, sometime around 1978-79. He said the subject the student
was studying was “ritual in art.” Warren, however, could not remember the student’s name. Nor could The Davidsonian, using names
of people Warren thought might know who did it, uncover the name of the mystery artist.

And so they dance, those little figures, and fight, and pray in the darkness above Sentelle Dorm. Only their creator
knows their significance.
