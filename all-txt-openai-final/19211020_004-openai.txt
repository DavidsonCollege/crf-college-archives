### EDITORIAL

“We cannot lead others to a higher plane than we ourselves have attained.”

Don’t fool yourself into mistaking activity for efficiency. Most of the time it isn’t.

“Some fellows are so busy tooting their own horns they wouldn't stop to listen to Sousa’s Band.”

As long as the Wildcats maintain the fighting spirit which they showed last Saturday, they will never lack supporters.

Judging by the number of students taking part, singing in chapel seems to be a welcome innovation.

If the interest in class basketball continues to grow on the campus, it will soon be a rival of football
in the volume of cheering to be heard at games.

### THE DRIFTER

Among the many types of men to be found on the modern college campus, perhaps none is more to be
pitied than that of the drifter—the man who seems to have no object in life save to while away the
few inevitable hours between eating and sleeping. He has no desire to study, neither does he engage in college activities.
Athletics require too much time and effort, and he can see no reason for working himself to death on a
college publication, or joining a literary society. Occasionally he makes a firm resolution to begin real work, but it requires
but little to change his purpose. For the remainder of his time, he wanders aimlessly about seeking something to amuse,
and is turned from one side to another at the slightest opposition.

Davidson is no exception to the rule in this respect, for every year there appears in our midst a certain
number of men who fall clearly into this class, and a somewhat larger number who are on the border line
between it and the majority of industrious students. Such men do little harm to any but themselves. They have not
even the energy to be thoroughly bad. Their influence in the student body is practically nothing, and yet the presence
of such men in college cannot but have a demoralizing effect on their fellows. Give a little thought to this
matter and see whether you are in danger of being classified as a drifter, and if so, get busy. It
is a true saying that the man who aims at nothing in particular, generally hits his mark.

### WHO WILL DO IT?

Every year about this time there are a goodly number of students to be seen exercising on the open-air gymnasium.
Many of these men have had valuable training and experience in high schools, and are capable of becoming first-class gymnasts.
However, on account of the lack of any incentive at Davidson, they gradually give up their practice and lose this
chance for physical development.

Several years ago, Davidson had a regular gym team. This team was selected by competition from the best gymnasts in
school, and made annual trips to nearby towns and colleges. This custom has been discontinued in recent years. Why should
not the Davidson of today, with her five hundred students, be able to turn out as successful a team of
this kind as she was when her student body numbered only three hundred? We believe that there is abundant material
here for such a team, and should like to see some enterprising student or students take charge of a movement
to revive it.

### MINSTREL SHOW PROMISES

Under the direction of Professor Erwin, the minstrel show is going to repeat its success of last year—and then some!
Bigger, better, and brighter than ever before, is this minstrel show. The program is nearly complete, and the finishing touches
are now being put to the show. There is the usual opening, followed by jazz-time specialties, then the play, and
for the ending, a Grande Finale.

The end men are in their usual position, while Gibson, Bogart, Woolfolk, and others are ready with their jokes. Old
jokes, new jokes, local jokes, foreign jokes, jokes good and jokes bad—all are on deck for the use of these
wits. The quartet is back again, while Raker falls heir to Vance’s place. Songs, hits, and novelty stuff aplenty are
here and sung by the best in college. The dancers are back, adding some new wrinkles gotten this summer. Besides
the usual clogging, they are putting on several original bits of fun.

The night’s entertainment, under the direction of Director Erwin, is “something never seen before.”

### OPEN FORUM

What would you have done? I did as you, walked up the street looking at the shoes which were being
worn by the men. Did you know that Brogue oxfords with English woolen socks were all the go now? I
didn’t before. I went to Ed Melons and asked about them. I was told that most of the correctly dressed
men were wearing either Brogue oxfords with English woolen socks or Brogue shoes with silk socks. And believe me, they
look good.

Several years ago, when the enrollment of Davidson College wasn’t as large as now but yet large enough to crowd
the dormitories, we were asked as a favor to “double up.” Some rooms had three and a few four. At
that time, no rules were made limiting the number of watts to the room or number of square inches to
the window. Now that Davidson has to turn down applicants, and now that we are still crowded to the hilt,
the amount of light in each room is gradually being diminished. Two fellows can manage to live and study by
two lights fairly well—but when it comes to only two lights to three people, it’s a different matter. There is
little enough studying done by the average man these days and he should be given every advantage that will help
him along in that line. At least, he should have plenty of light on his subject if he is to
make progress in it.

### DAVIDSON COLLEGE MAGAZINE NOW IN HANDS OF PRINTERS

The Davidson College Magazine, containing at least three short stories and a number of serious essays, went to press last
Tuesday. The management wishes especially to call attention to the fact that the exchanges are all humorous and that some
of the jokes are really quite witty. Among those who have contributed stories are such men as June-bug Price, Liston
Elkins, Okey Allison, and Bill.Joe Martin, while the subjects treated range from the quaint, subtle, oriental atmosphere of “Sin Lo,”
and the mysterious “Valley of the Shadow,” to the bright “Hollyhocks and Columbine” and the martial scenes of “Jean’s Lieutenant.”
The management also announces a shocking “Lightning” by the Chief Engineer of the General Electric Co. A letter of congratulation
has also been received from Woodrow Wilson, and will be duly published and spread abroad. There will, of course, be
the usual essays by local students, one or two of them being learned criticisms of modern writers. Several poems have
likewise been perpetrated, but the names of the young heroes, their authors, have been withheld for fear of mob violence.
It is even possible that there may be more surprises in store, but the management, always wisely conservative, has refrained
from releasing further details to an eagerly expectant public.

WELL KNOWN METHODIST MISSIONARY DIES.

Respect and honor. Some seem to think reverence in the church means the reading of daily papers, magazines, novels, talking
during the sermon. Christ said, “My house is a house of prayer.” Out of respect for His house, and out
of respect for Him, we should behave accordingly.

NUMBER OF REAL THRILLS

The Wildcat Minstrel, under the direction of Joe Martin, is well organized and promising to be bigger and better than
ever. The program has been decided upon and the final touches are being added. LaFar is holding forth in the
center, while R. K. Shaw has charge of the ends. McGeachy, McLeod, and Jones are also contributing to the entertainment
with their feet. Besides the snappy new songs, the play is the most unique part of the program. In the
words of those who have seen it, nothing more thrilling has ever been attempted or heard of on the Davidson
stage.

Bishop Walter R. Lambuth, M. E. Church, Passes Away in Far East.

Nashville, Tenn., Oct. 13—On September 27, 1921, a cablegram was received at headquarters of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, announcing
the death of Bishop Walter R. Lambuth, in Yokohama, Japan, following an operation at the United States naval hospital. In
the passing of Bishop Lambuth, Southern Methodism not only mourns a worthy and honored son, but the news of his
death will bring sorrow to thousands in nearly every quarter of the globe, for he was a world citizen. Bishop
Lambuth was an outstanding man in his generation and everywhere was accorded high honor, not only as a prominent churchman,
but as a skilled surgeon, noted author, lecturer, and explorer. He gave practically his whole life to the service of
mankind, being the messenger of his Church in Africa, China, Cuba, Brazil, Japan, Korea, Siberia, Belgium, Poland, as well as
in fields nearer home. He was born in Shanghai, China, in 1854, being the son of James W. and Mary
McClellan Lambuth, pioneer missionaries of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. Bishop Lambuth received a broad and liberal education and held
degrees from prominent colleges and universities in America and Europe. He received his medical and M.A. degrees from Vanderbilt University
in 1877 and later graduated from Bellevue Hospital Medical College, New York City. He did special work in surgery in
Edinburgh and London. He was also a fellow in the Royal Geographic Society.

Have you ever thought what a powerful part suggestions play in the everyday affairs of man? What percentage of your
thoughts, your actions, and your habits can you trace back to suggestion? Did you know that, largely through the suggestions
in these columns, about 25 Davidson men went to Ed Mellons for their fall hats last Saturday? That about 12
went there for overcoats and still a greater number for shirts and various other articles? Did you know that the
show houses, cafeterias, and restaurants who patronize the Davidsonian were, in their own words, flooded with Davidson men Saturday? Most
of this can be traced, as you know, to the suggestion made in chapel Friday morning. Admitting then that our
thoughts and actions are influenced by suggestions, have you thought, further, what a slave we are to suggestions in matters
of dress? We are chained to suggestions there as Samson to the Philistine wheel. To illustrate this: I wanted to
buy a pair of shoes while in Charlotte Saturday. What did I do first? I looked around at the well-dressed
men and got a suggestion from them.

Many former Davidson students were at the game; among them: Joe McCaskill, John Gaston, Leonard Dick, Gene Lewis, John Wright,
Bill Massey, and J. C. McMaster.

The International Relations Club has held no meetings so far this year, but expects to begin work this week. New
members will be elected at an early date. Membership in the club is restricted to those Juniors and Seniors making
a high grade in any course in Social Science. The result of this election is awaited with interest as the
International Relations Club is one of the most interesting and instructive organizations on the campus. Already a course of study
has been arranged which will be carried out by the members and by speakers from other colleges.—N. C. College for
Women.

Don’t Let a Good Custom Die.

It has always been the custom at Hampden-Sydney to show respect towards the faculty. We owe much to them. They
are our friends, but also our moral and intellectual superiors. When you speak to a professor, raise your hat. This
little act is only courtesy; don’t neglect it. This article is unnecessary as regards the greatest number of men, but
a simple reminder hurts no one. Don't allow a good custom to die out. Uncover!—The Tiger.

Sportsmanship.

Last Saturday when the plucky little crew from Davidson were flinging every ounce of their physical and mental power into
an effort to stop the onrushes of the Tornado, the Davidson captain saw fit to send one of his men
to the bench. I do not know the man’s name but he’s a man—every inch of him. His left leg
gave perceptibly beneath his sturdy frame. He held his chest as if it were paining severely. His breath came in
gasps as he protested because he could play no more. Down his face there streamed tears—the tears from the very
soul of a man who had given his all and yet longed and fought and cried in an effort to
give more. Many Tech men recognized the caliber of the fallen foe and voiced their approval by a hearty clapping
of their hands.—Technique.

Some Printer.

“May I print a kiss on your lips?” he said, and she nodded her sweet permission. So we went to
press, and I rather guess we printed a full edition. “But one edition is hardly enough,” she said with a
charming pout, so again in the press the form was placed, and we got some ‘extras’ out. —The Cadet.

VISITORS ON THE HILL

Lee Campbell, ex-’23, who is now practicing law, visited the hill Friday. “Amo” Love, '19, was here for a brief
stay Sunday afternoon. “Bill” Massey, ex-’24, who is studying law at Wake Forest this year, visited Davidson Sunday, having come
over from Charlotte after the game.
