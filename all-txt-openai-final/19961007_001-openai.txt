### Four new approved minors by faculty

#### By ANN HATFIELD
#### Staff Writer

Last Tuesday, all academic departments voted individually on the issue of minors. As a result of these votes, the Economics, Spanish, and German/Russian departments will now add the option of minors to their curriculums. These three subjects join the Music and French departments as the only departments that have adopted minors.

Last April, the Council on Academic Affairs’ efforts to bring the option of minors to Davidson were rewarded. In a vote that surprised many, faculty members decided to allow each individual department to decide on the issue of minors. This year, five of Davidson’s 19 academic departments now offer the option.

Professor Malcolm Partin, Chair of the History Department and Secretary of Faculty, states that the History department has decided to wait on offering a History minor. The English department has also chosen to postpone voting and proceed slowly. Professor Cynthia Lewis, Chair of the English department, says, “The motive for having minors is to attract students, and in relation to the number of students we teach every year, we feel hard-pressed already to meet the demand.”

Liz Abernethy, Chair of the Council on Academic Affairs, reports that in order to preserve uniformity, some professors feel that if one department offers minors, all should. Abernethy says, “Our department will continue to monitor the process of minors and look into other issues such as the addition of new concentrations.”

In a random departmental poll taken last spring by The Davidsonian, the Philosophy, Education, Classics, and Chemistry departments expressed interest in offering a minor, although they had not reached formal conclusions on the matter. The Council on Academic Affairs remains hopeful that other departments will soon add the option of minors.

### Students plagued by on-campus parking woes

Students plagued by on-campus parking woes this year aren’t the only ones complaining. Last week marked the town of Davidson’s first attempt to relieve the downtown area’s parking crunch. However, according to merchants and residents, the town’s new parking solution has proved to be another headache.

On Wednesday, the Davidson Police Department began enforcing the town’s new Main Street parking regulations, developed by Town Administrator Leamon Brice. According to Brice’s new parking policy, Main Street parking northbound from Concord Road to Griffith Street and southbound from Griffith to Depot Street is restricted during business hours to Davidson merchants and their employees so the spaces in front of shops are left open. Anyone else, including students and employees of the college, downtown shoppers, and visitors, will be towed.

Merchants have long complained about insufficient parking spaces. The spaces which did exist along Main Street, they said, were often filled by college students and employees, as well as shoppers, leaving merchants and employees with no parking options.place to park. Brice says the new policy is a response to such complaints. The policy, he says, “was a genuine attempt to make spaces available for people to park in all day.” However, just days after its implementation, the majority of reaction to the parking regulations seems to be negative.

Saturday night lights: football shines

Last year the game-winning field goal split the uprights, giving Guilford a 31-28 win over Davidson on the last play. This year, the tying bid fell short and wide right, as the revamped Wildcats (2-2) secured a stirring 13-10 victory and won their second game, something they were unable to accomplish last season.

“We've always played teams real tough and used to come up on the short end,” said defensive end Ben Spivey, who had two sacks and a blocked punt. “That’s the way it’s been around here for a long time. But I think we took it into our own hands today and tried to make the breaks go our way.”

After the Quakers’ Kris Radecki notched a 25-yard field goal on the game’s opening possession, Davidson countered with a Matt Strader 1-yard touchdown plunge. Strader, who replaced regular

Tommy Dugan after the Wildcats’ first offensive series and played the rest of the way, led a 14-play, eight-minute, 74-yard drive for the score. Tailback Lorenzo Moll (86 yards on 21 carries) rushed for 32 yards on the march and freshman fullback Eric Ferguson, who continues to impress with his hard-nosed running and blocking, gained 17 of his 49 total ground yards.
