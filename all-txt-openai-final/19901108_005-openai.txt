Gantt Article Devoid of Truth

To the Editor:

Reading Tom Koonce’s article this week “Support for Gantt Visible on Campus” reminds one of the old adage: “You can
fool all of the people all of the time—but only if they’re stupid.” For a journal that prides itself on
fair and objective journalism, it is surprising to see that the lead article on the front page would be so
one-sided and devoid of truth. We take exception to his assertion that Helms supporters are politically inert.

In fact, nothing could be farther from the truth. Our confidence in Senator Helms' integrity and the likelihood of his
election make it unnecessary for us to demonstrate and agitate in a vain attempt to sway North Carolina’s “real” voters.
Davidson’s ivory tower of liberal intelligentsia no more accurately represents the real attitude of the normal North Carolina voter than
does a two-dollar bottle of Evian represent what they drink.

Asserting that we harbor antipathy towards our candidate is like suggesting that a journalist should present his or her biased
opinions in the guise of fact. Mr. Koonce certainly may be a liberal voter, but he is not less liberal
in the misuse of the truth. The truth is that as supporters of Senator Helms and his strong policy on
the environment, we have refrained from putting up many and sundry posters. After the election is over Mr. Gantt’s posters
will be nothing more than landfill space, something we will truly regret. And the Davidson Students for Harvey Gantt? They
have slipped flyers under student doors on campus, provided bumper stickers for the faculty and most recently sent letters to
the parents of every North Carolina student at Davidson. Noble indeed, but what of those poor innocent sequoias? And how
many rainforests destroyed to make Mr. Gantt a senator?

Do these students somehow believe that hundreds of posters and flyers will convince the voters of North Carolina that Mr.
Gantt won’t raise their taxes or something? Certainly, Mr. Gantt and his supporters are not lacking in enthusiasm, but the
bottom line amounts to the majority of the votes on election day, and in that department Senator Helms is unbeaten.
Surely, the persistent Mr. Gantt has had many worthwhile endeavors in the past, having been narrowly defeated by Sue Myrick
(the most personable woman in Charlotte) for Mayor and having almost established a minority television station in North Carolina, at
a handsome profit. (We'd like to acknowledge that the idea for the previous sentence was derived from the character of
the brave Sir Robin in Monty Python’s “Holy Grail”).

When it boils down to election day (already passed to be sure) we are confident that the overwhelming superiority of
Senator Helms on such issues as apple pie, motherhood, and communists will secure his victory. But if the worst should
happen, and Senator Helms should return to pursue his retirement in conservative bliss, we take heart in the even older
adage “You deserve what you get.”

Sincerely,

SETH J. MCLAUGHLIN and JEREMY K. KINNER
