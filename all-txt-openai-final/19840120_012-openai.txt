YOUR LAST 2 YEARS OF COLLEGE COULD BE YOUR FIRST 2 YEARS OF MANAGEMENT.

The Army ROTC 2-year program trains you to become an officer for a modern organization — today’s Army — which
also includes the Army Reserve and Army National Guard.

An officer who is not only a leader of men, but a manager of money and materials as well.

That's why one of the things you'll learn in our 2-year program is management training skills.

Your training will start the summer after your sophomore year, at a six-week Army ROTC Basic Camp.

You'll earn over $400 for attending Basic Camp. And up to $1,000 for each of your last 2 years of
Army ROTC.

But the biggest reward comes on graduation day. That's when you receive both a degree in your chosen major and
a commission. And join the Army management team.
