The semi-finals for the intercollegiate debate were held in the society halls Monday night, at which time six were selected for the final contest two weeks hence. The proposed League of Nations was the query discussed, and many were the advantages of the measure. In the Phi Society, the affirmative was upheld by Chalmers, Spence, Roberts, Lilly, Hall, and Hamilton, while Currie, with a combination of forceful argument and appeals to patriotism, urged that the League in question was out of consideration. The decision committee, composed of Dr. J. M. Douglas, Professor Woods, and Mr. Miles, decided that Hall, Lilly, and Currie, with Chalmers as alternate, should represent the Phi Society at the final contest.

With the Eu’s, the sides were more evenly divided. Craig, Geo. Robson, Liston, and Matthews argued that the proposed League is practical, is necessary, and would extend the Monroe Doctrine. Woods, McGirt, and Flinn contended that the League was not practical, was not the best plan, and would lead to the surrendering of American rights. The judges, Dr. Richards, Professor Reid, and Mr. Jackson, selected Flinn, McGirt, and Craig as winners, with Woods as alternate.

He started competitive games among them and stated that they enjoyed them very much. When the Americans came, the French officers objected to their carelessness of property, but as Dr. Lingle said, the Sammies came to save France from the Hun and not to count the cost.
