**The Davidsonian Vol. LXIV, No. Thirteen**

The College Union Board will hold the first of a series of workshops to increase the variety and effectiveness of
Union programs Saturday, Jan. 18, at Erwin Lodge. Board members will consider methods for innovative programming and plan the opening
of the new Grey Union.

The first workshop has two primary goals, according to Union Board President Richard Wassen. First, an effort will be made
to delineate each person’s job and to explain how each job relates to other Union work. Secondly, Wassen hopes that
the workshop will be the beginning of a group solidarity among students and staff at the Union.

“This workshop is the first of many,” explained Wassen. “We want to encourage discussions, brainstorming, and most importantly, we want
to move step by step, establishing a basis and moving on from there, to avoid jumping ahead of ourselves.”

But the spirit Wassen hopes to encourage is not limited to a workshop format. “Instead of a workshop, sometime we
might all go into Charlotte for dinner.”

Wassen, while trying to maintain the impetus of present Union activities, has his eye on the months ahead and plans
for the new Union. Specifically, he hopes to expand the number of speakers and symposiums, to provide nightly activity at
the club in the Grey Union, and to renew the Hungry I on a steady basis.

“I want to start working on having an artist or speaker come and stay an extended time,” Wassen said. Facilities
in the new Union will make this possible. “It is important to remember that this is not a student Union—it’s
a college Union. We want to get faculty and the community involved.”

Wassen stressed the need for more student involvement. “The new Union will be a real active place. We’re going to
need more people to work with us. Along with the work, there is a certain amount of privilege and fun
when working with the Union. If students care enough and show that they care enough, we can get into the
Union soon,” Wassen emphasized.

Students particularly are needed to help on various committees, planning new activities and bringing varied speakers to Davidson. Wassen commended
Physical Plant Director Grover C. Meetze Jr. for his concern with the renovation of the Grey building. Meetze’s interest and
imaginative ideas will help to make the Union an exciting, useful place, according to Wassen.

The Union will continue activities over the next few months while developing others for the renovated facility. “We want to
keep the concerts going,” Wassen said. Also, the pop films and the fine films will continue. However, he expressed caution
about the Union over-extending itself during the period of changing buildings.

Wassen was hesitant to point to a certain time that the Grey building will be finished. He said that it
will certainly be finished by the end of the year. “I hope that we can begin moving during the spring,”
he said.

The workshop will begin at 8:30 Saturday morning and will run until about 2 p.m. Wassen encourages any students who
are interested in working with the Union to contact him, Pat Hudson, or Marc Menchel.

**Annual Fund Giving Reaches New Level**

By BRUCE CORSER

In spite of the current economic squeeze, Davidson’s Annual Fund has thus far realized an unprecedented level of giving. Director
of Alumni Relations and the Annual Fund Howard Arbuckle indicated that alumni, parents, and other friends of the college have
already contributed $116,000 this year toward the $300,000 goal.

**Under McFarland’s Stone Proposal**

The SGA Senate voted to support the Physical Education Department’s proposal to reform the Physical Education requirement in last Thursday’s
meeting.

**New Senators**

In last Tuesday's campus-wide elections, each class chose its president and two other class senators. The following people were elected:

Class of ’76
- Martin Eakes (President)
- John Guthrie
- Rick Roylance

Class of ’77
- Bo Baskin (President)
- Dana English
- Tony SnowClass of ’78

Steve Smith (President)
Roger Brown (Director of Physical Education)
Chip Stone presented the proposal modifying the present requirement to two team sports instead of one at the student option,
and allowing credit for IMAC and Club Sport participation.

McFarland year’s giving at the same time amounted to $103,000. The contributors to the Annual Fund for 1973-74 included 38.9
percent of living alumni. Arbuckle expressed optimism that Davidson would exceed that percentage this year. “Only about 40 schools in
the country can claim a level of giving in excess of 40 percent,” he said. “We want to join that
select circle.” At this point, 924 donors have contributed to the college.

Stone stated that the recent self-study calling for the abolition of the requirement is faulty since, “At no time was
an attempt made to get the help of the athletics department with the self-study.” He added that student help has
been received with his proposal.

Senator Mark Rabil presented a proposal calling for the total elimination of all Physical Education requirements. Rabil added that reasons
for the requirements were either not being met, or they would be met just as well without the requirements, particularly
pointing out the large amount of intramural and club sport participation. Stone stated that, “If there were top-notch facilities the
people would be more apt to participate. The student body will support a good program.” Stone went on to add
that the major fault with the present program is inadequate facilities, and the problem of not having the requirements specifically
stated, or the ability to follow them with the present staff.

Senator Rabil stated that the present system has been unsuccessful, but he felt the best solution would be the total
abolition of the requirement. He added that the poll taken of student views of the requirement is wrong due to
the wording. Stone stated that the goal of the requirement is “to introduce students to as many activities as possible,
and then provide training so the students will participate in these activities after they are out of Davidson.”

An amendment to raise possible inter-collegiate credit to two was passed 14-0-1. An amendment to raise possible intramural credit to
two was defeated 5-9-1. Rabil then proposed a motion to eliminate the requirement if the system did not prove workable
after three years. The motion was defeated 6-8-2. The Athletic Department’s proposal was passed 13-2-1. “After working with the Athletic
Department on their proposal, I would like to say they are more responsive to student needs than the Senate,” Rabil
said.

Alumni Leadership

This group includes 20 who have qualified for the Ne Ultra society by giving over $1,000 and 263 individuals who
have become Davidson Associates by contributing between $100 and $1,000. These totals are also higher than last year at the
same time.

Last Saturday the yearly meeting of the class chairmen for the Annual Fund was held. This get-together represents the kickoff
of the campaign to solicit contributions and provides an opportunity for the chairmen to reacquaint themselves with the college and
student body. Among the highlights of the meeting was Ross Smythe’s report on last year’s successful fund-drive. Smythe headed the
drive for 1973-74 and was succeeded by James A. McFarland ’52, the present Annual Fund Chairman. Director of the Library
Chalmers Davidson also gave a talk on the history of philanthropy at the college. He humorously described Davidson’s origins as
a manual-labor institution in which the students worked off their tuition. Speaking in reference to the talk, Arbuckle commented that
Davidson literally begged its way into existence and has been begging ever since.

Seemingly, the general feeling of the administration about the Annual Fund is one of optimism. Assistant to the President Jerry
Godbehere said that he was hopeful that Davidson could cope with the current rate of inflation. In a similar vein,
Arbuckle said that this would be a year of testing for the Annual Fund but was encouraged by the progress
so far. In any case, the fund will continue to remain an important source of income for the college.
