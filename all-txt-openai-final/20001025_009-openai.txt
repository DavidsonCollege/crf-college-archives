In September, U.S. News and World Report published its annual college rankings issue. Colleges and universities around the country flocked to newsstands to see where they stood among other American institutions of higher education. These rankings have been criticized, disavowed, and deemed unimportant by college and university admissions personnel nationwide. However, the underlying truth is that these rankings do matter and are used as leverage by schools of higher education in helping students finally decide where to spend four years of their life. Even Davidson, a school that prides itself, I believe, on being modest in its presentation to prospective students, focuses on these rankings.

The point of this article is not to say that our admissions office has been so influenced by the rankings in such a way to ignore what is most appealing about Davidson. This fall’s edition of the Davidson Journal clearly demonstrates this point, as do President Vagt’s remarks at the Alumni Leadership Conference Dinner, which I attended during Homecoming Weekend. Both the Journal and the President focused on important and distinctive characteristics that set Davidson apart. Those characteristics include the fact that Davidson is private, it is a liberal arts college, it is extremely strong academically, it is a school where hard work is necessary and valued, and it is home to an outstanding faculty. Other important qualities noted were Davidson’s location, its facilities, and the fact that Davidson students participate in Division I athletics. I definitely agree with emphasizing such characteristics. They have influenced mine and hundreds of other students' decisions to attend this very fine institution.

These characteristics distinctly represent what Davidson is. However, I feel that Davidson does not do a good enough job promoting perhaps its strongest and most appealing characteristic - who Davidson is. Who are we [Davidson]? We are far above anything else a community. This word, community, must be given greater consideration in order to demonstrate how important it is to this institution and its staff and students. We are a community where individual learning and desire are encouraged. We are a community of honor. Academics and honor clearly lie at the core of this institution.

At this year’s Alumni Leadership Conference Dinner, the new executive board of the Davidson Alumni Association was inaugurated. The new president, Michael Deese, made a brief, but wonderful, speech.

**Students should limit rec time on network**

You are probably frustrated, as are many of your fellow students, faculty, and staff, by the slow response on the Internet. The problem is simple to state, but not simple to correct. Our links to the Internet are jammed most of the day. Measures to correct the problem are very expensive, except for one. Would you agree to use the Internet for recreation (MP3 downloads, Web-Radio, etc.) only at off hours? It will make a difference. We'll all see the benefit if you encourage your friends and limit your use during these hours: Sunday, noon to midnight; Monday through Thursday, 7 am to midnight; and Friday, 7 am to 6 pm. Recreational use is fine, but it has begun to interfere with teaching and learning. Will you help make the Internet more usable for everybody during class and study hours? Cooperating, not regulating, is the Davidson way to solve this problem.

**Emotional testimony fails to persuade**

On Monday night in the 900 Room, Stephanie Mueller of the National Abortion Federation delivered a speech entitled “The Truth About Abortion.” I found it hard to believe, however, that her goal was to present the “truth” of abortion considering her lecture was anemic of facts and statistics. On the contrary, her presentation focused on the emotional testimony of two women who chose abortion in the third trimester because of medical complications, using these tragic testimonies to justify abortion. Mueller ignored the fact that in America between 1965-1996 over 486,000,000 babies have been killed from surgical and chemical abortions (American Life League). Mueller did admit that 500 women in the last year had abortions in the third trimester, but she conveniently failed to mention that 1,600,000 women have surgical abortions annually.

Mueller adamantly argued women should have the right to choose the most beneficial option for them after conception has occurred. I agree that freedom is of the utmost importance, but I think the right to life precedes all other freedoms. Dr. Jerome Lejeune, a famous French geneticist, defines a human being as “the he/she who belongs to our species... no matter the amount of kilograms and no matter the amount of differentiation of tissue.” Within 24 hours of when the sperm touches the ova, two sets of 23 chromosomes are present, containing all of the information concerning the individual’s sex, hair, eye, and skin color, physical structure, and facial features. If Mueller really wanted to present the truth, she should have honestly revealed the facts about the indisputable evidence of embryonic development and allowed the audience to decide when a life is a life.

My favorite part of Mueller’s presentation was when someone asked her if she believed a doctor should kill a baby if it somehow survived the attempted abortion, and she replied that it would be “unethical” to kill the baby outside of the womb. Does our environment define who we are? What makes it “ethical” to abort a baby inside the womb but “unethical” when removed? In attempting to present truth, one should present facts, data, and statistics from both sides of an argument, not emotional testimonies and enigmatic replies to questions demanding uncomfortable answers.

that I feel gets at what is most important about Davidson. He stated, “I submit to you that there is something even more fundamental about Davidson... In my view, that ‘something’ is Davidson’s internal focus upon honor and integrity as vital components of study, learning, service, and leadership. This is what, to me, sets Davidson apart.” First of all, I want to say to Mr. Deese, “Well done.” Second, I would take his sentiments one step further to emphasize something just as important - the human quality that is so evident. What is this human quality? It is the kindness of Davidson students. It is the kindness of the faculty who care not just about their student’s academics, but about their wellbeing. It is the kind hello from students or staff that greets all visitors to this campus. It is the students who help each other endure the stressful times and enjoy the fun times. It is the fact that Davidson is a place where help is never far away. It is the reality that Davidson is a caring community where not only your mind is nurtured, but your heart and spirit are as well. I know that it is not easy nor simple to illustrate this quality to prospective students. However, if we ignore this aspect - the human aspect - I feel we are ignoring perhaps the most essential component of the Davidson experience. Davidson definitely strives and is successful in educating the whole person. While this is not a cause for complacency, it is definitely a cause for celebration. We must celebrate by making it clearly known across the country and the world that one who attends Davidson is supported, acknowledged, and cared for in a unique and distinctive manner - a manner that clearly sets Davidson apart.

The faithful and the fanatics - God, save us from religious extremism

Early this semester, I noticed an amusing yet intriguing bit of graffiti in the Outpost. It said, “God, protect me from your followers.” Interesting, I thought to myself, that someone had the audacity (or, perhaps, temerity) to do this at a conservative, southern, Presbyterian institution. I was pleasantly surprised at Davidson. I also should have known it was too good to last. Recently, I noticed that someone had drawn a line through the word “God” and replaced it with “Jove.” Through reading the Davidsonian, I became aware that a freshman named John Pitt had written that it offended his religious sensibilities. A little later, the phrase was mysteriously mutilated into what it is today. I write this not to attack John Pitt, the person, but to attack the mentality he possesses that made him write that letter of complaint to the Davidsonian. From the raging homosexuality debate, I have become disturbingly aware that there are several John Pitts within this astute student body that are studying for a degree in “Liberal” Arts. But damn it, the sentence is legitimate. Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young sing, “Too many people have lied in the name of Christ for anyone to hear the call; so many people have died in the name of love.” From the Crusades to the Inquisition and from Islamic jihads to Osama bin Laden’s fatwa to kill all Americans, enough crimes against humanity have been committed in the name of religion that make such a statement extremely valid. And it does not apply only to Christians. We need to draw a line somewhere, folks. What if all the Muslims in Davidson were to demand that Vail Commons stop serving pepperoni or bacon; or that Patterson Court ban the presence of alcohol at their parties? These are far worse offenses to Islam than irreverent graffiti is to Christianity. Such silliness has to stop. One can always look at it and say, “It’s just graffiti.” It should simply be taken with the pinch of salt it merits and nothing else. But John Pitt apparently took it seriously. Thus, since he chose to dignify it, I argue that it is eminently justifiable for some people to ask for “protection” from fanatical followers of God. Fanatics always amuse me because I’m never sure that they fully believe what they are so vociferously propagating. I may not have understood everything in Robert Pirsig’s “Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance” - that landmark book that brings abstract philosophy to the layman — but I did get this: “you are never fanatically dedicated to something you have complete confidence in... when people are fanatically dedicated to something, it is because their validity or dogmas or goals are always in doubt.” Very true. My biggest passion is a game called cricket. To the unaware, cricket is the game from which baseball was invented and which in South Asia is almost a religion. There, it has a following so frenzied that it makes the Latin American passion for soccer seem apathetic. If you think that the assassination of the Colombian who shot an own-goal in the World Cup was drastic, then you ain’t seen nothing yet. I could tell you stories about cricket fans that would make your blood curdle. But I digress. My point is that no matter how much anyone criticizes or makes fun of cricket (saying it is too slow, too boring etc), it will never annoy me. For the simple reason that I am secure in my belief. People of faith shouldn’t be any different. John Pitt needn’t feel so insecure about his religion that he demands that the graffiti be erased. God knows there are enough people on this campus who feel as strongly as he does about Christianity that he will always find people in his camp (e.g. the atrociously patronizing Christians who love homosexuals but condemn homosexuality). However, I do think that the John Pitts of Davidson have a problem when it comes to their own strength of belief about God and Christianity. As for whoever is responsible for having the graffiti painted over, that they couldn’t be open-minded about something as silly as graffiti is the biggest of all.
