reproduce about one half of the tonal range that FM can.”

Continued Smith, who has had three years of professional engineering experience, “The fluorescent lighting inside and outside of the dorms interferes with AM reception. Anybody who has tried to listen to an AM radio in the dorm is probably aware of how very much AM signal interference there is.”

Smith added, “To make sure everybody could receive the AM carrier-current signal would require buying and installing better equipment than the College now has. Even then the reception would not be good. In general, I would say carrier-current is not a viable or practical alternative to the FM we now have.”

Lawrimore acknowledged that construction costs of the new station would run between $100,000 and $200,000, according to estimates he has received from other radio stations and professional electronics engineers.

“Hopefully the increase in power would be financed through grants from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a fund drive in the Charlotte area, contributions from other individuals in the area interested in our station, and through grants from foundations,” stated Spencer.

One of the four full-time employees of WRFK at Union Seminary, Dick Morgan, said that this year the WRFK budget allotment is $70,000, which is initially underwritten by the seminary. The station then repays the seminary as much of that allotment as it can through the contributions and grants it receives.

Morgan, who is in charge of fund raising for WRFK, says that getting businesses to underwrite programs has been especially difficult in recent months. As a consequence, less than the hoped-for $15,000 may actually be solicited. He also admits that the salaries of the full-time staffers “are nothing fantastic” with the budget of $70,000 covering all production and operation costs as well as the salaries at the station.

At this time there are four full-time, two part-time, and no students working at WRFK. Morgan explained that six people can run the station because it is automated. “But,” adds Morgan, “before the station was automated it was operated by an even smaller staff.”

In the opinion of S.G.A. President Blain Butner, “Going from the current ten-watt operation to a 50,000-watt professionally directed station would be comparable to converting THE DAVIDSONIAN into the Davidson Update. The former is a student-run news publication while the latter is a part of the College’s professionally run public relations program.”

Wilensky posed two questions concerning the issue. “Would a return to AM carrier-current broadcasting, with its inherently lower quality reception, suit student needs for a medium through which to express their creative tastes? Also, just how much student input could there be and would there be at a 50,000-watt Davidson College station?

As it now stands, programming at the 50,000-watt facility would be primarily classical music and educational programming, such as foreign language broadcasts, campus lectures, and tapes prepared by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Also, area news and Davidson College athletic events would be covered.

“No student input has gone into the decision-making process as of yet. Perhaps we need to explain that we want our viewpoint heard,” Wilensky concluded.
