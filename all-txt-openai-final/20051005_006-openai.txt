### International students adjust to college life

By KATIE HUNTER

To many students, the idea of “studying abroad” often produces exotic images of distant locations, where one can experience life with people and cultures much different from their own. Caught up in these overseas fantasies, Davidson students often forget that their own college serves as a foreign study site for over 50 international students, who hail from many far-off and fascinating places.

Ranging from Quito to Mumbai, the hometowns of Davidson international students span the globe, encompassing an inestimable variety of cultures and ethnicities. How these students assimilate into life at Davidson is its own story.

Before starting classes, international students are required to come for International Student Orientation (ISO), a four-day long program meant to help them adapt to American life and form a support system within the campus and community. Though much of what goes on concerns administrative issues like social security numbers and immigration regulations, a large component of ISO includes “providing a time for people to talk about culture shock, get over jet lag, and connect with each other,” according to International Student Advisor Anna Marie Siegel.

Davidson also coordinates an international student host-family program, which Siegel believes “helps the students adjust to life in the States upon arrival, since the families pick them up at the airport and often house them the first night.”

Maria Jose Mejia ’09, from Quito, Ecuador, believes in the importance of these programs. “The ISO and my host family have become a great source of support,” she states. “I feel that it has made my transition to college life so much easier because of the relationships I’ve built through them.”

Jennifer Bienert, a 22-year-old German exchange student from the University of Würzburg, thinks “having a host family is great, because you feel like you took some part of your family with you to America.” Bienert, however, found Davidson’s general Freshman Orientation to be “a little boring,” because she and other one-year exchange students “were left out of the activities planned by freshmen halls.”

“I still find it strange that we have the same class two or three times a week, and only four courses,” says Bienert. “In Germany, we usually have between eight and twelve different courses, but each one only once a week.” Bienert also said that the workload is “much, much greater” here than at her university, but that the quality of courses at Davidson “is better.”

Mejia admits that it has been tricky to “manage time wisely,” but she maintains that overall, Davidson’s international students do not encounter many problems when it comes to campus acceptance and inclusion. Many, like Mejia, have forged strong relationships with both American and other international students. “I hang out with my friends from the Odyssey, my hall-mates, and my international friends,” she states, “and I have made friends with people from other groups too.”

Valencia maintains that her best friends here, and probably the closest friends she’s ever had, are all American. The cultural gaps are there, but she thinks it just makes it even more interesting.Even though her friends back home felt as if "the cultures were too different" for her to form close relationships with Americans, Ana Cristina Valencia ’08, a fellow Ecuadorian student, believes ISO “makes it easy for international students to segregate themselves. It is easier to keep hanging out with the friends you first made when you came here, especially if they were part of a support network when you most needed it,” she says, “but you are also missing out on many great relationships with Americans. My best friends here, and probably the closest friends I’ve ever had, are all American. The cultural gaps are there, but I think it just makes it even more interesting.”

It has proven a little more difficult for some of the international students to adjust to other aspects of Davidson. International students also have to adjust to different kinds of food and to a new roommate, which might present some digestive and cultural conflicts. For Nicolas Cisneros ’09, the overall adaptation to cultural differences has been challenging, because “back home in Quito, values about family, love, and relationships are different.” He also finds that “some American people are very open-minded and accepting,” but that “others are close-minded and try to keep themselves within a comfort zone.”

One way for the campus to promote acceptance, he suggests, is for the Admissions Office to recruit more international students. If there were a larger foreign student contingent at Davidson, overall campus integration and acceptance of international students might be made easier and more natural. Valencia admits that if she were American, “it would take me a long time before I ‘break the order’ and go sit in the middle of the international table at Commons. I think it’s easier for us as internationals to make that first step because we’ve already moved to a place outside of our comfort zone, and we are not as caught up in stereotypes,” she said.

By appreciating newfound opportunities at Davidson, many international students have come to view the adjustment process in a positive light. Bienert finds “all the possibilities of sports, clubs, and associations on campus” to be attractive, while Valencia values campus safety measures and the efficiency of systems here compared to those in Ecuador. “For the most part, things here actually work the way they are supposed to work and people follow the law.”

As far as encountering labels and prejudices, Valencia states, “I think in the end that’s the whole point of being here. If there is a stereotype about Latin Americans or Ecuadorians that I don’t agree with, then the best thing I can do is get out and show that it isn’t always true. I’m glad I can say that I haven’t felt discriminated against at all here at Davidson, but it is different outside the bubble.”
