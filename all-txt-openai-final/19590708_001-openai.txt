Davidson College, Davidson, N.C. Jul 8, 1959 Vol. 5

To those of you who are just arriving at Davidson College for a summer's fun and frolic plus Q.P.'s and
Hours, we, the old-timers, welcome you.

We hope all of you make A's and B's and yet enjoy yourselves doing it. Don't laugh - it's possible.

#### ACTIVITIES

For your enjoyment and relaxation, the Union is open until 10:30 p.m. every night except Wednesday and Saturday when it
stays open ‘til 11:00, for T.V. watchers and bridge players. Many new and interesting games have been added to the
Union's stockpile (See Issue #2).

The Snack Bar is remaining open on Saturday nights for the convenience of those who want to condition themselves to
studying over the weekends and/or those without transportation to more colorful houses of epicurean delights! (Whut?)

#### IS YOUR CAR DIRTY?

If this question is answered in the affirmative (that is; YES!) you are now invited to use the facilities of
Davidson College (at no extra charge). The water spout on FRATERNITY ROW is now open for the student body to
use to clean their automobiles. First come, first served. (Bring your own hose!)

Don't know whether you've noticed it or not, Joe, but they've taken the sex out of Smoothy's secretary lately...

oh, well...

#### DANCE! DANCE! DANCE!

For those of you who were (un)fortunate enough to miss the last issue of this paper, it is my pleasure
to announce that there is to be a big DANCE on the weekend of JULY 18th.

The dance is to be held on campus, in fact, on the porch of the College Union and due to
the planning of Lucia Lummus, Gwen Jordan, and George Kirkpatrick, it promises to be a good one. The PEPTOLES BAND
is going to be here plus a vast array of girls. Not only will the bare essentials be provided (Girls
and Music) but also refreshments and decorations that are being planned by our co-eds.

Ed. note: For those of you who did read last week's issue, I'm pushing this dance because I feel it's
going to be a good one. So, plan to come and bring your date, too. Naturally, things worth having are
worth paying for so—in order that those who are skeptics will be relieved, the dance is going to be a
financial investment on a break-even basis... Tickets go on sale at the end of this week; Stag $1.00, Date $1.50.

#### COMPETITION, I RECKON:

It seems there's a bit of activity going on down at the tennis courts and up at the ping pong
tables. I think Hog's a bit confused though, just saw him heading for the tennis courts with a paddle. Seriously,
the TENNIS TOURNAMENT (Brit. spelling) began today and the PING PONG TOUR. (won't try this time) will reach the final
rounds near the middle of next week. Roughly, this means that those who want to enter better get on the
ball, and those who are already entered better get down to playing. Be sure to consult the Union Bulletin Board
for times and pairings. And the boys could use some spectators, too.
