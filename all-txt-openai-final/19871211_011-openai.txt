Robert Nesbit

The Adventures of Things Weren't Going Good at Davidson. He had recently been plagued by nightmares involving hooded men burning an organic in his front yard. He would wake, only to find various anti-carrot messages on his door.

"Hey Bob, is it true that carrots have big stalks?"

"No! No!"

"Carrot scraper! Help!"

"Not the way I do!"

Victim of carrot

"You must like fried cabbage. All carrots do!"

He found he was accepted into the school of vegetables. He became self-conscious about being the only carrot in school. He felt he stuck out like a sore thumb because he was a carrot. And to add insult to injury, Bob was criticized by some for asking the college for a carrot recruiting weekend.

"Have you ever considered a carrot recruiting weekend?"

"Welcome to Davidson College."

"And the moral of the story is..."

"I bet Bob plays some unreal baseball. He's shaped like a bat, you know."
