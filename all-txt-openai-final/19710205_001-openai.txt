**SGA Calls New Election For V-P**
By JOE SMITH
Associate Editor

By a vote of nine to four, the SGA Senate voted to have the runoff election for SGA Vice President
held over again due to the excessive carelessness with which that election was conducted. The action was prompted by a
petition signed by 209 students, requesting that the election be reheld because of improper procedures used in the management of
that election. According to Mark Deininger, who presented the petition to the Senate, the basis of the request was not
that vote fraud had occurred, but that: (1) no list of those voting was kept, so that an accurate recount
was not possible, and (2) the polling place was not manned by a voting official at several times during the
day.

Junior Senator Bill Alexander, who was defeated in the contested election by eight votes, said that he was bringing the
matter to the Senate so that that body could act as an impartial judge of the matter. He said that
the body was empowered to act in that the Elections Board, which is responsible for SGA elections, is under the
supervision of the Senate.

With regard to the recount issue, Coble pointed out that a number of elections have been held over the past
few years without the use of a sheet for voter's signatures. He said that because of this and because there
is no specific election procedure outlined in the SGA Constitution, the recount issue was invalid.

**Terry Sees Improvement In Freshman Assignment**
By ALEC HOON
News Editor

“We are trying to make communications between freshmen and fraternities as easy as possible.” Thus spoke Dean of Students William
Terry of his efforts to make the new social system a workable entity at Davidson. It is Terry’s job to
juggle all the variables—the attitudes of freshmen, fraternity brothers, the administration, and the trustees—and create a situation agreeable to all.

To encourage better participation by the freshmen in the new social system, the random assignment has been altered so that
groups of freshmen from the same hall can go together to the various houses to eat and socialize.

Davidson College may be becoming the new Hollywood as students film their own movies as Gray Wilson reports on page

In regard to this change, Terry said, “After consulting hall counselors, students, and members of the Committee of Eighteen, we
thought that the new process was a better way. In the old assignment, freshmen were often placed in houses where
they didn’t even know the other freshmen. It was tough enough for the freshmen to become acquainted with each other,
much less to be able to meet the various fraternity brothers.

“In the new assignment, the freshmen all know each other, and their hall counselor (the one responsible for taking them
to their fraternity) is whenever possible a brother in the house to which he is taking them.”

Analyzing the possibility for a compromise between the fraternity court and the trustees, Terry stated, “I do not feel that
the trustees will go back on their decision.” However, he did offer one consolation to the fraternities going off campus.
He said that he did not anticipate the college taking any legal action to prevent a fraternity from moving off
campus.

Terry spoke with cautious optimism touched with a note of warning about his feelings on the possible success of self-selection.
“I have seen a lot of apathy among freshmen. I think that this is a result of...a lack of security
and confusion. I believe that this is a normal response for a class placed in this situation. While I don't
think that it is going to be easy, I feel that eventually the new (See TERRY, Page 2) and (2)

Coble went on to give some background information on the handling of the situation as of the meeting. He said
that Allen Peterson, senior class president and chairman of the Elections Board, had contacted him this week as to the
possibility that voting irregularities had occurred. Peterson, said Coble, had told him that the Elections Board had agreed that three
confessions of voting fraud would invalidate the election, and that these admissions of guilt would not be prosecuted. Coble said
that he would report any violators to the Regulations Court for appropriate action. He pointed out that the SGA Constitution
placed voting fraud under the jurisdiction of that court.

Danny Clodfelter, SGA president-elect and a member of the Elections Board, added that the Jurisdiction Committee (composed of the Dean
of Students, Chairman of the Honor Court, and Chairman of the Regulations Court) could conceivably place multiple voting under the
jurisdiction of the Honor Court. He went on to point out that he had been consulted about neither voting policy
nor the possibility of irregularities, and that, to his knowledge, the Elections Board had made no decision in the matter
at hand. Allen Peterson and Gerry Bello, the other members of the Board, were not present at the meeting to
clear up the question of responsibility.

Junior Senator Frank Dorms and Dana said that the issue was not actual voting fraud, but the standards of irregularity
which govern SGA elections at Davidson. He maintained that ‘excessive carelessness’ in the handling of elections should be considered an
irregularity. He went on to say that, inasmuch as the present situation could be rectified, the election should be held
again.

Freshman Senator Dan Thorne forwarded a resolution that the election be re-held. After discussion, especially about the nature of irregularities
in voting procedure, the resolution was passed by a vote of nine to four. Both Alexander and Sophomore Class President
Bob Edmunds, winner of the contested race, abstained. Eight senators were absent. In addition to this new election, Honor Court
elections for the class of '74 will be held again also because of errors made in the actual marking of
the ballots.

In a short valedictory, President Coble said that it had been a good year, pointing to the new social system,
the increased number of speakers, self-scheduled exams, and the course evaluation handbook as examples of success. He said that the
most significant failures had been in the areas of open student representation on the Admissions Committee. He also noted that
the real successes of the Senate had been in selling the concept of community and in increasing interest in student
government among the student body.

Clodfelter Discusses Plans

ED. NOTE: The following interview with SGA President-elect Danny Clodfelter was conducted by Assistant Managing Editor Robert Touchton.

What do you consider the greatest challenge to the SGA?

To translate the basis of student influence from amateur lobbying to direct participation in decisions affecting student life, academic, social,
and financial.

What do you want most to accomplish during your administration?

Not a list of promises, only a set of ideal goals: meet the ‘greatest challenge’ (above); get the student body
through the transition period with the new social system; and for the first time, open student eyes to the importance
of financial policies in such matters as off-campus housing and co-education.

Do you plan to inform the student body in advance of issues to be considered at Wednesday senate meetings and
to keep the students informed of action taken at meetings?

Amen, brother, insofar as THE DAVIDSONIAN and WDAV can cooperate. I also hope to be able to encourage more students
to attend Senate and committee meetings. Mass support presupposes possession of information.

Do you support a compromise on the fraternity question—an 8-4 system or simply the right of students to eat in
fraternity houses off campus? If so, how much of a “compromise” do you mean by allowing selective national fraternities to
remain on campus?

If by compromise you mean allowing selective national fraternities to remain on campus, the answer is no. I intend to
support the right of fraternities that wish to operate eating facilities off campus as well as the right of individuals
who wish to remain “independent” of any of the college-sponsored options. The college is already taking steps with regard to
“fine-tuning” of the random assignment plan.

Explain the proposal for a “College Council” and where you stand on it.

Simply stated, the College Council reflects a more realistic allocation of decision-making responsibilities in terms of what various groups have
at stake here. It is an idea I have been mulling over since the mid-fall term and one which I
see as having potential for stabilizing the basis of student power. We will definitely push the idea.
