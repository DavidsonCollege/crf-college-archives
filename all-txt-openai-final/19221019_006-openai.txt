Religious Activities

MINISTERIAL BAND HOLDS USUAL MEETING

The Ministerial Band held its regular weekly meeting Sunday in Shearer Hall and was addressed by Professor Foreman. He delivered a stirring heart-to-heart talk to the members and each man came away lifted spiritually, mentally, and morally. The song service was led by Bill Baker and much spirit was manifested. Treasurer Harry Russell presented the budget for the coming year. It was pointed out that this budget will put the financial department of the band on a business basis. Secretary Piggie Martin then made an interesting report, telling of his efforts to bring all ministerial candidates on the campus into the band. His work has been successful and the band is growing rapidly each week.

D. ANGUS McBRYDE TALKS TO VOLUNTEER BAND

The Volunteer Band held its regular meeting last Sunday morning in the Y room of the gym. Angus McBryde, the leader, had for his subject, “Foreign Missions.” Various points of the work, the need, and the opportunities were discussed by a few members of the band. Harry Price gave an interesting talk on “The Missionary in China.” He told of their interesting and hard work, yet soul-satisfying work, of their simple, but happy lives—lives made happy by the fact that they were being used for the Master.

MR. MALCOLM LOCKHART IS NEXT “Y” SPEAKER

The Y. M. C. A. has been very fortunate in securing for the “Y” meeting on next Sunday, Mr. Malcolm Lockhart, of Atlanta. Mr. Lockhart is in charge of the campaign for Davidson, with his headquarters at Charlotte. He will be most favorably remembered by the Davidson men as one of the inspiring speakers at the banquet given Davidson students in Charlotte on the occasion of Davidson Day in that city. Mr. Lockhart is very much interested in young people and their education, having two daughters in college, one at Agnes Scott, the other at Flora Macdonald. Despite his pressing business engagements, Mr. Lockhart has expressed his willingness to visit Davidson and speak at this service. Give him a big welcome, Shearer Hall, 6:15 Sunday.

No, just because you run down your heel, you are not necessarily a detective.

DOCTOR HENDERLITE SPEAKS AT VESPER

With Dr. J. H. Henderlite, general secretary of the Gastonia Y. M. C. A., as the speaker, last Sunday’s “Y” vesper service proved to be one of the most interesting and helpful services held this year. Basing his address on the example of Aristides’ companionship with Paul, he forcefully showed that God does not judge men so much by our earthly success and popularity as by their fidelity. His talk in brief follows:

“Aristides, one of the obscure Bible characters, is mentioned only five times in the whole Bible, but each of these times he is with Paul, either on the way to Jerusalem, on the way to Rome as a prisoner, or at other places. Tradition claims that Aristides was with Paul even at his execution. He was the faithful boon companion of the great Paul. Aristides nobly stood the sternest test of integrity of character that can be given to man—that of remaining faithful, though placed in an obscure position. The man who can pass this test will have the right views toward himself, others, and God.

“First, his being a link in the chain of God’s eternal purpose will cause him to rank duty as the greatest word in the English language. Therefore he can be depended upon. No virtue can outshine that of a consciousness of duty done. That is the first step toward greatness.

“Second, the faithful man will never disappoint others. In this day when co-operation is the keynote, every man must do his duty so that others will not be hurt by his failure to do so. On the wall of a great airplane factory are the words, ‘A concealed mistake may cost some brave man his life.’

“Lastly, the man who does his duty does as God wants him to do. Nothing will come short in God’s plan because of his presence. God measures men by fidelity. Just as Aristides was as truly great in his place as Paul was in his, so we can, through fidelity, have it said of us by God, just as David said of Jonathan, ‘Thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.’”

The service was well attended. The music, led by Bascom Sorrels, and assisted by Wallace Purdy at the piano, Graham White and Crane on the violin, and George Dupree, L. B. Finn, and Thompson on cornets, was also good. W. T. Baker presided.

DAVIDSON TEAM TO PLAY WILMINGTON

On November 11th, Armistice Day, the people of Wilmington will be given the treat of seeing a Davidson football team in action. W. M. Shaw, ’10, has gotten together quite a football aggregation out of the Wilmington Light Infantry, and wishes to play a team of his Alma Mater. To this end he has arranged a game with the Wildcat scrubs. The men making this trip will be, in the language of Coach Grey, the Wildcat All-American team, which consists of men who are not making varsity or Freshman trips. There is to be quite a celebration in Wilmington on Armistice Day and the game is booked as a headliner. That week the varsity plays Wofford in Charlotte, while the Freshmen take on N. C. State Fresh at Raleigh. There will be three Wildcat aggregations off the Hill on that date.

A MERRY DRAMA
In Many Acts and Numberless Scenes
By Ibsen Shaw Milne.

Characters:
“Mack” Lennox, a rather prominent senior; he prides himself on the nobbiness of his wardrobe; it is his private opinion that he is a veritable lady-killer.
“Bill” Carroll, his room-mate and a no less prominent junior; in matters of dress, his taste is more conservative and substantial; in regard to his love affairs the old adage, “Still water runs deep,” is applicable.

Act the Fifth, PROPHECY.
Mack—Say, old dear, you should have gone down with us last Saturday—some game.
Bill—Quit yer kiddin’, head colds and football games don’t go together.
Mack—And I'll say Keith’s was good, there was one act—
Bill—Can it, I can’t bear it. What have you there?
Mack—A package.
Bill—Aw say, you’re a bright one, any boob could see that it wasn’t a five-course dinner.
Mack—Well, you see, before we went out to Wearn Field I dropped around to Mellon’s and picked up a couple o’ shirts.
Bill—Open up.
Mack—Aye, aye sir.
Bill—That blue stripe strikes my fancy.
Mack—Righto—Manhattan make and the best of Madras; and son gaze on the cut of the collar.
Bill—But say, I thought that whites were still the thing?
Mack—They are, as a general rule, but Fifth Avenue says “wear a stripe now and then to break the monotony.”
Bill—How about that smaller bundle?
Mack—Socks—Interwoven’s, new silk and wool effects.
Bill—Say they’re the stuff, are they not?—(adv.)
