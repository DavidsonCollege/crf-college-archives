YMCA Discusses Shearer Hall

An interior view of dilapidated, obsolete Shearer Hall is shown in this picture of the old college chapel, now a
band practice room. Shearer Hall stands as an eyesore on the Davidson campus, which is blessed with an ample number
of beautiful neo-classic buildings. This eyesore is one of the oldest buildings on our campus. Though now a gruesome sight,
it was at one time in harmony with other campus architecture.

Davidson College was founded in 1836. In the summer of the following year, construction on a chapel was begun; the
chapel was completed in 1838. The building stood north of and facing the area between the Philanthropic and Eumenean Halls.
The chapel was believed to be located on the highest elevation between the Catawba and Yadkin Rivers. The building was
the College Church and center of campus religious activity until a new church was built in 1885. Classes were held
on the first floor while the second story contained the assembly room. In 1860, old Chambers was completed and became
the center of campus activity. This building burned in 1921, however, and for eight years the old chapel, now called
Shearer Hall, was used again for chapel services and classes. Chambers Building was in use.

In 1901, Dr. John Bunyan Shearer, president of Davidson, remodeled the building and dedicated it to his wife. The building
now bears the inscription: “Erected for the glory of God and dedicated to Lizzie Gessner Shearer by her husband.” The
beautiful antebellum architecture was destroyed, the old portico covered, and the face turned toward the Statesville highway. Dr. Chalmers Davidson,
an authority on the history and architecture of the buildings of Davidson College, remarked: “Dr. Shearer should turn in his
grave for his poor taste.”

Since 1929, Shearer Hall has served as Davidson’s music department. The first floor houses the record and music libraries, three
music rooms, a stock room, and a disgraceful rest room. The upper floor, the chapel, is an orchestra room with
a lovely old pipe organ. The building no longer was in harmony with other campus architecture. The only forms of
interior decoration are the drab, grey walls. The pictures of Dr. Shearer and his wife are the only forms of
interior decoration.

SDA Secretary Will Speak In Chapel

Gordon Graham, national Executive Secretary of Students for Democratic Action, will speak in chapel Tuesday on the subject of student
political movements, both in America and abroad. Students for Democratic Action is a college affiliate of Americans for Democratic Action,
a national organization devoted to liberalism in political, economic, and social matters. Tuesday night at nine o'clock in the Blue
Room of the Union, Mr. Graham will address a meeting of students interested in forming a chapter of SDA at
Davidson. He will explain the principles of SDA and discuss its practical actions in support of liberalism. All students interested
in joining SDA are urged to attend.

Organist To Present Recital In Church

Fenner Douglass, organist of the Oberlin Conservatory faculty, will present a recital at the College Church on Monday evening, April
28, at 8:15 o’clock, the final recital in this year's organ recital series. The program will include works by Bach,
Franck, and Messiaen. Mr. Douglass, associate professor of organ and a member of the Oberlin College Conservatory of Music since
1946, teaches both organ and harpsichord. He has played concerts in principal cities of the U.S. and in recent years
has traveled and studied in Europe, chiefly in Holland, Denmark, and Germany. A master-class, of particular interest to organists and
students, will be conducted by Mr. Douglass at two o'clock Monday afternoon in the church. A clinic fee of one
dollar per person will be charged. A social hour honoring Mr. Douglass will be held in the student lounge of
the church following the recital.

Fine Arts Festival In Full Swing

The Fine Arts Festival is in full swing in what Dr. Purcell calls “the frantic observation of Fine Arts.” The
Fine Arts Festival “is designed to contribute to a more sensitive awareness and a deeper appreciation of the place of
art in our contemporary society.” It “is designed primarily for the student body, which doesn’t attend.” Its purpose is to
exhibit student work in art, drama, and literature and to inspire students to outstanding accomplishments in these fields. The festival
is supervised by a faculty committee consisting of Professors Trakas, Houchens, Satterfield, and Mr. C. Shaw Smith. The festival consists
of contributions from the Art, Drama, and Philosophy Departments, from Sigma Upsilon, Phi Mu Alpha, Alpha Psi Omega, the Red
and Black, and the YMCA.

Effective Citizenship, Special Services, “Y” Publications, and Spiritual Life. The Commission Chairmen, working with variant portions of the total membership,
will be: Deputations, Community Work, Fellowship, Organization and representative, and National and International Relations. The report further stated that the
Cabinet is to meet to consider and discuss only the questions requiring deliberation as an official body. Reports and regular
business will be handled insofar as possible by the Cabinet Chairmen working individually with the Evaluation committee.

Under this new plan, the Cabinet will have 15 members instead of 17 as did this year’s Cabinet.At the front,
its green walls are bare, and the room is scattered with discarded items, including a cat and a stepladder. Quite
run-down and a blemish on the lovely campus with its short coat, Shearer Hall is an embarrassing part of our
campus. If it could be reconstructed as the old chapel, it would complete the scenic old quadrangle. If this cannot
be done, it should be razed to eliminate this mar on an otherwise beautiful campus.

Since spring holidays, Davidson has been immersed. According to Herb Russell, much has been said about correcting the problem, but
no definite plans have been made. Remodeling Shearer Hall would make our entire campus a harmonious community in neoclassic architecture.

Black Masquers, the Band, the Male Chorus, and the Photography Club, and also includes the Artist Series, Vereen Bell Award,
the organ recital series, and special guests whom the committee may invite. Ninety percent of the participants are students, and
two-thirds of the exhibitions are in art and music.

The festival is planned and executed with the effort and expenditure of students and faculty. Given the quality of the
programs and the uniqueness of the opportunity at hand, it is unfortunate and perhaps ironic that the festival is not
given a warmer and wider reception. The program itself consists of Music, English, and other subjects.

The Air Force pilot or navigator is a man of many talents. He is, first of all, a master of
the air—and no finer exists. In addition, he has a firm background in engineering, electronics, astro-navigation, and allied fields. Then,
too, he must show outstanding qualities of initiative, leadership, and self-reliance. He is, in short, a man eminently prepared for
an important career in the new Age of Space. As a college graduate, you will be given priority consideration for
the Air Force Aviation Cadet Program. While openings are limited, you will be tested and advised immediately of qualification status.

Faculty Committee Examines Parties

Dr. William G. McGavock, head of the Faculty Social Life Committee, recently reported on the work the committee has done
with regard to fraternity problems. Dr. McGavock stated that last month Dean Pietenpol asked his committee to study the problem
of Hell Week and the after-dance party situation and to present recommendations to the faculty. This committee has met four
times, including one session with the IFC. The IFC recently took action on the Hell Week question by voting to
abolish it. The Social Life Committee recommended this decision to the faculty. The Committee has been working on the after-dance
party question but has reached no final conclusions. Committee members have been talking to student leaders and other parties to
distinguish between facts and rumors on the after-dance party question. There will be a meeting of the faculty in May.
At that time, the committee will probably make specific recommendations to the faculty.

Mr. Dana's gift is the largest ever made to Davidson by a living person.
