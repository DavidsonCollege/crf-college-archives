**On The Hearing And The Code**

Since the last open Honor Code hearing occurred during the freshman year of the Class of '85, most students had
never had the opportunity to see the Honor Council in action. Videos and simulations are one thing, but this week’s
open hearing was the real thing. The future of a Davidson student’s academic career came into question, and a group
of that student’s peers were faced with the unenviable task of deciding his guilt or innocence. As if that were
not enough, the whole thing took place before 150 faculty and visitors.

The Honor Council found sophomore Jeff Kusch not guilty, so he is not guilty. He should be able to enjoy
the privileges (and, of course, carry the responsibilities) of a Davidson student, without any recriminations from anyone. Though the hearing
was open, the Honor Council members who decided the case saw more evidence than anyone in the audience. No student
or professor, or anyone else, has any right to second-guess the Council’s decision. To do so would damage the students
involved and the idea of the Honor Code itself.

The open hearing also raised questions about disciplinary procedure. The Kusch family has said serious problems exist in the system;
some Council members have said they saw no serious procedural problems. Chances are, the reality lies somewhere in between the
two poles. The problems are not incapacitating, but are serious enough to warrant consideration by the Student Conduct Council. Among
the problems:

— The amount of time allowed between the honor complaints and the resolution of the case needs to be condensed.
Summer elapsed after a complaint but before a charge in the Kusch case; a further four weeks elapsed — at
the defendant’s request — before the hearing. As time passes, however, memories fade, notes disappear, and the ability to uncover
an approximation of the truth gets farther away.

— Hearsay evidence. The idea behind the acceptability of hearsay evidence needs to be explored and explained. Furthermore, defense advisors
and solicitors should be present when a hearsay witness is interviewed, if only for fairness’ sake.

— Professor testimony. Professors ought to be required to testify if their testimony has direct bearing in a case. Academic
deference is nice, but might not be applicable when a student’s future at Davidson is at stake. Otherwise, someone ought
to explain why professors are not required to testify.

These problems do not call into question the foundations of the Honor Code, but as Dean Terry said, “Procedure can
always be improved.” A wholesale rewriting of the Code of Disciplinary Procedure is not in order, but a general tightening
up is. Perhaps even a student’s bill of rights, explicitly stated rather than implicit in the procedure, would be desirable.

Procedure, however, does not account for all the problems the Honor Code and those who uphold it face. Many students
(and parents, perhaps) seem...to hold misconceptions about the theory behind the system. It is not based upon the U.S. courtroom;
highly technical rules of procedure do not exist. It is incumbent upon the Honor Council to engender understanding not only
of the methods of the Code but of the theory as well. It is incumbent upon each student, however, to
seek to understand and be aware of this theory. In any case, students now have an excellent opportunity to express
their concerns or clear up their misconceptions. By next week, the Dean will have designed a method for presenting perceived
problems for discussion to the Student Conduct Council, the body empowered to change the Disciplinary Procedures. The Honor Council, too,
will be addressing its disciplinary procedure, and its officers will be more than willing to answer questions.

LETTERS

The Davidsonian is your chance to make your views known. The opinions section is an open forum available to everyone
who wishes to make a statement about what is important to them. The Davidsonian both encourages and requires your input.
If you feel strongly about any issue of major or personal concern, write it down and present it to a
Davidsonian staff member, or bring it to the paper offices. We encourage input from students, faculty, alumni, and anyone who
reads The Davidsonian. This is your opportunity to speak out to the Davidson College community. We welcome both letters and
opinions articles. Tell us and everyone else what is good, bad, or interesting to you.

The Davidsonian "Opinions" section is the only forum on campus for extended commentary on pertinent issues. We will print opinions
articles on any subject of general interest we receive from the campus community. We adhere to these guidelines:
1) We require that all articles be in our hands at 7 p.m. Monday.
2) We accept typed articles and those written legibly, double-spaced.
3) We require that opinions be signed. We will print unsigned articles only if a compelling reason exists for withholding
the author’s name, and the author is known to either the editor or executive editor.
4) We will not edit opinions for style or content but we reserve the right to edit for rules of
common English. We will inform the author of substantial changes.
5) Since space for Opinions articles is limited, we reserve the right to select articles from those we receive for
publication. We will attempt to print any article we withhold from publication for space reasons the next week.

Letters Policy

The Davidsonian welcomes letters from its readers. We try to print all letters of general interest, but we adhere to
these four guidelines:
1) We require that letters be in our hands by 7 p.m. Tuesday.
2) We require that letters be neatly typed.
3) We require that letters be signed and include the author’s phone number and address. If you have a compelling
reason for us to withhold your name, explain your situation to the editors.
4) We reserve the right not to print letters that:
a) function as advertisements;
b) contain innuendo, off-color slurs, or inside jokes;
c) represent a viewpoint very similar to that expressed in other letters printed on the same topic.
