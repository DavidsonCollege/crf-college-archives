“Deliver dialogue,” he asked.

“Two plus two equals four.”

“That’s not dialogue. I want blood and guts, you know. Real action.”

I pondered for a while. “Susan, that’s not what I want from you. I can find any two-bit sleazy slut
on the street whenever I want. Put your clothes back on.” I sighed.

“That’ll do. It still isn’t good enough. If you want to deliver good dialogue you’ve got to have something important
to say.”

That was just it. I never had anything important to say.

“Let’s see you move.”

I slid to the side a bit and squatted down.

“Choreograph your motions! I don’t want a jellyfish!”

I stood up, slightly embarrassed, and bent over. I pulled my head through my armpits with my toes. That ought
to knock his socks off, I thought.

“Not bad. Not bad.” He was impressed. I could tell. He was stroking the peach fuzz on his chin, so
I knew I couldn’t have been all that bad.

“Sing.”

“What?”

“Dammit, I don’t care. You want the part.”

“Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti Do.”

“Wrong key. Try again.”

“Ave verum corpus natum de Maria Virgine.” My back was pouring with sweat. That was the hardest line I knew
how to sing.

“Good. I like Latin.” He peered at me intensely. “Get another nose,” he said.

I took off my old nose and laid it on the table. It was kind of pug with nostrils big
enough to put my thumb into. I slapped a narrow-nostriled nose onto my face. “Better?”

“Better.”

“Anything else you want changed?”

“Don’t rush me. Hmmm. No. I think that’s all. Next!”

“Wait! Don’t I get the part? What about me?”

“I don’t know, kiddo. The world may not be ready for your type just yet. No one will know how
to raise you. You’ll be a misfit in society.”

“But you’ve got to give me a chance. I can fit in somewhere. Just try me. You’ll see.”

He sighed deeply. “But you’re so...so...”

“Different.” I smiled when I supplied the word. He looked at me and he began to smile too.

“All right. You get the part.”

“Goody! When do I start?”

“Now! Go to black!”

Someone slapped me in my rear. “Ow!” I yelled, but all I heard was the piercing wail of a newborn
baby.

DAVIDSONIAN / Friday 29 January 1982

The Designer

The mother spider spins her web
Of silk and satin
Golden thread...

With strings that touch every branch;

Scent that lures the hungry flies.

A strong and sticky silver line
Numbs the captured prey with shine.
They dangle in cozy grey suits
Drained of their juice.
