tired, see how it refreshes! The Flavor Lasts!

In Class Teams Rounding Into Form.
(Continued from page 1)

Positions on the team, the majority will appear on a football field at Davidson for the first time in the
approaching series. Among them are to be found ex-prep school stars and ex-high school stars galore. There are also to
be found two or three of the mainstays of the scrub team, who will tend to steady the team down.
However, the ability of the team will be tested to the nth degree this week and it remains to be
seen whether it will be found wanting.

Sophs Are Looking Good.
It is really hard to tell whether it is the Varsity or the Sophomore football team that you see on
the campus dodging the trees and hooting the pigskin. They really look like the Varsity squad of last year, having
so many of the scrub team. The practices this past week have been taken up with introducing the new plays
and passes, also with getting the backfield in trim. The prospects for '22’s football season are great and are looking
better every practice. They have the coaching staff of Lafar, McFadden, and Dick. If size is an asset, a few
of the smallest ones may be mentioned—“Slim” Camel and Slender Hamer. If speed is needed, watch “The Prep” school Twins
in action.

And Uncle Sam’s advice is to take a $10,000 policy. How much have you got?

The backfield will be good and the line will be better. You'll have to give it to them, they mean
business. Watch out, Juniors! You can't tame a Wildcat’s playmate. They are lining up as follows: Right end, Roddy, McKeithin;
right tackle, Boyd; right guard, Summers; center, Brice; left guard, Davis, Camel; left tackle, McLaughlin; left end, Phillips; fullback, Bailey,
Ratchford; right half, Irvin, L., Patterson; left half, Bethea; quarterback, Irvin, M., Richards.

Under the coaching of Cassell and Davis, who are experienced Varsity men, the Freshman team is rapidly being whipped into
shape. Dantzler, who starred at Bingham, is the backbone of the backfield. He is a good line plunger and an
excellent tackler. Sorrels, who was a terror to the Varsity last fall with his offensive playing, is the mainstay of
the line. With the exception of him, the line is more or less inexperienced. However, the weight from tackle to
tackle is 180 lbs., so they can be expected to stop most anything. The line-up is not settled, as Davis,
Farley, Adams, and Cooper are doing fine work. Line-up: Dantzler, right half; Wiley, fullback; Lewis, left half; McArn, quarter; Dray,
left end; McCutchen, left tackle; Bradley, left guard; Sorrells, center; Hall, right guard; Crisp, right tackle; Grey, right end.

Polity Club Has Bright Future.
(Continued from page 1)

A student convention is also being planned for the clubs. This will likely be held in Washington sometime during the
spring, and the D.C. club will send one of its members, a Junior preferably. Traveling expenses to this assembly will
be borne by the national organization. The next meeting, second Tuesday in February, presents a promising program: The Japanese Question,
by Oltman; The Balkan Situation, by Foscne; and Digest of Events, by Askew. The last named item is by no
means below the others in importance, it never failing to bring forth smiles as well as the applause of the
club.

The following members of the Junior and Senior classes were unanimously elected to membership in the club: W. H. Miley,
H. B. Brown, Fred Thompson, A. P. Ormand, C. H. Long, W. B. Sullivan, J. T. Cassell, A. F. Fricker.

Dr. Lingle says the Polity Clubs in the larger universities and colleges can be outstripped easily. All behind the Polity
Club, then, and let’s make it hard for the judges to decide who gets that prize!
