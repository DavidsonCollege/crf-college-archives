**DIDI focuses on international development**

The “community” aspect of service at Davidson means much more than it once did, especially as globalization continues to bring
nations and people closer together than ever. Taking their service commitments literally, many Davidson students now cross national borders to
make change in the new “global” community. From interviewing Bolivians about their fight for clean water to researching agricultural practices
in African villages, many students’ recent experiences have helped them learn more about international development—a field that targets third world
countries and attempts to implement sustainable solutions for their growth.

Working in international development, students have the opportunity to improve people’s lives in countries where basic political stability and supportive
social systems often are lacking. Those working in international development, however, must also avoid “placing a large burden on the
lower classes, indigenous populations, and the natural environment,” said Brian Orland ’07. Orland witnessed the effects of poverty and some
of the negative effects of efforts to alleviate it while studying abroad in India last fall. Moved by his experiences,
he helped establish the Davidson International Development Initiative upon his return to campus.

“Through DIDI, we hope to educate the study body about issues involving development, and through this education inspire attention and
action,” he says. Emily Moore ’06, a co-founder of DIDI, says that the organization is planning an international awareness fair
for January. Moore and Orland also plan to attract lecturers and alumni to campus who work in the field of
international development, in order for students to make contacts for internships and employment.

The college recently welcomed two such individuals to campus. Ann Tutwiler ’80, president of the Agriculture and Trade Policy Commission,
prompted students interested in international development to “get a strong background in economics.” Tom Frist ’67, former president of the
International Leprosy Organization, told students that “knowing yourself and what motivates you” is crucial in choosing a career, and that
“language skills” are a necessity when it comes to working with people in developing countries. Both alumni acknowledged the potential
that Orland saw for “doing harm” in international development, like giving so much food aid to a country that it
marginalizes local farmers. They maintained that “working with local people” greatly reduces that threat. Each speaker also advised students to
look into non-governmental organizations, or NGOs, should they be interested in finding employment or internships in the field.

Kendal Stewart ’06 and Laura Beach ’07 are already a step ahead. Both have designed their own International Development majors
through the Center for Interdisciplinary Studies, which requires “taking lots of Anthropology, Political Science, and Economics classes,” states Beach. Beach,
who took a wildlife management course while in Kenya last summer, hopes to get a grant or work for a
volunteer corps upon graduation. “I eventually hope to go to grad school before continuing a career in international development,” she
claims, “but I always want to work at the grassroots level.”

Stewart got that chance this summer, researching the efforts of local citizens to bring potable water into their communities. She
spent three months in the region of Cochabamba on an Abernathy grant, interviewing local residents and NGO workers. “The public
water companies don’t do a good job of providing usable water, so people have to do it themselves,” she explains.
These experiences were preparation for what Stewart hopes will be a career.Working with an NGO in Latin America. "My main
interests are with providing basic necessities, like food and water, to people," she states. Interest in international development seems to
be growing on campus. Ellen Giduz, Director of Career Services, says that the office has received "lots of requests from
students and alumni wishing to contact people in the field" over the past few months. Career Services provides some contact
information through their office and database, as well as guides to careers and internships abroad. It seems as if the
"grassroots" of international development will likely grow as students realize they can unite career and conscience. As Orland puts it,
"the world is changing, but we can influence the quality of that change." "We can facilitate change marked by compassion
and creative solutions."

Restaurant finds warm spot with students

Covering over seven million acres in the Deep South, Kudzu now occupies a coveted spot on Davidson’s Main Street. New
this semester, Kudzu On The Green offers a tasteful dining experience mere yards from campus. Serving basic Southern cuisine with
a classy twist in a casual dining atmosphere, the local restaurant puts no pressure on its patrons to sport a
tie or gown. With a warm ambiance and classic décor, it makes for a great date spot, especially for those
without a car. The hostess’ warm greeting complemented the simple, cozy charm of the restaurant, with its pale green walls
and classic oak bar. We’d made reservations for that Saturday evening, and highly recommend the same for anyone hoping to
get a table on the weekend.

For our first course, we selected a true Southern classic, Shrimp and Grits. Although not a complicated dish, the food
was tastefully presented and plenty for two. The grits were not overly heavy or creamy, and the shrimp were of
a much better quality than those found in the grocery store freezer. Although one reviewer was hesitant to try the
dish for the first time because of its seemingly strange combination, they found it excellent.

The menu featured a variety of entrees, ranging from classic chicken to pasta to steak dishes. Most plates tended to
feature meats and heavy cream sauces, but there were a few lighter fish and vegetarian meals for those seeking other
options. There were about ten to twelve entrees from which to choose, and we eventually settled on the salmon with
fettuccini and asparagus and the duck in fig sauce. Kudzu did not disappoint here either. The duck was served in
a rich fig sauce that complemented the meat’s flavor. Prepared well and very tender, the duck arrived in a large
enough portion to satisfy a hearty appetite. It was served alongside vegetables and a potato cake, which was spongy and
had a poor texture compared to the rest of the meal. Overall, this was the only complaint that could be
said about the duck, which otherwise lived up to and surpassed expectations.

The salmon and fettuccini was served in an alfredo cream sauce, topped off with a few asparagus spears. It was
a fairly basic dish, but was tastefully presented and prepared with fresh ingredients. The sauce was heavy, making the dish
much more than one reviewer could stomach in one sitting. Taking home leftovers, however, was no big problem. With just
a bit of spice, this dish proved to be an elegant spin on a standard fish and pasta dish.

For dessert, we ordered the Key Lime Cheesecake, and again were very impressed. Light with a sweet lime taste that
was not too tart, the cheesecake was an excellent way to finish the meal and would satisfy anyone with a
sweet tooth. Authentic and drizzled with a sweet fruit sauce, the cheesecake was good to the last bite. Kudzu received
high marks from both reviewers for its excellent food, warm atmosphere, and good service at reasonable prices.
