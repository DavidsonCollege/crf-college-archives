### Board of Trustees approve master plan for potential campus future

**Courtesy College Relations**

**The shape of things to come? The possible future layout of the campus.**

By Wendy Lee

Thought about what the Davidson campus might look like in years to come? The Environmental Consulting Services Limited of Toronto
has. The consultants recently presented a “Master Plan” for the college which the Trustees approved at their October meeting. The
plan proposes guidelines for making changes in campus facilities. The plan specified three goals for the college: to meet the
needs of faculty, staff, and students; to distribute resources equally; and to keep costs as manageable as possible.

A few interesting facts were presented in the plan. A number of 8,650 cars per day pass by the Visual
Arts Center on Griffith Street. Space for teaching and faculty offices totals 253,000 square feet with 172 square feet per
student.

Dr. John Kelton, chairman of the facilities planning committee, said, “The study concludes that we are in pretty decent shape
in terms of building space, but that some of the space we have isn’t adapted well to the functions it’s
used for.” Currently, there are 17 buildings used for administrative purposes. The plan suggests that these be consolidated. It also
suggests that computer services be merged. High priority would be placed upon uniting Baker Sports Complex with the rest of
campus.

The plan cited space constrictions for the psychology, music, theater, and biology departments and for computer services, registrar, and student
services as major points of emphasis. Among the “growth” scenarios suggested are: additional buildings between Chambers and E.H. Little Library;
additions to the library, the Dana and Martin Science Buildings, and Cunningham Fine Arts Building.

The plan recommended that studios and performance areas be set aside for the theater and music department. It also advises
that there be a minimum number of internal roads on the campus. Among the 57 recommendations made in the “Master
Plan” include:
- The main pathways of campus should be maintained and enlarged to better integrate areas of campus like Baker.
- The shortages of space for psychology, music, theater, and biology.

### Search is on for new Dean of Students

By Lexy DeVane

A joint committee of students and faculty has been working in the selection process for a new Dean of Students.
The new dean will follow Will Terry, who is to retire this spring after 23 years. This committee, headed by
Dr. Bruce Jackson, has been meeting about once a week since its formation in early October. Members of the committee,
representing a cross-section of the college community, were asked by the president to participate. Students on the committee include juniors
Sarah Orsbon and Eric Rosenbach, and seniors Julie Petty and DeVane Tidwell. Faculty members include Vivien Dietz, history and humanities;
Bruce Jackson, mathematics; Julio Ramirez, psychology; Janet Shannon, sociology; other members include men's tennis coach Jeff Frank and Assistant Director
of the Annual Fund Lisa Combs.

Currently, the committee is busy sorting through numerous applications. Two advertisements in national academic journals for this job have been
placed, increasing the diversity of applicants greatly. A consulting agency has also been utilized for prospective applicants and background checks.
The deadline for applications is January 15, assuring the committee plenty of time for interviewing selected candidates. The committee will
then submit their recommendations to the president before the April meeting of the Trustees. Although much of the committee work
has been kept private, a member wished to stress that “the committee wants the best qualified candidate. Ideally, the future
Dean will have had experience with a small liberal arts college.”"lege and will also be proficient in the skills necessary
for being the Vice President of Student Life.”

**McMillen featured in New South Museum**

By Sally Stone

It is fitting that Charlotte’s New South museum is located within the city's largest monument to progress, the NationsBank tower.
The intimate museum is in Founders Hall, a wing of NationsBank, site of the Blumenthal Performing Arts Center. Currently showing
at the New South museum is the exhibit, “When Southern Women Went to College.” This hall-long exhibit includes an interactive
video program about the New South. Dr. Sally McMillen, Davidson professor of history, is featured in the video discussing the
influence of women on the New South.

The New South is defined as the transition from growing cotton to turning cotton into textiles, according to former Queens
professor Bari Watkins. The current exhibit focuses on women’s integration into Southern institutions from 1880-1930.

“When Southern Women Went to College” was compiled by Queens College and features information about Queens, Livingston College, and Winthrop
University’s coeducation. It includes information on the curriculum, regulations for female students, athletics, and activities. The first panel begins the
exhibit with the statement, “When southern women went to college they left their homes and families for a promise of
higher education. They arrived as daughters with a thirst for knowledge and they left as educated women.”

Several panels detail unique aspects of women’s experiences. For example, female students were required to be escorted by elders when
leaving campus. The rationale administrators gave for strict regulations was that “women had to prove that they could be scholarly
and feminine at the same time.”

Women’s educational integration extended beyond the South also. Lucille Godbold, a Winthrop student, set the international women’s shotput record in
Paris in 1922. After tracing the evolution of female students through enlarged and yearbook photos, the exhibit concludes, “When Southern
women left college they set out to change the world and they did. Without educated new women there could not
be a New South.”

**College debates newest proposal for Statement of Purpose**

By Rachel Dunifon

What is Davidson’s philosophy? What are its goals and how are they achieved? These are some of the questions addressed
by Davidson’s Statement of Purpose. Although this document may not be familiar to many students, campus-wide discussion has arisen about
ways to make it more representative of the college. This was the topic at a forum sponsored by the SGA
Wednesday night.

Initiative to modify the existing Statement of Purpose came last year from several students and faculty members. They felt that
its emphasis on “Christian higher education” does not represent the current make-up of the college. Additionally, a large self-study of
the entire school, occurring next year, requires the re-evaluation of all of Davidson’s current documents.

The Statement of Purpose can only be changed by Davidson’s Board of Trustees. Craig Wall, Chair of the Board, appointed
a committee last spring to review the document. Larry Daggenhart and William Wood represent the Trustees on the committee, while
