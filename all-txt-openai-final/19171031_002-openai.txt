The time to immediately subscribe to Liberty Bonds is just past. However, it will be good to keep the next float in mind. But there is an immediate duty now. Taking for granted that you have subscribed to The Davidsonian, it is now your privilege, Gentlemen of the Alumni, to subscribe to The Davidson College Magazine. The management of this publication informs us that last year outside of the college (student body and faculty) there was only one name on the subscription list. This is a shame. We can truly say that good reading comes out through this organ. Does it not seem reasonable that one who in years gone by had aided this enterprise in its career should have acquired such an interest in it that he would give his subscription and keep up with the literary development and production? Not only to these do we appeal, but to the general alumni, that you aid this publication.

**Classes Buy Liberty Bonds**
Within ten minutes after the Davidson College Day hour, there was a movement on foot to buy bonds. The Senior Class at once, spontaneously, said that they should have a part in this. Following this patriotic precedent, the Junior and Sophomore Classes had to have a part in this, and they, too, did their bit and purchased bonds. The colleges generally took a big part in this issue, and Davidson was in the rank—both among the faculty and classes.

**Editorial**
How about that meatless, wheatless, and sugarless day? Some of the boarding houses have made this response and did it readily. All have not done it. We appeal to you once again that this movement be instituted. This is on the same principle as Liberty Loan Bonds. Do it now.

**Davidson College Day**
This was a day of loyalty and patriotism through and through. It was first loyal to its own history, institutions, customs, and alumni—both the honored dead and living. The incidents related by the venerated alumnus were fitting and added to the historic element of the memorial day. Following the tributes to alumni and student body came the great speech of Governor Bickett. It was patriotic, loyal, and inspiring throughout. No one but a master could have said what he said. He has a wonderful faculty of humor and earnestness. Many times he lapsed into eloquence. He won the admiration and endeared himself to students from every state represented here as well as to the people of the town. His speech made him the "universal object of envy."

**Again, That Speech**
Some time ago we made an appeal to those members of the student body to heed their little grammatical slips. In our general reading and study, we find many striking phrases carrying the point which we wish we could publish. The immortal William was right when he said, "You speak not as you think: it cannot be." The truth of the matter is that many of us do not think before speaking. If you want to ruin yourself (addressing only those of us who are guilty), there is nothing better to do than keep it up. "He don’t," "he come," "it ain't" and a thousand others "cannot be." Fellows! In the name of all that is pure and beautiful in our language and speech, we implore you for your sake to stop this. Do it now!

**Who's Got the Pep**
"We got the pep." Pajamas and shirt-tails galore graced this old campus and surroundings Saturday night. It was the return of old times. From the joyous-green Freshman to the joyous-reverent and joyous-grave Senior, many took part in this nightly revel and enjoyed the spirited hullabaloo and the words of encouragement by members of the faculty. This shows how the team is supported by the student body. Loyalty was seen in its essence. This part of college life is an enjoyable feature. Those of us who are soon to be alumni like to have those delightful feet-upon-the-table reveries, or pipe dreams—about how the alumni shake with genuine joy as they recall when they took part in such a spooky performance. And when they built an enormous bonfire in front of Chambers and sang everything from "Hak-a-raka" and the "Old family toothbrush that hangs on the wall," to "I want a girl, just like the girl that married dear old dad" and "College ties can ne'er be."broken, formed at old D.C." If there was a Freshman who was off the Hill and did not take part in this parade, he should get into one soon, i.e., the one before the Clemson game, which will likely be a big one.

“SEA-CALVES.”

There are those who say that there is nothing new under the sun—that there is nothing original—that everything which we think today was conceived centuries ago. Then if this is the case, there is a picture found in Odyssey which is analogous to some aspects of today’s marine life. “The goddess directs the seekers for Ulysses to the realm of the ‘Ancient of the Deep.’ In telling of a scene which is invariably true of Neptune’s subject she says: ‘The sea-calves from the ocean throng, Rank with the bitter odor of the brine, And slumber near Him.’” Isn't this analogous to the submarines and sub-chasers who guard our transports across the briny waters?

DEMOCRACY IN COLLEGE WORLD.

Mr. F. M. Davenport, of Hamilton College, in the Outlook, ably discusses the college in its relation to democracy. As a democratic institution, it has its failures. In this article, there are some striking sentences. Allow us to quote:

THE DAVIDSONIAN, October 31, 1917

“The human stock which gravitates collegeward in the twentieth century in America is probably as good as human stock ever was in the history of the world.”

“Most college men, I am convinced, put nothing like the energy into the college career and take out nothing like the disciplined power for action and for service which they ought to take.”

It sounds almost like plagiarism, for President Martin expressed the same idea, clothed in about the same language before this article came out, when he closes this fine article with:

“Young men, the colleges are the official training camps of the leaders of the nation.”

He thinks that the college will appreciably rise in the scale of democracy. This war will throw down a precipitate. The doctrine of the democratic college is for the men to have an opportunity, to take it, and then bend the full capacity of mind and body into service of their generation. It is the age of a fine spirit of service and accomplishment for democracy. A democratic institution needs men who think and who keep apace with the rapidly expanding mind of the world. This is the function of the college—to furnish such men.

GAME WITH AUBURN TO BE PLAYED IN ATLANTA

At the request of the football fans of Atlanta, the Davidson schedule now includes a game with Auburn there on November 10 in the place of Carolina’s game. Almost since the opening of college, rumors have been circulated that this game would be played; but there was no certainty. The people of Atlanta are always warm admirers of Davidson and her teams, and it is hoped that the Red and Black machine will make the creditable showing which has heretofore characterized its games in the Georgia metropolis. The fans there will of course be rather inclined to favor the opponents of their rivals from Auburn. The relative strength of the teams is largely a matter of conjecture. Davidson made a wonderful showing against Georgia Tech, the strongest team in the South, but Auburn has some wonderful material this year. Well-informed critics of the game say that Auburn has the material for a team equal to the teams of ‘13 and ‘14, but that it is not yet in shape. Still, Davidson cannot but take comfort from the fact that Auburn beat Mississippi Aggies by only 13-7, with the ball on Auburn's three-yard line at the end of the game. Davidson's game with Furman cannot be a very hard one, and the team ought to be in excellent shape when it goes against Auburn. In any event, we all feel sure that the team will make a good showing.

KEESLER AND BLACK STAR FOR JACKSON

The newspaper account of the football game between Camps Wadsworth and Jackson, played in Columbia on the 24th, will interest Davidson men. North Carolina college men starred for Camp Jackson; the backfield was composed of Keesler (Davidson), Black (Davidson), Coleman (N.C.), Lee (A. & M.). These, with Ramsey (N.C.), Schultz (W. & L.), Potter (Yale), White (Yale), Thurman (Va.), Cody (Vanderbilt), and Hill (S.C.), won the game 14 to 0. Edgerton, of Davidson, acted as umpire. Wadsworth's team represented the following colleges: Dean, Yale, Delaware, Colgate, Elmira, Phillips-Exeter, Trinity (Northern College), Brown, Rochester, and Syracuse. Lee and Hill passed the goal line once each and Thurman kicked goal both times.
