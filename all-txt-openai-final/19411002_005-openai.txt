**THE DAVIDSONIAN**

**Page Five**

**Among THE GREEKS**

**Phi Delta Theta**

The Phi Delts moved their headquarters from Davidson to Greensboro last weekend for the game, with nineteen brothers and eighteen
pledges attending. Only three remained on campus: Brother Westall had definite interests in Asheville, and Pledge O. E. Starnes went
along to chaperon. Kitt Beaty preferred Rock Hill to Greensboro, and Bob Pierce found W. C. more interesting than the
game. Greensboro wasn’t enough for Hobbie. After the game, he headed for the fair city of Spartanburg, where he spent
a “quiet” Sunday at Converse. Sunday night, after everything had calmed down, there was a feed at the house.

**Phi Gamma Delta**

Practically the entire Fiji band left the campus and headed north for the city of Greensboro. Phi Gams were seen
on every bumming corner between here and that fair city. The Brothers who were present to witness the Wildcats hold
the Wolfpack to a 6-6 tie were: Amos Ragan, “Butch” Pharr, Howell Morrow, Reah Dabney, Bob Crowell, Bill Campbell, Rufus
Nimmons, “Hank” Crane, Pete Cavert, Arch Taylor, Bill Summers, Dan Hodges, and Tony Darby. Most of the remaining Brothers found
their way to Charlotte before the weekend was over. But some few spent a miserable time here on the campus.

**Sigma Alpha Epsilon**

The S.A.E.’s took in the State game at Greensboro Saturday night with almost every brother and pledge present, except for
the chapter’s home-loving little group, the Campus Kids, who enjoyed a barbecue at Mrs. Baird's. The highlight of the weekend
was a delightful barbecue supper Saturday afternoon at the beautiful home of Mr. and Mrs. E. F. Lucas, father and
mother of Brother Ed and Pledge Jack. A number of brothers and pledges further enjoyed the gracious hospitality of the
Lucases, spending the night at the Lucas home, located just outside of Greensboro, while still more stayed with other members
there. The weekend was further enlivened by the presence of Brother Bill Grosse, who has been a visitor on the
campus for the past few days. Bill capably officiated at a gala party at the Boar and Castle after the
game.

**Kappa Sigma**

With the exception of three boys, the entire Chapter journeyed to Greensboro for the game. Among the remaining three was
Alston Thompson, who just had to visit the Queen City. Pledges Gault and Henderson also limited their excursions to Charlotte.
In Greensboro, the brothers and pledges with their dates were entertained by Brother Carter with a buffet supper at his
home. That, coupled with a sensational game, made the weekend an exceptionally successful one. Brothers Booth, Amos, Phillips, and Taylor
remained in Greensboro Sunday night. Brother Dick took a quick trip to Sumter, S.C., Sunday. Brother Kelly went to Lynchburg
after the game. Brothers Manning and Conyers found time to visit their home in Spartanburg, S.C. Brothers Amos, Simmons, and
Marsh and Pledges MiWis, Ellis, and Short visited their homes in High Point, accompanied by several Brothers and Pledges.

**Pi Kappa Alpha**

The entire chapter, brothers and pledges, attended the game in Greensboro Saturday night, scattering afterward to various hot spots in
the city of Greensboro and the vicinity. Dates for the game included the following W.C. lasses: Julia Guion, Patty Guion,
Margaret Huske, Wilma Tillet, Bradley Duffy, Lib Morris, Jean Schnepfe, Frances Scott, Daphne Lewis, Eva Allen Travis of Greensboro, and
Mary Katherine Smith of Statesville. Brothers Bell, Shannon, Moore, and Browning and Pledges Frederick and Farrior spent the night at
Brother Brinson’s in High Point, with swimming and riding on the program Sunday. Brothers Pearson and Sam Henderson and Pledge
Stroup spent the night at Brother Brockman’s. Alumni seen at the game were numerous. By Sunday night, all the Chapter
had returned to the hill with the exception of Brother Neill, who operated in Spartanburg. It is with pleasure that
we announce the pledging of J. C. Walker of Statesville.

**Sigma Phi Epsilon**

All the brothers journeyed to Greensboro this weekend to catch that date and carry her to the game. Nearly all
the brothers accompanied the team, while the rest reached the Gate City as best they could. Brother Morton traveled to
his home in Waycross, Ga., where he reports many big deals. The other part of the week was spent going
to and from Charlotte. Brother Turner rushed to Shelby and back Sunday just to see Peggy for a few hours.
Brothers Gwynn, Fulcher, Betts, Miller, and Whitley enjoyed the Queens dating parlor Sunday night. We are all going to back
the Cats against Carolina and are expecting a big weekend.

**Pi Kappa Phi**

The past weekend, every brother and pledge left the campus for some part of the country hereabouts. The football game
with N.C. State was the biggest attraction, being attended by brothers Evans, McCrea, Armstrong, Wayman, Herring, Parks, Gowdy, Hipp, Robertson,
McCall, Murray, Logan, Watson, Larkin, and Bumbarger, and Pledges Gaither, Parrigan, Denny, Lineberger, French, and Yantis. After the game, the
Pi Kapps celebrated Davidson's “almost-victory” everywhere from Greensboro to Chapel Hill. Brothers Logan, Herring, Wayman, Gowdy, and McCrea also attended
the South Carolina-North Carolina tilt in Chapel Hill before going to Greensboro. Brother Clarence McArthur made two trips to Charlotte
over the weekend. Other Pi Kapps who went to the “big city” were Brother Raymond and Pledges Gaither, Birmingham, and
Buck Williams. Pledge Johnny Campbell spent the weekend at his home in Lumberton, while Brother Plunkett journeyed to Myrtle Beach
and Hartsville. Brother John Robinson and Pledge Pic Walton went to their respective homes in Derita and Hickory. South Carolina
attracted two Pledges, Frank Key going to Gaffney, and Sumner Williams to Greenville. Brother Bob Patton stayed in Rutherfordton, and
Pledge Jimmy Corrigan bummed to High Point. Brother Sam Hemphill, an alumnus of the class of ’39, attended the game
in Greensboro and spent Sunday in Davidson.

**Kappa Alpha**

Not many of the knights allowed anything to interfere with their going to the N.C. State game at Greensboro Saturday.
They all had a good time, and some were fortunate to have dates. Following the 6-6 “victory” for Davidson, many
of the brothers and pledges had further pleasure and enjoyment in Greensboro. After an eventful night, a few found that
hotel room floors were very comfortable for the night’s rest. The following went elsewhere for the weekend: Brother “Scotty” Patterson
visited Saint Mary’s in Raleigh on Sunday following his trip to Greensboro. Two K.A. delegates to Charlotte were Brothers “Moon”
Dunn and “Nic” Pinkerton, who brought back reports of a lovely time. Pledge Brother Tom Glasgow visited his home in
Charlotte on Sunday. Brother Russell Beam and Pledge Brother Bob Durrant went to their respective homes in Lumberton and Southern
Pines for a weekend visit.

**Brother Cam Williamson Is Speaker**

**College Professor Answers Will Durant’s Speech**

Dr. Rene de Visme Williamson, Professor of Economics and Political Science here, brought to the Sunday School class an answer
to Dr. Will Durant’s speech of the day before. Dr. Williamson’s answer stressed the tie between true science and true
religion, as opposed to the pseudo-sciences. Both science and religion seek the truth, and if the interpretations are genuine, there
will be no conflict between a rational science and a true religion. If approached from the same angle, science will
be consistent with religion. Dr. Williamson also stressed the fact that faith gives power, whether to good or evil enterprises.
He cited the examples of small minorities, such as Hitler’s early party, having faith in themselves and so rising to
great heights. He warned us to think for ourselves and not be led by the Will Durants of the world.

**Camera Kans Hold Meeting**

**Prayer Meetings**

Prayer meetings, drawing sixty-seven percent of Davidson’s Student Body, were held in thirty-six halls last Wednesday at 10:15 P.M. The
Friendship Council, under the leadership of Jim McCrary and Jesse Wooten, sponsors a group of prayer meetings originated by, composed
of, and conducted by the students themselves. Each hall conducts its own meeting, with its own leaders, and is attended
by the students rooming on that particular floor. Though an attendance of sixty-seven percent is an exceptionally fine beginning, the
council has set seventy-five percent as its goal for the next prayer meeting and an even increasing percentage as the
semester advances.

**Pat Rudolph, Pan-Hellenic President, Announces Signing of the Homecoming Band**

Vince Courtney and his Duke Ambassadors will be presented at one of the two dances of the set. As shown
on page one, the leader himself is a vocalist, and several arrangements are worked around his repertoire. Generally, the orchestra
stresses a sweet style combined with a forceful punch, which combination should result in a delightful dance orchestra. Advance information
from the fraternities tends to show that there will be one of the largest groups of dates here in Homecoming
history. Such information is gathered from the indications of the sale of favors, etc. The Pan-Hellenic Council plans to continue
the system now in place, which was changed about two years ago, of having one dance before Christmas and three
in the spring. Midwinters, the next set, will come right after the mid-year examinations.

**Le Cercle Français Elects New Members**

**W. C. Plunkett Elected President For '41-'42**

Le Cercle Français, at its meeting on Monday, September 29, elected new members.Vesper service last Sunday, our pastor, Rev. C.
R. Pritchett, spoke about “The Friendship of Jesus Christ.” Mr. Pritchett gave to each of those who attended a realization
that the greatest friend a man can have is Jesus, our Savior. “One of the assets of college life,” he
asserted, “is the formation of sincere, lasting friendships.” One ought to begin at his very first entrance to college to
choose his friends with care. Taking his text from John 15:1-17, the speaker enlarged upon the way in which we
can make friends with Christ. “Ye are my friends if you do whatsoever I command you,” the Savior said. Mr.
Pritchett pointed out that Christ enjoined us as Christians to love one another. “This,” he said, “would discriminate our affection
from everyone, to those who are the friends of God.” Our pastor closed his sermon by telling of a former
Davidson student who, in attempting to rescue a friend in this community, was himself drowned. “Greater love hath no man
than this, that a man lay down his life for a friend.” The congregation was urged to uphold, to the
highest degree, the great Davidson tradition of friendship, and the custom of speaking to fellow students.

President Tunk will elevate two associate members. The Glee Club's rendition of “O John” served to create an atmosphere of
reverence throughout the entire program. The speaker for the Vespers next Sunday will be the Rev. W. A. Alexander, pastor
of the South Hill Presbyterian Church of Birmingham, Alabama. Mr. Alexander is one of the outstanding ministers of the Presbyterian
Church in the United States. He is also on the Foreign Mission Board of our church.

Last Tuesday night, the Camera Club, composed of students interested in photography, held its first meeting. Ten members were present.
Officers of the club, elected last year, are: Boyce Rhyne, President; Jack Miller, Vice-President; and Dick Phillips, Secretary. During the
year, the club intends to have several well-known speakers to appear before the club. The club also plans to enter
several exhibits, one of which takes place before Christmas. Plans were discussed for a trip to Coker College, Hartsville, S.C.,
sometime in November. This trip will serve to return their visit paid to Davidson last fall. The attraction will be
a play presented by the Coker co-eds.

Davidson's annual Ping-Pong Tournament will start in the near future under the sponsorship of the Y.M.C.A. Ralph Williams, in charge
of the social activities of the “Y,” has just announced plans for the Ping-Pong Tournament. He hopes that more people
will enter the contest this year than ever before. All those who wish to enter should see either Shaw Smith
or Ralph Williams before Monday, Nov. 6, when the entry list will be closed. Important features of the contest every
year are the finals and the beautiful trophy presented to the winner. The finals are played in the gymnasium, where
everybody has a chance to see it. The band is to be on hand to play several numbers as an
added attraction.

Regular meetings of Le Cercle Francais will be held on Tuesday. Elected as ‘41-42 club officers were: W. C. Plunkett,
President; Ed Scott, Vice-President; Hank Crane, Secretary; and Dr. Goldiere, Treasurer. The Queens College Club and the local club, as
in the past, will hold several joint meetings. A well-equipped darkroom is open to all members of the club. Several
excellent pieces of equipment will be added this year. President Rhyne asks that anyone interested in joining the club get
in touch with him at No. 2 West.

Mac Bruce was the winner of the handsome trophy presented last year. A similar one is to be given to
the winner this year.

There will be a Pep Meeting, Shirt Tail, and Bonfire on Friday night in preparation for the game to come
off Saturday night between Davidson and the University of North Carolina. George Mitchell, chief cheerleader, announced that he would try
to have a member of the football squad talk to the meeting. All Freshmen will be required to sign up
again this week. There was a long list of absentees from last week’s meeting, and Judge Francis Catawba announced that
he would give a special address to the absentees from this meeting. He says that it will go hard with
the freshman who has his name on both lists. All upperclassmen are urged to attend the Pep Meeting and Shirt
Tail. It has been suggested that the Freshmen watch themselves at the fire and not get too close. Some came
dangerously close to the blaze last week. There will be a short meeting in Chapel at which time a few
yells will be practiced.

Meeting in Chambers Auditorium, the North Carolina Synod of the Presbyterian Church heard an address by Dr. C. E. Pritchett
as the climax to their meeting at 7:30 Wednesday evening. After meeting at Sarium Springs Tuesday and Wednesday, the delegates
drove to Davidson for the address by Dr. Pritchett. The theme of the entire meeting was “Christian Education.”

Beta Theta Pi

Greensboro was the town for most of the Brothers and Pledge Brothers this weekend. Some of them went to the
Carolina vs. Carolina game and the State game, spending Sunday at their homes in the suburbs of Burlington. The other
crew to Greensboro included Brothers Efird, Howell, Upchurch, Church, Caterson, Shaw, Walker, Wheeler, Ed and Jack Philips, Rainy McCary, and
Pledge Brothers Alfred McNair and Goode. The Charlotte bunch were Brothers Bryant, Paul Welsh, Ed Taylor, “Mama” Mebane, Bob Welsh,
