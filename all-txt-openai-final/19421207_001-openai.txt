GOAL Tyler Will | Part of Gift Fund FOR Receive To Carry On Effort

Student Body Opinion

Ben Lacy: Perhaps in this time of war some boys will think the Christmas Gift Fund is going in the
wrong direction. If you will think about it a bit, you will see that it isn’t so. Our relations seem
to be a bit strained in regard to the negro at this time, but that isn't a reason to turn
against them. The right thing to do is to try to understand them better and approach this problem in a
Christian manner. Our fund this year is going to help do this. In my opinion, the Y couldn't have chosen
a much better cause and I hope the school supports it all the way.

Ed Erwin: Perhaps as we look into a war-clouded personal future, each of us may tend to forget problems nearer
home. There's no problem closer to the individuals of Southern homes and communities than that of the negro. The Y.M.C.A.
has picked a timely and important project worthy of our most generous support.

Al Dimmock: I think we should all give our wholehearted support to the Christmas Gift Fund project for this year.
By helping to spread Christ among our Southern negroes, we will not only be carrying out His divine decree and
contributing to a worthy cause, but we will also have a share in creating a better feeling between the races.

Craig Schmidt: I was a little surprised when I learned where this year's Gift Fund was going. It is about
the last place I expected. Now I know that many students will not approve of this disposal of the money.
There are always about one third in this group and for the first time, I'm one of them. In the
first place, I feel that there are numbers of problems more pressing at the present. In the second place, admitting
that the problem of race differences is a growing one, why not wait until we have won the war before
we pass up the more crying needs of the present to salve a future sore? And in the third place,
I feel that this direction has been the most frequent one chosen for the past Gift Funds. Why not give
it a rest? Although I disapprove of its use, the basic ideals and principles behind it are the best to
be found in college. Therefore, I say let's all support the Y one hundred per cent.

The annual Christmas Gift Fund gives rise to perhaps what is noblest in Davidson students. I can think of no
other good school that has proportionately reached—in any sort of charity or worthwhile drive—the goal that the Gift Fund did
last year. At that time, $1,600 was raised with students' contributions averaging almost $3.00 apiece. The project this year is
perhaps much more timely. Our treatment of the negroes in the past has been both un-Democratic and un-Christian. It is
not only our duty, but it is expedient as well that we try to alleviate the problem in a sane
and sound manner. Davidson can do a small but extremely helpful share in the solving of this problem by enthusiastically
supporting the Gift Fund this year.

Young Negro Graduate Is Already Prominent In Work For Church

Part of the Christmas Gift Fund, which has been designated this year for the work of Christian Education for Negroes
in the South, is to go to the work of a young negro preacher, Charles Tyler, who is at present
engaged in a great work in Birmingham, Alabama.

Stillman Institute
Charles Tyler graduated from Stillman Institute in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, last June. While at Stillman, Charles distinguished himself in public speaking
and similar activities. He had quite a bit of experience for which he received a scholarship and extra training.

1942 GIFT FUND $600.00 NEGRO WORK OPEN DRIVE WITH PLEDGES

Receiving from Myron Sandifer, President of the Student Body, and Jim McCrary, President of the Y.M.C.A., the first pledges for
the 1942 Christmas Gift Fund were campaign leaders Alf Taylor and Welford Hobbie. This year the Fund will be used
entirely for Religious Education among Southern negroes. The money will be handled by the Home Mission Committee of the Southern
Presbyterian Church.

Hobbie Named Collector
Y Gift Fund Dormitory and Fraternity Representatives Named For Gift Fund

Welford Hobbie, recently appointed by the Y.M.C.A. Cabinet to assist Alf Taylor in the Christmas Gift Fund, has recently outlined
the campaign. He stated that the representatives in each dormitory and fraternity had been selected to make the collection as
generally as possible. The representatives are: Rumple Dormitory, Fredrick and Lies; Belk Dormitory, Smith, Hack, Grace, Fisher, and Bill McWiley;
Watts Dormitory, Camp, Tooley, Frank Carter, and Bob Curne; West Dormitory, Sam Bay, Bill McLean, and Jim Sala; Last Dormitory,
Bob McCain, Stubbins, Jack, and Pall Neys; Gym, Bill Grimley; Town students, John Croned, and in general, supervising and organizing
the educational program in the negro churches of the Southern Presbyterian Church.

By MYRON SANDIFER
This year the “Y” Cabinet has taken a very bold step in selecting Christian Education among the Southern negroes as
the project for the Christmas Gift Fund. Many worthy causes were presented, and all the others had something to recommend
themselves. But in a real sense, the fact that this is a controversial issue is all the more reason for
involving it. The Cabinet does not anticipate that the project for this year will meet with universal approval. But the
most urgent and immediate of these is the desirability of interpreting the mass voting public in the South. Today, as
in wartime, the air is full of baseless rumors and misrepresentation which discredit the motives of both races. I have
no doubt that the fraternity representatives will work out in this chapel. Charles conducts weekly Sunday School, preaching services, boys’
and girls’ club meetings, Bible study, and creative recreational gatherings. When this work has been completely and competently handled, a
new found to take it over, Charles will move somewhere else where he is needed.

of falsehood and fear. It is hoped that many faculty members and friends of the student body will learn the
opportunity afforded by the races. Certainly, it should be immediately discerned by all those who are willing to use that
opportunity. Stillman graduates are distinguishing themselves in many fields, particularly in the field of education and health. The decision of
the "Y" concerning the objective of the Gift Fund this year has confirmed my confidence in their judgment and elicited
my admiration for their Christian statesmanship. They have in a very real sense pointed out to the student body one
of the major social and religious problems of our country and offer in their own way and measure an opportunity
for the student body to make a contribution towards its solution. The plight of the negro people should disturb all
Christian men of sensitive conscience and lead them to sustained thought and patient effort in assisting them to find their
place in our society and to enter more fully into the rich inheritance of the Christian life.

The Davidson College Y.M.C.A. Cabinet has for a number of years felt the need of helping as much as erect
the negroes of this community. Four years ago the entire Gift Fund went to the local negro community for the
purpose of building a community center which has become more useful year by year. Each Sunday afternoon classes are conducted
for the negroes that work in the boarding houses, while other activities are conducted by the Y during the week.
Three colored Boy Scout troops, located in Davidson, Smithville, the negro settlement at Cornelius, and at Caldwell Station, are sponsored
by the Y. These troops, having an average membership of about 15, meet each week under the supervision of Davidson
men.

There are those leaders who insist that the change must be one of revolution, of violence and racial upheaval, and
these leaders have no other type of leadership to which to turn. But there are those who believe that the
teaching of Christ, rather than the way of violence, is the real solution to the problem. The responsibility rests upon
us who have the resources to see to it that those leaders have a chance to proclaim the doctrine of
brotherhood. More particularly, this is the Christian's opportunity to render a significant service to the negro world, and are doing
more than their share to lift their race from the ignorance and poverty which has so retarded them in the
South. From the frequent articles on race that appear in periodicals of recognized worth, and from the front pages of
the more sensational newspapers, and very often from our own unpleasant experiences, this truth may be gathered: A change is
on the way.
