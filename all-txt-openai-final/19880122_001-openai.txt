**Warner Hall sanctioned for violation of alcohol policy**
**Enforcement committee imposes fine, social probation**
By MARIA DOUGLAS

At a Tuesday night meeting, the Patterson Court Alcohol Policy Enforcement Council subjected Warner Hall to the stiffest sanctions the
Council has imposed during the course of this academic year. The women’s eating house was fined $100 and put on
social probation for one week after it was found guilty of having violated the Patterson Court alcohol policy last Saturday
night.

The violation occurred when an I.D. monitor from Warner Hall allowed senior David Ethridge to enter the designated drinking area
using his North Carolina driver’s license instead of his Davidson I.D. Both co-sponsors of the party, Warner Hall and Sigma
Alpha Epsilon, were brought up on charges. SAE was found “not guilty” of any violations.

The Alcohol Policy states that “To enter the designated service area, the individual must present a Davidson College I.D. card
to the designated entrance monitor for age verification. If the individual is not a Davidson student, valid identification must be
shown, such as a state driver’s license or passport.”

Ginger Broaddus, president of the Patterson Court Council and of Warner Hall, declined to comment on the decision of the
Enforcement Council. Ethridge said he “understood [he] had to have a Davidson College ID” but that his license was a
“state accredited verification of age.”

“Technically, yes, it was wrong. My going downstairs was an infraction of the rules,” said Ethridge. Ethridge said the policy
is a “ridiculous charade.” He feels it discriminates against the Davidson student because it does not permit him to use
an I.D. card which is considered valid by the government of the state of North Carolina.

Ethridge said he did not have his student I.D. card because he had used it to borrow a vacuum cleaner
from the Residence Life Office, and had forgotten to retrieve it when he returned the vacuum. He had been unable
to obtain it after the office closed that evening. (For further comments from Ethridge regarding alcohol policy enforcement procedures, see
page 10.)

The sanctions imposed upon Warner Hall were the stiffest imposed by the Enforcement Council so far this year. While previous
violators brought to the attention of the Council have only been issued written warnings, Warner Hall will be required to
pay a fine of $100 to the Patterson Court Council. According to the Patterson Court alcohol policy, this money will
be used “at the discretion of the Patterson Court Council for educational programs, funding for measures to prevent driving while
intoxicated, or any other expenses related to the implementation of the alcohol policy.” Warner Hall has also been placed under
social probation for a period of one week, scheduled to begin on Friday, January 22.

**Patterson Court survey**
**Poll indicates students support status quo**
By STEVE MEADOWS and KEITH FINCH

Three-quarters of Davidson students believe that fraternities should continue to exist here, according to a survey of 165 students conducted
by the Davidsonian staff this week. Most students surveyed also indicated...Their approval of the Fall term ban on freshman involvement
in Patterson Court, and indicated they would not like to see sororities on the Davidson campus. The survey consisted of
ten questions about Davidson’s social system, as well as two questions asking respondents to indicate their graduating class and sex.
The students taking the survey represented 12% of Davidson’s 1,367 currently enrolled students. When asked, “Do you believe that fraternities
should continue to exist at Davidson College?”, 76% of the students surveyed responded “yes.” Only 16% responded “no,” the other
8% indicating that they were undecided or did not wish to answer the question. The survey also asked students, “Do
you think freshmen should be kept off the Court for a period of time at the beginning of Fall term,
as they were this year?” Seventy-eight percent of the respondents answered “yes,” while 21% answered “no.” Those who opposed the
current system were mostly See SURVEY, p.3

The Professional Affairs Committee has released its Faculty Salary and Compensation Report, in which it calls for an average 9%
salary increase for the coming year. The report called particular attention to “the plight of our assistant professors,” whose average
salaries rank very low in comparison to those of junior faculty members at other highly selective institutions, as well as
those at other colleges in North Carolina. The junior faculty expressed their support for the report in a response signed
by all Davidson’s regular-appointment assistant professors. Although they argued that “even the 9% raise recommended by the Committee would not
achieve parity with assistant professors’ salaries at competing institutions.”

The annual Faculty Salary Report, compiled by PAC committee members David Shi, Cole Barton, Gail Gibson, Lauren Yoder, and David
Kaylor, went on to say that the salary received today by assistant professors (approximately 25 percent of the faculty) is
82.9 percent of the salary received in the 1966-67 academic year (based on constant ‘66-‘67 dollars). The report begins: “Last
year there was a substantial discrepancy between the Professional Affairs Committee’s recommendation for average salary increases (9.4%) and the actual
increase (5%). As a consequence, little progress was made toward our traditional goal of restoring faculty buying power to that
of the 1966-67 year.” The report emphasizes that Davidson is a year behind its target date of 1987 for reaching
that goal. While full professors receive 94.6 percent of the 1966 figures, associate professors receive 95.5 percent. On the whole,
these salaries are comparable and even rank high in comparison to those institutions with which Davidson compares itself (i.e., Pomona,
Oberlin, Carleton, Mt. Holyoke, Swarthmore, and Amherst). The findings prompted a response from assistant faculty members in the form of
the junior faculty response document, presented January 12 at a faculty meeting by Assistant Professor Julio Ramirez. The most pressing
matter, in the eyes of the junior faculty, is the question of the degree of priority which will be afforded
this issue by the trustees of Davidson College.

Shi said that “it is important that faculty salaries receive greater attention from trustees as they prepare the budget, and
that they target assistant professors.” See PAY, p. 2
