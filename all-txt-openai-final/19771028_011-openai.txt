**Davidson graduate returns in Cabaret**

“Graham, what’s it like to be a star?” I asked, not exactly sure how to begin an interview with an old freshman hallmate.

“Well, I don’t know,” said Graham, stroking his goatee as his familiar, mischievous smile spread, “but I'll let you know.”

Six shows of Cabaret a week, every week, has not taken any of the humor out of Graham Smith, who graduated from Davidson last year with an English degree and a desire to work with theatre.

He is getting more than his share. Back in September, Graham went to Connecticut College to join rehearsals that were already in progress. “I was pretty much the last man,” he explained.

Now he drives a truck, sets up and breaks the stage, shifts sets, and has a small walk-on. He says he got to where he is, a little more than unimportant, as he puts it, “not by exhibiting any great know-how, but by working my tail off and doing anything.”

The show's schedule calls for 73 one-nighters before Christmas. Already the show has been from New England to Florida, and all the stops between, playing in colleges and auditoriums with facilities ranging from gyms to grandly appointed theatres. But that’s part of the attraction to Graham.

“It’s exciting to make it work each day and make it work in a completely different situation, with a different audience and a different situation and to have to wing it in certain unanticipated areas.”

Graham intends to go to graduate school next year in drama, and looks on this as his year “to be exposed.”

“Contact with people who make this work as a living is a good experience, no matter how I go in drama. It's done me good to know there are all types attracted by theatre but with many different attitudes, people with heads on their shoulders but doing something crazy like this.”

Does that mean that theatre is too crazy for him? “The lifestyle is wild and wooly — I'd like to come home and sleep when I want. You're totally separated from people you're fond of,” he said, looking across at his girlfriend.

“It’s confirmed the assumption that this is a totally involved thing — I'm not sure I’m dedicated to doing theatre in that way, which brings me back to doing college theatre.”

“With professional theatre you've got to please a paying audience, whereas college theatre's goals are much broader. You can take a chance and write it off as an educational experience.”

“At the end of this I hope I'll have something very definite to react to.”

How did Graham feel about being featured in the local advertisements?

“It will probably attract the Charlotte crowd,” he said, stroking his goatee and smiling.
