Davidson led 8-6 entering the seventh inning, but Appalachian rallied for two runs in the top of the inning to tie the game 8-8. In the bottom of the inning, however, Sam Navarro ’05 launched a solo home run to left field, giving Davidson a 9-8 lead it would not relinquish.

Davidson returned to the field on Saturday looking to earn not only its second consecutive series victory, but also coach Dick Cooke’s 300th career win. Appalachian State jumped out to a two-run lead in the first inning, but the ’Cats came back to tie the score 2-2 in the third inning on one walk, two bunts, and a two-run single by Heafner. The ’Cats added another run in the fourth when Alex Entrekin ’06 singled to lead off the inning and eventually came around to score on a Mountaineer error.

After Davidson surrendered an unearned run in the top of the fifth, Heafner blasted a home run to lead off the bottom of the inning, and the ’Cats scored another run on an RBI single by Navarro. The Mountaineers cut the lead to one with another unearned run in the top of the sixth, but the ’Cats again responded quickly, with Mike Muniz ’05 hitting a leadoff double and Ronnie Shore ’06 reaching on a bunt single. After Heafner walked, Greg Zage ’07 hit a two-run single into left and Benefield hit an RBI single to right to give the ’Cats an 8-4 lead that proved to be enough in the 10-6 win.

On Sunday, the Mountaineers again took an early lead, but Davidson’s offense continued its revival at the plate, as it is now statistically one of the best in the nation after a three-game sweep vs. Appalachian State. Davidson scored two runs in the bottom of the fifth and three in the bottom of the seventh, including two on a two-run bomb by Heafner. Davidson starter Matt Meade ’06 pitched a very solid game, giving up only two runs in six innings, and Hartanov sealed his second straight game by halting a three-run rally by the Mountaineers in the ninth.

Overall, the ’Cats’ bats were alive throughout the series, with Heafner and Navarro leading the charge. Heafner went 8-10 with three home runs, seven RBI, eight runs, and five walks to raise his season average to .460, which is one of the top ten marks in the nation. “[Heafner] has done a nice job thus far, and a part of that is the fact that other hitters around him have played well also,” said Cooke. Navarro has been one of the many to step up around Heafner, and he went 7-10 over the weekend with two home runs and six RBI of his own to push his average to .388 in the month of April. “Right now I think that everyone is relaxed and comfortable because we know that our hitters will be able to score runs and keep us in games,” said Navarro.

The ’Cats next travel to South Carolina for a three-game series against 19th-ranked College of Charleston over the weekend. “We know we can play with Charleston because we have never really felt overmatched,” said Cooke.

Golf drops on final day

After three sun-splashed days of golf at the River Run Country Club in Davidson, the Wildcats slipped to a third-place finish in the Southern Conference Tuesday despite leading the event staged at their home course through the first two rounds. Tournament champion ETSU finished with a three-round total of 882, eight strokes ahead of the Wildcats. The Bucs rode the back of Conference Player of the Year Rhys Davies, who won the individual title by 11 strokes with an eight-under par 208. Despite posting a tournament-best round of 285 in the final round, the twelfth-ranked Georgia Southern team finished three strokes back of ETSU in second place at 885. The Wildcats came in five strokes behind the Eagles with an 890 (292-302-296) to register their best performance in the SoCon tournament since 1973, when they finished in second.

Davidson opened strong on Sunday, taking a five-stroke lead over ETSU after carding a 292 over the first 18 holes of play. The ’Cats slipped in round two, as their 302 was seventh-best on the day, but Davidson still held on to a tenuous one-stroke lead heading into the final 18 holes on Tuesday. Davidson rebounded to card a 296 in the final round, but it was not enough to hold off the stellar days by ETSU and Georgia Southern. Still, the strong play of Tim Dillon ’06 (219, 72-76-71) and Steve Mayo ’07 (219, 71-74-74) not only gaveThe 'Cats have something to be excited about going into the final round, but also something to look forward to next year, since both return to the squad. Both players finished tied for third overall. Finishing in third for the 'Cats, and also returning next year, was Alex Knoll '07, whose second shot in the final round at the par-five 18th had the crowd cheering when it came to rest five feet from the pin. He later rolled that putt in to close his weekend with an eagle and a solid 11th-place finish overall (223, 74-75-74). Dan Koernke '05 and Peyton Gallagher '05, meanwhile, finished out their Davidson careers at River Run. Koernke finished in a tie for 32nd after firing a 229 (75-77-77) for the three rounds, while Gallagher's career concluded with a pretty birdie at the 18th to secure a 247 and 58th place. Both played tenaciously this week and have been significant contributors to the golf program over the past four years. Two other seniors who did not see action this week, but also deserve recognition for their contributions, are Dan Walker '05 and Joe Zimmerman '05. The seniors have watched this team improve dramatically, and they have seen their final position in the SoCon tournament progress each year since their arrival. The program is still reaching its potential, though, and coach Tim Straub, who brought home his second Conference Coach of the Year award in the last three seasons, is clearly leading the charge. Straub's impact on the team since his arrival in 2000 cannot be overshadowed. His recruiting prowess and ability to get the most out of his players' games when it counts has him labeled as a big-league coach in the Southern Conference. Dillon also received SoCon accolades for his play this year, as he was named to the All-SoCon second team. With at least three core players returning next year, the 'Cats now have visions of surpassing even the '73 squad in '06.

Last weekend the men's and women's track and field teams traveled to Clemson University for the Solid Orange Classic. The meet served as a tune-up before this weekend's home meet and the upcoming Southern Conference Outdoor Championships, and both teams posted impressive results, including three first-place finishes and one second-place finish. "This meet was certainly encouraging," said Nick Lehman '05.

On the women's side, Summerlee Walter '08 ran a time of 29.31 in the 200, and she followed that up with a 1:01.83 in the 400, while Karina Nascimento '08 crossed the finish line in 1:05.54. In the 800, Hilary Leister '06 finished in fifth place in a time of 2:20.42 to lead a group of fellow Wildcats, including Colleen McKown '08, Ashley Griffith '05, and Clarissa Carr '05. Megal Atias '08 had an impressive performance as well, as she finished second in the 1500 with a time of 4:43.02. Anna Brew '05 recorded one of Davidson's first-place finishes when she crossed the finish line in the 5000 in a time of 18:47.31, almost a half-minute before the nearest competitor. Cecie Blair '08 and Jessica Chasen '07 competed in the 400 hurdles, and Blair barely edged out Chasen, 1:11.64 to 1:12.01. The 4x400 team of Blair, Walter, Nascimento, and Chasen then finished fifth in their race with a time of 4:11.00.

On the men's side, Dave Ritchie '07 recorded the most impressive Wildcat performance of the day, as Ritchie's 22.21 in the 200 is the fastest time recorded for a Davidson sprinter since 1978. John Bialas '07 and Cisco Morales '07 also ran in the 200, and they finished in times of 22.76 and 23.98, respectively. Bialas also ran in the 100, and he posted a time of 11.29. Ritchie returned in the 400, and he finished first in 49.11 to beat out two other Davidson sprinters, Stefan Flessa '08 (50.51) and Morales (52.71). When asked about Ritchie, Flessa said, "He is a beast."

Three more Wildcats ran in the 1500. Alex Varner '07 finished first among the group in 4:06.21, and his time was fast enough for a fifth-place finish. Nick Lehman '05 came in seventh with a time of 4:08.27, and John Doehring '07 finished in 4:12.06. In the 3000 meter steeplechase, Austin Mercadante '06 finished fourth with a time of 9:46.37. The 4x400 meter team of Bialas, Flessa, Ritchie, and Paul Wyatt '05 added another first-place finish for the Wildcats, as the group just edged out The Citadel by .09 seconds. Bialas was happy with the results, saying, "We're heading in the right direction as we enter the most important part of our season."

Overall, Coach Gary Andrew was also encouraged by the results. "Things seem to be coming together well as we approach the conference championships," he said, "and as long as we maintain our focus over the next two weeks, we should have a great ending to our season."

On Friday and Saturday, the Wildcats host the Irwin Belk Invitational, their lone home meet of the year, here at Davidson.
