Thursday, February 8, the Wildcats journeyed to Greenville, S.C. to take on the Paladins of Furman. Despite placing five men in double figures, committing fewer turnovers, and gleaning more steals than their opponents, the ‘Cats fell to defeat, 87-76, because they were plagued by poor field goal shooting (42.6 percent) and rebounding (36 rebounds to 49 for Furman).

Davidson was outscored 18-6 in the opening six minutes, and despite whittling the margin to four points with ten minutes remaining in the opening half, trailed by a 43-28 score at halftime. Furman extended the lead past 20 points in the opening minutes of the second stanza, prompting Wildcats’ coach Bob McKillop to instruct his players to begin fouling to stop the clock with more than ten minutes left in the contest. The Paladins ended up visiting the free throw line 51 times, converting 35 tries to bury the ‘Cats. Paul Denmond’s 19 points and 6 rebounds, and Alan Hunter’s 15 points led the Davidson effort.

Saturday night against Miami of Florida, a Belk Arena crowd of 1,693 saw the Wildcats dominate the first half with patient offense and suffocating defensive pressure. That patience rewarded the ‘Cats with near 50 percent shooting and a 34-26 lead at the intermission. The home team’s fine play and the surprise visit of Terry Holland to Baker Sports Complex had the Wildcat faithful hoping for the end of the Davidson losing streak. Oh well.

Miami coach Bill Foster switched to a smaller, faster quintet for the second twenty minutes, and that lineup came out on fire. A 17-4 spurt to begin the half gave the Hurricanes a lead they would never relinquish, though the ‘Cats scratched to within 56-53 on a basket by Detlef Musch with 4:58 remaining. Though they shot poorly in the second half, the 72-64 defeat did not involve a late collapse on the part of the Wildcats. It was, rather, the Hurricanes’ torrid three-point shooting (11 of 18) that provided the knockout punch. Said McKillop, “You can live by the three-pointer or die by it. In the first half they were missing it, but you see what happened when they started hitting it.”

Leading the way for Miami was freshman Samarr Logan, who feasted on the three-pointer. He finished 7 of 8 from the field, including a perfect 5 of 5 from three-point range, and scored 23 points. Meanwhile, freshman center Detlef Musch was having a career night carving up Miami’s inside players. McKillop explained: “We spread our offense and tried to get the ball into him as much as we possibly could.” The Musch-man responded with career highs of 27 points and 18 rebounds, impressive statistics that earned him status as the ECAC Independent Rookie of the Week. Sophomore guard Paul Denmond, steady as always, contributed 13 points, 5 rebounds, and 4 assists to the Davidson cause.

The ‘Cats, now 2-20, return to the road this week in search of their first win away from home, with games Thursday at Winthrop and Monday at Miami.

The Davidson Wildcat baseball team opened its season this past Sunday defeating the UNC-Asheville Bulldogs in both games of their doubleheader by the scores of 3-1 and 1-0. In the opener, pitcher Greg Wilcox started off shakily as he gave up two-out walks in each of the first two innings. His control problems continued in the third as he walked the first batter on four straight pitches. He followed that walk with a strikeout but gave up a single to theNext batter and then gave up another four-pitch walk to load the bases. A slick 4-6-3 double play executed by Mikio Aoki, Rob Eenhoorn, and Joseph Azzolino got Wilcox out of the inning. In the meantime, the Wildcat offense struggled against UNC-Asheville pitcher, Rick Honeycutt, as he faced the minimum nine batters through three innings. UNC Asheville finally broke the scoring drought in the fourth on a walk, stolen base, and a run-scoring single. It was the last run they would score all day.

In Davidson’s half of the fourth, Eenhoorn led off with a single. Honeycutt balked him to second. Ron Krnacik followed with a bunt single to give the Wildcats runners on first and third with nobody out. Aoki then grounded into a double play which allowed Eenhoorn to score. Ralph Isernia opened the fifth inning with a single and was quickly sacrificed to second. A stolen base put Isernia on third where he eventually came home on a single by Eenhoorn. The sixth inning saw Krnacik and Aoki put together back-to-back doubles which gave the Wildcats their final margin of victory in the opener, 3-1. Wilcox pitched six innings to pick up the win and Brad Wanzenberg pitched the seventh for the save.

In the nightcap, Dave Williams, Jim Stanfill, and Derek Twombly combined to pitch a two-hit shutout. The lone run was scored during a two-out rally in the fourth. Aoki singled and promptly stole second base. His jump was so big it didn’t even draw a throw from the Bulldog catcher. Peter Hughes’ subsequent RBI single was all the Wildcats needed. Hughes almost put Davidson on the board in the second inning as his towering drive came up five feet short of clearing the 395-foot centerfield fence. Williams pitched five innings for the win and Derek Twombly got the final three outs for the save.

The Wildcats are off until this weekend when they face Pfeiffer on Friday at 3:00. Saturday, they meet Radford in a doubleheader at 1:00. The Cats meet Radford again at 2:00 on Sunday. Go watch the baseball team play Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.

On the sports front

A meeting of the Trustees has been called for February 22 to discuss Davidson’s future conference affiliation. And while nothing is sure until the Trustees make it so, it seems likely that the future of Davidson athletics, save for football, lies in the Big South Conference. Despite the fact that conferences such as the Sun Belt Conference and the Southern Conference maintain higher profiles, the Big South seems to be the best fit in terms of the size and geographic location of member schools. Those member schools are Coastal Carolina, Campbell, UNC-Asheville, Winthrop, Augusta, Baptist, and Radford. The Big South holds conference championships in baseball, volleyball, soccer, and basketball, among other sports, and beginning in 1992, a victory in the conference men’s basketball tournament will be rewarded by an automatic berth in the NCAA Basketball Tournament.

Davidson football, on the other hand, seems headed toward the Old Dominion Athletic Conference, a Division III conference whose members include Hampden-Sydney, Randolph-Macon, and Washington and Lee.

Terry Holland should have much to say about this issue and many others when he takes over as Athletic Director, and I must say it was great to see him at Saturday’s basketball game. Holland was in Charlotte foremost for personal business following his Virginia team’s loss at Miami of Ohio, but he did manage to stop in at the game and to meet with Davidson’s women’s coaches, ostensibly to discuss with them the distribution of scholarships among women’s sports at Davidson. All of this leaves me confident that he is commencing already to work his magic upon the Davidson athletic program. And that can foretell only good things ahead.
