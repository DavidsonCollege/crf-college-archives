**New talent, attitude has team back on winning track**

Five years removed from its magical run to the NCAA Final Four, the men’s soccer team hopes to make the upcoming season another to remember. The Wildcats arrived for preseason focused, well-conditioned, and ready to put Davidson back on the college soccer map after a disappointing 1996.

“The guys came in ready to play and in great shape,” said coach Charlie Slagle in an interview last week. “They did more than we asked of them and that obviously makes a coach happy.”

Davidson won only eight of 22 games last season, but even more disheartening was the manner in which the talent-laden Wildcats lost, as the team’s leadership — and, ultimately, its camaraderie — hopelessly unraveled. But both players and coaches promise there will be no repeat performance.

“The thing I am most excited about this season is the team attitude,” said captain Phil Julien, the squad’s top returning scorer. “We're doing what it takes both on and off the field, and the team chemistry is definitely there.”

“It is an entirely different program,” said goalkeeper and fellow captain Brad Stroble. Jeff Weekes and Dan Guill are also captains for this year’s team.

On the field, players are excited about the 1-5-4-1 format Davidson will implement, consisting of one forward, five midfielders, four defensemen, and a goalie.

“Slagle always knows how to get the best out of his players,” Julien explained. “If the forwards were the power of this team, he would be using more players on the line, but this year the defense and midfield are the strength.”

Julien, the team’s primary scoring threat, having accumulated 45 points in the first three years of his career, figures to see the majority of time in the lone forward slot. Carlos Bowen and Wes Roache will also see time up front.

Jeff Harrell and Drew Lindsey should get the starting nod at the two outside midfield positions. Harrell is a third-year varsity player and Lindsey started 12 games last year and saw action in all but one contest.

The center-midfielders showcase the young talent Davidson possesses. Hart Roper, who started 17 games for the Wildcats as a rookie last year, will lead the attack in the middle, along with newcomers Dane Erickson and David Buehler.

**Wildcats try to reclaim Deep South. New coach gains respect**

The first full day of field hockey practice did not involve sticks, balls, or goals. Instead, new coach Jennifer Blizzard Halliday took the team on a surprise trip to a high ropes course at the Charlotte Outdoor Adventure Center.

“I just told them we were going on a team trip,” Halliday said of the innovative way to build team chemistry, confidence, and trust among the players. “They had no idea where they were going. I think some of them were a little scared.”

“It’s a great improvement from last year,” said goalkeeper and captain Sarah Gebhardt. “So far it’s been a great pre-season.”

“I’m really excited,” fellow captain Chase Keith said, echoing Gebhardt’s enthusiasm. “She (Halliday) knows the game really well. She leads an intense practice, but it’s also fun.”

Halliday should know the game well after playing on four consecutive North Carolina teams that finished as NCAA runners-up. She played with and against several members of the U.S. Olympic team that finished fifth two summers ago in Atlanta. She started all four years in high school in her hometown of Ocean City, N.J., and in 1989 was named Atlantic City Press Player of the Decade.

“I thought he was kidding,” she said of the writer who called to notify her of this eye-popping accomplishment. “I started joking with him until he finally convinced me he was serious.”

But there’s no joking around for Halliday when it comes to coaching this year’s field hockey team.

“My mentality is very defen-sive,” she said of her coaching philosophy. “You don’t need to teach good players how to score, but if you take a good player and teach her defensive principles, she can be outstanding.

“I love coaching at a better academic school. I love North Carolina as a state, and I wanted to coach Division I. Plus, it makes my job easier coaching smarter players.” And it allows her to implement relatively advanced systems such as the diagonal diamond defense, a system the Wildcats will employ on all penalty corners taken against them this season.

“We have a strong core of leadership this year,” she added. “Instead of just two or three, we have five or six players who have stepped into that role.” Halliday also stressed the importance of improving throughout the year. “If we achieve our goals during the season, then we’ll achieve the end goal (of winning the Deep South Conference).”

“We want to set the tone for the next wave of Davidson field hockey players,” said Gebhardt. To do that, the Wildcats will have to fare well against strong competition, starting immediately with Saturday’s opener at Virginia. The Wildcats look to regain their form of the early 1990s: They had won six straight league titles before posting a subpar 5-12 mark last year. The home opener is Sept. 6 against Louisville. Other schedule highlights include a trip to Wake Forest on Sept. 9 and two games over Fall Break in Washington, D.C.

The 1992 men’s soccer team shocked the nation by advancing to the Final Four held right here at Richardson Field, electrifying the town and campus. Next week, the DSS begins a semester-long series chronicling the games and players that made up the “most successful Division I athletic team in Davidson history.”

Sophomore midfielder Hart Roper, who played an important role as a rookie last year, is just one reason why coach Charlie Slagle is optimistic about his team’s chances this season.

Noznesky gears up for grand finale
By Michael J. Kruse
Editor in Chief

Born and bred to be a goalkeeper Allie Noznesky was not. An aspiring horseback rider growing up and a five-sport athlete at the Westminster School in Atlanta, she didn’t start playing in net until her sophomore year of high school. She made the decision to play soccer at Davidson just months before she arrived on campus. And once she did, Noznesky didn’t exactly turn any heads as a rookie.

“I played pretty badly for most of my freshman year,” Noznesky admitted in a recent interview. Calling her first season “so-so would be stretching it,” coach Kevin Hundley said. “We were thinking she’d make an OK third goalie.” But since she was granted a starting slot as a sophomore—by default, really—Noznesky has dominated the Southern Conference in a way few goalies ever have and likely ever will.

“It’s a great story in a lot of ways. It’s almost like aliens abducted the person who was here...
