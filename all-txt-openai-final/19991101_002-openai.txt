2 THE DAVIDSONIAN

Partnership creates new
study abroad opportunity

+ Story continued from front page

Director Dr. William Harris.

The collaboration with the Biosphere 2 Center will offer Davidson students an alternative to the traditional study abroad options. Instead
of being immersed in a foreign culture, students will be immersed in a foreign ecosystem studying earth science systems.

The Biosphere 2 Center’s campus is nestled in the foothills of the Santa Catalina Mountains just north of Tucson, Arizona.
The centerpiece of the campus is the Biosphere 2 apparatus, a 3.15-acre enclosed glass and space frame structure housing six
of the earth’s ecosystems in miniature, including a rainforest, a desert, a savannah, and a 900,000-gallon ocean. Biosphere 2 is
an enormously valuable tool for simulating the earth’s systems and experimentally projecting the planet's future under a variety of environmental
parameters. Davidson students will work alongside the Biosphere 2 Center research staff monitoring and adjusting the internal environment of the
system to investigate questions vital to our planet’s future.

Davidson students will live on the 250-acre campus, take classes ranging from Conservation Biology to Law, Politics, and Economics of
Global Change, and conduct a semester-long independent research project. In addition to the surrounding Sonoran desert, Davidson students will embark
on a number of field trips focusing on the region’s geologic, biologic, and cultural diversity. Past field trips have included
the Grand Canyon, Joshua Tree National Park, and the Sea of Cortez in Mexico.

Russell K. Monson, a professor of biology at the University of Colorado, Boulder says of the Earth Semester, “I think
the Earth Semester Program is the single most innovative educational opportunity that has been provided to American college students interested
in environmental studies over the past decade. Our students who have returned from attending Earth Semester have been unanimous in
proclaiming this as a life-changing experience.”

The Earth Semester’s interdisciplinary approach includes a novel form of team-teaching in which each faculty member, during the course of
the morning’s lecture, will lend their particular expertise to the discussion of the environmental issue at hand. For a module
on global warming, the first lecture of the day is delivered by an environmental chemist, focusing on the atmospheric chemistry
of Greenhouse Gases, transitioning to a sedimentologist, on the paleoclimatic evidence for past fluctuations in the Earth's climate. Finally, the
morning would be brought to a close by an environmental economist, with a discussion of the recent attempts by political
leaders to pass international legislation to mitigate the effects of global warming. All faculty members hold Columbia University appointments.

From biology to philosophy majors, all Davidson students are encouraged to take part in the Biosphere 2 Center's programs. Aside
from the Earth Semester, Davidson students will be able to participate in the Biosphere 2 Center’s new Universe Semester, the
Summer Biodiversity Institute, Earth Systems Field School I: Encountering Ecosystems, and Earth Systems Field School II: Earth Systems Management.

Applications are being accepted through November 15 for the Spring 2000 Earth Semester. Interested students should see Dr. Michael Dorcas,
Professor of Biology, for an application or apply online at www.bio2.edu.
