“Wall was not only a good man, but he was a great man.”

At E. Craig Wall Jr.’s funeral on March 7, John Kuykendall delivered the eulogy. The two graduated together in the Davidson Class of 1959, and they led the College together beginning in 1988 as the President and Chairman of the Board of Trustees, respectively. They knew each other well, and Kuykendall’s words, according to Spanish professor Magdalena Maiz-Pena, who attended the funeral, “expressed what we were all feeling.”

Kuykendall’s love for Wall was evident: “Craig Wall was a good and gentle man who tried always to put the spotlight on other people as he was doing things for the welfare of all,” he said. “He was a wonderful role model and a personification of all the good things we try to promote at Davidson.”

Everyone who knew Wall says the same things. He was kind and generous, and he loved Davidson. “He carried a lot of Davidson around with him in his head. It will take time for any of the other trustees to grasp that,” says Dean of Faculty and Vice President of Academic Affairs Robert Williams.

Mathematics professor Ben Klein, who serves on the presidential search committee, says that his devotion was unusual. “If you had to use one word to describe him, it would certainly be loyalty. It’s hard to imagine a more loyal alumnus than he was. He was a tireless worker to the College, and to him the College was not an abstract institution—it was the people that he was concerned about.”

Former SGA President Bill Gullan agrees. “What shone through whenever I was in his presence was his love for Davidson.”

“Davidson trains students for leadership and service,” says Vice President for Business and Finance Robert Norfleet. “I don’t know anyone who exemplifies that more than Craig Wall.”

As the Chairman of the Board, they all say, he was thoughtful and unimposing. “He was on the phone to John [Kuykendall] almost every day,” says Williams. “He had a remarkable recollection of people and events on campus.”

Director of Institutional Advancement Toby Bethea says the “fine” hand of Craig Wall touched all areas of the college. “He always tried to be in touch with members of the college community on a weekly basis, if not more. He displayed his leadership in a very quiet, effective way. He wasn’t talking all the time.”

Norfleet says Wall was always more than happy to help out in any situation. “I always knew that he would welcome a telephone call from me,” he says. Gullan was impressed by his respect for the student body. “He bent over backward to accommodate student requests to be involved in things.”

“Craig was careful not to micromanage, but he was always willing to advise and share the burden,” says President Kuykendall. “He kept Davidson close to him at all times, maintaining a list of campus items with which he was concerned and wanted to help in a little book in his shirt pocket. He had a good appreciation for the academic life although he was never an academic. He was often very quiet, but he didn’t miss a trick. He would always ask what he could do to help... he wanted to be there and to be of assistance. There wasn’t an area that he was not involved in some way.”

Norfleet says that the school is “indebted to him in ways that we cannot understand. We can never fully appreciate the leadership until the gap is there.”

Klein was impressed by Wall’s modesty. “He never wanted to hog the limelight. He was mighty generous [with his own money], but he was also tireless in soliciting funds from other people for the College.”

The College was the beneficiary of much of Wall's generosity. Often, Wall wouldn't accept recognition for his gifts, donating them anonymously. “Besides his major financial contributions,” says President Kuykendall, “he made small gifts for just about every new memorial fund established here as a show of respect for the individuals they honored.”“Wall was involved in seemingly innumerable organizations. Klein says the extent to which he was involved is staggering. And he was really a major player — he wasn’t just signed on so they could use his name. He was a force for good on a scale that most of us could only dream of. I’ve never met anyone who did so many different kinds of good works.”

Above all, they say, Wall was a good man. “He was a terrific guy,” says Klein. “It’s such a shock that he’s gone. He was so quiet and unassuming, people sometimes don’t know how important he was.”

Senior Will Cowan is a good family friend of the Wall family and has known Wall for most of his life. “As I started getting older I realized how influential he was and he still had time to speak with me,” he says. “The thing that was most impressive to me about Mr. Wall,” says Cowan, “besides the fact that he was an incredible business influence in our community, was the incredible time that he spent with family and friends. In high school, he helped me with my Eagle Scout project of painting a church rectory by donating the paint and other supplies that I needed for it, as well as giving me guidance about the house. It’s amazing that he had time for that with everything else that he did.”

Trustee Larry Dagenhart says that Wall was a “wonderful, gentle and kind person who took the time to reach out to people — very unselfish. The last time I saw him he was so proud and happy because his son Ben had gotten to the wrestling finals, and no one had done that since 1968.”

Cowan emphasizes the time that Wall took to spend with his family. “He was very involved in the academics and athletics of his children,” he says. Professor Magdalena Maiz-Pena, who had both of Wall’s sons in class, says “he had very personal gestures. He always found a way to write a personal note or express gratitude. I was able to see how committed he was to the idea of an integral education and the importance of educating your mind, spirit, and heart at the same time. I saw him apply that to his son and students at Davidson. He was a caring and loving father.”

“Who he is and what he does were always in congruence,” says Norfleet. “He was utterly selfless. For a man with such obvious wealth, you would never have known it.”

“Craig always had a wonderfully warm sense of humor,” says Bethea. “He didn’t only laugh with others, but at himself as well. I think that anyone who can do that has a lot of strength,” says Bethea.

Cowan says Wall’s funeral was “amazing. There were around 800 people there. The church was entirely full an hour and a half before. It was a strong tribute; he had so many friends in so many facets of his life. He did so much for so many people.”

Williams sums it up: “Craig Wall was a person of great energy and ability who truly loved Davidson College. He embodied business acumen, religious conviction, respect for the academy, and a concern for others. He lived a life based on what William James once called the three most important values — kindness, kindness, and kindness. We miss him terribly.”

“We will miss him as one of the great leaders of Davidson,” says Dagenhart. “When I walk around campus,” says Bethea, “I can just see Craig standing with his arms folded watching a soccer game, or students, or talking to faculty. He was thoroughly engaged.”

Cowan says President Kuykendall’s eulogy said it well. “He emphasized that Wall was not only a good man, but a great man.”
