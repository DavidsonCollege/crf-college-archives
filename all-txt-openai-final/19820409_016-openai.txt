**Second Chance**

Second Chance is something of a “greatest hits” package for James Chance, who returns to the public ear in the
persona of James White, thematically a demented half-brother to Ornette Coleman. Chance was not so long ago the New York
critics’ darling and the bane of all listeners with small ears with his debut on Eno’s No New York sampler,
followed by strong albums by the Contortions (Buy the Contortions) and by James White and the Blacks (Off White). These
two groups continued the same lineup, fired, hired, and renamed by Chance after their first album.

This is not an easy album to listen to. Chance proves himself a dedicated follower of funk with the steady
groove (often bordering on straight disco) laid down by the bass and drums. However, over this dance beat jangles unnerving
rhythm guitar and slide guitar licks, along with an occasional use of the organ as a percussion instrument. As for
James Chance, he plays the meanest (with emphasis on mean) free jazz alto sax lines in avant-garde fashion. He also
screams out the lyrics like a psychotic soul man. This combination of funk, dissonant jazz, and rock will probably alienate
listeners, which is a shame since this is some of the most imaginative rock and roll to come around in
a while.

Second Chance contains two versions of the Contortions theme song “Contort Yourself.” With nihilistic lines such as “You better try
being stupid instead of smart,” and with the chaotic violence, you’re never quite sure how to take the song or
the singer. At times, Chance is definitely sneering at you, the listener (as in the sleazily fascinating obscene phone call
which is the core of “Stained Sheets”), while at other times serious themes emerge. A common theme from Twentieth Century
jazz may be found in “Almost Black,” where Chance mourns the fact that he isn’t black, since if he was
he would be a better musician and have that ever-elusive quality called “soul.”

Aficionados of “safe” rock and roll will probably find the album confusing and downright unbearable. This is as it should
be. True innovators have always been deemed “wrong”; in jazz look at Taylor, and Dolphy, and Coleman, and Ayler, and
in rock look at Captain Beefheart, and now James Chance. You may hate him, but he will make you think—an
attribute sorely lacking in most music with this good a beat. So give No Wave a chance... listen to Second
Chance!

**Play Within A Play**

The play within a play is always fascinating. But a play within a play within a play? Deathtrap is that
and it truly boggles the mind.

Last Wednesday, April 7, the Hippodrome Theatre of Florida brought Ira Levin’s comedy/thriller to a large and thoroughly entertained audience
in Love Auditorium. When the audience was not laughing at strange characters or clever plot twists, it was sitting back
trying to figure out what would happen next in the story. Or it was screaming.

After the recent traveling flops The Most Happy Fella and Little Chicago, Deathtrap was a breath of fresh air.

The play is about a once-famous playwright, Sidney Bruhl (Richard Bowden), who has failed to write a successful thriller in
many years. When he receives a script from one of his former students, Clifford Anderson (Kevin Rainsberger), who is asking
for critical advice, Sidney begins to consider plagiarism. It gets more complicated from there, and any more elaboration on the
plot would give much of the story away for those who intend to see the movie.

It is very dangerous to criticize a play that was as entertaining as this one. However, it was hard to
avoid wondering how much more amusing, eerie, and suspenseful the play could have been under a better cast. Though Richard
Bowden’s Sidney was adequate, it was missing that sinister sophistication that the role required. He didn’t behave like a clever
and desperate playwright would behave.

Kevin Rainsberger as Clifford supplied about all that was needed for the role. He successfully combined the innocence of a
striving young author with the chutzpah of a ladder-climber.

The first few scenes were hurt mostly by Laura Whyte as Myra Bruhl, Sidney’s wife. Though the actress has over
one hundred TV commercial credits along with three movie credits, her talent was well hidden in Deathtrap. Her face was
frozen into a single cross-eyed expression of panic throughout the play. She even shuddered when Sidney looked out the window.

Whyte’s failings were counteracted by the energetic performance of Maggie Beistle as the psychic Helga Ten Dorp. Helga was a
constant comic relief throughout the play who becomes an important character as the play progresses.

There were flaws. Everything wasn’t perfect. But that did not matter. The script carried the show. Deathtrap is a clever,
skillfully written play that I look forward to seeing in movie form.
