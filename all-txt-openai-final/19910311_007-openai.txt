Beyond Birkenstock
Clandestine Presbyterian Sex Plot Uncovered

Well, kiddies, can you guess what’s going down at your friendly, neighborhood Presbyterian church? We bet you couldn’t—since the number
of you that got up to go to the Gulf Conference is only slightly fewer than the few of you
who get up and go to church on Sunday. Far be it from us to comment on the fact that
the “demonstrated Christian commitment” you displayed on the admission application was written by the same people who now have trouble
dragging their lazy butts out of bed before two o’clock on Sunday afternoon, and only then because State’s playing Tech
at 2:30. In fact, if we were going to comment on something like that, we might also question whether or
not it would be nice if more than two of the faculty showed up at DCPC once in a blue
moon. But, we won’t.

No, the subject of this week’s column (since our ratings have slipped due to serious journalism) involves SEX!!! How, you
may ask your lazy selves, are we going to combine those two pastimes most dear to Davidsonians—church and SEX—into the
same space without someone shouting Hallelujah? Well, you’re all so darn apathetic that we could probably say anything we wanted,
short of revealing George Bush’s Oval Office phone number (which we know, by the way), and nobody would say a
word. Such is life.

Anyway, back to Topeka, it's a different matter entirely when a newspaper like the Observer (on the level of, say...
The NY Post or Hard Copy) makes the same statement. So, since there appears to be some legitimate news here
(known in journalistic terms as ‘An Easy Target’), we felt compelled to bring you the gory details. “The General Assembly
Task Force on Human Sexuality will recommend that the Presbyterian Church (USA) eliminate its ban on the ordination of persons
who practice homosexual activity. It will also recommend that the church make room for adultery and ‘responsible sex’ among singles
in a revised ethic designed to be more relevant to contemporary life.” Interested yet? SEX. And church.

If you’ve been diligently reading your copy of the Presbyterian Layman (and we know that you have), you’re already aware
that there’s some pretty interesting stuff in the Feb. 1991 issue. It's the same issue with that article entitled, “Mission
Worker Labels Sandinista Mass Murders ‘Internal Matters.’” Maybe it is the National Enquirer for Presbyterians. But the headline on the
cover, “G. A. Task Force Revises Sex Ethic,” was interesting enough to read the whole article (maybe there are pictures,
maybe there aren’t—we’re not saying). When The Charlotte Observer ran essentially the same story on its front page, we really
took notice. It's one thing to have the National Enquirer report aliens in Topeka, it's a different matter entirely when
a newspaper like the Observer (on the level of, say... The NY Post or Hard Copy) makes the same statement.

agree with Mr. Smith’s flamboyant interpretation of what I perceive to be a tightly controlled and subtle character. Oh alas,
for another mill. What is missing from this review is any noteworthy mention of Gratiano (Jay Kirtley), Antonio (Ed Cunningham),
or Nerissa (Marya Howell). These three have fewer lines, but their characters are essential. Gratiano has the final lines of
the play. Antonio is the merchant of Venice. Nerissa is a key accomplice. Their performances demand mention. The review of
a play, any play, cannot be undertaken with the attitude, ‘I don’t know anything about theatre, but I know what
I like.’ That is a weak position. Future reviewers, please, please, please read up on the play before you see
it. Please, please, please review the performance, not the author. Sincerely, TOBY TROUG 91° March 8, 1991

horrible. But wait, there’s more: “The task force majority holds that the traditional moral code which restricts human sexual relations
to men and women who live in the covenant of marriage are outdated, oppressive, and unjust... believes that such a
code discriminates against persons who experience unfulfilled sexual needs but who live outside the traditional family structure.”

Open up those prison doors: Let Jim Bakker out of jail! Child molestation--no problem. Bigamy--the more the merrier. Necrophilia--(Whoahhhh... ewww!
Oh, if Thomas Granger only lived today; his buggery would be a blessed event. “The task force majority condemns the
church for promoting traditional morality at the expense of singles, gays and lesbians, and against married persons who have sexual
feelings for persons other than their partners.” Tell that to Moses. Far be it from us to condemn those who
go against their sacred vows of marriage. And doesn’t that “Thou shalt not kill” thing discriminate against murderers? And how
about “Thou shalt not steal?” Release those thieves! And as for Davidson’s Honor Code--it is simply a continuation of that
traditional morality that discriminates against cheats and liars--repeal that blasphemy! Well, it’s kind of interesting to see how liberals everywhere
have the unique ability to screw stuff up. Apparently, this has no real hope of passing, so all of you
saints can breathe a sigh of relief, and all of you sinners can go to hell.

Let Them Get Ahead By Kelly Crews

The origins of female bonding can be traced back to the most primitive hunting and gathering tribes, in which women
were left alone to gather food, cook meals, and care for children. During the long male absences, tribal women, bound
together by their common plight, established intimate relationships among themselves. This close camaraderie between women remained virtually unknown to men
until the feminist movement and the founding of consciousness-raising groups. All of a sudden men realized women were a step
ahead - a concept the male ego could not endure. Making a mad dash to achieve the closeness, intimacy, and
empowerment that women had known for centuries, men searched for their own forms of male bonding. Some men organized male-only
church groups, some spent thousands of dollars for week-long nature excursions, and still others found solace in Robert Bly’s Iron
John. Men, however, need not make such an effort, for male bonding is only as far away as Davidson College.

The first place that male bonding occurs is on the athletic fields. Here, Davidson men express their support and compassion
for their teammates with a tender butt-slap or the ever so gentle helmet-head-butt. Hugging is reserved for women and homosexuals.
Sports-oriented bonding also occurs when college men watch football. Every Monday night, united in a common goal, and sitting side
by side around their electronic idol, they share their innermost frustrations and triumphs. “Can you believe that call?” “What are
you blind? That guy was in!” Not only do they soul-search, but every so often they look to a companion
and indulge themselves in physical intimacy - a high five.

While sports satisfy some men’s desire for male relationships, other Davidson students, searching for something more private, join fraternities. Built
on the glorification of the male, these organizations offer their members closeness through a variety of unique bonding experiences. The
most crucial element of a fraternity is its exclusion of women. To this end, each organization has secret meetings, oaths,
and handshakes. Further attempting to set themselves apart, fraternal groups have even created their own trademark drinks - the hairy
buffalo and the bullfrog punch. Yet, these tactics finally proved too secretive. The fraternities’ activities were not envied, nor, actually
even noticed. They had failed to bond properly. Correct male bonding has to be bold and noticeable. Fraternity men, admired
for their intellect, were quick to develop bonding logos. These symbols previously known as Greek letters come in a wide
array of combinations, but when translated, they all say the same thing - “Notice me, I’m male bonding.” Fraternities should
not be criti- See "Nude" on page 8
