Inside the Code... Student solicitors and defense advisors

Inform your vote: Important yet often poorly understood Honor Council positions explored

By Emily Drew

Senior Staff Writer

Despite the emphasis Davidson’s Honor Code receives in the admissions literature, few students will ever have intimate contact with an actual Honor Council hearing. As such, students may find it difficult to cast an informed vote for student solicitors or defense advisors — two key positions during an Honor Code trial.

In this semester’s category II elections, two new defense advisors and two new student solicitors will be determined. These students will work with the students and professors involved in the Honor Council trials. Last year’s advisors and solicitors will step down after training their replacements later this spring.

“I really learned a lot about Davidson and the Honor Code while serving as a defense advisor,” said Evan Andersen ’02, who hopes that future advisors aren’t intimidated when beginning the job. “The first two times an elected advisor or solicitor participates in a trial, they work with the past advisors or solicitors, the first time observing, the second time being observed.”

Defense advisors—like Andersen or Caroline Cunningham ’02—advise and assist any person accused of a violation of the Honor Code, the Code of Responsibility, or other college regulations. They also provide support for the accused students and help them to understand their options.

“We also research, interview and help determine sanctions along with the student solicitors,” said Andersen.

Although sanctions are ultimately determined by the Honor Council, student solicitors and defense advisors propose possible sanctions at the end of each case. Student solicitors also work with the Dean of Students to determine which cases will actually appear before the Honor Council. “Our job is to investigate the case and to provide the best sanction,” said student solicitor Andy Wright ’02. “Our goal isn’t to ‘win.’ We just try to uphold the Code.”

“It’s every student’s duty to respect, understand, and uphold the Honor Code,” said Student solicitor Trevor Stanley ‘02. He looked around the Union where laptops, bookbags, and wallets were left unattended all over the busy café. “You may not talk about it all the time, but you see it everywhere.”

Remember to Vote for both student solicitors and defense advisors February
