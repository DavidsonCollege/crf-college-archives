Yowl taken

In an unprecedented Honor Council trial, a student has been accused of lying on a survey for a psychology experiment. The student, James Alder ’06, was asked in an email to complete an online survey for a senior psychology student’s experiment concerning the drug use of college students. Alder has decided to make the trial public as he feels he has been unfairly accused.

“The first part of the survey asked for your name, class year, race, whether or not you were in a fraternity, and other basic questions like that,” said Alder. He then reported that the second part contained questions about drug and alcohol use and habits. He claimed to have filled out the survey honestly, although he admits that he may have filled out one question in jest. Alder said, “Question 22 asked ‘Sex?’, and I put ‘no thanks.’ I like to joke around every now and then. I think they wanted you to

Pay-to-play tuition scheme hits science majors

Davidson College has recently announced a new tuition structure separating the prices of science courses from non-science courses for the spring semester 2006. Expensive lab equipment and rising insurance costs for pre-med students have forced tuition costs up for a number of years. While the administration had previously split costs equally among all students, they will now be applied fully to the science majors that use them the most. The expected price tag of being a Chemistry, Biology, or Physics major next semester is projected to be $386,789, while non-science majors’ tuition will fall to $86.

Assistant Dean of Financial Aid Kim Rogers said that the switch makes sense for a number of reasons, “Microscopes and Petri dishes are not cheap. We decided that we had to be fair to students studying disciplines like English and sociology, and stop charging them for equipment that they are not using. Plus, most of these science kids are becoming doctors; they will be able to afford the higher prices easier than someone who’s planning on becoming a high school teacher after graduation.”

Students in Chemistry 283 freeloading for the last time

Davidson is following a recent trend set by a number of other liberal arts colleges over the past five to ten years. Middlebury charged pre-meds in excess of $500,000 a semester last year, while anthropology majors could spend the same amount on their education as a tank of gas.

Responses to this change in policy have obviously differed depending on which side of the academic fence you are on. “This is absurd,” said Dr. Daniel Harding, a professor in the Biology department. “Tuition was too high to begin with, and these prices are just plain exorbitant. How can you justify charging a student studying biology the price of a new home while you ask a political science major to pay the bill for a stay at the Red Roof Inn?” Dr. Harding’s feelings were typical of otherProfessors in his department, but his colleague, Dr. Jane Reid of the economics department, thought otherwise. “It makes economic sense to charge the students that are using the high-priced equipment more than those that are not. Perhaps students with newfound disposable income would like to use some of it on my new textbook.”

“Put ‘male’ or ‘female’ or something like that. If that’s the case, definitely male.”

Question 22, however, is not what Alder is on trial for. The student conducting the survey discovered that Alder had lied on the survey when he observed him last weekend at a party on Patterson Court. The student asked Alder if he had used any illicit drugs during the weekend. The student, who wished to remain anonymous, reported that on his survey, Alder had responded ‘yes’ to a question asking if he had ever tried crack cocaine. When asked “How often do you shoot up heroin?”, Alder had chosen the response, “Frequently (several times a week)”. 

“At the party,” the student stated, “he told me that he actually hadn’t had any heroin this week at all, and only twice since the start of school. This caused me to suspect his fraudulency, so I interrogated him about the rest of his answers.” As it turned out, the psychology student accused Alder of lying on nearly all of the questions involving his drug use. For example, the student claimed, in fact, that he had only tried powdered cocaine. “I hated turning in a fellow student to the Honor Council,” said the psychology major, “but lying on a scientific survey like this undermines the serious academic work I was trying to do.”

Until this last year, surveys such as the one Alder filled out were required to be anonymous. Citing concerns of skewed results due to students lying and a bored Honor Council, the surveys this year are no longer anonymous. “It’s hard to prepare students for the real world of psychological research when they are unable to gather accurate data,” said Psychology professor Dr. Regina Waters. “We made students liable for their responses this year because of just such a circumstance.”

Alder decided to make his trial public because he believes he is being overtly criminalized. “So what if I over-exaggerated my drug use a little?” he asked. “I just wanted people to think I was cooler. It worked too, I totally had like five people come up and ask me for joints last weekend. And anyways, I certainly didn’t lie about Question 32. I do smoke weed ‘frequently’, I blaze it up nearly every day.”

Peaches the chimp, author of Campus Police Blotter

Peaches the chimp, long-time writer of The Davidsonian’s “campus police blotter” recently came forth with his identity as its author. Known for his ability to summarize otherwise insignificant police reports in humorously obtuse and needless language, Peaches revealed his identity in a press conference early Monday morning in an effort to finally quell rumors circulating about campus. Having spent most of the interview calmly picking lice out of his fur, when asked to comment on his recent revelations, Peaches began making spitting noises and screeching at his own shadow.

Peaches received his bachelor’s degree in hotel management from San Diego State, but a failed business venture drove him to journalism. His column appears weekly in The Davidsonian.
