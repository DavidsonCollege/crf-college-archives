**PROF. E. J. CULLUM SUPERVISES GLEE CLUB IN CHOICE OF NEW MEN**

Two Clubs Chosen from a Hundred Candidates—Several New Members for Club This Year

In Shearer Hall, on last Thursday night, the annual try-outs for the Davidson College Glee Club were held. There were
about a hundred candidates present to try out, and this large number led to the forming of two clubs, the
regular college glee club, and a second club of men who did not make the first club but who are
to be held as reserve men. Forty-three were chosen for the first club and 16 were retained for the second.
Some of the men in the second club will very probably be promoted to the first club at some time
during the year.

The try-out was held under the direction and supervision of the new music director, Prof. E. J. Cullum, who comes
to Davidson from Chicago, Ill. Assisting Professor Cullum were the student officers of the Glee Club: John S. Foster, of
Winston-Salem, president; R. E. Wilson, Charlotte, vice-president; P. B. Frye, Blacksburg, S. C., secretary-treasurer, and E. L. Douglas, Augusta, Ga.,
business manager.

The men chosen for the first club are as follows:
First Tenors: C. C. Clarke, Elizabethtown; S. R. Coker, Hartsville, S. C.; J. S. Gray, Richmond, Va.; H. R. Mobley,
Reidsville; J. A. Cannon, Jr., Concord; H. Mc- (Continued on page 8)

**Two Pep Meetings Arouse Enthusiasm**

According to Spike McGee, that Wildcat spirit is not dead by a long shot, and what’s more, with eight Juniors
trying out for positions as assistant cheer leaders, there is promise of exceptionally good backing for the teams this year.

Two assistant cheer leaders will be chosen some time this week from the eight competitors: Jim Embry, Nelson Myers, John
Pope, Bob Grady, John Bradley, Doug Wilkinson, Peewee McElwee, and Kendrick Pritchett. As usual, the cheer leader for next year
will be chosen later from these two assistants and will be awarded a “D” for his service.

“I don’t believe the pep of the student body will be harmed in the least by the discontinuing of the
street parades,” stated McGee. Shirt tail parades, outdoor pep meetings, and bonfires on the Fresh field will take the place
of the former street exhibitions, which were stopped because of objections from the townspeople. The parades will be of the
same type as before, the only change (Continued on page 3)

**IDEAL MODERN COLLEGE PICTURED BY DR. MIMS IN TALK MONDAY NIGHT**

**Conglomerate View of Fresh Imports**

Mr. Average Frosh stood by the small college station mournfully regarding the train from which he had descended as it
rounded the curve and disappeared beyond the mill that parallels the track. When the second, or last coach was lost
to his vision, he turned and slowly made his way up Depot Thoroughfare toward Central Avenue. He had half-expected to
be met at the station by a group of mature Chinese mandarins as he had been summoned early to take
part in the ceremonies of orientation, but since these had not appeared he decided it would be best for him
to look them up.

While crossing the avenue he was accosted by Mr. O. Dignified Senior, who solicitously directed him to the Central Y.
M. C. A. in College Park. Here he registered, tabulated, fumigated and designated to adorn himself with the insignia of
his rank; namely, headgear of characteristic design; after which he (Continued on page 3)

**“Specialization and Culture” the Subject of Noted Lecturer of Vanderbilt—First of Series of Lectures**

Last Monday night, Dr. Edwin Mims, of Vanderbilt University, appeared in the first of the season's public lectures in Shearer
Hall before a large audience of students, members of the faculty and their families. Dr. Mims, who is a noted
lecturer, writer, and sociologist, spoke on “Specialization and Culture,” and the worth of his material held his audience throughout the
lecture. Dr. Mims was introduced by Prof. H. T. Lilly, who studied under him at Vanderbilt University.

Woodrow Wilson's ideal of a modern college of liberal arts, and the tendencies of modern schools to get completely away
from that ideal, formed the chief topic of Dr. Mims’ address. Wilson, speaking at the Sesquicentennial celebration of Princeton University,
called his ideal college “a place where men find a center of learning; a free place, a place of sagacious
men—men who (Continued on page 3)

**Charlotte Pastor Talks at Vespers in Shearer Sunday**

The Vesper services on Sunday evening were most impressive. The speaker of the evening was Dr. Albert Sidney Johnson, pastor
of the First Presbyterian Church of Charlotte. Following the devotionals, Dr. Richards introduced the speaker of the evening. The text
that Dr. Johnson took was from the first chapter and eighth verse of the book of Daniel, “And Daniel purposed
in his heart not to defile himself with the king’s dainties.”

The speaker took up the subject by showing how Daniel and his companions were in a strange land and were
surrounded by all the temptations of the king’s court. Under such conditions as these, there was the greatest test of
a man’s soul. Man’s life is a series of crises and Daniel’s life typified this. There were many temptations for
Daniel to abandon his moral standards and ideals, but he did not. He was steadfast in his faith. The same
temptations that confronted Daniel confront the college man of today, went on Dr. Johnson. There are as many temptations in
the average college as there is room for. Although Davidson is renowned for its high standards, that is no reason
why there are no temptations here on the campus. The college man is greatly urged not to be too exacting
inhis moral standard. It is reported that men do not like those who stand out in the conviction of the
high standard, but was there ever a man who was greatly respected and who did not have a high standard
of morality? Custom, he said, is a great thing. Much is done in the name of custom. Men do many
things that are not right merely because all the rest are doing it. It takes a great deal of will
power not to do what all the rest are doing. In regard to college life, said Dr. Johnson, there are
four things which it lacks. The first is the lack of individualists. They are the ones who stand above the
others for their convictions. Nearly every college man is die-stamped. The second is that the college man lacks responsibility. When
a man reaches college age he should take on some moral responsibility. The responsibility belongs to the man. The third
is that lack of (Continued on page 5)

The initial action of the 1927 season will be executed Saturday afternoon. Great interest is evident in the opening game
and little is being said on the campus in regard to the outcome, but there will be approximately 600 of
the students on the field when the opening whistle blows, to do their bit. “Spike” McGee will have his yelling
Freshmen ably backed by the older heads, driving the “Wildcat Wild.”

This is the first time these teams have met since 1923, when the Cadets were taken under cover by the
Wildcats by a 7-0 count. The seemingly ancient custom of playing Elon the opening game has been altered and they
are being played later on in the season. This makes the available advance dope on the game rather scarce. One
sport writer picks Davidson to win by a small margin, while another picks the Citadel to be victor in the
same manner, so there is much in store for the horde of spectators that are expected at the game.

Unusually warm weather has caused the training to be rather light and stiff work-outs have been few. Coach Younger ran
his men in a rather hard scrimmage against the Freshman team Saturday afternoon, but nothing spectacular occurred as they had
an easy time with the Freshmen. Present prospects are that there will be two heavy teams on the field at
this opening game. Davidson has the heaviest team this year that have worn the red and black jerseys for quite
a few seasons, and dope from the Citadel camp shows them to have some heavy men. The Citadel team as
well as the Wildcats have lost several of the letter men from last year’s lineup. Nothing definite can be said
of the South Carolina team, but rumors are out about a great central section of the line. Bull King and
Figg are tackles beginning their third year on the varsity, weighing 178 and 189 pounds respectively, and they are showing
up best of their careers this season. Skelton, Thompson, and Howard will probably fill the center and guard positions.

The Davidson team in their present form will average around 165 pounds. The backfield will be unusually light, averaging 152
pounds. These men should be unusually fast and finding the holes which a heavier line opens up. The old line
has been replenished, with extra weight taking the place of experience. The tentative line-ups for the game follows:

Citadel—Weight Pos. Davidson—Weight
Eppe—144 End Arrowood—160

Intensive Tryouts Held for Davidson College Orchestra

The Wildcat Serenaders, Davidson’s foremost interpreters of the Spirit of Jazz, are holding regular practices in preparation for another season.
Three men were lost from last year’s orchestra, R. B. McConnell at the drums, Billy Wilson and Raymond Walters at
the saxophones. These players will be sorely missed, but there is a lot of good material trying out for their
places. Sam Coker, a Sophomore, is slated to handle the drums, while there are several new men who are after
the saxophone berths.

The old members of the jazz orchestra are C. J. Albright, who, for the past year, besides skillfully handling the
banjo, has been the director. A. J. Thompson plays the saxophone, doubling with the clarinet. At the piano is Paul
G. Fry, who has easily shown his supremacy as a pianist. Then there is our gymnast, Gordon McSwain, who simply
overflows with pep as he produces sounds from his trombone unequalled by others. C. C. Orr also plays the saxophone,
and Hoot Gibson the helicon. B. H. O. Gerr, with his super-skill with the first trumpet, is an essential of
the orchestra.

The new men trying out are Dodson, saxophone; J. R. McCravey, second trumpet, and as before mentioned, Sam Coker at
the drums. The Freshmen responded to the call for try-outs of new talent. For the past year the orchestra has
consisted of eight members, but they hope to add two new instruments this year. The Serenaders have been practicing intensively
and will be in excellent style soon. During this year they expect to have the aid and co-operation of Professor
Cullum, of the newly founded Department of Music, who will be a material contribution to their further success.

They will, as they have in the past, act as a unit of the Glee Club, making all the trips
with that organization. But besides this, the Serenaders have an extensive program all of their own from which the members
gain quite a substantial recompense.

Over seven hundred men died in New York last year from poisoned liquor.

Big men never neglect the little things.

College students have a yearning for knowledge; a place where men are used to the rough ways of democracy, yet
a place secluded from the passing world, set apart as a nunnery where the mind might roam with the ancients
without the blare and distraction of the material world. This ideal college was contrasted by Dr. Mims to the popular
conception of col- (Continued on page 8)

New Features Proposed for “Quips and Cranks”

Photographer for the Annual Coming the First Week in October

Witt Hancock, the editor of the “Quips and Cranks” for the coming year, announces that during the first week in
October the photographer for the annual will be at Davidson to take the photographs for the “Quips and Cranks.” In
accordance with the plan inaugurated last year, each member of the student body will have an individual picture. One of
the features of the 1928 yearbook which will be similar in some respects to that of 1927, will be the
carrying out of a historical theme. The nature of this theme is not yet ready for publication. It is known,
however, that the figure will be one connected with Davidson College and will be of interest to the students as
a whole.

The present annual staff has had much experience and has shown itself to be very capable in the past, so
the 1927 “Quips and Cranks” should in every way be the equal to that of the past year, which was
an excellent one. This year’s annual will have several new points of interest, notably the introduction of student art work.
Glenn Fry, the art editor, will have charge of this, and it is intended that much of the drawing such
as the introductory pages to the different departments, which has been done in the past by professional artists, will be
done by the students. It is thought that this will prove satisfactory, though the last attempts at student illustrating were
rather discouraging.

Work has already begun on the 1928 yearbook, and it will go to the press in time to be in
the hands of the students before the summer vacation begins.
