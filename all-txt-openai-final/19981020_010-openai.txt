**Layperson’s View of Verdi’s “Aida”**

Charlotte Performing Arts Groups Collaborate

By Carrie ARTHUR, News Editor

Last Saturday, I went with a friend to see Giuseppe Verdi’s “Aida,” one of three operas in Opera Carolina’s 50th
season. Being by no stretch of the imagination an opera expert, I’ll try to give a reasonable layperson’s review.

“Aida” tells a tragic love story set in ancient Egypt during a war with Ethiopia. The daughter of the Ethiopian
king, the title character Aida is a captive and slave of the Egyptians. Serving the Egyptian princess Amneris with her
own rank unknown, Aida falls in love with the young, ambitious Egyptian hero Radames, who returns her affection. Unfortunately, Amneris
also loves Radames.

Once the priests ordain that the gods have chosen Radames to lead the Egyptians, he leaves for war and returns
victoriously with prisoners, one of which is Aida’s father Amonasro disguised as a foot soldier. In honor of Radames’s victory,
the pharaoh betrothes Radames to Amneris so that Radames will one day rule Egypt.

Amonasro secretly meets with Aida while Amneris and Radames are praying with the priests, and he urges Aida to probe
Radames for military secrets so that Ethiopia can win the war. Although Aida first refuses, Amonasro convinces her with his
condemnation and description of her ravaged country. Then, Amonasro hides as Radames comes to meet Aida and to discuss their
fate. As Aida persuades Radames to forsake his country, glory, and honor and to run away with her, she surreptitiously
gets Radames to tell her the Egyptian army’s planned route. Amonasro then reveals himself, and Amneris overhears and turns Radames
in to the priests.

As the guards and priests come for them, Amonasro and Aida escape while Radames remains to meet his destruction. Refusing
to defend himself and to refute the priests' charges of treason, Radames surrenders himself.

**Volume and Variety Reign at Mickey & Mooch**

By Saran E. OGDEN, Editor in Chief

After two and a half years of Lake Norman dining experiences, I can honestly say that I’ve gotten to the
point where I’d almost rather drive-thru for a Happy Meal than sit down at most of the micro-brewing, chain-y restaurants
in the area. Now, though, everything is different. This past weekend, my dining boredom became no more. This past weekend,
I experienced Mickey & Mooch.

Located on Sam Furr Rd. (across the street from Hops, in the Old Navy/Target shopping center), Mickey & Mooch offers
fine dining at Taco Bell prices. And unlike, say, Hops or Chili’s or Carrabba’s, Mickey & Mooch doesn’t subject its
diners to the bland and unimaginative dishes that characterize so many of our area’s chains. The menu contained such out-of-the-ordinary
delights as Lobster Martini (an appetizer) and blue cheese cole slaw (one of several side dishes). The atmosphere is noisy,
yet elegant, featuring a monstrosity of a bar (in the sense that the bar is massive) and murals of movie
scenes from an era long gone — more Frank Sinatra than Bing Crosby, though.

My long, black and silver dress with the fishtail thing at the back wouldn’t have looked out of place, but
sadly, most dress ranged from khakis and Oxford shirts to jeans and T-shirts. Mickey & Mooch offers a wide variety
of seafood, steak, chicken, pasta, and even ribs. They also list specialties such as shrimp and grits, Cajun catfish, and
a lobster and filet combo — all at amazingly affordable prices (most likely due to the aforementioned monstrosity of a
bar).

We showed up around 8 p.m. on a Saturday, without a reservation (although I found out that you can make
them until 4 p.m. on the day you want to dine). I expected to be waiting until breakfast to be
seated, but surprisingly, we waited little more than an hour and even managed to sit in the non-smoking section. The
service was attentive but not pushy, the pace...Leisurely. And the food was out of this world. I ordered grilled salmon
in a champagne cream sauce with homemade mashed potatoes and Haricot Verts (a.k.a., French green beans) for $11.95. Being thus
far seriously impressed with Mickey & Mooch (whoever they are), I expected to enjoy my dinner — and I did.
I didn’t expect to enjoy it twice, but when my food arrived on a plate larger than my head, I
knew I would be getting more than one meal out of this. (Perhaps the Styrofoam containers should have clued me
in.)

The best part about Mickey & Mooch by far, though, was the unlimited number of Shirley Temples I enjoyed during
my dining experience. Every time I took the last drag from my glass, Mary (our server for the evening) was
there with another one, full to the brim. And who am I to refuse a Shirley Temple? In fact, Mary
was there any time we needed anything — more bread, more water, a dessert menu (we passed on that one).
And unlike the McDonald’s drive-thru, we actually got what we ordered.

As far as its place in Davidson life, Mickey & Mooch will soon become the really slick place to go
before a semi-formal. Unlike other eateries around here, the atmosphere is posh enough to support even the most formal of
dress — definitely an “I feel cool” kind of place. I have to warn you that, if the idea of
shouting at your date to be heard makes you nervous, you might want to try somewhere quieter. But if you’re
in for an adventure, give Mickey & Mooch a try. You'll like it, I promise.

Despite Amneris’s remorseful pleas, the priests refuse to relent, and Radames is entombed alive. Radames enters the tomb, and once
the last stone is set, Aida emerges from behind to die with him. The opera ends with the death of
the lovers and Amneris lying prostrate above the tomb. All of the main cast, except for those playing Amonasro, the
Messenger, and the High Priestess, were debuting at Opera Carolina. Marquita Lister, Aida, and Craig Sirianni, Radames, impressed me the
most with their talents. The main cast had sound resumes, and Sirianni has worked with Placido Domingo.

The set was focused around a magnificent 10,000 revolving golden falcon. The falcon, white steps and sides, and lights producing
hieroglyphic images recreated an Egyptian temple or pyramid. Along with the costumes based upon the original Victorian ones, the set
produced an interesting effect. A screen with supertitles above the stage was a big help since I don’t speak Italian,
but I enjoyed hearing the opera sung in its original language. The entire production made for an enjoyable evening. In
my far-from-expert opinion, the cast did well in both singing and acting, and the dancers from the North Carolina Dance
Theater, the chorus, and orchestra all made the performance even better. The Symphony itself was worth going to hear without
the singing, which was excellent. Aida’s portrayal of the cruelty of war, doomed love, and twists of fate pulled at
my emotions and followed a tradition of star-crossed lovers. I'll definitely go to the next Opera Carolina performance, Don Giovanni,
on Feb. 4, 6, or 7.

One more note FYI — the Fifth Street Cafe (I think that’s what it is called) is a great place
to eat. The restaurant is located in an old seamstress shop, which is protected by the Historical Preservation Society (again,
it’s my best guess of the name). Art decorates the walls, the food is great (especially the baked brie and
Eddy O's pasta), and the atmosphere is pleasant.

Why DIDN’T YOU REVIEW THE GUSTER/TRAIN CONCERT? You could’ve, you know. Next time, call Wes (x6569).
