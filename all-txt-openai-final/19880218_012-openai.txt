The undefeated season is not obsolete
By CHRIS HUGHES

When asked about Indiana, most college basketball fans would immediately think of last year’s national champion Hoosiers. Some who have been around a bit longer would also think of the 1981 team with Isaiah Thomas that took the title. However, there have been three title teams at IU under coach Bob Knight. The least remembered would be the 1976 champions, perhaps the greatest team of the past twenty years. What is significant about that bunch of Hoosiers is that they won the championship with a spotless 32-0 record. In the eleven seasons since, no team has been able to accomplish this feat.

The fact is, clearing the plate in college basketball in the 1980s is an impossible dream. It almost seems as if it is even impossible to go unbeaten within a given conference. Take the case of Arizona. The Wildcats are a certified top-five team in a conference which probably lacks another team in the top forty. However, Arizona went to Stanford this past weekend and fell to the second-place team in the Pac 10. Likewise, we can look at UNLV. The Rebs are certainly the class of their league but have lost twice to Cal-Santa Barbara. At this writing, there are only three major teams still unbeaten in their conferences: Temple, BYU, and Kansas State. We can reasonably expect that these teams will lose somewhere along the line.

There are several factors that make the undefeated season obsolete:

1. Television - Television gets blamed for most everything evil in sports today so we may as well use it here too. With the dawn of the 80s came an onslaught of TV coverage in college hoops. The best high school players can now sit home and watch teams from all over the country play rather than only seeing the big names on Saturday afternoon. In the past, a prep all-American would have gone to Notre Dame so the folks back home could watch him play. Now, he could just as easily go to Auburn or New Mexico. This all leads to a spreading of the talent among more teams so there are fewer unbeatable teams playing fewer unbearable teams.

2. Wealth of talent - Basketball has become a much more popular game in the past decade. It has spread to parts of the country where football had reigned supreme. The fact that there are simply more people interested in the game, and therefore more talented players to go around. As above, this can only mean that the level of talent is equal on a wider scale.

3. Rules - It almost seems as if the NCAA knew what they were doing for once. In 1973, freshmen were made eligible to play varsity ball, thus spreading out the talent even more. In addition to this, the NCAA reduced the number of active scholarships a team may have as well as the size of coaching staffs. Not only does this keep teams...

4. Number of teams and number of games - In 1976, there were 235 Division I teams each playing an average of 26 games per season. Last year there were 290 teams playing 29.6 games per season. With more teams out there and longer seasons, it only makes sense that it would be harder to win all of those games.

5. Tournament play - Tied into the fact that more games are being played is the fact that these extra games are usually in tournaments. All but three conferences (the Big Ten, Ivy, and AMCU) play post-season conference tournaments. So we are more than halfway through the season and the last of the undefeated teams fell this past weekend. So we won’t be adding another name to the list of teams that have gone without a loss. In college hoops today, even the best around have to take their lumps before they can be crowned national champs.

BSC’s Cool Breeze wins title, 48-47
By MATT TERRELL

Another season of IMAC basketball has drawn to a close and the champions have been crowned. If you think there was parity in the college ranks, the teams down in Johnston Gym provided parity in the form of close games throughout the rankings. Exciting tournament action took place in the Women’s, Men’s B-League, and Men’s A-League tourneys.

In the Women’s League tournament, the always powerful “Insatiables” claimed yet another title with a victory over the “Clueless Freshmen” of 4th Rich. The “Insatiables,” seeded first in the pre-tournament rankings after a strong undefeated regular season, emerged from the winner’s bracket after facing the “Clueless Freshmen” to play in the Championship game. The Clueless Freshmen, seeded second after an impressive undefeated regular season, suffered their first loss to the Insatiables in the tournament, only to come out of the loser’s bracket for a rematch in the Championship. The game saw an outsized but not outhustled Clueless Freshmen team shoot well, but the Insatiables played a solid game in both shooting and rebounding, thus claiming the league title with an unblemished record. Congrats to the Insatiables!

The Men’s B-League tournament saw 32 teams trying for the title under a single-elimination system. The Championship game between “Stop Whaaring” and the “Mantools” was an exciting matchup. The Mantools of 4th Little reached the title game after handing “Bobee Marlin’s Blank Shooters” a defeat in the semifinals. Stop Whaaring reached the final game after squeaking out a tough one-point victory over “Cooter’s Nest.” In the final game, Stop Whaaring was without the services of one of their players due to his suspension. This player was ejected from a game after striking an opposing team’s player and causing a cut requiring stitches. Some form of probation has been levied against this player for next year. Despite the absence of this player, Stop Whaaring claimed the title with a seven-point victory over the Mantools Tuesday night. The game saw the eventual champions take a three-point lead late in the game and hold on for victory after insurance points in the form of a three-pointer and a last-second basket. Congratulations to the champions.

Men’s A-League play came to an exciting close Wednesday night as “Cool Breeze” of BSC defeated “King Cobra” of SAE 48-47 on a last-second layup by Mike Jones. King Cobra held a slim 22-20 lead at the half, as both teams played conservatively. The second half was IMAC at its best, as both teams traded baskets for the first ten minutes. Then King Cobra asserted its strength and raced to a 43-35 lead with 1:58 to go. Then Darryl Bego took control of the contest as he connected on two quick three-pointers to cut the lead down to three with fifty seconds remaining. Cool Breeze had to resort to fouling at this point, and the technique paid off. With 30 seconds to go, Mike Friedlander missed the front end of a one-and-one. Cool Breeze got the rebound and responded with a basket with less than 20 seconds left to cut the deficit to one. King Cobra again went to the line and again came away empty. However, an errant pass gave possession back to King Cobra with 9 ticks on the clock. Tracy Hankins was fouled on the inbounds play and went to the stripe with a chance to pad the lead. Hankins missed the front end and Charlie Showers hauled down the rebound. He passed to Marcus Allen, who in turn dribbled to half court with three seconds left. Allen appeared ready to uncork a desperation shot when he spotted a wide-open Jones under the basket. Jones hauled in the pass and calmly laid the ball off the glass as the horn sounded to give Cool Breeze the coveted championship.
