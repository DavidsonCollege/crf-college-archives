Vanderbilt University—An extensive campaign is now being waged for raising $200,000 for a new hospital to be known as the
Galloway Memorial Hospital. Such a large hospital will enlarge the clinical facilities of the Vanderbilt Medical School and will strengthen
her claim to the title of being one of America’s best medical colleges.

FOR SALE—One Winchester Repeating Rifle; 30-30 calibre; good as new; listed at $16.50: for $8.00 cash. John W. MacConnell.
