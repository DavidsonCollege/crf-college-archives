Great souls have wills, feeble ones have only wishes. —Chinese Proverb.

In Your Voting

For the next month the student body will choose its leaders. It is so easy to pick up a ballot,
mark it carelessly, and stick it back in the hymn book rack. It is so easy for the majority of
the voting body to take its responsibility this lightly. It is so easy to pick the wrong man. Consider the
candidates fairly, and designate your preference independently. Don't let others influence you unless you feel they are unbiased and conscientious
in their opinions.

Charity Raver

Report has it that the “Y” Fund is not faring so well this year. Students are even more loath to
fulfill their pledges. And this indicates something drastically wrong with those “backers-down.” A pledge, although not binding, should mean something.
It isn't to be dismissed as a rash promise. We can put hundreds of dollars on dance bands, can spend
hundreds on spring dress. But we cannot sacrifice a relatively small amount for a Christian cause. It is this sort
of thing that makes us wonder if youth today has any religion at all. Not that giving is basically a
part of religion. It is only when it is backed by the spirit. Cannot we do something about this situation?

Keep Your Opportunities

During the next few weeks, the College offers the student a variety of entertainment which he cannot afford to miss.
Such opportunities should not be passed up. This year, music of a high type has been brought within reach of
every student. There have been no fees on the concert series. There are several lectures scheduled for next month. The
thought that many colleges our size have no such cultural opportunities should awaken one to the fact these things should
not be missed.

Publication Elections

Every year there is considerable dissension over the matter of the student body electing the campus editors. This dissension usually
comes from members of the staff who believe that elections would be fairer if the staff were to vote for
their editor. Chief object: fairer selection. However, politics would undoubtedly enter staff elections and consequently they would be even more
unfair. However, when the student votes for a campus editor, he ought to have some idea of the man’s qualifications.
Nor is this possible unless the voter makes it a point to find out. And the voter should try to
find out from some unbiased man on the staff, if there is such, just who knows the work best and
promises to be the best editor.

The Literary Societies

Just because the two literary societies on the campus are not exclusive, purely honorary organizations, most of us are all
too prone to overlook the worth in them. Granted that an occasional man joins to get his picture in the
annual. Granted that the requirements for admission are not rigid. Granted that, in some cases, the programs are not all
they should be. But these things are unimportant compared with the fine things obtainable from a literary society. Of course,
it is assumed that the societies offer training in public speaking and rules of order. There is one asset that
the literary society can offer that no other organization on campus can offer: a graphic picture of uncensored and true
campus opinion. The Davidsonian is supposed to show campus opinion on current questions, but for various reasons this cannot always
be done. Here is where the literary society steps in. A question is opened to the floor and any member
of the society may get up and vent his feelings. From the subject, a really thoughtful and insightful student thought
can be obtained. The democratic nature of the literary organizations is largely responsible for this. Secondly, the opportunity to speak
and express opinion is offered. Thirdly, opinions are seldom offered without some well-applied thought on the question. Make it a
point to attend one of the society meetings in the near future, on a night when the discussion will be
open. It is a revelation.

Senior Slants “THINGS TO REMEMBER”

At this time of the year, with just a few short weeks before we graduate and before all will be
over, there are some things on which a senior would like to look back—things he hopes he'll never forget. I
think any student who has had the opportunity to see our athletic teams in action this year has had an
experience that he should cherish the rest of his life. It is hard to imagine anyone sitting undisturbed through our
football game with Duke last fall. The final score showed a victory for Duke, but it did not show the
really important thing: the group of eleven courageous men, a light Davidson team, fighting all the way and holding, only
to give way, finally, to exhaustion and terrific odds. Again this spring our basketball team suffered a big disappointment, only
a pitifully few points keeping it out of the conference tournament. It would be pleasant to remember our game here
with Clemson as typical of the games we played. To say the going was tough would be putting it mildly.
With the invitation to the tournament at stake and backed by a fickle student body, the team played its very
heart out. With a team that plays like that, what’s the difference who wins? Of course, it would be more
pleasant to win, but what is victory compared with the satisfaction of knowing THAT YOU HAVE FOUGHT A GOOD FIGHT;
THAT YOU HAVE KEPT THE FAITH? That itself is a victory that can never be taken away. Where do we
get the idea that we have a spirit? Do we get it from the excess of wins over losses? Of
course not. From the way we play the game we have well deserved the reputation of having a spirit unequaled
anywhere. It is up to us to keep it alive and to pass it on. It is a privilege to
be a member of a student body so well represented by our teams. Persuaded to come to Davidson by a
brother, a student of another college, but who had seen the spirit, I thank my lucky stars I came here.
It is indeed a pleasure to offer my humble contributions to the spirit of the Wildcat, the spirit that never
dies. —JOE KELLCAM

Fees for out-of-state students at Louisiana State University are now on a reciprocal basis, being the same charged Louisiana students
to attend the state university from which a student comes.

Columbia University students have asked President Nicholas M. Butler to apologize for not allowing Robert Burke to speak at a
student club meeting.

Tulane University officials are considering instituting a non-compulsory course in naval science and tactics.

Princeton U. has the largest collection of death masks (“portraits in plaster”) in the United States.

Through the discovery of oil on its land, the University of Texas has profited to the extent of $17,500,000.

The senior class at Muhlenberg College is allowed to plant ivy if they are all bachelors. No ivy has been
planted for 25 years.

Voters Should Know Candidate's Qualifications

A few weeks ago when Boru mentioned the more pious brethren of our student body ‘flapped their wings and threw
up their hands in holy horror. Now that elections are upon us, we find ourselves asking the question, “For Whom
Shall I Vote?” This question we ask particularly when thinking of a number of important offices, such as editor of
The Davidsonian, president of the YMCA, editor of the annual, etc., in all of which organizations the student body has
no opportunity to see the members at work. If we think honestly, we will readily admit that we have no
idea what man has the most ability or has done the most work giving promise of a conscientious fulfilling of
these duties. This thought, I dare say, comes to most men in the student body, but what do they do?
Instead of investigating the qualifications of these candidates from an authoritative source, the students cast a vote influenced by the
motive of benefit to some small group on the campus rather than to the college as a whole. Sometimes the
vote is even more thoughtless, as in the case when an upperclassman in the freshman year earmarks a candidate as
“the man” for a future office, the upperclassman failing to consider the complete metamorphosis undergone by a man between his
freshman and senior years. This classification tends strongly to eliminate from consideration any men whose talents develop later, or even
any men who had less talkative supporters among the upperclassmen. The paramount reason why votes are cast so thoughtlessly is
because finding out each candidate's qualifications...requires positive effort. So long as the student body votes by the easiest process, the
only way to get men to vote wisely is to subject them to controlled politics. This is well expressed in
Hamilton's Federalist. That great statesman said: “There may readily be distinguished the obvious interest of a certain class of men
in every state, to resist all changes which may hazard a diminution of the power, emolument, and consequence of the
offices they hold under the state establishment.”

Yours for a better Davidson,
-BORU.

Over One Hundred Students Take Wasserman Test...

Dear Editor,

In your last issue W.T.R advises that all college students be required to have a Wasserman blood test when their
annual physical examination is made. The suggestion is wise insofar as requiring a blood test on all new students, but
it is not at all necessary as an annual requirement. I have entreated all students repeatedly by publication and announcement
to report to the infirmary and have this test made absolutely free of charge. Over one hundred have responded and
only one has been faintly positive, showing almost a complete absence of syphilis among our students. All employees of the
Student Store and helpers in the dining rooms are required by our state law to have an annual Wasserman. I
have tested all janitors every year. I trust that this notice will bring many students to us this week for
their blood tests. Our files are confidential and are not a matter of college record, being held as professional communications.

J. W. MacCONNELL, M.D.

From Campus of private colleges

The sharp range of salaries of professors in U.S. has been revealed. Professors’ salaries vary from a low median of
$2,606 to a high median of $4,676 in different types of publicly controlled colleges and universities, and from $1,662 to
$5,733 in groups of privately owned institutions. Similar variations were revealed in typical salaries received by associate professors, assistant professors,
and instructors in both public and private institutions. In land-grant colleges and universities, the minimum salary of the presidents is
$4,590, while the maximum compensation is $27,000. This contrasts with the minimum and maximum of 1921-1922 which were $5,000 and
$16,200 respectively.

Women primp for the same reason men drink—to bolster their morale. They dress chiefly to make an impression on their
own sex, rather than to win the approval of men, declared a psychology professor at De Pauw University. A “date”
boycott is in force at the U. of Washington against all coeds who wear sheer silk hose. It was started
by the American Student Union, to stay in force until March—and here comes the hot air of politics purring like
a lion to permeate the atmosphere for the next two months. The Hail-Fellow-Well-Met guys now can loll and live on
the returns of their smile investment. I only hope that they are disappointed... Too many competent and capable men are
available for honors to be misplaced upon a bunch of “smiles” and outstretched hands. Choose the Man, not the Mannerist.
