Students Attend Relations Party In Statesville

On Thursday, November 20 and Friday, November 21, members of the International Relations Club will attend an Educational and Civic
Conference on United Nations. The conference, which is to be held in Statesville, N.C., is sponsored jointly by Lions International
and the North Carolina Collegiate Council for United Nations.

Davidson men planning at present to attend the conference are R. H. Gambrell, C. D. Williams, J. T. Riddervold, J.
C. Pritchard, and Dr. Guerrant of the Political Science Department. The above will attend Thursday night. Students at the time
planning to be present Friday night are A. S. Demarest, E. B. Bingham, and W. Taylor, president of the International
Relations Club at Davidson.

A banquet which will be held Thursday night, November 20, in Statesville’s Vance Hotel, will formally open the conference. His
Excellency, Oscar Ivanissevich, Ambassador from Argentina to the United States, will deliver the address at the opening banquet. A student
and faculty representative ball honoring Ivanissevich will be held immediately after the banquet.

On Friday morning, November 21, group discussions and a plenary session of all students, faculty members, and guests attending the
conference will be held at Mitchell College. Early Friday afternoon a forum at which His Excellency, Sava Kosanovic, Ambassador from
Yugoslavia to the United States, will be guest speaker, is to be held. Davidson’s IRC President Taylor will act as
moderator of this forum. The question to be considered is, “What is the relation of the Communist Information Bureau to
the United Nations?” As it is thought by some that the Communist Information Bureau is an outgrowth of the old
Communist International which was disbanded during the war, this should prove to be of considerable interest.

Later Friday afternoon His Excellency, Oscar Ivanissevich, Ambassador to the United States from Argentina, will be guest speaker at a
second forum. The topic to be taken up by the second discussion group is a consideration of the present status
of the good neighbor policy. The discussions and forums will be presented Thursday night, all day Friday, and Friday night.
Davidson's delegates, however, will not be given excused cuts by the college for attendance Friday morning because the IRC has
once previously, in October, attended a conference of this nature in Chapel Hill.

The conference will close with a banquet and ball which will be held at the Statesville Country Club on Friday
night, November 21, at 7 p.m. His Excellency, Sava Kosanovic, Ambassador from Yugoslavia to the United States, will deliver the
address at the closing banquet.

The Collegiate Council for the United Nations, of which Lincoln S. H. Kan is state director, has been extremely active
within the past year in awakening the interest of North Carolina college students to the national and individual significance of
the United Nations. In organizing this coming conference, the Collegiate Council for United Nations has worked jointly with Mr. Hugh
G. Mitchell and Mr. Dan W. Rigby. Mr. Mitchell, a former United States legal adviser to the United Nations, is
at present chairman of the Statesville Lions Club Committee on Arrangements for the joint Lions and CCUN Conference on the
United Nations. Mr. Rigby is president of the Statesville Lions’ Club.

Le Circle Francais Holds Meeting

At the last meeting of Le Circle Francais held November 11 at the home of Dr. Watts, the following new
members were introduced: George B. Anderson, W. Davis, Hunter, Shure Swink, C. L. R. M. Caldwell, T. P. D. Goodrum,
E. M. Paul Jones, W. C. Little, J. Murray, A. M. Upchurch, and W. F. Williams. After the introductions and
a presentation of two French skits, the group then played French games.

Noted Traveler Is Scheduled to Speak In Chapel Tuesday

Malcolm Adiseshiah, who will address the Davidson student body in the chapel on November 25, 1947, has been active for
more than seventeen years in the World Student movement. An expert on student and university needs in South Asia, he
has traveled through all the countries of Central and Eastern Europe as well, in his capacity as associate general secretary
of International Student Service.

The needs of students in Europe and Asia differ in one great essential, says Dr. Adiseshiah. In Europe, the university
problem is one of restoration; in Asia, the problem is expansion on a vast scale. Education systems in all Asiatic
countries have been good as far as standards were concerned, but they have been hopelessly inadequate to educate the great
mass of the people. The schools—the entire educational systems in the Asiatic countries administered by European powers—were so expensive that
only one out of every ten people could ever attend even the lowest grades. The great problem now in the
newly freed nations of Asia is the “universalization of education.” Despite the tremendous respect Asiatics have for education, some of
the new independent nations have already made tremendous strides in meeting this problem, in spite of the fact that they
were torn by internal and external warfare. Dr. Adiseshiah cites Indo-China as an example. There, the national illiteracy rate has
already been lowered from 85 percent of the total population to 25 percent.

Representing a part of the world that is being dramatically reborn and an area about which Americans know very little,
Dr. Adiseshiah is a colorful and vital speaker who can tell the entire story of World Student Relief in Europe
as well as in Asia—with the authority of long experience.

Fellowship Organization Filling Definite Need of College Students

First Performance of ‘Our Town’ Will Be Presented Monday Night

Forensic Council Ready As Debating Season Nears

Last Thursday evening, November 13, the debate tryouts for this year were held. The subject for this year’s debating was
“Resolved, that there should (or should not be)…” Each debater could choose whichever side he preferred to support. From the
sixteen men that tried out, eight were chosen for the team and four alternates were selected. The men chosen for
the team are: Heywood Brin2gar, Don Coffey, Charles Davis, Herb Miller, J. W. Pence, Leighton McKeithan, John Lyles, and Flynn
Long. The alternates are: Don Shriver, J. Loftin, and two others.

Monday night in Chambers Auditorium at 8:30 p.m. the curtain will rise on the first production by the Red and
Black Masquers for the 1947-48 season. The play will be the Broadway and screen hit, “Our Town,” by Thornton Wilder.
The production will also be presented the following night, Tuesday, November 25, in Chambers Auditorium. The Masquers will, on December
7, present the play to the Central High School Auditorium. Admission charge at all presentations will be 25 cents for
children under 12 years of age, 75 cents for students and wives of the students, and $1.00 for adults.

The student body will doubtless be overjoyed to learn that a substantial profit was realized from the Homecoming Dance. The
council’s estimate of $1,500 profit was unbelievably accurate. This will give the council a comfortable margin upon which to plan
for a really first-class winter formal. The ticket sales amounted to $3,378.80, of which $675.75 was donated to the federal
government.These prices will govern all performances: debating schedule, This week-end, Brinegar and Shriver will take the affirmative and Davis will
support the negative representing Davidson College in the All Southern Debate Tournament that is being held in Atlanta, Georgia. In
this tournament, each team will debate five times against opponents picked by the administrators of the tournament. This will be
the first year for the Davidson Christian Fellowship. During the first year, the D.C.F. was given mainly to a vigorous
program of spiritual growth and knowledge of many problems that are vital to faith. The Topical Bible Studies have been
instigated with great success. The study is led by a student who gives a short presentation of the subject at
hand and then the entire group studies the things from a biblical viewpoint and discusses the chosen biblical passages which
are selected to illustrate the subject. Some of the topics which have been studied are "Prayer," "Obedience," "What Constitutes a
Christian Witness," and "Spiritual Wilderness."

The Davidson Christian Fellowship is a completely unorganized group whose sole purpose is that of personal spiritual growth through Christian
fellowship. The Davidson Christian Fellowship is unofficially affiliated with the Inter-Varsity Christian Fellowship International, which is one of the world's
largest and most active college Christian organizations and by far one of the oldest, being an outgrowth of the well-known
Oxford Movement of England. There is no membership in the Christian Fellowship; it is a student group. Concerning beliefs, there
is no written standard of beliefs; even though a conservative viewpoint is held in the discussions, all controversial viewpoints are
appreciated.

An entirely new kind of program has been installed by the Music Department of Davidson College this year. This program
is a combination of "hymn sing" and discussion group. These discussion groups or "Topical Bible Studies," as they are called,
have been carried on with great success during this semester. This is the beginning of five Sunday nights of special
programs sponsored by the Davidson Christian Fellowship. Each paper was discussed after its presentation. After the meeting, refreshments were provided
by Sam Tate, food chairman.

A breakdown of the dance expense is as follows: Dance halls, $75.75. The actual profit on the dance set amounted
to $1305.51. Other income to the society was $307.01, which leaves actual cash on hand of $1612.52.

The Christmas portion of The Messiah, Handel, will be presented both in Charlotte and in Davidson this year by the
Davidson College Department of Music. Soloists for the oratorio will be Mrs. Marjorie McClung Parker, soprano; Miss Beatrice Jones, contralto;
Mr. William A. Sutherland, tenor; and Mr. Earl F. Berge, baritone. The chorus will be composed of the Davidson Male
