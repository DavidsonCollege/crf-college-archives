The following is an excerpt from an article by Matthew Covington from the March 15, 1974 issue of the Davidsonian.
It tells of the life of an extraordinary man, Francis Wilson Price, the founder of the Davidsonian, who died in
January of the same year.

It has been 60 years now since that good ship, THE DAVIDSONIAN, amid gloomy predictions as to her final ruin,
and enthusiastic wishes for a safe and prosperous voyage, was first launched on the troubled seas of college life. It
has been 60 years too, since the Conklin self-filling fountain pen and Crash Suits. It has been 60 years since
the night of March 18, 1914 when the Davidson Student Body voted for the establishment of a weekly newspaper, to
be edited by the Junior class member Francis Wilson Price, our founding father who conceived of the idea, Frank Wilson
Price.

Price’s death on Jan. 12, at the age of 78 was not a shock. He had been ill for many
years with Parkinson’s disease. His death was instead somewhat of a tragedy.

This is not a story on his death, that story has been documented in many papers and in many countries.
It is, instead, a story of his life which touched many in this country and in China.

Price was born in the Kashing Chekian province, Mainland China in 1895. His parents were then missionaries. He came to
this country in 1911 to attend Davidson College.

He received a B.A. as a member of the class of 1915 and went on to receive his M.A. from
Columbia University. He also was awarded Bachelor of Divinity and Ph.D. degrees from Yale.

He returned to China as a missionary in 1923, to remain there until 1952. During the years 1947-1949, Price was
under house arrest in Shanghai.

His time in incarceration was spent translating the works of Sun Yat-Sen and Chiang Kai-Shek.

Price also translated a number of hymns of the Chinese Church of Christ into English. A number of these can
now be found in the “Presbyterian Hymnal.”

He visited the United States a number of times for special occasions and gave the Davidson Baccalaureate Address in 1944.
He returned to the U.S. in 1952 and became Moderator of the Presbyterian Church U.S. in 1953.

He served in this capacity for a year before returning to an active ministry in Virginia. Later, he became a
professor at Mary Baldwin College and remained there until his final retirement in 1966.

Price selected THE DAVIDSONIAN (as the newspaper’s name) feeling that it “is inclusive of everything at Davidson, every phase of
college activity, Davidson spirit and the community. It is the name, moreover, of every Davidson student and alumnus and as
their namesake should be supported by all.”
