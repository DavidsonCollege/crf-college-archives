**Marsicano: Housing assignments are tentative until start of fall semester**

After a controversy over the way in which next year’s senior apartment assignments have been made, RLO has switched the
occupants of two apartments on Martin Court. While the move placated one group of students who felt they had been
treated unfairly in the housing lottery, others are not entirely satisfied.

Kevin Epps ’03 led the protest against the apartment assignments after he discovered that his first-choice apartment, Flowe 302, had
been assigned to a group of students with numbers higher than his own. Epps and his roommates had been placed
in B 302, one of their last choices.

Dean of Residence Life Leslie Marsicano explained that the assignment had been made to provide a quieter atmosphere to the
residents of Flowe 201 and 202. Several of Epps’s roommates are members of Phi Delta Theta fraternity, and Phi Delt
parties often spill over into the senior apartments, Marsicano said. According to her, RLO regularly considers factors other than lottery
numbers when assigning applicants to Martin Court.

However, after meeting with Epps, Marsicano agreed that the policy for assigning apartments was not clear. “In recognition of the
fact that RLO publications on Martin Court lottery could be clearer and as a gesture of goodwill, I agreed to
switch the two groups.” According to Marsicano, the second group had in fact listed a B apartment as one of
their choices.

This does not, however, signal a switch in policy. Marsicano said that RLO will continue to assign apartments based on
lottery numbers and other factors, but will work to make sure students fully understand the entire process.

Such a switch is, according to RLO, not without precedent. “In accordance with the Residence Life policies outlined in the
Red Book, all assignments made during lottery are considered ‘temporary’ until the start of the fall semester and may be
changed,” said Marsicano.

Epps expressed satisfaction with the switch. “My only concern is that there are other students in the same situation. If
RLO is going to continue with the current policy, it needs to be made explicit for future classes.”

Sean Gantt ‘03, one of the seniors originally assigned to Flowe 302, was less than enthusiastic about the change in
apartment assignments. “It seems to me that they followed procedure and did what they have always done. I feel RLO
made an accurate decision in the beginning and was disheartened to see them give in.”

Gantt was also displeased with the way RLO handled the switch. “Neither RLO nor Kevin Epps and his apartment mates
brought this to our attention. I found out because a Davidsonian reporter called one of our roommates in doing research
for the article in the last Davidsonian.”

“The lesson here seems to be, if you’re important enough on campus and you whine about it enough, RLO will
appease you.”

Ian Willoughby ’03, one of the men assigned to Flowe 202, was ambivalent about the solution. Willoughby said he was
“disappointed that the situation arose. RLO should be confident in their original decision. But I also feel the process should
be made completely clear to everyone.”

Dear Student Body,

At last week’s meeting, the Senate continued the conversation on academic affairs, primarily concentrating on the first-year advising system. I
reported back to the SGA about a faculty meeting I attended and the views, concerns, and suggestions that they had
in order to see that whatever changes are made benefit all involved. We also had a presentation by Josh Craft
and Alex Massengale about Campaign Finance Reform. They are proposing that the SGA pass a resolution in support of CFR
in North Carolina. The Senate will vote on that resolution at this week’s meeting.

Most of the discussion revolved around a resolution offered last week that asks the school to force the incoming class
of 2006 to park in Baker. This issue has come up before, most recently last spring, and has been voted
down each time. The proponents of the resolution are arguing that safety is a primary factor—due to the recent car
break-ins in the satellite parking behind West dorm. One argument for the reason behind the larceny was the overabundance of
cars in this particular parking lot. Several senators voiced concerns about the resolution because they didn’t feel removing first-year students
will solve the problem of crime on campus—that it is only picking on a group of students who aren’t here
to defend themselves. We will be voting on this resolution this coming Thursday evening, which also includes a clause to
have cameras installed in several parking lots on campus.

The SGA is excited to be involved with the upcoming Ludacris concert. We are providing on-campus advertisements in the form
of flyers and giving away free copies of the single “Roll Out.” This CD, along with other prizes, will be
given away at SGA Day on April 24th outside the Union. Also at SGA Day, there will be a sign-up
table for the First Annual Davidson Bar Crawl, to include several bars and restaurants in the local area. Please feel
free to attend our weekly meeting at 9 pm Thursday night in the Sprinkle Room of the Union to help
with these and other events that the SGA is working on before summer break.

Sincerely,

Grady Patterson
SGA President
