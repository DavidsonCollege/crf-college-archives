**Apology**

To the Editor:

I am writing this letter to apologize to the Davidson student and faculty members for my actions in the 900 Room earlier this year. I am very sorry that I behaved in such an offensive manner. I meant to harm no one, and it will never happen again.

Sincerely,
Ernest C. Andrews Jr.

**Interpretation**

To the Editor:

Regarding the quotation of the Davidson College Trustee cited in Dean Terry’s letter to The Davidsonian of 14 January 1983 that “The Davidson student stinks and doesn’t deserve to be consulted in a presidential search,” we have several comments.

First, we suspect that the Trustee in question was, in fact, misquoted. Knowing that this institution’s Trustees have an unimpeachable reputation for loyalty to, support of, and belief in the quality of Davidson students, there remains no doubt in our minds that he actually said: “The Davidson student thinks and doesn’t deserve to be consulted in a presidential search.” The obvious implication of this statement is that the Trustees do not think and, ergo, are qualified to conduct such a search.

Second, if, however, the Trustee’s statement was not misquoted by Dean Terry, we are in a quandary as to whether to interpret his remark in a literal or a figurative sense. If his articulation were meant as an olfactory description, we must admit it is not without merit. Let us not be oblique; who among us has not skipped a shower on occasion?

But, in the highly unlikely circumstance that the Trustee’s ejaculation was intended in a figurative and derogatory sense, we would have to express our disappointment. The ineptitude and incapacity exhibited in this individual’s facility with the English language is appalling. The quality of the vituperation was at best prepubescent. In our humble, albeit knowledgeable, opinion, the Davidson student body deserves a more creative insult.

**Reply to Trustee**

To the Editor:

The trials of the Notre Dame basketball game have inspired widespread commentary, some of which has questioned the integrity of the Davidson student body. We, too, find much of the behavior by fans at basketball games obnoxious, but we question whether or not this behavior can be justifiably legislated. This, however, is not the focus of our letter, for we feel that the most pressing issue has been heretofore overlooked.

Will Terry’s letter to the Editor (January 14, Davidsonian) quoted an anonymous Davidson trustee, commenting on the behavior of students behind the Notre Dame bench, as saying, “The Davidson student stinks and doesn’t deserve to be consulted in a presidential search.” Surely Will printed the remark in hopes of showing students how their actions might influence public opinion concerning the College. Will wrote, “That’s a sweeping generalization [the trustee’s comment], but it delivers the message, I hope.”

To declare, on the basis of the actions of a few students at a basketball game, that “the Davidson student stinks,” is ridiculous enough, but to claim further that the Davidson student is incapable of constructively participating in the presidential search exhibits an irresponsible...Ignorance of the rules of logic and of the valuable resources present in the Davidson student body. It is extremely upsetting that this unfortunate statement was made by a trustee of the College—someone who holds a highly respected position in the Davidson community, and someone who has the power to take part in decisions vital to the fate of Davidson College. Maybe the trustee did not mean what he or she said. Perhaps the statement was taken out of context. The problem is that we cannot conceive of a context in which the statement would have any merit or be any less offensive. If we have misrepresented or misinterpreted the trustee’s statement in any way, we respectfully invite him or her to clarify the statement in question. It is our collective opinion that any person who can make a comment no more constructive than “the Davidson student stinks” should carefully consider whether or not he or she should continue to serve on the Board of Trustees.

Poor Judgment
To the Editor:
I was really surprised to read the letter in last week’s Davidsonian by Hal Elliott, Carl Elliott, Gray Hampton, and Ed Whitesides in which they mocked a person who died of a hunger strike (does it matter who?). Reading through the string of carefully contrived puns, I could only feel sick, sad, and angry that such brutal insensitivity to human suffering could be revealed here at Davidson—and published—for the sake of a joke and some “controversial political analysis.” It is hard to believe that anyone could have signed their name to that letter. I guess they think they are very clever. I think they should seriously ask themselves if they have learned anything at Davidson of any real value.
