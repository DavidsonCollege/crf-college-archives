The DAVIDSONIAN Vol. IV.

Foot Ball Practice Begins in Earnest
Many Are in Training for a Season of Hard Work.

Davidson faces this year perhaps the hardest and most comprehensive football schedule in her history. Beginning September 30th with the University of Virginia, the conquerors of Yale, the games scheduled are almost without exception with colleges and universities of larger enrollment and whose football teams rank as the leaders in Southern athletic circles. While it is by no means impossible for the Red and Black to make a success with such a schedule, it certainly means that this year must be marked by the most loyal and determined effort on the part of the football squad and also the interest and undivided backing and support of the whole student body.

If the registration of new students at Davidson, already greatly in excess of the corresponding period last year, augurs anything for the success of the session from an academic standpoint, this collegiate year will be the most successful in the history of the college, excepting none. The total registration up to Saturday afternoon, September 16th, was 387, as compared with a registration of 340 on September 15th last year. In other words, there are 47 more students in college now than there were at the corresponding time last year.

The registration by classes is as follows: Freshmen, 149; Sophomore, 109; Junior, 70; Senior, 50; Post-graduates, 5. From these figures is gleaned the fact that the number of upper-classmen returning this year is appreciably larger than in previous years, while the Freshman class is approximately the same in numbers as the new class of last session. This is accounted for in part by the fact that some new men, a part of whom were deficient in entrance requirements, were denied entrance because of a lack of dormitory space. For a number of years the enrollment has been in excess of 300, but never before has it endangered the 400 mark.

When the first call for practice was sent out by Coach Fetzer, an unusually large and somewhat promising squad reported. Nine of last year’s letter men were among those who answered the call, and a goodly number of last year’s most promising scrubs as well. The Freshman class material is considered by Coach Fetzer to be above the average. It is hoped they will become imbued with the Davidson spirit from the start and work hard, for not only will they be a great help to a winning team, but will develop into the backbone of the football team in seasons to come.

The squad, under the efficient tutelage of Coach Fetzer, has been rapidly getting into shape. A scrimmage has been held every day for the past week and as a result, improvement in all forms of play has been noticeable. The hot weather has proved a deterrent to much hard work so far, but it is hoped that this week will show a change in weather conditions and that real hard work can begin. The team and students are glad and fortunate in having “Bill” Fetzer again this year as coach. His never-failing interest and love for Davidson make him peculiarly desirable and acceptable for the position he holds here. The loss of Assistant Coach Kluttz will be keenly felt in all branches of athletics, especially in helping to develop new material. He was considered by Coach Fetzer to be one of the very best athletics coaches in the South. The good wishes of the entire student body go with him in his medical work at the University of Pennsylvania. It is regretted that his successor has not been chosen, but the old Varsity men, led by Captain White and ex-Captain Walker, are rendering efficient service in the training of the new men.

As to the probable line-up for the first game, Coach Fetzer states that it is entirely too early to make any predictions, and he is not willing at this time to make any statement or mention any names in connection with the different positions. This should be an added incentive for the new men to good work, for at Davidson the football team is not picked until the last possible moment, and every man is given repeated chances to show his ability.

The schedule for this year will be found at the bottom of column three.FRESH RECEPTION

On Monday night, September 11th, the annual reception for the Freshman class was held in the library, preceded by a rally of the student body in Shearer Hall. At the rally, several men, representing the various activities at Davidson, gave talks for the benefit of the new men, regarding their respective organizations, as follows: The high-water mark last session was S. R. Keesler, president of the student body.
