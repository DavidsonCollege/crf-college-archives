FEED THE DEFENSIVE LINE

By Bruce Balestier

Sophomore guard Pat Holloway and freshman forward George Spain each scored 18 points Saturday afternoon, leading the Red team to a 64-54 victory over the Black squad in Davidson’s annual Red-Black scrimmage. Junior center Detlef Musch scored 14 to pace the Black.

Holloway teamed primarily with sophomore Jason Zimmerman in the Red backcourt and scored with about equal regularity off penetration to the basket and long jumpers. The 6’8" Spain, from Columbia, S.C., did the majority of his damage in one-on-one battles with the 7’0" Musch, and shot a sparkling 8-11 from the field. With the departure of James Marsh to play professional ball in Germany, Spain’s contributions at the big forward spot could be integral to the success of this year’s team. Sophomore Scott Alford, who missed most of last season with a knee injury, shot the ball well (5-9) in contributing 13 points for the Red team, while sophomore Janko Narat had 9 and freshman walk-on candidate Linton Elliott 8 (including 2 three-pointers) for the Black.

The Wildcats’ first exhibition contest is November 9 at Cherry Point. Their first regular-season game is November 23 against Alabama at Belk Arena.

Volleyball Sacks Highlanders, Tied for First in Conference

By Bruce Balestier

With an impressive four-game defeat of Radford Tuesday night, the Davidson volleyball team moved its record to 18-10, and moved to within a game of a tie for the Big South regular-season championship. The ‘Cats will share the regular-season title with Radford if they can beat last-place Campbell at Belk Arena Tuesday night.

The secret against Radford was a speedy start. Davidson captured the first two games in convincing fashion, fell in game three when Radford showed up, and put together a solid, steady effort to win the fourth game.

Sophomore hitter Amy Howard was the first-game catalyst for the ‘Cats. The gunslinger from Amarillo, Texas gave Davidson an 8-2 lead with a service ace, and her two kills in three points gave the Wildcats a 13-5 cushion. Davidson won the game 15-5.

In game 2, co-captain Holt Hathaway departed from her traditional role as setter to score points for the ‘Cats with a block and a spike, as the team took a 6-1 lead. Kills by Howard gave the ‘Cats leads of 11-2, 12-2, and 13-2, and Davidson stormed to a 15-2 win over the bewildered Highlanders.

It looked like more of the same in the third game when the Wildcats took a 6-1 lead. This time, though, Radford recovered, scoring eight in succession for an 8-6 advantage, and recording the 15-10 win. Missed serves at 6-6, 9-9, and 10-11 severely hampered the Wildcat comeback.

An unselfish attack spurred Davidson to the decisive victory in game 4. Mimi Plauche, Katherine Anderson, Janet Delery, and Jennie Wagner all notched impressive kills in the 15-10 win.

Friday and Saturday’s action at the UNC-Greensboro Tournament brought an opportunity for revenge. The Wildcats avenged their only conference loss with a convincing 15-3, 15-5, 15-10 drubbing of Charleston Southern. Later that day, Davidson outlasted East Carolina, 9-15, 15-12, 15-8, 15-7. Saturday, the ‘Cats topped College of Charleston (14-16, 13-15, 15-13, 16-14, 15-8), but lost to Tennessee-Martin (5-15, 15-12, 14-16, 15-7, 11-15). The weekend’s action moved the Wildcats’ record to 21-11.
