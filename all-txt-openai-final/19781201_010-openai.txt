**Cats optimistic about new division**

GILLISON: know more after a few games.

For Coach Susan Roberts and the Davidson women’s basketball team, the coming season is one large question mark.

There are three returning lettermen, including last year’s leading scorer Sarah Womack and Senior Donna Ferren. But the other eight
members of the team are first-year players without much experience.

In addition, the girls are playing a new schedule, dropped down to Division III.

“Right now I wouldn't even hazard a guess at any kind of record,” says Roberts. “We'll know more after a
few games.”

SARAH WOMACK goes in for a layup during a recent practice. The team opens their season against Converse on Monday,
with their first home game the following Wednesday versus Catawba.

“We've got some pretty good outside shooters so we should be effective against zone defenses. Rebounding may be difficult for
us since we don’t have much height.

“It’s difficult to judge how we might do in wins and losses because of the difference in schedule. We play
ten schools we've never played before and know very little about them.”

Roberts is optimistic that by the midway point of the twenty-game schedule, the team should be playing to their potential.

The combination of a new coach and some old talent this season may help to re-establish a winning tradition for
the Davidson wrestling squad. Despite a 2-8 record last year, the team is optimistic about this season. Senior Captain Pat
Dulany contended that last year’s record was caused in part by the lack of a wrestler in the 118-pound division
and by several injuries. Finally, Dulany noted that the team lost its nationally recognized coach, Charlie Parker, to illness.

This year, the team has a new coach, Dr. L.R. King of the math department. King competed in wrestling at
Davidson as a college student. Captain Dulany said King’s enthusiastic attitude and leadership could be a decisive factor.

“The team has been practicing six days a week since mid-October, and we've pushed ourselves harder and worked more intensely
under Dr. King than we have in the past,” Dulany said.

Several wrestlers agreed with Dulany. Senior Scott Phillips, a standout in the 177-pound class, called attention to another factor in
the Davidson team’s optimism: the presence of several returning lettermen. The only wrestler lost to graduation was Glenn Ballard, last
year’s captain. The top four wrestlers, Dulany, Scott Phillips, Pat McKinsey, and Rob King, all return.

The team’s main strengths will be experience, according to Dulany. Six seniors are wrestling, mostly in the lower weight classes.

Several wrestlers expressed optimism largely based on the attitude, ability, and leadership of Pat Dulany. He is an inspiration to
the team.

Ironically, one of this year's greatest strengths, the leadership provided by the seniors, could become next year’s chief liability. King
expressed great concern about the continuity of the Davidson wrestling program.

“Davidson gives no wrestling scholarships while all the schools we wrestle against give at least one or two a year.
This means we have to actively recruit from the existing student body. The talent is out there, and we encourage
all those interested to come out.”

King is particularly concerned that the team does not have a 190-pounder and hopes that anyone interested will contact him.

This year’s most promising freshman is Scott Smith, who will be vying for a position at either the 134 or
the 142-pound weight class.

The probable line-up for the season is 118-pound Kevin Spangler; 126-pound Greg Sellers or Rich Reich; 134-pound Pat McKinsey; 142-pound
Pat Dulany; 150-pound Pete Johnson and Bill Allen; 158-pound Mike Garfinkel; 167-pound Eric Reintsema; 177-pound Scott Phillips; 190-pound open; Heavyweight
Rob King and Svend Pederson.

The schedule this winter includes nine dual meets and four tournaments, including the Southern Conference championships.

This Saturday, a number of questions will be answered as the Cats travel to Salisbury for their first competition—the Catawba
Invitational. Before the Christmas break, there will be two home matches, one against Catawba on December 7th, then the Davidson
Invitational against The Citadel, VMI, and Elon on December 9th. The Conference championships will be February 23rd and 24th in
Chattanooga, Tennessee.
