Men's Lacrosse Prepares to Enter NCCL

By Jim Livingston

The Davidson men’s club lacrosse team reached new heights last Sunday when co-captains Trey Rust and Jim Livingston and navigator Wells Campbell went to Baltimore to attend the meeting for the National Club Lacrosse League. The NCLL is composed of over 50 club teams from Pennsylvania to North Carolina. There are eight teams in North Carolina. With the addition of two new teams at the meeting, the North Carolina region was split into two divisions. Davidson is in the western division with Appalachian State, Elon, and UNC-Greensboro.

At the end of the season, the region winners will play in a championship tournament. There will be an all-star game following the championship game as well. The league will keep records of the leaders in saves, assists, and goals scored. The Davidson club players will finally have something to play for at the end of the season.

The team roster is dominated by freshmen and sophomores. Most of the experienced players come from Virginia and Maryland schools, but even the states of Florida and Texas are represented on the team. With the experience of those who have played before, and the enthusiasm of the new players, the team looks forward to a good season.

The team has eight games scheduled for the spring, plus a tournament in the middle of April at UNC-Wilmington. Five of the games are at home. The first home games are against Appalachian State on Saturday, Feb. 20 at 2:00 and against Duke on February 27 at 2:00.

Track Records Fall at Virginia Tech Meet

By Peter Hurtado

Several school records fell at the Virginia Tech Track Classic as the women’s track and field team geared up for the Southern Conference Championships next weekend.

Elizabeth Bishop continued her domination of the 3000m, as her quick 10:46 clocking ranks her as Davidson’s second fastest ever. Bishop placed sixth overall at the meet, and will surely challenge the elite of the conference.

Maria Whitehead eclipsed the school record in the long jump with a jump of 15' 10". Whitehead hopes to score in both the long and triple jumps next weekend.

Freshman Helisse Hoffman continued the assault on the record books, setting a new record in the 200m at 28.7.

Heather Tarpley once again showed her versatility with an outstanding 400m time of 64.9, placing sixth overall in the shot put (32' 6"), and leading the sprint medley team with an 800m split of 2:31.7.

Erika Gromelski finished just behind Tarpley in the shot put with a throw of 28'9".

Karen Marshall led the way in the mile with a solid time of 5:31. Marshall hopes to challenge the leaders in next week’s meet.

Marshall (2:33) and Carolyn Meadows (2:34) paced the 4x800m relay squad of Marshall, Laura Jordan, Marie Grisez, and Meadows. They will look to break the school record next weekend.

In the sprint medley, the squad of Hoffman, Whitehead, Sarah Orsbon, and Tarpley posted one of the best times ever. In the distance medley relay, the squad of Alicia Dandar, Julie Rannik, Phuong Nguyen, and Grisez ran fine splits to again post one of the best times ever.

Butcher

son. Although she is relatively untested at the college level, her presence is eagerly awaited. Butcher has emerged as the driving force behind a young Davidson women’s basketball team. As she and her teammates feel their way through the first season at the Division I level since 1986, Butcher is developing into a lethal force. She has led the team in rebounding the past 16 games and in scoring the past 11 games. Butcher is excited about the future at Davidson. “I was excited about coming into a new program and helping to start it and build it. In coming years I just hope we keep getting better.” With Butcher on the court, the future for Davidson women’s basketball seems bright.
