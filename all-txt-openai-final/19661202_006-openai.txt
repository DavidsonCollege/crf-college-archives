### Martin Reaps Reward Of Campaign Monday

Dr. Jim Martin, associate professor of chemistry, will officially take office Monday in his first term as a Mecklenburg County Commissioner. Martin was elected Nov. 3 with three other Republicans, giving Mecklenburg County its first Republican-controlled commission since Reconstruction. He termed the four to one majority somewhat “unexpected.”

The Republican victories in Mecklenburg County were attributed to several things by Martin. Except for the Davidson precinct and a few others, Martin felt that the Republicans had a more aggressive and efficient county-wide organization than the Democrats. He cited the fact that, in many predominantly Republican precincts, 80 percent of the voters turned out, compared with a much lower turnout in the 1964 presidential election. In the dominantly Democratic precincts, only 30 percent of the voters who voted in the 1964 election were turning out on election day. A good candidate for sheriff, former FBI agent Don Stahl, and the vote-getting ability of Rep. Charles Jonas also helped the Republican commissioners win election, according to Martin.

### Failure Of CSA Policy Attributed To Apathy

Membership in the newly-formed Committee for Student Action has been much smaller than anticipated, according to a committee spokesman. “The CSA was planned to be a liberal organization to capitalize latent liberal student opinion on campus," he said. “However, it was found that students generally have no opinion on the reasons for which it was formed." He added, however, that the CSA would have several programs, one of which would feature conscientious objectors as speakers.

The student organization, first conceived last spring, was organized in October, largely by sophomore Dan Mombtea. The group first applied for a charter then, but Student Council approval is still pending. Council President Chuck Matthews said, “They haven't come to the council yet with their constitution to get a charter.” He added that while he could not speak for the council, “I doubt that there will be any problem for them to get a charter.”

### Biographical Riddle Posed

By JOE JONES
Staff Writer

A “simple true story” concerning an “important man most of us know very little about” was told to the chapel audience Tuesday by Dr. Philip Secor, associate professor of political science. The hero of the story was born in a midwestern town approximately 100 years ago. The town, formerly a frontier outpost, had settled into rigidity and unwillingness to change. The hero came from an upper-class family which exerted considerable influence. He was a bright boy, and he seemed destined for a career as a lawyer as he entered the university. He had hoped to leave his sleepy hometown eventually.

At the university, he read a great deal of anarchist literature. “He read it on his own, not because it was assigned reading in some political science course.” The hero began to champion controversial causes, and at 17 he was expelled for socialist speeches and civil rights activities. The hero's older brother, involved in a conspiracy to overthrow the national government, was in the process of becoming a national martyr. His mother used her political influence to obtain an offer of escape from the death penalty if he would apologize and identify the other conspirators. He refused, saying...

### Show Cancellation Delays Hungry D

By ED EMBREE
Staff Writer

Davidson's Hungry D Supper Club, originally scheduled to run next week, has been rescheduled for the month of February. The changes in plans were caused by complications arising concerning a planned “theater in the round.” The necessary participants in the theater could not be located. This year’s club was to have been centered around the theater, and consequently, cancellation of the theater forced a postponement of the club itself. The exact dates for the rescheduled club have not been specified.

### Martin's Campaign and Republican Gains

Martin credited the enthusiasm of audiences at rallies and coffees in South and Southeastern Charlotte as a significant factor in his victory. This was traditional Republican territory in which Martin did predictably well. Substantial gains were made by Martin in the precincts outside of the city. In several of the precincts in the northern part of the county, Martin polled more votes than the other current or previous Republican candidates, although he did not carry some of these precincts. He attributed these gains to his North Mecklenburg residence.

Several Davidson students participated in Dr. Martin's campaign by distributing campaign posters. The Davidson Young Republican Club worked with the Charlotte YRC in organizing a big rally in Charlotte, which was one of six Republican rallies held during the campaign.

In his campaign, Martin found that most of the people with whom he talked were already loyal Republicans (though some were registered as Democrats). “I found myself talking mostly to people who were already planning to vote Republican while in many instances any less flexible Democrats were not present to talk with,” stated Martin. “Since this couldn't be regarded then as a representative sample,” he continued, “I couldn't really anticipate how well our whole slate would do.”

Martin cited two issues which figured in the commissioner's election. “Oddly enough,” stated Martin, one of the issues was that the Democrats had not raised taxes in two years. They had raised the budget $1.5 million over the expected revenue. “Fortunately, there was a surplus of $2 million to be consumed this year, but the Democrats showed poor fiscal policy in this action,” stated Martin.

A second issue which Martin initially raised and emphasized in his campaign was the arbitrary attitude of the Democrats toward the consolidated schools of Mecklenburg County. “While 77,000 students, or a quarter of our population, attend these schools, the Democratic commissioners failed to give adequate consideration to their financial needs. While giving lip service to the primary position of schools in the budget,” Martin asserted, “the Democrats actually put them last in consideration.”

Martin sees the education of the public for a school construction bond referendum for between $20 and $30 million as one of the first responsibilities of the new Republican Commission. Although he favors a “nickel-a-pack” tobacco tax to increase county revenue, Martin doubts that the legislature will authorize any additional revenues to local governments, which now rely mostly on property taxes. “This is not a decision which the commission can exercise,” he said.

### Union Expects ‘Dilly’ Of A Christmas Party

One of the highlights of Davidson's social scene promises to be the annual Christmas Party, Dec. 16 at 7:30 p.m. In discussing this annual event, College Union Director C. Shaw Smith says, “It’s going to be a dilly to start Christmas. I wouldn't dare reveal any secrets, but, like many members of the student body, I have faith in Peter Parrott and his pleasure pushers and think we can safely predict a real dilly. It will have to be better than any we've ever seen before; every corner of the Union will be jumping.”

The Catalinas will play for the combo party, from 7:30 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. Film Committee Chairman Andrew C. Clay will show “all-time great movies” in both the entertainment and drink fields. Parrott says, “We're looking for something better.”

Davidsonian Staff Alters Policy On Fraternity Photos

Ed Dwelle and Tom Thel, co-editors of Quips and Cranks, issued Wednesday a joint statement on the yearbook’s policy on fraternity pictures. There had been some confusion about whether the yearbook would have individual or group pictures for the fraternities. Dwelle and Thel clarified their position, stating, “We presented the idea of having a specific type of group picture to the IFC. This idea met with less than unanimous approval of the IFC representatives. We have therefore modified our idea but will still have group pictures.

“We have made a suggestion of clarification by way of example. We sincerely desire that each fraternity submit an idea for their group picture to be used instead of our suggestion. In lieu of the fraternities’ suggestions, the group pictures will be taken at the fraternity houses in whatever attire they desire. Today is the deadline for these plans to be submitted.”

The Unicon Board is really looking forward to putting it on and hopes the rest of the campus is looking forward to coming to it. It is well worth staying for and certainly worth having a date to enjoy it with.” Bill Beckman promises to have the tastiest and most delightful refreshments he can prepare. There will be “sensational, really fine door prizes,” according to Parrott. The winners will be drawn by the Homecoming Queen and must be present to win.

Former Davidsonian Spoofs Speaker Ban

A University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill senior, who transferred from Davidson College last year, has voiced his personal protest against North Carolina’s controversial “Speaker Ban” by recording a “ballad bombing the ban,” according to a story in the Daily Tar Heel. Bill Dale, a senior English major at UNC, first sang his “Speaker Ban Ballad” at UNC on Nov. 19. Speaking out against the state legislature prohibiting any Communist or person who has taken the Fifth Amendment from speaking at a state college, Dale plans to release his record in early December. “The Speaker Ban Ballad” is my only protest song,” Dale said, and “we are pushing it on the campuses throughout the state ... to stimulate the students to think about it.” Dale wrote the song last spring, but he has waited until now to release it because, he said, “I decided this would be the best time ... since the court case for the ban will be coming up in January.” Transferring from Davidson in January of 1966, Dale is now planning to go to graduate school after finishing at UNC.

“Let's unplug the computer, boys! Start thinking!”

A lot of people believe that someday computers will do all their thinking for them. Well, a funny thing is going to happen on the way to the future: You're going to have to think harder and longer than ever. Computers can't dream up things like Picturephone service, Telstar® satellite, and some of the other advances in communications we have made. Of course, we depended on computers to solve some of the problems connected with their development. But computers need absolutely clear and thorough instructions, which means a new and tougher discipline on the human intelligence. And it will take more than a computer to create a pocket phone the size of a matchbook, let’s say...or find a practical way to lock a door or turn off an oven by remote telephone control, or to make possible some of the other things we'll have someday. It takes individuals ... perhaps you could be one... launching new ideas, proposing innovations and dreaming dreams. And someday, we're going to have to find a way to dial locations in space. Makes you think.
