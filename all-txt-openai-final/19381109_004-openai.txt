Pi Gamma Mu Gives Banquet
Social Science Society Entertains Faculty Members And Students
Pi Gamma Mu honorary social science fraternity held a banquet Friday night in the Banquet Hall of Chambers. Over fifty newly founded members of the student body and several faculty members were present at the three-course turkey dinner. Dr. W. Lingle, Mrs. R. deV. Williamson, and Mrs. C. A. Ellwood, wife of Dr. Ellwood of Duke University, attended as guests of the fraternity. Archie Torrey, the newly established society president, presided over the meeting and introduced the speakers of the evening. Dr. Lingle, making the first after-dinner speech, said a few words on the difficulty in establishing the social sciences in a college. Following his talk, Professor R. deV. Williamson mentioned a few things he expected the fraternity to accomplish. He said he was not only looking to Pi Gamma Mu to forward the social science movement but to do a great deal toward breaking down the barriers between the different branches of the sciences and in creating a better understanding between the students and the professors. The main speaker of the evening, Dr. Charles A. Ellwood, was introduced by Gwynn. Dr. Ellwood is a graduate of Cornell and was awarded his Ph.D. degree.

Court Acts As Culprits Break Freshman Rules
Fourteen Freshmen were campused in Chapel, Wednesday, November 2, by the Judge of the Court of Control, Squires, for several weeks, according to their violation of the Freshman Regulations. Walter Lee Shelton was campused for two weeks for not attending a pep meeting. Bob Powell and Vosburgh were campused for four weeks each, and Bob Ballandy was campused and sentenced to “walk the post” for one week—all for breaking the Freshman campus rules by not wearing their caps. Wilson Coker, Stanley McAfee, Zack Cowan, Spencer Propst, Wilson Don Bell, and Dick Coppedge were campused for one week for failure to wear caps. The Court of Control is acting more like an advisory council than in years before. The court talks over with the Freshman his misdemeanor, with the purpose of helping him and of keeping him out of future trouble. Whether this has been the cause, or whether the Freshman campus had sobered them, the court has noticed a better spirit among the Freshmen in observing their regulations. The Court is represented by the upper classes and is conducted by Julian Squires as Judge, and by Louis Hipp as Recorder. The other two Senior members are M. P. Henderson and Paul Mc-.

Faculty Club Hears Speech
The journalism class will hold its regular meeting Thursday night. The Quadwranglers Club held its regular meeting in the Quadwranglers Room in Chambers Building. Dr. R. deV. Williamson addressed the club on the Internal Relation to the Foreign. He developed the background, historical and otherwise, of various governmental groups, their inter-relationship, and their relation to foreign politics. Following his address, the regular business meeting was held. Dr. David Rhea, Bob Rock, Lee Page Royster, and several others were present. The group gathered around for a jam session, song, and bull session enlivened by Col. Jake Houston, photographer of the Charlotte Observer, who was a special guest for the occasion.
