DAVIDSONIAN SPORTS MONDAY, MARCH 24, 1997

FAB-ULOUS

Phenom Jen O’Brien soars for a lay-up against WCU. Her solid play pushed the Wildcats to some key wins.

SC freshman of the year Landry Kosmalski (left), and the inspired stretch play of big-time scorer David Burns (right) were two reasons why the 18-10 men’s squad was better than anyone, except the team, expected.

Carolyn Kirsch finished up a magnificent career as Davidson’s all-time leader in points, rebounds, free throws made and attempted. But more important than her individual accomplishments, she and fellow seniors Monica Winter and Amy Scalcucci arrived with the program in a shambles, and left with the pieces of a perennial contender securely in place.

Despite Mark Donnely’s best efforts, the Wildcats couldn’t slow down the Sweet 16 bound Moccassins in the Southern Conference semis.

The men’s and women’s swim teams both raced their way to Southern States championships.
