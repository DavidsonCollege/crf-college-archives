Building, The Community Center, or the Elementary School. Davidson Emergency Rescue Service members would then use College athletic vans to drive the persons to the shelters. The vans will not transport citizens on Saturday. Civil Preparedness Director Robert Manning said the plan is necessary in case of an accident. “We are not proclaiming to have a perfect plan,” said Manning, “but to have any plan is better than no plan at all.”

Manning also mentioned that the plan can be used for other disasters such as toxic chemical spills from train and truck accidents. Davidson Mayor Nancy MacCormac said the plan will be evaluated by the state, the county, and the town. “We plan to have a meeting in January to discuss the test results,” said MacCormac. “We want community response and are willing to meet with local civic groups to discuss the plan.”

“Big business have certainly tried to get the administration to stop us, and it causes me to wonder whether it’s a deliberate attempt to hurt us with these hassles. After all, the president of the university, John Ryan, is on the board of Indiana Bell, one of the companies we’ve been fighting,” Howell says. For example, Howell complains, the yearbook will be allowed to stay on the registration checkoff system even though it regularly collects less than the required 10 percent support. Indiana Vice President Kenneth Gros Louis argues the school decided that certain items, like the yearbook, get waivers from the 10 percent requirement because “it’s an academic, not a political thing.” He also denies any complicity between the administration and private businesses to stop InPIRG.

Dave Jones says university administrators have become increasingly involved in the affairs of PIRG chapters since it does threaten many of their friends in the business community. “As we've become more effective, businesses have become more sophisticated in their attempts to stop us. They are certainly more opposed to us than they used to be,” Jones says. Jones adds that any recent financial difficulties among PIRG chapters can probably be mostly attributed to that kind of administration interference.

Cats were also unable to cope with the speed of State which accounted for seven uncontested layups in the first half alone. And even though playing superbly against Wofford, guards McConnell and Gullickson could not match the speed of the Wolfpack; in fact, the two combined for only four points and two assists compared to 22 points and 11 assists against Wofford. One question mark that remains after two games is whether or not DiBenedetto will be able to get involved in the Wildcat offense. Admittedly, Richie D.’s power moves inside were not needed against Wofford, but were sorely missed in the State game. If the Cats hope to be Southern Conference contenders, its guards must be more effective in finding the big man who finished with only seven points against the Wolfpack.

At Rice last year, university President Norman Hackerman threatened to take Tex-PIRG off student registration forms. At Michigan State, administrators actually did take the MSU PIRG chapter off the forms. University guidelines require that 20 percent of the students must support a group to keep it on the forms. In spring 1979, MSU administrators ruled that PIRG hadn't gotten enough support, and erased the check-off for the group. A subsequent audit discovered the university had miscounted student support. Moses Turner, student affairs director, allowed PIRG back on the registration forms this fall, but only if PIRG agreed to increase its payment to the university from $840 a term to $1000 a term. Yet on other campuses, it is clearly the students themselves who are deciding not to pay extra fees to support PIRGs. Jones, Howell, and other PIRG officials, however, refuse to attribute the declines in support to student apathy about the groups. Jones says the vision of the silent student body was a media concoction that does not reflect the truth.

Budget (Continued from page 1) players by the Admissions Office. The decrease of $15,330 from 1979 indicated a drop in total financial need among football players. “This printout does not reflect our contribution to other sports,” Carnegie said. Other contributions are not listed on the athletic budget because they are accounted for as regular College funds. Last year the Wildcat Club raised $188,000 in gift and program sale income and $20,000 in endowed funds, Carnegie said. The College allocated this money to various parts of the athletic program. “We’re doing a lot of things maybe we don’t take credit for,” Carnegie said. In the future, according to Carnegie, Wildcat Club funds will be budgeted to each of the sports “on a more formal basis.” He said Bingham has strongly urged this change in budgetary procedure. Bingham, who became athletic director this fall, said he is now using zero-based budgeting in compiling the proposed 1981-82 athletic budget. Instead of using last year’s budget as a starting point, he will completely re-evaluate every athletic program to determine its financial need. Zero-based budgeting does not endanger the College's commitment to specific sports, he added. Bingham’s tentative athletic budget will undergo review by the comptroller, the Administration, and finally the Board of Trustees at their February meeting.
