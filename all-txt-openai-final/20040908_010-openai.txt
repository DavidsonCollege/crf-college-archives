**Is big brother watching you?**

Considering Davidson’s relatively crime-free campus and strong honor code, few Davidson students would think that the police would need to photographically document weekend parties as if they were crime scenes and not the benign social gatherings that they almost always turn out to be. Yet the discovery by students that Campus Police were taking photographs at parties has associated the police with the use of unsettling big-brother tactics rather than the official providers of campus security and safety, as we thought was their job.

Director of Public Safety and Police Fountain Walker recently met with members of the Patterson Court Council in order to assuage their fears that the Campus Police were out to capture student violations on film. While Walker argues that such methods of documentation are required considering that college parties occasionally result in property damage and other student misconduct, it also seems to undermine a large part of Davidson’s Honor Code. How are we to claim we go to a school in which our word is our strongest bond when the Campus Police feel it necessary to document student parties on film? Shouldn’t students be given the decency of being talked to by Campus Police when there are problems rather than simply being photographed?

Furthermore, the purpose of the Campus Police should be to protect students, not to go out of their way to document minor infractions. For the most part, Davidson’s administration wisely adopted the unofficial philosophy that students are going to drink alcohol no matter what the rules are, and it is better to have them do so in a safe and open atmosphere on campus rather than risking students driving to other places. This philosophy is precisely why students are encouraged to contact Campus Police or paramedics in cases of potential alcohol poisoning without fear of being punished. Yet can this philosophy continue if students think the Campus Police might bring a camera along with an ambulance?

Rather than creating an open and safe atmosphere for students, this policy of taking photographs at parties has the potential of generating student-police conflict and, even worse, forcing students off-campus for parties and other social gatherings. At the very least, the Campus Police needs to more effectively communicate to students why they are taking photographs and what they will be used for before any pictures are taken. Otherwise, Campus Police risk doing more harm than good for the students they are meant to protect.

**Field space conundrum**

There is a crisis going on right now at Davidson: There are not enough fields for all the Wildcats on the varsity, club, or intramural teams. Over the past few years, this campus has seen remarkable improvements to the varsity fields: a state-of-the-art turf field for field hockey and lacrosse, a brand new soccer complex, and a future expansion of Richardson Stadium. However, practice fields have been erased in the process. The IMACs are now simply the IMAC, going from three practice fields to one, and the hill field beside Baker is now routinely used by varsity sports, in or out of season. Recently, the Ultimate Frisbee team had to practice between the science buildings. Other teams must practice at night, often with inadequate lighting. And we haven’t even spoken of those simply wanting to use field space for fun. Want to practice for flickerball? Try Chambers Lawn. Have plans to have a pick-up soccer game? Good luck finding space outside of Patterson Court.

All this to say: We need a plan of action. Club sports on down fall not under the Athletics department but under School Activities. The student body, through SGA, needs to develop and fund a solution to this problem. Here’s my suggestion:

1) An extra set of lights on the far side of the IMACs - this will open up field space.At night. 2) Alternative fields made available as close to campus as possible. This may mean (a) renting space over at Ada Jenkins or River Run, (b) leveling fields over at the lake campus or along Griffith St., or (c) making room here out beyond the IMACs or new Soccer Complex. Talk to your SGA representative TODAY about developing a solution to this ever-growing crisis.

Eugenics and silly science

Last week, Staff Columnist Nathan Bradshaw attacked abortion through a satirical model of eugenics. In the process, the column made countless errors in his depiction of science. He asserts that we “have the capacity now to determine the function and resultant trait of every individual gene in a human.” The human genome contains 30,000 genes and many—probably most—interact with multiple other genes. While science continues to progress, no scientist expects to see the human genome entirely understood in his or her lifetime.

He continually labels genes as “strong” or “weak.” Evolutionary science, however, does not condemn genes as weak. Humans do. Science provides no standard of measure by which to judge a genetic makeup as “qualitatively weaker than average.” There have been several attempts in the past to promote the genetic “fitness” of a population. The most infamous case stems from Nazi Germany. In every case, science was a scapegoat for governmental bodies looking to satisfy their own prejudices. Eugenics is a pseudoscience and should never be categorized as “scientific and reasoned analysis,” for whatever purposes.

The Young Democrats of Davidson were very helpful in the matter and made us aware that they and Dean Shandley condemned such encroachment on the College Republicans’ right to free speech on campus. Notice I did not say “anonymous Democrats.” That’s what happens when one does not let their mouth (or their pen) run away from them. As a conservative and as a person who signed his name on the Davidson Honor Code, I regret the incident that Spencer witnessed, but let’s be open-minded and not let the rash actions of one person lead to undue political mudslinging.

First Night Down off for KA

Due to a recent off-campus party which freshmen students were invited to, breaking the Patterson Court Regulation that states no freshmen are allowed at parties affiliated with a fraternity on or off campus before first night down, Kappa Alpha has suspended all rush activities for a period of two weeks ending on September 20, 2004. Since we have, in effect, gotten a “head start” on rush we have internally sanctioned ourselves for this two-week period so that other Patterson Court houses will not be penalized by our action. The house will be on a two-week social probation period which cancels all First Night Down activities that had been planned to occur at our house. The house will be locked during that weekend. There will also be no off-campus activities affiliated with KA. Brothers will not be contacting freshmen in regards to fraternity issues for the duration of this period. The brothers of Kappa Alpha apologize to all other Patterson Court organizations, as well as the rest of the community, for this mistake in judgment.

Spencer generalizes too much

Last week, Sam Spencer wrote an op-ed essentially lumping all Davidson Republicans into one basket for the misguided actions of a single person. In his editorial, Spencer writes of an anonymous male student throwing away the free John Kerry bumper stickers being handed out in Vail Commons. Without bothering to obtain the identity of the culprit, Spencer launches into a tirade equating that one man with all of us on this campus who support George W. Bush. It is unbecoming of a Davidson student for one to be so narrow-minded as to assume all Bush supporters or Republicans are violating the Honor Code because of this. Need I remind readers of the incident that occurred last spring in which anonymous people went around campus tearing down advertisements for College Republicans meetings? The Young Democrats of Davidson were very helpful in the matter and made us aware that they and Dean Shandley condemned such encroachment on the College Republicans’ right to free speech on campus. Notice I did not say “anonymous Democrats.” That’s what happens when one does not let their mouth (or their pen) run away from them. As a conservative and as a person who signed his name on the Davidson Honor Code, I regret the incident that Spencer witnessed, but let’s be open-minded and not let the rash actions of one person lead to undue political mudslinging.
