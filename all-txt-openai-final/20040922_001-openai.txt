Republicans attend Charlotte Bush rally
By ADAM MARTIN

The College Republicans volunteered for a rally attended by President George W. Bush in Charlotte last Friday. The president attended
a "W Stands For Women" rally downtown at the Merchandise Mart, where he spoke to a crowd of several thousand
North Carolinians. Following the rally, President Bush spoke at a fundraiser hosted by prominent Democrat C. D. Spangler, who held
a dinner in the president's honor to help raise money for the Republican National Committee and Republican Congressman Richard Burr's
senatorial campaign.

More than ten Davidson students volunteered the morning of the rally in various capacities. Some students aided handicapped attendees.

Endowment reaches record high
By BEN WHIGHAM
Senior Staff Writer

Davidson's endowment grew approximately 17.36 percent over the past fiscal year to hit a new high of approximately $333 million.
The gains end an uncharacteristic four-year slump during the bear market that began in mid-2000. Davidson's endowment, like many others,
suffered minor losses during the period. Davidson's endowment currently provides for 21 percent of the school's operating budget. 10 years
ago the endowment only contributed 11 percent.

The increase in the endowment's contribution to Davidson's operating budget has relieved the financial burden on students and their families.
While tuition fees amounted to 71 percent of the operating budget 10 years ago, they provide only 61 percent of
the current budget. "It's as if every student that goes here is getting a scholarship," said President Bobby Vagt. The
endowment has become an increasingly sizeable factor in Davidson's budget. "Without the endowment we'd be much more tuition dependent," said
Controller and Director of Business Services Ed Kania. "We are in a good position compared with other schools of our
size."

Despite the gains, Davidson's endowment remains smaller than many other top colleges around the country.

Zogby discusses U.S. policy in Middle East
By DAVID CROW
Editor-in-Chief

Last night, Dr. James Zogby, Founder and President of the Arab American Institute and former Batten Professor at Davidson College,
gave a lecture entitled "The Mess We're in: How America's Leaders Failed in the Middle East." Dr. Zogby's lecture focused
on the problems he has seen in the U.S. policy toward the Middle East and what he thinks the best
way to solve those problems are.

"Our leadership has failed us," he said. "Since Vietnam ended we have spent more money, sent more troops and invested
more political capital in the Middle East than anywhere else in the world, yet we find ourselves in a war
that we cannot win."

Zogby paid particular attention to how citizens in the Middle East feel towards Americans and why they feel that way.
"[Positive] attitudes towards Americans are between three percent and nine percent in all the Arab countries we polled," he said.

burden, we want to change that.” President Vagt described Davidson’s endowment as “one-half to one-third” the size of its peers’
endowments. “We want to grow by virtue of contributions and by virtue of management of the endowment,” said Vagt.

**Homecoming scheduled during Yom Kippur**
Incident calls into question college’s commitment to various religions

By ZACH Kazior

Homecoming celebrations, set for this Saturday, have been scheduled during Yom Kippur, the holiest holiday of the Jewish year. The
incident has many members of the Davidson community calling into question the college’s commitment to the various religious traditions represented
on campus.

“I am both personally and institutionally apologetic that this has occurred. It is hardly our intention to try to organize
an event at a time which is both inconvenient to, and insensitive of, the traditions of the broad Davidson family,”
said President Bobby Vagt, who accepted responsibility for the decision. “The fact is that the date was set by the
Alumni Relations office and material distributed to the entire alumni body prior to my knowing that it had been scheduled
to conflict with Yom Kippur. I offer this not as an excuse — the responsibility is mine — but as
an explanation of how it came to pass,” Vagt said. “The scheduling of fall events is fairly straightforward as to
the mechanics of setting the many special weekends, and this is where Homecoming happened to fall.”

Vagt said that, had he known about the conflict, he would have made a change. “If I had known about
it I would’ve changed it, and I should’ve known about it,” he said. “When you’re doing something right, convenience doesn’t
matter.”

**The scheduling conflict**

Yom Kippur means “Day of Atonement,” and is probably the most important holiday in the Jewish calendar. It is a
day set aside to reconcile for the sins of the past year. The holiday consists of a 24-hour fast that
begins before sunset on the evening before Yom Kippur and ends after nightfall on the day of Yom Kippur. All
participants are to refrain from any activity or work during the observance.

Director of Alumni Relations Matt Merrell, after consulting with Vice President of College Relations Kristin Hills Bradberry, and departments such
as the Admissions Office and the College Union, ultimately chose September 25 among others as the date for Homecoming celebrations.
“It is my principal goal to schedule this event around a home football game which becomes the unifying event for
the alumni over the weekend. As well, the Homecoming game usually becomes the best-attended game of the season and is
