Close-Up Epic

Asking yourself who Nid Koloc is; if you might know. In the decade she has a cult, and she reviews in Chicago has a couple of obscure labels, attempt on a Voice, which is sort of a Bagz and Judy composed could be classing, a style most comfortable. However, she does cuts, including entitled "The which may have as it sounds Boogie Woogie." If you're seeking an album, Music Reprise to believe yourself tastes in album for you.

Following, to purchase this album will of the album by a South- or; as almost slide guitar or mandolin work in it. Cooder puts in his usual anti-establishment stab with "The Bourgeois Blues," but the rest of the album is tame in that respect. Best cuts are "Smack Dab In the Middle," Cooder's rendition of "Stand By Me," and a taco-flavored song entitled "Yellow Roses."

Bob Dylan
Hard Rain
Columbia

This album is the soundtrack from Dylan's recent TV special, and it sounds as if it had been recorded off a television with a Radio Shack portable cassette player. Included on the album are such Dylan standards as "Lay Lady Lay," and "Stuck Inside of Mobile..." Most of the performances seem relatively uninspired, so if you don't have a Dylan album yet, don't make this the token Dylan in your collection, please.

Willie Nelson
The Troublemakers
Columbia

I must admit that my knowledge of Willie Nelson's music is very limited. However, Bo Baskin has informed me that Willie will be his running mate in '96 when Bo runs for the Presidency on the Lone Star ticket. The album itself is very good if you like music with a country flavor. Nelson displays a fine voice for this type of music. The songs are mostly religious in nature, but don't let this turn you off. Listen for some fine piano work by Bobbie Nelson, and nice slide guitar by James Clayton Day.

Stills-Young Band
Long May You Run
Reprise

This album has to be the major disappointment of the summer releases. Stills and Young seem to have just thrown this together to coincide with their recent tour. The album is a collection of songs written by both artists, yet they did not collaborate on one song, nor did they even sing together on any of the cuts. The music is stereotyped Stills and Young, and the lyrics are so inane they shouldn't even be bothered with listening to. The worst song is a Young composition entitled "Fountainbleu," which is about a hotel on Miami Beach. What a waste of vinyl.

Boston
Boston
Epic

This debut album by Boston is probably your best buy for recently released albums. While it is by definition heavy-rock, it does not blare out at you like such recent notables as Backstreet Crawler do. While the music generally is hard, Boston is adept.At throwing in some acoustic work in the middle of songs which fits in perfectly. The harmonics are excellent, and the artists make excellent use of all three guitar players. The strange sounds heard in the background on the album are not produced by a synthesizer, but by a "special effects guitar," whatever that may be. Rolling Stone portrays them as the next Led Zeppelin, but I would not go so far as to say that. However, I do hope they keep turning out albums like this one. By the way, don’t be turned off by the poor cover art.
