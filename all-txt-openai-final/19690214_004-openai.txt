**Summer School Curriculum**
By JOE SMITH, Staff Writer

Whit Morrow and Joe Kilpatrick are organizing a summer high school program for Davidson that would aid the intellectual and social development of talented students from underprivileged backgrounds. Morrow said that the idea for the program is a result of an internship at Yale Summer High School which he obtained last summer through the Richardson Fellows Program. He went on to point out that this program brought 150 students from all parts of the country to the Yale campus in an effort to stimulate an interest in learning and to aid their personal growth.

“Although we are basing our program on the one at Yale,” continued Morrow, “we plan to adapt it to the situation at Davidson, which will make it somewhat different. We haven't made any final plans about the program yet.”

Kilpatrick said that the rationale for the creation of such a program is based on several considerations. “We feel that, by developing the potential of ‘risk cases,’ we can do a great service to the people involved and to the state of North Carolina,” he said. “This program is a major way in which Davidson can meet its extra-campus responsibilities.”

“Facilities here which lie idle in the summer can be put to work for a good purpose. Another benefit of the program is that it will give a number of Davidson students the opportunity for rewarding summer work. In short, a great deal of good and very little harm can result from our program,” Kilpatrick said.

Having decided to start such a program, Morrow and Kilpatrick did some research into the operation of several programs, similar to the summer high school, which are held around the country. When their research was completed, the two juniors wrote a report outlining the objectives, general make-up, and cost of a summer high school program.

The report states that the summer high school's specific goals are to stimulate in students a genuine excitement about learning, to acquaint each student with his own strengths and weaknesses and help him find his place in society, and to develop each student’s awareness, creativity, and leadership ability.

The student body would consist of sixty males, rising juniors in North Carolina high schools who show a recognizable gap between achievement and potential. One-third of the group is to be from rural backgrounds, and 40 percent of the group is to be black.

The summer high school will begin in 1970, according to the report. It will last for seven weeks, and will involve intensive study in the area of intellectual history, English composition, math, and the creative arts. These courses will be taught by members of the Davidson faculty and by outstanding high school teachers from around the state. College and graduate students will be used as tutors, which will involve playing the double role of teacher and counselor to individual students and the coordination of the program.

**Paradoxical ‘Right You Are’ To Appear In Hodson Hall**

“Any force that will make people think, that will make them weigh values, that will cause them to recognize the rights of others, that will make them tolerant, is important.” Those words of Italian playwright Luigi Pirandello explain some of the thought underlying his creation of “Right You Are,” a comedy about truth, to be presented at Davidson Feb. 20-22, nightly at 8:15.

The play will be presented in Hodson Hall using a raked stage, first of its kind at Davidson, according to director Rupert T. Barber Jr., chairman of the Drama Department at Davidson. Costumes will be nearly monochromatic, using various shades of grey to symbolize that truth is neither black nor white, although strong touches of color have been added for variety and interest, Barber said.

When Pirandello wrote the play in 1917, he described it as “a parade in three acts,” but some people feel that “a paradox in three acts” would be a better description, Barber commented. “Although over half a century has passed since its first presentation, the play is still one that involves its audience and evokes a strong response when the curtain falls on the last act,” he added.

The cast includes Mrs. Constance Welsh, Mrs. Louise Martin, Mrs. Ellen Winkler, and Mrs. Mary Rose Davis, all veterans of Davidson College drama productions and residents of the town. Mrs. Kathy MacLean of Davidson and Mrs. Ellen Johnston of Mooresville will also play important roles.

Students in the play include Dick Poole, Joe Gardner, Tom Way, Cullum Rogers, Ken Fuller, Al McGraw, Jack Scott, John Lamar, and Jon Jacobs. The sets were designed by Joe Gardner, a senior, whose sets for “Billy Budd” won many compliments, Barber said. Costumes were designed by Mrs. Rupert T. Barber Jr. Tickets for the play may be purchased through the college drama department.

**Guidance Counsel Plans Still Unsure - Workman**
By STEVE CROSS, Asst. Managing Editor

“I can say what has been done, but I can't say what the prospects are for a clinical psychologist here at Davidson,” said Psychology Professor Dr. W. G. Workman. Several studies have been made of the counseling situation at Davidson. Dr. Ben Barger of the University of Florida made a study last year and recommended that the college employ a full-time clinical psychologist. Dr. Henry Weitz, director of counseling...Services of Duke University, was invited by the committee to assess the situation this year. No action has been taken on his recommendations. It has also been suggested that Davidson cooperate with nearby colleges to employ a professional psychologist, Workman said. Workman has handled this job for his 18 years’ tenure at Davidson. In 1951, he was given the job of helping students with emotional problems. Although he referred some of them to specialists off campus, the job became too big for him to handle in addition to his regular class load. During the first semester of 1964-1965, Workman was relieved of a fourth of his classes in order that he have time to spend in clinical work with students. In the second semester of the same year, he studied the counseling services of several colleges in various parts of the country. In 1966 the Board of Trustees authorized an expansion of the school’s clinical services. Last year a committee for guidance counseling was appointed. Dr. Workman was the chairman, serving with Jay Ostwalt, associate dean of the faculty, C. Shaw Smith of the College Union, and two student aides, Bob Lane, ‘68 and John Williams, '69. “I am sure that we will expand our mental health services on a regular schedule,” said Dr. Workman. “But it's not certain what form it will take."

The report goes on to point out that the program will measure its effectiveness through systematic testing at various phases of the student's development. Continuing contact with the student, through correspondence and personal contact with college representatives after the program is over, will provide an adequate follow-up for the program. Kilpatrick said that he and Morrow had contacted several foundations in connection with financing the program. He said that the response to their inquiries had been enthusiastic, but that no definite agreement had yet been reached. “Our next important step is to involve faculty members and students in the program,” said Kilpatrick. “If the foundations we have approached can be shown that the faculty and student body are behind us, it will make fund-raising much easier.” Morrow went on to point out that this involvement would be in both the planning and execution stages of the program. “I can’t emphasize too strongly the fact that no definite plans for the program have yet been made,” he said. “We feel that the only way to create a really effective curriculum is to get the participation of faculty members and students.” Kilpatrick said that, in the near future, copies of the report would be made available to faculty members. This move will be followed by a ‘Question and Answer’ session in the Morrison Room, open to everyone. He said that the summer high school program was the most feasible way in which Davidson could meet its extra-campus responsibilities. “The beauty of the program,” he pointed out, “is that it will allow us to meet our social obligations without sacrificing admission standards.”

One of the largest chapel audiences of the year heard White House Fellow Robert Haas speak Tuesday on student misunderstanding of influential government and business officials. Haas told the student that many young people have the idea that “biggies” make decisions only for themselves. “Biggies” was the term Haas gave to influential people being criticized by student activists. Haas said that many student activists think that “biggies” wield great power over many people. Student activists often think “biggies” to be irresponsible and selfish in using this supposed great power, he said. Haas explained that his work with “biggies” showed him that they were intelligent and well-qualified people. “People who criticize ‘biggies’ don’t understand them and why they make the decisions they do.” Haas graduated from The University of California at Berkeley as a Phi Beta Kappa in 1964. He was valedictorian of his class. He has also worked in the Peace Corps and holds a degree from Harvard Business School.

Expected student obstruction tactics failed to materialize after SGA President Peter Hobbie announced that the faculty executive committee voted to remove the penalty of dismissal to students cutting chapel six or more times. This penalty had been imposed on students after the walkout last week. A loud roar of approval went up from students at the assembly when Chaplain Scott Woodmansee announced that there would be no chapel yesterday and that the chapel next Tuesday would be voluntary.
