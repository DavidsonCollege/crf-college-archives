A man has lost the capacity to foresee and forestall. He will end by destroying the earth.
—Albert Schweitzer

Students will be posted at different locations around the campus and on Main Street, Wackman said, stopping cars, asking members of the Davidson community to park their cars and walk, and passing out some information.

“We're planning to hold a campus-wide symposium of several prominent speakers from the outside next October,” said Wackman. “Out of these two days we hope to establish a continuing organization of students and faculty interested in the ecological problem.”

The town of Davidson has a number of conservation clubs and organizations. We're planning to hold a campus-wide symposium of several prominent speakers from the outside next October. At that time we hope to have a big thing,” said Wackman. “We'll have films, slides, folk music, and poetry—plus general information of the extent and seriousness of the ecological problem. Out of these two days we hope to establish a continuing organization of students and faculty interested in the ecological problem.”

Coordinating the program are freshman John Wackman, senior Pat Mullen, and faculty advisers John W. Fuller, David C. Grant, and Cora Louise Nelson. Planned activities include setting up an information day on Monday, April 13, to agitate the town of Davidson about the current ecological situation. 

The third plan of action is to distribute information from room to room and through the town about the current ecological situation. 

For the automobile boycott, we will be asking people not to drive their cars on Saturday, April 25, to promote a community cleanup, and a general distribution of information.

DUKE FIRE

Faulty Wiring Starts Duke Fire; Firemen Put Out Blaze

The fire started sometime between 9:00 p.m. and 10:15 p.m. when David Felkel first entered the suite. Felkel informed Ben Garrett, another third-floor resident, and two students went out onto the veranda which overlooks the east end of the Cornelius Volunteer Fire Department. 

The fire started when a light for the evening study session short-circuited, causing a small hole through the wall. Felkel informed Ben Garrett, another third-floor resident, and two students went out onto the veranda which overlooks the east end of the Cornelius Volunteer Fire Department. 

Upon penetrating the room, firemen discovered two smoldering bunk mattresses on top of a dresser, the bunk beds in Room 18 and 20, where the fire originated, respectively. 

The firemen proceeded to hose them down and throw them out the window onto the veranda. Other losses were caused by smoke damage, the fire extinguisher material, and water used by the firemen.

Wackman said Sunday evening at 8:00 p.m. the East end of the Cornelius Volunteer Fire Department saw smoke coming out. 

Garrett and Harry Goldman, who had smelled smoke and come to investigate, tried to enter the suite through the window and neither one could remain inside for very long. 

Garrett did finally manage to close the door between the two rooms, hoping to contain the fire.

Two Davidson seniors, Ben Moore and Gary Henchen, have been selected to receive Watson Foundation Grants. 

The grants, in coordination with Brown University, are designed to aid the Fellows in attaining their interests, and concomitantly, develop a more informed sense of international concern.
