Baseball Suffers on Losses
By Will Cobb

The Davidson baseball team has found itself in a five-game losing streak following last week’s competition. This skid immediately followed a three-game sweep on the road versus Furman. Following this sweep, Davidson traveled to Rock Hill, SC to face former Big South rival Winthrop College. After 7 innings of play, the Eagles and the Cats found themselves in a tie game at 4, but in the top of the 8th, Winthrop took a pitch over the left field wall for the game-winner and a final score of 4-3. Freshman Brian Cole pitched the whole game, giving up 4 earned runs on 8 hits with 3 strikeouts and 1 walk. Brett Boretti kept up his hot hitting by going 3 for 4 with 2 RBIs.

The Cats would then face Wake Forest for the third time this season at home the following day. The Cats’ luck versus ACC squads this year did not improve, falling 14-5 to the Demon Deacons. The game sat at 1-1 going into the fifth inning, but the Deacon’s bats lit up and put the game out of the Cats' reach. Brian Krehmeyer (1-4) took the loss despite giving up only 3 earned runs on 5 hits in 4 1/3 innings. Senior Rick Bender took a big step toward the Davidson hitting record, going 3-4 with 2 home runs and 4 RBIs.

Davidson would meet yet another ACC team, Duke, in their next game. Against Duke, the Cats were hit hard, hanging relatively tough until the 7th inning when Duke got hot at the plate, piling up a grimacing 7 runs to extend their lead to 12-2. Davidson didn’t quit though, going on a home run tear with three 2-run home runs by Jeff Andrews, Clay Hall, and Jazz Freitas in the next two innings to pull within 12-8. But the rally stopped there as Duke tacked on one more insurance run, leaving the final at 13-8. Brian Cole took the loss at the mound.

The team would then shift back to Southern Conference action to face Georgia Southern at home, the #1 team in the conference. The Cats headed into the doubleheader having to face All-American Todd Greene, NCAA Division I’s 3rd all-time home run hitter, along with pre-season all-conference pitcher Jim Carragher. In game 1, Davidson took an early lead, going up 3-0. The Cats got started in the 2nd inning as Drew Fassett knocked a pitch to right field for a double, driving in Hall. The next batter, Jeff Andrews, drove in Mac Chapman. The Cats left men on 1st and 3rd, but left the inning with a 2-0 lead. In the third, Brett Boretti...

This lead was held until the 7th and final inning, holding a 3-2 lead with one out until things began to fall apart. Davidson would commit 2 costly errors, allowing the Eagles to tie the score at 3 and send the game into extra innings. Georgia Southern loaded the bases in the 10th with 1 out and was able to score the go-ahead and game-winning run. Davidson pitchers struck out Greene 3 times while giving up only a bunt and a single. Randy Spaw gave one of his best performances of the year on the mound, going 6 1/3 innings, giving up only 2 earned runs on 7 hits. The Cats dropped the second game 14-8. Georgia Southern took an early 8-3 lead and never let it go. Tim Kerns had two monster home runs, clearing the trees easily both times. Clay Hall had a home run as well along with a triple as he went 5 for 9 at the plate for the afternoon, but the effort wasn't enough. The losses leave Davidson with a 12-24 record on the season with a 7-9 conference record. Senior Rick Bender is now only 11 hits away from tying the school record for career hits.

Rugby Wins First Division I Game v. UNCC
The Davidson Wildcats earned their victory Tuesday night against UNC-Charlotte, celebrating the first time that the 'Cats have ever beaten the well-respected UNCC 49ers. This game concluded the 1992-93 season for the rugby club. The talent and efforts of the graduating seniors, Jamie Brown, Jim McCarney, Tim Dancy, Matt Dormer, Dave Harding, Tait Lane, Tom Hunter, Gavin Williams, and Scotch Turner will be greatly missed. Despite tougher competition, next season is promising.

Women’s Track
The women’s track team plans to improve on last year’s showing in the Southern Conference Meet on May 1 at ASU. Coach Beth Manson is pleased with the team’s ability to overcome injuries.
