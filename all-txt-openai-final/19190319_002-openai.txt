**Physical Education**

The past 18 months of warfare have been rich in national experience, and if we will stop to analyze that experience, many valuable deductions may be made. In turn, if we profit by our deductions, making practical application of wise remedies in future policy, we may turn a portion of the experience of war to the permanent benefit of the Nation.

Among the foremost of these experiences stands the fact that as a nation we were not physically efficient. We have gone on our way happy in the thought that we could meet the nations of the world at the Olympic games with a team of athletic specialists who have always managed to give a most excellent account of themselves. We have patronized with enthusiasm the gladiatorial combat. We have paid our money gladly to see a handful of men strive valiantly on the athletic field while we, comfortably seated, were not deriving any improved digestion or reduced waistline. To be sure, we have enjoyed ourselves, and that is the main thing that justifies this type of athletic competition. As a system of physical education, it does not justify itself. As a recreational agency, it is of value in so far as the objectionable features are kept out and the wholesome spirit of sportsmanship is cultivated.

The educational institutions of the Nation can well afford to give time and thought to more comprehensive systems of physical education. They should dignify the department of physical education, have very definite requirements, and give credit toward graduation for work satisfactorily accomplished. A number of institutions have done this already. This will act as an incentive to the student. The object of all education being to develop the latent possibilities of a man and to give him an appreciation of the higher values of life that will make him a far more valuable member of society, why not give him also a healthy, well-disciplined body? Surely if there is any one thing that makes life worth living, it is the ability to face the tasks of the day with the enthusiasm of good health and the general feeling of physical well-being. —The Cadet.

**Davidson’s Fallen Heroes to be Remembered**

At the special meeting of the student body on last Thursday morning, it was decided unanimously that a fund be raised by the students for a memorial to the 18 fallen heroes of the Davidson alumni and student body. This fund will be raised by subscriptions from the fellows, many of whom will soon be in possession of the $60 bonus from the War Department. This fact will help many make a subscription who otherwise could not do so.

Dr. McConnell presented the plan and made a short and very forceful talk, which put the men to thinking seriously about the matter. Some of the points which Dr. McConnell stressed were: That this memorial would not be in honor of Davidson, but it would be a tribute to those men who, because of their ideals, gave their lives for the cause of Justice. That in doing honor to these men of character, the students would honor themselves by giving something for a gift, even though small compared with their gift to us and to humanity.

Short talks in a similar vein were made by Mr. Jackson and Coach Fetzer, after which the suggested plan was put before the house and unanimously accepted. Although no definite form of memorial was decided upon, a committee was appointed by the president, Mr. Miller, to make some suggestions. The two memorials suggested, however, were a large gate at the entrance to the campus, and a swimming pool for the gym. The swimming pool seemed to meet with more approval as it would not...only be more useful to the Davidson students but it would complete the plans which were made for the gymnasium, which is an alumni building. The subscription sheets were distributed through the hall and turned over to Mr. Jackson, who was elected treasurer of the campaign.

LIFE.

Man comes into this world without his consent and leaves without his will. During his stay on earth his time is spent in one continuous round of misunderstandings. In his infancy he is an angel; in his boyhood he is a devil; in his manhood he is everything from a lizard up: in his duties he is a fool; if he raises a family he is a chump; if he raises a check he is a thief and the law raises — with him: if he is a poor man he is a poor manager and has no sense; if he is rich he is dishonest but it is considered smart: if he is in politics he is a grafter and a crook; if he is out of politics you can't please him, as he is an “undesirable citizen,” if he goes to church he is a hypocrite; if he stays away he is a sinner; if he donates to foreign missions he does it for show; if he does not he is stingy and a “tightwad.” When he first comes into this world everybody wants to kiss him—before he goes out they all want to kick him; when he is a little fellow the big girls all kiss him; when he is a big fellow the little girls all kiss him. If he dies young there was a great future before him; if he lives to a ripe old age he is in the way, only living to save funeral expenses. Life’s a funny proposition after all. As we grow older we learn that our worst troubles are those that never happen. Beware of the man who can’t stare you in the face and the woman who can.

ODDS AND ENDS.

It seems that the Rumpleites persisted in exercising the theorem that “a straight line is the shortest distance between two points” until more stringent means than “appeals” had to be used. We suppose now that they have been sufficiently “horsed.”

Mr. Harvey Branscombe, a Y. M. C. A. secretary from the Atlanta offices, was on the Hill last week from Thursday until Saturday morning. Mr. Branscombe is making a tour of all the Southern colleges and his main objective is to impress the importance of making the decision for life-work, while in college. During his short stay here he lectured at the “Y” Forum meeting, and held conferences with many of the fellows on this subject. Mr. Branscombe’s visit was a very successful one, for there are a great number of students on the campus who have no special work in which they are interested and towards which they are bending their efforts.

E. G. Lilly was in Winston over the week-end developing his social faculties. His frequent trips and ardent ravings indicate he is fast becoming a social lion.

“A-a-ha!” hisses the villain and the “Y” movies are on. Save for a few song books that rain continuously from the gallery the house is silent. Harold, the handsome hero, licks seven prototypes of Jess Willard, and the picture is pronounced a success. — Ex.

The man who most deserves help would die rather than accept it.
