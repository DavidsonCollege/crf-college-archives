Any student who has won an athletic award in the sport is involved and will know.

At Chattanooga, the four or five alumni forgot to stand at the playing of "O Davidson," and so did the other half of the audience. President Johnson almost slept through this, and so did the audience.

But from the first penalty in school, the fun began. On the number when Mr. Pfohl brought down his baton, not a sound came forth, not even a bassoon buzz or an immodest vocal "April Fool!" from the band.

Davidson defeated Hampden-Sydney of Virginia by a score of 15 1-2 to 2 1-2. Charlie Ross of Davidson was medalist with a 74 and Bill Clemmons was runner-up with a 77.

Baseball... it’s America’s outstanding gift to the world of sport. Senators, representatives, statesmen, judges, doctors, lawyers, businessmen, and Jimmy the office boy... they’re all out for the opening game. Thrills never to be forgotten... perhaps a home run... or an electrifying no-hit game... perhaps some callow recruit, unheard of in the big time, smashing his way into the hearts of the fans. Baseball brings pleasure to the millions who watch it, and rewards the stars who play it.

At every game and wherever you go, you will find people enjoying Chesterfields. Why? Because Chesterfields are outstanding for the pleasure they give... outstanding for mildness... outstanding for better taste. More and more smokers, men and women both, enjoy Chesterfield’s pleasing taste and aroma... such popularity must be deserved.
