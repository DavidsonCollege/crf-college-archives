**Knobloch Campus Center groundbreaking approaches**

**DAVIDSON COLLEGE CAMPUS CENTER**

By Patrick Baetjer  
Staff Writer

This Thursday, October 7th, the groundbreaking of the Knobloch Campus Center will take place next to Johnston Gymnasium. The event is scheduled for 5:30, with dinner to be served after the ceremony.

Dean of Students, Tom Shandley, says that the school is “trying to make [the event] as student-oriented as possible.” Dean Shandley encourages all students to come to the ceremony, including those who did not purchase a meal ticket. The celebration will be marked by performances by the Delilahs and the Generals, as well as a student-led prayer. The Student Government Association has several speeches planned concerning the new center, and the administration expects over 600 people.

**New Campus Center six years in the making**

FROM COLLEGE COMMUNICATIONS

Groundbreaking will take place at Johnston Gymnasium, part of which will form the Knobloch Campus Center’s new facade. This campus crossroads will house a 600-seat performance hall, amphitheater, fitness center, college bookstore, full-service post office, café, copy center, climbing wall, meeting rooms, and offices for many student organizations and the student life department.

The 122,000-square-foot, $32-million center was designed by the Pittsburgh architecture firm MacLachlan Cornelius & Filoni, which was selected for its experience in designing similar campus centers and performance spaces. B.D. Rodgers Builders, Inc. of Charlotte has been hired to build the Center, which is scheduled for completion in 2001.

Davidson's Knobloch Campus Center is the culmination of six years of planning by college administrators, students, and trustees. College trustee Gretchen Johnston of Charlotte and Tom Shandley, Davidson Vice President for Student Life, co-chaired the Campus Center Committee, a group of student leaders, faculty, staff, and trustees who continue to provide leadership to the project.
