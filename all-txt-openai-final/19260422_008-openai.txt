Seniors Install Stone Benches as Class Gift

Benches Are Made of Grey Stone and Are of Grecian Architecture

It has become a custom for each Senior Class to present a gift of some kind to the college at graduation. The class of '26 has kept up this precedent by presenting to the college eight handsome benches. As it is the desire of the college to improve and beautify the campus, the Senior class has done its bit in promoting this worthy movement. These benches are made of gray stone and are of Greek architecture. The numeral “1926" is carved on the center of each seat.

The seats arrived during the past week and have been placed in various positions on the campus, adding a great deal to its beauty and attractiveness. They will be officially presented to the college sometime during commencement. This gift is in accordance with those of previous classes, costing approximately eight hundred dollars. The class of '24 gave the college the gateway at the northwest corner of the campus, and last year’s Senior class presented as their gift a new fountain.

Freshman Class Elects Roddy and Kane to Two Lower Offices

The Freshman class last week completed their class elections for next year. John T. Roddey, of Rock Hill, S. C., was elected vice-president and Richard R. Kane, of Atlanta, Ga., was elected secretary and treasurer. Roddey, on the third ballot, won over W. E. Hill, of Richmond, Va., by only one vote. Roddey was also elected as a student councilman for next year. During the past year he has held the office of secretary and treasurer of the Freshman class. He is the leading tennis player in the Freshman class and will be the backbone of the team this spring. Roddey is a member of the Theta Pi fraternity.

Kane, who won on the third ballot over S. M. Smith of Charlotte, N. C., is one of the leading men of the Freshman class. He is one of the six members of his class that made the honor roll last semester and was recently elected to the Reporters’ Club for excellence in journalistic work. The president of the class, R. E. Kell, was recently elected president. Kell has attained many honors on the campus and has also done excellent work on the athletic field. Kane is a member of the Beta fraternity.

This completes the rising sophomore elections. John T. Roddey and J. R. Covington were chosen as student councilmen. Covington is the retiring president of the class.

Summary—Errors: Gilbert (2), Vick (2), Matthewson, J. Kugler (2), Glenn (2); two base hits: Vance, Dulin, Kugler; sacrifice hits: Alford, Laird, Huie; stolen bases: C. Shuford, Gilbert, Matthewson, Carson; double play: Wade to Austin; bases on balls: off Shelton 2, off Matthewson 2, off Wade 1, off Huie 2, off Laird 1; struck out: by Matthewson 2, by Wade 3, by Huie 3, by Laird 1; left on bases: State 11, Davidson 6; passed balls: Faulkner (2); winning pitcher: Huie; losing pitcher: Shelton; umpire: Branham; time of game: 2:15.

Davidson made it two straight over North Carolina State in as many days at Gastonia, to be staged on the Gastonia $50,000 field before a large crowd. Errors were costly to State, while Davidson's consistent hitting counted for tallies. The final score was 11 to 2. Jumping on Wade's offerings at the start, Davidson secured several hits and three errors in the first inning before Morrison got to the box to stop the fireworks. Morrison worked out four innings of snappy baseball, allowing the winners but four hits. Wade returned to the mound in the sixth to finish the game. Davidson played air-tight baseball behind Laird. Kelly Woodham led the Wildcat batting attack with a percentage of 500, his triple in the second inning going to the right field bank. Wade was the big gun for State, scoring both runs and getting a single and a double out of three trials. Davidson's nine hits fell in all parts of the lot, keeping the players on the run. Laird worked out a very easy game, never being in trouble.

Exciting Game Won by Winnegar Works

In the most exciting game witnessed on the Fresh field this season, The Winnegar Works Team, better known as the Third Floor East, defeated the Georgia Peaches by a score of 15 to 9. Wharton, pitching for the Peaches, was knocked from the box after the Winnegars had scored thirteen runs in the first inning. Coltrane, twirling spitballs and curves for the Winnegars, held his opponents to 5 hits and nine runs. Leggette, replacing Wharton, held the Winnegar Boys to 2 runs in 4 innings.

Ministerial Band Sends Other Deputations
Are Sent Out to Nearby Churches and Sunday Schools

On Sunday, April 18, T. I. Barr led a deputation to Prospect Church, which was very successful. The Davidson College quartet, composed of D. G. Wilson, W. O. Green, J. S. Foster, and D. M. Calhoun, accompanied him and furnished the music for the morning service at which Barr preached. “This is the third deputation which has gone to Prospect Church, and they all have reported appreciative audiences. John Ricks and Paul Thrower preached at Shearer Church Sunday, and C. A. Lyerly at Shiloh. Dr. Shewmake and C. D. Patterson were scheduled to go to Stony Point, but were unavoidably prevented from preaching. Thursday of this week, a deputation composed of Howard Arbuckle, Boyce Martin, Camper O'Neal, and N. I. Sappenfield, will speak at the Salisbury culmination of the “Come Clean Campaign” that the students of the school have been conducting. Sappenfield and O'Neal will speak on clean athletics, while Arbuckle and Martin will speak on clean scholarship. There is also a deputation going to Statesville this week, but the personnel of it has not yet been decided.

NEW NEILAN FILM HAS SPLENDID CAST
Two of the best-known comedians on the screen, three famous child actors, an unusually handsome leading man, the funniest farceurs on the speaking stage, a noted “heavy,” and an absolutely unknown girl play the leading roles in Marshall Neilan’s production of “Mike,” which is the next attraction at the Imperial Theatre, Charlotte. The comedians are Charlie Murray and Ford Sterling. The celebrated children are Frankie Darro, Junior Coghlan, and Muriel Francis Dana. The stage comedian, who came to Hollywood some time ago to take up a film career, is New Sparks. The villain is Sam De Grasse. The new girl, a recent “discovery” made by Neilan, who is noted for developing many newcomers, is Sally O'Neill. This exceptional company, under the direction of the expert young Irishman, undeniably makes an extraordinarily funny and dramatic picture. The story, which Neilan wrote himself, is the kind of material he does best. It was ascertained at previews of “Mike” that the picture has tremendous entertainment values.

Jim Pinkney, the new student body president, made an exceedingly impressive inaugural address. A copy of the speech follows:

“At the present time we are rapidly becoming what we are to be. Right now we, as individual members of this student body and Davidson as an institution, are fast changing and developing, and we are either going up or down. The motion, however, is not slow during our four years in college, but fast and all too apparent. We see today the releasing of the ties that bind the old officers and governing groups together and we, as practically inexperienced men, take their places. I feel personally that this is one of the most serious moments I have experienced up to this time in my life and I deeply feel the partial responsibility for the student government that has been placed in my hands. Moreover, may each man in the student body at this time accept as his personal charge the obligation that on each one and not on the few, rests the future of our honor system and our influence. You men who are Seniors can look back on four years of service and well have you performed your duties, but for the rest of us, regardless of our class, they are but beginning. So let us stand up to our obligations and maintain our characters as true Christian gentlemen, then let us strive toward the building up of a greater Davidson.”
