4 THE DAVIDSONIAN, August 25, 1916

FACULTY NOTES.

BLANKET FEE.

The following letter apropos the blanket fee was recently mailed to the old as well as to prospective new students:

Acting on the hearty and practically unanimous request of the entire student body, based on an action taken entirely on their own initiative, the Trustees recently passed a resolution establishing a Blanket Fee, payable as other college fees to the College Treasurer. This fee covers certain campus activities of the Student Body, and is intended to stop the repeated canvasses of the students in the interest of these activities. While the fee increases by a small sum the fixed charges, it reduces by a considerable amount the actual cost to the students. Especially is this true of the new students who, it is found, almost invariably subscribe to all these forms of campus activities. The Fee is made up as follows:

Ticket to all athletic games on hill $1.75
Y. M. C. A. $0.75
Student Body Fee $0.75
Davidsonian (weekly paper) $2.00
Magazine (quarterly magazine) $0.75
Quips and Cranks (Annual) $6.25

President Martin and family have spent all of the vacation at Montreat. Following a hard year of work last year, Dr. Martin has been taking a complete rest.

Dr. C. E. Harding has spent the summer at Davidson.

Dr. and Mrs. Grey have enjoyed the summer vacation at their home at Davidson.

Prof. J. L. Douglas spent a part of the summer at Chester, S. C., visiting relatives. The latter part of the summer he spent at Montreat.

Dr. H. B. Arbuckle has spent a full vacation on his farm at Louisburg, W. Va.

Professor Currie and family have been at Dublin, Va., where Professor Currie has been giving courses in History and International Relations during the summer session of William and Mary College.

Dr. M. E. Sentelle spent a short while with relatives at his old home in Greenville, Tenn. The rest of the summer he has spent at Davidson.

Dr. J. M. McConnell filled the chair of History at the University summer school, Charlottesville, Va., during the vacation period. He has already returned to Davidson ready for the opening of college.

Dr. T. W. Lingle has been teaching during the past summer at Cornell University, Ithaca, N. Y. Mrs. Lingle has been engaged in summer school work at Montreat, having charge of the department of Modern Languages.

Dr. Richards and family are spending their vacation, the month of August, at Montreat.

Dr. J. W. McConnell is now at Camp Glenn, holding the position of First Lieutenant in the Medical Corps of the First Regiment, North Carolina Infantry. There is a possibility that Dr. McConnell will not return to Davidson until a week or two after the opening on account of his duties at Camp Glenn.

Mr. F. S. Jackson, Business Manager and Treasurer, has spent most of the summer at Davidson, paying short visits to his old home in Gaston County. Besides his office duties, he has been directing improvements on the college buildings and grounds.

Prof. W. W. Wood has spent the summer at Charlottesville, Va., and at Louisburg, W. Va.

Dr. Fulton spent the earlier part of the summer at Davidson, while the latter part he and Mrs. Fulton are spending in Virginia.

Miss Cornelia Shaw is spending the month of August at Poplar Hill, Va.

Mr. W. McK. Fetzer, Athletic Instructor, has had charge of a large boys’ camp, numbering 120, at Camp Sapphire, N. C., during the past summer.

The results of this fee are believed to be in part:
1. Saving of money.
2. Freedom from the annoyance of canvassers.
3. Better financing and success of the students’ own activities.
4. Every student interested and participating in student activities with consequent increase in college spirit and in all-round development.

As this fee is solely in the interest of the students and at their request, the authorities hope that the parents will cheerfully agree and conform to the rule. The fee will be collected in September, and please remember that the net result will be the saving of money to the individual.

This is a Junior or Senior elective, and is intended for those students who expect to be interested in church work of whatever kind, no matter what vocation in life may be chosen. For the present, this course will not be open to candidates for the ministry who expect to take a full seminary course. Such students will get an enlarged course in the same subjects when they go to the seminary.

It is a well-known fact that laymen generally are becoming more and more interested in the church courts and church activities, but are greatly handicapped by ignorance in the fundamentals of Church Government, Church History, and Presbyterian Doctrine. After wide conference with many ministers and church officers, this course is introduced with the hope that a number of students will find it helpful. It will be grouped under the History and Philosophy group and will be taught by Dr. C. M. Richards.

NEW MEN WELCOMED (Continued from page 1)

...of a nature that will be of lasting benefit both to yourself and to those whom you serve, and will give a better insight into the teachings of Him to whom we owe all things and who has bidden us to serve even as He did while here on earth. An effort will be made to have something for every man to do who can give the time to it during the year, and each of you is urged to participate in the work.

With best wishes for a successful year of college work and again assuring you of our desire to help you wherever possible.

DAVIDSON Y. M. C. A.,
T. J. MITCHELL, President.

TO TEACH AT DAVIDSON.

It will be of interest to Davidson alumni, and more especially to the people of the town, to know that Prof. J. Edward Johnson, a member of the class of 1914, has been elected principal of the Davidson public schools for the coming session. Last year Johnson taught most acceptably in the Washington, N. C., schools, and enters upon his new duties at Davidson well qualified for the work. He will be ably assisted by Miss Roddey, of Rock Hill, S. C.Misses Mamie Withers, Julia Johnson, Essie Jetton, and Maude Vinson, of Davidson; Miss Jones, of Greenwood, S.C.

**LAST YEAR’S ANNUAL**

The following telegram from L. A. Mullen, Editor-in-chief of last year’s Annual, was received by The Davidsonian on Wednesday, August 23:

“Annuals soon. Definite information unobtainable. Inferior photography responsible. Printers refuse to hurry.”

L. A. MULLEN.

**THE ALUMNI GYMNASIUM**

I regret that because of conditions over which I have had no control, the new gymnasium has not been started. It will be begun this fall, however, and pushed through to completion as rapidly as possible. The delay has enabled us to mature our plans, and it is expected that a better building will result. The two items demanding our first consideration will be a splendid swimming pool and the main gymnasium floor large enough for our needs.

W. J. Martin.

**TWO RECENT ADDITIONS TO THE FACULTY**

The ones that may be bought second-hand will be noted.

To the old students: Have your courses been so grouped that you are sure of a diploma? Examine the catalog. New student? Read the catalog. Old student? Peruse the catalog.
