**‘White Out’ will help raise funds**

The content of basketball locker room conversations rarely appears in the pages of The Davidsonian. One conversation’s impact, however, continues to grow and affect the lives of more than just the Davidson student body.

According to Andrew Lovedale ’09, the Men’s Basketball Team came up with the original idea of sending their used basketball shoes overseas (still in very good condition) while talking in their locker room. After completing his first year at Davidson, Lovedale brought shoes and practice gear donated by his teammates to his hometown of Benin City, Nigeria. Together with the Men’s Basketball Team, Samaritan’s Feet (a non-profit organization that delivers Shoes of Hope worldwide) and alumni organized by Pete Ashcroft ’57, Lovedale hopes to collect thousands of shoes this weekend at the “White Out” game versus Butler University.

The days when Lovedale first received media coverage for his basketball prowess have long since passed. With the new initiative to send shoes where they are needed, Lovedale’s basketball career at Da-

As Davidson sets out to assess its Strategic Plan, trustees, board members, faculty and students have asked themselves “what will Davidson look like in ten years?” With this question in mind, the faculty-led Committee on Curriculum Development (CCD) will present a review of the current curriculum and a plan with recommended changes to the rest of the faculty in April. Based on this general plan, the CCD will establish specific strategies to achieve its goals.

“We are looking at where we are now and what we’d like to see in ten years,” Professor Swallow, Chair of the CCD said. This means working with the Principal Executive Staff who is responsible for the college’s Presidential Strategic Assessment to find what direction the college should take. Reviewing the curriculum is a main component of this plan.

CCD came up with four broadly defined objectives it would like to see Davidson students integrate into their course selection. These are globalization, diversity and inclusivity, sustainability and interdisciplinary study. “We have laid out these high-level objectives,” Swallow said, “and now we’re figuring out the strategies to achieve those.” While details of these strategies are not definite yet, and might not be for a few years, some of the ideas under discussion include increasing the number of international students, the variety of professors’ fields and backgrounds and the available study-abroad programs.

“So, we are hoping to have more of an interdisciplinary approach,” Michelle Jester ’09 fromLast year’s Curriculum Study Group said this might mean shifting the focus of core requirements from specific disciplines to specific skills. These “core skill” requirements could include moral reasoning, creative arts, quantitative analysis, and others. For the different skills, students could integrate more than one field of study, thereby approaching each problem from several perspectives and using different methods. “This would hopefully reduce the number of course requirements overall while still providing students with the value of a liberal arts education,” Jester said. The goal is to make this global, diverse, and interdisciplinary study “more institutionalized,” Swallow said. As of now, the best resource for students to integrate several fields in one major is to go through the Center for Interdisciplinary Studies (CIS). What the CCD has in mind is something similar to a CIS major but available as a regular major, or as Swallow stated, to set up for students “a more normal process to pursue an interdisciplinary major.”

Another idea to diversify the college is to attract more international students and professors. “We want to incentivize a greater diversity of people to apply to Davidson,” SGA President Davis Green ’09 said. The assumption is that a more international student body exposes all students to cultures unlike their own, thus globalizing everyone’s awareness. According to Professor Swallow, when the CCD met with all...

Professional teaching programs at Davidson

As many students already know, Davidson has a rich tradition in the training of future doctors and dentists, known around campus as “Pre-Med.” But Davidson also offers other pre-professional programs that do not get as much attention, such as Education, Engineering, Pre-Ministry, and Army Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC). Most students have no idea what comprises these programs.

Dr. Rick Gay, the chair of the education pre-professional programs, said that, “Students have the option to complete a licensure concentration with us in secondary education in the fields of English, mathematics, social studies, French, Spanish, Latin, or the sciences.” With the completion of their concentration, the Davidson student would be recommended to receive a professional teaching license issued by the state of North Carolina. “The goal of the education department,” Gay said, “is to help all Davidson students who want to go into teaching, whether they earn a concentration with us or not.” In the past ten years, 26 Davidson students have completed the Licensure Concentration; since the spring of ’02, 43 students have completed the interdisciplinary concentration.

Davidson’s engineering pre-professional program cooperates with a dual degree program alongside Columbia University in New York and Washington University in St. Louis. This program requires students to stay at Davidson for three years, and if they are accepted, they will attend the engineering school for two years. There have been students who choose to continue on at Davidson for their senior year as well, giving the student more flexibility in their classes. Davidson’s website states: “upon successful completion of the prescribed courses in the dual degree program, the student receives bachelor’s degrees from both Davidson and the engineering school.” This represents a great opportunity for any aspiring en...
