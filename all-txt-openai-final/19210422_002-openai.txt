State College Second Game.
In the second of a three-game series between Davidson and State College, the Wildcats lost to the tune of 7 to 4. However, it was not the superb pitching of George Murray that gave the Techs the victory, but rather their heavy hitting. Three of Davidson’s four runs were cleanly earned while only two of State's were due them. Johnson, State's third sacker, made a wild throw to second and gave up the fourth run. F. W. Smith, State’s premier hurler, surely needed all the help possible, for the Wildcats waded into his offerings for nine safe hits, three of which were doubles.

First Wake Forest Game.
Wildcats lose to Baptists.

Comparative scores between Trinity and Davidson show very little and the outcome cannot be forecasted with any certainty.

Wake Forest 4, Trinity 3.
N. C. U. 4, Trinity 2.
Wake Forest 8, Davidson 4.
N. C. U. 5, Davidson 9.

Dope it out yourself.

—Wildcats.

Wofford 6, Citadel 5.
Wofford 8, Davidson 11.

Looks pretty good but you never can tell.

—Wildcats.

Next Monday the team will leave on a trip into the Palmetto State. They will take on Furman, Clemson, Wofford, South Carolina, and Erskine, in the order named. Furman seems to have a strong team that we will go up against in South Carolina. Clemson has had a run of bad luck, not having won a game yet. It would be too bad for them to break their record on the Wildcats. Erskine and South Carolina played one game in which the score was 13-11 in Erskine’s favor.

How big does five dollars sound to you? If that doesn’t arouse any response, does ten dollars interest you more? Every man in college has a chance to increase his spending money by either five or ten round simoleons if he will take a little time and get up a good, distinctive, Davidson yell. The need of a yell that is easy to learn, and yet will give inspiration to the teams on the field has long been felt, and a contest to fill this need is about to be staged. If you need a little money to take a trip into town, or to pay off some old debts, or just to have a little extra cash on hand, here is your chance. Get busy and think up a good yell. The best one will be adopted and the author will be rewarded with ten dollars. The second-best will receive five dollars. All yells must be handed in by next Monday. Get busy and help your college and yourself.

EU SOCIETY.
The regular meeting of the Eu Society Saturday night was taken up with the election of officers for the next term. J. C. Bailey, of Rock Hill, S. C., was elected president of the society on the first ballot, and H. H. Smith was elected vice-president. In the election for secretary, which comes from the Peace section, Ernest Boulware was the choice, but owing to the fact that the gentleman will not be here next year his name was withdrawn and D. H. Smith was elected secretary. R. Bitzer and J. Sprunt ran a close race for the office of reviewer, Bitzer winning by one vote. J. C. McCaskill was chosen as valedictorian and Mac Richards as respondent. T. M. Lowry was elected treasurer, and H. H. Smith and E. E. Houghton were chosen as members of the debating council. Bitzer and Gamble, by virtue of having made the Intercollegiate Debate Team, are also to be members of the council. The president announced the results of the intercollegiate debate and the Fresh-Soph Declamation contest and adjournment followed.

CHARLOTTE, N. C. were J. F. Clark and L. P. Burney on the affirmative, and G. N. Morrow with J. I. Knight on the negative. The affirmative based its argument on the following points: First, that we should co-operate for political reasons; second, that we must do this to improve our business relations; and third, that we can trust these nations to do the best for all concerned. In opposition to these points the negative upheld their side of the question with the arguments that this move would be contrary to the Monroe Doctrine, that the United States can handle this matter better alone, and that previous experience has shown that these nations are not to be trusted in a matter of this kind. The decision was two to one for the negative. The critic announced the query for the extemporaneous debate: “Resolved, that the Faculty should have left exams before Christmas as they were.” The affirmative, upheld by McCain, argued that the old system had been beneficial to both the students and faculty. But McLeod in opposition to this proposal argued that the new system would be beneficial to the students, it would equalize the school year, and the rating of Davidson would be helped. The decision was two to one for the affirmative. At this point the president announced April 28th as the time for the election of officers for the coming year. Query closed the literary program with a very instructive oration on various superstitions prevalent today. Those who had never ridden in an imaginary aeroplane were given a ride for the amusement of the others as well as for the personal sensation. Various other games both new and old were entered into with great spirit. Refreshments were also enjoyed and the occasion was pronounced a great success.
