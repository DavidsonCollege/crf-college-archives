**News Summary**

**WDAV’s new building takes shape**

**Honor Code to apply in library**

Director of E. H. Little Library Leland Park recently announced that, as of September 20, 875 books are missing from
the library.

He predicts that by January, the number of books missing will drop to around 300 or 400, and over the
course of the next several years, the number will drop to around 200. These are books that were never checked
out, reference books, and bound periodicals.

Over the past ten years, over 2100 volumes have been lost at a cost of well over $50,000. (The average
book replacement cost is $25.) In addition, some books, such as bound periodicals, are very difficult, if not impossible, to
replace.

The members of the Review Board and the Honor Council, in agreement with Park and Dean of Students Will Terry,
decided that these losses are inexcusable and in fact are thefts. Therefore, the Honor Code will be in force in
the library. The removal of reference books, bound periodicals, or books that have not been checked out from the library
is an Honor Code violation and is subject to all stipulations of the Honor Code. Violations will be handled by
the Honor Council.

Questions about this should be directed to Terry or members of the Honor Council.

Members of the 1985-86 Honor Council are: Sara Beasley, Janet Bitter, Rob Bradford, Trip Caldwell, Tommy Cardwell, John Clark, Mary
Edwards, Holly Gaston, Wallis Goodman, Jody Hart, Michael Holt (secretary), Ed Lilly, Rob McLean, Dan Murrey, Shel Robinson, Sayres Rudy
(chairman), Holly Sparks, Eric Strother. The student solicitors are Phil Lackey, Pat Millen, and Jeff Willis. The defense advisors are
Jim Burson and Sean Goudie.

**New Omicron Delta members chosen**

The Davidson College circle of Omicron Delta Kappa, ODK, National Leadership Honor Society, has tapped 13 new members. They are
seniors Debbie Adams, Jim Burson, Wallis Goodman, Chris Klett, Lou Krempel, Andy Myers, Alice Nelson, and Katie Oates, and juniors
Leslie Hamilton, Chris Heineman, Sean Miller, Dan Murrey, and Mark Sandy.

After an intensive fund-raising drive and months of preparation, the staff members of WDAV are now looking forward to moving
into the station’s new home in early January.

The new building is located on the north edge of the campus along Ridge Road by the golf course. Construction
on the site began this June. Costs will have amounted to about $200,000 by the time it is completed this
December, WDAV station manager John Clark said.

“It’s obviously a long time overdue,” Clark said, “because it’s pretty clear that present facilities are inadequate.” WDAV currently occupies
a portion of the bottom floor of the Grey Student Union next to the bookstore. He noted that staff work
areas are decidedly cramped.

The building will provide much more space, with 3,000 square feet within its walls, and will offer a much better
acoustical situation as well. Clark pointed out that working in the Union presents many problems to someone trying to talk
on the air or make a recording. The water pipes near the studios make a hissing sound, traffic on the
upper floors of the Union can be very noisy, and there is inadequate soundproofing between the recording and broadcasting studios.

The new structure will include three studios and more soundproofing. Because of its more remote location, it will be isolated
from the normal sounds of campus life.

WDAV is a listener-supported station and has raised almost all of the money necessary to complete the project from outside
sources. The building will be named the McMillan building in honor of Dr. Thomas and Dorothy McMillan, who contributed the
first $100,000 towards its construction.

The move is just one part of a new capital improvements project at WDAV, Clark said. Also planned is a
signal improvement which will increase WDAV’s broadcasting power from 20,000 watts to 100,000 watts with a directed southern signal to
Mecklenburg County and Charlotte. The improvement is estimated to cost $100,000. Clark mentioned that the FCC would not allow the
station to increase its overall signal to 100,000 watts because to do so would interfere with the signal of stations
like WEPR in Greenville.

WDAV has raised more than 70 percent of the funds required for the new building and the transmitter but there
is still a lot of work to be done at WDAV in the next few months. Clark said, “We’re trying
to raise money for a major capital effort, and at the same time — and this is a big challenge
— raise $260,000 for the operating budget.”
