THE DAVIDSONIAN ELECTION 2008 NOVEMBER 5, 2008

As the nation turned out in record numbers to vote in the 2008 presidential election, so too did Davidson students.
The data below presents a snapshot of student participation in the election. All results come from The Davidsonian's online survey,
which was conducted between Oct. 15 and 22; 492 students responded. These results are compared with the results from yesterday’s
national election.

Though the results of the electoral college may suggest otherwise, last night’s race was actually close on a national scale.
As The Davidsonian went to press, Obama held a 52-47 lead in the popular vote. The vote at Davidson, however,
was slightly more skewed. Of decided voters, nearly 70% reported that they planned to vote for Obama. In 2004, 64%
of students went for John Kerry over Bush.

Non-seniors 66.0% 34.0%

This map shows how respondents hailing from each state planned to vote this year. It should be noted that several
states were represented by only a few—or zero—students. We cannot draw any conclusions about how Davidson students from these states
would vote.

The Other Races

Democrats also made significant gains on the legislative side—as we went to press, they appeared likely to pick up six
or seven seats in the Senate and 20-30 seats in the House. In North Carolina, Kay Hagan defeated Republican incumbent
Elizabeth Dole for a Senate seat, while Democrat Bev Perdue beat out Charlotte Mayor Pat McCrory in the gubernatorial race.
In Davidson’s 12th Congressional District, incumbent Mel Watt cruised to an easy victory. Nearby, Larry Kissel unseated Republican Robin Hayes
in the Eighth District. The Senate race in Georgia between Saxby Chambliss and Democratic challenger Jim Martin remained undecided.

Barack Obama cruised to victory in the electoral college, winning several states that had not voted for a Democrat in
some time. Virginia and Indiana, for instance, have voted for a Republican in every election since 1964.
