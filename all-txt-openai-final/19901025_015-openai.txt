SGA Referendum Notice

There is a referendum on Monday, October 29, from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. in Chambers and in the Union
about Freshman Advisor Elections and adding Hobart Park and WALT to ongoing Charters (so they don't have to submit a
charter every year). SGA has to do this by referendum of the student body because of the way it is
written.

Proposed Referendum

I agree that the Freshman Advisor(s) election should be removed from the SGA bylaws on the condition that the Dean
of Students Office handle Freshman Advisor selection in the following way:

1) The Freshman Advisor team must consist of one male Hall Counselor and one female Hall Counselor.

2) Submit an application by teams no later than 8 a.m. two Tuesdays prior to the Thanksgiving break. The application
would consist of their reasons for applying and their statement of goals.

3) A closed forum will be held at the Hall Counselor meeting prior to the Thanksgiving break where the candidates
will have the opportunity to discuss their goals before an audience consisting of current Hall Counselors, current Freshman Advisors, and
at least four representatives from both the Residence Life Office and the Dean of Students Office.

4) After all of the candidates have answered questions posed by the forum, a vote will be taken by confidential
ballot, and the votes will be counted by the Chancellor of the Student Government Association. The team receiving the majority
of the votes will assume the responsibilities of Freshman Advisors upon notification by the Chancellor.

5) The term of the Freshman Advisors will extend from the above vote until May of their senior year. Freshman
Advisors will be responsible for the Hall Counselor team which they selected throughout the entire year.

* All Hall Counselors are required to vote. Absentee ballots will be collected prior to the forum.

I feel that WALT Radio and Hobart Park should be added to the list of publications chartered through the Media
Board stated in Article IX: Chartering of Organizations of the SGA Bylaws to read as follows:

B. ONGOING CHARTERS
1. PUBLICATIONS (THE DAVIDSONIAN, QUIPS AND CRANKS, WILDCAT HANDBOOK, AND HOBART PARK) AND WALT RADIO ARE COLLECTIVELY CHARTERED THROUGH THE
MEDIA BOARD AND DO NOT NEED TO BE RECHARTERED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS.

MOVING UP HAS A WHOLE DIFFERENT MEANING FOR AIR FORCE ROTC CADETS.

Virtually all college students plan to move up in their career. But Air Force ROTC cadets can begin the training
toward a career that goes higher and faster. In fact, if you'd like to begin a life in the sky,
your best first step is Air Force ROTC.

You'll learn the confidence you'll need whether youâ€™re going to plot a course as a navigator or take the controls
as a pilot. FAA-approved flight lessons will launch you for the first time. And as your college career develops, so
do the skills you'll need as an Air Force officer.

Begin early in college, and you'll be eligible for scholarships that can pay expenses and provide you $100 each academic
month, tax-free. After graduation, you'll be ready to take the challenge of an intensive, rigorous training program.

Move up with Air Force ROTC now, and you can move up with the Air Force as an officer. Contact
