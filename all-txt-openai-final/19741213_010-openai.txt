Changed Town Dates to Revolution

The Civil War does not seem to have changed much. With the growth of Mooresville and industries relating to Lake
Norman’s creation in the Fifties, Mount Mourne’s size began to increase as these industries drew new families.

There are some who’ve been there far longer, though. Eva Belt has spent most of her eighty-odd years in Mount
Mourne and Plato Kelly's ancestry is intimately tied up with the spot since the Revolutionary War.

Her great-great-grandfather Houston fought Cornwallis at Cowan’s Ford and Torrance’s Tavern; her ancestors, both Reid and Houston, ran the community
for generations; and her father operated a sawmill—Mount Mourne’s sole industry—until his death in 1918. There isn’t a facet of
life that her family hasn’t touched.

Plato’s ancestors didn’t push much, either. Mount Mourne remains quiet, perhaps a little more so than when it was the
center of two plantations. A little imagination, though, and you can guess what it must have been like. For a
slow zone on Highway 115, it has quite a history.

The Reid residence is far larger than the Houston, and more elaborate. With its four floors, columns, and grand design,
it stands as a testament to the area's rich history.
