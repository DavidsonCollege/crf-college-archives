Foreign Policies By Rene DeV. Williamson

RUSSIAN FOREIGN POLICY

Recent events like the Nazi-Soviet treaty and the aggression against Finland have dramatically centered the attention of the world on
Russian foreign policy. Owing to linguistic difficulties, geographic distance, and an efficient censorship of long standing, matters pertaining to Russia
have aroused as much controversy (even as to facts) as those of the Soviet Union. But there was one thing
about which both the friends and the foes were in very general agreement, namely that Russia's every move could be
explained in terms of Marxist philosophy. It is now apparent that even this consensus of opinion was wrong. Probably from
the beginning, Fascism rather than Communism has been the real basis of Soviet policy. The Soviet policy has evolved from
Communism to Fascism, a change destined to be of enormous significance, notably that between the Comintern (the international Communist organization
commonly known as the Comintern) whose function it was to spread the Communist "gospel" all over the world and the
Soviet Government whose task it was to carry out the Russian Experiment. Until it was completely captured and its most
important leaders purged, the Comintern followed the principles and strategy prescribed by Karl Marx. The Soviet Government, on the other
hand, embarked on policies that were characteristically fascistic in that they aimed at the absolute power of one man as
their single (and final) objective.

The first period of Soviet diplomatic history was marked by a profound distrust for all foreign contacts. Chicherin, the first
Soviet Foreign Commissar, would have nothing to do with the capitalist world. Democracy was a capitalist plot, the League of
Nations was a "bourgeois" conspiracy, international law was not recognized as binding on the Soviet Union, and few countries even
had ambassadors in Moscow. Internally, Russia was developing a nationalistic spirit wholly at variance with orthodox Marxism.

The second period, which was typified by the incumbence of Litvinov, saw a more realistic approach to foreign relations. The
Soviet Union began to participate in international organizations and to seek alliances with capitalist countries. This period ended with the
signing of the Nazi-Soviet pact, which marked the beginning of the third period of Soviet foreign policy. This period is
characterized by a return to the earlier distrust of foreign contacts and a renewed emphasis on internal development.

Davidson students, who turned out in numbers, were thrilled on Monday night by the performance of the General Platoff Don
Cossack Choir, which is making its second tour of North America at this time. Nicholas Kostrukoff is director of this
organization.

Twenty-five exiled Czarist Russian officers, many veterans of the White Army, are members of the choir.

Davidson College Y. M. C. A. Will Sponsor Drive On Campus

Christmas Seals, sponsored by the National Tuberculosis Association for the fight against that disease, went on sale last Monday.

This year the students of the college will be afforded an opportunity to buy the seals and help fight the
dreadful disease. The campus sales will be directed by the Y. M. C. A.

The drive will last for several weeks. Mrs. Robbins urges all the students to help in the fight against the
disease. The seals sell for one cent each and are furnished by the National Tuberculosis Association. Of the amount sold
in each locality, eighty cents out of a dollar remains in the community for local use. The remaining twenty cents
is sent to national headquarters.

Davidson's Annual Y. M. C. A. Christmas Vespers Program is to be held Sunday evening, December 10, at 7:30 o'clock
in Chambers Auditorium, under the direction of Mrs. J. L. Robbins, chairman.

Soloists on the program are Mrs. J. M. McFadden, soprano, and Elizabeth Cloninger, playing the harp. Organizations to take part
are the Davidson High School Girl's Glee Club, Queens-Chicora College Choral Club, Davidson College Glee Club, Queens-Davidson Symphony Orchestra, and
members of Davidson Symphony Band.

This program is held every year under the auspices of the Davidson Y. M. C. A. and has proved to
be one of the most popular programs of the Davidson year. Hundreds of visitors from the outside come to hear
this program each year, the estimated attendance last year being about twelve hundred.

The Chambers Auditorium, as has been the custom in the past, will be decorated with pine boughs, lending a quiet
but radiant Christmas touch to the scene. This year the decorations are to be in charge of Sherrard Nice.

The second group contained the following program: “The Cherubic Song,” a religious hymn, Lomakin; “Ave Maria,” sung in Patti arranged
by Donizetti; “Blessed Be the Lord,” Tchaikovsky; “Those Evening Bells,” an elegy on words by Thomas Moore; “The Song of
the Volga Boatmen,” a Russian folk song; “The Legend of the Twelve Robbers,” a humorous Russian song; “The Song of
the Flea,” a jocular Russian song; “The Farewell Song,” a New Zealand folk song sung in English; “Platoff Song,” a
Cossack military song; “Dark Eyes,” a gypsy song; “Two Guitars,” a Russian gypsy song; “Sein,” a humorous wedding song. The
concluding number was the popular national dance of the Don Cossacks, entitled Kozatchok.

During the rendition of this, various members of the choir presented their individual acrobatic and comic versions of the national
dance.

Milk is bought by the money at the advice of the county health officials, who think that the money is
best spent in building up the resistance of those children who show a slight tendency to the disease.

Last year over fifty children were furnished milk by the proceeds made from the sale of these seals.

The Phi Beta Kappa banquet, held ordinarily at the fall initiation, was postponed to the spring initiation, so that both
groups might enjoy the function. The seven undergraduates were Robert Doty, Tom Guion, Thomas Hansberger, Jack Holland, Warren Ludlum, Bob
Ramsey, and Sam Spencer, all of the senior class.

The three alumni initiated were Marion Mitchell (A.B., 1917) of Charleston, S.C.; Rev. A. R. Craig (A.B., 1917) who is
preaching in Spruce Pine while on ex-leave from China during the war; and William Rainey (B.S., 1917).

The South Atlantic Modern Language Association is composed of teachers of modern languages in the states of North Carolina, Georgia,
Florida, and Alabama. Next year the association will meet in Chapel Hill as the guest of the University of North
Carolina.

Several other Davidson professors are members of this association. These are Professors Shewmake, Blythe, Lilly, Fleagle, and Cumming. Dr. Cumming
has made several valuable contributions to the quarterly bulletin of the association during the last year.

Professor Erwin, Davidson's representative, in the English section, is the chairman of the standing committee on Membership.

Three Davidson professors took part in the program of the twelfth annual meeting of the South Atlantic Modern Language Association
Dec. 1-2. Members of the faculty attending the convention at Birmingham Southern were: Prof. E. J. Erwin, Dr. G. V.
Watts, and Dr. G. K. Vowles.

Dr. Watts was a member of the nominating and executive committees.

Dr. Martin, president emeritus of Davidson College, has recently returned to Davidson, place of his birth and education, to live.

He has recently completed a new brick home on Lorimer Road and with Mrs. Martin moved here last week to
make Davidson their permanent residence. Dr. Martin was president of the college seventeen years. During this time Davidson went through
one of its greatest periods of expansion.

Retiring from office in 1929, Dr. Martin spent several years as president of the Assembly's Training School in Richmond, Va.
He has also done special work for the Committee of Christian Education of the Presbyterian Church in Louisville, Ky.

After moving from Richmond, he made his winter home in Greensboro and his summer home in Montreat.

Before Dr. Martin was president of Davidson College, he was for many years professor of chemistry here. Graduating from Davidson
in 1888, he did post-graduate work at Johns Hopkins University. He received both M.D. and Ph.D. degrees from the University
of Virginia. Both Wake Forest and Centre College have conferred on him the LL.D. degree.

During the first World War, the College of the City of New York was the first college in the nation
to convert its grounds into barracks.

Leaves In 1929

Dr. Martin was an elder in the local Presbyterian Church and was elected to the General Assembly of the Presbyterian
Church in the U.S.A.
