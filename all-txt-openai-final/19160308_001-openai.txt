The DAVIDSONIAN Vol. III. Queens College Glee Club Gives Concert Large Audience Enjoys Entertainment on Monday Night. The concert given by the Queens College Choral Club at Davidson on last Monday night was one of the most interesting attractions of the season. It was attended by an unusually large number of the students and townspeople. The whole program was carried out beautifully, and the occasion proved to be both enjoyable and entertaining. The announcement of the absence of Miss McRae, the solo pianist, was a disappointment to all those present who heard her last year. But it can be said, with equal certainty, that Miss Stokes, who took Miss McRae’s place, filled her part of the program splendidly. The solos by Misses Ruth Mason and Cora Clark were also rendered beautifully. Miss Smith, the violinist, added a great deal to the success of the occasion. The violin solo rendered by her was very much appreciated. Mrs. Coral Baker, head of the music department at Queens, is to be congratulated upon producing such an excellent program. The entertainment was probably the very best ever given at Davidson by the Queens College Choral Club. Immediately following the concert an informal reception was given in the Y. M. C. A. Social Center. The members of the visiting Glee Club and a number of the college students were present. Punch was served and a very enjoyable hour was spent.

TRIP FOR ORCHESTRA AND GLEE CLUB The members of the Orchestra and Glee Club have been practicing with redoubled efforts for the past week or two in anticipation of the trip they have in view this week. The manager has given out the following details of the trip: Leaving here on the first train Thursday morning, the organization makes its way to Lenoir, where the first concert is to be held. The following day, they visit Asheville, where they are to remain three days, giving one concert at the High School of that city and one at the Normal and Collegiate Institute. Remaining there over Sunday, they go on the following day to Marion. Tuesday morning they will be back on the “Hill,” after one of the best trips the Orchestra and Glee Club has ever undertaken. Those who will make the trip are: Baker, Bennett, Cashion, Childs, Coachman, Clark, Cranford, Fairly, Fowle, Harwood, Honeycutt, McKee, Morrison, Morton, Neal, Townsend, Witt, and Lott.

ANNUAL GOES TO PRESS The greater part of the material for the Annual went to the press Saturday, and the rest will go this week. Owing to the proximity of the publication, this week is the last chance for those who have not signed up for one to do so by seeing W. G. Morrison, the manager. There will be no extra Annuals ordered.

Prospects for Varsity Baseball Are Good DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N. C., MARCH 8, 1916. Miss Bargelt Pleases Large Audience Number of Old Men Returned and Readings and Drawings Comprise New Material Showing Up Well. With the first signs of the reappearance of spring weather, the local baseball followers heeded the insistent call of the horsehide, and for three weeks have been working out daily under the tutelage of Coaches Fetzer and Kluttz, aided by Captain Alford. On last Thursday the formal call was issued for candidates by Captain Alford, and as the athletic field has not yet recovered from the double drenching of rain and snow received last week, the squad has been holding daily light workouts on the campus. The prospects for a winning Davidson team are excellent. There is a wealth of last year's material, both Varsity and Scrub, back in uniform, and besides this, there is a number of promising new men and Freshmen eager for a chance at the coveted positions. Behind the bat, Captain Alford will do the bulk of the work. However, he must needs have an assistant, and for this post there are several aspirants. Faires and Burns, the former from Charlotte High, and the latter from Sumter, S. C., are battling for the second string berth, with scarcely a choice between the two as yet. Each seems to be very promising receivers, and as yet no prediction can be made as to which will be successful. At first base, Pete Saunders, last year's first corner man, will again in all probability hold down the pastime. However, there are a few disputers of this prediction, in the person of “Ostreelum” White, of football fame, and McAskill and “Pigiron” Sutton, of the Fresh class. As yet, none of these have developed quite enough smoke to dethrone Pete from his station. Second, third, and shortstop are positions for much conjecture. There have been numerous shifts and changes of combinations in an effort to place the right man in the right place, and it is not yet settled as to just how these three positions will be filled. Here, more than in any other position, the new men are appearing strong. “Att” Woods, Jack Black, and Pharr, of last year’s squad, are the old men striving for the positions. Of the new men, Johnson, “Monk” Younger, and Boswell seem to have the call for choice. Johnson seems at home in any of the three infield positions, Younger plays a creditable game at either second or short, and Boswell is showing up especially well at short, so that the vets are having a grand tussle to hold their jobs. There should be some lively scrapping for these positions, and there is no telling how the first game will find them placed. In the outfield Davidson is very fortunate in that four old men have returned and claim their positions. These are the last year’s outfield: Walker, Brown, and Keesler, with the addition of Dutch Hengeveld, the reformed pitcher, of last (Continued on page 4)

A well-pleased audience left Shearer Hall last Saturday night after listening to the readings and admiring the drawings by Miss Bargelt. This was one of the most interesting numbers given this year in the Lyceum course. Miss Bargelt began the entertainment by drawing a beautiful picture of a home on a hillside, with the golden sun sinking. Among the next was a moonlight scene which could be called “The Time, the Place, and the Girl.” That which may be considered the best part of the program was a reading, the time of whose setting was during the Civil War. It was of a Confederate spy who had come through the Union lines to bring food to his little daughter staying at home by herself. He was tracked and found by a detachment of Union soldiers. A price was upon his head, but the Federal Lieutenant Colonel was so moved by the bravery and love of the little girl and her father that he allowed him to escape. Miss Bargelt concluded the program by making a few more cartoons. One with a piccaninny watching a watermelon, entitled “Love at First Sight,” brought laughter and applause from those present. The last was a beautiful water and forest scene pictured just at sunset with the sun shining over the water and tinting it with sparkling jewels. One could almost see the small sailboat moving silently over the smooth waters. She closed with the fitting statement that “the sun as it sinks in the west has done all it could for the day,” and with the question, “can the same be said of ourselves?”

THE ORGANIZATION OF POLITY CLUB COMPLETED

At a meeting held last Friday afternoon, final steps were taken to perfect the organization of the local International Polity Club. This club, which has for its object the discussion of international problems, was only recently established at Davidson and in the course of a few days will become a member of the confederation of similar organizations in many of the leading colleges of the United States. Mr. Lewis S. Gannett, of Harvard, representing the Carnegie Foundation, addressed the club, stating in an interesting manner the history and aim of the polity club movement. He also told of ideas and plans which had proven successful in other colleges. At the conclusion of his talk, the club adopted a constitution submitted by a committee previously appointed, and elected the following officers: F. H. Smith, president; R. H. Ratchford, vice-president, and J. A. Thames, secretary and treasurer. The officers, with Professors Fulton and Currie as faculty councillors, compose the executive committee. The club intends to have a number of public lectures this spring by prominent speakers, and Dr. Hamilton, of the University of North Carolina, who speaks here March 11, is to give the first of these series. He is coming under the auspices of both the club and faculty.

Past Season In Basket Ball a Successful One

First Year of Intercollegiate Games Develops Fast Team.

The following men have been recommended for the basketball “D” by the coach and captain and passed by the “Wearers of the D.” Before the awards can be made they must be passed by the Executive Committee of the Athletic Association: Reese Walker, R. Wood, A. C. Hengeveld, King, Geo. Younger. When last fall the Varsity basketball team was called out for practice, it was not very seriously thought of on the campus, for past seasons had not developed anything very startling along basketball lines in Davidson circles. However, this slighting attitude towards the team was soon dispelled when the students awoke to find they had a real team on the floor, one able to hold its own with anything in the State, and one that would be a credit to Davidson. The change from indifference to startling success with its basketball team, Davidson can attribute to the fact that she had a coach, a factor which was sadly lacking last year, and that she had a bunch of scrapping, fighting, rip-roaring basketeers, determined to put out a team. The season just closed has been a success from all viewpoints. Out of twenty games played, eleven have been won and nine lost, a percentage of .550 for the season. This is above the average, and a record to be proud of. Captain Reese, at guard, has been the mainstay and particular star of the team all season. His swift footwork, enabling him to range all over the floor, and yet be able to hold his forward, has made him an especially valuable scorer. It was a common thing for him to score more than half the Davidson points, on foul goals and field goals. He is an unerring foul shot, and rarely fell down on this branch. He is one of the best field goal shooters Davidson has. Altogether, he has proved himself well worthy of captaining such a team. His work the season through has been the backbone of the Davidson offense and defense. At forwards, three men, King, Childs, and Wood, divided the honors. There was little to pick between these three men. King is a forward of the accurate shooting type, as is Wood. Childs is a whirlwind player on working the ball down-court, and on dribbling. He is very hard to guard, and manages to break away for more clean shots than any man on the team, perhaps. King was the scoring star of the season, however, with his overhead, backhand, and other freak shots, which seemed to have an uncanny facility for entering the goal. Wood took Childs’ place in the regular line-up, after having split it with him for a part of the season, when Eddie was called home just prior to the last road trip, and proved himself an excellent shot, and a very hard man to guard. At center “Dutch” Hengeveld played in a class by himself. Being a big man, one would not think he would be excep-
