#### Students pleased with Bank of America Conference
**By Amanda Stephens, Senior Staff Writer**

As political, economic, and international affairs experts fly in from all over the country to speak at Davidson for the Bank of America Conference, increasing numbers of Davidson students have seized the opportunity to listen to debates and lectures.

“Student turnout has been one problem that plagued past conferences, but I’m pleased that every one of our events (so far) has had a majority of students in the audience,” said Andrea Lytle, the Dean Rusk Fellow. In fact, according to Lytle, many students have even expressed regret at not being able to attend more lectures due to scheduling conflicts.

“Several students have told me that they want to come to more of these events, but with the usual crunch of work and extracurriculars, they just can’t come to as many speakers as they would like,” said Lytle.

Increasing interest in the speaker series may be attributed to the wide variety of topics debated in this year’s conference. According to Lytle, broader discussion themes may have attracted more students.

“One thing about this year’s conference topic that has been both a blessing and a curse is that it is so incredibly broad. The issues and implications of ‘prosperity, security and sovereignty’ are so complicated that it’s really hard to get your head around the issues sometimes,” Lytle said. “On the other hand, the fact that the topics have been so different has meant that we’ve drawn in a variety of students with very different interests. A handful of students have been to most (or all) of these events, but at each panel or keynote speaker, I see more students I haven’t seen before or whom I know don’t often make it to one of our events,” Lytle said.

Overall, most students seem to be pleased with the quality of the lectures. Ashish George ’07 said, “All of the speakers have done a good job of buttressing what they have said with facts rather than merely making claims that could elicit skepticism.”

Other students have expressed satisfaction at hearing their own political opinions echoed by the different speakers. “I thought the sovereignty lecture was great, but then again, what Krasner basically advocated was close to American soft imperialism. In short, Krasner is a realist, and he definitely represents my political affiliation,” said Seany Patrick ’06.

In addition to student enthusiasm, the Dean Rusk Program attributes the success of the conference to months of hard work and to the efforts of the Student Advisory Committee (SAC), which has worked in conjunction with the Dean Rusk Program to make the conference possible.

“They have spoken in classes, put up a million flyers, held programming events to increase awareness and interest, driven speakers to the airport... the list goes on and on,” said Lytle.

In the words of Leslie Thompson ’04, “This conference has been a great opportunity for Davidson students, especially those of us who have had the chance to spend time with all of the prolific speakers. I am disappointed that more students haven’t been turning out for all of the events, but I think that some of the guests, like Zakaria, have ‘rock-star’ status and naturally attract more attention than others. I certainly hope that Dean Rusk continues to host the conference every two years,” Thompson said.

H.S. Juniors flock to campus in biggest Junior Day yet
By B Levin SHELNUTT Senior Staff Writer

This past Saturday, Davidson’s Admissions Office hosted Junior Day 2, a program designed to introduce high school juniors to Davidson as well as to the general college search process. Students from 28 states attended Junior Day for a total of 566 registered juniors. The number marked a significant increase from the 400 students who registered for the first Junior Day in February.

The agenda for the day included faculty panels, admission and financial aid sessions, greetings from President Bobby Vagt, and a lecture from Dean Nancy Cable entitled “The College Search: An Insider’s Guide.” More than 50 Davidson students volunteered to lead events throughout the day. Guides led approximately 35 tours of varying sizes in the morning, and panelists answered questions and led discussions with prospective students in the afternoon.

Admission Counselor Khoury Ashooh emphasized the importance of student participation in helping make Junior Day a successful event. “We rely on student participation to lead tours, and many times the number of tours given, as well as their size, is impacted directly by the number of student volunteers,” Ashooh said. “Some students give tours only, some do panels only, some do both, some sit on parent panels, and others — Senior Admission Fellows — help out in different ways,” Ashooh continued.

The Admissions Office also sponsors Decision Davidson for admitted students in April, along with two Discover Davidson programs for high school seniors in the fall.

Trespassing, from page 3

Although they will be more alert, many students say that they do not intend to change their habits drastically. Darcie Draudt ’07 believes that although trespassing is an everyday occurrence in the outside world, it can seem to be a big deal at a small college such as Davidson. “Break-ins and peeping toms are typical occurrences, but when it happens to a small town college with a living Honor Code, it becomes a really big deal...I will still leave my bookbag in the library when I go to the Union or whatever, but I think that, like most college campuses, having outsiders on campus is a normal thing,” she said.

Geoff King ’06, like Draudt, is not that worried about the prospect of unlawful entry, but he said he will be more wary. King also finds it interesting that these violations have highlighted the fact that the Honor Code does not necessarily apply to outsiders. “These incidents have the possibility of undermining the benefits and false security of the Honor Code, as some people might begin to lock their doors, be more wary and worried about the security of their belongings if left somewhere...however, I do think it is an interesting situation where the college community meets the less forgiving outside world,” King said.

Although the students may not be particularly worried about the threat of crime, they still hope that the campus law enforcement will do what it can to prevent these events from occurring. “It would be nice to know that campus police is continuing to be hesitant of anyone who looks like they’re not affiliated with Davidson,” said Draudt. Walker and the Campus Police intend to continue watching out for trespassers. “The safety of innocents is paramount,” he said.
