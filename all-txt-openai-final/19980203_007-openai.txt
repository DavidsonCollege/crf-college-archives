Attention All Students!!

Between now and February 6th, the Residence Life Office would like all students to check to make sure that their
class status is correct. Lottery numbers are based upon class status and not upon class year, thus it is imperative
for students to check the class rosters that will be posted outside the Registrar’s Office, by the Union Desk, in
the Library, or in the Residence Life Office, for any errors that may be present. It should be noted that
some students may have enough credits to warrant a different class status.

EXAMPLE:
Name Class Status Class Year
Smith, John SOPH 00

ALL CORRECTIONS SHOULD BE MADE PRIOR TO FEBRUARY 6th
