**Cutting Strings**

Freshmen were treated to a perceptive analysis by Student Body President Tom Earnhardt of some of the more misguided interpretations of student power during their orientation last week. Earnhardt attempted to present to the freshmen some of the dangerous tendencies he saw at the convention of the National Student Association this summer. Some of the actions taken by NSA seemed to be born out of a sense of super-shame caused by the discovery that the association had been accepting funds from the Central Intelligence Agency in return for performing missions for the CIA in foreign countries. While the revelation of this secret deal by "Ramparts" magazine last spring might well be just cause for shame, the reaction of NSA was extreme. But a more disturbing factor was the fact that the convention seemed to be trying to make the concept of student power an imitation of the extreme "Black Power" advocates. Regardless of the merits of "Black Power," students are not generally faced with the same problems that face deprived Negroes.

Much of the student power concept stems from the valid assumption that student activities which depend on financial support from the college or university will also have to deal with control from the same source. Money or the lack of money is certainly one of the most effective control devices in our society. Realizing this fact of life, some student governments, student newspapers, and other such activities began trying to establish independent money sources a few years ago. This was a wise step that would achieve its end of reducing school control. But now it seems that much of the student thought is trying to twist this sound idea around into something else much less effective. Breaking the lines of communication is something quite different from cutting the apron strings. Yet adhering to the idea of "Don't trust anybody over 30" as some student leaders seem to be trying to do is simply rejecting whatever help they can receive from members of their school faculty and administration. Students have sense enough to know that they cannot believe or accept everything handed out to them by their elders. Such pronouncements from the people who thus far have failed to come up with the solutions to the misery of this much-battered world must always be taken with the proverbial grain of salt. But all of the members of the college or university community are basically committed to the same tasks. For them to act as enemies is useless.

**Now Use It**

Walking through Chambers Building is the best argument to be found in support of the administration's decision to renovate the old building instead of constructing a new classroom and administration building. Greatly improved lighting and tasteful decoration give the inside a brightness and newness that shows off the excellent job done by the designers of the renovation project. President D. Grier Martin told the freshman class last week that a new building incorporating the features found in the present building would cost about $3 million. The renovation cost less than a third of that amount by making use of a very sound building. The old building is in such shape that it caused one foreman on the job to note that it was built like a "cement battleship." Not to make full use of the building would be an insult to the men who directed the project.

Quiet study space has always been at a premium at Davidson, especially for groups of students who want to get together for discussion. Such attempts in the dorms easily turn into general hall bull sessions that accomplish nothing. A deliberate attempt has been made in Chambers to increase seminar facilities. If the college could overcome the paranoia which causes it to lock up the building at 4:30 p.m. every day, these rooms could be utilized for evening and afternoon study. The atmosphere in the bright new rooms is certainly much more inviting than the gloomy confines of the library. If the Student Council would sponsor late hours for Chambers, it could supervise room use so that students would not be troubled by the confusion found in dormitories. Such supervision could also make sure that the study privilege was not abused.

**An Easy Out**

Regardless of whether or not Rap Brown and James Foreman have relieved any of the black people's misery, they certainly have made things a lot nicer for right-wingers and others who specialize in easy solutions. Few Negroes are really going to get anything worthwhile by exchanging political and economic action for demagoguery and violence. Every step in that direction, moreover, is to the advantage of the comfortable whites who want to find the answers to the problems of the Negro and the poor in general in simple homilies from America's Puritan past.

This summer's lawlessness demonstrated the inability of metropolitan police to deal with the problems of their cities. Ghetto dwellers had been pointing this failure out for years. But they were talking about police brutality, something that had no meaning for the comfortable and respected middle-class. Now, all of a sudden, the ineptitude of much of the nation's police force has been made real to the honkeys in a different way. So they have started calling for improved police training and certain changes in the legal structure. Both of these are certainly needed. But those changes are irrelevant to the issues which led to this summer's violence. Commendation of thrift and hard work, appeals for improved police protection and consideration, and condemnation of Rap Brown and Stokely Carmichael have been adopted by the uninformed and the apathetic as easy solutions to the racial and economic problems of this country. It seems that all a community needs is an underfinanced alphabetical poverty agency run by the local rich and a strong police force. This is the sort of hypocrisy that causes the frustrations which lead to looting and race riots instead of honest attempts at meaningful solutions.

**Carpetbagger?**

Davidson students made many giant steps toward achieving real student responsibility within the college community last year. Instead of sitting back to enjoy its laurels, however, the student body must hasten to take advantage of some of the opportunities facing it. Some members of the Board of Trustees have indicated a willingness to accept some informal student participation in their meeting this fall. The Blue Sky Committee has discussed favorably more informal direct student responsibility in the actual governing and running of the college. The contributions that students can make to Davidson are becoming more respected all of the time.

Yesterday President Martin noted that Tom Earnhardt, student body president, had launched a campaign to have the carpet in the College Union lounge replaced. Admittedly, a new rug is necessary, especially since the present collection of rat fur that serves as a carpet presents such a bad image of the college to the prospective students who make the Union a regular stop on their initial tours. But is this an issue which should have to occupy the energies of the student body president? At least the Student Council could get around to naming a successor to the now-graduated Doug Woodworth who presented student views to the Blue Sky Committee last year.

**LETTERS TO THE EDITOR**

**Student GI Reacts To War**

EDITOR'S NOTE: Mike Sigman is a 21-year-old freshman who has just completed four years in the U.S. Marine Corps. He has just returned from a tour of duty in Vietnam.

To The Editor:

Earlier this year I retired from the Marine Corps in order to acquire my B.S. in electrical engineering, although I have previously attained many honors in B.S. before. With these qualifications and goals in mind, I began to pack my bag for the trip to Davidson, which I have since fallen in love with — along with Charlotte. I cannot say that I was instilled with any deep love for the Corps, but I must admit to an indebtedness for the experience that I might not have gained had I gone immediately into college from high school. Not many colleges would have sent me to Vietnam. On the other hand, the Marine Corps didn't make me wear a beanie.many Fea os“ 9, LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

sides represented in the engrossing political drama of Vietnam — LBJ's, Ho Chi's, the American Negro, etc. ad infinitum. With so many pithy statements floating about, anyone with any experience or imagination concerning Vietnam is naturally supposed to have deep convictions about the pro’s and con’s. In short, you have to choose sides. However, it has been my experience as a Jarhead that the mind tends to work on more immediate problems . . . the heat, the omnipresent dust, the shortage of food and time to eat it, the endless work details, how to make money on the black market and so forth. There is a certain element of danger to consider, also. At best, a tour of Vietnam can be described as a hard job with conditions and pay below union standards, and not as a practical exercise in philosophy.

Now that I am ensconced in Davidson, I can more comfortably ponder the remarks of Isidore, Physiologus, Pliny, LBJ and H. Rap Brown... or even formulate some sort of opinion about “'Nam.” It would be too lengthy to list all the contributing factors to my reasoning, so I'll merely give the result of my mental magic — WAR IS BAD — which is actually rather profound. Nay, astounding. I suspected as much while I was getting shot at.

What's it like coming from the Marines into college? It’s a lot like I had expected it, but there were a few surprises those first days. Davidson is definitely not the dog-eat-dog world of the Marine Corps. Our BMOC's are more subtle than I gave them credit for, and a lot of them are good guys, even. None of the faculty have been extremely zany, except for one instance where I was rudely awakened in assembly by a gunshot. And me a poor veteran! I am surprised at how much attention is given to providing the freshmen with good times and guiding hands.

Agency Urges Wine Taste-In

To The Editor:

As you may know, the California Wine Institute has been conducting wine tastings on college campuses throughout the country. These lectures have been received most enthusiastically by both students and faculty as an entertaining and informative cultural event. Other literature discusses the Institute's wine-tasting program. You will note that it reports on tastings which have already been conducted at such schools as Yale, Harvard and Dartmouth.

It occurred to us that you might be interested in hosting one of these events as a unique campus activity. As public relations counsel to the Wine Institute, we will be happy to coordinate all details, and to provide a selection of California wines—a speaker—and appropriate literature.

If this program is of interest to you, please contact us. Also, we would appreciate receiving a choice of dates for your event so that we can be sure to have a speaker available.

Sincerely,

Council President Hits NSA

For four days in August Tom Earnhardt, Davidson Student Council president, journeyed to College Park, Md., as the council’s representative to the National Student Association congress. Although not a voting delegate to the two-week meeting of 3000 students from over 300 American colleges, Earnhardt said he received several distinct impressions about the controversial student organization.

“I don't think this organization is at all representative of students across the nation,” stated Earnhardt. “Although it is the largest and probably most representative of the national student organizations, I find it ridiculous to think that NSA can make student policy for this country.

“The country is not equally represented in all areas,” he continued. “A large percentage of the students came from the West Coast, the Northeast, Michigan and Minnesota schools. The Ivy League and Southern colleges were sparsely represented.”

Earnhardt said his purpose in attending the congress was “to evaluate the usefulness of possible future membership in NSA to Davidson College.” Davidson withdrew from the organization two years ago. “I don't believe Davidson would benefit much from joining again,” he said. “NSA publications are already available to us at a slightly higher rate than members pay, and other NSA assistance, such as block-booking of entertainers, is not needed badly here.

“The contact with other schools received through the organization is valuable,” he added, “but it can be obtained in other ways.”

Several “pressure” groups such as Students for Democratic Society were present at the meeting pushing programs for NSA support. Some of the legislation was “politically oriented” and reflected some views of such groups. A number of interesting “social action” bills were introduced in the areas of Black Power and women’s rights. He felt that NSA opinion probably were not looked on as the judgment of experts. He said that “it was very hard for the good at NSA to be separated from the bad because NSA was misrepresented by the press in a number of cases.”

“I don't feel it would be politically disastrous for Davidson to join NSA,” he concluded. “I just feel it is senseless to join an organization that offers us few real benefits.”

When asked what would be the major issues facing the Davidson Student Council this year, he cited the completion of a new and more workable student body constitution as the most prominent. He also cited the expansion of the Educational Planning program and the restoration of Monday chapels to the Student Council as changes. He said other changes and projects for the coming year would be announced after the completion of several meetings.

The New Davidson

Looking Backward

By GEOFF SEAMANS
Associate Editor

This fall, the returning Davidson student not only experiences the malaise and/or excitement which normally accompanies the beginning of a new academic year, but he must also articulate a response to the sudden renovation of the interior of Chambers.

My personal response is mixed. Coupled with an appreciation of the fact that the building is now at least presentable, a feeling of guilt is produced, a feeling which accompanies the spending of money and which is familiar to those of us who have grown up in the Calvinist tradition. Perhaps regrettably, within this mixed response of guilt and appreciation there seems little feeling of nostalgia. The cause of this lack is uncertain, but I strongly suspect that a three-year paucity of nostalgia-inducing events is a contributing factor. The lack of nostalgia strengthens my appreciation of the renovation project, but the Calvinist guilt feeling stubbornly resists disintegration.

After all, the purpose of the College for years seems to have been the production of soldiers for a Christ defined in conservative, Presbyterian terms. Such a mission called not for the introduction of educational frills such as sound wiring and lighting systems, but rather for a Spartan environment and the application of “Christian stewardship” in the application of funds. Deviation from this pattern, exemplified in a minor way by the remodeling project, leads to confusion and chaos in the minds of those cognizant of the change.

Just as the positive factor in my response to the renovation is reinforced by the lack of nostalgia, so too is the negative guilt factor reinforced by the automatic negativeness with which one must respond to anything perpetrated by college officials. The tenor of the times makes it in bad taste, even gauche, to say anything good about the designs of a college administration.

Poem

EDITOR'S NOTE: Kem Anderson, a 1967 Davidson graduate, was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant upon completion of the advanced ROTC course last June. He is now living in Charlotte until he goes on active duty in April 1969.

On Hearing the General at Commissioning

Walls line borders
Where plowed fields
Make a vision clear
For sights that place red marks
On green shirts of youth,
Selling out to causes
In ditches stinking with freedom
To kill and die young
And become a man.
