TURNING THE TIDE

“Winning is extremely important.” This, says new head football coach Homer Smith, “is our objective.” And if a likable personality
and an amount of confidence in the future are significant steps toward achieving this goal, he won't be long in
reaching it. Winning more Southern Conference matches is of prime importance in Smith’s plans, as Davidson has won only two
of its last 19 league tilts. Notes the Nebraskan, “We have got to win more conference games.”

“In the future, we will play enough conference games every year to have a chance at the conference championship,” he
adds. Undaunted by the disadvantages of having fewer scholarships and higher admission requirements than other conference schools, Smith says that
“the fact that we do have fewer scholarships and a small school will make our efforts all the more meaningful.
However, some day we will have more scholarships.”

In addition to conference foes, he says that “we're going to find our natural rivals, I’m not sure who they
are, and play them. For one thing, I think we should play Princeton. We’re both Presbyterian schools and it is
sort of a natural.”

Coach Smith's optimism is somewhat contagious—one can hardly help but feel that the skills that made him the asset he
was to the staffs at California and Air Force combined with his optimism and confidence may turn the tide of
Davidson losing seasons.

Homer Smith Appeals For Recruiting Leads

COACH HOMER SMITH

Not 100-0 Next Year

Heckard Turns Pro

In a surprise move just before Christmas, Davidson quarterback Steve Heckard announced his signing with the Los Angeles Rams of
the National Football League. Details of the contract were withheld, but Heckard reportedly received a “nice” bonus for signing. The
contract came as a result of a recommendation to the Rams by Catawba College coach Harvey Stratton, the Rams’ “bird
dog” in this area. In 1963 Catawba defeated Davidson 18-14, but Heckard caught seven passes for a new Davidson record.

He says that Davidson will have winning football—and Smith is a man who seems to know what he is talking
about.

FOOTBALL SCHEDULE

Davidson’s 1965 nine-game football schedule, released by Athletic Director Tom Scott, shows five home games and five conference tilts. George
Washington and William and Mary are newcomers to the schedule, replacing Mississippi College and Richmond from this fall. In addition
to these two teams, Furman, Citadel, and VMI are the other conference opponents.

Sept. 18 Presbyterian Davidson
Sept. 25 Furman Greenville, S. C.
Oct. 2 The Citadel Charleston, S. C.
Oct. 16 William & Mary Davidson
Oct. 23 VMI Davidson
Oct. 30 George Washington Washington, D.C.
Nov. 6 Lehigh Davidson
Nov. 13 Lafayette Easton, Pa.
Nov. 20 Wofford Davidson

NOTES

Navy and Mississippi State have agreed to play in the Charlotte Invitational next year, joining Davidson and another team yet
to be chosen. Next year’s basketball schedule will include Charlotte.

Heckard just completed an outstanding rookie season with the Rams. Los Angeles sent former All-Pro end Elroy “Crazy Legs” Hirsch
to sign Heckard, who as an undrafted free agent had also received offers from the Minnesota Vikings. Heckard will fly
out to Los Angeles in early July to show his skills to the Ram front office. He will be tried
as a split end or flanker, returning to his old position as a pass receiver where he set four Davidson
pass-receiving records. Besides his single game mark against Catawba, he holds single game records of most yards gained from pass
receptions with 123, and longest pass play, an 89-yard bomb from Earl Cole against William and Mary in 1962. He
also holds the single season record for most yards gained from pass receptions with 519, set in 1962.

Assistant coach Roger Thrift, who was in on the signing, commented enthusiastically, “I am very excited with his signing with
the Rams; they are going to give him a long look. He will have to gain some weight (Heckard is
6'3", and weighs 185) and he's going to start the weight-lifting program they asked him to do very soon.”

HIGH SCHOOL HERO

His athletic abilities first came to light in track. At Benson High School where he was graduated in 1949, he
earned two letters in football, three in basketball and four in track. He was All-City in both track and football,
and All-State in track. Smith then went to the East where he attended Lawrenceville School, a highly regarded preparatory school
in New Jersey. He lettered twice there and was named to the All-State Football Team. From Lawrenceville he went to
Princeton University. There he was an excellent all-around student. Smith graduated cum laude in economics. He was elected president of
his class in his sophomore, junior and senior years.

Stating it mildly, his athletic record at Princeton was outstanding as he participated in track and football. His first visit
to North Carolina came during those days as a member of the track squad that competed at North Carolina and
Duke. “Football was even more his piece of pie. “If I were not now a coach, I would remember myself
as more of a player than I do now. I see that I was just an average player. Those were
some of the greatest years of Princeton football,” mused Smith. “It was only natural that one of the backs would
be lucky. I was just fortunate enough to have a few good days.”

During his sophomore and junior years, Princeton lost only one game. The Tigers were Ivy League champions both years. They
received the Lambert Trophy signifying that they were the best team in the East.

IVY RECORD

The statistics, however, belie his personal modesty. In 1953 he set a punting record at Princeton by booting the pigskin
for an average of 40 yards. He set the still-standing Ivy League record of 273 yards rushing in a single
game against Harvard. For his efforts the “lucky” back who happened to “have a good day” was named to the
All-Ivy and All-East teams. He also made Honorable Mention All-American. During his senior year he was captain of the Tiger
squad.

After a two-year tour of duty with the U. S. Army at Fort Sill, Okla., he headed back to the
campus. He attended Stanford University where he earned aMaster's Degree in Business Administration. While doing his graduate work, Smith took
on the job of coaching the freshman football squad. After graduation, he remained at Stanford to work as a full-time
coach for the Junior Varsity and as head of the recruiting program.

HIGH-POWERED OFFENSE

During this period, Stanford was a nationally renowned offensive power. The squad led the nation in forward passing, receiving, total
offense, and scoring. They had the highest percentage of pass completions for a single game. The national record for individual
passing in a single game was tied.

In 1961, Smith took the job of assistant at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colo., as defensive backfield
coach. After two seasons in this position, he moved to offensive backfield coach. Head coach Ben Martin of the Academy
introduced his “Flexible-T” offensive formation at this time, and Homer Smith was credited with being “the man directly responsible for
making the ‘Flexible-T’ go.” In Smith's first season as offensive backfield coach, the Falcons went all the way to the
Gator Bowl in Florida. During the past season, the Air Force Academy managed only a 4-5-1 record against such opposition
as Michigan, Notre Dame, and Washington. Important, however, was the fact that Smith's backfield continued to set new offensive records
for the Academy.

Alabama, Ohio U. Humbled As ’Cats Take Tournament

Davidson’s Wildcats, showing for the first time this year some of the finesse to give him a long look when
he goes out there. “In my recommendation, increases in the living endowment have upped the number of football scholarships this
year to 41.6 (from 40 last year) and the basketball subsidies from 11.6 to 12. Dr. Scott is in Chicago
at the NCAA convention, and the football coaches and track coach Heath Whittle will arrive there this weekend for coaches’
meetings next week.

Wildcats Romp Over W&M, Va., Ohio State

By JOHN TODD
Davidsonian Managing Editor

The Davidson Wildcats streaked to five straight wins at the Charlotte Coliseum during the Christmas holidays, including victories over Ohio
State, Virginia, William and Mary, and the championship of the Charlotte Invitational Tournament. The ‘Cats walloped Ohio State, 87-64, on
Saturday, Dec. 19, to begin their holiday spree. Fred Hetzel led the way with 28 points and 15 rebounds, both
game highs. Dick Snyder followed with 22 points, but it was Hetzel who sparked the Wildcats in both halves. Hetzel
scored the team’s first nine points in the game and the first 11 points for Davidson in the second half.

Rebounding told the story in the second half as the Cavalier shooting eye cooled. Don Davidson provided the impetus with
some clutch shooting on both layups and free throws. He finished the night with 22 points and 10 rebounds, his
season high point-wise. “They clipped us on the boards,” said Cavalier Coach Bill Gibson, “and took advantage of a flurry
of mistakes to pop the game open. Hetzel was great, as usual,” continued Gibson after it was over. “And Snyder
hurt us inside. But Davidson... oh, Davidson killed us.”

Suffering the wrath of the ‘Cats’ two-game 48.8 percent shooting were the big, talented, and scrappy Crimson Tide from the
University of Alabama and the hustling but often erratic Bobcats from Ohio University. In the first round, the ‘Cats, after
sixteen minutes of giving Alabama a nice welcome, proceeded to turn the Tide 79 to 62. With 2:25 remaining in
the first half, Davidson trailed 26 to 21, but before the buzzer sounded, the ‘Cats had poured in thirteen points
to Alabama's five, thus holding a 32-31 halftime lead. At the opening of the second half, Davidson's Charlie Marcon dumped
in seven quick points, which with a three-point play by Fred Hetzel stretched the lead to eight points. From then
on, a harassing Davidson defense combined with a well-balanced scoring attack to put the game on ice. Leading the scorers
for Davidson was Snyder with 25, followed by Hetzel with 18 points and 10 rebounds, Don Davidson with 17, and
Charlie Marcon with 10. Davidson’s guards, Barry Teague and Marcon, teamed up to steal the ball from Alabama guards several
times.

In the championship game, the Wildcats won easily 81 to 63 over outclassed Ohio. In the first half, All-American Fred
Hetzel poured in 18 points to give the ‘Cats a 42-31 lead. Charlie Marcon again started the second half with
six game-breaking points in the first six minutes. After this, the ‘Cats built up to a 20-point lead before the
subs took over. The 11,666 fans were brought to their feet numerous times as Hetzel, Snyder, Marcon, and Teague made
many beautiful shots and defensive maneuvers. Paul Briggs did an excellent job of filling in for Don Davidson, who was
unable to play the last thirty minutes because of a foot injury he received against Alabama the previous night.

A total of 17 fouls was called on the Wildcats to nine against the Indians; moreover, only three W&M players
were called for personals at all. The Wildcats broke a William and Mary stall in the second half to win
going away, 77-37. The Indians’ deliberate slow-down style was effective for the first half as they trailed the ‘Cats by
only a point, 26-25. But after the respite, it was gangway. “We thought controlling the ball was the best way
to win,” said Indian Coach Bill Chambers after the game, “but after Davidson exploded, we just had to go for
broke.” Hetzel and Snyder led all scorers with 22 and 21 points respectively. Paul Briggs filled in adequately for ailing
Don Davidson with 27 points and 13 rebounds. Hetzel went 12 for 17 from the floor against the Buckeyes that
night, 70.6 percent. Against Virginia the following Tuesday night, the Wildcats hit 60.3 from the floor as they stomped the
Cavaliers 86-74.
