A toast was given to Robert E. Lee, the day being the anniversary of his birth, and all united in paying tribute to the great soldier and leader. Among the guests at the dinner were Professors Thos. W. Lingle, Porter, and Goldiere; Major Hearne and Captain George of the Davidson faculty; Captain Reed Morrison, former commander of Battery F, 113th field artillery; Messrs. Baker, Sorrells, Woods, and Allison, of the student body, and Past Commander Harry Caldwell, of the American Legion.

**FINISH OF EXAMS LIFTS CLOUD OF WORRY**

Although to some the ordeal of exams was well-nigh fatal, others passed unscathed and possibly 75 percent of the seniors beheld the agony of their friends from a distance, happy and secure in exemption. Large numbers even passed to their homes, sublimely oblivious of the anguish endured by their fellow students. Again the bell rang and the morning of February 1 marked the ending of it all. The earth and the planets were forgotten in the turmoil of classes, meals, rain, and the things that accompany the birth of a new term.

Our J. H. Johnston Dies at Old Home

James H. Johnston, a prominent and most highly esteemed citizen of the town and community, died at his home here on January 23. For a year or two past, old age made him practically an invalid. He was born on October 28, 1836, and was in his eighty-seventh year. Until 18 months ago, he had always been active and energetic. Most of Mr. Johnston’s life was spent in lower Iredell, where he owned good farming land along and close to the Catawba. Prior to moving to Davidson in 1904, he and his family had been residents of Denver for about 18 years. Mr. Johnston is survived by his widow, who before her marriage was Miss Eugenia Proctor, of Beattie’s Ford vicinity, and by four children, two sons and two daughters: Richard Johnston, an attorney at law, Norfolk, Va.; Patrick Johnston, connected with the American Tobacco Company, stationed now at Samsun, Turkey; Mrs. J. F. Brawley, of Mooresville; and Miss Julia Johnston, a member of the faculty of the Davidson High School. The funeral services were conducted by Dr. Richards of the Presbyterian Church, assisted by Rev. Foster of the Methodist Church.

Revival at Brawley’s

Dr. James Towle, now a graduate student of Princeton Seminary, Hodge Fellow at Union Seminary, and a graduate of Davidson College, held a meeting at Brawley’s recently. This lately organized church was for several years a Sunday school or mission point, in which Mooresville was interested in the upbuilding of the church. Mr. Towle, while a student at Davidson, made many attempts to join the ranks on that day but few succeeded. To the freshman class was added one, Calvin Young, of Selma, Ala. The sophomores welcomed back a lost sheep, Dick Faison, who had been separated from them since commencement.
