**Fall semester goals set**

By John Helms
Staff Writer

With the end of the term nearing, SGA drew out its three primary goals for the rest of the semester
and into next fall. Members approved three out of the five submitted proposals.

The first goal sets out to establish an ad hoc committee, “Accessibility and Accountability,” that would inform current members and
the larger student body about the intricacies of SGA procedure. Explaining the broader goal of this committee, SGA president Katharine
Hubbard ’05 said, “This not only deals with SGA members but will also strive to expand to the whole student
body. We discussed possible SGA office hours where students could come ask questions.” Some SGA members were concerned about the
fact that members would not be paid for extra office hours. They noted that other universities such as Elon had
mandatory but paid office hours.

The second item approved as a goal for SGA was to have bimonthly meetings during which students could meet with
members of the administration. Hubbard said, “That [bimonthly meeting] is just a possible time frame depending on participation. But we
would like to host an event in which Bobby Vagt, Dean Shandley, etc. came and where students could come and
just chat or ask questions.”

The last and most complex goal approved by SGA was concerning costs involved with the upkeep of various campus organizations.
Committee member Rhett Merrill ’04 emphasized that there is only a tentative plan at this point regarding the matter of
equipment upkeep. “The problem is that there is not currently a system in place to track when equipment was last
replaced, and since ATC is a student committee, its members don’t have the institutional memory to know [about equipment upkeep
and depreciation expenditures] without a record system,” Merrill said. With equipment being replaced too soon, too late, or not at
all because of replacement costs, Merrill observed the need for a system that would provide a certain level of upkeep.
He noted that ATC struggles with equipment requests from various organizations every year. Many of these requests go unfulfilled. While
the program is still in its preliminary stages, the first steps would be to inventory all of the equipment for
the school’s organizations in order to produce a replacement schedule. “It’s important to keep the organizations up to a certain
standard,” said Merrill. Concerning the establishment of the fund, Merrill said, “By creating an account that builds funds equal to
depreciation expenses, we will ensure that there is money available when equipment needs to be replaced.”

**Sanctuary, from page 1**

The 2003 Freshman Orientation planners purchased these “sweat-free” t-shirts last year for the Orientation Team. Associate Dean of Student Life
Kathy Bray-Merrell said, “The t-shirts were no more expensive than what we had paid in the past, even including shipping
costs. And, the quality was every bit as good as what we would have expected from any other supplier.” CoHo,
the co-ed eating house, has already agreed also to purchase their t-shirts from the Women’s Co-op.

Buying cheaper t-shirts directly from overseas also strikes the nerve of some with larger concerns about outsourcing and textile industry
protection, issues already proving to be political battlegrounds for the upcoming presidential election. This is especially true in North Carolina
where nearly 82,000 jobs were eliminated on net in the textiles industries between 1977 and 1997.

Sanctuary is not protesting against local distributors who buy their t-shirts from non-certified “sweat-free” companies. Rather, they are proactively supporting
the livelihood of a particular Nicaraguan community that members of the Davidson community have formed relationships with. But what are
the possible effects on current relationships between the College, the town, and local businesses?

Hageman estimates that Davidson Screen Printers makes about nine to 10,000 shirts a year for Davidson College. He worries that
a significant cut in business would make it even harder for him to provide the benefits and fair wages he
believes in for his seven employees. “I’m trying to provide my people with a livable wage, but our medical insurance
bill went up 38 percent this year... People may have to start paying a little more just to keep Americans
working,” Hageman said.

Hageman spoke of two local textile plants that recently shut down in the past five years; Burlington denim factory in
Mooresville and Pillowtex sheets and towels factory in Kannapolis, 12 miles west of Davidson. Together, over 5,000 people lost jobs.
“Unemployment is usually transitory,” said Professor of Economics Vikram Kumar. According to Kumar, the...Falling employment nationally and statewide in traditional
industry sectors, such as textiles and apparel, is a normal effect of global market capitalism. “These domestic industries have been
protected by the government for the last twenty years under the Multi Fibre Arrangement (MFA) and they’re still not competitive
in the global market,” Kumar said. “I don’t want to downplay the hardships of those who lose their jobs, but
at the same time America has a fairly good social safety net for the unemployed.”

Student Costs of “sweat-free” shirts

The actual cost of t-shirts could rise slightly, depending on the quality of fabric, quantity, and color. White t-shirts can
be bought for $2.75 per shirt through the Presbyterian Church USA, which ships them internationally and warehouses a stockpile cost-free
to consumers. Colored t-shirts (blue, grey, yellow, cream, red, etc.) can be purchased for $4.23 per shirt through a company
called North Country Fair Trade (NCFT) which transports shirts for a charge but does not make a profit, according to
Brew. Organizations may have to make two separate orders: one for shirts and another for screen printing. The Women’s Sewing
Co-op has custom silkscreening services, but if buying through the Presbyterian Church or NCFT, students would have to bypass this
option.

Alumnus promoted to position of U.S. Associate Deputy General

Davidson graduate John Davis ’81, has recently been promoted to the position of Associate Deputy General of the United States.
Originally from Charlottesville, Virginia, Davis majored in philosophy at Davidson and went on to graduate from Harvard Law School in
1985. Davis now lives in Richmond, Virginia with his wife Susan and daughters Natalie, Staige, and Lucy.

Although Davis has always been a prosecutor, he has dealt with many different types of trials, including drug cases, violent
crimes, and environmental law. Davis began his legal career in New Hampshire, working for a year as a judge’s clerk
before proceeding to work in the state’s Attorney General’s Office where he handled homicide cases. In 1990, Davis moved to
Atlanta and joined the United States Attorney’s Office as an Assistant U.S. Attorney. Davis was promoted to Chief of the
Criminal Division in 1994 and maintained that position until 1997. One of the more famed cases Davis worked on during
this time is the Olympic bombing case and the prosecution of Eric Robert Rudolph.

Davis moved to Richmond in 1997 in order to be closer to family. There, he began working in the Eastern
District of Virginia Richmond Office. As the Criminal Supervisor in Richmond, Davis worked on several high-profile cases. Davis was the
second chair attorney involved with the Saudi terrorist bombing of Khobar Towers complex in which 19 U.S. Air Force members
were killed in 1996. Davis was also involved in the John Walker Lindh indictment, in which the American Taliban member
pleaded guilty in 2002.

While in Richmond, Davis befriended Jim Comey — the head prosecutor in the city at that time. After Comey was
made Deputy Attorney General of the United States in 2003, he requested that Davis be a part of his staff
and made him an Associate Deputy General. As Associate Deputy General, Davis works within a large organization concerned with policy
management for the Department of Justice. The organization is comprised of more than 100,000 employees and includes the Federal Bureau
of Investigation and the U.S. Attorney’s Office.

Davis has recently returned from Baghdad where he has been working on an Iraqi war crimes project concerning the establishment
of an Iraqi court — the Iraqi Special Tribunal — which will try the most serious members of Saddam Hussein’s
regime, specifically concerning the atrocities that occurred during the first Gulf War and the Iran-Iraq war in 1987 and 1988.
Davis’ department is setting up to advise prosecutors, investigators, and judges to assist with the trials.

Davis’ roommate of four years, the college’s current Director of Auxiliary Services, Richard Terry, describes John as a “truly remarkable
person and friend.” “He is one of the kindest and giving people I have ever known. He’s one of those
people we always knew would do something special and important. He is selfless, ego-less, and an amazingly hard worker,” Terry
said.
