Article XII Controversy: Censorship Insistence Denies Student Media

As soon as the Governance Committee Subcommittee on the Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities released the ninth draft of the proposed Article XII of the College Constitution for public scrutiny, we again heard controversy concerning student media. The primary problem with which this community has to grapple concerns the amount of editorial freedom given to student editors when the college, as publisher, is legally liable for the content of student publications. Individual writers and editors are also held legally accountable for publication content.

College President Samuel R. Spencer Jr. expressed concern that the statement did not protect the college's rights as publisher. He maintains that the college cannot guarantee freedom from censorship, a major point in the Article XII draft. Yet as Governance Committee Chairman Walter L. Lingle said, “I’m certainly not in favor of advanced approval of copy; that is not a workable or acceptable option to anyone.”

Removal of Editors

To remove final authority in editorial decisions from student editors is to make the publications something other than the student press. We feel that if the college cannot condone the content of a publication, as publisher, it must remove the editor. Provisions for the removal of editors are contained in the draft. As Charlotte Observer Managing Editor David Lawrence said this week, “I feel the college is better served by vesting the greatest possible amount of editorial freedom in students, and this is freedom from prior censorship. I have no qualms when the college, through due process, decides upon the removal of editors. That’s how we work here at The Observer.”

Charlotte Observer Editor Pete McKnight indicated that if he were the publisher of the college student newspaper, he would insist upon a policy of no prior restraint, allowing maximum freedom for student editors and staffs. Such a policy calls attention to the relationship of student editors to the Board of Trustees. And the model of the relationship in professional newspapers between publisher and editor breaks down at this point: At Davidson, editors are not hired by the publisher; they are volunteers elected by the student body. If the college, as publisher, does not hire students to edit its publications, removal of editors must be accomplished by the constituency electing them, the Student Government Association.

Publisher Protection

The proposed Article XII calls for the establishment of a student communications advisory board. Such a board would logically recommend to the SGA Senate that student editors be impeached for due cause. Such a procedure provides the necessary checks on editorial freedom, protecting the college as publisher. If the college insists upon censorship powers, there is no reason to include a section on student media in the proposed Article XII. Without the freedom from prior restraint, there is no relationship between college and students necessary. Publications without final authority entrusted to student editors fail to be student publications.

#### Letter to the Editor

**Alabamian counters Westmoreland’s slurs**

To the Editor:

My sister recently sent me a clipping from the school newspaper at Mississippi State University; it was an excerpt from the verbal feces of one Bob Westmoreland, written for your paper. This Mr. Westmoreland, presumably a Davidson student (certainly not a "Davidson Gentleman"), apparently has some serious hang-up or two regarding my two favorite Southern states—Alabama and Mississippi. My sister felt that, in her words, "it was so meaningless and pointless, I saw no reason to waste a stamp." Regarding her summation of the value of the article, I cannot agree more firmly. However, she is not a Davidson graduate; I am. Thus, I feel more "compelled," one might say, to offer a reply.

I was born in Alabama, and on the maternal side, I am a fifth-generation Alabamian. I have lived for all of my life (with the exception of schooling in Monterrey, Mexico, Davidson, N.C., and Tuscaloosa, Ala.) in Butler, a small town only 35 miles southeast of Meridian, Mississippi. Thus, I have a good degree of familiarity with both states. I am married to a young lady who was born in Alabama, a sixth-generation Alabamian on the maternal side and a fifth-generation Alabamian on the paternal line. She is well-educated (having received her B.S. degree in Chemistry in your own dear state of North Carolina, Mr. Westmoreland) and a highly refined woman. We are the parents of a small daughter who is quite special, naturally.

I was reared in an atmosphere of respectability, honesty, and Southern "good manners" and the like. Both my parents are college graduates. All of my grandparents had college experience. I am the son and grandson of former (deceased) bank presidents and the brother of a bank president. One grandfather was also an attorney; the other was an accountant. In North Carolina, I met many schoolmates from various states who did not even know who their grandparents were.

If you are saying, Mr. W., that the people from Alabama and Mississippi are lacking in refinement, then I say, in short: Bunk! We do not "worship" our ancestors, as the accusations go; however, neither do we "worship" the popular misconceptions perpetrated by the Eastern establishment media and the spineless and gullible college students, like Mr. W., who so readily succumb to the propaganda they regularly "churn" out.

In concluding, I might make mention of the fact that many times I have crossed the Alabama-Mississippi line three or four times daily, and never have I seen any such signs or places as described by Mr. W. Perhaps your North Carolina glasses aren't made properly; or, do you need to enroll in the government's "Right to Read" program so that you can discern whatever the words are that trouble you!

And, so, as I relax in my 'Bama abode, and you slave away in the old D.C. library, I can only say, "Eat your heart out, Baby!"
