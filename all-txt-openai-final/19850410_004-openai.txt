Morris Outlines Future Of Davidson Athletics

By ANDREA DIEDRICH

Athletic Director Kit Morris told a 900 Room crowd that, “The strongest assets the athletic program at Davidson has are the intelligence of our athletes and their ambition and drive.”

At last Wednesday’s Open Luncheon, Morris spoke on the future of Davidson athletics and introduced new Head Coach Victor Gatto. 

Looking at the future of athletics at Davidson, Morris said, “It is important to me that our teams are able to compete with the teams we play against.” This desire is related to Davidson’s low standing in the Southern Conference. Because Davidson is the smallest school attempting to compete in Division I, its size puts its teams at a disadvantage when they play against several schools in the conference.

Morris spoke about two trends he has noticed in the world of college athletics. One trend, which he sees as a positive one, is a dramatic increase in the opportunities for women in athletics in the last decade. The other trend, which he finds troubling, is a growing movement toward professionalism in college athletics over the past 15 years. Morris said many schools sponsor teams that could almost be ranked as professionals. As a result, those teams do not represent the student body. Morris hopes to be able to go to the NCAA and receive permission to seek out competition. He also said there is a possibility of joining the Colonial League, which is made up of schools including Lehigh, Lafayette, William and Mary, Bucknell, and Colgate.

Morris also expressed concern about the relationship of athletics with the students and faculty. “I think it is important that we can use athletics to bring the college community together,” Morris said. He hopes that Gatto will help to unite the football team with the community.

Introduced as the “model of the coach/educator,” Gatto said he is excited about being at Davidson. In a flippant but possibly serious comment, he urged Davidson students not to pursue a career in coaching. He said, “It’s a career of desperation.”

Morris added that he hopes Davidson will eventually build a new athletic facility and stressed the importance of making sure “the new facility can accommodate as wide a range of possibilities as are desired.” He also hopes to gain support for the women’s athletic programs.

Excellent summer counseling opportunities for men and women who are interested in serving boys and girls ages 7-16, guiding them in their physical, mental, and spiritual development. Only those persons who will dedicate their wholehearted efforts to help each individual child develop his or her potential should apply. One must have the ability to teach in one or more of our specialized activities. College students, teachers, and coaches should apply. CAMP THUNDERBIRD, located 17 miles southeast of Charlotte, N.C., is an ACA accredited camp member, specializing in water sports (sailing, water skiing, swimming, and canoeing), yet an added emphasis is placed on the land sports (general athletics, tennis, golf, archery, riflery, and backpacking). Horseback riding, white-water canoeing, and tripping are extras in our excellent program. For further information write or call G. William Climer, Jr., Director, Camp Thunderbird, Route 7, Box 50, Clover, S.C., 29710 (803-831-2121).
