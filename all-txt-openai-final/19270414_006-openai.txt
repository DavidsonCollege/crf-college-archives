6 THE DAVIDSONIAN, APRIL 14, 1927

Mattox and Tilson Guide Cats to Win

The Davidson Wildcats defeated the Charlotte Road Club in a baseball game Tuesday afternoon, 13 to 5. The high score of Davidson was due to the making of fifteen safe bingles while the visitors made seven errors. The feature batteries of the afternoon for Davidson were Coach “Tex” Tilson as pitcher and Coach “Monk” Mattox as catcher. Both were relieved in the fifth inning by Poole and McGeachy respectively. Tilson struck out eight men in the five innings he twirled, while Poole fanned six in the four brackets he pitched. Dudlin of Davidson led the hitting with a triple, double, and single. Watkins for Charlotte knocked a home run in the first inning.

Scrubs Win Initial Diamond Encounter

The Davidson scrubs in their first game of the year defeated the fast Lincolnton outfit by an 8 to 7 score. Poole pitched a good game for Davidson but was relieved at the beginning of the seventh by Ogden who finished the game in good form. Tom Gheen, a former South Atlantic pitcher, was on the mound for Lincolnton. There were several semi-pro players on the Lincolnton team, and considering the fact that the scrubs had not played together before they did exceptionally well.

The fielding of both teams was excellent. The errors were equally divided, both teams having three chalked up against them. The hitting honors went to C. Beal and Arrowood, four and Arrowood three. The teams as a whole were equally matched, both teams having nine hits when the game ended. Features of the game consisted of a three-base hit by Ed Wilson with three men on, a one-handed stab by McColgan, three two-base hits by C. Beal, and some spectacular base running by Haines.

The score of the golf match with Georgia Tech last week looks pretty bad, but it must be remembered that the Georgia Tech team has some of the ranking amateurs of the country, especially Watts Gunn, and that the local team did mighty well to show up as well as they did against them. Wolfe did unusually well in his afternoon match, outplaying Merriman of the Tech team. McGill was matched against Gunn in the afternoon match, and showed up mighty well, outplaying him at times. His 20-ft. putt on the 11th green was exceptional, equalling Gunn’s 25-ft. shot at the fourth hole.

BOARD OF CONTROL MEMBERS ELECTED
(Continued from page 1)

Professor Williams, popularly known by the students and his friends as “Shorty”, is a well-known and popular member of the Faculty. In the past, Professor Williams has served Davidson as Secretary of the In additionTo the entertainment offered by the Junior Class, all the social fraternities will be having house parties during the week. The advent of the fair sex to the campus at this time marks the beginning of festivities and adds stimulus to the interest shown in the occasion. With the campus overflowing with Alumni, relatives, and guests of the students, the college will present itself in a light far different from that which has appeared in the past three months. Backed by the student body and the faculty, the rising Senior class is eager to give those present the thrill of the year, and everyone is waiting with eager anticipation for the beginning of the program on Friday morning.

The fellows acquitted themselves well and carried out to perfection their designated tasks. Greatly elated over the success of the unit was Dr. Frazer Hood, who spoke as follows: “After the review on Monday, General Williams paid a very high compliment to our unit and congratulated me on being connected with a college that could make so fine a showing. And, I was naturally afraid that on Wednesday for the formal inspection, the unit showed up even better on that occasion than in the former. I thought that the setting up exercises were well gone through with. The review was most excellent; and the band seemed to me to be better than it has been since my connection with the college.”

He has since become a member of the Faculty in the Department of Business Administration and is also Dean of Freshmen. Lingle is very well known, having taken a prominent part in class activities, in Davidsonian and scholastic work. He is Chairman of the Committee on General Arrangements for Junior Speaking and is the retiring Managing Editor of the Davidsonian. Lingle is also well known in golfing circles at Davidson. Bob Kell has served splendidly as president of the Class of ’29 during the year which has just passed. He has also represented his class on the Student Council and is Vice President-elect of the Student Body. Kell is also prominent in athletics, being on the football and track squads. Monroe Gilmore is outstanding in scholastic work, having made the Honor Roll both last year and this year. He is well known and liked by both the students and faculty. The newly elected men went into office at the installation of the Y. M. C. A. officers, which took place last Sunday evening at the Vesper Service in Shearer Hall.

MILITARY INSPECTION (Continued from page 1)
The general department of the students was much better than last year. Colonel Bowen especially commented on the review in the afternoon. Those who witnessed the review agree that the line and marching of the cadets were better than it has ever been. The result of the War Department inspection as to whether Davidson will again be awarded the Distinguished Rating will not be announced until June. Captain Weems, in a further statement, gives a word of appreciation as follows: “I wish to express through The Davidsonian my appreciation of the fine cooperation of the students and faculty in making the work of the year a success. Without the typical Davidson spirit as was shown on this occasion and on all occasions when Davidson competes with other institutions, it would have been impossible to have made as good a showing as we did.” Captain Elkins was in hearty agreement with the remark of Captain R. D. Daughterity that “I feel more confident this year than I did last. Our rating will probably depend on the improvements of the other units undergoing inspection for the honor.” Captain Daughterity added that “The battalion did much better than at any other time I ever saw it. The calisthenics were especially good; and a whole lot of credit is due ‘C’ Company for the interest its members took in the field problem, which I think made quite a hit with the inspectors.” The three officers were high in their praise of the interest and cooperation shown not only by friends and students here but those who made an especial effort in the battalion in the attempt to make the day a real success. Dr. T. W. Lingle expressed himself as follows: “The general impression of those familiar was that the review was the most successful one ever held.”

JUNIORS CONTINUE (Continued from page 1)
Monk Maddox’s wildkittens have shown up fairly well this season, and the game promises to be a close one. Tuesday evening at 7:30, the Y. M. C. A. will sponsor a picture, to be shown in the Gymnasium. The picture engaged is a special one, and as yet the name has not been announced.
