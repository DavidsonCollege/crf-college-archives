**The Doors - L.A. Woman: The final studio album from an incredible band**

By THOMAS CULLEN
Arts & Living Editor

As you can see in Oliver Stone’s movie *The Doors*, Jim Morrison and Ray Manzarek were just two guys until one day, on the beaches of Venice, they decided to start a band. This band was The Doors, and with the addition of Robby Krieger on guitar and John Densmore on drums, they became the staple of innovation throughout the late '60s and early '70s.

The death of Morrison is no shock to anyone who has read about how he lived his life. Based upon what I have read, he was always either drinking or on drugs. Yet, in 1971, the band was collected in the studio for what would be their final studio album. The album was called *L.A. Woman*, and it is their greatest achievement.

The album opens with “The Changeling.” This song is filled with conviction and funk that is typical of The Doors. All of The Doors' songs show that they can sustain musical cohesion while still being vastly complex. “Love Her Madly” is a song that has a bass line to ground the song as well as masterful guitar playing by Krieger. Manzarek’s keyboard playing on this song is absolutely magnificent.

The best song on the album, and possibly in all of music, is “L.A. Woman.” For most fans, the song is incredible even before the words begin, but as soon as Morrison utters the first words, everyone should know that the song is truly in a class by itself. The song shifts from fast to slow with ease and pleasure. As far as what I’ve read, this song was Morrison’s farewell to the city that had given him all that he had ever wanted. He left the city to go to Paris in the summer of 1971, and on July 3, he died, never to see his beloved L.A. again. With that background information on the song, and then listening to it, I find it hard to believe anyone can disagree with my previous claims.

The song entitled “L’America” can turn people off with its title, but once you listen to it, you find that it’s much like “The Unknown Soldier,” with its military drumming and the way it shifts pace. The song is a hidden masterpiece in an album filled with them.

The album closes out with “Riders on the Storm,” and in no way could there be a better song to finish this masterpiece. With its rain effect and soft keyboards, the song lulls one into a mood that only The Doors create. This 7-minute jaunt is the last song on the last album that The Doors ever made.

Jim Morrison is the definition of rock star. He’s better than Axl Rose. He’s better than Keith Richards, and he destroys Kurt Cobain. With music going the way it is today, letting fools like Ricky Martin and Fred Durst achieve fame, another Morrison would surely be welcome. Yet, the mystique that looms around his destructive and ingenious personality is the best thing about him.

**You Can Count on Me tops list of storytelling masterpieces**

Film critic Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times makes a very good point. He says, “Because the act of reviewing is by definition an exercise in arbitrariness, it follows that: (a) the selecting of a 10-best list is arbitrariness squared, and (b) the picking of a top film of the year is arbitrariness refined to such a purity as to be almost meaningless.” Turan then, of course, goes on to partake in these arbitrary acts, and so will I.

Most of the best movies I saw this year were masterpieces of storytelling. The truthful stories of *Almost Famous*, *Traffic*, and *You Can Count on Me* were accessible to everyone. And if the images and styles of *Alone/The Little Thief*, *The Cell*, *Dancer in the Dark*, and *Requiem for a Dream* were too harsh for some, at least their plots and messages were clear and concise for even the most dimwitted of viewers. Also, the beautiful and exhilarating moments of Ang Lee’s *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon* made it one of the best action films I’ve ever seen.

This is not to say that 2000 was without films of the more intellectual variety. *Judy Berlin* and *The Virgin Suicides* challenged us with their haunting narratives and all-too-familiar ideas of sadness in suburban wastelands.

1. The year’s best movie was *You Can Count on Me*, the story of Sammy (Laura Linney, who deserves an Oscar nod) and Terry (Mark Ruffalo, also deserving of an Oscar nomination), siblings who lose their parents early in life. As adults, they have gone their separate ways: Terry travels the country, finding work when and where he can. Sammy, on the other hand, has a son and a decent job at a small bank in the only town in which she has ever lived. The movie documents the pair when Terry pays his sister a visit. *You Can Count on Me* plays more like a documentary than a work of fiction: I could swear there were times when a camera was just dropped in the middle of these people’s lives. Ken Lonergan wrote, directed, and has a small role in what is the most profoundly realistic film I have ever seen. It’s as subtle, random, funny, difficult, satisfying, and open-ended as life itself.

2. Sophia Coppola’s *The Virgin Suicides* is a sometimes funny,Sometimes eerie, sometimes frightening, this film is about infatuation, being an adolescent boy, discovering sexuality, and our inherent obsession with understanding. It’s not about the five beautiful Lisbon girls and their suicides. It’s about a community’s fascination—both sexual and intellectual—with the girls and their actions. Kathleen Turner and James Woods are chilling as the girls’ misguided parents in this gloomy, dare I say accurate, portrait of suburbia.

3. Lars Von Trier’s "Dancer in the Dark" stars Björk as Selma, an immigrant struggling to make money for her son’s operation. Few movies take as many emotional and creative risks as "Dancer in the Dark" and its star do. Björk’s performance is one of the best I have seen in one of the most original films of recent years. "Dancer in the Dark" is manipulative and bizarre, but it’s manipulative and bizarre in good ways. Not everyone agreed: "Dancer in the Dark" polarized viewers as drastically as "Magnolia" and "A Clockwork Orange" did. Regardless of your opinion, "Dancer in the Dark" is unquestionably unforgettable.

4. Darren Aronofsky’s follow-up to "Pi" is the ruthless "Requiem for a Dream," an uncommonly subjective look at drug abuse. "Requiem for a Dream" is a masterwork of style: its colors, cinematography, images, and soundtrack attack our eyes and ears and, ultimately, our sense of decency. Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans star as drug addicts on their paths to destruction in what Roger Ebert accurately called “a travelogue of hell.” Burstyn and Connelly deserve Oscars for their daring performances.

5. "Traffic" is an exceptionally relevant film about our country’s multi-faceted drug problem. Separate, loosely connected stories examine several aspects of the situation from Mexican drug cartels, to the newly appointed drug czar of the United States, to his addict daughter, to a wealthy Californian drug lord. "Traffic" is superbly acted, particularly by Benicio del Toro as an honest Mexican cop. Even more impressive is Soderbergh’s direction, which is restrained and matter-of-fact, allowing his film’s ideas to take precedence over the action and storylines.

6. "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" is one of the best action movies ever made for two simple reasons. First, at the heart of the movie is a compelling and well-told love story involving obsession and revenge. Second, the film uses its action not as the attraction, but as important plot points. The result is a breathtaking film of beautiful landscapes, costumes, and fight scenes. Ang Lee, who also made "Sense and Sensibility" and the melancholy masterpiece "The Ice Storm," again proves his versatility as a director.

7. "Alone" and "The Little Thief" are two absorbing short films made by Erick Zonca, the director of last year’s brilliant "The Dreamlife of Angels." The 34-minute short "Alone" was made two years ago, but played in this country along with the 65-minute "The Little Thief" this year. "Alone" follows a young woman as she first loses her job, then her home, and ultimately her freedom. "The Little Thief" stars Nicolas Duvauchelle as a young man who gets seduced into an organized crime ring. While both films differ in subject and style, they both document how easy it is to be pulled into a life of crime and desperation.

8. Watching "The Cell" was one of the most visually exciting experiences I’ve had in a movie theater. Director Tarsem Singh’s mental landscapes are captivating, as is Mark Protosevich’s script, which seamlessly combines three stories that intersect for an exciting closing act. Jennifer Lopez gives a wonderful, restrained performance as Catherine Deane, a skilled psychiatrist who enters the mind of a killer to solve a kidnapping.

9. Few films are as eerily cheerful as Eric Mendelsohn’s "Judy Berlin," a meditation on missed opportunities and second chances told through a number of interlocking stories in Babylon, Long Island. The merrily apocalyptic atmosphere that Mendelsohn creates is one of the most unique places to which a movie has taken me. The characters include a teacher and principal who share a secret affection for one another, a struggling filmmaker, a ditzy housewife, and an aspiring actress, Judy Berlin, played excellently by Edie Falco of "The Sopranos."

10. In my review of "Almost Famous," I said, “Almost Famous is flawless: there is not a moment in the movie that is out of place, not a performance that is miscalculated, not a scene that is boring, and not a joke that isn’t funny.” Cameron Crowe’s autobiographical, coming-of-age movie is triumphant in its broad appeal. This is a movie that anyone can watch and enjoy, if not love.

I have chosen five runners-up to my ten-best list. In alphabetical order, they are as follows: Billy Bob Thornton’s "All the Pretty Horses"; Majid Majidi’s spiritual "The Color of Paradise"; "Into the Arms of Strangers: Stories of the Kindertransport"; Robert Redford’s "The Legend of Bagger Vance"; and the weirdly hilarious and intimate Curtis Hanson film "Wonder Boys."

On a final note, I’d like to mention "Chuck and Buck," Miguel Arteta’s story about childhood friends, Chuck and Buck, who meet up as adults. Chuck has become successful in the music industry; Buck is still a child. No other movie this year, not even "Requiem for a Dream" with its graphic ending, disturbed and challenged me as much as "Chuck and Buck" did, which I think is a testament to its script and strong acting. I mention the film because I think it is on to something. I’m just not sure what.
