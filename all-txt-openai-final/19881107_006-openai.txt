**From MORE HABITAT, page 5:**

Box 3A-C should be your third choice in the case that your first primary is full and the first alternate-second
primary is not filled. Preferred in the case that both primaries are full, but both filled with the engage. This
is worse than a box reform!

Other things: As far as the building of it goes, as people get more experience as houses go along, it
will probably go faster on down the line. Osborne says that the biggest difference between a typical house construction and
one for Habitat for Humanity is the larger number of different people and greater length of commitment involved in a
Habitat project.

Religion professor Alexander McKelway refrained from cutting sheetrock long enough to explain that working for Habitat is "no great sacrifice
because it's sort of fun to do. But it's nice that you can do this sort of thing and help
other people out and I think a lot of people feel that way."

Rabbi Hunting non-credit class belongs in column D5. "History of the Roman Novel" isn't going to get rid of the
core for English. Well, at least I got my first two choices down.

The second house of the development, say, will have more room. It'll be better. His younger sister Sophia takes a
slightly different view of the situation: "I'm going to have a pool in the backyard," she visualizes. "I'm going to
get a sarong. I'm getting a..."

Their brother extends his view: "I get to have my room by myself, me and my brother. We get to
play our radio loud!"
