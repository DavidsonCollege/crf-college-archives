10—The Davidsonian—March 28, 1980

### Sports Scripts

#### Women’s Track

Lynchburg College blasted Davidson’s women’s track team 80-47 this past Saturday in a dual meet run in conjunction with the
men’s meet.

Several strong individual performances were registered by Wildcattes, however. Freshman Mike Frankhouser took firsts in the shot put and discus
while sophomore P.J. Whitlock also garnered two firsts, in the 100 and 200 meter events. Susan Davidson paced the team
with three first place finishes at 800, 1500, and 3000 meters. Her 1500 and 3000 meter times shattered Davidson school
records.

Second place finishes were recorded by Burkley Manni in the high jump and Beth Davidson in the 3000 meters. Mann
took third in the 100 meter hurdles while Diane Downing finished likewise in the 400 meter hurdles event. — VAN

#### Women’s Soccer

The Davidson Women’s Soccer Club split two matches this past weekend in its second outing of the season. The A
team nipped Fayetteville Community Women's Team 5-4 but Davidson's B team was defeated 2-0 by a community team from Charlotte.

Sophomore Heather McCormack booted in two goals to pace the Wildcattes in the A team match. Joanna Fleming, Susan Davidson,
and Carolyn Scott each added a single tally to round out the scoring for Davidson. Fayetteville could field only 9
players while the Cattes competed with the regular number, ten.

In B team action the Cattes were stifled by an older Charlotte team on the offensive end and could never
quite mount a penetrating attack. — VAN BECK

#### Men's Track

The Wildcat trackmen rolled over Lynchburg College last Saturday in a non-conference meet, 99-63. The team was led by stars
Dick Jones and Lance Sisco, who had multiple wins in the field events, sprints, and relays. The weight men, led
by Dave Nichols, Ray Sinclair, and Mike Heinig, took 9 out of 11 places to bolster the Davidson cause. The
distance crew balanced things out with wins in the 1500m and 800m by John Hoots and Robert Frierson, respectively, and
a strong second place finish by Greg Burnard in the 5000 meters. Coach Karl Kremser had expected a close meet
and was pleased with the victory, noting that all team members gave 100% effort in the meet as a result
of their dedication in practice. The Cats will be away on Saturday at the Western Carolina Relays. — JOHN HOOTS

#### Men’s Tennis

“With the nationally ranked teams behind us (except University of South Carolina), we have now been able to build up
the confidence in ourselves and confidence as a team,” said Jay “Moose” Gepfert after the Men’s Tennis Team won very
decisive victories over Massachusetts Institute of Technology 9-0 and Ohio University 5-4.

The Cats, now 4-4, started out rough but are now picking up the slack. Beside the outstanding strengths of senior
Harry Griffith at the number one position and Jay Gepfert at the number two position, the Cats are getting outstanding
performances from the other players. Two specifically mentioned were Nevins Todd and Rick Johnston. Of Todd, Gepfert said, “With the
way Nevins is playing, I’m glad I play on court two rather than court three against him,” and of Rick
Johnston, Harry Griffith remarked, “The addition of Ricky has brought stability and leadership to the team, and now is the
time we will need him most.”

Davidson has a great opportunity to do well again this year in the Southern Conference Championships. Harry Griffith, who finished
second last year, has a chance to take it all in both singles and doubles with Gepfert. When asked about
Davidson’s chances in the Southern Conference, Todd commented, “With ‘WH’ Griffith and Moose Gepfert playing well at one and two,
and the rest of the team beginning to assert itself, I think we have a great chance.” And, in fact,
these chances keep Coach Jeff Frank “Rapping Delightfully.” — JOE FORD
