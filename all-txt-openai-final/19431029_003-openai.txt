Eileen Farrell, soprano. Other artists in the series will be Miss Carroll Glenn, violinist, appearing on December 7; Egon Petri,
pianist, on February 7; and the Nine O'Clock Opera Group, which will present “The Merry Wives of Windsor” on March

First Concert

Miss Farrell, whose appearance will open the series, has risen to fame in an almost unbelievably short time. Her parents
were singers, and starting from this background her progressive steps to prominence followed rapidly. Following a successful audition with the
Columbia Broadcasting System, Miss Farrell was featured with Howard Barlow and the CBS Symphony and has, for the past year,
appeared regularly over this network.

Davidson Library has recently added a number of nonfiction books of pertinent interest to all students, according to Dr. Chalmers,
Davidson librarian. Most of these deal with the war and national outlook. Walter Lippmann in his U.S. Foreign Policy uses
his thirty years as a newspaper man to point out the inexpediency of our present foreign policy. He shows that
the United States cannot continue to make foreign commitments without a well-formulated foreign policy or the force to back them
up. Eve Curie’s position as a citizen of the world has enabled her to make Journey Among Warriors one of
the finest surveys that has come out of this war. Not only does she give a picture of the front
lines at home and on the battlefields but an understanding of the people who are behind the man behind the
gun.
