8—The Davidsonian—March 13, 1981

Nick’s Flicks

Beginning their spring term schedule next Tuesday, the Fine Films Committee shows the Marx Brothers classic *A Night at the
Opera*. To anybody already familiar with this, any further comment on my part is really superfluous: the most consistently inventive
and hilarious of all their films, it was made in their best period after they had shuffled off the restrictions
of their Broadway experience and before they were cast in musicals which entirely subordinated their comic talents to third-rate song-and-dance
routines. The actual details of the plot are similarly irrelevant—I’ve seen the film several times and still can’t remember what
is supposed to be happening—the important things to watch for are routines like Groucho and Chico discussing a theatrical contract
and finally coming to the conclusion that only children believe in a Sanity Clause. Love Auditorium ought to be packed
to bursting next Tuesday at 8.

Earlier, Pop Films open their season on Friday night with last term’s delayed feature *Coming Home* starring Jane Fonda and
John Voight. The first film to recognize the commercial appeal of the Vietnam war, it picked up Oscars left and
right when first released: quite justifiably so, too: Voight is marvelous as the crippled veteran, although Fonda’s alleged commitment to
the concerned flirts dangerously with the twin pitfalls of triteness and exploitation. Is anybody out there preparing a *Hostages Coming
Home* movie?

The discerning Davidson cinephile, however, should arrange to see the second showing of *Coming Home*, for preceding it at 8
p.m. in Chambers gallery is a showing of a film by Art Professor Emeritus Douglas Houchens. Early reports from the
Art Department and the English Faculty suggest that this should not be missed. Essentially the film, called *The Movie*, is
a highly personal record of memories and images accreted during a lifetime of artistic production. Dealing with Houchens, his family
and close friends, it comprises a series of discrete sections of images of importance and worth to the filmmaker. For
an outside audience, these images are validated by their associations and juxtaposition in the film itself, although the subjects with
which they ultimately deal are of universal importance: the process of growing old, memory, the spurs to creativity. Taking its
cue at least partially from Dylan’s dictum that “a man has only to open his eyes to be influenced,” the
film should be a unique and fascinating testament of the inner life and vision behind the paintings currently on show
in the gallery. *The Movie* should not be missed by anyone professing an interest in the pictorial or cinematic arts.

University of Michigan professor teaches comparative world views

Cohen enlivens philosophy for 600 students

By JOHN KROTCHKO
Features Editor

Reading Philosophy Professor Carl Cohen’s work and meeting him face-to-face are two entirely different experiences. His cool, rational prose betrays
little of his dynamic, almost explosive personality. But his curiously disheveled hair, wide, groping eyes, and wildly expressive hands suggest—even
before his first words affirm...Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

It—that he is no ordinary professor. Davidson is lucky to have him for a term of teaching, debate, and dialogue.
It’s easy (but incorrect) to mistake Cohen's charismatic enthusiasm for a mild touch of chaos. He talks fast. He smiles
a lot. He jumps up. He asks questions of people who are questioning him. When the Philosophy Department, with the
help of Vice President for Academic Affairs Price Zimmermann, offered Cohen an opportunity to teach a class of about two
hundred at Davidson through funding by the Mellon Foundation, he accepted the offer and agreed to teach two other courses
as well. Philosophy Professor Earl MacCormac noted that he was “very enthusiastic” about having more contact with undergraduates. Cohen’s class
of two hundred now numbers closer to six hundred. Entitled “Communism, Fascism and Democracy” (and using his book of the
same title as its text), its large size is unprecedented. Cohen, who teaches at the University of Michigan at Ann
Arbor, has been to Davidson before, both as a Reynolds lecturer and in a debate over the Bakke reverse discrimination
case. The interest he generated then remained strong enough to influence so many students to enroll in his class this
Spring. “I’m interested in what the good students” like, MacCormac explained, and the good students were as enthusiastic about Cohen
as he was about them. The Philosophy Department, the administration, and Cohen all felt the class “should have no ceiling.”
Scheduled at 10 a.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays in Love Auditorium, it is open to anyone interested in attending. Cohen’s
aim in the course is “...to develop a penetrating grasp of what communism, fascism and democracy are...” He will concentrate
on political philosophies and their intellectual proponents because these “set the tone for how we think about actual governments.” Cohen
spent the first class last Tuesday organizing and warning his students of his idiosyncrasies. Reflecting the first impressions of every
student interviewed, sophomore Tom Roth commented, “He is constantly in motion.” An extra class period per week has been scheduled
on Wednesday for further reflection on the material. “I want to give students an opportunity to get back at me,”
Cohen explained. In a class of that size, it will be no small challenge. “I cannot refrain from passing judgments,”
Cohen said. His essays and books reveal his outspokenness on contemporary issues. Of particular note is an essay concerning the
famous Skokie case. In April 1977, a Nazi group fought for the right to stage a rally in Skokie, a
predominantly Jewish suburb of Chicago. Cohen, a Jew and also, at the time, an active member of the American Civil
Liberties Union (which supported the Nazis), published an essay on “The Right to be Offensive” (The Nation, April 15, 1978),
an elegant, dialectical defense of the Nazis’ claim to freedom of speech. “If the history of struggles to defend the
freedom of thought and expression teaches anything,” he wrote, “it teaches this: that persons or parties must not be silenced
because of the moral qualities their views are assumed to have.” Other topics Cohen has treated include racism and limits
on recombinant DNA research. Cohen’s views on democracy will be aired Monday in the first of a series of lectures
and discussions coming up in the Center for Special Studies’ First Annual Ethics Institute (see Back Page for details). “Communism,
Fascism and Democracy” is a main course in the fascinating smorgasbord of special learning opportunities offered at Davidson this Spring.
Any opportunity to pick the brain of the explosive, eloquent, and genuinely friendly Dr. Carl Cohen should be taken eagerly.
