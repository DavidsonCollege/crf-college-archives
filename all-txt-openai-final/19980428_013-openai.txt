DSS AWARDS

Most Valuable
Jason Lina

His performance at the Southern Conference Tournament was the icing on the cake. Lina was consistently the best golfer on
the squad throughout the season. He showed his importance at the tournament when he birdied the final three holes of
the last round to lift the team from seventh to fourth place.

Lina led the team this season in average strokes per round with a 74.1 average in 28 rounds. This fall
he also shot a career-best round of 69. He had the best finish among Davidson golfers in three of the
six tournaments in which the team competed this spring. He was the second-best Wildcat golfer in the other three tournaments.

His incredible accuracy is one of his best weapons. This season, Lina ranked third in the nation in fairways hit
with a percentage of .850.

Lina has improved steadily since his rookie season at Davidson. In his sophomore year, he averaged 79.2 strokes in 11
rounds and had a low of 77.

The following season his average improved to 77.9, which was the third-best average on the team. His season low of
73 was a career best which he broke this fall.

His average improved this season by almost four strokes and was the best average among all Wildcat golfers.

Lina’s solid performance in the early rounds of the conference tournament and his incredible final round of 70 gave him
the third-best score out of over 50 golfers in the tournament.

Most Improved
Andy McDaniel

McDaniel has been a major factor on the team since his rookie year. As a rookie, he led the Wildcats
with an average of 80.3 strokes per round in 14 rounds and had a season low of 76.

Mike Hood

Senior Jason Lina is seen here taking a bunker shot, which he does not need to do frequently. Blessed with
extremely good shot accuracy, Lina’s fairways hit percentage was third in the nation.

Golf

TUESDAY, MARCH 24, 1998

The following season his average improved to 78.2. It is a testament to the team’s improvement that his average ranked
third on the team. Following a season in which no Davidson golfer averaged better than 80 strokes per round, the
1995-96 squad had five golfers averaging below 80, including two sophomores (Lina and McDaniel) and one rookie (Dave Alexander).

In the 96-97 year, the team remained strong with five golfers averaging better than 80, but McDaniel’s performance fell drastically.
After going abroad for a semester, he played only six rounds in the season. His average fell eight strokes from
the previous season to a dismal 86.2, the second lowest on the roster.

McDaniel’s rebound from his junior-year slump has been impressive. His average improved by over eight strokes from last season. In
18 rounds this season, he has averaged 77.9 strokes per round, the best in any of the four seasons he
has had at Davidson. He also shot a career-best 72 in the second round of the Pepsi Intercollegiate Tournament at
Eastern Carolina. McDaniel managed to come back from a disappointing junior season to regain and even surpass his sophomore-year form.

Best Rookie
Austin Zeigler

From day one the rookies have been a major part of the Wildcat squad. The team entered three rookies (Zeigler,
Sean Davidson, and Scott Shupe) in tournaments this spring.

Zeigler and Davidson were both among the six Davidson golfers to average better than 80 strokes per round this season.
Zeigler excelled among the freshman class by posting a season average of 77.4, which was the third best on the
team behind upperclassmen Lina and Alexander.

He played in all six tournaments that the Wildcats entered this spring and was one of the top three Davidson
golfers in five of them. In the Birkdale Collegiate Classic in March, Zeigler had the best score of the five
Wildcats in the tournament. He shot 74-80-77-231 over two days to lead the team, beating Lina and Alexander by one
stroke.

Next season, Lina and McDaniel will have graduated, leaving only two of Davidson’s top four golfers from this year. If
Zeigler can improve his average from this season by a few strokes, he has the potential to lead the team
and finish in the top ten at the Southern Conference Tournament.

Surprise your college kids or campus chums with an ice cream or frozen yogurt cake for birthday or graduation celebrations,
study breaks, exam time, or just for fun!
