The DAVIDSONIAN, January 15, 1919

ALUMNI NEWS.

Lieut. Lawrence M. Fetner, ex-'11 of Charlotte, N.C., who has been overseas in the medical corps, has been slightly wounded.

Dr. Thomas W. Lingle has been asked by the Paris headquarters of French Y.M.C.A. work to make a lecture trip in the French army, making addresses on American political, social, economic, educational, and religious life and ideals, that the French soldiers may learn more of the American people and may imbibe our best ideals. Dr. Lingle, formerly Professor of Modern Languages at Davidson, enlisted in the Y.M.C.A. work when America entered the war. From late in 1917 until October 1, 1918, he was stationed with French troops around Verdun, where some of the most intense fighting of the war was staged. He spent his furlough month of October 1918, among American troops in Alsace. Several returning Davidson men from overseas have seen Dr. Lingle and report that he has been doing a splendid work.

William B. Davidson, ex-'11, of Chester, S.C., has been wounded overseas.

Capt. I.C. Boyd, '13, spent Saturday on the Hill. He has been teaching at Kinston, N.C.

Frank W. Price, '15, spent January 3 and 4 in Davidson en route to New York, where he will sail to France to work among Chinese coolies there under the Y.M.C.A. auspices. Frank is well known among Davidson alumni and friends. He was an intercollegiate debater, "honor" man, Y.M.C.A. president, a leader in every phase of college activity. Through his efforts, the Y.M.C.A. became what it had never before meant on the campus. And to a large degree, he was the founder, as well as the first editor, of The Davidsonian six years ago. For the past three years, he has been engaged in Y.M.C.A. work in China. Frank expects to return and begin his seminary course next fall.

Alex Sprunt, Jr., ex-'18, spent a few days on the Hill the past week with his brother.

Rev. W.C. Williams, of Charlestown, W.Va., ex-'14, was married recently to Miss Laura Allene Doyle, of Valley Centre, W.Va.

Rev. C.A. Raymond, ex-'13, of Holly Springs, Miss., and Miss Dorothy Barr, of Meridian, Miss., were married on November 6. Mr. Raymond has been in Army Y.M.C.A. work for the past months.

LETTER FROM MR. PARKER.
(Continued from page 1)

...shows a fine spirit, though he has not decided to believe. I have given him a Korean New Testament for which he could not thank me enough. The college boy has not been so shy of me since I talked with him once, but he has not come to a realization of his sin in cheating. Keep on praying for both of these boys. This will probably...be the last word I get to you before Christmas, so I will send my greetings for that time now. May this Christmas see peace upon the world, and may it bring the greatest blessing to each and every one of you. I have heard what a hard time you have been having there with the influenza this fall, and I do sympathize with you, and trust that the sickness soon left you entirely. With all best wishes, I am, as ever, Yours in His service, Wm. P. Parker. Pyengyang, Korea. Nov. 12, 1918.

Would you like to have a “stand-in” with the professor? Then study the following commandments:
1. Register late. This enables the class to review the work covered before you arrived.
2. Be absent from class frequently and avoid making an explanation. This keeps the professor thinking.
3. Be tardy when possible. This furnishes something for those to look at who are not interested in the subject under discussion.
4. Misunderstand the assignments. This enables you to entertain the professor with explanations.
5. Be unprepared often. This enables the professor to entertain himself by doing the reciting.
6. Yawn. The professor enjoys looking at the opening with a rim of face around it.
7. When you can't yawn, look at your watch. This makes it evident that time hangs heavily on your hands.
8. When you can no longer look your watch in the face, look bored. This inspires the professors greatly.
9. Avoid handing in parallel on time. This enables the professor to occupy his spare time with more golf and less work.
10. Should you happen to be given less than 90 for an average standing, appear surprised and wonder why. This helps the professor remember you.
