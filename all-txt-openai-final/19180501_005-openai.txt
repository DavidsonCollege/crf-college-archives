LIBERTY LOAN SUBSCRIBED

In the Third Liberty Loan, the Davidson people are again gallantly defending democracy with their dollars. $7,350 worth of bonds
of the assigned $9,100 have been subscribed up to 12 o'clock Saturday, the 27th. In one day recently, $2,200 worth
were sold. There is one week left to reach and surpass the appointed goal. In the last loan, $16,550 were
subscribed, which was about 20 percent above the Davidson allotment. With a strong rally in these last days left to
this loan, another over-subscription ought to be made. W. S. S. are also being sold in good quantities. Some $6,500
worth of them have been sold by the local post office.

NEW REFERENCE WORK IN THE CARNEGIE LIBRARY

The second edition of the “New International Encyclopedia” containing 24 volumes has recently been added to the number of books
in the library. The first edition was published in 1902-4. World progress and the many changes in the last ten
years have made it necessary for the entire text to be rewritten. Some of the new features are the use
of the single alphabet, the arrangement of subjects under titles to which the reader would naturally turn, an inclusive title
list, and a full and practicable bibliography for all important subjects. This encyclopedia is a splendid addition to the reference
works of the library.

DECLAMATION CONTEST IS HELD IN EU SOCIETY

The Fresh-Soph declamation contest of the Eumenean Society was held last Friday night, April 26. The medal, which is offered
annually to the best declaimer, was awarded to W. B. Sullivan, of the Sophomore class. The judges were Dr. Richards
and Professors Reed and Wood. Nine men entered the contest—six Sophs and three Freshmen. C. A. McGirt gave “Loyalty to
Country;” Wm. Love gave “Tennessee's Partner;” C. G. Matthews gave President Wilson's “Baltimore Speech;” A. M. Mitchell gave Senator Breckenridge’s
“The March of the Flags;” R. R. Craig gave President Wilson’s “Flag Day Address;” W. B. Sullivan gave “America's Uncrowned
Queen;” R. T. L. Liston gave Senator Taylor's “Address to Old Confederates;” J. R. Boulware, Jr. gave “Address to the
French Mission;” W. P. Cumming gave “Experiences of a Japanese College Boy in the United States.”

DR. ARBUCKLE HONORED AGAIN BY N.C. CHEMISTS

At a joint meeting of the North Carolina Academy of Science and the State division of the American Chemical Society,
at the State Normal College, Dr. E. W. Gudger, professor of biology at the Normal, was elected president. Dr. H.
B. Arbuckle, the retiring president, was elected vice-president. Another Davidson man, Dr. W. A. Withers, '83, professor at North Carolina
State College, was president preceding Dr. Arbuckle. Davidson men hold a preeminent position in academic and scientific circles. The meeting
was Friday and Saturday. Some features of the interesting program were scientific papers by Prof. C. Cobb, on “Mineral Fertilizers;”
“New and Interesting North Carolina Fungi,” by H. C. Beardslee; C. S. Brimlee discussed the “cold-blooded vertebrates apart from the
pisces species.” Dr. Gudger gave some interesting botanicalobservations.

NEW STUDENT COMMITTEES

The heads of the committees to secure new students for next year have been hard at work, with the students
cooperating with them to some extent. However, a great many have done nothing at all. It is desired that everyone
in college get to work and make this plan a success from the start. The leaders wish to get a
list of the names of possible students for next year. Any names handed in to the committees will be appreciated.

SENIORS TO HOLD BANQUET.

The Seniors will not be outdone. They did not have a Soph Banquet, but they are establishing a precedent in
that they are going to hold a Senior Banquet. This will be held just before commencement. At a class meeting,
the purpose was expressed to have a good old get-together meeting with lots of class spirit and good things to
eat. The committee having this in charge is composed of J. L. Fowle, chairman, D. M. Orgain, R. H. Stone,
and W. M. Fountain.
