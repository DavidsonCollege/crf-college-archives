FRIDAY, OCTOBER 4, 1957

Treasurer Named; Class Veep Sought

The offices of treasurer of the YMCA and vice president of the Junior Class were left vacant by students not returning to Davidson this year. Bobby Livingstone, sophomore, was appointed treasurer by the executive council of the YMCA last Tuesday night at a called meeting. Bobby, a Baker scholar, is also Sophomore Class representative and a member of ATO fraternity. Livingstone, who is also active on the “effective citizenship post” of the “Y”, was chosen to fill the vacancy left by Jock Reeder, who entered Yale this fall. Livingstone’s appointment came naturally as he has served as assistant to the treasurer and was runner-up in the treasurer election last spring.

The office of Junior Class vice president, vacated by Tom Johnson, who has left college to enter the armed services, has not been filled. According to the student government constitution, a class meeting calling for nominations to fill this office must take place. Plans have been set by Roy Gilbert, class president, with Friday, October 11, as the date for nominations. At a special meeting of class members, election procedures were mapped out.

A talk on the fraternity itself by Gary Maynard, president of the chapter, will highlight the luncheon. After the luncheon, the parents and members of the fraternity will attend the Davidson-Citadel football game as a group. The fraternity will hold open house in the morning and in the afternoon after the game. The purpose of the event is to acquaint the parents with the fraternity and with each other. Between 150 and 200 parents and relatives are expected.

Union Sponsors Travel Day

Mr. John D. Frost and Miss Betty Phiffer, world travel consultants for The Carolina Motor Club of Charlotte, will visit the Davidson campus on October 9th to direct a travel day. The program is being sponsored by the Student Union. In an interview earlier this week, Frost explained that the purpose of the day was to give the student body an opportunity to discuss travel plans for future jaunts to Europe or other areas outside the United States. Frost is well qualified as a consultant, having traveled extensively in Europe, South and Central America, and the Pacific. Miss Phiffer has just returned from a trip to Germany, Switzerland, and France.

Changes may be made up to November 1, provided that both fraternities involved agree to the proposed change. For the present time, one house will remain unoccupied. Particular variations in the exterior of the houses have been chosen by the architects in regard to elevation of the lot and general symmetry in the appearance of the entire court.Sgt. J. P.

PLEASED WITH NEW GROWTH
Miss Mayhew Joins Library

Miss Mary Elizabeth Mayhew has accepted the position of Order Librarian in the Davidson Library. As such, she serves the faculty in any possible way in supplying by ordering, if necessary, the books that they need and want.

This capacity includes frequent duty at the checking out desk.

Miss Mayhew comes from Mooresville, North Carolina, where she has been a teacher of English for the past ten years. Previous to that she taught in the schools of Rowan, Iredell, and Nash counties.

She is a graduate of Lenoir-Rhyne College in Hickory, North Carolina. At present, she is studying toward her master’s degree in library science. Her work is in affiliation with Appalachian State Teachers College in Boone, North Carolina.

When asked her opinion of the Davidson Library, Miss Mayhew replied, “I am very, very pleased and actually amazed at the way in which it is growing.”

To the question, “Do you believe that it fills the needs of Davidson College?” she answered, “Yes, I do, in observations that I have made so far.”

As to her opinion of Davidson, Miss Mayhew tells us, “I certainly do like campus life here and find the students and faculty members most friendly. I just hope that I can serve them in fulfilling their library needs, and I hope that they will call on me to do so.”
