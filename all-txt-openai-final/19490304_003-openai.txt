As we write this, the Wildcat basketeers are preparing to leave for the Southern Conference tournament for the second straight year. However, by the time it is read, the semi-finals of the family scrap will be history and possibly the final fracas, too. In light of that, it would not be appropriate for us to speculate on the Cats’ chances in the tourney. Suffice it to say that the powers that be were friendly to old DD when they dealt the pairings for the affair. However, many Wildcat supporters and the team itself looked forward to another crack at Coy Carson and company, a very unlikely feat since the White Phantoms are bracketed with N.C. State, the top-heavy favorite to repeat as champs for the third year in a row.

Coach Norman Shepard has gone a long way this season in developing a squad which could have a strong argument in claiming the title of Davidson's outstanding all-time basketball team. Of course, there are many who will be all over us for making such a statement. They will immediately point to the 1942 and 1943 teams which boasted the great Tommy Peters. Not having seen either one of these teams in action, we may not be a qualified judge. But our argument is that Tommy Peters must have been some ball player to be rated above either Buddy Cheek or Mike Williams. The well-rounded squad which “the Brain” has tutored this season has not produced any one player who outshines the rest. Besides the aforementioned two, who have served as co-captains for the second year, they are joined by Whit Cobb to form a trio which any coach would want. Cobb’s brilliance as a floorman cannot be disputed by anyone who has seen him play. His set shot from the outer court is one of the surest we've seen. Whit's selection by the Big Five mentors for a second team berth on the All-State five bears out any praise given him.

In plugging this year’s squad as an all-time great, we may point to the calibre of competition which the postwar cage world has produced. Certainly, the opposition thrown at the 1948-49 Davidson Wildcats was not as trying as that which recent clubs have faced. We vote for the current edition of the Wildcats as the all-time Davidson team.

W & M Dumps Cats For Tourney
Frosh End Season
Cagers Win Two; Lose To S. C.
By BILL BUCKE
By GORDON SCOTT

The freshman basketball squad brought one of the best seasons in its history to a close with a 57-48 win over CCUNC. Osborne and Tom Coleman vied for scoring honors among the Kittens with 12 points each, while Brooks and Lazenby followed close behind with 10 points respectively. Proctor for CCUNC was once again the mainstay of his team as he dropped in 24 counters, which was exactly half of the squad’s aggregate score.

With the frosh moving up to fill the varsity positions that will be vacated this year by graduating seniors, it looks like next year’s Red and Black five will stage a repeat performance of this season's fine showing.

South Carolina last week avenged an early tournament bid by disarming the Cats by a surprisingly 69-53 margin, thus ensuring themselves a bid to the post-season tournament. Brady and Lucas paced the fired-up Gamecocks as they pumped in a total of 34 points, the highest total scored by any player the Wildcats have faced this year. Towering Jim’s 34 points bettered the 27 he posted in the previous meeting of the teams.

The game was pretty much U.S.C. all the way with the exception of one brief instance in the early moments of the game when the visiting Davidsons managed to go out in front, 10-9. South Carolina quickly regained the upper hand and kept it through the remainder of the contest. Mike Williams, with 15 points, turned in top scoring honors for the fine losers and was followed by Buddy Cheek and Whit Cobb who had 13 and 9 points respectively.

In their final game of the regular season, Davidson turned back The Citadel, 50-42, in a game played in the Citadel gymnasium at Charleston last Saturday night. The Cats were in front at halftime, 32-21; and taking an early lead, they were never in serious trouble during the second half. With Coach Shepard rotating reserves frequently, the Bulldogs slightly outscored Davidson in the second half, 21-18. Davidson's one-two-three scoring punch of Williams, Cheek, and Cobb engineered the win with 13 points each. For the losers, Stroman and Duckworth each posted nine points.
