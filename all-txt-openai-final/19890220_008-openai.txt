and answers phones. With all this, her only complaint is not surprising. “This job is a big time commitment,” Loving
said. “I do not get to study.”

Theatre department: Angela Simms, junior, works for Dr. Barber. Both she and Dr. Barber were largely responsible for the success
of the sesquicentennial activities during the last academic year. Her duties include typing, organizing mailers, answering the phones, xeroxing flyers,
and handling ticket sales for the plays. She also gives slide shows at the visitors center. One of the things
she likes best is “getting to know the other sides of a professor. Working closely with Dr. Barber has enabled
me to really know him.”

Lake Campus: Senior John Freeman and junior Ian Prime are in charge of running the college's lake campus. “We take
care of all the boats and docks, lock and unlock everything, rent boats, run sailing classes, and are in charge
of security,” said Prime. The lake campus is almost totally student-run, and during the warm weather is open 2-5 M-F
and 1-5 Sat/Sun. Both Prime and Freeman came to Davidson with extensive knowledge of and experience in sailing. Freshman David
McPherson mans the “hot line” at the Union Desk.

THE DAVIDSONIAN
By JENNIFER HOFFMAN

From the library to the lake campus, Davidson College employs approximately 275 students through its work-study program. This year, Paul
Marciano, a 1988 Davidson graduate, has been hired as an associate in the human resources department to recommend improvements in
the program.

Work-study jobs are offered to students as a portion of their financial aid packages. Federal money funds 80 percent of
these jobs, while the college pays for the other 20 percent. Under Davidson’s present system, all jobs pay the federal
$3.35 minimum wage. According to Marciano, however, Davidson is behind the times. “I don’t know of another school that pays
$3.35 across the board,” he said. “The time has come for a more equitable system.”

“We don’t want to reinvent the wheel,” he said. “There are a lot of good programs out there.” Publications: Rob
Gardner, dean of admissions and financial aid, and Gordon Peck, associate dean of financial aid, presently employ a system of
“team captains” in their offices. These upperclassmen take responsibility and answer phones. With all this, her only complaint is not
surprising. “This job is a big time commitment,” Loving said. “I do not get to study.”

“We don’t want to reinvent the wheel,” he said. “There are a lot of good programs out there.” Publications: Rob
Gardner, dean of admissions and financial aid, and Gordon Peck, associate dean of financial aid, presently employ a system of
“team captains” in their offices. These upperclassmen take responsibility and oversee other students. Marciano cited College Union Director William Brown
and Director of Auxiliary Services Carleton Pritchard as models of efficient managers. Brown and Pritchard rely on systems of students
overseeing students. Pritchard’s student employees, however, are not hired through the work-study program. Students hired to work in the Commons
are currently paid on a sliding scale starting at $3.90/hour to work on the serving line. Most work 10 to
12 hours per week, with 15 hours being the present ceiling, Marciano said. Most students do not work their total
allotted hours. According to Peck, the average student on the present system works only about 10 to 12 hours per
week.70 percent of the hours he or she is at work, Marciano envisions even PEEVES, from page 5. You mingle
with classmates with whom you have never spoken. You dance, you mingle, you dance, you mingle, you dance, you get
hot and go out for some air. Then he kisses you. In that split-second before it happens you think, “Should
I?” You respond to the question as soon as it’s asked by “kissing back.” You are attracted to this boy
since the first day. You like to kiss since the first time. So why that little question? Why the hesitation?
BECAUSE YOU’VE BEEN THROUGH ALL THIS BEFORE, THAT’S WHY. Because you’re a little afraid to like a Davidson guy. As
you walk to “somewhere private” you wage war with the little voice in your head:

Little Voice: “Where is all this leading? He’s going to think you’re easy. The first date? Your mother would die
if she...”

Self: “Shut up, I like him. You’re afraid to live. You judge everybody—maybe this one is different.”

Little Voice: “Don’t be a sucker, you know what’s going to happen and you’re going to feel like doo-doo when
it does.”

Once you get to his room, you kiss him with a vengeance—partly to block out the little voice and partly
to convince yourself that this guy is special. He comes by Saturday and you go to the concert. He’s attentive
and affectionate. He smells good; life is good. You go to the Union movie that night—he’s a little cooler. You
tell yourself, “People don’t always feel like talking, no big deal.” Afterwards, you attend a late-night party. He’s not as
energetic as the previous evening, but he’s probably just tired. The party begins to die, so you decide to go
home. You notice that you’re walking because you picked your dirty clothes up from the floor this morning. You invite
him in and you “small talk.” And then he speaks those dreaded words, “I have to get up early tomorrow
morning so I better get some sleep.” He thanks you for a “fun” weekend (gross). At the very least, you
were expecting a good-night kiss but now you're afraid that he’s going to shake your hand. Trying to keep your
weekend consistent, you hug him meaningfully and say, “I really had a good time.” He leaves. You feel ill. “Little
Voice” comes out of her shadowy corner and goes rough on you, “Well that sounded like a wrap-it-up talk to
me. Yes, you were right, he was very different. This guy started ignoring you before the date was over—they usually
wait until the day after.” She finally spells it out and you know she is right.

Maybe the trustees curbed dating because it’s fairly hazardous. You can’t tell what the other party is thinking. In fact,
people often act contrary to their feelings. They think it’s only a couple of hours, or a weekend, and then
they'll go back to their books and their extra-curricular activities. But why send mixed signals? To respond to a whim?
To satisfy curiosity? The worst part is that from then on, the two people who ended up “getting hooked,” pretend
not to know each other. It’s quite possible that you’ll become good friends with an acquaintance you talked to at
the party—mingling opens doors. But when stuck in the elevator with your old Mid-Winters date, you'll probably stare up at
the floor numbers (and Little Voice will count them out loud, “3-2-1”) and never say a word. You see, dating
can close doors.
