**Senator Birch Bayh**

**Prominent senator to speak**

One of America’s most prominent liberal legislators will be on the campus Monday and Tuesday. The Union Speakers Committee is sponsoring a visit by Indiana Democrat Birch Bayh, who served three terms in the United States Senate before his defeat by Republican Don Quayle last November.

While in Congress, Senator Bayh authored four constitutional amendments, chaired numerous committees, and became a leading advocate of the development of alternative energy sources.

He wrote the ERA and the proposed amendment to replace the Electoral College with direct election of the President. He also authored the 25th and 26th amendments, which prescribe the line of Presidential succession and grant 18-year-olds the right to vote.

Senator Bayh was active in social service legislation and in investigations of American intelligence methods.

Senator Bayh’s defeat was attributed to a large extent to a strong media campaign against him organized by the Moral Majority.

Bayh’s direct style—one Indiana citizen commented of him, “The man can out-folksy a pig”—has made him a popular speaker.

Senator Bayh will answer questions following his address in Love Auditorium Monday night and will be available for informal discussion on Tuesday. Check the calendar for details.

**Students display varied art**

Talented Davidson students are showing their true colors in Chambers Gallery for the Student Art Show, on display until May 13. The exhibit features an impressive array of lithographs, etchings, and oil paintings, as well as other colorful creations employing everything from bubble gum wrappers to sprawling, abstract swirls.

Entries were judged by Gerald Melberg, curator of Exhibitions at the Mint Museum of Art in Charlotte. First place award went to senior Matt McGuire, second place to junior Anne Brennan, and third place to sophomore Lisa Robinson. Anyone interested in purchasing a work should contact the artist.

**Wolfe tops convocation**

Davidson’s annual Spring Awards Convocation will be held in Love Auditorium Friday at 11 am. Faculty and student awards, including the Vereen Bell Creative Writing Award, will be presented. Dr. Henry T. Bahnson, Chairman of the Department of Surgery at the University of Pittsburgh Medical School, will receive an honorary doctor of science degree.

Tom Wolfe, contemporary author and critic, will be the featured speaker. Wolfe’s books include such captivating titles as *The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby* and *The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test*. *The Right Stuff*, published in 1979, was a national bestseller and won the American Book Award for general non-fiction. (For an interview with Mr. Wolfe, see page 9)

The Davidson Flute Ensemble and the Male Chorus will also perform.

Everyone is invited to attend this campus-wide event. Classes will be canceled from 10 am to 2 pm.

**Patterson returns for Phi Beta Kappa ceremony**

Former Davidson History Professor Brown Patterson will give a speech on “Renaissance Views of the Liberal Arts” next Wednesday at the annual Phi Beta Kappa induction ceremony.

Thirty-eight Davidson seniors will be honored at the ceremony.

Dr. Patterson is now Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee. His speech will begin at 7:30 in Chambers Gallery.

**Lawing leads outdoor concert**

The Davidson College Wind Ensemble will present its annual outdoor concert Sunday afternoon at 3 on the lawn in front of Chambers.

Dr. William Lawing will lead the group in a program which includes “Jupiter” from *The Planets* by Gustav Holst, highlights from Gershwin’s *Porgy and Bess*, and the polka and fugue from Weinberger’s *Schwanda the Bagpiper*.

In the event of rain, the concert will be May 3. It’s free!
