**Question of The Week**

Under recent faculty dispensing with services and leaving Saturday's, Tuesday's, and Thursday's chapels for student activities only, no special provision was made for the programs on these days. What kind of programs to have and how to vary the monotony of these programs is a question which concerns every Davidson student. Here are the opinions of several students on the matter.

**Bill Summers, Senior:**

To the question as to what the students should do with the days allotted to them in chapel, I would say that it would be a good opportunity for the Red and Black Masquers to expand somewhat their program on the campus. In the past, this organization has been able to present only about one or two productions a year for very obvious reasons. So it seems to me this would give them the opportunity to work up some one-act plays, short skits, etc., and present them without too much trouble and loss of time. This would give the club a chance to vary its activities a great deal and give more students an opportunity to try out their dramatic ability. But, most of all, I think it would give the students some entertainment they would enjoy. Why not turn one chapel period a month over to the Red and Black Masquers?

There is another organization on the campus which could also use a little more publicity. This is the Forensic Council. To the average student, this means little or nothing. Possibly he hears it mentioned in the fall when debate tryouts are announced and again in the spring when the debate teams return from their trips. But outside of that, he knows very little of the Forensic Council and the part it plays in the general program of the school. The thought has occurred to me that it might be a good thing if this organization were allowed to schedule at least two or three debates in the spring with well-known schools for the student chapel periods. Each spring, such schools as Carnegie Tech, Haverford, University of Penn, etc., visit the campus and leave without very many of the students knowing it. Why not let the student body in on some of the debating activities?

**Herb Rainey, Junior:**

I think that the Tuesday and Thursday chapel programs, or at least one of them, should be devoted informally to music. There are many singers and musicians here at Davidson, some of whom we hear a lot, and some of whom we do not. Why not let these boys entertain the student body with popular songs and swing music? The school band has only been heard at football games lately; they put on some good outdoor programs last spring, why not start these performances indoors this winter?

**Dick Rankin, Senior:**

Tuesday and Thursday's chapel could be made more interesting if some of the boys in the student body who possess talent would give programs such as musicals, in the form of swing one time, and popular classical programs at other times. It is already known that several of our students in the band have a great talent for...swing. (Continued on Page Eight)

short reorganized jobs. You'll be doing a great thing by pushing prayer groups and attendance at church in the school. That's something for the lighter side of Davidson, so let us know what you think with Captain Jack Phillips and sidekick Huff. That Herbert Morton, Tom Powell, Tom Little, and J.C. Walker spend a lot of practice time preparing their programs. That Mrs. Hengeveld has been more cooperative for these many years in putting on the Freshman Reception. Thanks from this student body as well as from previous ones seems such a small thing; they're heartfelt, nevertheless. That some fellows want to put on a checker tournament. Would you jump at the chance? There are actually new records for your use down here these days... popular ones at all hours, with Strauss, Victor Herbert, and even Shakespeare (speeches, of course) in office upon request.
