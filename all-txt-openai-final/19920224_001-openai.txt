**Students Come Out In Force For FLAG Forum**

By Kevin Miller

On Wednesday, February 19, the newly chartered FLAG organization held its first open forum in the 900 room. Student Body
President Anthony Foxx chaired a panel that included Campus Chaplain Chuck Hasty, FLAG president Beth Willard, Davidson graduate Eric Bone,
’91, and two members of the Charlotte area chapter of PFLAG (Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays), Milt Thompson
and Marcia Solomon. The panel talked with a group of some 150 Davidson students, faculty, and community members about their
personal experiences and views on the topic of homosexuality.

Hasty opened by stating that 10% of the population of the United States is homosexual, and that, by the numbers,
there could be as many as 150 gay and lesbian students on campus. “This is an issue, something we should
be talking about,” he said.

Thompson, a father of a son “born gay,” told his story of how at age eight, his son showed, after
psychological testing, the possibility of being gay, and by age thirteen, homosexuality was a reality. He explained how hard it
was to learn that his son would never be the person he hoped for. But, he said, as his son
grew, so did he, and his love for him was never compromised. Today, as a member of PFLAG and the
Disciples of Christ, Thompson believes that religion everywhere has contributed to the negativity that homosexuals face every day. By not
asserting itself as a leader and a supporter, the church has left many gays and lesbians searching for a good
answer to the “big” question on the issue, “Is this right in God’s mind?”

A student did ask Hasty what he would do if a student posed this question to him, and he answered
by saying, “I would never say whether it was right or wrong because I don’t know that person’s situation. I
would tell them to search their scriptures.” Thompson also asked the audience to put themselves in a gay’s place and
to think of the little things they would have to tolerate in almost every social situation. He said that, as
people, homosexuals are no different than anyone else. “Members of the band don’t discriminate against the football team, and marketing
majors don’t discriminate against engineering majors. So why should gays and lesbians be discriminated against by straights?” he said.

**Medical Humanities Speaker Addresses Assisted Suicide**

By Jeff Oller

On Tuesday, February 18, Dr. Velvi Greene, a professor of epidemiology at Ben Gurion University of Negev, Israel, gave a
lecture concerning assisted suicide as a part of the Medical Humanities Series. At the beginning, Greene asserted that he was
basing his interview on personal opinions drawn from his experiences and his study of the Jewish tradition. He then defined
assisted suicide as, “intentional infliction without malice in time of severe illness.” Euthanasia is defined as the action of killing
an individual for reasons of euthanasia.

A few forms of euthanasia that Greene cited were a patient’s refusal of pain killers, a patient’s decision to choose
another person to decide when the doctor is to discontinue treatment, a patient’s refusal of intravenous hydration, suicide for a
cause, suicide for another’s preservation, and a patient’s refusal of antibiotics. Throughout his talk, Greene insisted upon referring to assisted
suicide as murder, not euthanasia. He said, “this is the age of euthanasia, and I’m going to make a case
against euthanasia of any kind.”

Greene pointed out that the subject of assisted suicide has only been a public controversy since the 1980s. He asserted
that this is largely in part of the fact that, “technology allows us to consider euthanasia as a realistic option.”
Greene, in support of his assertion that he would draw greatly upon the Jewish tradition, referred to the Bible several
times. He cited Jonathan’s mercy killing of Saul in the book of Judges. Jonathan was put to death for putting
Saul out of misery. He also referred to the three cardinal sins in the Torah, incest, idolatry, and murder, and
he referred to the book of Genesis with its condemnation of assisted suicide.

Furthermore, he cited a precedent in Jewish law that refers to the idea that a person’s body does not belong
to himself, but instead belongs to God. Therefore, life cannot be tampered with except to preserve. He pointed out the
fact that, “euthanasia was performed discreetly.” The idea of euthanasia, he said, arose from the desire to do away with
those that were seen as unworthy or useless. Mental patients, mentally retarded persons, severely deformed or handicapped individuals, and others
who were “incapable” of contributing.to society were seen as a burden. Greene described his deep concern about the fact that
we, as a society, are considering allowing doctors to euthanize those patients who are either dying, in extreme discomfort, or
have no hope of living a normal life. Greene referred See "Greene" on page 4

UNC Professor Details Genetic Research
By Cindy Ebbs

Dr. John Graham, Emeritus Professor of Pathology at UNC Chapel Hill Medical School, visited Davidson on Thursday, February 19, and
discussed “Using Genetics in Clinical Research.” Graham graduated from Davidson in 1938 and then went on to UNC Chapel Hill
Medical School and Cornell University for further study. Graham, with the help of many student interns, has written over 185
scientific papers, many of which are located in the E.H. Little Library. Credit for the appearance of Dr. Graham goes
to a student of his, Dr. Donald L. Copeland, ’56, who now practices family medicine at the Lake Norman Medical
Park.

Graham’s lecture was based on the importance of family history in medical genetics. Through his close study of the genetic
family history, Graham illustrated examples of hereditary genes. Through a detailed diagram of the history of a family containing eleven
fathers and eighteen mothers, Graham used Hereditary Benign Intraepithelial Dyskeratosis, a condition otherwise known as “Red Eye,” to show an
example of a simple autosomal dominant trait. Graham also determined that the Hageman Trait and an abnormal blood clotting trait
are autosomal recessive traits. These types of traits usually point to inbreeding as a cause for its appearance 25% of
the time, as Graham proved through two specific family studies of these traits. Graham proved through genetic family studies that
rickets is an X-linked recessive trait, a trait which is located only on the X-chromosome. Also, Graham discussed the difference
between lethal, unable to be perpetuated, and sub-lethal, able to be perpetuated, traits using a type of Muscular Dystrophy and
Hemophilia as respective examples. Graham proceeded to switch See "Graham" on page 3

Solomon explained that she did not get an opportunity to see her son as often as the normal parent because
of her divorce. Thus, when her son told her during a visit with him at college that he was gay,
her lifelong image of him as the normal, loving, young boy was shattered. She said that the PFLAG saying, “when
children come out of the closet, parents go into the closet,” directly applied to her. She said that she went
through a grieving process, and that she went through a grieving process with the realization that her son would never
reproduce. But, with the help of PFLAG, she said, and the recognition of the “world of hate” that surrounds her
son, she came out of her closet. Now, she says, she is closer than ever with her son. Solomon said
that the discrimination and cruelty towards homosexuals has to stop. “By speaking to groups, I do try to change people’s
beliefs. You can believe what you want to believe, but you have no right to hurt my child,” she said.

Bone opened by saying that when he was at Davidson there was no way he could have possibly spoken out
about his homosexuality. He said that although his experience at Davidson was positive, it was positive only because of a
great amount of support he received from a small group of friends that allowed him to be himself with no
fear of ridicule. He said he received no support from his parents when they learned of his homosexuality during the
summer after his freshman year at See "FLAG” on page 2

Wilson Discusses Davidson Students "Breaking the Barriers”
By Leslie Goff

Last Monday evening in the 900 Room, Dr. Greer Wilson, a faculty member at the University of Virginia, lectured to
a gathering of students on the issue of tolerance. While many students missed the chance to hear this speaker, Wilson
presented a serious message regarding the breaking of barriers amidst our college community. Wilson stated that Davidson is not unique
in facing such hurdles that are currently plaguing the campus. Other schools about which she reported are Wake Forest and
UVA. Both schools are examining their current situations as well. Wilson began by describing three ways colleges handle multicultural issues.
