**NUMBER TWENTY-ONE**

**Bond Excoriates Society’s Values**

By NEIL COGHILL
Staff Writer

Julian Bond spoke last week to standing room only crowds on the twin subjects of “international annihilation” and domestic genocide. The outspoken black Georgia state legislator delivered a series of speeches in the Martin Lecture Series sponsored by Sigma Alpha Epsilon social fraternity.

Bond said the war in Vietnam was a direct cause of many of the nation’s social and economic ills, and advised the nation to abandon the “gunboat diplomacy of the past.” Bond called for a complete “reconstruction” of the American system, although he doubted that the necessary radical changes would come in the next ten years, based on the experience of the past ten years.

Bond recognized the possibility of violent revolution but did not think it likely. He did not believe that Black Panthers could ever overthrow the government, but did fear an inseparable split between the two races if present conditions continued. Bond characterized the last ten years as having “demonstrated time and time again how the people of this nation must take action” if change is going to come. In anticipating the next ten years, he saw the only hope as a coalition of groups which would make up “a noisy majority of people who if they acted together could shake... the nation.”

Bond appeared confident and cool and never raised his voice while using the invective of three black leaders of a century ago to attack the deception, cowardice, and hypocrisy of white America’s treatment of blacks. In the question and answer period that followed his address and an open discussion in the Morrison Room late Tuesday night, Bond's sharp humorous replies were generally well received.

On the Black Panthers: “There are two things — first, they are a legitimate political organization which have not been successful because of constant harassment by police; more important, however, they have set a new standard of manliness in the black community.”

On busing: “Busing is an old American practice. School children have been bused as long as there have been school buses. In Sylvania, I was bused past a white school... with all my black friends to an all-black school, but I never heard any white parents object.”

On whether he had any faith in Nixon’s “secret schedule” to withdraw troops from Vietnam: “No.”

On Judge Harrold Carswell’s nomination to the Supreme Court: “He has never distinguished himself, why should he be?”

On Judge Julius Hoffman’s handling of the trial of the Chicago Seven: “The case had no merits at all... he (Hoffman) was not at all justified (in his procedure).”

**Faculty Scraps Compulsory Exams**

By JOHN McLEAN
Managing Editor

The faculty, calling for a more flexible method of evaluating students’ course work, voted to do away with compulsory written final examinations at its Tuesday afternoon meeting. A proposal from the Educational Policy Committee was amended at the faculty meeting last Tuesday to read: “that an evaluation of a student’s work at the end of a course normally be made by means of a written final examination of no more than three hours in length.” The measure authorizes faculty members to select, with departmental approval, alternative forms of evaluation such as take-home finals, oral examinations, or major term papers and research projects.

According to members of the EPC, it is intended that some form of total course evaluation will be given, be it written final examinations or some other method. A number of new courses will be added to the curriculum next year. Newly hired professor Samuel De Witt Proctor, an expert on African affairs, will offer a course in African Political Systems and one on the foreign policies of African States. Both courses are included in the political science department curriculum. The South Asian program will be complemented by several new studies courses taught by Frederick Gaige, including Modern Indian History and South Asian Civilization.

A new computer course replacing the non-credit Fortran course will be taught by assistant math professor Jeff A. Roberts. The new course will combine instruction on use of the computer with topics in statistics. The course listings in the college catalogue, including these courses and others, will be available soon in the office of the registrar.

The faculty rejected the EPC proposal that the supervision of make-up reviews be taken out of the jurisdiction of the office of the Dean of Students. The EPC suggested that make-up reviews be handled by each professor. But the faculty voted to reaffirm the present rule, which states that permission to take a make-up review must be granted by the Dean of Students.

**Faculty Puts Off Open Dorm Vote**

The faculty met in closed session last Tuesday without taking up the proposal for 24-hour open dorms which has been referred to it from the Student Life Committee. College President Samuel R. Spencer Jr. said that the faculty would probably meet to consider the measure two weeks from now. The faculty will not meet next week because of the planned visit by former Secretary of State Dean Rusk on campus at that time.

The proposal, which was approved by the Residence Hall Council, the SGA Senate, and the SLC, changes the RHC Manual of Order so that a dormitory could vote to have open house 24-hours a day if it so desired. The SLC had approved the measure, but in doing so accepted Spencer's belief that the SLC did not have final authority in the matter but should defer to the faculty and the trustees. Spencer had said that the measure contradicted past faculty-trustee policy, an interpretation which has not been accepted by the RHC. (See Mar. 6 issue of THE DAVIDSONIAN, P. 1.)

Near complete returns from the RHC referendum on the open dorms proposal show that 79.81 percent of students voting favor unlimited hours. The RHC will use the referendum vote to determine which dorms will be opened if and when the faculty approves the measure.

**Bevan Picked To Replace Retiring Dean Of Faculty**

John M. Bevan, academic vice president of the University of the Pacific and former dean of the vice president of academic affairs at Florida Presbyterian College, will become Davidson’s vice president for academic affairs next fall. He will succeed Frontis W. Johnston who asked to be replaced as dean of the faculty last spring. Johnston will become dean of the new Honors College program here.

Bevan taught psychology at Davidson seven years before going to Florida Presbyterian College in 1959. He assumed his present position in Stockton, California in 1967. In announcing the appointment, President Samuel R. Spencer Jr. offered great praise for Bevan's long and outstanding record as an academic innovator. “Bevan’s impressive record is marked by educational innovation, a commitment to independent study, and a strong interest in international experience for students — objectives implicit in the new curriculum at Davidson,” Spencer said.

In a personal DAVIDSONIAN interview this week, Bevan affirmed his interest in these areas stating that he had “great experience in interdisciplinary study models, with independent study programs and with international dimensions in education.”

In the international dimension, Bevan has had considerable experience in Southeast Asia having established study centers in India, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Japan. In 1969 he served as Chairman of the first All Asian Conference on Higher Education which was held in Hong Kong.

Concerning education on the home front, Bevan stressed that he “never likes to go into academic development purely limited to a single institution of itself.” Instead, Bevan stated that he favored community involvement for students, giving academic credit for work by students outside the institution and involving the community.

Eleven coeds will be taking courses here next fall under the College Exchange Program. According to Registrar J. H. Ostwalt, eight will be here for the entire academic year, two only for the fall term, and one only for the winter and spring terms. Ostwalt said that three are from Hollins College, three from Randolph-Macon Women’s College, three from Mary Baldwin College, and two from Sweet Briar College.

In addition, five Davidson students are going to Hollins College on the Exchange program. Ostwalt declined to give the names of the girls coming to Davidson because some of them had not sent in their $150 deposits yet and therefore he was not sure they were coming. A check with admissions offices at Mary Baldwin, Hollins, Randolph-Macon, and Sweet Briar, however, revealed the names of eight of the girls coming.to Davidson on the exchange. The girls coming from Hollins College near Lynchburg, Va. are Mary Gray Stavis and Susan T. Strahin. According to the Hollins Registrar’s Office, Carol Daniel may also come, but she has not yet paid the deposit. Martha Stewart and Mary Kinhaus will be coming from Sweet Briar. From Randolph-Macon Women's College will be Madlen Marinaro, Quant, and Elizabeth. Randolph-Macon is sending Karen Young. Information from Mary Baldwin College was unavailable, since the college is on vacation until Apr. 6 and the Exchange Committee there could not be reached. “We're eagerly looking forward to the exchange program next year,” said the Dean of Women at Randolph-Macon. “Even though we have no one from Davidson coming here.”

The Davidson students going to Hollins next year under the program are sophomores Joe Turner, John Cox, Chris Sikes, Billy Stagg, and Bobby Allen.

Hobbie, Buttrick To Get Honorary Degrees At June Commencement

George A. Buttrick, internationally-known theologian and teacher, and the Rev. F. Wellford Hobbie of Little Rock, Ark., will receive honorary degrees at Davidson’s commencement exercises June 14. In addition, Buttrick, who was a visiting professor at Davidson during the winter term, will preach the baccalaureate sermon that morning in the college church. Davidson’s faculty and trustees have voted to give Buttrick an honorary doctor of letters and Hobbie an honorary doctor of divinity degree.

Buttrick was editor of the voluminous “Interpreter’s Bible” and the “Interpreter’s Dictionary of the Bible.” He has written six major books, including most recently, “God, Pain and Evil” published in 1966. Born in England in 1892 and educated there, he served as pastor of the Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church in New York City during 1927-54. He was then preacher to the university and Plummer Professor of Christian Morals at Harvard for six years, and served eight years as professor of preaching at Garrett Theological Seminary of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. He has been a visiting lecturer or professor at several other American colleges and universities and is a past president of the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America.

Hobbie has been pastor of the Second Presbyterian Church in Little Rock, Ark., since 1968. He has served pastorates in Chatham, Va., 1950-57; Tarboro, N. C., 1957-63; and First Presbyterian Church, Staunton, Va., 1963-68. He also taught at Mary Baldwin College in Staunton during 1965-68. Born in Roanoke, Va., in 1922, he graduated from Davidson in 1943 and served in the U.S. Navy until 1946 as a line officer. He received a master’s degree from Union Theological Seminary in Richmond, Va., and studied at the University of Basel, Switzerland, in 1951-52. He is currently chairman of the research and planning committee, a member of the General Council, and a member of a committee on a confession of faith for the Presbyterian Church, U.S.

John Bevan Known As Educational Innovator

Said Bevan, “I favor anything that helps students go as far as their abilities will allow them to go.” He stated that “My primary concern is what happens to the students; the faculty is instrumental toward that end.” Discussing his return to the Davidson campus, Bevan indicated that he had high regard for the school. “The recent developments in curriculum and academic innovation and development have accomplished a great deal. Davidson has great potential academically and with respect to the Southeast. When Davidson does something, other schools usually take notice.” Bevan said he expects to be on campus by Sept. 1.

Bevan is also well known for his popularity and ability to work with students. According to Spencer, “As a classroom teacher, he was highly effective and popular with his students. Obvious to anyone who knows him are his great energy, enthusiasm, and dynamism. His deep concern for those about him is a manifestation of his faith and commitment to his own personal values.”

‘Nationals’ Regain House Over Local Machi

By RUSS MERRITT
Associate Editor

In a closed meeting Wednesday afternoon, the Student Life Committee passed a resolution restoring the fraternity house recently occupied by the local organization to the national fraternity, according to reliable sources. The motion, which came after a study of the situation and an analysis of several other possible alternatives for the house, states that “the loyalist Sigma Chi group be granted use of the house until the end of the present term, before which time the Student Life Committee will re-examine the situation, particularly in the light of any information which might be received regarding Sigma Chi policies concerning racial relations.” Also, the motion reminds the group that it is still subject to certain standard responsibilities and regulations met by all Davidson fraternities concerning the house.

The move is the latest controversial development in the history of the Machi organization. Last fall, because of certain racial policies and other national requirements as well as individual attitudes, the members of the fraternity voted to disaffiliate from the national organization. Despite the dwindling number of members, who usually left for personal reasons rather than affiliation, the local Machi organization survived for almost five months as the only non-national fraternity on the Davidson campus, until financial burdens forced the group to fold on Mar. 12. Upon the financial collapse of the group, the question of rights to the house arose, while other groups on campus sought the house for such uses as a learning center, the honors college, a completely open eating club, and so on. According to reliable sources, however, the national group may also be in financial trouble soon, since all of the pledge class left upon the collapse of the Machis.

Ex-Secretary Dean Rusk To Give Reynolds Lecture
