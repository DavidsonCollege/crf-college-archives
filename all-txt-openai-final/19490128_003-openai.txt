Davidson College is moving into a new period of growth and development in athletics. With the addition of a new gymnasium, the encouraging success of the tennis team, and the copping of a berth in the Southern Conference tourney by the Cat cagers, Davidson College teams have come to be a factor to reckon with in this section of the South and have also achieved national prominence in many instances.

The latest development in this series of events is the announcement of the scheduling of the West Point Cadets for an opening date at Michie Stadium by Norman Shepherd, the athletic director of Davidson’s growing program. This game will no doubt add much to the prestige of the Cats’ ball club, win or lose. No doubt a win would more than relieve Coaches Shepherd and Jamerson’s trepidations over the scheduling of such a powerhouse. But since this can only be hoped for, considering the probable strength of Army next year, the majority of Davidson students will be looking forward to a good game and a low score, which would give the Cats a lift and get the boys off to a good start for the season.

However, Coach Red Blaik has never been known as one to hold the score down and he will no doubt beat us as badly as possible. A bad defeat could affect the morale of the team and set them off to a bad start from which they might not recover. Davidson students will be looking forward to the outcome of this newest venture into big-time athletics.

With an eye cocked toward the September 24 battle, Coach Jamerson issued the clarion call to all football aspirants for a period of football drills in chapel Tuesday. He appealed especially to those men with high school and prep school experience who have never gone out at Davidson to come out and try to make the squad. According to reports, the response was very good with about 60 men reporting Wednesday and checking out equipment. Coach Charley explained that the purpose of these winter drills was to give those football players who participated in baseball and track a chance to get in their football training before the spring sports opened up. He immediately started in with contact work, with the idea of seeing who could take it and come back for more. Also noticed on Richardson Field Wednesday afternoon were a few husky high school prospects who were brought down for tryouts. Coach Jamerson, always on his toes, is not missing a bet in trying to get good athletic material with adequate grades to come to Davidson.

Prospects of the squad for next year look fairly good with the gaps being left at fullbacks and both ends. With stars like Mack Erwin, Carl Pahl, Buddy Cheek, Hal Mapes, and Mike Williams not returning, it looks like Coach Charley and staff will have to fashion this year’s team from scratch.

ALL ABOARD FOR WEST POINT!

‘CATS MEET CADETS IN SEASON OPENER

WILDCATS DUMP CITADEL IN SECOND HALF SPLURGE
By GORDON SCOTT

Cat line, together with an adequate representation by the football, baseball, and track teams, who beat everybody in sight in their own class and also whipped the representative teams of many larger institutions, is promising.

Faculty Too Much

Davidson caught fire at halftime. Davidson downed the Citadel to the count of 44-42. The Wildcats, who had been unable to break the Citadel’s tight zone defense, froze the ball and gave the crowd a thrill by their backhanded passes. Professor Joe Martin, using his knowledge of mathematics on the hardwood, turned into a man-to-man defense.

Davidson’s grid talent decided to try its luck on the hardwood Monday night against a spirited faculty team but came out on the short end of a 37-28 score. The football boys, who call themselves the Football Firecrackers, have come up with a strong team. Although the Firecrackers were playing a game that was different from the one they are used to, they moved a lot and put it to good use several times after nine minutes into the game.

The leaders for the faculty were Baird and Sharpe, who scored 10 and six points respectively. Baird was not only noticed for his accurate shooting but his handed passes. The faculty quintet pulled a stunt that has not been seen around here in some time. Being unable to break the Wildcats’ tight zone defense, the faculty froze the ball and gave the crowd a thrill by their backhanded passes. Professor Joe Martin, using his knowledge of mathematics on the hardwood, turned into a man-to-man defense.

With exams in the past, the Wildcat basketball team resumes the tough schedule which stands between them and the Southern Conference tournament. Although not one of the highly regarded stars of the team, there is one man who will probably play an important role in determining Davidson’s success—that is Bill Iverson from Miami, Florida. When one first sees Bill on the court, he is impressed by Bill’s blocking back. After injuries at that position, the burden fell on Iverson, who learned the new, important position quickly and did an admirable job. Although not content with being a two-sport man, Bill competes on the track team for which he ran the 880 last year. He has also thrown the shot and discus as well as run the one and two miles. Sheer determination and good conditioning help to make Bill a valuable reserve.

The freshman basketball team continued to roll last week as they brought home a 44-42 victory over Wingate Junior College. The Wildcats were not missing a bet in trying to get good athletic material with adequate grades to come to Davidson. The Wildcats, who had been unable to break the Citadel’s tight zone defense, froze the ball and gave the crowd a thrill by their backhanded passes.

With exams in the past, the Wildcat basketball team resumes the tough schedule which stands between them and the Southern Conference tournament. Although not one of the highly regarded stars of the team, there is one man who will probably play an important roleOty heavy-set build which is not characteristic of basketball players. Sometimes he even seems awkward in handling the ball, but when he has been observed more it becomes evident why. He is presently holding down a starting position. Possessor of a good, one-handed push shot, Bill has shown that he can score and do it a good percentage of the time. He hit for ten points against Maryland, but it was the McCrary Eagles game when he was really hot, ringing up 18 points and a .500 average. At present he holds a little over a six-point average per game. He has shown that he is no slouch as a guard, holding Duke's star, Collins, scoreless from the floor for a considerable time and a basket, showing that he is by no means slow. When things become rough Bill can give it with the best.

On the football team last fall, Bill is a senior and pre-ministerial student, and when it comes to his other activities, it is found that he is a very busy man. A member of the Y Club, Phi Delta Theta social fraternity, and Sigma Delta Psi athletic fraternity, Bill spends a great deal of time working with a local boys club at the Unity Church, emphasizing sportsmanship and Christian living. Calling Bill the wittiest man on the campus might be a mistake, but it isn't his fault if he isn't because amiable Bill has a joke anytime. However, it isn't a joke that Bill has on the string the Phi Delt sponsor. Not to mention Miss North Carolina.

The Davidson cagers are moving into a big weekend at Carolina and Duke with the conference tournament ever on their minds. A victory over either Duke or Carolina would be a mild upset, but this column thinks Shepherd's boys are capable of just that. The freshmen hoopsters will meet the cream of the conference freshmen crop when they tangle with the Duke “Baby Blue Devils.” The undefeated Kittens will be out for a win and it should be a great ball game.

One of the best sports events witnessed on this campus in a long time was the Faculty-All Star game on Monday night, preliminary to the Citadel-Davidson clash. Everyone there got a big kick out of watching Messrs. Laird, Brown, and Redding, etc., subdue the husky footballers. We hope to see some more of those antics this season.

About the Southern Conference basketball tournament this year, Bill confidently says, “Everyone knows that it is a good competitor and they can be sure that while he is playing he won't let up.” He has a will to win and a fighting heart like Bill Iverson, that statement won't be far wrong.

Tuesday, January 25 saw the SPs move out in front of the rest of the Fraternity league due to their 35-33 win over the Pikas. Also, the Betas beat the Independents, 22-11, and the SAEs tied the SPEs for first place in the league after the final whistle sounded on their 32-28 game with the Sigma Chis. Standings through Tuesday night's games are as follows:

Kappa Sigs 1-0
Phi Gams 1-0
Betas 1-1
Independents 1-1
Pi Kappa 0-1
SAEs 0-2

One thing noticeable at the games is the scarcity of the crowds. The fraternity basketball games are a lot of fun to watch, and sometimes you'll see things there that you never see in a varsity game, so you boys that haven't been attending, come on down one night. You won't be disappointed.
