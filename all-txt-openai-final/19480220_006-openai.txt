"DARK PASSAGE"
With Bacall-Bogart

Attention all you Bacall-Bogart fans! Lauren and her favorite hero are coming to town. Descriptive adjectives for such a production
as this must be full of sibilants with the emphasis on sex. For her have recaptured spouse. Franchot Tone found
her in his grip.

Take a break. Give your body the rest it deserves by taking it to the STUD for a snack.

Hotel: "Owner, did you find my suitcase?"
Owner: "Yes, I found it in his grip."

Radio and press have devoted a lot of time for the past year to the discussion of the "New Look"
and the "Old Look." No one will be able to deny that Lauren is still "The Look."

one of those bang pictures for which the stars are noted.)

THINK IT OVER... (Continued From Page Two)

A re-vitalized Christian Church in America, working as one in Christ, must reclaim America for Him and proceed simultaneously to
launch a mighty world mission offensive which will make all past efforts seem small. We must teach Christ and Him
