**How can violence bring an end to violence?**
Jay Barron

Last month, Ted Bundy was finally put to death in Florida’s electric chair, located in the aptly named town of
Starke. Although there is no controversy surrounding his conviction for the brutal acts he committed, the issue of whether the
death penalty is morally justifiable in ANY case, regardless of the circumstances, has resurfaced. In Bundy’s case, many of the
variables that often play a role in determining public attitudes toward capital punishment were moot, like the possibility of executing
an innocent defendant. As a result, human rights groups like Amnesty International have once again been put on the defensive
in the face of widespread public support for putting the clearly guilty, clearly heinous to death. Some would even argue
that Bundy wasn’t eligible for “human rights,” having sacrificed his humanity via his cruel acts.

However, the arguments in favor of electrocuting Bundy stop with similarly emotional arguments, motivated by hatred and a thirst for
vengeance. Is there any evidence that killing people like Bundy has or will serve as a deterrent to the potential
killer? Can anyone say with complete assurance that the carnival atmosphere outside the prison during the execution proceedings did not
plant the seeds of violence in someone else’s mind? Would the person who is desperate enough to take someone else’s
life stop to think of poor Ted Bundy and reconsider his or her act, requiring him or her to suppress
all the rage that had moved him or her to consider murder? Would he or she think anything at all
other than hate and vengeance? No, absolutely not, because the arguments for capital punishment are just as irrational and emotion-laden
as the desire to kill.

T-shirts and campaign signs emblazoned with recipes for “fried Bundy” highlight the hysteria, and utter disregard for rational contemplation, that
surrounds capital punishment in our fine, upstanding, supposedly civilized society. Capital offenders like Ted Bundy should be removed from society,
but it should not be done with electricity, gas, poison, or the excruciating torture of knowing the very minute when
you will be strapped down and eliminated. Attempts should be made to try to rehabilitate men and women like Ted
Bundy, but that takes more effort than killing. Unfortunately, as we enter a new political era in the U.S., we
can see no further than President Bush’s eloquent adjective: “heinous.” It’s not Mr. Bush’s fault. His convictions are primarily a
reflection of popular opinion, and this opinion, that capital punishment has its place when the defendant is horrible enough, is
widely and proudly held. However, there is simply no rational argument that can be made to support the institution of
state-sanctioned murder. Only a desire for vengeance holds up, and who can disagree with such a subjective reason? How can
violence bring an end to violence? The death penalty is cruel, racially discriminatory, more costly than lifetime imprisonment, and clearly
irreversible. The death penalty is not rational, it is emotional, and regardless of how horrible a person’s deeds are, nothing
positive can be accomplished by inflicting the same horrors on that person. If the terror of Ted Bundy can teach
us anything, let it be that he is not the only person to ever kill, and that killing him may
have done more to legitimize murder than to affect a positive change in our society.

**Picnicking at the guillotine**
Pat Schlag

Persons who argue in favor of the death penalty cite many reasons for their position. Some merely seek retribution for
the abhorrent actions of the prisoner. Others maintain its efficacy as a deterrent to future crime. Amateur economists belabor the
financial burden of imprisonment, sometimes stretching over a great number of years. Yet capital punishment in the United States is
fatally flawed as an effective punishment. Carefully conducted analysis of capital punishment has shown alarming demographics. Biases are ubiquitous; not
only racial, but gender and geographical gaps are evident as well. In some areas, the imposition of the death penalty
is practically arbitrary, independent of any valid, continuous pattern. Prisoners on death row often wait as long as ten years
for their sentence to be carried out. Many of those sentenced to death are mentally ill or juveniles. It costs
us at least 2 1/2 times as much to put a prisoner to death as it does to imprison for
life. The question of deterrence seems to be more personal conjecture than fact. It was amusing to hear President Bush
and Michael Dukakis debating this obviously empirical question. It is difficult to ascertain how many people are “deterred” and thus
do not commit a crime. Comparative data from states with changing capital statutes are scattered and inefficient, and can be
misstated to the advantage of either side.Is retribution, therefore, a good enough reason to kill an unlucky handful of convicted
criminals? For when the fallacies are stripped away, there is only hatred. And anger. And outrage. How civilized is it
for us to kill some criminals to avenge our anger at all of them? The circus surrounding Ted Bundy’s last
days made me feel as if we were picnicking at the guillotine. How humane.

The Satanic Verses: a literary “boo-boo”
Nusrat Khan

“Rushdie is an old world family name which means, someone who is in a ‘Rush’ to ‘Die’...” said Dennis Miller
the other day in one of his pseudo-news rituals on Saturday Night Live. These days everywhere I go people ask
me about my view on Salman Rushdie’s book. Rushdie was not given England’s coveted Booker Prize for just being the
person to be nominated thrice in the last few years. His nominations bear testimony to the fact that he is
an author warmed by the fires of genius. It appears though that this time Rushdie has gone over the “fictional
edge”; committing what we may call in our vernacular “a literary boo boo!”

My personal opinion after flipping through the book, reading the book review in The New York Times, and after soaking
in all the spicy trash that the news media throws at us, has now boiled down to this. It is
a piece of literature, the work of an author whose imagination knows no bounds. The freedom of belief and the
freedom of speech are the essential rights of an individual in every civilized society. So even if Rushdie’s book was
found offensive by certain individuals who disagreed with its contents on personal or religious grounds, there was still no reason
to pass a death sentence on him. For no one has the right to take a human life.

Having made this point clear, I would like to say something directly concerning the book. For Rushdie to comment that
this book is pure fiction is fiction itself. There are too many similarities between the events that take place with
the prophet in his book, and the events recorded during the life of Mohammed, the prophet of the Muslims. For
example, Mohammed [the Muslim prophet] had nine wives and so does the prophet in Rushdie’s book. But in the book,
Rushdie has shown his prophet to be running a whorehouse using his wives. Not only the events, but also the
names of the characters in his book are similar to the names of individuals in Islamic history. It’s obvious Rushdie
knew what he was doing when he wrote the book.

It’s important to point out that Rushdie is no stranger to controversy. His book Gandhi, on the life of the
Indian leader, got him in trouble in India, his homeland. Another one of his books, Shame, made him face a
lawsuit in Pakistan. So it appears that while in the process of writing The Satanic Verses he decided to keep
the tradition alive! It is obvious that he has purposely chosen to relate incidents in his book that run parallel
to Islamic history. And he has quite clearly distorted facts to fit what he calls “fiction.” The incidents in his
book are definitely woven around the prophet. The point in question is: why did he do this? There can only
be two answers to this: one, that this is Rushdie’s style; he has always written controversial stuff. Controversy seems to
be in his blood. The other reason, which seems more probable, is that what Rushdie was actually trying to do
was to instigate enough reaction in the world so as to get a couple of thousand dollars of free publicity
from the news media. What he did not bank on was the nature of the reaction that this book actually
generated. Rushdie’s literary time bomb has now seemed to have developed a mind of its own, generating a reaction from
the Muslim world that he had never imagined. This reaction is similar to the recent partial Christian outburst on the
release of the movie, “The Last Temptation of Christ,” and the directors of that film had also continued to emphasize
that this was pure fiction; nevertheless, individuals from all walks of life did express anger.

What I do not agree with is the Ayatollah’s handling of the matter, in what seems like an undiplomatic and
somewhat despicable manner. At a time when his crippled nation needs all help it can get from the European and
American Economic community, he made a very blatant and unwise decision. One cannot kill the national of another country on
any account. The need was to adopt a more diplomatic path, one that could have involved several other routes, which
would not only have been less extremist in nature, but might have also been successful.
