Popular Song’. These radio performances won the Trio the coveted Peabody Award for 1977.

Jazz in its finest form will be the feature of this weekend’s 900 Room performances. The Loonis McGlohon Trio, led by Charlotte’s own Loonis McGlohon, will be performing September 29 to October 1 beginning each night at 9:30 pm.

The remarkable jazz trio has played at leading jazz festivals and college concerts. They have also been heard on the radio series, ‘American Popular Song’. These radio performances won the Trio the coveted Peabody Award for 1977.

Loonis McGlohon, a former name-band pianist, recently headlined in New York and will appear at the Baird Theatre at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington. Jim Lackey was formerly drummer with the Glenn Miller Band under Ray McKinley. Terry Lassiter has appeared with leading jazz groups all over the east coast and may often be heard at Sinclair's in Charlotte.

**Taxi Driver Review**

Martin Scorsese's ‘Taxi Driver’, to be shown tomorrow night at 8 and 10:30 pm in Love Auditorium, is one of those rare movies which manages to catch both psychological depth and dramatic interest at the same time.

‘Dog Day Afternoon’ had it. ‘The Godfather’ had it. And ‘Taxi Driver’ has it too—some quality that keeps the viewer riveted to the screen and immersed in the plot.

After saying this, ‘Taxi Driver’ is certainly not a movie for everybody and some may find it offensive. Dealing with a New York City cab driver who goes whacko and commits a series of murders, this film is definitely not for the squeamish. But the gore used here seems to be used intelligently and can be included in the area of artistic expression.

Robert DeNiro stars in ‘Taxi Driver’ as Travis Bickle, a man who is slowly coming apart as the movie opens. He goes to porn movies. He pops pills. He is filled with a deep hatred for the city about him.

Bickle becomes a cabbie because he ‘just wants to work late hours.’ He spends much of the movie just riding around some of the worst streets in the city.

Two unsuccessful love stories enmesh themselves in the plot. One is with Cybill Shepherd (who gives the only bad performance of the picture) and the other involves Jodie Foster, who plays a 12-year-old prostitute. DeNiro has illusions of rescuing the young girl. In a sense, he does.

For more literary viewers, there are some ‘heavy’ references in ‘Taxi Driver’ which will be keeping film students writing term papers for years to come.

Paul Schrader, who wrote the script, claims he wanted to put the hero of Jean Paul Sartre's ‘Nausea’ on the screen. So don’t expect a light adventure story. You won’t find it.

Other behind-the-camera credit goes to the director Martin Scorsese (‘Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore’ and ‘New York, New York’) and the late Bernard Herrmann who wrote the score.

**Cat Runners Beat Ga. State**

On Saturday, September 17, Davidson’s cross country team defeated Georgia State in a dual meet scored from the results of the Stone Mountain Road Race in Georgia.

This five-mile event annually attracts over 400 runners from throughout the southeastern United States.

The victory evened the Wildcat runner’s record at 1-1 after an opening defeat to powerful Duke the week before.

Coach Norman Koller considered the 25-32 victory an especially ‘pleasant kind of a win’ because two of his top runners did not figure in the scoring. Junior Doug Horn dropped from the race because of a foot injury and John Davis, winner of the freshman cake race, did not make the trip.

Senior Coty Pinckney, who was teaching in Africa last year and did not run for the Cats in 1976, finished first in the dual meet and 35th overall with a time of 25:58. Sophomore George Strobel finished second for the Wildcats and third in the dual meet with a time of 26:52. Bart Landess, a freshman, placed third for Davidson at 27:40. Vasili Carperos ran 28:04, over two minutes better than his time in last year’s race, and was fourth for the Cats. Jeff Morrow, another sophomore, ran fifth with a time of 28:24.

Cross country scoring is based on the top five finishers for both teams. The five places are added together and the sum is the score for the team. Thus, freshman Greg Barnard and sophomore Tom Scott, who finished 10th and 11th respectively, figured in the scoring by ‘pushing’ the fifth place Ga. State runner to 12th in the meet and widening Davidson's victory margin.

Koller has high hopes for this year’s team and predicts improvement over last year's squad, which finished with a losing record.

Pinckney stated, ‘This could be Davidson’s best cross country team ever.’

Koller considers runners Barnard, Davis, and Landess ‘as good freshmen as Davidson has ever had.’

Koller went on to say, ‘John Davis could be the best runner in the history of the school.’

The fact that six of the first seven finishers for the Wildcats in Saturday's race were either a freshman or a sophomore indicates the strength of this year’s runners and great potential for years to come.

Koller also ran in the race, finishing one second behind Senior Bill Gaynor.

Davidson's runners are idle next week and the prognosis is good for the tri-meet with Lynchburg and Campbell College at Lynchburg on October 1.
