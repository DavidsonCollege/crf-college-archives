DAVIDSON'S NEWS FOLLOWER

We at the Yowl have noticed that the Freshman orientation experience is sorely lacking the real-world advice needed to succeed
at Davidson College, both in the classroom and beyond. Moreover, the notorious Freshman Facebook is rife with errors, malapropisms, and
misused homonyms. In order to lend these struggling First Year students a guiding light, the Yowl introduces its first annual:

Labor Day Freshman Extravaganza

Social Life

- The people who you meet in orientation are going to be your friends for all 4 years.
- Unless you’re about to hook up, every 10 minutes say that the party sucks and walk to another one.
Repeat throughout the whole night.
- Beware of underage drinking. Rumor has it that it’s rife among Davidson students. Statistics say that there’s a chance
your best friend could drink underage.
- Lots of times there are unannounced costume parties disguised as regular parties. Those who show up with the best
costumes get a fabulous prize!
- For safety reasons, it is always a good idea to stay with large groups, especially in Vail Commons.
- Don’t be that outcast! Remember to wear lots of perfume and/or cologne when you go to a party!
- On a Sunday morning, it is of the utmost importance that you walk into Commons looking as if you
were out the entire night before. After all, you do not want people to think you are some loser who
stayed in last night.
- Most importantly, always remember: You have one reputation and four years to ruin it. Take your time!

Residence Life Update

- The old urinals in Belk Residence Hall used to look like chamber pots and are now on display in
the E.H. Little Library.
- Rest assured, the 24-hour study room is no longer an option for residential housing as it proved extremely unpopular
last year.
- Be careful! Alcohol citations are mailed to both your parents and your professors.
- Early signups for sophomore apartments are now available in the Residence Life Office! Hurry, they are just like the
senior apartments with nicer bathrooms.
- If you are short on cash, consider selling your Facebook to an upperclassman at exorbitant prices.
