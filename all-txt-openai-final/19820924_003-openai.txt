**Carson Delivers Staley Lectures**

Dr. Mary Faith Carson, chairman of the religion department at Moravian College in Bethlehem, Pa., delivered the fall series of Staley Distinguished Christian Scholar Lectures at Davidson College on 21 and 22 September. Dr. Carson graduated from Salem College and attended Union Theological Seminary in Richmond.

**Oliver Displays Sculptures**

The Davidson College Art Gallery is opening the fall season with a display of works by sculptor Jeanette Oliver. Oliver, who lives in Burlington, studied at the Art Students League and the School of Visual Arts in New York. She received her bachelor’s degree from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. Her most recent one-man show was held earlier this year at Duke University West Gallery in Durham. Oliver’s large steel pieces, which show influence of modern masters such as Julio González and Alberto Giacometti, will be on display through the month. The Davidson College Art Gallery is located in Chambers Building on the campus and is open weekdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.

**Belk Gets New Look**

Belk dormitory stood in shambles two weeks before freshman orientation began. Empty paint cans, disassembled bed frames, and torn ceiling tiles littered the halls. Now, after tireless work by the dedicated staffs of the housing office, physical plant, and custodial department, some upperclassmen refer to Belk as “a palace.” Beginning only a week after spring term exams, contractors completed the bulk of Belk renovations by 4 September. The extra effort by both Davidson and outside workers overcame a lag in clean-up. Today, fresh coats of paint adorn all rooms, halls, and stairwells. Lowered ceilings with better lighting, windows with mini-blinds, and refinished doors and handrails refine Belk’s appearance. New lounges and new wooden, stained bunk-bed frames all increase student comfort. Though not functional until mid-October, the recently installed air conditioning and heating system promises climate-controlled comfort. Director of Housing Bill Bolding says, “The whole character of the building has changed. The halls are not quite as long and dark. The whole building looks nicer. We try to ask the students what they want in each dorm as it’s redone. Lots of people told us they wanted bunk beds [in Belk] so we got them. Our goal is to redo one building a year. This year it was supposed to be Cannon, but because of a need for air conditioning for many summer programs, we focused on Belk.”Campers, Belk was redone instead.” Additional renovations or structural changes on campus include: the demolition of the old shop building and movement of the shop facility to the east end of the football stadium; the near completion of the Black Student Coalition house; the demolition of Lafferty House on Main Street; minor remodeling in Cannon Dorm; sidewalk construction behind Sentelle; and the pavement of the new parking lot on the west side of Patterson Court.

Professor White Dies

Charles A. Dana professor of Physics Dr. Locke White Jr. '39, chairman of his department since 1978 and a member of the faculty for twenty-one years, died of a heart attack on 4 July. He was 63. The son of Presbyterian missionaries, White was born in South Boston, Va., and spent six years of his childhood in China. He graduated from Davidson as a member of Phi Beta Kappa and valedictorian of his class. He received his Ph.D. in physical chemistry from UNC-Chapel Hill. White is survived by his wife, Anne; three sons, Steven, Alan, and Brian; and two daughters, Diana White and Helen White.

Campus Job Offers Hit Low

(CPS)—The job market for this year’s college grads isn’t good, and it may even be getting worse. That’s the prognosis offered by placement and employment experts around the country, who add that even the so-called “hot majors”—engineering and computer science students—are getting significantly fewer job offers than their counterparts a year ago.

“The job market is definitely softening for college grads,” observes Jack Shingleton, the placement director at Michigan State University who administers a yearly survey of business college recruiting plans. “Disciplines such as social science, arts and letters, and education are experiencing the greatest underemployment. Even the engineering and computer science majors are not as well off as they were two or three years ago,” he says.

The College Placement Council, a trade association of campus placement offices, reports job offers to June grads declined for the first time in six years in 1982. The U.S. Department of Labor says high school and college unemployment has hit 14.4 percent, up from 13.7 percent a year ago.

“The job opportunities are just not there,” says William Heartwell Jr., executive vice-president of the Interstate Conference of Employment Securities Agencies. “Companies have had to cut back drastically. For the first time we are seeing college graduates working in jobs that are trainee positions.” Employers and placement experts blame the recession. Hundreds of top corporations have instituted hiring freezes, cut back on the number of college grads they employ, and cancelled their college recruitment programs.

College Costs Zoom

New York (CPS)—The total cost of going to college—including tuition, room, board, supplies, transportation, and personal expenses—has jumped by as much as 13 percent for some students this fall, according to a survey by the College Board’s College Scholarship Service. The survey of some 3300 colleges predicts students at four-year public campuses will spend an average of $4338 to go to school this year, a 13 percent increase over last year’s expenses. Private college and university students will spend an average of $7475 to make it through the 1982-83 academic year, an 11 percent hike over 1981-82, the study found.

Soaring tuition rates are the main reasons. Tuition is up an average of 20 percent at public colleges, and 13 per-
