Mr. J. B. Johnston Will Talk at Vespers Nov. 9
Was Member of O. D. K. and Center on 1901 Football Team

Davidson students, faculty, and townspeople will be interested to learn that Mr. J. B. Johnston, superintendent of Barium Springs Orphanage and an ardent alumnus of Davidson, will speak next Sunday afternoon at the “Y” vesper service, at 6 o'clock.

Throughout his stay at Davidson, and since he left her portals, Mr. “Joe” has ever proved to be a loyal and loving adherent to the college and what it stands for. In the year 1901, Mr. Johnston played center on the Davidson eleven and, as his contemporaries assert, his value to the team was inestimable. According to tradition, Mr. Johnston attended college at a time when “men were men,” more than ever before; and the story has been told by Mr. Johnston himself, that upon one occasion, when it seemed that one of the opposing team was headed for the zero line, and with a clear field in front of him, that he (Mr. Johnston) pulled off his helmet and heaved it with all his might at the fleeing opponent, striking him squarely on the back of his head, dropping him as neatly as any tackle could have, and saving the day for the home team.

Among other things, Mr. Johnston was a member of Omicron Delta Kappa. He has had influential positions in the management of several industrial enterprises and since then has directed notably the affairs of Barium Springs. He has even been mentioned for Governor of North Carolina. He recently received an invitation from President Hoover to attend a discussion at the White House, in which he will participate as a representative of the Child Welfare Association of the South.

The Princeton University Ivy Club has hung a portrait of a waiter who in thirty years is reputed scarcely ever to have forgotten a man’s tastes.

Miss Carman Barnes, 16, who wrote “School Girl,” was dismissed from the Gardner School in New York after the book was published.

The Best Thing Out

It can be truly said of Fire that it is the best thing out. There’s trouble when it starts; more trouble when it’s burning; and most trouble after it’s out—unless you have enough Fire Insurance fully to replace the damaged and destroyed property. This agency sells the safest Stock Fire Insurance out, and is glad to make certain you won't be out money after the fire is out.

Davidsonian Staff Picks Best Papers

Perhaps this year The Davidsonian has been the recipient of more exchanges than have ever come to the staff of this paper in the past. There are between thirty and forty university, college, and prep school papers on the mailing list, thus necessitating the formation of a new department. This department is enthusiastic about the work and believes that a great deal of benefit will accrue from these exchanges.

The editorial staff has released a list of the five papers which it deems to have been the best placed regularly in the hands of the exchange department during the month of October. These are named in the order of their excellence: The Emory Wheel, Emory University; The Targum, Rutgers University; The Gettysburgian, Gettysburg College; The Orange and White, University of Tennessee; The Agonistic, Agnes Scott College. Of course, there were other papers worthy of mention, but these five top the list.

PRESS CONVENTION
(Continued from page 1)

the next convention, which will be some time in the spring, 1931. It is thought, though not definitely decided upon, that Davidson and Queens-Chicora colleges will act as hosts. The new officers will be elected at that time. The convention adjourned at 11 o'clock Saturday morning. The Davidson delegates were: Bob King, treasurer; Bill Lea, Quips and Cranks; Sam Wiley, Davidsonian; Ben Mosely, Quips and Cranks; Archie Baker, Davidsonian; Croswell Ragin, “The Yowl”; Archie Henderlite, “The Yowl.”

PLANS FOR LIBRARY
(Continued from page 1)

large number of books received in the next three years, this of course, includes the statement made above concerning the shelves, tables, and lighting, so that books will be available for immediate use. The second end that is being studied is the possibility of a new library building for the college. The building will be adequately endowed if such a plan were to materialize. Dr. Wilson sent a tentative report to the college before his final report last night. It dealt with the question of re-arrangement of the present library and a budget for support. All these plans are being given due consideration by the library committee and their decision will be learned at a later date.

There is an automobile in the United States for every four and one-half persons. Blasting and riveting, the two loudest sounds in cities today, are 10,000,000 times more intense than the smallest sounds that can be detected by the human ear. People with salaries of below $675 a year in England pay in taxes each year a total of $950,000,000. Curfew, in accordance with an ancient custom, is sounded by four blasts on a horn at 9 o’clock every night in the market place of Ripon, England. Of the 53,627 Civil War pensioners remaining, 5,000 are totally helpless or blind.

WOFFORD TERRIERS
(Continued from page 1)

The Terriers twice drove the ball inside the 20-yard line but lacked the punch to penetrate the Blue Stocking wall for the needed points. The next weekend the Terriers reached the heights by holding a powerful Duke University eleven to two touchdowns. The Blue Devils were forced to display their full bag of tricks and their best brand of football down in Spartanburg that Saturday. The Terriers clicked like a real machine for the first time during the season, holding the Blue Devils in check the first period and battling on even terms with them. Reverse plays which defeated Davidson earlier in the season soon proved the downfall of Wofford, too, with Bill Murray leading the way. Last Saturday Wofford bit off more than they could chew and went down in defeat before the greatest Auburn eleven in many a day. The Plainsmen were complete masters of the tussle at all times and at no time did Wofford even threaten the goal. Coach Tommy Scaffe, former Navy player, and Jack Frost, who used to return punts for The Citadel, have the largest squad to ever turn out at Wofford, including ten lettermen and a host of brilliant Sophs from last year’s excellent Freshman team. Among those returning were Loren King, all-state tackle; Willis and Fox, stellar backfield men, and the veteran ends, Carroll and Meyers. The Sophomores have made three or four regular posts on the team. The probable starting line-up will be: Left end, Rushton; left tackle, Gleaton; left guard, Meyers; center, C. Jackson; right guard, R. Berry; right tackle, King; right end, Carroll; quarter, L. Jackson; left half, Fox; right half, Scott; full, Berry.

“Y” DEPUTATION

apologized for his singing, saying that he had a bad case of tonsillitis. At supper that night Charlie Sisson and Stuart Meacham went over to Grandfather Orphanage, where about 65 children are cared for, and told stories and talked to the little folks. Shortly after this a young people’s meeting was held. That night Carl Pritchett spoke. He also held a service Sunday morning at Crossnore. On Monday morning Charlie Sisson talked at chapel, concluding the series of services held. Immediately after chapel the deputation started back for Davidson. It is interesting to note that on the way back they stopped at the Appalachian State Teachers’ College and made plans for the deputation to be sent there in the near future.

Professor Rostovtsef, of Yale University, has discovered that beer originated in the Rhineland town of Treves. A religious analysis of the 7,000 students who attended Cleveland College last year gives the lie to the oft-repeated statement that college students are Godless, according to Dr. A. Caswell Ellis, director of the college. Three American universities—Columbia, California and Chicago—have been honored by the allied armies veterans of the World War for “distinguished accomplishments in the cause of peace.”
