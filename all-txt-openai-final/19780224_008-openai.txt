Not so Average Stereotyped Nigger

You secretly wish you could shoot all the wine-heads
on the corner ‘cause you hate being labeled for the
stupid stuff they pull.

And when they pass the bottle your way you feel the
urge to vomit ’cause, naw, it ain’t cool to “mack and
lean” on a dingy corner in the cold autumn wind and,
naw, it ain’t the politics, baby, of nothing.

When you hear the fat white men talking ’bout their
being tired of supporting “those” people on welfare,
you want to yell at the top of your lungs “Look, I
work and dream of the day my kids will go to college, too!”
Yeah, you want to prove you ain’t your average stereotyped
nigger.

...and when your kids don’t happen to be smart as a
whip you're still proud and show them love ’cause your
Christmases are happy anyway...
