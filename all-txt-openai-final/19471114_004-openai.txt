Wildcat Sports — CATS REST

Wild day with the Wildcats taking the day off tomorrow for some much-deserved rest. It is a propitious time to look at the Southern Conference standings and see how the teams stack up in conference play. We will also stick our necks out by hazarding a few guesses as to the final outcome.

It is an especially propitious week for Davidson to glance at the ratings since the Wildcats’ win over Richmond moved them three rungs up the conference ladder. Duke is leading the league in conference play if not in season records. Their drubbing by Missouri in their Homecoming tilt has no influence on conference play in which they are undefeated, having whipped State, Maryland, and Wake Forest. It is, though, an indication of what we think will happen when Duke meets Carolina next week. If Duke bows to North Carolina, they will come out even with the Tar Heels in their season average. If the Blue Devils take Carolina, they will be the only undefeated team in the conference.

The same quirk of statistical fate may put William and Mary ahead of both Carolina and Duke, although the Indians lost to the Blue Devils. They play eight conference games, more than any other team, and promise to come out in the end suffering only from the Tar Heel tilt. Carolina, having only played three conference games, ranks sixth in conference rating, and will tie Duke for second place if they can win next Saturday. If not, they will sink into the company with a 5-2 average.

Washington and Lee, now in third place, will bow before William and Mary's onslaught and come out with a 3-2 average. Maryland, fourth placer, is riding for a fall when she meets Carolina tomorrow and will come out 3-2 also. South Carolina will bow to both Duke and Wake Forest and wind up way down the line with a 4-2 record. Wake Forest will most likely beat State and South Carolina to wind up with a 7-4 average. Wake Forest, an off team, beat both Carolina and William and Mary and lost to Duke. They are three touchdowns better than State.

On a clear day, V.P.I. should take the next two, winding up even with Wake Forest. They face Richmond and V.M.I. State will hold their .500 average by dropping one to Wake Forest and taking Maryland by a slight margin. V.M.I. will beat Citadel and lose to V.P.I., to come out ahead with a 2-3 record. Davidson will break even at .500 with three wins and a tie for seven scraps. This gives them wins over Citadel and Furman.

The Furman game continues to stand out as the game of the year for the Wildcats. It marks the difference between an even record and losing one in loop statistics. Barring another upset—which you may be sure the Cats won't allow—the season overall record will go to the .500 mark without a victory over Furman. However, the Cats will go all out to take Furman. Furman has lost five games and won over The Citadel and Wofford. Wofford gave the Red and Black a scare, but the Cats always fight better when they fight and they weren’t too worried about Wofford. Furman will be celebrating Homecoming and spoiling for revenge for last year’s 13-7 defeat. Their team is somewhat better this year and profiting by experience against Georgia, V.P.I., Florida, and Georgia Tech. After meeting Georgia next Saturday, they may not be in too good shape by the following Thursday. We call it a Davidson victory, though by no means a hot one, more than one touchdown.

The result of our fantastic predictions in conference results is: William and Mary first, Duke and Carolina tied for second, Wake Forest and V.P.I. tied in third place, Davidson, N.C. State, and South Carolina tied at the .500 mark, ahead of V.M.I., Furman, and Richmond, with Citadel and George Washington winning none in the conference.

CATS OVERPOWER SPIDERS IN FIRST CONFERENCE WIN

By DICK MORGAN

The Red and Black of Davidson College found the fourth invasion of Virginia soil highly pleasing as they turned in their most creditable performance to date in downing a fighting University of Richmond 13-7. This was the Wildcats’ first Southern Conference win wherein the Cats could lay claim to complete victory. This struggle not only outplayed but also held the heavier Spider lads in all statistical departments, showing great superiority.

That accounted for the Cats’ 19 points, but Bobby Long took ninth place, Bill Plonk tenth, and Murray Remson twelfth, thus leav- ing Fort Bragg the remaining four places and their many points.

With Gray, Bradley and Grube in top form, the Wildcats have been given a good chance to grab top honors in the family meet, though North Carolina and Duke are being set as the teams to beat. Montgomery and McKeithen have also established themselves as run- ners of some port and can be counted on for positions not too far back.

The game was a costly one, however, as they lost the services of Springer Hoskins, who was car- ried from the field with a painful knee injury late in the game.

Read's coffin corner kicking was too much for the Kappas. They sel- dom got out of their own territory.

This final game will probably be the toughest one on the schedule with the exception of the Catawba B tilt which the Kittens lost at the first of the sea- son. Last week's 13-7 defeat over Blue Ridge on rain soaked Richard- son Field was no indication of the offensive power of the Kittens Blue Ridge Downed Taking advantage of an early fumble on the part of the Jayvees, Blue Ridge capitalized on their break by scoring their first and only touchdown of the game in the early minutes. Recovering a fumble on Davidson's twenty they bulled their way over repeatedly until they reached the double stripe. The point was good and Blue Ridge held a first quarter 7-0 lead. The Kittens came right back in the second quarter to score on a long drive with tailback Wood Leach going over on an off-tackle. Brown's attempted conversion was no good and Barium lead until the final quarter. Fourth Quarter Tally A steady driving rain made the Kitten pass attack inoperative with only one out of two passes com- pleted. Leach’s flat pass to Leach, end, was good for ten yards to mark the only completed pass of the afternoon. Once more in the final quarter, a kitten drive paid off and again Leach went over on an off-tackle jaunt through the secondary. Brown's kick was good to give the “dawgs” a scant 13-7 margin which they held without dif- ficulty during the final minutes of play. The Jayvee running attack dominated the game with Blue Ridge flaring up only once to score on a break. Wood, Leach and full- back Murray Ashman did most of the Wildkittens’ line bucking. Out- standing on the defense was Wing- back Charlie Baldwin. In the line Al Guthrie, Ed Small, and Grover Lee looked good.
