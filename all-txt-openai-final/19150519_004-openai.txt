DR. LAFFERTY URGES ALUMNI TO RETURN
Many things are happening at Davidson that are of interest not only to the present student body, but also to everyone who knows the college and who has a warm spot in his heart for the old town. We would like for you to keep in close touch with the college and the happenings on the campus, and there is no better way to do this than to subscribe for this paper, unless you visit the campus once a week. And speaking of visiting the campus, is it not possible to visit it at least once a year? Come this year to Commencement and let us make it the biggest Alumni Commencement in the history of the college. Are you not still loyal to the college? Are you not interested in hearing of the success in clean athletics and in the debates with other colleges? Are you not interested in learning something of the improvements and plans for bigger and better things that are on foot? Take The Davidsonian and come to Commencement and you will be glad. Don’t Knock, Boost!
Rost. H. Lafferty, Pres. Alumni Association.

ALUMNI REUNIONS.
The Class of 1914 will endeavor to have a full reunion at Commencement. J. R. McGregor and H. L. Eliot have sent out the call to their classmates.

Dr. Lafferty, President of the Alumni Association, writes as follows: “Why do you not attend Commencement? Because so few of the fellows are back? There would be none back if all did like you and said that. Get up a crowd of your classmates and chums and come again and a room will be yours. Because there is nothing to interest me? Come and make something ‘be doing.’ Read at another place the Commencement program, and see if you cannot come and help make it a great Commencement.”

At a recent meeting of the live Alumni chapter in Atlanta, the following officers were elected: H. L. Parry, president; T. Hill, vice-president; H. C. Caldwell, secretary and treasurer. This chapter has on its rolls nearly fifty members, scattered all over Georgia. About thirty-five live in Atlanta.
