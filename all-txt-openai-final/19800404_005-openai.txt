Davidson Lacks Academic Reputation Up North

Rick Johnston

Why isn’t the academic excellence of Davidson familiar to those outside the South? There are many people in the Northern
and western parts of the U.S. who have heard of Davidson, but most associate the college with basketball and other
sports. Where I live (Connecticut), few know of Davidson's academic reputation. These people have either known a Davidson student, have
heard of the College Bowl, or have previously lived in the South.

In North Carolina and surrounding states, the reverse is true. Academics far outshine athletics. Athletic programs at the University of
North Carolina, Duke, Wake Forest, and N.C. State cast a large shadow over Davidson athletics. Even in the Charlotte area,
UNCC and J.C. Smith seem to push Davidson off the front page in the sports section of the Observer.

Why does athletic reputation supersede academic reputation outside the South while the reverse is true inside the South? One answer
can be seen in the composition of our student body. I surveyed athletes and scholars to find out where they
came from and found some interesting results. I looked at five of the most established sports programs at Davidson: football,
basketball, baseball, tennis, and swimming. With that, I compared two of the best-known scholarship programs: the Edward Crosland Stuart and
the Charles A. Dana programs. Each group is divided into area students (those who come from North Carolina and surrounding
states: South Carolina, Virginia, Georgia, and Tennessee) and non-area students.

| Group | Area Students | Non-area Students |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|
| Entire College | 62% | 38% |
| Basketball | 14% | 86% |
| Baseball* | 43% | 57% |
| Swimming* | 58% | 42% |
| Tennis | 42% | 58% |
| Football | 44% | 56% |
| Stuart scholars | 75% | 25% |
| 1979 Stuart finalists | 88% | 12% |
| Dana scholars* | 70% | 30% |

*Freshmen not included.

These statistics show that the scholars are generally from within our area while the athletes are not. This may help
to answer my previous question. I think students are a major factor in making Davidson's reputation. If a star athlete
comes to Davidson, our athletic reputation is enhanced in that athlete’s hometown. On the other hand, if an outstanding student
comes here, Davidson's academic reputation benefits in his region, especially if the student chooses a career in law, medicine, etc.

Why don’t more outstanding students from the North and West apply here? The application deadline for the Stuart Scholarships comes
too early in a student's senior year of high school (October) for most prospectives outside of the North Carolina area
to have even heard of Davidson College, much less of the scholarships.

War Sacrifices Morality

Emily Partin

Among those who may find themselves participating in a war, I don’t think a majority of them consider human life
expendable. For many of us, this question already has an obvious answer. The crucial question is this: how can we
as individuals relate our beliefs to life in our society? We are citizens of a state, we are individuals living
in a world in which not everyone acts in accordance with their beliefs, and in which people and nations are
often cruel.inhumane, and violent. Therefore, as one who is attempting to come to grips with the idea of conscientious objection
and the decisions that this involves, I phrase the question in this way: to what extent ought I to compromise
or subordinate my beliefs to the political situation of the modern world, specifically when it comes to the question of
participation in war?

So we have two problems: 1) a disproportionate number of athletes from outside this area, and 2) a disproportionate number
of scholars from within our area. Can this question be answered? It is very difficult to get local athletes accepted
at Davidson. Recruiters must resort to area prep schools (which are relatively few in number) or to high schools outside
this area to find potential athletes. The second problem hurts us far more. Davidson has little academic reputation in the
North and West, and it is difficult to get outstanding students from these regions.

What does it do to our world when our society as a whole orders its values in this way? To
the person who says that if there were not people in our society willing to abandon their beliefs when necessary
we would have problems, I reply that if and when those people in our society who do hold certain convictions
must totally abandon them for questions of political expediency and military strategic advantage, are not the implications even more severe
and the problems even greater?

2. If a conventional war starts, it is difficult to see how it can avoid escalating into a nuclear war.
Unless it’s one of those wars that drag on forever, sooner or later one side is going to find itself
losing. With its back against the wall, and with the advantage that lies in “going first” in a nuclear exchange,
the losing side could quite possibly yield to the temptation to use its nuclear weapons. It doesn’t have to begin
with as big a step as employing large, long-range strategic weapons; exchanges of very heavy weapons.

3. When trying to determine to what extent one ought to go along with an immoral action that other people
may consider unfortunate but necessary, there is another question which must be considered. Not only is there the issue of
abandoning one’s personal conscience—there is also the question “What is the best way that I can serve my country?” I
don’t think conscientious objection necessarily implies a “holier than thou” attitude in which the person is thinking “I have to
keep my hands clean while other people get theirs dirty,” self-righteously setting himself above the rest of society. Conscientious objection
has a positive meaning: The refusal to participate in war is not necessarily just an effort to keep one’s slate
clean, it can also be a positive statement which says that war, killing, and emphasis on militarism is bad for
our society and the best way that I can help better society is by refusing to participate in war.

We must redefine what “national defense” means. Our conventional understanding of what constitutes defense and national security must be modified
now that we are threatened by nuclear weapons.
