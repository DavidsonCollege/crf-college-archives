We like to see the boys looking forward to something beyond high school. (Prof.) A. S. Cummins, Principal.

LETTER FROM PROF. CUMMINS TO PATRONS OF SCHOOL:
I have often felt a great need in my work as a teacher, of a closer union and greater co-operation
between teacher and patrons. I believe that this need can be partially met and the necessary co-operation greatly increased by
a town paper in the columns of which reports, just to the progress of the school and other items of
interest, may be read by the patrons. The Davidsonian has kindly offered to serve us in this manner. I therefore
hope that it is read every week in every Davidson family, so that patrons may know more about the school,
its successes and failures, its equipment, and its needs. I hope that we may have a patriotic meeting in the
near future. Since September we have installed the new library in neat bookcases and have had several nice benches built
in the school yard. Both of these improvements are very beneficial.

HONOR ROLL OF THE DAVIDSON GRADED SCHOOL:

Distinctively modeled in the latest Metropolitan styles—custom tailored.To the children, Miss Stewart, Tiny Torrence, Anna Sig, and the benches are
especially appreciated. Another improvement is the ditching done by Uncle Mat. This has saved Fourth Grade the yard from washing.

At the last program, besides several good songs and recitations, there was a hotly contested discussion of the advantages of
city and country life. At the next meeting, the debaters will discuss Woman Suffrage, with three girls speaking in favor
of it and three boys opposing. This promises to be an interesting debate.

Recently, one of our boys, Mr. Carl Cathey, went to Lincolnton to stand the examination for West Point. He loves
his home in Florida. He does not expect to return to college. Lane had become almost indispensable in the running
of the popular semi-weekly "movies," and will be missed there as well as in his Rumple haunts. L. P. Smith
will run the reels now on "movie" nights.
