**Staley Speaker Lectures On Christian Conversion**

By HEIDI HOOKER

The Staley Distinguished Christian Scholar Lecture Program featured Dr. John Mulder speaking on “The Roots and Fruits of Conversion” last Wednesday and Thursday nights.

Mulder began his Wednesday night lecture by discussing the approach and process of developing *Conversions*, published in 1983. His research required collecting first-hand conversion experiences, of which he ended up with 50 of great variety, to help him understand the richness of the conversion experience.

His overall lecture theme concerned the two emphases inherent in the Christian faith: the centrality of conversion and the mystery or variety of conversion. He made frequent references to the Gospel and other historical testimonies associated with the conversion experience.

Mulder presented his perspective on the different types of conversion, accounting for the difficulty of differentiation since all genres do somewhat overlap. He discussed dramatic, gradual, wholly intellectual, moral or ethical, and aesthetic conversion and their characteristics. He explained that though dramatic conversions are the most popular in literary accounts, the gradual, wholly intellectual, and moral conversions are significant and more common though less apt to publishing.

Mulder also explained that the aesthetic conversion, in which one converts in reaction to or realization of the beauty of God and His grace as revealed in nature or the arts, is one of the least appreciated dimensions of the church and religious attitudes today. He pointed out the “impoverishment of the religious experience...” because we rely so heavily on the sermon to communicate and ignore the aesthetic.

As a model of conversion, Mulder chose one of the three accounts of Paul’s experience from the book of Acts. He stressed understanding the nature of conversion with the metaphor of the journey represented in this account. On this journey away from home, “God’s grace breaks in on one’s life,” Jesus confronts one, and the person reorients their life, being converted or “turned around.” Mulder related such a conversion experience to adolescents away from home.

Resistance and depression were also pointed out in the lecture as characteristic of the conversion process. Mulder described the experience as a “bucking against the force of grace until one finally submits.” The conversion resulting is a “private experience of God’s grace... in isolation from the world,” which Mulder describes with the image of “scales falling from the eyes.” However, Mulder believes that conversion is mediated through persons so that “we are not saved by ideas but by a person who helps us come to terms with the reality of God.”

In reference to his work on the book *Conversions: The Christian Experience*, which he edited with Hugh Kerr, Mulder lectured on the phenomenon of conversion, focusing on its process, types, and characteristics.

Presently, Mulder is president and professor of historical theology at Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary in Kentucky. In addition, he acts as an ordained minister in the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) and now resides on...the Editorial Council on Theology Today, of which he has also been a member of the writing staff. He received his A.B. from Hope College in Holland, Michigan and his M.Div. and Ph.D. from Princeton University, where he and College President John Kuykendall were colleagues. Mulder served as Associate Professor of American Church History at Princeton Theological Seminary. He was general editor of the volume series The Library of Living Faith, published by Westminster Press, and he has been author and editor of several books and essays on theology and church history. This was Mulder’s second visit to Davidson. Mulder made himself available for his two-day stay to speak with students and meet with the CROP organization and Religion 141. His book Conversion: The Christian Experience is available in the bookstore.

DERS Provides Quick, Essential Service
By MARGOT MIMS

Your roommate falls off the top bunk bed and complains of a broken arm. What do you do? Call DERS (Davidson Emergency Rescue Service, an on-campus, student-run organization) at 892-3031. The nurse on duty will request the following information — location, mechanism of injury, and a call-back number — and then will proceed to dispatch a DERS crew. Within three minutes of the call, two qualified Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT) and one trainee will arrive at the reported location. The remaining steps involve putting the arm in a splint, in this particular case, stabilizing the patient, and calling the ambulance. In short, DERS not only saves its patients valuable time, but also offers its services free of charge.

According to senior Olivier Van Dierdonck, the administration has really been supportive. Last year, Van Dierdonck, the president of DERS, requested financial aid in order to update some dilapidated equipment. The Dean of Students office granted his request. The police department reserves a 24-hour parking space for the DERS squad car, Van Dierdonck said. He points out, “All Davidson students should have the minimum reading capacity to read our Emergency Vehicle Only sign.”

The unmistakable trust between DERS and the administration stems from the reliability and competence of each member on the squad. Presently, twenty-two students participate in DERS. Half of the students hold a current EMT certificate and the remainder are trainees. To obtain an EMT certificate, one must take a 120-hour EMT state-certified course. This course requires every participant to take a 6-part practical exam and to pass with an 80 average. In order to have a DERS crew on call 24 hours a day, Van Dierdonck assigns different shifts to the members of the squad. Melissa McLemore, Jody Minus, Don O’Malley, and Olivier Van Dierdonck are the elected officers of DERS this year. These four officers stress that all information received about a case remains strictly confidential. If any student would like to become involved with DERS, he or she should contact one of the previously mentioned officers. Van Dierdonck stated that DERS is “a good experience for the student as well as a good service to the college.”
