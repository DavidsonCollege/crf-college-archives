Professors and Students give time to ’96 Olympics
By Erica Thorson

Once again Davidson made its mark; this time it was with Olympic style and flair. As Atlanta showcased itself during the Olympics, so did Davidson, its staff, and its students. Ed and Marlys Daugherty, co-directors of Davidson Outdoors, played an integral role in the Olympic white water slalom event at the Ocoee River in Tennessee. The Daughertys had positions spotting on the venue announcing team where they updated the announcers on positions, biographies, and the times of the paddlers. According to Ed, “It was really exciting to be part of an event that size.” What impressed the Daughertys most was the appreciation that the fans gave all the athletes, not just the Americans.

Freshmen experience an all new Odyssey

More incoming freshmen than ever were able to fun-duck through rapids named “Jaws” and “Death,” hike the Appalachian Trail despite blisters and backbreaking backpacks, and dig holes in the ground as makeshift toilets this summer when Davidson’s Odyssey program celebrated its 10th anniversary. As far back as the fall of 1986, 13 students embarked upon a weekend experience, marking the first Odyssey Session. The following year, 1987, the first summer session led 54 students in five crews. This summer a total of 115 incoming freshmen were able to participate in the program, which used a lottery system to select participants when applicants outnumbered available openings in past years. In the past, the Odyssey has always been held during the week prior to Freshmen Orientation. This year Davidson Outdoors tried a different approach to running the Odyssey, by offering five Odyssey sessions throughout the summer. “The experience for all participants was greatly improved from the previous years. All the sessions were essentially the same, but each individual trip had its own special events and memories,” says Ed Daugherty, Co-Chair of Davidson Outdoors. With an increase in the size of the program, the total cost for the Odyssey went up. The Dean of Student Office helped out in the area of financial aid by offering full and partial Odyssey Scholarships. Because of this aid, eight students who otherwise would not have been able to participate were awarded money for the program.

[Report] changed the weight of some of the variables. A press release sent out by U.S. News last Thursday confirms that the methodology used to rank schools this year differs from last year. The release states, this year’s “rankings are not directly comparable to last year’s.” Regardless of Davidson’s eleventh place finish this year, Kelton says, “I don’t think the ratings tell you much about the quality of an education ... I’m confident that this is not a good way to pick a college.” Davidson College President John Kuykendall says of Davidson’s much improved finish, “It is nice to be included in such good company.”Another big change was the decision to pay trip leaders. Previously, students led Odyssey trips and participated in the program’s logistical operations on a volunteer basis. “It was a lot of work organizing 5 sessions, but the trip leaders were so organized and systematic that the preparation for each session became fairly predictable and easy,” says Ed Daugherty. Odyssey trip leader Katie Lannon, a sophomore, says, “It was much more professional having trained leaders.” Leaders were housed in Lingle Manor throughout the summer and were personally trained by Ed and Marlys Daugherty.

Ed believes such unbiased support is “truly the Olympic experience.” Many Davidson students were also key factors at the Olympics. Freshman Jennie Hillmann was an Olympic torch bearer in Wake Forest, North Carolina. Nominated and chosen by a national board, Jennie says, “It was a lot of fun. The whole town was watching, and I never have felt so important in my life.”

Kate Stevens, a junior, was in Atlanta this summer as a production intern for the Olympics’ opening and closing ceremonies. Her job included rehearsal operations and field marking. “It was amazing,” Stevens says. “At one point I was down on my knees spelling out Atlanta with markers, and then I was filming it spelled out by actual people. It was neat knowing that I had a part in it.”

“Being a part of the Olympics was an awesome experience,” agrees freshman Angela Fisher, who worked in the Olympic Village as a front desk supervisor. “Everyone I worked with was really cool. They were from all over the world, and because of this, I learned a lot from them.”

Along with its student body, Davidson College was also able to showcase its new facilities. Both the Canadian and German volleyball teams trained at the Baker Sports Complex before traveling to Atlanta. Lee Sargent, Davidson’s Game Management Director, coordinated this event and was also able to travel to Atlanta to see one of the games. He was most impressed by the spirit that everyone involved showed for the Olympic experience.
