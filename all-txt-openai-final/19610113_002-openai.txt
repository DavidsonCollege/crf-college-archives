**A Plan: Student Evaluation**

Dr. George B. Watts retires this year. Dr. Watts, professor of French, has a professional reputation second to none on
the Davidson faculty. Not content with reputation, he is also a fine teacher. At 70, he looks 60 and has
the vigor of a man of 50. He is a dynamic personality, a dynamic teacher. He is certainly a member
of that mythical 95 percent that takes a dynamic interest in the entire curriculum. But Dr. Watts is 70 and
around here you have to retire at 70. Maybe he wants to retire, but that's beside the point. The point
is that age is a relative thing. Milton was reading Greek at eight; Grandma Moses was 90 when she began
painting. Davidson has a few professors far on the sunny side of 70 who should have been put out to
pasture long ago. Hard and fast rules sometimes hinder rather than help. So what's the solution? We would suggest at
least one solution — and this would apply not only to when aging professors should be retired, but to when
poor professors should be fired. Why not let second-semester seniors evaluate professors in their major course? No one knows better
than a student who has taken courses in a department for four years which professors in the department are getting
their courses across. We don’t suggest that seniors, in effect, should be given the power to do away with teachers
who supposedly are not doing a good job. We feel strongly, however, that the students are most closely associated with
faculty members in their primary function — teaching. After all, the dean of faculty and other members of the administration
don't attend classes. We believe that they need a little help in deciding who's doing his job and who isn't.

**A Beer, A Gallon of Gas**

"I deem it the public duty of every man to devote a certain portion of his income for charitable purposes;
and that it is his further duty to see it does the most good of which it is capable." —
Thomas Jefferson

Jefferson doubtless would scoff at us. Davidson's 1960 Christmas Gift Fund, according to YMCA President Jim Richardson, stands this year
at an all-time low total: about $2100. It’s through no fault of the YMCA; an ambitious publicity campaign and fairly
energetic solicitation were carried on before Christmas. The faculty can’t be blamed. Professors set a record in Gift Fund contributions;
a major part of the total is from the faculty. One student wrote a check for fifty dollars. But by
and large, Davidson's notoriously self-indulgent student body (average dance weekend cost: well over three thousand dollars) played a close-handed game
with Gift Fund solicitors. The Gift Fund total is less than half the goal set by the YMCA. But we
have a second chance. Solicitation will be reopened after examinations in an all-out drive to better our 1960 Christmas showing.
If every Davidson student gives the price of one pack of cigarettes, the total will jump to about $2400. If,
in addition, every Davidsonian sacrifices the price of one hamburger to the Gift Fund, the total will hop to just
under $3000. The sacrifice of a beer, a gallon of gas — well, you get the idea. Some minor self-denial
by Davidson's over-privileged collegians will mean a major benefit for Madras Boys’ Town. A sacrifice we'll soon forget will mean
a gift those kids in India will never forget. Surely it’s worth it. We can afford to double this year’s
Fund, perhaps to triple it. If we remember. If we care. If we’re willing to chase down a solicitor with
check in hand. If we're willing to stage — Christmas in January.

**The “Radiator” Plan**

Davidson’s famous “Ten-Year Plan,” rapidly nearing the halfway mark, has proved a spectacular success. The Dana Science Laboratories, Richardson Dormitory,
the Cunningham Music and Fine Arts Center, increased endowment and faculty salaries — all are the result of ambitious planning
and energetic work on the part of Dr. D. Grier Martin and his administration. Significant — and visible — progress
has been made in almost every phase of the eight-point program launched in 1957. But one important project remains to
be tackled. It’s the call for “a program of distinguished visiting professors” who would reside on campus for a semester
or a year, teaching and speaking. Other excellent schools have sponsored such programs with great success; notably Amherst where visiting
professor Robert Frost once described his job “as being a sort of poetic radiator.” The only progress we've seen toward
such a program at Davidson is a somewhat cautious statement recently in an administration report: “A system of visiting distinguished
professors — leaders in all fields of liberal arts education — could serve as a stimulus to the kind of
scholarship and intellectual growth which makes a campus attractive to outstanding classroom teachers.” Could? In our opinion, there’s no doubt
about it. The Reynolds Lectures are an excellent innovation. But three days of Archibald MacLeish are not enough. We need
some intellectual “radiators” — and the sooner, the better.

**The ROTC’s Harsh Proposal**

The ROTC department is considering a change in its drill attendance requirements as follows: any cadet who cuts drill will
have five points subtracted from his final semester grade unless he is on a college-sponsored trip or has a medical
excuse from classes for the entire day. The proposed change has been made because many cadets are taking most of
their ROTC cuts at drill instead of in the classroom. We agree with the ROTC department that it is necessary
to have men present if one is going to conduct “leadership laboratory.” But the proposed change will enact too severe
a punishment on anyone who cuts drill. The department is overestimating the value of drill if it feels a cadet
cannot miss it one time during a semester. We think the average Davidson student is proficient enough to overcome an
absence from the repetition of the manual of arms and parade practice. Since the main problem is the absence at
drill of MS I and MS II cadets, we suggest that the ROTC department limit the underclassmen cadets to five
cuts instead of the present eight. Since these students usually take at least two class cuts a semester, they could
then take only one drill cut and the existing problem would be remedied. Enough hostility now exists in the student
body against ROTC requirements without aggravating the situation by adopting this unnecessarily harsh proposal.

**Discretion Still Needed In Drinking, Trask Says**

By GEORGE TRASK

(Editor's Note: George Trask is First Vice-President of the student body. He has devoted a great deal of attention to
the student regulations as a member of the Council committee on the student body constitution.)

After many years of rationalization and hypocrisy the student body has finally given up all attempts to enforce the “under
the influence” clause of the Student Body Constitution. Until the recent amendment every student was bound by duty and every
member of the Student Council and the Honor Court was bound by honor oath to report violations of this clause.
It has now been repealed, leaving a situation and implications of which I believe most students are unaware. In the
first place I must emphasize that the amendment affects only student-body regulations, that is, the set of rules self-imposed and
self-enforced by the students themselves through their constitution.

**FACULTY**

The faculty has in no way changed its position toward drinking, meaning that the ages-old faculty rule against returning to
school “under the influence” still remains in effect. Actually, then, all students have done is to inform the faculty that
from now on they are not going to turn over to the Honor Court a fellow student if he returns
to school tipsy from downing one too many at Hattie’s. This situation has existed for as long as I have
been at Davidson and probably for many years before my arrival. Everyone knows that the chances of being caught “under
the influence” are very slim, primarily because nobody, no student at least, is going to report him. The amendment merely
makes the student attitude official.

**ENFORCEMENT**

Difficulty of enforcement is the main reason for removal of the “under the influence” clause, I believe. In a student
body where drinking is practiced by well over 50 percent of the members and condoned by almost all the rest,
the Student Council agreed unanimously that eventhey themselves were unwilling to uphold a rule which prohibited a student from returning
to his room after drinking alcoholic beverages. In fact, it was the Student Council who initiated the proposal resulting in
striking out the “under the influence” clause. Moreover, by admitting their own lack of support for the clause, the Student
Council felt that they were compromising their honor pledge to uphold student-body regulations, thereby weakening the entire honor system. The
vagueness of the phrase “under the influence” has made this consideration important. It has allowed so much freedom of interpretation
that no Student Council or Honor Court member within the past three years has reported a violation of the clause.

RUNNING AWAY
In fact, they have actually been running away from suspected offenders, soothing their consciences with such rationalizations as “well, I
really didn’t see him,” or “he may just have a fever or the like.” I have no doubts whatsoever that
the Student Council, Honor Court, and most other members of the student body aim to keep Davidson an alcohol-free campus.
Left as a student regulation is the potent rule imposing a penalty of dismissal from college against any student “guilty
of drinking alcoholic liquors or having the same in his possession on the campus.” It works: several students have been
dismissed in recent years under its provisions.

MORE COPS
I further have no doubts that the faculty, if it so desired, could enforce vigorously its rule prohibiting a student
from “... being under the influence of an alcoholic beverage while within the town limits of Davidson ...” simply by
hiring a half-dozen more Cop Linkers and kicking out any student who puts his foot on the campus with alcohol
on his breath. This solution seems hardly likely, however, as the size of the student body would undoubtedly dwindle until
only a nucleus of teetotalers remained.

Far more likely nevertheless is the possibility that the faculty will attempt some sort of tightening of controls over the
student's off-campus drinking habits. Lack of student support and enforcement will be a definite handicap to effective control, however. Without
offering any arguments either for or against the practice of drinking, I do believe that it is becoming every year
a more nearly universally accepted social custom. In approaching the drinking problem, the faculty is going to have to take
that consideration into account. On the other hand, the student body has no reason to rejoice over any newly-created anti-prohibition
measures as a result of their constitutional amendment. Maturity, sound judgment, and discretion are needed lest someone suddenly find himself
on the outside looking in futilely pleading, “well, I thought we could drink on campus now.”

LETTERS TO THE EDITORS
Byrd Labels Alma Mater A Dated “Funeral March”
Dear Editor:
There is one noticeable lack on our campus that it seems could be remedied easily enough with a little desire
from the right people. The absence of an alma mater is what I am speaking of. Oh, I know that
somewhere in our archives there is a song that is called the Davidson alma mater, but what good is it
if it is never heard? I daresay that 75 percent of our student body does not know the first verse
of that little ditty, or is even sure of the tune. I think it is rather pathetic that at athletic
games and other school gatherings the Davidson alma mater is never sung. My suggestion is this: discard the old-fashioned and
outdated song we have now and have a new one written. We need something with original words, and above all,
with a tune that is catchy enough to raise a few goosebumps. I don't believe this student body is so
sophisticated that it can’t get sentimental once in a while. The funeral march we have now should be thrown out
in favor of a song the student body will want to learn and be proud to sing.

FOCUS: Dean Bailey's Father, 90, Tolerates No Nonsense
By ERVIN DUGGAN
Dean John Bailey’s ninety-year-old father — visiting now in Davidson — is a white-haired, white-mustached version of his son, a
bit smaller, perhaps — with the same alert eyes behind rimless spectacles. He has a booming voice, a big laugh,
a sharp, energetic manner. He's a natty dresser, he wears a dark suit, always — with vest. A retired minister
from Summerton, S. C., the Reverend J. C. Bailey’s penchant for no-nonsense preaching has become legendary. (Once called upon to
pray, he rose with characteristic aplomb, snapped, “Lord, give us strength to fight the devil. Amen.” — and sat down.)
When he reached his late eighties, his prodigious energy became a problem: his sons made him stop driving a car.
“They were afraid I'd kill myself or kill somebody else,” he says, “so now I'm dependent on other people for
my rides.”

We visited him Wednesday. “Sit down close to me, young man,” he said when we entered. “I’m deaf in one
ear and can’t hear with the other.” We discussed education: the decline of pedagogical spankings, an early teacher of his
(“Why, we all hated him — because he made us learn.”) Princeton Seminary ... and Davidson, from which he holds
an honorary degree. “Davidson. You've got a fine institution, so take advantage of it. Study! Don’t just walk up and
down the halls. Why, someday you may be Secretary of State!” “Now, don’t put me on the spot about how
much I studied.” He laughed again. “I didn’t make A’s!”

The conversation moved to current events: the race issue, politics, John F. Kennedy: “Well, I’m no politician. My allegiance is
to the governor of South Carolina and then to the president of the United States. I don’t believe in asking
religious questions to any candidate. Of course, a strict Roman Catholic has a civil as well as a religious allegiance
to Rome. But I don’t think that'll cause Kennedy any trouble. He doesn’t seem to be too hot about his
church, from what I’ve seen.”

He handed down opinions in a rapid-fire volley, lacing his talk with anecdotes, gestures, frequent laughter. On religion: “Religion never
moves in a straight line. It has ups and downs, low points and then revivals. We've got more people in
the churches now than ever before in its history — but that doesn’t mean everybody going to church is converted.”
On Oral Roberts: “That man is a mystery to me. Of course, I believe in faith healing — I’ve seen
people recover that the doctors gave up for lost — but his thing of coming up and breaking your crutches
is beyond me. I wouldn’t recommend it to anybody. But it’s none of my business.” On morals: “I’m a teetotaler
as far as whiskey is concerned. I’ve seen people bound hand and foot by liquor. A terrible thing. People nowadays
are serving it in their homes. I hope you didn’t know that but it’s the truth.” On North Carolina: “Far
inferior to South Carolina, but the longer I stay, the better I like it.”

The afternoon passed too quickly. Soon we were shaking hands ... At the door came his last comment. “I’ve certainly
enjoyed talking to you, young man” — there was a gleam in his eye — “But please don’t quote anything
I said!” And the Reverend Dr. Bailey strode back into the house.

NOSMO KING REPORTS...
Students Use Heads As Exams Approach
Frantic student activity in preparation for exams has rendered another Nosmo King Report inevitable. The pollster has risked life, limb,
and two reviews to bring the campus up to date on dramatic occurrences around the D.

... A tense development has crippled the campus as dormitory provisions for more urgent activity have been usurped by an
increasing number of students who are using them for study carrels. Many a student is on the edge of his
seat as bad feelings mount, especially in the freshman dorms and in Duke, where facilities are limited. One solution to
the problem seems to be the use of “Study Carrel” labels on out-of-order units, to provide for better supply economy
and for maximum use of materiel. The situation threatens to turn the student body into a tribe of head hunters.
I predict stringent Student Council legislation in the near future to protect the student body from friction between hunters and
hoarders. This may also call for a revival of “Better Heads for a Better Davidson,” a movement from near the
heart of the student body last year. Members of the Board of Visitors might be encouraged to bequeath large sums
to provide memorial heads such as the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Head which has been a permanent fixture on 4th floor
East since 1912. A new innovation will, of course, be fake facilities for studying.

I predict a rumor of mono at Salem will stimulate a mass exodus from the campus this weekend as Davidson
men make a last-ditch effort to avoid exams. Hoof-and-mouth is reportedly available at another nearby campus. Incidentally, indigestion has been
particularly successful at the Infirmary during the last week.
