necessary if the family’s financial position should change. In these honorary athletic grants, the college is following the same policy used in establishing the top competitive scholarships at Davidson, which are the Joseph Moore McConnell Scholarships and the Charles A. Dana Scholarships. In the spring of each year subsequent to the freshman year, every student receiving aid based on need has his parents complete a financial statement. Financial need for the following academic year is determined. In some cases, depending on changes in family circumstances, need is greater than for the previous year, and in some cases, need is less.

What happens after the freshman year? A financial aid package is calculated as it is for every other student, and if the student intends to play football for the following year, a supplementary grant may be made to replace all or part of his loan or job offer. Renewal of supplementary grants will be determined in light of the terms of the previous grant. Ordinarily, a renewal supplementary grant will not be smaller than the previous grant.

How much money will be available to football next year for staffing, recruiting, program, and scholarship aid? Each of these items will be subject to study and final recommendation by the Athletic Director in the regular budget-making process. Because of variables such as the need of grant recipients and game expense and income under a new schedule, it will obviously take a year of experience with the new program to get reliable data on which to base future estimates. The Trustee action specifies an intensive recruiting effort, which certainly implies that there should be no reduction in that particular line item. Any increase would hopefully be offset by savings in other line items. As to grants, obligations to football players already in college must continue to be met over the next three years. The Wildcat Club portion of this obligation, and cash grants replacing loan and job portions of new scholarship recipients, should be the primary objective of Wildcat Club funds.

Part 4: Other Sports

Will funds for recruiting and for meeting the full need of participants in other sports be available? Line items for recruiting will not be included in the budgets of each of the other sports. Instead, the Athletic Director will be given a limited amount as a discretionary fund which he can make available to coaches in the minor sports on specific request for specific needs. The dollar amount of this discretionary fund will be determined in the regular budget-making process in relation to other Athletic Department needs. It should be borne in mind that much successful recruiting in the minor sports can be done by letter, telephone, and hospitality to visiting candidates, thereby avoiding travel expense. It is this kind of recruiting that will be emphasized.

Funds to meet the scholarship needs of participants in the other sports will be handled in the same way, i.e., the Athletic Director will be given a limited amount as a discretionary fund which he can make available to coaches in the minor sports on specific request for specific individuals. The dollar amount of this discretionary fund will be determined in the regular budget-making process in relation to other Athletic Department needs. The Trustee action states that such funds will be used only when given specifically for the purpose, implying a designation of a part of Wildcat Club funds, not individual gifts. Encouragement of individual gifts to specific sports would have the undesirable effects of sending the coaches out to solicit funds, and of subjecting potential donors to multiple approaches from members of the athletic staff. When funds are available, the Athletic Director will administer them and make recommendations to the Committee on Admissions and Financial Aid on the basis of specific requests for specific individuals. Such funds are intended for the occasional talented individual who can contribute in a major way to his particular sport and who would not come to Davidson otherwise. Honorary $100 grants for student-athletes who have no need may also be given to outstanding participants in these other sports.

Will the game expense and equipment budgets for the minor sports be increased? Yes. Increased allocations in these areas represent the principal way in which these sports will be upgraded. The Athletic Director is responsible for such allocations.

Part 5: Women’s Teams

What intercollegiate women’s teams will be organized? At the present time, funds have been allocated for women’s teams in tennis and basketball. Emphasis should be on these two sports this season on a trial basis. The future development of women’s sports will depend upon the increase in the number of women students and the areas in which interest lies.

Will coaches for women’s sports be employed? A woman member of the staff willbe added next year. She will be expected to participate in the physical education program and to coach as developing needs require. Women coaches will not be employed for individual sports in the near future.

**Part 6: Physical Education**

Will additional funds be available to improve facilities and equipment for physical education and intramurals? The Trustee action reinforces the place of physical education in the total life of the college and the development of its students. It recognizes the need for improved facilities and funding. This means an expanded program for men and women involving more playing fields, renovation of the area under the East Stands, more equipment, referees, etc. There will have to be a budget increase in this area, the exact amount to be determined in the regular budgeting process. Club sports are an independent enterprise, but will be encouraged and aided in a reasonable way. The college will not be responsible for accident insurance for club sports participants, nor will it provide coaches for individual club sports.

**Part 7: Personnel Policy**

What does the Trustee action imply with regard to “the status and security of personnel in the department”? One of the first concerns of the Athletic Director-elect, working with his Physical Education Chairman, will be to define the teaching roles of coaches, to realign teaching-coaching responsibilities of the coaching staff, and to make recommendations regarding contracts and status.

**Part 8: Alumni Affairs**

During the course of a year, Davidson alumni are asked for contributions by several college-connected activities. Please explain each of these campaigns and their effects on the fiscal welfare of Davidson. The Annual Fund is a campaign conducted among all alumni, parents, and other friends of the college from December to June 30 for unrestricted money supports any educational purpose, whenever and wherever most needed. Contributions are tax-deductible; they go directly into the general funds of Davidson College and are used to cover a wide variety of items ranging from scholarships, faculty salaries, and book purchases, to the maintenance of buildings and grounds. The Wildcat Athletic Fund, formed four years ago primarily to support football grants-in-aid with some aid to all, has been an additional source of tangible giving to Davidson. The Wildcat Fund has raised money in addition to and not instead of the Annual Fund. In the future, Wildcat Club Funds will be used primarily to support scholarship aid to students in all athletic areas. The fund-raising responsibilities for the Wildcat Athletic Fund are handled by the Wildcat Club, and a gift to the Fund constitutes membership in the Wildcat Club. Capital gifts are those which build beyond the present into the future. The college is continually seeking capital gifts for buildings, endowed professorships, and other long-range needs; this is an operation entirely separate from the Annual Fund, which provides vitally needed short-term funds. The Deferred Giving Program is designed to underwrite the long-range future of the college, and especially its endowment, by gifts which are planned and designated now but realized many years down the road. Examples of this kind of gift are annuities of various types, trusts, and planned bequests. Contrary to popular assumption, they are advantageous to all classes of givers, those of both modest and substantial means.

**Part 9: Wildcat Club**

What is the Wildcat Club’s function under the new policy? The Wildcat Club's primary function will be to raise funds for scholarship aid to student-athletes. The Athletic Director may request the Board to allocate specific funds for special projects.

What does this mean in specific terms? The Wildcat Club Funds will be used to help meet the obligation to football players in the three upper classes to whom grants have already been committed and will be used to meet cash-to-need costs for other student-athletes who are recommended by the coaching staff. The financial need of any student is met by aid in the form of various combinations of college scholarships and grants, loans, and work. The monies raised by the Wildcat Club will be used specifically to replace with cash grants the loan and work portions of the assistance administered by the Committee on Admissions and Financial Aid.

Who will determine how Wildcat Club Funds will be allocated? All funds received from the Wildcat Club will be under the immediate jurisdiction of the Athletic Director who will work closely with the coaches and the Chairman of the Physical Education. Wildcat Club Directors will have an opportunity to make recommendations to the Athletic Director in accordance with their view of the use of funds they provide. The Athletic Director will then formulate his recommendations to the President as a part of the normal budgeting process.
