Braitman Employs Rich Colors And Images In His Paintings

By CHAPPELL WESCOAT

119 E. Seventh St., Charlotte, NC., 704/333-8601

Change in process and style are apparent in Andrew Braitman’s most recent paintings. The crusty, sculptural qualities have expanded to include scraping and cutting into dried layers of paint instead of only wet paint. These highly textured surfaces capture more light than before in a wet luminescence. Discarding the old diamond motif, Braitman now spends more time planning out content--as much as three days on preliminary sketches. In doing so, he adds a mythological element to previously decorative works.

Braitman pushes the edge between system and non-system through gesture within carefully devised geometric shapes. Layer after layer of oil paint mixed with finely ground volcanic pumice is applied, then scraped off, gouged into, and sliced through. This process creates an archaeological effect similar to that of Antoni Tapies whose relief painting demonstrated a collapsing of sculpture and painting into one united medium. Braitman further pushes that edge in the actual forms--juxtaposing curves and smeared edges with straight, formal lines. Colors are rich, muted shades of coral, brown, purple, gold, and green. The overall effect is one of forms and colors moving in and out of consciousness.

Braitman’s central images are framed within the paintings themselves. In works where the forms are more curvaceous, Tectonic Vignette I & III, the background is more an extension of the interior forms than an actual frame. But in other works, Marlowe's Tempest I, IV, & V, Thunder Crack, and Awaiting the Senay, actual frames are painted around the central images. These frames consist of stacked rectangles that contrast in form as well as in color, thus activating the space and becoming an integral part of the paintings.

Although there are no figurative images in the seventeen works exhibited, the titles serve as frames of reference that lend a suggestion of narrative to the decorative paintings. In the Marlowe's Tempest series and Duplicity in the Storm, the darkest and most built-up works, titles combined with textures and gesture create an image of torrents of water and mud washing across a once smooth surface. Non-figurative blotches of paint become splatting raindrops and tormented leaves. These connections can be made in most of Braitman’s paintings, thus drawing the viewer in as an active participant in determining the artist’s meanings and intentions. Price range: $750 to $4000.

Rob Kelley | Inside Charlotte Shopping

Charlotte's Thrift Stores

Are you bored with your wardrobe? Does your Trocadero seem truculent, your Esprit uninspiring? Or perhaps you looked in the mirror today and realized for the first time that low-top duck boots are the most lame-brained idea fashionable footwear’s seen since the jelly.

Well, there are alternatives. Recent magazines have noticed the trend from cookie-cutter fashions (multiples?) to a more personal style. Instead of returning to the Gap, people are rummaging through used clothing stores and discovering fashion long-forgotten. Moreover, people have tired of being classified by their dress. They want to experiment. Charlotte can satiate this need.

Besides specialty shops (Deadhead, Metal, Alternative), the Queen City reveals some more general hunting grounds. All you need to know is where to look. To make shopping easier, I’ve pinpointed a number of stores that lie close to each other.

Infinity's End. The Grand-Daddy of Genre clothing, and the most well known by Davidson students. On one side of the store lies enough Grateful Dead to choke Garcia himself, from Baja jackets to tie-dye T-shirts, sepas to incense. They also have a pipe collection across the back wall that would make even Dave Crosby look again. The other side is packed with Metalhead gear, ranging from wear.

You might think this place harbors true miscreants. Despite its strange merchandise, the store is very clean in appearance, with shiny aluminum racks and fluorescent lighting. Their prices reflect it.

Rainbow Bargain Center: Incredible. This shop is located right next to Infinity’s, and it just opened a month ago. If you want an accessory shop, this is it. They’ve got hats, belts, bags, bandannas, scarves, earrings, and other really nifty stuff. It’s also very cheap. I picked up a black beret for $3, and the highest priced item I could find was a leather policeman’s hat for $19.99. It’s a small shop, with a stocky Oriental man behind the counter. I highly recommend it.

Morris Army-Navy Surplus Store. Army-Navy stores are great places to go shopping. They also have hats and bandannas, as well as the closest thing Charlotte has to a Bohemian district. The floors are mostly dark wood or dark carpet, and the clothing is arranged in different rooms throughout. The clients are generally of the young alternative crowd, the type that liked Depeche Mode when Depeche Mode wasn’t cool. Seventh Street seems particularly focused towards their type of fashion, but it has some eccentricities as well.

To get to it, take the Independence Boulevard exit off of Brookshire, but turn right onto the Plaza instead of traveling down to K-Mart. Turn right at the stop sign.belt buckles, shoe strings, and camouflage gear. It is also very clean, though it smells slightly of boot rubber. All three of these shops are located in the K-Mart shopping center on Independence Boulevard. You need only take I-77 to Brookshire West, then exit left onto Independence Boulevard and follow it until you see it on your right (about three or four miles). These shops are relatively conventional. They are brightly lit, the clothes are on racks, and the clerks dress in ordinary attire. But if you travel deeper into Charlotte, you can find some really weird places, with stranger merchandise and much lower street emporium. Turn left at the intersection, then follow the road across some railroad tracks to Monroe. Turn right on Monroe, and the shop will be on your left. If you hit Hawthorne Lane, you’ve gone too far. Lastly, there is one more place every fashion scavenger needs to check out. Your local Salvation Army Thrift Store has the best clothes at the best prices. All styles of outdated clothing wind up here, with vests starting at $1.50 each and a sports coat selling for $7. To find it, take the Morehead exit off of I-77 (exit 10a), turn left, follow it until you hit Kings, and turn left. Follow Kings past Central Piedmont Community College and you are now on Central. The Thrift Store will be on your left. If you see a Harris Teeter on the right you’ve gone too far. Life isn’t all Trocadero and LL glory.

“Allegories of Truth, Gallery Crawling In Charlotte Lets Students Meet Different Artists” By MISSY MEEGAN

On the first Friday of every month, art galleries in downtown Charlotte open their doors an extra few hours to allow public access to the new exhibitions. The “Gallery Crawl” lets people walk from gallery to gallery to see the latest shows. Last Friday, the Union Gallery Committee sponsored a trip to the crawl by taking two van loads to Charlotte. The crawl starts in Spirit Square, one of the best centers in North Carolina to view nationally renowned works. Spirit Square houses several galleries whose shows included The Rosenberg Exhibition, and exhibitions concerning the oppression in Palestine and the after-effects of the Vietnam war. Other galleries included in the crawl are the Jared Melbourne Gallery, the Hodges Taylor Gallery, and the Center of the Earth Gallery. Several of the artists are at their shows and often talk to the public. Of course, aside from the excellent opportunity to absorb the wide variety of artistic culture, the Gallery Crawl is quite a social event. Students who went commented not only on the art, but also on the people they saw and conversations they heard. Professor Shaw Smith was reported to be seen emerging from a white limousine in his distinguishable leather jacket and cowboy boots. Since the first trip proved successful, the Gallery Committee will continue this event on the first Friday of every month. If interested, the next crawl is Friday, Dec. 7. Please sign up at the Union’s Information Desk the week before to ensure a ride to Charlotte. We will meet in the Conversation Pit at 5:30 P.M. on Friday, Dec. 7.

Kuzmo Continued from Page 11

...is a direct result of his family’s troubles in Yugoslavia. These are “films about the difficulty of seeing through our own ideological, sexual, political, economic, racial, ethnic... blinders.” The categories entitled “Horrifying” and “Strangely Comforting” exist as gut-feelings he felt after watching the categories’ films. The “horrifying” films are those films concerning men and women who cannot love and understand themselves. “Strangely Comforting” films remind the viewer that perhaps “you are looking in the right direction.” The “nostalgic” category then “reminds us that we are perpetually coming of age.” Finally, the categories of “Historical (External Pressure of Us)” and “Psychological (Internal Pressure of Us)” address the existence of films in accordance with historical or psychological human events.
