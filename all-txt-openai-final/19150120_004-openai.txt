BASKETBALL TEAM TAKES TRIP.

On Tuesday, the Varsity basketball team left for its initial trip of the season. Its first opponent is the Statesville Athletic Club, on Tuesday night. On Wednesday night, the team plays Salisbury, from there going to Greensboro to play the Y.M.C.A. of that city. Much interest is felt in the result of these games, as they are the first opportunity the team has had to try its mettle. At a recent election, T. H. Somerville was chosen captain and Al Reese manager. Reese promises that there will be several other good trips for the team in the future.

STUDENT VOLUNTEER CONFERENCE.

The Conference has been so planned that it will include the last day of the Laymen's Convention in order that the delegates may have an opportunity to hear Mott, Speer, Ellis, and other fine speakers.

The Bureau wishes to serve the student body.

LYCEUM COURSE DISCONTINUED.

On account of the low number of tickets sold and the small attendance at the entertainments, the Lyceum course will be discontinued for the rest of this year. The manager regrets this very much but it will be impossible to continue the course without incurring a large deficit. As soon as the manager, J. E. Carter, is able to return to college, the price of the season ticket minus the cost of the first entertainment will be refunded to those who bought them. In the place of the Lyceum entertainments, the Y. M. C. A. will endeavor to bring one or two inexpensive attractions and local talent plays to the Hill.
