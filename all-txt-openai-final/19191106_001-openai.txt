Vol. VII. DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N. C., NOVEMBER 6, 1919. No. 10

**Davidson College Day Will be Celebrated in December**

The anniversary of the signing of the armistice, November 11, will not be celebrated by a holiday at Davidson. It was commonly supposed that Davidson College Day would be held on this date and that no classes would meet. Davidson College Day, however, has been postponed until some time around the first of December, when a holiday will then be given, combining the Armistice Day and Davidson College Day. Arrangements are now being made for a good program.

**Wild Kittens Romp Bingham for Victory. Dick, Dantzler and Carter Starred—Muddy Field Allowed Only Two Touchdowns**

Meow! Meow! Who said the Wild Kittens couldn't fight? With the blood of Bingham still on their claws, the young cats returned home and reported to their elders a 13 to 0 victory. Invading foreign territory for the first time, the Davidson Reserves gave a good account of themselves by overcoming the fast Bingham eleven on Oates field, in Asheville. The game was hard fought from kick-off to last down, though a muddy field caused a good many costly fumbles for both sides. Only twice did Bingham have the ball in Davidson territory, and not once was her goal seriously threatened.

Dantzler, for Davidson, put the pigskin in action, kicking to Woodward, who returned 10 yards. By line plunges the ball was carried to the middle of the field, where it went over on downs. Davidson, by a series of off-tackle plays, carried the ball to Bingham’s 10-yard line, but lost it there on a fumble. Being held for downs, Bingham attempted a punt but fumbled the ball, which rolled behind the goal line. Carter, of Davidson, covered it for a touchdown. Dantzler kicked goal. During the remainder of the half the ball see-sawed up and down the field, the Wild Kittens several times carrying the ball within striking distance of their opponents’ goal, only to lose it on downs.

At the end of the first half it began to rain, pouring steadily throughout the remainder of the game. Phillips demonstrated his ability to keep going in spite of the mud and once made a hook slide of 15 yards. Davidson scored again in the third quarter by end runs and line plunges, their opponents being unable to hold them. Dantzler carried the ball, but failed to kick goal. The muddy field made forward passing impossible during the last half.

Dick and Dantzler were the stellar players in Davidson's backfield. Dick, besides being a consistent ground gainer, ran the team in great style. This plucky little player broke his collar-bone during the third quarter, but uttering no complaint, he played right on to the end of the game. No one even suspected his injury before the final whistle. Dantzler never failed when called upon to gain through the line. Carter played a good game at tackle. He tore through the line repeatedly and broke up the plays of the Cadets.

**Alumni Banquet Very Enjoyable Occasion**

**Atlanta Alumni Association Tends Regular Banquet to Team**

After eating and drinking diluted mud all afternoon the Wildcat squad was mighty glad to partake of sustenance a little more palatable and nutritious. The annual banquet given by the Atlanta Alumni was held in the College Grill at the Ansley Hotel as soon after the game as the players could separate themselves from the Grant Field property they carried away. If there was any feeling on the part of the team that the supporters of Davidson were disappointed with their showing it was immediately dispelled. The occasion was one for good fellowship, good time, and good eats and the man who claims he didn’t have a good time is either contrary or a professional grouch.

Responsibility for the affair can be credited mainly to H. M. Askew, 1900, who acted as business manager and high financier. Mr. Caldwell and Mr. Perry were also a great aid in getting the alumni together. Suitable music furnished by an excellent orchestra added to the pleasure of the occasion. As to the menu, just ask somebody who is familiar with restaurant parlance and who can make people believe he has been to a banquet before. To the unsophisticated, the first course closely resembled cream tomato soup, but any definite statement to that effect is out of the question. The main item in the next round answered to all the requirements of the best piece of beefsteak he had ever seen but on a printed score card would probably look something like “carne con carne,” or words to that effect.

After the table was cleared of all edibles and some of the more promiscuous had lighted their Saturday night cigars, it was conclusively proven that the precious art of linguistic excellence which is so prevalent among the present generation was handed down as one of the perpetual traditions of the institution. Mr. W. G. Perry, 1895, was introduced as toastmaster and presented Dr. Ben R. Lacy as the speaker of the evening. After declaring that the strenuous rally in the fourth quarter was the best exhibition of sportsmanship he had ever seen, he argued that the bachelors were supposed to do the speaking and called on Mr. Scott Candler. Mr. Candler spoke of the team as a team of students and gave this as their undying spirit. Coach Crayton then expressed his pleasure at knowing he had such loyal support from the alumni and said he understood why the members of the team always wanted to make the Atlanta trip. Captain Spann regretted that the score was so large but reaffirmed their determination to win the next two games. McMaster, Shepherd and Brady backed him up in this statement. The last named complained of all the old alumni greeting him with, “Are you that little Sam Brady that used to hang around the college?”

Dr. McGeachy had prepared very interesting puns on every member of the team. He explained that the reason the Davidson team was worth so much was that it was the only one that had a Fairy and a good Shepherd on it, and that the line was a Spann too long. Mr. Caldwell was then called on and passed the buck to Jimmie Winn, otherwise known as Windy Jim. Mr. Charlie Taylor said that he had been following and backing the Davidson team for years and that the scrap they put up Saturday was as good as he had ever seen. Davidson men are found everywhere and they all have the same spirit, the spirit that wins games.

**Thrilling Experience in Russia Related by “Y” Worker**

**Mr. A. M. Craig, Twenty Months as “Y” Secretary in Russia, Addresses Y. M. C. A.**

Mr. A. M. Craig, of Winston-Salem, who has returned to America after 20 months as a “Y” secretary in Russia, spoke to the Y. M. C. A. last Sunday night. He related his thrilling experiences in Russia, and showed some of the problems and opportunities which that country presented.

Mr. Craig went over to Russia with the second group of “Y” secretaries, by way of Siberia in the fall of 1917, arriving in Moscow in November. At first the “Y” secretaries were looked upon with suspicion, but when they showed that they had no selfish motives and were there to help Russia, they were welcomed and shown every consideration. The Bolsheviki uprising started five days after Mr. Craig reached Moscow. It started in Kremlin, November 8, 1917, on Friday, and by noon Saturday it was raging fiercely around the “Y” headquarters, a mile and a half away. For a week no one in the house could go out, and the rations of rice and prunes became monotonous, to say the least. Finally the Kerensky government was overthrown, and the Bolsheviki faction held a great funeral in the Red Square. It was a ghastly spectacle to see the dead bodies lowered into the gigantic grave. There was no service, no priest, no religious ceremony with the burial. The Bolshevik takes no account of God. The covering of the bodies wasfollowed by a political speech. After a short stay in Archangel, at which place Mr. Crag had been located, he was sent South. It was at this time that the demobilization, or rather the demoralization of the Russian army was taking place. The Russian soldiers refused to fight and deserted their officers, who were powerless to hold them. These bands of soldiers would board a train, force the passengers out, and make the engineer take them in any direction they wished. This became such a common occurrence that the following notice was posted in the coaches: “Soldiers are requested not to throw passengers out of the train windows while it is in motion.” The reason given was that the outside world might think it strange. People are apt to forget that in the beginning of the war Russia rose to her task magnificently, that in spite of poor leadership the soldiery fought bravely, often brilliantly. Russia put out one of the largest armies ever raised by any nation. It is a country of tremendous possibilities. The natural resources, as yet barely touched, are boundless. The people are fettered by lack of education and centuries of oppression. They have ability, which if trained in the right direction, will be a wonderful power for civilization. Guided by the baneful influences now working upon it, Russia faces a future of despair. The mass of the Russian people regard America as an ideal. If America lends a helping hand, the majority of the people will respond. Bolshevism holds only the power and the monetary system. The greater part of the population has not, as yet, been converted to its doctrines. America can do much to help Russia to a sure and safe foundation.

Yellow Jackets Win From Watersoaked Wildcats on Sea of Mud, 33-0

Both Teams Crippled but Fight Hard—No-Injury Record—Spann, Johnson and Douglas Stars—Rain Biggest Feature

Old jinx and Jupiter Pluvius are still parking on the trail of the Wildcats. On a field that more nearly resembled a pond or lagoon than a football stadium, the heavy Tornado eleven registered 33 points while the Red and Black were unable to count. The natatorium in which the aquatic meet was held would have been suitable for Wake Forest or some other Baptist aggregation, but worked to the disadvantage of the Presbyterians. As usual, with such a heavy opponent, Davidson was counting strongly on overhead work, which was rendered impossible by the condition of the field and the pigskin. Only three passes resulted favorably for the Wildcats, while Tech completed only one for a considerable gain. Just about time for the whistle to blow starting the game, the clouds opened up and from then on water was one of the main features of the contest. Tech opened with a rush, making two touchdowns in the first quarter. Straight line plays with occasional end runs were responsible for these scores, Ferst carrying the ball across both times. The second quarter went to Davidson. The Jackets were scarcely able to make a first down during the period and were forced to kick time after time after being held for downs. The third quarter started out very much as the second had, with Davidson holding the advantage. Johnston was out-punting his opponent and keeping the ball in Tech's territory until a fumble was taken advantage of by the Jackets and they began another drive for the goal. The fourth quarter was the most interesting of the game. Although Tech made two touchdowns during the period, Davidson put up her best offensive fight and had her best chance of scoring. By making three successive first downs the ball was brought beyond the 20-yard line when the Tornado defense strengthened and held for downs. As all the players had been sufficiently soused in the mud to become indistinguishable and darkness was making matters worse, it was hard to tell who to tackle. Searchlights were thrown on the field but helped very little in finding the ball. The 55-yard run by Scarboro in this quarter was easily the feature of the game. His interference on the run was perfect and he deserves a great deal of credit for the speed he developed under such adverse conditions. A remarkable thing about the game was that time was not taken out for a single injury and only one five-yard penalty was imposed by the referee. On several occasions time was called to remove some of the mud from the players’ eyes but with the exception of a slight injury to McAlister the game had a clean record in this respect. Spann, Johnston and Douglas were the big stars for Davidson. Frank Ferst, by making four touchdowns, distinguished himself, while Scarboro with his spectacular run also deserves most favorable comment. Because it was next to impossible to tell who had the ball a detailed account may credit the wrong man with gains in a few instances.
