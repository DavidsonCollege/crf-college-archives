### Base Ball Practice
Large Squad Training for First Game Next Week.

Baseball has cast its hypnotic spell over Sprunt Athletic Field. The attention of the entire student body is turned to Coach Fetzer and his fifty faithful privates. From now until June, the enthusiastic fan’s mind will follow with keen interest the activities of the Red and Black squad, and from all appearances, they will have plenty of thrills for their interest.

The past few days have found the Red and Black busy as never before getting into shape for one of the hardest schedules she has ever had, and which begins a little earlier than usual. The players are in fairly good physical condition and arms have about gotten into whipping form. Of course, the pitchers are not putting out any smoke as yet, but the temperature is rising with each succeeding day. All the new men are having the fine points drilled into them, and the old men are learning the old tricks of teamwork more efficiently.

“Coach” has a wealth of material for this time of season, and the prospects are bright. There is an unusual supply of fresh material. There are three out for the catcher’s job at present. They are: “Sam” Keesler, Faires, and Burns. Keesler is an old man and has had some experience. He is a little light but fast and has good pep when working right. Faires, also light, has good form and a good arm. “Buck” Burns may also be in the running, as he is a big boy and fairly fast.

The pitching should be of a high order this spring, judging from the early workouts. Worth, Garrison, and Withers, the three most promising among the new material, are showing up well. Worth has a good build, form, and plenty of speed, and as soon as the weather warms up, he promises to be on the job with the best. With some coaching, Withers and Garrison will strengthen the staff. “Bill” Lawson is back on the job and going good. His work last year was of the best quality, and this season should be his best. “Dutch” Hengeveld is now off the Hill but will be back in time to train up for the first game. He was a mainstay of the staff last year and will prove a strong asset either in the box or, if need be, in the outfield this year.

All the old infield is back, in better shape and with more experience. It looks as if Saunders will again hold down first. Johnson is showing up well at second, with Black and Wood going good at third and short. John Pharr and J. C. Watkins also look good for infield positions. Singleton, Safford, Dean, and Flowers, all new men, are showing up swell. There is a host of promising men for the outfield, and three strong hitters are sure to be found among the bunch.

The student body is looking forward with much enthusiasm to the opening game of the season with Catawba College, which will be staged on the Hill on the 27th of this month. Practically all of last year’s letter men are back, and in addition, there is an unusual supply of fresh material.

### Subjects Announced for Debating Contests
At a meeting of the Debating Council, held Monday afternoon, the subjects for the Junior-Senior Inter-Society debate and the Fresh-Soph debate were selected.

For the Junior-Senior debate, the preliminaries for which will be held in each society on April 16th, the question will be, “Resolved, That an alliance of all American countries should take the place of the Monroe Doctrine.” Three men will be selected in this preliminary contest in each society for the debate between the two societies in Shearer Hall on April 30th. The medal for the best debater on each side will be awarded at this time also.

The query for the Fresh-Soph debate is, “Resolved, That the Federal Government should own and operate all interstate railroads.” This debate will be held on April 30th, at which time the winner of the debate will be announced.the medal offered in each society for the best debater in the two lower classes will be selected. Each contestant in these contests can choose the side he wishes to defend, and it is hoped that a large number of men will enter. Both of these subjects are before the American people today, and arguments and data are easily securable.

At a recent meeting of the student body, J. B. Daffin, '18, and H. K. Aiken, '18, were elected assistant managers of the baseball team for the coming season.

The Town People

At a recent meeting of the Woman’s Missionary Society, Mrs. C. M. Richards was elected as delegate to the Concord Presbyterial, which is to meet in the near future. Mrs. A. Currie was elected alternate.

Misses Katherine and Winifred Potts spent a very pleasant weekend visit at home. They are students at Queens College.

Mr. and Mrs. J. C. Calhoun and children have recently visited Davidson on their way from Savannah to Old Point Comfort, Va. They were here to see Mrs. Calhoun’s mother, Mrs. Ellenwood.

Miss Emily Phifer, of the faculty of Lees-McRae Institute, of Banner Elk, N.C., is a visitor at the home of Mrs. Fetzer.

Friends will be glad to know that Mrs. Lingle and Mrs. Fulton are speedily recovering from an attack of la grippe, from which they have been suffering for some while.

On Monday afternoon at the home of Mrs. and Miss Ellenwood, a postponed meeting of the Book Lovers’ Club was held. The subject discussed at the meeting was “Character Stories.” Miss Hattie Thompson was in charge of the discussion, which was much enjoyed.

Dr. H. B. Arbuckle was heard with much pleasure from the pulpit of Knox Church, of Charlotte, on last Sunday.

Rev. H. S. Henderson, who is pastor of the Presbyterian Church in Ackerman, Miss., was on the Hill last Sunday visiting his brother, K. B. McKutcheon, ’20.

Miss Hill, who has been for several years a missionary of the Episcopal Church in China, will arrive at the end of the week to spend her furlough with her parents, Mr. and Mrs. John Hill.

Mrs. Margaret Minter has been here for a week arranging to move to Baltimore, where she will live with her sons, Clarke and Russell Minter, '13.

Professor and Mrs. Withers moved on Monday from the Booe house, on North Main Street, to the house vacated by Mr. H. J. Brown, on South Main.

NEW REFERENCE WORKS IN THE LIBRARY

The following volumes have been added to the reference department of the college library: “A Dictionary of Similes,” by Wilstach; “A Tennyson Dictionary,” by Baker; “A Dictionary of Dates;” “A Dictionary of Non-Classical Mythology;” “The New International Year Book;” “Words and Places;” and four volumes of the New York Times Index.

Plans are being completed for the organization of an association to be known as the North Carolina College Press Association, which shall include the newspapers and magazines in the various colleges of the State. The idea was suggested by a member of The Davidsonian staff at a meeting last spring, but it was not until this past September that work was begun on it. During the latter part of September, correspondence was opened by T. J. Mitchell, who has had the plans in charge, with the other colleges of the State and the plan of the association outlined to them. After some delay, a sufficient number of the colleges signified their willingness to cooperate, and arrangements were formally entered into.

The organization has for its object the extension of the good feeling which exists between the colleges, the drawing of the newspaper and magazine staffs of the various institutions closer together for mutual benefit in discussing and settling questions which so often arise in connection with these publications, the sharing of plans and suggestions which have been helpful to the various publications either in an editorial or a financial way, the raising of the literary standards of the papers and magazines, and the broadening of their scope and usefulness to their respective colleges.

The staffs of the two University publications have agreed to entertain a convention of delegates from the colleges during the month of April, at which time the organization will be perfected, a constitution drawn up and adopted, officers elected, and a definite policy formulated. Several of the colleges have already elected their representatives and notified The Davidsonian, and the program for the meeting is being arranged as quickly as possible. As soon as final plans for the convention have been made they will be announced.

READING OF JOB GIVEN AT CHURCH SUNDAY NIGHT

Instead of the regular sermon, Professor Fulbright gave a reading of the book of Job last Sunday evening. After making a very interesting review of the book from a literary standpoint, he proceeded to give the philosophical dialogue which took place between Job and his friends. By his perfect enunciation and pleasing style, Professor Fulbright made the reading very interesting and highly instructive. The rendering of the discussion in this way gave his hearers a clearer insight into the meaning of the book, and, at the same time, made them realize that such a discussion really had taken place.

NEW EDITOR-IN-CHIEF OF ANNUAL ELECTED

At a meeting of the Junior class, held yesterday morning, L. A. Chambliss was unanimously elected Editor-in-Chief for the 1918 volume of Quips and Cranks.
