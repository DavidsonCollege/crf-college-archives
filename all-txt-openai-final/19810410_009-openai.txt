Lowes, Harris Teeter and Cashions stock different assets

Eating independently can be a real hassle, but it can also be a valuable learning experience. With the right amount
of planning and careful shopping, it is possible to eat well for less than what it costs at eating houses
or ARA Slater. How much you gain boils down to a matter of how much time you are willing to
invest.

Talking to students around campus revealed a range of approaches, from a disregard for balanced meals and economy to meticulous
care in meal and budget planning. The students I interviewed seem to confirm the stereotype that women are better than
men at this sort of thing. When asked what staples were needed each week, one girl reeled off a list
so quickly that it was hard to get everything down, whereas most men had to think a while before coming
up with a list. One even admitted that he never shopped! "I usually go home for the weekends and bring
back food from home," he said. Another male student was adamant about which foods were necessary for good nutrition, but
when asked about prices, he said they were too much of a bother to worry about.

Since students were not much help in determining which supermarkets were the best, I had to go compare prices myself.
In most cases, I found Cashions to be cheapest and Lowe’s the most expensive. (Davidsonian features editors Glenn Kellum and
Anne Goodwin also compared prices. See their results in the table on this page.) But price considerations are not always
the only factors involved. Talking with the managers of Lowe’s, Harris Teeter, and Cashions proved to be more enlightening.

Donald Overcash, Assistant Manager of Lowe’s, said that up to 40% of his customers are students. Although prices at Lowe’s
are higher than those at Harris Teeter or Cashions, Overcash cited Lowe’s proximity and easy check cashing policy as its
biggest assets. Some students had harsh words for Lowe’s high prices, but it is reasonable to consider that Lowe’s sustains
a 30-40% loss. On the other hand, the fact that Lowe’s is a chain tends to diminish the significance of
this loss.

Harris Teeter, another chain, is not as affected by student business. "Some of our hotter specials pull people in from
as far away as Charlotte," Manager Buddy James said proudly. Produce and meat products are the big drawing cards. James
added that the opening of Lowe’s had actually increased his total business but decreased his student business.

What about generic products, those cute little white wrapper commodities? The big sellers are paper towels, oils, and crackers, James
said, but he admitted that generic products are often of lower quality than nationally advertised brands. Cashions manager Sam Caldwell
agreed, citing the syrupy consistency of generic jellies as an example. "I don’t see what the big deal is," he
complained, adding that some of the national brands he carries are just as inexpensive.

The interest in generic products is just one of the problems that privately-owned Cashions must face. Like Lowe’s, it has
to deal with the challenges of competing with larger chains.

but vacationers at Lake Norman usually take up some of the slack. Lowe’s and Cashions take differing attitudes toward unit
pricing, although neither store uses it. Unit pricing is the practice of listing how much an item costs per standard
unit of weight. It enables customers to compare relative prices among various sizes and brands. Caldwell said large chain stores
like Lowe’s can do this easily because of the computer systems they have, but at Cashions everything would have to
be done by hand, “and with ten pages of price changes a week, minimum, that would take a lot of
time.” Not only would the process be time-consuming, he added, but paying for the extra labor would probably raise food
prices. Caldwell said Cashions would hold off on unit pricing as long as possible, but admitted that public pressure might
make it inevitable. Until that time it is best just to carry your trusty calculator to find the best deals—or
shop at Harris Teeter, the only store with unit pricing.

In terms of serving the college community, the three stores differ greatly. Lowe’s main service is convenience. Harris Teeter has
unit pricing and is cheaper than Lowe’s, but other than their “hot” specials, has no special attitude about serving the
college. At Cashions, low prices are the bottom line but there’s another asset for students who come from different backgrounds.
Cashions stocks its shelves with a greater variety of products. A close look at Cashions’ bakery or cheese section will
show that demographic as well as ethnic backgrounds are well-represented.

The choice, then, is up to the individual. For most, trotting across the street to Lowe’s is the most convenient,
and, for those who do not have to plan entire meals, the trip to Cashions or Harris Teeter is probably
not worth it. But those who want wider variety and lower prices will find that Harris Teeter offers a lot.
Cashions is the best: competitive yet sensitive to student wants and needs.

Davidson MDs build new medical building
By TRACY THOMPSON

Davidson doctors Ron Hunt and Bill Williams are building a new Davidson Medical Clinic to be opened in August. Hunt
and Williams, who serve the College Infirmary, are expanding their private practice in response to an ever-increasing demand for local
medical services. Their new facility will be located on Highway 115 approximately one-half mile south of the Post Office. It
will replace the smaller offices behind the Post Office on Railroad Street. The doctors have been renting from the College
for the past three years.

Business Manager Bob Currie said that with proper renovations the present medical clinic could be turned into housing space for
as many as twenty students. Housing Director Bill Bolding said, however, “The last time I met with President Spencer, the
fate of the building was still uncertain.”

Hunt, Williams and a third doctor who will arrive in August will staff the new Medical Clinic. The new doctor
will also serve the Infirmary. Williams said, “a fourth doctor could be brought into the practice within the next couple
years, depending on need.” Charlotte architectural firm Wheatley Associates designed the clinic and Kenneth Reed Construction Corporation of Huntersville is
building the structure. The clinic will house twelve examination rooms, an X-ray suite and a laboratory. The doctors will not
offer any new services in the clinic, but they will be able to serve more patients. Another important reason for
the move, Williams said, “is that another doctor will give us a break on weekends and after hours.”
