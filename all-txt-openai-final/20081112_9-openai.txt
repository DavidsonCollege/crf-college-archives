BASKETBALL PREVIEW

11/24, Columbia, SC
The Gamecocks are led by Demetress Adams (Senior Forward, 10.9 ppg, 8.9 rpg). South Carolina looks to return to the postseason after last season’s NIT appearance.

11/28, Nashville, TN
Vanderbilt Tournament
Senior Christina Wirth leads the Commodores with 41.5% shooting from behind the arc. But Wirth isn’t the only downtown threat; watch for them. They enter the season ranked 12th in the AP poll after last season’s Sweet 16 run.

12/9, Belk Arena
The cross-town rival 49ers return four starters to a team expected to finish third in the A-10.

11/29, Nashville, TN
Vanderbilt Tournament
The Wildcats will get a shot at another major conference opponent in the second round of the Vanderbilt Tournament. St. Joe’s was picked 6th of 14 in the A-10, while Va. Tech came in at 10th in the ACC.

12/19, Cincinnati, OH
The reigning A-10 champs begin the season ranked #22 in the AP Poll. Amber Harris (6’5” forward, junior, 15.3 ppg) and 6’6” sophomore center Ta’Shia Phillips lead the way for the Musketeers, who lost a close game to Nebraska in the NCAA tournament. Both got preseason all-A-10 nods, though Harris will sit out 3 weeks after undergoing knee surgery.

Christina Perez - The lone walk-on the team this year. Perez was a two-time Attleboro (Mass.) Area Holiday Tournament All-Tournament Selection during her prep career.

Amanda Ottaway - Freshman wing player averaged 18.4 points and 11 rebounds a game during her senior prep season.

Kristen Johnsen - Amassed over 1,000 points in her prep career and averaged 14 points and 8 rebounds a game as a senior. Johnsen should provide frontcourt depth for the ’Cats this season.

Logan Hartman - Along with Johnsen, should also bring the ’Cats frontcourt depth this season. Hartman was ranked among the top-five prep forwards in Pennsylvania as a high school senior.

12/21, Cincinnati, OH
The Bearcats are led by the backcourt of Kahla Roudebush (16.5 ppg) and Shelly Bellman. This will be the second of two homecoming games for Wildcats senior Mandy Halbersleben.
