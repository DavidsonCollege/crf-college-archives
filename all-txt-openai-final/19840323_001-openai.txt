**Town Zoning Proposal Threatens Fraternities**  
By ROSS HOLT  

A proposed deletion from the Town of Davidson’s zoning ordinances has threatened the existence of the two off-campus fraternities, Phi Gamma Delta and Sigma Phi Epsilon. After a group of North Main Street residents approached the town Planning Board, the board voted unanimously to recommend to the Town Council deletion of the section which allows fraternal organizations to operate in residential areas. 

In a letter to Fiji President Marshall Johnston and SPE President Steve MacMillan, town Mayor Nancy MacCormac announced a public hearing on the issue scheduled for April 10. The proposed deletion would allow fraternities and sororities to operate houses only on College grounds. According to MacCormac, the proposed change concerns “the perception of the community that fraternity houses may not be an appropriate use of activity in a residential area.” She said the proposal represented a “new awareness of an ongoing problem brought by residents to the attention of the Planning Board.” 

Board Chairman Annamarie Burts said residents had cited specific concerns. They included students cutting across lawns, vehicles parked on the street, noise, and parties both inside and outside. Johnston said he was aware of the town’s concerns. He said, however, “I just don’t think our disruptions are that bad.” 

Both fraternities currently operate under residential zoning but have non-conforming status. The town enacted the residential zoning in 1976, but a grandfather clause allowed them five years to conform to the rule. After the period ended in 1981, neither fraternity responded to letters warning them about their status. If the Town Council enacts the proposal, the two fraternities would have a period of grace to conform to the residential zoning or to vacate to another location. MacCormac said the town would allow “a reasonable period of time to comply with the change.” If the Council rejects the proposal, 

**IBM Offers Discount On Personal Computers**  
By TOM SCHILLING  

IBM Corporation is offering Davidson faculty members and students a 30 percent discount on IBM Personal Computers. In conjunction with the agreement, the Computer Services Center will begin a personal computing project designed to train the campus community in the use of the new systems. IBM hopes to sell a large number of personal computers here. Davidson plans to extend the availability and informal use of the new systems. 

According to the March 7 announcement by the Computer Services Center, “IBM has recognized Davidson as an educational affiliate institution, one of only a few in the nation.” This means that it gives extensive support to microcomputers and their use in academics. As a result, individuals can purchase their own IBM Personal Computer complete with word-processing software for just under $3000. 

The machines are so popular that delivery is slow, but those who order within the next few weeks may receive theirs before the end of the school year. The IBM Personal Computers will do “the best job for the most people,” says microcomputer specialist Carl Crenshaw. Their main advantage lies in their anticipated long-term success and use. IBM claims to produce a Personal Computer about every 15 seconds and still has a shortage. Probably most software of the future will be compatible with these systems. Also, the College plans to standardize the campus system so that more effectiveTraining can take place. Secondly, the IBM Personal Computers have “versatility.” They can be connected to the Prime 750, computers owned by the college and, according to Crenshaw, can “upload” or “download” much of the information there as well as performing administrative functions such as word processing. Though relatively new in hardware (the machines themselves), IBM offers a wide selection of software (computer instruction sets).

The town would enforce the current law. It requires a special use permit to retain nonconforming status. The fraternities “need to consider the fact that their future may be in question if the ordinance is deleted or if it is enforced,” MacCormac said. “If they rezone it, and we can’t use it as a fraternity, there is no use for our house,” said Fiji president Marshall Johnston. He said the consequences of the proposal’s acceptance would be dire. “If we lose that house, our national is set up so that we can’t continue our charter on campus.” Since the town has zoning privileges for a mile outside the town limits, Johnston said the distance and the fraternity’s financial situation would probably preclude moving to another house. The Fijis, he said, are also faced with paying off a mortgage on their building which could not be easily rented or sold. SPE president MacMillan declined any comment on the matter. According to Johnston, the Fijis are concentrating mainly on the defense.

Rusk Endowment Receives $1 Million

By ELIZABETH SMILEY

In 1983 the Duke Endowment celebrated its 60th birthday, but this year, the Endowment is the one giving out presents. At an anniversary colloquium on March 6, Duke Endowment Education Committee Chairman Charles Myers presented Davidson with a check for $100,000. The gift was the first payment of $1 million toward the Dean Rusk Endowment for International Studies. The grant, to be paid in full over a maximum ten-year period, is earmarked specifically to endow a James B. Duke professorship in International Studies.

The grant crystallizes a project that Davidson has nurtured “about a year and a half” according to Vice President for Development Jack Powers. Nine months ago the Development Office submitted a grant proposal for the professorship to the Duke Endowment. The gift came at an opportune time and fills a specific need within the Dean Rusk Endowment campaign. The Duke Endowment emphasized, however, that its grant in no way sets a precedent for repeated special giving of that magnitude, Powers said.

Establishment of a Professorship in International Studies is possibly the most important development in the Dean Rusk campaign so far. Powers sees it as a positive step toward realizing Rusk Endowment objectives and a key to solidifying program and budgetary goals that have, to this point, remained fairly broad. The James B. Duke professor will have multiple responsibilities as both an administrator and an academic. As a faculty member, he or she will be expected to teach courses in international studies. As possible director of the Dean Rusk Endowment, the Duke Professor will outline and implement programs in international education funded by the Rusk Endowment. In addition, the Duke Professor may work with the Development Office in fund-raising activities for the Rusk Endowment. Powers anticipates that the person chosen to fill the new chair will have a background with “actual experience in
