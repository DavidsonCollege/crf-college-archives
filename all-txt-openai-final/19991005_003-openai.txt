National Depression Awareness Week: October 4-8, 1999

Are you depression free?

Depression urges you to take a moment to make sure you — and those around you — are.

What to do when you think a friend may be depressed:

If a friend shows several of these symptoms of depression, you can listen and encourage him or her to seek treatment. If they do not seek help quickly, please talk to an adult you trust or go to the student counseling center yourself and ask what you can do to get them help. This is especially important if your friend mentions death or suicide. Student Counseling x2451; beeper 356-2118.

Expresses feelings of:
- sadness or “emptiness”
- hopelessness, pessimism, or guilt
- helplessness or worthlessness

Seems to be:
- unable to make decisions
- unable to concentrate or remember
- uninterested in previously enjoyable activities
- having more problems with school and friends

Complains of:
- loss of energy and drive — “slowed down”
- trouble falling asleep, staying awake, or getting up
- appetite problems — gain or loss of weight
- headaches, stomach aches, or backaches

Behavior changes such as:
- being more restless or irritable
- wanting to be alone much of the time
- cutting classes or dropping hobbies and other activities
- drinking more or taking drugs

Talking about:
- death
- suicide

Getting a depressed friend help:

1. Be persistent. Many people do not follow advice the first time but will after it is suggested a few more times.
2. Follow up with the person — both to find out if they got the help they needed and to find out if it was useful.
3. Be as specific as you can in your suggestions — for example by suggesting a specific person to talk to and even by helping them get there.
4. Don’t take it personally if they don’t do what you suggest right away — show interest in the outcome, not just if they did exactly as you suggested.
5. Try to reduce their feelings of weakness or inadequacy because they are down by letting them know it is not their fault.
6. Be optimistic and hopeful about their getting help — because their own optimism is diminished.
