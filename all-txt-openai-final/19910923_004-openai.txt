different even if they do happen to be curious. Conway himself likes to tell people he considers himself in no way a politically correct person, so people will ask him “what in the hell he’s about.” Contact is the next phase. A person in the contact phase is not afraid to talk to people about issues that divide them. He or she would have a meal with someone and not worry about how he looks in such a situation. As a director of student activities at Cornell, Conway has observed that it is a bold step for college students, and moreover a crucial one.

Integration is the last phase. Conway was quick to point out that what he means by integration is not the “cryin’, leanin’, ‘We-are-the-World’-singin’” integration. He means instead that people, as open thinkers, will seek new challenges and opportunities to meet new and different people. Most of all, they will respect others for who they are while maintaining a clear sense of who they are.

Finally, he urged college students, as future leaders, to remember one simple and important lesson: respect the world of others. By keeping that idea in mind, we can hopefully remember the value of tolerance and sensitivity to other peoples and cultures.

office-retail store complex on Highway 73 beside Knox Realty. This complex is adjacent to the Liverpool Project that is still in the process of being developed.

This new Liverpool area will have a Best Western, a UCB bank, office space, retail space, and an eight-screen movie theater. The theater is expected to open later this year probably around November.

Jennings said that there is still a lot of room for future development along Highway 73, especially after it is expanded to five lanes. He said that he is trying to encourage mixed uses of this area with some commercial and some living space.

Court

relax before the evening partying began, PAX stepped in to provide a refreshing surprise for the court.

No, PAX is not a fraternity, and any freshmen who thought that they had gotten an early bid to a fraternity are in for a surprise. PAX is, however, a house that has been converted to an inter-fraternal dormitory.

One of the attractions at PAX was the debut of Davidson’s newest band. Getting together just for the evening’s celebration, the band combines the musical talents of Julian Cochran, Michael Thurman, Chip Petree, Chris Hoveland, Peter Jackson, and Omar Ahsanuddin.

They played a delightful blend of the Dead, the Allman Brothers, and Widespread Panic.

PAX kept things shaking until later in the evening when Sig Ep hosted the court’s only late-night event. The court sorely missed the presence of PiKA and KA, who have both been placed on a week’s probation by Dean Terry for violating pledging regulations last spring.

Sig Ep did, however, provide freshmen with a view of what they’ve missed for the past four weeks and what they can look forward to for the next four years.

STUDY FOR ONE YEAR OR FOR ONE OR TWO TERMS IN OXFORD

and live with British Students

HOW WISC IS DIFFERENT FROM MOST OVERSEAS PROGRAMS:

- Accepted students receive admissions letters (and later transcripts) directly from an Oxford (or Cambridge) college.
- Students are directly enrolled as full students of the Oxford college.
- Qualified early applicants may share a co-ed Student Residence associated with St. Catherine's College, Oxford (fully integrated with British students).
- Students accepted before November 1 (for the Winter Term) or before May 1 (for next year) are guaranteed housing with British students.
- Students will NOT be taught in (and receive transcripts from) an American college operating in Oxford. WISC is one of the few completely integrated (academically and in housing) overseas programs in the UK.
- Previous students in your field will speak to you on the phone.
