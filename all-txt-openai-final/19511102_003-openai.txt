You probably thought when you read the score of the game last week, "Oh, well, the Cats come through again"
in the usual sarcastic manner. But if you had been there and seen that game, you wouldn't be so critical
and skeptical of the team. I have never seen a bunch play such inspired ball and so hard in my
life. There was something in the warm Virginia air, maybe the excitement and bustle of Homecoming festivities or just the
feeling that the team was nearly back to preseason condition, but the Cats took the field with a spirit and
determination that was inspiring. The first few minutes found the Red and Black in the General's command post, but not
quite in headquarters.

DAVIS WARMS UP TOE

During the first half, Gene Davis, the extra-point specialist, was continuously warming up in preparation for the what-appeared-to-be inevitable TD.
This was just an indication of the game that the boys played in the first half.

By DICK LILES

The Cats were getting the breaks, true, but they were playing for them. The tackling and blocking was greatly improved
and the plays were run to perfection. Everything went well until the "Big Blue's" ten-yard marker was reached. The line
smashes carried for at least five yards every time and the pitchouts around the ends met unusual success. Jimmy Thacker,
Ham Wade, and Henry Brown, who incidentally played his first full game at offense in addition to his regular duties
as backer-up, ran the ball well and made several sizeable gains. It was Jack Ruth, however, that made the difference
over last week. One of the Richmond sports writers during the W&L fray said that he was seeing an entirely
different team from the one that played Richmond the week before, and that he certainly was glad that Ruth failed
to see action that day.

"FAT-JACK" SHINES ON DEFENSE

Big Jerry Kiser turned in perhaps his best performance of the season on the defensive platoon. Jerry was tackling viciously
and making tackles all over the field. The Shelby Senior has been playing outstanding ball all year as the records
showing Davidson as a defensive leader will prove. The 34 points which the Generals scored on the locals can be
accounted for by the simple reason that they were supposed to be about that much better than the Presbyterians, and
that they outmanned the Cats so badly and wore out our injury-riddled defenses after the third quarter injury-fest. If you
will think back, you will remember that this is the first game that the Cats have failed to score in,
and the first half of the game would remind one of the Presbyterian fiasco. The boys tried with all they
had, but just didn’t have the punch to score or get that extra yard for a first. I think by
their determination and the fight they have shown, that the team should be given another chance. It seems, as another
columnist in The Davidsonian put it, that "a semi-permanent sort of inferiority complex has settled over the campus." The good
work of the cheerleaders and the student body in the pre-PC pep rally seems to have been doomed to obscurity.
Let's try to get up that spirit again before our last home stand and beat State College. It can be
done and is not at all impossible. Everyone should know what it will take and should start getting behind the
team for a better game. Sheer determination and fight is the answer. Alex Webster is no problem!

SPORTS SLANTS FROM THE PAST

In 1913 on this weekend, Notre Dame defeated the Cadets of Army by 35-13. It was the first win in
34 games for the Irish and it was the passing of Knute Rockne and Gus Dorais that completely routed the
Army eleven. The most amazing punt in football history was booted in 1946 in a game between Rice Institute and
Tulane. Huey Keeney of Rice punted the oval 105 phenomenal yards including the roll.

V.M.I. Host To Cats Tomorrow

Unsung Winders Gather Steam
Thacker Remains On Injured List

DICK ROPER

Still alive but not kicking so much any longer, the Wildcats make the long trip up to Lexington, Va., again
tomorrow to meet the Keydets of VMI in their seventh game of the season. And they’re still crippled, in some
places badly. Worst blow to the Cat backfield since Jack Ruth's mishap was the wrenched knee Freshman scatback Jim Thacker
suffered in the wild third quarter against Washington and Lee last Saturday. Thacker has been working out in sweat clothes
the whole week during practice, and will probably see little if any service against VMI. The Keydets are rated three
to four touchdowns over Coach Crowell Little’s team, but if the Cats play the brand of ball for sixty minutes
that they played for thirty last week against W&L, they'll give the Keydets some shaky moments. Two reasons why the
Cats held George Barclay’s Generals to a scoreless tie during the first half last Saturday come from that coach himself:
"Jerry Kiser is one of the finest defensive guards we've played against this season. Time after time he broke through
our line and broke up our plays. He was also outstanding in rushing passers." "Jim Thacker, until he was hurt,
gave our defense constant trouble. A fine running back, he was a threat at all times." Kiser, who seems to
improve every game, will be in there tomorrow. Thacker can’t be counted on for another week or two. A factor
which bodes no good for the Cats tomorrow is that VMI and Washington and Lee are bitter rivals, and the
Keydets will undoubtedly be pouring it on as hard as they can in order to top the Generals' score. But
sometimes a crippled cat, when he gets mad enough, can whip an opponent against whom he ordinarily wouldn't have a
chance. Coach Crowell Little hopes that will be the case tomorrow.

WILDCAT OF THE WEEK

By BOB HAZARD

"Good cross-country men don't know what the word ‘quit’ means." These words are posted on the wall in the dressing
room of the cross-country team. Maybe they sound a bit trite to some of our readers, but to Tom Stockton,
our Wildcat of the Week, they have meant a lot. Sure, it's easy to slow down or drop out of
the race when you're way behind and a couple of more miles to go, but this is never the case
for the Number One man of the Wildcat harriers, for he is seldom behind and he never quits. For this
year’s record, in the last three meets he has broken two records and probably would have toppled the third had
he not slowed down to let teammates Bill Lee and Bill Shipley finish in a three-way tie with him at
W&L. In the meet with the University of North Carolina, Tom eased across the line in the record time for
the Davidson course—21:15. This broke the record of N.C. State's Garrison and Shockley, which stood at 21:16.21. The following week,
the Winston-Salem Senior led the way for his mates in their rout of the University of Richmond thinclads, with a
new record of 23:13.5 for the Richmond layout. The old record stood at 23:47. Last week, the Cats went out
against Washington and Lee's deep breathers, and again the lean captain of the locals showed his fleet heels, although he
stopped.

Lee Leads Cats In V.M.I. Meet

By BILL MORRIS

"Lightnin’" Bill Lee has come into his own. This diminutive cross-country runner came to Davidson from Warrington, Florida, four years
ago with just enough running form needed to get out of the way of a freight train. But Bill was
a boy with guts, so he went out for and played some freshman football. His sophomore year he went out
for cross-country, though still lacking a good deal of polished form, and has been one of the stalwart harriers ever
since. Last week he tied for first place with Tom Stockton and Bill Shipley in the meet with Washington and
Lee in Lexington, Va. His years of drudgeryHere is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

and back-breaking training are paying dividends. Lee's a two-mile runner on the track squad in the spring, winning that race
in meets with Wofford and Clemson last year. He has a letter in both track and cross country. Bill's a
very likeable cuss, and so good-natured that one can't help but believe Pete Whittle's claim he's "very easy to work
with." Davidson's harriers run against a pretty good V.M.I. aggregation, again in Lexington, tomorrow, and you can bet that Bill
Lee will finish in there with the best of them. The state cross-country meet will be held in Raleigh on
the State College campus course next Monday. A plaque and medals will be awarded to the winning team and individual
trophies will be given to the first ten men. At the Southern Conference meet in Durham Mon- (Continued On Page

Stockton for about 45 seconds to wait for Shipley and Lee, with Rob Henry following them in. This weekend finds
Tom, along with twin brother Dick, leading Pete Whittle’s charges against the Keydets of Virginia Military Institute. Following this, the
Cats move into Raleigh and Durham for the State and Conference meets, with Tom as a threat to bring home
honors in both. When he’s not out there running, Tom is quite a busy individual. He is President of the
Senior Class, a member of the Kappa Sigma fraternity and Omicron Delta Kappa honorary fraternity. He plans to enter the
ministry and is majoring in history in preparation for this. After graduation, he plans to enter Duke University for graduate
study. Aside from these activities and being a member one miler on the track team in the spring, Tom finds
time to maintain a substantial “B” average.

WRESTLERS BEGIN DRILLS UNDER COACH SCOTT

While wrestling coach Charlie Parker is tied up with his duties as trainer, Davidson's wrestling candidates have launched drills under
the skilled guidance of Athletic Director Paul Scott. Losing only three key men from last year’s squad, the grapplers are
deeper and boast more experience this year than they have in winters past.

Pi Kapps Lower Kappa Sigs

Keep Tie-Lead With K.A.'s

The end of another week of intramural football has come, and once again we find two teams tied for the
league lead. The two teams now tied are the KA’s and the Pi Kapps. It was a matter of touch
and go as the Pi Kapps edged the Kappa Sigs 7-6 to remain tied for first place and to eliminate
the Kappa Sigs from last week's three-way tie. As can be imagined by the score, it was one of the
closest games yet played, and it was truly the team that took advantage of the breaks that came out on
top. The KA's, however, had a much easier week than the Pi Kapps, because they were able to win their
game with the Campus Club by a 56-0 score, the highest total of the season. Also for the second place
position, we find two more teams all tied up; they are the Kappa Sigs and Sigma Chis. The Sigma Chis
moved up to their second place position by virtue of their victory over the Betas on Monday, while the Kappa
Sigs moved down to their second place spot because of a defeat by the Pi Kapps. With only about three
games remaining for most of the teams, it looks like the four top teams will be playing their hearts out
to try to eliminate the other three and come out on top. With so few games left, it looks like
one of these four teams, or the SAE's, with a 5-2 record, will come out victorious.
