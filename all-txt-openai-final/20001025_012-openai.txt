**Administration temporarily shuts down men’s basketball website due to miscommunication**

An apparent lack of communication has led President Bobby Vagt to temporarily shut down www.davidsonbasketball.net until the site can be moved onto college web servers. The website, a brainchild of the Fast Break Club, was designed primarily “to get the word about Davidson basketball out to recruits and fans in an innovative way,” explained assistant men’s basketball coach Matt Matheny. The money to finance the site was provided by the Fast Break Club, the support group for Davidson men’s basketball.

The site was active temporarily around the start of the school year but is currently “under construction” as it is moved onto college web servers. The site www.davidsonbasketball.net contained many interesting features such as a virtual tour of Belk Arena, player and staff profiles, and was to include video highlights in the near future. The website was quickly developed and placed on the internet. “We had a tremendously positive response the small time it was on the internet, as to the way it looked and the way it got our message out,” said Matheny.

But the organizers of the site forgot one very small but important step in its development. “I was not contacted before the site went up,” said President Vagt. “I had no prior knowledge of the website until someone said, ‘Hey, have you seen this?’” Vagt’s response was to temporarily shut down the website. “If there’s a Davidson website about a Davidson program, it ought to be accessible through www.davidson.edu, and it ought to be hosted by our server,” explained Vagt. “We don’t want to take the chance that a well-intended person would do something that would jeopardize our status.”

Control over the content of the website was an important issue to Davidson administration. “There was some admissions language on there that hadn’t been written by admissions staff—that’s the consistency we’re looking for,” commented athletics director Jim Murphy. “The site went up a little bit early, it’s not anybody’s fault, but anticipation for the final product led to jumping the gun. It appears that the vast majority will transfer to the college server without any problem.”

But what about the Fast Break Club’s right to post freely on the internet? President Vagt explained, “The Fast Break Club is an official part of Davidson College. Therefore, www.davidsonbasketball.net is an official college website and should be on our server. Something like catkid.com is completely different, as that site has no affiliation with the school whatsoever.” Coach Matheny agreed, saying, “The Fast Break Club is part of Davidson College, and therefore is definitely under its jurisdiction. The internet brings a ton of new technology. I obviously didn’t ask the right questions during the development of the site.”

Now that all the major players appear to be on the same page, the website should return shortly—but on college servers. “Everyone agrees it is a great website. After some minor modifications, it should be up shortly,” said Murphy. Added Matheny, “This is only a minor setback before we get it live again on the Davidson server. President Vagt and Jim Murphy have both been supportive of us getting it back up—the right way.”going to be in addition to what we already have on davidson.edu. The college already has a great, very informative website that www.davidsonbasketball.net will supplement. It’s going to be a great recruiting tool for us.”

Voice of Cats Frank Santore resigns

The voice of the Wildcats no longer belongs to Frank Santore. After six years as Davidson’s radio commentator, Santore resigned in early October, leaving athletics officials scurrying to find a replacement. Ticket Office Manager Lee Sargent will join longtime color commentator Dave Fagg in the broadcast booth for Davidson’s four remaining football games, said athletic director Jim Murphy. The school hopes to name a replacement in the next few weeks from a pool of about six candidates, Murphy said.

“We’re on a pretty quick timeline,” he said. Murphy declined to name the candidates but said the school is seeking someone with broadcasting experience and who is familiar with Davidson and its profile. Broadcasters are paid what he calls a “nominal fee” on a “per broadcast” basis. “They’re not in it for the money,” said Murphy.

The school’s most pressing priority is finding someone to broadcast men’s basketball games, which begin Nov. 6. In the spring, a more long-term search may begin, he said. According to Murphy, Santore quit shortly after walking out of the booth before a men’s home soccer game against Virginia Military Academy that he was scheduled to broadcast on Oct. 3. When reached, Santore declined to comment on the record. But it is widely believed that Santore, who commuted from Tennessee, left because of a perceived lack of respect from officials in the athletic department.

Murphy said he was disappointed to receive the resignation, but that Santore was given fair treatment.

“We’ve tried to treat Frank as a professional,” said Murphy. “We certainly had disagreements. (But) in my mind there was no lack of respect.”

The Davidson radio network faces heavy competition from area schools such as Duke and Clemson, Murphy said. Mooresville’s WHIP (1350 AM) carries football games. Two stations, WAGI (105.3 FM) out of Gaffney, SC and Charlotte’s WMIX (106.1 FM), carry men’s basketball games. Most fans listen to games over the phone or Internet, Murphy said. By calling TEAMLINE at 1-800-846-4700 and entering team code 1143, fans from anywhere in the U.S. can listen to selected games for as low as 15 cents a minute. Games can also be heard for free on BroadcastAmerica.com.

Murphy said having a strong radio network is only one of the athletic department’s many priorities. “Extra air time is not going to enhance the experience of our students,” he said. “But it’s nice to have the publicity for the school. It’s a (public relations) effect more than anything else.”
