**Why we must learn to love our brother**

*Tan Scully*

I learned much about the United States while away in Central America this past term that was unnerving and disillusioning. The U.S. claims that it symbolizes and upholds democracy, liberty, and justice worldwide; however, the truth is that it is increasingly committing gross injustices against, and obstructing the basic human rights of, millions of people and independent nations throughout the world. Nowhere is this more evident than in South and Central America.

The United States’ role in Latin America since World War I has not been exemplary. Whenever a Latin American government has emerged that has not seen eye to eye with Washington’s economic and political interests, and has tried to fight growing poverty by initiating land reform to distribute wealth among the people, or develop a foreign policy independent from that of the U.S., the U.S. has overthrown that government through either direct intervention with U.S. military forces or covert C.I.A. machinations.

Once these governments have been sufficiently subverted, a government friendly to U.S. interests has come to power. In 1950, the U.S. Undersecretary of State for Latin America was quoted as saying, “No government is to be allowed to come into existence anywhere in the Caribbean or Central America which does not have Washington’s approval, and a government from which Washington withdraws its approval is not to be allowed to continue to exist in the region.” Little has changed. Almost 40 years after that statement was made, the Reagan administration is following the same reasoning in its foreign policy towards Latin America.

Some examples of U.S. intervention in the affairs of “sovereign” Latin American nations over the last century include: the U.S. Marine occupation of Nicaragua from 1911-1932; the C.I.A. executed coup in Guatemala in 1954; the U.S. military invasion of the Dominican Republic in 1965; and the 1973 coup in Chile, which until that time had had a strong tradition of civilian democratic rule and has now suffered under a repressive military dictatorship for the last fifteen years. In the late 1970s and 1980s, the world has witnessed U.S. trained troops in Guatemala, El Salvador, and the infamous “contras” in Nicaragua burn numerous peasant townships to the ground and massacre thousands of innocent civilians. Human suffering in those countries has reached intolerable levels.

The number of Mayan Indian townships and people who have been “terminated” over the past ten years in Guatemala stand at 450 villages and between 50,000 - 100,000 Indians. Admittedly, some of this death and destruction has been perpetrated by Guatemalan guerrillas, but the majority of it was carried out by the Israeli-backed Guatemalan army. (Under lots of pressure from human rights groups, the U.S. cut off military aid to Guatemala in 1982. The Guatemalan military had gotten completely out of control; its human rights record was atrocious. Still, one has to question whether the U.S. really did cut off aid. After cutting off military aid, Israel, which is the largest recipient of U.S. military aid in the world, stepped right in and trained and supplied the Guatemalan military.)

In El Salvador, where a civil war has been underway for ten years, more than 2 million people out of a total population of 5 million have been killed, fled the country for personal safety, or become internally displaced. Just as in Guatemala, the army has been responsible for the majority of mass killings and disappearances. In fighting the Salvadoran guerrilla forces, U.S. military advisors have promoted a tactic used in Vietnam: the scorched-earth policy.

As a result, hundreds of thousands of poor campesinos have been left homeless. (And one wonders why the war is getting worse rather than better.) In 1978, the then president of El Salvador, Roberto D’Aubuisson, ordered the assassination of the Archbishop of El Salvador, Monsignor Oscar Romero. Romero was then killed while saying mass. Archbishop Romero was an advocate of the poor - he called for land reform.

In Nicaragua, the war goes on and on. Death, destruction, and hunger have become endemic. Meanwhile, Honduras has been converted into a U.S. aircraft carrier to launch overt--and covert--attacks against Nicaragua. In its proxy war on Nicaragua, the U.S. has even chosen to ignore international law. Several years ago, the U.S. mined Nicaraguan harbors in violation of international maritime and sovereignty laws and was then indicted by the World Court for its actions. The Reagan administration chose to ignore the indictment and proceeded to embark on such inane ventures as supplying the contras with arms purchased with profits from arms deals with Iran. And how can one forget the Grenada invasion, for which the U.S. received worldwide denunciation?

Another questionable side of U.S.-Latin American relations often overlooked is the involvement of U.S. Evangelical Churches in Latin America. Twenty years ago, there were few U.S. Evangelical Churches in the business of “saving the souls” of Latin Americans. Latin America was Catholic territory. However, when the Latin American Catholic Church, both on the grass-roots level and within
