9 am Fall Term Examinations Begin Chambers Building

The college calendar calls for exams to be taken November 18, 19, 20, and 22. Not all professors use the
self-scheduled procedures described here, so each student should determine definitely the exam arrangements for each course. If self-scheduled procedures are
used, then the following instructions apply.

The examination envelopes turned in earlier in the week will be available to you during each examination session on November
18, 19, 20, and 22. You do not need to specify in advance when you will write a particular exam.

Go to Chambers Banquet Hall between 8:40 and 9:15 for morning sessions and 1:40 and 2:15 for afternoon sessions and
ask for the envelope containing the exam you want to take at that time. The envelopes will be arranged alphabetically
by the student’s name. The yellow bordered card will be detached and retained by the examination center.

Go to any classroom in Chambers Building and write the exam; please note that Room 310 in Chambers is to
be used exclusively by students authorized by the professor to use tables, charts, etc.

The envelope, with red bordered card still attached and containing the questions and your answers, may be returned to the
examination center as early as 9:45 for the morning and 2:45 for the afternoon and must be returned before the
deadline of 12:15 for the morning and 5:15 for the afternoon. The honor pledge must be signed at the examination
center table as you turn in the exam envelope.

The yellow bordered card, now receipted by the examination center, will be given to you; hold that card until a
grade for the course is received; in case of any irregularity, it is your evidence that you turned in the
exam envelope containing the exam materials.

Registrar Richard C. Burts said, “Our continuing concern for the Honor System and the attendant strains on it occasioned by
self-scheduled exams justify our...soliciting continuing student support for the Honor System.”
