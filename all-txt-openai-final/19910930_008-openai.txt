Inside Art

The poem below was submitted by Adriana Tavernise, '93.

We must protect the children, she

whispers, as if she is used

to being silent. They are green,

and not yet used to the cold, we will

lose them to the early frost. But how,

I ask her, we do not know when it will

come, they will be reached by tides

that we are helpless to stop. We never could

stop them before, when they came

for us.

Maybe, if we would have spoken,

they might have gone away. We could have

frightened them with our voices, they would

not have touched us. Then, I told her,

We must teach the children to speak.
