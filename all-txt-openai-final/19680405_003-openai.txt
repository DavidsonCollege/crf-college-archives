**ADVANCED ROTC’S TWO FACES**

A chief advantage of the advanced ROTC program here is the policy that juniors and seniors have to take ROTC
for only one semester per year. Naturally, the policy produces starting changes—one semester the advanced student is gung-ho, the other
he’s often mischievous. But all the while, he gets that 50 dollars a month.

**Trustees Will Decide Future Of Davidson ROTC Program**

“A college which purports to be Christian should question ROTC on Christian grounds,” says Dr. Ernest B. Patterson, “and Christianity
is basically pacifist, not militaristic.”

“Davidson has existed as a good college with compulsory ROTC for 30 years,” says Dr. William O. Puckett. Arguments like
those will be in the minds of trustees when they meet in May to decide the future of ROTC at
Davidson. The trustees must decide on a Blue Sky committee proposal to make ROTC voluntary. The trustees deferred the decision
when the resolution came before them in December in order to gather more information and opinions. The faculty approved the
Blue Sky recommendations by a vote of 38-27.

Colonel Frederick B. Outlaw, Davidson's professor of military science, is known to have spoken in the past in behalf of
a compulsory ROTC program with credit for both basic and advanced ROTC. In an interview this week, Outlaw said he
was not personally inflexible about changes in the program, but that he felt that a good ROTC program at Davidson
is possible only if it remains compulsory.

On the question of academic credit, Outlaw said, “The military science program offers one skill which can be relevant to
a person's life, and therefore, though not part of the liberal arts, it warrants academic credit and should remain a
compulsory part of the curriculum.” Outlaw cited learning to speak on their feet and acceptance of responsibility through leadership as
the things students could learn in the ROTC program. “Many Davidson graduates have written me in the past saying they
had benefited from their completion of the ROTC program and were glad they had had the opportunity to be in
it,” Outlaw said.

Regarding the course material, Outlaw said that as Professor of Military Science he has the freedom to change 25 percent
of the course content prescribed by the Army. Outlaw outlined tentative plans for the ROTC program under the new curriculum.
The basic course would be one hour per week for five of the student's first six terms. Completion of the
entire basic course would earn the student academic credit for one course. In the advanced course, one course credit would
be awarded for the junior year and one course credit for the senior year. Each of these would be taught
within a single term just as any other course.

Interviews this week with several faculty members brought out great differences of opinion. Patterson, professor of economics, said he was
disappointed when the trustees postponed their decision on the Blue Sky proposal. Patterson said he feels no college or university
should have ROTC. Patterson said that military training contradicts the purposes of a liberal arts college. “Anything of value in
the liberal arts that is taught in ROTC could be taught better in the regular class,” added Patterson.

The ROTC program is uneconomical for the government in comparison with what could be done with post-graduation officer training, said
Patterson. Patterson went on to say that only opposition by colleges had thwarted the attempts of the Department of Defense
to phase out the ROTC program.

Dr. Samuel Maloney, a professor of Bible and religion, said he was "...not unhappy that ROTC had been compulsory.” He
added he would like to see a strong voluntary program at Davidson, adding that other schools of Davidson's size have
good voluntary programs. Maloney said that he has not objected to credit being given for ROTC. He expressed concern over
how credit could be granted under the Blue Sky curriculum. Maloney said he saw no contradiction in the existence of
an ROTC unit on the campus of church-related Davidson. “Davidson College is a college and not an institutional church,” said
Maloney.

Puckett expressed strong support for the retention of the compulsory basic course and for granting credit for all ROTC courses.
Puckett described ROTC as "...a worthwhile course, a good part of a man’s education—it certainly was of mine.” Puckett went
on to say that Davidson “has to prepare people for life in the world, and right now the military is
a fact of life.” “A school as small as Davidson could possibly maintain an ROTC unit on a voluntary basis
right now during the Vietnam war,” said Puckett, “but not later.”

**Army’s Waste Of Time Worth More Than $50, Senior Says**

ED. NOTE: The Writer is a senior not taking advanced ROTC.

It is difficult to look back now and determine the basis on which I decided not to enter the advanced
ROTC program in my junior year at Davidson. I'm tempted to dismiss the entire question by replying “it seemed like
the thing to do at the time.” Nor would this be inaccurate, except by omission, for it describes exactly how
I approached the question. As little as I may have realized it at the time, however, many considerations—some significant, others
trivial—entered into my final decision.

I did not refuse to enter the program because of the morality question involved in our position in Vietnam. But
I must admit that our position in Vietnam seems more immoral daily as the possibility of my participation in it
becomes more immediate. In fact, I don’t believe I even allowed the possibility that I might be forced to serve
in Vietnam to enter into my decision one way or the other.

**BIG JUMP**

The Tower Test? It provided little more than a vivid backdrop, impressing me with the importance of my decision. My
initial objections consisted of such apparently trivial things as my natural aversion to marching, taking orders, and living “by the
numbers.” But most of all, I found myself overwhelmed by the monumental waste of time it all seemed to be.
The most attractive aspect was the 50 dollars a month, every month for two whole years. In the end, I
decided that although I may have wasted my time for money in the past and would no doubt do so
in the future, the waste of time the Army represented was worth decidedly more than 50 dollars each month.

Such reasons seem trivial even to me. In the end, my decision represented deeper thoughts and feelings. I found that
I objected to the very concept of the citizen’s army raised by conscription. I resented wasting two very important years,
not in the service of my country, but in the service of an organization whose way of life I despised.
I do not mean to shrink from my responsibilities to my country or my fellow man. Nor do I expect
this obligation to consist of just two years of service in the armed forces. I intend to serve my country
for the rest of my life but have no desire to do so in the uniform of the behemoth United
States Army. In the end, I chose the security of freedom and uncertainty over that of commitment to an organization
and cause I found opposed to my own way of life.

Being as I am, I have never regretted my decision, though I have often wished I could have chosen the
easier way.

Before each party weekend, there is a long line of Davidson students outside the ROTC Department. They are waiting to
replenish their resources for the weekend with the $50 check which advanced ROTC students receive each month of the school
year. This money, and the deferment for graduate school which Davidson students have received so regularly in the past, seem
to be the predominant reasons that students enter advanced ROTC.

The problem of getting a deferment has become more acute recently with the Army's decision to draft graduate students before
the next school year. Many graduate students have applied for admission to a special 2-year ROTC program, begun in 1964,
which would allow them to finish their schooling before they enter the Army. “The ROTC department can no longer assure
Davidson students of this deferment,” said Maj. Joe B. Crawley of the Davidson ROTC Department, “but at least the opportunity
for one is assured and the chances of getting one are still very good because of the quality of the
student here.”

The person who enters advanced ROTC currently has the same obligation as the person who is drafted. He must serve
two years on active duty, two years of active reserve, and two years of inactive reserve. He can work off
the inactive reserve requirement during graduate school. “The advanced ROTC student will almost surely get one of the three branches
of the Army he selects,” said Crawley, “whereas the draftee is put wherever men are needed most, usually in a
combat branch.” One of the three branches the advanced student selects as his choices must be a combat branch, however.
This year over half the Davidson seniors taking ROTC got their first choice.

“In my opinion, the student will have a better chance to further his education and to use what he has
learned at Davidson if he is assigned to a branch which parallels his field of study,” said Crawley. The advanced
student will have to take one course apiece his junior and senior years under the new curriculum. He must also
attend a six-week summer training camp at Fort Bragg either before or after his senior year. He is paid about
$150 per month at summer camp, plus six cents per mile travel expense. When he enters the Army as a
second lieutenant, he is paid $500 a month, compared to the $90 per month paid to privates. If he waits
until he finishes graduate school, he will enter the Army as a first lieutenant and will receive $700 a month.

“The major disadvantage I can see in the advanced program is that the student is committing himself to service in
the Army,” said Crawley, “and some students may not wish to do this while they are at Davidson.” Other disadvantages
frequently cited are the relatively inferior nature of the ROTC curriculum and the fact that some students wish to enter
another branch of the armed forces. Students who plan to attend medical school or seminary often do not enter the
program because completion of these schools will excuse them from having to serve in combat.

Summer Camp Teaches Students Ways Of The Foot Soldier

College students take advanced ROTC for reasons ranging from wanting to serve as an officer to beating the draft, but
the price they pay for all “the good deals” of ROTC is summer camp. It is an experience best described
as “barely tolerable” during its duration and modified to “I’ll never do it again” when recalling its virtues. ROTC summer
camp is a five-week session where future officers are treated like the men they will command, learning the bare fundamentals
of being a junior infantry officer. Only a minority of cadets will follow a course in the Army which will
require additional infantry training, so most of summer camp is an introduction to the role of the small infantry unit
and its tactics in the basic unit of the Army.

Davidson students attend the Third Army camp at Ft. Bragg during late June and July, and most of those who
have been there feel that if there was ever a place meant to be an Army reservation, Ft. Bragg is
it. Within its far-flung boundaries, there is said to be a section similar to every type of war zone imaginable.
When the wind blows, Ft. Bragg is relatively pleasant. When it does not, Ft. Bragg can be unbearable. The Army's
advance bulletins make Ft. Bragg seem like a resort with their liberal mention of golf, tennis, and swimming. Most cadets
never see the tennis courts or the swimming pool. ROTC camp is business, and most of the time that means
an exhausting 18-hour day. From rising well before the sun to polishing boots late at night on a fire escape,
it demands all the energy a cadet can muster, and usually a bit more.

That is not to say that summer camp is impossible. The Army, master of debriefing, makes a cadet do nothing
that is too difficult for him to do. An intelligent college student who is in average physical shape can negotiate
summer camp with little trouble. The important conflict is within the cadet himself: How much can he take? ROTC camp
places a premium on self-discipline. There can be none of the casualness on the drill field as here at Davidson.
Mistakes are caught by men who live by the “Drill and Ceremonies” field manual of the Army. Punishment is physical
in the form of push-ups, but the individual must learn to take correction and punishment as it is given, or
lose the respect of his officers and peers.

Major activities include marksmanship, small unit tactics, communications, patrols, and other related fields which are vital to the infantry platoon
leader. Cadet leadership positions rotate throughout the session. A three-day field training exercise and a written exam climax the training
activities. Little attention is given to drill and ceremonies because it is an everyday manner of moving from place to
place. The amazing part about summer camp is how much of the knowledge is actually retained by the cadet. He
has little time for outside distractions such as newspapers. He is as close to isolation as he probably ever will
be.

Davidson students generally do very well at summer camp, although other cadets are shocked to discover that only one semester
of instruction is required per year. But the lack of practical work shows in the early performance of the Davidson
student. What he lacks in experience, he usually makes up in brains. Davidson students generally find themselves among the small
“brain trust” of each platoon which leads the members of that unit in its advance planning. Though few west of
Georgia have heard of the school, it is not hard for a Davidson student to stand out amongst competition from
Stetson, Jacksonville State (Ala.), Gordon Military College, and Florida State. What the North Georgia cadets are to experience, Davidson is
to leadership.

When the ROTC cadet arrives at Ft. Bragg, the furs and plumes of college ROTC are over. Very few cadets
are dropped from the program, and many find that they must conduct deep introspection of themselves. Summer camp never hurts
anyone, but it forces each cadet who attends to accept the Army motto: “There's a right way and a wrong
way, and there's the Army way.” Whether he realizes it or not, the college student leaves summer camp with the
basic introduction to Army life which the Army has presented. Summer camp is the foundation of Army ROTC.
