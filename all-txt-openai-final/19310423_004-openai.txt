follows: “Advise Americans this government cannot undertake their general protection in Nicaragua with American forces. The State department recommends that
Americans who feel insecure withdraw from the country or seek protection in coast towns, where they may be evacuated if
necessary. Americans remain in Nicaragua at their own risk and must not expect protection from American forces.”

Davidson Alumni Will Meet in Richmond, Va.
Dr. C. M. Richards Will Address Body as Faculty Representative—Large Group Located There

Over seventy-five Davidson College alumni, residing in Richmond, Petersburg and Woodberry Forest, have been invited to a dinner-meeting of the
Richmond local chapter next Friday night at 7 o’clock, which will be given at Union Theological Seminary, Richmond. Dr. C.
M. Richards, member of the Davidson College faculty, will represent the college and make an address to the alumni.

It was originally planned to have a meeting of this chapter early in April, but due to conflicting dates it
was necessary to postpone it. A particular effort was made to have it before the graduation exercises of Union Seminary,
where so many Davidson men are students, and satisfactory arrangements were made through Rev. D. T. Caldwell, ’14, of Petersburg,
Va., president of the chapter. He co-operated with authorities at Union Seminary. Rev. Geo. C. Bellingrath, ’18, is secretary of
the club.

Next to the meeting of the New York chapter, the attendance of the Richmond organization is largest. Not only are
many of the Seminary students alumni of Davidson, but several members of the faculty of the Seminary are likewise graduates
of this institution. Approximately 30 other alumni are located in Richmond in various capacities.

This will probably be the last local chapter meeting of the present scholastic session. In all likelihood an attempt will
be made to get the Davidson alumni together at the annual meeting of the Southern Presbyterian General Assembly at Montreat,
which sessions begin May 28. However, this meeting will have alumni attending from all over the South, similar to that
at the World Congress at Chattanooga in February.

Dr. E. S. Avery, ’25, who has been practicing medicine at Maiden, N. C., has been elected to and has
accepted the post of assistant superintendent of the Forsyth Tuberculosis Hospital, at Winston-Salem.
