Phi and Eu Societies have a long history

By Towner Blackstock

It’s hard to know what to say about the Phi and Eu Societies. Most Davidson students drift by the original 1849 Literary Society Halls on the old quadrangle of campus with nothing more than a casual thought. Most of us have our minds set on getting to class, finishing that paper, or getting to bed after that traumatic all-nighter. Eu and Phi Halls stand like museum relics, showpieces of history for gawking tourist-like parents to visit as their children finally graduate. But there’s much more there than what most folks get the chance to see.

The Eumenean Debating Society and the Philanthropic Literary Society still exist, and even meet regularly in their original upstairs meeting rooms. But what to say about these two groups? Originally founded in 1837 by Davidson students, they served “as a means of improvement: not to be secured in the regular college work,” according to the Eumenean minutes. Since “college work” boiled down to sheer rote memorization of classical languages, mathematics and, in the latter two years, some sciences, students had nary a chance to think for themselves in class. So society activity took up the slack, according to the Preamble of the Phi Society, providing for “the study of rhetoric, logic, and ethic” and seeking to inculcate “a high regard for virtue and truth.” They also provided a source of friendship and mutual aid among “those we feel interested and deem worthy of our esteem.” To this end, membership in each group came by invitation only, and all business was strictly secret.

In the twice-weekly meetings, students accepted topics for presentation the next meeting. Some would debate the topic, while others would write formal papers or deliver speeches. Topics included political and social issues ranging from the justice of the Mexican war to “is female education of as much importance as male education.” To support this rigorous self-education, the societies built impressive libraries. Phi’s grew to 1,000 volumes by 1846. The college library grew much more slowly, since the curriculum did not require the kind of intense research the literary societies did. Only in 1886 did the three libraries merge for a total of 10,000 volumes.

Phi and Eu that year published the Davidson Monthly, featuring original articles and works, and later news. Renamed the Davidson College Magazine in 1897, it continued under society sponsorship until superseded by the college-funded Davidsonian in 1916. The societies frankly dominated every aspect of campus life. In addition to debate, speaking, and writing, they acted as student government associations. Occasionally, they even expelled members from the society, and even from the college (for plagiarism, and with the ex post facto support of the faculty). In this way they provided the roots of our current honor system.

But like today, not everything worked out so smoothly. Rivalry led to division, such as the time the entire Eu membership threatened to leave if they did not get as many dorm rooms as the Phis. It also led to unity, when in 1854 both memberships did leave in protest of a fellow student’s expulsion. Over the years, the societies lost their secret aspects, and lost some prominence as social alternatives increased around the campus. The train eventually stopped in town, and faculty discipline relaxed enough to allow greater student freedoms. Fraternities arrived, six strong in 1896, and the curriculum expanded to include opportunities for formal writing and debate. The functions of the societies slipped away to college-sponsored groups like the SGA, Honor Council, various publications, and the Union. Even the Commencement ceremonies, once entirely organized by Eu and Phi, finally fell under college control. With these functions went membership, with numbers dwindling since the thirties to the point that each group went defunct at one time or another.

Today, Phi continues to meet on Sundays at nine. Usually members read works along a given topic, and occasionally sponsor

Eu was revived just a couple of years ago and held a prospective meeting last Thursday. Lately, they’ve been known for their “coffee houses,” evening times when anyone can drop by Eu Hall, have a drink, and talk about books, issues, or whatever. Keep your eyes open for each group’s flyers around campus advertising their events. And just so you know, Eu is the one closest to Main Street; Phi is the one closest to Chambers.

One hundred and forty-three years have passed since Eu and Phi Halls were built with funds raised by the Eumenean and Philanthropic Societies. Like neo-classical American temples, the Halls stand, reminding us of what things once were like, and how Davidson is not always so much different as it is grown up. The societies themselves have been displaced as the direct tenets of our honor and integrity, but that spirit lingers on and pervades our entire Davidson experience.

### Campaign for Davidson well on way to $150 million mark

Campaign continued from pg 1

$45 million to enhance the physical facilities of the campus. As the number of students increases, so do the number of needs. Baker Sports Complex was one of the first major improvements afforded by the Campaign; new student housing and a new college Union may be later developments.

The campaign hopes to diversify and enrich the student body with $25 million for scholarships and student support programs. “Since the campaign began,” Jamie May says, “73 new scholarships have been created.” Another $25 million will be put towards strengthening academic resources by improving the library, attracting visiting scholars and lecturers, and enhancing junior/senior year options. The last $15 million will go to strengthen the Annual Fund.

Briefly, the Annual Fund finances approximately 11% of the yearly operating budget. The Annual Fund takes care of the difference between what students pay to attend Davidson and what it actually costs to educate them. Although 82% of the $150 million has been raised, this does not mean that Davidson can go on a spending frenzy anytime soon. Some of the money is pledged and therefore will not be expendable until the pledges are paid, which usually takes 2-3 years. Even money that is not pledged is not usually available for immediate use, since many donations go to the Endowment.

The Endowment is similar to a trust fund, because the school only spends 5% of its endowment earnings (which come from investments). The other 95% of the earnings are reinvested in the principal, enabling the Endowment to grow as costs rise. Currently, Davidson has four different firms managing the Endowment as effectively and with as little risk as possible. This kind of conservative planning only gives Davidson between $9-$15 million cash to spend per year, even though so much money has been donated.

Vast amounts of money come from parents and friends of Davidson College, but foundations who are aware of the excellence of the faculty and student body here also contribute. According to Toby Bethea, Vice President of Institutional Advancement, “President Emeritus Sam Spencer really brought foundation awareness of Davidson up to par, and people like Dr. Kuykendall have enhanced it.” The largest contribution so far was the Duke Endowment at $7,976,000.

The Campaign for Davidson is obviously a milestone in the history of Davidson. In a recent survey of college fund-raising conducted by Claremont McKenna College, Davidson ranked second only to Williams College in monetary gifts to private schools for the fiscal year 92-93.
