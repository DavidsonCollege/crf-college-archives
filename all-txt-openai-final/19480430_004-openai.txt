SAY—“I SAW IT IN THE DAVIDSONIAN!”

NO OTHER CIGARETTE CAN TAKE CHESTERFIELD’S PLACE WITH ME. THEY SATISFY.

WHY... I smoke Chesterfield
(FROM A SERIES OF STATEMENTS BY PROMINENT TOBACCO FARMERS)
Liggett & Myers buy top quality cigarette tobacco and pay top prices for it... nobody will average paying more than
they do year in and year out. I’ve been smoking Chesterfields ever since I’ve been smoking. I just like them...
they have real tobacco flavor.
