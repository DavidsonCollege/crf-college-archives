WOMEN’S SOCCER HOSTS YMCA SKILLS
DEVELOPMENT CLINIC FOR MEN’S SOCCER

After his team lost to Wofford
Thursday evening of last week,
Davidson Men’s Soccer coach
Steve Blackpool dropped his team
off at the YMCA skills clinic host-
ed by the Davidson College
Women's Soccer Team.

The clinic was intended for indi-
viduals between the ages of six and
but, considering the men's
team's heinous goal differential, an
exception was made.

Night with the Cats a Success

The Yowl conducted a brief
interview with librarian Gertrude
Milford, 85, concerning the highly
publicized “Night With The Cats”
held at her quaint, ranch-style
home in Mooresville.

Yowl: So...exactly how many
cats do you have here?

Milford: Currently there are 38:
11 Tabby cats, five alley cats, three
Turkish Angoras, six California
Spangled, a dozen kittens and a
panther.

Yowl: A panther?

Milford: Oh yes. Marv. He’s
taxidermied.

Yowl: Is it true that ESPNU was
here last night filming your record-
breaking cat collection?

Milford: Yes, they brought all of
their cameras and the whole expe-
rience was simply charming.

Yowl: What was the premise for
the event?

Milford: It was a chance for
community members to come meet
all of the cats. I dressed them up
and they did dances and stylishly
lapped milk for anyone who want-
ed to watch.

Yowl: Were you at full cat-paci-
ty?

Milford: What?

Yowl: Overall, did you feline
there was a good turnout?

Milford: I don’t think I under-
stand the question.

Sophomore Owen Clemens
summed things up when he said,
“Frankly speaking, dancing to
‘Bye, bye, bye’ is a lot more fun
than practicing soccer. Whenever
times get tough on the field, our
captains will call for this awesome
10-minute interlude where we all
take off our shinguards and put on
temporary tattoos of tribal symbols
just like real boy bands have. Then
we just let loose for a couple songs
in the center circle of the field!

became the first player
in the history of YMCA
clinics to be red carded
during World Cuppies
after his absurd attempt
at a bicycle kick caught
nine-year-old Charlie
Newsome in the throat.

Clinic officials were surprised to
see the men’s team alongside
younger players, but they quickly
accepted their desire to improve.

Yowl: This really doesn’t have
much to do with basketball, does
it?

Milford: No, and I don’t know
where you boys got that impres-
sion. My cats are pretty nimble
with their balls though.

Yowl: Balls?

Milford: Of yarn. Would you like
to see a trick?

Yowl: No.

Yowl: Seriously no. Do all your
cats have names?

Milford: Oh yes. I name them
after my ex-husbands.

Yowl: Really...

Milford: Are you gentlemen with
the IRS?

Yowl: No, ma’am. We’re with
the Yowl.

Milford: Yowl? I’m afraid I
don’t understand.

Yowl: Thank you for your time.

“Physically they're much larger
than the average participant, but, in
terms of finesse, some of these
guys have the footwork of a
Clydesdale,” women's coach
Michelle Bakers said.

Lilly ‘10 coaches fifth graders
against the Davidson Men’s team.

The women's team started the
clinic with jumping jacks and fast
footwork drills, followed up with
Knock-Out and Sharks and
Minnows.

“The guys did okay with the
morning session,” Women's capt-
ain Trish Venturini '08 said. “But I
think some of them were pretty
tuckered out from the night
before.”

A lunch of grilled cheese and Hi-
C and an indoor viewing of “The
Big Green” provided a much need-
ed break for the men's team, some
of whom had grown progressively
crankier throughout the morning.

“Frankly speaking,
dancing to ‘Bye,
Bye, Bye’ is a lot
more fun than prac-
ticing soccer.”

Chase Easton '08 became the
first player in the history of YMCA
clinics to be red carded during
World Cuppies after an absurd
attempt at a bicycle kick caught
nine-year-old Charlie Newsome in
the throat.

“My boo-boo hurt more here
than here,” Charlie later said,
pointing to his left temple. He was
later diagnosed with a third-degree
concussion. Chase sulked on the
bleachers and picked four-leaf
clovers for the remainder of the
clinic.
