Negro Civic Center Plans Fall Program
Y. M. C. A. Gift Fund Helps Build ‘David McLean Community Hut’

Scheduled to open this fall is the Davidson Colored Community Center, a local project made possible by last year's Christmas Y. M. C. A. Gift Fund. This new asset has been named the David McLean Community Center in honor of last year's benefactor. The center was completed in May, and its construction was overseen by Mr. Ivey of Charlotte. Contributions came from various sources, including Sears-Roebuck, Efird’s, Haverty, Sterchi’s, Smith-Wadsworth, Pound and Moore, Paul & Crymes, and others. Mrs. Steele and Mrs. McGavock Hampton were also instrumental in the fundraising efforts. Mr. McLean spent four years working among the negroes in the Colored Work Department while studying at Union Theological Seminary in Richmond.

Gwynn Urges Public School Bible Course
Davidson Educator Addresses North Carolina Council Of Churches

Dr. P. H. Gwynn of the Davidson Faculty, in addressing the annual meeting of the North Carolina Council of Churches on September 26 in Thomasville, pointed out the need for public school Bible courses. He emphasized the exchange of ideas and the stimulation of interest in bringing the Bible to public schools. His speech has aroused much interest, and he is receiving inquiries and requests for assistance from ministers and school authorities who wish to inaugurate this project. In addition to being the Chairman of the North Carolina Committee, Dr. Gwynn is a member of the Council of Religious Education, which includes such prominent North Carolinians as W. E. Price, Dr. Frank Graham, and Dr. W. P. Few.

One crew, including Dan Hodges, Arch Taylor, Bill Summers, Tony Darby, Preston Oliver, and George McCormack, traveled to Raleigh via Salem, G. C., and St. Mary's.

DELAY
The lateness in publication of the first issue of the Davidsonian this year is due to the fact that Fred Little, Business Manager, was called to the law school, and a new business manager could not be secured in time for publication last week. Jack Covington has since then been elected to this post, however, and the paper will make its weekly appearance regularly throughout the remainder of the year.

COVINGTON RECEIVES
Past Student To Talk Here
(Continued from Page One)

Rev. Julian Lake will be the vespers speaker Sunday evening, October 6. The Rev. Lake, who is a Davidson alumnus, did his graduate study at Union Theological Seminary in Richmond.He was ordained into the Southern Presbyterian Church and preached a number of years at Warrenton, Va. Later he was called as pastor of the Oakland Avenue Presbyterian Church in Rock Hill. Rev. Mr. Lake gave a sermon at one of Davidson's vespers services last year. He was so enthusiastically received that he has been asked to chair the committee on Week-Day Religious Education.

In the afternoon, they would go to some football, basketball, or baseball game, according to the season. In the evening, all could assemble in the banquet hall for a meal at which a speaker from the college could explain the aims and ambitions of the school. The institution of a Dad's Day here would go far toward the better understanding of problems that sometimes arise between the fathers and the sons in college and between the fathers and the college itself.

Vesper service replaces compulsory attendance at church. In the past, Omicron Delta Kappa has done admirable work in sponsoring group migrations to the campus. Either they, the YMCA, or the college itself could make Dad's Day an event second to none at Davidson.

A number of years ago, Lenoir Rhyne College installed one of the first sets of lights in the state. This saved football at Lenoir Rhyne. Davidson can do the same. Now that we have one of the best-lighted fields in the country and now that we are playing night games, we will keep some of our supporters from making the trip to other schools. There are many students from nearby towns who will find it much more convenient to run over to a night game after work on Saturday. Frankly, I approve.
