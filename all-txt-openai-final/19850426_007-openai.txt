THE DAVIDSONIAN

Music, Sun, Fun, Frisbee, And Friends

It’s spring... Contagiously warm sunshine drove almost the entire Davidson Community outside to celebrate good music, good food, and good
weather.

This past weekend the Davidson College Union gave students more reason to be outside than mere tanning. Friday afternoon all
relaxed to the reggae sounds of the Awareness Art Ensemble on Richardson Field. Free beverages and frisbee flying added to
the occasion and even a hacky sack or two was lazily batted about.

Eating houses and fraternities formally joined the party Friday night. Fancy dinners, wild carousing, and crowded hot tubs kept the
revelry going.

Jazz specialist Fred Storie and Flight 108 set the mood Saturday night behind the Commons. After the music, free pizza
and soda were provided, and then the games began... Students excelled at everything from pie-eating to seed spitting and from
egg-tossing to betting on the winning rat. Wilson Lowery’s cartoons were a big hit, as was simply working on that
tan. There were frisbees, kites, an SAE waterslide, and even a hot air balloon. But the merry-making didn’t stop at
sundown.

The rocking sounds of Powerplay electrified the Commons Saturday night. The traditional dance was then followed by the traditional and
delicious breakfast in the 900 Room to the marvelous tunes of Bobby Houck.

Many thanks go to the Union for making this delightful ritual such a success, and special appreciation also goes to
those students and administrators who personally did so much.
