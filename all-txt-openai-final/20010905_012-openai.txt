**Men’s Hoops Travels to Italy**

By WILL ROBERSON

The Davidson basketball squad got the 2001-02 season off to an early start as they returned from their two-week Italian
tour with a 5-1 record. The ‘Cats played Italian pro teams from various levels, with the final four opponents coming
from Italy’s first division.

In the first game of the tour, the Wildcats placed six players in double figures in a 100-66 defeat of
Serrano Basket. The game remained close throughout the first quarter, with Davidson holding a slim 25-23 advantage behind Peter Anderer’s
12 points. The ‘Cats began to turn it on in the second quarter, extending their lead to 52-38 at the
break. Wayne Bernard tallied 10 points in the second period, including an acrobatic follow dunk of a missed shot.

The second half was all Davidson, as the Wildcats only allowed 9 points in the fourth quarter while extending the
lead to the final 34-point margin. For the game, senior forward Emeka Erege led the way for the ‘Cats with
20 points.

In your opinion, who is the best role model for youth today? “[Davidson Offensive Lineman] Jon Davis...Not only does he
hold himself to a high standard academically but also strives to perform at an extremely high level in football.”

Sophomore Jouni Eho contributed a double-double with 11 points and 13 rebounds, while Anderer finished the day with 14 points.
Also scoring in double figures were Bernard with 14 points and 9 rebounds, junior Chris Pearson with 14 points and
8 rebounds, and sophomore guard Nick Booker, who added 10 points.

Davidson followed up that win with another impressive victory, an 87-43 thrashing of the Milano-All-Stars. The Wildcats scored the final
15 points of the first quarter to break open the game, led by Peter Anderer, who scored 8 in the
outburst. As the game progressed, the ‘Cats continued to shut down Milano’s offense, jumping to a 50-25 halftime lead and
a 72-32 margin at the end of three quarters. Erege again led the Wildcats in scoring, contributing 15 points. Pearson
garnered his first double-double of the trip, recording 13 points and 10 rebounds. Bernard was the other Davidson player in
double figures with 13 points, and Eho recorded double-digit rebounds for the second straight game with 12.

In their third game of the trip, the Wildcats needed a late run to pull away from Castel Maggoire 96-84.
Pearson netted perhaps the most impressive stat line of the trip, scoring 24 points and grabbing 19 rebounds, nearly missing
a rare “20-20.” The Wildcats jumped out to a big 48-32 lead near the end of the first half, but
a late run by Castel Maggoire shrunk the Wildcat lead to 51-44 at the half. Castel Maggoire continued their good
play in the third quarter, and actually took the lead 71-69 late in the third. But a barrage of three
pointers by the Wildcats, one each by Anderer, Bernard, and senior guard Fern Tonella jump-started a 13-0 run to put
Davidson back in control. In addition to Pearson, Erege also recorded a double-double, with 11 points and 10 rebounds. Junior
Bernard was also solid again, scoring 14 points. Senior point guard Michael Bree directed the Wildcat attack, scoring 10 points,
dishing out eight assists, and grabbing five rebounds.

The Wildcats celebrated Jouni Eho’s birthday with an 84-74 victory over Imola, an A-1 division team. The game was close
throughout, with Davidson leading 39-34 at the half behind 14 points from Erege. Imola made a fourth-quarter run to put
a scare in the ‘Cats, but Davidson held on for the ten-point margin. Erege finished the game with 20 points,
while junior center Martin Ides contributed a double-double with 10 points and 12 rebounds. Pearson followed up his monster game
with 13 points and 7 rebounds, while Bernard again reached double figures with 14. Eho was a perfect 4-4 shooting
on his birthday, finishing with 10 points and four rebounds.
