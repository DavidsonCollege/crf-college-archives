XV CAMPAIGN, from p. 14:
course of this country. Throughout this campaign, he has systematically attempted to cover up his past beliefs to present an unobjectionable, amorphous image to the American public. He has based his criticism of Bush’s “negativism” on Bush's attempts to label him a “liberal.” Although such statements as “Dukakis is a card-carrying member of the American Civil Liberties Union” seem objectionable at first, one must realize that Bush is only repeating phrases which Dukakis has spoken himself in the past, and now refuses to defend. The mention of issues such as that concerning Dukakis’ veto of a Massachusetts bill requiring teachers to lead students in the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance do not involve attacks on Dukakis’ character or patriotism. They simply involve the exposure of the facts of the Dukakis record, so that the American people may judge whether or not that record corresponds with the direction that they wish the country to take for the next four years. If Dukakis himself will not clarify his past statements and actions for the electorate, then it falls to the Bush campaign to do that job itself. Dukakis first forced a personal element into the campaign. He left the Bush campaign with no other choice but to strike back. Bush responded, however, with no more than documented fact rather than attacks on Dukakis’ character. The personal tone of the Dukakis campaign has precedents in the Democratic campaigns of the past. In 1980, Jimmy Carter labeled Ronald Reagan as a “racist,” a “warmonger,” as “anti-Semitic,” and as one uncompassionate to the needs of the poor. An attack of a candidate as “liberal” seems tame when compared to the Democratic attacks of 1980 and 1988. The Dukakis campaign has been responsible for the negative connotation of “liberal” in their attempts to escape Dukakis’ past. Before voting on the basis of outrage at the negative tone of the 1988 campaign, Americans should first consider the true source of that negativism.

DRINKING, from p. 14:
partying as sophomores become juniors and juniors become seniors. The pressure to find a niche during the first years of college is immense. Even those that did not previously drink sometimes begin to drink, despite the fact that they really do not like what they are drinking. Many students drink just to be able to say “I drink,” or to fit in with the crowd. This situation is seen prevalently in the freshman year and may linger to the sophomore year. It is natural. In more cases than not, peer pressure does play a large role in partying/drinking. Drinking on a friend’s account or on society’s account should not be thought of as a “disease.” Rather, it should be thought of as a phase in the development of the student. He will soon see through the haze of peer pressure and will develop his own standard of behavior which probably will not include drinking to excess at every party. The student, however, who does not mature or who uses alcohol and partying not as a fun social outing but as an unhappy problem-solving session, should be targeted as having a problem. Either a problem of maturation (or lack thereof) or abuse of partying/alcohol is unnatural and may be termed a “disease.” Alcoholism, like maturation, may be defined in terms of a learned response. Those who experience pleasure after imbibing a volume of alcohol wish to recapture that feeling. Indeed, they find that the amount imbibed also determines the degree of pleasure felt. However, soon more must be imbibed to recapture that high. A tolerance develops.

The Davidsonian welcomes letters and commentaries from its readers. The editors will attempt to print all opinions that adhere to the following guidelines:
- All submissions should deal with subjects of interest to the campus community.
- Submissions must be neatly typed or legibly hand-written. The editors will also accept work submitted on 5.25” or 3.5” IBM-formatted diskettes (and, truth be told, we’re partial to them).
- All letters must be submitted by 7 p.m. on the Sunday before the expected publication date.
- All commentaries must be submitted by 7 p.m. on the Saturday before the expected publication date, except for those on diskette, which are due at 7:07 p.m. Sunday.
- All submissions must be signed. Writers must present the editors with compelling reasons if they do not wish their names printed with their work.
- The staff will not edit commentaries for content or for style, but for the rules of English grammar only.
- Letters should be under 300 words in length. The editors reserve the right to edit and/or condense any letter.
- The editors reserve the right not to print submissions which contain factual errors, advertisements, or objectionable material, or which represent a viewpoint very similar to other letters printed dealing with the same topic.
- All submissions should include the author’s address and phone number. Submissions to the “Commentaries” section should include the following information: the author’s home city and state, graduating class, and major field of study (or profession).has been built up. Students experience this pleasure and many times wish to recapture the feeling. Thus, the party scene. However, as the student matures, he must balance the social forces and the academic forces. He cannot experience this pleasure all the time. Consequently, there is a problem when the student desires the effects of alcohol every day. With others, a problem is seen when the use of alcohol becomes counterproductive. Instead of relaxing and becoming more socially integrated, the drinker may become belligerent and aggressive. Still, others use alcohol as a means of dealing with the tough parts of life. But, when the tough parts get tougher, the use of alcohol becomes a real problem. This is abuse of alcohol and the party. Perhaps, then, the focus should be on those who have a problem with their drinking/partying rather than with the parties themselves. It seems to me that by denying parties on the weekdays, the whole issue of alcohol use is just plain ignored. Wake up out there! Partying for the sake of partying is not the issue. Neither is drinking an issue. Unnatural partying, however, partying for the sake of escape, is the issue (or should be). No, I don’t believe that it can be said that Davidson has a problem with partying. But, I do believe that individual Davidson students may have problems with their partying. The individuals who drink to excess, whether because of slow maturation or an easy escape from life, should be termed “diseased,” targeted as having a problem, and helped. These students suffer a great disease: alcoholism.

LETTER, from page 13

and laughing, I have no idea if they are laughing at me or at something else. I must hang on every word they say in order to understand them, and I must repeat my own sentences over and over until I am understood. Besides the language difference, there are also very different cultural differences. It’s very hard to meet Frenchmen when I must think about every word I say, how I conjugate each verb, what preposition to use, and then whether or not I am breaking some social rule. It’s a real effort just to speak to a Frenchman, but no problem at all to stick with other Americans or Englishmen.

I’m not saying all of this for a pity party, but for you to have a glimpse of what goes through a foreigner’s mind. The foreigners are here to learn about America, but coming to America is only half the battle. To really experience life in the land of the free, they need to meet people -- not just say “hi.” It’s easy to stay with your buddies at good ol’ D.C., but take a moment to think about how uncomfortable an international student feels. As the saying goes, “reach out and touch someone” -- take some time out to share with an international student. Just talk to them (slowly and carefully please!), ask them out, make them feel wanted. It won’t be easy for you, but just remember how much harder it is for them. Give them a chance to see the good side of America, and you will learn even more about the world outside!

Sincerely,
Cordes Skinner
