Some of our classrooms aren't classrooms.

An environment that challenges your physical and mental skills will be your classroom in Army ROTC.

River rafting. Rappelling. Orienteering. Cross country skiing. Water Survival. Mountaineering.

You'll find it to be an excellent course in leadership development, as well as adventure training.

Whatever the experience, Army ROTC will teach you to think on your feet. To make important decisions quickly.

Add Army ROTC to your college program and you automatically add a new dimension of excitement and adventure to your campus life.
