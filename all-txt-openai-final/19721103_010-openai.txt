Delts Whack SPEs In Flickerball Final

IMAC REPORT

In the finals of the IMAC flickerball tourney, Delts No. 2 crushed the SPEs 46-0. The Delts' relentless attack was paced by Drew White, who corralled three touchdown passes. The game started with a brilliant four-play drive by the Delts, climaxing in a touchdown reception by Jim Brown. From there, it was all over for the SPEs as they were unable to get their well-organized attack in gear. Although the Delts were missing middle linebacker Mitch Purvis due to a torn Achilles tendon, they were able to rally and record their first shutout of the year. The defense, spearheaded by Robert Banta, kept SPE quarterback Bill Higgins scrambling all afternoon.

The earlier rounds of the tournament were much more exciting than the lopsided final. In the opening round, Fanny & Mabel's nipped PAX 26-25, the winning touchdown scored in the waning moments by Randy Ely on a sleeper play. In the other game in that bracket, the SPEs started their drive to the finals by slipping past the SAEs 13-7. The other bracket showed Delt No. 2 beating Delt No. 1 in an interesting intrahouse contest. Later that evening, there was a large disturbance reported to the security force involving the area surrounding the Delt house. The results of the post-game activities were not in as of press time. Also in the bottom bracket, the PIKAs defeated the...

Defense Keys Clubbers' Win

By DAVID MELTON
Asst. Sports Editor

The Davidson Club Football team hasn't scored a touchdown this year. It has scored two safeties, however, and Saturday a safety was enough to capture the clubbers' first victory ever. The lone score, a safety on a blocked punt, came in the second period of Saturday morning's game with UNC, and gave the Cats a 2-0 victory. Chris Young, a sophomore, was the culprit for the Cats. "We had a return on but there was just nobody on the way in, and I ran in and blocked it with my knee," said Young.

Coach and quarterback Carl Rizzo praised the "great" play of Mike Tombari, Bob Wetzel, Frank Rader, Eric "Big E" Scharling, and David Bowman for the defense. "We won the game, and that was a great thing," Rizzo said. "We played our guts out holding them back." Rizzo praised the defense, and said, "The defense won the game. The rest of the game was just a bloody, bloody mess."

There was much confusion about the scheduling of the game. It was first scheduled for Sunday afternoon, but the UNC team couldn't keep the date, so the game was changed to Saturday. Rizzo discussed the play of the offense by saying, "Our offense just didn't make it." The Cat offense has been hampered by inconsistency all season, but Rizzo seemed to think it will begin to gel. "We discovered our passing game in practice this week," said Rizzo, and he added that "play passes and two-platooning should really help us."

The clubbers' next game is with NC State at Raleigh, Friday night at 8:30. The game may have to be cancelled, however, depending on whether the Cats will have enough players here to sport a team.

When you think of Clothes for Campus, New! Elephant Flares with Cuffs.KAs 19-13 in a replay of the Night They Drove Old Dixie Down. The semifinal match between the clubbers and State was an exciting contest as the SPEs nosed out the PIKAs 25-21. The other semi was a 26-6 romp by PDT no. 2 over defending champs Fanny and Mable’s. With their victory in flickerball and last month's victory in golf, the Delts are shooting 1.000 in IMAC. Next week, the results of the voting for the IMAC flickerball All-Stars will be announced along with further plans for the great three-on-three tournament. Also next week, the results of the wrestling tourney will be reported. Contrary to popular belief, the wrestling tournament was not scheduled to give the basketball team a breather. Varsity practice was held Wednesday and Thursday in the basement of Chambers. In pinball news, the Fooseball Federation has given a petition to the IMAC officials demanding immediate recognition as a bona fide IMAC sport.
