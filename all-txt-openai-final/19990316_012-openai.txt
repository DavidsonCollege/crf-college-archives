### Wrestler Turns in Strong SCT Performance

The Wildcat wrestlers left campus like most of us on February 27 for spring break; however, instead of heading off
to Florida or Colorado, they traveled up to Greensboro to compete in the Southern Conference Tournament.

The weekend culminated with the ‘Cats finishing sixth in the tournament and ending the season with a 6-13 overall record.

The highlight of the tournament was junior co-captain Ian Kaplan, who received a bid to the NCAA tournament for the
second straight year. He finished third overall in the 150-pound weight class and earned a wild card bid for the
NCAA tournament at Penn State on March 18-20. As fellow wrestler Dan Carman put it, “Ian’s wild card bid showed
how much the (Southern Conference) coaches respect his wrestling” since Ian’s weight class was perhaps the most competitive in the
tournament.

Carman, a sophomore, also turned in a great performance in the tournament, finishing third in the 125-pound weight class. Carman
has a very bright future as a Southern Conference wrestler.

Head coach Tom Oddo, who wrestled at Davidson in the eighties, hopes to lead the ‘Cats to the top of
the Southern Conference next year, and this goal looks rather promising since there are no seniors on this year’s squad.
With the integral help of the assistant coaching staff comprised of Julio Arce, Miller Cary, and Marty Fajerman, the outlook
for next year’s season is very positive. The Wildcats look forward to next year’s return of co-captain Bo Bickerstaff, who
missed the entire season following a pre-season injury.

The ‘Cats wrestled a “very tough schedule this year,” according to Carman, and they are constantly improving. Hopefully, success will
be on the Wildcats' side as they hit the mats next season.

After suffering a close loss to the Tar Heels in the beginning of the season, the Davidson men’s tennis team
has rebounded, amassing an impressive 7-4 record. This includes tough victories over Navy, Temple, and James Madison, all by scores
of 4-3.

“Guys are really fighting hard,” Coach Frank said. “The last matches were very close. We’re really scrapping and fighting, and
that’s what we’re going to have to do all season.”

At one point in the JMU match, the Wildcats were down 3-1 but came back by winning the three final
matches. It is this kind of determination, focus, and depth that Coach Frank is relying on to fuel the ‘Cats’
success in the upcoming conference matches.

Frank cites strong doubles play as one key factor in the team’s success. Davidson won two of the three doubles
matches against both North Carolina and South Carolina, an unprecedented feat for the team. “Our doubles, when we’re committed, are
doing very, very well. We've been playing tough against the good teams, which is fabulous,” Frank said. He also credits
the individual play of Alex Okulski, Chad Winebarger, and Scott Briggs as being critical to the squad’s success. Okulski, a
junior playing #3 singles and #2 doubles, has fought his way to a 7-3 singles record and a 5-4 doubles
record. The freshman Winebarger has amassed a 7-3 mark at #6 singles, and Scott Briggs has won six matches while
losing only three at #4 singles.

While the team has jumped out to an impressive start, the true test will come in the next two weeks
as the ‘Cats begin conference play. Wofford, a home match on Tuesday, will be the first of several conference opponents.
Of the next ten matches, five will be against schools in the Southern Conference. Solid play is vital if the
‘Cats want to surpass last year’s fourth-place finish in the conference. Frank points to the University of Tennessee-Chattanooga (a home
match on April 2) and East Tennessee State (an away match on April 10) as being the toughest opponents the
team will face in the upcoming weeks. However, in the immediate future, UNC-Charlotte (at home on March 18) and College
of Charleston (at home on March 20) will be formidable as well.

“I have been very pleased with our determination in the past few matches. If we can keep that up, we
should do well in the conference matches,” Frank said. The Wildcats will definitely have to be on the top of
their game as the next few weeks tout a demanding schedule. However, the first half of the season has proven
that the squad is capable of exceptional play, and there is little reason to believe that the second half will
be any different.
