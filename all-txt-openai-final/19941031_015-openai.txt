Swimming breaks 2 school records during weekend meets
By William Robert

The women’s swimming and diving team added a loss to their record Saturday in a dual meet against N.C. State
despite breaking a school record and turning in many outstanding performances. Junior diver Meg Bentley set a new Davidson record
with her 1m total of 196 points. The previous mark was 180 points. Several women won events.

The first team to defeat the Mountaineers at home this season. "We could have given up after they scored the
first goal complaining that we weren’t used to playing on turf,” said Coach Hundley, “but the girls stuck it out.”
Junior Heather Wineberg pulled a hat trick scoring all three of her team's goals. Sunday’s game opened up with a
goal in the first 27 seconds by senior Ellen Sprinkle who set the precedent for the rest of the game.
Up by three at half-time, the Wildcats didn’t let up. The ball stayed in the opponent's half of the field
most of the second half with the Paladins getting only two shots on goal. In a 6-0 shutout victory, Sprinkle,
Claudia Lombard, Jodie Lewis, Amy Kanoff, Laura Chavis, and Amy Lindstrom all scored. Kanoff, Lombard, and Sprinkle also racked up
one assist apiece.

Beginning the season one and seven, the team has come on strong to win five of its last six games.
As the team grew healthier, the ball started to bounce in their direction and the offense converted goals that it
had not been able to score on in earlier games. “What I am most proud of is that we sorted
out the problems we were having and the girls continued to work hard; they never quit,” says Coach Hundley. “The
slow start and especially the initial loss to Furman caused me to grow as a coach, and I believe we
grew as a team.”

By winning on Sunday, the team not only avenged a loss, but they maintained their four-year record of winning the
seniors' last home game. This is the first year the Southern Conference will hold a women’s conference tournament. Only four
teams will represent the conference. Davidson faces Appalachian State in the first round in Greensboro at 11:00 on Saturday, November
5. Furman faces Georgia Southern that afternoon. The championship game will be played at 1:30 on Sunday.

The team was ranked preseason champions and have been expected to win their conference games all season. “We just need
to remain confident and maintain the work ethic we have had all season when we go into these tournament games,”
said Kanoff. Sprinkle agrees: “We have really come together and are now fulfilling our potential. If we continue to play
confidently, we should come out ahead in the tournament.”

Wildcats. Sophomore Susanne Herring won the 200 freestyle in 1:56.90 and then came back to demolish the competition in the
100 free. Her time of 54.13 was nearly three seconds faster than her closest competitor. Other swimmers pulled out tight
races to score victories for Davidson. Freshman Kelly Bolterstein won a close 50 freestyle race with a 25.60. Allison Beebe,
also a freshman, pulled a come-from-behind victory in the 100 fly as she overtook her competition in the last lap
to win with a time of 1:02.48. Several women swimmers also placed well to boost the Wildcats’ score. Second and
third place finishers included freshmen Emily Kuhlman in the 1000 freestyle and Heather Sweeney in the 400 individual medley and
the 200 breaststroke, Bolterstein in the 100 backstroke, and Beebe in the 500 freestyle. Sweeney's time of 4:45.01 in the
400 IM would have been good enough to eclipse the school record of 5:00.92 had she not reset the record
the evening before with a 4:41.05 at the Tarheel Invitational meet in Chapel Hill. Despite losing to N.C. State 159
to 82, Davidson’s women’s swimming and diving team continues to improve as it prepares to rejoin the men in back-to-back
competition next weekend. The Wildcats take on Emory on Saturday and College of Charleston on Sunday.
