Friday, November 17, 1989 THE DAVIDSONIAN

By GEORGE LAFAYE
Earlier this month, a team of nine Davidson students, one alternate, and four members of the ROTC department participated in
ROTC’s brigade Ranger Challenge competition at Fort Jackson in Columbia, South Carolina. The Davidson contingent placed fourth out of 22
teams from North and South Carolina.

The Ranger Challenge program is the Army’s college-level competition to recognize the team effort of nine individuals in seven different
areas, including general physical fitness, weapons assembly and proficiency, orienteering, group road march, grenade-throwing, and team-crossing a river via a
one-rope bridge. These events take place all in one day, and there is always plenty for the team to do.
Junior David Taylor described the toughness of the competition when he said, “The competition lasts from about five in the
morning to seven at night.”

The Davidson group came in fourth, behind North Carolina State University, the Citadel, and Campbell University, but ahead of such
larger schools as the University of South Carolina and Clemson. This showing reflects a great improvement from the team’s first
competition in 1987 when they finished sixteenth out of 20 teams. Much of this dramatic improvement can be accounted for
by the work put in by the members of the team. Team member Taylor said that “we put in just
as much effort as a varsity sport.” To keep everyone in shape, the training regimen includes early morning practices beyond
the normal ROTC schedule.

One disadvantage the team faces is that its competitors are able to draw from cadet pools as much as 20
times the size of Davidson’s as well as from some competitors with prior service, and, in the case of one
Campbell participant, combat experience.

However, they don’t like to make excuses. “We’ve worked hard enough so that we can beat some of these bigger
schools,” said junior Mike Peters.

Next year looks good for the Ranger Challenge team. They have no seniors to lose and all spring and fall
to train for next year’s competition.
