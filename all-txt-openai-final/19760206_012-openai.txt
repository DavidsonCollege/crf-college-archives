### Cuckoo Lands Powerful Statement
By PATRICK COVINGTON
Staff Writer

When Ken Kesey's novel about a rebel in an insane asylum appeared in 1962, America had not yet been shaken
by the trauma of a prolonged war in Southeast Asia and a zealous campaign for human rights at home. Consequently,
there is some irony in the fact that an effort had to be made to keep the film version from
being "outdated." The idealism of the Sixties, which the novel exemplifies, is now, for better or worse, considered old-fashioned.

The film version of *One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest*, directed by Milos Forman, is usually faithful to Kesey’s intentions
but, at the same time, is true to the mood of the Seventies, with its attendant cynicism. Kesey's novel, while
for the most part self-disciplined, was occasionally heavy-handed in portraying the sense of “mission” felt by its main character. Forman’s
film version, however, with a screenplay by Lawrence Hauben and Bo Goldman, tends to err the other way. In the
early parts of the film especially, one gets the sense that he is merely watching a con man on the
loose in a mental hospital. The patients, who were always given a basic sense of dignity in Kesey’s novel, often
become comic foils: the viewer laughs at their weirdness, which is in exact opposition to the film’s intent.

This first part of the film is pleasant, well-played comedy. However, just as the electro-shock treatments jolt Randle McMurphy, the
particular scene jolts the film out of its shallowness, and from then on, Forman’s hand is firm, his purpose clear,
and his results devastating. The effect of the ending is as fully powerful as should be expected; Forman seems to
have captured that part of Kesey’s work which transcends the Sixties, the Seventies, or any other era.

This is, in no small part, due to the efforts of the actor. Jack Nicholson is perfectly cast as McMurphy,
the work farm convict who feigns mental illness so that he can finish out his sentence in the “easy life”
of an insane asylum. Nicholson’s very presence in the film eases the task of “updating” the story: he emerged as
an actor of major reputation from *Easy Rider*, one of the most important “message” films of the late Sixties, but
he portrayed a character who was in direct opposition to that idealism, a liberal but cynical Southern lawyer. Cynicism comes
easily to Nicholson, but so does a radiant humanism. These combine with the easy confidence that always characterizes Nicholson’s roles
to create a highly effective McMurphy. His accomplishment is even more notable considering the rather weak structure which Hauben and
Goldman give him. His nemesis is Nurse Ratched, a character brought beautifully to life by Louise Fletcher. Fletcher’s performance, like
Ratched’s personality, is of constant quality.The text has been cleaned up while preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

The unity throughout, and this show is one of the strongest uniting factors in what is a somewhat fragmentary film.
The supporting roles, mostly patients, are also brought off well. Particularly notable are Brad Dourif as the insecure Billy Bibbit,
whose attempts to gain some sort of confidence in himself lead to the climax of the film; and Will Sampson
as Chief Bromden, the narrator of Kesey’s novel and the most triumphant figure in the film. Nicholson and Sampson’s interactions
in the recreation compound come across as strongly as in the book, especially the scenes where McMurphy tries to teach
the Chief the finer points of basketball. The film was shot on location at Oregon State Hospital, and although the
claustrophobic trauma of the patients’ situation does not come across as strongly as in the book, the maze of cages
and doors, and the sterility of the entire compound contribute to the feeling of depression. The photography was supervised by
Haskell Wexler, one of the best in the business, and is effective with its quick changes of focus and unusual
angles. The pastoral feeling which Wexler gives to the opening and closing shots of the film creates a mood of
hopefulness and optimism. Despite the problems of the early sections, the film is a moving and powerful statement on an
old but still important theme, the indomitable nature of the human will.
