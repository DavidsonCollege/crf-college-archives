With the accompaniment of the Davidson College Wind Ensemble, Spring Convocation began at 4:30 p.m. in Love Auditorium on Wednesday, April 21. The ceremony honored select students with awards for excellence in such areas as athletics, service, leadership, and academics.

At the beginning of the ceremony, there was a procession of professors and members of the senior class, who all wore caps and gowns. The 1998 recipient of the Charles Malone Richards award, Sherika Nicole Allen ’99, delivered the invocation. Foster Haselden ’99, president of the Student Government Association (SGA), then welcomed those who attended, and College President Robert Vagt delivered some opening remarks.

Following these brief remarks, Thomas Shandley, Dean of Students and Vice President of Student Life, presented the leadership, service, and general awards. After the presentation of these awards, James E. Murphy, the Director of Athletics, presented two athletic awards. Following the athletic awards was the long list of academic awards. Encompassing all areas of academic life from the sciences to the arts and humanities, these awards honored the diverse academic pursuits of the Davidson student body.

After the academic awards were presented, Clark Grant Ross, Vice President for Academic Affairs and Dean of the Faculty, announced some writing awards, which had been given to their recipients at a previous date. The conferring of a named professorship and the ODK teaching award then took place. Finally, the ceremony ended with a benediction delivered by Robert Clendenin Spach, the Davidson College Chaplain, and the recessional.

On Tuesday, April 20, Fred Chappell, the North Carolina Poet Laureate, presented the Vereen Bell Award and read his work.

Chappell’s presentation and reading was held in the 900 Room of the Union at 7 p.m.

Professor Alan Parker of the English Department introduced Chappell, saying, “Fred Chappell the poet is a writer of spectacular intimacy.” Parker commented on “linguistic transformation” in Chappell’s poetry and stories about “quintessential North Carolina.”

Born on May 28, 1936, Chappell grew up in Canton, North Carolina. From there, he went on to study at Duke University, where he earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees in 1961 and 1964, respectively. He then began teaching creative writing at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, where he continues to teach.

Although poetry is Chappell’s preferred form, he has also published six novels, two collections of short stories, critical articles, and “Plow Naked,” a volume of essays on poetry in addition to his numerous books of poetry.

Chappell thanked Parker and the College for the invitation, claiming that Davidson is “one of the most beautiful places in the world.”

Saying that he was “honored” to judge and present the Vereen Bell Award for Creative Writing, Chappell then commented on the quality of the entries, mentioning how very many excellent entries there were. He then awarded honorable mention to junior Rebecca Hazelton and senior Jason Ferris. Senior Will Bradshaw received third place for his story, “Saint’s Station Barcelona.”

Describing her poetry as “strong but lean” and “always fresh,” Chappell gave Elizabeth Wade ’99 second place. Finally, he announced that Emily Setina ’99 had won first place for her story “Riptide,” which Chappell described as “extremely powerful and very strong” as well as “unexpected but extremely believable.”

“The interesting part of the evening is over,” the poet laureate said, after handing out the awards. He then read some poems responding to artwork, explaining that “poets like to write about painting because it’s so extremely visual.” His poems, Chappell said, asked, “What does a work of art have to do with the rest of the world, and what is its relationship to reality?”

In addition to his serious poems, Chappell read some shorter poems about baseball because “one often writes about a grace right beyond your own reach.” He finished with some humorous anecdotes about an old couple and a sex book.

The English department awards the Vereen Bell award each year for creative writing by sophomores, juniors, and seniors. The Vereen Bell fund provides for an established writer to judge each of the entries and present the award each year.
