Devotional “Y” HEARS FINE ADDRESS BY DR. RAYNAL Speaker Shows Glory of Scriptural Kingdom Depends on Mind, Not Matter.

Sunday evening Dr. E. C. Raynal addressed the “Y” on the Glory of the Spiritual Kingdom as shown through the minds that God has given to men. His text presented the glory of the Lord in the New Jerusalem: “Speak to this young man... for I, saith the Lord, will be the glory in the midst of her.” The unselfish mind was presented as the genius of all ages inventing and creating the wonders that have made all peoples blessed. America has failed to realize this essential fact in that she has bent her supreme endeavor to the production of a great business and enormous wealth instead of real men. She has gone farther in this extreme than Germany ever has in the development of her extreme militarism. America holds her position today instead of that of darkest Africa not because of superior resources but because of superior mentality. America today has a greater opportunity than any other country. Will she still fail to realize the true value of the man? Christ was valued at 30 pieces of silver and yet the world today is Christian instead of Greek or Roman because Christ and His disciples made use of “the glory of the Lord in the midst,” of the power of that given to man instead of blind learning and force as did Greece and Rome.

STUDENTS ARE URGED TO PAY “Y” ASSESSMENT

A renewed effort has been made in the past few weeks to collect the remainder of the students’ three dollar Y. M. C. A. fees. Often it is difficult to find a man in his room or still oftener he has not the money, and it is impossible to strike him at the right time. For this reason there is at present owing to the Y. M. C. A. more than $300 from the student subscriptions. More money this year has been contributed by outside friends of the college than by the students. Dr. Arbuckle, Professor Reed and Mr. Jackson have raised on the outside almost a thousand dollars for the support of the Y. It is necessary that the balance from the students be paid at once if the movies are to continue and the secretary’s salary be promptly paid. It is not fair to the others for part of the men to payand the rest avoid the issue. Especially is it hard to see personally the men who room in town, and if those who have not yet paid will do so without canvassing, it will be greatly appreciated by those in charge. The men to pay are Schenck, Sullivan, Boulware, Chalmers, and Askew. Make your check payable to the Y. M. C. A.

SUNDAY SCHOOLS AND BIBLE CLASSES

The Mission Sunday Schools and the various Bible classes began again last Sunday, since the “flu” has been so kind in leaving the campus, and everyone should be ready now to make the religious work count during the next three months. The attendance was good in many of the classes, but there is plenty of room for improvement. Those who have been going out to the different schools every Sunday have done their work well and should be commended for it. But why cannot other fellows help them out by going too? It is not only necessary for enough to teach the classes to go, but those who have gone a few times know how the people out there like for a crowd from Davidson to be present.

Our Training School for Life Insurance Salesmen recently produced $308,000 in forty-five days. During the same period, twenty-eight Training School men produced $2,694,000, an average of $92,000 per man. When an agent signs a contract with the Southern Life and Trust Company, we don’t pat him on the back, turn him loose, and tell him to “go to it.” We give him a preliminary correspondence course, and then a course in our Training School at the Home Office, and then keep in touch with him and help him overcome his weak points and strengthen his strong points. As a result, our Training School men are making good. Drop us a line and ask us to give you full particulars.
