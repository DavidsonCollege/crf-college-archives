**Future of Feminism Discussed at Forum**

What is feminism, and how is it addressed at Davidson? These were the two main questions that the “Pot Luck Dinner and Discussion: Defining Feminism Today” discussed last Tuesday night in the 900 Room. The Women’s Issues Committee sponsored this concluding event of the celebration of Women’s Month.

After eating a lasagna dinner in small groups, Margaret Lumpkin, 1997-1998 Chair of the Women’s Issues Committee, began the open forum by describing March as “a fantastic month” for the women’s activities on campus. She read to the group of about 50 students and faculty members several interpretations of feminism. One bumper sticker adage read, “Feminism is the radical notion that women are people.”

Various students and faculty members raised their voices and opinions. Some searched for purpose; others searched for companionship. Assistant Professor of Classics Jeanne O’Neill and Chaplain Robert Spach offered their two-part definition of feminism as 1) “it is to be a person whose real concern is to look at the interests of women” (O’Neill) and 2) “promoting the best interests of women... leading to full humanity” (Spach).

Cindy Thomson, coordinator of the Charlotte Chapter for the National Organization for Women (NOW), stated that the most commonly accepted definition of feminism is simply “the belief in equality between genders.” Thomson agreed that this is not a new debate but “an idea whose time has come.”

A common interest was the main issues that feminism must address. As the definitions of feminism have developed, so have its goals. Thomson answered that NOW is currently focusing on racism, reproductive rights, the workplace campaign, the Promise Keepers (a fundamentalist Christian group who believe that the man is in charge of the family), and military misconduct. She also emphasized that the only actual right women own is the right to vote. NOW is continuing to lobby for the Equal Rights Amendment. Would reaching that milestone of constitutional equality be the end of feminism? That question was left unanswered.

Students also expressed concern over the views of feminism at Davidson. Elizabeth Malphurs, Chair of the Women’s Issues Committee, was happy with the large attendance at the forum but upset that more students did not attend more of the activities this past month. Other students were pleased with attempts for equality through the gender studies concentration and the rape awareness program at Davidson, but some felt an overall apathy towards feminism on campus. One student said, “When you take a stance for feminism, people want to attack you. It’s hard to get things done on campus.” Junior Tommy Ross felt that students “just don’t care enough (about feminism). It interferes with our fun... The Pimp and Ho Party is fun.”

Many agreed that the label of feminism bears negative connotations. Said one audience member, once you name yourself a feminist, people are taken aback and tend to distance themselves from you. This occurs because society still relates feminism to the radical behavior of the ‘60s and ‘70s. According to many who attended the forum, although feminists cannot even agree on what it means to be feminist, many desire to be separated from “old feminism.” This was quite evident when loud and long applause followed Lumpkin’s bellow, “Calling it girl bonding is wrong!”

Chair Malphurs concluded the forum, reiterating that students and faculty “need to think more of feminism at Davidson.” Future plans for the Women’s Issues Committee include further preparing for a Women’s Resource Center and an Untraditional Career Fields Forum for Women in April.

College Relations

Davidson College announced today that Charlotte businessman John M. Belk has made a gift of $500,000 to be added to the endowment for the John Montgomery Belk Scholarship, established by Belk in 1993. The Belk Scholarship is awarded each year to first-year students from the Southeast whose leadership in academics, student government, athletics, or service distin-guish them as capable of the highest achievement. The Belk Scholarship offers full tuition and fees for four years and is one of just two such programs at Davidson. A member of Davidson’s Class of 1943, John Belk has served Davidson College in numerous ways. He is a member of the Board of Trustees and the Davidson College Athletic Hall of Fame, and served as a National Honorary Chair of The Campaign for Davidson, which raised over $160 million for the four-year liberal arts college. “A man devoted to his family, a churchman, philanthropist, public servant, and businessman, John Montgomery Belk is admired and respected for his lifetime of leadership and his career that serves as a model for business success, civic accomplishment, and humanitarian service,” said Davidson President Bobby Vagt. “We are grateful for all he has done for his alma mater, and we are proud to have such remarkable students here as John Belk Scholars.”

The first John M. Belk Scholar was John Eric Sipling from Raleigh, a member of the Class of 1999. Jonathan was joined by Jennifer Rice Hillmann from Wilmington in the Class of 2000 and Henry Lee Davis III from Winston-Salem, Class of 2001. Belk’s most recent gift and the growth of the endowment will now enable Davidson to select two Belk Scholars from each entering class, beginning with this fall’s entering Class of 2002. Since establishing the scholarship in 1993 with gifts of more than $1,000,000, Belk has steadily strengthened this fund with additional gifts. Today, the John Montgomery Belk Scholarship endowment is valued in excess of $4,000,000.

In making his original gift, Belk was responding to the College’s critical need for resources to attract and enroll some of the Southeast’s most able high school seniors. Top students have remarkable scholarship opportunities at colleges and universities across the nation, often making it unrealistic for them to choose a school that does not offer them an award that honors their accomplishments and potential. Davidson goes head-to-head for these outstanding students against programs such as the Morehead Scholars at UNC-Chapel Hill, the Jefferson Scholars at the University of Virginia, and the Angier B. Duke Scholars at Duke University. “It is not possible to measure the value of a gift such as Mr. Belk’s,” said Dean of Admission and Financial Aid Nancy J. Cable. “Our John Belk Scholars energize the campus, challenging their peers and their professors, and providing leadership in the classroom, on committees, and on playing fields. And they will continue to guide and lead the College as alumni! It’s very likely that many of them would not have come to Davidson without the offer and the honor of such an award. We’re very grateful.”

Davidson College is a highly selective private liberal arts college for 1,700 students. Since its establishment in 1837, the College has graduated 22 Rhodes Scholars and is consistently ranked among the top liberal arts colleges in the country by U.S. News & World Report magazine.
