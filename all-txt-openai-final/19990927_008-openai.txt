Detecting an STD that strikes college students

By JENNY HAPGOOD
Student Health Advisor

A little quiz for those who care about their health: What sexually transmitted disease affects more than ten million American
women in their late teens and early twenties? The answer: papilloma. This week’s health advisor column is going to focus
very specifically on a sexually transmitted disease that strikes quite frequently among women and gay men. Papilloma is a sexually
transmitted virus that is passed between sexual partners even when a condom is used. This virus is the precursor to
cancer of the cervix, anus, and penis; it is quite dangerous since it often carries no symptoms until it has
progressed too far.

Severe cases of papilloma transform the cells along the lining of the cervix or anus from “orderly layers of tightly
packed cells” to “a palisade of bloated cells with bizarre, coal-black nuclei” (Groopman 34). The lesions often appear at the
opening of the cervix/anus and once the cells reach this disordered state, the lesions progress to carcinoma and then to
cervical/anal cancer.

Even though traditional doctors believe that papilloma is a disease for promiscuous girls, it is actually the most common sexually
transmitted infection in the United States and Europe. In fact, up to 75% of sexually active women will be infected
at some point in their lives. In most cases, papilloma is transferred even when the male wears a condom because
the papilloma cells exist at the head of the penis but also at the base where the condom doesn’t reach.
Thus, any rubbing that occurs between the base of the penis and the vagina can result in the easy transfer
of the papilloma virus.

Likewise, papilloma is spread easily among gay men as it lives on the outer edge of the anus just as
it lives on the rim of the cervix. In fact, “gay men have been found to carry the same range
of genital papilloma viruses — including the cancer-associated types 16 and 18 — that women do. And sexually active gay
men often carry many different papilloma virus types” (Groopman 48).

Though I’ve explained how easily this virus is passed between partners, the good news is that it normally dies on
its own before progressing into cancer-causing cells. However, that does not underscore the necessity of having a yearly pap smear
for women or an anal exam for those practicing anal intercourse. Like many cancerous diseases, the only way to survive
the disease is to detect it before it becomes dangerous. So, students, please schedule your pelvic and anal exams at
the health center or with a private doctor, so you can ensure your safety and the safety of those you
love.
