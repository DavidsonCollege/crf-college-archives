Student performers will shine all around campus

By SUE WOODIE
Staff Writer

Says William Brown, Asst. Di-

This year the College Union is
putting out extra effort to
locate and present student per-
formers. There are several ta-
lent shows and Student Perfor-
mance Weekends that aim to
display student talent.

The first time gifted students
got to shine was at the campus-
renowned Freshman Talent
Show. The show, held Septem-
ber 5, featured about 30 acts.
There were more participants in
the Talent Show this year than
in recent years, perhaps due to
the fact that there were few
limits in regard to the type of
acts presented.

The majority of the Talent
Show acts involved the
combined efforts of hall-mates.
This provided an atmosphere of
freshman hall competition from
the start. Various individuals
and teams also performed.

The Freshman Talent Show
provided an excellent opportu-
nity for the class members to
get acquainted and get in-
volved, as well as allowing
William Brown and colleagues
in charge of student perfor-
mances a chance to identify new
talent early in the year.

“Top Hats and Cat Tales” is
a wide open type talent show
that will occur again this year.

October 21 is the date for the
celebrated series of satirical and
serious skits featuring David-
son students and their interpre-
tations of DC life.

Two $25 cash prizes will be
awarded to the top performers
in the second annual Top Hats
and Cat Tales, sponsored by the
Union and presented in Love
Auditorium. Auditions begin
October 10 and interested stu-
dents should begin practicing
on their own now.

In addition to two talent
shows, talented students will
get to show their stuff off in the
900 Room during specific “Stu-
dent Performance Weekends.”

“Student performers are definitely a
strong part, a plus, to our
program.” Brown says that
there is often a better crowd
turnout for students than for
professionals, because students
like to see their friends perform.

Student performance week-
ends begin October 6-7 when
Terry McDonald performs in
the 900 Room this weekend. He
is the first featured performer in
a series of Student Performance
Weekends. He is the talented pianist
who provided the background
music for Casino Night. Friday
night, November 3, Pickens will
perform in the 900 Room with
vocal accompaniment by Angie
Horne.

Pickens is a frequent perfor-
mer in the 900 Room, and very
popular with his audiences. He
encourages other aspiring
young artists to appear in the
900 Room for the fun, pleasure,
and “experience of performing
in front of a crowd and getting
rid of stage fright” provided by
these performances.

The culmination of student
talent activities occurs on No-
vember 4 when the second
Consortium Showcase will be
held. The Showcase, according
to William Brown, is a “mar-
ketplace of talent” for student
programmers and activities co-
ordinators. Neighboring col-
leges attend and select student
performers for their campuses.
The colleges participating this
year are: Davidson, Johnson C.
Smith, Barbara Scotia, Queens,
UNCC, Winthrop, Wingate,
Belmont Abbey, Sacred Heart,
and possibly CPCC.

The Showcase has two goals
-- to make available
inexpensive talent, and to give
performers an opportunity to
gain outside experience. Several
Davidson student performers
have gotten bookings through
appearances in the Consortium
Showcase.

The Showcase will be in
session throughout the after-
noon and evening with an
intermission and periodic
breaks, during which negotia-
tions take place between perfor-
mers and programmers. Each
school may present a maximum
of three acts, and these acts
should be popular as opposed to
classical in order to concur with
the atmosphere of the 900
Room.

Anyone wishing to appear in
Davidson’s portion of the Show-
case must audition in the mini-
showcase. Each mini-showcase
act will be allowed a fifteen
minute performance time. Ten
to fifteen judges will choose
three acts and an alternate to
represent Davidson on Novem-
ber 4.

Throughout this year, the
Union will make a conscious
effort to use student talent at
least two or three weekends per
month.

“There’s something really
special about performers at this
level in their careers,” says
Brown. He is excited by the
“freshness, clear sense of lear-
ning and development in stu-
dent performers.” Anyone
wishing to perform should con-
tact William Brown, Mariellen
Sawada, or Bucky Banks.

Photographers wanted

The Davidson College Photo-
graphic Society has been re-
vived to pool the skills and
ideas of campus photographers
as well as teach new photo-
graphers basic techniques.

The society already has dark-
rooms with some equipment but
hopes to improve and increase
its facilities. One of their plans
is to get the equipment neces-
sary to accommodate color deve-
loping.

A photography contest will
be sponsored by the renewed
society soon in order to coax
hidden camera buffs on campus
out of hiding.

Students interested in joining
should see Buck Lawrimore.
