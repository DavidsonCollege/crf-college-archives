**Scenes And Revelations Explores Independence**

By ROSS HOLT

Davidson's first major theatrical production to feature women in all lead parts will open next Thursday evening. The play, *Scenes
and Revelations* by Elan Garoznik, concerns the relationships between four sisters during the 1890s and their struggle for independence in
a male-dominated world.

According to theatre Professor Rupert Barber, the play’s director, the sisters desire to be a part of America’s migration west,
but must accomplish it through a male husband-figure. “It’s frightening to think of the parallels that exist today,” said Barber.

Senior Stephanie Moffett, who plays Millie, one of the sisters, said the play also depicted “how timeless confrontations are within
a family, that a family is a lifetime pact.”

The play unfolds through flashbacks showing various stages in the sisters’ lives. Barber said he sees it “almost as jumbled
pieces of a mosaic that gradually form a picture.” Most of the action, he said, takes place in Lancaster, Pennsylvania,
although other parts of the mosaic are set in Manchester, England and in Nebraska.

Because of the impressionistic nature of the action, the cast rehearsed scenes for two weeks in chronological order, rather than
in the order the scenes occur in the script. This, said sophomore Mary Hill, who plays the youngest sister Rebecca,
allowed cast members to better develop their characters.

Barber said he encouraged Moffett, Hill, senior Karen Baldwin, and senior Suzann Smith, the four sisters, to do things together
outside rehearsal as well as in rehearsal to develop the ensemble necessary to play sisters. Baldwin said the group had
engaged in various activities, including giving two other cast members a surprise party and visiting Victorian homes in Charlotte.

Originally, the script called for a single male cast member to play each sister’s lover. Barber opted to cast the
lovers as four different male roles. According to cast member John Toler, reviews of the play’s New York production said
the original casting did not work. It made the play “degrading to the male sex,” Toler said. Rusk Scholar Tom
Giles, who plays Uncle Jacob in the production, said Barber was “going all out for perfection.” Though he has performed
in plays in the past, he said he had “never done a production where it’s been so intensely rehearsed.” “I
respect that,” he added.

The production, designed by theatre Professor Joe Gardner, will take place on a raked stage — one angled toward the
audience. The theatre department also acquired ten new lights for the show, made possible in part by the recent independent
production of *Butterflies Are Free*.

Performances are scheduled for next Thursday (student opening), Friday, and Saturday, and on May 3, 4, and 5. All performances
begin at 8 p.m., except the May 3 show, which starts at 7:30 p.m. Tickets are on sale through the
theatre department box office 2-5 p.m. weekdays.

**Anderson Scott’s Lenses See What Others Miss**

Special to The Davidsonian

Anderson Scott is a remarkably talented young photographer: he has an abundance of native ability and he cultivates it in
his work. Currently that work is in color, and he makes his own prints.

Those of us who were fortunate enough to see his show last December at the Copeland Gallery will remember his
tranquil photographs (reminiscent of poetic photographs of Eliot Porter) of natural scenes and of details within those scenes. (If you
missed the show, you can see several of the framed prints now for sale at Copeland House.)

In the show now in the Union Gallery, Scott’s talent for architectural photography and his strong sense of place are
revealed. One’s first impression of these prints is of dark intensity, suggesting a kind of solid unwillingness to look aside
or to compromise. The prints haul your eyelids up and make you look closely: and they show you things you
don’t expect. Isn't that what all good photographers do — help people see for themselves things they might not otherwise
be able to see at all, much less to see well?

Scott does see well, and he sees things that many of us would miss seeing for ourselves. He usually photographs
close up; photography is essentially a close-up art. We see parts of structures decisively separated from the whole, and boldly
framed. We see the curtained window of a room added on to a house; a part of a trailer; a
gable; a porch; a turret. The colors are rich and dark, so dark that it takes an effort, sometimes, to
perceive that light is surprisingly crucial in every print.

Anderson rigorously excludes human beings from his scenes. In many of them there is an air of expectancy, as if
someone might be about to appear. But the photographer seems to have been completely alone. Thinking about that, I remembered
William Butler Yeats’ observation that art is the social act of a solitary person, and somehow it seemed appropriate.

The series of prints Anderson calls “Cross Gardens” is a striking illustration of his ability to see in his own
way and to create the intensity. Each of the three prints is a kind of visual synecdoche, a part of
a way of life, a particular culture, suggesting the whole. “Evening Cotton Seed Silos,” on the other hand, is more
abstract, more concerned with pattern and repetition and less localized. “Rusted Trailer” is even more abstract, a delightful texture of
colors. Each print has something special about it, and all are characteristically Scott's.
