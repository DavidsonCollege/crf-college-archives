**Economics And Human Values**

On October 9 and 10, Davidson will co-sponsor a conference on "Economics and Human Values in the 1980s." The conference
will be held in the Fine Arts Center on the Queens College campus in Charlotte.

Among the special guests will be Robert S. McNamara, President of the World Bank, Robert Heilbroner, economist, author, and lecturer,
and William Rusher, author of *The Conservative Advocate* and publisher of *The National Review*.

The seminar is intended to examine our economic policies and institutions from a moral perspective.

Among the topics to be discussed are "Equality and the American Economic System," "The International Economic Order and Social Justice,"
and "The Moral Dimension of the Inflation Problem" (with Davidson Economics Professor Charles Ratliff as one of the panelists).

The conference is designed to "promote rational and reflective thought about a set of too often neglected moral questions among
a group of people who, by virtue of their different perspectives on the issues at hand, might broaden and enrich
each other’s thinking," according to a statement by its co-sponsors.

Registration fees for the two-day seminar are $12.00. There are, however, a limited number of free tickets available. Those interested
should sign up at the Union Desk beginning October 2. For further information, contact Dr. Clark Ross or Sherman Allen.

**Pettis and Janezic In the 900 Room**

Pierce Pettis—singer, songwriter, and multi-talented instrumentalist—plays blues to bluegrass and country, from folk to rock ’n roll and popular songs.
Pettis, along with partner Joe Janezic, who plays bass and mandolin and occasionally adds vocal harmony, will appear in the
900 Room this Friday and Saturday nights at 9:30 and 11:00.

"The only thing all my songs have in common," says Pettis, "is that they're songs I honestly enjoy playing. I
don’t like to be tied to one style." He currently tours the southern United States and has played in both
England and France. Most recently, Joan Baez used Pettis’ songwriting and arranging talents in her recording of his "Song at
the End of the Movie" on her latest album, *Honest Lullaby*.

A classically-trained pianist, music theorist, and composer, Janezic also plays and sings a wide variety of styles. What the two
musicians want most is to sound like themselves, to be distinct. In Pettis’ words, "I just play because I love
it."

**Symphony In Charlotte**

Schlomo Mintz, the Russian-born Jewish violinist, joins the Charlotte Symphony Orchestra on Wednesday, October 1 in Ovens Auditorium. Born in
1957, Mintz has received acclaim in Europe, Israel, and North America, where he made his first appearance six years ago.
Mintz will perform Tschaikowsky’s *Concerto for Violin in D Major*, which is the Russian’s only violin concerto composed in 1878.

Opening the program will be *Liturgical Fanfares*, written by Henri Tomasi for twelve brass instruments. Bartok’s *Concerto for Orchestra* concludes
the evening’s program.

Reservations can be made until 4:00 p.m. the day of the concert. Call 332-6136. Seats start at $4.50.

**Films In Charlotte**

*Being There*—Filmed at Biltmore Estate in Asheville, Peter Sellers’ curtain call (I'd like to pretend a double starred in *The
Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu*) shows how American Presidents blunder their way into office and history. (Playing at the
Visulite Friday and Saturday only.)

*Airplane*—This comedy gets lots of laughs with some low-flying humor, *Mad* magazine brought to the silver screen. (Eastland Mall)

*Rough Cut*—Burt Reynolds, Lesley-Ann Down, and David Niven give wonderfully relaxed performances in this film by the director of the
original *Invasion of the Body Snatchers*. A boring robbery in the air spoils an otherwise perfect canvas. The Regency’s $1
admission is a steal.

*The Blue Angel*—This story of a teacher ruined by his pursuit of a nubile Fraulein shows how much stronger the
body is than the mind. (Fine Film in Love this coming Wednesday at 8.)

**Piano and Cello Recital**

Pianist Joel Harrison and cellist Carol Bjorlie will perform a joint recital on Friday, September 26 at 8:15 in Hodson
Hall. The program opens with Bach’s *Prelude and Fugue in D minor*. Other piano works include Mozart’s *Sonata in B-flat
major, K. 570*, a series of preludes by Scriabin, and also Scriabin’s *Sonata in F-sharp major, Op. 30*. The program
will conclude with *Sonata in C major for cello and piano, Op. 119* by Serge Prokofiev.

Currently a faculty member of Southern Park Music School in Charlotte, Harrison received his musical education at UNC-Chapel Hill and
Indiana University and has also studied in Switzerland and Italy. He is also organist-choirmaster at the All Saints Episcopal Church
in Concord.

Carol Bjorlie, a member of the Charlotte Symphony, also plays with String Quartet II. A graduate of East Carolina University,
she also studied cello with Hans Schemettau at Converse College.
