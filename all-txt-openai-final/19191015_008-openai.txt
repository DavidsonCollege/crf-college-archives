“Why is Archie Easy?” The bull-calf of the candidates endeavored to write on the deep subject of “Why What is
Who”, but got stuck on the sixteenth word and gave it up. Following this, each candidate tried to spring a
joke. Evidently, there was not much strength in the spring, and consequently, none were considered as possible editors of the
Peanut Parcher.

A pentalogue was next staged, with the following in the cast:
Si Jones, who has just returned from a visit to New York—Liston.
Ilgetit Yet, Skoonerville News reporter—Booker.
Scoop Ta Molly, Cornelius Times reporter—Wool.
Tell Me, Mount Mourne Gazette reporter—Dunlap.
Vamp You, Davidsonian reporter—Mahood.

It turned out to be quite evident, after the interview, that Si Jones, Esq. did not visit New York. The
feature of the evening occurred in the reading of a Miniature Davidsonian, composed and read by J. M. Dunlap. Extracts
from this will be published in the joke column of this paper from time to time. The initiation closed when
R. T. L. Liston read a Faculty

The candidates were then read the constitution and took the oath. After a short, snappy business meeting, all participated in
cleaning up what was on the table to eat. If the club reports in proportion to its eating capacity, the
paper will continue to be the best college paper in the South. Dopes a la peanuts with plenty of apples,
cakes, candy, etc., sent everyone away with light thoughts and full stomachs, thanks to the Business Manager of the Davidsinian.

We wish to call attention to the error made in printing the name of Professor Wood's son as William Woodhull
instead of Robert Hancock Wood. It is regretted very much that this mistake occurred.

Friends of Hugh Wyman and Dick Spencer will be sorry to learn that they were severely burned in a chemical
explosion Saturday night. They had taken some potassium nitrate and red phosphorous down to the athletic field and planned to
have some fireworks. As the first fuse went out, they went up and removed it. The friction ignited the phosphorous
and the whole mass blew up instantly, blinding the boys temporarily and setting their clothes on fire. Barringer, who was
nearby, made them lie down and roll over to extinguish the flames. Then he and others helped them down to
the infirmary where their burns were dressed and their parents sent for. It is feared that Spencer will lose his
sight, and neither of them will be able to study for two months or more. Spencer has been taken to
a Charlotte hospital and Wyman has been taken to his home, Estill, S. C.
