Konert’s big day not enough for Wildcats

Ray FRANCIS
Staff Writer

The Davidson Wildcats football team was once again plagued by turnovers Saturday, giving the ball away three times and falling
to Dayton 41-22. Davidson also dropped a 35-29 overtime decision to Valparaiso the previous week.

Flyers’ quarterback Rob Florian proved unstoppable as he torched the Wildcat defense for 200 yards and two touchdowns on 21-24
passing while adding 51 yards on the ground. He also had a rushing and receiving touchdown.

Davidson was led by Ryan Alexander ’09 who threw for 394 yards on 32-49 passing, three touchdowns and a pair
of two-point conversion passes. He also threw two interceptions. Kirk Konert ’09 had 10 receptions for 153 yards and two
touchdowns. Andrew Aldrich ’10 added eight catches for 66 yards and Justin Williams ’11 scored a touchdown on a 12-yard
reception. Ben Sarver ’11 and Mark Hanabury ’11 caught conversion passes.

The Flyers raced out to a 41-0 lead by taking advantage of turnovers and strangling the Wildcat ground attack. Davidson
was held to 37 rushing yards on 24 attempts. Wildcat coach Tripp Merritt called the Dayton front seven the best
he had seen in the league. The Flyers got 10 points off of turnovers, including a 77-yard return of Alexander’s
fumble by Sean Heenan to cap their scoring.

Alexander came back on the next offensive play to find Konert, who broke several tackles and raced 66 yards for
a touchdown. The two then combined for a 10-yard score on the next drive. After Alexander’s interception in the red
zone, his 12-yard strike to Williams ended the scoring.

“Dayton has been a consistent contender in this conference for a long time,” Alexander said. “They’re well-coached and execute very
well. They just played better.”

Merritt was proud of the effort his team showed in the fourth quarter to rally, but added that they need
to play better over four quarters. The defense, for example, did not force a punt until nine minutes remained in
the fourth quarter, and did not force any turnovers.

The loss was particularly bitter because it came on the heels of a heartbreaking road loss to Valparaiso. The Wildcats
held a 21-3 lead before surrendering 26 unanswered points to the Crusaders. Davidson tied the game on Kenny Mantuo’s ’11
one-yard touchdown run and Alexander’s conversion pass to Konert, but lost in overtime when Alexander was intercepted by Anthony Curry.
Mantuo had two touchdowns on the day while Chad Barnes ’09 added 75 yards and a touchdown on 13 carries.
Alexander hit Williams with a 32-yard screen pass for a score, but he was intercepted three times. Aldrich led the
receivers with four catches for 50 yards.

The Crusaders were led by Ross Weimer, who rushed for 170 yards and three touchdowns on 22 carries. Valparaiso rushed
for 351 yards on 57 carries. Mantuo and Barnes paced the Wildcats in the first quarter, each rushing for a
nine-yard touchdown as Davidson took a 14-0 lead after the first period. Williams’ touchdown reception gave his team a 21-3
lead before the Crusaders added a field goal to make the halftime score 21-6. Weimer scored on runs of eight,
49 and 17 yards to give Valparaiso a 29-21 lead in the fourth quarter. Alexander made good on two fourth-down
conversions as he drove the Wildcats down the field for the tying score. Jake Riedel scored from two yards out
on the Crusaders’ overtime possession. The extra point was no good but Curry’s interception rendered that point moot.

The two losses bring Davidson to 2-4 overall, and 1-3 in the Pioneer Football League. The league season continues this
Saturday as the Wildcats fly to Iowa to take on Drake. Alexander said that practice for Drake would likely involve
focusing on “a recommitment to basic fundamentals,” but is confident Davidson can compete, “(If) we stay disciplined and play consistently.”
Tyler Lemons ’10, the leading tackler from the Dayton game, agreed, adding, “We just have to cut down on the
little mistakes.”

Men’s soccer drops two games at home

Despite Machel Turner ’10 scoring the first goal of the evening and securing a lead going into halftime against Furman
on Oct. 10, Davidson could not come out on top, eventually falling to the conference foes 2-1 at Stone Stadium.
Returning home the following Wednesday, Davidson faced off against Elon University. Going into the night, the Phoenix had an impressive
5-0-0 SoCon record and would improve to 6-0-0 after defeating Davidson 2-0.

At the 3:07 mark in the first half, Elon’s Erfan Imeni struck with their first goal off a pass from
Aaron Parker. After the first goal of the evening, nearly 60 minutes went by without another score. This period of
the game was very defensive with many scoring attempts by both clubs. One of these scoring attempts for Davidson came
right before halftime when Mark Millard ’12 led a fast break only to have his shot blocked by Elon’s goalie.

Elon up 2-0. Although Davidson lost, goalie Robby Goldsberry ’10 registered five first-half saves. Davidson outshot Elon 11-10 in the

I give up. It just does not make any sense anymore. Every time I think I have it figured out,
something happens that just boggles my mind. How can the National Football League be so unpredictable? The players are all
professional athletes, and fans have had years to evaluate them. It is truly amazing how wrong the experts can be
every week. I mean, it cannot be that hard, right? Well, let’s recap the start of the NFL season and
examine.

Quick, who’s been the best team in the NFL over the first seven weeks of the season? Count me among
those impressed if you quickly answered with the Tennessee Titans, the lone undefeated team at 6-0. The Titans cannot be
considered an enormous surprise, as they went 10-6 last season, but what about the usual suspects? The Patriots, I suppose,
can be forgiven. Any team that loses the reigning NFL MVP (Tom Brady) for the entire season can be forgiven
for an unimpressive 3-2 start. The Colts, though, have stumbled to 3-3 even with star quarterback Peyton Manning. The Browns,
who are coming off a resurgent 10-6 season? Try 2-4, with little to hang their hats on except a 35-14
throttling of the Giants, the reigning Superbowl champions. Speaking of those Giants...expected by many to take a step back this
year after their incredible run, they have shot out of the gate to 5-1. Dominant through their first four games,
they lost in the aforementioned blowout to the then 1-3 Cleveland Browns. Make any sense at all? No. The Browns
had been absolutely awful to begin the season, and then blow out the presumed best team in the league at
the time? It was borderline inexplicable.

The best individual example of this season’s craziness is the Washington Redskins. Breaking in a rookie head coach and with
an unproven quarterback, the 'Skins were written off in the preseason by many. The media blasted the Redskins after a
terrible close to the preseason, and even the devout fans (like me) expected little from this season. The Skins, though,
are 5-2 and boast road wins over Dallas and Philadelphia. Even my beloved Redskins, however, lost at home to the
0-4 Rams. This brings us to Dallas, which has a 4-3 record that hides their significant struggles. I confess, Dallas’
implosion could be predicted. Any team that harbors Adam “Pacman” Jones, Terrell Owens, and Tank Johnson in a locker room
with a notably weak-willed coach is a disaster waiting to happen. The Cowboys’ two straight losses to Arizona and St.
Louis have got me smiling, to say the least.

Many pundits had the Cowboys and Patriots as the two best teams in the league. Others expressed their opinion that
it would be the Colts, the Chargers, or the Packers. None are currently leading their division. They’ve fallen victim to
hot starts from the likes of Buffalo and Chicago, whom few had expected to contend.

Here’s another example of just how unpredictable this season has been. CBS Sportsline NFL writer Pete Prisco has hit on
62.8 percent of his picks this season. Those have been straight picks, meaning he did not pick against the spread.
I will be the first to admit that 62.8 percent is a reasonable average, if a bit low. But wait.
There’s a catch. Prisco has by far the best record of any major media pundit this season. These experts did
not suddenly lose their ability to analyze football. They have been reduced to simply average because of the general unpredictability
of today’s NFL.
