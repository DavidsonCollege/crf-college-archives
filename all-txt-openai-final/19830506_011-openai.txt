St. Komedus Laughs On Laughing

By BILL BARNETT

I was thinking the other night about Aristotle’s conception of God as “thinking on thinking.” He presents this view because
he considers thinking to be the most perfect act possible. What if he is wrong? What would be the ramifications
of a God who was “laughing on laughing”?

Worship services would be radically changed. First, the minister would read from the Bible, both Old Testament and New. A
typical reading might be Proverbs 1:1, “Take my wife... please!” or perhaps an excerpt from Jesus’ Monologue on the Mount.
Then he would perhaps have a responsive reading:

MINISTER: “The road to heaven is narrow!”
PEOPLE: “How narrow is it?”
MINISTER: “It is so narrow, the mice are hunchbacked!”

Then he would begin his sermon. “You know, a funny thing happened on the way to church this morning...”

There would be a huge upheaval in academia. Since the absence of God is evil, all literature would have to
be funny. Tragic plays would be banned. The sciences would suffer great setbacks, and math would probably be dropped altogether.
I mean, can you imagine trying to make a fourth derivative funny?

Actually, God revealed himself as laughing on laughing to a 14th-century mystic. St. Thomas Komedus was expelled from his monastery
when, in 1356, he broke his vow of silence by breaking out into uncontrollable laughter. He later revealed the events
of the mystic experience which led to his laughter: “Yea, and then was I embraced by the seraphim of the
Rubber Chicken, and was sanctified with marks of the Bunny Ears. Then was there a drumroll, and a mighty voice
of thunder rang out ‘He-e-e-e-re’s God!’”

Of course, as soon as he began preaching his new theology, the church attempted to excommunicate him. However, he and
his followers were so much fun to have around that no one had the heart to carry through with it.
This sect grew rapidly until it was dealt an almost fatal blow during the Crusades. An entire army of Komedians
were wiped out in a single blow. During prayer before their first big battle, they laughed so hard they fell
off their horses and were massacred by the infidels.

Their influence lingered on for a while. Tales were told of how they had laughed in the face of danger,
and an attempt was made to replace the gargoyles on Notre Dame with clown faces. After this movement failed (ruled
out by the impracticality of painting all that stone), their numbers gradually decreased. Today, there are only a few very
dedicated members. They hold great meetings, at which time they try and convert the masses by sharing their laughter. As
their meetings get funnier and funnier, and orthodox church services get more and more boring, perhaps they will succeed. Of
course, they never despair in their task, because he who laughs last laughs loudest, and they know who that will
be.
