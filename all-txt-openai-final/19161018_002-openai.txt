THE GYMNASIUM PLAN

When Dr. Martin appears next week before the executive committee of the Board of Trustees, he will propose two plans for the new gymnasium: one will be of a large building, able to accommodate a student body of five hundred, but lacking for the present a swimming pool; the other plan a smaller building, only a little larger than the present gymnasium, which is cramped in every way, but having a small swimming pool. At this meeting Dr. Martin will also tell which plan is favored by the students.

The thoughtless student will probably vote for the latter plan in order to enjoy the use of the swimming pool. But those who think will see that in a few years the student body will outgrow the smaller building as the present one has been outgrown, that students in the near future will be as crowded and unequipped as we are now. So we believe that in the voting Friday, altruistic, unselfish, far-sighted men, who have the best interests of the college at heart, will cast theirs in favor of the large building with the swimming pool to follow later.

KEEP THE CAMPUS CLEAN

Now that the leaves are beginning to fall, and the grass to turn brown, and the campus begins to look bare, any unsightly object can be seen clearly from a distance, and it is easy to make the “beautiful Davidson campus” appear anything but beautiful. An envelope carelessly dropped, an empty cigarette box thoughtlessly thrown away, each make ugly spots that the rest of the student body has to look at until “Uncle Hiram” and his prodding stick can make their feeble rounds. The campus is for our use, so why not keep it clean. Besides, the mere sight of our Librarian stooping to pick some piece of paper from the ground should be incentive enough to make waste-baskets of our pockets till we reach our rooms.

The Social Center is anything else just at present.

GOOD PRINTING CONSISTS OF MORE THAN INK, TYPE & PAPER
While there is nothing mysterious about the process, it requires, among other things, good judgment, taste, and a desire to keep ahead or above the average. The goodness of printing is governed by the printer’s equipment plus his ability to use it. We have a generous supply of both and are constantly adding to them.
