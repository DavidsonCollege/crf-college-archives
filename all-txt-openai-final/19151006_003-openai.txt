Mr. Hugh H. Caldwell (’03), who is connected with Georgia School of Technology, wrote the Alumni editor of “The Davidsonian”

its stay in Atlanta as much as possible.

You’re Safe in ordering your new Fall suit of us. You can feel assured that the patterns, fabrics, and models
we are showing this season are ultra in style—that workmanship and tailoring that go into our garments are the highest
that can be attained.

The Alumni Association proves valuable to the college, and on such occasions as this we will find that it is
a very agreeable thing. Already six of these Davidson College Alumni Associations have been started. The secretaries of the various
associations are doing all in their power to bring old Davidson men nearer together and keep up the feeling of
friendship. It is the aim of the association to entertain any Davidson alumnus who happens their way.

The following names and addresses of secretaries have been handed to The Davidsonian:
R. S. Marshall, Washington, D.C.; Prof. Edgar Dayton, New York City; E. R. Wharton, Greensboro, N.C.; E. G. Mallard, Greenville,
S.C.; C. F. Rowland, Jacksonville, Fla.; H. H. Preston, Buford (’09) is in the insurance business at Bristol, Tenn.

J. S. Simmons (’11), who graduated in medicine from the University of Pennsylvania last spring, recently stood his examination before
the North Carolina State Medical Board and made the highest average in the class taking the examination.

J. B. Arrowood (’16) is a student at Harvard University.

Davidson is well represented this year at Union Seminary, Richmond, Va., thirty-six Davidsonians being enrolled there. The Richmond Virginian carries
an interesting account of the first football game of the season, at the Broad Street Park, in which the Seminary

are Eugene Alexander, J. Thompson Pharr, E. S. Currie, J. R. Phipps, A. S. Anderson, T. P. Johnson, Jr., and
