### Council Members Respond To Editorial

**Bobby Silver, Bill Satterwhite, Rob Spaugh, and Rob Bradford**

As members of the Davidson College Honor Council, we were very concerned about last week’s Davidsonian editorial entitled “Honor” regarding deficiencies in Davidson's Honor System. We would like to answer some of the criticisms expressed in this editorial.

1. **Campaigning Process.** Last year, those in charge of campus elections (the Honor Council is not in charge of sponsoring its own elections, by the way) decided that flyers and door-to-door campaigning served no purpose in Honor Council elections. No Council member can have a platform since he or she cannot make changes in Honor Council procedures. Such changes are made by the Student Conduct Council, not the Honor Council. Therefore, what would be the basis of a candidate’s campaign? A candidate can solely claim, “Vote for me. I'm responsible and have the integrity to judge the accused in a mature manner.” Instead of allowing two dozen flyers with this nauseating phrase to be slipped under your door, now a list of candidates is distributed to the student body to publicize who is running. Since each candidate must be certified as eligible for election by passing a screening interview, students can assume that all candidates view the position seriously and are familiar with the responsibilities of the office. Students should vote for classmates of strong character and sound judgment, qualities which campaign slogans and flyers cannot adequately convey.

Furthermore, The Davidsonian seemed to think that if campaign slogans and flyers were allowed, “all students would know all candidates equally well.” This is a very naive assumption, for it is impossible for all voters to know all candidates equally well in any election. Admittedly, campaigning does hold merit in elections where issues and innovative ideas are the focus. However, as explained before, this is not the focus of Honor Council elections. Students should select Honor Council members whom they feel are conscientious and insightful. These qualities are far more essential to understanding and deciding the fate of fellow students than creativity and initiative. We feel that such qualities are best expressed in day-to-day living and not in a one-week campaign. It is possible to fool anybody through an effective campaign, but nobody is fooled by the way one lives his life day-by-day.

2. **Accountability.** The editors suggested that only by making trial information public could one gauge whether a Council member is fulfilling his or her obligations. We contend that only by sifting through every piece of evidence and testimony could one hope to judge the council's maturity in a decision. Never could one hope to judge the effectiveness of any individual member of the Council, just as it is impossible to judge the maturity of individual jurors in the American legal system. It is important to note that, contrary to what most students think, all Honor Council hearings are open to the public until requested closed by the accused individual. The decision to close a trial is made by the defendant, not by the Council. Therefore, there is no attempt by Council members to limit information and decrease their accountability, only to protect the rights of the accused.

The belief that candidates should stand for re-election would only add political motives to a process that should be de-politicized. Decisions made by an Honor Council member should be based solely upon the facts of the case at hand and not on perceived repercussions of the decision. Also, due to the complexity of Honor Council procedures and precedents that certain trials set, carry-over of Honor Council members is necessary to provide consistency of justice. Having a completely new council elected every year would be highly inefficient and unpredictable. Such a roller-coaster honor system would be self-destructing.

3. **Accessibility.** The editorial claimed that Council members are not accessible to students. We disagree. Honor Council members are leaders in countless other capacities on campus — in the Union, athletics, Y-Visible students on campus. The problem is not a matter of accessibility, but of whether or not students are willing to take advantage of this availability to approach Honor Council members and discuss issues which concern them. Too often, assumptions are made about the Honor System without getting the full story, resulting in rumors and harmful misconceptions. For example, in this editorial, the editors suggested that all Honor Council proceedings be public. However, with a little initiative and research, they would have discovered that all Honor Council proceedings are public until requested closed by the accused.

Secondly, the council members sponsor an annual honor week which discusses the strengths and weaknesses of our current system. Throughout this week, members man...Certainly! Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

---

an honor council booth and answer questions from interested students. Certainly, this can raise no questions of their accessibility. We believe that Honor Council members are just as accessible as other campus elected officers. We are open to discussion. We are more than willing to clear up any misconceptions if students will only seek us out before jumping to ill-founded conclusions.

4. Apathy. The scariest contention made in the editorial was that students should not vote in Honor Council elections, that they should be apathetic. The Honor System is a unique and positive element of Davidson College life, but it can continue only if the student body supports it. This includes not only a willingness to turn in suspected violators but to take the election of Honor Council members seriously. By advocating apathy with regard to the election process, The Davidsonian is supporting the undermining of one of the most important aspects of the Davidson College experience. This is not a responsible stand by the official publication of the College.

Silver, a senior psychology major from Charlotte, NC, is Chairman of the Honor Council. Satterwhite, a senior History major from Winston-Salem, NC, is Student Solicitor for the Honor Council. Spaugh, a senior history major from Winston-Salem, and Bradford, a sophomore history major from Windermere, FL, are members of the Honor Council.

So just what is the rest of the picture? We'll give you two examples. On September 31, 1983, eleven Korean university students were sentenced to prison terms ranging from one to one and a half years for their involvement in campus demonstrations and the distribution of anti-government fliers. Many of these demonstrations are as mild as when a group of students joins hands and sings a hymn on the campus grounds. Violence, if any, has always been incited by government-paid student plants and the police, who attack the students with tear gas, clubs, and armored trucks.

Our second example: on the eve of Ronald Reagan’s visit to Korea last November, over 1000 Koreans (students, professors, ministers, labor organizers) were put under house arrest for the duration of his visit. Why? The government wanted, as much as possible, to keep from Reagan and the Western press the stories of banned politicians, the horrendous labor conditions, the government surveillance, the student demonstrations.

So what conclusions can we draw from these disturbing incidents? First, Korea is far from the democratic model we hear about; its politicians systematically use oppression to maintain control. Second, U.S. policy toward Korea deserves serious re-evaluation, if human rights should play any part in our foreign policy. (How is Korea different from the Philippines?) Third, we urge you to join or help Amnesty International or some other human rights organization. The Korean students are our brothers and sisters; while they suffer we tend to put our social concern into philosophical abstractions. Fourth, we hope that you, as Davidson students, will not take for granted the tremendous freedom of expression which you are able to enjoy.

Literary Arts

To the Editors:

Since there is only one creative writing course here, but many inspired and creative writers and readers, we are having an organizational meeting this Monday, April 9 at 10:00 at the center. We welcome anyone interested in workshops or discussions to attend.

Candids

To the Editors:

Many seniors have expressed an interest in having their candids for the yearbook returned to them after the book has been printed. In order for us to do this, we need their help. The pictures will not be returned to Davidson from the printer until next fall, at which time there will be a different editor of Quips and Cranks. The new editor may not be able to deal with this situation unless we plan for it now.

If you would like your candid returned to you next fall, please leave an appropriate sized envelope, stamped and self-addressed with the Quips and Cranks office (upstairs from the Morrison Room in the Union or in the Quips and Cranks box in the mailroom of Chambers). Please do this by April 30, 1984.
