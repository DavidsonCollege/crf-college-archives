OLD SUMMER PHIS SATURDAY NIGHT

At eight o'clock on Saturday night, August 21, an old-fashioned square dance will be held on the lawn and pavement in front of Chambers Building. The square dance, which is sponsored by the YUCCA Social Committee, will last until 10 o'clock and is the last entertainment of the current term, celebrating the completion of the summer session.

The music for the dance will be furnished by a local band, procured by Jerry Newbold. Refreshments of cold drinks will be served by the management of the Student Store and may be obtained for a nominal fee.

Since this will be the last function before the close of the summer session, everyone is cordially invited to attend.
