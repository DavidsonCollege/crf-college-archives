ARTS & LIVING MONDAY, APRIL 18, 1994

The art now showing in the VAC

By Tom Mew

Selected pieces from Davidson’s Permanent Collection are currently on display in the William Van Every Gallery of the VAC. The pieces are quite impressive and reflect both the quality and diversity of the Davidson collection. The show covers a wide range of both styles and mediums and contains many excellent pieces by famous artists. Many fine pieces, including a Rembrandt etching, were donated by supporters of the college, a testament to the support that exists for visual arts at Davidson. Other works were purchased by the college and some, such as Roger Manly’s “Skull,” are gifts from the artists themselves.

A number of different types of works are on display. The photography collection is quite impressive and includes a striking picture by Diane Arbus. There are also a number of fine abstract works on display, including “Clam Digger,” a lithograph by world-renowned painter Willem de Kooning. Of particular local interest is a steamroller print by Andy Owen, which was created at the groundbreaking ceremony for the V.A.C. Although the show features pieces by several international painters, there are also works by regional artists, such as “Earth, Heaven, and Hell” by Georgia folk artist Howard Finster.

The show also features several smaller pieces by some of the true masters of art. Etchings by artists such as Edward Hopper and Goya are very powerful and impressive. This collection offers Davidson students an excellent chance to see for themselves works by artists they often only read about. Particularly impressive is Munch’s “Die Weiben,” a beautiful and haunting piece.

The exhibition is a testament to the strength of the Davidson collection. Art lovers should take advantage of the opportunity to see such a fine collection in a local setting.
