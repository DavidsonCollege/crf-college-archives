### Lack of Feedback

Feedback is perhaps too trendy a term for simple human consumption. Yet it is easier to accuse the administration of a lack of feedback rather than complain of clumsy simple communication. In Webster's, the term feedback means “the return to a point of origin of evaluative or corrective information about an action or process.” In Davidson, feedback means nothing.

The most striking example is the new student evaluation system. Starting this term, students will begin evaluating teachers using a new form. The University of Illinois worked for years on developing this form, and our own psychology department has tested it and overwhelmingly approves of it. Whatever its merits and drawbacks, there is one thing glaringly missing from the process: feedback to students. Why shouldn’t students be allowed to know how they have rated their own instructors? More importantly, isn’t it important that students know how students feel about the quality of courses and instructors?

In the not-too-distant past, the Student Government Association initiated an evaluation of courses and teachers and then published the results in the Davidsonian. The problem with those forms was a lack of a good sampling: forms were handed out at the end of each term and the percentages of response were not very impressive. But now the administration has approved an official evaluation form and the faculty will vote on this form next month. When these forms come into effect, the administration will receive from each class the compiled answers to three global questions: Rate the course content, rate the instructor, and rate the course in general. Students are treated as mature enough to answer these questions. Shouldn’t we also get to see the compiled answers?

Perhaps it is the professors themselves who do not see the need for feedback to students. In fact, some faculty members do not want students to evaluate professors at all, much less have students receive information about how other students feel about courses and teachers. But students need to know about how instructors perform, how effective professors are considered, and what level courses are on in order to intelligently select their courses. This is not information one can get from the Registrar. This is information that only students can provide. Under the new student evaluation system, students will be providing this information. But they will receive no feedback.

Another area where feedback is badly lacking is in tenure decisions. There is some confusion surrounding the decisions of last spring, but one error remains glaringly clear - the faculty members involved were not given sufficient feedback. Some of them were not receiving information about their performances from their department chairmen. Without this necessary feedback, it was very difficult to gauge performance and change accordingly.

The problem of insufficient feedback does not lie solely with the present administration. The latter is often following set rules. Yet if these rules unduly hinder feedback, this administration should change them. The Professional Affairs Committee is currently drafting revisions to the Code of Faculty Evaluation that may improve the situation. Perhaps a more human administrative position will be expressed in the code and regular formal feedback systems will become a working part of the code. We can only hope.

The problem with the proposed student evaluation forms remains. We need feedback on what students think of courses and professors just as much as the administration does. It’s a pity that the last published “Guide to Courses At Davidson” was satirical because students really do need to know general sentiment about courses and professors. Now that students are helping to compile that information, students should get feedback about what we say. Feedback needs to be incorporated into our policies dealing with both student evaluation and faculty evaluation. Feedback must be immediate to have an impact. If used successfully, feedback can be an extremely powerful tool in influencing behavior. The administration cannot be closed and operate effectively, and our codes and policies should not ask them to do so.

### The Campus Forum

To the Editor:

Recently we attended a national convocation at the Riverside Church, New York City, entitled “How to Reverse the Arms Race.” Twelve different workshops were offered.We have numerous resources we'd be glad to share. For now, we simply call attention to some of the issues to be more fully explored later. Official US policy is to try to avoid nuclear war by reliance on deterrence. One of the points made at the conference was that we have at the present time more than enough weapons to ensure mutually assured destruction.

It was pointed out that even if the Soviets were to launch a first strike which eliminated as much as 50% of our submarine-launched ballistic missiles, 80% of our intercontinental ballistic missiles, and 90% of our heavy bombers, the US would still have 4,400 surviving warheads, which is 10% more than the Soviets have right now before an attack. And yet the arms race continues. The increased accuracy, range, speed, mobility, and first strike capability of weapons we are now developing increase the threat of nuclear war. They promote a hair-trigger policy in a situation characterized by fear and distrust.

Do the Soviets pose a serious threat to our national security? The Reverend William Sloane Coffin, having recently returned from a trip to the USSR, had this to say: "I would not trust the Soviets to treat the Jews well, or respect the rights of their dissidents, or even to be able to hold on to their best dancers, but when it comes to disarmament, they may be more trustworthy than we. The 20 million dead in WWII are for the Russians what the Holocaust is for the Jews. The feeling is that this must never happen again."

The commonly held view that military spending is good because it stimulates the economy and creates jobs has come into question in recent years, giving rise to the opposing view that it actually increases inflation and steals jobs. Because a large number of military contracts are offered on a cost-plus basis, profits are guaranteed by the government and no incentives to cut costs are present. The waste generated by this practice claims extra tax dollars, causes a reduction in the stock of civilian goods and services, and pushes up raw material prices. Highly technological military research also monopolizes a large number of our scientists and engineers, preventing adequate research in the civilian sector, resulting in declining productivity and increasing costs.

One of the workshops at the conference was on registration and the draft. There were two main moral objections expressed. The first was the issue of forced labor, i.e. slavery, which conscription represents. The other was expressed by a member of the Coalition of Conscientious Objectors, who also reminded us that one no longer has to be a member of a particular religious sect to qualify.

The practical objections centered around the support of non-interventionism. Many felt that the military wanted mass conscription of troops in order to wage small-scale wars in the third world, which does more long-term harm than good.

An Asian child was in his mother’s arms as she walked down Riverside Drive at the end of the day. Nearby, a black child, a white child, a Chicano child played stickball. Their laughter was for us a summons to peace. As one speaker had remarked, "We do not so much inherit the earth from our ancestors as we borrow it from our children."

To the Editor:

Next Thursday, November 1, the Davidson ROTC Cadets will sponsor the annual Red Cross Fall Blood Drive to be held in the student union. Because of the Davidson tradition of supplying a generous number of donations, this fall’s goal has been set at 275 pints. This is a tremendous opportunity for the Davidson community to render a service to the larger Charlotte-Mecklenburg area. When an average day's usage of blood in this area is 1150 pints, such a service is greatly needed. I would like to encourage all Davidson residents to help us help others. The gift of blood is the gift of life.
