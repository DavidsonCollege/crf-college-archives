**Learn to wine and dine like a gourmet (or how to really impress a date for only $12)**

By JENNIFER HOFFMAN

Are you the type of person who “likes and is an excellent judge of fine foods and drinks?” If so,
you would fit New World Dictionary’s definition of a gourmet. But even if you’re just a hungry student who’s sick
of beer and pizza, you should reserve a seat at the Gourmet Society Dinner Wednesday, April 11, at 7 p.m.

What distinguishes plain good eating from “fine” food and drink? The committee of seven faculty, staff, and students who took
three meetings to plan the meal strove to find that distinction. Professional guidance came from committee regulars Carl Pritchard (Director
of Auxiliary Services), Leandro Tolentino (Dining Services Purchase Manager), and Margaret Barber (Assistant Manager of Dining Production). Members finally agreed
on the menu listed here, although the final version will be printed in French because it is “the language of
the gourmet,” said Pritchard.

* This is the Gourmet Society’s sixth year. New members are selected every term to offer a fresh perspective, said
Pritchard. “Each dinner reflects the committee.”

The committee selects every detail of the food and wine for the meal. For example, this term’s dinner features the
salad after the main course. The committee’s third meeting was devoted to choosing the perfect wines to complement the meal.
Discussion typically went as follows:

“Anyone entranced by any of these?” asked Pritchard after serving two candidate wines to complement the cheese and fruit.

“No,” said Bob Manning, committee member and professor of physics and humanities.

“That’s why we’re here,” said Pritchard, as he requested three more choices be brought out for tasting.

All said and done, Pritchard estimates that a comparable meal at a restaurant would run $45-50 a person. Tickets for
this dinner cost $3 for students on meal plans, $6 for all other students, and $9.25 for faculty, staff, and
spouses. The meal is restricted to 150 people, so tickets should be purchased this week at the Commons. For more
information, contact Brenda Harvey at 892-2348.

As senior Scott Constantini put it, “For $12, it’s a really cheap date.” Prices include food, wine, and live music.

The following people made up the 14th committee for the Gourmet Society: Scott Constantini (senior), Pat Gardner (Administrative Sec. for
Academic V.P.), Lois Kemp (Prof. Spanish), Ben Klein (Prof. Mathematics), Bob Manning (Prof. Physics & Humanities), Pat Martin (Dir. Annual
Fund), and Mary Snyder (senior).

**Children of the malt® part IX**

**The great malt of China (and the Far East)**

By JOHN HUTCHINSON

“He knows beer, he knows everything” and will be included in a later column.

I extend thanks to Don Kimmel and his wife Meg (of Kappa Sig chicken fame), Dick and Pam Hay, Joe
Thomas, and Charles Houck, the multitude of guest drinkers who participated in this week’s blind-tasting session.

In addition to beers from the Far Eastern countries of Japan, China, and India, we sampled three new American beers.
China Beer and Panda Beer, two additional Oriental beers, were temporarily unavailable.

**Asahi Dry:** Sharp taste, musty aftertaste. “Tastes like dental zylocane”—Meg Kimmel. “Honey, can I have the rest of yours?”—Don Kimmel.

**Sapporo Dry:** Light, smooth beer. Not much character. Weak. “Smells like the sinks at the KA house. This beer says,
‘I’m going for the broad Japanese market’”—Thomas.

**Sapporo:** Mild with a nice flavor that quickly fades. Bitter. “A little weak, but it’s trying hard. An expensive beer
that misses”—Thomas.

**Kirin:** Light, bubbly, sweet smell, like vanilla—Thomas. The newlywed quote: “Honey, I knew you’d like this beer when I first
smelt it”—Dick Hay.

**Kirin Light:** Watery. “The Gatorade of beer”—Meg Kimmel. “If you can keep yourself from smelling it while you drink it,
it isn’t that bad”—Pam Hay. “Disappointing. D-, but B- if they freeze-dried it and took half the water out”—Houck.

**Golden Eagle:** Smells like a darker beer than it is, tastes almost like an English Ale. Nice color. Full, smoky
taste. “I’m not sure I like it, but I’m a real weenie when it comes to beer”—Meg Kimmel. “It holds
up as you drink it”—Don Kimmel.

**Tsingtau:** Bubbly, bitter. “Surprisingly full-bodied for its color. I like the bitterness”—Don Kimmel. “The flavor says, ‘Hey, I could drink
that.’”—Houck.

**Hua Nan:** Flat, virtually no flavor. The beer was apparently too old.

**Sapporo Black:** Very dark color, could have a little more body. Rich taste, “a little sweet for my taste”—Don Kimmel.
“If you don’t like it dear, I’ll finish it”—Dick Hay to his wife Pam.

**Pete’s Wicked Ale:** Beautiful color, gets better after the first two sips. “Metallic twang”—Houck. “Must be an acquired taste, and
I’m slowly acquiring it”—Thomas.

**Wild Goose Amber:** “Smells nutty”—Dick Hay. “Smells like a beauty shop permanent”—Pam Hay. “Smells fruity and has a rancid, penetrating
flavor”—Thomas. “Harsh in the back of the throat”—Don Kimmel.

**Sierra Nevada Porter:** The taste is too sweet in the middle. “Borders on liquor”—Don Kimmel. “I am completely unqualified to
grade this beer. It tastes like candy”—Meg Kimmel.
