Friday, September 8, 1989 THE DAVIDSONIAN

~ucts, the apne of con-
doms in “Good Stuff” boxes, for an education
and distribution of condoms to inform students of the se-
riousness of the disease.

Junior Cecily Craighill,
Rusk Senator and the liaison
between the SGA and the
SHOC committee, said the SGA plans to
distribute condoms. The administration finally
has taken a step to deal with a very serious issue.

Craighill mentioned that some might not ask for
condoms because they may be too embarrassed.
While the SGA, SHOC, and the administration
may have differing ideas on how condoms ought to
be distributed, all agree on the importance of the issue.

Is Concern for date rape declining?

By TAYLOR SMITH

Missing from this year’s
freshman orientation was the
subject of date rape. Last year,
the topic was brought directly
to the freshman dorms by
groups of concerned Davidson
students. These students have
since graduated, leaving no
one to fill the void.

Ruth Pittard, of the Women’s
Concerns Committee, cites
media typing, traditional sex
roles, and mainly alcohol as
factors contributing to a high
incidence of date rape.

According to Pittard, date
rape is defined in terms of
problem and solution.

“We hope to change the atti-
tude toward date rape from
one of problem to one of pre-
vention,” she said. Both men
and women need to adjust
their perceptions of date rape,
Pittard added.

The matter of date rape is
one that has not been specifi-
cally designated to any office
at the college. However, ef-
forts toward institutionalizing
programs to address the prob-
lem are under way.

Leslie Marsicano, Assistant
Dean of Students, stated that
the subject of date rape was
not addressed during orienta-
tion because the freshmen
were already inundated with
other items. She feared that
the subject would be forgotten
amongst all the other topics of
discussion.

As an alternative, said Mar-
sicano, “Programs addressing
the problem are being set up in
conjunction with Charlotte
rape crisis centers.”
