Delt 1, Emanon 1, Porter’s Lead IMAC; Keeter’s Falls

By HOWARD BOYD
Asst. Sports Editor

The Betas knocked Keeter’s from the unbeaten ranks 54-45 Monday as Dennis Cholak fired in 21 points, leaving only three
teams unbeaten in IMAC basketball. The outside gunnery of Cholak, Randy Ely, and Scott Nicholson propelled the Betas to a
35-33 halftime lead, which Keeter’s was unable to overcome. Gary Scibal’s 14 points were high for the losers, who dropped
to 6-1 and into a second-place tie with the Betas in League B.

The Delts (8-0) continued to roll, blasting Emanon 2 76-47, before rallying to down upset-minded Sentelle 4 66-60 Tuesday. Greg
Sikes popped in 27 points to pace the win over Emanon and poured in 59 as the Delts overcame a
37-32 halftime deficit to edge Sentelle 4. Emanon 1 and Porter’s both remained unbeaten in League C at 7-0.

Tarver Picked In Handball

By PETE CELENTANO

This year’s intramural handball championship will offer a more unique setup than last year’s. For the first time, there will
be organized leagues with fraternities, halls, and independents competing for team, rather than individual, championships.

There are two leagues. Each league will play seven rounds, to be completed by Feb. 19. The top four teams
from each league will go to an eight-team single elimination tournament, where the winner will be decided.

League B, while not strong overall, does have the probable champion in the SPE’s. Led by Buzz Tarver, the premier
handballer on the Davidson campus and last year’s individual champion, the SPE’s figure to repeat as title holders. Figuring to
give the SPE’s competition are the ATO’s and an independent team, the Klutzes. The former have a consistent and aggressive
competitor in Charlie Summers and a competent backup man in Doug Berry and could surprise. The latter, with rangy Frank
Soos and aggressive (though inconsistent) Den Parman, pose a threat in doubles competition. The Betas and Pax 1 will probably
fight it out for the final playoff spot. Pax 1 has lefty Steve Earp, probably the best sophomore handballer, and
Charlie Slagle and is the choice to hold off the Betas, who have no outstanding talent but are very steady
and could upset the top four.

League A does not have any individual of Tarver’s talent, but overall, is much stronger than League B. The favorite
here is Fanny and Mabel, with Lynn Wagner. He is aggressive and cagy and has a chance at dethroning Tarver.
Behind F and M are four teams evenly matched in talent and experience. The Delts, led by Ross Manire, Tom
Traxler, and Frank McShane, are strong and fast. Challenging them for the second spot will be SAE’s, whose McCloud and
Mitchener are equally as fast and more experienced than the Delts. Scrambling for the remaining playoff spots are the Betas
and the Pikas.For the last playoff spot are the Mavericks, another independent team, and Emanon. The former is led by
Bernard Scoggins who, when he is right, is one of the best players in the league. Russ Merritt complements Scoggins’
strength with his scrambling style and makes them a solid playoff contender. Emanon's athletic sophomores, led by Larry Ruddell, should
make it close, but will probably finish a strong fifth. The final three places are pretty much up for grabs.

Frank Clark dropped in 32 markers and Steve Culbertson 15 as Porter’s trounced Cannon 11 72-52 last Thursday, and hit
27 more in an 85-64 rout of the Taus Monday. Tim Winter pitched in 20 and Howard Arbuckle 19 to
aid Clark against the Taus, now 5-2, who were led by Jim Montgomery with 21, as high-scoring Mitchell Johnson canned
only six. Sluggish Emanon shook off Watts 67-48 with a balanced attack, overcoming 25 points by freshman Barney Brewton.

F & M gained the lead in League A with a big win over Delt I 66-60, but Watt II
(6-1) remained hot on their heels by knocking off the E's 77-68 Tuesday. Rollie Sumwalt pumped in 26 points and
Tony Martin had 12 of his 15 in the second half as F & M nipped the Delts, who led
26-25 at halftime. Bill Mellwaine’s 23 points paced the losers, who played without leading scorer Jim Brown. They are now
5-2, and tied with the E’s and Emanon for third place. Tuesday Marvin hit 26 and Sumwalt 20 as F
& M squeaked past Sentelle 61-57. Billy Lyon scored 25 for the losers, (2-6). Watts II crushed the Plumbers 100-59
as Mark Rodgman and Hesty Hesterberg combined for 48 points, before whacking the E’s.

The IMAC’s leading scorers include: League A, Rodgman (24.0); League B, Dave Hassel, Cl, (25.3), Mike Harding, PAX, (24.0), Sikes
and Gary Pomeroy, S4, (23.3); League C, John Simms, SPE, (28.0), Clark, (24.9), Sam Upchurch, Emanon I, (23.2), and George
