MOORESVILLE THEATRE

“SONG OF LOVE”
This picture stars Miss Katharine Hepburn and some other character by the name of Henri, according to Stowe, proprietor. I do not vouch for the ability of Mr. Henri, but Miss Hepburn is reputed to be a good actress. However, one cannot conclude from this that it will be a thrilling picture because it is not always the policy of Hollywood producers to cast their most talented actors and actresses in the best movies.

Wednesday and Thursday February 4 and 5

Of course, you don’t have to be too interested in the fight game to enjoy it, because according to advanced predictions, the realism isn’t too real. Mickey Rooney should give you a few laughs, although that will probably depend more on your mood than on Rooney's ability as a comedian.

Friday and Saturday February 6 and 7
“THIS TIME FOR KEEPS”
