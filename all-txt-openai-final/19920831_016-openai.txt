Do You Have What It Takes?

Are you an informed, articulate, and insightful individual with a perspective on the human situation which you think might be informative/helpful to the Davidson Community? Or, are you an attention-starved little smartass who's just dying for a bigger audience?

Either way, we want you!!!
