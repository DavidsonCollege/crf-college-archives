Vietnam remembered in the Gallery

University of Kentucky professor Dr. George Herring discusses “The War That Seems to Never Go Away”

By Moran Downer

In spite of the entertainment of a basketball game and the Winter Olympics, nearly every seat in Chambers Gallery was
filled when Dr. George Herring, a professor of history at the University of Kentucky, spoke about the impact of the
Vietnam War on the United States. The audience mutely echoed the theme of his discourse: The War That Seems to
Never Go Away. In fact, he pointed out, Vietnam has haunted our view of ourselves as a nation, as well
as tempered our foreign policy initiatives.

In March 1991, Herring began, with the military success of Desert Storm, former President George Bush triumphantly announced that “the
ghost of Vietnam had been laid to rest beneath the sands of the Arabian desert.” Large numbers of troops had
landed on foreign soil and achieved a smashing victory. Signs proclaiming “Iraq is Arabic for ‘Vietnam’” had all but disappeared.
The Nation stood united behind the war effort. Yet just days before his proud proclamation, Bush had refused to send
the armies on to Baghdad for total victory, in part for fear of being entrapped in a political and diplomatic
quagmire.

Debates over possible U.S. intervention in Haiti and Bosnia in 1993 and ‘94, as well as a disastrous involvement in
Somalia in 1993, recalled the very ghost that Bush claimed to have buried. Even now, the nations of the world
shrink from the possibility of returning to war with Iraq. Americans clearly have not forgotten.

The question Herring addressed was, Why the war is still here? Why it is so pervasive and lasting? Why, after
20 years, does it still have so much influence on our nation?

First, Herring stated, Vietnam was America’s longest war. The U.S.’s direct involvement spanned a quarter of a century, and the
U.S. did not normalize relations with Vietnam until 1995, under President Bill Clinton. Technically, the Vietnam War was not dead
when Bush declared the disposal of its ghost. Also, fighting the war itself was extremely difficult and peculiarly frustrating. The
heat in the mountainous jungle “could kill a man, bake his brains, ring the sweat from him until he died
of exhaustion,” a lieutenant had remembered. Americans also had suffered due to the language and cultural gap between themselves and
the Vietnamese. It was hard to tell friend from foe. Perhaps the worst predicament for the soldiers was the formless
yet lethal nature of guerrilla warfare. There were no fixed objectives or clear battle lines. One quarter of the casualties
came from mines and booby-traps.

The mood at home was unfortunately equally frustrating, Herring continued. While protests of war were not uncommon in the U.S.,
the country during the war was also in the midst of social upheaval, in which all of the old values
and institutions were being questioned and challenged. And in the face of a growing opposition to Vietnam, neither the Johnson
nor Nixon Administrations could make a compelling argument that the war was just or necessary in terms of national security.
Weariness of the war at home and abroad then spurred a desire to get out of it, no matter what
the consequence.

Yet the end of the war proved both traumatic and bitter. The U.S. did not lose. It withdrew. In effect,
the U.S. quit. This was difficult to explain or accept, and when South Vietnam then rapidly collapsed, the question, What
was it all for? was asked. What did they all die for? Where was the ideal, the philosophy? This war,
Herring asserted, caused the nation to confront its beliefs about the U.S. and the American character. The idea of “American
exceptionalism” was founded on the belief in “American benevolence” that holds that the nation has acted kindly and generously to
other nations, never using violence if pressed. As the myth crumbled, Americans began to perceive and actively look for evil
in America’s past. Americans wanted to abandon all myth, even though its purpose is instruction, not factual truth.

The idea of “American invincibility” was also badly shaken. The U.S. looked for excuses, for reasons why it could not
beat a “second-rate” country. Americans even attempted to convince themselves that they could have won if they had really wanted
to. But whether people blamed the antiwar media, the timid leadership, or the restrictions imposed by Johnson (who held back
a full military effort in favor of a strategy of pressuring the enemy to accept a divided country), the results
were still there, unchangeable.

The war will never end, Herring concluded, until the memory of those results have been erased by time, until the
generation that fought and opposed Vietnam has passed on. The men and women of that generation, as well as students,
then began to offer comments and ask questions. One after the other raised a hand and began with, “I am
a Vietnam Veteran.” Colonel Quincy Collins, an Air Force pilot and a Prisoner of War for seven years, spoke of
the feelings of honor and patriotism mixed with disillusionment and the horror of war. “I believed in what I was
doing,” he said, “and I clung to that belief for the sake of my own psyche. (I later) realized that
the Department of Defense and the government of the United States don’t always tell the truth.”

Americorps encourages students to become more active

Have you ever wondered what really happens in the Davidson community? Americorp and the Bonner Foundation are offering an opportunity
to find out with the...Americorp Leaders Program, what Community Service Coordinator Bill Abrams said will “get (students) in deeper into
the community.” The year-and-a-half-long program will begin this summer and will continue until the end of the next summer. During
this time, a maximum of 20 participants will perform 900 hours of community service for a grant of $2,362.50 from
the federal government. The program will be broken up into three phases, one during each summer and one during the
school year, each of which requires 300 hours of service. Two hundred fifty hours will be spent on direct service,
while 50 will be spent on reflection and leadership training.

Abrams said that the program is “designed so students already doing the work can get more money” because some of
the students were having trouble financing their educations. In fact, many students, including Bonner scholars and federal work-study students, are
already completing a majority of the required hours. Also, Pittard said that there are already “people here with the same
attitude” that the program seeks to create. Despite the grant, the money is not the primary issue. Associate Dean of
Community Service & International Student Programs Ruth Pittard said that the students would be “doing it (the service) for a
love of what they’re doing.”

A group of 20 participants, from the community as well as the College, will serve as staff for programs that
cannot afford to hire additional help. Instead of completing what Abrams and Pittard believe to be the important but peripheral
work that requires little long-term commitment, the participants will work in the running of the program and gain a more
thorough understanding of what occurs. The work will involve policy making, volunteer training, research, connections with national organizations, and needs
assessment. Abrams said that the participants will complete “a different genre of work.”

Participants will choose from 20-30 internships chosen by the College, but the internships will not be limited to these choices.
Everything is still in the planning phases, but Pittard and Abrams plan to offer internships at organizations such as the
Davidson Housing Coalition, the Ada Jenkins Center, and the Davidson Youth Activity Center. Pittard said that they “encourage people to
look at your individual passions, spiritual base you operate from, what your views of yourself and your own life are,”
and to choose service work relating to these beliefs. No matter what the participants choose to do, Abrams said that
the work will be “focusing on the immediate community” and “building ties in Davidson,” not Cornelius, Huntersville, or the surrounding
areas. Pittard added that the program is a “wonderful way to get to know the community in which you live
in a way which is not open to every student.”

Abrams and Pittard said that the program is “open to anyone willing to do the work” who needs money for
his or her education. Of the maximum 20 participants, they hope to have approximately 15 Davidson students and five community
members. The community members could be high school students or anyone who has educational expenses. Abrams wants to include community
members because they are “looking for diversity in the group.” The Davidson students should be current freshmen, sophomores, or juniors
who are willing to remain after graduation. Anyone who is interested should contact Abrams as soon as possible. If the
program is successful, Pittard said, “it will presumably happen again.” The program’s renewal does depend upon political circumstances because the
Corporation for National Service, the parent organization of Americorp, is one of President Clinton’s programs.

Pittard and Abrams are optimistic about the effect the program will have upon the community. Abrams feels that the program
“will encourage ties between the student body at the college and the community” as well as “strengthen (existing) bonds.” Pittard
hopes that “it will be part of the process and the solution” of helping the community heal after the Christmas
Day shooting, although it is “not the solution.” She feels that it will increase the cooperation that already exists between
the college and the community. As Abrams said, the program “ties into the mission of the College, to prepare students
for meaningful lives of leadership and service.”
