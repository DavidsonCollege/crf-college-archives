’Cats Top Birds In Fast Moving Game (Continued from Page 1)

Nice runs by Pittman before ball goes to the Carolina team. Four minutes to play before half. Lafferty receives a
lateral from Pittman and gallops 23 yards. Two passes, one to Lafferty and one to Armfield place the ’Cats on
the Birds’ three-yard line. On third down Pittman, starting around right end, passes to Armfield for first down. Pittman fails
to score. Score 6-0.

Third Quarter

After an exchange of punts, with the exception of a 10-yard jaunt by Yarborough for the ’Cats, the Birds acquire
the ball and on a fake kick the South Carolinians get loose for a gain of about 25 yards. Here
the Birds’ drive failed but on an exchange of punts, Clary, after momentarily fumbling, zig-zagged with right arm flying through
the entire Davidson team for a touchdown. “Six” Johnston blocked the place kick. Lafferty and Pittman make repetitions of their
previous long jaunts before the quarter ends.

Fourth Quarter

Verble drives bullet-like through center for 7 yards. Lafferty whips off several yards on a pass to the Birds’ 17-yard
line. Pittman passes to Verble for Burns, Wildcat center, intercepts a pass. Yarborough drives through right tackle for 8 yards.
Yarborough gets a first down. Second and nine. Pittman receives ball and twists through Gamecock's line for the ’Cats second
score. Pittman converts. Score 13-6. Using a diversified attack, the Carolinians—through the efforts of Alexander and Clary, advance to the
'Cats 30, but here the attack ended as did also the game.

Plans Years Work

Professor S. C. Lyon to Address Club During Year

The Photography Club has begun its third year at Davidson with G. B. Squires as president and J. K. Abernethy
as secretary-treasurer. Few definite plans have been made as yet, but the year promises to be an interesting and helpful
one for the members. The club has as its purpose the encouragement of better photography among the students of the
college. Several times during the year, lectures are given by those who are well advanced in the field of photography.
Professor S. C. Lyon will give several talks during the coming months, dealing with such technical details as the use
of filters, enlarging, and composition of pictures. Aside from these lectures, Dr. Lyon is invaluable to the club as one
from whom the members can seek further information about the subject. Pearson Hassell will repeat his talk on oil tinting,
which he gave last year.

The club plans several improvements in the dark room in Shearer Hall, and for this purpose, funds will be contributed
by the members. These improvements will include a printing box, an enlarging outfit, and other necessary equipment. The club is
an informal one, there being no qualifications for membership and no dues. Members of the group cover various activities and
organizations for the annual. The club extends an invitation to all who are interested to join.

Dr. W. L. Lingle Speaks Twice in Johnson City

Dr. Walter Lingle spent the weekend in Johnson City, Tennessee, where he spoke in the First Presbyterian Church. He spoke
twice at this church on Sunday upon invitation of the pastor, Robert King, D.D., an alumnus of Davidson. His sermons
were received both times by large congregations. Dr. Lingle left Saturday afternoon for Johnson City, accompanied by four freshmen from
Davidson: Wharton, who had his leg broken at the first Freshman football game with Darlington, Harry Gasteiger, H. R. McClellan,
and W. C. Miller. They visited there during the weekend while Dr. Lingle spoke and visited with the alumni in
that section of the country. The party returned to Davidson Monday morning just before dinner, after leaving Johnson City at
1 in the morning.

Fifth is a new library, which would relieve the cramped condition which now exists due to the small size of

campus on weekends is the sixth major cause.

Men Come to JOHNSON’S BARBER SHOP

Shakespeare, but we insist that there IS something in a name. For instance, the name: “Stetson Air-Light Bantam” tells a
complete story of the ever so... unimpeachable style authority; “Air-Light” graphically describes the weight (or should we say “lack of
weight”) and “Bantam” epitomizes the rakish ruggedness. Its companion hat “The Playboy” is presented with a narrower band. Other Stetsons
