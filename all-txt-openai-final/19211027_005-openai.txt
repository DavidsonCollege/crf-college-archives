THE DAVIDSONIAN, OCTOBER 27, 1921.

THE PEANUT PARCHER

There is a young chappie, Mahood,
Who is said to be terribly good,
But sad to relate
At this early date
The squirrels say he is excellent food.

High Water.

Bryant—“Tommy, were you in the ark?”
Tommy Bethea—“No, of course not.”
Bryant—“Well, why didn’t you get drowned then?”

There was a young fellow, McJunkin
Who didn’t like pie made of pumpkin,
But take this as a tip
His biscuit and zip
He surely could put by the ner in.

The Reason.

McGukin—“Mc, do you shave yourself?”
McAlpine—“Yes! Why?”
McGukin—“I thought it would be a shame to spend 15 cents on that face.”

Hoo

John McCutcheon (after eating prunes rather ravenously)—“What in the hind are these things? Persimmons?”

’Tis So.

A Fresh went to Hades once,
A few things to learn.
Old Satan sent him back again,
He was too green to burn.

Eating.

Fraser—“What’s the matter, Sharpe?”
Sharpe—“I just ate a square meal and the corners are hurting.”

True.

Some one made a long speech in chapel last week. What was it all about? He didn’t say.

Math Problem.

Professor (to class)—“What is the distance between the floor and the ceiling of this room called?”
Intense silence rules.

A Matter of Etiquette.

Professor (after pause)—“Height.”

Paul Jamison—“Yonan, are you drinking out of your saucer again?”
Joash—“No, Paul, I am inhaling some medicine to cure the cold I expect to catch next month.”

It is rumored that George McCutcheon is going to have a rabbit painted on his head in order to get
a bit of hare.

His Reason.

Flop Beaver—“There used to be something you liked about me.”
She—“Yes, but you spent it all.”

The Beverage.

Fresh Patterson—“Wildman, how about giving me a little aid?”
Wildman—“What kind of aid?”
Patterson—“Lemonade.”

What has become of the old-fashioned gentleman who used to get six saucers full out of every cup of coffee?

Knowledge.

The education class is studying “Human Behavior.” It does look as if these students would know how to behave without
spending three hours a week learning.

Real Music.

All by myself
In a big morris chair
All the folks were there
Playing solitaire.

Ten Flat.

Siddle—“What you running for, Tucker?”
Tucker—“To get to Chambers building.”

A Good Fit.

Clerk—“Now how does that shoe feel, Mr. Menzies?”
Menzies—“I didn’t know it could feel.”

Yes.

A pessimist is a man who wears both a belt and suspenders.

The Truth Hurts.

Dr. Hood in psychology, looking straight at Gig Sheperd, said, “Our next lesson will be on the causes and effects
of feeblemindedness.”

Mark Time.

Some of the very conservative Seniors find they have to stand pat—Miller.

Some Aerial Attack.

Hy'po Regen, while gazing at the moon, the other night walked into the flagpole and bent the top over.

An Open Spot.

Ignorant—“Is this a tennis court?”
Wise—“No, this is a landing place for mosquito hawks.”

A Volunteer.

Bobbie Bachman joinslocal Boy Scout troops.

OFFICE OF THE REGISTRAR BROADENED OUT THIS YEAR

Davidson has made another step toward a more efficient administration in the establishment of the office of registrar. There all
student records are kept, from entrance credits to alumni records. There all absences are recorded, although the absence committee still
meets with the dean. Monthly and term grades are recorded there and reports sent out. This centralizing of all student
records in one office helps in the maintenance of a more efficient system. The first one to hold this office
is Mr. F. W. Hengeveld, our capable and popular coach of basketball and baseball. The office was formerly held by
Miss Shaw, the Librarian, in addition to her regular duties, but has grown too heavy for such an arrangement to
continue.

The women of the Presbyterian Church are reorganizing their various societies into an Auxiliary according to the “circle plan.” Mrs.
J. R. Withers is president, and Mrs. J. M. Douglass is secretary.
