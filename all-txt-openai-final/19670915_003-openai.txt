New Faces Mark Keydet Lineup For New Season
By BOB REID
Sports Editor

Smarting from a humiliating 2-8 performance last season, the Virginia Military Institute Keydets will be out to avenge last year's record with a crop of new faces in the starting lineup. Only one starter from last year, defensive halfback Bob Smalzriedt, will be back in the top lineup this year, according to Head Coach Vito Ragazzo. Smalzriedt, a 5-10, 195-pound co-captain from Cedar Grove, N.J., will anchor the defense, while co-captain Charlie Bishop will spark the offense at quarterback in hopes of garnering an early win to fire up the win-hungry Keydets.

Last season injuries and only fair talent plagued the Keydets and made Coach Ragazzo's first year at VMI less than pleasant. VMI downed Villanova and Richmond for the only wins of the season, while losing to such teams as The Citadel, Virginia Polytechnic Institute, and Boston. Davidson will be VMI's first opponent in a schedule which includes meetings with Georgia, Virginia, and VPI. The season will open at 2 p.m. tomorrow on the Keydets’ home field in Lexington, Va.

The Keydets plan to run a mixed offense, experimenting with both passing and running in order to find a 'Cat weakness, Ragazzo said. "We don’t do strictly one thing," he said, "we'll just have to see what works best." Ragazzo said he hopes his defense will be strong this year, with Smalzriedt and lineman Don Taylor anchoring the pack. Taylor, a 5-9, 200-pounder from Roanoke, Va., started several games last year at middle guard. He was named conference Lineman of the Week last year for his performance in VMI's 14-13 victory over Villanova.

The Keydets expect a tough challenge in handling the 'Cats’ offense, Ragazzo said, since he feels Davidson will be strong on the ground and in the air. "(Quarterback Jimmy) Poole will be running a good passing game, but Davidson ran the ball pretty good last year too. We'll have to work on stopping (fullback Kerry) Keith and (halfback Billy) Taylor."

Coach Ragazzo also declined to make any predictions about tomorrow's game or the season outlook as a whole. "We're not thinking about the rest of the season right now," he said. "We're just getting ready to play Davidson. We can't afford to worry about all our opponents. We just have to take them one at a time."

After Davidson, the Keydets’ schedule includes games with West Virginia, Sept. 23; Richmond, Sept. 30; William and Mary, Oct. 7; The Citadel, Oct. 14; Georgia, Oct. 21; Virginia, Oct. 28; Akron, Nov. 4; Boston College, Nov. 11; and VPI, Nov. 22.

Experience and Reserves Bolster Fogleman’s Hopes
Eleven returning lettermen scattered throughout most of the positions have brightened hopes for an improved Davidson soccer team, Coach Harry Fogleman said this week. The team, which began practice Wednesday, boasts a letterman at every position except goalie. Team captain Bobby Pryor will highlight the contingent of returning lettermen. Pryor, a senior, will also pace the four lettermen at halfback, who are John Flowers, John Schimmel, and Roger Duttweiler.

Lack of depth at the fullback slots may prove the team's greatest weakness, Fogleman said. Lettermen Joe Norton and Bob Powell will hold down starting berths, but Fogleman said he needs substitutes at those positions in order to rotate players. Fogleman said he may switch several linemen to backfield positions to compensate for lack of depth. Five returning lettermen should spark the line, Fogleman said, and several freshmen and juniors should provide needed depth. Alec Neisler and Greg Simmons may alternate between center and inside, he said, with Dave Dilley at the other inside spot. Bobby Lanier and Jim Marrow will provide power and experience at the wings, he said.

Davidson's cross country team, which begins its season on its own course next month with a match against Wake Forest, should enjoy a successful season, coaches said. Head coach Heath Whittle and his assistant, Sterling Martin, said they are optimistic about this year's prospects, and are basing their hopes on returning veterans and promising freshmen.

Two changes in the Southern Conference rules will affect this year’s cross country team. The first change allows freshmen to participate in varsity competition in all sports except football and basketball. This will give the varsity the added depth of the freshman runners in varsity competition. The second rule change involving cross country is the lengthening of the course from four miles to five miles in varsity meets and from two miles to three for frosh meets. The additional mile will make even greater training necessary, Whittle said.

The varsity will be counting heavily on the talents of James and John Puckett, two sophomores coming up from last year’s successful freshman team. The Puckett brothers helped that freshman team to achieve a 10-2 record, one of the best cross country marks at Davidson in recent years. "We expect that John will be the top man on the team this year," commented Martin. "But Jim McLaughlan will be pushing him hard for the team lead." McLaughlan, returning from a junior year in France, is a pleasant addition to the Wildcat harriers. "Jim was in a running club in France. He has been running all year and is in excellent condition," Whittle said.

In addition to the Pucketts and McLaughlan, the team will have Randy Phillips returning. Phillips, a junior, is a strong runner and a team leader, Whittle said. Stag Newman also joins the varsity from last season's frosh. Newman is a hard worker and should add depth to the squad, the coaches added.

Six runners give the freshman team strong hopes for success this season. With the rule change, their ability should also give depth to the varsity attack. Roger Clarke is among the outstanding freshman prospects, Whittle said. He is in good shape and he is a strong distance runner. He will probably run in varsity competition this year, coaches said. Reaves Louthren looks like he will also help the varsity, the coaches said. Rob Hoy, Will Ravenell, and David Shepler are all strong runners who should aid the freshman team. Jimmy Trustle is another freshman runner who may be very valuable to the frosh. He is a real speedster, Martin said, especially in the quarter mile. Whittle and Martin hope that he will be able to adjust to the distance and add strength to the team.

The harriers will run in about eight meets this season. Martin said, "Our schedule will be rough this year, but I certainly think we can have a winning season. In fact, we are looking forward to one of our best years." Both coaches agree that both John Puckett and McLaughlan have a good chance at winning the state championship in cross country. Whittle said that he is quite pleased with the training that most of the runners have been doing. "Overall we are in pretty good shape," he said. "Our prospects are very good."

Martin asks that anyone who is interested in running cross country or track at Davidson should see him or Whittle. He added that even runners with no formal experience are welcome to work out with the cross country team.Group of players, Fogleman said, with 15 from that class reporting for practice. “About 10 or 12 freshmen, who are eligible, and a smattering of sophomores round out the squad,” Fogleman added. “There are still a few lettermen who haven't come out for practice yet.” Fogleman said, although he added that some of these said they plan to return as soon as their schedules are arranged. The first game is with Erskine Oct. 2 here.

Conboy Becomes Cager Assistant

Jerry Conboy, a former high school basketball coach from South Hills Catholic High School in Pittsburgh, Pa., has been appointed assistant basketball coach, succeeding Gale Catlett who resigned last month. He was graduated from Duquesne University in 1951 and became cage coach at South Hills about 12 years ago. Since he became coach there, South Hills has compiled one of the best basketball records of any high school in the country, according to an athletic department spokesman. Catlett, who came to Davidson last season, resigned in August to become assistant coach at the University of Kansas. Catlett, who had been assistant coach at the University of Richmond before coming here, said he believed that his chances for becoming head coach somewhere in the future would be enhanced by leaving the Southern Conference.

Poole, Glidewell Will Pace Wildcat Attack In Football
By DANNY WHITE
Assistant Sports Editor

The Davidson Wildcats, under the direction of Homer Smith who is in his third year at the helm of the ‘Cats, are looking ahead to a great 1967 season as a host of talented sophomores and the passing-duo of Jimmy Poole and Pete Glidewell combine to lead the ‘Cats against nine tough opponents this fall. Poole, who broke four Southern Conference records including the total offense mark when he passed and ran for 1,925 yards in nine games on his way to being named Conference Co-Player of the Year, returns for his third year at quarterback. Glidewell, Poole’s favorite target last season when he caught 58 passes for 629 yards and 6 TDs, returns at right end to make the Davidson offensive machine even more formidable than the one which reeled out an average of 23.2 points per game last year. The Wildcats posted a 4-5 record last season but this year's version of the ‘Cats is conceded by many observers to be the stronger team. However, Coach Smith admits this year’s schedule is much tougher than last year as Davidson must face conference powerhouses such as East Carolina and West Virginia, along with an intersectional foe, Connecticut.

“All the teams we face this season are much improved with the exception of Wofford,” said Smith. “Our toughest games will be West Virginia and East Carolina, which should be the toughest teams in the conference.”

Leading off the ‘Cat schedule will be a conference battle against VMI at 2 p.m. tomorrow in Lexington, Va. The Keydets, under Coach Vito Ragazzo, posted a 2-8 record last fall, but Smith calls this year’s squad “probably the most improved team in the conference.”

“VMI plays a much tougher schedule than we do and they probably rate us as their lightest and most limited opponent,” Smith said. “They feel this is a must game for them - a game they must win.”

Most observers rate tomorrow’s clash as a toss-up with the outcome possibly decided by the performance of the sophomores in the game. Davidson's two-platoon, 22-man squad will feature 10 sophs while VMI will start five. VMI and Davidson are basically the same type football team: one that can move the ball very well but which has problems when it comes to defense, Smith said.

The season will move into its second week next Saturday as Davidson will again be on the road against the Furman Purple Paladins. Coach Bob King's Paladins pulled out a 28-26 squeaker over Davidson last year in Charlotte but finished the season with a 2-7-1 record. The ‘67 Paladins have “The Fly,” Clyde Hewell, back at quarterback and Coach King has been quoted as saying that Hewell is much better than Davidson's Poole. Hewell, who passed for 1,096 yards during the ‘66 campaign, stands 5-11 and weighs 160 pounds.

Davidson returns to Richardson Field on Sept. 30 for a clash with conference powerhouse East Carolina, the first of three straight home games. ECC has 25 returning lettermen from their ‘66 squad, which compiled a 4-5-1 record. The record includes a 40-7 thrashing of Davidson, which tied the all-time series record between the two teams at one victory each.

Following the East Carolina game will be another conference clash against the Richmond Spiders. The Spiders finished 2-6 last year. But this included a 23-17 victory over Davidson. Richmond also leads in the series 14-7-1.

The Wildcats follow Richmond with Homecoming on Oct. 14 when they play host to a strong Presbyterian College team. The Blue Hose took a 49-13 pasting from the Wildcats last season but this year’s game should be much closer, Smith added.

The Wildcats follow the PC game with a road trip to Charleston, S.C., on Oct. 21 to meet The Citadel. Coach Red Parker of the Bulldogs has been quoted as saying the Davidson game will be one of the contests he is eager for this season, after the club’s 21-17 loss on the Wildcats’ Homecoming last fall.

The Wildcats then travel to Storrs, Conn. on Oct. 28 to face the Huskies of the University of Connecticut for their first encounter. The Huskies compiled a 2-6-1 record in 1966 but have 33 lettermen returning from that squad.

The Wildcats have an open date the following week but get back into action Nov. 11 against Wofford here. The Terriers had a 6-3-1 record last year including a 40-28 victory over Davidson. However, Wofford lost 15 valuable lettermen including their quarterback which Smith called the best Davidson played against last year. Davidson leads in the series 22-7-1 and should add to it this year, observers believe.

Davidson closes out the ‘67 season Nov. 18 against the West Virginia Mountaineers at Morgantown, W.Va., which will be the first football game ever between the traditional basketball rivals. The Mountaineers have 22 lettermen returning from their ’66 squad, which posted a 3-5-1 record against tough competition. Leading the Mountaineers will be halfback Garrett Ford who has been tabbed a possible All-American at his tailback position.

The Wildcats will begin the season with 10 sophomores starting on the 22-man first unit. Leading the list of talented sophs is Mike Kelly who will start at both flankerback and defensive end. Other top first yearmen on the defensive unit will be John Zaharov at end and Steve Butler at linebacker. The defensive backfield consists of three sophs including Whit Morrow, Garth Hampton and Glenn Praay. Four sophomores will start on the offensive team, Smith said. In addition to Kelly, soph starters include George Hannen at split end plus a pair of guards, Terry Esterkamp and Dave Thompson.

“I don’t see any problems in playing 10 sophomores,” said Smith. “We know how they can play and our problems aren't there.”
