**Unique Plans Are Made For Junior Speaking Program**

Several New Features Added for Dances on March 23-24

**JOHNNIE LONG TO PLAY**

Masks Will Be Donned as Special Attraction

Junior Speaking will be celebrated in a novel and unusual way this year, when the class of 1935 entertains at a group of dances to be given at the Charlotte Armory on Friday and Saturday, March 23 and 24, and to feature Johnnie Long and his Duke Collegians.

As usual, the entertainment will include a set of three dances, to be formal Friday night, and informal Saturday afternoon and Saturday night. It is in the arrangements for these dances, however, that the several new features will be added. When the doors are opened Friday night, each person as he or she enters will be given a mask. After a few dances to break the ice, an announcement will be made, and at this time everyone will “don the mask.” From this time until the intermission, all dancing will be without the formality of an introduction.

Immediately before the intermission, however, the masquerade will end, as hundreds of balloons, showers of confetti, and ticker tape are rained from the balcony. The dance will also be featured by several junior no-breaks, instead of the usual figure, as well as by no-breaks for the whole group. Last year, students will remember, the present Junior class distinguished itself in the way of originality by the additional presentation of a cabaret arrangement in the school gymnasium.

**Dramatic Society Presents ‘Candida’ To Large Audience**

Bernard Shaw’s Play Well Received by Students and Townspeople

**GORDON WOOD DIRECTS**

Professor Erwin Supervises First Production of Year

The Red and Black Masquers presented George Bernard Shaw's “Candida” last night in Chambers Auditorium. A large number of students and townspeople were in attendance and the play was well received by the audience. The leading roles were taken by Mrs. W. P. Cumming as Candida; D. W. Hollingsworth as Dr. Morell, her husband, and W. F. Goodykoontz, Marchbanks. Other members of the cast were Miss Orrie Steele, Proserpine Garnett; N. H. Wauda, Burgess; and J. H. Simpson, Mr. Mill, the curate.

The story centered around the home of Dr. Morell, who was happily married to Candida, and who was a very successful clergyman, full of himself and believing that his progress in the world was due entirely to his own efforts. He picks up young Marchbanks on the Embankment, and takes him into his home. Marchbanks is in reality a poet, but Morell thinks that

Individual Measurements for the Graduation Robes Are Completed

Seniors to be measured for their caps and gowns, according to John Hunter, chairman of the committee on caps and gowns. The caps and gowns this year will be black, as usual. They will be boxed individually and labeled with each man’s name. All will be shipped to Hunter in order to prevent confusion and delay, and he will distribute them to the seniors. Rental on the caps and gowns this year will be approximately $2.35. Hunter urges that the robes be paid for by the last of March so that the order may be completed in time to assure their arrival on time. Seniors will be given their robes for use between June 1st and 5th, the commencement week. Robes are rented for only one week. The committee, consisting of John Hunter, Joe Drake, and Rawling Pratt-Thomas, urge all seniors who have not already done so, to be measured as soon as possible. As yet only one-half of the senior class have been measured. Wednesday night, March 14, after supper in the parlor of West will be the last opportunity for the remaining members of the Senior class. Wednesday will be the last day for

**Smith And Stutts Win One And Lose Three of Debates**

Debating Team Is Defeated by Sewanee, Centre, and Kentucky

**TEAM TO LEAVE SOON**

Humphrey and Fitzgerald Are to Make Northern Trip

The Davidson debating team, represented by Albert C. Stutts and Robert H. Smith, won one and lost three debates on their Western trip. The team left Davidson on Saturday, March 3, going to Sewanee, Tennessee. On Monday night they debated the University of Sewanee, losing by a judges’ decision. From Sewanee, the team traveled to Lexington, Ky., where on Wednesday night they debated the University of Kentucky, again losing by a judges’ decision. However, a return debate with the same team was secured for the following afternoon, at which time Davidson defeated Kentucky by an audience decision. Friday night Davidson lost a judges’ decision to Centre College in Danville, Ky. The team returned to the campus on Monday.

On Wednesday, March 14, E. J. Humphrey and J. H. Fitzgerald will leave to represent Davidson on the Northern trip. They have scheduled debates with Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Va.; Rutgers University, New Brunswick, N. J.; and Bucknell University in Lewisburg, Pa. The Davidson team will uphold the negative side of the question, “Resolved: That the powers of the President of the United States of America should be substantially increased as a settled policy.” All three debates will be decision debates.

**Senior Class To Ask For Extra Privileges**

Petition to Be Considered atNext Executive Meeting

Believing that senior privileges are "a valuable contribution to the sentiments, traditions, and customs of a college," the members of the Senior class, through the medium of a committee composed of fourteen men, submitted to the executive committee of the faculty last Monday a petition requesting certain privileges for seniors in regard to absences and examinations. This petition, which will probably be considered at the next meeting of the executives, contains the following requests:

"First, that all members of the Senior class be allowed during a semester twice as many absences in any course as there are credit hours per unit in that course; further, that those who have made a general average of B or more since entering Davidson College shall be allowed as many additional absences in any course as there are credit hours per week in the course.

“D” Club Committee of Six Compiles New Athletic Constitution

A recently drawn-up constitution of the “D” Club, Davidson honorary organization composed of men who have earned their varsity “D,” was adopted at a meeting of the club Monday night. This constitution was compiled by four members of the club, Mack Holland, the president; Henry Cathey, E. L. Willson, and C. L. Windham, and by two members of the faculty, Captain Norton G. Pritchett, director of athletics, and Professor Archibald Currie, head of the department of political science. Holland stated that the constitution was drawn up for the purpose of aiding Davidson and its athletic teams by imposing and enforcing certain necessary disciplinary measures on all men participating in athletics. “The club feels that the spirit of any college is exemplified by its athletic team, and we ask the co-operation of the student body in enforcing the rules,” he said. The new constitution follows:

Constitution and By-Laws of the “D” Club

“The D Club has as its primary purpose the fostering of wholesome athletic interests to the end that Davidson College may be served in ways that will contribute to its cordial relationship with other institutions, to a more general student-participation in athletic activities, and to a sense of personal obligation on the part of every member in offering to his fellow students an example of the ideals for which the D Club stands.

“The officers of the D Club, to be elected at a meeting during the latter part of every academic year are: President, vice-president, secretary, and treasurer.

“The president will preside at all regular meetings, when he will exercise the authority and assume the obligations incident to his office. He will call meetings at such times as circumstances may warrant. Announcements as to the exact time and place of meeting will be made by the president, or by someone designated by him, during chapel exercises, and a printed notice of such time and place will be posted in a public place at least twenty-four hours before the appointed time.

“The vice-president will preside in the absence of the president.

“The secretary will record and, at subsequent meetings, read the minutes of the preceding session. All minutes will be kept in a book of such size and permanence as will permit of its continued use for several years.

“The treasurer will be responsible for all club funds and financial records, and he will make such reports as the president may authorize.

“The election of the above four officers shall be made by secret ballot.

Committees

“At the first meeting of every academic year, the president will appoint members to serve on the following committees:

“A.—Entertainment: to be composed of four (4) members, including chairman, whose special duty will be that of meeting and welcoming members of all visiting athletic teams. This committee will see that provision has been made for the comfort of such visitors during their stay on our campus. The personnel of this committee will be changed at the beginning of each season of sport.

“B. Academic: to be composed of three (3) members, including chairman, who will keep in personal touch with freshman teams. The members of this committee will confer with a member of the athletic coaching or administrative staff, to be designated, on such cases as may seem advisable.

“C. Complaint: to be composed of three members, including chairman, who shall consider and bring before the club such complaints of students, faculty, etc., as may touch upon athletic matters.

College Will Exhibit Modern German Art

Collection to Be Displayed in Banquet Hall

A collection of 125 original etchings, woodcuts, and lithographs by modern German artists will be exhibited in the banquet hall of the college for one week beginning March 21. The exhibition is being circulated among colleges and universities throughout the country under the auspices of the Carl Schurz Memorial Foundation, an organization for the promotion of cultural relations between the United States and the German-speaking countries. The exhibition is being sponsored by the German and Art departments of the college.

The exhibit is arranged to show the development of the various modern trends in art during the last fifty years in Germany, and begins with the work of Max Liebermann, born in 1847, and for thirty years president of the Prussian Academy. In this group, which illustrates the impressionistic era, are found works by Lovis Corinth, Max Slevogt, and Hans Meid. In the school of naturalism are shown lithographs by Robert Sterl and Kaethe Kollwitz, with a complete set of her illustrations for “The Weavers,” by Gerhart Hauptmann, “Proletariat” and “Peasants’ Revolt.”

Representing the school of expressionism are Karl Hofer, Max Pechstein, Max Beckman, Kokoschka, Erich Heckel, Ernst Barlach the sculptor, and Emil Nolde. The abstract field is illustrated by compositions by Kadinsky, leader of this movement, Schlemmer, Baumeister, Kampendonck, and Feininger. Conventional and decorative designs, portraits, and landscapes are also included by such well-known artists as Renee Sintenis, Hans Jaeger, von Hoffman, Karl Bauer, Emil Orlik, and Walter Klemm.

The exhibition is free to the public, including friends of the college in adjoining towns and cities. An especial invitation is extended to art lovers of Charlotte. Explanatory talks will be given by a representative of the foundation. The hours of the exhibit and the talks will be announced later. The pictures have recently been shown at High Point and Salem College. A few of them will be taken to Raleigh a day or so for the State Teachers Association meeting.
