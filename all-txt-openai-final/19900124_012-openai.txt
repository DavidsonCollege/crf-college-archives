STRESS, from page 14

Unpercolating bombardment results from the extremely common tendency for students to...do all their work at the last minute. If students choose to procrastinate, that’s fine. But if you don’t do seven weeks' worth of reading until the night before the mid-term, then it isn’t fair for you to blame the professor for throwing too much information at you all at once or for not giving you enough time to mull over the concepts. To get back to the main point, however, I don’t think that having a heavy workload is a nasty, horrible, terrible thing. Learning about ideas, and perhaps more importantly, acquiring the skills that will help us keep learning even after graduation, will be advantages to us for the rest of our lives. And our four years here are certainly the best, if not the only, opportunity we will have for that kind of education.

I don’t even like using the term “heavy workload” because it makes the reading and the study sound like a burden, not an opportunity. It’s so easy to get caught up in the feeling that we are being crushed by it that we often lose sight of how really fascinating a lot of this stuff is. Now, I whine and complain about the workload as much as the rest of us. If anyone quotes any of these smiley, glib sentences I’ve just written back at me while I’m freaking out about a 12-page paper that I don’t have time to finish, I will almost certainly throw something at that person. Nevertheless, deep down in my English-major heart, I believe reading Shakespeare is valuable.

I don’t think stress is necessarily a nasty, horrible, terrible thing, either. I’ve been told that many of the problems at Davidson are a result of stress and I don’t buy it. Many of the problems at Davidson are caused by students handling stress in unhealthy ways. If your method of handling stress is to get completely trashed four nights a week, then of course you're going to have problems. If your nerves turn to banana pudding every time you have an assignment due, then you’re going to have problems, too. Yes, Davidson as an institution should do as much as possible to help students learn to manage stress. But individual students should be confident that we can learn to handle it. Sure, it’s a drag sometimes, but we have to learn to deal with it. Stress isn’t just going to go away. Seventy percent of Davidson’s seniors will go on to some form of graduate school next fall. Do you think law school or med school or divinity school will mean less stress? Do you think parenting two kids will be less stressful than taking five classes a semester?

There’s nothing wrong with venting a few gripes to your roommate about how much you have to do and how little time you have to do it. But if we seriously ask professors to require less of us then we are cheating ourselves of the quality of education we came here for in the first place. I don’t often ask faculty or administrators to ignore student opinions, but in this case, I think the claims that putting eight books on the syllabus will permanently destroy students’ lives should be taken with a large grain of salt. Sometimes when the stress of Davidson is just too much for me, I’ll take a break and do something mindless like polishing my nails. When my nails are painted, I’m glad that I can pick up a book and get back to work.
