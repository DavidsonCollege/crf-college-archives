MR. BASMAJIAN GIVES LECTURE ON “ARMENIA”

Saturday morning, Mr. Basmajian, an Armenian, spoke at the Davidson Graded School. At night he gave an interesting lecture on
“Armenia” in Shearer Hall. Mr. Basmajian is a well-informed speaker and lectured for some time on the history and customs
of Armenia and Constantinople, his native city.

“There are no instruments in the Armenian churches,” Mr. Basmajian says, “but they are great singers. It often requires half
an hour for them to sing five words.” Mr. Basmajian illustrated this by singing the first syllable of one of
their favorite hymns, which took him two minutes. In Constantinople, over fifty languages are spoken, and a man can hardly
run a store unless he has at least a smattering of ten or fifteen different languages. Mr. Basmajian then showed
his interesting collection of oriental costumes and curiosities. After singing a number of songs in his native tongue, he concluded
by playing on over a half-dozen oriental musical instruments.

THE AESCULAPIAN CLUB

The Aesculapian Club has been reorganized and put on a more systematic basis. A new constitution has been adopted and
plans are now under way to make it a “live wire” on the campus. Among the plans of the club
is the fitting up of a club room with the most noteworthy medical books, magazines, pamphlets, the requirements of different
medical colleges, and things of general interest to the members. The meetings are to be semi-monthly. At the last meeting
of the club, Dr. W. S. Hall, dean of the Medical College of Northwestern University; Drs. Martin and Overcash, of
Davidson, were elected honorary members. The club has twenty-five regularly enrolled members now and expects to enroll several new men
at the next meeting, which will be held December 7.

DAVIDSON REPRESENTED AT ATLANTA CONFERENCE

During last week, Dr. Arbuckle and Dr. Martin attended the Association of Southern Colleges and Secondary Schools which met in
Atlanta. While there, Dr. Arbuckle was the guest of Dr. Gaines, president of Agnes Scott. The student body and faculty
of Agnes Scott gave a reception on Thursday night in honor of the association. Both Dr. Arbuckle and Dr. Martin
attended the “Billy Sunday meetings,” and were greatly impressed with America’s greatest living evangelist. On his return, Dr. Martin spent
Sunday in Columbia and spoke to the soldiers at Camp Jackson.

This is a war for every straight-out American, whether our flag be his by birth or by adoption.—Woodrow Wilson.
