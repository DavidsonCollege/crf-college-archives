The women’s tennis team is well on its way to another winning season this year, with a record of 14-5. Despite a tougher schedule than last year’s, the team has won some tough matches.

Surprisingly, after losing two seniors from last year’s top six, the team is doing well. “Our strength on the team as a whole is our depth in good players,” says team member Catherine Smith.

The top six players do have consistent, strong games. The line-up is: 1. Emmy Knobloch; 2. Sue Hilton; 3. Catherine Smith; 4. Adelyn Lutz; 5. Adelaide Wilcox; 6. Joanna Fleming. Tricia Ives is an asset as a partner for number 3 doubles. The team fares well in the individual matches, but the doubles matches present an Achilles heel. Coach Pat Miller tries various partnerships, changing them according to the strength of the opposition.

Monday they suffered a disappointing 5-4 loss at High Point. Knobloch, Smith, and Fleming won their singles and Smith-Wilcox won in doubles. The team cruised to an easy 8-1 win over Winthrop. Almost everyone played well in the singles, and the doubles solidified as well.

The ladies’ next matches are here Monday against Pfeiffer, and Tuesday against hated UNCC. The team will use those two matches as tune-ups for the State Tournament to be held at UNCC April 22-24, and the Lady Wildcats have their eyes on the crown. The toughest competition will come from UNCC, whom they have beaten in the regular season, and East Carolina, whom they can probably take.
