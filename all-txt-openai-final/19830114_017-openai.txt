Record Reviews with Jon Glance

Well, the spudboys from Akron are back, with their fifth album (please tell me it isn’t so!). What can you
say about Devo? Just look at the cover — five vaguely human-headed potatoes with polyethylene collars floating down a road
in middle America while a geek in funny glasses stares primly at you around the corner. The spuds, the collars,
the gimmicks (hats, clothes, buttons, pictures, 3D glasses, and a Devo E-Z listening cassette in a never-ending stream), everything for
the express purpose of spreading the word of Devo, and obscuring the diminishing originality of the music. While their debut
album was really good (with themes like “Jocko Homo” and “Whip It” (which ironically brought Devo fame and fortune and
status as a national joke), this album only brings us one disco smash and few small laughs.

The disco smash is “Peek-a-boo!” and it is catchy and genuinely scary. With lines like “Peek-a-boo/I can see you/And I
know what you do,” the song walks the line between cliché and nonsense before moving to the point: “Laugh if
you want to or say you don’t care/If you cannot see it you think it’s not there/It doesn’t work that
way.” From the constrictive opening to the horrific laugh over the bouncing groove, the song is a concise nonpop statement
of what's bubbling under reality in Akron. The other amusing cut on the LP is “Speed Racer,” from the cartoon
of the same name (remember the Japanese show with Spridel, Chim-Chim, Trixie, Speed, and Pops Racer?), in which four cardboard
characters stand around exclaiming their limited personality trait(s). There’s Speed Racer, who drives real fast; a Big Pirate who likes
to steal and kill; a Barbie Doll who’s got brains and likes sex; and a Doctor who delivers your bill.
This song is more interesting for its inexorable beat and caricature of life as a cartoon than for any musical
merit, though.

The rest of the LP is a mixed bag of disco schtick and pseudoprofundities. The scary thing is that now
that the novelty has worn off, Devo has revealed itself as actually being serious about all of this. While it
was kind of cute to think about five costumed spuds from Ohio playing rock star, it is appalling to think
of anyone actually living like this. It’s like finding out the class clown is a psycho — even people on
the edge don’t want to associate with people who have fallen over it. Devo Incorporated will continue to grow and
sell gimmicks, and the records will continue to be sold and played, but the unanswered question is: what are we
encouraging?

Camp Thunderbird

Excellent summer counseling opportunities for men and women who are interested in serving boys and girls ages 7-16, guiding them
in their physical, mental and spiritual development. Only those persons who will dedicate their wholehearted efforts to helping each individual
child develop his or her potential should apply. One must have the ability to teach in one or more of
our specialized activities. College students, teachers, and coaches should apply.

CAMP THUNDERBIRD, located 17 miles southeast of Charlotte, N.C., is an ACA accredited camp member, specializing in water sports (sailing,
water skiing, swimming, and canoeing), yet an added emphasis is placed on the land sports (general athletics, tennis, golf, archery,
riflery, and backpacking).

Horseback riding, white-water canoeing, and tripping are extras in our excellent program.
