King Sees No Possibility Of Revolt In South Africa

“Oh definitely, it’s the case of the irresistible force meeting an immovable object,” quipped the Briton as he described the
socio-political condition in the Union of South Africa. The “irresistible force” there is black nationalism; the “immovable object,” the Afrikaner's
militant white supremacy. Stewart King, Great Issues speaker, was no longer speaking from prepared notes on the political and economic
theories of apartheid; he was expounding, from his own observations, the facts of life in South Africa.

King, a native of Sunderland, England, was reporting for the Johannesburg Star in 1960 and covered the anti-government riots in
Sharpeville in March of that year. When King was in Africa in 1951, the mode of protest to white superiority
was passive resistance. By 1960, however, the frustration of a suppressed people had erupted in the atrocities of the Sharpeville
riots in which people killed unarmed Bantu natives in the streets; the natives gained vengeance by burning to death a
Catholic nun.

At present there are but two choices for the future of South Africa, according to King: Either the Bantus and
coloreds will rise in force against the white population—which is outnumbered 10 to three—or the official policy of apartheid, complete
segregation, will remain indefinitely. The British reporter discards the former possibility. The problem, as King sees it, is basically one
of education. “The Bantus need a framework of government among themselves to prepare for the task of administering a country.
To perfect administrative ability, they need education. The South African government deliberately suppresses education of Bantus.”

The reporter believes that the white government will maintain the status quo—complete separation—at all costs. At the same time, the
Dutch-descended Afrikaners have recently given the Bantus abundant economic help: The best hospitals and high-rise apartments in South Africa are
rapidly becoming “Bantu only.” There is abundant aid in other than economic goods from other than African sources. “Time and
again I’ve seen them go in...” asserted King, nervously crimping his cigarette filter. “Who?” we asked. “The communists,” he replied.
“There’s fierce competition between Russia and China, not only to sell communism, but to sell a particular slant of ideology.
I’ve seen Russian agricultural assistance groups arrive in a village one morning, and a Chinese delegation arrive that afternoon. The
factions never so much as spoke to each other.”

King says the two brands of communism compete for men’s minds almost as vehemently as the black nationalist leaders. The
reporter admonished us not to attempt comparing South Africa’s racial problem with that in the United States for several reasons.
For one, the U.S. has few major cities whose population approaches a black majority. In South Africa, the white man
is outnumbered many times over. “Equal franchise would ruin the white man,” says King.

The Briton, who writes for the Charleston News and Courier, says he has no plans whatsoever for returning to Africa.

tion against us, but we will practice civil disobedience. “If they stop us in Miami, then members of our walk
not jailed will go to Mexico City and fly to Havana from there.” Little said that if any of the
walkers were arrested in Miami, there would be an interesting court fight. “There is no law that states a citizen
cannot go to Cuba, only a State Department ruling. It might prove very embarrassing to Uncle Sam to try us
when we have broken no law. If they get a conviction, it would constitute an invasion of privacy.”

Meister confessed his mind is haunted by the ghost of the unknown. “It’s the first time I’ve ever been out
of New England,” he said. “I guess you can say I’m the conservative of the group; I am not now
planning to go all the way to Cuba.”

his cause. For three years he has been working for CNVA for room, board and a dollar a week. Particular
attention could be given to contrasting the freshman class, in their first exposure to studying the Bible (generally speaking), with
the seniors whose doubts have had time to digest a year or so before taking additional religion courses. Recent and
older alumni could also be polled. If this would constitute an invasion of privacy the results could be withheld from
publication by the administration and religion department and YMCA, all of whom have a perhaps more legitimate interest than the
rest of us in the consequences of Davidson’s religious practices and instruction. In any case the questionnaire is available on
reserve in the library, and the YMCA or the Knovel Knook could perhaps be persuaded to purchase copies for anyone
interested in examining his own religious and political beliefs in a “percentile” way.

“Frankly, I’m scared to death,” confessed Davidov. And he was not answering any question. “Fear is one thing I must
fight constantly, and it’s getting worse every day as I move south. We do not know what we will run
into down here. None of us knows but what some of us may never get home,” Davidov revealed, but “I
must admit we have received as warm a welcome in the South as we did in the North.”

Carlos Montoya First In '63 Artist Series

Carlos Montoya, Flamenco guitarist, will open the 1963-64 Davidson College Artist Series with a concert at 8 p.m. in Chambers
Auditorium next Friday, Oct. 25, before Homecoming weekend.

Born in Madrid the son of Spanish gypsies, Montoya began playing the guitar at the age of eight. Early in
his career he won recognition while accompanying such dancers as La Argentina, Vicente Escudero and Argentinita. His concerts have been
heard around the globe, and his recordings on RCA Victor have had great success, according to reports. His techniques are
characterized by a flair for inventive innovation in his arrangements. It has been said of Montoya that he and his
music are inseparable—that he does not perform it, he lives it.

The concert, sponsored by the Artist Series committee, will begin at 8 p.m. Tickets are on sale to the general
public for $2.00. No admission will be charged Davidson students.

The remainder of the Artist Series calendar, announced by Dr. Donald B. Plott, chairman, will include Celeste Holm, the actress
from “With Love and Laughter” who will be at Davidson on Nov. 20. On March 4 the Gregg Smith Singers
will present the concert program. This will be the first time in our country’s history such a thing has happened.
But for all their ideals and assurance, there is a ghost stalking each marcher. All have fear-ridden minds.

“Frankly, I’m seared to death,” Davidov. And he was not answering any question. “Fear is one thing I must fight
constantly, and it’s getting worse every day as I move south. We do not know what we will run into

member unless he specifically declines when he becomes a candidate.

John Barrow, keeper of the gun room, disclosed some misunderstandings among the student body concerning the gun room and its
use. He suggested some regulations which would make for stricter control. Among these would be: (1) all boys are required
to purchase padlocks for the individual gun cabinets, (2) no one is to take another's gun out without the permission
of the owner, (3) everyone with a key is responsible for keeping the gun room locked. These proposals were only
suggestions, as there was some discussion of a list of regulations in the past which may have covered these points.
A check was to be made on this and a decision on regulations concerning the gun room will come at
a later date.

A call was made for a joint meeting with the Honor Court to discuss and interpret terms in the Student
Constitution. In the past, the Honor Court has assumed the power to interpret terms, and it was revealed that the
Honor Court has not been sanctioned the authority to judge on matters of this nature. The Student Council does, however,
have the right to interpret terms as they wish.

Tommy Stafford announced that events had been outlined for Freshman Parents Day and then went on to discuss the freshman-sophomore
basketball game next Wednesday night and freshman-sophomore Field Day on Thursday afternoon. The two events may determine whether or not
freshmen must continue to wear beanies.

In defending the National Student Association from its various attacks, President John Spratt said the Student Council would show by
deeds rather than words that NSA was a worthwhile program. Will Jackson announced some new proposals in the nomination and
election system at Davidson. Among the various improvements, Jackson listed a common ballot, a requirement that no one could run
for a student government office as well as an academic office, and that candidates for office would have to file
for a position rather than be nominated. Jackson remarked that these changes would streamline the election process and make it
more efficient.

Paul Simpson, Department of Religion, stated that Davidson’s department of religion is one of the strongest departments in the college.
It seeks to stimulate students in the development of a more mature Christian faith. President D. Grier Martin responded to
questions concerning the Oct. 8 issue of the National Review, which reported on a survey of 70 Davidson students, finding
that 56 percent reacted partially or wholly against their religious tradition while in college and that 78 percent of those,
or 18 in all, reported that required religious courses and chapel services were responsible for the change. Martin emphasized that
Davidson’s alumni record is the best indicator of the success of its Christian educational philosophy. An independent survey has shown
that one-half of the Presbyterian ministers in North Carolina and one-fourth of those in the Presbyterian Church, U.S., are Davidson
graduates. A recent national foundation survey placed Davidson 25th in the percentage of its graduates studying in seminaries and indicated
that seminaries were enthusiastic about the preparation of the students in Bible and religion. Finally, a survey made last year
of the Davidson class of 1937 is most revealing: only two members of the class out of 110 reporting are
not church members; 64 out of 110 have served as church officers; they voted 80 to 23 in favor of
compulsory religious services. And it is interesting that the Davidson atmosphere, professors, Bible courses, and chapel services were given approximately
equal credit for shaping religious outlook, Martin pointed out.

“Barefoot Boy With Cheek”

BOOM!

Today, foregoing levity, let us turn our keen young minds to the principal problem facing American colleges today: the population
explosion. Only last week four people exploded in Cleveland, Ohio—one of them while carrying a plate of soup. In case
you're thinking such a thing couldn't happen anywhere but in Cleveland, let me tell you about two other cases last
week—a 45-year-old man in Provo, Utah, and a 17-year-old girl in Northfield, Minnesota. And, in addition, there was a near
miss in High Point, North Carolina—an eight-year-old boy who was saved only by the quick thinking of his cat, Fred,
who pushed the phone off the hook with his muzzle and dialed the department of weights and measures. (It would,
perhaps, have been more logical for Fred to dial the fire department, but one can hardly expect a cat to
summon a fire engine which is followed by a Dalmatian, can one?)

But I digress. The population explosion, I say, is upon us. It is, of course, cause for concern but not
for alarm, because I feel sure that science will ultimately find an answer. After all, has not science in recent
years brought us such marvels as the maser, the bevatron, and the Marlboro filter? Oh, what a saga of science
was the discovery of the Marlboro filter! Oh, what a heart-rending epic of trial and error, of dedication and perseverance!
And, in the end, what a triumph it was when the Marlboro research team, after years of testing and discarding
one filter material after another—iron, nickel, tin, antimony, obsidian, pound cake—finally emerged, tired but happy, from their laboratory, carrying in
their hands the perfect filter cigarette! Indeed, what rejoicing there still is whenever we light up a Marlboro which comes
to us in soft pack and Flip-Top Box in all fifty states and Cleveland!

Yes, science will ultimately solve the problems arising from the population explosion, but meanwhile America’s colleges are in dire straits.
Where can we find classrooms and teachers for today’s gigantic influx of students? Well sir, some say the solution is
to adopt the trimester system. This system, already in use at many colleges, eliminates summer vacations, has three semesters per
annum instead of two, and compresses a four-year course into three years. This is, of course, good, but is it
good enough? Even under the trimester system the student has occasional days off. Moreover, his nights are utterly wasted in
sleeping. Is this the kind of all-out attack that is indicated? I say no. I say desperate situations call for
desperate remedies. I say that partial measures will not solve this crisis. I say we must do no less than
go to school every single day of the year. But that is not all. I say we must go to
school 24 hours of every day! The benefits of such a program are, as you can see, obvious. First of
all, the classroom shortage will disappear because all the dormitories can be converted into classrooms. Second, the teacher shortage will
disappear because all the night watchmen can be put to work teaching solid state physics and Restoration drama. And finally,
overcrowding will disappear because everybody will quit school. Any further questions?

Yes, one further question: the makers of Marlboro, who sponsor this column, would like to know whether you have tried
a Marlboro lately. It’s the filter cigarette with a man’s world of flavor. Settle back and enjoy one soon.
