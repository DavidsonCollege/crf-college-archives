USC Wins Regatta; Wildcats Take Third

The Davidson sailing team finished a very close third in its own invitational regatta last Saturday at the lake campus.
Finishing only one point behind second-place Citadel and two points behind first place South Carolina, Davidson's 59 points were far
ahead of the remainder of the seven school fleet. Tad Lowdermilk was Davidson’s high point skipper for the afternoon with
22 points. Team captain Tom Kirtley and Jim Lee had 14 points each, while freshman Lewis Riley picked up nine.
One of the reasons for the good showing of the Davidson team was its ability to keep from fouling out
of any of the races while fouling out several other boats. Every team member participated in at least one race,
as four different skippers raced. Although this may hurt the team's chances of winning the regatta, it gave valuable experience
to an inexperienced team. The team chose its officers for next year early this week. Three rising sophomores took the
offices, as John Moore was elected captain, with Roger Powell and Lewis Riley being elected secretary and treasurer. The next
regatta facing the team is the South Atlantic Intercollegiate Sailing Association finals, to be held next weekend in Charleston.

Davidson Gains Ohio Gridders

Davidson football picked up two sizeable additions to its freshman roster for next season, as two Ohio high school stars
signed grid grants-in-aid this week. Frank McLaughlin, a tackle from Oregon, Ohio, and an end from Mansfield, Jim Ellison, both
signed early this week.

53 Report For Spring Workouts

Spring football practice began in the mud yesterday as 53 gridders put on the pads for reconditioning. The coaching staff,
under Head Coach Homer Smith, is faced with a difficult task this spring, due to the unexpected departure of Assistant
Coach Warner Alford, who left the staff to assume a similar position at Georgia Tech. The team will work on
various weak areas in hopes of building a strong squad for next season. The practice, which will continue until May
15, will be climaxed by an intra-squad game on May 11. Smith said that the practice will concentrate specifically on
two areas. The big task will be the development of a novice offensive line, which will find junior center Sandy
Brenneman as the only returnee. Lindsey Bishop, a starter last year at offensive guard, will not see action this year
due to injuries sustained in the West Virginia game. Hank Strickland, another interior lineman, will also be missing from the
Wildcat lineup. Strickland plans to skip his senior year at Davidson to go on to dental school. The other concentrated
effort will be placed on working in sophomore quarterback Gordon Slade as a replacement for Jimmy Poole.

Goodbye, West Virginia

West Virginia called it quits last week. Maybe the Southern Conference basketball tournament loss to Davidson had something to do
with it but it wasn’t mentioned at Morgantown in a statement to the press. The school decided they were not
happy with the conference and dropped out to become an independent. Reasons such as “We are too far away from
the other conference schools to travel economically,” and “We want to expand our athletic programs more nationally,” were stated, but
the real reason could be that West Virginia University was tired of being associated with the name, the Southern Conference.
For a certain number of years, the SC has been looked down upon by the larger school leagues, such as
the Atlantic Coast Conference and the Southeastern Conference. This prejudice has certain legitimate grounds, because most of the SC schools
are small and cannot support a “high power” subsidized athletic program in all sports. But trying to keep from sounding
like a “Blue Sky report” on athletics, many of the SC schools besides Davidson have had nationally known athletic teams
without subsidization. It appears WVU wants a chance to choose which small SC schools to play. The SC scheduling rules
if nothing else seem to be the real thorn WVU wanted to remove. More than basketball, the WVU football program
wanted to have a wider choice in scheduling opponents. In the past a certain number of their football games had
to be with SC teams to make them eligible for the league title. Now they can “move on to bigger
and better things” or so they say. It will be interesting to see how their season record turns out against
the “big league.” I’m sure after the last basketball season, they don’t consider Davidson “bush league.” Lefty said it really
didn’t make that much difference to him either way. “West Virginia will get a better chance at the national tournament
by being an independent. They won't have to go through our tough 3-day tournament,” he said. With Ron Williams graduating,
the Mountaineers would have a hard time beating many of the SC basketball teams beside Davidson next year. Football at
WVU isn’t that much better than the rest of the league if this was the reason for their pulling out.
The growing football programs of most of the SC schools besides the established strength of East Carolina has and would
not make an easy schedule for WVU. The more you study the matter, it is hard to determine whether WVU
athletics are moving on to “bigger things” or just “chickening out” by choosing weak teams in other conferences. This is
what the Houston basketball team did to a certain extent this last season. Possibly minor sports at WVU will improve
with added teams from other conferences on their respective schedules. The Mountaineers sure won't miss the Davidson baseball team as
any great power they should play to gain prestige in the national picture. They will be able to schedule better
track, swimming, and soccer teams outside of the conference if they plan to expand these programs, but wrestling and especially
tennis is another matter. Like Davidson, most of the SC schools produce fine wrestling and tennis teams. Probably, WVU wants
only to play the best the SC has to offer in these sports instead of all the league teams. Well,
probably WVU will find better competition among certain large schools, and maybe their athletic programs will improve because of this,
but I don't think their newly acquired status as an independent will bring them any athletic prestige they could not
have earned in the Southern Conference. The conference will miss the WVU Mountaineer teams as strong competitors, but I know
most SC fans won't lose any sleep over their departure. In fact, one Davidson student’s reaction sums it up. “Good
riddance.” Now, at least George Washington can make the SC basketball tournament next year no matter what their record.completed their
drills for this spring, while most will be completed early next month. The Davidson starting and concluding dates are later
than the rest of the Southern Conference teams’ dates. McLaughlin is one of the biggest boys to sign with Davidson.
At 6-3, 230 pounds, he will play offensive tackle. Assistant Coach Warner Alford, who recruited both boys, said that he
“has the size and speed which we are looking for in an interior lineman.” Ellison is a 6-foot, 190-pound offensive
end, who comes from what Alford describes as an “outstanding football program.” Alford said, “We are thrilled to have two
more boys from this area. The athletes from Ohio have contributed tremendously to Wildcat football.”

Alford Quits Grid Post; Tech Acquires Cat Coach

WARNER ALFORD Leads Cindermen As Top Davidson Sprinter

By DOUG HAYNES Sports Writer

Rick Lyon appears to be one of those few individuals who has the sort of dedication necessary to participate in
both varsity track and spring football practice and to do both successfully. A freshman from Wheaton, Ill., Lyon has been
a consistent winner this spring in his events, the 100 and 220-yard dashes. At 5-10, 170 pounds, Lyon has the
impressive build of a sprinter, and sprint he does. He has been defeated only once in dual meets this season.
Just prior to spring break, he turned in his most impressive performance at the News Piedmont Relays in Greenville, S.C.
Running against entries from over 30 colleges and universities, he finished fourth with a clocking of 9.5.

Lyon said that he has been quite pleased with his performances this spring. “I’m running faster than I did last
year,” he said. “I finished second in the Illinois state meet last year with a 9.6, but I was also
very inconsistent all season.” “This year I've settled down,” he said, “and I can now consistently run 9.8 or 9.9.”
Rick seems to prefer the 220 to the 100-yard dash, due to “a little trouble on the starts in the
100.” His best clocking in the 220 this year has been a 22.1.

When not burning up the cinders, Rick finds himself earning his football scholarship at flanker and defensive halfback on Coach
Homer Smith's squad. Rick noted that spreading himself out between football and track keeps him from his best performance in
track, but added, “I like both sports a lot. One sport is completely individual while the other is a team
sport.” “I'm happy at whichever one I'm doing at the time,” he said. “Perhaps football will keep me from reaching
what I could otherwise in track, but you just can’t train completely for two sports.” His goal for this track
season is a good finish in the Southern Conference meet next month in Fort Eustis, Va. He added, however, that
he was not in “good enough shape yet.” Wonder what his defeated opponents would say to that.

Assistant Football Coach Warner Alford, who came to Davidson last year as a defensive specialist, has resigned his position here
to assume a similar job at Georgia Tech. Alford will take a position as defensive assistant and recruiter for the
Yellow Jackets. He based his decision on the financial offer from Tech, which he described as “just too good to
pass up.” Head Football Coach Homer Smith said this week that Alford’s decision came as “a shock and surprise, especially
since spring football practice starts this week.” Smith praised Alford's work with the Wildcat defensive unit this past year, commenting
that the former University of Mississippi star was “a rare find for Davidson.” Smith plans to place Assistant Coach Dave
Fagg, offensive line coach this year, in the position left vacant by Alford. He said that this move was to
ensure that the Wildcat defensive progress was not hindered. Several men are under consideration for the vacated post, according to
Smith, but no replacement has been found.

Watch out for the other guy! Sue's a good driver. And that's the trouble. You've come to trust her over
the years ... but really, you can’t. Because even the best drivers end up in some of the worst accidents.
Drive defensively, and you won't end up on the receiving end of some other driver's mistake or sudden move. At
intersections, never assume the right-of-way. Make defensive driving pay off by practicing it every second of every minute you're behind
the wheel. It takes extra effort—but that extra effort's worth it. The forty-nine thousand people who died on our highways
last year would be the first to agree. If they could.
