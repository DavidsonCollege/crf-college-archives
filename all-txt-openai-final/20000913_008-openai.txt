**Cross Country Going High**

Despite the challenge of a hilly course and the chaos created by the hordes of hysterical screaming fans, the Davidson
cross-country team improved on last week’s performance to finish third out of a highly esteemed field of five teams.

Leading the way for the men was Jimmy Swansbrough ‘03 (27:53) followed closely by Andrew Schoewe ’03 (28:05), Chris Schmader
’04 (28:07), Colby Broadwater ’04 (28:11), and Dave Bunge ’04 (28:33).

The Davidson freshmen are stepping up as the major contributing force driving this young team. Charlie Blankenship, a sixty-year-old local
hairdresser, was quoted as saying, “These young boys are really exciting.”

The Davidson women’s team also improved on last week’s performance, finishing second out of six teams. The women’s XC team
stunned the thousands of screaming fans lining the course with their superior skills as Smyth Bitter ‘01 finished fifth overall,
running 20:02. She was supported by Colleen Faes ’04 (20:35), Jenna Kruppa ’04 (21:13), Brooke Kittinger ’03 (21:28), and Liz
Gross ’03 (21:37).

With their first five runners in the top twenty overall, the women’s team made it perfectly clear that they will
be the team to watch in the Southern Conference this year.

Both teams will be running their next race at McAlpine Park in Charlotte on September 22.

Davidson alumnus runner Steve “Snake” Johnston colorfully summed up the home invitational. “I missed the hills like a snake misses
a shotgun blast to the head, but these freshman men and women really look like they can and will carry
Davidson running to a new level.”

**Davidson Men’s Soccer Plays “Gift of Life” Game**

This Friday evening at 8:00 in Richardson Stadium, Davidson men’s soccer will square off against Virginia Tech in what will,
undoubtedly, be a hard-fought match. But, for this year’s team, the game means much more. Davidson has decided to dedicate
the proceeds from the home opening match to benefit the Rotary “Gift of Life.”

Since the project was started 12 years ago, “Gift of Life” has saved the lives of over 60 impoverished children
around the world, providing emergency heart surgeries to children who otherwise would not survive.

“I think it’s a wonderful charity,” said men’s soccer coach Charlie Slagle. “We’re really excited about the opportunity this match
presents to benefit a great cause and provide some great soccer to our fans. Hopefully, the community will come out
and support this worthwhile charity event and we hope that, through our ticket sales, we'll be able to fund an
operation for a needy child.”

Though the project has tremendous support from the Rotary Club and the medical community, such operations still have expenses, each
one costing approximately $7,500. Davidson hopes to raise money to cover some of these expenses and help save the life
of a needy child.

Student and faculty admission to the game will remain free, however, both are encouraged to bring money to donate to
this worthy cause.

**Field Hockey Tops Sacred Heart**

The mounting tension of a four-game losing streak melted away on Sunday, as Davidson earned its first home win of
the season, rolling past Sacred Heart 3-0.

“Thank heavens,” said an elated head coach Jen Halliday. “It was a long time coming.”

Almost the entirety of the contest was waged deep inside Sacred Heart defensive territory, with Davidson earning 26 corners and
out-shooting the Pioneers 27-3.

Senior Lea Jaeger struck first, converting an assist from Agnes Bateman to give Davidson a 1-0 lead. Jennie Gold and
Kathryn Clark also tallied goals for the Wildcats. Clark’s tip-in with 29:22 to play marked the first career goal for
the freshman from La Jolla, Calif.

“We finally solved our scoring issues,” smiled Halliday, whose squad had squandered an abundance of scoring opportunities in recent losses.

A major contributing factor to Sunday’s victory was the play of senior co-captain Ashley Hart. “Ashley had a great game
today,” Halliday said. “She really was on top of her game. She was a corner-drawing woman.”

With the victory, Davidson improves to 2-4. “I don’t think our record reflects the caliber of our team at all,”
said goalie Amanda Mordavsky, who notched her third career shut-out on Sunday. “Look at how many games we’ve lost by
one goal.”

All eighteen active position-players saw action on Sunday. “I saw some great things when we subbed people in,” said Halliday.
“People weren’t settled to simply play, they went in determined to play well.” Jaeger agreed. “It was great to see
everyone out there. They were all excited and each played so well. It was a really good feeling when everyone
was clicking together.”

Perhaps the most telling image of Sunday’s action was the triple-toned hairdo sported by Mordavsky. “I think we’re starting to
develop attitude, and that’s the difference,” explained the junior goaltender. “And that’s why my hair is flaming orange.”

Davidson treks to Winston-Salem on Sunday for perhaps its biggest challenge of the season. “Wake is a top-ten team, probably
a top-five team,” said Halliday. “We’re going to try a couple of different things out.”

Davidson then travels to Catawba before resuming NorPac conference play on September 23 by hosting Appalachian State.
