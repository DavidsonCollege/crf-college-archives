GREATER DAVIDSONIAN

Vol. VII. DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N. C., MARCH 25, 1920. No. 25

SOPHOMORES SOON TO MAKE MERRY AT BANQUET

The Sophomores Banquet to be held on the fifth day of April will far outshine any similar function that has
ever been held in this section of the country. As the Packards and Pierce Arrows carry away their loads of
human freight on that long-looked-for day, many will be heard to murmur, “I wish I was a Sophomore.” The banquet
will be held in the dining room of the Selwyn Hotel in Charlotte, and according to reports from Manager Gilchrist,
it will be a time that no Sophomore should miss.

Reno Entertaining Large Audience in Great Style

Students and Town People Enjoy Marvelous and Mystifying Performance of Master Magician

The world is outdone—all the mysteries of the Pyramids, the wisdom of Athens, the cryptic knowledge of the Key to
All Dark Things, the Occult Sciences of India—these all have been surpassed. The fanciful dreams of the Mediaeval alchemist have
been far exceeded by the actual wonders of Reno the magician. Midas’ golden touch enabled him to convert anything that
he touched into gold; but how much more wonderful to be able to make a dove out of thin air!

On Saturday night this wonderful man did his wonders wondrously for the benefit of the assembled youth of this burg
(the older persons came to explain to the children). The result, as was to be expected, was a wondering bunch
of goo-goo-eyed lads strolling to their rooms, watching to be quite sure they didn’t fail to gather any goldmines that
might have grown, mushroom-like, under the stimulus of the taint of mystery that was in the very air.

The members of the golf club watched in stupefied amazement the multiplying at the hands of this super-necromancer of the
balls used in their favorite sport, reflecting upon the possibilities in an economic way of the said multiplication. John D.
McConnell, when called upon to assist in the performance, did so with distinction, having been threatened with condemnation to spend
six months in a pie factory with a muzzle on if he failed. By request, the ring trick was repeated
just as had been performed on the preceding night in the Princess Theatre in Mount Mourn, when many of the
students had seen it (this is the newest and finest of the many beautiful play-houses of that metropolis, having recently
been erected at a cost of one million shekels by the Union Cost Company of Cornelius). As have said many
other scribes in describing other social functions more exclusive (adv. price up to $5). A good time was had by
all.

A Better Davidson is Our Goal.

GENTLEMEN, BEWARE!

The spring tournament will soon begin and it is important that the two tennis courts in the rear of Chambers
be kept in as good condition as possible. Please do not play on them without some type of rubber-soled shoes.

Results of Million-Dollar Greater Davidson Club Campaign to be Seen At Once

Laundry, Enlarged Heating Plant, and Dining Hall to Be Ready Next Fall—Plans for New Dormitory Are Made

As the students of Davidson are well aware, the pledges made in the recent campaign are payable in four annual
installments, and accordingly, the progress that the college will be able to make in increasing its buildings and equipment will
depend largely upon the promptness with which these pledges are paid. The authorities, however, have already been at work, and
several good things are promised us for the immediate future.

Probably the first new building to be erected is the College Laundry. The contract for this building has been let,
the machinery has been purchased, and the Laundry will be open for the coming September. It is to be located
in the rear of the Georgia dormitory, in accordance with the plans for the development of grounds decided on several
years ago. The building will be thirty by sixty feet, one story high, roof covered with composition shingles, and cement
floor.

A new and greatly enlarged heating plant is to be provided by next fall. Its capacity will be sufficient to
supply the Chemical Laboratory as soon as it is possible for the college to fit these buildings for steam heat.

Plans are now being developed to enlarge the dining hall of the Shumaker house to such proportions as will accommodate
approximately two hundred students. The College proposes to conduct a Commons there, and to set a good table at the
minimum price. Detailed arrangements have not yet been made, and further announcements will be given later.

As soon as the funds are available, a dormitory with a capacity of one hundred men will be built in
accordance with the plans drawn by (Continued on page 3)

Merits--- A Crowded School Attests Its Efficiency

Has Been Important Factor in the Great Success of This Session—Must Now Turn Its Attention to the Work of Making
a Better Davidson

Has Now Been in Operation a Year.

About this time last year, the suggestion was made that an organization be perfected that would embrace the student body
and alumni and have as its object the good of the college both as to quality and quantity if we
may express it that way. There was only one man on the road this vacation for the college when heretofore
there have generally been four. He frequently wrote to the office, “Everywhere I go I hear of and see the
results of the Greater Davidson Club.” All of youHere is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

Are familiar with the result of, way. Plans soon followed our first offensive; how we passed the original idea and
before the spring beyond the objective with room and term was over the Greater Davidson to spare. If you will
drop in and ask Mr. Jackson about the registration this year you will find that it is over 450; he
is the only person who knows exactly, because we are still getting new men. Briefly this is what we have
done, but the end is not yet. With a year’s experience behind us let us consolidate our position and then
press on for further conquests. However, we want to endeavor to get better as we grow bigger for it would
be better to be small than to grow big and not better.

TWO THINGS MUST BE DONE TO SECURE OUR GOAL

The motto of the Greater Davidson Club is “A Bigger and a Better Davidson.” Until the new dormitory is erected
it is out of the question to consider how Davidson may be made bigger, so the Club must concern itself
now with only the one issue: “How may Davidson be made better?”

Several months ago a certain prominent gentleman made a statement, of which this is the substance: “There are two institutions
outstanding for their spirit, Yale, and Davidson.” That is putting us in a pretty high class, and we admit that
the spirit is good—but it ought to be better. There seems to be an intangible something circulating sub- (Continued on

Greater Davidson Banquet and Rally to be Held Tonight

Old-Time Pep to Mark Get-Together Feed in Gymnasium—Prominent Alumni Speakers to be Present

Seven o'clock on March 25! At that hour 450 men will fall to at the biggest banquet held at Davidson
for many years. For that is the date of the Greater Davidson Banquet in the gymnasium, arrangements for which are
well under way. Perhaps one of the things that the Davidson student body needs now that it has become larger
is a greater spirit of fellowship between the individuals that make up the student body. Every fellow should feel that
he is one of the fellows that is helping to make old Davidson measure up to her regular standing of
Christian fellowship and democracy. The only way to make college life what it should be is to get every fellow
to agree to some definite policy. If each fellow thinks that a plan is worthwhile then each fellow will do
his part to support this plan. The purpose of the banquet is to discuss the plans for next year, and
boost the different branches of college activities.

There will be several short and interesting talks from some prominent alumni, among which will probably be talks by W.
M. Fetzer, C. L. Wilcox, W. S. Golden, and R. W. Miles. Those particularly interested in the Greater club hope
that this banquet will be the inauguration of an annual affair. The social side of the banquet should be one
of the most important features. It is expected that all the students will get together and have a good time,
strengthening the bond which makes every Davidsonian proud of his alma mater. Come tonight with plenty of the old Davidson
“pep” and the expectation of having a rare treat, for no one will be disappointed.

Maj. William Lee Davidson has been re-elected commander of the Chester post of the American Legion.

A Better Davidson is Our Goal.
