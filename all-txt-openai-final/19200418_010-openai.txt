three chances in the field without an error.

The scoring was as follows: In the third Cassell, E., drew a pass and went to second on an error.
Poe struck out, but Crawford slammed the pill against the center field fence for a triple, scoring Cassell. Crawford scored
the next moment when Ratchford laid down a perfect bunt on a squeeze play. In the sixth Poe doubled to
left and advanced to third on Crawford’s sacrifice. Ratchford again came across with a perfect bunt and Poe scored. The
lucky seventh produced four tallies for the Wildcats. Cassell, E., drew a pass and stole second. Poe also walked. At
this juncture the two pulled a double steal. Crawford’s single scored Cassell and advanced Poe to third. Ratchford struck out,
but on another squeeze play begun by Cassell, F., Poe scored and Crawford moved up to third, from where he
scored on a passed ball. Cassell, F., stole second and third and also scored when Peeler let one of Festerman’s
benders get through him. The last Red and Black score came in the eighth when with one down McArn doubled
to center, went to third on a passed ball and scored when Cassell, E., laid down a perfect sacrifice.
