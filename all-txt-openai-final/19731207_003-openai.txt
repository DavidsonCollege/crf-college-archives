Three Four Compete In Presidential Race
By MARK DEATON
Managing Editor

Four candidates, Blain Butner, Jim Goodloe, Vince Rabil, and John Scholer are contending for the office of SGA president in
the upcoming Tuesday elections.

Butner has served in the SGA Senate for two years as a class senator, has been on the Senate Executive
Committee two years, and has served as a member of the Trustee Governance Committee, chairman of the SGA Educational Affairs
Committee, and chairman of the Finance Committee.

“The Senate exists primarily to better the lives of students in some way,” said Butner. “The role of the SGA
president is to direct the Senate as an integral and vocal body within the campus governance structure as a whole.”

“The most pervading issue facing the '73-'74 Senate will be the culmination of the governance issue,” he said. “Any betterment
in governance depends on developing greater trust between students, faculty members, and administrators.”

Butner has made several recommendations to ensure that the Senate will be a work force for students. “We need to
tighten up with individual senators,” he said. “We need senators who are constantly working with definite goals in mind, senators
who will be responsible for meeting deadlines in reporting to the Senate.”

“Having definite goals and scopes to our projects will add a bit of needed pressure on senators,” Butner explained. “We
also need to coordinate our lobbying.”

Butner proposed a system where each senator would carry on low-key lobbies with several faculty members, keeping close contact with
them to ensure communication of student needs and opinions.

Goodloe has served in the Senate for two years, filling Rick Damewood’s seat as Dorm Senator last year and currently
serving as a senator at large. He is chairman of the Grievance Committee.

Goodloe indicated his feeling that individual issues were not as important as the development of an improved sense of academic
community at Davidson. “There is too much of an armed camp between students, faculty, and administration,” said Goodloe. “We could
do without a lot of this friction.”

Goodloe expressed interest in changing the emphasis of student government. “I would like to suggest more of a forum structure
with more volunteers participating to get things done,” he said. He also stressed the need for more continuity in student
government. “I want the senators, especially the three or four senior senators, to work closely together with a common direction
and strategy to get solid accomplishments. We need a corps of leadership as opposed to a one-man show,” he said.

Goodloe emphasized his concern over the present housing situation. “The SGA needs to find out what's planned and find out
if these plans are acceptable,” he said. “I would like to see the size of the Davidson student body stabilized
at 1160 students for a few years. I feel we ought to hold off on housing for a couple of
years and then reevaluate.”

Goodloe also expressed an interest in ending sexual discrimination in admissions policy.

Rabil has been active in the SGA for two and a half years, serving one year on the Senate Executive
Committee, and as a member of the Educational Affairs Committee, and the Student Conduct Council. He is chairman of the
SGA Constitution and By-laws Committee.

“Right now, one of the most important problems we have to come to grips with is ARA Slater and the
rising food costs there,” he said. Rabil also expressed his desire to see students involved in deciding what kind of
new housing the college would build. “We need to increase the student population to bring in more money,” Rabil said.

Rabil indicated that it was hard to set priorities on college needs and facilities. “I feel that facilities relating to
student life such as a new union and a new gym are more crucial than educational buildings.”

“I conceive of the role of SGA president as a position demanding strong leadership,” Rabil said. “For too (See PRESIDENT,

Tanner To Succeed Hoon As New**Davidsonian Editor**

**By ALEC HOON Editor-In-Chief**

The SGA Elections Board announced this week that Mike Tanner will become the new Editor-in-Chief of THE DAVIDSONIAN. Currently the
Executive Editor of the paper, Tanner was unopposed for the editor position. Tanner is a junior economics major from Jacksonville,
Fla. While he plans no sweeping reforms in the paper, Tanner said that he hopes to improve the organization of
the staff so that it takes less time to get the newspaper out.

“I will first concentrate on organizing the staff so that the actual compilation of the paper can be done as
smoothly as possible."

**Candidates File For SGA Elections**

The SGA Elections Board announced after the Tuesday afternoon filing deadline for next Tuesday’s elections that a number of positions
will be filled without the necessity of an election since only one student or ticket chose to run. Junior Mike
Tanner will assume the editorship of THE DAVIDSONIAN without opposition. Sophomore Frazier Marsh ran unopposed for the Presidency of the
Union Board, and will replace the incumbent Joe Earle. As a result of other unopposed candidacies, junior Tom Tornee will
serve a second term as Social Council President, and senior Rob Strand and junior Barry Blakley will co-edit the 1974
Wildcat Handbook. Likewise, the ticket of juniors Eric Walker and Steve Canterbury will assume control of The Miscellany for the
coming year.

The Board announced that in the key race for SGA President there will be four candidates: Blaine Butner, Jim Goodloe,
Vince Rahil, and John Scholer. All four have begun preparations for a week of active campaigning. There will also be
four candidates for SGA Vice-President: John Cassels, John Guthrie, Duncan Moore, and Jim Prince. Next Tuesday's choice for editor of
the yearbook, “Quips & Cranks,” will be between sophomore Randy Hunter and junior Carroll Ensley. There will be a three-way
race for control of WDAV, with David Gleim running against the two-man tickets of Charles Neal-Rory Crawford, and Mark Wilensky-Bucky
Neal. Likewise, Chip Jones will be running against Patsy Arnold-Rick Love, and Mark Connors-Gus Succop for Freshman Advisor. Two members
for the Review Board will be chosen from among juniors Rick Mullen, Shaul Saddick, and John Walters. Three members for
the Hearing Committee from (See SGA, page 12).

“This should lighten the printshop load on the editors and allow them to concentrate more on improving the quality of
the writing itself,” Tanner indicated.

Tanner views the role of THE DAVIDSONIAN on campus as a means of informing as well as shaping the opinions
of its readers. “Since the student government hasn't been able to express student concerns, it is vitally important that THE
DAVIDSONIAN express a viewpoint that will get something done,” Tanner said. “We have got to show the administration and faculty
that students have definite opinions on what the priorities of the college should be,” he said.

Tanner cited the college's building priorities as an area in which THE DAVIDSONIAN will focus much attention during the coming
year. “In the coming year, the college community must decide what it wants most: a new athletic complex, more dormitories,
or a new union building. I plan to do in-depth investigations in this area so that everyone will be fully
aware of each possible alternative, and of the ramifications of each choice,” Tanner said.

Tanner emphasized that the news pages will continue to cover events of the college community, but that more emphasis will
be placed on an analytical approach to topics of interest and importance. “The editor's job is to direct the staff,
but he also has the obligation to exert leadership and pressure when needed through an effective editorial page.” Tanner said
that while his opinions were very similar to those of the present editor, Alec Hoon, he hopes to give the
conservative elements on campus more of a voice in the paper.
