#### A Band
From appearances, most of the college S. A. T. C.'s of the country have a band or musical organization of some kind, if nothing more than a fife and kettle drum. Every camp or army post in the country has its band. Strains of martial music may be heard on almost every one of the larger ships in the Navy. Davidson is now an army post and Davidson men are full-fledged soldiers of Uncle Sam, under special training. Then why can't we have a band to make more impressive any ceremonies which it may be necessary to observe, and to shake a little pep out of the crowds at the games which will be played on the Hill? Surely out of the body of men gathered at Davidson there are some who can rattle a kettle drum, toot a trombone, beat a bass drum, blow a bugle, or manipulate some other instrument. There's nothing like a band for killing monotony and putting snap and life in a fellow. One could be built up around our rival buglers as a nucleus. How about it?

#### The Forum
For the last two years, The Davidsonian has been running a department called The Forum, in which any articles submitted by students or alumni containing any ideas or suggestions of value or dealing with campus problems have been printed. The conditions on the campus this year are of course greatly changed from those of the old college days, yet even now constructive criticism and the expression of one's opinions would not be out of place. Being under military authority, stricter care must be taken as to what we print, and of course a reasonable degree of censorship is observed in all articles, but that does not prevent the expression of views concerning the activities of the student soldiers themselves. This department will gladly welcome any such articles and we hope that The Forum will prove a success.

“Discipline is the desire, the eager, earnest desire to obey all orders and to see that they are properly carried out regardless of consequence or danger.”

#### Cigarettes and Bedding
Almost every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon when the bedding is brought in from being sunned, some fellow finds a round, charred hole in his sheet or blanket and a burnt-out cigarette or cigar stub lying in the middle of it. A cigarette carelessly thrown out of a window on one of these days can’t help but land on someone's bedding. It’s a pity some fellow can't throw a cigarette on his own blanket some day, so that when he finds the remains, possibly he will begin to have a little consideration for others. It’s merely an act of thoughtlessness which should easily be controlled with very little effort. Can't something be done to stop it?

Let's turn out Saturday with some of that old-time Davidson pep and make a noise. Remember that the Wofford squad will be visitors on the campus, and let's cut out all personal talk. Show that Davidson courtesy, but don’t fail to let them know that our team has the support of every man on the Hill. Any fellow who stays away from the game without sufficient reason, and hasn't enough interest even to ask the score when it is over, deserves to be run out of town. Some say that Davidson can’t yell; show them Saturday whether you can or not. Coach and the team will do it. Let them know the student body is backing them.

#### Written 400 Years Ago
Old Mother Shipton, an aged 16th-century witch of western England, wrote these jingling lines back in 1514—four hundred years ago:

When Pictures look alive,  
With movement free;  
When Ships like fishes  
Swim beneath the sea;  
When men, outstripping birds  
Do scorn the sky;  
Then half the world,  
Deep drenched in blood,  
Shall die.

Some prophetess, wouldn't you say?

#### The Ideal Soldier
The following eighteen characteristics Wordsworth attributes to the ideal soldier in his poem, the Happy Warrior: Generous, diligent to learn, moral, self-controlled, compassionate,controlled by reason, honorable, faithful, likable, rises to crisis, consistent in his laws of life in battle and at peace, equal to the need, at heart loving peace and home, plays a square game, brave, optimistic, believing heart and soul in his cause, faith in God: “This is the happy warrior; this is he Whom every man in arms should wish to be.” At last we don’t have to get up in the morning and see the moon and stars shining. Those overseas addresses haven't anything on us. Can you make this out? Pvt. John Smith, Co. A, D.C. S. A. T. C., S. E. Sect., D. P.O., N.C., U.S.A.

The following is an extract from a recent letter from Dr. T. W. Lingle, formerly professor at Davidson, who has won the badge of honor as a Y secretary on the fighting front:

“Two days ago I spent a day with Major McConnell. We surely had a good time together. Last night I saw Lieutenant Todd, ‘09. He had been gassed and was very hoarse. He said Joe Roddey got five shell wounds at the same time and is in the hospital. .... They were with the French in one of the hardest pushes made this last week.

“I experienced some real war myself just before leaving the French camp. One afternoon the American officers (at Verdun forts), sent an auto for me to go up to the batteries and report on my recent mission. I stayed and took dinner in an abri with the lieutenant colonel and a major. The thundering of the cannon of various sizes at all sorts of unexpected nooks and corners for the two or three hours of my stay got on my nerves, but I tried to act like a man used to it all his life. It was interesting to see three fired in succession and then to watch the explosions in succession away over on a hill held by the enemy. I stayed until 8:30 and the illumination of the hills and the heavens was wonderful to me. The enemy made only feeble reply, the American and French batteries thundered away all the time from all the slopes and ravines. Of course aviation was going on too. Guess I had better not describe that in detail. When I got home and tried to sleep, the artillery was of course some miles away. But there is one big old grandfather very near me, overshadowing all others I have ever heard. He ‘acts’ about every half hour regularly during the night. When he lets go, one grabs the rails of his bed, the earth shudders, and the hills re-echo for about thirty seconds. I asked the Frenchmen what the thing is like when it lands over among the Germans. ‘Trois fois pire’ is the reply. ‘Glad I’m not there in that case.’”
