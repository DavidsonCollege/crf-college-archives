The Davidson Wildcats suffered a heartbreaking defeat at defending-league champion Jacksonville, dropping a 27-21 decision to the Dolphins on Saturday. The Wildcats rallied from a 20-point deficit in the fourth quarter, scoring fourteen unanswered points before coming up empty on a fourth-down conversion in the closing minutes.

Matt Heavner ’12 came on at quarterback in the fourth quarter in relief of Michael Blanchard ’11 and threw for 66 yards on 7-10 passes and a touchdown to key the rally. He was aided by Mark Hanabury ’11, who recorded nine receptions for 146 yards and a score. Kenny Mantuo ’11 led the Davidson rushing attack with 66 yards on 18 carries and scored twice.

Down 27-7 entering the fourth quarter, the Wildcats reached into their bag of tricks to jump-start their offense. Andrew Aldrich ’10 threw a wide receiver pass to Hanabury for a 36-yard gain on the first play of the final quarter. The play put Davidson on the Dolphin 39. Hanabury added a 20-yard catch later in the drive to set up Mantuo’s one-yard scoring plunge.

The defense reacted to the scoring drive with a momentous performance of their own. Malcolm Moses-Hampton ’12 dropped Dolphins running back Rudell Small for an 11-yard loss on the first play of Jacksonville’s next drive. Alex Griswold ’10 and Daniel Astrop ’11 recorded sacks on the next two plays to force Jacksonville to punt from their own two on 4th-and-39. Justin Williams ’11 returned the punt to the Dolphin 24. Working with the prime field position, the Wildcats soon produced another touchdown, with Heavner finding Hanabury from seven yards out. Ben Behrendt’s ’11 extra point made the score 27-21.

The Wildcat defense gave up a decent Dolphin drive after the score, but stiffened in time to force a 51-yard field goal attempt that sailed wide left, giving Davidson the chance to drive for a winning touchdown. Davidson drove 35 yards on their final drive but came up short on a fourth-and-six. Heavner connected with Hanabury, but Hanabury slipped as he planted his foot to cut up field. He crashed to the ground at the Dolphin 31, one yard shy of the first down marker.

The game was reminiscent of last year’s meeting, when Davidson overcame a 35-14 deficit to defeat Jacksonville 38-35. Josh McGregor led the Dolphins with 261 yards and two touchdowns on 18-28 passing. Small added 110 yards on 18 carries and a touchdown.

Jacksonville opened the scoring with five minutes gone in the game, when McGregor found Jarvis Williams for an 11-yard scoring strike. Davidson answered at the beginning of the second quarter when Mantuo dove into the end zone from a yard out to cap a 76-yard drive. Josh Philpart hauled in a 20-yard pass from McGregor with eight minutes to play in the first half to allow Jacksonville to reclaim the lead. Small increased the advantage with one minute to play when he scampered 11 yards for a score to cap a 91-yard drive. The Dolphins tallied their final points with four minutes to play in the third quarter when McGregor kept the ball and ran it in from 11 yards out.

Griswold recorded a career-high 10 tackles to lead the Wildcat defense, including two sacks and 3.5 tackles for a loss. Astrop was close behind with nine tackles and one sack. “I was really proud of our defense, especially in the second half,” Wildcat coach

3/4-8 SoCon Tournament (Charlotte, North Carolina)

Andrew Wohler ’11 punted five times for a 38-yard average in the Wildcats’ 27-21 loss at Jacksonville on Saturday. Tripp Merritt said, “We made some adjustments at halftime, and once we got into the right coverages and calls, we really settled in.” Neither team turned the ball over. The Wildcats helped their own cause by committing only one penalty on the day for five yards. The Dolphins committed eight penalties for 74 yards. The loss dropped Davidson to 1-3 overall, and 1-1 in league play. The Dolphins improved to 2-2 and 1-0. This was the third game out of four in which the Wildcats fell behind by twenty points. However, they displayed remarkable resiliency by continuing to fight and go toe-to-toe with the defending Pioneer Football League Champions. “I was proud of the heart we showed today,” Behrendt said. “We’re really excited to get back home and play again Saturday.” Davidson will challenge Morehead State next week in Richardson Stadium. Kickoff will be at 1 p.m.
