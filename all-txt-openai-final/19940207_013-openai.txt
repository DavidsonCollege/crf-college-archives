**McKillop has brought us a long way in a short time**

By Will Cobb

During the 1989-90 school year, Davidson basketball reached an all-time low. The men endured a dismal 4-24 record in Bob
McKillop’s inaugural year. Just four years before, Davidson participated in the NCAA tournament. Now, four years later, things have really
changed, but none of it was easy.

A telling sign for good things to come happened in May of 1990 when Terry Holland, following his resignation as
head basketball coach at Virginia, accepted the position of athletic director at Davidson College. Baker Sports Complex was only one
year old, and many people figured success would come eventually with such a fine sports facility. Despite the poor record,
Davidson found itself an independent, no longer in the Southern Conference, which Davidson at one time dominated. Working up from
the bottom, we joined the Big South Conference, where we finished in the middle of the pack for two years.
After a lot of hard work, Davidson worked its way back into the Southern Conference, competing in all sports except
football. The first year back was last year’s season, and Davidson made a strong statement, finishing with a respectable 10-8
conference record, reaching the tournament semifinals before falling to the eventual champion UT-Chattanooga 72-68.

That brings us to this season. The current senior class entered Davidson as freshmen following the 4-24 disaster. The talented
crop was considered strong enough to bring Davidson out of the valley immediately. McKillop was highly praised for his first
round of recruiting. But not everything went well as about half of the class fell to injury or left the
school. During the Christmas break of the 1991-92 school year, players Pat Holloway and Frank Harris left school. At that
time, people were yelling for McKillop’s job, wondering why all of our best players were leaving, blaming him for losing
players and close games. Times were tough, but to his credit, every year he won more games than he had
the year before. Last year, the Cats finished an even .500, ending a streak of four consecutive losing seasons. Now
after Saturday’s impressive victory over Georgia Southern, Davidson is guaranteed a winning season. With a record now at 14-5, and
7 games remaining on the schedule, the 'Cats have a strong chance to win 20 games and the possibility of
reaching post-season play without winning the conference tournament.

A banner hung in Belk Arena Saturday stating, "No Spain No Gain." The creator of that sign prophesied correctly as
Davidson defeated Georgia Southern 83-71. Spain punished the Eagles with dunks, rebounds, and solid defense. Earlier this week the Cats
defeated Western Carolina as Chris Alpert posted a career-high 25 points. The Cats presently stand in fourth place of the
Southern Conference but only one game out of first. Davidson’s record stands at 8-4 compared to 9-3 for App. St.,
8-3 for UTC, and 7-3 for ETSU.

Davidson’s big men were simply too much for the smaller Eagles. George Spain, Brandon Williams, Janko Narat, and Mark McGuire
combined for 63 points and 20 rebounds. Besides their offensive production, they prohibited Georgia Southern from any second-chance scoring opportunities.
Davidson had 30 defensive rebounds and allowed very few easy shots. Another telling statistic was that the Wildcats shot a
staggering 65 percent to garner a comfortable first-half lead. Spain, who led the country in field goal percentage at one
time, shot 9-12 from the field. Much of the Cats' shooting success was due to a large amount of slam
dunks and close-range shots that the Eagles failed to defend. Davidson only took twelve three-pointers, considerably less than most other
games.

Tim Heath was the lone bright spot for the Eagles. He came off the bench with 24 points on 10-20
shooting. Freshman Lonnie Edwards struggled with the Cats' pressure and managed to only connect on two of twelve shots. Because
the Davidson defense would allow little penetration, the Eagles took long jump shots. Georgia Southern struggled from long range, shooting
6-26 from three-point range.

After the victory, Brandon Williams was quoted as saying, “I think what we’ve been doing for a year and a
half is developing a style, and we want to be a physical, in-control team. We’re as athletic and as strong
as many of the teams we play, so I see no reason we should shy away.”

Janko Narat chipped in 16 points last Saturday, and now stands 14th on Davidson’s all-time scoring list, and should climb
higher in the next few games. With 14 wins so far, Davidson has a legitimate shot at a 20-victory season
and possible bids to either the NCAA or NIT tournaments. Four of Davidson’s last six conference games will be played
at home. On Monday Davidson will be able to avenge an early season conference loss to the Citadel. On Saturday,
they travel to Furman. This February fever could soon be turning into March madness if the 'Cats can keep up
this pace.Level of play: Women’s B-ball breaks into SoCon action

Last Saturday night at 7:30 p.m., the Davidson women’s basketball team officially entered Southern Conference play against the Furman Paladins.
After winning three of their last five, the Cats felt ready for a challenging game, but Furman was just too
tough and defeated the Cats 78-57.

The Cats won themselves a confidence-builder by defeating Gardner-Webb on Wednesday night to improve their record to 5-11. The Cats
defeated Gardner-Webb for the first time ever with a convincing 81-72 victory. Sophomore Maggie Young set the tone for the
game when she stole the ball with 19:24 left in the first half and converted a layup. Erin Butcher then
completed two consecutive layups to start the Cats off right. Erin Butcher ended the night with 18 points. Delania Adams
leads Gardner-Webb in scoring, averaging 20.1 points per game. The Wildcats, however, played excellent defense and held Adams to only
13 points. Gardner-Webb was also plagued by turnovers and poor free-throw shooting. With 54 seconds remaining, GW guard Damenda Dellinger
made a layup to cut Davidson’s lead to 7. The Cats hung tough, however, and caused GW to commit another
turnover. With 15 seconds left, Dellinger fouled freshwoman Amy Scalcucci, who converted both free-throws for the final points of the
game.

After the game, coach John Filar said that he was pleased with his team’s performance: “I thought we handled some
adverse officiating really well. Erin Butcher did a great job shooting the ball, and it was probably Elizabeth Dubose’s best
floor game of the year. Amy Scalcucci came back to where she was at the beginning of the season. She
came off the bench and hit some big threes and was 6 of 6 from the free throw line. The
team played well overall.” Filar also pointed out that Kristen Ferrucci did an excellent job of using her height advantage
to dominate Gardner-Webb.

Coach John Filar commented on the upcoming game against Furman on Wednesday: “They are a super team. If you stop
the inside game of theirs of Rushia Brown, then they kill you from the three-point land, and if you concentrate...

Women’s track and field impresses at Va. Tech indoor meet

By Jean DeMoss

After an unusual winter break, including bad weather, training conditions, and illness, the women’s track team reconvened for an indoor
track meet at Virginia Tech on January 22. Racing against stiff competition, the Wildcats put forth a valiant effort. Several
school records fell and personal bests were achieved by several athletes. After a brief hiatus, track is back at Davidson.

Freshman sensation Lara Burkholder set three school records during the meet. The first record fell Friday night when Lara jumped
17'3"1/4 in the long jump. She finished a respectable sixth place. In the 200m, Lara ran a time of 28.48
and broke her second school record of the day. Anne Bartholomew joined Burkholder and ran a 30.05. On Saturday morning,
the school record in the 55m dash was rewritten when Lara clocked a 7.73.

Running circles around the 200m indoor track, distance runners battled dehydration and fatigue. In the 5000m, freshman Stephanie Moses and
junior Elizabeth Bishop, back from Kenya, finished fifth and sixth place respectively. Carolyn Meadows and Erin Roach competed in the
3000m and ran strong for the Wildcats. The final event of the evening was the distance medley relay. Phuong Nguyen,
Maria Whitehead, Jean DeMoss, and Marie Grisez (800, 400, 1200, 1600) teamed up for a fierce relay. Intimidating opponents with
a synchronized warm-up and stretching routine, the relay finished a strong third. Yet the school record eluded the relay team
by four seconds. Not satisfied with second best, the relay team plans to challenge the record in the next meet.

Saturday morning competition started with Erika Gromelski throwing the shot put, Maria Whitehead soaring in the triple jump, and Jean
DeMoss on the oval track running the mile. All three women challenged their personal bests for indoor track early in
the season. Whitehead later put on her running spikes and raced in the 500m run. In her first indoor track
meet, freshman Sallie Permar ran a stunning 2:34 half mile. Mary Baxter (2:42) and Annie Parsons (2:53), both competing indoors
for the first time. The women are forming a solid pack of 800m runners. The last event of the meet,
the 4X800m relay teamed Marie Grisez (2:37), Jean DeMoss (2:40), Phuong Nguyen (2:39), and Sallie Permar (2:35) together. The team
battled it out on the track for a fine performance.

The Lady Wildcat thinclads continued the indoor track season competing in the Pepsi Women’s Relays on February 5th at Virginia
Tech. Sleepy athletes converged at Baker at 6 a.m., leaving in time for freshman Lara Burkholder to compete in the
55m dash. She ran a 7.78 to get into the semifinals. Shortly after, Stephanie Moses (11:22) won her heat of
the 3000m. She was quickly followed by Erin Roach (11:52). The two-mile relay...
