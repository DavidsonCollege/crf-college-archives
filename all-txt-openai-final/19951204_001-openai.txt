Murphy returns as new AD

By Matt Pitzer
Sports Editor

Davidson athletics turned a
corner this week, naming a lesser-
known alumnus as its new Athletic
Director.

In announcing Tuesday that
Jim Murphy, a 1978 graduate,
would be the next AD, Davidson
effectively drew back from a five-
year period of striving for national
recognition but at the same time
reaffirmed its commitment to main-
tain a strong athletic system at the
current level.

The selection of Murphy, the
Executive Associate Athletic Di-
rector at Georgia Tech, ended a
search that began in mid-summer
to replace the highly-regarded
Terry Holland, who accepted the
parallel post at Virginia.

Murphy was chosen over two
other finalists, John Gerdy,
Davidson’s all-time leading men’s
basketball scorer, and Tom Shupe,
an Associate Athletic Director at
Virginia.

“It’s a
special feel-
ing, because
I’m very bi-
ased toward
the way
Davidson
does things
and has al-
ways done
things,” Murphy said this week in
an interview from his Atlanta of-
fice. “It’s going to be a great situ-

Jim Murphy

ation. We’re very excited for the
opportunity.”

During his 10 years at Geor-
gia Tech, Murphy earned a reputa-
tion as a financial wizard and
fundraiser. Serving also as chief
financial officer for the Georgia
Tech Athletic Association, the or-
ganization that runs Yellow Jack-
ets athletics, he increased its bud-
get from $5 million to $16 million.
He also recently directed a $40
million capital campaign over the
past 3 1/2 years.

President John Kuykendall
said in a statement, “Jim Murphy
brings us a broad range of under-
standing to intercollegiate sports
... As an alumnus and former stu-
dent-athlete, he also cherishes this
college and understands the place
of athletics in our academically
rigorous environment.”

Members of the five-person
search committee were not swayed
by arguments wanting a well-

As night fell on the town of
Davidson Wednesday, normally
quiet Main Street was trans-
formed into a mecca of activity
and holiday cheer for the three-
evening Christmas in Davidson
celebration.

“This is about the sixth year
(of the celebration), and it gets
bigger and better every year. At-
tendance goes up, and the mer-
chants do more to prepare,”
Davidson mayor Russell Knox
says. “It is a real shot in the arm of
Christmas spirit for all of us. We
just wish we could get more stu-
dents to come out.”

Many of the town merchants
reopened their stores and had spe-
cial attractions to help add to the
atmosphere of the event. There
were horse-drawn carriage rides
leaving from behind the Duke
Power plant on each of the three
evenings, and the carriages were
often seen click-clacking through
the streets.

But it was the children of
Davidson and the surrounding

communities who seemed most
enthralled by the celebration.

“It’s great — the best place in
the world — because most every-
thing you don’t have to pay for,”
Lizzie Mandle, a first grader at
Davidson Elementary said. “So far
I’ve listened to music and got some
pom poms, and we went to the
Soda Shop for dinner. I’m gonna
spoil myself, but I hope I go on a
carriage ride.”

One of Mandle’s classmates,
Margie Gudaitis, said her favorite
memory of the fair was listening to
people sing songs the year before,
but she couldn’t remember who
had sung. She also enjoyed pet-
ting the sheep that was out on
Wednesday evening.

“He’s soft, and I’ve never
seen a sheep before,” Gudaitis
said, and she continued on about
the fair. “It’s fun. There’s lights
everywhere, and sometimes I see
friends,” then she flashed Lizzie a
smile that was reciprocated.

Gudaitis’ four-year-old
brother, Peter, was not as talk-
ative as his sister and Mandle, but

In response to the survey taken
by the Student Advisory Council
(SAC) last month, Residence Life
has altered some of its policies to
cater to the requests of many se-
niors. The main issue of discon-
tent among those surveyed cen-
tered around the issue of a delayed
senior checkout after graduation.
SGA member and Chair of the
Student Advisory Council to the
Director of Residence Life Sara
Beth Hamlin headed a sub-com-
mittee to investigate possible rem-
edies. To accommodate the majority
of seniors, who expressed the de-
sire to remain in their apartments
Sunday night following com-
mencement, Hamlin worked with
Kurt Holmes, Director of the Resi-
dence Life Office, to modify the
previous policy.

In the past, seniors were re-
quired to complete check-out by 5
p.m. on graduation day. Hamlin
indicated that changing policy was
“a convenience issue,” concerning
RLO staff moveout, Physical Plant
operation, and cleanup required for
the readying of summer housing.
However, the biggest concern was
the possibility of vandalism to the
apartments once graduation cer-
emonies are over.

RLO expressed concern that
students would no longer respect
Residence Life policies if they felt
released of their obligations after
