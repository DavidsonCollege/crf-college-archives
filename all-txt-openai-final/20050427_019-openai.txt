Club lacrosse claims conference championship

An invitation to participate in the USL- MDIA National Championship in Blaine, MN, next week means that the 7th-ranked club lacrosse team will be extending their post-season play. Lacrosse beat Appalachian State in a double-overtime thriller Sunday afternoon by a score of 12-11 to win the Southeastern Lacrosse Conference (SELC) Division B Championship in only its second year in the league. There are 13 teams in the B-division, which consists of smaller schools with a 1-AA football program. As champion, Davidson receives one of 16 automatic qualifiers to the national club lacrosse tournament held annually in early May.

“The level of talent on this team is incredible,” said goalie Ben Ralston ’05. “In a time when Title IX has made men’s club sports extremely competitive, this young team has been able to dominate. I only wish I could play in the coming years when I know Davidson lacrosse will make another run at the national championship.”

Ralston, named to the SELC All-Conference and All-Tournament teams, made several crucial saves during the two overtime periods, which allowed Davidson to get the clinching goal. The ’Cats finished the regular season with an overall record of 8-2 and 5-1 in SELC conference play and headed into the tournament as the 3rd overall seed with a number of regular season victories behind them. In 2005, Davidson had defeated cross-conference rival Elon University on the Phoenix’s home field, beat A-division University of South Carolina for the second consecutive year, and outscored their opponents 167 to 82. Davidson had extra incentive heading into this year’s tournament, seeking revenge for a heartbreaking 17-19 loss to No. 5 Appalachian State earlier in the season in Richardson Stadium. In a sudden burst of offense, co-captain Garen Riedel ’06 took an overhand shot that found the back of the net and gave the team its first conference championship.

None of the team’s accomplishments would have been possible without the participation of head coach Fuji Lozada, a Davidson professor of anthropology and former Division-I lacrosse player. Lozada’s organization and commitment to the team were invaluable to the team’s success at any level.

“Having a faculty member involved with a club program who is just as passionate about the game as the players is a necessity if you want to have a successful program,” said defenseman Greg Means ’08. “Luckily, we have that. Fuji brings experience and focus to the field through his days playing defense at Harvard, and we have a lot of fun with him as we win tournaments.”

Coach Lozada is aiming to build a strong fundamental program that can compete at the highest possible level. “This year, our second year in the league,” Lozada said, “we shocked everyone in the Southern lacrosse world by winning the B-Division championship and hopefully, with even more support from the college, we can compete on a national stage at the first national championship for the B-Division of the US Lacrosse Intercollegiate Associates.”

Even if problems arise in organizing a trip to the national tournament, the team members still plan to participate in games over the summer.During a tournament in Beijing, “Our upcoming trip to China will bring [the team] to an even wider audience,” said Lozada. With the possibility of extending post-season play, many team members are excited to bring recognition to Davidson College athletics at a national level. This year alone, the team had five players named to the All-Conference teams and six to the All-Tournament team, as well as the tournament offensive MVP and the defensive MVP of the year. Last year, the ’Cats had three honorable mention All-Americans and hope to increase that number as the program improves every year. Since the inaugural season in 2003, the roster has almost tripled in size to 29 players, only seven of them seniors. With a reliance primarily on outside sources to support the team, men’s lacrosse has been searching for funds from organizations on campus to subsidize their trip to Minnesota. Fighting for field space and facilities is more challenging as the number and intensity of clubs at Davidson grows. “Club teams such as club lacrosse or DUFF,” Lozada said, “while supported by the college, do not have the same status as varsity teams. There is not the same recognition, despite the similar black-and-blue color of the bruises and the shared content of the sweat on the fields of play, club level athletes are seen as pursuing hobbies on the side.” Throughout the season, the team was outnumbered but won by relying on teamwork. “Sweeping two great teams [during the SELC Tournament] that had the advantage of scholarship funds and large numbers, we were able to play through injury and get by on heart,” said attackman Jamie Butler '07. “I look forward to the chance to represent Davidson at the national championship.” With a chance at a national championship, the team looks forward to the 2005-06 season to further improve and gain more support from students and the administration.
