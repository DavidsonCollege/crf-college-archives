**Date USC, 21-4**

Reese Eek led the Wildcats lacrosse team with five goals and two assists to a 21-4 victory over the University of South Carolina. It was the last game for the stickmen as they finished with a 5-3 record. Other scorers for the Cats were Dave Riopel (3), Phil Goodnow (2), John Higginbotham (2), Rob Moore (2), Dave Waddill (2), Tom Baker (1), Andy Engh (1), Dean Jones (1), Ben McCall (1), and Kevin Wheelock (1).

The Cats also received great support from their defense. Led by the spirit of goalkeeper Tommy Thompson, and the defense of Kelvin Anderson and Bob Bowden, the Cats battered, bruised, and beat the South Carolina team. —JOE FORD

**Women’s track ends at State**

The Davidson women’s track team concluded their season this past weekend at the N.C. State meet. Leading the effort was Susan who set a school record in the 1500m with a time of 4:57.7. Diane Downing got a 4th place in the 400m intermediate hurdle and a 6th in the 400m dash, as well as competing on three relay teams. Mike Frankhouser finished 6th in the javelin and 7th in the high jump. Coach Steve Frank praised the efforts of all the members of the team and especially Carol Heppner’s performances in the 3 relay races. He was extremely pleased with everyone’s showings throughout the season and considers the season a success for everyone involved. —JOHN REES

**Men’s track finishes eighth**

The Davidson men’s track team finished up its season with the Southern Conference meet this past Saturday at The Citadel in Charleston, S.C. Dick Jones and Lance Sisco led the Cat effort placing in the intermediate hurdles and 110m high hurdles, respectively. Coach Kremser commented that he expected the team to place higher than eighth, noting that the competition was more even than last year. Sisco and Jones will be continuing in competition this week, running in an invitational meet this Saturday at N.C. State. —JOHN HOOTS

**Girls’ soccer gains support**

Throughout the spring, an interest in the women’s club soccer team seems to be gradually increasing. Hopefully, this enthusiasm will result in a well-established team for the upcoming years.

On Sunday, April 28, some women soccer players from Davidson competed against a women’s club team from Charlotte. Even though Davidson had already won a match against this team earlier in the season, the Wildcats lost with a final score of 3-1 (Caroline Scott scored the goal). After the game, the Davidson and Charlotte players enjoyed a cookout at Hobart’s Park together.

Many of the women from Charlotte commented on the speedy improvement of the Davidson players; also, the opponents seemed to think that the formation of a women’s varsity soccer team would be a good idea because of the zest and ability of the present players.

If you have not yet had the opportunity to observe this dynamic team, then perhaps you can see the game at Fayetteville this Sunday. Probably, a few more games will be scheduled before the end of the term.

**Men’s tennis disappointed**

There wasn't a lot of enthusiasm radiating from the men’s tennis team when they returned from the Southern Conference tournament. It could only be described as a long three days. The one bright spot was the second place finish of sophomore Nevins Todd. Although he lost (6-3, 6-8) in the finals, he beat the number one seed (6-0, 6-2).

The biggest letdown was probably the finish of the number-one doubles. Harry Griffith and Jay Gepfert finished fourth. Gepfert called “untouchable tandem” by this Davidsonian writer has a bright note for the readers. They have an opportunity to be in the NCAA Tennis tournament, entering in the doubles competition. It would be the first time in Davidson history that the team ended up 11-9, with 8 rainouts. —MARSHA COATES
