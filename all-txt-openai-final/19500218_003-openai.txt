MRS. R. H. LITTLE

Mrs. Little Brings To Dorms, Rumple Atmosphere Of Home

Believing that a simple word of appreciation for a thankless job well done is good, we are moved to make
this public expression of gratitude to Mrs. R. A. Little. Mrs. Little came to Davidson in the fall of 1946
following the resignation of Mrs. N. T. Smith, and has endeared herself to all those who have come to know
her. From the start, her job was, as stated, thankless and hard: the school was overcrowded, necessitating the placement of
three, sometimes four students to a room; too, the lean confusion of war years had left the dormitories neglected and
bare of fixtures such as curtains, desks, and bookshelves.

Furnishing the rooms is one problem; but her big puzzle each year is how to put 900 boys in the
room they want with congenial roommates of their choice. We concede there is no way for room assignment to be
done and each student be perfectly pleased, but we can say in a way of praise that Mrs. Little is
never ceasing in her study of individual problems, to give the student what he wants in so far as possible.
Her time is spent in sincere attempt to make living conditions for the student as desirable as possible. Should, on
a rare visit into the dormitories, she find a week’s wear of clothes piled knee-deep — Mrs. Little administers her
most firm form of discipline: a short, unobtrusive, inoffensive note suggesting a remedy of the unclean situation. She does not
hesitate to enforce the dormitory regulations in a business-like way.

The boys who see most of Mrs. Little appreciate her zeal and her encouraging influence. At the first sign of
homesickness or despondency, neither uncommon even among Davidson men, she has a cheering word or bit of her philosophy to
inspire a depressed heart. Especially she has the capacity to make the younger arrivals here feel at home. The sincere
personal interest she takes in each student — without the spilling of undue affection may remind him of the care
and counsel his mother would afford.

The dormitory housekeeping department has taken on a new efficiency, especially regarding the daily janitor cleaning, as Mrs. Little has
quietly gone about making suggestions and seeing that the work has been well done. It is in this capacity, coupled
with that of room assignment, that Davidson was among the first of American men's colleges to place a woman. In
our opinion, this supervision under Mrs. Little has become one of the attractive features of our college life and we
are uniquely fortunate to have her services.

As if her duties on behalf of the college were not enough, she has gone out of her way to
secure suitable rooms in private homes for dates on dance weekends — a tremendous aid to the many students faced
with the problem of where to house dates. This weekend Carolina Inn has been evacuated to help relieve the date-space
problem. It is for second-mile undertakings such as this that makes us feel that we should voice our thanks to
Mrs. Little. Her life is filled with Christian work and service.

Students Addressed

A meeting of the Inter-Collegiate Council, in which students from Barber-Scotia (a colored girls’ school at Concord), students from Johnson
C. Smith University, and twelve men from Davidson College, was held at Johnson C. Smith University in Charlotte, from three
to five o'clock last Saturday. One-time home missionary David Burgess, now a CIO organizer, spoke on the labor-management problem from
labor's viewpoint. Also present were Dr. and Mrs. Sherwood Eddy, also former missionaries. Meetings of the Inter-Collegiate Council are held
once every six weeks.

New Investigation Blames Greek Letter Societies For Evils

The dangerous influence wielded by sororities and fraternities on college campuses is greater today than ever before, according to Mrs.
Glenn Frank, widow of the former president of the University of Wisconsin and a former sorority member who has just
published the results of a special investigation in the February issue of PAGEANT Magazine. In “Citadels of Snobbery,” Mrs. Frank
warns that sororities and fraternities promote a “completely un-American, undemocratic caste system.” She charges that the fraternity and sorority practice
of screening applicants for membership on the basis of income, religion, and social position is responsible for innumerable personal tragedies.
She disagrees with those who brush away failure to make a fraternity with the excuse “That's life,” and points out
that the ingredients for success in life — ability, courage, and industry, are not considered in selecting new fraternity members.

Mrs. Frank reports that fraternities and sororities practice religious discrimination by setting quotas for Catholic students and banning Jews. As
a result, she says, Jewish students have been forced to form their own groups, thus creating segregation on the campus.
While we are spending billions abroad to save democracy, Mrs. Frank urges us to spend something at home to ensure
democracy. She calls on the parents of America to get their legislatures to wipe out fraternities and sororities by legislative
act. If we fail to do this, she asks, how can we expect democratic leaders to emerge from colleges and
universities which have desecrated that ideal?

NEW LEADERS SORELY NEEDED SAYS BURLINGTON OFFICIAL

Blacksburg, Va.—With industry intensively seeking prospective talent for key jobs, the average business executive today gives more time to the
development of key personnel under him than to any other activity, C. Eugene Rowe, treasurer of Burlington Mills Corporation, told
a group of seniors at Virginia Polytechnic Institute Friday (January 13). Speaking before the VPI Association for the Advancement of
Engineering Emphasis, Rowe told the future engineering graduates that the common aim of both industry and the schools is the
development of “better men for the future.”

“The success of any industry depends on its ability to deliver to the consuming public an ever-improved product or service
at a price more people can afford,” the textile official said. “Achieving this requires constant improvement in methods and machines,
and a flow of new ideas. All of these come only through constant improvement in leadership. The single factor most
responsible for the success of any free enterprise. And the primary consideration of any progressive industry today is in developing
top quality leadership at every level of management that can push the organization continually to greater achievements.”

Dean Of Pacific Exposes Method Of Communist Speaker

Forest Grove, Ore. — When Herbert Phillips, who was discharged from the University of Washington faculty last year, reportedly for
Communist affiliation, spoke to the student body at Pacific University recently, he got a surprise. At the conclusion of Phillips’
talk, Dean of Students W. Darlind took the platform and announced that on the previous evening he had written out
a prediction of Phillips’ message and mode of delivery and had sealed copies delivered to other faculty members. He then
read a copy. It was an accurate forecast, to wit: Phillips would make a point of being a Communist, discuss
well-known evils and ills of the world while avoiding a discussion of Communism as it is, and seek to present
himself as the personification of Communism. He had been able to make the forecast, although he...had not read Phillips nor
read any of his speeches because he knew what the Communist line is with students. Phillips was plainly surprised and,
according to some students, showed chagrin. Instructors afterwards reported students showed in classes they had been deeply impressed by this
evidence of lack of independent thinking on the part of a speaker ostensibly defending the right to freedom of speech
and thought. A student reporter who asked Phillips to comment on Darland’s forecast was told, “the less said about that
the better.”

Pacific University’s Political Forum made the necessary arrangements for Phillips to come to this campus. According to Dean Darland, “Pacific
University students and faculty have had their opportunity to analyze the pronouncements of a professed American communist. Our job is
to continue to build, with examples, action and new vigor, our positive answer to all preconceived dogmas.

“It may be well to consider that too much time spent verbalizing and scrapping with and about the American communists
may work in their favor. Time and energy spent in merely dislodging communistic philosophy is only an analytic chore. Our
real job is to develop through induction, experimentation, and experience, a philosophy which will be a positive force in a
confused world.

“We must not extend our energies being ‘against’ something. We must preserve a major portion of our energies to further
develop a government which will itself stand as an answer to communism, fascism, or any other dogma whatsoever.”

PROF. OSTWALT

Professor Ostwalt Returns From Leave Of Absence at Duke

Prof. J. H. Ostwalt, professor of education, returned to the campus this semester after a short leave of absence. During
this leave, Prof. Ostwalt did graduate work at Duke. Before coming to Davidson last year, Prof. Ostwalt was assistant director
of the Bureau of Testing and Guidance at Duke, the position which he again held during his leave of absence.
Also during the past summer, Prof. Ostwalt taught Education Psychology in the first term of summer school at Duke.

Prof. Ostwalt is originally from Statesville. He received his A.B. degree from Davidson in 1935 and his M.A. degree from
Duke in 1940. From 1941 to 1946, Prof. Ostwalt was in the army. His work was with military personnel administration.

The Burlington official outlined some of the qualifications which business today expects of the college graduate. A good technical background
achieved through education is an important essential, he said. “But education alone cannot do the job. There are plenty of
instances every day of non-college trained men outstripping some of the degree men.”

“What’s more important are the highly complex individual qualities of business success, qualities which enable a person to quickly develop
into a position of leadership,” he said. Examining some of the qualities business is seeking in choosing its future executives,
Rowe cited four principal qualifications: personality and character traits, an ability to work with people, a capacity for making sound
and purposeful decisions and judgments, and the ability to develop and to forcefully express ideas.

Emphasizing the latter point, Rowe stated that the development and selling of ideas “is the core of the future of
any organization. The man who comes forth with, sells, and carries to completion the greatest number and best ideas is
the man who will advance most rapidly.”

Rowe proposed a closer cooperation between industry and the schools as being the surest formula for developing the type of
individuals so urgently needed as future leaders in the business world. Davidson students may well take use of these ideas
in preparing themselves for work after college days.

JUDAS—BY CHARLES BURRUS PHOTOGRAPH OF THE MONTH

DAYDREAMING RATES FIRST AS FOE OF EFFECTIVE STUDY

Carbondale, ILL, (CHP) Looking up new words in the dictionary is the most important thing in study and the worst
enemy to study is day-dreaming. These are the conclusions recently drawn by a teacher of psychology at Southern Illinois University
after a survey in a class of 52 students. Roy V. Jordan, assistant professor of education, made the study which
revealed that students do not worry about such things as studying under a colored light, smoking while studying, or taking
notes as fast as you can write.

In scoring a list of 30 questions Jordan used two methods. They were scored both by frequency and according to
weighted opinion, using the “trackmeet” method. The use of the dictionary as the most important phase of study was ranked
first by the students in both the frequencies and weighted opinion scores. The question, “Do you have a tendency to
day-dream when you should be studying?” ranked second in the weighted score and third in frequencies. It far outranked the
other “grindin” question.

Of the six questions picked to answer five dealt with problems that come up after the student has actually started
to study. Three of them dealt with methods of study, such as skimming over an assignment before actually studying it
or making an outline of it. The other was, “Do activities often interfere with your study?”

Other questions which the students rated as of great importance were: “Do you sometimes study with the radio going or
with other persons talking in the same room?” “Do you try to use the facts learned in one subject to
understand another subject?” “Do you frequently analyze your work to see where you are weak?” and “Do you sometimes discover
that you have turned several pages in your textbook but that your ‘mind is blank’ for what was said on
them?”
