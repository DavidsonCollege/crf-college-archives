4 The DAVIDSONIAN, April 12, 1916

SENIOR ENGLISH CLASS SHAKESPEAREAN CONTEST

The Independent Magazine is conducting a series of essay contests in the colleges and universities of the country, in honor of the ter-centenary of the death of William Shakespeare. The prize is to be a medal, presented to the winner of the contest in each college. In addition, through the courtesy of Dr. Fulton, the successful contestant at Davidson is to be awarded a book on a Shakespearean subject. Some of the rules for the local contest are as follows:

1. The contest is open only to the members of the Senior English class.
2. The contest will close on April 25, 1916.
3. The essay entered in the contest is to be a discussion of Ruskin’s statement that “Shakespeare has no heroes; he has only heroines,” to be found in his essay on “Sesame and Lilies,” under “Lilies of the Queen’s Gardens.”

STUDENT BODY AND COUNCIL ELECTIONS

At a meeting of the Student Body on May 1st, the officers for the year 1916-17 will be elected. In the ten days following May 1st, the Councilmen will be elected. As provided by the Constitution, the above officers will go into office on the first day of the session of 1916-17. According to traditions as old as the college itself, campaigning for office is not countenanced on the Davidson campus, and each man registers his vote as his best judgment dictates. Fervid appeals from time to time in the past, for the political campaigning spirit which is found in some colleges, have met with no response and it is probable that the vote will continue to be that of individuals and not of groups.

SHAKESPEAREAN PAGEANT

On April 29th the Queens College girls and several of the Davidson students are to give a Shakespearean pageant in the Queens College auditorium. A great deal of attention is being given to details in costuming, since the whole performance is to be a series of tableaux. The characters which the Davidson boys will represent have not been definitely decided, but W. A. Dumas will probably be seen as “Prince Hal;” L. A. Mullen as “Shylock;” W. G. Morrison as “Shakespeare;” J. L. Payne as “Romeo,” and W. C. Copeland as “Falstaff.”

NEW Y. M. C. A. CABINET BEGINS YEAR'S WORK

At the meeting of the Y. M. C. A. on last Thursday night the new cabinet took charge of the work for the coming year. The aim and scope of the work of a college Y. M. C. A. was outlined by the incoming president and a plan proposed to give each member more individual work to do and thus increase the interest in Association affairs. Special music was rendered by several members of the orchestra and in the songs in the service the Alexander song books were used.

A moving picture show will be opened up in about ten days in the building below Long’s grocery store. This will be controlled by Messrs. Fetzer and Torrence. Work on the remodeling of the building is in progress, and the machine has already arrived. This building will seat about 500 people. Coach Fetzer announces that they intend to have a first-class house, showing the best films.

D. V. Hudson, '17, was in the infirmary last week with a slight attack of grippe.

W. G. Somerville, ex-’16, spent Sunday on the Hill.

Marvin Cooke, of Winecoff, won the broad jump. Very Earnhardt, Marvin Cooke, and Luther Barnhardt, of Winecoff, were winners of the relay race. The Winecoff High School, therefore, carried off the relay race cup, the trophy cup, and also all the individual medals in athletics.

DAVIDSON VICTORIOUS
(Continued from page 1)

unavoidably prevented from serving, the remaining three judges, Hons. J. P. Hollis, J. H. Marion, and E. R. Preston, constituted the committee. On account of the unfavorable weather, the attendance was not as large as expected. The Winthrop girls were present in large numbers and gave frequent and hearty applause to both teams. The instrumental and vocal music, including a selection by the Mandolin club; the efficient arrangement of the details for the debate by the chief marshal, Miss Louise McCown and her assistants; and the services of Professor Brown as presiding officer were appreciated by all and especially by the speakers. While in Rock Hill, the teams and the judges were entertained by the Rock Hill Chamber of Commerce. The hospitality and generosity of the Chamber of Commerce is appreciated by the debating teams of both colleges.

RED AND BLACK TEAM

close and interesting games. West is sponsor for the statement that he has the best team Trinity has turned out in years. The twirling staff is strong and the team is batting well. It has not been decided where tomorrow's game will be played, but it will probably fall to either Lenoir or Gastonia. The Statesville grounds are not available at this time. The game Friday will be played on the local diamond and will probably be the best game on the Hill this year.
