Wildcats Have Great Season in the Old Game of Ringing Basket

Win Ten of Thirteen Games, Seven of Them Played on the Other Fellow’s Court—Coach Hengeveld Due Much Credit.

The victory over Wake Forest on Monday night rang down the curtain on one of the most successful basketball seasons
that Davidson has seen in many years. The Red and Black Quintet has a record to be proud of and
one to be long remembered. Ten victories out of thirteen games, seven of which were played off the local floor,
is a summary of the season’s work. To Coach Hengeveld goes the lion’s share of the credit and praise for
the string of victories. Taking an exceptionally light team, in the course of a few weeks, he turned it into
one to be feared and dreaded throughout the entire state. His superb coaching is an asset any college should be
proud of, and Davidson is not slow to recognize the source of her standing in State basketball circles this year.
But the whole team worked together as never before to put Davidson on the basketball map. “One of the flashiest
teams seen in this neck of the woods this season,” was the tribute paid them by a prominent Spartanburg newspaper.
Teamwork was magnificent, the passing superb, and the shooting uncanny. Especially noticeable was the goal-finding ability of Crawford and Mauze.
Crawford’s long shots added many points to the season’s total while at the same time his opponent was practically unable
to ever get away from him for even a chance at the goal. Mauze’s tips and ability to follow up
long shots proved the downfall of several teams. Ormond, the lightweight forward, was always on the job. His short quick
shots went almost always true. Davis and Price played steady games at guard. Several Freshmen, namely, Mallory, Beall, Boggs, and
Staley, started on their way to athletic fame and ably demonstrated their ability in college basketball. Among those teams who
fell before the Wildcats' slaughter were: The Charlotte “Y,” Wofford (twice), N. C. State (twice), Trinity, Elon, Wake Forest (twice),
and Clemson. However, Trinity, Elon, and Guilford managed to turn the tables and emerged at the long end of the
final score, Guilford being the only team to shoot more field goals during a game than the Wildcats. The game
with Wake Forest on Monday night gave a good demonstration of the real Wildcat spirit which showed itself throughout the
season in the team’s scores. The season’s scores:

At Davidson, Charlotte “Y” 22; D. C. 44.
At Davidson, Wofford 21; D. C. 30.
At Davidson, State 22; D. C. 23.
At Durham, Trinity 22; D. C. 18.
At Raleigh, State 21; D. C. 25.

THE WILDCAT SCREAMS

Speeches, Juniors! Warm Up, Pitchers! Learn the Student Volunteers Going to N.C. C. W. for Meeting

Eleventh Annual Conference Begins in Greensboro on Friday.

The eleventh annual conference of the North Carolina Student Volunteer Union will be held at Greensboro on March 3rd, 4th,
and 5th. A representative number from every college in the state is expected to attend the conference. The foreign students
in the various institutions are especially invited to be present. Besides volunteers and foreign students, there are a great many
students who are interested in the volunteer work, or who would become interested if they were given the chance to
hear more about it. It is expected that many such students will also attend the meetings. This conference, though known
as a Student Volunteer Conference, is also a conference for non-volunteers. While the volunteers will gain from it great inspiration,
strength, and renewal of purpose, many non-volunteers will be led to find God's plan for their lives. The chief concern
of the conference is that every student possible be brought to a serious consideration of the question, “What is God’s
plan for my life?” The first meeting will be held in the Adelphian Society Hall of N. C. C. W.,
Friday afternoon, March 3rd, at 5:30 o'clock. This meeting will be a prayer service for the success of the conference.
After this, meetings will be held almost continuously until the following Sunday night. There will be three regular sessions each
day, morning, afternoon, and evening, and each delegate is invited to attend each meeting. It is the object of the
Exhibit Committee to make this feature of the conference the most interesting and helpful exhibit in the history of the
union. Each band will place many posters and curios on exhibit. The committee has prepared a series of printed posters
giving a short concise history of the North Carolina Union, showing the time, place, speakers, etc., of each former conference.
It is expected that one of the outstanding features will be a pageant, “The Two Masters,” which will be presented
by the Meredith Student Volunteer Band on Saturday evening. Davidson is looking for the conference to be one of the
best that has ever been held. The following men have signified their intention of attending it: W. T. Baker, R.
Bitzer, W. Z. Bradford, W. P. Brown, L. P. Burney, V. C. Hoye, T. F. Martin, F. S. Johnston, H.
O. Moss, A. M. McBryde, D. H. Ogden, J. L. Parks, G. E. Weeks, H. M. White, and A. C.
Wildman.

Mrs. Martin returned from Raleigh on Friday, bringing with her her son, W. J. Martin, Jr., who is recovering from
an attack of pneumonia.

Dr. J. M. McConnell spent last week in New York on business.

TRUSTEES DECIDE TWO NEW DORMITORIES ARE NEEDED

Authorize Additional Dormitory and Plan to Rebuild Chambers.

On the 22nd of February, the Board of Trustees, 25 in all, gathered at Davidson from all over the South
to discuss plans and improvements for the coming year. The trustees saw the college in session and favorable comments were
made on all sides at the way in which the work of the college has been carried on since the
loss of Chambers. Circumstances were such that this called meeting of the board was necessary, but it will not interfere
with its annual meeting at commencement. The trustees heartily endorsed the plans which have been made for the coming year
and decided that two dormitories instead of one should be erected by next September. These modern buildings will be well-equipped
in every respect and will more than care for the lost rooming space. They are to be located next to
Georgia and are to carry out the general idea of Dormitory Row. A new central heating plant is also to
be erected, which will call for another new building and this will be placed just to the rear of the
new dormitory. The above plans will use all available funds and no definite decision in regard to Chambers could be
reached as money will have to be raised before further work can be done. A committee was appointed to investigate
the advisability of a campaign for the required amount and their report will be turned in at commencement. The trustees
have undertaken their difficult task in the true Davidson spirit andFrom their plans for the coming year, it can be
readily seen that it will be the best in the history of the college.

“THE MICROBE OF LOVE” IS PRESENTED BY LOCAL FOLK.

With a cast composed of local talent, the musical comedy “The Microbe of Love” played and sang its way to
a happy and successful conclusion last Friday night in Shearer Hall. The play was given under the auspices of the
Davidson-Cornelius Post of the American Legion and was promoted by Harry Caldwell. The director was Miss Margaret Davison, of Atlanta.

After an opening song by the entire cast, the first act opened with a meeting of the Spinsters’ Club under
the presidency of Priscilla Prunes (Miss Willie Henderson). After singing the Spinsters’ hymn, reports were called for from each of
the members recounting their various adventures in the field of Cupid’s art, but few and despondent were the replies given.

After several songs by various members of the club, Madame Cupid (Miss Elizabeth Cranford), who was introduced, promised to inject
a microbe of love into these bachelors who would not give their heart and hand to one of the spinsters.
She guaranteed that this microbe, late from Paris, would work with telling effect on even the most stony-hearted bachelor.

Act two opened with a meeting of the Bachelors Club under the efficient leadership of Billie Bachelor (Tubby Woolfork). They
recounted tales delighting in their bachelorhood and each took the oath of “No Woman for Me.” Simon Shy (A. C.
Brown) was then voted into membership after taking a heart-rending oath. After this followed an ad- (Continued on page 3)

Wildcats Close Fine Season With Three Victories in Court Contests

Clemson and Wofford Defeated on the Road. Wake Forest Defeated in Hard-fought Game in Last Contest of Season.

Three victories in the past week brought to a close the best season in basketball that the Red and Black
has had for some time. Clemson and Wofford were beaten in their own lairs, and Wake Forest was taken into
camp on the local court.

Dr. J. M. Vander Meulen to Present Life-Work Call

President of Louisville Seminary is Well-equipped Leader.

Rev. John M. Vander Meulen, D.D., LL.D., who is president and professor of Sunday School Pedagogy, of Louisville Theological Seminary,
will begin Davidson's “Life-Work Campaign" March 8th.

Dr. Vander Meulen has had wide experience and is endowed with a wealth of knowledge. His grandfather was one of
the founders of the Free Church of Holland. He was also one of the chief leaders of the Great Dutch
Immigration of 1847, which is comparable with that of the Pilgrim Fathers of 1619. Dr. Vander Meulen’s father was a
prominent minister of the Dutch Reformed Church in Michigan, the state in which most of these immigrants settled, and was
noted for his scholarship, especially in Hebrew.

Dr. Vander Meulen has received his training at Hope College, Michigan, and at Princeton and McCormick Seminaries. He took graduate
work in psychology and philosophy at Columbia University. His ministry has been divided among several parts of the United States,
chiefly in the Dutch Reformed Church. For five years he was pastor of the Second Presbyterian Church, Louisville, and for
three years, of Oak Park Church, Chicago, before coming to the presidency of the seminary. He served his Alma Mater,
Hope College, for six years as professor. There, he has had thorough education and broad experience both as a pastor
and teacher.

Dr. Vander Meulen is a man of winning personality, a preacher of rare gifts, a teacher of wonderful magnetism. He
is an inspiring leader, and wields a strong and ever-increasing influence over young men, no matter what their station may
be. Under such excellent leadership, the “Life-Work Campaign” is expected to be a wonderful success.

SCANDINAVIAN ARTISTS TO GIVE IBSEN’S PLAY HERE

Two famous Scandinavian players are to appear here on March 13th or 14th in Ibsen’s great play, “Ghosts.” Madame Sorgny
Hamer, of the State Theatre, of Bergen, Norway, is one of the players; and Herr Fjilde, of the Royal Theatre,
in Christiania, is the other. They will be supported by an able cast of seven American artists. These two special
players come from Ibsen’s own old theatre to interpret him to America. The play, “Ghosts,” will be presented under the
auspices of the Dramatic Club. The company carries with it a carload of its own scenery and stage setting, and
it is believed that they can be well adapted to the stage in Shearer Hall.

The team played excellent ball in all these games.

Clemson Game.

“The Wildcats presented one of the flashiest teams seen in this neck of the woods this season.” This tribute from
the Greenville News in the write-up of the Tiger-Wildcat game shows exactly what kind of a Dynamite Five the old
Red and Black is boasting this year. With two games on the slate for the South Carolina trip, Captain Crawford
directed his huskies against the Clemson Tigers for first blood. When the Tiger met the Wildcat, the fur flew but
it was all from the back of the older sister. The Clemsonites were unable to oppose the flashy floor work
and caging abilities of the Presbyterians. Never had Tigertown seen such fast work as was exhibited by their visitors. They
were bewildered, startled, amazed; its sister, unable to wake up to the realization that they had hit the scrapping Wildcat
Quintet. The Tigers caged the first basket but this was soon overcome and the visitors surged steadily ahead. Especially in
the second half was the lead increased—not a single time was the victory in doubt.

Crawford and Mauze were the backbone of the Wildcat game. Their fast floor work and basket abilities enabled them to
pile up a total of 20 tallies between them. Ormond, Price, and Beall played their usual fine game. When the
whistle finally blew, the Wildcats had double the score of the Tigers, 32-16.

Summary:

Clemson (16) Davidson (32)
Day RF Ormond (2)
Bryan LF Beall (2)
Schilleter C Mauze (12)
