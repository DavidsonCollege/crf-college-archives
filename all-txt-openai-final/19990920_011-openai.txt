_THE DAVIDSONIAN_

@ The Student Health Advisors

By ELISABETH SMITH
Health Advisor

Recently, it was called to my attention that many people don’t know all the five Health Advisors, and so I thought I'd take the time to introduce us to the world. Jenny Hapgood, Seth Davis, Yolanda Kirby, Julia Philpott, and myself, Elisabeth Smith, make up the team committed to helping any (and every) Davidson student deal with health issues—alcohol, drugs, sexuality, birth control, STDs, depression, eating disorders, etc. You may be wondering how we can help you or why you should come to us. Before becoming Health Advisors, we all had to apply and interview and were chosen last spring for this year. During Orientation, we spent many exciting hours with Georgia (she needs only one name—if you don’t know who I’m talking about, go to the Health Center and find out) and received training in all the health issues I just mentioned. If we don’t know the answer to one of your questions, we definitely can find out and trust me, you can call any of us whenever you want—we want to talk to you!

Alright, introductions.... We have one senior this year, Yolanda Kirby, one junior, Jenny Hapgood, and three sophomores, Julia Philpott, Seth Davis, and me, Elisabeth Smith. Look at the picture above: Jenny is on the left side of the picture in the front, Julia is in the dead center, Seth is the only boy, Yolanda is in the back wearing a hat, and I’m peeking out between Jenny and Yolanda. We all participate in lots of activities on campus so I’ll give you some highlights.

Yolanda is one of the captains of the track team and babysits for almost every child in the Davidson area. Jenny is a Hall Counselor for the lucky girls on 4th Little, works in the writing center, and tries to ride her horse as much as she can. Julia is the president of the Davidson Dance Ensemble (if you see her standing on her face, don’t be scared) and wants to be a marriage counselor someday. Seth is an editor of the Davidsonian and volunteers for the Ada Jenkins Center. I’m involved with the Rape Awareness Committee and am the Chair of the Films Committee for the Union.

And here are some for you to guess: one of us had open heart surgery as a child, one of us has a webbed toe, one of us is talented with his/her tongue, one of us created some of the best Flickerball cheers ever, and one of us loves falafel.

“You (may) see us as you want to see us: in the simplest terms, in the most convenient definitions. But what we found out is that each one of us is a brain, and an athlete, and a basket case, a princess, and a criminal. Does that answer your question? Sincerely yours, The Breakfast Club.”
