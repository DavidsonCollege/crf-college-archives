In the Middest

Shadows shutter darkness

two lanes from the

interstate. Light brightens

coffee and cold fingers tapping

tables in a

Waffle House where

minutes ago black cars slid

five black mountebanks off to jail.

Apocalypse approaches here,

chaos masked in

microwaves, in Marlboros and

tarnished change. Some waitress with

too many imperfections for a

lover asks

“what do we want?”

Little.

Truckers ponder asphalt splashed by dashlight

lakes. Loneliness thinks

rape and pillage on the

road, wonders will he

hitchhike,

be a gentleman?

Some push “Out” doors into cold,

caffeine-warm as crankcase oil. Their

wagons cough. They

plunge,

schussing down the entrance ramps,

fearing dawn stabbing

stars somewhere behind their

wheels will launch itself from

mirror’s corners,

catch them.
