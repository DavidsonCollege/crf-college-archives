Working well into their schedule, the Wildcats have piled up eight games as the Davidsonian goes to press, bringing down
5 wins and 3 losses. Beginning with Kannapolis Y, the Cats proceeded to knock them off 76-46. Taking on Catawba,
the quintet rolled easily along to a 55-17 victory, then journeyed up to Asheboro to grab a sensational win from
the McCrary Eagles 59-58.

With the advent of Christmas Holidays, Coach Norman Sheppard took his boys down to the Wofford campgrounds and bit the
Terriers for a 55-30 decision. Though a fairly easy victory, it was costly in manpower with Earp suffering an ankle
injury and Williams developing a case of stomach ailment, which put both men on the bench for most of the
Ga.-Tech tilt in Atlanta the next night. Playing before a sparse crowd in the Tech Gymnasium, the Wildcats put up
a pesky and unrelenting offensive and defensive game but couldn’t overcome the height of Wes Paxon and ended up on
the little end of a 41-55 score.

Back at Davidson, the quintet again engaged the Eagles from Asheboro, bettering them by 58-47, then sallied up to Winston-Salem
to take on the Duke Blue Devils. The Blue Devils came out on top by 55-47. Then back in Charlotte
before a record crowd, the Wildcats chased N. C. State ragged for the entire 40 minutes but could not outdo
a five-point final lead. The ending tally was 93-48 for the State cagers.

HERE AND THERE

Babe Ruth, baseball’s famed sultan of swat, was reported in serious condition in French Hospital, New York, and it seemed
Monday that he might have to undergo an operation. The Babe has been under treatment for some weeks with a
serious throat infection. The moon-faced slugger, whose $80,000 salary in 1930 and 1931 never has been equaled, still holds the
all-time major league home run record with 60 in 1927. His Riverside Drive apartment is cluttered with baseball mementos, and
he remains the idol of the youngsters when he attends a ball game, but he'd trade it all for a
chance to manage in the big leagues.

Charlie Trippi, hero of the much-disputed Sugar Bowl game, is being heavily and hotly pursued by the Pro mentors. Last
rumor was a $60,000 offer from the New York Yankees of the All-America Conference.

Wildcat Around The Conference

N.C. State's slim lead in the Southern Conference will be challenged Saturday night when the Red Terror quintet meets a
potent Blue Devil five. Meanwhile, Carolina is taking somewhat less than its pre-season billing as a result of three games
lost so far. Davidson, having already lost to State and Duke, may yet get back into the running after a
week and a half exam period breather.

State, whose squad is composed mostly of freshmen, has several of the most productive scorers in the state—Dick Dickey, second
only to our own Ed White in his all-game average; Pete Negley, who ranks fourth in total points scored in
conference games; Bartels, who is ninth in Conference totals; and Charley Stine, who racked 22 against Clemson the other night.
Alternating for the high-scoring slot, any one of these four can have an off night without handicapping the team too
much.

Duke Shows Strength

Duke took to the East recently and showed their strength by beating Temple 59-56, although they lost in the second
overtime to N.Y.U. by three points. With no outstanding scorers, the Blue Devils still seem to get the buckets in
sufficient numbers to cause their opponents too much misery. It remains to be seen how they will stack up against
State’s flashy boys Saturday night at Durham.

Carolina, with three lettermen from last year’s five and two of that squad’s outstanding subs seeing most of the action,
has fallen far off of pre-season expectations by already losing three collegiate contests. This is one more than Carolina lost
all season last year, and they face another possible defeat at the hands of N.Y.U. as this article is in
the making.

Ed White now holds the scoring lead for the state with a 14.2 average per game played but ranks only
sixth place in total number of Conference tallies. Meanwhile, Davidson has ceased all hardwood activities until after exams.

VMI Downs Mat Team

In their initial match of the season, Davidson's wrestlers were out-pinned and out-pointed to the count of 36-0 by the
Keydets of V.M.I. last Saturday night in Lexington, Va. Of the 8 matches, 6 were won by pinning and 2
by decisions.

The Duke Blue Devils were entertained here Tuesday afternoon, and the grapplers of the University of North Carolina will tangle
on the local mat next Saturday. Coach Charles Parker, manager John Adams, and an 8-man team made the Virginia trip.
The men, their weight class, and outcome of their bout are as follows:

Carlisle Moore, 121, pinned
Bill Pruitt, 128, pinned
Rufus Long, 136, pinned
Bill Fesperman, 145, pinned
W. P. Walker, 155, pinned
J. P. Walker, 165, decision
Bill Alexander, 175, decision
Dick Easley, unlimited, pinned

Other contenders for future starting spots are Dick O’Hair, unlimited, and W. B. McCall, 145.

Remember this seal—it’s your assurance of the best.

Lead

Ted White, co-captain of the Wildcat cage team, is Southern Conference high-scoring ace in average number of points per game,
it was revealed by conference officials last week. White's average is 14.13 points. Second high scorer in the conference is
Dick Dickey of N.C. State with 14.03 points per game. White, who scored 13 points against Duke and 18 against
highly touted State, is playing his last year of college ball, having played three years for Davidson as well as
for several army teams. A married student and member of ODK, national leadership fraternity, he hopes to teach and coach
basketball after graduation.

National Leaders

In the nation, other conferences throughout college quintets were undefeated at last weekend. Perched atop the group was Seton Hall,
in New Jersey, with a string of 13 wins. Other unbeaten teams include Marshall, Duquesne, University of Washington, and Lawrence,
with 11 victories each; Georgia Tech, with nine; Rhode Island State, Wheaton, and Mankato Teachers, with eight each; West Virginia
and Alabama with seven; Washington and Jefferson, Washington and Lee, and Bucknell, with four each; and Army with two. Washington
and Lee, in Lexington, Va., is the only unbeaten Southern Conference squad. Among an imposing list of one-beaten teams were
Kentucky, Iowa, Michigan, Purdue, Texas, Louisiana State, Tennessee, Syracuse, New York University, Colgate, Navy, Pennsylvania; and in the Southern Conference,
V.P.I., also in Lexington, Va. Davidson's record stands as five wins and three losses, to Duke, State, and Georgia State.
The Wildcats' next conference game is against South Carolina in Charlotte on January 29.

Juniors Drop Two

Off to a slow start, Coach Mel Means’ Jay Vee squad dropped their first scrap to Brevard 37-42. Hopper and
Roddey topped the scoring for the Kittens with 7 points each, Richardson was second with 6 points. The Jay quintet
downed Mars Hill in a tight 34-33 engagement, but went on to lose to Lees-McRae a few nights later 33-30.
Coach Means has put his squad through the paces for the last few days, smoothing them up for the tilt
with Presbyterian J.C., which will be played before the Davidsonian hits the stands. The Kittens looked good in night scrimmage
work-out and, barring injury, should be in good shape for the Presbyterians. Showing well in previous action, Joe Warner, Richardson,
Hopper, and Roddey are developing and should be ready for varsity work next year.

Rifle Team

Davidson’s sharpshooting R.O.T.C. rifle team was narrowly nosed out with a score of 875 to 855 by the eagle-eyed cadets
of Oak Ridge Military Academy in a shoulder-to-shoulder match held in the Davidson armory December 14. Hitting the bull’s eye
for top honors of the day was Nolan of Oak Ridge, whose tally of holes in the target added up
to 182 points. Highest man of the hosts was P.P. Heaton, who turned in 178 points. The five high men
on the Oak Ridge team placing in the competition were Nolan, Cranford, Sarber, Braxton, and Zwicky. Wildcat placers were Deaton,
McDaniels, Cottey, Walker, and Long. Recovering from their close defeat in the first match of the season, Davidson’s rifle men
have already shown much improvement, according to Master Sergeant C.B. Burton, coach of the team, and they exhibit determination to
win their future matches.

Greek Cagers Resume Tilts

With vacation over, the Greeks returned to their alma mater to recover. Possibly a good hint as to how the
recovery has come along can be seen in a few of the basketball scores registered. The K.A.’s, king-pins of the
football world, weren't doing so well, with one win as against two losses. At the top of the pile were
the Betas and the S.A.E.’s with three wins and no losses apiece. Right behind them were the Phi Gams and
the Pi Kapps with two wins and no losses. Last Monday, the Betas registered their third victory by toppling the
Phi Delts in a 29-18 win. And last week, it was the S.A.E.’s and the Independents who came out on
top, the former downing the K.A.’s in a 26-21 battle, while the Independents fought to a close 26-25 decision over
the Kappa Sigs. As this sheet goes to press, the scoreboard stands as follows:

| Team | Won | Lost |
|---------------|-----|------|
| Betas | 3 | 0 |
| S.A.E.’s | 3 | 0 |
| Phi Gams | 2 | 0 |
| Pi Kapps | 2 | 0 |
| D.P.B.’s | 1 | 1 |
| K.A.’s | 1 | 2 |
| Independents | 1 | 2 |
| Vikas | 0 | 1 |
| Kappa Sigs | 0 | 3 |
| Phi Delts | 0 | 3 |
