Men’s Tennis Gains Momentum

By WHIT WILKS

The men’s tennis team continued its winning ways this past week, running the season record to 14-6. On Friday, Coach
Frank’s crew laid one on those who are used to being indoors on days such as this one. Due to
a scheduling conflict which saw the women’s team at home as well, the match was played outside on the hard
surface. Coach Frank explains, “We have a policy that whichever team comes from farther away to play, that team gets
priority in courts. The women got to play inside because Raleigh (home of Peace College, the women’s opponent) is farther
than Chapel Hill.”

Harvard men in an 8-1 walloping. This was The Crimson’s “B” team, comprised of the 7th through 12th seeds, but
the victory was impressive nonetheless. The next day, the Cats proved that A.C.C. schools can be beaten, as they won
a tight 6-3 match over N.C. State. The Wolfpack, laden with foreign talent, was humbled in what Coach Frank described
as a tremendous win. Davidson took 4 of 6 singles and 2 of 3 doubles in the match. On Monday,
the winning only continued in a 9-0 drubbing of Belmont-Abbey. The Cats clearly were in a different class than “The
Abbey” on this day.

Tuesday, the team played another A.C.C. competitor as they hooked up with the U.N.C. Tar Heels. Cold, windy conditions played
havoc with the Cats, and it would have been nice to play the Heels under better conditions, given the Cats'
outstanding recent performances. However, the Cats succumbed to conditions and the superior Tar Heels, losing the match 8-1.

The team defeated U.N.C.C. on Wednesday 5-4 despite losing 4 of 6 singles matches and is set to begin conference
play next week. Frank noted that the next two weeks will go a long way in determining the Cats' conference
standing.
