Union Café proposes allowing late-night employees to drink

Union Café employees have been complaining of mistreatment by drunken students during their late evening shifts. Some have suggested a pay increase for nighttime managers to compensate for having to deal with inebriated customers. Others, however, propose a different theory: Let them drink beer.

Advocates for the proposal, headed by Mark Lee ’08, suggest that the Union enact a new policy that pays evening workers four beers per hour in addition to their regular salary. This untaxed alcohol stipend should provide just the buzz necessary to facilitate a healthy work environment, they said.

Lee says the only reasonable solution to an alcohol-induced problem is an alcohol-induced response. “For the most part, Davidson students are a courteous, friendly and compassionate bunch,” said Lee. “Unfortunately, this same group of cheerful undergraduates by day becomes an intolerable throng of khakied menaces by night. They consume cheap alcohol like a vampire does blood and devour quesadillas like a zombie does brains.”

Confrontations such as these between students and café employees have led to the ‘Let them drink beer’ proposal. Scientific studies show that a worker’s response to a drunken customer tends to be less dramatic as their own alcohol intake increases. The alcohol has a tendency to smooth tensions that may otherwise arise if the employee were sober.

Melissa Hernandez of the UCLA School of Inebriated Response explained this phenomenon. “The problematic communication barrier that alcohol erects between the irresponsibly drunken consumer and the frightened and disgusted Union Café worker is not uncommon,” said Hernandez. “But we have found that a drunken worker can offset this unfavorable relationship. The employee that was once insulted by the sight of a pants-less sophomore demanding more sour cream for his quesadilla will now be too drunk to take offense. Most inebriated workers will either provide the student with the requested sour cream or angrily demand that the student get out of their apartment.”

Supporters claim that the proposal will not only make student-worker interactions more enjoyable, but that they will also provide a bit of retributive justice for the Union Café staff. They say it would be delicious irony to watch an out-of-control undergrad’s screams for a slice of pizza be answered by a Café worker handing that student a buttered apple and demanding to be paid in stamps.

While the Café’s labor organization, the Union Union, is in favor of the late-night alcohol proposal for workers, management is less enthusiastic. “I’m just not sure we’re all comfortable with a scenario in which both parties involved may be too drunk to complete..."Basic transactions," said Union Café owner, Mitch Robinson. "Orders are constantly mishandled or misread when both parties are sober. What will happen when alcohol enters the equation?"

The Union disagrees. This alcohol stipend should provide just the buzz necessary for a healthy work environment. "Come on, let us drink beer while we work," said Union representative Bill Virgil.

The Union Café is still considering the alcohol proposal as a solution, along with alternative payment structures or simply ignoring the problem.

### Roadtripping? Wildcat Basketball Fans’ Guide to Dayton, OH

**Dayton General Store:** Have a hankering for some peanuts? Or maybe your throat is parched and in need of a good soda pop? Be sure to stop by the Dayton General Store, one of the oldest buildings in Dayton. In addition to convenience food items, the store also carries a wide variety of novelty magic tricks and some of those games where you have to move pegs around. The General Store is located adjacent to the BP gas station.

**Cox Arboretum and Gardens MetroPark:** The MetroPark is where most Dayton residents hang out and walk around when there is nothing else to do. You'll find the walking trails in the Arboretum well-beaten and very pleasant, especially in the spring. There are also numerous benches for sitting and reading news about the rest of the country. Good luck finding an open seat, though!

**CVS Pharmacy:** While the locals in Dayton would ask you to support the local establishments, such as the General Store, the prices at CVS will be hard to beat. Red and white face paint will be 30 percent off for the game, and there are rumors that SGA is working on getting the CVS in Dayton to accept CatCards!

**Dayton Metro Library:** Will the long trip to Dayton set you behind in some of your schoolwork? Never fear, the Dayton Metro Library is here (in Dayton, that is). With ample table room and an almost complete collection of the Hardy Boys mysteries, the Metro Library is an ideal study location (without that annoying green carpet!).

**Boonshoft Museum of Discovery:** If you’re in the mood for some discovery, head on over to the Boonshoft Museum of Discovery in downtown Dayton. We are lucky: the museum’s most popular exhibit to date, "Pictures of Dinosaur Fossils from Other Museums," will be leaving after this week, so be sure to visit it while you can.

**Bennigans:** For four-star food with service to match, Bennigans is the place to eat during your stay in Dayton. They even have a diverse dessert menu and domestic beers on tap. Be sure to get there early, though. They don’t take reservations, and Bennigans is easily the hottest restaurant in town!

**Aviation Hall of Fame:** Although the Wright brothers tested and flew their first planes in North Carolina, they were originally from Dayton! Since this makes Dayton the logical "Birthplace of Aviation," the city has the most important two-room aviation museum in the country. Be sure to visit their newest exhibit, "Pillows the Wright Brothers Once Slept Upon."

**Dayton Municipal Coliseum:** Easily the largest structure in all of Dayton, the Coliseum is where all the action will be happening this week. Although it hasn’t been renovated since it was built in 1967, the Coliseum still easily passes most safety regulations and offers a variety of food and merchandise vendors. Davidson students will find their seats in section 398 of the upper deck behind the large ESPN advertisement banner.
