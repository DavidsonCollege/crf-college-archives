### DAVIDSON PERSPECTIVES

**President too slow on Afghanistan**

Barack Obama has been President of the United States for two hundred and eighty-eight days. In that time span, he has played twenty-four rounds of golf, attended twenty-three Democratic fundraisers, and made zero decisions on Afghanistan. Do I care about how many times the President has birdied the third hole or the length of his vacation? No, but I do care about our soldiers fighting for our freedoms abroad.

Repeatedly, Obama has declared Afghanistan a war of necessity. However, as is the case with most of his presidency, the difference between rhetoric and action is vast. The first responsibility given to the President in the Constitution is the command of the armed forces. As Commander in Chief, he must lead, which means actually making a decision. This is not a decision he can just punt. His current limbo position does not fulfill his duty. Afghanistan will not just disappear. The situation will not improve if he waits it out. It requires a decision from the head of the world’s last superpower.

Every single day the President fails to make a decision, he hurts our efforts and adds to the casualty count. Indecision does not exactly send local tribal leaders into our arms. It is tough to back the strong horse if you are unsure it will finish the race. The tribal leaders know if they side with the United States who then exits, their tribes will be the first to suffer at the hands of the Taliban. Understandably, the tribal leaders have no reason to believe we are prepared to empty the clip for them. It is not only the Afghans who are losing faith but also our own soldiers. Reports of low morale should concern all Americans. No matter the time, the place, or the enemy, our soldiers should know the President and the country stand firmly behind them.

**Sincerely, Bobby DesPain**

Does the president understand this? I hope he is beginning to. While I am not a fan of the cameras at Dover Air Force Base, I was glad to see the president receiving the fallen soldiers. The president needs to be faced with the realities of his decisions as well as show his respect and support to the men and women keeping the Stars and Bars flying proud. Even if the event was precipitated by the need for good PR (it does have that particular beat of an Axelrod/Emanuel/Jarrett media dance), the image of flag-draped caskets hopefully strikes the heart and mind of Barack Obama.

We speak of winning the hearts and minds of local populations, but the real question is whether or not we have the heart and mind of our president. Does he see a future for a democratic Afghanistan, free from the brutality of the Taliban and Al-Qaeda? Does he have the utmost confidence in his commanders and his soldiers? More than anything, our soldiers need a president with steel in his blood vessels and fire in his heart. I am not concerned with President Barack Obama, the great uniter, the great orator, the man of hope and change: I care about President Barack Obama, Commander in Chief of the United States Military. Can he live up to that title?

Last week, the President declared he “will never rush the solemn decision” to send soldiers to combat. I would hope so, but we are not operating from square one. In over eight years, we have lost the lives of nine hundred and nine soldiers and spent billions of dollars. Our soldiers are already in harm’s way and passing through Death’s door. Without a decision, the President is leaving our soldiers in limbo. No matter how politicians try to spin it, war ends in two ways: victory or defeat. The president has to decide what will define his presidency. Does he want to be a Chamberlain and give up the Sudetenland or does he want to be a Churchill and pledge to never “flag or fail?”

### Davidson’s role in World War II

**Leo R. Kubeska — Guest Columnist**

Next Wednesday is Veterans Day, making it a good time to reflect on Davidson’s role in helping bring victory to World War II. Perhaps a little-known fact is that some 65 years ago, Davidson College trained aviation cadets to start them on their way to become pilots, navigators, and bombardiers. For a fourteen-month period, from March of 1943 through June 1944, many hundreds of American boys started their military training, including college courses, here at Davidson. I know because I was one of them.

History tells us that our country, along with our allies, won World War II decisively. Davidson College and its staff played a role in that historic victory. I have a special place in my heart and memories of my three months at Davidson College, both because of the beautiful campus as well as the friendly townspeople and the college staff. I arrived there with 500 others in March of 1943 and left in June for more training in Nashville. The entire detachment occupied the east and west dorms. I was in room 207 of the east dorm along with three others as we were grouped alphabetically.

Prior to World War II, the Army Air Corps (later renamed the US Air Force) accepted only those candidates for pilot training that had completed two years of college. Early in the war, however, the need for pilots grew, and the Air Corps lowered the requirement for those with high school diplomas who could pass a battery of competence tests. To fill the educational gap, the Air Corps selected a number of colleges for a training program they called the College Training Detachment. Davidson College was awarded a contract in early 1943 to house and give educational and physical training to hundreds of pre-Aviation Cadets. Among the subjects taught were math, science, history, civil air regulations, and first aid. Additionally, each student was given four hours of air training in Piper Cubs at nearby Cannon Field.

Each day we formed in military formation in a large cleared area in front of the dorms, heard the orders of the day, and marched off to mess, which was served in the college dining room. This was followed by...Physical education under the supervision of the college PT staff and then classes in the Chambers building, taught by the college’s professors. We were expected to conduct ourselves as West Point Cadets both in military bearing and in discipline, spending a great deal of time in military formations, marching and parades. We often had parades along Main Street in Davidson and then down past the dorms to the stadium infield where we conducted ceremonial and military formations and drills. After the first two months at Davidson, much to my surprise, I was asked to become student captain of the entire detachment under the supervision of our commissioned CO, Major Bonner. That put me in charge of all formations, orders of the day, discipline, attendance, and daily reports. For a rookie soldier with only a couple of months of training, I was quite overwhelmed. Amongst my records is a memo from Major Bonner that reads as follows: “Please announce to the A/C students that a performance of HMS Pinafore by Gilbert and Sullivan will be given Saturday night, May 29, 1943, at 8 pm in the Chambers Building. Admission price is $0.50. All A/C students are invited to attend.” It was a big event for the entertainment-starved troops. Perhaps the highlight of our stay at Davidson College took place at Fireman’s Hall in Charlotte in April 1943. This very special event brought several hundred aviation students, as well as girls from Queens College, together for a dance. Davidson College was male only then, so most of us had not even seen a girl for at least five weeks. Dance music was provided by Buck Asher’s band. At midnight, we went back to our buses for the 20-mile journey back to campus. Sadly, no one could take his dance partner home. Training to become a cadet and pilot was largely about being instilled with military discipline. Our student officers freely handed out demerits for the smallest offenses, violations, and acts of misconduct. The officers would wear white gloves and run their fingers over a door or window ledge looking for dust, check that our ashtrays were empty, or make sure that our beds were tidy. I was once given demerits for a minor infraction, and, as a consequence, I had to spend four hours walking around the stadium track on a Saturday. It was drizzling that day, only adding to my bad luck. Upon departure and final graduation, the detachment of aviation students established the following creed: “Sadly glancing backward at Davidson, we see America itself: freedom, Christianity, education, and a wholesome hospitable way of life. With the utmost appreciation for what Davidson College has given us, we continue in quest of our wings with renewed vigor and a more complete confidence in ourselves and what we are fighting for.” My stay at Davidson College was, in retrospect, enlightening and enjoyable, especially in comparison to the tough nine months of pilot training that followed. The professors and trainers were great and the college facilities were outstanding. Upon leaving Davidson, I was sent to Nashville for a month of physical and psychological training to determine if I was qualified for pilot training. I went on to become a B-24 Liberator (4-engine) bomber pilot. I was stationed in Italy during World War II. And it all started at beautiful Davidson College. Leo R. Kubeska is a World War II veteran.

“Deliberations that started soon after President Obama’s inauguration will hopefully come to an end in the next two months. However, when the dust settles, the members of the 111th Congress will be more than halfway through their terms and will have spent the majority of their time debating one key issue. My fear is that our leaders are squandering the best chance that America has had in years to completely overhaul the multiple federal initiatives that have been in desperate need of modernization for decades. Eighteen-month syndrome may set in. One easy way to look at the effectiveness of a Presidential administration’s domestic policy success is to judge what happens in the first eighteen months. After that, members of Congress (except for 66 or 67 Senators) will be running for re-election and after an the White House. While the time spent on the health care debate is certainly well spent, I feel as though the United States has become too focused on one single issue. The trouble is there are so many other issues that Congress can try to synthesize all at once. The Obama administration has taken on a very ambitious agenda that hinges on Congress’s ability to act quickly to solve major issues. The Democrats are being hindered by a lockstep Republican organization and are unable to pass all of their goals. Splits in the Democratic Party, the rifts between the strong liberal and conservative members have posed additional obstacles to completing an already ambitious agenda. Congress will better serve the national interest by tackling many major issues at once. Our country is still plagued by a lack of environmental policy, a lack of energy policy, a lack of education reform, and two ongoing wars with the possibility of a third. The point is that some of the 535 voting members of Congress need to begin to seriously work on bills besides health care. That debate is important but not all-consuming. Members need to champion other issues and force them onto the national agenda. Congress will better serve the national interest by tackling many major issues at once. This will also prove to be good politics for the Democrats as they move towards the midterms next Election Day. Creating good policy is the best counterattack to the pundits and politicians who are making critical noise. Creating policy is no easy task, and constituents will feel like their representatives are working hard to serve their interests in Washington D.C. Last January, when President Obama took office, the proverbial train looked like it was leaving the station. Now that train has stalled. Our leaders need not only to get that train back on track but also to force an ambitious national agenda through the United States’ most convoluted institution, Congress.”
