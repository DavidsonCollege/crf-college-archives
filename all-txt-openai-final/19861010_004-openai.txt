**Icelandic meeting begins, Soviet sub sinks**

By DAVID WILLIAMS

**Around the World:**

Senior administration officials said President Reagan will hold firm to current American positions in the Geneva arms talks and does
not plan to introduce new proposals at his meeting this weekend with Soviet leader Mikhael Gorbachev in Reykjavik, Iceland. Administration
officials said the U.S. may exceed the SALT II treaty limit for cruise missiles as early as November 11. House
majority leader Jim Wright said House Democrats would delay a resolution of arms-control issues to avoid tying Reagan’s hands before
the mini-summit.

A Soviet nuclear submarine carrying 16 ballistic missiles and a crew of 120 caught fire and sank Monday in the
Atlantic, about 1200 miles east of New York. Three Soviets died in the fire, but the remainder of the crew
was rescued by Soviet ships nearby.

The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence charged that Vladimir Kolesnikov, who is assistant to the Secretary General of the United
Nations, is a Soviet intelligence officer. U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar defended his assistant and called on the
Senate committee to prove its charges.

The Soviet Union said it would begin pulling out between 6,000 and 7,000 troops from Afghanistan next Wednesday. U.S. Defense
Secretary Caspar Weinberger said the Soviet pullout represented a “ruse” to make it appear that the force in Afghanistan was
being reduced, as American intelligence picked up signs that 6,000 troops were moving into Afghanistan a few weeks ago.

Soviet dissident Yuri Orlov arrived in New York with his wife Monday. American cancer researcher Arnold Lockshin said Wednesday on
Soviet television that he had emigrated to the Soviet Union because of “persecution” in the United States.

American hostages Terry Anderson and David Jacobsen, who have been held by Shiite extremists in Lebanon since early 1985, appealed
to President Reagan on a videotape to work as hard to free them as it did to free Nicholas Daniloff.
Reagan responded that there was no comparison between the Lebanon hostages and the Daniloff case.

Nicaraguan armed forces shot down an American-built cargo plane in southern Nicaragua Sunday. Three people were killed in the crash,
but an American survived and was taken prisoner by the Nicaraguan government, who charged that the plane was operated by
the C.I.A. American officials said the plane was operated by a private group of American supporters of the Nicaraguan rebels.

The Polish government Friday declared a council formed last week by former underground Solidarity activists illegal. The government ordered Solidarity
leader Lech Walesa and four other dissidents to report to authorities for questioning.

Pope John Paul II visited Lyon, France and called on all groups at war and all terrorists to halt hostile
action for one day and reflect on why they resort to violence. The Pope also acknowledged that the church is
facing a tremendous shortage of priests, which poses a danger to the vitality of Catholicism.

P.L.O. chief Yasir Arafat said the P.L.O. will move its military headquarters from Tunis to Yemen and Iraq. Shiite Moslem
militiamen from the Amal movement battled with Palestinians for six straight days, until a cease-fire was announced Sunday. Sunni Sheik
Sobhi al-Saleh, who was the spiritual head of the Lebanese Sunni community, was assassinated Tuesday in Beirut.

Iraqi planes bombed residential areas in Kut, Iraq, while Iranian artillery fire pounded the city of Basra, as eight civilians
were killed and thirty-three wounded. Iraqi planes virtually wiped out Iran’s capacity to export oil from Kharg Island in the
Persian Gulf.

The Senate, following the House, voted 78-21 to override President Reagan’s veto of legislation imposing stiff economic sanctions on South
Africa. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee unanimously approved the nomination of Edward J. Perkins to be U.S. Ambassador to South
Africa. South Africa announced plans to repatriate thousands of Mozambican workers in retaliation for purported guerrilla attacks across the Mozambique-South
Africa border by Mozambican rebels.the African National Congress. Amadou-Mahtar M’Bow of Bebegel, who is director of the 159-nation United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), announced he would not run for a third six-year term of office. U.S. state
and federal officials arrested three men in Texas who identified themselves as members of the Mexican Federal Judicial Police and
charged them with kidnapping seven American citizens. Mexico denied the charges.

Across the Nation: A Washington Post article said the Reagan administration has devised a policy to leak to the press
false information designed to convince Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi that his country is about to be attacked by the U.S.
or overthrown by a coup. State Department spokesman Bernard Kalb resigned his post to protest “the reported disinformation program.” The
Senate Friday approved by a 73-13 margin a record $558 billion appropriations bill for 1987 that includes increased aid to
the Philippines and millions of dollars in assistance to drought-stricken farmers. While House and Senate conferees were negotiating a final
version of the bill, both Houses approved a two-day stop-gap spending bill to keep the government running through today. The
House and Senate voted to approve a compromise bill that would strengthen the nation’s toxic waste law and provide $9
billion for cleaning up the nation’s waste sites over the next five years. Advisors urged President Reagan to veto the
bill because it calls for new taxes on corporate earnings and crude oil.

Torrential rains and flooding rivers forced more than fifteen thousand people in parts of Oklahoma, Kansas, Illinois, and Michigan to
evacuate their homes. Many were able to return home after several days. NASA said Friday the first space shuttle flights
since the Challenger disaster will begin February 18, 1988. A three-day walkout by 30,000 dockworkers from Maine to Virginia ended
Friday when management agreed to extend an expired contract and continue talks. Ten key associates of Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr.
were indicted Monday on Federal fraud and conspiracy charges after a raid on the political extremist’s headquarters in Virginia. The
number of crimes committed against individuals and households last year fell by 700,000, or 1.9 percent, from a year ago.
An internal audit reported that the Navy lost track of almost $320 million in aviation spare parts aboard its aircraft
carriers last year.

In Business News: Ministers from OPEC began an emergency meeting Monday in Geneva to seek a credible oil-price-support agreement. Saudi
Arabia’s oil minister called for a return to OPEC’s firm production and pricing system, suggesting a marker of $17 to
$19 a barrel for crude. The nation’s unemployment rate climbed 0.2 percent in September, to 6.9 percent. The average rate
on fixed-rate mortgage loans fell sharply in September from 10.84 percent to 10.5 percent. The Federal Reserve Board said Americans
took out $3.74 billion more in consumer credit than they paid off in August, the smallest increase in consumer debt
since March. Japan suspended its import tariff on U.S. cigarettes and tobacco products, ending a year-long unfair trade practices case
brought by the U.S. The First Interstate Bancorp of Los Angeles made a formal offer to take over the BankAmerica
Corporation, the giant California bank that has been staggered by huge loan losses. The nation’s automakers said Ford’s Escort was
America’s best-selling U.S.-made car in the 1986 model year. Domestic car manufacturers closed their books Friday with sales down 3.9
percent from the previous model year.
