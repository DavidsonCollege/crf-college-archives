**The Davidsonian, January 22, 1919**

**DAVIDSON SOCIAL ITEMS.**

**MUCH PEP DISPLAYED.**

Miss Eloise Martin, of Queens College, had as her house guests for the weekend, Miss Helen Ragan, of Gastonia, and Miss Eunice Blue, of Rayford, N.C.

Mrs. Addison Brenizer and little son, Addison, Jr., have been guests of Dr. and Mrs. Martin for the past week.

Rev. Mr. Ormond, who has just returned from overseas, where he has been engaged in “Y” service, lectured to the Book Club, Friday afternoon. The meeting was held at the home of Mrs. J. M. McConnell, and a good attendance was there to hear him.

Miss Elizabeth Grey, who attended Peace Institute, Raleigh, N.C., last fall, will not return for the spring term. She will continue her studies at home.

Miss Mildred Johnston, who has been teaching in Shelby, N.C., this year, will be at home until February 1, on account of the “flu” quarantine at that place.

Miss Orrie Steele spent the weekend at her home in Rock Hill.

Mrs. H. B. Arbuckle, who has been suffering with rheumatism since the holidays, is much improved.

Misses Mary Matthews, Dorothy Dawson, and Mildred Smith were guests of the Bachelors on Monday evening.

**EUMENEANS UNEARTH OLD EASTERN CUSTOMS**

**FIVE SUNDAY SCHOOLS TAUGHT BY STUDENTS**

The mission Sunday schools of the Davidson Y.M.C.A. are to be reopened as soon as the “flu” situation will permit. At present, the health authorities will not allow any large gatherings. All plans for the work have already been made. Some of these Sunday Schools have their own superintendents. For these, the Y.M.C.A. appoints a leader to help with the work. For others, it appoints a superintendent. The schools with their leaders or superintendents are as follows:

- Cowan's School House — K. A. Woods, superintendent
- Oak Grove — O. P. Hart, superintendent
- Shearer Chapel — A. M. Mitchell, leader
- Brawley’s — E. Flinn, superintendent
- Cornelius — W. B. Sullivan, leader
- Caldwell — S. H. Askew, superintendent

Another Sunday school is to be organized in the mill with D. W. Roberts as leader under the supervision of Messrs. F. L. Jackson and “Bob” Miles.

INTEREST INCREASES IN BIBLE CLASSES

The Bible classes conducted by the “Y” have struck a popular note on the campus, and in spite of that tired feeling “of the morning after the night before,” the fellows continue to increase the number of each class. Last week Rumple led the campus by having seventy-three per cent of her supporters in Bible classes. South wing Chambers came second with fifty-one per cent, with Watts close at her heels, being represented by forty-eight per cent. Then came North wing Chambers with thirty-one per cent, and straggling way behind was Georgia with only twenty-two per cent. Who will lead next week? With the spirit that has been shown already, there is no doubt that these classes will increase in popularity, and the motto “Have you joined?” will be no longer necessary.

PHI SOCIETY

If the cap fits, put it on! Program for January 25—Class 1: Affirmative: G. D. Sample, W. T. Dunlap. Negative: T. R. Alexander, H. C. Hamilton. Declamations: Poteat, J. T. Story. Extemporaneous debate: Affirmative, Calhoun; Negative, Spence.

Lieut. T. B. McCormick has received his discharge and has returned to North Carolina A. and E. to resume his studies.

The following space is lovingly dedicated to the Reporters and Staff men who show so much interest in their Davidsonian work that they completely forget about their assignments or else hand in articles that have to be re-written entirely: Banner, G. N. Neel, E. H. Tufts, S. E. Howie, J. G. Sloan, J. L. Nisbet, D. W. Lowrance, T. A. Wooten, Alban Rogers, H. R. Poole, R. H. Poole, J. A. Wool, E. G. Cashion, D. R. LaFar, Jr. These names are copied even as they were written by the trembling Freshmen, and any mistakes can be attributed to their inability to write legibly. The names of their “lady loves” will be published in a later issue.
