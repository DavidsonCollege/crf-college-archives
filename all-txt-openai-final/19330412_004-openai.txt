4 THE DAVIDSONIAN, APRIL 12, 1933

Literary Societies In Weekly Meetings

Members of the Eumenean Literary Society enjoyed a most profitable evening last Tuesday, April 4. Prayer was led by Bill
Ward. Jack Williams gave a very illuminating book review on “Scientific Disarmament” by Victor Lefebure. A very informative talk, aptly
entitled “Current Events in Nature,” was given by Bill Ward. This described the habits of birds and other small denizens
of our woodlands. There followed an open forum on the subject, “Resolved: That the press is more powerful than the
radio in forming public opinion.” Rufus Morrow and Gordon Wood took the affirmative, while John Richards and Bill Singleton upheld
the negative. After a most interesting debate and discussion, the affirmative was declared the winner. At the completion of the
program, Stuart Henry gave a very carefully prepared and helpful criticism of the speakers.

A very important business session occupied the attention of members of the Phi Society on Tuesday, April 4. A discussion
about obtaining keys for the members this year was the first item. Several prominent jewelry firms have been requested to
submit bids. As the old die for the keys has been lost, a new one must be made, and several
prominent jewelry firms have been requested to submit bids. Following this topic, Seniors Noblin, McBryde, and Rachal were accepted for
graduation from the society. McNeill was appointed to prepare programs for the rest of the year.

I SAW A MAGICIAN MAKE A BALL ROLL UPHILL LAST NIGHT... WITHOUT TOUCHING IT. HE WAS SIMPLY WONDERFUL

WHAT SHE SAW - THE PERFORMER MAKES A BALL DEFY GRAVITY AND ROLL UP AN INCLINE AT HIS BIDDING. IT
PAUSES... ROLLS DOWN... ROLLS UP AGAIN OBEYING EVERY ORDER OF THE MAGICIAN.

TODAY'S SHOW — MYSTERIOUS BALL ROLLS UPHILL

THE MAGICIAN DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH MAKING THE BALL PERFORM. THERE WAS A CONTORTIONIST INSIDE IT. BY SHIFTING
HIS WEIGHT IN THE BALL, HE MADE IT GO.

DID HE DO IT BY RADIO?

BUNK!

HERE'S THE TRUTH: MY GOODNESS BUT YOU'RE SMART, JOE. WON'T YOU HAVE A CIGARETTE?

THAT'S ANOTHER ILLUSION. DON'T YOU KNOW THAT IT'S THE TOBACCO THAT COUNTS?

BUT ISN'T THIS THE MILDEST KIND?

JOE, YOUR CAMEL IS MILDER AND I LOVE THE TASTE, TOO.

CAMELS are made from finer, MORE EXPENSIVE tobaccos than any other popular brand. They are mild... easy on the throat.
They give you more pleasure. Try Camels. No tricks—just costlier tobaccos in MATCHLESS BLEND.

Delta Phi Alpha to Sponsor Junior Club
Delta Phi Alpha, German fraternity, held its regular meeting on Tuesday, April 4. The important feature of the meeting was
the report on, and elections to, the new German club. Paul Brown, president, gave a report on the accomplishments of
the committee appointed to work out a plan for the Junior German Club. A suggestion was made that its name
be called, “Deutschen Vereins,” and this together with the eleven articles suggested by the committee were passed unanimously by the
society. This new Junior German Club was formed for the purpose of recognizing ability and interest in students of first
and second year German. In order to be a member of Delta Phi Kappa, one must have completed at least
two years of German. In the new fraternity, however, students of first and second year German classes will be eligible.
Those elected to membership in “Deutschen Vereins” were: W. M. Brown, J. M. Johnson, W. B. Ravenel, G. R. Wood,
and H. T. Morris. A suggestion was also made that the faculty membership be broadened and it was decided to
discuss this at the next meeting.
