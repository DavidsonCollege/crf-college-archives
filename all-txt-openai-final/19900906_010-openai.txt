WHAT IS “LIFE IN HELL”?
“LIFE IN HELL” IS A CUTE LITTLE COMIC STRIP FULL OF FUN, MERRIMENT, LAUGHS, AND FRIVOLITY. NOT TO MENTION ANGST,
ALIENATION, SELF-LOATHING, AND THE MEANINGLESSNESS OF OUR IMPENDING DOOM.

BONGO: DISTINGUISHING FEATURES: ONE EAR, CONSTANT TWITCHING. EMOTIONAL STATE: OCCASIONALLY STRANGE.
AKBAR AND JEFF: DISTINGUISHING FEATURES: BASICALLY, BINKY WITH FEZZES. EMOTIONAL STATE: INSEPARABLE.

WILL THE CHARACTERS IN “LIFE IN HELL” EVER ACHIEVE HAPPINESS?
WHAT A SILLY QUESTION! BINKY AND THE GANG WILL BE AS HAPPY AS YOU ARE.Here is the cleaned OCR text,
preserving the original meaning and punctuation:
