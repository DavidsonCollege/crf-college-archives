**Patterson Court expected to undergo changes after self-selection**

By SUZANNE CRAYMER

The freshman class, perhaps more so than in past years, will determine the face of Patterson Court from this point on. Several houses face shortages of members while both Phi Gamma Delta (FIJI) and Greenhouse are attempting to find places on the Court.

Spencer, Rusk, Warner Hall, and Pax are following a policy which differs from that of the past few years. More joint events are being planned to present a united front. “We want the freshmen to eat where they are most comfortable and lessen the stress of choosing an eating house,” said Spencer President M.K. Myatt. “The houses are trying to show that it’s not a number game.”

In conjunction with these changes, the houses are trying to pass a new bill through the Patterson Court Council (PCC). This bill attempts to discourage the practice of “shotgunning” an eating house by eliminating wait lists. Before self-selection, the president of each house announces the number of available spots. The computer then randomly assigns those places. When a house is full, the computer will move to a person's second choice. If there is no second choice, the person will not get into an eating house.

PCC President Ben Cardwell said, “We want to show the similarities of houses and the fact that a person can be happy at a house he or she hadn’t even considered. It’s so 1,000 people don’t shotgun Rusk just because that’s where a lot of people are going.” The bill has been approved by all houses except one.

Cardwell also said that membership differs widely among houses. Rusk has 165 members. Rusk President Lisa Howe said that all were eating members since Rusk was able to hire a third cook in September. Katherine Griffith, Warner Hall president, said that the house’s size of 87 members was perfect. Concerning Spencer's size of 50 members, Myatt said, “We're the smallest of the three. But Spencer has a diverse group of girls who are more comfortable in smaller groups.”

With 34 members, PAX is the smallest eating house on the court. Questions have been raised regarding the future of co-ed eating. A quota on members necessary for a group to stay on the Court has not been set by the Patterson Court Council. Currently, only financial security determines a house’s place on the court. “We will only get stronger,” said PAX president Marion Kaylor. “Every ten or so years it swings away from co-ed eating. We've reached the furthest point, and now we’re coming back. Seventeen people joined PAX last year, and that’s better than most houses did.”

Seniors Sharon Lee Schwartz, Paul Barringer, and Judd Nelson are currently organizing an ecologically oriented house, appropriately dubbed Greenhouse. Greenhouse will express its dedication to the environment by providing vegetarian meals and promoting service projects such as recycling. “What you eat is a political statement,” said Barringer. “It takes more grain to create beef than it...

**Davidsonian Editor to marry**

Miss Jennifer Lynn Hoffman, an Editor of The Davidsonian, has become engaged to marry. The bride is the daughter of Alan Hoffman of Marietta, Ga., and Judith Crellen of Tucker, Ga. The prospective groom is Mr. Thomas H. Moore, a senior at Davidson College. The wedding is planned for June 23, 1990, in Two Rivers, Wisconsin, to coincide with the 50th wedding anniversary celebration of Mr. and Mrs. Hugo Hoffman, the bride’s paternal grandparents.Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

does to actually feed people. We're going to do the nuts and berries routine.” Barringer hopes the house will purchase organically grown bulk materials such as grain, cereals, wheat germ, and lettuce. The house will also grow some of its own herbs. “We want to find a hippie to cook and garden,” said Nelson. In addition, the organizers are planning a natural food store run on the Honor System. Some of the service ideas include cleaning up highways, planting trees, and donating food for Crop Lunch. The house plans to cut down on paper disposables and minimize disposables in a compost pile. One of the house’s major functions will be to unify faculty, students, and staff through its dedication to the environment. Schwartz sees the house as taking an active role in important issues. “We plan to be democratic rather than exclusive,” she said. “Greenhouse proposes a creative solution to an important issue. The environment has become a mainstream concern.”

In order to find a place on the court, the house will have to secure 60 full-time eating members. According to Schwartz, the soonest Greenhouse will appear on the court is next term. The organizers have already begun a publicity campaign.

FIJI

Another prospective development on the court is FIJI’s recolonization. FIJI now has six members, four of whom are seniors. This small number is unacceptable to the national organization. However, the nationals decided to support FIJI’s charter and recolonize the chapter. “We're really excited about the recolonization,” said FIJI president Todd Strauser. “Only one or two chapters a year get recolonized. I think we got picked because of Davidson’s prestige. It looks good to have a chapter here.”

An essential aspect of the recolonization is that graduate brothers and nationals will organize the rush. During the week of November 6-11, FIJI brothers from as far as Florida and Wisconsin will converge upon Davidson to plan FIJI’s promotion strategy and to help organize the group. Graduates who live in Charlotte have already met with the Davidson FIJI members. Davidson brothers will simply provide the legwork. “We're starting from scratch,” said Strauser. “They’re pretending we're not here—the nationals are running rush.”

FIJI’s goals are to pledge 25 to 30 new members, and Strauser said this can be accomplished. “We’re very neutral now and our image is not bad or good. The freshmen can mold the fraternity into what they’d like it to be. Davidson needs a strong Greek system. We plan to be trendsetters.” Strauser said that FIJI plans to use the ATO house for rush; however, both Dean of Students Will Terry and Residence Life Director Richard Terry denied having given their approval. “I don’t know,” said Terry. “I'd feel uncomfortable doing it unless the PCC approves.”

Crime Report

On September 27, at 9 a.m., Edward Azzolino found his 1988 Red Mustang vandalized in Copeland Parking lot. The subject knocked out a window of his vehicle with a rock causing $200 worth of damage. The subject stole the cord from his radar detector. The cord was valued at $75.

Crime Tip

It's almost impossible to take precautions against car vandalism other than buying an alarm system. Although the parking lots are fairly well lighted and patrolled by policemen, vandalism occurs almost every week. Officer Davis said the best precautions to take were to hide valuables out of sight. He also said much of the damage might be caused by students playing pranks. In that case, the best way to protect your car is not to touch somebody else’s.
