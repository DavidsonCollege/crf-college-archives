**The Davidsonian**

**WHAT WE SHALL WEAR.**

Probably that part of enlisting which most strongly appeals to the recruit is the donning of the uniform. So it is with us at Davidson College, judging from the numerous questions asked concerning the time of issuance of uniforms. Lieutenant Dennard has announced that measuring for uniforms will begin the early part of the week, and the uniforms may be expected to be issued by the 15th of October. Those men, 18 and over, taking the straight S. A. T. C. course, will be furnished uniforms by the Government, while the non S. A. T. C. men will pay for theirs. The uniforms to be issued consist of: Two pairs of cotton breeches, two wool shirts, one blouse, one pair of leggings, one pair of shoes, three pairs of socks, three suits of underwear, one hat, one belt. Later a wool uniform will be issued; also hat cords, collar insignia, and overcoats.

**BARRACKS REPLACE DORMS.**

All S. A. T. C. men will be assigned rooms in the steam-heated dormitories. These men will be under practically the same military discipline as if they were living in barracks. Those men under 18 who are taking the military training will be assigned rooms in a separate dormitory. Rumple and Watts Dormitories will be the ones probably used by the regular S. A. T. C. men. The regular S. A. T. C. men will be given certain mess halls at which they will eat. Those taking S. A. T. C. training but not enlisted will be permitted to eat where they wish. Mess halls will be furnished by the boarding house managers who can accommodate seventy-five men each. The men will probably be assigned to mess halls in companies.

**A SAILOR’S CHANTEY.**

Did you ever see a soldier with a lady on his arm? Oh, yes!—it’s not extremely rare! Did you ever see a sailor who could not that lady charm? Oh, no!—providing he was there! For the sailor's eye’s a roving eye that needs no prism glass To get its proper focus when it’s spying of a lass. Oh, the soldier's stock is rising, but the sailor heads his class! So a bunk upon the brine Is good enough for mine— That's the reason I enlisted.The sea dogs whine! Capt. Robt. W. McKay, ex-’17, was reported as wounded in the arm, September 25, 1918. 

S. C. Harris, '17, has been seriously ill from influenza and pneumonia in a Boston Aviation Camp.

Wm. Osa Coleman, R. D. Cranford, ex-'19; Carlisle C. Cochran, and M. A. Thompson, ex-’20, were reported wounded during the summer.

Wm. H. Oates, ex-’15, was reported captured in August, 1918.

Prof. Chalmers C. Norwood, ’78, has the chair of Physics and Applied Math. in Westminster College, Fulton, Mo. Rev. A. A. McLean, ’06, has resigned his pastorate at Clover, S. C., to come to Newton, N. C.

Did you ever see a soldier looking lonesome as a fish? Oh, yes!—the last one that I saw! Did you ever see a sailor that you didn't hear a swish? Oh, no!—and sometimes three or four! For the sailor’s knot’s a lover's knot that's tied in every port. It’s a puny kind of Jackie who can't capture what you've caught! Oh, there’s something in his rolling gait a soldier isn’t taught! So a bunk upon the sea is good enough for me— That's the reason I enlisted where the tide runs free! —Mabel Haughton Collyer, in Life.

In a certain case where the charge was the theft of a watch, the evidence was the box. The one who remained wore an expression of extreme perplexity. Observing his hesitation, the judge said, “Would you like to ask me a question?” “Yes, your honor,” replied the juror, eagerly. “I'd be very glad if you'll tell me whether the prisoner really stole the watch.” —The Green Bag.
