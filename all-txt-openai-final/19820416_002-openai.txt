To the Editor:

I am hurt. It seems that my letter of two weeks ago, while praised by many, was completely misunderstood by some. Apparently, my less than perfect reputation led some people to think that in asking people to have more fun, I was asking them to drink themselves into oblivion. Nothing could be further from the truth. My letter was not even about alcohol. It was about having fun and not worrying about images and reputations.

Although I have been known to indulge in alcoholic beverages, I do not limit my definition of fun to drinking. Getting drunk is only one of many ways to have fun. For instance, one could read a good book or listen to Beethoven.

The people who read my letter as the confessions of a frustrated hedonist not only miss my point, but reinforce it. Davidson students sometimes take things too seriously. I am not asking you to change your lifestyle, I only want to encourage you to do your own thing. If watching the dryers go around at the laundry gets you off, great! Do it! But don’t do it because it is required or to fit in, or to make some pointless statement.

Do it because you want to. How many times have you heard this before: “I'd love to, but...,” or “Not at Davidson College!” or “That sounds like fun but I have a test next week?” That is what I am talking about. If your idea of fun doesn’t involve alcohol, that’s fine. All I am saying is do something for yourself for a change, instead of for Mom and Dad, or law school, or Davidson College.

As for Ester Kim, Warren Overby, and the SGA, I am well aware of North Carolina alcoholic beverage laws, and I think that that is as good a reason as any for postponing Hattie’s Night. However, I have it from several people that the primary reason for the cancellation, given by the administration, was that Hattie’s was “atypical” of Davidson and did not present a good image. That is what I object to.

I am beginning to sound like the left-wing equivalent of Jerry Falwell, so I am going to stop. I just wanted to straighten out the confusion. If you are having fun, however you do it, keep it up. I was not writing to you. But for the rest of you, sitting around wishing you were doing something exciting this weekend, do it! Get crazy! Learn the first phrase of having fun — “What the hell!”

To the Editor:

First, let me express my appreciation to reporter Brian Butler and your staff for the article about WDAV and the decision to continue alternative music programming (rock and jazz). Given the many factors involved in the decision, Brian did an excellent job.

There is one important aspect of the decision, however, that needs clarifying. The article stated that the question I had to ask in making the decision was “...not whether or not the music was valuable, but ‘Can we, as a small station, do two formats in one broadcast day?’” While the question of two formats was a factor to consider, it was not the overriding concern. The question of whether or not the music was valuable, however, was a most significant one. Let me quote from my March 31 memo to the staff explaining the reasons behind the decision, a copy of which was given to The Davidsonian:

The decision to continue the alternative programming was made fundamentally because the music is providing a meaningful service throughout the station’s coverage area. FLIPSIDES, first of all, is truly a unique alternative to the offerings of commercial rock stations in WDAV's coverage area. And it is a substantive alternative—emphasizing the artistic yet unappreciated aspects of rock music.

Secondly, the alternative music programming has an audience. It is not a large audience to be sure, but it is of sufficient size to warrant the continuation of programming currently available in this area only on WDAV. The calls and letters received demonstrate well the commitment of the group being served by alternative programming. If alternative music is to continue on WDAV, then a genuine effort to provide a high-quality service must be made. The station will continue to offer the students involved in alternative programming a large measure of freedom; however, and I know those involved agree, that freedom must be used to ensure a quality product.

Again, thanks for your excellent coverage of WDAV and the alternative music programming decision.

Sincerely,

John Clark  
Station Manager
