ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION. ALUMNI
At present Davidson is supposed to have an Alumni Athletic Association, but it is not effective, and should be reorganized,
for we never hear of it doing anything. Almost every other college has a very active association of this kind;
for instance, Carolina has one that has helped greatly to raise the standard of athletics at Chapel Hill. Davidson has
as loyal alumni as any college in the South, and we believe that they will rally to the support of
this association, and reorganize at Commencement.

Davidson needs the aid of such an association for many reasons. First, the team managers are handicapped by the fact
that on the trip expenses are just made, while on the home grounds, the student body being small, the backing
received is barely sufficient to meet running expenses. It stands to reason, therefore, that there is no money left to
buy equipment for the team. As a consequence, the local association has yearly been going deeper and deeper in debt.
There is always material for good teams, and with help from the alumni, better teams can be put out. An
able assistant coach is needed next Fall in football, for it is impossible for one coach to look after four
teams.

With a good Alumni Association backing, with the present track material, Davidson could send out one of the best teams
in the State. Now, every loyal alumni should belong to this association and help Davidson to keep abreast with the
other rival college teams which are yearly getting better and better. If then each alumni would join and pay a
certain specified amount of money annually for the support of athletics, the standard of the “Red and Black Machines” would
be tremendously increased. Before next Fall it is hoped that this association can be in good working order.

DAVIDSON WILL ENTER STATE MEET.
Gilchrist, Johnson and E. M. Currie are to leave the end of the week for the State Track Meet to
be held in Raleigh on Saturday. They are three star men on the cinder-path and at clearing the bar, so
Davidson should carry off a large number of the events.
