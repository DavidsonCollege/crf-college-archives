Wildkitten Tennis Team Defeats Charlotte Club
Davidson Leads by One Match as Darkness Forces Play to Stop

The Davidson Freshmen Tennis team defeated the Charlotte Country Club in Charlotte last Saturday. The meet was well played in
its entirety, the Freshmen showing a better grade of tennis than they have displayed heretofore. Owing to the lateness of
starting the match, it had to be called on account of darkness before completion.

Singles:
Dick Carr, Davidson, lost to Tom Hawkins, Charlotte, 6-4, 2-6, 3-6.
Mac Lockhart, Davidson, won from Mr. Henderson, Charlotte, 4-6, 6-2, 6-3.
J. G. Wharton, Davidson, tied Mr. Wilkinson, Charlotte, 5-7, 6-4. The third set was 6-6 when darkness halted play.
Bob Miller, Davidson, won from Mr. Morris, 6-3, 5-7, 6-4.

Doubles:
Carr and Lockhart played Hawkins and Henderson. Davidson took the first set 7-5, Charlotte the second 9-7. The games were
one each when darkness called a halt.
Parks and Martin played Morris and Wilkinson. Charlotte won the first set 6-3, Davidson the second 6-4, and Charlotte was
leading 3-1 in the last when play was stopped.

Another match with the same team will be played at Charlotte this Saturday at 2:30. The probable lineup will be
Carr, Crosland, Lockhart, and Wharton for the singles, and Carr and Lockhart; Wharton and Crosland for the doubles. The team
is trying to arrange matches to be played later in the spring with Lexington High, Greensboro High, Oak Ridge, and
Winston-Salem Country Club. Nothing definite has been done yet as to the scheduling of these matches, but the manager hopes
to complete arrangements for all by the early part of May.

Applications From New Students Are Arriving
Exceptionally Large Number of Applicants for Admittance Next Fall

With applications from new men coming in at the rate of eight or ten a day and the old students
re-registering as fast as possible, the year 1925-26 promises to be a big one for Davidson.

Before Saturday, April 18, 140 new men had been accepted as students for next year. As usual, these men reside
in all the Southern States with possibly a few from foreign countries. Wilmington and Greensboro will probably have more representatives
in the Fresh class than any other two towns, about 25 application blanks having been sent to each place.

All of the men in the college now are rearranging their courses for next year. All the courses must be
fixed by May 15, but may be changed before September 1. After this date, there is a fee for changing
courses.

Indiana University recently conducted a contest to see what brand of cigarettes was most popular. Results showed that many more
would “walk a mile for a Camel” than to enjoy the “satisfying” effect of a Chesterfield.—Blue Stocking.

Religious Activities

SUNDAY SCHOOLS
Three Sunday Schools had representatives from Davidson last week. Ray, L. B. Gibbs, C. D. Patterson, Kenneth Forbes, John Crinkley,
and Prof. Porter attended at Shearer Chapel. Prof. Porter preached at the morning service. Patterson conducted the singing and had
charge of Christian Endeavor. L. K. Pritchett and Tom Barr visited Cornelius, while W. B. Rice, M. C. Yeargan, and
F. T. Franklin led the school at the Mill Chapel.

The boys have shown a great deal of interest in the Sunday School work this year, as is shown by
the weekly visits. At the present time, an endeavor is being made to get men in line for the work
next year. Under the supervision of A. N. Moffatt, the work has progressed very favorably this year, and it is
hoped that next year will show an even greater improvement.

MINISTERIAL BAND
At the meeting of the Ministerial Band last Sunday, the talk of the afternoon was made by Dr. R. T.
Gillespie, President of Columbia Theological Seminary. Dr. Gillespie used as his text Ephesians 3:14. He divided his talk into two
parts. The first part was on his text, which he explained thoroughly, making an excellent address. The second part of
his talk was on Columbia Theological Seminary. He gave a part of its history, told of its policy in the
past and what it intends to do in the future. He described its future location in Atlanta, gave details of
its faculty, and especially urged boys from South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, and Louisiana to attend Columbia.

The second part of the meeting was taken up with the election of officers for next year. As a result
of theElection: A. Y. Bowie was elected president, Harry Goodykoontz, vice-president, J. M. Murchison, Jr., secretary, and Jos. M. treasurer.
These officers will be installed at the next meeting. President-elect Bowie will make his inaugural address at this meeting, at
which time he will outline plans for the coming year, its a resume and Mississippi to the coming year.

The Christian Endeavor Training Class held its regular weekly meeting last Sunday afternoon in Shearer Hall. The meeting opened with
a short song service after prayer, which Bill Covington led. The leader of the meeting was Wilbur Hodgins, who read
for the scripture lesson the 13th chapter of Corinthians. A short talk was then made, which urged all the members
to attend regularly and to be on time. The attendance was somewhat below par and all were asked to try
to get everyone out for the next meeting.

The main feature of the meeting was a novel idea suggested by the leader. He had each man present make
out an important question which was a problem in his home society. The questions were taken up and re-distributed so
that each one had a different question than his own. Each man then got up and answered to the best
of his ability the new question that he had. These questions were all answered remarkably well and a great deal
of benefit was derived from the meeting. A committee was appointed to arrange the program for the rest of the
year. After a song, the class was dismissed by repeating the Mizpah Benediction.

A modified form of the Australian ballot is to be used in the coming elections at North Carolina State College
for Women. Regular ballots with the lists of nominees will be printed. There will be a primary and a final
election. At both elections, there will be a regular polling place and polling officers, who will check the names of
students off a student roll as they vote—Guilfordian.

Hood College students celebrate a payday every year, on which occasion everybody in college settles all debts and starts the
year clean. A central point of meeting is decided upon for this purpose.—Richmond Collegian.

Hannant (Carolina). Time, 52 1-5 seconds. Javelin—McComb (Davidson); Gracey (Davidson). Distance, 156 feet, 6 inches. 100-yard dash—Goodykoontz (Davidson); Brand (Davidson).
Time, 10 2-5 seconds.

Freshmen Down Gastonia in Slugging Game, 11 to 9
Maulden Pitches Well for Six Frames as Kugler and Dulin Hit Hard

With the score standing 8 to 0 in favor of Davidson freshmen in the sixth inning in the game with
Gastonia high school Saturday afternoon, Maulden, who had allowed but three hits and no runs in that time, was relieved
by C. Cathey, who permitted five runs before a man was retired. Poole relieved Cathey, and in the remaining three
innings Gastonia made four runs, while the freshmen were making three for a final score of 11 to 9 in
favor of the first-year men of Davidson.

The Wildcats continued their slugging, Kugler and Dulin getting three out of six trials each, one of Kugler’s being a
two-bagger and one of Dulin’s a home run with the bases full. Maulden, McAulay, and McColgan each got two out
of five trials, the total hits for the freshmen being 14. With the exception of Dulin and McGeachy, the freshmen
played perfect ball. Dulin made three miscues, while McGeachy was credited with five errors.

The feature of the game was the pitching of Maulden. He fanned only one man and walked three, but he
only allowed three safe bingles during the game. In fifteen innings he has pitched, only eight hits have been obtained.

Final Track Meet Here Saturday With Clemson
Tigers’ Hopes Based on Roy—Davidson Looking to Goodykoontz—Anderson Back

The Davidson track team goes up against the Clemson team on Saturday of this week in what should prove to
be one of the hardest meets of the year. Clemson has the strongest team this year that they have had
in years. Their merit was shown a short while ago when they whipped the University of Georgia team by a
decisive score.

In Roy, Clemson has one of the premier track men of the entire South. He is undoubtedly the fastest man
in the 220-yard and 440-yard dashes in this section of the country. The Wildcats have been going through the most
strenuous practice since the hard South Carolina match and should be in first-class shape by Saturday. Coach Tex has been
hard at work with them. Red Anderson is back in the running and will probably take part in the 220
this Saturday. Goodykoontz, high point man in the last three matches, will be expected to keep going at his usual
gate and Brand may be relied upon to ably back him up. At the hurdles, Gracey is still showing good
form. In the long-distance events, Williford, Pinkney, Gudger, and McConnell are still performing in a favorable way.

As announced by Manager Patton, the field events begin at 2:30 sharp and the track events at 3:30. For Davidson,
the following men will probably take part in the various events:
100-yard dash — Goodykoontz and Brand,
220-yard dash — Goodykoontz and Brand,
440-yard dash — Goodykoontz, Brand, and Anderson,
880-yard run — McConnell and Pinkney,
Mile run — McConnell and Pinkney,
Two-mile run — Williford and Gudger,
Low Hurdles — Gracey,
High Hurdles — Gracey,
Shot Put — Gracey and Boggs,
Discus Throw — Bohannon,
Pole Vault — Gracey,
Broad Jump — McMillan,
Javelin Throw — Gracey and McComb,
High Jump — Gracey and Calhoun.
