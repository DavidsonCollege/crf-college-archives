There was good news and bad news for Davidson in last Saturday’s game against Fordham.

The good news was that the defense played well the whole game and kept the game close. This was the
first game this season that the Wildcats have had an opportunity to win in the fourth quarter. The bad news
was that Davidson should have won the game easily. The Cats had over 80 yards total offense more than the
Rams. The Cats had 5 turnovers including a fumble at the Fordham 10-yard line with the score tied 3-3. Trailing
late in the game, Davidson was driving until Fordham intercepted a pass to secure a Ram victory. Whenever it appeared
that Davidson might take control of the game, the offense self-destructed. It seems that Friday afternoon’s practice at Giants Stadium
in the Meadowlands brought the team the same bad luck that the New York Giants had last year.

Davidson opened the scoring with a Brian Jacob field goal in the first quarter. Fordham came back with a field
goal in the first half and 2 in the second half to round out the scoring. The defense, led by
Mike Rogers, did an excellent job by holding the Rams to less than 100 yards rushing and only 130 passing.
Rogers, despite missing part of the game with injuries, had 10 unassisted tackles and 2 sacks. This game did show
though that the Cats might have at least one opponent in the Colonial League that they can beat since in
1990 Fordham moves up to Division I-AA from Division III and will join the Colonial League.

Coach Vic Gatto said after the game: “We just didn’t get it done on offense. It’s discouraging with the number
of opportunities we had on offense.” In addition to the game, the Cats also lost Rogers for an undetermined length
of time to a knee injury. Davidson will try to reverse its losing trend Saturday at home against the Big
Green of Dartmouth.

**Soccer Team loses county bragging rights**

By WHIT WILKS

On Saturday night the Cats took on UNCC in the battle for bragging rights of Mecklenburg County. In front of
a large, noisy crowd, the 49ers earned a 3-0 victory. UNCC opened the scoring only 11 minutes into the contest
on a goal following a free kick deep in Davidson’s defensive end. UNCC took advantage of another indirect kick 9
minutes before the half to make the score 2-0.

In the opening minutes of the second half, the 49ers were called for a foul inside their 18 and the
Cats were awarded a penalty kick. Mike Friedlander took the kick, but the goalie stopped it just inside his left
post. Instead of being disheartened, Davidson found renewed confidence and nearly scored moments later. A hard shot bounced off a
defender right in front of the line, and the Cats remained scoreless. UNCC had several chances of their own in
the second half, as two balls hit the crossbar.

**Christopher B. “Kit” Morris takes the reins**

The Davidson golf team is playing with a new handicap. The sudden resignation of golf Coach Tim Tallent, on Sept.
20 has left the position vacant during a full fall season for the Wildcats. Athletic Director Christopher B. “Kit” Morris
has begun the search for a new full-time coach. “Hopefully, I will find a replacement by the spring season,” said
Morris. The team plays the bulk of their matches in the spring. In the meantime, Morris has the responsibility of
filling in as coach. This has given him the opportunity to get a closer look at the Wildcat golf program,
which hopefully will aid him in selecting a new coach. Sports Information Assistant Rob Zimmerman has also shared the coaching
responsibilities. He has traveled to tournaments with the team the past two weekends.

The absence of a full-time coach does not hurt the golf team as badly as the loss of a coach
in another sport. “It’s not terrible. We’ve been losing instruction more than anything else,” said Craig Leonard. Any possible effects
of the coaching situation were unapparent this weekend, Sept. 24 and 25. The Wildcats traveled to the Shannon Green Golf
Resort in Fredericksburg, Virginia, to play in the Georgetown Invitational. Davidson turned in an excellent performance.performance, finishing fourth in a
field of 14 teams. The Wildcats’ team total of 633 over two rounds placed them one stroke out of second
place. Delaware and George Mason finished tied for second and Delaware won the tiebreaker because of a lower second round
score. The College of Charleston won the tournament with a score of 609. Leonard was not disappointed with the Wildcats’
performance. “We’ve been holding our own against bigger schools that give golf scholarships,” he said. Charleston’s Blair Leburn won the
individual tournament with a score of 150. Scott Prince was the medalist for the Wildcats. His two-round score of 157
was good enough for ninth place overall. Prince tied Georgetown’s Hank Andries. Prince was helped by teammates Craig Carlock.

Week: protein myths and fiber can lower your cholesterol rate. Fruits and

1. Remember that you should exercise aerobically at least three times a week for 20 to 30 minutes at a
time. Your Fitness says you will be able to “improve your cardiovascular endurance, strength, and flexibility.” Be sure to warm
up for 5 minutes before your workout and cool down for 5 minutes afterward.

2. The goal of your workout is to reach your target heart rate—the whole idea behind aerobic exercise. This rate
can be calculated by subtracting your age from 220. 65% to 85% of this number is your target heart rate.
For instance, if you are 20 years old: 220 - 20 = 200. 65% of 200 is 130. The idea
is to achieve your target heart rate but not exceed it.

3. It is important to know what fiber is and what it does for you. There are two types: soluble
and insoluble. Insoluble fiber is found in most high-fiber cereals. According to Nutrition Action, it helps prevent constipation and possibly
colon cancer. Soluble fiber is found in oatmeal and apples. These are the best sources of fiber. The following cereals
have adequate fiber and are low in sugar: Cheerios, Grape Nuts, and NutriGrain Wheat. Other cereals with adequate fiber that
are sweetened are Raisin Bran, Bran Flakes, Mueslix Bran and Five Grain, and Frosted Mini-Wheats. These are served in the
Commons. Recommended vegetables: broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, green peas, cabbage, peppers, green beans, celery, and many more. Recommended fruits: cantaloupe, honeydew,
bananas, apples, peaches, grapes, kiwi, pineapple, pears, etc.

4. There is a myth about how much protein your body needs. Fit for Life says, “If you eat any
fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, or sprouts on a regular basis, you are receiving all amino acids for your body to
build the protein it needs... The fact is you couldn’t have a protein deficiency unless you worked hard at having
one. Do you know anybody with a protein deficiency?”

5. After a workout, your body needs carbohydrate replacement in order to increase your glycogen level. In American Health, Dr.
John Ivy offers “The 300-Calorie Solution” which gives certain foods that replenish glycogen after an intense workout:
- A heaping plate of spaghetti (4 oz.)
- 4 apples
- 10 tablespoons of raisins
- 2 12-oz. soft drinks
- 2 baked potatoes
- A large plate of rice (12 oz.)

Each of these foods has 300 calories. Do not feel you must eat four apples or a plate of spaghetti
every time after you exercise. Decide how intensely you are working out and decide how much glycogen replacement you need.
I usually eat an apple and a banana after workouts. Remember that the main reason for restoring glycogen is to
ready your body for your next workout.

6. Many will get colds in the fall and winter months. Nutrition Action advises, “Try taking extra vitamin C when
you get a cold. By the time you have the cold it may be too late, but then again it
may not.” You may take a vitamin supplement or eat fruits and vegetables high in vitamin C.

7. Fit for Life also tells us, “ALL DAIRY PRODUCTS EXCEPT BUTTER ARE EXTREMELY ACID FORMING... The calcium in cow’s
milk is much coarser than in human milk, and is tied up with casein. This prevents the calcium from being
absorbable... Most milk-drinkers and cheese-eaters consume pasteurized, homogenized, or otherwise processed products. This processing degrades the calcium, making it very
difficult to utilize.

“All green leafy vegetables contain calcium. All raw nuts contain calcium. And raw sesame seeds contain more calcium than any
other food on earth. Also, most fruit contains ample calcium. If you’re eating fruits and vegetables daily and some raw
nuts even occasionally, you can’t have a calcium deficiency.”
