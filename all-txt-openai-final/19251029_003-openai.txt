Mr. G. McMillan, Jr. Humorous Editor The Davidsonian Davidson, N. C.

Dear Sir:

Enclosed please find self-addressed, stamped envelope. Kindly send me the answers to the questions in this week’s issue of the Davidsonian’s “Through the Keyhole.”

Yours very truly,

MISS A. H. D.

A GENTLE HINT

If you don’t like these little jokes, And their dryness makes you groan; Just stroll around occasionally With some good ones of your own.

Womack gets the BUSHVILLE WEEKLY BUNGLE twice a month; thank goodness it don’t come oftener.

TO KEEP FROM GETTING SHOT

Toll out, old bell, in mournful lay; But I shall ride sick-call today.

“How would you like to sign up with me for a life game?” was the way that a baseball fan proposed.

“I’m agreeable,” she said, “Where’s your diamond?”

Bill Cox is a diplomat. He remembers his girl’s birthday but has forgotten her age.

EXTRA! EXTRA!

A double-header freight passed through Davidson Thursday at noon. Only a few of the students and townspeople were present to witness the event; if we had known it was coming someone might have had the presence of mind to ring the fire bell.

LUCIAN WELLS Davidson, Half

The work of Wells in the Davidson backfield this year has been one of the bright spots in the team’s play.

Fresh, if you think this place is dead all we ask you to do is to take a trip to Mount Mourne; just one trip.

Roland Parker was giving his opinion of a student's answer to the professor's question the other day, and summarized by saying, “Now psychologically speaking—”

YOU SAID IT

Big Un Thompson—“What’s a sure cure for love at first sight?” Wilkinson—“Another look.”

A MOUTHFUL

It’s better to love ’em and leave ’em Than just stick around and deceive ’em, For women are queer, And I’ll tell you right here, Either method is certain to peeve ’em.

“STREET CAR” BUSTER

Bus Lawson was in Charlotte on a date. It was after eleven o'clock. “If I had money, I’d travel,” he said. And she pressed seven cents into his hand.

We’ll readily admit that we’ve heard some mighty good wise cracks in our time about dumb freshmen, but this one beats ’em all. Fresh Oakes McCollum thought Paris Green was a golf course in France.

KNOWLEDGE FROM EXPERIENCE

Prof.—“What is a cell composed of, Mr. Bell?” Kable—“Iron bars and a cement floor, sir.”

Since seeing so many knickers on the campus we judge that about three-fourths of the student body are taking monkey-gland treatment.

FLAKE LAIRD Davidson, Tackle Left

Laird was out of the Furman game with injuries. Last year he kicked the field goal and tying point against Techmen.

CHEATIN’ ON ME!

Mac Lockhart—“Is it true that you are engaged to three other men besides me?” Fair One—“Why?” Mac—“Well, I thought we might raise a subscription and buy you an engagement ring.”

PRINTING

In speaking of his girl the other day Mickey Farrell said: “She isn’t exactly a gold-digger, but she looks for the silver lining.”
