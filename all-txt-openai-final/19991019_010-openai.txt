10 THE DAVIDSONIAN

Please don’t ignore the risk

By Juvia Philpot

According to the American Cancer Society, 175,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer this year and about 43,300 of those women will die from the disease. October is breast cancer awareness month; therefore, the health center is preaching the facts about breast cancer so that women on this campus can know the risk factors for the disease and how to detect it.

Many young women are not concerned with breast cancer because they think it is a disease that develops in older women. While the risk for breast cancer does increase with age, young women are definitely susceptible as well. The biggest risk factor for breast cancer is being a woman. With that in mind, do you know your breasts well enough to detect a change if a small lump were beginning to form? Early detection is crucial in diagnosing breast cancer because if it goes undetected the survival rate decreases dramatically.

In order to detect any changes in your breasts, monthly self-examinations are necessary. By examining your breasts regularly, you will know how your breasts normally feel. The American Cancer Society suggests checking your breasts about one week after your period; if you have irregular periods, make sure you check your breasts at the same time every month. Symptoms of breast cancer can include any lump, thickness, swelling, dimpling, skin irritation, distortion, retraction of the nipple, discharge from the nipple, blood from the nipple, or pain. If you do not know the proper way to give yourself a breast exam, there are pamphlets at the health center to guide you through it. Again, checking your breasts monthly is crucial so that you can notify your doctor if any changes occur.

While all women are at risk for breast cancer, some women are at more risk than others. Some risk factors to be aware of include: a family history of breast cancer, obesity (weight more than 20% above ideal weight), long menstrual history (periods that start early and end late in life), and consuming large amounts of alcohol. Women who consume large amounts of alcohol daily increase their chances of developing invasive breast cancer by 30-40%.

Once a woman turns twenty, she should begin having mammograms every three years. Every woman on this campus should at least be thinking about scheduling a mammogram. One out of nine women is diagnosed with breast cancer each year. With that in mind, I ask you to recall the statistics presented at the beginning of this article. Think of all the amazing women who die from this disease each year. Next, I ask you to think about all of your female friends on this campus, and then think of yourself. Life is such a gift and it seems a crime to ignore anything that could help to prolong it. According to the statistics, someone you know will be diagnosed with breast cancer. Please do everything you can to take care of your body and give yourself a monthly breast examination check.

Information for this article was taken from the American Cancer Society’s pamphlets and websites. If you would like to know more about breast cancer, you can call 1-800-ACS-2345, or you can go to www.cancer.org. In addition, the student health center has lots of information.
