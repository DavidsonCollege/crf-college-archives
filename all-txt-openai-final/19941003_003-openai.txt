### Student nearly arrested as a result of dunking booth fiasco
By Laura Dennis

Although Lunar Luau was a great success this year, it did not come off without a hitch. On the Monday
evening following the event, Geoff Graham, social chair of Kappa Sigma, received a call from the Charlotte Police, who said
they had a warrant for his arrest. Graham had been accused of stealing the dunking machine used at Lunar Luau.
The man who rented the booth had only Graham’s name on the invoice.

Surprised and scared at the prospect of being arrested, Graham explained to the police that there must have been a
misunderstanding and that he would return the dunking machine as soon as possible. The police reluctantly backed off, and Graham
set out to resolve the dilemma.

The dunking machine was used at the Lunar Luau booth which represented all of Patterson Court. The Kappa Sigs rented
the machine under Graham’s name, picked it up from an entertainment company in Charlotte, and set it up on Friday.
The other Patterson Court houses each had duties, such as manning the booth during the event; some—but not all—of the
houses fulfilled their duties.

At the end of the night, Sig Ep was assigned to clean out the booth and then return it to
the company on Monday. However, according to Sigma Phi Epsilon President Bill Rodin, he was never notified of the fraternity’s
assigned task. Therefore, the booth was left on campus.

### Bookstore non-scandal uncovered: students not ripped off by bookstore
By Matthew Eirich

After purchasing books for the upcoming semester, most students leave feeling shell-shocked and angry after spending hundreds of dollars on
books. But most students blame the profiteering bookstore for the astronomical bill. Such blame is erroneously placed.

#### The Operation
The Davidson College bookstore is owned by the college and managed by Gwen Gardner. But Gardner explains that the college
does not fund the bookstore to pay for merchandise, salaries, postage, and other expenses. Thus, the bookstore must generate its
own funds for its operating costs.

Pricing policies for the bookstore are determined by many factors. One year in advance the bookstore must submit a budget
which it estimates will cover its operating expenses for the next year. After the budget is determined, a profit margin
is decided upon to meet that budget. If a miscalculation was made and the budget is too low or too
high, the profit margin is similarly altered to reflect the new calculation.

The actual prices are set by Gardner, but she says, “The administration sets requirements for the bookstore and determines our
policy, and then it is up to us to meet whatever guidelines they give us.” The profits from the bookstore
stay within the college. Profits are pooled into a general fund administered by the Vice-President for Finance. From there, profits
are shuttled to various student activities. The profit margin is in part then an activities tax.

#### Profit Margin
Every textbook has a profit margin attached to it. Often this is the suggested retail price, but as Gardner explains,
at times the various publications from the university presses sell at lower than the suggested retail price. Additionally, when dealing
with more expensive textbooks, the margin is lower than average in order to lessen the cost. The bookstore tries to
“keep a low margin” on textbooks because students have no other choice but to buy from the store, explains Gardner.
Also, to help defray the cost of textbooks, the bookstore offers used books whenever possible.The profit margin is increased in
other areas of the bookstore. This is because non-textbook items are not essential and because much of the merchandise is
not purchased by students but by alumni and visitors to the campus. These patrons help to keep the cost of
textbooks down, notes Gardner.

Buy-Back and Used Books

Buy-back and used books are handled through an independent wholesale company. If the book is to be used again at
Davidson, the company pays the student half the new price at buy-back. If it is not to be used again,
the company is at liberty to make any offer, which Gardner noted may only be 30 cents on the dollar.
The bookstore sells used textbooks at 75% of the price of new textbooks. Gardner stresses that the bookstore tries to
“maximize used books” since those are the least expensive option for students. Also, the bookstore has no control over professors’
textbook selections for upcoming semesters. The bookstore tries to predict which books will be used again so that students might
maximize their returns when they buy them back; consequently, the used books will be less expensive for the following semester.
Gardner notes that many professors make the conscious decision to use paperback books and anthologies which are “cheaper” for the
students and keep the courses more “current.”

The field after the event. Rodin says, “It was not our fault because no one told us anything about it.”
After the call from the police, Graham found the dunking booth leaning against the side of Johnston Gym and promptly
called the man from whom he had rented the machine. The owner said that the reason he called the police
instead of contacting Graham directly was that he “had trouble with frat boys before” who destroyed or ran off with
his merchandise, and he just wanted to let the police handle this one.

Students purchase books in the bookstore even though they complain about prices.

Students propose more involvement

Before the trustees, meeting in plenary session on Friday. The trustees may then vote on the resolution at their next
session in January. "We plan to keep working until we achieve our goal,” says Rosenbach.

The Davidsonian will not be published October 10 because the editors need a break.

On Tuesday, Rodin received a call from Graham asking him if he or another one of the Sig Eps would
take it back to the owner that day. Because of the late notice, no one could return it on Tuesday.
Finally, on Wednesday, PCC President Josh Worsham returned the machine. Worsham says the situation “was basically a mix-up about who
was supposed to return [the booth].” No charges were filed by the police, but Patterson Court must pay two days
in late fees, which amount to three hundred dollars.
