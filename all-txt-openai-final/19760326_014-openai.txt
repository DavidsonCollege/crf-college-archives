**Cat sailors breeze to second, expect championship berth.**

By BRAD SWALWELL

The Davidson College Sailing Team fought shifting winds and breezed to an easy second-place finish at a conference eliminations regatta
on Lake Monticello last weekend.

Seven teams participated in this, the second in a series of three conference elimination regattas. Old Dominion University edged out
Davidson for first place, with the University of Virginia trailing Davidson by six points to wind up in third position.

The top three teams easily handled the remaining four schools, as Duke University, North Carolina State University, the University of
North Carolina, and Christopher Newport College all finished far behind the leaders.

Team captain Dave Francis commented on the difficulties the team encountered with the changing winds. “The weather was nice and
warm, but the winds varied, running between five and 15 miles an hour during the day.

“The winds shifted due to the size of the lake and its irregular shape. The course was easy to figure
out, but the wind strength made for a rough day’s sailing,” said Francis.

Francis sailed five of the six A Division races, with Laurie Bingaman as crew. Francis picked up three second places
and two thirds in his five races.

Greg Eason sailed the last A Division race for Davidson and took third place. Dave Love crewed for Eason in
the race.

“Virginia walked away with A Division,” commented Francis. “Billy Ball, the Virginia skipper, sailed third in the first race, but
pulled five straight firsts in the remaining A Division races.

“By points, he pretty well dominated everybody. But during the races, we were all in contention. He won a couple
of races when the breaks went against us.”

“Christopher Newport, true to form, finished last in every single race,” he said.

Davidson’s B Division boat was skippered by Chuck Barrineau, with Stuart Campbell as crew. The B Division team placed second,
finishing four points behind the winning Old Dominion team.

“Old Dominion’s B skipper, Bill Cofer, sailed incredibly. He sailed first in the first race, had a bye in the
second, and won the third race,” said Francis.

Barrineau ran into bad luck in the fifth B Division race. “Chuck was leading in the fifth race by half
of a leg. He had just won the fourth race by a full leg of the course.

“Then he sailed into a hole. A hole is a spot on the lake where there is absolutely no wind.
To top it off, he had a leaky boat that race. The Old Dominion skipper, who had turned his boat
over at the very start of the race, caught and passed Chuck at the finish,” said Francis.

Francis expressed satisfaction with the team’s progress. “It was the best regatta we’ve sailed in this year. We are getting
more consistent. We are in second place in our division, and it looks like we’ve got a pretty easy berth
to the championships.”

**Rough play threatens IMAC**

By the THREE FAIRIES

In his first official decree, new IMAC czar Rozelle Brown has threatened to cancel the remainder of the volleyball season
after one week of totally inept play.

The blatant carries, spiking techniques resembling a Julius Erving slam-dunk, and severe beatings continually administered to the nets have given
rise to the fear that all-time, all-rag, all-IMAC star Larry Horowitz will be recalled to referee, thereby guaranteeing the end
of the season.

On opening night, SPE #1 routed Der Schpile 15-9, 4-15, 15-6. Felix Japp’s performance improved considerably after he was informed
that only three hits are allowed per side.

The Jumpin’ Junkies, led by stud Billy “Lips” McLean, shot down the Dungeon Demons 15-1, 13-15, 15-3.

Another high-powered squad, Emanon #1, mashed the Fijis, 15-10, 16-14, as highly regarded recruit Pat Hickert proved no match for
the venerable Stretch. However, earlier in the week Ockham’s Razor knocked off Emanon in three games.

The Sequoia National Forest, otherwise known as SAE #1, managed to defeat the Beavers in a mutually lackluster performance, proving
that beauty and height aren’t everything.

In girls' action, the two jock teams successfully switched sports in midair as the Moby Dicks aced the Sty and
Henderson House stuffed 4th Watts, 15-9, 15-4. The Eaves used the sound strategy of getting their serves in to win
matches over 4th and 1st Watts. 4th Watts hurts.

Meanwhile, the bastard product of an unnatural act, I Felta Derby, used the unsound strategy of serving into the net,
failing to come from behind against the powerful Aintry Squealers, 15-6, 8-15, 15-13.

Finally, the Steamin’ Seamen, led by the burning thrusts of Blackwood and Combe, had no problem with the Wooley Greys,
winning 15-7, 15-12. Seaman George Loy was reportedly accosted by the Transvestite after the game: “Hey, sailor, wanna drill?”

The highlight of this week’s softball action was a new IMAC record established by L’il Owsly second baseman Pete Johnson,
who committed nine errors in as many chances, leading his team to a 14-2 defeat against PIKA.

We must apologize for incorrectly crediting the Wooley Greys with a victory over the Aintry Squealers last week. We must
not apologize to Mike Gibson, who certainly had something to do with it. The sheepish Greys did beat ETC, 13-3,
for sure, we think?
