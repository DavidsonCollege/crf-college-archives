Wildcats produce tale of two halves in Centennial win

Squad needs — and wants — more practice at playing with 42-point lead

After scoring 42 unanswered points in an incredibly impressive first half, the Wildcats faltered somewhat in the second, managing only five first downs and 71 yards of offense. But who can blame the Wild-

cats for their rather lackluster game-ending performance? After all, it’s not every day they play a half protecting a six-touchdown advantage. Considering Davidson’s often heartbreaking recent gridiron history, Wildcat fans probably have a better chance of seeing the Richardson Field bleachers full than their team jump out to such a gaping halftime lead.

“I’ve never come out of a half up 42 points,” said quarterback Tommy Dugan, who threw for a pair of touchdowns and ran for another. “So it was kind of amazing. It’s certainly not something we’re used to, but hopefully we can keep that drive going.

“We just need to execute better (in the second half). We’ve got to come out more mentally focused when we’ve got a lead like that, so we can keep scoring points the whole way.”

“Being a young football team, we’ve not been in that experience before,” coach Tim Landis said. “At halftime, I told them that they were playing good football, and to go out in the second half and take it to the next level. What I meant by that was, just keep playing hard, keep after it.

“I wanted to get some guys in the football game that deserve to be in, and have them execute as well. And I really believe we did that for the most part.

“We moved the ball a couple times and just kind of came up short.

“I think a lot of it had to do with the heat, and we were worn down a little bit.”

Lightning-like strikes

Two years ago — and even at times last year — the Wildcats would routinely dominate their opponent in time of possession, but still lose the game. So far this season, just the opposite has been the case. Davidson held the ball for only 25 minutes and change in the season-opening win last week versus Maryville. And in this week’s romp over Sewanee, the visiting Tigers actually held an edge in possession — 15:42 to 14:18 — after the first half in which they were outscored by 42 points.

“We’ve just got a lot of people who can make plays on offense,” said Lorenzo Moll, who had two 80-plus-yard touchdown runs Saturday afternoon. “It’s nice because they can’t just stop one guy.

“One of the tailbacks is running the ball, then it’s Roland (Williams) catching a deep pass, or (Eric) Ferguson running or Dugan running, so it’s just a lot of weapons we’ve got. It’s nice we can just go and score sometimes at will.

“We want to be able to keep the ball out of the other offenses’ hands, but it’s nice to be able to have quick strikes like that.”

“Last year, we had consistent drives,” Dugan said. “This year, the big plays are going up. So I guess our time of possession is going down.”

Indeed, a small price to pay for having two 1-play, 80-something-yard touchdown drives. Ultimately though, thanks to a more methodical — not to mention far less prolific — offense in the second half, Davidson won the time of possession battle against Sewanee, 32:17 to 27:43.

Never in doubt

This one was over early. At the half, Davidson had 12 first downs to Sewanee’s four, 268 yards on the ground to Sewanee’s 92, 129 yards passing to Sewanee’s 24, and 397 total yards to Sewanee’s 116...the four-touchdown victory gave the Wildcats their first 2-0 mark to start a season since 1979...the North Mecklenburg High School band further proved that not having a musical component — or even a 30-person group of noise-makers, for that matter — at football and basketball games should not be an option...back-up quarterback Matt

Eric Ferguson eludes a would-be Sewanee tackler in Saturday’s Centennial game. Ferguson compiled 53 yards on 10 carries, and the Wildcats rushed for 300 yards as a team. Strader enteredthe game with just under nine minutes left in the fourth quarter, relieving Dugan. Strader’s one pass attempt, intended for Ferguson, landed incomplete...sophomore signal-caller Shaun Tyrance also got in the game for the Wildcats’ final offensive series as time ran out...the Wildcats’ 397 first-half yards were on pace to break the team’s all-time single-game yardage mark of 744, set Oct. 22, 1921 against Wofford...Moll’s 180 yards rushing in the first half were 80 shy of Ray Sinclair’s Wildcat record of 280 yards, set versus Catawba in 1981. The junior tailback actually lost a yard on eight attempts after intermission...Star middle linebacker Shreve Ariail, for the second week in a row lived up to his billing as anchor of the Wildcat defense, leading the squad with 12 tackles...rookie outside linebacker Freeman Belser tallied seven takedowns, while Clif Henry, Tom Ting, Ryan Gist, and Ben Spivey all added six. Ting had two tackles for loss, including a sack. Defensive lineman Marcus Williams, who pitched in only one tackle, made his mark with two fumble recoveries.

Dugan made it 14-0 with just over three minutes left in the first period, capping an 11-play, 88-yard scoring drive — Davidson’s longest on the day — with a 22-yard option dash to the end zone. On the first play of the second quarter, Dugan found tight end Wes Jones on a 10-yard scoring toss to give the Wildcats a 21-point pad six seconds into the period. The touchdown reception was Jones’ first since he suffered a season-ending knee injury in the 1996 opener. Eric Ferguson added a 21-yard run at the 10:43 mark, deep threat Roland Williams — last week’s hero — hauled in a 35-yard touchdown pass, and Moll broke through the Tiger line for his second length-of-the-field scamper, as Davidson raced to the unprecedented halftime cushion.

“We were expecting Sewanee to be tough,” Moll explained. “I mean, they’re tough kids, they hit. So we were expecting a tough game, but we just came out and executed.

“We've still got a lot to work on, obviously. In the second half, we didn’t do much at all.” But it mattered little — if at all — at that point. Tiger quarterback John Stroup finally broke the dry spell for Sewanee with an 80-yard touchdown run at the 1:34 juncture in the third quarter. Brian Morrison notched the Tigers’ second meaningless tally on a 1-yard plunge with 13:23 to go. But by that time, the Centennial crowd of 3,188 — and perhaps many of the Wildcat players as well — had been celebrating a Davidson victory for the better part of two quarters.

“I thought it was going to be a real battle,” Landis said, “and we prepared for a real battle. I think it’s just a tribute to our guys. On film and on paper, it looked like an even matchup. And it was just our guys coming out and wanting it a little more.” Check that. A lot more.
