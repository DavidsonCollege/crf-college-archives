Thursday, February 12, 1942 THE DAVIDSONIAN Page Five — Question Of The Week

The most recent innovation to the Davidson campus has been the Swing Concert of last Friday afternoon. With this in
mind, your reporter sets himself to the task of finding out the pros and cons to the query, "What is
your opinion of the Davidson Swing Concert?"

Dick Kelly seemed a good prospect from whom to get a frank opinion (not only that, he lives on the
ground floor), so I approached him. Here are Dick’s opinions: “The concert in Chambers was definitely a step in the
right direction. Maybe the trustees of the school now realize that the walls of the building will not cave in
when popular music is played on the campus and we can have all our dances here at Davidson. Now, more
than ever, it seems to me impractical and utterly foolish to have to go to Charlotte for our dances.”

Finding Southgate Jones’ door unlocked, I cornered him for these remarks: “It seems to me that in the light of
its reception and the attendance, the concert was well received and an assured success. To be sure, it seemed a
little strange for swing music to be coming from the stage where there had been preaching a few hours before,
but this is natural and this feeling should not in any way be termed irreverent. Chambers Auditorium is not essentially
a church. I cannot see any real reason why the faculty should object to such programs in the future, for
they add to the color of the weekend and give a preview of what to expect from the band.”

Packing my overnight bag, I traveled down to Duke Dorm to get the opinions of Jack Behrman. Jack said, “The
first Swing Concert on the Davidson Campus was, in its major aspect, a flop! It was out of place. The
type of music was not right, or was it the band? If another such concert is to be held, it
must have student planning; it must not be left to the showmanship of such poor talent as Powell’s.” Continuing, Jack
said, “All right, maybe the audience was unduly restrained, but then if we had a suitable place such as a
new gym, we could show our appreciation for that branch of music that is certainly not the least popular. Therefore,
if we are to enjoy a concert of swing, we must have an appropriate place, student supervision or requests, and
unrestraint in showing appreciation of good showmanship.”

Thinking I was going to hear a recording by Gene Krupa, I opened a door only to find Joe Barnwell
breaking a few sticks. In between beats, I managed to get this from Joe: “What do I think about the
Swing Concert in the auditorium? I think it was really mellow! The band really ‘sent’ me as it did most
of the others present. I was glad to see the faculty represented and Dr. Harding will certainly get my vote.
Swing is looked upon by some of the older generation as being an immoral indulgence, but that is being awfully
narrow-minded. Chambers Auditorium is an ideal place for a concert, for swing as well as for the classics; I personally
would like to see the Pan-Hell give more of them. The tea dances usually turn out to be a concert
anyway. A bit of praise to the Pan-Hell for a good dance set and to the decorations for a swell-looking
dance hall.”

Clarence McArthur was enthusiastic with the following: “The concert was a definite improvement over the tea dances of former years.
I think it was a great idea to allow the band to play its exhibitionist pieces at a concert so
as not to become a nuisance at the dances. Everyone seemed to enjoy it, and the concert gave everyone a
chance to see what to expect at the dances. I don’t think there was too much restraint; there was ample
opportunity at the end of the pieces to clap and whistle and otherwise show enthusiasm. I am thoroughly convinced that
the concert not only increased attendance at the dances but was a great improvement over the tea dances which no
one ever managed to attend.”

Dropping in to see Joe Martin, I received the following comment: “I think that the concerts are a good addition
and should be continued in the future. It gives everyone a chance to get acquainted with the band and to
get into the groove, so to speak. Also, it is convenient for those with dates who come in the afternoon,
and who would ordinarily miss the tea dance. It is also convenient for those who don’t (Continued on Page Six)

ANNUAL

Julien McCall, Editor of Quips and Cranks, reports that material is still being assembled for this annual publication. Group pictures
of organizations may be taken today if schedules are followed. Photographs of fraternity sponsors were taken over the past weekend
when they were here for the dances. Sponsors for individuals are now supplying the necessary pictures. These will all be
in sometime in the near future. Within a few weeks, there will be a canvass of dormitories for pictures of
girls. These pictures will go into the beauty section.

Gwynn Makes Vespers Talk

Professor Discusses “The Foundations Of A Christian Peace”

“The Foundations of a Christian Peace.” Such was the momentous subject of Dr. P. H. Gwynn's vespers address on last
Sunday night. Dr. Gwynn stated personally that he was inadequate to present such a subject but that the need for
such a discussion was so vital that he felt it should be treated. He cited the fact that both President
Roosevelt and Vice-President Wallace advocate planning ahead for the lasting peace that must follow this greatest of all wars. Another
reason he gave for his address was that he, as a veteran of the last war, was determined to do
everything in his power to make it a “peace without victory” and not another Versailles.

Text

As his scripture, Dr. Gwynn used God's great promise to the world, as taken from Isaiah, the promise that Christ
would come to rule over the universe and His government and peace would never end. He pointed out that there
would be no such peace unless we as Davidson men, together with the rest of the world, were willing to
work earnestly and prayerfully and with all our hearts for it.

Peace

“It is no time,” he said, “for those who scoff at peace proposals and say that peace will take care
of itself after the war is over. Peace is based on the Christian religion. This Christian religion, the balm of
Gilead, must be applied to public as well as private, international as well as national, life.” Some of the features
of a desirable peace, Dr. Gwynn said, were a guarantee of religious freedom to all, civil liberties, complete disarmament of
aggressor nations and eventually, of all nations, and free and unhampered exchange of goods and services throughout the world. Russia,
he said, was a problem. Communism is opposed to Christianity and we must not forget that in thinking of Russia
as our ally.

Leaders

Dr. Gwynn advocates a large police force to persuade Russia to abandon Communism and to disarm after the war. The
three great Christian-led nations, China, the United States, and the British Empire, must be the leaders of disarmament and the
replacement of the arts of peace for the arts of war. Other ills such as religious intolerance, racial intolerance, and
extreme nationalism must be wiped out. World-wide Christianity and world-wide education must be the foundation for world-wide peace.

Berg Sings At Musical

Earl Berg, baritone, was featured on the second program of the Sunday Musicals last Sunday afternoon, February 8, in Chambers
Auditorium. Mr. Berg opened his recital with Bach’s “Aria” from Cantata No. 4. Next, he sang “Dichterliebe” by Schumann which
was followed by the well-known “My Lovely Celia.” Mr. Berg, director of the Davidson Glee Club and instructor of vocal
music, was accompanied by his wife, Eunice Plann Berg.

G. B. Watts Pens Work On Valdese

North Carolina Settlers Are Subject Of Professor's New Book

“Waldenses in the New World,” a new book by Dr. George B. Watts, has just been released by the Duke
University Press. A small community located in Burke County in the foothills of the North Carolina Blue Ridge Mountains is
called Valdese. The people in the surrounding community are known as Waldenses or Waldensians in this country. These people are
the descendants of a small town in the Cottian Alps. They came to America in order that they might find
a home free from religious persecution. Tourists passing through the town of Valdese are struck by the black hair and
the sparkling eyes of these Protestant immigrants, said one columnist. He also commented on the handsome stone school building and
the neatness of the surrounding community. A state historical marker is near the center of the town telling of the
settlement of the Waldenses. Occasionally, when asked why they settled in Valdese, they will tell you it is: “More like
their native mountains than any other section in America.” Here the people live in harmony and happiness, commented some of
the native inhabitants. The story of the Waldenses in America and in the Cottian Alps is what Dr. Watts relates
in his book. This book is a remarkable job in research and unlike the work of many college professors. It
is interesting also, said one critic. The ten and one-half pages of closely listed bibliography, footnotes in the text, and
a long appendix give detailed information about these immigrants, added certain critics. “Waldenses in the New World” is divided into
13 sections. An interesting concluding chapter on the music and literature of the Waldenses makes a perfect ending, says one
columnist.

Dr. Watts, who has served on the faculty of Davidson College since 1929, has been working on this book since
1938 when he thought of the idea while attending the meeting of the Modern Language Association of America at Columbia
University. A proposal was made at this meeting that persons interested in French language and literature should record information about
French settlements in America. Finding nothing had been written on the Waldenses of Valdese, Dr. Watts proceeded to turn out
the book, “Waldenses in the New World.”

Dr. Brenizer Gives Lecture

Charlotte Doctor Shows Surgical Movies

Dr. Addison Brenizer of Charlotte gave an illustrated lecture on surgery to the members of Alpha Epsilon Delta, honorary pre-medical
fraternity, at their meeting on Tuesday evening, February 3, in the Chemistry building. Movies and slides of two major operations
were shown to the group, accompanied by comments by Dr. Brenizer from his wide experience.

Feed Follows

Following the program, a feed and social gathering were held in the Pi Kappa Phi fraternity house. Dr. Brenizer and
Dr. Williams, who accompanied him to Davidson, participated in a “bull session” with the students which was very helpful to
them in their plans for studying medicine.Dr. Brenizer is a prominent Charlotte physician. He studied at the University of Heidelberg
in Germany and was for some time a resident surgeon at Johns Hopkins University.

AUTHOR
Dr. George Watts, a prominent member of the Davidson faculty, has had his recent book “The Waldenses in the New
World” published by the Duke University Press, Durham. This volume contains an account of the Waldenses since their migration from
Europe.

Sigma Upsilon Group Meets
McCall, Plunkett, and Sandifer Read Varied Papers At Meeting

At a meeting of the Sigma Upsilon, honorary literary fraternity, Tuesday night, February 3, three papers were read by various
members of the organization. Julien McCall read a selection on “History of Life Insurance” which traced its history from the
Roman Civilization to the present era, where there is over one hundred billion dollars in force. “J. Lysander Epic Mallorey,”
the fifth installment of the chapter epic, was presented by W. C. Plunkett. Myron Sandifer read “C.D. in D.C. (Civilian
Defense in Davidson College),” a humorous satire of the effect of the defense program in Davidson College.

Following this was a discussion on what to do with the chapter's money. It was decided that more information regarding
the national fraternity must be obtained before a decision could be reached. The meeting was held in the Beta Theta
Pi fraternity house and refreshments were served by Ed Taylor.

Y Sponsors Open Forum
Group To Discuss Student-Faculty Relations

An Open Forum concerning the bettering of student-faculty relations will be held in Phi Hall at 7:30 on Wednesday night,
February 18, 1942. Speakers for this meeting will be from the Davidson faculty. Dr. McGavock will offer concrete suggestions for
improving the relations between the faculty and the student body. Dr. Foreman will discuss the same subject from a scholastic
viewpoint. Dr. Johnston and Professor Fleagle will probably complete the list.

The meeting will be conducted according to the forums of last year. The first ten minutes will be allotted to
the speakers to present their subjects. Following this, the floor will open for questions or discussions of any kind. It
is hoped that resulting discussions will follow.

Open To All
This forum, sponsored by the Y. M. C. A., extends an invitation to all students who may be interested. Each
student attending will be given a chance to say what he pleases.

Down Fraternity Court
Sigma Phi Epsilon

Midwinters have come and gone, but Sig-Eps will remember this weekend as one of the most gala and colorful they
have ever enjoyed. Eight alumni visited the chapter for the occasion, including former chapter president Ed Watson, who is now
on active duty as a second lieutenant with the U.S. Marine Corps. Also present were Raymond McDaniel, Dan Withers, Dick
Sleet, Tommy Hollar, Lawson Cobb, and Kirkpatrick.

Entertainment for the weekend took the form of a feed at the house around three o’clock Saturday morning, and a
banquet given in the Gold Room of the Barringer Hotel on Saturday evening between the tea dance and the informal.
Other entertainment was left to the discretion of the members. The chapter is happy to announce the pledging of “Flop”
Shaw of the Freshman Class.

At the banquet, Sid Daffin acted as master of ceremonies. Short speeches were made by Ed Watson and other alumni.
Favors consisted of jewelry boxes in the shape of golden hearts.

Kappa Sigma
After the formal dance Friday night, the Kappa Sigs trouped up to the Mt. Mourne Country Club for a delicious
hamburger feed. The KS banquet was held Saturday night at the Charlotte Hotel with Joe McCoy as toastmaster, who did
a fine job. Everyone left in a jovial mood for the informal dance. Freshmen were called upon to tell a
joke and Pledge Gault did exceptionally well. Highlight of the fun came when two little shady ragamuffins came up to
“Judge” McCoy and said, “Daddy, gimme a nickel.”

Job Finley and Melvin Means, otherwise known as “Whisky” and “Vapey,” were welcome alumni guests. Another guest was James Dupree
of Spartanburg. After the dates were seen on their way, most of the Sigmas went to bed.

Beta Theta Pi
All the brothers and pledges drifted back to school Sunday night after a big weekend with Teddy Powell and dates.
The dates came from Pennsylvania to Florida to attend the Midwinters set. Brother Granny Sharpe was here for the weekend
with Alice Withers and Brother Steve Thurston with Nell Callum. The dates ranged from sisters and blind-dates to wives-to-be. Most
of the brothers looked a shade shot Sunday, so maybe the blind-dates and late dates weren’t so bad after all.

Brother Al Winn was toastmaster at the banquet Saturday night at Thacker’s, presenting favors to the feminine guests. Quite a
few of the brothers had trouble getting dates. The record was seven flushes. After writing, wiring, and phoning, they even
tried a little “wolfing,” but still had no luck.

Beta is proud to announce that Carl Rowland has pledged.

Pi Kappa Alpha
The weekend was a huge success for the Pikas with some dates on hand and some flushes at a minimum.
There was a large turnout for the formal banquet Friday night, with Teddy Powell and Peggy Mary as guests of
honor. Also present were the Hon. Edwin Shewmake, ‘41, and Pvt. Ned Pollock of Fort Bragg, N. C. A feed
was held at the house Saturday morning, immediately following the dance and it was greatly enjoyed by all. An impromptu
banquet was held at Penner’s Saturday night. It was attended by eleven couples. Pledge Bill Prichard, when unable to get
his date down for the dances, went home to Kentucky to get her.

It is with pleasure that we announce the pledging of Jack Shelton.

Phi Gamma Delta
Guests of the chapter this week other than the dates for Midwinters included Mr. and Mrs. Albert King, Sr., of
Bristol, Tenn.; Mr. and Mrs. J. D. Wooten of Memphis, Tenn.; and Messrs. Tom Rogers, Jr., of Florence, Ala., and
Columbia University, Matt Long of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, George Richmond of Concord, N. C., and Clyde Stowe of Belmont,
N. C.

Following Friday night’s dance, a breakfast in the lodge was given and this ended in singing fraternity songs around the
fire. A banquet at Thacker’s Saturday evening between the dances completed the weekend entertainment. The banquet consisted of a song
session and short anecdotes provided by Brothers Dan Hodges, Bill Lyman, and Tony Darby. Ralph Williams, master of ceremonies, introduced
the speakers after welcoming the guests and introducing the alumni. Later in the evening, favors of crested lockets were presented
to the feminine guests.

Representing the fraternity in the Pan-Hellenic Figure Friday night were Miss Martha Brandon of Queens College with Walter Wooten, and
Miss Mona Moseley of Charlotte with Dan Hodges, alternate.

Pi Kappa Phi
Last weekend was an eventful one for the Pi Kapps. Almost the entire chapter was represented at the dances. The
chapter’s sponsors were Miss “Mandy” Morgan and Miss Frances Roebuck. The chapter did itself proud in having so many charming
dates. The chapter held its banquet at Thacker’s Friday night, which was well attended and enjoyed by all. Brother Larkin
was the toastmaster and presented an enjoyable program. The chapter was honored by the presence of Mr. and Mrs. McGill
and Professor and Mrs. Mebane. Guests of the fraternity over the weekend were Herman Walker and Billy Ballentine of Greenville,
S.C., John McQueen of Bristol, Va., and Mrs. Parks of Bristol, Va. Brother Covington visited the chapter while awaiting his
induction into the army.

Phi Delta Theta
The Phi’s took advantage of a perfect weekend to have one of the best times ever had at Davidson dances.
After the concert with Teddy Powell playing, the frat entertained their dates at a Vogue banquet at the Hotel Charlotte.
Brother Rudolph acted as toastmaster. Each girl was introduced and presented with defense stamps, in keeping with national defense. A
delicious feed was served at the house after the dance Friday night, at which time Miss Sybil Trexler was announced
as sponsor for the fraternity.

Kappa Alpha
With two gala banquets presenting additional entertainment to the ever-colorful Midwinters weekend, Davidson’s Kappa Alphas released themselves from the grip
of studying and took full advantage of their varied opportunities. Dr. Frazer Hood stole the limelight of the Friday night
fraternity banquet at Thacker’s, when he was presented with a beautiful loving cup as a reward for his fifty years
of faithful service to the Order. Master of ceremonies, Thomas Foreman, introduced Mr. Jackson of the Davidson administration, who gave
a splendid address and in turn, introduced the beloved Dr. Hood.

Saturday night, the entire chapter was treated to a lavish banquet by Mr. and Mrs. W. H. Belk of Charlotte,
who are parents of John, Irwin, and Henderson Belk. Master of ceremonies for the evening was President Charlie Watt, and
the dinner was served in the Tea Room of Belk’s store. All-in-all, it was quite a weekend. The Sigma’s boys
enjoyed themselves and their dates thoroughly at the banquets, reveled in Teddy Powell's offerings, and turned regretfully back to the
campus only after the sun had begun to rise.

Lt. Hank King, last year a Davidson K. A. and this year of the U. S. Marine Corps, attended the
dance set with Peggy Copenhaver and was given a hearty welcome by the chapter.

S. A. E.
Highlighting the dance weekend for the men of S. A. E. was a delightful banquet held in the Gold Room
of Charlotte’s Hotel Wm. R. Barringer, Friday night, preceding the Midwinter Formal. Presiding as toastmaster was Brother Frank Caldwell of
Spartanburg, who, with his clever repartee, was in a large way responsible for the success of the event. Especially welcomed
back on the Davidson scene were old grads, Brothers George Grantham, Poss McLean, Hector McLean, George Vicklen, Jim Currie, and
Buck Powell. The fraternity also enjoyed having as its guests Pledges Jimmy Millikan, Bob Douglas, and Brother Bill Grosse. After
being formally introduced as the chapter sponsor for this year, Miss Millie Brenizer from Charlotte graciously spoke a few words
to the fraternity, expressing her acceptance and felicitations. She was accompanied by Pan-Hel representative Ed Lucas.

After the Friday night dance, Brother Baird treated the brothers and their dates to a feed at Penner’s. It was
attended by eleven couples. Pledge Bill Prichard, when unable to get his date down for the dances, went home to
Kentucky to get her.

It is with pleasure that we announce the pledging of Jack Shelton.
