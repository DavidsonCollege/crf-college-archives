JAMES E. BOYD

Judge James E. Boyd, '66, of the U. S. District Court, Western District of North Carolina, is one of Davidson's well-known former students. He was born in Alamance County, N. C., on February 14, 1845, and was educated at Graham Academy and Davidson College. He served in the Civil War and was admitted to the Bar of North Carolina in 1868. He was a member of the State Legislature in 1874, and from 1880 to 1885 was U. S. District Attorney. From 1897 to 1900 Judge Boyd was Assistant Attorney-General of the United States, giving up this office for the Federal bench, which position he now holds. While Judge Boyd has reached the age where he could retire, he is still serving with great ability. He is one of the best-known citizens of the State and is attracting a good deal of attention at present by the powerful patriotic address he makes at the opening of each court.
