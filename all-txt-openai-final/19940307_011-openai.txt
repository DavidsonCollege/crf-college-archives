Grammys, George Ducas, & Country

First of all, I’d like to thank my editors for leaving "country" capitalized one time in my last article. If any readers actually wrote in and complained about the rampant uncapitalizing of some of my favorite words (I was going to write about God and America, but I was afraid those yellow-bellied sapsuckers might, once again, abuse their authority), I thank them as well. If leaving country capitalized was just a mistake, and none of my “faithful” readers even considered any sort of protest, well then, to heck with you all.

Anyway, back to the Grammys. The best song written for a movie or television show went to “A Whole New World” from Aladdin. Apparently, none of the voters heard the soundtrack to George Strait’s Pure Country. Apparently, none of the voters heard any one of the ten songs that absolutely beat the pants off that flaky “A Whole New World” jingle. Apparently, all the voters (like my editors—country, country, country) have a consuming resentment for the art I praise weekly.

Best collaborative effort (in country, country, country) went to Reba McEntire and Linda Davis for “Does He Love You.” I don’t know if anyone noticed, but Reba is arguing with Linda over who has more right to the man who two-timed them both! What an idiotic song. The two floozies should team up and beat the living fool out of the dude.

Now, on with my article. Apparently, the voters never heard Clint Black’s duet with Wynonna. “A Bad Goodbye” is well written, tastefully executed, and addresses a somewhat plausible subject. Clint and Wynonna are great. I know it. You know it. The whole world knows it. The Grammys were pathetic.

Contemporary Writers
By Ashley Payne

This past Monday afternoon, the 900 Room was teeming with creativity as Max Childers and Robin Hemley held a reading of their works. Childers, weary of reading from his second novel Alpha Omega, treated his audience to the opening chapter from his first collection of short stories, All You Can Eat. He described the story as a cross between Leave it to Beaver and Invasion of the Body Snatchers. The narrator, Jack, tells of going to a “Pancake Social” with his wife Sarah, and his son Jamie. They go to the church social not out of a desire to interact with “church-going people,” but because they have a coupon for free pancakes. Jack, who has been angry all his life, decides he loves Sarah’s fifteen-year-old hairdo and drops his vendetta against the “nice fat man” sitting across the table. At the end of the story, Aunt Jemima is carried out on a stretcher, hardly noticed by anyone but Jack—everyone else is happily eating pancakes.

Hemley combines humor with an attention to the real desires and needs of the human heart. He has recently begun a novel that points to the ideal human goal of getting back to a “sweet and wholesome” life, as the syrup suggests. However, he understands the complexity of the human heart.

FRESHMEN: The Davidsonian needs you. Call the editors - 2148.time, grading papers for his creative writing class. He prepares himself for one particular student, Malone, who insists on writing science fiction stories even though Lewis asked his class to avoid such types of fiction. Lewis confronts the paper (and later the class) by escaping from his usual “bland” remarks to scrawl the word "PUTRID" on the paper. After he unexpectedly demolishes Malone’s paper, he flees to his office.

Malone and his counterparts sit in actor silence, hoping they will think he has gone elsewhere. During this time, Lewis reminisces about his father’s house in North Carolina. Overcome by this drastic turn of events, Lewis growls and chases Malone and his gang as if he were a crazed version of Frankenstein’s monster.

Childers’s writing is light and funny at times although this beginning seems somewhat obvious. The letter notifying him of his inheritance approaches a deus ex machina attempt to create a plot. Childers’s talent should not go unnoticed. His unique style has the capacity to turn a rather common introduction into interesting literature.
