**Inspiring Fall Y. M. C. A. Services Are Conducted By Dr. Robert W. Miles**

“Adjustments” and “Leadership of Jesus in Life” Are Main Topics

**McCLURE IS SONG LEADER**

Speaker is Now Pastor of Presbyterian Church in Lynchburg, Virginia

Starting last Tuesday morning at chapel and continuing through Friday evening, the annual Fall Services of the Y. M. C.
A. were held. The speaker was Dr. Robert W. Miles, pastor of Westminster Presbyterian Church of Lynchburg, Va. The general
themes of the services were “Adjustments,” and “Leadership of Jesus in Life.” Besides the talks at chapel and in the
evening, Dr. Miles had a great many personal interviews with students, helping them solve problems which troubled them. The singing
at the services was led by Albert McClure, who graduated from Davidson last year and is now at Union Theological
Seminary.

In the final address made in the series of meetings conducted by Dr. Robert W. Miles, his text was based
on Philippians, the second chapter, verses 7-11. In opening the meeting, Don King extended to Dr. Miles the sincere appreciation
of the student body for his services, and expressed the hope that Dr. Miles would come again to Davidson on
a similar mission. The speaker began by portraying the graphic relation of man towards God and Christ. It was shown
that God was in one position, man in another, and Christ stood in between serving as a Mediator or Intercessor.
This fact being assumed, the importance of a personal relationship with Christ was readily pointed out; because Christ is our
only hope for salvation and He throws out the challenge to us to live more like Him by patterning our
whole lives with Him as our Ideal.

Briefly outlining the method of gaining a personal relationship with Christ, Dr. Miles stated that naturally the primary feature was
the elimination of sin from our lives. He classified sin into the two groups of omission and commission, and as
the sin of commission had been previously discussed, the remainder of the address was devoted to the defining of the
sin of omission. Dr. Miles gave a striking illustration of this by citing an incident which occurred in a deciding
game of baseball in a world series. It was in the ninth inning with the score tied, and the Yankees
had been retired, leaving the Giants in for the last half of the inning. By dint of good fortune, the
Giants had put two men on bases before the second out, then somebody popped up, making the second out. Another
batter came up, singled to first, driving in a run, and as he saw the runner cross the home plate,
he stopped running as he was on his way from first to second. Evers, the Yankee first baseman, saw the
error and had the ball thrown to second, putting the runner out, and cancelling the winning run. Thus, the batter
who had won the game lost it because he neglected to tag second base. The next day the Yankees won
the tie-off game and consequently the series. A series lost because of a “sin” of omission. Such is our case.
If we do ever so many important things and forget to do—or neglect to do—the primely essential thing, then we
are guilty indeed of the sin of omission.

Another point by which we can get nearer to Christ, our Mediator, was suggested by Dr. Miles in that we
should learn that after all our God suffers, and that we should suffer with Him. In illustrating this fact, a
quotation from the play, “Green Pastures,” was given. In this play reference was made to the comparison of the Negro’s
conception of God to He whom they mentioned as Hosea’s God, the God who suffered. In closing, Dr. Miles said
that if we experienced a real suffering over some sin known to us that by all means we should use
this to build a firm foundation for a real friendship with Christ who had suffered and still suffered for the
sins of His people. This type of relationship was aptly expressed by Paul when he said that he was yearning
for a fellowship with the sufferings of Christ.

**Davidson Dramatic Club Presents Mystery Play**

“The Haunted House” to Be Given by Red and Black Masquers, Dec. 11

On Friday evening, December 11, the Masquers will submit for entertainment their first three-act presentation of the year, “The Haunted
House,” by Owen Davis, which, if it does not cause the hair of the audience to stand erect, is at
least calculated to evoke volleys of laughter, it being farcical in nature, or in the language of the street, to
tickle their jiblets. The play was first produced at the George M. Cohan Theatre in New York on September 2,
1924.

The action of the story takes place in the country home of Edward Evans in Cedar Point, Conn., a house
which, by rumor and on the attestation of Mr. Evans himself, is at odd moments invaded by ghosts, departed spirits,
and the like, which caused footsteps, clanking chains, wild laughter—all in the mysterious room overhead. The neighbors are unusual people,
an author (who has a mania for detective fiction, which is responsible for his writing such as “The Purple Smear,”
etc.), and his tolerating wife. To this peaceful environment come Jack and his bride, the parts of which are taken
by J. Simpson and Miss Mattie McLemore (respective hero and heroine of “The Mayor and the Manicure”), and nothing daunted
by the dread tales of mystery her father, owner of the haunted house, has unfolded, they, the newlyweds, choose this
house for their honeymoon. (This is as much of the story as the reporter was able to pump from the
playmakers.—Ed. note.)

Among those in the cast are E. A. Hancock, Miss Carrie Lena Moffett, remembered from “Suppressed Desires,” Bill McIlwinen, who
again assumes a female role in his inimitable way; Jack Williams, who took Olson in “Bound East for Cardiff”; while
the lead, that of the author who proposes to unravel the ever-thickening mystery, is assumed by J. G. Womble, new
on the Masquers’ stage. Finally, but not least important, Ezra, the town constable, and Ed, the affable and unassuming New
York detective, are taken by roommates, the gentlemen who by their skit on Stunt Night took the prize for the
Freshman class, Gordon Wood and Dave McLain. Two parts remain unfilled at present. The play is directed by H. W.
Ervin, while W. A. Flinn is stage manager.

Stage Set No. 3 is in course of construction, and will be ready in a few days for rehearsals. Meanwhile,
the Masquers are casting about for performance dates away from school. It is very probable that the second performance of
“The Haunted House” will be in Statesville, either at Mitchell College or at the Playhouse. At a recent meeting of
the Masquers Key (Continued on page 8)

**I. R. C. Gives Bids to Nine New Members**

The International Relations Club is a national student organization for the purpose of studying and discussing current national problems and
affairs of international scope. Men on the campus who are interested in topics of this nature were invited to write
a paper, and on the basis of these a group was selected. The following nine men were chosen: A. G.
Campbell, Jr., R. P. Davis, J. G. Dunklin, Robert Glasgow, J. W. Lee, A. G. Little, W. R. Morrow, Jr.,
Leland McKeithen, and Arthur Ross.

A. Graham Campbell attended Palmer College at DeFuniak Springs, Fla., for two years and is a member of Phi Delta
Theta social fraternity. Robert Pickens Davis is a member of Le (Continued on page 8)

**Language Association to Convene on November 27**

South Atlantic Modern Language Association to Hold Fourth Annual Meeting in Columbia

Davidson will be well represented at the fourth annual meeting of the South Atlantic Modern Language Association, which will be
held in Columbia, S. C., on November 27 and 28. High school and college teachers of English, French, Spanish, or
German, representing the two Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida, are invited to join the convention and be present at this meeting.

The association was organized in Atlanta in 1928 to give the teachers the opportunity of getting together and discussing the
promotion of these languages and the changes that have come about in them. Various talks will be given, the principal
one an address by Dr. H. C. Lancaster of Johns Hopkins University. Most of the speeches, however, will be given
to special groups concerning the language in which they are particularly interested. The chairmen of the different sections are as
follows: Spanish, Prof. F. K. Fleagle, Davidson College; Dr. A. Varmont, Converse College; Dr. C. A. Drummell, Duke University; English,
Dr. J. S. Hubbell, Duke University. The discussions in the German group will deal chiefly with Goethe, since this isThe
lone hundredth anniversary of his death. Prof. I. J. Erwin, professor of English at Davidson, is president of the association.
The other officer of this organization is the secretary, E. F. Hamff, of Emory University. The executive committee is as
follows: F. C. Taylor, North Carolina; A. Vermont, T. K. Easthurn, Brenau University; E. V. Gage, Florida S. C. W.;
F. W. Bradley, University of South Carolina, Converse College.

The professors from Davidson who are expecting to attend are: Dr. Vowles, Prof. Fleagle, Dr. Watts, Prof. Goldiere, Prof. Blythe,
Dr. Cumming, and Prof. Erwin. However, others who have not definitely decided may attend. Davidson was the host to seventy-five
delegates from twenty different colleges at the third annual convention of the association last year. The assembly at that time
was presided over by Dr. F. W. Bradley, of the University of South Carolina, and the group was formally welcomed
to Davidson by Dr. J. M. McConnell, dean of instruction. At this meeting, it was decided not to invite the
educational institutions in Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, or Alabama to align themselves with the association, because of the great distances separating
the institutions. However, the proposal of inviting certain individuals from these states was adopted.

WILDCATS PRIMED FOR DEMON DEACS

Captain Raker

CHARLOTTE HIGH FIELD TO BE THE SCENE OF ANNUAL GRID CLASSIC

Small, Scrappy Davidson Team Is All Set for Larger Wake Forest Forces

NEITHER TEAM FAVORED

Wake Forest Is Undefeated by Davidson for Ten Years

The Fighting Wildcats of Davidson College will encounter Wake Forest's “Demon Deacons” on Turkey Day at the High School Stadium
in Charlotte on November 26. These two schools have met since 1908 with the Presbyterians holding the upper hand through
1920, and then the long path turned and Wake Forest assumed the ascendency, and has held it ever since, though
the ‘Cats have tied them four times. This year the two teams are very evenly matched as far as comparative
scores are concerned. However, these mean very little when it comes to the final settlement of the query on the
gridiron.

Wake Forest will present a strong team, particularly potent at the tackle berths, where they have two human mountains to
keep the enemy offense in check. The Wildcats, as usual, have a small, scrappy eleven, with an array of shifty
backs led by the diminutive halfback, Charlie Pearce, whose deadly left toe has taken Davidson out of many a hole,
his quick kicks at Chapel Hill being of special notice. The fleetfoots of Davidson, Peabody and Flinn, are expected to
see action, and should give those big linemen something to worry about. But taking it all in all, the teams
look about even when it comes to individual stars. Neither team has had an outstanding success in the percentage column
that deals with wins and losses. But in consideration of their competition, both teams have passed through a creditable season.
Wake Forest’s outstanding victories include a 6-0 victory over the powerful N. C. State eleven which, incidentally, humbled the 'Cats,
18-7, in a nocturnal fracas in the Memorial Stadium in Greensboro; and 12-0 wins over both Erskine and Presbyterian College.
Nevertheless, the gigantic Duke under the tutelage of Wallace Wade, took the “Dekes” into camp by the impressive score of
28-0. Davidson and these same Wade gridders played to a scoreless tie on Richardson Field. Last Saturday both Wake Forest
and Davidson teams were utterly crushed in their attempts against opponents, Davidson bowing to North Carolina, 20-0, while away down
in Georgia Oglethorpe was running through the Baptists at will to run up a 37-0 score against them.

No one can make anything of the scores in that Duke tied. Duke overwhelmed the Deacons, Erskine tied Davidson, and
Wake Forest sunk Erskine. Nothing conclusive can come from that. Both teams’ records for the 1931 season follow:

Wake Forest 0, N. Carolina 6.
Wake Forest 37, Furman 6.
Wake Forest 6, N. C. State 0.
Wake Forest 0, Duke 28.
Wake Forest 12, Erskine 0.
Wake Forest 12, Presbyterian 0.
Wake Forest 0, Oglethorpe 37.

Davidson 13, Elon 2.
Davidson 7, N. C. State 18.
Davidson 0, Duke 0.
Davidson 0, Erskine 0.
Davidson 7, V. M. I. 14.
Davidson 14, Citadel 7.
Davidson 0, N. Carolina 20.

The annual Thanksgiving Day fracas between these two ancient foes is expected to draw the biggest crowd of the year
to Charlotte, and even surpass the attendance of the N. C. State-Clemson game, held in that city earlier in the
year. The fans will undoubtedly see a scrap, with the “Dekes” trying to keep their supremacy.

“Y” DOING VITAL WORK

Davidson is known throughout the South as a church school. No one would dispute the fact that the influences exerted
upon our student body are largely Christian. The efforts of the administration and faculty are centered in this direction. The
“Y” and other religious organizations on the campus attempt to exert such an influence on the thinking, activities, and attitudes
of the campus. It is the aim of their existence. It is the mainspring of their vitality. It is not,
however, an end in itself. It is a means of stimulating the men of our campus to activity. The result
of an influence is the test of its character. It would be impossible to demonstrate some of the results of
this influence which pervades our campus life. Some of the most real are invisible. It is the remote cause of
many of our expressions of our higher selves.

There are, however, some evidences of a response to this influence which are visible. Many men take advantage of the
opportunities for service which are offered to them by the “Y.” Each Sunday there are about 35 men teaching in
nine different Sunday Schools. Services are conducted regularly at the nearby convict camp and at Mecklenburg Sanatorium. At both of
these places, our men supply the only religious services which they receive. It would be safe to say that at
least five hundred people are touched by this group of men. One of the most outstanding pieces of home mission
work in this section of the state is being done by members of our student body. One man devotes his
full time when not in class or engaged in college duties. He holds an up-to-date Sunday School on Sunday afternoons
and conducts an evening service and mid-week prayer service in the local mill village. About six members of the student
body are associated with him in the work of his Sunday School. Four men walk about five miles each Sunday
out to Shearer’s Chapel to hold services and visit during the day. They are doing a most fruitful work at
this point.

In the boys’ work, many men are given an opportunity to continue their interest in scouting. The “Y” supports a
local Scout troop, one in Cornelius, a Hi-Y in Cornelius, and one in Davidson, a negro Scout troop, and a
Boys’ Club for the mill village. About ten men are used in this work, which reaches at least one hundred
and twenty-five boys. The deputation work of the “Y” is one of the most interesting and resultful phases of its
work. These deputations not only render a service to churches in this vicinity, but also serve as a means of
developing active Christian leadership on the part of our men. These groups take charge of young people’s meetings and evening
church services. Some deputations extend over the entire weekend. Thus far, the total number of deputations for the year totals
13 and the number of men who have been sent out is 69. It would be difficult to estimate the
value of the influence of these men on the young life with which they come in contact. The men themselves,
however, receive the greatest benefit from this work in their own personal development.

These are some of the more evident activities of our men outside the circle of campus life. We are familiar
with the activities on our campus. At least three men have a part in each vesper service and three men
are used each week to lead devotionals in chapel. Besides the organized efforts upon our campus, there is evident the
personal activity of individuals. These are not facts which should call forth a feeling of smug satisfaction. Rather, they should
challenge us to loftier heights. It should call forth not only a group response but a response in the heart
and conscience of each man in the student body. It demonstrates that the influence of a church school is, after
all, resultful. When we think, however, of the number and intensity of the influences which have been brought to play
upon this old campus, we realize that we have yet many heights to scale.

There are few men on our campus who are not familiar with the details of the athletic, scholastic, and social
activity of the student body. Perhaps there are many on our campus (Continued on page 8).
