THEDAVI Vol. IV. Davidson Splits Series With Oak Ridge Nine Magic and Music Entertain Audience DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N. C., APRIL 4, 1917. [News and Happenings of The Week in Town Wins First Game By Close Score | The Dietrics Furnish the Last Ly- Social and Personal Items About But Loses Second. Davidson opened her baseball season for 1917 on last Wednesday afternoon by defeating Oak Ridge by the score of 9 to 8. A large crowd was present and christened the new grandstand on Sprunt Field. The weather was a little too cool for fast ball, but the game was exciting throughout and the close score gave the spectators many thrills. The score see-sawed back and forth, Davidson being in the lead at one time and Oak Ridge another. Oak Ridge tied the score in the opening of the ninth, and an extra inning contest seemed imminent, but the Red and Black soon managed to send a man across with the deciding run. “Doty” Pharr played a good game at first for Davidson, besides getting three hits off the opposing pitchers. McMillan at center also played good ball and scored two runs. Hengeveld and Lawson worked in the box for the Red and Black, and both were in good form for an opening game. For Oak Ridge, Barnes did the best playing, striking out nine men, getting two hits, and scoring three runs. Burrus, in center field, also put up a good game for the visitors.

SECOND OAK RIDGE GAME Oak Ridge won the second game of the series on Thursday by the score of 8 to 1. The first five innings was a (Continued on page 6) The sixth and last attraction in the local Lyceum series was presented last Saturday night in Shearer Hall, when the Dietrics gave a delightful program of magic and music. It was probably the best of the whole course, and interest was at a maximum throughout the entertainment. The first part of the program was taken up with tricks of magic by Mr. Dietric, interspersed with witty remarks and playing on words that kept the audience in laughter. His tricks were all good and mystifying. Mrs. Dietric furnished the second part of the program with her whistling, singing, and pantomimes. Her impersonation of a small boy at a moving picture show and the playing of “The Wedding March" as it would be done by a conceited young lady and by one gifted with the art of ragtime were especially good. The last part of the entertainment was musical in character, Mr. and Mrs. Dietric playing popular and classical selections on novelty musical instruments. “May Bells” was played on the chimes, and then a Spanish selection “Senora,” was played on the banjo by Mr. Dietric, accompanied by tambourine, piano, and whistling of Mrs. Dietric, all at the same time. Scottish melodies on the bells and “The American Patrol” on the xylophone were well received, and as a finale, Mr. Dietric played on the xylophone selections from “Mauretania,” “Poet and Peasant,” “Bohemian Girl,” “Faust,” and other operas. MEDALS AWARDED IN FRESH-SOPH DECLAMATION The Fresh-Soph Declamation finals were held in Shearer Hall Monday night. The three “rep” men from each society spoke for the medal given by their respective societies. The declamations were unusually good both in delivery and in the subject matter. The representatives of the Eumenean Society gave the following declamations: A. S. Potts, “Lasca;” R. A. McGirt, “Loyalty to Country;” and L. C. Brand, “The Thunder Storm.” Those from the Philanthropic Society were: W. M. Currie, “The Maid of Orleans;” R. D. Hall, “Address to the Old Confederates;” and J. L. Maddry, “Address to the Democratic Convention.” The speeches were varied and so well given that it was difficult to select the best speakers. After much balloting the judges, Dr. T. M. Douglas and Professors J. L. Douglas, Wood, Reed, and Currie, decided to award the medals to Potts, of the Eumenean, and Hall, of the Philanthropic Society. * * * * * * * * * * * * GAMES THIS WEEK.

Miss Grace Hardie, of Birmingham, Ala, was a week-end visitor at Dr. Arbuckle's.

Misses Mary Richards and Mildred Johnson, who are attending Converse College, are at home for the Easter holidays. Dr. Richards spent last week at Black Mountain, N.C. In his absence, Rev. W. C. Wauchope conducted the midweek prayer meeting.

Mrs. Worth and Miss Catherine Worth left Thursday for an extended trip to Washington, D.C. Dr. Martin left on Saturday, accompanied by Mrs. Martin, to spend Sunday at Red Springs. From there they went to Wilmington, where Dr. Martin spoke on Tuesday.

CONTRACT FOR GYM HAS BEEN AWARDED

After much delay, the plans for the new gymnasium have finally been accepted, and the contract awarded. S. S. Bradshaw, of Salisbury, received the contract for the construction of the building. Mr. Bradshaw intends to begin work right away and expects to complete the gymnasium by next September. R. F. Smallwood, '06, of New York City, drew the plans. With such grounds of hope, it appears as if Davidson may really see a new gym, despite numerous former disappointments.

COLONEL SCOFIELD RECOVERING FROM ILLNESS

Friends among the townspeople and students will be glad to learn that Col. S. C. Scofield is recovering from a serious illness that has lasted during the past two weeks. Because of this illness, his store has been closed to business for some while. Colonel Scofield is now in his sixty-ninth year and has spent half of his life in Davidson. The sympathy of friends in the town and college is extended to him in his sickness.

SEVERAL TRACK MEETS HAVE BEEN ARRANGED

The track squad has been practicing hard this month but has been greatly handicapped by the wet weather. All the old men are showing up well, and several new men look unusually good. The track has recently been put in good shape and will be in much better condition this year than last. Davidson will probably send a delegation to the State meet at Chapel Hill in April. Several meets have been arranged, Clemson, Trinity, North Carolina State, and the University of North Carolina being some of our opponents.

At a meeting of the two classes Monday morning, J. R. Boswell was elected manager of the Sophomore baseball team, and W. E. Mattison was elected manager of the Senior team.

Red and Black Defeat Charlotte Leaguers

Game Won By Rally After Bad Start.

In a comparatively fast game last Saturday, the Red and Black nine defeated the Charlotte League team by the score of 6 to 4. Both teams played hard, and with the exception of the first few innings, when the Davidson team made numerous errors, the game was very interesting. Charlotte led off with three in the initial frame, by virtue of miscues of the Davidson infield and muffs of her outfielders. Neither team scored after this until the third, when Charlotte put another run across. In this same inning, Davidson started things, and after Lawson had walked, Johnson reached first on an error and Wood beat out a bunt, filling the bases. Then Jack Black came across with a single, and Lawson and Johnson scored. Wood soon after scored the third run on McMillan's sacrifice fly to center.

Both teams changed pitchers in the fifth inning, Geary going in for Charlotte, while Worth went in for Davidson. The latter pitched an excellent game during the three innings he worked. In the last half of the sixth, the Red and Black made two more runs. McKinnon, first up, led off with a three-bagger to right. Pharr and Worth walked, with Keesler being put out between the two. Johnson scored McKinnon and Worth with a hit that was fumbled by a Charlotte player. In the beginning of the seventh, both sides again changed pitchers, Fry and Withers being substituted by Charlotte and Davidson, respectively. Davidson scored one more run in the eighth, thus leaving her two runs in advance of her opponents at the close of the game.
