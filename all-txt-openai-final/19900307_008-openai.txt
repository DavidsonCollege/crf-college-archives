**Basketball beats St. Joseph’s, finishes 4-24**

By BRUCE BALESTIER

The Wildcats ended a season of frustration by sending their seniors out in style Saturday night, roaring out to a
big lead, and easily dispatching tiny St. Joseph’s of Maine, 82-61. It was a fun game, and capped a season
that contained very few of those.

The five seniors, Alan Hunter, Jay Schmitt, Mo Gray, A.J. Morgan, and Jeff Harris, started the game to thunderous applause
from the Davidson faithful, and proceeded to dominate the Monks for the game’s first ten minutes. They jumped out to
an 18-0 lead, holding St. Joseph’s scoreless during the opening six minutes, and prompting Giggy Maxwell, a member of Davidson’s
staff of crack statisticians, to pronounce that the contest was “a joke.”

And it certainly seemed that way; St. Joseph’s, a team of NAIA or NCAA Division III status (no one is
sure), looked horrible, leading to speculation that a matchup between the Monks and IMAC A-league champs Mike’s Back might be
more fair. To their credit, St. Joseph's did begin to look better, but the ‘Cats still led 46-27 at the
half.

The second stanza featured more of the same, and though the Monks scratched to within thirteen points twice, the last
time with 8:26 left, the hot shooting and fine play of guards Alan Hunter and A.J. Morgan pounded them into
submission.

Four points in the final minute by freshman J.D. Heuer accounted for the final margin of victory. Morgan finished with
a career-high 13 points, his first journey into double figures, and heard roars of approval from the crowd nearly every
time he touched the ball.

Hunter, for his part, erupted for a career-best 30 points on scintillating 13-17 shooting from the floor, hitting from all
angles in an explosive offensive display. “Sweetpea” complemented his prolific scoring with 9 assists and 7 rebounds.

Both players had saved their finest collegiate performances for their final home game.

It was, as Coach Bob McKillop said, a “very wonderful way to end the season.”
