### Fireside Warmth Cools Hot Tempers

I was working my way through a charming little column on how my fireplace and I discussed my future one
late Saturday night when my attention was diverted by details of a friend being hounded into a corner by thoughtless
yappings. The details concerned the way he chopped a hole in the wall and dropped out of sight. Surely no
one will shed a Kubla Khan tear over the loss of the rest of my column. And I still intend
to talk about the fire in my fireplace. But I can’t get my mind off this friend and the hounds
that chase him, so a new angle is demanded. I also don’t want to slink into the middle of petty
controversies. Because they’re petty, and that’s my worry.

The past few weeks in Davidson have seen a lot of heated words and boiling charges. Personalities have been dragged
through the mud. It’s all a bit repulsive when one works past the boredom. A kind of perverse glee seems
to have cropped up at the prospects of a few good slugfests. After all, what are Administrations and Trustees for
if not to hiss at? And what are harmless student whims for if not to be crushed?

I, for one, am put off by any controversy that smacks of bitterness and resentment. Sensationalism, misconceptions, mistrust, and slurs
have characterized the crusades of Davidson this fall. And for what? For the sake of a little action, a good
old radical-days-are-here-again fight. It seems that the prevalent charge of student apathy in the 70s has crept under everyone’s skin
and we’re damned determined to show the world that we can still kick our feet and wave our arms as
frantically as ever. And officials seem to be intent to show that they can still thrash a mean switch on
our legs.

This is a criticism of methods, not issues. If anyone cares to know; yes, I think the college should be
more concerned with the housing it provides; yes, I think the laundry service is inadequate.

### Editor Fails To Sell Pictures

The trouble all began when a friend of mine, walking down the street, was accosted by a seedy-looking character in
a rumpled trench coat. “Hey, mister, take your picture for a dime?” My friend agreed and posed for the snapshot.
“Your picture will come out next year in our picture book; we’ll send you a copy then but you pay
the dime now,” said the decrepit photographer. “By the way, you wanna buy some dirty pictures?” My friend shook his
head, paid his dime, and promptly forgot the incident.

He remembered it a year later. A notice in the mail informed him that he would soon receive his copy
of the annual picture book of the Society for the Advancement of the Erotic Arts. The next morning, to his
surprise, he learned that the government had raided the office of the Society and seized all copies of the picture
book. My friend, irritated over this turn of events, called the government offices.

“ICP offices,” came a voice from the other end. “How come I can’t get my picture book?” he asked. “Well,
the Chairman has declared that the volume contains dangerous, obscene, and inflammatory material. Besides, his picture didn’t turn out well.
Anyway, the government has scheduled a bonfire tonight and all the confiscated copies will be burned. The public is invited,
and we’re going to have a marshmallow roast after the books are burned. It’ll be one of the biggest social
events of the year.”

“What’s next on the agenda, another book burning?” my friend inquired dryly. “Say, that’s not a bad idea. Let me
speak to the Chairman about that.” “Look, I just want my picture book. What about the first amendment?” “That’s inoperable
in this situation,” he snapped. My friend hung up disgustedly and then decided to visit the Society. Its office was
a dingy hole in a rundown section in a sleazy part of town. The editor himself greeted him as he
entered. “Wanna buy some dirty pictures, mac?” “No, I just want to know when I can get my picture book.”
The editor replied with several unprintable words. “The government has blocked the progress of truth, beauty, and art,” he added.
“But we won’t take this passively. We'll go underground and print whatever words and pictures we want, maybe even some
foldouts.”

“Aren’t the controversial expressions rather worn-out and trite, anyway?” “Oh, triteness is definitely in this year,” the editor assured him.
“Many prestigious books have used such trite expressions. Besides, it’s so much easier than originality.” “All I want is my
picture book,” muttered my friend as he left. Before he got out of the building, however, another member of the
picture book staff hurried up to him. “Wanna buy some—” “No, I don’t want any pictures,” he snarled, losing control
rapidly. “All I want is my picture book!” “If you don’t want no pictures, maybe you like to buy my
sister. I sell her to you real cheap.” My friend hit him.Dry is an unpleasant obligation placed on students; yes,
I think we should have the right to publish an annual that is a free expression of a student’s view
of life at Davidson. For what it’s worth, I also refuse to read the “Update” because I think much of
it is obscene in a larger sense of the word. These issues need to be discussed. Discussed, not slugged about.
When the slugging starts, I exercise my right to yawn and retreat to my fireplace. It crackles comfortingly, and only
occasionally shoots out a spark that it really can’t help releasing. It keeps its head (and teaches me a good
bit about keeping mine) when everyone about me is losing theirs. A gentle friend when gentle words are at a
premium.

Objections to the spirit of compromise and sane dialogue are inevitable. After all, why not fight fire with fire? If
officials don’t respond to reason, then what are we left to fight with? How will wrongs be redressed? Because, my
dear Watson, when fire is fought with fire, everyone loses. We are polarized, we resent, we become quick to accuse
and hesitate to ever listen. Vitriolic passions reign. I’m seeing victims already. One is this friend whose talents are now
all his own after turning his back on the barking. The loss is his and ours.

I seem to remember a principle called turning the other cheek. Why be so quick to slap back? No one
says you have to like every minute here. Turn your back when passions boil over and retreat to a fireplace.
There’s something to be said for the power of positive example. In the emotionally charged atmosphere of England during World
War I, great outrage met the quiet and reasoning voices of pacifists who refused to abandon their principles and enter
the passionate slaughter. Great pains were taken in examining conscientious objectors to try to draw them out in prejudice. An
example of the triumph of calm principle can be drawn from the following exchange. Lytton Strachey, a historian of biting
wit, was asked by the C.O. examiner the classic question of what would he do if he saw a German
officer trying to rape his sister. His reply: “I should try to get between them.”

If we can remain calm and honorable in our own portions of discussions, then we may at times be blessed
with such wit that will slice to the heart of an opponent’s absurdities. If we instead spit back or start
the spitting, then we all may remain blind.

Rowe Questions Hierarchy Of Values, Canterbury Retires After Three Years

To the Editor:

Recently, our 1973-74 annuals, which most of us were patiently awaiting, were to have arrived. However, they did not arrive
due to “an act of by the office of the president” (as our elected and self-appointed student leaders so aptly
put it in a newsletter dated Oct. 22). As many students will agree, this does interfere with the freedom of
press and shouldn’t be allowed. Thus, our aspiring student dissidents have attempted a massive mobilization of the student body to
confront the trustees over Sam Spencer’s decision. This has been achieved to a large degree; at least in thought, if
not in action.

Well, this student wrath over a couple of “objectionable” words and pictures brings out one disturbing question in my mind:
just where do Davidson students last 137 years Davidson College has followed a policy of denying non-Christians tenure and actually
demanding that faculty members sign a statement to the effect that they are “active Christians” before being granted tenure. This
seems to be a gross form of discrimination not only denying freedom of speech, but also freedom of religion. Non-Christian
professors are not merely censored but are in essence eliminated from Davidson academic life. This definitely seems to be in
conflict with the Christian “golden rule.” But, I guess our dear Christian trustees feel it their duty to protect Davidson’s
“Christian commitment,” by seeing to it that students’ faith remains strong from lack of exposure to other beliefs. After all,
a non-Christian professor might lead all the poor students astray.

Also, have you ever noticed how many blacks and women are on our illustrious faculty? Is it that Davidson can’t
find any qualified blacks or women or maybe it doesn’t care to look for them. I don’t really know, but
I’d like to hear a pretty good reason. I mean what is more important: an annual exhibiting an unidentified person’s
ex-penis or one’s school treating all fairly in hiring and tenure-granting practices. I would give the latter much greater importance
and I had hoped our student leaders would also. They haven’t. Think about it, and maybe next time instead of
telling a trustee that you think student publications should print what they see fit, you’ll at least first tell him
what you think of Davidson’s “Christian commitment.”

David Rowe '76
Davidson College

I wish to note the passing of a distinctive figure in campus politics. Steve has for three years given awesome
amounts of energy, time, and favorably to the advancement of Davidson students and the betterment of the college.
