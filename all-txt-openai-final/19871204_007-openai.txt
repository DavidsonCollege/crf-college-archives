**Trading Places: oh, my, we liked it**  
By CHARLES HOUTCH and JOHN HUCKINSON  

*Trading Places* is a great movie. Go see it. Five or six times. Say, that was kind of short, wasn’t it? Aren’t reviews supposed to be longer? So what else can be said about it? Well, it’s going to be playing Friday at 7:30 & 9:45 in the 900 Room, and has Eddie Murphy, Dan Aykroyd, and Jamie Lee Curtis in it. And her hooters, but we’re not allowed to talk about those. There. Rats, it’s still too short.

Well, all right. *Trading Places* is a fine film that addresses one of the timeless questions of human existence, whether it’s heredity or environment that determines human behavior. Sort of. Okay, so it addresses it in a very superficial way, but it doesn’t matter since the movie doesn’t really try to make a statement about anything. What *Trading Places* does do is to set Murphy and Aykroyd up as guinea pigs in an experiment that results in a very funny movie. Their characters represent opposite extremes of the social scale: Murphy is Billy Ray Valentine, a young streetwise black man from the ghetto, whose history includes a broken home and juvenile offenses. Aykroyd is Louis Winthorp, a snobby Exeter and Harvard graduate who is managing director of Duke and Duke, a Philadelphia brokerage house.

Enter the diabolical Duke brothers, played by veteran actors Ralph Bellamy and Don Ameche, aging heads of Duke and Duke and aspiring behavioral scientists. In order to settle their personal argument over the nature vs. nurture controversy, they make a bet over our heroes’ success or failure if their social positions are reversed. The amount at stake? One dollar. For that measly sum, they proceed to wreck Winthorp’s life while dragging Valentine from the ghetto to the corporate boardroom.

**INTERESTED IN SPORTSMEDICINE?**  
The Sportsmedicine department is looking for Volunteer Student Athletic Trainers to assist in the prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation of athletic injuries. Flexible Hours, Educational Experience, Challenges, and fun. If interested or have any questions, call us at 892-2000 ext. 362 or come by the Training Room located in the gym. Ask for Chuck Voyles or Jeff Gephart. Thank you.

The ensuing confusion and final revenge on the evil Dukes provides, at the very least, good entertainment for two hours. How’s that? More? How much more? O.K., fine. But what else is there? ...Oh yeah, it was directed by John Landis, of *Animal House* and *Twilight Zone* fame. Having learned his lesson, he uses no helicopters in this film, successfully avoiding the decapitation of any of his stars. Despite the lack of accidents, Landis comes up with a well-constructed film, using the two former *Saturday Night Live* stars to, if not their full potential, then to a degree sufficient to make a fun movie and buttloads of money.

The characters, if stereotypical in some ways, play off of one another in a very entertaining fashion. In short, *Trading Places* is a great movie. Go see it. And if you don’t like it, well, tough.Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and punctuation:

Student-faculty relations studied

By Russell Booker

Fifteen Years Ago -- November 10, 1972 (LXII, 8)

The problems of faculty-student relations are being examined at Davidson, where much is made of the relationship between faculty and students. Problems cited are a minuscule amount of social contact between professors and students, inadequate advising of students regarding graduate school, and an unwillingness among many students to approach their professors, even for academic help, for fear of being seen by their peers as "brown-nosers." Professors claim that students do not take the initiative. Some professors have said that the faculty open house died due mainly to student indifference. Dean of Students Will H. Terry adds that, when it comes to relations with the faculty, students often "have been careless to the point of being rude." Many students agree that students should take more initiative in the area of faculty relations. One junior observed that every time he has seen a student take the initiative, he has seen him develop a good relationship with that faculty member. The SGA is releasing a poll on faculty-student relations -- advisor/advisee relationship. Freshman and graduate school advising are the two major topics of the survey, with which both students and faculty will present their opinions on the quality of the counsel given to students at the college.

Five Years Ago -- November 5, 1982 (LXXII, 6)

Fall Convocation will be held to begin Parents’ Weekend, Nov. 5-7. At the Convocation, President Samuel R. Spencer and Vice-President for Academic Affairs T. C. Price Zimmermann will preside and confer honorary degrees on John C. West, a former governor of South Carolina and a former ambassador to Saudi Arabia, and Mira Phailbus, President of Kinnaird College for Women in Lahore, Pakistan. Other awards to be presented at Convocation are: The Thomas Jefferson Award, given to an outstanding faculty member; the Goodwin-Exxon award, given to the sophomore, junior, and senior who exemplify the highest standards of character and consideration of others; and the Alumni Association award, which recognizes the sophomore with the highest GPA in his freshman year. Omicron Delta Kappa will tap new members at Convocation, and the Department of Military Science will present its awards to ROTC cadets.

Economics chairman Charles E. Ratliff, Jr. has been elected to the Board of Directors of Bread for the World. This Christian citizens’ movement lobbies Congress for legislation to help efforts against world hunger. Dr. Ratliff’s association with Bread for the World dates to the organization’s founding in 1970. Dr. Ratliff has returned from a two-year stay in Pakistan, asserting, "I came back to this country very aware of the need for action to eliminate hunger not only through church groups, but through the public sector as well."
