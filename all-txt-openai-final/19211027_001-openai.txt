College Life in China Subject of Y Meeting
Education Has Done for the Sleeping Giant.

Dr. Donald Richardson addressed the Y. M. C. A. last Sunday evening in a most unique and interesting manner on the subject “College Life in China.” Doctor Richardson is a graduate of Davidson and Princeton Theological Seminary, and is now serving humanity as vice-president and teacher of Union Theological Seminary of Nanking, China. He is in this country on furlough.

After giving a brief description of the geography of China, the speaker stated that the Chinese differ from Americans in almost everything except their educational system. A Chinese mariner’s compass points to the south. Instead of shaking hands as English people do, they shake their own hands. Dessert is served before instead of after meals. Chinese children are first named at eight years of age. Their names are changed at different periods of growth. They often purchase their coffins before their death.

The educational system of China is very similar to that of the United States except that physical training is a new thing in Chinese schools. Chinese children start to school at seven or eight years of age. Formerly, girls were not allowed to go to school, but now the schools are open to both boys and girls. China is at last beginning to realize the value of education. Several large American universities have branches in China, among which are Yale and Washington and Lee. The largest Presbyterian Seminary in the world is at Nanking. The Hangchow Christian College, a large institution, is conducted jointly by the Northern and Southern Presbyterian Churches. Education has converted the great empire of China into a republic. American educators in China are rapidly cementing the friendship of China and the United States and are molding Chinese thought and civilization according to American ideals. The door to China is open wider than it has ever been before. Unless the best of American manhood enters and gives China their sympathy and aid in solving their religious problems, the door may be closed within the next ten years. Religion is their great need. Their hope is

Juniors Beaten By Sophs And Win From Freshmen

The gym was again the center of interest on the campus for there was staged another of the interesting inter-class basketball games. Juniors met the Sophs. From whistle to whistle both teams fought hard and played good basketball. At the end of the first half, things looked a little bad for the Junior supporters as the Sophs were leading by seven points. Juniors, with the never-say-die spirit, were able to come back in the second half and when the whistle blew had run up 23 points. The Sophs had 24.

Houghton was easily the star for the Junior five. His ability to find the basket was a large factor in the comeback of the Juniors in the second half, almost causing the Juniors to win. McConnell was the star for the Sophs.

DR. HENRY LOUIS SMITH TO LECTURE ON ENGLISH LIFE

The committee on lectures has been very fortunate in securing Dr. Henry Louis Smith, a lecturer of national repute, to speak next Monday night at 7:30 on “Glimpses of English Life.” Dr. Smith was sent over to England last summer by the State of Virginia to make an address at the unveiling of the Statue of Washington which was placed in Trafalgar Square, in the heart of the city of London. This statue is a replica of the famous Houdon statue in the capital at Richmond. For several days Dr. and Mrs. Smith were the guests of the British government and shown attention which that government is able to show distinguished guests. The lecture committee has asked him to tell of some of his experiences while over in that country this summer. A large crowd is expected as Dr. Smith has many friends in this vicinity, having graduated here and having acted in the position of professor of Physics for 14 years.

Class Basketball Holding Interest Second Only to Football.

On last Tuesday night, October 8th, the gym was again the center of interest on the campus for there was staged another of the interesting inter-class basketball games. Juniors met the Sophs. From whistle to whistle both teams fought hard and played good basketball. At the end of the first half, things looked a little bad for the Junior supporters as the Sophs were leading by seven points. Juniors, with the never-say-die spirit, were able to come back in the second half and when the whistle blew had run up 23 points. The Sophs had 24.

STUDENTS AND PROFESSORS FORM PHYSICS FRATERNITY

A Physics fraternity has been organized for the purpose of promoting scholarship and friendship among the students and faculty members of Davidson College who are interested in the science of Physics. This club is to be called Sigma Phi Sigma, and is to be the Alpha chapter. The present members are: Dr. J. M. Douglas, Prof. W. W. Woods, Prof. L. M. Currie, R. M. Brice, M. C. Dew, W. K. McCain, R. H. Poole, J. K. Price. Especial emphasis is placed upon scholarship—a grade of 88 being required for one year before a student is eligible for membership. The student members are to be chosen from the Junior class each year. This fraternity will fill a long-felt need on the campus for an incentive to the study of higher Physics and no doubt will soon be a strong rival to Gamma Sigma Epsilon, the Chemical fraternity.

COACHING CLASSES BEING CONDUCTED

The faculty has worked out for the first time a system of coaching classes, whereby they hope to put on their feet again those who have made a bad start in the year’s work in the freshman class. Professors are conducting these classes in most of the departments. The assignments are as follows: F. Wildman, D. P. McGeachy, W. W. Moore, and R. A. McIlwaine; Greek, D. H. Ogden; Latin, J. C. Bailey; French, Talley Elliot and W. S. Buchanan; German, A. C. Ormand. Professor Fleagle is conducting the Spanish coaching classes in person. These classes are held in most cases in the classrooms of the respective departments.

Thirteen Men Already at Work on Their Oratorical Masterpieces.

The faculty has granted permission for the Senior Speaking of 1922 to be held on November 25th, 26th, and 27th, with a holiday for Saturday the 26th and very probably Friday the 25th.2sth. A meeting was held by prospective speakers last Friday night at which it was decided that if as many as sixteen desire to speak, the contest would be held in two sessions. In case there are less than sixteen, there will be a preliminary session at which the speakers for the final event shall be chosen. The coaches in the various departments have not yet chosen the subjects for the various speeches. However, from the number and quality of the Seniors who have expressed their intention to speak, we can assume that Senior Speaking this year will be the best held in recent years. The speakers up to date are as follows: L. A. Wooten, G. N. Neal, Rolston Bitzer, C. G. Brown, T. A. Freeman, P. D. Miller, J. C. Wool, J. F. Clark, E. E. Houghton, A. C. Summers, W. W. Moore, J. I. Knight, and J. L. Parks.

HELD FOR MANY STUDENTS

The Davidson Faculty is now trying to accommodate more students. Student instructors are being utilized. These classes meet three times a week. Louis Smith, a Davidson alumnus of national repute, has been involved.

Davidson Defeats Team From Trinity in Tennis

All Matches Well Played and Hotly Contested by Both Teams.

In a fast and exciting tournament on the local courts Thursday afternoon, the Davidson team defeated the State team from Trinity. The tournament was marked by hard and close matches throughout, especially by the brilliant playing of Ormond and Cunningham for the visitors. That Davidson is really interested in inter-collegiate tennis was clearly demonstrated by the number of students and faculty members out to witness the tournament. The two doubles matches were split, but the Wildcats took three out of four of the singles, thereby avenging their last year’s defeat at the hands of the Methodists.

Ormond and Cunningham, D. C., defeated Tabor and Turrentine, T., 2-6, 6-1, 6-4.
Powell and Lefler, T., defeated Bradley and Wilkinson, D. C., 6-4, 6-3.
Cunningham, D. C., defeated Turrentine, T., 6-4, 6-0.
Lefler, T., defeated Wilkinson, D. C., 6-1, 3-6, 6-1.
Bradley, D. C., defeated Tabor, T., 6-1, 6-1.
Ormond, D. C., defeated Powell, T., 4-6, 6-0, 6-4.

With the other matches completed, the tournament hung on the final match between Ormond and Powell. Powell took the first set 6-4, but Ormond, showing a reversal of form, took the second, 6-0. The final set was nip and tuck. Powell was easily the star of the visitors. With the score 4-all, Ormond, who had worn his opponent down, walked away with the last two games and the match, 4-6, 6-0, 6-4.

In the first doubles match, Ormond and Cunningham, D. C., were paired against Tabor and Turrentine, T. This match was a fight to the finish, but the Red and Black finally came out on top to the tune of 2-6, 6-1, 6-4. The teamwork in this match was splendid, but it was marked by the serving of Turrentine and the speedy net-work of Cunningham. In the second doubles, Bradley and Wilkinson, D. C., were paired against Powell and Lefler, T. The visitors easily walked away with this match, 6-4, 6-3. Bradley and Wilkinson could not get together.

Davidson Loses to Wildcats 87-0

Davidson Makes Thirty-four First Downs and Gains over 800 Yards.

The missing link in Coach Grey’s Little Electric Machine has been found. The Wofford Terriers were fed into the machine by Manager Price last Saturday and they came out in the form of 87-0 sausage. The Davidson Wildcats greedily devoured the canines in six and seven-point hunks. The Davidson team looked like a million dollars beside the Terrier aggregation and succeeded in pushing over 13 touchdowns. End runs were the main factor in piling up the 853 yards gained by the Flying Squadron, but forward passes also came in for their share of glory. Moore and Erwin flitted around the flanks for 206 yards while the flips of Crawford and McFadden were good for 186 paces.

Wofford tried every trick known to football strategy to find a leak in the Davidson defense, but it was all in vain. Their passes were blocked by red-jerseyed athletes; their line plunges were stopped by the thin Red line; their fakes were broken up before they reached the line of scrimmage; while their punts were usually returned to the spot from which they were started.

Erwin and Moore were simply amazing. The midget backs did everything and did it to a Queen's taste. Sam Neesler and Tiny Graham were marvels in their day and greatly feared by the opposing teams, but the luster that followed the cleated shoes of Luke and Spratt rivaled that of the former stars. The quality of work was no surprise. The supporters of the Red and Black feel safe when the oval is in the hands of the back who doesn't know how to fumble, never gets knocked out, and who averages ten yards whenever he carries the ball.

But the stellar work of the Honea Path flash was the outstanding feature of the game. Light of weight and frail of build, he showed remarkable versatility. He carried the pigskin six times, and although on one occasion he was stopped without a gain, he averaged 28 yards on his runs. When he started around end he was like a flash of lightning, and Wofford only stopped him by diving at the line of sparks which trailed after him. He scored three touchdowns, two of which came after he had snatched long passes from Crawford.
