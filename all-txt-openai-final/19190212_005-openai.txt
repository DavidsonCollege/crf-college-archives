Quality and Service

Who Wants a Poor Thing Right on Time?
Who Wants a FINE Thing TOO LATE?

The best printing obtainable and a service just as good. We give both quality and service and charge for both.
The service is generally as valuable as the effectiveness of the work done. Let us convince you.

LAST YEAR'S TEAM

Last year the Davidson team played W. & L., V. M. I., V. P. I., and Roanoke on their invasion
of Virginia. Three of these games were Wildcat victories. The team consisted of G. M. King, J. W. McAlister, L.
C. McAskill, H. W. Davenport, A. R. Flowers, and F. W. Hengeveld.

Coach Fetzer has played in the big league two years. He knows baseball, and he knows that the men who
play the game as it ought to be played are those who stick. It is this quality that makes the
Davidson teams known as the hardest fighting teams in the South.

Baseball Practicing Begins This Week

Nine Letter Men On Hill Make Prospects Especially Bright.

As the weather grows warm and spring approaches, the college man's fancy turns to two things—the fair sex and baseball.
Although the former are scarce, there is every prospect for a championship baseball team.

With nine letter men back, there is no reason why Davidson should not make a clean record through the South.
Ratchford, Sutton, Boswell, and Cassel make an infield hard to beat. Spann, Richards, and Miley form a fast, hard-hitting outfield.
Clark and Currie hold the box. Johnson and Sullivan, of last year’s squad, will try out for catcher. Robson and
McArn are expected to push Ratchford and Sutton for their positions.

It is too early for a schedule as yet. A game has been secured with Carolina, to be played at
Winston-Salem, April 21. This is the only contest signed so far. However, it is almost certain that two five-day trips
will be arranged, one through the State, and one through South Carolina, and Georgia Tech. has asked for a game.

Practice begins this week. With such a good schedule in sight, a large number of new men should be on
the field. All men who can play baseball should come out and stay out. They are the men that make
the Varsity. These men should remember that the man who makes a team at Davidson is the man who works
and sticks to it.

LOST—Saturday night at the basketball game, a gold bar pin. Finder must notify Miss Bertie Christenbury, Davidson, and receive liberal
reward.
