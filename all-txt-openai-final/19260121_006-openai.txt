**THE WITTY DENT ASSISTANT**

The following is a letter written by the famous Droopy Hudgins to his Hard Hearted Hannah. As he always makes
a carbon copy of his letters, he submitted this for our disapproval. If you are having trouble in your love
affairs, see Droop; he writes these and similar letters free of all charges for 50 cents each.

Dear Sweetie:

If the log turns over I will drown, therefore don’t send me no wood for Xmas. Our dog is very
sick and we are afraid he has been eating dogwood. We have a fine place here, and are far from
the madding (or maddening) crowd. We are so far back in the woods that there isn’t even a footpath, so
we have to walk the last mile on our hands. It is so far from anything back here that it
takes three days for the sun to travel and we haven’t had any sunlight for a week on account of
the pipes being frozen which bring the sunlight back to us. We are having a fine time with only the
frogs and bugs to keep us company. When we crave excitement, we can get plenty of it by going out
and killing a couple of mosquitoes and hanging them up to dry. We go to the city once a month
and have a fine time then. The only trouble is that it takes us 14 days to get there and
14 days to get back, so we only have two days to spend in the city. Last February we met
ourselves coming back before we got there. We have only two days to spend there, and as we have nothing
to spend when we get there.

The right Reverend Thomas C. A. Lawson, D.D., on the barn-storming tour of the Cowboys, became so infatuated with the
spectacle before his eyes at Blowing Rock that he could not resist giving an exhibition of the latest Charleston steps
upon the ice. However, tragedy left its mark upon his frame, and he now sports a deep red gash upon
his head. We still insist that the hardest thing about ice-skating is the ice!

Mr. Francis Wilkinson, who starred so nobly in “Tailor Made,” has made the startling statement that “Love is the only
fire upon which you can get no insurance.” The rough and ready Robert W. Graves, that notorious inhabitant of the
wild and woolly wastes of Georgia, has announced that immediately after the presentation of “The Lost World,” he will give
a lengthy dissertation on just how, in his extensive travels, he came in contact with and upon numerous occasions captured
such frightful beasts as pictured in the aforesaid cinema, especially pink elephants and green snakes.

Mr. Robert Missing Link, beautiful member of the younger set of Abbeville, S. C., and widely recognized critic of Boccaccio’s
Decameron, is rumored to have remained on the campus last Sunday afternoon due to inclement weather and pecuniary disability. The
absence of the Missing Link caused many a sad heart on the Winthrop campus, where he has been seen frequently
on Sunday afternoons.

Mr. Would B. Brown, promoter of heathen dramatics and idolatrous worship, is said to have been using the military tactics
of Gideon, using an alarm clock and pitcher to wreak vengeance upon his arch enemies. Mr. Joe Garrison announces his
intention of opening a correspondence school for the perfection of the terpsichorean art. No one but STAGS allowed to enroll.
Practices will be held on Saturday night after the pictures.

Master Garnett Maxmillian, youthful prodigy of 13 years, whose superhuman intellectual capabilities have won the admiration of local psychology experts,
is said to have been recently elected to membership in the mystic society of Sons and Daughters I Will Arise.
Maximillian’s election to this noted organization while still so young is a source of gratification to his mother and father,
who insist that he has shown unusual mental traits since the day after his birth, on which occasion he is
said to have recited without mistake Sappho’s Odes in Greek.

**Literary Societies**

At a meeting of the Metrophilian Literary Society last Thursday evening, it was unanimously decided to turn the hall, which
was given to them by the college, to the Y. M. C. A. for its use. This hall, which was
formerly occupied by the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, is located in the lower part of the Philanthropic Society Hall. It
would cost the Metrophilians about one thousand dollars to furnish this room so that it could be used as a
society hall and the society did not feel that it was quite equal to this heavy burden. Added to this,
the Philanthropic hall could be used without in any way interfering with the Philanthropic society, so it was quite agreeable
from all angles that the Y. M. C. A. have this hall. It is given to the Y. M. C.
A. in the form of a three-year lease. The expenses in connection with the upkeep of the hall have been
arranged between the two organizations. The Y. M. C. A. has for some time been very much handicapped by not
having a hall within easy reach of all, its only quarters being in the gymnasium. The Y. M. C. A.
proposed to furnish this room and maintain a kind of social hall and library where the boys may get together
and talk or study and feel perfectly at home.

**State Glee Club Contest to be Staged at Durham**

Winner Will be Given New York Trip to Try for Additional Honors

The North Carolina Association of Glee Clubs will hold its annual Glee Club Contest in February at Durham. All glee
clubs which are members of this association are eligible for entry into this contest. The Davidson College Club, which previous
to this year has taken no part in this association, will be represented this year. All of the prominent college
glee clubs in the state are members of this association and will therefore participate in the contest. There are requirements
of the clubs other than membership in this association in order to be eligible for the contest. Each club can
only be represented by thirty men and these men must not only be members of their particular club but they
must also be taking a full course in undergraduate study. Each club will give three choruses in this contest. One
chorus will be the prize song, that is, the song which every club will be required to sing and upon
which the decision to a large extent will be based.Here is the cleaned OCR text, preserving the original meaning and

We don’t spend it because we don’t know what to spend it for. My dearest sweetie, when I think of
you, you remind me of the moonshine, and I become intoxicated. It is now the first day of January, and
the sad, sad memories of the days that I can’t recall overwhelm me. (If you wish to weep at this
point, please use a handkerchief, as this is expensive stationery). I sure do hope you have a happy new year,
and if I can find that ten cents I’ve been saving, I’m sure going to send you some candy as
I think a lot of you, as you can easily see because I spent thirty cents on you last summer
and only had ten dates with you. Don’t worry, though, for I will never let Papa know how extravagant I
was. I hear that you are planning to get married. Well, I don’t believe I’ll send you that candy.

I guess you will do pretty good by marrying that young feller, but of course, you couldn't do as well
as if you had married me—as I am handsome, good-looking, attractive, sweet, gentle, have unkissable lips, am well-bred, and would
tell you about myself if modesty did not prohibit my doing so. Well, sweetie, here’s wishing you a happy marriage
and a merry honeymoon. Again, I hope you will have a happy married life, but I don’t much expect you
to, as you made a great mistake in not marrying me. I am enclosing a bill covering everything that I
spent on you, and I hope you will give it to your future husband at the earliest date so that
I can get back all I ever spent on you. By the way, I think you ought to pay interest,
as I sure was interested in you. Well, good-bye forever, I will call you up tomorrow night.

Your sweet patootie,
Droopy.

Editor’s Note: Perhaps you have a girl that you would like to “kick.” See Droopy, he will write a letter
similar to the above for you, and all of your troubles will be over. The one he sent this letter
to is suing him for manslaughter with intent to kill.

Because of evasive play rehearsals and other things, the attendance at the regular meeting of the Phi Society was slightly
below the average. J. W. Crinkley led the devotional exercises, after which the debate took place. The subject was, “Resolved:
That the Federal Estate Law be repealed.” Geo. Crawford and Frank Hall upheld the affirmative while M. A. Morrison and
S. C. Miller presented the negative side, the affirmative winning. After the main debate, an extemporaneous one was held on
the subject: Snowballing should be abolished by a resolution of the student body.

The judges of this contest will be experts in the quality of musical presentations, and they will base their decisions
on the very requisites of good music. The winner of this state contest will be sent to New York to
take part in a national contest for glee clubs in the U.S., which will be held at a later date.
The Durham Chamber of Commerce will be host to the visiting glee clubs. The contest, although belonging to the association
itself, is being fostered by Paul J. Weaver, the director of music at the University of North Carolina.

Professor Currie to Tour Continent

It has become a custom that every summer a group of Davidson students will spend their summer vacation touring or
studying in Europe and England. Another attractive opportunity is offered to the students to spend a part of their summer
abroad. Dr. A. Currie is co-operating with the Ravenell Co., of Charleston, S.C., in engaging students to take the 37-day
tour offered by that company. The party will sail from New York on June 26th on the S.S. President Harding
and return to New York around August 2nd on the S.S. Republic. The tour is very comprehensive in its scope,
embracing stays in London, Amsterdam, the Hague, a trip down the Rhine into Switzerland, an excursion on Lake Lucerne, a
short stay in Geneva, and a week in Paris. The proposed tour is a very inexpensive one, costing only $397
from New York back to New York, inclusive of accommodations. On the boat and in Europe, the party will travel
in students class, and excellent hotel accommodations.

The regular meeting of the Metrophilian Literary Society was held on Tuesday night, January 14th. Although some of the program
was not carried out on account of the absence of members, a good meeting was enjoyed. The devotional was first
on the program and was led by Roland Sims. This was followed by Current Events given by Hagood. The debate
of the evening was impromptu, the query being, “Resolved: That R.O.T.C. at Davidson College should be abolished.” The affirmative was
upheld by Bill Covington and S.W. Smith, while on the negative were Camp O’Neal and Roland Parker. The judges awarded
the affirmative the decision by a 2 to 1 vote. Before the meeting adjourned, “Spoofy” Hilhouse made a short talk
in which he asked that the society turn over the lower floor of Phi Hall for an office and recreational
room for the “Y.” His request was granted on the condition that the society might take over the floor again
at any time, provided they gave six months’ notice.

With only four lettermen back, Captain Weems has had a little trouble whipping a presentable team into shape. But all
the men have been working faithfully, and the grapplers should continue to give a good account of themselves. They have
a nice schedule ahead of them. Duke, State, Navy, and possibly V.P.I. will be met during the coming season.

Rivalry for the hand of a certain beautiful young co-ed has led four of Davidson’s most gallant young swains to
band themselves together in an immortal band. These heroes have adopted for themselves the title of “The Four-Horsed Men of
the Puckered Lips.”

Farmers aren’t the only ones who make their living from the dirt. Consider Lord Helper.
