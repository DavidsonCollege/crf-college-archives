#### COOKING WITH RACHEL

**Take your palette to the Mediterranean**  
by Rachel Newcomb

The best shish kebabs I’ve ever had were at a hotel on the edge of the Sahara desert at about 11 in the evening. Maybe it was the atmosphere that made them taste so good, or maybe it was the wine, ubiquitously named Les Vieux Papes (The Old Pope), but I think I’ve found the recipe to recreate those flavors. You can do something more interesting with shish kebabs than simply skewering and grilling them. Variations on this recipe can be found all over the Middle East, and the savory marinade makes them among the best shish kebabs you'll ever taste. Impress your friends by whipping this easy recipe out for dinner, or for special occasions.

**Broiled Skewered Beef (Lamb may be substituted)**

- 1 large onion, sliced into rings
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 4 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons salt
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 2 pounds lean boneless beef, cut into cubes
- Cherry tomatoes, as many as desired
- Green pepper
- 2 tablespoons heavy cream

Drop the onion rings into a deep bowl and sprinkle them with the olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Add the beef and turn the pieces about with a spoon to coat them well. Marinate at room temperature for at least two hours, or in the refrigerator for four hours, turning meat occasionally.

You can cook this either on a grill or in a broiler pan with the broiler setting on. With their little slats and one inch of space beneath, broiler pans allow juices from the meat to drip into the pan while cooking. Make sure the pan sits on the lowest possible rack in the oven, about four inches from the heat source.

Take the beef from the marinade and string on skewers, alternating with onions, cherry tomatoes, and green pepper pieces. Brush the meat evenly on all sides with the cream. Broil four inches from heat, turning skewers occasionally, until the vegetables brown richly and the beef is done to your taste. For medium-rare, allow about 10 minutes; for well done, cook a few minutes more. Check after eight minutes just to be sure, and cut open the meat to see how it’s doing in the middle. Be careful not to overcook the vegetables; you may need to take them out earlier if they look finished. Serve over a bed of couscous or rice and enjoy.

**Sex romps through American culture like a gigolo on the job**

It is everywhere, sheathed in the protective latex of the media, teasing us relentlessly, until we beg for satisfaction, until we wish for the fantasies that enter us again and again every day to actualize, to arise in solid form and gratify us. But this rarely happens.

**The Affection SEX**  
The Davidsonian responds to the University of Chicago survey

Sexual episodes we witness on the screen are of less substance than the spray of electrons that make up the images. They are edifices erected by the imagination and thrust upon us—arape of unreality. “What if,” asks our imagination, “I lived at Melrose Place? My sex life would be so exciting.” True. According to Entertainment Weekly, a woman living at Melrose Place would have had 5 sexual partners since July of 1992. Is this how Americans live—vamps of the night, destined to spend eternity sliding into one bed after another? According to the recent report from researchers based at the University of Chicago, absolutely not. The results, to be published as The Social Organization of Sexuality by the University of Chicago Press, indicate a cold-shower America, where the denizens discreetly sip their coffee and watch other people have sex on the television. The results shine a harsh and blinding light on the intimate practices of We, the people. Prone to falling into a routine, we evidently

Heathen Valley investigates Christianity in Appalachia
By Jacob Abraham

Try it someday. Find a good backroad and follow it into the hills of Appalachia. Drive past the college towns, the middle-class suburbs, the shopping centers, and fast-food joints. Leave behind every obvious sign of civilization, and you will still find two things: churches and people. A native of Boone, North Carolina, Romulus Linney knows about the people of the Appalachian mountain area, and he knows about the tremendous influence of Christianity. In Heathen Valley, he takes us back to a time when the civilizing force of Christianity had not yet penetrated the backwoods. The play describes what happens when a young idealist with a strong sense of faith ventures into a town full of primitive, violent, and superstitious people. Written by one of America’s foremost contemporary playwrights, Heathen Valley has won several awards and enjoyed successful runs in regional theaters across the country. Director Ronnie Higdon also worked on the 1990 production of Heathen Valley, which won the Helen Hayes Award for Outstanding Production at The Round House Theater in Washington, D.C. He also handles the scenery and lighting design, which he describes as “probably the most complicated this particular theater has ever seen.” Leslie B. Rindoks provides the costumes. The cast includes a few veterans of the Davidson stage as well as some very talented newcomers. Robert Ramsay, a junior English major who most recently performed in last spring’s The Zoo Story, plays the Episcopal Bishop of North Carolina. The Bishop journeys into “the valley that God forgot” with a bold plan to establish a mission there and teach the people a more civilized way of life through Christianity. He brings with him only an orphan boy and a janitor, who was born in the valley and serves as a guide. The janitor, Starns, is played by Scott Lenhart, a senior English major familiar with audiences from his role in last year’s Buried Child. Freshman Ian Buchanan makes his Davidson stage debut as Billy, the orphan boy who narrates the story. The valley’s inhabitants are alternately amusing and terrifying.
