Red and Black Machine Breaks Even On North Carolina Baseball Journey

Coach Hengeveld’s Poison Nine Takes Wake Forest in Tow for the Second Time of the Season, Wins From Elon, But
Drops Two in a Row to Carolina and State.

On their first road trip of the 1922 season, the Wildcat nine broke even, losing the first two games and
winning the second two: Carolina won a closely contested pitchers’ duel by the score of 2 to 0. State defeated
the Red and Black team to the tune of 5 to 3, although Davidson outhit them. The home team scored
a come-back in the next two games, defeating Wake Forest 14 to 13 in a slugging contest, and downing Elon
9 to 8.

Carolina Game.

The masterly hurling of Lewellyn backed by errorless support enabled Carolina to defeat Davidson Tuesday in the first game of
the Wildcat’s trip by the margin of 2 to 0. The Chapel Hill pitcher held the Presbyterians to two safeties,
a single by Erwin, M., and a triple by McLeod, those being the only two Wildcats to get on the
cushions. Boushee, who was in the firing pit for Davidson, was in great form and should have held the University
team scoreless. Three bad breaks coming in a row in the eighth lap shoved two counters across for Carolina after
the team should have been retired. The first two men up got on safely and were sacrificed along by Shirley.
With the squeeze play on, Lefty Wilson missed the ball and the runner was caught flat-footed between third and home.
McMillan, however, dropped the ball and he returned to third safely. Wilson then proceeded to strike out but McMillan bobbed
the third strike, lost the ball under his feet, and Lefty reached first, clogging the hassocks. To cap the climax,
Casey Morris bounced one to Luke Erwin that looked like a sure double killing. But the agate took a bad
hop over his head and continued to left field, McLean and F. Morris scoring. Old Man Hard Luck turned over
in his grave three times when he heard of the game. Captain Freeman had a big day in the field
for Davidson. He rolled around his post at the hot corner like a well-oiled lawn mower, cutting off several drives
that looked like sure base hits. Eight chances came his way and he handled them all faultlessly.

THE WILDCAT SCREAMS

The old fashioned I used to stay at home when she nothing to wear.

Dr. Taliaferro Thompson Speaks at Vesper Service

Prominent Union Seminary Man Makes Forceful Speech on Sins of Omission.

Basing his talk on the text: “To he that knoweth good and doeth it not, to him it is sin,”
Dr. Taliaferro Thompson brought home to his audience the greatness of the sins of omission at the “Y” service last
Sunday night. In a vigorous and forceful manner he showed that while many think they have lived the right life
when they have merely avoided positive sin, they make a great mistake. He showed this by numerous illustrations and parables.
He cited an example of this kind in the parable of the talents in which the man who had been
meticulously careful to preserve his one talent was cast out because he had not used it in a positive manner
to the advantage of our Lord. Again he showed that the fig tree which Christ cursed, withered because it did
not bring forth fruit. “By their fruits shall ye know them.” Drawing his illustration next from daily life, he said
that there were many ways in which we could live positively for Christ, telling of the case of a boy
who roomed next door to him during his college course and whom he could have helped in many ways but
didn’t, showing the sin of such negative living. Finally he told of the need for men who would devote their
talents, perhaps one, perhaps more, to God. Dealing with this he pointed out a boy who was elected the most
influential man in his class, despite the fact that his talents were few, because he had completely consecrated them to
his Maker.

Track Team Has Difficult Schedule for Next Week

Sprunt Field Will be the Scene of Lively Tilt With University of South Carolina.

The Wildcat track team will have one of the hardest battles of the season next Saturday. South Carolina, fresh from
their wonderful showing in the meet with North Carolina and Georgia, will be the invaders. Every man on the Davidson
squad is looking for a big scrap, and preparations are under way for the event. The South Carolinians are said
to have a great outfit, and the results of the triangular meet seem to bear out the reports. Holding the
lead until the mile relay, their team showed up especially well in the weight events, and there is where the
hardest part of the Davidson meet will come, for the big Wildcats know their business. Waite, who holds the S.
I. A. A. record for the javelin with a throw of 178 feet plus, seems to be THE weight man.
He puts the shot 42 feet 3 inches, and his discus

Vachel Lindsay, Noted Poet.

Davidson to Be Honored by Visit of Famous Poet

Vachel Lindsay Will be at Davidson Next Week in Public Entertainment.

Vachel Lindsay, one of the foremost poets of America, will visit Davidson on April 26. If he cannot be called
the one leading poet, he is certainly among the first four, and his visit to Davidson will linger long in
the memories of those who hear him. Not only is he one of the chief contemporary poets of America, but
he is also a distinguished lecturer and possesses many of the qualities of an orator. Mr. Lindsay regards poetry as
something to be spoken, not merely to be read. The possession of all of these excellent qualities, together with the
fact that the poetry which he will read on the stage in Shearer Hall, at 8:00 p.m. on April 26,
is of his own production, will makeHis performance is not only thoughtful and interpretative but highly interesting. This is his
second trans-continental tour, and he has made such a hit with the public and is so much in demand that
arrangements are being made for a third tour as soon as this one is completed. The following quotation from Temple
Scott in a recent issue of his “Book Guide” will give some idea of what the leading literary men think
of him: “His voice is to me, the one voice in this land of ours which is singing the high
music of the soul.” He has a melodious voice of wide range, is master of the elocutionist’s art, and can
rise, as the occasion requires, to any demand of tragedy or comedy. His whole manner and personality are delightfully original.
It is safe to say that no one just like Vachel Lindsay has ever been heard by a Davidson College
audience.

From university professor to national president is a popular sport these days since our ex-President set the example. Of the
three republics now occupying the territory of the former Austro-Hungarian empire, two have university professors as presidents.

Success is getting what you want; happiness is wanting what you get.

W. A. Gamble Selected as Peace Oratory Contestant
Will Represent Davidson at State Contest in Burlington on April 21st.

In the local preliminaries of the Peace Oratorical contest, W. A. Gamble was selected as the Davidson representative, with D.
H. Ogden as alternate. The finals of this contest will be held in Burlington on April 21. The local contest,
held in Shearer Hall on Monday, April 17, was one full of interest from beginning to end. Gamble, the last
speaker, in an easy, flowing, and eloquent manner pointed out the only “path of peace.” Gripping his auditors from the
start, he showed that the best and only way to true world peace was to be found in the great
League of Nations, conceived by the brain of Woodrow Wilson. This league, based upon the principles laid down by the
Christ of Calvary, is the one route to permanent and lasting peace.

New “Y” Cabinet Selected by Pres.-Elect Crawford
New Men Are Named to Run Affairs of the Student Y. M. C. A. Next Year.

The Y. M. C. A. has shown a larger development this year than any previous year. It has grown to
be a real factor on the campus, mainly because of the earnest cooperation of the students with the cabinet and
officers. It has undertaken work this year that has never been taken up before. The cabinet has worked faithfully under
the leadership of Dwight Chalmers and Julian Price. Next year the “Y” is planning to carry on this work and
with the cooperation of every man on the Hill, it will continue to be a leading activity. If the student
body backs Buck Currie and the new cabinet, the results will be a banner year for the “Y.” The cabinet
for 1922-1923, as appointed by President-elect Pat Crawford, is as follows:

N.C. State Cinder Packers Were Too Strong
The Men From Raleigh Were in Tip-top Shape and Outpointed the Wildcats.

After a nip and tuck contest, the farmers from N.C. State nosed out the Davidson Wildcats in a rather slow
track meet on a soggy Sprunt Field last Friday. In the early stages of the meet, it was impossible to
state who would come out victor. Several times the score was tied, but finally, in the last three events, the
Raleighites were winners by a good margin and nosed out ahead by a total score of 74 1-2 to 50
1-2. Practically all the records were slow and the weight events were not up to standard, but this can be
accounted for by the soggy condition of the track and the high winds with their usual sand and dust which
prevailed. The Tech men won eight first places while the Wildcats garnered but six. The deciding factors, however, were the
seconds and thirds that mounted up in the long run. Knight was the individual star for the Red and Black,
winning first in both the shot and discus. His discus throw of 121 feet 11 inches broke the college record
by a total of six feet. Somebody had better watch their honors in that State meet or Big Knight will
break several more records. Koenig showed up exceptionally well in the dashes. He was nosed out in the 100-yard, getting
only second place, but in the 220 he easily copped first. Gracey, apparently, entered everything. Although not winning a first
place, he placed in a great many and showed his classmates what he could do. With a little more training,
he will make an A-1 track man. Blakeney and Park were the outstanding point gatherers for the Raleighites. The former
won the 880 when he wore out Galloway on the second lap and loped away with the two-mile without seeming
to impair his freshness. Park roped in three first places, taking the high jump, javelin throw, and broad jump. In
the latter event, McGukin would easily have won first except for the fact that he had strained his leg in
the high hurdles. Without overturning a single stand, he easily outdistanced Homewood, State’s star football end, and pulled down a
first place. Rooster McFadden surprised all his admirers when he led his opponent by about 25 yards, winning first place
in the low hurdles.
