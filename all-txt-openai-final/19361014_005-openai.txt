WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 14, 1936 THE DAVIDSONIAN Page Five

Judge sparkles as a chorus line. The invitations to the wedding of Miss Sarah Withers to Mr. Daniel Currie were
sent out last week. Mrs. H. M. Moffett, who returned from the Presbyterian Hospital last Tuesday, is improving nicely and
hopes to be up soon. Mrs. Slaughter of Charlotte, the mother of a daughter, is visiting Mrs. Ackerman on Concord
Road. Mrs. South of Mobile, Ala., last Tuesday after spending a few days in Davidson.

Commercialized Football

DAVIDSON THEATER

Wed.-Thurs. Oct. 14-15
MY MAN GODFREY

A mad and gay picture, sparkling with humor depicting the rehabilitation of a “forgotten man” by a dizzy rich girl.
Lovely Carole Lombard and William Powell make an excellent team. Alice Brady, Gail Patrick, and Jean Dixon make up part
of an able supporting cast.

Friday, Oct. 16
STAR FOR A NIGHT

A tenderly appealing and musical back-stage comedy of errors. Jane Darwell is grand as the sightless mother. Claire Trevor sings;
Arline Judge all wrapped up in a fast-moving story. You can’t help but have a good picture.

Mon. Oct. 18
THE BIG GAME

Just to get your curiosity aroused, you go and see it. A good pass-the-time picture.

Tues. Oct. 19
OLD HUTCH

Wallace Beery as Hutch, the laziest man, discovers a stolen fortune while fishing, and the bewildering events that follow make
up this amusing, and at times pathetic, film. The able support of Elizabeth Patterson and the roles of Eric Linden
and others keep the plot moving.

CARL SANDBURG

Carl Sandburg, author, poet, and lecturer, who delivered a lecture in Chambers Auditorium to the members of the Davidson Student
Body, was the guest of the Sigma Upsilon.

To track down and photograph the factors in this college football boom, the March of Time sent camera crews to
a score of widely scattered colleges, gathering a wealth of exclusive material. To demonstrate that commercialism is definitely on the
uptrend, they point to ivy-clad universities like Yale leasing broadcasting rights to their games to commercial sponsors on nation-wide networks;
to the increase in ballyhooed intersectional games that once were loudly condemned for over-emphasizing amateur sports; to collegiate athletic publicity
bureaus that are more highly geared today in an effort to attract for their own box offices the largest possible
slice of the season’s receipts.

In a comprehensive, fast-moving camera report of what goes on behind the scenes of intercollegiate football, the new issue of
the March of Time, released early in October to more than six thousand, five hundred theatres, declares that the trend
of America’s greatest sports spectacle is towards more and more commercialism.

This fall it is estimated that forty million fans will pay fifty million dollars to college box offices in the
most financially successful season the game has ever known.

A camera crew was sent to Atlanta, Georgia, where pictures were taken of a momentous meeting of the Southeastern Group,
partial to aiding players with student loans and scholarships. An interview with Professor George Owen of Massachusetts Institute of Technology
and father of the famous Harvard All-American is another feature of this interesting film.

Yale University has the addresses of the president, officers, and circle chairmen of the Davidson Auxiliary. Mrs. Whitthoft attended the
District Conference of Auxiliaries in Greensboro on October 9.Miss Miriam Goodrum, now at Dartmouth College alumni. With gigantic profits like
these at stake, the March of Time points out that more valuable to their alma mater this year than ever
are the crowd-drawing football heroes—the few well-publicized young representatives of thirteen colleges. Professor Owen states that as long as commercializing
of football is inevitable, the rewarding of players for their services ought to be an open matter and not an
under-cover affair. Yale University is having the home of Noah Webster razed because no one would furnish funds for its
upkeep.

Miss Helen Cumnock, who is attending Queens-Chicora College in Charlotte, also spent the weekend in Davidson. New York University has
a “new course in cosmetic hygiene.”
