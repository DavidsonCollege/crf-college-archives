**Eu. Society.**

The question for debate on last Saturday night was: “Resolved, That the R. O. T. C. should be permanently established
at Davidson.” Despite the fact that very little material could be secured on the subject, the debate in the Eu.
Society was full of interest and pep. The affirmative was upheld by Sprunt, Wilkenson, and H. White. They contended that
the R. O. T. C. should be continued to enable Davidson to maintain her status among the other schools of
the country; that the physical training would make it very beneficial to the students, and that it was the patriotic
duty of the students to support the R. O. T. C. as a permanent establishment. The negative was represented by
Bizer, McFadden, and C. B. Robson. These gentlemen showed the injury that such a measure would bring to the student
body and to the college. The last speaker argued that, from the standpoint of the nation, the R. O. T.
C. was not necessary as a means for national defense. The rebuttal was characterized by snap. Both the committee and
the house decided in favor of the negative.

J. C. Bailey gave a very interesting declamation on “Shall the statue of Lee stand in the Hall of Fame?”
On account of the lack of time, it was moved and passed that the other men on the program should
be given credit for their selection without performance, after which the society adjourned with a sigh of relief.

**Phi. Society.**

The meeting of the Phi. Society on Saturday, March 22, was interesting in that a subject of considerable interest locally
was discussed. The topic was, “Resolved, That the R. O. T. C. should be continued permanently at Davidson.” The arguments
advanced in favor of it were: (1) It would be a good thing for Davidson; (2) It would provide a
set of trained men for officers in time of war; (3) It would be an advantage to the students. On
the negative points brought forward were: (1) It is a waste of time; (2) Davidson is not the kind of
school for the R. O. T. C.; (3) It is a useless expense. The negative won.

T. H. Spence gave an oration on “It Pays to Advertise.” This was a speech of witty remarks and was
followed by one of the same character by R. D. Hall, on “My Four Years at Davidson.” The subject of
the extemporaneous debate was, “Resolved, That the daylight saving plan should be permanently adopted.” The affirmative won the decision.

A double-headed freight passed through Davidson on Friday.

**DR. LINGLE LECTURING THROUGHOUT STATE**

**TOWN NEWS**

The indictment of the Kaiser is the desire of Polity men. Atlanta Conference of Peace League also discussed.

First Lieut. J. M. Rumple has arrived from overseas and is spending a brief leave of absence with his mother,
Mrs. W. J. Martin.

Mr. R. W. Miles preached at Spray last Sunday.

Dr. E. W. Curry, of Salisbury, N.C., is visiting his mother, Mrs. Curry. Dr. Curry has spent the month of
October, 1918, on lecture trips in the American army camps toward the Swiss border, lecturing on European themes. Afterwards, he
was with the French army again in the Vosges for about a month and a half. Dr. Lingle spent the
last few months lecturing throughout the state.

The parents of W. G. Humphrey spent a day of last week with him.

The father of L. B. Schenck spent Sunday on the Hill.Technicalities of the law; before sailing, on lecture trips in
the laws that he cannot be convicted of breaking any civil law. Of course, he is protected from any legal
punishment at present by the armistice. But even when peace is declared, he can be indicted only for international crimes
by a court of international law, similar to that by which Napoleon was tried. Dr. Currie explained three methods of
procedure by which he can be convicted by such a court. If he is capable of further crimes against humanity,
let us hope the controversy over the details of the League of Nations will soon give place to more imminent
affairs.

Pursuing this subject of international justice, Mr. Askew gave a report of the conference in Atlanta. His synopsis of the
best speeches on the league to enforce peace was very interesting and instructive.

JUNIORS AND SENIORS CLEAR FOR ACTION

The preliminaries of the Junior-Senior Debate have been set for April 19. It is to be hoped that both societies
will show lots of pep and furnish a large number of debaters to pick the team from. The subject has
not been decided upon yet, but it will be announced next week. The Philanthropic Society won both debates last year,
but the Eumeneans do not intend to let them win this year. The campus awaits with interest the occasion of
both debates.

INTERESTING BOOKS ADDED TO LIBRARY

The Library is fortunate in receiving several interesting books this week. Mrs. Laura Morrison Brown, daughter of Dr. R. H.
Morrison, the first President of Davidson College, has compiled a short “Historical Sketch of the Morrison Family,” and has kindly
presented a copy to the Library. Eight pages are devoted to the life of President Morrison. Some interesting facts are
treated briefly in her “sketch.”

A pamphlet “Military Hygiene,” received this week is doubly interesting from the fact that it was prepared by Maj. James
S. Simmons, '11, and 1st Lieut. William C. von Glahn, '11. Dr. von Glahn is a member of the faculty
of Johns Hopkins University, but at present he is at Fort Sam Houston, Texas. Dr. Simmons was located in Philadelphia
before entering the service in which he has been rapidly promoted.

The library also received this week several good works in American literature. Among them are: “History of American Literature,” Halleck;
“American Prose,” Bronson; several poems by Ticknor and Fields; “Early American Writers,” Cairns; “Chief American Poets,” by Page.

GILBERT & McARN REPRESENTATIVES No. 13 CHAMBERS

At a meeting of Sigma Upsilon last Wednesday night, an interesting discussion of the works of Hawthorne was led by
Dwight Chalmers. E. Flynn had prepared a paper on the life of Hawthorne. E. A. Woods read an original short
story which was especially good and reminded all present of Poe's thrillers. Plans were made for special work to be
carried out this spring. Last, but by no means least, were the refreshments.

“How would you like to sign up with me for a life game?” was the way a baseball fan proposed.
“I'm agreeable,” replied the girl, “Where's your diamond?”
