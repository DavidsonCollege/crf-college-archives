**Former Secretary of Defense visits Davidson**

By RICHARD VINSON
Editor in Chief

Former Secretary of Defense William Cohen filled this year’s Wearn Lecture with observations from his vast experience in international politics. The nation’s twentieth defense secretary delivered his speech, entitled “The Perils and Promise of a New World,” before a packed Love Auditorium. Following the lecture, Cohen answered several questions from the audience.

A former Republican senator from Maine, Cohen joined the Clinton cabinet in 1997. Cohen attended a press conference with Davidson students before his lecture on Saturday. His position in the Democratic administration reflected both his reputation as a moderate Republican and his expertise in defense and foreign affairs.

Cohen characterized the current political climate as an “era of great change.” He highlighted this dynamic present by first addressing the turbulent past. Cohen contrasted the views of two renowned scholars and commentators of contemporary international politics, Francis Fukuyama and Samuel Huntington. After the fall of European communism more than a decade ago, these authors took divergent views of the future. Fukuyama held that liberal democracy represented the final stage of political development and would subsequently sweep across the globe. By contrast, Huntington felt that the many fault lines of culture and religion would plunge the world into increased instability and conflict.

According to Cohen, history has proven both men right. The past decade has witnessed both a spread of democratic ideals and an increase of political fragmentation, of religious ferment, and of inter-ethnic and cultural violence. As a result, the United States must conduct an “ongoing examination” of its role in and its relationship to the changing global community. Whatever course the new administration chooses, Cohen stated that the United States will continue to depend both on effective diplomacy and on a strong military to achieve its goals.

Both in his lecture and in a pre-speech press conference, Cohen elaborated his views on what constitutes an appropriate use of these tools of foreign policy. In particular, he addressed US policy regarding Russia, China, and weapons of mass destruction. As Cohen remarked, “Russia is an important country with many resources.” Far from being a minor player in international politics, the former Soviet superpower is “going through a difficult transition.” As a result, the US must “help them become integrated into the international community.” Part of this task involves securing or eliminating Russia’s nuclear arsenal. Cohen noted that the sale or smuggling of weapons to countries such as Iran continues to be a problem. The US must also strive to convince Russia of the benefits of a limited national missile defense system for international peace and stability.

China also looms large on the political horizon. In his interview, Cohen commented,

**SAE celebrates loyal staff member**

There was a buzz of excitement at Sigma Alpha Epsilon on an otherwise lazy afternoon this Friday. “Is she here?” someone asked, to which someone else answered, “Not yet, but apparently they’ve seen her.” Then, “She’s here, I think.” The assembled members of SAE and a band of well-wishers were eagerly awaiting Lula Bell Houston, a very special lady who happens to work in DC’s laundry. Houston (Ms. Lu, to you) entered to a standing ovation and a bouquet of flowers.SAE members honored Houston not only because she has worked for DC but because “she’s just such a special human being.” Houston began working for Davidson in 1943, and has been going strong ever since. She only took a few years off for short stints living in Washington, D.C. and New York and for raising her children, but she is well past her 40th year. Ask her about quitting, though, and she will tell you that she’s “got a few more years left in [her].”

Matthew Arbuckle ‘02, who suggested giving the award to Houston, recalled his first memory of Houston. He introduced himself as a freshman, and has been receiving hugs and affection ever since. Arbuckle, in fact, is the third generation of Arbuckles “to love Lula Bell.” Houston previously worked with his mother, Margaret Arbuckle, and his grandparents. Mrs. Arbuckle was present at the ceremony and recalls her time working with Houston at Davidson fondly. “She’s just such a special lady.”

Arbuckle lamented the fact that few at Davidson take the time to think about and thank those who work in the physical plant, but calls it “the machine that makes Davidson work.” He says that Houston “embodies what the spirit of Davidson is, and what we think it should be.”

Mark Caldwell ‘02, also spoke at the ceremony, and recalls the time when he first met Houston. “Looks like you guys are busy,” he told Houston. In return he got “Yes, but I love it,” and a big smile. He also spoke about Houston’s “beautiful” singing in the choir at DCPC, and says that “DC is in debt for a see Houston, page 6

enemy either.” Bobby Pittenger KA sponsored their annual KArnival on April 21. KArnival, and the Brother-Pledge Auction on Friday night, raised more than $6,000 for the Muscular Dystrophy Association.

“It’s one thing to say that China is not a strategic partner — but they’re not a strategic The recent incident involving the collision of a US surveillance craft and a Chinese fighter plane demonstrates this somewhat strained relationship. Cohen was clear that “[the US military] has a right and a responsibility to conduct surveillance” in international airspace. Nevertheless, he asserted, “Our militaries must continue to be in contact.” Cohen pointed to some progress on this front, particularly in the case of Taiwan. He recalled that the mainland nation had been accustomed to setting deadlines for reunification, after which they had threatened to use force. As a result of continued engagement, the Chinese leadership has changed its rhetoric. see Cohen, page 6
