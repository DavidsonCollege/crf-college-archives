Publicize issues of personal safety
Leigh Hall and Mibs Raney

To the Davidson student body:

Two weeks ago, a Davidson student, a young woman, was running alone after dark on the road to Cornelius. She was followed and assaulted by a man. She was fortunate to be aided by a Davidson staff member who happened to be driving by. Although verbally and physically threatened, she was not injured.

Several points concern us about this incident. First of all, it brings up questions of students’ safety in and around Davidson. Secondly, this is one of a number of safety-related occurrences which have been communicated to the college community primarily by rumor and have not been acknowledged in an official manner by the College. Stories circulate, but why should we trust them? They’re only word of mouth.

This inattention or avoidance of personal safety issues is pervasive among students and college officials. To elaborate: As freshmen, we were indoctrinated in the joyful fringe benefits of the Honor Code: leave your doors unlocked! leave your books anywhere you want! this is a safe place. Even now, we hear the occasional student leading campus tours, repeating this litany of wishful thinking. It is difficult to resist tooting our own horn; compared to many schools, Davidson enjoys an unusually high trust level. This is something to be proud of. However, we rest too comfortably with this idea. We are reluctant to recognize that there are potentially dangerous situations around us. It is essential that we recognize them openly.

It is understandable that victims of crime are reluctant to discuss their losses; their privacy should be respected. Furthermore, it is not their responsibility to keep us informed. The expected sources of information, the Campus Police, the Dean of Students Office, and the Davidsonian, do keep us informed about vandalism and theft, but they do not circulate reports of personal assault. How often do violent acts go unreported? Why are they not given attention? If we remain ignorant of these actions that are taking place, we will assume that we’re safe. We will walk and jog alone at night. We will leave our doors unlocked. We will assume that all court parties are safe for young women. Our decisions about risky behavior are based on what we know and how safe we believe we are.

Information which helps us gauge the climate of safety at Davidson must not be withheld. Access to this information is crucial for every student’s decisions about safety. We propose that pertinent information from police reports, currently submitted only to the Dean of Students Office, be published in the Davidsonian or in the weekly announcements. We believe that this communication will go a long way in dispelling anxiety-producing rumors and will enable the college community to make more informed decisions about their personal safety.
