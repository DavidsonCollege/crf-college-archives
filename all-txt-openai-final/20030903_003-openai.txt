**Sweet success for winners of 73rd Annual Cake Race**

**College tradition continues, even as temperatures rise; winners McNatt and Rhodes first to choose cakes**

Like the freshmen that came before them, members of the Class of 2007 braved the sweltering heat on Wednesday to
take part in one of Davidson’s most time-honored traditions, the Freshman Cake Race. Though the College has evolved and grown
since the first race in 1930, much about the tradition remains the same: freshmen run the 1.7-mile course for the
glory of victory and the sweet taste of cake.

The idea for the Cake Race came from cross country coach Pete Whittle ’30, who used the race and the
cake incentive to find the most talented freshman runners for his team. Many of Davidson’s greatest runners first discovered their
running abilities in the Cake Race, including Assistant Athletic Director Sterling Martin ’63, who won the race in 1959.

About 75 men and a Wildcat—later revealed to be President Bobby Vagt—lined up first on the Smith football field to
take on a course passing by Chambers, Main Street, Tomlinson Dormitory, the Knobloch Campus Center, and ending up back in
Richardson Stadium for a finish on the track. Though the course has undergone several changes over the years, the 1.7-mile
distance has remained the same.

In the women’s race, Marisa McNatt ’07 of St. Leonard, Md., crossed the finish line first in 11 minutes, 14
seconds. She had the honor of choosing first from the nearly 100 cakes provided by faculty and members of the
community. McNatt decided on a large flower cake covered in M&Ms, saying, “It was the biggest and the prettiest. You
can tell it took a lot of work.” Brittany Hill ’07 finished second in the women’s event, with Caitlin Ranson
’07, Laura Pepper ’07, and Eli Trefzger ’07 close behind. About 50 women competed in the race.

Matt Rhodes ’07 of Little Rock, AR took home a first-place finish in the men’s race with a time of
9 minutes 13 seconds. He was followed closely by Doug Noreen ’07, John Doehring ’07, Alex Varner ’07, and Andrew
Hazen ’07. “I ran with one goal in mind—the huge sunflower cake, but first place still wasn’t good enough,” said
Rhodes, who chose a cake shaped like a bunny.

The legacy can be traced back to the Nov. 13, 1930, Davidsonian which hoped that the first Cake Race “will
set a precedent for future classes, and that in the future it will become an annual and looked forward to
event in the yearly routine of Freshman classes.”

**Book gets students talking about ‘idea of identity’**

On the Saturday of Orientation, the class of 2007 discussed their assigned summer reading, Ron Suskind’s A Hope in the
Unseen. The book details the struggle of irrepressible Cedric Jennings’ journey.

Freshmen compared the trials encountered in Ron Suskind’s A Hope in the Unseen with those they will face in the
next four years. Dr. David Staton (above) of the Counseling Center led one discussion.from the crime-ridden streets of Washington, D.C.
to the halls of Brown University. The reading prompted freshmen to seriously consider controversial issues like affirmative action and how
it applies to life on a college campus. Through Cedric, freshmen were also able to see some of the trials
and tribulations that they will overcome in their own years at Davidson, like making new friends and living with a
roommate.

“An objective of this book discussion is to demonstrate our conviction that the primary and collective purpose of Davidson College
is to engage students in a learning enterprise,” said Dean of Faculty Clark Ross in his address to the freshman
class before the discussions. “In this process, we discuss ideas; we reevaluate our own beliefs, in light of newly gained
knowledge; and we recognize the legitimate and welcome diversity of opinions that informed and sensitive people hold.”

Many books were considered for the summer reading. After much deliberation, Suskind’s *A Hope in the Unseen* was chosen. “What
I really liked about the book was the idea of identity and how everyone’s individual identity is so subjective,” said
Adam Martin ’06, an Orientation Team Leader and the student who brought the novel to Associate Dean of Students Kathy
Bray-Merrell’s attention last semester. “Awareness of how being a part of a group can make an impact—both good and bad—on
your life is something I feel is important for freshmen to acquire, and this book provided just that.”

Freshmen reactions ranged. “I think it was a great introduction to analyzing literature here at Davidson,” said Liz Dallam ’07.
Others were pleased to have a lively discussion with their peers. “The book got us thinking about college issues before
we got here, and the discussion that took place was good because the issues were controversial enough to keep the
discussion animated,” said Steve Gaultney ’07.
