10 Men turn back in right direction. By Bro Kritt Sports Writer

Cullowhee, North Carolina—After Saturday’s disappointing home loss to College of Charleston, a letdown loomed in Cullowhee for Davidson as they went head-to-head with Western Carolina on Monday night. Fortunately for the Wildcats, the Catamounts have been this year’s Southern Conference punching bag—they entered the game with a conference-worst record of 6-14, 2-8. And if Coach Bob McKillop’s squad needed any more good news, Western Carolina also lacked the services of starting point guard Casey Rodgers due to a broken nose. Rodgers, a candidate for conference freshman of the year, is second on his team in scoring and third in the league in assists per game.

Davidson never trailed in their effective 73-55 victory as four players scored in double figures. Chadd Holmes and Landry Kosmalski led the team with 13 points apiece. Holmes played an ideal game for a big man. He shot 6-7 from the field, pulled four rebounds, dished out three assists without any turnovers, swatted two Catamount shots into the seats, and forced a steal. “Chadd Holmes played his best game since his sophomore year,” commended Coach Bob McKillop. “He was superb.” Ali Ton and Jeff Bergman pitched in 12 points apiece.

More importantly, Bergman returned to full force from his dislocated elbow as he played 27 minutes off the bench. His elbow never appeared to cause any discomfort while he knocked down 3 buckets from behind the arc. Monday’s game was Bergman’s eighth straight with a three-point basket. Kosmalski continued his hot streak from the charity stripe in recent games, hitting five of his six attempts. “He’s again showing his tremendous courage and work ethic,” said McKillop. Over the previous three games, he has hit 16 of 18 free throws, pushing his percentage to a more stable 56 percent.

The repressive front court defense of Holmes, Kosmalski, and Stephen Marshall held the Catamount big men to 6-26 shooting from the floor. At times, the defense was so tough the Catamounts had trouble finding the rim. Despite shooting 53 percent in the second half, the Wildcats were still outscored 37-31, continuing a disheartening trend in conference play. “(The coaches) pay attention to statistics for analysis a lot,” McKillop said. “And in the second half we are being outscored by a total of five or six points in conference play.” Playing with a lead continues to be difficult for the Wildcats this year.

Bacon, Ferrell lead Men’s track at Clemson, VMI By KEITH GORDON Sports Writer

Despite a slew of nagging injuries and sicknesses that have hampered their training, the men’s track team enjoyed many solid performances this past weekend. The distance crew traveled to the Tiger Classic at Clemson University,while the sprint corps went north to the VMI Winter Relays. Both meets provided the men with opportune chances to still add a great finish to this injury-stricken indoor season. “This weekend we saw some good races from a few guys under the weather, and this means we can do even better at the conference meet,” said coach Gary Andrew. “With another great week of training, combined with rest, the guys should have a good end to the indoor season.” The Southern Conference Indoor Championships are scheduled for the weekend of February 19-20 at VMI.

Leading the distance runners was senior Davey Bacon, who destroyed his mark from earlier in the season, running the 800m in 1:58.80. Taking off at the gun, Bacon never looked back en route to winning the heat and placing himself among the top ten Wildcat runners all-time in the indoor 800m. Also competing in the 800m were Thomas McElveen (2:03.47) and Keith Gordon (2:04.44). The previous night at the Tiger Classic, standout Brent Ferrell also paced his heat in the 3000m, faltering only at the end, despite running a personal record of 8:48.27. His time was the second fastest all-time at Davidson, and Ferrell looks to better that mark at the conference meet. Freshman sensation Dan Gibson also ran extremely well, running a top ten time of 9:01.09. William Isenhour finished with a 9:32.82 to round out the 3000m Wildcat competitors.

Other notable performances came from freshman Jay Jahnes in the 500m (1:10.2) and sophomore Keith Chapman in the mile (4:33.30). Jahnes’ time was another top ten performance for the men. Jahnes and Chapman ought to couple well with Bacon and Gibson for a potentially record-breaking 4x800m relay team as the season progresses. Pat Burchett and Paul Irwin ran 4:41.29 and 4:48.16, respectively, in the mile, while senior Jonathan Fly finished his 500m with a time of 1:15.44.

The sprinters also provided quality performances at VMI. Michael Albert turned in a time of :06.91 in the 55m, as well as a :53.9 400m to pace the men. Also competing in the 400m were freshman Grant Bleecher (:54.0) and junior John Moore (:56.0). Co-Captain Stan Baker turned in the Davidson performance of the day in the 200m, with a :25.1. Albert, Bleecher, Moore, and Baker also teamed up to turn in a 3:42.1 time in the 4x400m relay, proving their mettle in what was noted to be one of the most physical races seen in recent meets. One distance runner, David Vaughn, did accompany the men to VMI. He ran the 800m, finishing in a time of 2:11.5.

With this continued improvement, despite the coughs and aches, the men’s track team appears ready to end the 1999 indoor season with a bang, while looking ahead to the outdoor season with renewed vigor and enthusiasm.
