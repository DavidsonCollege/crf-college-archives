have entered for the preliminaries. Those entering from the Eumenean Society are: C. J. Mathews, E. A. Woods, J. B.
Woods, J. R. Woods, W. C. Frierson, W. G. Humphrey, R. W. Cousar, A. S. Potts, G. C. Bellingrath, L.

Y. M. C. A. MEETING

On last Thursday night Dr. A. A. McGeachy, of Charlotte, addressed the Association. His subject was “The Double Standard.” Holding
the interest of his audience from the very start, the speaker pointed out very clearly that as regards the social
evil, man and woman were both on the same plane, and that what was expected of one should be demanded
of the other. This lecture has been delivered all over the South with much success, but at no place with
greater appreciation than at Davidson. The attendance was by far the best in quite a while.

CAMPUSISMS

Owing to a mistake, the “rep” previously awarded to “Jack” Paisley at Junior Speaking will be transferred to someone else.
Paisley is not a member of a literary society.

The DAVIDSONIAN, March 8, 1916

PROSPECTS FOR VARSITY (Continued from page 1)

season’s slugging fame, who claims he is an outfielder and is trying to prove it. It is likely that Hengeveld’s
hitting will cause him to get a position, if he is not needed too badly for the twirling staff, but
he will have to hustle to beat Steve, Bennie, and Sam out of their jobs.

The pitching staff promises to be unusually strong. Lawson, last year’s premier twirler, is going in old-time form, and will
probably be the mainstay of the staff. Besides, there is Hengeveld, of last year’s Varsity, to call upon in a
pinch. The new faces on the mound are John Currie, brother of the famous Murphy Currie, of old-time Davidson days;
Harry Shaw, the elongated southpaw, and Monty Monteith, of Huntersville. Currie and Shaw seem to have stuff aplenty, but control
is their short point. However, they are rapidly improving in this respect, and should be contenders for positions. Monteith has
aWorld of smoke, and with training should make a good pitcher. Last, but not least, Davidson has Bill Fetzer and
DeWitt Kluttz as coaches, two men who know the business and have proven their worth. In them Davidson places her
confidence in predicting a winning team, for that is the only kind these two produce.

PAST SEASON IN BASKETBALL
(Continued from page V)

tionally fast, but he quickly disproved this, bobbing up in all parts of the fray, always on top of the
ball, and continually breaking up threatening rushes of the foe. He was a powerful man on scoring points from a
mix-up directly under the goal, and many a basket oozed through directed by Dutch’s fingers when it seemed hopelessly lost
in a jumble of arms and legs. All these men will be back next year and should make a combination
that will make Davidson a powerful opponent of anything in the State. Only one team, North Carolina, was successful in
wresting a complete series from the Red and Black, all other college opponents being at least tied. Elon, A. &
M., and Trinity split even with Davidson, while Guilford proved double losers to the Presbyterian five. Statesville dropped three games
to the locals, and Charlotte Y. M. C. A. split even. Besides the Varsity, this season has served to develop
some likely looking scrub material for future Varsities. Among the men who have been working faithfully, helping whip the regulars
into shape, and battling valiantly night after night that the Varsity might reach better efficiency, are Nimocks, Ben White, Williamson,
McAlister, Carson, and Murray. Davidson is going to see some of these men on the Varsity in future days, and
from present indications, they will be able successors of the present Varsity.
