#### RLO Survey Points to Bests, Worsts

**College Ranked No. 3 of 217 in ‘Overall Resident Satisfaction’**

By Mallory MacDonald, Staff Writer

In the 2003 RLO survey, Davidson was judged against 217 other schools across the United States. Out of the 217 schools, Davidson ranked third in overall resident satisfaction and second in safety and security. The survey also showed some of Davidson’s faults, most notably the dining services offered at Davidson. Davidson ranked fifteenth in dining services.

Director of Residence Life Leslie Marsicano said, “The best thing about this survey is that it lets us know what needs to change as well as what is going well.”

In a different category, Davidson was ranked against twelve other institutions. It ranked second in dining services, first in overall residence satisfaction, and first in security and safety. Out of 13 schools, Davidson ranked 10th in room assignment or change process. Dean Marsicano believes that this high number has everything to do with the complicated issues of last year’s room assignments. The survey reflected the feelings of frustration and anger felt from the many “homeless” students last semester.

Brad Poole ’06 said that he “hopes more juniors will get permission to live off campus and there will not be such an overflow into the residence halls up the hill.”

The survey also showed that Davidson is not very strong in providing residence hall services, despite being extremely strong in terms of resident adviser and roommate choices. A major complaint of the student body was the cable TV services available in all residence halls. With lack of lounges and limited access to cable, this issue has quickly become a volatile subject. Dean Marsicano and RLO recognize this problem. She feels that it is important for students to both fill out the surveys and see the results “so that they know we are consciously listening and understanding the thoughts of the Davidson community.”

#### Wearn, from page 1

Esquire named Zakaria “one of the 21 most important people of the 21st century” in November 1999, and such prominent political figures as Henry Kissinger have suggested that he might one day serve as U.S. National Security Adviser or Secretary of State. Although only 39, Zakaria has already succeeded in establishing a reputation as a controversial writer. Alexander noted that he is well-respected in spite of his sometimes contentious statements because “he’s willing to be critical of the left and the right, Democrats and Republicans.”

The Wearn Lecture is an annual event conducted by the Public Lectures Committee. Previous lecturers include former president of Ireland, Mary Robinson, and former Secretary of Defense, William S. Cohen. While the Dean Rusk Program contacted and communicated with Zakaria’s agent, the Public Lectures Committee will finance the majority of the expenses. “I, personally, and our program are deeply indebted to the Public Lectures Committee for their willingness to make this happen,” said Alexander.

Zakaria’s appearance coincides with the Bank of America Conference, a series of lectures and discussions conducted by experts in international and economic issues that is held at Davidson every other year. This year’s four-day conference will address the nature of sovereignty and national security in an increasingly globalized world. Zakaria will speak on global threats to U.S. foreign policy in his lecture.

While planning the conference, Alexander asked students to suggest potential speakers and discovered that Zakaria was a popular choice. “When I talked with students and faculty members over the course of the spring, Fareed Zakaria’s name was at the top of almost every list,” he said. Matt Bandyk ’06 added, “As much as I disagree with him [Zakaria] on some stuff, the fact that they can get a guy of his caliber and stature is a pretty good thing.”entered the national spotlight after 9/11 when he wrote an article entitled “Why They Hate Us,” an attempt to provide some explanation for the terrorist attacks. He claimed that although Arabs embraced Western values, they had been unable to construct the political institutions that are essential to democracy. Alexander summed up Zakaria’s international influence, saying, “This guy’s a player. He is a guy whose opinion people in Washington care about.”

Retreat highlights SGA goals
By Blair McGraw

The Student Government Association held their mandatory leadership retreat last Sunday evening at the Irwin Lodge. The purpose of the gathering was to discuss goals and the things that the SGA hopes to accomplish during the year. During the retreat, the SGA set several goals that it aims to fulfill this year. The primary goal was to improve communication with the student body. With the recent confusion regarding faculty and trustee committee appointments, the SGA hopes to strengthen ties with faculty and staff. SGA President Charles Washington ’04 said, “We pinpointed communication with the administration as one area that we could work on.” Senators discussed creating a link on the web to the SGA through which students can leave messages for specific senators. Ideas of suggestion boxes as well as a student forum were also raised. The SGA hopes that these changes will facilitate communication between the student government and the students it represents.

The SGA wants to see changes made in the academic procedures of the college, especially the pass/fail system. Many senators felt the deadline was too early for students to make a decision about a class. Another goal was to examine RLO procedures, including the lack of cable and issues related to the housing lottery. Several students have voiced displeasure over some of RLO’s policies.

Discussion of smoke-free dorms was also reintroduced. This year, all dorms became smoke-free. SGA, having been approached with the issue last year, had no objections to making all the dorms smoke-free. But they are willing to revisit the issue if there is strong support for a smoking dorm. The other goals from the retreat were increasing school spirit, including teaching students the Alma Mater and Fight Song and improving ITS policies. Newly-appointed Senator Mac Skelton ’07 stressed that although these goals are important, the SGA will not be limited to them.

The retreat served to help new senators understand how the student government functions. Group building activities allowed the senators to become more familiar with each other. Also of concern to the SGA was the recent vandalism, as a resolution condemning the KKK vandals was passed at its meeting last Thursday. Calling the acts “repugnant” and “intolerable,” the SGA hopes to take a stand against such actions. The unanimous passage of the resolution led to discussion of a new committee. Francois Trappey ’06 introduced the idea of creating some type of unity mural on the same areas where the vandalism occurred. Still in its early stages, the committee was to include several senators. Unfortunately, Director of Physical Plant David Holthouser told Washington that, due to moisture retention issues, a mural isn’t feasible on the white wall near the laundry.
