#### Wake Drops Davidson

**Davidson Basketball Treads Treacherous Middle Ground**

By STEVE SOUD ’84

No one was really quite sure whether they had witnessed a court reenactment of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde or
some odd Dickens plot in which the best of fortunes suddenly soured into the worst of fortunes.

Such were the thoughts of Wildcat fans as they trudged the miles back to Davidson Tuesday night. Just three days
before, their beloved Wildcats had walloped an outclassed Erskine team 80-58. With burgeoning hopes for an upset, they had traversed
the miles to the Coliseum, only to watch Wake Forest’s Demon Deacons dismantle the unsure Wildcats 81-62. Surely this was
not the same team that stomped out hard vengeance Saturday night?!

The Wake Forest game was billed as the big chance to turn the program around. A win against Wake would
draw regional attention at the very least, and bolster team as well as fan confidence and morale. Even if the
spectators didn’t view the game as a turning point for the long-floundering Davidson basketball program, the coaches and players were
all too aware of the game’s importance. From their standpoint at the very least, the game was pivotal.

After the game, disappointment and depression pervaded the locker room.

“It was an opportunity we let get away from us,” Brian Rowan said. “A lot of the mistakes were unforced
errors. They were self-inflicted errors. We didn’t execute. When we don’t score, we can’t put in our press to keep
them from running the break.

“It’s not so much the loss that depresses us,” he continued. “It’s how we lost it. It was ripe for
us to win.”

That’s all true, but let’s not so soon forget what lessons were learned.

Against Wake, the inside was the big hole. That’s the same spot Jamie Hall filled so well for so long
and the team has not yet recovered from that loss. None of the freshmen are quite ready to play there
consistently, although Bill Pollock has at last begun to flex his muscles and throw his weight around inside.

Perhaps most importantly, these last two games have given the freshmen a chance to play against college competition. Pepper Bego
turned the ball over three fewer times against Wake than he did against Erskine with comparable playing time. He’s got
all the moves necessary to play college ball, and if we can tolerate a few freshman mistakes here and there,
that pull-up jumper will start falling soon. Rafael Hernandez’s talent is just bursting at the seams, and he’s liable to
explode at any time. Gerry Born continues to play well and will see more playing time. They’re all coming around.

Contrary to popular belief, Wake Forest was not the end of the season. It was not even the beginning of
the end. But perhaps it was the end of the beginning. Within the next month, there are only two games
that matter. The first is Thursday night in Charlotte against Furman. The second is next Saturday at the Citadel. Those
are the Southern Conference games—the only ones that matter. If the ’Cats have a 3-23 season, all they have to
do is win three more games and they’re in the NCAA tournament. These games are just tune-ups for the real
season. If we should take a horrible beating from these non-conference giants (and so far we have), what does it
matter? Let’s take our lumps now, as long as we learn and improve enough so that we don’t take our
lumps when they count. This team is still very young. You see, Davidson basketball treads a desperate middle ground. It
has transcended the years of 8-19 seasons, but has not yet turned the corner beyond mediocre, .500 seasons. Turning that
corner is oh-so-close and yet tantalizingly just out of reach. The Wake game was a chance to turn the corner,
but it slipped by. The Duke game is now the chance to turn the program around, but if a Wildcat
win doesn’t materialize in Durham, there are games further down the road that serve the purpose. Winning the Worcester County
Classic or beating Notre Dame on ESPN could do it, but, lest we forget, the biggest win would be the
Southern Conference Tournament.

The time for despair has not yet come. Kenny Wilson is going to be virtually untouchable this season. He is
averaging 19 PPG, and if he can score 25 points against a good ACC team, what’s he going to do
in the Southern? The possibilities are infinite! At his present rate of improvement, he is a shoo-in for MVP. We
need only have patience.

The team will be the last ones to deny they played poorly Tuesday night. They’re just waiting to explode, to
play the way they know they can play. They would have rather played two more Erskines to prepare for Wake,
but they must now move on. Tomorrow night is U-Mass, and a probable win. Perhaps it will be the final
step toward the big turnaround, but it doesn’t have to be. It may be just one more step in preparation
for the one final goal: a Southern Conference championship.

Let’s just compare where they are now to where they were last year, and use that as a measure of
where they will be come March. Even if it takes until March to make the big turn, I’ve got one
thing to say to player and fan alike: Hang in there; the time is nigh.

Cliff Tribus goes up.
