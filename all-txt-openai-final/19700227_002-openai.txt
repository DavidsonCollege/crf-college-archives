Hardly Fair

If you missed both “Face the Nation” last week and the “Charlotte Observer” editorial concerning it, you missed one of the most alarming opinions of recent years to be expressed by a public official. On the show, Senator John Stennis, D-Miss., was commenting on the recently concluded trial of the “Chicago Seven.” He said that he considered the trial a disgrace, and we can only agree. He also said the proceedings were an attack on the judicial system, and again we must agree with him. It was then that Senator Stennis made the incredible suggestion that perhaps the answer to such attacks on the system would be a constitutional amendment to eliminate the right of trial in certain cases.

We find it hard to believe that Senator Stennis was completely serious when he made the statement. The Chicago trial, if it has demonstrated anything, has shown that the right to a fair and open trial is already too abused in certain instances. But let us consider the phrase “fair trial.” Do we really have that right? In the real world, i.e., outside Davidson, chances still seem pretty good although the actions of Judge Julius Hoffman have raised doubts in many minds. In the world of Davidson, there are also doubts. The letter by Norman Cary and the joint letter by Peter Hobbie, Mark Meza, and Cary Tucker concerning the recent Honor Court decision prove that. We see the next move as up to the administration. Are the charges in the letters accurate? Or are the instances cited merely the results of some fantastic and entirely unimaginable coincidences? Can the students have faith that they will receive a fair deal at the hands of their own courts? Or are they within reason when they feel threatened by the very existence of those courts? The acquittal by the Court of Appeals is encouraging. However, students must not fail to realize that the real problems in the courts still remain.

A Changing Role

In the February 21 “Saturday Review” Henry Steele Commager has written an extensive article expressing his views on the subject, “Has the Small College a Future?” In it he examines the origins of the small college as well as their present condition, and one of the most vital conclusions he reaches concerns the college experience as a period of delaying in the development of the student. Commager explains that the college grew up in America because the people were not at first organized to produce universities on the European model. He states that the colleges originally served much younger men than they do today and therefore took on the functions of training the youths in character and Christian morality. The college’s role became one of prolonging youth. Commager describes the old college experience as four golden years in which the student could get learning, morality, manners, and perhaps a mate. But today this role of college has become a myth. Colleges are no longer for the elite but for everyone and their traditional roles are usurped at both ends of the college experience. From below, greater student maturity, improving secondary education, and the junior colleges infringe on the old college role of protection for the student allowing him to develop away from societal pressures. From above, graduate centers, business, and the military are pressing on the student to get out into the world sooner.

Commager therefore rightfully concludes that the colleges should get out of the business of extending youth. The role of training students for an introduction to life should be left to the elementary and high schools, the home, the church, and society. For the future, Commager has several recommendations. He would see the college speed up education, perhaps to three years. He sees abandoning the old college concern with governing student morality and providing a multitude of services to the students so that they never develop competence in providing these things for themselves. He also calls for more student involvement in the life of the college and the community. Finally, he deals with the geographically isolated and basically rural colleges. Colleges isolated from centers of culture should keep a “gulf stream” of intellectual activity going through the campus, he says. They should always keep before the young the “spectacle of greatness and dedication.”

How does Davidson stack up against these judgments? A reading of the statement of purpose in the catalogue shows too many of the aims of the college to be those Commager is regretting. The Davidson program too often fails to challenge the students with roles significantly correlated to possible roles in their post-graduate life. Psychologists recognize that such a lack of challenge can serve to maintain the student in the life patterns to which he is accustomed. In short, the student’s youth is unduly prolonged. As Davidson is now in its “decade of destiny” and especially this year considering its functions as never before, it is right that it should consider its broad impact on the development of the student. Perhaps the answer would be to be less concerned with doing things for the student and more concerned with doing things with him.

Of Missing Books

Each fall, the library takes a complete inventory of its material. Each fall, the library discovers that between 250 and 300 books are missing and unaccounted for. The disappearance of these books costs the library approximately 3000 dollars annually. Often, many of these missing books mysteriously reappear in various corners of the library as the school session progresses. This year, however, despite the publication of a complete list of missing materials, the library director reports that very few books have been recovered. There appear to be two possible explanations for the present situation, both of which are given some weight by the library staff. The first is that some of the missing materials have been taken by persons not affiliated in any way with Davidson College. The second is that the College-affiliated offenders are less repentant than is customary. It seems a strange perversion of the quest for knowledge that the very seekers themselves should prove guilty of denying their fellows access to material that would be helpful along the way. Surely academic responsibility must include the unselfish sharing of the College library resources. Anyone who has seen the inconveniences posed by a closed-stack library system realizes what a good system we enjoy here at open-stack Davidson. The library staff still feels that the institution of security measures, such as closed stacks or a book-check station, would be an affront to the character of the Davidson College community. In the light of this year’s statistics, we wonder how long they can be expected to continue to feel that way.

To the Editor:

I quote from the DAVIDSONIAN of February 13: “Sophomore slump,” according to Burney, can be traced to the break-up of the cohesive freshman hall as a result of dispersion to new living quarters and the effects of fraternity rush, both of which take place at the end of the freshman year. In other parts of the article on the new president and vice-president of the SGA, you list some of the dormitory reforms Mr. Burney proposes: continued dormitory renovation to improve the students’ environment, and dormitory discussions and programs to improve and maintain “interpersonal relationships.” The ideas implicit in these reforms are archetypes of the contemporary zeitgeist. They represent the worst in pseudosociology and quasipsychology. They are simply wrong.

To clarify, sophomore slump has absolutely nothing at all to do with the “break-up of the cohesive freshman hall.” Individual students aren't affected by their living quarters in such a simple way, and Davidson is small enough so that you see practically everyone you want to see anytime you want to see them. If true friendships are formed during the freshman year, they will remain intact throughout the four years at Davidson. Sophomore slump is simply a way you feel and the causes are not related in even a remote way to where the student is living or whom he’s living with.

The other piece of shoddy thinking and obfuscatory prose is “improving the living environment.” That means simply giving everyone luxurious surroundings in which to entertain themselves and their dates during 24-hour open houses. Dormitory renovation is not what Davidson needs. Watts was quite sufficient before it was renovated and I don't see how the renovation has helped stimulate the minds of its inhabitants. And after all, college is supposed to make people think, not give them comfortable places to put their butts. No “interpersonallogical gradient of carpetized domesticity” will help the college get along with its first function. The dormitories are quite sufficient as they are. They don't need renovation except in those cases where it will help maintenance. The funds for Mr. Burney's proposed renovations could be used in a much better way, and I hope he will direct his attentions and political energies to more important things.

Norris Cites Bad Sport; Crouse Makes Apology

To the Editor:

The Duke game is now history and nothing more needs to be explained. Despite Otis and the emotion of the game, one of our cheerleaders (representatives of “true school spirit”) saw fit to toss a megaphone at the Duke cheerleaders at the opposite end of the court near the end of the game. Luckily he missed, but his action is still inexcusable.

Al Norris, ‘72
Davidson College

To the Editor:

This is a letter to students, faculty, administration, alumni, and friends of Davidson College. I would publicly like to apologize for the megaphone-throwing incident which occurred during the Duke game at the Coliseum. Perhaps I can offer a reason why it happened; I do not intend my statement to be accepted as an excuse because I do not personally feel my actions are justifiable.

The Duke cheerleader had agreed not to use the microphone in the Coliseum anymore. I had asked him if he would let me use the one at Duke; after a negative reply, we shook hands while I congratulated him on a fine game. Then he used it one last time. I am fully aware of the fact that his use of the microphone was no big deal, but at the moment, due also to the apparent outcome of the game at that point, I lost my head. Thus, this apology.

I would like to close by saying that such actions will not happen in the future. The team, the coaches, the school, and all concerned with Davidson College deserve better conduct from its cheerleaders than that which I demonstrated.

Church Schools May Lose Grants

A lawsuit contesting federal grants to church-related colleges has reached the final stages in court, and a ruling is expected soon. The decision on this case could set a precedent which would affect church colleges across the nation. The clause of the First Amendment forbidding laws “respecting an establishment of religion” has been a common point of contention in the Supreme Court in the past 25 years. The court has yet to rule on a case which involves the direct allocation of federal funds to sectarian schools.

The suit was filed in Hartford against the state of Connecticut, the U.S. government, and four Catholic colleges. The 15 citizens who initiated this action hope ultimately to bring a decision by the Supreme Court on the constitutionality of giving any federal funds to sectarian colleges and universities. Leo Pfeffer, chief counsel for the plaintiff, stated the intent of the lawsuit to a federal panel in his closing remarks. “We seek a national declaration of judgment and a nationwide injunction.” Edward Bennett Williams, attorney for the defendant colleges, stressed the far-reaching implications of ruling federal funds to sectarian colleges unconstitutional. Citing from a long list of federal financing now existing in numerous church-related colleges, Mr. Williams predicted “sweeping consequences” if the suit was upheld.

The question of giving funds to church colleges first arose in the mid-1960s with the passage of the Higher Education Facilities Act. Distinctions between sectarian and non-sectarian schools were vague, but it was stipulated that none of the grants were to finance buildings used “for sectarian instruction or as a place for religious worship.” The funds around which this controversy centers amounts to $1.5 million, and they are to be used by four Catholic colleges for the erection of various buildings on campus. The schools in question are Fairfield and Sacred Heart Universities, and Albertus Magnus and Amherst Colleges. Interest in the case has been widespread, and the federal district courtroom has been packed during its sessions. The verbal battle between Mr. Williams, a defense attorney, and Mr. Pfeffer, chief counsel for the American Jewish Congress, has heightened the appeal of the case.

But The Malady Lingers On

According to Warner Brothers’ blurb on a new album cover, Frank Zappa dissolved the Mothers of Invention “sneering bitterly about the inability of youngsters to recognize good rock music even when it comes up and bites them on the ass.” He may be right, but his work on ‘Zapped’ is hardly that dramatic.

Poor ole Frank’s outrage is understandable in the light of his group’s rejection by the teeny-boppers of America who didn’t buy enough records to support him in style; but was he making music for music or music for money? If the latter were his objective, Frank should have done his homework. He should have studied the market and come up with a product slightly more salable.

Certainly Frank should not have adopted the pelvic gyrations once performed by Elvis and now adapted to tuxedoed Tom Jones. The openings for stud figures are very limited and someone named Zappa just couldn’t fit the image. Several other styles were just not for Frank. Some like the Beatles and Ray Charles are inimitable. Others like Aretha Franklin and Barbara Streisand require a femininity which Frank lacks; unfortunately there is only one Tiny Tim. The soul market was dominated by blacks, the country market was dominated by hicks, and Frank was neither.

Still, there were several opportunities Frank might have investigated. Situation songs could have been exploited by Frank. The number of variations on the basic forms staggers the imagination and could have staggered hapless Frank’s portfolio. One starting point for the situation song is a concept basic to American mythology — The Girl God Made For Me.

Frank missed out on a cute extension of the GGMFM form by not getting in on the Girl God Made For Me Who Died trend started by “Honey” (with touching foreshadowing in heartrending ditties like “Last Kiss”). Tough luck, Frank.

Another virtual gold mine Frank missed was the Girl God Made For Me Whom I Left for Unknown Reasons (cf. “By the Time I Get to Phoenix”) variation, not to mention the Girl God Made For Me Who Left Me for Unknown Reasons.

Folk and its derivatives offer Zappa another road to riches, but this road is a tricky one to travel. In addition to singing certain selected standards, one must produce “original” works spiced with appropriate alliterations and melancholy terms, mixed with obscurity enough to make the naive call it poetry or even philosophy. Simon and Garfunkel are masters of the technique.

S&G fans, withhold your attacks, and consider: if they really believed the songs they sing, why do they act as they do? Are they singing songs for songs or songs for money?

Finally, Frank could have implemented his psychedelic choice differently. He could have made his cacophony recognizably different from everyone else’s. The song is ended, but the malady lingers on.
