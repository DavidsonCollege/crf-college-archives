Davidson Indoors: Introverted,
Weird Misfits Find Their Niche

After years of gym class hu-
miliation, high ropes tremors and
orienteering ineptitude, Davidson’s
clumsy introverts finally have a
group of their own.

Founded by juniors Ezekial
Cornwall and Melanie Chiglinski,
Davidson Indoors provides a safe,
fun environment for students with
no interest in building fires, fording
rivers or perspiring whatsoever.

The group, which meets Sat-
urday nights at nine, focuses on a
variety of activities, ranging from
reading the Aragon trilogy to knit-
ting God’s Eyes.

In addition to impromptu hang-
ing out, Davidson Indoors has
planned several trips. On October
3rd there is a Beginning Zelda
course in Akers 211. An interme-
diate LARPing (Live Action Role
Playing) tutorial is scheduled for
November 12th in the Union 900
Room.

Anyone wishing to be a David-
son Indoors trip leader must become
certified by achieving Warlock Sta-
tus in Dungeons and Dragons and
watching the entire third season of
Dragonball Z.

According to Chiglinski, the
group provides a niche for many
would-be recluses. “Sure we might
not be able to throw a spiral, ride a
horse, or breathe pollinated air, but
we have a lot of unique skills,” he
said. “No one knows Smash Broth-
ers like we do.”

In fact, many members of Da-
vidson Indoors say that they like
the idea of taking a hike. “In third
grade I read Walden, and I’ve
wanted to conduct a similar experi-
ment ever since,” said Cornwall.
Asthma and Osgood-Schlatter’s
may have kept him away from the
woods, but the notion of hiking re-
mains as alluring as ever. During
his summer internship with Nin-
tendo, he drew up plans for a Wii
Hiking game scheduled for release
in November 2009.

Davidson’s “Indoor Kids” learn that they are not alone in their misery.

The group does not consider it-
self a rival in any way to Davidson
Outdoors, and hopes that the more
outdoorsy folks are not threatened
by DI’s quest for total domination
of the Vail Commons Dark Side.

“It’s a total misconception that
we hate D.O. And I don’t know
who started the rumor that we
recalibrated their gyrocompasses.
That’s just not true.”

A recent report from PsychDai-
ly indicated that both achievements
are recognized so that someone,
anyone, feels good about a victory
that is most likely compensating
for an unrelated, much more seri-
ous void in one’s life.

Head Nod
Not Mutual

A recent head nod was reject-
ed outside the Union this week.
Eyewitnesses reported seeing a
student attempt a greeting-style
head nod late Monday morning,
only to have the intended recipi-
ent walk on, unfazed.

“Some eye contact would
have been nice,” says Jeff Wil-
son ’10, the student who was
later identified as the initiator of
the one-sided greeting. Wilson
claims that he was “shocked”
and “embarrassed” when his nod
went unreciprocated.

This incident is indicative of
a campus-wide problem, accord-
ing to Sarah Rogers ’09, psychol-
ogy major and extraordinarily
credible expert.

A recent informal poll con-
ducted by Rogers shows a 47%
rejection rate for head nod greet-
ings on the Davidson campus.
That number is up from a mere
25% rejection rate last March.

“People are becoming less
willing to put themselves out
there with a nod. We’re drift-
ing apart as a community,” says
Rogers.

Jessica McDonald ’11, iden-
tified by several eyewitnesses
as the rejecter of Wilson’s head
nod, declined to comment.
