“I do an adequate job in what I do with career placement, but you students deserve a lot more,” commented
Suzie Summers, placement coordinator at Davidson. “I've been doing placement and job interviews for five years and I feel qualified
to say that not enough is being done,” added Summers.

With her many other duties in the College Union, Summers can only devote part of her time to her placement
activities. “We need a full-time professional with experience and the proper educational background in counseling to do this placement job,”
remarked Summers.

So far this year, 30 companies have visited the Davidson campus to conduct job interviews. Most of the companies represent
banks and insurance firms. Several years ago, twice as many companies visited the campus. “I do not have enough time
to even solicit visits from companies. All the companies that come have just called the campus, and I arrange the
interviews,” explained Summers.

Students participate in the placement service by completing information which is held in a permanent resumé file. Thirty-eight students are
on file at present. “Many more students come by quite often to ask for information and guidance,” said Summers.

“Quite a few students who come by to see me say they are made to feel ‘sub-standard’, and sometimes ‘worthless’,
just because they aren't going on to graduate schools. The entire community should recognize that these students are just as
important as those who continue their education, and proper guidance should be offered to them,” remarked Summers.

College administration officials say that the placement operation has declined because more and more Davidson students are attending graduate schools.
“As it stands, we do not need anyone beyond a part-time employee handling job interviews and placement,” stated College President
Samuel R. Spencer Jr. “We are quite confident, however, that we will receive a federal grant to hire a professional
to aid us in the placement program,” added Spencer.

Davidson also offers counseling to students interested in attending professional schools for study in medicine, law, or the ministry. Despite
the talk about a pre-managerial program, there is not yet one on campus.

“There is no pre-managerial program at Davidson. If resources are allocated to guide students into other professional areas, there should
also be a pre-managerial program,” stated Professor of Economics Charles Ratliff.

He said that many students are not even aware of jobs in public administration and foreign affairs. “A lot of
decisions are made by the public sector and Davidson students should be aware of this,” remarked Ratliff.

“The pre-law committee is not as aggressive in obtaining admittance for their students as the pre-med committee is. The pre-law
committee never meets with pre-law students, much less provide practice interviews as the pre-med committee does,” added Ratliff.

With admittance into law school becoming more difficult to gain each year, the pre-law program has begun to attract criticism.

“We are a small school with high academic standards. Pre-med and pre-ministerial seem to spread Davidson’s reputation throughout the country,”
said Will Terry, Dean of Students.

Terry commented on the lack of faith many pre-law students have in their faculty committee. He stated that the pre-law
program needs to be beefed up.

“The pre-law program needs to be beefed up,” said Terry. “The pre-ministerial committee should be lauded for inviting so many
ministers and seminary officials to campus. Pre-law should follow this example. It is very rare that lawyers are invited on
campus. How can students ever really be sure about law as a career until they meet with lawyers who are
engaged in all phases of the law?”

The current chairmen of the three pre-professional programs are: Winfred Minter (pre-law), James Frederickson (pre-med), and Samuel Maloney (pre-min). Director
of Student Counseling Office William Hight is a member of each of the pre-professional staffs.

“My main activities involve administering aptitude and vocational interest tests to sophomores and seniors,” stated Hight. Hight also teaches four
courses each year. “So, I am not even employed full-time to work only at counseling, and I am the only
professional in the Student Counseling Office,” he said.

Hight offered some observations about student testing. “I agree that it would be better to offer sophomore testing in the
fall rather than the spring, but with my course load as a professor and with the time taken for senior
testing, there’s no way one man can do it all,” remarked Hight.

The reason fall sophomore testing would be more beneficial to students than spring testing, according to Hight, is that students
can use the test results to help them determine a major. “I am very hopeful that the federal grant for
counseling will come in. It would aid all of us who work with counseling,” said Hight.

Randall R. Kincaid, professor of Economics and director of extended studies and career service, and John D. Kelton, professor of
Psychology and director of the N.C. Fellows, also have the personal contacts and experience to be of great help to
the Placement Program.

“Smith, Hight, Kincaid, and Kelton have always been willing to help in every way, but they are just too busy
in other areas to be able to devote a lot of time to Placement,” Summers explained. “What we need is
one person whose sole responsibility is to coordinate the Program.”

“We’re hopeful that the college soon will initiate a Placement Program combining (1) permanent job placement, (2) graduate school placement,
(3) career service, (4) Co-op education, and (5) extended studies projects serving dual purposes,” Summers said.

While the people now in charge of these programs are doing excellent jobs, the fragmentation of the different directors and
different offices works to the detriment of the total program. “We are all working hard to make even our limited
program work, but we can’t be satisfied with what we’re doing now because we can and should do so much
more,” concluded Summers.
