bers and brought therefrom a human skull.” “The story is often related by the students, is that a whole skeleton was dropped into the column. This version of the story, however, must be erroneous, because had a whole skeleton been dropped into it, a thorough search would have revealed other parts, while the skull itself was in a perfect state of preservation. Thus, according to THE DAVIDSONIAN, which, as we know, is always right, but is never wrong, only a skull was found and it was discovered in 1914 and so of course was not found when the columns were torn down. Nevertheless, there is still further information about this interesting story.

Evidently Miss Shaw's article in the Davidson College Bulletin was widely read, for one of the readers undertook to write her and set her straight on the story. This letter, written by Earl Rowland (‘15), is now in the library file on Old Chambers. After the opening amenities and a reference to Miss Shaw's column, Mr. Rowland writes:

“We feel that you should know no skeleton. One rainy Sabbath afternoon a curious lad named Dumas ('15) who came to Davidson from the wilds of Atlanta, “Butch” McKay (17) and several others explored the depths of the pillars with the aid of a pocket flashlight suspended on a bit of twine. This was not very successful due to the accumulated dust, debris and other bric-a-brac found in each column. Not satisfied, Dumas went down in place of—or with—the flashlight, carrying also a basket and the promise of those letting him down that they would eventually pull him up again, and that they would refrain from dropping anything, liquid, solid or otherwise into the column while he was down.

In one column he found a human skull, in good condition except that it was cut like the pumpkins used at Hallowe'en. The section of bone which had been cut out was also found. In another pillar, he found a complete skeleton, badly eaten by what appeared to be lime. The basket was used for bringing up the bones. A section of the back and ribs was allotted to “Butch” McKay and his unfortunate roommate and decorated the walls of 15 Watts, during the remainder of their sojourn at Davidson...

“Anyway, this is why no skeleton was found when the pillars of Old Chambers were pulled down by an order of the Trustees.”

From the above we can see that Mr. Rowland was well informed, and I believe that his is the more complete account of what actually happened. THE DAVIDSONIAN evidently made a slight slip up when it stated no skeleton was found, and Miss Shaw had probably never heard of the story since the incident even though she was here when the incident occurred, having come to Davidson in 1907. Finally, as a matter of conjecture, it is interesting to wonder how the skeleton ever got there in the first place. Perhaps some student of the old North Carolina Medical School went grave robbing one night and then had to hide his stolen cadaver when the law got too close on his trail.

were Flynn Long, Clayton Carpenter, Gilbert Humphreys, Frank Lowe, Henry Hansen and Paul Jenkins. The Davidson chapter of the fraternity does not consider musical talent alone, or the membership in one of the musical organizations on the campus. It is the purpose of this chapter to sponsor enterprises in fields other than music, and any division of the Fine Arts is received with equal enthusiasm. This initiation was the second and final initiation of the present school year. In the spring the fraternity will extend bids to another group of men who will upon their acceptance be initiated immediately following the beginning of the fall term. Phi Mu Alpha wishes to call to the attention of the student body some of the activities open to student attendance for the remainder of this semester. There will be both a faculty and student recital later to be announced soon, and every Wednesday afternoon there is the Listening Hour at the record room in Oak Row.

find out what happened to his little bundle of charms for the greater part of Saturday night. Judging from the look of consternation on his face he is somewhat in the dark.about the matter. Musta been those Rotators! At any rate, everyone was greatly benefited by the break in the drab existence we have been leading with the books, and everyone is attempting to catch up on his lost sleep, and contemplating further wheelin’, dealin’, and rotatin’!

Well, now with the week-end over, everyone is still kicking although some look like they were dead. Only a few of the "revelers" got flushed late. Brother Edwards (Sterling, that is) wished they had flushed before she would consent to going.

CONFERENCE WINS...

Williams led the point makers as he hit for seven of nine tries from the floor and added six charity tosses for twenty points. Cheek made 15 and Cobb added 12. Maner turned in what was possibly his best game of the year before he fouled out in the third quarter. Carper made a last-minute call to Washington, D.C. Thursday morning and got his date to fly down although he didn't know she was coming until she walked in. Jim Gunn's date was snowed in until Saturday but after that Gunn was snowed in. Brother Rapp and his date are the only people I know that can read poetry in the dark (or is it light at 5 a.m.?).

Bill Williams is taking up the game of golf. Could it be because the girl he dated for the dances goes with a “big golfer”? I've heard that some of the brothers didn’t develop any particular love for the detectives employed in some of the establishments in Charlotte. Brother Shep took a swing at his date—she ducked—he hit the windshield!!! Brother Schmidt gave his date a ring this week-end. I hear that Brother Lemmon’s date over the week-end is soon to become his sister! If you can't figure that out, ask him.

All in all, I believe that in spite of the weather, everyone really had as big a time as they ever did and the Pan Hellenic Council is to be congratulated for such successful dances.

All copy for The Davidsonian should be turned in to the editor by 12 o'clock noon on Monday to ensure insertion in the following Friday's issue.

“When I bring my tobacco to market I’m always looking for the Liggett & Myers buyers because I know when I've got real good mild, ripe sweet tobacco they’ll pay the top dollar for it.

“I’ve been smoking Chesterfields for about 25 years. I like their taste—I know the kind of tobacco that’s in them.”
