**Election Chaos Tests SGA Credibility**  
By BILL BARNETT  
Staff Writer

For those of you who do not know it, SGA elections were held last week. Senators from every dorm, as well as several from off-campus, were chosen. This in itself is not surprising. What is surprising is how poorly the elections were handled. The General Council of the SGA is responsible for the organization and execution of SGA elections. The leaders of this committee are Chairman Ed Rees and his assistant Warren Soule. They are supposed to organize the elections and, with the help of fellow senators and volunteers, see that it runs smoothly. Unfortunately, our most recent election did not run smoothly. SGA President Bo Baskin called the elections process “very slipshod and inefficient,” adding later that steps had been taken to remedy the situation.

Most of the problems connected with the election stemmed from a lack of publicity. Most students were unaware that an election was coming up, and the deadline for filing for candidacy passed very quietly. Thus, many of the Senate seats would not even have been contested. For instance, in Cannon dorm, Bill Peeples was the only freshman to file for the three seats available. At this point, word got around that several Senate spots were available for the taking. Several people talked to either Baskin or Rees and got their names on the ballot during the week following the deadline. As illegal as this may seem, it is still better than letting the seats go vacant, or so the reasoning goes.

At any rate, Thursday rolled around and the election seemed likely to be held on time. However, Carol Connor, one of the first people to man the ballot boxes, noticed, much to her chagrin, that her name was not listed. This happened despite the fact that she had spoken to one of the SGA officers several weeks before about getting on the ballot. She also noticed that Rick Rauck had filed as a candidate for off-campus senator even though he presently resides in Little 104. It seems that he planned to move off-campus soon, and thus assumed he should register as an off-campus candidate. After much organized confusion, the elections were called off until Friday. The truly curious students on campus found out what had happened, but everyone else was left in the dark. Some of the candidates were notified, but others passed the night with no knowledge of what was going on. Over the night, the ballots were remade, and plans reset. On Friday, the election finally took place.

Reliable sources indicate that the votes were tallied and the results released over the weekend. Bo Baskin swears he can tell you who won and lost; however, there is a severe shortage of these results available to students. Very few result sheets have been posted, and there was no mention of the results in Tuesday’s announcements. Hopefully, the winners do know that they have won. Another SGA election is coming up this week, that of freshman class senators. Baskin reports that arrangements for this one have been made well in advance, and that foul-ups like those plaguing the last election will be avoided. Let’s hope so. However, the point here is not how to run an election. The point is: How can the SGA hope to improve their credibility if they can’t even run a simple little election? The SGA has been trying for a long time to have more authority invested in them, but who would be so foolish as to give them responsibility for something important when they can’t handle something simple like an election? Certainly not anyone with any sense of foresight. One bungled election has probably not done any irreparable damage. In fact, it may have done some good if it heightened the SGA’s sense of responsibility. Certainly it should have alerted them to the possibility that they will lose the little authority they have if they continue with their inefficiency.

The statement now meaningless has been involved in producing the various statements are not satisfied with the current draft. The feeling among them is that the battle they have had over the statement is better fought on other fronts. These fronts include the make-up of the media board called for in section six of the document and the opportunities that will arise for interpretation of what the statement says. The Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities has lost its luster as a document. The fact that there still remains some discussion about the meaning of the statement only points to the nonspecificity and breadth of the language used in the document. The Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities has at this time been milked of its specificity so that it can now mean almost anything. But what is the value of a document like this? It provides the student nothing to put his trust in, nothing to regard as the letter of the law in cases of academic disputes, and nothing to cling to with regard to provision for his expression. The document has been made worthless by the numerous changes and revisions it has had to undergo. We feel sorry for it, it is dead.

The time is now being set for a student referendum. This opportunity to vote for or against the document leaves the students one final chance to accept what has been drawn up and prepared for him or to vote it down so that the ghost of the dead thing cannot come back to haunt him. We will vote against it because we believe that the Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities is no longer what it was intended to be. We believe that it is no longer anything.
