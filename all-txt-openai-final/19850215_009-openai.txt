This is Spinal Tap — (1984) Starring Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, Harry Shearer, Paul Shaffer, and Rob Reiner. Directed by
Rob Reiner. *** ½*

Motley Crue, Def Leppard, AC/DC, Iron Maiden, Quiet Riot, Black Sabbath — if you harbor any feelings about these heavy-metal
bands, then This is Spinal Tap demands to be seen. If you especially find a real humor in the absurdity
of grown men brandishing shorts, leather, Druid costumes, or Satanic symbols onstage, then Spinal Tap is for you. Rob Reiner’s
Spinal Tap does not settle for mere satirization but serious abuse of the hard rock music genre. By tracing the
trials of an aging British band, Spinal Tap, Reiner, and company provide a penetrating and entertaining study of a curious
subject — heavy-metal bands.

Amid lame Hollywood “comedies,” Spinal Tap offers intelligence, verve, and hilarity. It’s a real treat.

This is Spinal Tap documents the comeback tour of a washed-up, hard-rock group. Spinal Tap tours to promote its new
album, Smell the Glove. From the initial disagreement over the album cover (scheduled to picture a naked, greased woman clad
with a dog collar smelling a glove, it comes out solid black instead), Spinal Tap zips through one discouraging, humorous
event after another in the band’s demise.

Composed of Englishmen with names like Derek and Ian, Spinal Tap tries hard to impress and express raw emotion and
anger onstage, but the trivial backstage interviews undercut their “artistry.”

Director Rob Reiner portrays the fictional filmmaker Marty Diberghi, a man determined to discover the truth about rock and roll.
Diberghi asks probing questions that reveal Spinal Tap’s roots. He finds that Spinal Tap has gone through over 30 drummers
because they traditionally die by spontaneously combusting onstage. The band admits that one drummer died by choking on vomit determined
not to be his own.

Clips from old television appearances show Spinal Tap’s early days, as a Beatles rip-off and later a psychedelic “groovy love”
band. The black and white Beatles segment and kaleidoscope psychedelia shots evoke genuine and silly period flavor. Diberghi enables his
audience to understand what makes Spinal Tap the absolute critical and popular failure they are today.

The dramatic concert footage supplies the film’s most hilarious moments. Singing songs like “Sex Farm,” Spinal Tap exhibits its aging,
faded performance prowess. Props intended to overwhelm the audience end up dominating the band. Cocoons, scheduled to open when the
music begins, trap the terrified bass player. While the stagehands use crowbars, hammers, and blowtorches to free him for his
solo, Spinal Tap plays on. When the lead guitarist bends over backwards for his standard, excruciating solo, he literally bends
over backwards. Roadies must pick the guitarist and the guitar off the ground.

The final hilarious blow comes when an 18-foot Stonehenge prop shrinks to smaller proportions than the group demands. Management and
artistic differences leave the band shorthanded, and a spontaneous free-form jazz sound is substituted: absurdist, hilarious filmmaking.

This is Spinal Tap succeeds in every frame of every scene because of the absolute seriousness of performers and the
director on screen. Reiner brings a revolting earnestness to his role as Diberghi that forces the viewer to laugh at
him. Spinal Tap’s principal members are portrayed by Michael McKean (Lenny of “Laverne and Shirley”) and two current “Saturday Night
Live” cast members, Christopher Guest and Harry Shearer. Adopting staunch British accents and tangled hair, McKean, Guest, and Shearer manage
to keep straight faces throughout their ridiculous statements and songs. Spinal Tap works because the performers act as serious about
their “music” as real bands like AC/DC and the Scorpions often attempt. Reiner’s direction and script allow McKean and company
simply to ramble with their ludicrous characters.

As Derek St. Simons, McKean does a miraculous job of retaining a blank expression, angry stare, and harmless brain throughout
the 90 roaring minutes.

The look, the feel, and the sound of Spinal Tap are strikingly accurate. Reiner and his cast display an obvious
understanding and mastery of the heavy-metal genre. They know how bored British rockers talk, act, and think. Tackling a subject
primed for satire, Reiner, Guest, McKean, and Shearer absolutely abuse the most popular bands in one of music’s most popular,
lamentable forms. This is Spinal Tap is a lethal comedy. It’s a rare, witty film that deserves to be seen,
loved, and praised.
