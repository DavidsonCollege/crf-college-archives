BLINDMAN'S BLUFF...

Last night the season began for eight teams in the Southern Conference. Tonight, it continues for only four and tomorrow it will end for all but one. To be quite honest, this column was written Wednesday night; by now it could be quite old news. But so many, many words have been written of the coming tournament that I thought it would be interesting to put my foot in my mouth two days ahead of time. So the following few lines are my predictions of the outcome of this tournament.

I have always felt that the most important single aspect of basketball is rebounding. To win consistently a team must get more rebounds than its opponent. In fact, there’s probably a certain spread in the rebound totals that guarantees a winning team. In a short tournament, many factors enter into consideration—measles, youth, even just a bad night. But the team that will overcome these factors is the team that wins off the boards, and that team is not necessarily the tallest. For rebounding is about 60% desire or instinct or something not so tangible as height—measured in feet and inches. That’s the thing I first look for at the start of a basketball game and before this tournament ends, rebounding will decide the champion.

Thursday afternoon Davidson will beat The Citadel and VMI will nip Furman. Thursday night West Virginia will overwhelm William and Mary behind the aggressive play of any of about eight men but particularly senior Tom Lowry. In the second game the tournament’s major upset will occur as George Washington tops VPI. Friday night Davidson will beat VMI for the third time this season and West Virginia will have a surprisingly easy win over George Washington. Saturday will provide a replay of last year’s final game. In last year’s game, the team that wanted to win the title won. This year’s title will again be decided by the mental attitude of the two teams. For upon this attitude will depend the outcome of the battle for the Davidson College will win its first Southern Conference basketball championship ever this year only because they want to win it. Well, by this time I imagine the above has already provided a horse laugh or two but that’s how I see it, Wednesday night.

OUR FATHERS’ TIME FLEETINGLY...

So the days of George Gipp are gone? Tuesday night Cassius Clay knocked out Sonny Liston in Miami. Monday night, the University of Virginia beat the University of North Carolina in Charlottesville. The significance of the first victory is obvious but the second requires some explanation. Monday night was Chip Conner night in Charlottesville but Chip Conner was not there. Conner is the anemic-looking forward who for three years has been the backbone of the Cavalier attack. Earlier this year, Conner led Virginia in what was very nearly an upset over Davidson in the Charlotte Coliseum. He possesses all of the basic shots, plus a great hanging drive, and has been a great competitor. Monday, the University was to present him with a trophy in appreciation of his career performance. Chip Conner did not accept this trophy. His parents received it for him; Conner had been sidelined with emergency surgery earlier in the day. And so the “Connerless Cavaliers” tackled North Carolina. Coach Bob Gibson related that Virginia decided to win one for Chip. And in that land of sophistication where the campus is the “grounds” and a gentleman wears a tie—the unsophistication of another year returned briefly and Virginia soundly thrashed North Carolina... for Chip.

THE ALL-STAR TEAM

This week the Southern Conference all-star team was announced. Davidson placed all five starters on this list of the outstanding players in the conference. Fred Hetzel was unanimously elected to the first team for the second consecutive year. Terry Holland and Dick Snyder were named on the second team, while Don Davidson and Barry Teague were named honorable mention. In the history of the Southern Conference no team has achieved such an honor. In addition to Hetzel, the first team was made up of Howard Pardue from VPI, Bill Blair of VMI, Tom Lowry of West Virginia, Joe Adamitis from George Washington and John Telepo of Richmond. No doubt, these five ball players have all the credentials to back up their selection but just for a moment, I'd like to take my hand at picking an All-Southern Conference team. The difference between the selection process of these two teams will be that I will exclude all Davidson players and consider only those players who have played against Davidson this year. This will of course eliminate George Washington and VPI from any consideration but this is only one man’s opinion.

At center I would pick Tom Lowry. Although Lowry was less than sensational in Charlotte, his performance in Charleston was the best pivot performance of the season with the exception of Jay Buckley. The two forwards on my team would be Martin Morris of William and Mary who simply could not miss in Norfolk, and John Telepo who played two fine games against Davidson. Bill Blair was very cold and very hot against Davidson, but on the basis of his performance in little old Johnston Gym, he’s one guard. The other guard, I pick as captain of the team. He is Mike West from The Citadel. Perhaps, West only plays well against Davidson but that he has done, displaying not only a strong scoring ability but a great “feel” for the game of basketball. These five men are the ones who have given Davidson the most trouble this year. That’s the basis for their selection. The only basis.

’Cats Storm Citadel Behind Davidson, Pardue And Gobblers Davidson, VMI Clash In Semi-Finals Tonight

It’s one down and seven to go for Davidson's eighth-ranked Wildcats. The ‘Cats got off to a good start in the post-season play Thursday night by romping over The Citadel. Other winners in the first round of the Southern Conference tournament...

Tonight at winner of the West Virginia-George Washington game. The score, 91-62, makes the ‘Cats’ win over The Citadel look easier than it was. During the first half the scrappy Cadets sent Dick Martini and Mike Wood driving through a porous Davidson defense and trailed by only one point, 33-32, at the halfway mark. The second period, however, belonged to the favor...

Wildcats Probably Reface Princeton If Survive Tournament Maelstrom BY JOHNNY CLARK

Assuming Wildcat victories in the Southern Conference Tournament tonight and tomorrow night, a rematch with the Bill Bradley-led Princeton Tigers looms as a likelihood for the Davidson cagers in the Eastern Regional Tournament. Philadelphia hosts the first round of the tourney, March 9, in which the Southern Conference champion will meet the winner of the Ivy League crown. Princeton, which was clobbered 102-68 by the Wildcats in the finals of the Charlotte Invitational earlier this season, is presently the front-runner among the Ivies, who decide their championship by regular season play. Other games in the City of Brotherly Love will match two independents, Villanova and Providence, and will pit Middle Atlantic Conference Champion Temple against the champion of the Yankee Conference. Villanova, which also brings a team of Wildcats into the tournament, is ranked eighth in the nation, a notch behind Davidson, and is a strong favorite to defeat the Friars of Providence, champions of last year’s National Invitational Tournament. Home-standing Temple is likewise a favorite to eliminate the eventual champion of the Yankee Conference, which will probably be Connecticut. Philadelphia’s three winners will join the Atlantic Coast Conference champ in Raleigh, March 13 and 14, for the final two rounds of the Eastern Regionals. The ACC representative has a bye in the first round by virtue of the conference’s success in previous tournaments.

...survivors from the Mideast, Midwest, and Far West Regionals for the NCAA semi-finals and finals in Kansas City, March 20 and 21. The semi-final round will pit the Raleigh champ against...“TEAGUE GOES UP A rare move to the inside... nament against the title-holder of the Ohio Valley, Lan Perence whose contenders are such notables as Murray State, Morehead State, and East Tennessee. Independent Louisville plays against the Mid-America Conference champ, probably Toledo. The Eastern winner joins the victor in the Midwest, probably Wichita, and the Mideast in the other first-round action. The winners of these two contests will be joined in the semi-finals by the champions of the Big 10 and Southeastern conferences. Reigning National Champion Loyola of Chicago, an independent, opens in the Mideast tour. Second-ranked Kentucky will rate as the Mideast favorite if it can edge Georgia Tech for the Southeastern title, and third-ranked Michigan will provide the chief competition if it can beat out Davidson victim Ohio State in the Big 10. Both conferences' championships are determined by regular season play. First-round action in the Midwest tourney will pit independent Oklahoma City, the tallest team in the nation, against giant-killer Creighton, also an independent, and the Southwest Conference Champ, probably Texas A&M, against independent Texas Western. In the semi-finals will be the winners of these two games and the champions of the Big 8 and Missouri Valley conferences. The Big Eight leader is Kansas State, while Drake and fourth-ranked Wichita, top team in the Midwest, are the contenders in the Valley League. Undefeated and nationally top-ranked UCLA is expected to breeze through the Far West affair and has a bye in the first round, which matches Utah State, an independent, against the Western Athletic Conference champion, either Arizona State or New Mexico, and sixth-ranked independent Oregon State against Seattle, also an independent. The West Coast Athletic champion, probably San Francisco, a disappointment this year, will join the Big 6 Champion UCLA and the two first-round winners in the semi-finals.

Driesell Signs Two For Team Next Year Coach Lefty Driesell likes to run a double pivot offense. With the first two boys signed to grant-in-aids this winter, he has the basis of the offense—two big boys. They are Rodney Knowles, a 6-9, 225-pound center-forward from Greenville, North Carolina, and Tom Youngdale, from Peru, Illinois. Knowles has been described as the best college prospect to come out of North Carolina in several years. Before he was sidelined with a knee injury, he was averaging 27.8 points and 15 rebounds for his team's first 12 games. According to Coach Driesell, Knowles can play forward or center and feel equally at home. “Rodney is an excellent shooter from outside and he’s strong inside,” says an obviously pleased Driesell. Youngdale has credentials almost as impressive as those of Knowles. Playing in an area where the competition is most certainly tougher, he is averaging 23 points per game and hitting a good 48.8% of his shots. He was the first prospect signed by Driesell. He made his decision to come to Davidson late in January. According to Driesell, Youngdale is “an excellent student who has the potential to be a tremendous college basketball player. Along with Knowles,” Driesell says, “he should give us a strong double pivot and keep our basketball program rolling.”

Davidson placed an unprecedented five men on the All-Southern Conference Team with Hetzel being a unanimous first-team choice and voted the conference's Most Valuable Player. Named to the second team in the poll of sportswriters in the area were Terry Holland, this year's team captain, and Dick Snyder. Barry Teague and Don Davidson received honorable mention recognition.
