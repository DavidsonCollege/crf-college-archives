— Swimming Teams Improving Before Upcoming Southern States Championships

By Will Cobb

The Davidson swim team has had a very busy January. The team traveled to Tampa, FL, on January 2 for a meet against the University of Tampa squad that unfortunately never happened as a result of a no-show by the host school. Despite that, the team was able to train hard and the trip ended up being very beneficial.

The team had home meets on January 16 and 17 against College of Charleston and the University of Richmond. Even though the team lost both meets, the competition was tough and the team’s improvement was obvious as times continued to drop.

Against College of Charleston, freshman Julie Brown placed second in one-meter and three-meter diving. Rebecca Falkenburg placed second in the 100-meter freestyle, while Wendy Johnson took second in the 500-meter free. In men’s competition, freshman Churchill Hooff took first in the 100 and 500-meter freestyle. Senior Curtis Bickers placed first in three-meter diving and second in one-meter diving, while Corey Bean took first in the 200 butterfly.

Against Richmond, Caroline Prioleau placed second in three-meter diving while Meg Bentley took first in one-meter diving. Kate Welling finished first in the 100 backstroke and Jennifer Schuetz took fourth in the 100-meter breaststroke with a time of 1:20.85. In the men’s competition, Churchill Hooff took first in the 100 and 500-meter freestyle and Curtis Bickers placed second in one-meter and three-meter diving. Dave Martin placed first in the 100-meter backstroke. Both squads showed a lot of improvement, and now prepare for the Southern States Championships at Davidson on February 19-21.

— Records Fall as Men's Track Opens Indoor Season

By Pete Hurtado

The men’s track and field team opened its indoor season quite impressively Saturday, notching two new school records in its first two affairs. The team’s second year in the Southern Conference began with the Lynchburg Invitational and the Comfort Inn Invite at Virginia Tech.

Sophomore standout Lee Sutton began his season with a shot put of 47' 3" at Lynchburg, tying the 13-year-old school record. Look for Sutton to challenge for the conference championship.

Junior Captain Duncan Spears broke his own school record in the 500m run with a fine time of 67.6 at Virginia Tech. Duncan hopes to defend his Southern Conference title in the outdoor 400m hurdles.

Senior Ian Stewart posted the most impressive distance effort, recording one of Davidson’s fastest indoor 3000m runs ever at 9:06.2. The mile corps of senior captain Peter Hurtado (4:37.4), sophomore Erik McMichael (4:37.8), Stewart (4:41), and senior David Kerns (4:43) geared up for the winter season with fine mile times.

In the shot put, juniors Rafael Candelario and Rob King posted identical distances of 37' 3". King also threw the 35 lb. weight a distance of 36' 4". Senior Mike Grant’s 500m effort of 70.8 places him among Davidson’s fastest in that event. In the 800m, sophomore Joe Beach (2:08.3) and senior Ben Wiley (2:08.7) opened their winter season with excellent clockings.

In relays, the most impressive effort came in the 4x100m relay. Davidson’s makeshift squad of Rob Clemens, Rob King, Rafael Candelario, and Lee Sutton shocked onlookers with their stellar handoffs, leading

Update: Davidson 82 Marshall 69

Detlef Musch led the Wildcats with 26 points, while Janko Narat was close behind with 25.

Hoops Continued from page 13

The Wildcats stepped back into Southern Conference play in Cullowhee on January 6 in need of confidence after the UNCC debacle. Behind 64% shooting and a career-high 22 points from senior J.D. Heuer, they got it. Seemingly ready to pull away permanently with a 12-point lead midway through the second half, Davidson withstood a Catamount run that brought them within 71-69 with 2:32 to play. Musch, Narat, Zimmerman, Alpert, and Heuer combined to hit 10 of 10 foul shots over the last 1:44 to lock up the win.

Furman 80 Davidson 73

With dreadful (22%) first-half shooting on January 9 in Greenville, the ‘Cats fell behind 23 points to the Paladins, then launched an astonishing comeback. From Narat’s three-pointer to beat the first half buzzer to Brandon Williams’ three-pointer with 8:16 to play, Davidson outscored Furman 41-16 to take a 64-62 lead. But the icy shooting touch reappeared for the latter stages of the game, and the Paladins escaped with the win. Zimmerman had 16 points and Williams 14.

N.C. State 63 Davidson 58

Against a struggling N.C. State team down to nine players on January 11 at Belk Arena, Davidson’s 11-year long losing streak against ACC competition seemed ripe for termination, particularly when the ‘Cats took a 53-52 lead on Narat’s three-pointer with 4:07 left. But State’s Mark Davis responded with a three of his own and the Pack hung on to win. Musch had 16, Heuer 15, and Narat 14 for Davidson (4-5). The game was the team’s first without junior Ron Horton, who tore knee ligaments in practice and is lost for the year; it is his third straight season-ending injury.

East Tennessee State 75 Davidson 67

By taking ETSU, winner of the last four Southern Conference titles and last year a first-round victor in the NCAA Tournament over Arizona, to the wire before losing in Johnson City, TN, the ‘Cats earned some respect in the conference. Davidson (4-6, 1-2) got to within 64-60 on Alpert’s two free throws at 4:50, but couldn’t convert down the stretch. Said coach Bob McKillop, “I'd like to see less good VMI surge and sent Davidson (6-7, 3-3) to the easy win. All 14 Wildcats played, including senior co-captain Matt Matheny, whose free throw at :28 touched off the Steak and Hoagie Offensive Explosion. Musch scored 16, Zimmerman 15, and Heuer 14.
