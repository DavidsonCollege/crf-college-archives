They Nearly Made Me Cry...

Now, I’m not the world’s most passionate guy, but when they sang rock 'n roll they nearly made me cry.

Well, sort of. The Kinks came to the Charlotte Coliseum last Sunday and took it by storm, or rather by
good solid rock and roll — the kind that’s kept them popular longer than most rock stars have been walking.

Despite the onus of “festival (or animal) seating,” the Kinks were able to get the crowd moving. From my safe
vantage point, in a side seat, it looked pretty grim in front of the stage. Tension is a trademark of
the Kinks. They played the opening song in the dark and would often let familiar riffs to well-known songs fall
without following them up till later. They grabbed the crowd early with their current hit “Destroyer” but stopped a few
lines into it. They wouldn’t continue until the crowd “talked” them into it. They used all the tactics of a
consummate... well, let’s just say they teased the crowd.

If you think “Lola” is good cranked in your room with some buddies on a slow Saturday night, you can
imagine it with the originals as songleaders. It was almost worth the price of admission in itself. They handled the
slower ballads like “Art Lover” and “Celluloid Heroes” unexpectedly well, coming down from their high-energy rocking. But the Coliseum is
hardly the place to listen for lyrics like:

...I wish my life
