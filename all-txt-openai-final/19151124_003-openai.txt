WITH OTHER COLLEGES.

Wake Forest—A new honor system has been recently adopted at Wake Forest College. Instead of the several presidents acting on
the honor committee, as in the past, the nine members who constitute the new council will be elected by a
direct vote of the students. The chairman is elected by a vote of the entire student body, and the other
members are chosen from the various classes.

Washington and Lee—The type of work exhibited by the sporting editor of the Ring-Tum Phi in writing up Washington and
Lee's football games must rank among the best in college newspapers. The Ring-Tum Phi is to be congratulated in having
one who can handle athletic news in so admirable a manner.

Vanderbilt—When Vanderbilt defeated Auburn in Birmingham on Saturday, November 13, she defeated a team which had not been scored on
in two seasons. This victory gives Vanderbilt the S. I. A. A. championship for the year 1915.

Washington and Lee—Fears of the students that Coach Elcock, of the football squad, would not return next year, led to
a great demonstration for his return on Saturday of last week. He promised the students that he would return next
year if it were in his power. Through his efficient coaching, Washington & Lee won six and tied one out
of the first seven games played.

V. M. I.—An effort is now being made by the alumni of Virginia Military Institute to raise $1,000,000 for endowment
and permanent improvements. An organization known as the Building and Endowment Association has charge of the campaign.
