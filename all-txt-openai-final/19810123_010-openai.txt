In B league action this week, the Toads overwhelmed Short but Slow and set up a possible championship preview between them and Heightless on Thursday. In Women's action, the Amazons on 4th Rich beat the Philadelphia ’76ers in a brutal game. If you want any other scores, call up John Butler at 892-3830 or visit him at Slug-Wood Manor. He'll be glad to help if he isn’t out getting some mud for his turtle.
