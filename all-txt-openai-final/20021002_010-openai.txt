**Soccer Remains Undefeated in SoCon**

After five games away from home, the women’s soccer team continued its recent success in conference play this weekend with
a 6-2 win over Chattanooga and a 1-1 tie with Western Carolina. The Wildcats improve to 4-5-1 overall, and 4-0-1
in the Southern Conference.

Friday afternoon’s game featured the Wildcats against the Chattanooga Mocs, who came in at 5-1 overall and 1-0 in the
Southern Conference. But the Wildcats, playing their first home game in almost three weeks, came out focused. Senior defender Tara
Maloney, a preseason all-conference selection, scored on an assist from her sister, Heather Maloney, a fellow preseason all-conference selection, in
the 15th minute to give the Wildcats an early lead. In the 37th minute, junior Stephanie Bouts scored off an
assist from Leigh Anne Hoskins to give Davidson a 2-0 lead going into the break.

In the second half, the Mocs showed the ‘Cats why they are better than the ninth seed they were given
in the preseason, and tied the game up with 15 minutes remaining. In the 84th minute, however, with the game
seemingly headed into overtime, the Wildcats took charge with their most impressive offensive outburst of the season. Heather Maloney started
the charge with a breakaway goal. Immediately afterwards, Hoskins added another goal to push the lead to two. On an
assist from her sister Tara, Heather Maloney scored again in the 88th minute. The two goals gave her six for
the season and 33 for her career, bringing her within six goals of owning the school record for goals in
a career, with nine games and the conference tournament remaining. Denielle Erickson scored a final goal with 40 seconds left
to give the Wildcats a 6-2 victory that was far closer than the final score would indicate.

Sunday’s match against Western Carolina was a crucial one for the ‘Cats, since the Catamounts are the defending conference regular-season
champions and were picked second in the preseason polls. But Davidson played aggressively, racking up 19 shots, the team’s third-highest
total of the season, while giving up just 10. Sarah Hobart, named the Southern Conference Player of the Week after
giving up only one goal in two conference victories last week, made five more saves to bring her season total
to 61. But the Catamounts managed to get on the board first in the 64th minute when Felicia Wilson scored
unassisted. The crowd, the largest of the season due to a doubleheader with the men’s team, remained on edge until
a foul in the penalty box in the 81st minute gave freshman Kara Koehrn a penalty kick, which she converted
to tie the score at 1-1. Despite aggressive play in the overtime periods from both sides, neither team could score
and the game ended in a tie.

The ‘Cats get four days to rest this week after playing eight games over the past 23 days. On Friday,
they host Virginia Tech, who comes in at 2-6-1 overall in the tough Big East conference. The Wildcats will be
trying to earn their first non-conference win of the season. The game is at 4 pm in Richardson Stadium.

**Great American Race Proves Disastrous for Men’s X-Country**

Team finishes seventh in wet, muddy conditions

It was...Bad. Real bad. The Men’s Cross-country team tore up the golf courses—literally as opposed to figuratively—on their way to
a seventh-place finish out of fourteen teams at the Nike-sponsored Great American Open, which was hosted by the Ballantyne Resort
in Charlotte this past weekend. Tropical Storm Isadore sufficiently soaked the course ahead of time, and the sun poked its
nose out just before the start of the “A” team race, leaving hot, humid, and very muddy conditions. Having three
races run beforehand also didn’t help the course that would be taking 32 races and over 4000 runners between Friday
and Saturday. The meet is one of the largest high school and collegiate cross-country races around.

As for the Davidson team, the race might as well not exist. Times were awful, racing was poor, and spirits
were down. Senior Brad Becken led the team, coming in 24th overall. Teammates Chris Schmader, a junior, and freshman Jonathan
Baker were the next Wildcats to cross the line. Junior Greg Scott and senior Jimmy Swansbrough, who had an IV
placed in his arm after collapsing at the line, rounded off the top five. “It was a very slow, muddy
race. It’s one of those races where you take what you can and forget about it,” commented Baker. Sophomore Kevin
Bell, who ran in the “B” team race a little earlier, came to the same conclusion. “What you get out
of a race like this is that no matter how bad things get, you can always gut the pain and
finish.”

The general team consensus was to just put the day behind them and move on, and any sort of positive
attitude was tough to come by. Coach Andrew didn’t know what to think about the day. “This course has never
been run before [as a cross-country meet], and coupled with the poor conditions, I don’t know what to think of
our efforts. Times were slow all over the place.” As for the course itself, it sent runners along fairways, over
slanted surfaces, up and down hills, and even along the cement golf path. Baker, however, admitted the course was somewhat
to his liking. “I kind of like hilly courses, so this place would have been good if it had not
have been pea-soup. Although some of the mud was pretty fun, all of those sloppy turns would just decelerate you,”
he said.

With the conference meet looming on the horizon, many questions remain surrounding the Davidson cross-country team. Are they a true
top-three contender? Can they run better than they have? The team would like to think so, and with the North
Carolina Intercollegiate meet in a week and a half at ECU, they are ready to put this past weekend behind
them and move in a positive direction once again.
