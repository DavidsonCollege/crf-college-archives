**Mr. Faulkner pays a visit to Davidson**

By MARK CHEN

On the night of Dec. 4, the novelist William Faulkner paid a visit to Love Auditorium. His showcase was the one-man play *Oh, Mr. Faulkner, Do You Write?*, written and performed by John Maxwell. Maxwell has already performed this play around the country to critical praise.

In an intense two hours of performance, broken by only one intermission, he delighted the audience with anecdotes and public sayings of this Southern writer. Maxwell describes his own mission as “spreading the word,” the words of Faulkner as he spoke and wrote them throughout his literary career. In that respect, the show was a complete success.

The evening began with Faulkner sitting at the typewriter in his hometown of Oxford, Mississippi. He had just won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954 and was desperately avoiding the reporters and other gawkers who were besieging his home. At first telling the audience to go away, Faulkner finally relented and granted an interview. What followed was a rambling conversation touching on his own life, his views on race, other American writers, and the final meaning of literature. The talk veered quickly between the hilarious and the tragic, two qualities which were always present in Faulkner’s life.

The hilarious came out soon enough. Whatever his place in American literature, Faulkner was no distant and cold-blooded icon. He recounted without remorse the legendary Faulkner cussedness. While working in a post office, Faulkner loved to read the magazines, but could not because of the customers. His solution was simple enough — refuse to see any of them and throw away their mail. The title of this play comes from another example. While on a hunting trip with the director Howard Hawks and the actor...

**Photographers show**

By JESSICA FISHER and DIANA MILLER

The winter term customarily provides plenty of free time for the Davidson student. The Light Factory at the Spirit Square Arts Center in Charlotte supplies a cultural complement to balance the Patterson Court festivities. The current exhibition, “A Comparative Portrait of Appalachia: Photographs by Shelby Lee Adams and Doris Ulmann,” is being shown through Dec. 30. This show is unique in that it treats the same subject portrayed through the same medium to achieve dichotomous effects.

Upon entering the exhibit one is confronted with a room devoted solely to the works of Doris Ulmann. These photographs were taken in the late 20s and the early 30s by a well-educated and aristocratic woman. Ulmann worked with the uneducated and poorest white people in the Deep South. Her subject was therefore completely separate from her personal background. Ulmann admired the native and pious intelligence of these Appalachian people whom she referred to as “genuine.” This attitude shaped her approach to her subject. Her photographs are taken in soft focus, are posed, and depict the hard-working and honest side of the Appalachian people. In this way, Ulmann dignifies, almost romanticizes, her subject.

The photograph entitled “Woman With Infant” could be viewed as a rendition of the Madonna and Child portrait. The woman is young, innocently dressed in white, and casts a humble glance at the camera. She cradles her healthy child in her lap, clasping the tiny infant’s hands. The photograph essentially portrays a ship. “Three Generations of Basket Weavers” creates an aura of comforting generational continuum. The grandmother, mother, and daughter are seated in a circle, conscientiously applying themselves to their task. One would deduce that this has been a family activity for generations and will continue uninterrupted infinitely into the future. “Craftsmen Outside Barn” (pictured) clearly depicts Ulmann’s conception of the dignified Appalachian laborer. The seated man proudly holds the tools of his trade upon his lap, and both men are smiling.

The visitor then enters the second room of the exhibit which displays the work of Shelby Lee Adams. Adams is currently an instructor of photography at Salem State College. His photographs of the Appalachian people are contemporary. Adams claims that his photographs represent primarily an autobiographical search since his own roots are in Eastern Kentucky. His heritage has provided him with access to the intimate and clandestine lives of the Appalachian people. Shelby aspires to penetrate the superficial masks which cover the true underlying individual. He does this through his stark and realistic unposed photographs which portray the Appalachian people vividly in their impoverished environment.

The first photograph, “Jacob and His Mother,” shows immediately the contrast in approach by Adams in comparison to Ulmann. Shelby’s portrait is executed in sharp focus with strong lighting in contrast to Ulmann’s use of soft focus. Shelby’s tech...Clark Gable asked him what were the best books in American literature to read. Faulkner listed some books and gave his own. Surprised, Gable asked, “Oh, Mr. Faulkner, do you write?” To which Faulkner responded, “Yes I do, Mr. Gable. What do you do?” But there is another side to Faulkner, one which also came out that evening. It was that of a man always dreamy with the tragedies of life. Many critics start their analysis of Faulkner’s writings by seeking the hidden social commentary. But for Faulkner, the first priority was to depict the larger-than-life men and women stalking his imagination. For him, the problem of race was not political or economic, but on the grander scale of human tragedy. Faulkner said that he proved on God’s creation in his novels, “For God has no sense of the dramatic.” He purposely exaggerated and departed from the bare facts of reality. They did not fit his ideas on the grandeur of man. And it was that dignity which Faulkner believed in all his life. He manifested that belief in all his novels, as well as in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech. In that address, Faulkner affirmed that man “would not only endure, but prevail.”

The task of showing these extremes and contradictions in a one-man show is difficult. Fortunately, Maxwell succeeded in a bravura performance. He switched at a dizzying speed between laughter and grief with hardly a misstep. He portrayed each aspect of Faulkner with both love and understanding. He also succeeded in bringing the audience to a closer appreciation of Faulkner. The set was made up of replicas and of actual objects from Faulkner’s study in Oxford. Maxwell went into the audience and offered gingersnaps, keeping up the illusion of an interview in his home. Perhaps the best measure of the play’s success was how much he enjoyed performing it, coming out for his bows with a radiant smile. The audience mirrored his joy.

On a different note, people always say how there is nothing to do in Davidson. They are correct — if they never do anything. The attendance was good at this play, but there was still room left. This year the Artist Series has been excellent. More events are still left before the academic year is over. There are parties on the weekends and Charlotte will always be within driving distance of Davidson. Why not take a night off and see the Artist Series before it’s over?

The spectrum of Appalachian life highlights the imperfect humanity of its subjects. Like Ullmann’s “Woman and Infant,” “Jacob and His Mother” (pictured) shows a mother holding her child. However, Shelby’s portrait is a distortion of the traditional Madonna and Child motif. The woman’s face is lined and angular, and her lips are pursed to create a discontented expression. She looks into the camera, seeming to forget the unhappy child on her lap. Her child's face carries an infection which shows his unhealthy state. Furthermore, the child’s eyes are teary and bloodshot. The overall effect of this photograph is indeed unsettling.

A second photograph, “103-Year Old Woman and Her Family,” portrays an extended family living in the same small, dilapidated home. The grandmother is sprawled on the dirty blanket covering the bed. She wears a tattered dress and no shoes. Her expression is one of hopeless apathy. She is surrounded by her equally abject family members. Two members of the family are grotesquely overweight; the third sits in gaunt juxtaposition. Whereas Ullmann portrays a similar generational representation in her peaceful and comforting “Three Generations of Basket Weavers,” this photograph displays an absence of unity and an overwhelming sense of despondency.

A final portrait, “Corrinne’s Babies on Christmas Day,” especially demonstrates the indigent condition of Appalachia. Two young boys are sitting on the top of an antiquated, rusty deep freezer beside their only Christmas present, a hand-me-down Tonka truck. Both boys are unkempt and filthy. This state parallels their environment. Photographer Shelby Lee Adams uses sharp, realistic images to portray Appalachian life. The walls literally crumble around them. The children seem accustomed to both their personal and environmental circumstances and remain oblivious to it all.

During the lull between Thanksgiving and Christmas vacations, take the time to experience this powerful and thought-provoking exhibit. Although disturbing, this exhibit nevertheless evokes a certain holiday spirit in that it forces one to appreciate the simple and familial gifts prominent at this time. The exhibit will no longer be shown when winter term is resumed in January.
