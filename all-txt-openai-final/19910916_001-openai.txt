**Formation of a New Women's Eating House Discussed**

By Tom Price

After several years of informal discussion, talk surrounding the formation of a new eating house is beginning to get serious. Last Monday, a forum was held in the Chambers Gallery to gauge the degree of interest and to discuss the process by which a new house would be formed. Approximately 75 women attended the meeting.

The forum was led by a group of students who were all supporters of the new move and represented all three female eating houses. On the panel were Jennifer Humphrey (Warner Hall), Bess Murchison (Rusk, Committee for Women’s Issues), Annie Adams (Patterson Court Council President, Rusk President), Sarah Way (Rusk), Tammy Wynn (Spencer President), and Monica Lide (Warner Hall President).

The panel discussed their reasons for supporting a fourth house and then explained the details involved in making the new house a reality. Following their initial comments, questions were fielded from the audience.

Arguments for the new house centered around overcrowding at Rusk and Warner Hall and a desire for more representation for women in the Student Government Association (SGA) and the Patterson Court Council (PCC). Annie Adams (Rusk President) commented that her house currently has over 180 members. There have been waiting lists at both Rusk and Warner Hall, and the houses are unable to accommodate any more members. Assistant Dean of Admissions Leslie Marsicano has expressed her concern that the lack of room at Rusk and Warner Hall may “threaten the self-selection system.” Annie Adams echoed this concern and believes “a fourth eating house is just assuring that women have enough choices.” The committee expressed its hopes that the numbers would “balance out” and that there would eventually be four houses of roughly the same size.

Representation is a question because each Patterson Court house is granted a representative for the SGA and the PCC. Currently, there are six male representatives from the court and only three women representatives. A fourth female house would obviously close the representation gap.

At the forum, a handout was distributed which asked two simple questions. First, “Would you consider joining a new women's eating house?” and second, “Would you be interested in helping with the organization of a new house?” If the campus response to the questions is positive, the committee hopes to create an identity for the house and make it an option during self-selection in January. The house would then become active at least socially in the spring and then begin functioning as an eating house next fall. If everything goes as planned, the new house would occupy the old Warner Hall house on Patterson Court.

Many see the move as inevitable. Dean Marsicano shares this belief and said that a fourth female eating house “will happen sooner or later.” Although some feel that this year may be too optimistic a goal for creating a new house, the growth in overall student enrollment (from 1400 to 1600 by the end of the decade) seems to indicate that another eating house will soon be formed.

Aside from the numbers, many want to see a fourth female house because of the disproportionate sizes of the three current houses. Spencer is currently much smaller than Warner Hall or Rusk. Both Warner Hall and Rusk are so large that it is becoming difficult to feed and accommodate their members. Laura Cunningham, a junior member of Rusk, said, “If you are five minutes late for dinner now, there is a good possibility that you won’t get any food. There are just so many people eating down there.”

The panel explained that at this point the committee is looking towards forming a “standard or generic house, not a special interest house.” In the past, there have been proposals for establishing a vegetarian or co-ed house. Dean Marsicano and the members of the committee believe that a “special interest house” would have less of a chance of succeeding based on past events at Davidson. If, however, a large group of people voice their interest in having some sort of specialized house, then it would be entirely possible.

Establishing a new eating house is not an easy process. The college has certain guidelines that must be met. The new house must have...

**New Recruitment Program Replaces SGA Weekend**

By Tom Koonce

In a move to involve all accepted Davidson applicants, the annual spring SGA weekend has been replaced by a new program that is as of yet unnamed. Instead of having only a select group of applicants visit campus...For a weekend as the past SGA weekends have done, this new program will attempt to bring all applicants and their parents to Davidson for a day. This will take place on the last two Saturdays in March. According to Admissions Counselor Lisa LeNard, “Everyone (accepted applicants) will be invited to two different Saturdays and will pick one to attend.” During that day, both parents and applicants will attend sessions and observe panels about life at Davidson. There will be sessions for only parents, such as talks about counseling, advising, and financial aid. Applicants will attend SGA-coordinated sessions about student activities. These will involve the Union, the Y, SSC, Patterson Court, student publications, and others. Applicants will also be able to talk with department heads and learn about Davidson academics. During the day, there will also be a talk given by the chair of the Honor Council to introduce applicants to the Honor Code.

Klein Captures CASE Award

Dr. Ben Klein, a Davidson professor of mathematics since 1971, has been selected North Carolina’s top professor by the Council for the Advancement and Support of Education in Washington, D.C. He was selected from a field of 13 nominees who represented 10 different colleges and universities. This is the second major award that Klein has earned in the past year. Last November, he was awarded the prestigious Thomas Jefferson Award for teaching at the Fall Convocation. According to Robert Williams, vice-president for academic affairs, the accolades are well deserved. Describing Klein’s professionalism, Williams said, “His class preparations are meticulous and his office door is always open to students. He is utterly conscientious and devoted to the welfare of Davidson College.” Perhaps one of the keys to Dr. Klein’s success is the enjoyment he derives from teaching math. “Teaching is even more fun now because I’ve taught most everything before and have a reasonable idea about what will work and what won’t,” he said. Klein cherishes the close contact with his students that he has at Davidson. He claims that during a typical day he usually spends more time with students in his office than he does with them in class. He explains, “I encourage students to come by whenever they want and I’m here virtually all day, from 9:30 to 6.”

The move to replace SGA Weekend with this new program is not a sudden change but one that has been in the works for the past three or four years. SGA Weekend started 15 years ago as a scholarship weekend for a small group of scholarship students. It gradually grew beyond this original intent and became too large a program to be handled on one weekend. Last year, the number of students asked to attend was cut to around 70 applicants. The problem was therefore one of fairness. The Admissions Office wanted a more fair way to invite all accepted applicants instead of just a select few. They realized that this could not be done in one weekend. The Admissions Office also wanted to better include the parents in the spring program. Admissions Counselor Barbara Bixby said, “Parents are a larger part of the decision than they used to be because of financial reasons, so they need to be more involved and well-informed.” LeNard said that a lot of schools have adopted this one-day format and most have had a positive experience in doing so. She said that the Admissions Office is discouraging hosting on this weekend without going so far as to say that applicants can’t stay on campus. On the question of why have this type of program, LeNard said, “Davidson is the right choice for most people here and this can let prospectives decide if this is the right place for them.” She said that the hope is that this day will give applicants a broad view of Davidson while also concentrating on specifics. As far as involving students, this program is a joint effort between SGA and Davidson Admissions.
