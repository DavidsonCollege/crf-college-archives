**SGA Winter Elections To Be Held This Tuesday**

Editor's note: Elections will be held next Tuesday from 8:45 a.m. to 3 p.m. The Davidsonian asked candidates to answer
three questions:
1) What specific experiences qualify you for this position?
2) What do you hope to accomplish if elected?
3) What do you consider the role of the office for which you are running?
We printed all responses.

**Duncan Fraser**

1) I have worked for The Davidsonian since last fall, primarily writing as a reporter, assistant news editor, and news
editor. I have continued writing this year and have been becoming more involved in the production end of the newspaper.
In high school, I was assistant editor of the paper and editor of the literary magazine. Finally, I am familiar
with the students of Davidson, as they are with me. I am active throughout the campus and am aware of
the opinions and perspectives many students hold. I think this breadth and diversity is the most important non-technical qualification for
editor.

2) If elected, I plan to continue improving the paper and moving it into the mainstream of Davidson. I will
broaden the staff, which is vital to the paper’s success, and continue weekly editorials. Ann and David have done a
good job and I want to continue their course, avoiding stagnation. I hope to publish a newspaper which appeals to
a wide group of people and accurately reflects Davidson College.

3) I see the Editor as one who builds, organizes, and inspires a staff, writes well-informed, thoughtful editorials, and publishes
a newspaper which informs, entertains, and represents the college community as a whole. The newspaper can be managed successfully by
one person; it has been done in the past. I have no doubt in my ability to manage a broad,
diverse staff or publish the Davidsonian as sole editor.

4) I am running for Editor because I want the paper to grow under active leadership. Many people have urged
me to run; they know me and believe the newspaper needs me. They, like most Davidson students, want a strong
paper which articulates mainstream opinions on issues ranging from women’s concerns to faculty evaluations. I believe I am more than
qualified to work toward that end.

**Y-SSC Officers**

Beth Maczka - President
Chris Blake - Vice-President
Laeta Kalogridis - Treasurer
Lisa Thomas - Secretary

Editor's Note: The Y-SSC positions are uncontested. The continuous goal of the Y-SSC is to promote more effectively service activities
in the Davidson community. We hope to establish more permanent lines of communication between the College and the town of
Davidson. Through closer ties with the community, we can better communicate its needs to the student body. In order to
better coordinate campus activities, we will establish regular communication with service coordinators from all student organizations. Furthermore, we will publish
a bi-weekly newsletter informing the campus of upcoming service projects, ongoing Y-SSC programs, and opportunities for additional projects. With these
plans in mind, the current slate of officers hopes to continue the progress made over the past year in communicating
the needs of the Davidson community. We look forward to working closely with the entire community.

**Ross Holt And David McGee**

Peggy Pierotti

Ross has served as Managing Editor of The Davidsonian since March 1983. He has complete knowledge of the production of
the paper, including layout, operation of The Davidsonian’s typesetting equipment, as well as writing and editing stories. As a member
of the paper’s Editorial Board, he has been involved in...The conceptualization of the paper since the current editorship took over.
David has worked as Assistant News Editor since September 1983, a job which has involved writing, editing, and assigning news
stories. He also held a reporting internship with The Sentinel, Winston-Salem NC’s afternoon daily. This job required him to research
and write stories and meet a daily deadline as well. The Davidsonian is currently a very strong newspaper, much stronger
than it was at this time a year ago. It has grown in influence and credibility, and if elected we
will seek to continue this growth. We will build a strong, competent, and widely representative staff, which will give us
the ability to expand and deepen our coverage of important issues. We will open wider the lines of communication between
the paper and campus organizations, to make our reporting more complete and accurate. And, we will preserve the paper’s credibility
(by ensuring its appeal to the general readership) so that the paper will stand editorially with the strength and authority
of its readership behind it. Being current members of the editorial board, we know the paper and its staff, and
feel we are more qualified to pursue these goals.

The Davidsonian holds a unique position on campus. It is a medium which reaches the entire campus each week. Because
of this, the students place a special trust in the people they choose as editors. We feel the editors have
the responsibility, then, of ensuring that the paper 1) informs the campus objectively and accurately; 2) provides a forum in
which members of the community may comment on issues of interest; 3) comments editorially in the interest of the students
who elect its editors; and 4) educates and entertains its readership by interesting and effective presentation of the first three
categories and by insightful writing, reviewing, and commentary. The editors affect this, of course, in the way they cover, select,
and edit stories, and in the design and layout of the paper. Having been closely involved with the paper and
with the editing process, we feel we can best ensure the paper’s continued growth.

Wildcat Handbook
Paul Coggins and Sarah Speed

Having worked in the Admissions Office we are interested in the ways freshmen are introduced to Davidson. As editors of
the Wildcat Handbook, we feel that we can make a positive contribution to the orientation process. The Handbook is the
freshman’s first glimpse of the faces and names that will have an impact on his next four years — hall
counselors, roommates, and (of course) future dates. We want it to be packed with information which will give freshmen tips
on all facets of Davidson life. We feel it should be clear and concise as well as a trustworthy reference.
At the same time, we want it to be just as fresh and exciting when its well-worn cover is opened
for the fiftieth time as it was when it was pulled from the mailbox.

Besides our creative impulses (Sarah is an English major with experience in writing original articles for publication), we do know
a little about putting the book together. Paul has five years of experience in editing and layout, working with such
firms as Delmar, Keys, and Josten’s. Because of our familiarity with the admissions staff and their procedures, we will be
able to work more efficiently in securing photos and information. We both think the Wildcat Handbook is an important tool
not only for freshmen, but for the entire campus community. We have many ideas of our own; we are also
eager for your input. Right now, we want you to know that we care. Dedication to this project will be
a pleasure for both of us. Please give us your support next Tuesday, and we know you'll enjoy the Handbook
next fall.
