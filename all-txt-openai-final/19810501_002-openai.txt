### Clarification

Vice President for Academic Affairs Price Zimmermann said last week about administration criteria in hiring, “You can’t make everything stand
or fall on one performance.” A typographical error in the article “Religion majors question Davidson hiring policies” changed Zimmermann’s quote
to “stand or fall on performance.”

### Energy conservation can pay off, PIRG says

By TRACY THOMPSON

The College could save nearly $4500 per year on fuel costs for perimeter housing by installing storm windows and additional
insulation, according to a NCPIRG Energy Conservation Survey of six perimeter houses. PIRG conducted the survey over the last two
months. PIRG has not yet determined how much it would cost the College to make the improvements. They plan to
submit recommendations based on a cost-benefit analysis of their findings to the Trustees at their meeting next week. PIRG project
coordinator Jeannie McIntyre asked Physical Plant Director Grover Meetze on April 20 if he thought PIRG’s estimates of savings were
too high.Meetze said the figures were reasonable. "Perimeter houses are not an economical way to go," he explained. He said
he wishes to see the cost-benefit analysis before commenting further. PIRG’s results show, for example, that installing storm windows and
insulation in Derby House could save the College $878. The gas bill for Derby House last January was $327. Housing
Director Bill Bolding was not sure if the College would act on PIRG’s recommendations. He said, "It depends on the
house. For some, it probably would not be worth the time, energy, and money, but if PIRG has some good
suggestions I’ll see what we can do to follow them and I would hope that the Administration and Trustees would
be receptive."

PIRG followed a procedure from Consumer Reports Money-Saving Guide in conducting their survey. They collected data from each house, including
floor and ceiling area, window pane and door frame perimeters, water heater insulation, and weather stripping. PIRG member freshman Chris
Gunn said, "Students were glad to show us holes in the floors and they all had stories about one room
always being too hot while another was always too cold." Senior Barb Ashley of Grey House said, "the heat is
often on in Grey House when it is sixty degrees." Another PIRG member, freshman Jim Pollard, explained that the solutions
to much of the waste are "simple little things" like weather stripping. "Air was just rushing in and out of
the houses. Weather stripping is relatively inexpensive and easy to install. It would not only save the school money but
it would make the houses more comfortable for the students to live in them."

Project coordinators McIntyre and Geoff Little initiated the survey in November when they wrote to Business Manager Bob Currie recommending
that Davidson seek to "pursue conservation-based policies if they could save the College money." Because of its size, the College
is a "major energy waster in the community," and its visibility "could help make conservation a community priority," they added.
PIRG members active in the project were McIntyre, Little, Gunn, Pollard, Drew Davis, Pete Gulyn, Robbie Singleton, and Ed Dougherty.

Rhodes receives new Freeland Professorship
By AGNES STEVENS

Religion Professor Daniel Rhodes received the new Paul Freeland professorship at the Board of Visitors meeting last week. The new
Freeland professorship is "a major endowed chair and represents a great honor," according to Vice President for Academic Affairs Price
Zimmermann. Zimmermann said the Freeland is a "floating chair" which may be given to a professor in any department. The
chair’s $500,000 endowment is now one of the restricted funds within the College’s $23 million endowment. Income from the endowment
will pay most of Rhodes’s compensation. Rhodes will not receive a salary increase.

The 1987 Program, the College’s $35 million fundraising drive, targets $6,500,000 for faculty endowments. Zimmermann said he and College President
Samuel Spencer chose to award the Freeland chair to Rhodes because he "exemplifies in an unusually strong fashion the distinguished
teaching, scholarly stature, and the intellectual and moral values for which this College stands." "I am flattered, delighted, appreciative, and
grateful to the Administration for allowing me to be the first holder of the Paul Freeland professorship," Rhodes said.

Rhodes was already the holder of a Dana professorship for Religion. Zimmermann said the Administration plans to award the Dana
professorship to another religion professor. There are five Dana professorships, one each in the history, religion, political science, music, and
philosophy departments. The College has eight endowed professorships in addition to the Freeland chair and the five Dana chairs.

The Freeland professorship was created from a bequest Dr. Paul Freeland, ’25, left to the College. His bequest was part
of the proceeds from his valuable stamp collection, which was sold soon after his death in 1976. Freeland was a
minister in the Presbyterian Church, U.S., and directed overseas relief and interchurch aid for the church’s Board of World Missions
for several years after World War II.
