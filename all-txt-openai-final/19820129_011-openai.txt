Deatithcod-

I critiqued your sunset tonight:

The oranges were nice but a little monochromatic, even imposing,

Perhaps.

That stretch of hazy, soft, blue-purple here

Was very lovely

But said with not enough commitment.

I liked the soft gold light

Peeking out of a window of Phi Hall,

Illuminating a small oasis of light

And half a pillar.

Set against the oranges on the left, the purples on the right,
And the blue to black above,

It sort of glowed and created

Unique negative space.

The Davidson skyline is just too plain—

Some clouds would have been nice.

You remember that cloud you did in Madras—
With the lightning stitching in and out and in and out?
That was, ah—

Superb.

And the buildings slightly lit beneath

Glowed eerily, warmly

Like old oil lamps and painted faces

Beneath the descending depth of blue and black.
Yes, you could have thrown in clouds, but then
I guess we've had enough of them

This week.

You don’t get clouds for nothing, right?

I'd rather it didn’t rain again anyway.

Because then there’s no sunset to critique

After Chem lab

And that’s sad.

God—

I think your palette's crazier

Where the sun is hotter.

Although I’ve never seen some crazy hues

Even above the reds and whites and grass-greens
Of this my little monastery.

Perhaps tomorrow night you—

Can add a different wash to the canvas

And maybe

Even if you don’t—

Could you keep things lit just a little

Longer?

Reading the Middle East Page

War engines can start like an ordinary lawnmower
starting up. Last summer a boy here was killed cutting grass.
But that was after a rain and in high grass;

Electrocuted, not run on gas and oil.

Or war engines can begin like feathers:

Hear the flying tigers whirr? Or sound like a cap pistol
when somebody about to be famous leans back in the
limousine

and gives up.

Or a ratchet or harness as it lifts the barrel

into heavy position

which enters the ear of a little girl examining
ribbons and medals

or a mother resting in a rocking chair.

Waiting weighs a ton

but it never started anything

until it stopped. The ticking of synchronized watches
can just mean guarded borders.

You know how winding down sounds too: patience wearing out

like old teeth.
Grandfather's uniforms leap from the closet with a clatter.
