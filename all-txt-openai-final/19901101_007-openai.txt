**Davidson In Love With Lovett**

By JEFF REVIS

He had it all. The music, the smile, the vertical hair, and a voice which pleased the faithful and converted
the dubious. Lyle Lovett gave a sterling performance to a nearly-packed Love Auditorium.

Who is Lyle Lovett? He was born and now resides in Klein, Texas, where he started his music career. After
his first attempt at forming a band in high school, Lovett went on to Texas A&M University where he graduated
with a degree in journalism.

Lovett plays to his target audience: overeducated between the ages of 25 and 40. It took many years of playing
solo in bars to develop the unique style he has today. His music is mainly of the country/folk variety with
blues and jazz interspersed to add depth. Lyle has released three albums: *Lyle Lovett* (1986), *Pontiac* (1988), and *Lyle Lovett
and His Large Band* (1989). Right now he is on a two-week tour of college campuses to promote his latest
album. Davidson was his first stop.

The concert was a good mix of older country-western Lovett with the newer, jazzier songs. Many people remarked on the
absence of the Large Band which gives Lyle a broad appeal, especially among the older members of the audience. The
more upbeat numbers like “Once Is Enough,” “What Do You Do,” the requested “She’s No Lady,” and the encore “An
Acceptable Level Of Ecstasy (The Wedding Song)” were real crowd pleasers.

The really impressive thing about the concert was that the songs had a better quality live than in the recorded
versions. Lyle Lovett and his smaller acoustic band showed a love for their music that was contagious. Every song had
a flair and polish that was spectacular. When the concert was over, everyone knew they had gotten their money’s worth,
but they were screaming for more. Lyle Lovett proved himself to be a hell of an entertainer, with an appeal
for just about everyone.

**Postcards Oozes Hollywood Sap**

By JOE MARIS

As the year rolls on, and the calendar marches closer to the next Academy Awards ceremony, one can begin to
piece together a few movies shown thus far that might have a shot at carrying home Oscars next year. *Postcards
from the Edge*, based on the life story of Carrie Fisher and directed by Mike Nichols (Best Director 1967), rises
above the other movies of 1990 for the potential of receiving the most Oscar nominations. Simply put, this movie was
made to win Oscar nominations.

Listen to the storyline: Suzanne Vale, played by Meryl Streep (Best Supporting Actress 1979, Best Actress 1982), is an actress.
She has a drug problem. One night, she almost O.D.’s, but she is brought to a hospital, and a doctor,
played by Richard Dreyfuss (Best Actor 1977), saves her. Then her mother appears. Her mother is the famous actress Doris
Mann, played by Shirley MacLaine (Best Actress 1983). Her mother is an alcoholic. But, Vale has a director friend. He
is played by Gene Hackman (Best Actor 1971). He helps her find a new lease on life. But can she
cope with her mother? Pay $5.00 and you can find out for yourself.

Obviously, this movie is saturated with some of the Academy’s favorite stars. However, just because a movie has a plethora
of award-winning stars doesn’t mean it is an award-winning picture. Don’t forget that the Academy nominated *Dead Poets Society* for
Best Picture.

The biggest problem with *Postcards from the Edge* is that it completely lacks interesting subject material. While Nichols does incorporate
some effective directing techniques to establish the various interpersonal relationships in the movie, he leaves the movie without much character
development. Most of the arguments between Vale and Mann follow this sort of pattern:

Mother: You do drugs! I had nothing, but I worked hard to ensure that you would have something. Now you
want to throw it all away!

Daughter: You are an alcoholic! Why don’t you just let me be? I am an adult now!

And so on, and so on, ad nauseam. Vale fights to distinguish movie life from real life, Mann fights old
age, and both of them fight each other. The ending of the movie attempts to show the result of Vale’s
maturation, but it is so laden with sap, that it falls flat on its face.

If one likes sappy parent-sibling rivalries based in Hollywood-esque environments, they should definitely go see this movie. If it is
comparative realism that the moviegoer seeks, they might want to look elsewhere.is after, however, he should go see Fantasia. The
colors are pretty and the characters are more real.

Missing Your Face? Without A Net The Grateful Dead Arista Record

The flies were starting to lay eggs in the still bleeding flail marks that ran the full length of my
back. My mouth was as dry as the sun that was bubbling the few sections of uncut skin left on
my body. I had been tied to the whipping post since last Monday when I wrote that sad review of
the Allman Brothers’ Seven Turns. Since then Gregg and Duane had been taking turns making me pay--ten lashes for every
sweet slide lick on Eat A Peach. I was in bad need of someone to cut me loose and spied
a friend I used to jam with. It was Chuck Wyrick and when I appealed to him for aid he
said he would send someone right away. An hour later a couple bears danced up to me but much to
my dismay their lack of opposing thumbs rendered them unable to grip the wire cutters they had brought to free
me with. They danced away and an endless ten minutes later up walks Jerry Garcia with four guys and a
ghost. “The Candyman’s in town,” he said. “Oh Lord,” I whimpered, “I feel like I’m dying.” Without A Net was
just in time. All tracks are recorded live at various shows between October 1989 and April 1990. There are fourteen
of them and they all show, in case you didn’t know, that the Dead can still do their stuff. The
two-disk set is divided into first and second sets with seven songs in each. They are even in a feasible
order for a live show. The first set is solid but overshadowed by its roommate in the trippy cardboard abode,
set two. First set’s “Mississippi Half Step Uptown (Out-of-Town) Toodeloo” follows a crisp “Feel Like A Stranger,” but is missing
the extended “Lazy River” section which is usually the best part. [It never has worked without Donna (Godchaux) anyway.] The
crispness of these two tunes is indicative of the rest of the album which is conspicuously devoid of space. “Althea”
gets a special Ed Thiedeman endorsement and the Thiedeman thumb is up for the rest of the album as well.
The second set I love. It begins with a bouncy “China Cat Sunflower” that is really playful but a little
fast to allow the transition into “I Know You Rider” to be smooth. Phil saves this one from drummers Bill
Kreutzmann and Mickey Hart (whose fingers must have been tired from writing his first book, Drumming On the Edge of
Magic) but he still doesn’t get to sing. Speaking of singing, I hate to talk dirt on the dead (meaning
actual deceased people) but “Rider” would have been much better off without Brent chiming in. If he would have just
played it would have been O.K. but when he opens his mouth you can’t hear anyone else. All I can
think about when I hear his voice is his pride and joy, “I Will Take You Home,” also known as,
“I Will Ruin Your Show.” By any name, it was, and is, a buzz-kill. I am told that there are
three factors by which you judge any “Looks Like Rain.” The first is

Interpreting food labels can be frustrating and confusing, if you don’t know what to focus on. Incomplete and even misleading
labeling can be found. Fortunately, legislation is pending to improve nutrition information on food labels. Until then, follow these guidelines:

Ingredients are listed in order of amounts present by weight in food from most to least. Pay attention to the
first three ingredients. If you are trying to limit fat or sodium (Na), and either is present in the first
three ingredients, look for more specific information on the label. You may want to avoid the product.

Serving size may be misleading. For example, some cereals list the serving size as 1/4 cup—much less than normally consumed.
Note the serving size first.

Fat is one of the most important ingredients to evaluate in both quality and quantity. Desirable fats (low in saturated
fat) include safflower, soybean, sunflower, cottonseed, corn, canola, olive, and peanut oil. Less desirable fats include lard, palm, and coconut
oil, butter, shortening, and hydrogenated oils (partially hydrogenated soybean oil is okay). Generally, food other than meat, cheese, and fats
should contain no more than five grams of fat per serving. Choose meat, cheese, and fat products with comparatively low
fat contents.

Sodium content per serving should be 400 milligrams or less. Beware of “words” with no standard legal definition such as
“light,” “natural,” or “health.” Read the label further. Think twice about label health claims. “No cholesterol” on vegetable oils, margarine,
and peanut butter should be no surprise as cholesterol comes only from foods of animal origin.
