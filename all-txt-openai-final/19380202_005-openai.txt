Chubby King Swings For President’s Ball
Music for the Ball, held Monday, January 31, was furnished by Chubby King and his popular orchestra. The annual President's Ball in Lincolnton was sponsored by G. M. Nicholson, a prominent attorney.

Any of you guys who've seen the picture of Bunny Berigan’s torch singer in the window of the College Pharmacy know that the fellow’s really got something there. The name's Gail Reese and, what's more, she passed the New York City mark just last November.

John Dees, varsity cheerleader in 1935, is now studying in Setif, Algeria and recently wrote an interesting article to the Greensboros News in which he vividly described Ramadhan, a month of fasting and worship of the Mohammedan. Joe describes the customs that must be observed during Ramadhan, such as fasting from sunrise to sunset and refraining from certain activities.

King stated that he used the same band for this occasion that he used all last summer at the Mayview Manor. The band, which contains 15 pieces, includes several artists from different parts of the south. Before going to Lincolnton, the members of the band gathered in the College Inn and rendered several “swing” numbers, which was witnessed by many college students.

Currie Will Speak To Charlotte Club
The club met at the home of Mr. John Hill. At this time, the college has scheduled several prominent speakers for the February Vesper program, including Rev. Frank C. Brown, D.D., of the Oakland Presbyterian Church, and Rev. J. A. Redhead, D.D., pastor of the Second Presbyterian Church.

In the summer, the orchestra performed so well that he took her along with his orchestra on a tour of one-night stands, one of which was at the University of North Carolina. Some time afterwards, she joined Carl Ravell and his orchestra, who at that time was playing at the Book Cadillac Hotel in Detroit. And now Gail's with Bunny Berigan, headed this way, and picking up popularity every minute. Come on, gal, the sooner the better!

For all “youse” embryo Fred Astaires and Arthur Murrays who want to shine at Mid-winters, the Alliance Francaise has announced that $1,000 in prizes will be awarded for student composition. The contest is open to American students.
