A Survey about the Campus Computer

Have you used the college’s computer this year? If so, what for? Are you aware of the things it can
do, such as paper, letter, and lab-report typing as well as programming in several languages? These are just a few
of the questions that came up at a meeting last week in which several students discussed the computing services currently
available to them. The meeting was called in an attempt to bring to the surface ideas, suggestions, and criticisms that
students have about the college’s new computer system. Most of the criticisms came in the form of requests that terminal
room hours be extended at night and on weekends, and the system was praised for its word-processing capabilities. It was
pointed out that the Computer Center staff needs to know more about how the average Davidson student feels about the
computer in order to work towards providing better services.

The questionnaire here is being distributed this week in an effort to determine the general campus attitude toward the Computer
Center and its facilities. It was drawn up by the students who met last week, and every student is requested
to complete one. There will be envelopes on each dorm hall as well as in each eating house/fraternity, in the
Union, the Commons, and the terminal rooms. In addition to the copies that will be distributed to each room on
campus, you may use the copy provided here. We ask that every student, whether he or she uses the computer
or not, please fill one out and return it to one of the collection envelopes by Friday, May 7. The
results of the survey will provide the Computer Center with an up-to-date idea of what the campus attitude toward the
computer is, helping them better serve the needs of everyone.
