**Alumnus to be new Dean of Admissions**

**By HEIDI HOOKER**

College President John Kuykendall announced last Friday that James P. Hendrix, Jr., headmaster of Greensboro Day School, has been named
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid.

Hendrix, 44, of Greensboro, will begin his duties July 1, 1986. He replaces John Griffith, who became Vice President for
Development this fall after serving as Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid since 1979.

“Jim Hendrix’s decision to join us is a source of genuine delight,” Kuykendall said. “He knows the admissions picture from
a very helpful vantage. He will bring remarkable personal and professional strength to an area of Davidson’s activity of which
we are already especially proud.”

Hendrix has been headmaster of Greensboro Day School since 1977. He previously served as academic dean at Greenhill School in
Dallas, Texas, from 1976-77; head of the department of history and social studies at Greenhill from 1973-76; and as associate
professor of history at Western Carolina from 1971-73.

Hendrix earned an A.B. degree in history from Davidson in 1963, an M.A. from Louisiana State University in 1968, and
a Ph.D. from Louisiana State in 1973.

He has chaired two accreditation committees of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and has served as chairman of
the North Carolina Association of Independent Schools. He has also served on the governor's Advisory Council on Non-Public Education and
on the Board of Trustees of St. Andrews College.

Mathematics Professor L.R. King chaired the search committee which selected Hendrix. Psychology Professor Ruth Ault, Director of Alumni Relations Jamie
May, Administrative Intern Hunter Roddey, and Dana Lemon also served on the committee. The search began shortly after May 15,
1985, when the position opening was announced in The Chronicle of Higher Education.

King emphasized the many benefits that Hendrix brings to this position. He commented that “Hendrix’s leadership in secondary level education
is recognized both state-wide and beyond. The Greensboro Day School flowered under his leadership, and he has guided the school
to a position of prominence among independent schools state-wide. We're very lucky to have him.” King added that Hendrix is
committed to the liberal arts and is a person of the “highest integrity.”

Hendrix is committed to Davidson College as a “faithful alumnus,” King said. He has been involved with the Davidson Alumni
Admissions Program, which provides alumni chapters that work with prospective students.

Associate Dean of Admissions Gardner Roller Ligo and Associate Dean of Financial Aid Kathleen Stevenson are currently acting as directors
of the office. Stevenson expressed the staff's sincere delight with the addition of Hendrix to the office.

Hendrix is a native of Durham, N.C. At Davidson, he held several positions and played an active role in student
life. He was the second vice president of Scabbard and Blade (an honorary military society). He was a member of
the Beaver Club, the Philanthropic Literary Society, and the Young Republican's Club. He participated in freshman basketball and track.

**Woods reviews “Purpose”**

**By DAVID BEARCE**

Dr. Roger Woods met with Davidson College’s Strategic Planning Committee last week to discuss “what it means to be Presbyterian”
for Presbyterian-related schools.

Woods also addressed a group in the 900 Room this past Wednesday on whether or not the college’s Statement of
Purpose is outdated.

In the committee meeting, Woods said Davidson is now in a “transition period” as it assumes a closer relationship with
the Presbyterian Church. Such a transition requires “open and vocal dialogue” and “more church figures in college leadership positions.”

The greatest problem, Woods said, concerns “the clarity” of the Statement of Purpose. He said that there are “a lot
of things mixed up together, all in the same paragraph.” A clear Statement of Purpose is essential because it “allows
institutions to focus in on their priorities.”

“Colleges without a Statement of Purpose try to become all things to all people,” Woods added.

For the past three-and-a-half years, Woods has been Associate for Higher Education, assigned to work with Presbyterian-related schools on their
role with the church.

“The Presbyterian Church does not own its colleges,” he said. Instead, these institutions are “independent colleges funded by Presbyterians.”

Woods said the relationship between the Presbyterian Church and these colleges became “strained” during the 1960s, and the two groups
are now in the process of moving closer together.

He described two factors that played a part in the strained relationship. First, the colleges needed federal assistance during this
time, and they “incorrectly thought” that a looser relationship with the Presbyterian Church would lead to more federal money.

Secondly, the Presbyterian Church was willing to develop a less formal relationship with the colleges because it would thus have
to invest less money into its affiliated schools.

Following his presentation on Wednesday, he opened discussion to the audience. Faculty and students expressed the belief that Davidson's Statement
of Purpose was deeply entrenched in the tradition of the college, and some felt any change would be very slow
and difficult.

Woods was pleased with his visit and reported that Davidson is an “excellent academic institution and always has been. The
students confirm that Davidson has a good faculty.”

As a result of this visit, Woods hopes to learn from the “healthy institutions,” like Davidson, in order to help
some of the “unhealthy Presbyterian-related colleges.”

This year Woods has also visited Rhodes College in Memphis, TN, and next plans to visit Presbyterian College in Clinton,
S.C.
