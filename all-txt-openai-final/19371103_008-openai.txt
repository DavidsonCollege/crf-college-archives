Students Turn Out For “Greatest Show On Earth”

MELODY-MAKERS Spectators Are Thrilled Over ‘CATS TOPPLE FURMAN and Over Again By Glorious Spectacle

Furman warily done in: On the fourth P. T. Barnum lives again! The show that Mighty Barnum began many years ago is truly “The Greatest Show on Earth.” The thousands that filled the tent at the two performances in Charlotte on Friday left with minds incapable of remembering what actually had taken place in the seven rings under the largest canvas top in the world.

On the next ball, it was kicked to Davidson. The ball fell on the fingers of two players, rolled, and Davidson fell on it.

Thrilling Spectacle

FALL ISSUE OF JOURNAL (Continued from Page 1)

There are individual pictures of each player and a larger picture of the whole football team. Several other features of interest concerning alumni, faculty members, and present students help to make the Fall issue of the Alumni Journal one of its best issues.

A pretense of indifference to success is usually an attempt to disguise a sense of failure. A mink coat is a “good hedge against inflation,” and it might please your wife. Except for a few who should be locked up, we have concluded that other people are just as moral as we are. A cold plunge is different from a hot one in that you get out faster than you went in, and feel better for the experience. Distinguished men are hard to find in a crowd because they usually look so undistinguished. Everything’s changed except the weather.
