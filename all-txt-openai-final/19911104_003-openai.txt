THE DAVIDSONIAN MONDAY, NOVEMBER 4, 1991

Convocation Continued from page 1

Professor of Economics Clark Ross was the recipient of the Thomas Jefferson award for this year. Williams also announced the
formation of the Richard R. Bernard Society of Mathematics. Twenty-seven students were inducted into this new honorary society that is
intended to bestow a special honor on departmental majors and others with interest and outstanding ability in mathematics. This new
society will also bring a prominent science and mathematics authority to campus for an annual lecture.

In an address entitled “In Partnership With Tomorrow’s Leaders,” Mebane Pritchett spoke to the class of 1992 about their education
and their future, during this past Saturday’s Fall Convocation. Pritchett is the president of the Coca-Cola Scholars Foundation of Atlanta
and the father of a Davidson senior. The Coca-Cola Foundation provides merit aid to students nationwide through a scholarship competition
that is based on merit, character, and background. In 1989, the Foundation received 50,000 applications for these scholarships after anticipating
only 20,000. Pritchett believes that this year the number of applicants will be close to 100,000. Out of all of
these applications, only 150 scholarships are awarded.

Pritchett stressed the value of a Davidson education in his address and he pointed out the “importance and great quality
of Davidson professors.” He said, “I believe that Davidson has repeatedly challenged you (Davidson seniors) and you have repeatedly met
that challenge.” Pritchett spoke about the Coca-Cola Foundation and its dedication to education. Pritchett said that his association with the
Foundation has been a very learning experience for him. He said, “The same qualities nurtured at Davidson are honored by
the Coca-Cola Foundation.”

Pritchett emphasized the importance of Davidson students becoming leaders in society. “Wherever you go, because of where you’ve been, you
must choose to be a leader. I’m talking about being a leader in your community and in your workplace,” said
Pritchett. Pritchett commented on how a Davidson education will set Davidson students apart from most. Pritchett said, “Your education is
on par with the best. It provides you with the most single important tool you’ll acquire.” He went on to
say that the problems in today’s society demand the leadership of Davidson students.

The Atlanta Project, a program originated by former President Jimmy Carter to help solve problems of the urban poor, was
also brought up by Pritchett during his address. Pritchett said that Carter feels that “he must try” to raise Americans’
conscious level and increase awareness of the homeless problem. Pritchett quoted Carter when he said, “The failure is if we
do not try.” Since Davidson students have been blessed with opportunities that others haven’t had, Pritchett noted, they must maintain
a sense of responsibility for others. He said, “Make the best of your life and put it to optimal use.”

Pritchett also did not fail to mention Davidson students’ parents and talked about how parents have shared in the Davidson
experience and will be grateful to the college for launching their children into a happy and successful life. In closing
out his address, Pritchett mentioned the book “Oh, the Places You'll Go” by the late Dr. Seuss. He commented on
how this book has special relevance to graduates. He then said, “Oh the places you’ll go,” and added to the
title by saying, “...and the things you’ll do.” Pritchett then congratulated the seniors and wished them good luck in their
future.

...that it will be the beneficiary of the offering at the Christmas Vespers service. Adams said that work was nearing
completion and although he is not sure how much more renovation...will be necessary. The community believes the work will continue
in the Commons and in private homes into November. Adams encourages student involvement and said, “This is a great opportunity
for Davidson College students to play an active role in the town community of Davidson.” Anyone interested in helping with
the center should contact Adams, Patton, or Brenda Tapia.

The center has received support from many organizations on campus. In another show of support, the center has recently learned...

A durable power of attorney, someone who will make the decisions on medical care when incompetency arises, to decide if
he wants to “pull the plug.” Also, Professor Stell explained that the Act prohibits any facility from discriminating against patients
with living wills or durable powers of attorney. It also prohibits facilities from pressuring patients into making out living wills
or assigning durable powers of attorney.
