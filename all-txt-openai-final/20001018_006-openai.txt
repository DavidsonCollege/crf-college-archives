Al Gore’s tax cuts are meant for and are dedicated to hard-working middle-class families, who are virtually ignored by Governor Bush. Not only has the current administration balanced the budget, but together Clinton and Gore have turned record deficits established by previous Republican administrations into record surpluses. The facts speak for themselves. Al Gore will continue building our nation’s prosperity by focusing on those who have contributed the most to our booming economy, the middle class.

Specifically, Al Gore’s plan calls for more than $500 billion in tax cuts for working families. “The right kind of tax cuts are good for our economy,” says Gore, “they help families go to college and build new skills; they help people save for retirement” (www.algore.com). Included within Gore’s tax plan is:

1. Eliminating the marriage penalty for working families, so that a married couple would get the same standard tax deduction as if they remained single. Middle-class families would especially benefit because it would raise the standard deduction to twice that of a single person.
2. Making healthcare more affordable by proposing a 25% tax credit for health insurance premium costs for each employee of a small business that decides to join an insurance purchasing coalition. Gore also proposes providing a 25% refundable tax credit for individuals who do not have access to employer-based health insurance.
3. Increasing the amount in child care expenses that could be claimed as tax deductions by middle-class families. He would also provide tax relief for parents who stay at home to care for their children.
4. Providing Americans with needs for long-term care and their caregivers a $3000 tax credit, which would help about 2 million more Americans.
5. Gore’s college opportunity tax cut plan would make up to $10,000 in college tuition costs tax-deductible. He also proposes creating 401(j) accounts, which would allow families and employers to put money away to save for education and training tax-free.

Not only will Al Gore’s targeted tax cuts strengthen social security, protect Medicare, and annually help pay off the national debt, but his plan will fit within a balanced budget. This is in contrast to George W. Bush’s agenda, which would exceed the budget surplus by $1.1 trillion, restoring a damaging deficit and plunging our economy into instability (except of course for the wealthiest 1%).

Federal taxes are the highest they have ever been during peacetime. In fact, the typical family now pays nearly 40% of their income in federal, state, and local taxes—more than twice the rate paid by the typical family in 1955. To put this disheartening reality into perspective, on average Americans work more than four months a year to pay their taxes. Though these high rates may be normal for the rest of the world, especially our friends in Europe, when was the last time the United States ever looked to the French as an example of anything good?

The massive size and scope of government that these oppressive tax bills have created would be anathema to our nation’s founding fathers. They are equally unacceptable to Governor George W. Bush, and when he becomes our nation’s 43rd president he will not allow it to continue. In light of the great economic prosperity that Americans have enjoyed during the past few years, the government now takes in more money each year in taxes than it pays out in spending. As a result, Governor Bush believes it is appropriate to return some of the excess funds to the Americans whose hard work created the surplus in the first place.

But lest you be fooled by Al Gore’s description of the Bush tax plan as “risky,” consider a fact: only one quarter of the surplus will be...Devoted to tax cuts, Bush’s tax plan still reserves all Social Security funds to be used only for Social Security and leaves extra money for important initiatives such as education, defense, debt reduction, and other vital needs. Of all the words that could describe Bush’s tax plan, “risky” seems childishly inappropriate. The need for tax cuts stems from George W. Bush’s philosophical understanding that individual Americans are much more capable of spending money for their own specific needs than the federal government could ever hope to be. The issue of taxes illustrates perhaps more clearly than any other that Governor Bush trusts people to make decisions, while Al Gore trusts the federal government. Every family has different needs: some need to buy more medication, some need to save more for the golden years of retirement, some want to buy more toys for their children. The only way to help all families is to allow them the freedom to make personal decisions about how their money should be spent. It is, after all, their money. Washington cannot do that effectively, and Americans deserve broad tax cuts so politicians won’t even be tempted to try.

The cornerstone of Bush’s plan is to cut marginal income tax rates across the board to ensure that every American receives tax cuts. The top rate will be capped at 33%, down from 39.6%; the 31% and 28% rates faced today by the middle class will be reduced to 25%; and the lowest rate will be cut from 15% down to 10%. Alan Greenspan concurs with Bush’s plan to reduce marginal rates, saying, “tax reductions can offer favorable incentives for economic performance, especially if designed to lower marginal rates.” In light of that advice, one wonders why Al Gore offers only limited, targeted tax cuts that will leave 50 million Americans without any tax relief at all.

In addition to the rate cuts, Bush’s plan also doubles the child tax credit, reduces the marriage penalty, eliminates the death tax, extends the deductible for charitable giving, raises the cap on corporate giving, and increases the annual contribution limit on Educational Savings Accounts from $500 to $5,000. Bush’s plan offers broad-based, real tax relief for all Americans.

During the first debate, between his immature sighing and interruptions of Bush and the moderator, Al Gore kept repeating his class-warfare rhetoric that Bush’s tax plan is merely for the rich. Gore is no doubt getting used to having actual facts fly in the face of his assertions, and here is yet another example. For starters, Bush’s tax proposal removes six million low- and moderate-income families from the income tax rolls altogether. Further, the Bush plan reduces the income tax rate by over 40% for millions of low-income families. What relief the wealthy do receive is simply a product of the steeply progressive tax code. Today, the top 1% of earners (a group that includes people making $250,000 a year and up) pay 33% of all income taxes. Despite that enormous burden, Bush’s tax plan devotes no more than 20% of the benefits to these Americans. As evinced by his generous tax cuts for low-income families, even though the bottom 50% of earners pay just 4% of all income taxes, George W. Bush is committed to tax relief for all Americans, not only the rich.

Even more, however, historical experience demonstrates that the surest way to shift the tax burden from low-income Americans to the wealthiest ones is to cut marginal rates across the board. When John F. Kennedy cut the top rate by 21 points during the 1960s, the top earners’ share of the tax burden increased from 11.6% to 15.1%. Again, after the Reagan tax cuts, the contribution to total tax revenue of the wealthiest Americans jumped from 18% to 28%. As Governor Bush and Alan Greenspan understand, this phenomenon occurs because lower marginal rates stimulate productivity and growth, expanding economic opportunity for everyone, as well as simultaneously increasing federal tax revenues.

Governor Bush understands that providing much-needed tax relief to spur continued economic growth and empowering American families to make personal choices about how to live their own lives is responsible policy for the nation. What is certain is that the country does not need a proliferation of government programs or new spending initiatives that will only burden the economy when the surpluses run dry. Somebody better tell Mr. Gore.
