**Rugby Takes Duke in Incredibly Easy Fashion**

It was a cold and muddy day on the Upper IMAC fields, and a miserable one for the Duke Blue Devils as the Davidson College Rugby team put the pitchfork in the Devils with a final score of 20-1. The game began with Duke moving deftly to the try zone, only to be stopped dead in their tracks by the Wildcats who took that threat as a challenge and never looked back. A few minutes later, George Williams made a brilliant run, set up perfectly by Kelly Shirley, to the try zone. Davidson continued to dominate in all aspects of play. The most amazing play of the day came from Tom Shelburne when he single-handedly blocked a Duke punt, scooping it up and carrying it 20 meters for the second try of the day. Jamie Brown converted both tries and added two penalty kicks, thus claiming half of Davidson’s points.

The Davidson team has finally recovered from the crippling illness and injuries which have affected play all semester. With this game, the Wildcats have shown that they are still one of the leading teams in North Carolina Rugby and that even the ACC teams are really no match for their talent. The entire team played an amazing game, rucking hard and winning almost every scrum down. The back line ran very well, but more noticeably, their defensive play was unerring, holding the Duke team on several goal line stands. The team as a whole allowed only one try by Duke, and it occurred late in the second half.

Although every individual played extremely well, several deserve honorable mention. Bob Yarbrough played dauntlessly in his first game ever at the scrum half position. The team expects him to become one of the best scrum halves in the state. Kelly Shirley performed flawlessly at fullback, a position in which he is very inexperienced. Billy Hendrix ran and tackled beautifully in his role as wing. Also in the backfield, Edwin Thomas saved a Duke try by himself. Jamie Brown and Tag Kleiner also played extremely well in the defensive backfield. The scrum, as usual, was invincible, led by the experience, size, and strength of David Rozelle, Patrick Malcor, Tom Shelburne, Scotch Turner, Rafael Candelario, Wyatt Lilly, and “Menacing Mike” Kessler. Chance Reynolds and Philip Parks played brilliantly, in spite of the fact that they are relatively new to the game. Dave Harding, in his final game ever at Davidson College, played, as always, with more intensity than is humanly possible. He will be missed greatly by the team.

After the first game, Duke wanted to try again, so there was a full-scale B-side game. Here again Davidson showed no mercy, mashing and rolling over the Devils to a 17-7 victory. Rafael Candelario continued his excellent line-out jumping and added a try to his stats. Doctor Coppola set...

**Walk-on Alpert Making Great Strides at Point Guard**

By Bob Pascal

What 5' 11" Long Island native is making serious waves in the Southern Conference this year? His name is Chris Alpert and he is Coach McKillop’s choice for starting point guard. Alpert has worked hard to get where he is and it has not come easy. Recently, I sat down with him and discussed his basketball origins and how this year has gone on and off the court. In referring to his first start as a freshman walk-on on a Division I squad: “I was a little nervous... but once you get out there you forget about everything else.” Davidson’s opponents, however, will have a tough time forgetting about Alpert, as he continues to improve every time he takes the court.

Alpert comes to us by way of Chaminade, the same high school that graduated Coach Bob McKillop, and Mount Hermon Prep where Alpert’s post-graduate team went undefeated and seven of his teammates are now also playing college basketball. At Davidson, he has had to adapt to a new world. Basketball in high school is one thing and in college quite another. I asked him about the transition between the two: “At prep school it was very easy... the games were easy, we won every game by at least twenty points and I wound up playing only half a game. This has been my most challenging year, going through a college schedule—twenty-five to thirty games, night in and night out playing guys that are probably better than you, it’s a struggle every time we go out, as it is for both teams.”

Alpert also had to adapt to a completely new set of teammates, but he says that the responsiveness of the players and coaches and the fact that they do not treat him or Tim Caldwell any differently as walk-ons, “has made me feel real comfortable and the adjustment much easier.” Amazingly enough, Alpert is...One of only two walk-ons in Division I basketball to be starting, an even more impressive feat when one considers that Alpert is only a freshman. He clearly has an incredibly positive feeling about his teammates and coaches. Alpert describes the team as a close-knit group of individuals brought together through shared good times and bad. When asked how he felt about the coaching staff he replied: “I love the coaches very much, and I respect them all, especially Coach McKillop. He is a great coach as well as a really great guy and I really enjoy playing for him.” Alpert has been very excited with the team’s play this year. He stated, “a nice mix of veterans and freshmen has put together a nice season.” Alpert feels that a Southern Conference win and a bid to the See "Alpert" on page 15.

Men's Hoops Upsets ETSU; Clinches Fifth

What a difference a day makes. The Davidson basketball team rebounded last Sunday from perhaps its most trying loss of the season, a 79-76 decision at the hands of Appalachian State the day before, by whipping second-place East Tennessee State 90-75 at Belk Arena. It was the final home game for Wildcat seniors Detlef Musch, J.D. Heuer, and Matt Matheny, all of whom started the game, so it was only fitting that one of them set the tone for the afternoon. It turned out to be Musch. He scored on a dunk and a hook shot to give Davidson a 4-2 lead, and after that the ‘Cats never trailed. But it was just the start of a twenty-minute frenzy for Musch, who scored 18 points in the first half, and finished with 19. With 4:13 left in the half, he took a pass from Jason Zimmerman and finished the fast break with a one-handed jam to make it 43-29. Davidson led 47-37 at the half.

The Bucs made their run midway through the second half, cutting a 16-point deficit to nine with a 10-3 run. Jason Niblett’s three-pointer with 11:24 left made it 61-52. But Jeff Anderson’s baseline drive for a layup started Davidson’s response, and once initiated it was swift and final. Heuer’s three-pointer with 5:06 left capped a 17-4 run that gave the Wildcats their largest lead at 78-56. McKillop commented on the team's ability to bounce back. “I’m just delighted with the character our kids showed today,” he said. “It was an emotional loss, a draining loss [against Appalachian], and the way we played start to finish today is a real statement of the character that has evolved on this basketball team.”

On Saturday afternoon in Huntington, WV, Davidson clinched at least a tie for fifth place in the conference with a 63-57 win over Marshall. It was the Wildcats' first road win since January 6 and the Thundering Herd's first loss in 12 home games this year. Davidson took a 30-28 lead at halftime on Zimmerman’s three-point play with 33 seconds to play. The points put Zimmerman over the 1000-point mark for his career. The ‘Cats opened the second half with a quick run. A screen broke Alpert free for a lay-up on the inbounds play to start the half and Musch and Narat scored to make it 36-28 with 18:33 left. Davidson won led with 15:01 left. But Marshall came back, and was ready to bust down the door, down just 51-49 when Zimmerman won the game with his defense. On consecutive possessions near the six-minute mark, he stopped Marshall fast breaks by drawing a charge. Musch, who finished with 24, then scored six straight to put the Wildcats clear. Said Zimmerman, “You could see they didn’t have any intention to pass the ball. It wasn’t a thing I even thought about. I just stepped in front.” Musch added, “It’s just coming together for us.”

Sunday afternoon in Lexington, VA, Davidson used foul shooting and big games from Musch and Zimmerman to beat VMI, 84-70. Davidson led only 74-70 with 2:18, but on the next possession, Musch twice rebounded his own misses and scored to make it 76-70. Zimmerman followed with four free throws, and Quinn Harwood made two to put the game out of reach. Musch scored a career-high 30 points, and Zimmerman added 21 for the Wildcats.
