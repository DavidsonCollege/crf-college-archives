“Bottle Testers” Winners Of College Trustees Aid In Legal Cases | Art Exhibit Authorize Library

Gordon Horton Places First And Second; Sam Ryburn Takes Third

Professors Have Made Extensive Research For Past Two Years

Gordon Horton, member of the freshman class, has been acclaimed by 34 votes as the winner of first place in
the Student Art Exhibit, sponsored last week by The Davidsonian. Horton's picture, a pencil sketch entitled “A Lady,” received 34
votes. Second place went to Horton's other sketch, which received 25 votes. Sam Ryburn’s airbrush painting, “Peasant Girl,” was third.

This art exhibit was the first ever to be held on the campus and attracted wide interest throughout the faculty
and student body. The keen enthusiasm by the visitors to the exhibit pointed to the fact that there is a
vital need for more art on the campus. The Davidsonian intends to make this exhibit an annual affair with the
hope of increasing this enthusiasm in art.

REPORT OF FUND GIVEN

Davidson's entire group of forty-nine trustees met on last Wednesday, Feb. 16, at which time discussions and recommendations of various
committees were heard. The buildings and grounds committee of the trustees, in conference with the buildings and grounds committee of
the faculty, was authorized to have plans and specifications for a new library prepared in order to be ready to
proceed with erection as soon as sufficient funds are in hand. The committee was also authorized to have general plans
for a science building prepared.

Centennial Report Heard

The Centennial Committee reported that from May 1, 1937, till February 1, 1938, a sum of $175,000 had been subscribed
to the Centennial Fund, including $75,000 spent for the new science hall. Of the funds subscribed, there are $150,000 undesignated,
but not until these have been collected can we proceed with the erection of the proposed new library.

Sabbatical Year For Faculty Will Be Studied

A special committee was appointed to study the question of granting to our professors a sabbatical year every seven years,
to be used in research, writing, or some other form of rest which will prepare them the better for their
work.

Winter Will Address IRC on Present World Situation

Mr. William Winter, popular news commentator of station WBT, will address the International Relations Club on Friday night. His talk
is expected to draw a large audience.

Mr. Winter began his talk by bringing forth the question, “Due to the fact that the world is in such
a turmoil today, will the United States be dragged into war?” The commentator explained that the root of war could
be traced back to the Industrial Revolution. The result of this period was that a chasm was created between the
employee, the employer, and the customer. Each side was seeking to gain more power than the other, and the balance
between these factions was broken.

The fact that the Nazi and Fascist parties were a menace to world peace was emphasized by the speaker. He
pointed out that these parties were breeding circumstances that will lead to war.

Dictators Contrasted

The birth of both Nazism and Fascism was related by the speaker, and he contrasted the two great leaders of
the two factions, Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. He stated that Hitler was an emotionalist and a dreamer, while Mussolini
was an opportunist. He believed that Hitler was sincere in all his policies and that he was wrapped up in
Germany; it was his one idea and that his persecutions of the Jews and Christians were because they brought about
turmoil in his Fatherland and he felt that he was justified in his doings. Mussolini, on the other hand, was
an egotist and seized his opportunities such as during the World War, and recently in Ethiopia and Spain.

Faculty Does Not Favor Change in Schedule

“There is not much possibility of changing the present schedule,” said Dr. Walter L. Lingle, president of Davidson College, when
asked for a statement concerning the proposal to eliminate Saturday classes which is now under the consideration of the faculty.
During the last month, members of the faculty have suggested a number of plans for the arrangement of schedules which
would virtually bring an end to Saturday classes. The combined sentiment of the faculty and administration seems to oppose the
change.

Four Are Promoted In R.O.T.C. Department

Promotions were made known at the scheduled parade last Wednesday, as M. L. Lafferty and three others were promoted. The
promotions are as follows: Mr. J. A. McGeachy elected to be Lieut. Col. and Battalion Commander, Cadet Major Martin to
be Major and Battalion Executive, Cadet Captain Fred Smith to be Major, and Cadet Captain Bob Miller to be Captain.

LeGette Blythe to Address News Class Tonight
