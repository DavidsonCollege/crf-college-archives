Color Key: Love is Blue

Harmonious with yellow
making green

or violet with red,
electrifying orange

and making peace with white
it is a self-contained definition,
encompassing a clearness in the sky

on a late September day
tangible opacity in the air
at midnight

Wedgewood and della Robbia sky
- your bedroom wall:
and my kitchen dishes.

Touching and transforming:

a unifying of distinctions,
a color key to the faces

that laugh and cry,

all the same in their uniqueness.

A Continental Lunch

I jam it through the door

study up straight and SMASH,
swing through singing my meat,
pausing to flick off
thrumming shards from the frame.

I go in, shout & beat my drums,
walk slowing up the river.

I continue and there she is,

or there you are, or she, or

whoever you are, or whoever she is.

We approach from opposite shores,
throw our roots

to a hard junction over the river.
Solemnly we look at one another
across a mile of flow.

We bow formally and withdraw.

(Across a rivermile we sidle each other
from eyecorners, looking to the next page)
