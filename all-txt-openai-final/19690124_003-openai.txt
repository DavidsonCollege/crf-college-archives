I OPPOSE:

1. BOB DAVIDSONIAN AND ITS BIASED OPINIONS ABOUT THE FRATERNITIES, FACULTY, AND ITS GENERAL NEGATIVE ATTITUDE TOWARDS JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING;
2. Tom Scott;
3. THOSE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THAT ALL STUDENTS ARE SOCIALLY EQUALâ€”SOME GUYS ARE SLICK, DATE A LOT, AND LIKE TO PARTY, AND THE REST ARE INDEPENDENTS. THE SYSTEM IS CONSISTENT;
4. STUDENT GOVERNMENT AND ITS PRESUMPTUOUS INACTIVITY;
5. MARVIN SHANKLIN AND COHORTS (DAVIDSON'S ANSWER TO "DANNY THE RED");
6. ALL CANDIDATES FOR EVERY OFFICE, THEY'RE AWFUL! ESPECIALLY SHORT, SICKLY INDEPENDENTS, OVERBASE MARINES, AND INSIGNIFICANT KA'S;
7. NERDS AND GNOMES, THE GUYS WHO FAIL TO COMMUNICATE EFFECTIVELY WITH OTHER HUMAN BEINGS;
8. THOSE GUYS WHO CAN CUT HALF THEIR CLASSES, DIVE HALF OF THEIR REVIEWS, GO OUT SIX NIGHTS A WEEK, AND COME OUT WITH A ROCK AND A BALL;
9. EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM AND OUTSIDE STRUCTURED STUDENT ACTIVITY, I.E., THE CULTURAL, SOCIAL, AND THE IMMORAL;
10. COMPULSORY VESPERS TWICE A WEEK;
11. ANTI-SEMITISM.

IN SUMMARY: I FEEL THAT I CAN RUN THE STUDENT GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION FROM BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA AS WELL AS ANYBODY ELSE CAN RUN IT FROM DAVIDSON COLLEGE.

Sincerely,

Platform of a last-minute write-in candidate.
