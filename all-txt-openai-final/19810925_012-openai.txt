**Davidson soccer team takes three in a row**

by Mark Elmore ’82

First of all, I would like everyone to know that I stand corrected. The last soccer article ended with my betting the team that they were not the best soccer team that Davidson has fielded, and if they were, they had to prove it. Well, they won all three games this week and if it was not for themselves and the school, it was to make me look stupid. Thanks, pals!

The week opened with a Southern Conference match at East Tennessee State University on Friday. Arriving only fifteen minutes before game time, the Cats were sluggish and allowed East Tennessee the first goal. By halftime, the score was tied at three goals apiece and Davidson adjourned to collect thoughts and adjust. Apparently, a little settling down was all they needed, for Davidson rammed in four goals to East Tennessee’s none in the second half. With the final score seven to three and Chris Roberts scoring a hat trick and two assists, the Cats happily departed for Saturday’s match at Tusculum.

Not great, Tusculum compensated for its lack of finesse with bullishness as evidenced by the eight yellow cards (2 cards for 1 player means expulsion) and the eventual ejection of their goalkeeper. Despite this aberration in the game’s play, Davidson dominated and led 1 to 0 at halftime. Then, like the previous day, they destroyed their opponents in the second half by scoring four more goals and allowing none. Goalie Mike “the Chicken” Iordanou summed up the game by saying, “Tusculum wasn’t really good, but they were rough. Because we started slow and then scored four in the second half shows we can hold our own in pressure situations.”

Wednesday was a glorious day for the soccer team. In the Southern Conference match against Western Carolina, the Cats showed the home crowd their savvy as they came from behind and scored to tie the game at 2-2 in the final minutes.

“The entire second half was completely controlled by us,” quipped junior Hall Barnett, “and scoring was just a matter of time.” Junior Brian Hamilton finally found the net as he took the ball from the wing and eased the ball into the corner to bring the crowd to its feet.

The ensuing two ten-minute periods of overtime found both teams playing at a torrid pace but Davidson still in full control—Western Carolina’s boom-ball style of play was floored by the short, accurate passing of the Cats. And in a display similar to the games with East Tennessee and Tusculum, Davidson scored in the very last minutes. This time C. K. Nichols trapped a pass about ten yards from the goal, turned, and fired by a frustrated Western Carolina goalkeeper to win the game 3-2.

Iordanou commented on the game stating that “We’re mentally stronger than ever because we can keep plugging when we’re behind. Most teams quit playing as hard after being behind for so long.”

Co-Captain Todd Lambert admitted that, “endurance-wise, we’re at our peak; we’ve been in better shape than every team we’ve played so far and that’s why we’re winning.”

Overall, the Davidson soccer team is 5-3 and 2-1 in the Southern Conference. With their ability to come from behind and score in the second half, they should continue their charge against Belmont Abbey at home on Monday, September 28.

**Player of the Week**
**CHRIS ROBERTS, forward**

Roberts, a sophomore soccer player from Schenectady, New York, had four goals and two assists in weekend action over East Tennessee and Tusculum, and played a major role in Wednesday’s come-from-behind win over Western Carolina. Roberts, a freshman phenom last year, is having no problem so far beating the sophomore jinx, with seven goals and two assists on the season.
