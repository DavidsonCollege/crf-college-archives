**Not so far away**

The terse headline on the front page of September 12, 2001’s issue of The Davidsonian spoke volumes to the preceding day’s events. While hundreds of miles separated this campus from New York City and Washington, D.C., the attacks hit close to home for most Davidson students, making distance a mere triviality to their mourning. Last week’s tragic bombings in Madrid served as another reminder of how, sometimes, we are not so far away at all.

Just days after the bombing occurred, the Art Department was scheduled to depart on a trip to Madrid as the final part of their senior Art History seminar. In preparation for the trip, the seniors were required to familiarize themselves with the train stations in Madrid — a mode of transportation they would use throughout the week. Stories quickly circulated around campus of Davidson students currently studying abroad in Madrid scheduled to be on the next train out of Atocha station that fateful morning. Not so far away.

Some concern has been raised of referring to the Madrid bombing as Spain’s 9/11. Some are offended by the comparison, and others feel that label an exaggeration. We take ownership of the tragedies and cannot imagine anything comparable ever happening to another nation. For too many, our pain, our horror, our grief was terrifyingly real on that Tuesday morning in September, while the events of 3/11 are something that happened over there, distant and unrelatable.

Yet the reactions to what happened in Madrid have undeniable similarities to those voiced by Davidson students — all Americans — after 9/11. In many ways, the Davidson bubble that so usually distances us from “real world” concerns has actually brought the world closer to us, because of our valued ties to other cultures and places through learning and understanding.

We applaud the decision made by the faculty in consultation with the students of the Art Department to cancel the trip — both out of safety concerns and respect for those mourning the lives lost in the attacks. It is entirely right to avoid seeming as gawking tourists during a time of national grief for the Spanish people. And for those Davidson students already immersing themselves in the rich Spanish culture, their stories and experiences will forever sadden, but also enrich, themselves and the community to which they will return and share.

If you have not already, stop, pause, and pray for victims and their families. Pray for the Spanish people. Pray that no one — here, there, or anywhere — should be able to share such experiences again. Because it’s never so far away.

**A look back: The war**

Iraqis must be free to make own decisions.

A year ago, I stood opposed to the war against Iraq. A distrust of our president, opposition to the policy of aggressive warfare, and hearing the stories of people in Central America led me to this stance. One year later, I feel the same way. The war soured the opinion of the U.S. in the eyes of people all over the globe, did nothing to reduce the threat of international terrorism, and placed the U.S. in the position of having to ‘democratize’ Iraq. The war did, however, end rule of one brutal tyrant in Iraq, and for this the U.S. military should be proud. What we must do today, however, is to evaluate the actions we have taken and what we can learn from them. Saddam Hussein’s Baathist rule was unquestionably one of the most brutal in the world today. The fact that the human rights situation in Iraq got as bad as it did shows how little attention the international community pays to...

Genocide and human rights. The hawks are right on one point: we should be aggressive in our promotion of human rights—we should not succumb to self-interested war in the name of “liberation.” A better course of action would be to forge a new international protocol on genocide and human rights, making the elimination of human suffering the basis for international cooperation. If the U.S. exerted its leadership in such a manner, it would promote trust and freedom without having to waste human life with badly planned conflicts.

The more immediate question is what exactly should be done in Iraq today. On one hand, the U.S. occupation appears to be helping a growing insurgency in Iraq. On the other hand, an immediate withdrawal of U.S. forces risks leaving the country in a mess. But as long as U.S. soldiers continue to die in Iraq, a pullout is inevitable. The U.S. should refrain from extracting any natural resources from Iraq or establishing any permanent military bases. We must also continue to provide funds and diplomatic support to back up the decisions of the Iraqi people. We should also promote cultural exchange and civic dialogue between citizens of both countries to put in place a process for mutual understanding and cooperation. And most importantly, the U.S. must adhere to the deadline for the end to the occupation—not because of the terrorists, but because it is the right thing to do. Democracy will not come to Iraq because of outside coaching; it will come only when its people are free to make their own decisions and mistakes.

In Iraq one year later

Freedom from tyranny a worthy goal in Iraq

When President George W. Bush came to office, he advocated the continuation of the containment policy toward Saddam Hussein initiated by President Bill Clinton. For a decade, Saddam had blamed the domestic turmoil caused by his own misrule on the international sanctions molded during the Clinton Administration. President George W. Bush’s administration presented a “smart sanctions” policy that was widely praised for directly addressing the allegations of many sanctions opponents that the UN sanctions had hurt the Iraqi people more than they contained Saddam Hussein. The dictator refused to comply with this new sanctions system, and after tolerating his lies and deception for a decade, the international community gave Saddam an ultimatum to open up for inspections or face “serious consequences.” Given yet another refusal to comply, the United States and more than twenty other countries joined together last spring to eliminate forever the heinous regime of Saddam Hussein. Baghdad fell three weeks after the invasion began, and the Saddam Hussein regime was no more. Never again would Saddam Hussein have the ability to dispatch weapons of mass destruction against America and her allies. Never again would Saddam Hussein be able to support terrorists and provide them with safe harbor in his palaces. At long last, one of the cruelest dictators in history was himself made history, and it is to the resolve of our men and women in uniform and the optimism of a liberated people that we owe praise for this accomplishment and the untold accomplishments that lie ahead.

Last spring, we were told the military ouster of Saddam Hussein was a task that would be accomplished with immense difficulty and thousands of casualties. We were told last fall that Saddam Hussein would never be captured. Saddam is now in a jail cell. The crime rate in Baghdad in recent months has been lower per capita than those of Chicago, New York, and Washington D.C., yet we are told the country is in a state of anarchy. Throughout the military conflict and the long process of Iraqi reconstruction, the United States and her allies have demonstrated the true calling of leadership. Leadership is not the ultimate capacity to command or control; it is the great opportunity to serve and aid others. There can be no greater service to mankind than to free his fellow man from tyranny and oppression. Once again, America has freed a people from a tyrannical government and, in the process, made the world a better, safer, and stronger place for us all.
