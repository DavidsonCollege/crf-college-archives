DAVIDSON REPRESENTED IN GOLF TOURNAMENT

With the Alumni

Davidson was represented by J. W. Clark, R. Howard, and H. F. Mayfield in the golf tournament in Greensboro last Friday and Saturday. Mayfield was defeated in the second flight by Black, of the University of Georgia. Howard was defeated in the semi-finals by Strange, of the University of North Carolina, and Clark met defeat at the hands of Compton, representing the University of Virginia. Strange and Compton were tied at the eighteenth hole in the finals, so it was necessary to play nineteen holes before the winner could be chosen. J. W. Clark was picked by many to win, but he was slightly off on his putting, due to the fact that the greens were smoother than those here. He holds the record for that course, having won it when he was a resident of Greensboro. Wright, of the University of Georgia, won the consolation match from Swearingen, of the University of Virginia.

Dr. H. B. Arbuckle, of Davidson, who conceived the plan of an intercollegiate tournament, presided over the luncheon Saturday. He was elected chairman of the Executive Committee of the Southern Intercollegiate Golf Association, as it is officially known. The officers elected for the coming year are: President, Clark (Davidson); Vice President, Swearingen (Virginia); Secretary and Treasurer, Grandin (North Carolina). There were ten contestants representing four institutions. It is probable that there would have been more if war had not interfered. It was decided to meet in Greensboro next year, two days before the Virginia-Carolina baseball game, and to play the finals the morning of the game. A dance was given in honor of the visitors Saturday night, and the prizes were presented at this occasion. The delegates were handsomely entertained, a delightful lunch being served both days of the contest by the Greensboro Country Club.

E. McA. Currie, ex-'16, has been teaching during the past year at Manchester, N. C.

Among the visitors on the Hill for the weekend were J. C. Harper, '15; L. Richardson, Jr., ex-'14; H. B. Yates, ex-'15, all of Greensboro, and R. H. Bennett, '15, of Charlotte.

Dr. J. Steve Simmons and Dr. Robert Hill, both of the class of '10, are now First Lieutenants in the Medical Corps of the regular Army and are stationed at Fort Bliss, El Paso, Tex.

The following message has been received from J. Bonar White, '10, who is now at Johns Hopkins University: “I hope for Davidson’s strictest co-operation in the President's idea of universal liability to military service.”

by intense interest and not for one moment did the attention of the audience flag through the regular speeches as well as the rebuttals. Each debater showed most diligent and thorough preparation, which resulted in a spirited and keen intellectual battle throughout.

After the debate, a reception was tendered to the friends and supporters of both institutions by the Seniors of Agnes Scott in the lobby of the administration building. Here delightful punch was served. The entire occasion was one of enjoyment and ably demonstrated the hospitality of such a Southern institution. This spirit of good feeling was not only shown by Agnes Scott, but was generously bestowed without stint by the people of Decatur.
