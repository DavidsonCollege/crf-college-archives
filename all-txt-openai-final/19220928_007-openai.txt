The sap is rising for the Charlotte banquet. Booster Kuester needs no introduction to the Davidson boys. The Alumni department takes notice that the new members of the faculty, without exception, are showing that they are fit men to teach the Davidson students.

The Voice

The average person is more susceptible to the change of tone in the voice than to any selected set of words. A fusillade of unpleasant words can be fired with a smile in the voice and they will be accepted as an evidence of cordial friendship. The meanest name that a man ever called me was spoken while the man was smiling—and I know the man likes me. The sweetest thing ever said to me was a darned lie. Words are but tools—the voice conveys the meaning. The tone of a voice tells whether you are friendly or looking for a fight. The voice is the vice or the virtue of a man’s meaning. The sound of the human voice betrays the speaker, for the sound comes from the soul, while words fly off the tongue. The quality of a voice is singularly affecting. An insult in words can be so clothed that it affords no excuse for resentment. It is not so much what you say as how you say it. A sentence may have two meanings, depending on the inflection of one word. We often see a grin on the face of a hyena, but there is never a smile in the voice of a hedgehog. A sincere, sober, straight face with a smile in the voice, beats a strained grin with a stiletto in the boot. I repeat, “The average person is more susceptible to the change of tone in the voice than to any selected set of words."—Honey Comb Briefs.

My life was never destined to be quite happy. It was laid along lines which I could not foresee, almost from earliest childhood. It has left me with nothing to hope for, with nothing definite to seek or strive for. Inherited wealth is a big handicap to happiness. It is as certain death to ambition as cocaine is to morality. If a man has made money, no matter how much, he finds a certain happiness in its possession, for in the desire to increase his business he has a constant use for it. But the man who inherits it has none of this. The first satisfaction, and the greatest, that of building the foundation of a fortune, is denied him. He must labor, if he does labor, simply to add to an over-sufficiency.—William K. Vanderbilt.

Brush Stuff

A bare expanse of wall rose high above the city street. Perched on a lower rung of his bedaubed ladder, the painter wielded his brush with wide sweeps, leaving behind a glistening white expanse. He finished his work, and prepared to go home. Behind the wall sat Mademoiselle before her boudoir mirror. Like her fellow craftsman, she plied with wide sweeps a fluffy brush, dipping frequently into one or another of the various tiny boxes upon her dressing table. She finished her work, and prepared to go out. “Save the surface, and you save all!”

“The greatest picture ever shown in Charlotte.”

Is the downfall of Ancient Rome to be paralleled by that of the present age?
