Throbbing Gristle.

Entertainment through Pain

Record reviews with Jon Glance

There are albums which aren’t for everybody, and some albums which aren’t for anybody. This album, a collection of the “greatest hits” of Throbbing Gristle, tends to fall somewhere between the two. This now defunct band was one of the primary creators and defenders of “industrial music,” a rather appropriate term for the mean-spirited strangeness that makes up this compilation.

The selections are pretty much evenly divided between digital electronic disco and “songs” that resemble some bizarre rendition of the Residents meeting Screaming Jay Hawkins. Examples of the former include the great “Hot On the Heels of Love,” which features a hilariously breathless parody of Donna Summer’s vocals circa “Love to Love You Baby,” and the hyperactive paranoia of “Adrenalin.” Examples of the latter are more interesting for their novelty than the former. The most interesting of these is the scathing “Hamburger Lady,” an evil little ditty about a burn victim (hence the name of the song) whose arms and ears and nose have been burned off and who is kept alive by tubes. Well, maybe not your ideal subject for a pop song. How about the intriguing “Tiab Guls” which is played in reverse on the LP (would the backwardness of the song lead you to read the title as “Slug Bait”? I wouldn’t doubt it).

And just who, you may well ask, is the perpetrator of this? The answer is a rather clean-cut looking quartet with the unlikely names of Genesis P. Orridge the First, Sleazy, Cosey, and Chris. Their gloom and doom histrionics are tempered by a sense of humor, however, which prevents the LP from being too depressing. An example of this comes after the last song on Side One, when a voice tells you to turn the record over. While I can’t recommend this album for everyone, I can say for individuals looking for something different in albums, Throbbing Gristle provides a wide variety.

If not, go back to your Billy Joel albums. Check out this album and find out why the phrase “Subhuman! I see you crawling! I see you crawling!” from the inside of a factory running at peak speed. Or perhaps send you scurrying.

WANT TO KILL A CONVERSATION? JUST MENTION COLON AND RECTUM CANCER.

RECTUM IS SECOND BY THIS MUCH TO LUNG CANCER...

SERIOUSLY, I DON'T WANT TO DISCUSS IT.

AND IT'S ONE OF THE MOST TREATABLE KINDS OF CANCER.

COLON AND RECTUM CANCER IS THE CANCER NO-ONE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT.

TELL ME WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED.

SO IF YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT, MAYBE YOU'LL READ ABOUT IT. HERE.

THAT LITTLE BOOKLET TALKS ABOUT A SIMPLE, PRACTICAL TESTING PROCEDURE... ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF EARLY DETECTION AND TREATMENT... ABOUT HOW TODAY COLON AND RECTUM CANCER DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN COLOSTOMY; IN SHORT, IT TALKS ABOUT SAVING LIVES AND SAVING THE QUALITY OF THOSE LIVES.

AMAZING!

BUT WHY DIDN'T WE TALK ABOUT THIS BEFORE?
