**A failure to communicate**

Davidson has long been recognized as having both a superb faculty and an open and responsive administration willing to listen
to complaints as well as compliments. Yet an incident that occurred over the summer sheds light on the fact that
relations between the faculty and the administration may not have been quite as good as they appeared.

As The Davidsonian reports this week, a letter signed by the members of the Faculty Committee on Admissions and Financial
Aid and sent to the entire Davidson College faculty said President Vagt “circumvented the admission process by admitting to the
Class of 2008 an applicant who was denied admission by a majority vote of the voting faculty serving on the
Faculty Committee on Admissions and Financial Aid.” The letter suggested that Vagt’s actions amounted to a violation of the Faculty
Bylaws.

Upon review of the incident, it was determined that Vagt did indeed have the authority to admit the student given
his powers under the College Constitution. The administration, the faculty, and the Board of Trustees have all taken steps over
the summer to adopt new guidelines on admissions procedures. We fully support these new guidelines and applaud all those involved
for both the expedient manner in which they were adopted, and also for using language that ensures that the faculty
continues to play a major role in admissions decisions.

Yet despite the relatively positive outcome, we must ask why this incident developed the way it did? Why did the
members of the faculty committee feel the need to write such an accusatory letter? Why were the President and members
of the Faculty Committee on Admissions and Financial Aid not able to communicate better and reach an agreement amongst themselves?

While no one individual or group is at fault here, the inability of the faculty and the administration to effectively
communicate, cooperate, and reach a compromise, and the way in which all sides handled the situation could have potentially caused
the College significant harm and embarrassment. The fact that the letter was only addressed to the faculty and was not
meant to be seen by students and others from outside the college is beside the point. Both sides should have
been able to work together better than they did.

Thankfully, the way in which the incident was ultimately resolved and the new guidelines adopted seem to indicate that both
the faculty and the administration are currently committed to a future filled with more open and timely communications. Let us
just hope that it stays that way.

**Davidson 101 expands**

This year, in an attempt to better educate this community about itself, the Office of Minority Affairs as well as
other entities on campus will focus on providing some opportunities for students to talk with each other concerning their differences.
In the Davidson 101 class for first-year students, there is now a required class that deals with diversity. Through the
Lilly Program for Theological Exploration, there is a program called Sustained Dialogue Groups. This program creates safe spaces where students
can explore through ongoing conversation how their primary social identities (particularly with regard to ethnicity and religion) shape their behaviors,
worldviews, and senses of vocation.

The Office of Minority Affairs is also planning several discussions this academic year where students will be brought together to
discuss several aspects of diversity. To get more information concerning Sustained Dialogue Groups, contact Jill Williams in the Lilly Office
at jiwilliams@davidson.edu. For more information concerning the diversity discussions through the Minority Affairs Office, contact Kema Gadson, who is our
New Diversity Program Advisor, at kegadson@davidson.edu or me at erjeffries@davidson.edu.Dean Ernest Jeffries

Out with the white lights

Another summer has brought another round of changes to the College’s appearance. Most significantly, the renovation of Chambers has been
completed and the new landscaping inserted between Chambers and Little Library looks fabulous. Verdant, spacious greens and wider, simpler brick-ways
and entry points have brought this former wasteland level with the rest of the campus.

When the sun goes down, however, there is an aesthetic problem created by some artificial light sources. I do not
think that I need to say much about the unimaginatively ubiquitous and garishly bright black lampposts that have plagued the
campus for years. However, I have noticed that their same bright light now dwells underneath the eaves of the front
facade of Chambers. While spotlights still warm the wings of Chambers with a stately gleam, the five incandescent lamps over
the front doors are completely overpowered by this otherworldly white light which reminds me of Sewanee, Tennessee’s spooky Templeton Library.
The College’s landscapers are busy doing wonderful work during the day, but perhaps they ought to work late once and
observe how little light bulbs can cast such offensive glances.

Managing lies: Swift Boat Veterans and Bush
By SAM SPENCER
Staff Columnist

I’m an adamant supporter of John Kerry. So I decided last week during my Thursday dinner at Vail Commons to
leave some Kerry 2004 bumper stickers sitting around with a sign that said “Free: Take one!” And many people did
just that. But some guy took the stickers, ran out of the dining hall, and threw them in the first
trash can he saw. I sat at dinner thinking, “why would anyone do that?”

The honor code violations of Bush supporters aren’t just limited to this campus, however: in recent weeks, the 527 group
“Swift Boat Veterans for Truth” has released several ads questioning John Kerry’s war record. Forget the fact that John Kerry
signed up for service (and won a few medals) while Papa Bush got Dubya into the Air National Guard. John
Kerry is now a liar because he’s not sure whether or not he was in Cambodia during Christmas, 1968. All
of the other claims made by the Swift Boat group have been refuted by sites like mediamatters.org, while papers like
the New York Times have dug up the quite obvious connections between the Swift Boat group, Bush aides (like Karl
Rove), and Bush himself.

Republicans Breaking the Honor Code

On top of all of this, John O’Neill, the founder of the group and author of the book Unfit for
Command, has been thoroughly discredited in the mainstream media. O’Neill never served with Kerry, but he was also a Swift
Boat crewman in Vietnam—which for some reason entitles him to write a book and start a 527. Hey, it’s a
free country. O’Neill claims in his book that John Kerry couldn’t have been in Cambodia for a multitude of reasons,
while supporting his claims by saying that he was never in Cambodia during the Vietnam War. Of course, it hurts
your credibility just a bit when there’s video footage of you telling President Nixon something completely opposite of what you
say in your book—and O’Neill did just that in 1971 when he said that he himself was in Cambodia during
‘Nam. Interestingly, O’Neill was a buddy of the Nixon camp, and Tricky Dick wanted to use O’Neill as the youthful
conservative foil to John Kerry after the future senator started protesting the war.

Since we left Davidson, the political discourse in the country has been limited to talking about same-sex marriage and Kerry’s
medals. Instead, Bush (and the media) should start talking about why he’s the best man for the job, instead of
focusing on John Kerry’s decorations. If he doesn’t start doing that soon, it will serve to demonstrate what I’ve known
all along: there are no good reasons to keep Bush in office.
