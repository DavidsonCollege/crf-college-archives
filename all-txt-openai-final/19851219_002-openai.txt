**Kuykendall appoints search committee**

President Kuykendall has appointed a search committee to find a replacement for retiring Business Manager Bob Currie. In a Nov.
15 letter to the faculty and administrative staff of the college, Kuykendall said, "...the committee will have the responsibility for
proposing a job description which defines the parameters of the new position and for the selection of an individual or
individuals to be recommended for appointment to this office.” He also outlined a major change in the college's administrative structure
which would involve the creation of a new vice-presidential position. He said, "...it will be best for us to restructure
the administration of the college in the area of business and finance by the appointment of an officer with the
title of vice president, to whom the several aspects of the college in that area will report.” He added, “I
shall propose an amendment to the Constitution to that effect.”

The Search Committee is chaired by Vice President of Academic Affairs and Dean of Faculty T. C. Price Zimmermann. Other
members of the committee include Comptroller Robert Davidson, Director of Personnel and Administrative Services Robert Stephenson, Vice President of Development
John Griffith, Professor of Philosophy Lance Stell, Director of Alumni Relations Jame May, and Director of Facilities Planning Grover Meetze.
Vice President Zimmermann said the committee has not yet decided on a selection process but plans to meet this Friday
to discuss strategy. “We hope to have someone in place by spring,” Zimmermann said.

**SGA considers third exam period**

The SGA is examining a proposal to add an evening exam period, according to SGA president Beadsie Woo. “It [the
proposal] came up because some people work better at night,” Woo said. The proposal, if passed by the SGA and
then by a faculty vote, would create three evening periods for self-scheduled exams. Currently, there are four morning and four
afternoon exam periods. Registrar Sue Ross said: “If faculty felt it [an evening exam period] educationally sound, this office would
do what it could. I'm not positive it’s educationally sound.” “The biggest problem,” Ross said, “is that the building [Chambers]
would be tied up.”

**India program provides insight**

By WAYNE MAGRUDER

Among Davidson’s opportunities for international travel, the fall term program in India offers the only non-Western learning experience. Religion professor
William Mahoney led this year’s group of 16 Davidson and two Duke students on the three-month journey of study and
travel. The students spent six weeks living...in Madras while they completed a course in the Tamil language and a seminar
on South India. Each participant also chose an independent study topic. During most weekends, the group traveled to regional sites
like Mysore, Bangalore, and Kanchipuram. The last week of the trip was devoted to free travel time.

The India program offered opportunities for students to make a detailed study of many phenomena unfamiliar to Westerners. Junior John
Odom did his independent study on Jainism and saw a holy Jainist statue some three hours by crowded bus from
Madras. He learned of both early religious beliefs and the contemporary customs of travel in a densely populated, underdeveloped country.
Odom said it was “a revealing experience” and indicative of the type of exposure travel brings.

Senior Catherine Melton’s independent study focused on Christians who refuse to be baptized because baptism is treated as a sign
of an outcast by most Hindus. Senior Binney Jannetta studied leprosy, a common affliction in many parts of South and
Southeast Asia, and visited a leprosy center.

The independent studies allowed the students the flexibility to pursue topics within the realms of their different majors. Junior Gordon
Watkins did a study of rural development; junior Ellen Harding, on Hindu festivals; junior Laura Kline, on Yoga; junior Mark
Swift, on classical Hindu music; Sherri Schwenke, on the changing role of the individual in the caste system; senior Holly
Parrish, on children in India—their health, nutrition, and education.

Several participants found the return home harder to adjust to than the trip abroad. Odom commented that he found Davidson
“different, not what I’d remembered.” Junior Mark Gosnell reminisced longingly about India. Parrish said, “The longer I stayed in India,
the more I learned about America.” There was a consensus that one of the most valuable and lasting impressions one
picks up from other cultures is a new perspective on one’s own society.
