12 Friday, November 11, 1983 / The Davidsonian

FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 11
WDAV RADIOTHON: All Day. Morrison Room.
24th ANNUAL SACRED MUSIC CONVOCATION: This probably has very little to do with the Grateful Dead or even Air Supply.
Music equals religion?
POP FILM: Used Cars. Love Auditorium. 8 and 10:30 p.m.
WILLIAM ALBRIGHT, ORGANIST: Davidson College Presbyterian Church. 8:15 p.m. Now this is sacred music.

SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 12
WDAV RADIOTHON: All Day. Morrison Room.
24th ANNUAL SACRED MUSIC CONVOCATION.

Campus Events

FOOTBALL: Catawba. Maybe today is the day for the Concord Marching Spiders to entertain during halftime. HEAR! Such hits as
“On Broadway,” “Somewhere Over the Rainbow,” and “Feelings.” SEE! Teenage girls twirling white plastic rifles. Richardson Stadium. 1:30 p.m.
SOCCER: SC North-South Championships. 1:30 p.m. Trot over to Sprunt Memorial Field to see Davidson battle Furman and win, win,
win.
MEN’S AND WOMEN’S CROSS COUNTRY: NCAA Region III. Clemson, S.C. 1:30 p.m.
FILM: The Wizard of Oz. Dwarves and flying monkeys, it’s just like the freshman class! 900 Room.

SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 13
WDAV RADIOTHON: All Day. Looks like this is the only thing at all today. Morrison Room.
FLASHDANCE UPDATE:
SGA PRE-EXAM SUICIDE PARTY: Commons. 9-11 p.m. Freshmen and hall counselors only. We're not sure what this actually entails, but
they'll probably block off the balconies and refuse to serve food in order to guarantee safety. Who knows, they may
even flashdance at this thing.

MONDAY, NOVEMBER 14
CLASSES END: 5 p.m.
JUGGLING: All of them, victims of their own provocative beauty. Morrison Room. 7 p.m.

TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 15
READING DAY: With a day like this, it’s easier to discard the entire concept of reading in favor of an
inexpensive novel and BHA & BHT-filled chocolate-flavored dessert items. We’re talking Harlequins and Hostess.
TURKEY SHOOT: Come blast away with the ROTC’s in the basement Belk rifle range. Blam! There goes one under the
ice machine. Zowie! Get that one in the corner! Take a study break and bring a turkey home to Mom,
or Dad even. 9:00 to 3:00. ¢75.

WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 16
EXAMS BEGIN: 9 a.m. Good luck with exams! And have a safe but fun Thanksgiving break!

THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 17
EXAMS: Sounds suspiciously like exhumes.

FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 18
MORE EXAMS. EXAMS GALORE.

SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 19
LAST CHANCE TO TAKE THOSE EXAMS
PERFECT ATTENDANCE: Gold stars to everyone attending exams! (after all, you’re students!).

SHORT CALENDAR: But that doesn’t mean we aren't doing anything!

"BIBLE ‘N GRAVY, DADDY CUTS THE TURKEY, AND GRANDDADDY CUTS THE CHEESE..."

"BUT YA KNOW, LITTLE ONE, THANKSGIVING IS FAMILY AT HOME."

"HOW MANY EXAMS YOU GOT, MEESTER TARN? YOU LOST YOUR TRASH!"

"THAT ONCE IN A YEAR OCCASION WHEN, HEY — IT'S OFF TO VISIT AN ORIENTAL RICKSHAW DRIVER. PEOPLE WON'T LAUGH.
IT'S THANKSGIVING AND I'M GONNA REVITALIZE SOMETHING. ERASE THE PILGRIMS DID."

"YES, THANKSGIVING IS A SPECIAL HOLIDAY WHEN ONE CAN SPEND TIME WITH FAMILY DOCUMENTING..."

"YOU THROW GOLDFISH RIGHT ACROSS THE ROOM. A SPECIAL TIME WHEN..."
