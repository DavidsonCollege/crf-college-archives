FEATURING JOHN T. HARMON, SENIOR

By JIM KUIST and CHUCK WRIGHT

Jim— Hullo

John— Good evening, Jim. Hel-

Jim— This is Chuck Wright, John.

John— Oh. Hello

Chuck— Hullo

John— Well?

Jim and Chuck— We, uh, wanted to...

John— Why doesn’t just one of you tell me? There is hardly need for a chorus.

Chuck— Hey, you know that’s a pretty good idea for making your grades. Maybe I ought to try that.

John— I would not advise your trying it. My impression is based on a good deal of culture.

Chuck— Yeah. Guess I wouldn't make out as good as you.

Jim— Well, John, the Davidsonian is starting another series of articles about seniors who will graduate this year, and, uh...

John— How very clever of them. I suppose graduation is something every senior must face.

Jim— This is Chuck Wright, John.

John— Yes.

Jim— You mentioned your bit of living just a minute ago. What sort are you going to do?

John— My forte is in the field of languages. Especially the classical languages. Although I lean more heavily toward Ernest
than George.

Chuck— George?

John— George Labban. I might also have meant George Watts, but we were speaking of classical languages.

Jim— Then Ernest must be Dr. Beatty.

John— My, you are sharp. Ernest has aroused in me a fascination for Latin. He is a simply wonderful teacher.

Chuck— Do you plan to teach?

John— Yes. I shall study abroad first, of course. Really, though, I think that you boys are wasting your time
talking to me. You can certainly get plenty of information about me from other people on the campus. And I
have promised to meet Marshall and the group at 8:00.

Chuck— Dick thought that we should begin with you.

John— Well, I suppose Morehead knows what he wants. Uh, what was your name?

Jim— This is Chuck Wright, John.

John— Oh. Hello. Well, are you going to interview me?

Chuck— Yes. But we didn't quite know where to begin.

John— Apparently not. Why don't I interview myself?

Jim and Chuck— Well, uh, sure John...

John— I was born in Laurens, S. C. in 1934. When I finished with secondary education I came to Davidson
for four years of college. I am now ready to do my bit of living in the world. How does
that grab you?

Jim— That's fine, John, but, uh...

John— Well. What else is there to say about me?

Chuck— Uh, aren't you pretty brilliant?

John— I don’t presume to be a scholar. I have made my grades by strategy and impression. I DO impress
people. But I am certainly not in the class of those designated as positively brilliant.

Jim— Oh, I think you're very smart.

John— I AM quite intelligent. I am just not of that sort, that’s all. And I don’t mean to be
grouped in such a category.

Jim— Well, John, the Davidsonian is starting another series of articles about seniors who will graduate this year, and, uh...

John— How very clever of them. I suppose graduation is something every senior must face.

Jim— Youthe Union at 9:00, Bill Price, Ralph Setzler, Sonny Jim—Yeah, I've noticed you all Ferguson, Ross Smythe, and Dave
sitting over there at a table. Do McLean was announced by Dick you have a regular discussion Adams, president. The
Beaver Club is a service organization group? John—Oh no, we don't have scheduled meetings. Some of us do like to
get together and talk about serious things. But nothing esoteric. Chuck—Aren't you interested in philosophy? John—George Abernathy certainly stimulates discussion
now and then, at least. Today the Abbess gave a perfectly silly lecture on art. The pair really outdo themselves
in class. But I do wish that George would let us know what he is trying to tell us. Chuck—Is
Dr. Abernathy pretty in- terested in your group then? John—No, Janie is much better over coffee than George. Jim—I see
your point, John. John—Well, it is after 9:00 and I really must go. You boys drop round again sometime and
we may find something to talk about. If you must write an article I hope you can use any little
thing I have said. But if Morehead sends that boy to me with a camera, I will not pose for
a portrait. Good evening, gentlemen. Jim and Chuck—Uh, goodbye, John. And thanks. John—You're welcome, Jim. Jim—And what about Chuck? John—Oh,
yes, you're welcome too.

Henry Bucher, a sophomore, won the Davidson College ROTC Motto Contest, it was announced Tuesday, February 14. The winning entry
was “Parati Sed Paci” which, when translated, means “Prepared but for Peace.” Bucher, at the Tuesday drill period on February
14, received from Cadet Major John W. McLauchlin the five-dollar award offered to the winner. The motto will go on
the school shoulder patch, which will be worn by all cadets. The selection committee was composed of Robert C. Stewart,
James K. Morrill, and William H. McNair, all cadets in the Davidson ROTC unit.

Council Changes . . . (Continued From Page One) be effected through the Southern Bell Telephone Company. President Anderson then
told of his talk with College Treasurer, Mr. D. Grier Martin, on the subject of getting drink machines in the
dormitories. Mr. Martin indicated that one would probably be put in Belk, and possibly ones in Duke and in Watts.

Trustees Vote... (Continued From Page One) The trustees received the report of the joint faculty-trustee Committee on Population Trends. The
report recommended a gradual increase of enrollment to 1,006, but only after improvements have been made in endowment, physical plant,
and the quality of teaching. No estimate was made of the amount necessary for the general improvements, but almost $2
million is the estimated need for an increase to 1,000. This is in addition to the $1,500,000 now being sought,
and what might be needed for the improvements.

Convention being held at Charlotte on February 24-25. The Charlotte Convention is the highlight of Young Republicanism in North Carolina
and it will be climaxed by the Lincoln Day Dinner on Saturday night for which Congressman Hillings of California will
be the speaker. The College Council itself is composed of the organized clubs at UNC, Woman's College, N. C. State,
Wake Forest, East Carolina, Pfeiffer, Lenoir-Rhyne, Lees-McRae, Salem, and Davidson. Delegations from most of these schools in addition to several
state Federation officers are expected. Anyone wishing to attend the Banquet here, the Lincoln Day Dinner in Charlotte, or the
Convention proper, please contact John Maultsby or Tom Hall.

Ovens Union... (Continued From Page One) of the college grapevine. Downstairs, the student store offers necessary school supplies to its
purchasers. Here one will find “Modernage” nylon hose, “Sea-Bee” swim fins, made-to-order wedding tiles, prickly heat powder, and baby booties
at quite economical prices. Student store sales for last year totaled $24,500. Companion to the student store is the snack
bar where hot tamales, “bacon puffs,” and clam chowder provide refreshments during study breaks and bull sessions. Although busy fountain
men are not allowed to sell ice cream in a cup, they may hand the purchaser the ice cream in
a cone with an empty cup and the purchaser may in turn perform the cumbersome process of transfer. The second
floor of the Union houses the Y. M. C. A. office, student government headquarters, and the offices of various campus
publications. Here also is located the Music Room complete with a three-speed phonograph bearing the words: “Fixed—but not completely.” The
most recent examination reveals that with the exception of the failure of the turntable to revolve, all parts are in
good working condition. Mr. C. Shaw Smith, who has served in the capacity of director of the Union since its
erection in 1952, is a familiar figure to all Davidson students. His wide theatrical experience as a magician before he
joined the college is well known. One of his employees observed, “Mr. Smith doesn’t get a lot of the credit
he deserves.”

most buckets, but also for knowing how to pick his clothes. This Arrow University button-down shirt is beautifully tailored. There
were two visitors at the meeting.
