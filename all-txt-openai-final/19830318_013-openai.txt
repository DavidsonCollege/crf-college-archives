Davidson Does Dallas, et al
Concert Choir, Jazz and Wind Ensembles tour during break

By DIANA BOHRER
People can engage in five basic activities on a bus.
—Sophomore Amy Burton on the Spring Chorus Tour

Three of Davidson’s musical organizations, the Concert Choir, Wind Ensemble, and Jazz Ensemble, took their annual tours during spring break,
performing a total of fourteen times in seven states.

Music professor Vladimir Morosan conducts the Choir, which consists of both male and female choruses. This year's tour of Texas,
Louisiana, Alabama, and South Carolina was a success, he said, because “there was a growth process” in the choir.

He added that the concert in Houston was the one he would remember best because “a special atmosphere” prevailed that
evening that was “difficult to put into words.” Davidson students, alumni, and parents showed up for most of the concerts,
which made the performers feel welcome.

Living with music for a week presented a unique opportunity for the singers to come together “as a musical family,”
Morosan explained.

While travelling, Morosan revised a manuscript for publication. As sophomore Amy Burton pointed out, there are five activities that one
can engage in on the bus: reading, writing letters, talking, card-playing, and sleeping.

Sophomore Laura McDonald, who sings and accompanies the group on piano, agreed with Morosan that the eight days of working,
singing, and travelling together fostered “a feeling of unity” among the choir members because it was a chance to get
to know one another at least superficially. “I read a lot on Baroque music,” she recalls, “and I’m still enjoying
my sunburn.”

“I think the most memorable things were the concerts,” senior Neal Biggers said. “I never forget the one in Dallas.”
Although not a choir member, Biggers accompanies the Choir on several pieces. He enjoyed the challenge of visiting a different
church every night and comparing “the different organs I got to play.”

Music Professor William Lawing, who conducts both instrumental ensembles, said that this spring’s trip to Virginia, Maryland, and Delaware was
“as good as any tour we’ve had, from a musical standpoint.” Because the distances between cities are shorter in the
East than in the West, the musicians enjoyed free time in Baltimore, New York City, Washington, and Williamsburg. Lawing found
that the balance between performing, resting, and visiting was helpful to the players. Like Morosan, he was “extremely pleased with
the growth that occurred during the week.”

Since every concert but one was in an ensemble member's hometown, their audiences contained many close friends and relatives as
well as some past music students. On their free day in New York City, players went dancing in Greenwich Village,
saw Cats and A Chorus Line on Broadway, and heard the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. According to senior Jeff Nielsen,
the free day was the only day all week that the group encountered rain. Nielsen said that the National Aquarium
and Harbor Place, a restored waterfront, were among the most memorable sights in Baltimore. Senior Melissa McKeithen’s fondest memory of
the trip was the mini-skirt contest she entered in a club in New York City.

“People were really closer on this tour than ever before,” Jon Lawry, a veteran of five tours, commented. “By far
it’s the best tour we’ve done.” Lawry headed up the group’s “second annual limerick-writing extravaganza,” as he describes it. Lawing
praised this year’s poems, saying, “Both the quality and the wit were outstanding although they can never be repeated in
public.”
