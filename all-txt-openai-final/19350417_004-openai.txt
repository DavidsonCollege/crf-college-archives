#### WILDCAT NINE DROPS TWO GAMES TO DUKE

**As FELIX Sees 'Em**  
By LAMONT BROWN

Davidson suffered a severe attack on its athletic front last week with three out of four varsity teams encountering defeat. Only the Wildcat netmen saved the 'Cats athletic record from complete rout, by their successful invasion of Virginia. Meanwhile, however, the Kittens took over a little spark and fire to decisively outpoint their opponents in both track and baseball, and thus considerably eased the pain of defeat handed the varsity teams.

**'CATS FALL DOWN**

The title of the song "I Fa' Down and Go Boom" might have been applied to the baseball team last week, who, although they exhibited good collegiate ball, had to release its hold on the attic of the big five conference to Duke. The Blue Devils demonstrated some high-class willow swinging besides having a trio of fielders worth any big league's attention. With Davidson trailing by three runs, the 'Cats came to bat in the seventh inning with several hundred spectators standing in traditional manner, hoping against fate for a turning point. A brief period of thrilling ball saw Davidson with one run to its credit with bases loaded, but a long fly to left field descended into waiting hands to end the good luck streak.

At Southern Pines before a crowd of some five thousand, the 'Cats opened up the fireworks and took an early lead, though Duke garnered enough in six innings to tie. However, Ace Parker slammed out another homer, the second in two days, to defeat the home team. The game featured the umpiring of an old Army sergeant who naturally knew more about cannonballs than he did baseballs. Sadly, both teams suffered.

**CINDERMEN LOSE**

The Vols outdid themselves Saturday, no doubt inspired by some close competition from Wildcat cindermen, to break two of their own records. Due to a high wind, these records came near being disqualified as such, although officials deemed it OK after some consideration. Paul Pittman came within a few inches of crashing the college pole vault record by sailing over the horizontal bar at 12 feet. John Lee followed Pitt in second place with 11 feet 6 inches, which is plenty good considering Johnny has been unable to participate with the squad for the past month because of a broken foot bone. Needless to say, Earl Frazier carried off two firsts in the distances with characteristic easy style.

**RACQUETEERS BACK**

Ed Garrett and his crew of Varsity tennis stars returned Sunday after what we might term a successful invasion of Virginia, although two out of the three arranged matches were called off for rain. The locals bowled over the University of Richmond in fine style and had little trouble in doing so.

The Junior class is leading Intramuralia with a total of 105 points... Four varsity contests were rained out last week... Varsity Baseball team will play 10 more engagements, all with Big Five members... Captain Pritchett seems to have a confident feeling over the outcome of the Davidson-Virginia Tech track meet... Is pleased with the work of Siewers and Newton in the discus... The Fresh baseball team has four contests in the last four days of this week... Captain Pritchett will have definite information next week on the Davidson-Navy football game which is being arranged... Although the following few lines do not concern Davidson (in fact the incident took place some 3000 miles west of here) it is, nevertheless, of unusual content: "A University of Southern California (Los Angeles) sprinter was given four medals for running one race at the recent Long Beach relays... He was first runner in a four-man half-mile relay but when he came to the end of his lap found no team-mate to grab the baton, so he just kept on running and came in third. He was given all four medals."

### TENNESSEE'S TRACKMEN WIN OVER WILDCATS

**Frazier, Parker, Potter, And Siewers Take First Places For Davidson**  
**TWO RECORDS BROKEN**  
**Anderson, Of Tennessee, Is High Scorer Of Windy Meet**

A hard-fighting Wildcat track team was beaten by the cindermen of the University of Tennessee Saturday afternoon in Knoxville. Two records for the University trackmen were broken by the Vols' ace runner, Harry Anderson, so that it was no ordinary team to which Davidson bowed. Paul Pittman made a new high for himself as he won the pole vault by crossing the bar at 12 feet; Audtey Gammon tied his highest jump of five feet, ten inches, to take a second place for the Wildcats. Frazier was first in the mile run, his time being 4:36.5, Dickson came second in the hundred-yard dash, and second in the two-twenty; Byerly was third in this latter event. Parker and Byerly were first and third, respectively, in the one-twenty, and Johnson was third in the four-forty. Frazier won the eight-eighty in 2:03.4, and Gullette won the two-mile run in 10:29.7. Pittman placed third in the two-twenty low hurdles.

In the field events, Potter and Siewers placed first and second in the shot put, Potter's distance being 39'9¼". Siewers, Tipton, and Potter won first, second, and third places in the discus throw, the winning throw being 113'2". Johnston was second in the javelin throw, and Dickson third in the broad jump. Lee, of Davidson, tied with Pritchett for second place in the pole vault. Anderson was high scorer for Tennessee, winning firsts in both the 100 and the 220-yard dashes, and in the high and broad jumps. Other first place winners for Tennessee were Sledge, who won the 440-yard run, and Jeffries, who won the javelin throw. Tennessee's relay team won the mile race in 3:35.8, to bring the Vols' total score to 72 points, as opposed to Davidson's 59 points. Although the entire meet took place in a high wind, the new records set by Anderson will stand, the Athletic Council of that school has ruled.

The team was composed of (1) Kenny, (2) Frampton, (3) Cooke, (4) Hartzog, (5) Moore, (6) Rheinhardt. The score of the meet was 7 to 2.

The meet was played in a strong wind which blew down two telephone poles behind the courts at Myers Park Country Club. However, they did not fall in the direction of the players so no one was disturbed and the play was not interrupted. The freshmen have another meet with N. C. State freshmen Saturday morning, April 20.

### Georgia Tech Golfers Defeat Davidson Team

Davidson's varsity golfers took it on the chin in their return match with Georgia Tech on the Carolina Club links in Charlotte last Friday. The two teams met in Atlanta several days ago at which time the Yellow Jackets gained a 17 to 1 verdict. Their Friday win was by a 16½-1½ count. The Techmen, led by their famous Yates-Moore combination, were superior to the Wildcats in all departments of play. They took all points except in the number four match. In this battle, Charlie Hamrick of Davidson and Ridley of the visitors broke even. Yates and Moore were low men with seventy-fours. The former was not playing his best brand of golf and revealed his displeasure with himself on the fifth hole where he wrapped his number one iron around a tree. Snow and Cowan were "low" for the Wildcats with seventy-sevens. The summary of the match: Yates, Tech (74) defeated Snow (77) 3-0; Moore, Tech (74) defeated Cowan (77), 3-0; Dannals, Tech (75), defeated Ross (80), 3-0; Hamrick, Davidson (80), tied Ridley (83), 1½-1½; Yates and Moore defeated Snow and Cowan 3-0; Dannals and Ridley defeated Ross and Hamrick, 3-0. Total: Tech, 16½; Davidson, 1½.

### FROSH BASEBALL NINE VICTORIOUS

**Wildkittens Decisively Defeat Rutherford Junior College By 16-9 Score**

Despite a drizzling rain, the Davidson freshman baseball team defeated the Rutherford College nine Thursday afternoon, by a score of 16-9. Rutherford College won over the Wingate College team the day before in a thirteen-inning game.

Seniors Wallop Frosh In Softball Game 35-14

In a game featured by heavy hitting, the Seniors defeated the Freshmen in the first game of intramural softball competition, 35-14. Heavy slugging played its part and unusual fielding, mostly by the Frosh, did much to add interest to the game. This game was played with a softball, thus explaining the big score. For the Seniors, Pitcher “Duster” Hutchins and Hugh Yelverton were outstanding, while Dixon, Vause, Reid, and Rainey starred for the Frosh. Brittain started on the mound for the Freshmen, but retired in favor of Rainey after the third inning. Hutchins went the entire route for the upperclassmen and kept the hits well scattered except in the sixth inning when they combined hits and walks for a total of nine runs. The heavy bats of the Seniors brought home thirteen runs in the fourth inning, eight in the seventh inning, and six in the eighth inning. Vause pitched the last four innings and would have held the Senior batsmen in check except for shoddy support.

Tomorrow, the Sophomores meet the Juniors in the second game of the intramural softball program. The Seniors play the Sophomores on Wednesday; the Freshmen play the Juniors on Thursday, and the Juniors and Seniors meet on Friday. The remaining games will be played the first of next week.

“Ace” Parker, Wagner, Knock Two Home Runs For Duke As Blue Devils Down Davidson

MORGAN DICKSON STAR

Duke Edges Out Davidson In Second Game 6-3

Last weekend the Davidson Wildcats took two successive defeats in a row from the hard-slugging Blue Devils nine from Durham. Both games were featured by an attempt at a Wildcat rally in each. In the first game, the rally in the seventh inning looked as though it would be successful but fell through in the last half of the eighth. The first game was played here on Friday afternoon, the next game was played at Southern Pines on Saturday afternoon as a featured part of the Spring festival.

Davidson 1; Duke 5.

The game progressed without score until the first half of the second inning when Wagner, the Blue Devil catcher, stepped to the plate and slammed one over the left field fence for one of the two homers of the game. The next home run followed directly behind its mate as “Ace” Parker smacked the second one far into center field for two home runs in succession for the Blue Devils. The next Devil run came in the fourth inning, and it was not until the eighth inning that they were able to put over the last two runs. For the Wildcats, Morgan scored the only run of the afternoon when he hit a long ball between center field and left field, the ball bounded directly for the open gate but suddenly took a bound to the right of it and went into the hedge, the Duke center fielder fished it out in time to hold Morgan to a three-bagger. The next man up was Jim Dixon, who after two lusty swings, singled to bring in Morgan for the only Wildcat score of the afternoon. Harris was the losing pitcher, and Weafer pitched for the winners.

Davidson 3; Duke 6.

The Southern Pines baseball fans witnessed a hard-fought game which was apparently evenly contested until the eighth inning. The score remained three all until the eighth inning, when Parker stepped up to bat with two out and two on bases. Soon, the situation became more tense after Parker had one strike called on him and had taken a slice at another. He then tripled to bring in two runs. Another run was scored against the Wildcats earlier in the game when it was ruled that Ravenel had interfered with a runner coming in to home from third; the run was given to the Devils on this account. The three Wildcat runs were scored by Ravenel, Harris, who was playing left field, and Mackorell. Jack Jenkins was the losing pitcher and “Nak” Tenis and Barley pitched for the winners.

Some kind of a pervert is in action at Ohio State University (Columbus), for two sororities, Kappa Kappa Gamma and Pi Beta Phi, have recently lost their Greek letter plaques from their front doors. From Dana College (Newark, N. J.) comes the report that a professor and another professor’s wife recently helped a labor union picket a store. Dr. LeRoy D. Weld, professor of physics of Coe College (Cedar Rapids, Ia.), now possesses over 5,000 physics term definitions. The difficult subject of how to mount an elephant was recently explained to students at Duchesne College (Omaha, Nebr.), by a visiting bishop from India. Angered at articles published in newspapers which were detrimental to fraternities, a group of Greek letter men at Ohio Univ. (Athens), tarred and feathered the writer. Deferred rushing has recently been abandoned at the University of Chicago. Northwestern University (Evanston, Ill.), has been losing an average of $10 a month on public telephones in its library because of slugs.
