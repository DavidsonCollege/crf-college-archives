**The Why of the Three Dollar Y. M. C. A. Fee**

Collection Progressing Nicely; Total Soon to Be Announced.

On account of some confusion in regard to the collection of the three dollar Y. M. C. A. fee, a copy of the resolutions unanimously adopted by the student body of last year is given below:

“Realizing the supreme importance of maintaining a ‘Y’ secretary during the coming year, we, the student body, do hereby promise to contribute the sum of three dollars per man toward his salary, provided:

“(a) That a board of directors be elected to control the collection of this money and to guarantee the remainder of his salary.

“(b) That this money not be collected before the opening of the collegiate year 1919-20.”

It can be seen from this resolution that this assessment is entirely independent of any collegiate fee. The Y. M. C. A. board of control is a student organization elected by the students to finance the various activities of the “Y.” The plan adopted by the students was to raise three dollars from every man in college and to secure the balance through outside subscriptions.

Due to the early registration on Monday and Tuesday, it was impossible to see every man at the time he matriculated. However, no one need feel slighted or overlooked, as they will be approached later. To relieve this board from any extra trouble in collection, those who have not paid are urged to hand this amount as early as possible to any member of the board. They are as follows: J. R. Boulware, 15 Watts; D. M. Chalmers, 2 Ga.; L. B. Schenck, 66 Chambers; W. B. Sullivan, 44 Chambers, and S. H. Askew, 14 Ga. Checks should be made payable to the Y. M. C. A. of S. H. Askew, Treasurer.

**MINISTERIAL BAND HAS GOOD GETAWAY. FINE PROSPECTS**

The Ministerial Band held its first meeting last Sunday at two o'clock. The band gives promise of having a fine “year.” For one thing, there were over thirty old members present, whereas last year there were only thirty members, both old and new. Last year, too, the band met at a very inconvenient hour and was interfered with by other meetings, such as the World Forum. The World Forum will be discontinued this year and conflicts with other meetings will be avoided as well.

The student volunteers will be working under a handicap until Dave Roberts, the president, returns. However, the vice-president is taking hold in his place, and the volunteers will go right on with their work in spite of difficulties. Bitzer, the chairman of the information committee, has been working this summer and has collected a great deal of literature dealing with missions and mission fields.

On next Sunday at a time to be announced later, the Ministerial Band will hold its second meeting and all candidates for the ministry are urged to be present.

**PARAGRAPHS BY OUR “Y” SECRETARY, MR. MILES**

The golden rule is a pretty good kind of a motto to tie up to in college life as well as in the regular scheme of events in that world outside the academic halls. So as we start a new year, we might do well to take a “look see” at this old adage and see where it hits us, and we believe that every man, if he is fair with himself, will agree that it is essential to the best kind of college atmosphere.

For the upperclassman, we might put it this way: “Do unto others as you would have had them do to you when you first hit the Hill.” Think back on those old days and figure out what you would have appreciated at that time and then practice it on the next Fresh you see. Thoughtfulness and consideration go a long way towards making this world a cheerful place to live in. When you come to think of it, selfishness is at the bottom of most of the trouble around, and a little of the opposite thing, or unselfishness, is a good remedy for the aforesaid evil. So let us think of the other fellow and we will all be happier.

The Freshman wants to practice the same thing. Put yourself in the place of the upperclassman and try to visualize his viewpoint. Remember how you felt as a senior in prep school and then it will come home to you that the older men have better judgment in handling the affairs of the college. They are more interested in you and your welfare than you think, and if you pull with them the best results can be obtained. Therefore, with this unity of purpose and reaching after a mutual understanding, we will have the best year ever on this old campus.

**Record Attendance at First “Y” Meeting**

Plenty of “Pep” and Life Shown; Let’s Keep It Up.

It was good to see so large an attendance at the first Y. M. C. A. meeting of the year Sunday night. Certainly no man went away disappointed, for after some special music and good “healthy” singing, Mr. Miles made a most interesting and instructive talk.

In his talk, Mr. Miles showed how Joshua and Caleb stood up against the other ten spies for what was right. “Just so,” said he, “should the student on Davidson campus have the courage to stand up for the right.” He should have the strength and courage for the coming year's work. Mr. Miles continued by saying that the prospects for a prosperous year were better this fall than ever before, and that every student should have high ideals with the courage and strength to carry them out.

When Coach “Bill” left, prospects for football seemed poor, but now with our new coach and so large a student body, Davidson can do even greater things if the student body makes up its mind to do so. The goal for which everyone has been striving will surely be reached if everyone is strong and of good courage.

“The four years a fellow spends at Davidson will be much more profitable if he has the courage and strength to do what is right.” In closing, Mr. Miles announced that a player piano had been purchased and would be placed in the “Y” rest room this week. Every man in college will be expected to use it.

**Reorganized Y. M. C. A. Plans Great Things This Year. Effect Is Already Seen on the Campus.**

With Bob Miles and Dwight Chalmers at the helm, the Y. M. C. A. is headed for great things this year. Already men are beginning to learn the way to the “Y” room at the gymnasium with its player piano, victrola, games, and writing material. Besides this, there are going to be movies every Friday night. They are Paramount Artcraft pictures and that is enough said.

The Sundays will be well filled up. At 10 o'clock each morning there will be the Bible classes. These will be Bible courses this fall and mission study courses next spring. The Y. M. C. A. will continue its work in the country Sunday schools every Sunday afternoon. The weekly “Y” meeting will be at 7 o'clock Sunday night.

The president and cabinet are planning big things and all prospects point toward an association this year which will be the vital factor of the religious life on the campus.

**MONGERS, BEWARE.**

It roused me from my slumbers,
I hied me from my bed;
If I had known what breakfast was,
I would have slept instead!Their value they 'Sovieties we learn to convey these: : ‘amount will be due on return of Literary Societies Going Back to Pre-War Customs Freshmen to Receive Special Training Until Xmas.

It has been agreed by the two literary societies to return to their former custom of having Junior societies for Freshmen up until the beginning of the spring term. This plan has been tried for many years and has proven very successful from the standpoint of the Freshmen as well as the whole society. On account of the late start last year, it became necessary to deviate from this plan and the experience of that year is sufficient to justify the course outlined for this term.

The advantages to the Freshmen are of a double nature. First, he is given the opportunity of speaking before an audience who would be hardly as critical as the regular society. Second, he is permitted to speak more often and is thus helped to wear off the first uneasiness, which he naturally experiences. The importance of the society work cannot be too greatly emphasized. In every walk of life, in every kind of work, the art of effective speaking is invaluable. A man may have brilliant ideas, excellent suggestions, or improved methods, but if he is unable to convey them to others, they are of no benefit to him or those whom he endeavors to serve. The practice which a man receives in his four-year course will not alone make of him a finished orator. If, however, he is at all talented or ambitious, he can receive further training through the various contests in declamation and debate. We learn in college how to think accurately and collect our ideas. The next step is to convey them to others. If in doubt, ask a man who has been a member for two or three years. Get a good start and get lined up at once.

New Library Regulations Adopted by Committee A List of Publications Found in Reading Room Is Given.

The library committee adopted a set of formal rules in 1923 and these are quoted below. The guiding spirit behind such matters as maintaining quiet, replacing papers on racks before leaving the room, and protection of papers from mutilation, is that of common courtesy, for which there are no written rules. The aim has been to keep the atmosphere of the library as high-toned as that of the home parlor, and with the same cooperation and goodwill as has been evident in the past, our library and reading room will be kept up to this standard.

Library Regulations:
The library will be open each weekday, in the college year, from 12 m. to 5:30 p.m. except during the dinner hour. Not more than four volumes are loaned except at the discretion of the librarian. No borrower shall retain a book for more than two weeks, but may renew a book for a second period of one week. The loan of books much in demand may be restricted by the librarian. A fine of five cents a day will be charged on books kept overtime, which the amount will be due on return of the books. A person expressing his desire for a book already lent will be notified of its return, when it will be held subject to his order for 24 hours. Any borrower may be notified that a particular book held by him has been applied for. Books may be taken from the library only after being duly registered. Anyone violating this rule will be fined for the first offense fifty cents, and on repetition of the offense will forfeit all library privileges until restored by the library committee. Any damage to or loss of books shall be made good to the satisfaction of the librarian. The librarian may withdraw from circulation all books needed for reference by classes or organizations. Such reserved books and the general reference books, and books of exceptional value shall not be taken from the library, except for short periods of time, not exceeding twenty-four hours. Unbound periodicals, except the current numbers, may be borrowed, subject to the same regulations that apply to books. Two such periodicals count as one book. No student shall receive a certificate of honorable dismissal from College, or shall be recommended for a degree until he has returned in good order, or replaced, every book that he has borrowed, and has paid all fines charged to him.

There is also given herewith a list of the more widely read magazines: "Life," "National Geographic," "Century," "Survey," "Popular Science Monthly," "Sewanee Review," "Scientific American," "North American Review," "Atlantic Monthly," "Outlook," "Scribner's," "Review of Reviews," "Bookman," "Educational Review," "Literary Digest," "Unpopular Review," "Popular Mechanics," "School Review," and "Scientific Monthly." In addition to the magazines, there are some twelve or fourteen daily newspapers.

THE DAVIDSON COLLEGE MAGAZINE.

A man may go to college and make a splendid record, and yet be of no service to the world, while another may have to dig his way and become a guiding star in his sphere of work. It depends upon his ability to benefit others who have not had the advantage of a college education, with his knowledge. There are two ways of imparting our ideas to others, and the first is by public speaking, which is cared for by our literary societies. The second is by writing fit literature for our magazines, and right here is the place to begin, with the Davidson College Magazine. It had to be stopped last spring because we did not have means to run both it and the Davidsonian. But with a greater number than ever here, it has a brilliant future. Professor Shumake is very much interested in it, and promises some literature from his English classes that comes up to the standard, especially from the special English. Let's help make Davidson a bigger, better Davidson by making our magazine the best in the South, with everyone doing his part.

I stole a kiss the other night,
My conscience hurt, alack!
I think I'll have to go tonight,
And give the darn thing back.
