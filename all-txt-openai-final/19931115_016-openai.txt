“There are a lot of growing pains in that,” Blake said, “but it's good to see that improvement to finish off the year.”

San Diego (13-6)

UCLA (18-2)

A few weeks ago, Blake instituted a large shift in the team’s strategy as she wanted more people to play the ball.

Cal. St. Fullerton (13-6)

“We were relying on one or two people to do it,” she said. “We wanted the setter to distribute the ball more evenly. And I’ve been pleased with how we’ve adjusted.”

The Wildcats must hope their regular season experiences prepared them enough for the tournament. “I’m pleased with [our last season],” Howard said. “We went through a lot of ups and downs. We played some really good teams. The level of competition has been real tough, but that only makes us better.”

The Final Four*

Midwest Winner

National

West Winner

After a full week of the NBA there are some interesting observations. The Bulls can still win without Jordan and Pippen, thanks to new arrival Tony Kukoc’s excellent play. How about that last second three-pointer for the win last Wednesday? He’ll probably be the Rookie of the Year. If not Kukoc, then Jamal Mashburn of the Dallas Mavericks.

East Winner

Champion

South Winner

The Charlotte Hornets have looked as good as they were predicted, sometimes. They still need to win the close ones versus the best teams. It looks like the year of the Knicks now that Michael Jordan is gone. Their frustration should finally come to an end.
