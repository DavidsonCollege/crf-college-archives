speak. It takes an entirely different set of enzymes to break down a fruit like an orange than it does
to break down a berry. It’s just better for digestion and is associated with proper technique for weight loss. The
main groups are 1) berries 2) citrus 3) fibrous, i.e. pears, apples, etc. 4) peaches, apricots, and fruits of this
nature. A variety of vegetables is also beneficial. Carrots every day won’t hurt, but aren’t nearly as good as a
little green, leafy veggies and legumes (yes, beans) thrown in there with them.

Three servings of milk. Milk is not high in fat, thereby not contributing to high cholesterol if you drink the
right kind. Whole milk is just nasty. You're not losing out on anything but pure fats by switching to skim
milk. If you find yourself thinking that skim milk is nothing but white water, try going down in degrees. Start
with two percent, move to one percent, then try skim milk again. Try whole milk again as well.

Sixty to seventy percent of the calories in ice cream come from fat with an average of seventy milligrams of
cholesterol per ounce. Ice cream is fine, of course, if you’re not taking in a lot of fat from other
sources. You still might consider getting frozen yogurt next time you’re at Carolina Cones, though. Everybody needs three servings of
milk, but women really need them. Only seven percent of our age group gets the amount needed, so unless something
changes, Liz and I aren’t going to be the only short people around here thanks to osteoporosis.

One serving of meats. Roast beef isn’t as good as turkey, but if it’s lean it’s not a big deal
either way. Corn beef is nasty stuff; as are hot dogs. They are very much processed foods which means the
fats and salts have been added before you even get near them with bacon slices. Poultry and fish are the
best, but pork, beef, or lamb three times a week is fine (especially if it contains no more than fifteen
percent fat).

All of the things above are things you should always try to eat. In addition, you can throw in your
processed foods and empty calories (alcohol, candy, pop). The good thing about maintaining the regimen above in some capacity is
that you will naturally consume less of these extras. There are some nevers, as well. Avoid real butter, an excess
amount of cream cheese (those little tubs are way too much), palm, coconut, and animal fat-based oils like the plague.

ment, and they welcome strangers to look and ask questions about this unique hobby. As a veteran balloonist, it is
the power to make people smile that keeps me coming back."

Balloonists’ Prayer
The winds have welcomed you with softness
The sun has blessed you with its warm hands
You have flown so high and so well
That God has joined you in your laughter
And set you gently back
Into the loving arms of Mother Earth.
