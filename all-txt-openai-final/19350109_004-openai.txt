As stated, one of the Four Davidson Profs. On Radio Program, Wilson was prominent in the literary society and a member of the baseball team. Perhaps the most interesting story of all: In 1916, Wilson was in North Carolina and concluded with the following legend of his old room. “Who's that?” he answered to a knock and replied: “Woodrow Wilson.” The freshman living in the room responded, “Come in, I'm Christopher Columbus!” When Wilson came in, it is said that the freshman jumped out of the window. McConnell spoke on “Woodrow Wilson and his Impact on the World” and pointed out that perhaps his match!

Add New Feature To Radio Program

Dr. Cumming Interviewed In Educational Sketch On The Modern Novel

A new educational feature was inaugurated last Friday night on the Davidson College program. Instead of having the program devoted entirely to music, part of the time was given over to an educational sketch by Dr. W. P. Cumming, B. O. Simpson, and Tom Wood. This sketch followed the playing of the theme “O Davidson” and “Largo” from the “New World Symphony” on the organ by Prof. Pfohl.

The sketch was an interview between a professor and two of his students as to what they should read. Dr. Cumming pointed out several reasons for the popularity of the novel and then went on to discuss several types of novels, giving examples of each type. He pointed out that one's reading should be directed to a definite end and not just done in a haphazard way. He offered to send to anyone sending him a self-addressed stamped envelope, a pamphlet about the novel and groups of novels. Prof. Pfohl then played “The Bells of Mary."

The program concluded with a performance of “Gavotte in St. Poeme” and “When You Come to the End of a Perfect Day.”
