Dear Ed:

A sense of unbearable jealousy which has been plaguing me ever since I was informed that you actually published a poem written by my sister Helen has led me to submit for publication my complete non-pornographic poetical works, which are exhausted by the following:

Land of a Thousand Na’s

na ja.

na schon.

na gut.

na na...

na na nana...

nana nana, na nana, nana na;
na nanana...

na endlich.

David Litaker

I am sure that I need not worry that the richness granted my work by bilinguality and allusion will be lost on your illustrious readers.

I should perhaps add that the title was supplied by my wife, who wished to remain anonymous, and that the poem is dedicated to Gabe Winkler, at whose shrine I once worshipped, and to David Lloyd, to whom, as far as I know, no shrine has yet been erected.

Sincerely,
Alan White
