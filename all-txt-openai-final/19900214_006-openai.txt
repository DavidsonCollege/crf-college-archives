### Learning to Appreciate Those A.T.s

By JESSICA THURBEE

Almost everybody at Davidson has some experience with an A.T. For some students, it is a pleasant experience. Other students may consider making voodoo dolls of their A.T.s. An A.T., otherwise known as an assistant or apprentice teacher, conducts sessions designed to help students develop their foreign language skills. Depending on the class, A.T.s meet with students between one and four times a week.

A.T.s are chosen the weekend before school starts. Students are told about auditions either by professors or by letter. The weekend begins with a workshop in which the students are given talks on effective teaching methods, as well as pointers on how to plan and conduct a session.

At the end of the workshop, the students write down what classes they would like to be an A.T. for. Then, the students are separated by language. They audition by performing a mock A.T. session for the professors. The professors then choose the students they want for their classes, with the best students usually getting their first choice for class. A.T.s are paid $4 per hour and for every hour they teach, they are paid another two hours for preparation.

The amount of experience each A.T. has varies; some started to learn a foreign language in college, while others have been speaking a language for as long as ten years. One need not major in a foreign language in order to be an A.T. The important prerequisites for an A.T. are good speaking skills, a good accent, and a firm grasp on the grammar of the language.

I talked to several A.T.s who gave a variety of reasons for participating in the program. David Shields, who teaches second semester Spanish this term, feels that, “It’s a good way to review the language and a great excuse to get up in front of people and act like a ham!” He also mentioned that he thought it would be fun and didn’t know about the money until after he had applied.

Katie Morrill is an A.T. for the second semester of intensive French this term. She decided to be an A.T. because, “It seemed like a good way to keep up my language skills, have fun, and meet new people.” According to Morrill, on average, it takes anywhere from thirty minutes to an hour to prepare for a lesson. “Sometimes, though, it can take longer than that; it just depends upon the lesson that you need to prepare.”

David Thompson received a letter over the summer inviting him to try out. He is an A.T. for German 102 this semester. Thompson chose to audition because he thought it would be a good experience and the extra money would be nice. Also, he is interested in a teaching career and this was a good way to get some practical experience in that area.

Jason Budde is an A.T. for French 201 this term. According to Budde, “We [A.T.s] have a lot of room in regard to how we conduct our sessions.” A.T.s know their professor’s syllabus, and they are expected to follow the workbook. However, it is up to the individual A.T.s to decide the most effective method for helping their students.

The professors vary on what they tell the A.T.s to do: some give them details about what they want done in the session, while others just turn the A.T.s loose. Jason uses situations and scenarios to help his students; he focuses on conversation. He feels this technique helps the most because it forces the student to utilize tenses, vocabulary and makes them think in the language.

The most important thing about an A.T., though, is that he or she is there for the students. All the A.T.s interviewed agreed that it is a good experience and a good feeling to know that they are helping others to understand another language.

### Black History Month Continues

Joseph Albright, president of Johnson C. Smith University, was the guest speaker at 11th Hour last week. Said Albright, the changing demography of America necessitates that society accommodate the needs and cultural contributions of ethnic minorities, as it is predicted that by the year 2000 the latter will comprise over 1/3 of the total U.S. population. Albright also shared some insights from his trip to South Africa recently.

### Students Tell of Their Winter Blahs

By KIM MUNSTERMAN and VIRGINIA MISCHEN

With the winter holidays but a distant blur in the past, and spring break an equally evasive event in the remote future, Davidson students have settled into perhaps the longest 60 days ever experienced by college students. On a chilly January evening in the E.H. Little Library, we interviewed students about their winter blahs:

Tom Tolbert ’90: “I wait a few days until it gets to be 70 degrees again.”

Jackie Carberry ‘92: “I try to get out and stay active, or get off campus every once in a while for dinner or a movie.”

Kearns Davis ’91: “I eat a lot.”

David Taylor ’91: “I do fun things like sitting around in my room, and if I’m feeling especially wild, I even come to the library and study.”

Betsey Bryan ‘90 and Laurie Crawford ’90: “Plan for spring break!”

Stacy Rooker ’92: “I like to review and revise my notes from last semester. I don’t get out much.”

Greg Robinson ’91: “Hot tea, long underwear and warm fires.”

George Lipscomb ’90: “Watch ‘The Simpsons.’”

Lee Canipe ’92: “I don’t get the winter blahs.”
