Davidson maintained its Southern Conference superiority this week, winning at Tennessee-Chattanooga (11-9; 5-4), 70-58, on Monday, and topping Appalachian State
(6-15, 2-7), 84-66, in Belk Arena on Saturday.

The Wildcat juggernaut, which now stands at 18-3 (9-0 in league play), has won 12 straight, the fourth-longest winning streak
in school history, and 15 of its last 16.

Davidson’s current record equals the team’s best start since 1969-70.

In the teams’ first meeting three weeks ago, the Mountaineers managed to stick with the Wildcats for much of the
first half, trailing by just one late in the period.

But Saturday was a different story, as the Wildcats used a 16-2 surge midway through the first half to claim
a comfortable 31-18 lead on their way to a 42-29 halftime count.

Ray Minlend scored eight of his 22 points during the run and Brandon Williams added six of his 24.

Quinn Harwood (21 points) and Narcisse Ewodo (10) also starred for Davidson.

The Belk crowd of 3132 saw much of the same in the second period, as Davidson upped its lead to
22 on a Williams jam with 15:09 left and coasted the rest of the way.

A Mark McGuire dunk off an Ali Ton dish provided the final 18-point margin.

Although the Mountaineers shot well, hitting 53.3% (24-45) of their field goals, Davidson shot more (32-61). Harwood, Minlend, and Williams
combined to shoot 24-for-32 from the field.

“I was very pleased with our [offensive] execution. We got a lot of great open looks, we got the ball
on the blocks, and we shot 50-plus percent from the floor,” said coach Bob McKillop.

The Wildcats continued their strong foul shooting as well, sinking 16 of 17 from the charity stripe.

But Davidson gained the decisive edge through turnovers. Appalachian State scored just 9 points off 14 Davidson turnovers, whereas the
Wildcats converted 24 of the Mountaineer miscues into 37 points.

“When you can generate that kind of offense out of turnovers, that means you’re getting easy offense,” McKillop said. “We’ve
been fortunate to get a lot of easy offense from transitional baskets.”

Kareem Livingston led the Mountaineers with 22 points on 10-for-13 shooting.

Davidson’s win Monday over UTC was its first ever triumph in Chattanooga and snapped the Mocs’ 29-game home conference winning
streak.

After holding a 21-10 advantage 11:17 in, the Wildcats settled for a 34-29 halftime score. The game remained relatively tight
throughout the second half, as the Mocs held the lead to single digits until a Mark Donnelly layup gave Davidson
a 65-54 lead with 4:48 left.

Another Donnelly lay-in and five points from Alpert down the stretch led the Wildcats to their eleventh straight win.

Alpert and Harwood tallied 16 points apiece, while Ewodo and Donnelly chipped in 12 and 11, respectively. Williams grabbed a
team-high 10 rebounds.

Wes Moore, the only Moc in double figures, notched 11.

Davidson travels to East Tennessee St. (7-12, 3-5) on Tuesday night for a 7 p.m. matchup and then hosts The
Citadel on Saturday at 2:30 p.m. Saturday’s game will be broadcast live on SportSouth. Don't miss it.

In addition to working on bringing international soccer to campus in the future, the Athletic Department is offering a series
of giveaways as the basketball season draws to a close.

By attending the men’s games on Feb. 17 against The Citadel and on Feb. 24 versus Marshall, you will qualify
for great free merchandise, the Mustang shoot-off, and TV awards up to $300. Plus, each men’s and women’s home contest
you attend between now and the end of the season earns you raffle tickets to be used in a drawing
for a new color TV at the men’s Marshall game.

Student tickets for the men’s and women’s conference tournament in Greensboro Feb. 28-Mar. 3 went on sale Monday, Feb. 5
in the ticket office for $30, half the normal cost. These tickets are part of the Davidson block allotted by
the Southern Conference and provide admission for all contests. Students will be able to move to the ends of the
Coliseum courtside whenever the Wildcats play.

There is a possibility that the Athletic Department will charter a bus to transport students to and from Greensboro during
the tournament. Anyone interested in this idea or in taking a bus to watch the Wildcats’ last game against Furman
Feb. 26 should contact Alec McAlister in the promotions and marketing office at 892-2375.

“The Athletic Department is just hoping to have a strong red and black presence (in Greensboro),” game management director Lee
Sargent said. “This should be one of the possibly great moments for Davidson basketball.”

Sargent also wanted to stress the importance of all students removing their cars from the Baker lot on the 17th
and 24th so there will be enough parking for the games on those days.

In other news, the college will host a high-profile soccer match pitting the US Women’s National Team against Germany on
Mar. 16. According to Sargent, this game features two of the premiere teams in the world, and it could be
a preview of the 1996 Olympic final.

It also previews action that could be seen at Richardson Field in June of 1999. Along with UNC-Greensboro, Duke, and
UNC-Chapel Hill, Davidson has been placed on a preliminary recommendation list of host sites for the Women’s World Cup. The
United States Soccer Federation has passed this list on to FIFA, soccer’s international governing body.

FIFA will tour sites in late spring and early summer to make its decisions, looking for loca-
