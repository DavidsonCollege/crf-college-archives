CLASS BASEBALL GETS UNDER WAY
SOPHS WIN FIRST GAME
Seniors Defeated in Uninteresting Game. Commissary Star.

Class ball on the Hill opened with a rush last week, when the Sophs trimmed the Seniors in one of
those hair-raising exhibitions. The final count was 4 to 3, it being anyone's game until the ninth when the Sophs
pushed across the necessary tally. The batteries of the day were: for the Seniors, Matthews and Brady. The “business manager”
had plenty of smoke—(like a Virginia Cheroot) and Sam was catching like smallpox. For the Sophs, “Bill” Roberts was on
the mound, with “Winch” Nash doing the receiving. The Sophs' scores came in the third, fourth, seventh, and ninth. The
Seniors' tallies came with a brace in the seventh and the last one in the ninth.

In the Seniors’ “Lucky Seventh,” Friend Wilson took one in the slats and got a free ride to first. Douglas
produced a single, and Matthews slammed one out for a double. Brady followed suit but “Bill” tightened up and retired
the side with no more damage. The ninth inning score for the Seniors resulted from a hit by Matthews, Brady’s
sacrifice, and a brace of errors on the Soph infield's part. The Sophs' winning run came in the ninth, when
with one man down, Irwin, M. reached first and then traveled to second as the sphere rolled through “Carl’s” legs.
He scored a moment later on an error, winning the game. The features of the game were the hitting of
Brady for the Seniors, and the all-around playing of Irwin, M. for the winners.

The score:
Seniors .......... 000 000 201—3
Sophomores ...... 001 100 101—4
Batteries: Matthews and Brady; Roberts and Nash.

GOLF CLUB SUFFERS DEFEAT AT HAND OF CHARLOTTE

On last Saturday afternoon, the Davidson Golf Club went down in defeat before the excellent Charlotte Club. The Charlotte men
played an excellent game, but the Davidson fellows easily out-drove them. Thrice Dr. McConnell proved that you can’t beat brains.
The greatest thrill of the game was enjoyed when he dropped one in the cup from the “small” distance of
fifty yards. Mr. Dowd was also good; he did the starring for Charlotte, and it was only through his good
playing that Davidson was defeated. Dr. McConnell, Prof. Wood, White, and Fricker composed the Davidson team, while Dowd, Pharr, Gibbon,
and Oldham were the players for Charlotte. The score was Davidson 205, Charlotte 200.

TENNIS TEAM TO MEET CAROLINA

Tennis enthusiasts will be glad to hear that Manager Spence has scheduled a match with the team from Carolina to
be held on April 30. The place has not been decided but there is a good chance of having these
games on the Hill. There will be two sets of singles and one of doubles. The students are assured by
Spence that if the games are held on the Hill, there will be no admission fee as the tournament last
fall was a great financial success. Those who will win for the honor of Old Davidson have not been chosen
but material is on hand that will show Carolina what real tennis is.

CLASS BASEBALL SCHEDULE ANNOUNCED

The class baseball games will be played as follows:
Seniors vs Juniors, April 20.
Sophs vs Fresh, April 21.
Sophs vs Seniors, April 22.
Fresh vs Seniors, April 27.

be the champion? Can you afford to miss Blue Ridge?

BAPTISTS BOW BEFORE (Continued from page 1)

second baseman who threw wild toward home in an attempt to cut off the runner. This allowed two men to
score. Then with Poe at bat, the squeeze play was worked and Richards scored. Wrenn scored on McArn’s bunt along
the first base line. In the second inning, Cassell walked and advanced a peg on Shepard’s single to center. Richards
then rolled a slow one through the whole Gold and Black infield which was playing in close, thereby scoring Cassell.
On the next...play, a bunt by Poe, both Shepard and Richards scored, Richards coming all the way from second. In
the third stanza, Huffstetler started the scoring by singling to center. He stole second and scored on Ratchford’s single. Cassell
doubled and scored Ratchford. Shepard and Richards drew walks, filling the bases. The squeeze play was again worked and again
both runners scored. In the sixth, Richards walked, was sacrificed to second, and scored on an error of McArn’s bounder.
