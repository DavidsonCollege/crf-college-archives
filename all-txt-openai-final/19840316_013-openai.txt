WE'LL PAY YOU TO GET INTO SHAPE THIS SUMMER.

If you have at least two years of college left, you can spend six weeks at our Army ROTC Basic
Camp this summer and earn approximately $600.

And if you qualify, you can enter the ROTC 2-Year Program this fall and receive up to $1,000 a year.
But the big payoff happens on graduation day. That's when you receive an officer's commission.

So get your body in shape (not to mention your bank account).

Enroll in Army ROTC. For more information, contact your Professor of Military Science.

BE ALL YOU CAN BE.
