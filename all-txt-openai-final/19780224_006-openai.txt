The Nauideanian February 24, 1978

Death stepped out, flowing leopard
her hair black, flashed her

ivory keys

and her perfume promised more
than just any end

her eyes quietly offered sympathy
So quiet

were hands like hers

whispers hushed fingers beckoned peace
written on each nail

but

the jester merely laughed madly
mockingly

rattled his chains till the rust
sprinkled his tattered suit
laughing all the while

her body claimed

no avail

grinning savagely

the jester smashed his key.
