1987 Program Reaches $35 Million Campaign Goal

The Davidson 1987 Program, a Davidson College capital campaign scheduled for completion during the college’s sesquicentennial in 1987, has exceeded its $35 million goal four years ahead of schedule. The announcement was made by former North Carolina Governor James Holshouser '56, who served as national chairman of the fundraising effort, which was the largest in Davidson’s history. Dean Rusk '31, former U.S. Secretary of State and a Davidson Rhodes Scholar in 1931, served as honorary chairman. Major gifts of $150,000 and $100,000 from two alumni pushed the total over the $35 million mark.

Discussing the success of the program, Interim President Frontis Johnston praised the “interest, concern, loyalty, and generosity of those who have grown to know and love Davidson College.” Vice-president for Development Jack Powers singled out one individual for special mention. “Much of the credit for the program’s success is due to President Emeritus Samuel Spencer Jr., who led the College throughout most of the campaign,” Powers said. Spencer served as Davidson’s president for 15 years before leaving last July to become president of the Virginia Foundation for Independent Colleges.

The Davidson 1987 Program was announced in 1976 “to help turn the college’s visions into realities,” as Holshouser said at the time. The original goals of the program were $19 million for endowment, $6 million for construction, and $10 million for annual support. The gifts and pledges actually received represent approximately $13.1 million in endowment and programmatic support, $9.3 million for construction of new facilities and renovation of existing buildings, and $12.6 million through annual giving and other unrestricted gifts.

The College renovated Martin Chemical Laboratory, built two new dormitories and a dining facility, and relocated its shop into renovated space behind the football stadium. But, because of unforeseen inflation rates and increases in the cost of higher education during much of the campaign, some of the program’s original goals could not be realized within the $35 million budget, Holshouser said. Because of this, the campaign will continue through 1987 as originally planned. “The success of the first phase of the campaign is gratifying until one considers the projects yet to be completed and the challenges that await us,” he said.

Several major building projects remain to be funded, including a visual arts facility, a sports center, and new facilities.

Grant Dies (Continued from page 1)

Junior Mike Tantillo said, “She always took the time to help students if they were having trouble in her course. That in itself doesn’t make her particularly unusual at Davidson, but what does separate her from many other professors is her interest in students’ lives outside the classroom.” Manning also said Grant managed to be “a loving wife and mother as well as a full-time professor.” She and her husband David Grant, also an associate professor of biology at Davidson, taught Davidson students in seminars at the Duke University Marine Laboratory in Beaufort, N.C. “Being willing to transplant your family to take students and do research requires a great deal of dedication,” Manning said. “And I think that’s commendable.”

“She was always fun to talk to, and if one was interested, she was sharpest in what she thought,” Manning said. “Discussions with her made me realize that she knew what she was doing and kept up with current developments in her field.”

Grant contributed to numerous organizations at Davidson, including the Graduate Scholarships and Fellowships Committee and the Minorities Committee. She was a member of the Davidson College Presbyterian Church, where she sang in the choir. A memorial service was held Saturday afternoon at 2 p.m. with Davidson College Presbyterian Church minister Charles E. Raynal officiating and music chosen and performed by Jane Cain. The family requested that in lieu of flowers, contributions be made to the Cynthia T. Grant Memorial Fund. Besides her husband, survivors include three daughters, Julia Grant, Emily Grant, and another daughter.

...to house the mathematics department, computer equipment, and selected academic disciplines. In addition, $6 to $12 million will be needed to complete several endowment projects currently underway. These include the Dean Rusk Endowment for International Studies, planned changes in the Humanities program, the continuation of the technology literacy program, and support of endowed professorships, student scholarships, and faculty development. These projects will require an additional $25 million, Holshouser said. Impetus from the campaign already has been credited with thrusting Davidson into the top ranks of college fundraising. Davidson is one of fewer than 20 coeducational liberal arts colleges across the country whose current gifts have totaled more than $3 million each year since 1977. In 1981-82 Davidson had the most successful fundraising year in its history when it received more than $6 million in current gifts, a figure that was nearly equaled in 1982-83. Joining Holshouser and Rusk in leading the campaign are Fred Stair, chairman of Davidson’s board of trustees; E. Craig Wall Jr., chairman of the development committee; Lunsford Richardson Jr., chairman of the major gifts committee; and Charles F. Myers, chairman of the corporate solicitation committee.
