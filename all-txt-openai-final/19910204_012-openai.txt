Are you kidding?! I've never seen anyone have so much fun in my life! You're going to cherish those memories
years from now!

There's the fundamental problem. I don't have any memories of this weekend.

KELL GREETING

THIS WAR WILL NOT BE A MISTAKE, AND WE WILL ADMIT IT.

THIS TIME WE WILL NEVER ADMIT WE MADE A MISTAKE.

If today is your birthday, you are one day older. Focus on negating the negative.

Aquarius (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): You are responsible for the downfall of the western world because you scapegoat.

Aries (March 21-April 19): Make it routine.

Taurus (April 20-May 20): Routine changes. You trip and fall.

Pisces (Feb. 19-March 20): You walk some of the knock.

Libra (Sept. 23-Oct. 22): You ain't nothing but a hound dog.
