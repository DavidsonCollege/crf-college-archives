### Temple Trio to Perform

Critics praise the Temple University Trio for their “keen ensemble sense,” and it is this quality that makes them excel in chamber music recitals. The rapport of pianist Alexander Fiorillo, violinist Helen Kwalwasser, and cellist Hirofumi Kanno creates “a precise and deeply felt performance” every time they play.

Their repertoire ranges from the rarely heard Beethoven Triple Concerto, performed with orchestras, to Charles Ives’ Trio. A recording of American music by Piston, Reigger, and Persichetti is available on Golden Crest Records, and a new recording featuring works by Arensky and Ravel is ready for release.

Trio in residence at Temple University, Fiorillo, Kwalwasser, and Kanno are members of Temple’s College of Music faculty. Each has concertized widely as a soloist and won numerous awards and prizes. The eloquence of the chamber group stems from the virtuosity of its individuals. But the cumulative effect of a performance by the Temple University Trio is one of unanimity and the greatest pleasure in one another's playing.

### Irish Lord Visits Campus

Lord Raymond O'Neill, T.D., D.L. of Shanes Castle, Co. Antrim, Northern Ireland, bears the hereditary title of what is considered to be Europe’s oldest traceable family, dating back to 360 A.D. As chairman of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, he is deeply interested in anything that will promote the tourist trade and holiday business—whether it be short or long term. Under his leadership, much has been accomplished in the expansion and improvement of all types of facilities to serve the tourist industry.

A man of many interests, his business acumen is widely appreciated. Since 1974, he has been chairman of the Royal Ulster Agricultural Society, which is indicative of one side of his activities; and he has also been a trustee of the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum. His business interests include the direction of an 850-acre working farm, and he serves on the board of Charles Hurst, Ltd., Lamont Life Insurance Co., and Victor, Ltd.—all of Northern Ireland. He is chairman of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.

Lord O'Neill is well known for his passion for steam engines and old motor cars, and for his ownership of 1½ miles of 8-foot gauge steam railway which runs through the estate of Shanes Castle. He is a patron of the Railway Preservation Society of Ireland, and his other hobbies include boating, gardening, water sailing, and tennis.

The Shanes Castle railway and a nature preserve on the O'Neill estate are open to the public and are a major attraction for visitors to the province.

Lord O'Neill will be on campus on Monday, October 9. His schedule will be as follows:
- 10 am. Public presentation: “The Culture of Ireland.” 900 Room.
- 2:15 pm. Informal conversation. Morrison Room.
- 6 pm. Open Dinner. Morrison Room. Sign up at the Union Desk. $1.00.
