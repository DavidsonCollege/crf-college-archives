REV. HENRY MORTON DIES OF PNEUMONIA
Alumni Are Saddened by the Death of One of Their Number
The friends and classmates of Rev. Henry Flournoy Morton, ’08, of Farmville, N. C., will be saddened to hear of
his death in New York City on the 14th of this month, after a brief illness with influenza-pneumonia. His body
was brought to his childhood home at Rocky Mount, N.C., where it was interred on Monday, the 16th.
During his career at Davidson, Mr. Morton was one of the leading men of his class, being a good all-round
man. He was especially prominent as a speaker and singer. Leaving Davidson, he entered Union Theological Seminary, from which institution
he graduated in the class of 1911. During his last year at the Seminary he married Miss Hassell. Since that
time, Mr. Morton has been engaged in work at his pastorate in Albemarle Presbytery, where he enjoyed a very successful
ministry. His loss is mourned by a large number of friends and acquaintances in that part of the state, as
well as elsewhere.

L. A. BAIN IS VICTIM OF PNEUMONIA
President of Senior Class of Presbyterian Theological Seminary Dies Following Attack of Influenza.
Funeral services of Lattie Alfred Bain, '16, who died of pneumonia following an attack of influenza, in the Presbyterian Seminary
at Louisville, Ky., on February 13, were conducted at Lebanon Church, Cumberland county, Monday afternoon by Rev. A. R. McQueen,
minister of the Presbyterian Church.
Mr. Bain was a member of and president of the Senior class of the Seminary, and lacked only two months
of completing his theological course. In the recent examinations he led the entire student body. He was 28 years of
age and a son of S. A. Bain, who recently moved to Dunn, from Wade, N. C. Speaking of him,
Rev. Mr. McQueen said that he had never known a finer young man; nor one who gave more promise of
usefulness in his chosen work. His fellow-students, both at Davidson and at the Presbyterian Seminary, were impressed with his sturdiness
of character and his excellence as a man. Mr. Geiss, of the faculty, accompanied the body home. Mr. Bain is
survived by his father, two brothers and three sisters.

DR. J. P. MUNROE ELECTED PRESIDENT OF TRI-STATE MEDICAL SOCIETY

Dr. John P. Munroe, of Charlotte, one of the leading physicians of the Carolinas, was elected president of the Tri-State
Medical Association at its recent two days’ meeting in Charlotte, and presided over the final session of the twenty-second convention,
which closed last Thursday night. Dr. Munroe was president of theNorth Carolina Medical College at Davidson, N.C., and was later
college physician for some time.

SOME SENIORS MUST DEMONSTRATE SPEAKING ABILITY ALSO
A few Seniors are lucky enough to be in the limelight this week. Those members of this year’s graduating class
who have, for various reasons, not made both their Junior and Senior speeches will make them this week. They will
be made at 8 p.m. Wednesday, February 25. Those speaking are:
Allison, R. T., “Transportation in the Air.”
Douglas, D. I., “Greatest Sporting Proposition in the World.”
Jamison, J. M., “The Spirit of Unrest.”
Robinson, A. G., “The Fate of Kaiser Bill.”
Sanders, J. F., “Elizabethan Literature.”
Sutton, P. G., “War Is Hell.”
Tremain, M. A., “Bolshevism.”
Wilson, T. H., “The Red Cross.”

R. R. CLARKE, ‘19, ELECTED DEACON
Not long ago, just four weeks and a half, to be exact, R. R. Clarke, ’19, was made a deacon
of the Estill Presbyterian Church. When “Rufus” was at Davidson he was a leader in the athletic world. His pitching
was the backbone of our baseball team last spring. As a pillar of the church, we feel confident that “Railroad”
will make his rise in civil life just as surely as he did in college. He is at present working
in the Commercial Bank, of Estill, S.C., in the capacity of assistant cashier.

A “DRY” TOAST.
There’s a laugh in the NAME,
There’s a smile in the brew:
There's the taste of the same
We drank long ago, too.
It functions just right,
For it’s full of good cheer,
It’s a nation’s delight,
For it’s NOT a “near beer.”
It brings words to the tongue,
And a light to the eye,
While from memory’s wrung
Thoughts of glad days gone by.
Here’s a toast to the old,
That we drink with the new
MINNEHAHA, that’s sold
As a real lagered brew.
