**DOLE’S WORK CONTINUES**

Football season may be over, but Coach Bill Dole’s work has just begun. The Wildcat mentor left this week in search of high school football talent who may be interested in coming to Davidson next year.

Dole has his work cut out for him. Recruiting is not an easy task for Wildcat coaches. High school kids tend to be more easily persuaded by big-name schools and more money. And yet, there seems to be a rise in intellectual interest by today’s young people—even the athletes. Ask Lefty Driesell, who recently told a Rotary Club meeting in Charlotte, “You have to offer a boy a good education, as well as an athletic scholarship today.”

Last Saturday's game concluded Dole’s tenth season at the Davidson helm. Participating in a conference in which the average enrollment of the other eight schools is 4,225 (Davidson has 975 students), Dole has compiled a respectable record of 36 wins, 50 losses, and 1 tie. Of the seven Southern Conference coaches who have been in the league more than one year, Dole has the 4th best won-lost percentage (.420). He has produced a winning team five times in ten years, and this season he broke even. His biggest win came last season when his team upset heavily favored VPI, 12-7, in Blacksburg, Va.

**SIMPSON PLAYING; WHAT ARE PUNTS**

Tom Simpson, Davidson’s offensive center last year, is now playing ball for the Louisville Raiders, a semi-pro team in the same league that Johnny Unitas spent a few years before returning to the Baltimore Colts. Simpson was drafted by the San Francisco 49ers of the NFL.

**ALABAMA**

The nation’s top-ranked team, Alabama, supposedly had its best defense in the Southern Conference going into that game. The Tide made fun of that statistic by gaining 616 total yards during the afternoon.

**BILL SALZER and BOOKER CLARK** were elected co-captains for this year’s football team at the squad banquet last night. Salzer, a 245-lb. tackle from St. Petersburg, Fla., was a mainstay on the defensive line. Clark, from Statesville, N.C., is known for his hard-nosed play at defensive end, and he caught 3 TD passes this year.

**ALL-CONFERENCE SELECTIONS** will be announced pretty soon. Just guessing, we’d say the following have a good chance to be on the list: ends, Andy Guida (GW) and Bill Gilgo (Citadel); tackles, John Tew (Furman) and Joe Teefey (Richmond); guards, Ed Harrington (Citadel) and Claude Davis (Furman); center, Don Christman (Richmond); quarterback, Bill Canty (Furman); halfbacks, Earl Stoudt (Richmond) and Dick Drummond (GW), and fullback Tom Campbell (Furman). Best prospects from Davidson to make second team or honorable mention include tackle Bill Salzer, center Bruce Usher, end-halfback Jerry Sheffield, quarterback Earl Cole, and halfback Alex Gibbs.

**THE CRYSTAL BALL**

Last week’s perfect score of 8 rights, 0 wrongs pushed our crystal ball’s season record to 37-18. With only six games remaining to be played by conference teams, we'll have to have another perfect ballot to reach the .700 mark, a respectable average in this year of upsets. So we see the final games of 1961 as follows: Furman Coach Bob King says he can beat Clemson in Death Valley this Saturday, but we don’t believe him. Pick the Tigers by 28-12. Other games this weekend: The Citadel 91, Arkansas St. 15; GW 15, VPI 14; and Indiana 14, West Virginia 6. On Thanksgiving Day, we see Richmond 35, William & Mary 13; and VPI 7, VMI 0 in their traditional clash.

Injury-Riddled ’Cats Have Last Chance to Face Hoopsters

The Davidson basketball team opens its season on Saturday night, December 2, in Winston-Salem’s Memorial Coliseum against the Wake Forest Demon Deacons. The frosh teams from each school will clash prior to the varsity game. Wake Forest, who has been ranked as third in the nation on some pre-season polls, will be out to avenge last year’s game at Davidson that the ’Cats took, 65-59. After recovering from that initial shock, the Deacons went on to be Atlantic Coast Conference champions.

**ALL-AMERICAN**

The Deacons are spearheaded by All-American candidate Lonnie Chappell, a 6'8", 240-lb. center. Other outstanding players are guards Bill Packer and Dave Wiedeman, forwards Bill Hull and Richard Carmichael, and reservist Tommy McCoy. Carmichael, a sophomore from High Point, N.C., was a teammate of Wildcat forward Lemon.

Davidson fans had plenty to cheer about last Saturday afternoon as they watched an inspired Wildcat football team thoroughly whip a talented Wofford club, 34-13. Coach Bill Dole’s team was not to be denied an even won-lost record this year as they were last season. Going into the final game a year ago, the 'Cats had a 4-4 record and blew a chance to break even when Furman scored two TDs with less than five minutes to play for a 22-21 comeback victory. But this year was different. A Charlotte-Mecklenburg Day crowd of 5,500 witnessed a rejuvenated Wildcat offense, sparked by quarterback Earl Cole’s passing, halfback Jerry Sheffield’s running, and fullback Jim Fuller’s running, amass a grand total of 449 yards. In addition, an inspired defensive unit, spearheaded by Mickie Slaughter, Bill Salzer, Eddie Crutchfield, Russell Walls, and Bruce Usher, limited the highly-touted Terrier offense to a mere 28 yards rushing. And so a Davidson team that had the potential to explode all season finally did. Had it done so a little earlier, this year might have been a winning season. Although 13 seniors depart from this year’s squad, Dole has some excellent material returning. Among the top returnees will be Cole, Fuller, and Alex Gibbs in the backfield, with Slaughter, Crutchfield, Walls, and Usher on the line.

**Hines Is Captain Of All-Star Team**

Ed Hines got 76 out of a possible 84 votes and is captain of this year's LF All-Star flickerball team. Hines, SAE star, is a senior from Greensboro, N.C. Right behind with 75 votes was Kappa Sig Johnny Rogers, last year’s All-Star captain. The Phi Delts placed three men on the first team and one on the second to lead all teams in that department. The 1961 All-Star flickerball team is as follows:

**FIRST TEAM**

- Ed Hines, SAE
- Johnny Rogers, Kappa Sig
- Andy Sherrill, Phi Delt
- Nat Harris, Phi Delt
- John Sharp, KA
- Graham Showalter, SX
- John Harris, Phi Delt

**SECOND TEAM**

- Harry Smith, SAE
- Billy Mills, Beta
- Tom Hamilton, Beta
- Haynes Kelly, KA
- Harry Cline, SX
- Johnny Almond, Kappa SigLefty Driesell is optimistic as the season nears. His team has displayed tremendous potential in scrimmages, plus desire and hustle.

Davidson also ranks 2nd in the conference. But total defense is 6th with a 274.6 average. The Wildcats are at a disadvantage in that they have only 8 games in which to accumulate yardage, while all other conference teams play a 10-game slate.

Harriers Run in Conference Meet
The cross-country team travels to Lexington, Va., Monday for the Southern Conference Meet which will be run on host VMI's course. VMI is defending champion and the Keydets are co-favorites this year with Furman. The Paladins have probably the top runner in Jim Patterson, who will have to push to beat VMI's Charles Carlton. Davidson finished fifth last year and Coach Heath Whittle expects little if any advancement on Monday. Martin, who was 8th a year ago, is the 'Cats' brightest hope.

Handicapped by several injuries, nevertheless determined, the 'Cats pull into the homestretch, traveling to Emory tomorrow for the season finale. They take with them a 4-4-1 record and their last chance for a winning season. But they leave behind Tom Green, Bob Neldrum, and goalie Jamie McCutchen, all new additions to the injury list. Furthermore, George Kundahl and Harrison Wellford will not make the trip because of special academic commitments.

Sun. after Monday's match with Duke's Fogelman, sees other snares in ranks. "Our biggest problem," he says, "is getting good long kicks past midfield. We've got fast backs, but we're not using them." Another late-season ailment, especially prevalent in the defeat to Duke, seems to be developing—fourth-quarter fizzle. Well into the third quarter, the 'Cats put together a good match against the Blue Devils. The score at halftime was 2-1. But by the end of the fourth quarter, the 5-1 score had erased all indication of the earlier slim margin. Can the booters shake off their blight and wind up a winning season? It's our last chance," says Fogelman, and they know it.

The Davidson swim team opens its season on Dec. 2 in the pool. The team is paced by Stefan Young, sophomore; Lupsbert; Tommy Whittington, and others.

Sheffield Finishes Career With 3 TD’s
BY BILL PRIDGEN
Davidsonian Sports Writer

Last Saturday marked the final and probably the best football game in the college career of Jerry Sheffield, senior halfback from Sebring, Fla. In a game that saw excellent performances by several players including Earl Cole, Duncan Morton, Jim Fuller, Mickie Slaughter, and a host of others, Sheffield’s outstanding running was most noticeable. This is particularly impressive since Sheffield has played most of the season as an end, and only moved into the halfback slot for the William and Mary game. Sheffield gained 133 yards offensively for Davidson, 63 of which were gained on a long scoring play in the fourth quarter, the longest gain from scrimmage for a Davidson player all season. Sheffield also added two other scores which accounted for 18 of the Wildcats’ 34 points, making him the team’s leading scorer with 36 points. The scoring column was opened by Sheffield early in the second quarter when he was on the receiving end of an Earl Cole pass. In the fourth quarter, he scored twice on runs from scrimmage to sew up the victory over Wofford. All in all, it was a wonderful way to end a football career.

The LF wrestling meet will be held in the gym Monday and Tuesday nights. All entrants must weigh in by 4 p.m. on Monday. The SAE’s are defending wrestling champs.
