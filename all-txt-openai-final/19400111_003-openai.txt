Question of the Week

Without a doubt, the leading topic of discussion in campus “bull sessions” (with the possible exception of exams) is the coming Mid-Winters Dance Set. The main question is in regard to the music, which is to be furnished by Bob Chester and his orchestra. Many students seem to have been hoping for one of three top “name” bands. Here are their reactions to the question: “What do you think of Bob Chester and his orchestra for the Mid-Winter Dance Set?”

Claude Hackney, Sophomore: Since the distinctive style of Glenn Miller has won over music lovers of both sweet and swing, the selection of a band whose music is modeled after his should be safe. Having heard numerous recordings of Bob Chester and his orchestra, I feel certain that they will have music that should satisfy the most energetic jitterbug enthusiast while those who cater to the sweet and simple will be equally pleased with his arrangements of their old favorites. I, for one, congratulate the committee for a wise investment. Although at present the band of Bob Chester is not enjoying nation-wide popularity, he is constantly gaining new fame with his novel arrangements of both old and new tunes. So at a later date when Chester has gained a top-ranking berth, we may be proud to say that Bob Chester played for the Davidson Mid-Winters of 1940.

Jim McDonald, Junior: I think we are lucky to get such a fine band for the price of the dances. All it lacks is an impressive name. It plays fine arrangements, both sweet and swing, and plenty of them. Personally, I would rather get a kick from a fine young band than be bored to tears with slurping saxes and electric guitars just so I could go around bragging that we had Lombardo or Sammy Kay.

Neal Scott, Senior: Since the Pan-Hellenic Council, through no fault of their own, was unable after exhaustive efforts to procure a top-flight name band, I think they could have made no better choice than Bob Chester. Chester’s orchestra is certainly one of the coming bands of the nation. His style is similar to Glenn Miller's, which should assure him success on the Davidson campus.

Kem Wilson, Sophomore: Bob Chester is about as good a band as we could ask for. From the general trend of opinion, I gather that Glenn Miller and Tommy Dorsey are the favorites. Bob sounds a lot like Glenn Miller and also has a style somewhat like T. Dorsey. Since we can't get them, why not Chester? I think he will live up to his present reputation of the “new sensation of the nation,” possibly taking Glenn Miller's place by next year.

Tom Crighton, Senior: Although we are not having the top name in an orchestra, we have an imitation of the smooth style of a great band at a reasonable price. This music should give us four fine Mid-Winters dances, but let's hope enough money is made to have Glenn Miller himself for our last set.

W. C. Plunkett, Sophomore: Like all questions invariably do, this one has two sides. While some of us are disappointed that we didn’t get a big-name band to please our girls, the saving of $1.50 isn't to be overlooked. And as long as the music is pretty good, we will all have a swell time. I’ve heard lots of boys say they enjoyed the Dean Hudson dance as much as the Hal Kemp last year. This should leave us a good opportunity to have better bands for the succeeding sets this year. I'm not in favor of having all the fun at one time!

George Coates, Senior: I heartily approve of the selection of Bob Chester to play for Mid-Winters. Although he hasn’t the name as yet, he has an up-and-coming band that offers excellent music at the price Davidson can afford to pay. His style is very much like Glenn Miller's, which should appeal to practically all of the students. If this set is successful, maybe the Pan-Hellenic Council can secure a name band for one of the sets in the spring.

Crane Gets Recognition

Local Poet’s Works Are Included in “Yearbook Of Modern Poetry”

Paul S. Crane, of the Davidson student body, is one of the authors whose poems are included in the “Yearbook of Modern Poetry, 1939,” a 700-page volume just published.

Many Compete

More than 11,000 poets living in every part of the United States and Canada competed for a place in this important volume; only a few hundred of these were found to write poetry of sufficient merit to be accorded a place in this book. The volume contains the work of little-known authors as well as that of writers who have been published in many magazines and books. Crane knew nothing about the compiling of this book until he received a letter asking him to send some of his best work for consideration. He did so and two of his poems were selected. He started writing poetry about a year ago, and as yet has no definite style, having never studied this particular phase of literature in course. Crane is a Junior here and has been very active in Y. M. C. A. activities and is a member of the “Y” Cabinet. He is also a member of the Philanthropic Literary Society and is majoring in Chemistry. His home is in Heizu, Korea, where his parents are missionaries of the Southern Presbyterian Church. He has had several of his poems published in the “Scripts and Pranks.” A similar volume is now being compiled and poets who are interested in having their work considered for the new book should write to the publishers for information: Avon House, 407-409 Broadway, New York City.

Match Cover Hoax Exposed

Letter Explains Hoax About “Seeing-Eye” Dog; Match Covers Still Here

Another letter was received on January 2 by Sam Spencer concerning the match cover rumor for a Seeing Eye Dog. Mr. D. J. Hartwell of New York City was the sender of the letter.

Erroneous Report

Mr. Hartwell, who represents the headquarters of the Seeing Eye Corporation of Morristown, New Jersey, stated that he had read a clipping from the Greenville News Leader headed “Wanted, Match Covers.” He stated further that he regretted deeply that such an erroneous report could have become circulated that a blind person could procure a Seeing Eye Dog by the collection of a given number of match covers. He appealed to Sam Spencer, as President of the Student Body, to notify all the Davidson men of the true facts in the case. He went further to state that the entire company deeply regretted that so many blind persons had become disappointed by such a cruel hoax. He added that if any blind person was desirous of obtaining a Seeing Eye Dog, the proper procedure would be to apply directly to the corporation headquarters in Morristown.

Covers Still Here

Several thousand match covers were collected during the drive which was staged here at Davidson, by means of boxes placed about the business section, in the dormitories, and other convenient places. According to Spencer, the match covers are still here, and the method of their disposal is as yet undetermined.

Inaugural Speeches

In the library case is a collection of speeches which has been placed there by the Philanthropic Literary Society, under the direction of Jack Abernathy, President. Included in this group of papers are many that are of interest because of their perfect script. The writing is elaborate and shaded. Not satisfied with neat manuscripts, the authors of days gone by embellished the cover pages of the speeches with spidery printing not often seen in our days of hurry and carelessness. Several of the manuscripts are beautified by blue ribbons with long streams which serve to hold the papers together.

There are a number of Inaugural Addresses made by various persons familiar to us who have been Presidents of this society. Among these is the speech of Dr. William J. Martin, then President of Davidson College, who has just returned home to Davidson to make his speech. This speech is dated 1888. Similarly, there is the speech made by K. Brown at his inauguration in 1921. The prize-winning essay of 1882 is on display. This essay was written by Egbert W. Smith, present Secretary of Foreign Missions of the Southern Presbyterian Church. The Respondent Address, delivered by the Junior Class, given at the Commencement exercises in 1906, is also in the exhibit. The oldest of the manuscripts in the case is that of Gaither, written in 1872.

**Flying Club Sees Radio**

Bob Miller demonstrated his new portable radio equipment at the meeting of the Flying Club last Monday night. This equipment, about the size of a regular portable radio, picks up standard and short wave broadcasts. It is equipped with earphones to pick up flying beams. He explained in a lecture the method of determining the plane’s location by cross beams. He also showed how to pick up weather reports.

**DAVIDSON, N. C.**

**Sapps Have A Daughter**

Mr. and Mrs. Hugo Sapp of Davidson announce the birth of a daughter, Mary Penelope, on December 30, 1939. From the second name, Penelope, comes the nickname Penny, which has taken preference to either of the double names or the two names together.

**Much Photographed**

Penny has already become accustomed to being the center of attention. Three times in her first week her picture was taken. One particular pose caught this young lady at the peak of a yawn. Report has it that she is not the least bit camera shy; in fact, she seems to like all the attention.

**New Penelope**

Penelope, who is a thriving youngster of thirteen days, laughs at her mere seven and one-half pounds of weight which she had at birth. Mrs. Sapp was formerly Miss Thompson and students remember her as a part-time nurse in the infirmary. Mr. Sapp, known as Hugo to Davidson students, is the proprietor of the College Pharmacy.

**Rev. Murray Speaks On Youth Convention**

**Youth Conference, Held To Study Ways to Live The Christian Life**

Rev. J. J. Murray, D.D., of Lexington, Va., was the speaker at Davidson’s Sunday night vespers. He spoke, by request, on the subject of the World Youth Conference held last summer in Amsterdam. The object of this conference, according to Dr. Murray, was to have young people from all over the world make a study of the ways by which it is possible to live the Christian life in our world of today.

**Describes Hall**

Dr. Murray gave a description of the main assembly hall of the Conference. He said that the first thing to catch his eye was a large banner bearing the words Christus Victor (Christ the Victor). The flags of the nations of the world were placed around the hall, and many men prominent in world affairs were seated on the stage. The 1350 delegates were seated on the main floor according to the countries from which they came. Practically every nation of the world was represented at this, the first world conference of youth ever held. The four nations notably unrepresented were Germany, Russia, Mexico, and Spain, although there were Germans present unofficially. Dr. Murray said that only three languages were officially used at the Conference: French, German, and English. Manuscripts were published in each of these languages of every speech that was made, so that it was possible to follow all the speakers.

**Harmony Felt**

According to Dr. Murray, the outward mark of this Conference was that these young people had everything in the world to separate them; but the deep inward mark was one of harmony and fellowship. Christian fellowship was emphasized, and the making of long speeches was de-emphasized, their place being taken by small study groups. The delegates were divided into forty-three discussion groups, each of which studied the Bible and one of eight other optional topics. Dr. Murray said that the most important things to come out of these groups were a clearer vision of the Church, a realization of the fellowship of World Christians, a sympathy for one another, and an idea of the greatness of our Christian inheritance. These groups were small enough to ensure thoroughness.
