**Houses To Hold Rush**

By RICHARD WILSON
Asst. Managing Editor

Representatives from five national fraternities decided Tuesday night to hold a rush program for freshmen during the winter term. The
group also made an unwritten agreement that bids would not be given out to freshmen until the ambiguity of the
present situation is clarified.

“The feeling is we want to have a rush in order to give freshmen the opportunity to join a fraternity,”
said Jim Cantrell, a spokesman for the group. The five houses announced that they will hold an informal open house
Nov. 5 and Nov. 18 during which freshmen will be invited down to discuss fraternities and the social system at
Davidson.

“Our purpose in having this open house is to explain to the freshmen our opinions on what the new system
would be like,” he said. The fraternities involved are Alpha Tau Omega, Phi Delta Theta, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Sigma Nu,
and Sigma Phi Epsilon.

In a meeting with freshmen in Hodson Hall Wednesday, Vice President of Academic Affairs John M. Bevan asked fraternities to

Vice President of Academic Affairs John M. Bevan agreed Wednesday to allow freshmen to sit on the committee dealing with
changes in the social system. Responding to arguments that College President Samuel R. Spencer Jr. had stated that this year’s
Freshman Class would be consulted about the social change, Bevan agreed to enlarge the committee to include the President and
Vice President of the Freshman Class.

Bevan said that when he formed the committee he was unaware that Spencer had made this commitment. “If Dr. Spencer
said freshmen should be represented, I will honor his commitment,” he said.

The full committee now consists of 18 members. Representing the administration are Dean of Students Richard C. Burts, Director of
the College Union C. Shaw Smith, Treasurer Robert A. Currie, and Bevan. The four appointed representatives from the Faculty Executive
committee are Alexander J. McKelway, Frank W. Bliss Jr., A. Allen Wolf, and John D. Kelton.

Student Senate President Ran Coble will represent that body along with Cecil Burney, Kim Griffith, and Bob Meadows. The fraternity
presidents chosen to represent Patterson Court on the committee are Jack Caldwell, Phi Delta Theta; Glenn Mauney, (See FRATERNITY, P.

**Campaigners Boost Blue**

By JEFF ALLENDER

Pushing for a “more rational defense policy” from Congressional representation, the Davidson chapter of the Movement for a New Congress
(MNC) is engaged in a door-to-door canvas campaign for H. Clifton Blue. Blue, a moderate Democrat, is opposing Earl Ruth,
a conservative Republican, for the Congressional seat from North Carolina’s Eighth District, which includes Kannapolis and Salisbury.

Handing out literature and answering questions residents may have about Blue, as well as providing transportation to the polls for
voters on election day, are the main duties the group has been working on, according to MNC chairman Whit Ayres,
a junior.

“We’ve been concentrating on Concord in our can- Buchanan Sees ‘Charity Economy’ By‘DAVID HANIG Staff Writer

“A social order which allows parasites to exist within it faces destruction unless it establishes limits on the numbers of
parasites. Modern man has been, thus far, incapable of preventing his exploitation by the parasites.”

Thus Dr. James M. Buchanan, professor of economics and director of the Center for the Study of Public Choice at
Virginia Polytechnic Institute, stated the problem of the charity-giver and the recipient. Buchanan spoke Wednesday on ‘The Dilemma,’ which dealt
with the problem of deriving the maximum social value from charity.

The Samaritan can either give or not give; however, his utility function (his nature) requires that he give. The parasite
knows this and will try to get as much as he can,” Buchanan said. The tendency in Western culture, according
to Buchanan, is for the parasite to live entirely off the charity of the Samaritan.

James Buchanan describes the plight of The Good Samaritan. “The parasite knows that the Samaritan could not bear his starving
to death, so the parasite stops working and usually receives increased charity,” he said.

The best situation, he suggested, was one in which the parasite works and receives charity. To maintain this situation, the
Samaritan must decide to withhold all charity if the parasite does not work. “Since the Samaritan cannot stand the suffering
of the parasite, the only way that he can resist the temptation to continue giving is to rely on a
rule which would be invoked automatically without thought,” Buchanan stated.

Buchanan decided that people directly involved in the parasite’s situation, like social workers, ought not to decide who will receive
charity or not because they are the people most actually caught in the Samaritan’s dilemma. “If the Samaritan succeeds in
keeping the parasite at work,” he said, “any parasite who follows the first one will know that they have to
work.”

Society, as a whole, according to Buchanan, has been unwilling to force its parasites to work.

“We really don’t have enough people to cover much bigger an area,” Ayres said. “By election time, we will have
been to just about every house in Concord. We've had around 17 different guys working on the campaign at different
times, and others have expressed an interest,” commented Ayres. “Our turnout has probably been hurt by the lack of a
charismatic liberal candidate—the issue here is getting a real arch-conservative out of office.

“Because of our limited numbers and time, we have stressed the brief approach, where we hand out a pamphlet, but
do not push the issues. We answer questions if asked, but the most effective means of campaigning we can contribute
is that of making as many people as possible familiar with Blue’s name and candidacy,” Ayres added.

“It seems as though we’re having a good effect in the campaign. The reactions we’ve received have been surprisingly favorable.
I can count the cases on one hand where we have encountered a bad reaction from people,” Ayres said. “And
in most of these cases, the people, if hostile, were hostile toward the political system and candidates, not toward the
students.”
