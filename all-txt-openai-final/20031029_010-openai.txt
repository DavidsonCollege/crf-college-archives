#### Men's Soccer Prepares for SoCon Postseason Play

With the Southern Conference tournament only three weeks away, the men's soccer team finds itself at a crucial point in the season. Coming off a close loss to #3 North Carolina and an important 1-0 win over conference rival Furman this past week, the 'Cats now have two of their toughest opponents left to face: South Carolina and Wake Forest. As head coach Matt Spear noted, “South Carolina is a big-time program and we last won there in 1999. Wake Forest is, in my opinion, one of the top-five teams in the nation; they are unbelievably talented and are coming off a 4-0 thumping of North Carolina.”

In order for the 'Cats to win either game, they must attack from the beginning like they did against UNC and must convert on their scoring opportunities. Co-captain Justin Porter ’04 sees these games as “great building blocks for us to fine-tune our attack and to continue to rely on intense defense to make a run at the NCAA tournament.” In order to make it to the NCAA tournament, though, Davidson must make it past the SoCon tournament, unless they want to hold out for an at-large bid (in which they were unsuccessful last year, as an early exit from the tournament prematurely ended the season and Davidson’s chances to make it past the semis). As Jeff Davis ’06 said, “After the disappointment from last year’s tournament, I think everyone is anxious to get back to Charleston and prove that we are the best team in the Southern Conference.”

Right now, the tournament favorites are College of Charleston, UNC Greensboro, and Davidson, but, as Spear remarked, you should definitely “not count out Furman due to their stellar history in tournament play. The Southern Conference Tournament will be particularly exciting this year because of the increased parity. Part of the change is that Furman is no longer the undisputed leader, and with Elon replacing VMI and the Citadel, the overall quality of the teams top to bottom has improved.”

The team knows all too well that rankings going into the tournament do not matter once the tourney begins, as they found out two years ago with a stunning first-round loss to Georgia Southern. If the Wildcats continue to play with the same aggression and control developed throughout the past weeks, they should be a serious contender for the SoCon title and for NCAA tournament upsets. As Porter confidently stated, “Do not be surprised to see Davidson claiming a SoCon crown and making a run deep into the NCAA’s. These guys are ready to step it up to the next level.”

and inspirational, and he is now making a major impact for us on the offensive side of play.

“Justin Porter is the heart and soul of this team. You never have to worry about his focus or motivation; it’s there every day. He treats each game like it will be his last, and that is why he is such a great leader, on top of being an amazing student.

“Keith Nicholson was a gift as a transfer student and quelled any questions as to his ability to adjust academically with a 4.0 GPA in his first semester. On the field, Keith’s dribbling, defending abilities, and flexibility have helped us in several positions, and he has always been one of the team’s most athletic and technical players.

“As a converted midfielder, Nick Hansell has learned the art of being a dangerous and prolific forward through his natural ability. There are moments in games when Nick just takes over, despite constant and tight marking by oneor more opposing defenders. He was born with the ability to score, but that talent has been honed by dedication and development. “Shihab Sugeir represents much of what is special about Davidson Soccer. A talented, hard-working keeper, Shihab’s work ethic and dedication to the team is second to none and a tremendous statement on Shihab as a role model, leader, and person of character.”

North Carolina 1 Davidson 0

In front of 2000-plus fans, the men’s soccer team suffered a heart-wrenching 1-0 loss to #3 North Carolina Wednesday night. Both teams were out to prove something: UNC not wanting to repeat last year’s loss at home, and Davidson trying once again to prove their ability to beat top-ranked teams. The first 27 minutes of play boasted beautiful soccer on both sides, with controlled, precise passes and amazing footwork, particularly by co-captain David Peoples ’04 for the Wildcats. Numbers and ranks were forgotten as Davidson aggressively attacked the UNC defense.

Unfortunately, the electric atmosphere culminated in a goal—not for Davidson, but for UNC. At the 27:25 mark on a free kick, UNC player Ray Fumo played the ball into the Davidson box on a free kick, where teammate Tim Merritt, off a perfectly-timed run, redirected the pass just past Davidson keeper Bart Creasman ’05. As Preston Davis ’06 stated, “The goal caught us a bit by surprise because we felt like we were dictating the play of the game.” Whether it was shock from the goal or fatigue from the hard-fought first 27 minutes, the ’Cats seemed to lose some of their confidence and control after the disappointing goal, and they recorded only two more shots for the rest of the half.

Davidson emerged from halftime with a greater sense of urgency and immediately began attacking the Tarheels; however, even with four corner kicks and seven shots, the ’Cats could not find the back of the net. Their best effort came midway through the second half, with senior midfielder Keith Nicholson’s near finish from 10 yards inside the box. Despite the offensive efforts, the real MVP of the game for Davidson was Creasman. Tallying six saves for the game, all coming in the second half and many on one-on-one sprawling stops, Creasman limited UNC to only one goal and kept Davidson in the game. As Peoples noted, “Bart has been tremendous all season. It really isn’t surprising when he makes those types of saves because we know he can and we almost expect him to. The second half was all his.”

Even though the ’Cats suffered the loss, head coach Matt Spear sees the game as “a great game and a tremendous example of quality college soccer. The crowd was electric. I’m proud of the guys; they came out assertive and really took it to North Carolina.”
