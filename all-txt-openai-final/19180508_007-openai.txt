PHI SOCIETY, SAT. NIGHT.

The meeting of the Phi Society Saturday night was a very fitting one to close a very successful year of
work. In place of the regular program, the time was taken up by several orations and other speeches. The following
orations were given: “O. Henry,” by R. H. Stone; “America’s Attitude Toward the War,” by Peters; “Generalissimo Foch,” by W.
T. Dunlap, Jr.; “The Irish Question,” by Currie; and “Our Neighbor Mexico,” by R. C. Garth. A selection from Wendell
Phillips’ “The Scholar and Politics” was given by C. G. Long. D. M. Chalmers and W. C. Cumming contested in
a very heated extemporaneous debate concerning the continuance of society meetings during exams. Both sides were ably defended by their
supporters. The judges decided 2 to 1 in favor of the affirmative. After a brief business meeting, the society adjourned
to take up regular society work on September 7, 1918. At the next meeting, the recently elected officers will be
installed and the reports of the present officers will be considered.

J. D. Howell, ex-'20, stopped over on his way home from Annapolis and spent Monday on the Hill.
