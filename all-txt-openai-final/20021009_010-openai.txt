Georgetown leads the all-time series 2-1, but all three games have featured thrilling finishes.

Last year in Washington, DC, the Wildcats trailed 26-18 with 3:04 left before pulling within two points on a 65-yard touchdown drive. But Paul Nichols was intercepted on the two-point conversion attempt, and the game ended 26-24.

The final game of the Wildcats’ 10-0 season in 2000 was a 41-17 home victory over Georgetown in which Nichols passed for a career-high 368 yards.

The first chapter of Nichols’ storied career came in 1999 at Georgetown, a game the Wildcats entered as 48-point underdogs.

Nichols entered the game in the fourth quarter and led the Wildcats to a stunning comeback, scoring 21 points in the final period to win 28-27.

It was Davidson’s first victory over a Division I opponent since a 44-14 win over Boston University in 1981.

The Teams:

The Wildcats will attempt to recover from last week’s demoralizing loss to Morehead State against the struggling Hoyas.

Georgetown has lost all three of its Patriot League contests, including a 41-10 home loss Saturday against Fordham. Other losses include a 27-2 final against Florida International, 41-13 against Holy Cross and 69-0 at Lehigh.

Senior quarterback David Paulus (6-3, 220) was benched in favor of sophomore Andrew Crawford (6-2, 200) last week, but neither passer was able to move the ball consistently.

They combined for 16-of-25 passing for 187 yards. The leading Hoya rusher was fullback William Huisking, who managed 32 yards on three touches.

What to Expect:

It’s been quite a while since Davidson was beaten so convincingly on its home field, so predicting how the team will respond is not easy.

We forecasted tight games in each of the past two weeks, but both were blowouts. Hopefully the third time’s the charm.

All three of Georgetown’s losses have been blowouts, and the Hoyas appear to be unsettled at the quarterback position.

A team in turmoil makes for an inviting target, so look for Davidson to take out its frustration on Saturday, although not too many people will be around to see it with students on fall break.

Bats (3-2, 1-1) v. Georgetown (1-4, 0-3)

By GEOFF FEHLING

Coming off a fantastic win over second-ranked South Carolina, the men’s soccer team lost two straight games and its number 24 ranking last week, falling 2-1 to Duke on Tuesday night and 1-0 to Appalachian State on Saturday night.

The #17 Blue Devils took control early at Duke’s Koskinen Stadium, as they scored two goals in the first half.

Duke’s Jordan Cila scored the first goal at the 13:08 mark, after Scott Noble headed the ball to him off a corner kick.

Duke’s second goal, which would prove to be the game winner, was scored by Donald McIntosh at the 30:57 mark and was assisted by Ryan Kerlew.

McIntosh rifled a shot from the end line to give the Blue Devils (6-2-1) a two-goal lead.

That margin remained until the second half, when the Wildcats began to show some offensive strength.

In the second half, Duke’s Adam Guren received his second yellow card and had to leave the game, forcing the Blue Devils to play a man down for the rest of the match.

Quickly capitalizing on the opportunity, Senior Joel Sadler took a head ball from freshman John Latting and booted an acrobatic one-timer over Duke goalie Justin Trowbridge.

Despite repeatedly trying to even up the game, the Wildcats were unable to score any more goals.

“Any time you get behind 2-0 at a top-20 school, it’s going to be a hard hurdle to get over,” said head coach Matt Spear. “We’re happy we played well but we’re not satisfied with just playing well.”

In Saturday night’s game, a Southern Conference contest, Appalachian State’s Steve Mellor scored three minutes into overtime to give the Mountaineers the 1-0 win.

The victory improved the Mountaineers’ record to 6-2-1 overall, 1-1 in the Southern Conference. The Wildcats fell to 5-4-1, 2-1 in the conference.

While the first half of the match was relatively quiet with each team tallying a mere three shots, the second half was dominated by ASU. The Mountaineers shot 12 times and had three corner kicks.

“Conference matches are all extremely important,” commented Spear. “When you have an opportunity to get a road win like we did tonight and don’t take advantage of the situation, it’s disappointing.”

The scoring drought Saturday night was the first time in 13 games that Davidson had been shut out. With the ‘Cats totaling only one goal in both matches, Spear believes that it is the offense that needs to get the Wildcats back on track.

“Right now goal scoring is our number one obstacle and number one issue,” he explained.

Despite suffering two tough defeats last week, the Wildcats hope to be ready for action against conference-rival UNC-Charlotte tonight. The opening touch is scheduled for 7 p.m.
