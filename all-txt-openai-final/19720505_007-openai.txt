If you think Kodak is just

pretty pictures, you ought to have

When a chest x-ray shows that you have a potential
killer like TB or cancer, it’s not a pretty picture. But it’s an
important picture because it can help the doctor detect and
catch the killer in time.

When doctors are out to catch these potential killers,
they want the sharpest, clearest x-ray films they can get. And
that’s why people at Kodak spend so many hours creating
new and better x-ray film equipment. Already, the results in-
clude convenience for the patient, economy for the hospital,
an even more useful tool for the radiologist—and, most impor-
tant, reduced radiation exposure.

Researching and creating better x-ray films is good
for our business, which is why we went into them in the first
place. But it does our society good, too—which isn’t a bad
feeling. After all, our business depends on our society—so we
care what happens to it.

More than a business.
