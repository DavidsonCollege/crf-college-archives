**Editorial: Buy Books, Not Bombs**

“Suggest something and we'll take a look at it,” said President Reagan at his budget press conference the last week of February. And suggestions he got. On March first, National Student Action Day, 5000 college students climbed the Capitol steps chanting the not-so-subtle suggestion, “Buy Books, Not Bombs.”

With a proposed increase of 34 billion dollars in defense spending and a decrease of 2.2 billion dollars in federal student aid, it’s not hard to see why students around the country are protesting the Reagan administration's plans for fiscal year 1983. For the price of a couple of extra bombers, several hundred thousand students will have to re-evaluate their college careers. In this week’s budget cut story, John Phillips of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities claims that as many as 300 thousand students in private colleges will be forced to leave school if the cuts pass in Congress.

However isolated Davidson may be from the real world, student aid cuts may bring the real world to Davidson. The present proposals would mean a 600 thousand dollar reduction in Davidson student aid in 1983-84, about five percent of the college’s yearly budget and all out of students' or their parents’ pockets. Those most affected by the cuts will be upper-middle-class students, traditionally Davidson’s stronghold. At least to some extent, education cuts will tend to polarize American colleges, sending upper-class students to expensive schools like Davidson and lower and middle-class students to public schools.

“We are moving from a system designed to educate those most able to learn, regardless of financial need, to a preserve for those best equipped to pay,” says Rutgers University President Edward Bloustein.

Even if most Davidson students show little concern, the college administration is beginning to take action. Associate Director of Financial Aid Kathleen Stevenson has launched a letter-writing campaign to members of Congress and is encouraging faculty, students, and staff to become involved in the fight against the cuts. As quoted in David Resnik’s article this week, College President Samuel Spencer also believes that Reagan has his budget priorities a bit shuffled. “Student aid budgets are not a luxury...” said Dr. Spencer. As a member of the Association of American Colleges, he should have some influence in the aid cut protest.

Everybody wants federal budget cuts this year, but nobody wants a cut that might affect their own pocketbook. So why not a compromise? Increasing military spending by 32 billion dollars instead of 34 billion and leaving student aid at the present 11 billion dollar level might be a good idea. We might not have quite as many bombs, but then again, a few extra megatons either way couldn't really make much difference. Not having educational class differences might be worth it.

If you still think Davidson isn’t part of the real world, drop by the financial aid office and ask Ms. Stevenson about your chances of getting your loan or grant money two years from now. I think you will be convinced that student aid cuts can affect the quality of your education at Davidson and yes, even the education of the real world. And it wouldn’t hurt to write Jim Martin, Jesse Helms, John East, Jim Hunt, or even President Reagan.

**Five candidates will be vying for the SGA Vice Presidency in next Tuesday's elections.** This is the first contested vice presidency in recent memory. The candidates are juniors Richard Davis, Mark Oldenberg, and Boe Young, and sophomores Lentz Ivey and Steve Reardon. Each candidate was asked why he was running, what set him apart from the other candidates, what three campus issues he planned to address, and what changes he proposed within the SGA. Their responses, in alphabetical order, appear below.

**Richard Davis**Davis, a junior political science major from Midland, Missouri, is currently Union Pop Films Committee Chairman. Davis is also a coach, scheduler, and treasurer of the junior varsity tennis team, of which he has been a member for three years. A Fiji, Davis has edited the fraternity newsletter this year. He also worked briefly with the SGA Corporate Relations Committee. Although he has never been elected to the SGA, Davis considers his position as “somewhat of an outsider,” an advantage. He said his involvement with the athletic department, fraternities, and the Union would make him a valuable source of information within the SGA concerning student views. “One of the dangers of the SGA is that it can alienate itself from the student organizations,” Davis said. He would be a “good voice” for the other organizations. Davis cited the SGA’s relationship with the athletic department, Patterson Court, and the Union as three major areas of concern. “I have good organizational ability,” he said, and as a leader, can “adjust to changing circumstances.” Davis said he would like to place groups of SGA committees with similar areas of concern “under the stewardship of a single individual,” as it was done in the Union. “This streamlines the information coming through,” he said. Greater responsiveness to committee interest groups would make them “feel represented,” he added.

Leniz Ivey presidential race at Davidson since 1978. Ivey also wrote the biannual freshmen newsletter last year and was chairperson of Saturnalia 1981, a one-day social gathering for underclassmen at the lake campus. “One of my main goals is to continue to develop student involvement in areas of limited student representation.” More student voice is needed in academic policy, especially curriculum decisions, and in the College’s athletic policy, according to Ivey. “We need to beef up intramurals,” he said, as well as discuss “long-range goals for basketball and football.” Student life was the third area Ivey emphasized, citing campus security, decreased food costs for Patterson Court, and the upcoming review of a town noise ordinance as major concerns. Ivey said he wished to change the SGA’s committee structure on the basis of an “internal flow chart” he had devised. Currently, all SGA committees report directly to the President, who “has been very taxed for time” and unable to sit down and work out goals. Ivey proposed the appointment of someone, perhaps the Vice President, to act as advisor to the committees.

Mark Oldenburg, a junior history major from Charlotte, was elected to the SGA this year. He has served on the Corporate Relations Committee, the Residence Hall Committee, and the Trustee Contact Committee. Oldenburg is a member of PiKA and sings in the male and concert choruses and in the barbershop quartet. “Getting involved this year has gotten me really excited about the SGA’s potential,” Oldenburg said, “and the office with the most potential is the vice-presidency.” Since the office of vice-president does not entail many specific duties, it can become “almost a co-presidency,” he added. Oldenburg said his greatest asset is that he has “experience but not too much.” “In a year I’ve learned how things work, and what potential particular people and offices have, but I’m not too much steeped in tradition,” he said. Oldenburg listed the computer, the Commons, and the proposed town ordinance as three issues of importance for SGA this fall. The computer system “has a vast potential for student use” which needs to get more attention. “We’ll have to use computers for most jobs of the future,” he said, and “it would be a disservice to the students not to offer them opportunities to develop computer skills.”
