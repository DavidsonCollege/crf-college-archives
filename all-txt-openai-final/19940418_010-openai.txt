**Band Three Crunch Time Days Debuts**

Some say Davidson ranks #2 to Stanford for demanding undergraduate workload. Others say that is a myth.

By Tom Bavis

About 70 people congregated in the 900 Room Thursday evening to witness the birth of the band Three Days. The band’s five members—sophomore Karl Ruch and freshmen Ravi Jain, Will Nolen, Andy Morris, and Andrew O’Dell—have been playing together for several weeks but had never played before a large audience. Flyers, distributed by the devoted band members, appeared everywhere in the days preceding the show, drawing a substantial audience for the debut.

The crowd heard an hour of Christian-based pop that was as spirited as it was crude. The group rarely kept the same line-up for more than two songs, intermingling full rock, pop, and reggae arrangements with solos. Each member of Three Days showed off his multi-instrumentalism. Karl Ruch, normally the provider of dazzling drum beats, tried his hand at a piano ballad as his bandmates joined the audience. Guitarist Ravi Jain worked the crowd into a frenzy with a pan flute solo during one uplifting rocker. An excellent guitar instrumental earned Andrew O’Dell a standing ovation. Keyboardist/vocalist/percussionist Andy Morris lapsed into the spoken word (literally) as he delivered a short sermon during a break. He ended, “If you want to talk about God or about having faith, feel free to talk to any one of us; because we feel we have the answer.”

Along with the successful debut and a satisfied crowd lurked some obvious weaknesses. Technical woes delayed the show’s beginning and occasionally appeared in mid-song. Some songs needed more practice. A couple of songs, though well-intentioned, lacked the musical spunk and lyrical intensity characteristic of spiritual songs by the Indigo Girls (“Closer to Fine”) and some similar-sounding Christian groups like The Choir. Fortunately for Three Days, a band still in its embryonic stages, the rough edges could definitely be erased with time.

“I have so much work this week. I’ve got a test on Wednesday, three problem sets due on Thursday, and a term paper due Friday.”

“That’s nothing. I have to read 675 pages by Tuesday, finish three papers by Thursday, and I have two tests on Friday.”

Sound familiar? Davidson students are constantly complaining about their workload. Are we justified in saying that our professors assign too much work? Some students claim that Davidson has the second hardest workload in the country (behind Stanford); however, I searched every college ranking in US News & World Report since 1988 and found nothing to verify that assertion. Wesley Davis, a senior political science major, believes that claim is a rumor. “I went on a France trip with students from Swarthmore who said their workload was second behind Yale’s,” he said.

Regardless of our ranking, students still seem overwhelmed by their work. Megan Fisher, a junior psychology major, believes that “the stress level at this school is unhealthy. There are a lot of activities around campus that I’d like to participate in, but I just don’t have the time.”

Other students think that we should expect large amounts of work. Davis states, “This is a really good school. You’ve got to take the amount of work with a grain of salt because we’ll all get a payback later.” Rafael Candelario, a senior history major, agrees, “The people hiring know this school is challenging. I’m glad it’s tough. That’s how I got my job.”

According to Davis, the workload at Davidson can be really strenuous, but a student’s stress level depends on the courses he or she takes. Dr. Jeremiah Putnam, the head of the Pre-medical program, feels that, although he has not heard many complaints from students, those enrolled in the pre-med program “may feel added stress due to the various outside requirements demanded by medical schools.” Additionally, Dr. Verna Case, the head of the biology department, believes that science students, in general, may feel additional pressure because they must attend lectures as well as labs. However, she finds the biology curriculum at Davidson to be no different from that of other schools.

Yet many believe that our college is more difficult than others with equal or better reputations. Mark Little, a senior biology major, feels that “because of the fact that we have smaller classes, the teachers expect more. Sometimes people have conflicts with work in different classes that may not get noticed in other schools.” Dr. Alberto Hernandez, a Spanish professor, states, “At bigger institutions, students can hide in the anonymity of a big classroom, and not feel guilty that they haven’t studied for class.” Fisher adds, “I have...Friends at Princeton who don’t do much work. I think that some schools that are harder to be accepted into are easier once you get in.” Patrick “Ed” Thiedeman, a senior studio art major, believes the work at Davidson is much more difficult than that at other institutions: “I talk to my friends at state schools, and they don’t do diddly.” Chris Wyrick, a junior studio art major, admits that the work at Davidson is definitely more difficult than at other schools, but he feels that all students here are capable of doing it. “I think a lot of people waste a lot of time here,” he said. Some attribute being overwhelmed to the fact that they were recently abroad. “Being away from the Davidson academic load makes it hard to come back here,” says Fisher. “Once you see what’s out there, it’s hard to get motivated to do schoolwork again.” Some feel that perhaps the workload at Davidson has increased throughout the last few years. Dr. S. Mark Williams, a visiting psychology professor, is a member of the graduating class of 1986. Because he has had the opportunity to view life at Davidson as a student and as a teacher, he has been trying to assess the question of the present workload. Williams senses that, though the workload is “relatively the same” as when he was here, “students seem more involved in campus activities, such as service projects or internships, and these may take away from their study time. They are distracted by more forces than when I was here. That’s not to say that they aren’t working hard.” On the other hand, some professors feel the students are not working hard enough. Dr. Hernandez believes that students may not always take advantage of the help available to them: “I sat in my office until ten at night for two days before the last exam period, and very few people came in to see me.” Dr. Anthony S. Abbott, the English department head, describes the workload as “an issue about which there is much confusion.” He wonders if a “breakdown in communication” has occurred because the faculty says the students do not work hard enough, while the students say they are overloaded. “If there is a problem, the only thing we can do is explore the causes,” he says. At the same time, Abbott points out the advantages of our difficult workload: “None of our students are intimidated in graduate school. They all do well because they think, ‘Nothing can be harder than Davidson.’”

Tucker lectures on Monet's modernity
By Jonathan Brooks

Billows of smoke and steam float up to the iron arches, while the screeching whistles of trains add to the chaos of the station below. As Paul Tucker noted, Monet’s paintings of the Gare Saint-Lazare are not the typical Monet paintings of rolling countrysides or blossoming gardens. College students may be quite familiar with the artist’s attempt to extract a fleeting moment in an attempt to seek the “eternal from the transitory” in the natural setting of a countryside. In Monet’s paintings of Gare Saint-Lazare, he appears to embrace the mechanized world the train represents and affirms the arrival of modernity. Paul Tucker’s Thursday night lecture dispelled many of the myths that viewers maintain concerning Monet’s life and work. Tucker expressed that it was a common misconception that during his life Monet typified the poor, starving, bohemian artist who was rejected by critics during his lifetime. He mentioned other artists for whom that statement might be true, such as Renoir or Van Gogh. He commented that Monet was making more money than doctors and lawyers of his day—15,000 francs more than those high-paying occupations. According to the scholar, Monet “enjoyed similar status [to that which he has currently] at the end of his life. He was seen as one of France’s great artists.” Tucker also expressed that impressionism still remains one of the most popular styles in the visual arts. One might clearly see the popularity of Monet as one looks around a Davidson student’s room and observes posters and calendars of Monet paintings. He believes this “notoriety of his painting has obscured their significance.” While thousands of students in colleges embrace prints of Monet paintings as something to grace their walls, they may not fully comprehend Monet’s interests, goals, and accomplishments as an artist. Thus, Tucker wanted to provide “an opportunity to see things anew.” Tucker’s lecture also focused on the importance of Monet’s choice of subject. While an observer might instantly react to the fleeting glimpse and painterly stroke of Monet's paintings of the Gare Saint-Lazare.
