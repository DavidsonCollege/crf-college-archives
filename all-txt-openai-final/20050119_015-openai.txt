Women fall by six to Gardner-Webb in home swim meet

On Friday night, the Wildcats hosted their first meet of the year in a competitive and grueling competition against Gardner-Webb and Catawba. The ’Cats lost by only six points, falling 118.5 to 112.5 to Gardner-Webb. Despite the tough loss, the Wildcats gave an impressive performance.

Megan Perez ’05 helped start off the meet by taking the lead in the 100 fly. Her first-place finish in 1:00.08 was also a season-best. Lauren Taft ’05 followed right behind Perez, placing second in the 100 fly with a solid time of 1:00.59. Co-captain Jenny Hoekstra ’05 also stepped up for the senior class and took first in the 50 free with a season-best of :25.40.

Megan Hollar ’06, a returning junior from abroad, stepped up the competition immediately in the 100 breast. In her first meet since last spring, Hollar pulled out a time of 1:08.13, a team-best of the year. Freshman Kirsten Allen ’08 also gave a strong performance; she flew through the 100 free with a time of :55.05.

Divers Judy Otvos ’05 and Christie Brough ’06 showed strength and skill on the boards and scored high points for the ’Cats. Despite the fact that the meet was solely a women’s competition, the men’s team came to stand on the pool deck and support their fellow teammates. Said Taft, “Due to the fact that our meet was on the night of Court Selection, it was really great to have such strong support not only from the guys on our team but from our peers as well. I was impressed with the large turnout of friends who came to cheer all of us on.”

The women’s swim team scored 112.5 points Friday night in its first meet of the semester. Perez reiterated that the hard work and commitment that the women’s team endured during their winter training trip truly showed and paid off in this meet: “Despite the loss, the close finish and the breadth of season-best and team-best times can perhaps foreshadow what we hope will be a strong finish to the season.”

The men’s and women’s teams will come together next weekend for back-to-back meets at Duke on Jan. 21 and at UNC Wilmington on Jan. 22. In two weeks, the women will host Radford and the men will host VMI in the ’Cats’ last home meet for the seniors on Saturday, Jan. 29.

Wrestling snaps undefeated record with losses in duals

Wildcats begin Virginia Duals with 27-24 victory over McDaniel before losing two matches

The wrestling team entered this past weekend’s Virginia Duals with a perfect 5-0 record, their best start in 38 years, but the Wildcats were unable to continue the perfect streak in losing two of three matches overall. Seeded third in the tournament, the ’Cats started well with a 27-24 victory over McDaniel College. The team dominated the lower weight classes and won the first six matches. Patrick Coman ’06 had an 11-4 win at 125 and Benjamin Graham ’08 had an 8-3 win at 149. Travis Hunter ’06 had a big 5-4 win at 133, filling in for the injured Jim Avola ’07 in what was one of the main turning points of the match, according toCaptain Matt Leonard ’06 pinned his opponent in 24 seconds in the 141-pound weight class, and Matt Pendle ’08 pinned his opponent in 4:24 at 157. The last victory went to Trebor Clevette ’08, who won by default in the 165 weight class. The Wildcats lost their final four matches, but it did not matter as the win was already secured. The following day, however, the Wildcats were unable to continue their perfect start to the season, as they lost to South Dakota State and SUNY-Brockport.

Against South Dakota State, the ’Cats again started well with a pin by Coman at the 1:39 mark and an 11-5 victory by Hunter. South Dakota State, however, marched on to win six of the next eight contests as well as the match, 31-15. The other Wildcat victories were by Graham, 11-8, and Clevette, who beat his opponent 5-4. Later in the day, the team went up against SUNY-Brockport and fell 28-13. Coman and Graham both won again to go a combined 6-0 on the weekend. Unfortunately, the only other wins came from Pendle and Clevette, and that was not enough to secure the overall victory.

“Everybody wrestled hard,” Coman said, “but the breaks just didn’t go our way. If another match or two would have gone our way, we could easily have won that tournament.” Leonard added, “Overall our team showed we can compete at that level and win.” At 6-2, the team is off to a great start and has already eclipsed last year’s win total by two (4-13). Coman attributes the difference at least partially to the freshmen class, saying, “A big reason for us starting so well this year has been our freshmen; they have been amazingly consistent throughout the season and they haven’t looked like freshmen at all out there.” Coman also said that the change could be a result of the team’s camaraderie, saying, “We also have a tight-knit team that has allowed us to win the close matches. If one person doesn’t get the job done, the next person has been able to pick up the slack and keep us going, and that has made the difference between the past and this year.”

Leonard, looking ahead to the upcoming schedule, said, “For now we just have to get back in the room and work our tails off getting ready for conference matches.” The team’s conference schedule starts at home on Wednesday when the Wildcats face UNC-Greensboro.
