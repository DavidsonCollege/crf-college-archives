Class of ’08 shatters
selectivity record

Incoming freshmen will bring ‘increasing
breadth and depth’ to the College

By ADAM MARTIN
Senior Staff Writer

Last Friday, Admissions accepted
27 percent of the 4,154 applicants
into the class of 2008.

This year’s acceptance rate was
five percent lower than any year in
Davidson history.

It also puts Davidson in the ranks
of such competitive schools as Duke
University (25 percent), Bowdoin
College (25 percent), and Tufts Uni-
versity (27 percent).

The low acceptance rate was due
to a record high number of appli-
cants—227 more than last year—and
a need for a smaller class of incom-
ing freshmen.

The unexpected over-enrollment
of the class of 2007 has pressed on
the structural limitations of the
Davidson campus, especially com-
plicating housing situations for the
next four years.

In order to correct last year’s over-
enrollment and maintain Davidson’s
goal to be an institution of 1600 stu-
dents, Admissions accepted 141
fewer applicants and will actively
employ its wait list, a mechanism not
used last year.

“We’re expected to hit 460 and not
461,” said Political Science Profes-
sor Lou Ortmayer about the incom-
ing freshman class.

Ortmayer, chair of the Faculty
Admissions Committee of Admissions and Finan-
cial Aid, indicated that the class of
2008 will be the smallest class to be
admitted to Davidson in six or seven
years.

According to President Bobby
Vagt, precision of this sort requires
“undershooting the mark.”

The number of accepted students
expected to yield at or below 460 was
estimated by Admissions based on
the past data of acceptance and yield
rates.

Unfortunately, undershooting may
cause highly qualified, acceptable
students to be wait-listed and poten-
tially turned off to Davidson, accord-
ing to Ortmayer.

Accepted Class Statistics

Sixteen percent of next year’s ac-
cepted students represent racial mi-
norities, a two percent increase over
last year, despite the overall decrease
in the acceptance rate.

“We made strides with certain in-
stitutional goals like racial/ethnic and
socio-economic diversity in recent
years,” said Ortmayer.

Ortmayer said the number of Afri-
can American and Hispanic students
already enrolled through Early De-
cision demonstrated the positive
trend.

Vagt concurred on this year’s suc-
cess.

Outpost return a possibility, says Vagt

By BLEVINS SHELNUTT

Until 2002, the Outpost occupied
what is now Phi Gamma Delta’s
house on Patterson Court. Entirely
student-run, the Outpost served as an
additional food option for students,
a locus for artistic expression and an
outlet for socializing.

With the establishment of the new
Union Cafe, however, the adminis-
tration shut down the Outpost to en-
courage students to eat and spend
time at the Union. The administra-
tion hoped the Union would fill the
role the Outpost once had. Many
upperclassmen feel the Outpost clos-
ing has left a void in campus life and
do not believe the Union has become
an adequate substitute.

“The Outpost proved unique be-
cause it helped mend the divide be-
tween those students who routinely
frequented the Court and those who
didn’t,” said Laurence Birdsey '04.

“The Union has not and never will
live up to the Outpost as a late-night
meeting place simply because it is a
large institutional building with ad-
ministration figures walking
around. The Outpost, on the contrary,
always felt like a comfortable and
intimate place where students alone
reigned,” Birdsey commented.

President Vagt said that the Union
has served a trial period, but need for
a social outlet such as the old Out-
post is still apparent.

“There is a clear implication of a
need not being met by the new
Union,” said Vagt.

Vagt spoke optimistically about
looking into reinstating the Outpost
once Patterson Court renovations are
complete.

“When we’re done, we need to
look and talk about a new Outpost,”
Vagt said.

Other than general plans to provide
minor renovations for Turner, CoHo,
and FIJI, major renovations for
Patterson Court houses will be com-
pleted by the fall of 2005.

Dean Marsicano points out that if
Kappa Sigma fraternity is permitted
to return to campus once renovations
are complete, there will be no avail-
able facilities on Patterson Court for
a new Outpost.

“Kappa Sigma fraternity will have
completed its college-imposed sanc-
tion by then and would be eligible to
return to campus. It is not clear yet
whether the national fraternity will
choose to do so. If they do, all facili-
ties on Patterson Court will be in use
and there will be no facility available
for a revived Outpost,” said
Marsicano.

Student murals covered
the walls of the former
Outpost.
