service during the war is up to him, because he knows how much he can bear. By keeping them, a
man must be true to himself. A man untrue to himself will finally come back to the emptiness of life
and to himself.

Allen Parker, Senior: “No, I think if a ‘Point System’ is necessary in a school the size of Davidson, there
might be an outstanding man with qualifications who would be handicapped by such a system. And then, too, it might
result in a hindrance to the college as well as to the individual. Let the person himself be the last
word on any matter.”

Handsome Bud Ingram, Senior: “Yes, I'm in favor of a ‘Point System.’ If we had one, the honors would be
more divided, and all the burden would not fall on the shoulders of one man. This would give each student
more time to devote to filling capably the positions he does hold.”

Dick Kenyon, Sophomore: “Yes, I think I'm in favor of it. There is a great deal of leadership ability at
Davidson that goes unused as soon as a man gets one office, he is handed a pile of others on
his reputation, to a great extent. If we had a point system, a student would be able to spend more
time on the work that he does have.”

Generosity Rewarded

New Officers To Be Installed On April 24

At the chapel program on March 17, nominations from the floor will mark the beginning of the election of student
body officers of Davidson College for the 1938-39 session. Nominations and elections of the officers will take place in the
following order: student body officers, Y. M. C. A. officers, editor of The Davidsonian, class officers, student council members, editor
of Quips and Cranks, editor of Scripts and Pranks, cheerleader.

The newly-elected student council officers shall be installed on April 24 as prescribed by the constitution which states, “The inauguration
of the new president of the student body and the new council shall take place on or before April 24.”

Professor Beaty To Address German Club

Professor Beaty, of the Davidson faculty, will address the German Club in their meeting at the Tuesday chapel period. Sam
Newell, of Atlanta, Ga., was elected president of the reorganized Beaver Club. Tom Abbot, of Charlotte, was elected vice president,
and Henry McConnell, secretary-treasurer.

The Pi Kappa Phi initiation was held on Thursday night. Pledges who were initiated were: Dick Saunders, Boyd Flynn, Roy
Cunningham, Louis Hite, Frank Niven, Paul Bumbarger, Bill Ward, and Albert Green. These men will be initiated into the fraternity
in the near future.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon will hold its initiation sometime in March as soon as the required payments are made.

Friends of Archie Shuford will be interested to know that he spent last weekend in Davidson at the home of
Mr. Jackson. Mr. Shuford is a resident of Hickory, and is now connected with the First National Bank there. He
is a member of the class of ’36. He won honors in track; he was also a member of the
deceased Beaver Club.

Henry Harkey, Sam Spencer, and Bob Kellog were elected to the fraternity. They will be initiated into the fraternity in
the near future.
