Davidson College was the heavy favorite for the Southern Conference tennis championship as the coaches gave the Wildcats seven of the nine first seeds. The only seeds which the Wildcats failed to win were the first court singles and the first court doubles. Defending champion Furman received the top seed at first court with David Ellison. George Washington's first court doubles team of Phil Jones and Mark Geier nabbed the top seed.

Davidson's first court player Randy Jones met Ellison yesterday in the opening round. Ellison knocked off Jones while Koury returned the favor by whipping Hunt Schwarie. Koury was Furman’s first court player last year before a shoulder injury. That match will probably mean three points to Davidson.

In doubles, the team of Weaver and Jones is rated second while Dumansky and Koury at second and Cantrell and Hi Lankenau at third won the top seeds. Davidson is expected to finish with 23 points, followed by Furman with 12 and George Washington with 11. The action will resume today on the Davidson courts with the semi-finals for the singles matches scheduled to begin at 2 p.m. The finals will be held tomorrow with the singles beginning at 10 a.m.

Despite the success of the seeds in the singles play, Furman’s first doubles team was eliminated by The Citadel. Washington lost the first set before steadying to eliminate ECU's Bill Van Middlesworth at third singles. East Carolina had another close one go their way as Kirk Jones won a three-set match over his Richmond opponent at sixth court.

Davidson coach Harry Fogleman, who is serving as the tournament manager as well, pointed to several key matches in yesterday’s play. The Wildcats demonstrated their depth with first court player Randy Jones losing only one player. Ellison knocked off Jones while Koury returned the favor by whipping Hunt Schwarie. Koury was Furman’s first court player last year before a shoulder injury. That match will probably mean three points to Davidson.

Ellison knocked off Jones while Koury returned the favor by whipping Hunt Schwarand Ricky Snipes at the end of the Southern Conference meet. Senior half-mile ace, discuss Southern Conference teams. The five lowest individual scores comprised the team total, leaving the ‘Cats with 402, George Washington 403, and East Carolina, 424. The Wildcats included some of the problems saw surprising Citadel with Sean McCormack at tackle, and Nick Dumich in the secondary. The Wildcat thinclads completed their dual meet slate with track at Davidson. 

Puckett, who still holds the Charlotte high-school 880 record, was state champion in both cross-country and the half-mile in track. This figure was well off the pace established by favorites Furman (393) and East Carolina (395). Furman’s outstanding shot-maker David Strawn, who was last year's individual winner, appeared to be in last place with 419. The teams were closely bunched and the chances of the Wildcats gaining on the leaders were not completely erased.

According to Coach Fagg, the quarterback problem is being solved by junior Mark Thompson who has performed well. He is being backed up by sophomore Rick Kemmerlin and freshman Scotty Shipp, who have also shown some promise in the early going. Other offensive stars have been juniors Mike Mikolayunas at fullback, Jim Long at center, and John Harper at tackle. Several freshmen have also been impressive.

Tommy Richardson led the team with firsts in the high hurdles with a time of 14.6 seconds. Steve Kirley won both the shot and discus, and Jimmy Trussell lowered his own school record in the intermediate hurdles to 57 seconds flat. 

Davidson will probably finish last in the conference track meet, and many of those who perform brilliantly for opposing teams will be boys John Puckett used to beat. But that was for North Mecklenburg High. Davidson track is a completely different world. Ask John Puckett; he'll tell you.

It has been said that pitching is 90% of the game of baseball, and Wednesday afternoon two Wildcat hurlers bore this contention out. Rick Pipan and Mike Frye were responsible for sixteen innings of scoreless ball, as Davidson split a pair with The Citadel, 1-0 and 0-1. Pipan went all the way in the first game, gaining his second win in five decisions. 

Usually available and reliable, the Davidson bats were unusually silent. However, a balk in the fifth brought in a lone run, and that was all Pipan needed. Frye retired to right field without a decision. It was left to Davis Beason to be tagged with the loss, as he gave up a homer in the twelfth for the game’s only run.

Frye was pleased with the team’s performance, despite the loss. He cited the great defensive game, particularly two sliding catches by centerfielder Bill Barnhill. He also praised catcher Harold Wilkerson. “Weird called a great game. My stuff wasn’t particularly overpowering, but he kept mixing the pitches so well that they were always off balance.” Pipan and Frye were both a little unhappy with the team’s poor showing this year, but they are optimistic about the future. Frye says, “We're a real young team. I know this is a little old, but wait until next year.”

Davidson's game-winning run came on a freak play, as Jeff Dumansky outdueled Sandy Schwartz of George Washington 11-9, 12-10 at fourth court and Jim Cantrell maintained his perfect record.
