**Pipe bursts; Belk suffers water loss in the stacks**

By Mandy Curtis

The main water line that feeds into the Belk dorm and the laundromat burst on Thursday afternoon, December 9. Physical plant workers dealt with the situation from 4 p.m. until 2 a.m. the next morning.

Dr. Leland Park, director of the E. H. Little Library, stated, “This is out of our field. We're just here to provide moral support.”

The physical plant discovered that there was a problem in the piping late in the afternoon and acted quickly. Water in Belk was immediately turned off at about 5 p.m.

According to Phillip Cashion, the Associate Director of Utilities at the college, they knew approximately where the line was located and that they needed to go down to see what happened exactly. Campus police thought it was just a leak from a hole that needed to be patched up; however, Cashion found that the pipe line had burst.

Dave Harding of the campus police stated, “This is out of our field. We're just here to provide moral support.”

The workers dug down about 5 to 10 feet to get to the pipe, proceeding to interfere with telephone lines. They used a backhoe to dig out the hole in the ground on the East Belk side near the far entrance. Construction workers from the Phyfer Johnson Construction Company of Cornelius came to campus to assist Cashion and the rest of his physical plant crew.

As of 11:30 p.m. that evening, Cashion was confident the pipe would be fixed that night if not by the next morning. The campus police were on the scene as well, to make sure everything went smoothly. Many students of Belk chose to watch the action from the windows above. When asked to comment, Cashion said that the situation, however, was not completely remedied that night. Workers continued to haul in equipment and piping Friday morning. Finally, after much effort, the water in Belk was turned back on. Despite its discolored appearance and the smell it brought to the bathrooms, according to junior Eric Rosenbach, the men of Belk were just happy to have the service once again.

Since Cashion has been working in his official capacity at the college, he has had to deal with pipe bursts only one or two other times. He commented that what happened to the pipeline to Belk was a result of age and deterioration.

**Freshwomen can cluster in eating houses**

By Carrie Blackburn

As students look forward to a much-needed break, freshwomen also struggle with the decision of choosing an eating house or remaining independent. This year self-selection includes some important distinctions. The option of clustering has been implemented to ensure that freshwomen do not get placed in a house without their friends. Up to 4 women may cluster and as a group receive 1 lottery number. A cluster has no bearing on their chances, but if their first choice is full then the whole cluster is placed in their 2nd or 3rd choice. Freshwomen may still opt to go alone or not to join at all, but this way the disappointment of not getting their first choice will not be coupled with not being with their friends.

A committee comprised of the presidents and vice-presidents of the eating houses, faculty advisors, Kurt Holmes, and Dean Leslie Marsicano, met before Thanksgiving to discuss possible changes. Their biggest concern involved stability and keeping all the houses strong. The committee decided to implement clustering, eliminate waiting lists, and limit switching between houses.

President of the Patterson Court Council Julie Petty comments that with clustering they were “trying to look out for the interests of the freshwomen so they would have the chance to be with their friends.”

On Thursday, January 20, self-selection sheets will be filled out and the results posted the next morning. Freshwomen who self-select have early morning phone calls or cowbells to look forward to informing them of their new eating house.

A computer is fed all the names and the selection is completely random. According to the guidelines this year “there are no ‘caps’ or waiting lists involved.” The computer will divide the total number of freshwomen by three and that will set the limit for each house, Connor, Rusk, and Warner Hall.

To allow the new members to give their new houses a chance, switching will not be allowed until the beginning of the fall semester next year. Also, in an effort to “try and make women loyal to their houses,” women may now switch houses only once during their stay at Davidson, explains Petty.The prospect of clustering with their friends, freshwomen can now be even more excited about the impending self-selection parties.

Master plan revealed to Board of Trustees

Plan continued from page 1

should be corrected while the underuse of Love Auditorium should be rectified.
- A “learning resources center” should be added to the library.
- More and better-located space should be provided for student functions and general use.
- Expansion of housing might well be suited around the court.
- Any new buildings should be located near the academic core of campus.
- Labs should be designed and located to encourage multi-disciplinary use.
- Informal space for student study and interaction with others and faculty should be created.
- Special purpose studio and performance space is required for drama and music.
- Efforts should be made to maintain the pedestrian network.
- A prominent and clear entrance to the college should be considered.

Kelton said of the document: "When you sit down to make decisions, you need something to remind you of the principles. You sometimes tend to make decisions on the spur of the moment, and these folks pointed out how other campuses had made unwise decisions in the heat of the moment."

THE COLLEGE

Greenhouse built on campus

Biology students and faculty are excited about a recent addition to the Davidson campus. A greenhouse costing $30,000 was built in October next to the soccer practice field.

Pat Peroni, assistant professor for biology, stated that Davidson needed this new facility. “If we want to have a strong biology department then we need to have a large plant growth facility.” Peroni also spoke of the advantages of working with plants over animals. These advantages included that plants are less expensive to work with and there are no ethical questions involved when working with plants instead of animals.

The greenhouse covers 1,260 feet and maintains a temperature between 70 and 85 degrees. Both Peroni and associate professor Pam Hay, Davidson’s two plant biologists, will direct class research and personal research in the new greenhouse.

Ault named fellow

Dr. Ruth Ault, professor of psychology, has been named a Fellow of the American Psychological Association (APA). Of the 119,000 members in the association, fewer than five percent have been given this honor. The Fellows are chosen by the APA for their remarkable contributions to psychology.

Ault cited this honor as an affirmation that “the things that I have been doing in my career are valued by my colleagues.” Ault has been an active member of the APA since 1978. Over the past three years, she has helped edit various journals, as well as contributed to two books. Currently, Ault is busy working in Davidson writing a textbook on child development.

Senior wins physics award

Senior David Scott Rhodes recently received the Marsh White Prize at a meeting of the Southeastern Section of the American Physics Society in Columbia, South Carolina. A physics major at Davidson, Rhodes’ presentation at the meeting was judged the best of the 18 given by graduate and undergraduate students in the region.

The award-winning presentation dealt with the non-linear optical properties of cesium vapor. Rhodes’ research for the project began last summer when he worked as a lab assistant to Dr. Mary Anne Moore, associate physics professor at the college. Originally from Poughkeepsie, New York, Rhodes has lived in Raleigh, North Carolina since 1982 where he received his first introduction to physics at Enloe High School. In addition to physics, Rhodes enjoys tennis, soccer, and snow-skiing.

Ruth honored top criminal justice educator

Dr. Bob Ruth, associate professor of sociology, has received the Margaret Lang Willis Outstanding Criminal Justice Educator Award. Ruth was named “Educator of the Year” by the North Carolina Criminal Justice Association, for his academic contributions to criminal justice. Ruth joined the NCCJA in 1989. Since then, he has continued to be actively involved in the many facets of criminal justice.

Ruth said the award was most meaningful because “I was nominated by a Davidson graduate who was one of my former students.” He also stated that the award came as quite a surprise and served as a “capstone” for all of the work he has done in the field of criminal justice.
