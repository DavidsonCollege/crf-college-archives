#### Alumnus Slams Policy Changes

**ED. NOTE:** The following letter was also sent to the Board of Trustees and college president Samuel R. Spencer Jr.

To the Editor:

I often wonder, what is the real purpose of Davidson College? To me, Davidson College is in existence to train its students for compassionate, honest, and religious leadership in the communities of men. In light of this, review the following:

1. Removal of mandatory two years of R.O.T.C.; a whole downgrading of a system to provide leadership in times of a national emergency. A de-emphasis on one's patriotic duty.
2. A stated desire toward...

#### Pope Attacks ‘Hypocrisy’ Of Plan: Davis Hits Infirmary Story’s Error

To The Editor:

It seems to me that the passing of President Spencer’s proposal by the trustees this past weekend was a rather gross act of hypocrisy. Dr. Spencer and the trustees felt that a fine, upstanding, and democratic liberal college such as Davidson should not support a selective element on its campus. The guidelines they established for the regulation of the social groups on campus would strangle any selective fraternity; however, Spencer stated this was not his intention and that he would welcome any fraternity to stay—as long as they abided by his rules. The trustees and Spencer then proceeded to dictate the rules by which fraternities could stay at Davidson. Just to show how far they were willing to go to help fraternities, they would even allow them to move off campus. That is, if they promised never to eat or sleep in their own houses. Not only this, but they would also help the fraternities rush and set up the regulations regarding rush! These restrictions go on and on. If Dr. Spencer wishes to end fraternities at Davidson, why does he not just ban their existence instead of slowly strangling them by these restrictions? It is also hypocritical for Spencer to dictate rules for the eating, sleeping, and social life of the students, in short, to end all free choice by the student, and then to excuse these actions by saying they are in line with...

#### Social Council Defended

To The Editor:

After reading last week's DAVIDSONIAN and the petition to abolish the big weekends that is now circulating, I felt I had to write this letter. The Union Social Board has had and will have something going on every weekend of this term except this coming weekend (Oct. 24). Scott Woodmansee is filling it in with Mose Henry. On the first two weekends of this term, there were open school dances, and there was Taylor Park. On the tenth, there was Josh White Jr., and last weekend was Homecoming. The thirty-first is concert weekend with “Brewer and Shipley.” “Your Father’s Mustache” will make a return visit on the twenty-first of November and there will be something in the bar/Coffeehouse or a Hungry-D, for the Lafayette and William and Mary home games. The Union Film Committee is bringing some very recent films here this term. There is more going on at the Union now than ever before. The Ad Hoc Committee wants to do away with big weekends, but for two different and completely opposite reasons. Some of the committee think they (big weekends) are bad for the general student’s health because of the long hours and believe the social council money could be better spent on more low-keyed and mentally stimulating entertainment, as the Union is doing on off weekends now. The other faction wants to cut out all the little “rinky dink stuff” and concentrate on “big name entertainment.” There is only one problem. Do you know what the social council budget is? It is the same as it has been for the last three years, $22,000, and do you know what big name entertainment costs? For a few examples: James Taylor — $7500, Richie Havens — $8000, Grand Funk — $10,000, Led Zeppelin — $50,000 plus, Three Dog Night — $20,000, Chicago — $15,000, Ten Years After — $12,000 and CCR — $45,000 plus. If the frats (or whatever) would play down the big weekend and have more...parties and have them open as they were last Friday night or at the Sunday afternoon concert. On the off weeks, then there would be something going on both nights of every weekend. If all the college factions would work together, there could be something for everyone. The social council is trying.

ED. NOTE: Campbell has apparently misunderstood the position of THE DAVIDSONIAN if the remarks in this letter are intended to reply to that position (although he may be accurate with regard to the petition now in circulation). For a better understanding of DAVIDSONIAN policy, Campbell is referred to the editorial columns of Oct. 9 and 16, and the current column as well as Paul Rowland’s columns of Oct. 16 and this week.

making Davidson a truly democratic college not only in theory, but in practice.

ED. NOTE: The recent social changes are trustee proposals for which Spencer is proponent, not author.

To The Editor:

Re: “Davis: Burts Mustn't See Records.”

May I request a forum to correct certain statements. I am not FORCED to violate medical ethics. Historically, Dean Burts offered, and I accepted, the present system of record keeping. I later had second thoughts and he and I have discussed several possible solutions in numerous meetings during the past year. The implication that we're at each other's throat is entirely erroneous (not to mention that, organizationally speaking, he is my boss and it would not be circumspect for me to adopt such an attitude).

The system “has led the infirmary to neglect students with drug problems.” This is doubly erroneous. First, Mr. March states that I said this. ‘Tain't so. Further, I would appreciate information relating to the neglect of any student, drug problem or otherwise. (The staff nurses are conscientious women who were understandably upset over this statement). Finally, all of us at the infirmary are interested in the welfare of students, physically and otherwise. This will continue to be our main objective and everything else (records included) is secondary.

a planned elimination of planned athletic events. This is a narrowing of the Davidson student toward “academics only,” a demolishing of alumni support, and a reduction in pride in an institution.

The opening of dorms to young women; and they do remain with their dates in their rooms for the weekend. Morals and ethics are taught, and must be supported. You as trustees, The Presbyterian Church, and I as an alumnus have abdicated our responsibility to set standards and demand adherence to them.

The present concerted drive by Dr. Spencer to remove national fraternities from the campus. We know they are not perfect and some individuals have been hurt by their actions. They, as do R.O.T.C. and athletics, teach methods of organizing, leadership, teamwork, etc.; the things life is about. It seems as if we are trying to eliminate those types of training, experiences, and problems from the Davidson students, the future leaders of our communities. This is not the Davidson I know, nor the Davidson I want. I am sure the administration, faculty, and trustees are able men, but they do not have all the experience or knowledge in the world. Since you so freely ask for our financial support, ask for our opinions formed from varied and vast experiences. I believe you will find large numbers of alumni support an R.O.T.C. program, intercollegiate athletic program, and national fraternities on campus. In addition, removal of moral standards will be viewed with disdain.

Scovill Offers Drug Help

ED. NOTE: Anyone desiring further information concerning the assistance offered should write to: Elan Vital, P. O. Box 3696, Eureka, California 95501.

To The Editor:

I was heavy into drugs for the last three years I was there. Davidson had a drug problem then, and I'll wager it has an even bigger one now. If THE DAVIDSONIAN is admitting that there is a drug problem among its students, printing this letter in “Letters to the Editor” or printing this message may help. Thank you for helping me to reach some of those whom I may have misguided.
