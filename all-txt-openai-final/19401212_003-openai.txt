“The reindeer has had his day,” says the well-known Mr. Claus. “I’m just as modern as the college kids this year—I’m going by Greyhound and really enjoy my trip.” For the old fellow, as for everybody else, he'll enjoy the comfort and friendliness of each trip.

Perhaps you'll meet him on your way home for the Holidays—anyway, you'll think there’s a Santa Claus around somewhere when you figure out how much you save going by Greyhound.

Merry Christmas!
