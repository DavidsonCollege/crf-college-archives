The Jayvee Wildkitten squad, recently reduced from their pre-exam strength of twenty-three men, now number only nine. They lost a
mighty good man in Mel Griffith, a freshman who gave over his cage activities for action on the mat. A
good floor player as well as a crack shot, Mel was probably the most promising man in the Kitten line-up.
With the help of the third string varsity, the Jayvees have racked up two wins and a loss since exams.
According to Coach Shepard's instructions, the third stringers play ten minutes out of every half, and they sometimes see a
little more action when the going is rough. Even their added strength didn’t help the ‘unlucky dawgs’ much against Belmont
Abbey last Friday night. The score was tied, 56-56, when the final whistle blew, but the ball was still in
the air, and it made a detour through the Belmont net before it came to rest. Spectator Moneyhan’s comment was
classic—if unprintable.

The previous night the Kittens had invaded CC-UNC and defeated the Owls for the second time of the season, holding
Leland Helms, formerly of renown as a Central High cager and gridder, to a total of one point. Helms had
just returned to the Owl roster after being away beyond the blue somewhere and was expected to turn the tide
for the birds. His boys came out on the bad end of a 43-35 score. The only other game that
didn’t go the way the Kittens wanted it to was the Oak Ridge game, which they lost by three points.
They meet High Point and P. J. C. before the best college newspaper on the hill comes into your hands.

Old man weather himself postponed the Duke-Davidson basketball game last Saturday night. The game may or may not be played
later, depending on the fortunes of war and conference standings. It was the Dukes themselves who postponed the game, and
it was not until after the dauntless Wildcats had pushed through the drifts from Chapel Hill to Durham that they
found out that the game was cancelled. Therefore, it is up to us whether the game will be played at
some later date.

Friday’s game against Carolina’s giant White Phantoms showed the Wildcat mettle and put the ‘Cats back in the running, even
though Tar Heel reserves wore them down in the last half of the second half. The Red and Blacks held
them down to a tie at the half, and it was partly reserve strength, partly because John “The Hook” Dillon
had the green light on his famous hook shots that they didn’t come closer to a coveted win. Dillon, an
All-American two years ago and a benchwarmer last year, has his moments, and one of them was Friday night, it
seems. The Cats’ good showing proves that they have got the stuff as well as the spirit to stand up
to any team in the league.

The news that Lonie Bingham, one of the stronger contenders for the fifth place in the starting line-up, flunked out
is a blow to Davidson basketball. He will be sorely missed by the ‘Cats who lack nothing so much as
reserve strength. His plucky spirit and occasional antics will be missed by Wildcat fans.

In their first collegiate match, with Auburn, the wrestling team bowed to Auburn by a score of 19-10. They meet
both State and Carolina during the latter part of this week, and will be hard pressed on both occasions. They
will appreciate a good crowd, we are sure, for the State meet which will be run in our own ‘it
ain’t much but it’s all we got’ gym Saturday afternoon. We have some good material, and there should be thrills
and spills enough for all.

Matmen Bow Before Auburn Onslaught

Auburn's Orange and Blue mat- ters victory the Davidson Red and Black grapplers by winning the final three matches, and
turning what appeared to be a clinched bout into a complete rout. The score was 22-10, but after Stubby Evans
had pinned Vallely in 8:44 close for Auburn huskies. The final in the 155-pound class, the ‘Cats trailed by a
mere three points, 13-10. However, the Auburn Plainsmen were not to be denied as Smith, Mantrene, and Brnilavich all chalked
up decisions in the final three tilts, and these three wins coupled with the two previous Auburn victories were moreHere

Having enough to turn the tide in favor of the dangerous foes this week, playing Alabama matmen, ‘Cats will tangle
with two Carolina Tarheel’s wrestlers Wednesday, and then meeting the Wolfpack from N.C. State on Saturday. The State contest will
mark the first entry of the Catmen into the Southern Conference play, and will note the first time State has
visited the Cat gym since 1943.

Abbey Beats Jayvees At Final Whistle

The basketball squad came out on the winning end of the won-lost column in three games played last week. On
Tuesday night the Davidson Junior Varsity Jayvees met the National Business College on the local court and won a 62-42
decision over the visitors. Johnny Richards dropped in 10 points for Davidson, while Wright was high for Shelby with 17
points.

The Jayvees journeyed to Charlotte Thursday night for a game with C.C.U.N.C. After a hard-fought game, the Jayvees emerged the
victors by a 43-35 count. Heywood “Brinegar” and little Henry Neisler paced the Davidson scorers with seven points each. The
Wildkittens met Belmont Abbey on the Abbey's home court on Saturday night. Davidson dropped a close decision to the Crusaders
by a 58-56 score, the winning goal being scored in the last seconds of playing time. Virgili of Belmont was
tops for the night with 19 points. Brinegar and Richards collected 15 and 13 points, respectively, for the Junior Varsity.

Cats Beat Charleston, Lose to Carolina

The Davidson Wildcat basketballers turned in their most creditable performance of the still young basketball season when they were turned
back by the first-place White Phantoms of Carolina, 50-42. The ‘Cats ran headlong into their old nemesis, “Hook” Dillon, who
rang up 15 points in a repetition of his sparkling performance in Charlotte's armory last year. With the accurate shots
of Dillon finding the range, and Carolina's ace point maker, Bob Paxton, locating the hoop for 15 points, the Tarheels
roared to a commanding eight-point lead early in the second half, and maintained this advantage for the duration of the
encounter.

The game started out as a Carolina rout, as Paxton, Dillon, and Cole were hitting the rim from all angles,
and the Chapel Hill boys boomed into an 11-3 advantage. The ‘Cats, however, began to show their wares midway through
the initial 10 minutes when Dave Poole dropped two of his famous overhead “bucket” shots into the hoop, and Mike
Williams sneaked upon the basket for a crip. With the score at Carolina 21, Davidson 23, a timely set shot
from 15 feet out by the old reliable, Whit Cobb, ripped the cords and the half ended in a 23-23
deadlock.

After Carolina had blasted away to an eight-point advantage, the ‘Cats got hold of themselves and battled the hometown cagers
on even terms for the remainder of the game. With rangy Nemo Nearman and Bob Paxton snaring two out of
every three rebounds, the Tarheels were in constant control of the backboards. The ‘Cats had to offset this lack of
height with accurate shooting and a sharp zone defense. The unbeatable combination of Paxton and Dillon proved too much for
the plucky ‘Cat dribblers, and consequently, they went down to a close 50-42 defeat.

Davidson-College of Charleston

The Davidson quintet was hitting on all cylinders as they overwhelmed the hapless College of Charleston Maroons, 62-34. Every member
of the Wildcat five took turns at hitting the basket, and after getting off to a mediocre start, zoomed into
a 22-point lead at the half, and maintained this margin throughout the remainder of the contest. Husky Mike Williams led
the ‘Cat five by scoring (Continued On Page Four).
