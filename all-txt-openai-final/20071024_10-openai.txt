#### Cheer for the Rockies, for the sake of the Red Sox
By Patrick McArdle, Sports Editor

October baseball peaks this week when the Red Sox and Rockies start the best-of-seven World Series. Both teams see themselves
as battle-tested.

The Red Sox rank among the best teams in the MLB while retaining a playful edge. Despite securing the best
record in baseball during the regular season, the team struggled lately. After sweeping the Angels, the Sox overcame a 3-1
deficit against Cleveland in the ALCS behind performances from stars (like Cy Young favorite Josh Beckett) and two-hit wonders.

The Rockies, meanwhile, have won 21 of 22 games since Sept. 16. Riding a tsunami of momentum, the team swept
the Phillies and Diamondbacks. The upstart team joins the "Big Red Machine" as the only other team to win its
first seven playoff games.

Undeniably, these are two great stories. So which team should the thoughtful fan support? The bittersweet truth about this World
Series for the Fenway Faithful is that if the Red Sox win, Boston can no longer be an underdog. If
the Rockies cannot overcome Boston, as bookies in Las Vegas predict, Colorado’s historic run will end in disappointment. Fans clinging
to "Rocktober" would pack up their paraphernalia and resort to watching the Broncos through the winter.

So why should fans from New England care? The fact is that if Boston wins this World Series, the Red
Sox become the new Yankees. I can sense the protest, but it’s true. Boston’s payroll grew $23 million this year
to $143.5 million. The increase nearly equals the payroll of some entire teams. The environment, piles of money, and big-market
pretensions of the Red Sox undermine the recent parity in baseball starting with the Diamondbacks in 2001.

#### 'Cats emerged as national power in 1960’s

When Davidson College first started playing basketball, the games were nothing more than friendly matches between classes of Davidson men...a
glorified B-league, one might say. That all changed forever in 1907 when a student named James Wendell Rhea decided to
put Davidson’s name on the line and form a traveling basketball team that would compete against other schools. In the
school’s first season, a team of six won its first-ever game against Guilford College before losing to Wake Forest and
Duke. Davidson basketball was born.

For many years, Davidson basketball competed outside of what we now understand to be the general structures of college basketball.
The NCAA had only been formed in 1906, and there was no tournament until 1939. Davidson didn’t join the Southern
Conference until 1936 when the College was invited to join the likes of Clemson, North Carolina, Duke, Maryland, and South
Carolina. Those teams would not split off to form the ACC until 1953.

Until the late 1930s, Davidson basketball was relatively unheralded. The team mostly played against regional YMCA squads. On the other
hand, Davidson football seemed to have been getting all sorts of attention, with stadium improvements and scholarship fundraising to compete
with the larger schools in the Southeast. In fact, the “Wildcat” nickname came after a 1917 football game against Georgia
Tech.

In 1949, George “Buddy” Cheek put Davidson on the national map when he became the first Wildcat basketball All-American. In
his three years at Davidson, Cheek led the Wildcats to a record of 54-25. Three years later, in 1952, Hobby
Cobb arrived on Davidson’s campus. During four years, he scored 1,424 points and grabbed 836 rebounds. Cobb has since been
inducted into the Davidson Hall of Fame and his retired #21 jersey hangs from the rafters. Cobb is still a
season ticket holder and tries to attend every Davidson basketball game, home or away.

Although Davidson experienced some team success in the days of Cheek and Cobb, the sport of basketball was still just
an athletic exercise meant to stimulate the bodies and minds of the College’s student-athletes and supporters. Davidson basketball was not
a brand; it was not a reason to know about a small liberal arts school in North Carolina.

In 1960, that changed forever. In the spring of that year, the Davidson administration hired a former Duke basketball player
who had never been the head coach of a college basketball program. His name was Charles “Lefty” Driesell. Over the
course of his career, Driesell tallied 786 wins. He was inducted into the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame in
2007. When Driesell came to Davidson, he didn’t see the restrictions of a small student body. He refused to believe
in an attitude of small-time athletics. During his nine-year tenure with the Wildcats, Driesell went to the NCAA Tournament three
times and recruited three All-Americans.a number-one NBA draft pick. Fred Hetzel and Dick Snyder were the first two Davidson stars
of the Driesell era. Hetzel ranked eighth in the country in scoring during his senior year and Snyder ranked 14th
nationally the next year. Between 1963 and 1966, Hetzel and Snyder helped lead Davidson to national rankings in the AP
and UPI polls, as Davidson finished sixth in the nation in 1965. Both Hetzel and Snyder went on to prestigious
NBA careers and were inducted into the Davidson Hall of Fame. The real story of Lefty Driesell was not necessarily
what he accomplished as a coach, but how he redeemed with clutch victories.

A week and a half ago, the men’s soccer team fell behind Georgia Southern 2-0 to begin the second half.
It looked as though the Wildcats were on the verge of dropping their eighth straight match and entering a losing
hole that the prestigious program had never seen in its 50-year history. But as so many players have testified over
the course of the team’s losing streak, “we are so close to breaking this, we are still fighting hard.” And,
sure enough, the team rallied from two scores down and scored three straight goals for the road conference victory. Then
Davidson eked out a tie against Appalachian State in the final seconds of regulation. Then Davidson battered Coastal Carolina with
four goals from underclassmen. All of a sudden, the men’s soccer team has a new streak to boast about: a
three-game unbeaten streak.

In Davidson’s 3-2 come-from-behind victory over Georgia Southern, the ’Cats were sparked by the energy of some fiery underclassmen. Robby
Hoak ’08 first put Davidson on the board with a goal on a penalty kick. With under 10 minutes remaining
in the game, Davidson was still down by another goal and the offense had only scored multiple goals in a
contest once in the previous month. That statistic did not deter Charlie Rieter ’10 who, in the 82nd minute, launched
a bomb from 25 yards out that just barely fell in over the hands of the Eagle goalkeeper. The Wildcats
finally had some late-game confidence. The energetic Rob O’Donnell ’10 capitalized on Davidson’s momentum and knocked home his first career
collegiate goal, and the game-winner, with under six minutes left in regulation.

“O’Donnell’s energy and fight have always been supreme, but he stepped up with making the critical plays, including the game-winner,”
coach Matt Spear said. “It’s amazing how a single win can perk players’ confidence and belief.”

The Wildcats built on that confidence last Wednesday when they opened a five-game homestand against Appalachian State. Although the Mountaineers
held a 1-0 lead for most of the contest, the Wildcats continued to play tough even unto the final minute.
With less than 20 seconds remaining in the contest, Davidson secured the ball and launched it toward the Appalachian State
goal where the previous game’s hero, O’Donnell, was able to secure the pass and make a cross to the goal.
The ball was deflected and kicked out of play, but the referee ran in to call a handball on the
Mountaineer defender, giving Davidson a PK with only 4.4 seconds remaining in overtime. With Hoak missing the game due to
injury, Reiter stepped in and punched home the tying goal, much to the delight of the home fans. Neither team
was able to convert in the two overtime periods and the game ended in a 1-1 tie.

Although the Wildcats had used late-game heroics in their previous two games, Davidson returned to more conventional domination in their
4-2 win over Coastal Carolina on Saturday. The bitter blood between the Wildcats and Chanticleers goes back nearly 15 years
to the era of Davidson’s NCAA tournament runs. Although this group of Wildcats might not have completely appreciated that history,
the team was perfectly capable of responding to Coastal Carolina’s physical play with an aggressive offensive attack. Alex Caskey ’11
opened the scoring for the Wildcats in the early going, but Davidson was still knotted in a 1-1 tie at
halftime. Peter Shelton’s ’11 first-ever shot on goal proved to be the game-winner as he put the Wildcats up 2-1
off a nice pass from Cam Griffin ’09. The Wildcats piled it on from there with goals from Machel Turner
’10 and Yannick Pilgrim ’11.

The Wildcats still have two more conference games and two non-conference ACC matchups before they enter into the SoCon Tournament.
“I am hopeful that the players are more motivated now, since they have tasted some recent success,” Spear said. “We
still have better soccer potential in front of us though.”
