**THE DAVIDSONIAN, MAY 1, 1935**

**Potential Angelo Discusses Philosophical Views On Art**

**Michael John Walker Discourses On His Start In Art Of Sculpturing**

(By Evuenip Fant)

“Mr. Walker, how did you get your start in the wood-carving racket?” the reporter asked, stepping among the shavings on
the floor to his bed.

“It was about five years ago, when I made a little head, while just whittling. I got interested, for no
reason at all, and began making little pieces, which I pasted together to make groups. While a senior in high
school I specialized in busts—you know, wooden ones—for which I received no great acclaim.”

(It had been the reporter's original plan to ask leading and organized questions, to direct the interview into right channels,
but he soon found that this would be quite impossible, and said no more.)

“I only got a small set of chisels, relying on my ability, rather than on my tools, for the production
of artistic work. Formerly I made all my carvings from pictures, but I have recently found that the construction of
a small clay model is quite helpful. I chose my subjects during my formative years from the old masters (here
he crossed himself), but now they come only from my head. The Library, my far-seeing patron, displays these works to
the public eye.

“Despite the fact that I have produced some sixty pieces, I have received none of the recognition due me. My
outlook toward the artistic appreciation of this generation is fast becoming bitterly cynical.

“During the summers, which I spend in the more artistic atmosphere of Montreat, I find myself more fully appreciated, especially
by the middle-aged feminine element of the town, and also by the less attractive girls. I seem able to influence
these, to sway them, as it were. (Here, a pretty blush.)

“I should find it impossible to create beauty were it not for the omnipresence of an attentive muse, to whom
I must attribute all. His is the hand that...” (Here followed a lengthy and flighty discourse on the merits of
the artistic muse, which consideration for the reader forces the reporter to omit.)

“My studio is behind Mr. Torrence’s shop. True, it is humble, but Michelangelo...” (Another discourse, likewise omitted.)

“What’s more, I'm on my way to a garret studio, as this room on the fourth floor of Watts will
testify. The use of the workshop is an indication that Davidson is at last awakening to the presence of the
great mind in her midst.

“This summer I plan to continue work on a group I will call the Valkyrie, shortly to be commenced. This
work is inspired by Wagner’s opera “Die Walküre.” I shall set aside a time from my gadding about for this
work. Oh, yes. Even with my cynical outlook, I can be a gay dog at times.

“Perhaps, of the general tenor of this interview, I may be accused by shallow-thinking persons of being a consummate egotist.
(“My gosh!” the reporter thought; “he read my mind!”). Some may call me an overbearing braggart. But I hide much
behind the cloak of an artist—and I am an artist.”

Turning to his roommate, your scribe asked, awestruck, “How does it feel to room with a genius?”

Opening one eye, and stifling a yawn, he slowly replied, “I’ve often wondered.”

Staggering out in a daze, your reporter rushed to the typewriter to peck out this story. In no other condition
than a daze could it be done.

graduated from Davidson in the class of 1919 and has since distinguished himself by extensive research in the field of

Pan-American Day Is Observed On Campus

Pan-American Day was celebrated at a recent meeting of Sigma Delta Pi and the Spanish Club. Flags and other appropriate
symbols were displayed in the room. The program consisted of several talks concerning the celebrated day and other phases of
Pan-Americanism. Professor F. K. Fleagle gave a very interesting talk on Heroes and Writers of Mexico. Jack Branch and Oliver
Anderson, members of the Spanish Club, gave interesting talks, which were Pan-Americanism, Its Origin and Significance, and the Roerich Pact,
Signed on April 15th, respectively. After the program, the Spanish Club was excused, and the initiation of four new men
took place. The initiates are Cokey Branton, Earl Clark, Cole Windham, and Billy Merchant, all members of the Junior class.

G. R. Vowles Writes Article On German

An interesting and scholarly article on “Vagaries of the Modal Auxiliaries in German” was contributed to the March number of
the Modern Language Journal by Dr. Guy R. Vowles, professor of German in Davidson College. This article is an abridgment
of a paper read by Doctor Vowles last December before the German section of the South Atlantic Modern Language Association
at Charleston, S. C. “This paper,” we read in the opening paragraph, “essays to bring together and classify some of
the vagaries of the German modal auxiliaries and near modals. No attempt is made at an historical treatment, at regional
distinctions, or distinctions between colloquial and literary style.” The article contains one hundred quotations from forty authors, and gives evidence
of the most painstaking and discriminating observation on the part of the author gathered over a period of years from
writers such as Goethe, Lessing, Wassermann, and others.

FOUR HOURS TO KILL
Richard Barthelmess stages a terrific comeback in the role of a captured killer who is on his way to the
death house. He and the guard have four hours to kill between trains, and Barthelmess uses his time to avenge
his betrayal.

Thursday, May 2
STOLEN HARMONY
It's a Vera Caspary story about the kidnapping of a prominent orchestra while the B-flatters, jug blowers, etc., are traveling
cross-country in a bus, and is different enough to be interesting. Ben Bernie takes George Raft, fresh out of the
hoose-gow, into his band. One of the numbers, “Fagan, Youse Is a Viper,” is a stand-out.

Friday, May 3
LADDIE
The homespun life and romance of a middle west farmer boy who falls in love with a rich girl. The
theme follows closely the original novel by Gene Stratton-Porter.

Saturday, May 4
SPRING TONIC
This is a pleasant story of people being in love during that susceptible season of spring. Lew Ayres and Claire
Trevor are lovers, and the sighing Zazu Pitts adds the spice needed to keep it from being sappy.
