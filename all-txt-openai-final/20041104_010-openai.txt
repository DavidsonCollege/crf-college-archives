**Embracing our political diversity**

After a hard-fought and divisive campaign season, this year’s political elections fortunately ended without the ongoing recount tumults of four
years ago. While a recent Davidson poll shows that most students on campus may still be disappointed over the final
results, a record number of national voters made the ultimate choice that George W. Bush will be our president for
the next four years. Here at Davidson, a public opinion survey shows that 90 percent of students planned on voting
last Tuesday. No matter what your political persuasion, this election, unlike others of recent memory, truly brought out an increased
interest in politics and civic responsibility that we hope will not dissipate in years to come. Although our opinions may
vary sharply, high voter participation only increases the effectiveness, stability, and esteem of our great democracy.

Although Republicans and Democrats are almost equally divided nationally, here at Davidson students unsurprisingly tend to espouse liberalism more than
conservatism (for the 44 percent of Davidson students who don’t know which is which, liberal = Democrat and conservative =
Republican). But while the student body’s leftist leanings might alarm some, compared to most comparable undergraduate institutions Davidson’s political diversity
is significant. Unlike other schools that can have as much as an 80 percent - 20 percent breakdown, here at
Davidson about 54 percent of students are Democrats and 41 percent of students are Republicans.

Political ideologies can color and distort the way two people understand the same facts. In an academic environment, political diversity
is an important asset that many schools lack. In the weeks leading up to this election, many Davidson students were
able to engage in balanced and often heated political debates both inside and outside the classroom. Because of this, our
ability to better understand people who think differently than us is much higher than students at schools with wide political
majorities.

With all that said, it is clear that voters in our basic age group (18-29) err on the side of
Democrats. National exit polls showed our age group voting 54 percent - 45 percent in favor of John Kerry this
past election. While many often speak of the Davidson “bubble,” in terms of political diversity at our age group, Davidson
is actually very representative of the greater population. We can only hope that these patterns will persist. Already, students on
starkly opposing political sides just a few days ago are now coming together to understand and learn from this past
election. On the national scale, as well, we can never forget how lucky we are to live in a political
system where after the election, a leader is always chosen and the loser always concedes.

**In commitment to end fraternities**

Over the last few years, it has become apparent that the school administration has taken up a policy to slowly
extinguish fraternal organizations. Patterson Court has slowly changed from being a safe and controlled place of drinking, to a tool
used by administrators to enact new rules and regulations over eating houses and fraternities. Being a member of the court
has shown me just how far the administration will go in using intimidation and scare tactics to bring down fraternity
membership and eventually the fraternities themselves.

It is ridiculous that campus police, or “campus safety,” can call themselves that. Promoting safety certainly doesn’t mean giving citations
to a friend who had a couple of drinks and is taking a risk by helping another student home who
drank too much. Those persons will certainly think twice before “helping” a person who may truly be in need of
help again. Campus safety has also become more out of touch with students and is driving their Gestapo tactics zealously
on Patterson Court. Just because there is an Honor Code doesn’t mean that they can throw away your civil rights.
A student always has the right to take the Fifth. Davidson Police who question students immediately and aggressively seem to
insinuate that if they don’t answer their brutal questioning they are in violation of the Honor Code.

Patterson Court has trapped fraternities on campus under policies that the administration intends for them to break. This is why
each year the school brings about new policies one step at a time: to limit opposition. Let me make this
clear to the administration. You cannot stop drinking, partying, and social life. You are treading on dangerous waters and endangering
student lives by forcing them off campus and increasing the number of people who drive drunk and drink carelessly. For
shame.

**Thefacebook.com is ruining a generation**

By Halley Aelion, Staff Columnist

Do you hear it? Listen carefully. It’s not the sound of the crack of the bat in the World Series.
It’s not even the squabbling of politicians in the upcoming election. It’s... nothing. It’s silence. Silence interrupted by the tapping
of a keyboard and the click of a mouse. Students on Davidson’s campus are spending hours in this silence, and
in some extreme cases, days. What is responsible for this eerie hush, this voluntary isolation of Davidson students in their
rooms, glued to their computer monitors? No, no, don’t fool yourself. It’s not school work. It is the one and
only Facebook.com. Thefacebook.com. It’s an innocent name for a dangerous phenomenon. An endless waste of time, this virtual social hierarchy
represents all that is detrimental about technology in today’s...world: it promotes our generation’s obsession with superficial social standing while devaluing
the importance of person-to-person relationships. Furthermore, it is 100 percent addictive and it is not going away. Each student to
join Facebook begins with good intentions. “Why not try it?” they figure. It could be fun... everyone else is doing
it. But like so many bad things in the world (drugs, caffeine, pogs, Hanson), Facebook is addictive. Members become obsessed
with their online persona. They feel they must be by a computer at all times in case they have accumulated
more “friends” or received important e-mails. Triumphant cries of “I have 300 friends! Beat THAT!” occasionally break the quiet that
has fallen on Davidson’s dorms, but soon after, both the jealous onlookers and the elated announcer return to their respective
screens.

So what becomes of the actual friends? Especially those few who refuse to log onto the virtual world and prefer
to live their lives on the physical and real earth? They are left behind, rolling their eyes at the stupidity
that is Facebook. But those that are hooked take no notice. Who cares about real friends if you cannot brag
about their existence in your profile? Why spend a quality hour with one close confidante when you can spend that
same hour sending pointless messages to fifty shallow acquaintances? These are the messages Facebook sends. I’ve heard what people claim
about how it is an invaluable tool used to reconnect with old friends and classmates, but I, for one, remain
skeptical. If it is really so good to hear from those people again, why not take the time to look
them up in a phone book and give them a good-old fashioned telephone call? Move your mouth, not your fingers,
and have a real conversation! Not having enough time is not an excuse: look at all the time Facebook consumes.

So break free, Davidson! Just say no to Facebook. Get out of your dorm and go! It doesn’t matter where:
take some friends to a soccer game, go see a play, go out to eat. Remember where you are: there
are 1600 other young, fascinating, intelligent people around you, just waiting to be your real friend (although I’m sure they
wouldn’t mind adding you to their list of “Facebook friends” as soon as they’re done meeting you).

Why are we all such a bunch of sissies?

Yowl Editor

Recently, I checked my e-mail and was surprised to find an e-mail from a member of a campus organization that
the Yowl has parodied in the past. The contents of the e-mail contained a thinly veiled threat on my physical
and emotional well-being if I chose to satirize a newsworthy incident about his organization. In this case, I was more
amused than worried because he is my dawg, but the incident still rankled me. Part of the issue was that
the threat of physical violence was used to intimidate me. Now, I might be wrong, but outside of organized crime
syndicates and other illegal ventures, physical harm is not commonly accepted in this country as a method of coercion. I
might not be a pacifist, but I strongly disagree with people being threatened for either their beliefs or their reporting,
however spurious that reporting in the Yowl might be.

Still, I think that the incident illustrates something more insidious than Davidson students’ propensities to use violence to get what
they want. Pretty much, there is no muckraking at Davidson. Trust me, I am no countercultural guru, but I still
feel stifled here. Whether it comes from the students, the faculty, or the administration, the Davidson culture strongly discourages people
from making waves. There seems to be a controlled apathy at Davidson; it’s far more politic to not show strong
feelings. How many students came out against the Trustee religious requirement? How many students ask what exactly Smart Enforcer does
to their computers? For no fault of the Editors who do their best under severe constraints, to me the Davidsonian
sometimes seems like a press release for the school. If one does write something that bothers, say an athletic team,
the whole team will see themselves as being the victims of some injustice; as the theory goes, criticism of the
school or its organizations shows a lack of school spirit and is somehow dishonorable. The Davidson rule seems to indicate
that in order to be well liked, don’t argue and don’t be controversial. The reluctance to cause disagreements may stem
from Davidson’s conservative roots, small size, or high academic workload, but we still need to transcend those hurdles. Without strong
opinions, we cannot have proper intellectual discourse.

When I speak of the deficiency of intellectual atmosphere at Davidson, I am certainly not critiquing a dearth of intelligentsia
debating abstractions to all hours of the night. On the contrary, I could not care less about Proust or Hegel.
It was the lack of pretensions that attracted me to Davidson in the first place. But, without student activism, the
school will settle in a rut. We are all worse off without learning how to properly argue for our opinions.
We are in college. This is our chance to express ourselves. Let’s mobilize and get something that we want; if
it’s not religious diversity on the Trustees, at least better food in Commons. I’m not asking for Wesleyan, but students
need to put themselves out there for their beliefs. Our number one Quality of Life ranking on the Princeton Review
should not be caused by going through college in some Novocain-like state of bliss, but instead on feeling as if
we are challenged every day, not just by our courses, but by our peers as well.
