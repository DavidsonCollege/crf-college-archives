10 THE DAVIDSONIAN

Curtis Young
Staff Writer

Potential NFL players descended upon Indianapolis to participate in the annual NFL Draft Combine last week. The combine consists of
several components that are designed to help scouts determine how effective a player will be in the NFL. Hundreds of
potential draftees enter the combine after months of preparation with the hope of improving their draft stock.

Combine week is a veritable heaven for NFL draft gurus everywhere. Pundits analyze prospects’ times in the 40-yard dash down
to the hundredth of a second. For example, a time of 4.59 for a tailback means the prospect has breakaway
speed. A time of 4.60 means that the prospect might not be fast enough to run away from linebackers and
get into the second level of a defense. Read that again. I’m serious. Pundits make a huge deal out of
a guy running a 4.6 versus a 4.59. Never mind that players do not even wear pads during the combine
drills. Forget the years of college film that have shown what they can actually do on the field. The combine
has become extremely important, and no one knows it better than the prospects.

I am here to tell you that the combine workout should have very little effect on a player’s draft status.
The workout at the combine is the NFL’s version of the SAT. Perhaps it used to tell scouts something about
the athleticism and ability of a player. I do not discount this possibility. This, however, is no longer the case.
Players spend months now preparing for these workouts. Like the SAT, combine workouts have come to indicate mostly how well
a player prepared for the workout and the types of exercises performed in front of the scouts. They no longer
measure actual athletic ability, but rather the ability to manipulate the system.

There are countless stories of “workout warriors” that struggle in the pros. Last year, Appalachian State Wide Receiver Dexter Jackson
wowed scouts with a forty time under 4.30. He parlayed that performance into a second-round selection by the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers. Perhaps Jackson should have remained on the track instead of the field, however, as he did not catch a
single pass and struggled with running routes in his rookie season. Make no mistake; the Bucs were not exactly a
team stacked with receiving talent either.

It does not only work in one direction, however. Several years ago, Anquan Boldin of Florida State saw his stock
plummet after running a time of 4.7. What is he doing now? He’s one of the top receivers in the
league and had the greatest rookie season in NFL history. He’s not the only success story, though. Jerry Rice, the
greatest Wide Receiver ever to play the game, also clocked in at 4.7. What do all these success stories have
in common? They happened in college. College performance is still the best indicator of professional success. If a player struggles
to produce in college, he will likely struggle even worse at the professional level. Scouts need to realize that there
must be some reason that a player did not produce in college and do their best to figure out why.
Maybe the reason is legitimate. Or maybe the player cannot handle it when the pads come on and the whistle
blows.

I do not believe that all aspects of the combine are bad. I do think that interviewing players should be
an important component of any team’s draft board. Personnel men around the league can often tell if a player is
going to be a problem in the locker room by observing and questioning him in an interview. Also, the physical
exam is extremely important. Teams get to have their doctors examine whether or not a player is an injury risk
at the combine. This is an important practice as franchises are about to invest millions of dollars in a player
without NFL experience.

While there are some positives, the NFL Combine is generally overrated, overhyped, and a poor measure of a prospect’s abilities
on a football field. Teams want to see how a guy prepares and handles the pressure, but I believe that
they should almost disregard the actual results of the workout. College performance means so much more, and there are countless
examples. You can take your Dexter Jackson and his 4.2. I’ll take a Jerry Rice or Anquan Boldin any day
of the week and twice on Sunday.

In the final meet of the 2008-2009 wrestling regular season, the Wildcats came up with a hefty 29-14 victory over
Duquesne. The meet was held on Sunday afternoon inthe Palumbo Center outside Pittsburgh, Pa. The meet began with the 125-pound
match, as Ben Altman ’10 took on Duquesne’s Chamberlain. Chamberlain got the best of Altman 10-0, and that gave the
Dukes an early 4-0 lead. That lead would not last for very long, as the Wildcats won four of the
next five matches, three of which ended in a pin. In the 133-pound match, Alex Radsky ’11 got the Wildcats
on the scoreboard by pinning Taylor Wilde in 2:24. That put the Wildcats ahead of the Dukes 6-4. In the
141-pound match, Vitaly Radsky ’11 defeated Jayk Cobbs by a score of 15-9. This win increased the Wildcat lead to
9-4.

In the 149-pound match, David DeCamp ’12 pinned Josh Pascazi in 2:58, which extended the lead to 15-4. Just when
it looked as if the Wildcats would run away with this match, the Dukes’ Nathan Reinhart defeated Carl Sandercock 7-6,
which cut the Wildcat lead to 15-7. The third and final Wildcat pin was accomplished by Tyler Mullen ’12 in
the 165-pound weight class. Mullen pinned Matt Gregg in 2:25, and this win pushed the Wildcat lead to 21-7. Duquesne’s
Ryan Sula defeated Kevin Cook ’09 12-3, and the result of that match cut the Wildcat lead down to 21-11.
Cook’s classmate Sam O’Hair ’09 got the Wildcats back on track with an 18-3 decision, which once again pushed their
lead to 26-11. In the 197-pound match, the Dukes got closer to the Wildcats for the final time, as Scott
Black defeated Jorge Estrada ’12 6-3, which cut the lead to 26-14. Charlie Wolff ’11 finished off the match for
the Wildcats, as he defeated John Simmons 6-2, which made the final tally 29-14. This was the final regular season
meet for Sam O’Hair and Kevin Cook, both of whom had great careers as Wildcat wrestlers. The Wildcats’ season comes
to an end in two weeks (Mar. 7) when they travel to Charleston, S.C. for the Southern Conference Championships.
