Tsunami, from page 1

their experiences in India.
“There have been so many different venues for response that I have felt overwhelmed at times,” Katherine Sorrell ’06 said. “That is why I have appreciated coming back to Davidson and brainstorming with the group about tangible and effective options.”

Although the program participants spent most of their 14 weeks living at the Madras Christian College, which is about five miles inland, they made several trips to the coastal areas that were later devastated by the giant waves.

“Being in India made me even more aware of the essential connectedness of human beings,” Sorrell said. “I feel very strongly that we are all connected to this tragedy, although we may not feel it in tangible ways.”

Participants of the India program stayed at the Ideal Beach Resort for three nights while they visited ancient temples in the coastal town Mamallapuran.

Many students had the opportunity to visit the small fishing villages that surrounded the plush hotel.

Julienne Alexander ’07 recalls the excitement of the village kids when they met the young group of American tourists.

“As soon as we left the resort grounds, all these little kids came up to us,” Alexander said. “They showed us these rotted fish and loved to watch us get grossed out. After playing with them for a while, some of us went into the village and visited their families.”

Professor of History and Humanities Jonathan Berkey, who led the India program, said that the areas surrounding their hotel were very poor.

“If you got up in the morning, you could get out and see fishermen coming in and unloading their catch. They went out in small wooden skips and news outlets have reported that a lot of fishermen around the area were killed or are missing.”

Although he has not learned anything specific about the Ideal Beach Resort, reports indicate that many resorts in the area were shut down by the tsunami.

Even after spending several months in India, Peyton Purcell ’06 says she still has trouble grasping the full extent of the tsunami's destruction.

“I do not think I necessarily have a clearer view of the devastation and profound sense of loss that occurred than any other student on campus,” Purcell said. “But it is strange to have visited India and to have such a connection to it, and to know the places they speak of on the news.”

Sorrell learned about disease control in Madras and other urban areas during her public health class in India.

“I have spent a lot of time thinking about the disease that will erupt into that entire metropolis area as a result,” Sorrell said. “Just when things look as though they cannot get worse, it appears that the tsunami is going to have utterly devastating long-term effects.”
