Stoops kicked off Engage for Change’s two weeks of events on Monday night.

**Stoops addresses need for homeless legislation**

Acting Executive Director of the National Coalition for the Homeless Michael Stoops spoke on the need to end homelessness by
addressing its root problems. “Volunteerism alone, acts of mercy alone, acts of kindness alone are not addressing the issue,” Stoops
said.

Stoops’ talk was the first in a two-week series of events planned by Engage for Change, a new student organization
focusing on hunger and homelessness.

“Nobody would ever want to be homeless. Other than going to war, being homeless is one of the worst things
that could happen to you.” — Michael Stoops, National Coalition for the Homeless

Stoops discussed the ongoing efforts of the National Coalition for the Homeless to convince congressmen of the need for legislation
concerning the homeless. “I see this as a moral test for us as to how we treat those who are
down and out in this country,” Stoops said.

The Coalition has lobbied for legislation since its founding in the 1980s, when it won a lawsuit in New York
that established the right to shelter for homeless people. “In the winter of 1986-87, [late advocate for the homeless] Mitch
Snyder and I took it to the streets for a six-month winter vigil,” Stoops said. “We were living on the
streets with the homeless.” Four months after the winter vigil, Congress passed the Stewart McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, which is
currently the only legislation for the homeless.

Although the act offers support for the homeless, Stoops said that it only provides for emergency situations. According to Stoops,
the federal government only spends $1.5 million to fight homelessness. Poverty in America has increased by 14 percent since 2001,
and children now make up 25 percent of the homeless population.

“We have people who are working who are homeless,” Stoops said. “When you graduate from college, you are going to
be facing the same problems that the working poor are facing.”

The Coalition is currently working to pass the Bringing America Home Act through Congress, which Stoops said will effectively end
homelessness in this country. Fifty-five Democrats introduced the act in the last session of Congress, and it was reintroduced in
the current session. According to Stoops, the act would allow the construction of a substantial number of low-income housing units
and would provide subsidies to people in low-paying jobs. The act, however, lacks the Republican support that it needs to
pass through Congress.

“Americans are not working quickly enough,” Stoops said. “We’ve been working on certain pieces of legislation since the 1980s.” Stoops
emphasized the importance of making poverty a key issue in the 2008 presidential election.

Homelessness has been a serious issue in America since the 1980s, when there were between two and three million people
living on the streets after the Reagan administration’s tax cuts for the wealthy and entitlement cuts for the poor. “We’ve
all grown accustomed to seeing homeless people on the street,” Stoops said.

Stoops also addressed the common misperception that people choose to be homeless. “Nobody would ever want to be homeless,” Stoops
said. “Other than going to war, being homeless is one of the worst things that could happen to you.”

Stoops showed two videos of incidents of violence, including beatings and a burning, against homeless people. The tapes also included
an appearance Stoops made on the Daily Show with Jon Stewart. Stoops condemned “bum-vertising,” a term used by a man
in California who paid homeless people three dollars to hang advertisements for his online poker business from their signs.

Stoops also showed a short film by an...

Officer went to Tomlinson Dormitory in reference to a report about a group of underage students possibly involved in a
drinking game. Upon arriving, the officer heard noises indicating they were engaged in such activity. When the officer knocked on
the door, the room grew silent, and an occupant of the room opened the door. The officer observed a fold-up
table designed for playing drinking games set up with cups of beer. There were numerous cups and empty and near-empty
beer cans in the room, and five unopened cans of beer were confiscated. There were two people in the room
with the student who opened the door, one of whom was asleep and had not been involved in the game.
The officer asked the student to make everyone who had left the room through the bathroom return, and four students

had slept through the incident. All subjects were cooperative and polite with the reporting officer.

room and observed that both windows in the room were raised, a brown blanket was under the door, and a
rubber glove had been placed over the smoke detector. The officer searched the room, but no marijuana or other paraphernalia
was found. The room’s occupants were not present, but photos were taken of the room’s interior.
