**Double the major, double the pain?**

The always important and ever-so-ambiguous concept of Davidson’s liberal arts education is being threatened by over-ambitious and credential-driven students.

A front-page story this week reports ongoing discussion within the faculty on banning double majors. The reasons against double majoring are made clear by faculty members — double majors detract from a liberal arts education and encourage students to prioritize resume padding over academic exploration.

The answer, say those opposed to double majors, is regulations and limitations.

Who’s detracting from the liberal arts education now?

Davidson College’s education mission is “to teach all students to think clearly, to make relevant and valid judgments, to discriminate among values, and to communicate freely with others in the realm of ideas.”

From the looks of it, disallowing double majors will signal a failure of this mission.

As students pointed out in the article, double majoring has actually enhanced their liberal arts education, allowing them to pursue new ideas to the fullest extent and think more analytically than they felt was possible with one major.

The second argument for disallowing double majors targets a trend in students to build resumes and accumulate academic credentials.

If it weren’t for credentials and useless additions to one’s resume, faculty members would walk into empty classrooms every day. The truth is that Davidson, and all other undergrad and graduate schools, accept students based on their credentials.

If double majors are revoked simply because the credential is claimed to be useless, we need to rethink admissions policies, Career Service workshops on resume building, and study abroad applications, among other things.

In other words, instead of worrying about whether students should have one or two majors, maybe we need to rethink the values of our academic institutions.

Is the faculty ready for this task?

It’s hard to argue against the opinion that students decide to double major for the additional credential. And let’s say that this credential is worthless, that a political science major can equally go to law school and to grad school for chemistry. Should the school save students from making the awful decision by outlawing double majors?

No.

**Town police strong enough already**

In an interview with the Lake Norman Times on Oct. 29, Davidson Town Police Chief John Kearin boasts of the visibility of his force.

In addition to having enough cruisers for his twenty officers to take home, Kearin’s force boasts a new Ford Explorer, a Dodge Durango K-9, a motorcycle, a crime scene van, two jet skis, and a Ford Mustang that was seized in a drug bust. He wanted to purchase a Hummer. He wants “eight or ten more police officers and support staff.”

And his special wish: a helicopter. For “surveillance and special operations,” he says.

Chief Fountain Walker of Campus Public Safety, who promised when he got here to provide community policing, should provide a good example against a town police department too proud of its blacked-out-glass style of enforcement.

A police force has gained too much power when it bases itself on perpetual acquisition and constant surveillance in an effort to proclaim its strength.
