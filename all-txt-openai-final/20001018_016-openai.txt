#### Cats earn revenge with double overtime win over Morehead St.
**Matt Garfield, News Editor**

Ryan Crawford is growing accustomed to winning games for Davidson. The senior All-America cornerback’s weekly late-game heroics this time helped the Wildcats top Morehead State 38-31 in a double-overtime thriller on Oct. 7, and avenge last year’s ugly season-opening 40-0 loss to the Eagles.

For the second straight week, Crawford blocked a field-goal attempt and broke up the game’s final pass play to secure a Davidson victory. With the score tied at 24 late in the fourth quarter and the Eagles lined up for a potential game-winning field goal, Crawford streaked in from the left side of the defensive line and blocked the kick, sending the game into overtime. Later, Crawford batted down Eagles’ quarterback David Dinkins’ fourth-down attempt in double-overtime to secure the Wildcats’ fourth victory of the season.

“We knew we had a different team this year,” said Crawford. “We really came in with a different attitude.”

With the victory, Joe Susan became the first head coach in Davidson football history to start with a 4-0 mark. This is also the first time Davidson has started a season 4-0 since reaching the Tangerine Bowl in 1969.

Crawford’s supporting cast featured usual suspects like junior tailback Bryan Fish, who rushed 26 times for 142 yards, including a 60-yard touchdown run on the first play of the game. Sophomore quarterback Paul Nichols passed for 221 yards and four touchdowns, spreading the ball to four different receivers for each score: Corey Crawford, Mike Chase, Mike Tarver, and Fish.

Davidson entered the fourth quarter with a seemingly comfortable 24-14 lead but saw it slowly disappear in a fourth quarter dominated by Dinkins and the Eagles.

In overtime, each offense trades possessions on the opponents’ 25-yard line. The first team to score and stop the other team from scoring wins. A coin toss determines who gets the first crack. Davidson won the first coin toss and elected to go on defense. But it took Morehead St. only three plays to score a touchdown, thus forcing the Wildcats’ offense into a score-or-lose situation. On 3rd and 6, Nichols connected with Tarver to even the score and force a second overtime. This time Davidson took first possession, and on the third play, Mike Chase hauled in a 23-yard touchdown pass to make it 38-31.

Enter Ryan Crawford and the defense. Safety Kevin Strange and linebackers Adam Elmore, Freeman Belser, and Jim Carney made key tackles to force the Eagles into a fourth down at the 18-yard line. Dinkins heaved a last-gasp attempt to the back of the end zone, but Crawford leapt into the air and batted it down to end the game.

#### Offutt leads women’s tennis at Harvard Tournament
**By Steve Aldrich, Staff Writer**

Led by freshman Lindsey Offutt, the Women’s Tennis team had a very good showing at the 2000 Harvard Fall Invitational. Offutt, playing in just her second collegiate tournament, recorded an impressive victory over Harvard’s Lara Naqushbandi in the finals of flight two.

“This was an excellent tournament,” Offutt said. “This fall has been very productive for us and it was great to see our hard work pay off against such good competition.”

Offutt had to defeat two very strong opponents on her way to her big victory in the finals. Offutt’s victory in the semi-finals against Arden Fredeking of Dartmouth was rather uneventful when compared to her nail-biting 7-6, 6-4 triumph over Fleur Broughton of Harvard.

“The competition was excellent,” Offutt said. “We all did a good job against some very strong players.”

Head Coach Caroline Price was pleased with her team’s progress throughout the fall season. “We had a very strong September,” Coach Price said. “Our showings at the N.C. State Invitational and at Harvard are very positive. We have worked hard and I think there are some great things that we can build on for the future.”spring.” Offutt was not the only Wildcat who had a good showing in Massachusetts. Junior Forbes Wildcats extend nation’s best win streak to 12 Matt Garfield News Editor San Diego couldn’t stop Davidson from winning its fifth game of the season last Saturday. The same can’t be said for the elevator at the San Diego Town and Country Hotel. Almost. While leaving the hotel for the stadium, four players, including All-America cornerback Ryan Crawford, were trapped inside the elevator when the door wouldn’t open. Fortunately for head coach Joe Susan and the temporarily panicked Wildcats, Crawford and his mates were able to escape through an overhead hatch and make it to the game for kickoff. “I told them to start stretching in the elevator,” said Susan. “They showed up in time to play a pretty good game.”

Despite the best efforts of the elevator and the Toreros of San Diego, Davidson’s California dreams came true in a 27-13 victory, the Wildcats' 12th straight win dating back to last season. The 5-0 start is the team’s best since the 1969 season and is just the third time ever to begin a season with five victories. Susan credits his team’s success this season to two major factors: focus and consistency in practice. “The kids have done such a great job of making transitions week-to-week, and not getting too high after a victory and letting it spill over to the next week,” he said. “We’re fortunate that we have enough skill to spread the ball around. It makes us harder to defend.”

In Saturday’s game, quarterback Paul Nichols sparked the offense, completing 21-of-33 passes for 285 yards and two touchdowns. Receiver Corey Crawford had a career-high nine receptions and 156 yards and one touchdown. Linebacker Bo Henderson had a school-record four sacks, giving him a school-best 25 for his career. “Bo really came hard with a very powerful, aggressive rush,” said Susan. “He set the tone for our defense.” Crawford blocked his sixth punt to tie a Division I-AA record for blocked punts in a season.

In the opening quarter, Davidson dominated both sides of the ball and jumped out to a 10-0 lead. The defense held San Diego without a first down and negative yardage. The offense, meanwhile, had the ball for 12:10 of a possible 15 minutes, gaining 146 yards on 29 plays. “With San Diego playing primarily man-to-man defense, we knew we could make some plays if we could get Nichols some time to pick them apart,” said Susan. “He made some very good decisions and hung in there even under pressure.”

The victory helped Davidson keep pace with Robert Morris, 17-13 winners over Dayton, for the longest winning streak in I-AA at 12 consecutive victories. Nebraska is the only I-A team with a 12-game win streak.

Thompson played well in a quarterfinal loss to Cynthia Tow in flight one. Tow was the eventual winner of the top flight in the tournament. Thompson also teamed with Offutt to finish fourth in flight one of the doubles competition. There were five schools participating in the tournament. In addition to Davidson, Harvard, and Dartmouth, Boston College and Boston University were also in attendance. There were no overall team results, as this was strictly a singles and doubles tournament with separate flights. The women’s team was 7-13 last spring and posted a 3-7 record against Southern Conference competition.
