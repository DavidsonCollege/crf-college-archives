THREE DANCES IN SET

Mask Ball Friday Night To Be
Novel Affair

This week-end will find the
class of 1938 in the role of
hosts to the student body at
their Junior Speaking dances
to be held Friday and Saturday,
March 19 and 20 in Hotel
Charlotte Ballroom.

In keeping with the approaching
holiday spirit, the Juniors promise
to afford the very best in spring
frolics, aided by the styled music
of Earl Mellen. The set will consist
of three dances: Friday night
masked ball from 10:00 to 2:00;
Saturday afternoon tea dance from
4:30 to 6:30; and the Saturday night
dance from 8:30 to 12:00.

At the masked ball Friday night,
balloons, confetti, streamers, and
masks will be donated free by the
committee. Also, there will be a
novel figure, and the ballroom will
be decorated in an unusual fashion.

Mellen and his orchestra, who
have just recently finished an
engagement at the Chatterbox Room
in the William Penn, Pittsburgh,
Pa., have proved very popular at
college dances and are very much
in demand. This past week-end,
several of the members of the Davidson
student body heard him, and
they report that he was acclaimed
by all those present.

The following girls, pictured to
the left, will be sponsors for the
Speaking dances and dates of the
members of the Junior Committee:
Miss James of Charlotte will lead
the figure with James Dorsett,
president of the Junior class and a
member of Phi Gamma Delta fraternity;
Miss Shull of Charlotte,
with Yates Faison, Sigma Alpha Epsilon;
Miss Cook of Salisbury, with
Henry Lyons, Sigma Phi Epsilon;
Miss Lucas of Florence, S. C., with
Phillip Arrowsmith, Pi Kappa Phi;
Miss Willis of Concord, with Martin
Lafferty, Pi Kappa Alpha; Miss
Batte of Concord, with Fred Dennis,
Kappa Alpha; Miss Howard of
Kinston, with Howard King, Kappa
Sigma; Miss Knowlton of Charlotte
with Harry McLaughlin, Beta Theta
Pi; and Miss Musick of Laurel,
Miss., with Billie B. Crooks, Phi
Delta Theta.

Besides the regular committee
members, there will also be an alternate
member from each fraternity
to appear in the Friday night
figure with his date. The following
consist of nine fraternity and
two non-fraternity men with their
girls: Jerry Harris, Sigma Phi Epsilon,
with Charlotte McAden of
Charlotte; Wade Barrow, Kappa
Sigma, with Harriet Boyd of Co-
