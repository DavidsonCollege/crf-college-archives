**BACK PAGE INTERVIEW**

**Tuesday, March 19, 1996**

After confronting a hostile audience, Christine Hoff Sommers talks to two Davidson women about equity feminism, Harlequin romance novels, and Hillary Clinton.

**Dr. Mills:** In your book, you suggest that the “new feminists,” or the “gender feminists,” may learn to “divest themselves of the sex/gender lens” through which they view “social reality” and join the equity feminist mainstream. Just give me some definitions. How do you define feminism?

**CHS:** Well, there are many different schools, but I make a distinction. I think there is a fundamental distinction between what I call equity feminism and gender feminism. I hope everyone is an equity feminist because that is about simple fairness, according women the same rights as men, equality before the law, educational parity. It’s, I think, very American; it is grounded in the United States Constitution. Gender feminism is very different. Gender feminism grew out, not out of the Enlightenment or the United States Constitution. It’s developed from the radical politics of the 60s. Its philosophical mentors would be Karl Marx or Marcuse, very radical. It views American society as a patriarchy in which women are a subordinate class. And the entire thing must be radically transformed. So, equity feminism is about reform and changing laws and improving the condition of women; gender feminism is about dismantling the patriarchy. It is a very different and far more radical philosophy. And I feel the majority of the leaders in the feminist movement, including the majority of the professional feminists in women’s studies departments, are more on the side of gender feminists than equity feminists.

**Dr. Mills:** Just to clarify for me, what exactly is the lens through which equity feminism views reality?

**CHS:** Equity or gender?

**Dr. Mills:** Equity.

**CHS:** Oh, equity feminists. It’s not a lens. You just look for fairness. Also, I would hope equity feminists are not ideologues. They are not rigidly attached to certain perspectives, so most equity feminists could allow for diversity. Some women are going to want to be traditional moms, traditional wives. Others will want to be very independent, and that is very much in the spirit of equity feminism, giving women options, giving them choices. Gender feminism will be very critical of a woman that availed herself of traditional choices to become a traditional wife and mother. She would explain to her why she was playing into traditional gender roles. She would think that this woman was someone who needed her consciousness raised. I call that elitist. How can you call any American woman benighted and ignorant? We are among the most educated and enlightened women in the world. So, it is a very different perspective. An equity woman seems to me to not need a lot of explanation, it is purely simple. It just says that women enjoy the same rights as men, but you are not on an exotic hunt for bias under every bed, as I feel the gender feminists are.

**Jenny:** You say that you are a “feminist who does not like what feminism has become.” How do you envision the feminist movement? What would you like to see women doing, or is there nothing to be done anymore?

**CHS:** Well, first of all, just look around because women are doing it. Look at contemporary America and you see that feminism, equity feminism, is the great American success story. And it all started in the second wave of feminism in the mid-70s. It went so fast. The gender feminists, they are bitter, they’ll say, “oh, we only earn 71 cents on the dollar.” An equity feminist would say, “My God, we started, the wage gap was enormous; it is closing so quickly.” And it is not 71 cents on the dollar, that is just a pessimistic overstatement of how bad it is. They want to give the most negative bent on anything that is happening to women. If there is bad news, the gender feminists are right there to exaggerate it. If there is good news, they don’t see it. What they don’t see is if you control for length of time in the workplace, same education, and you look at young women and young men, the wage gap is gone. They don’t do that. They want to take women like my sister who was out of the job market for 20 years, compare her earnings with those of a full-time male, and say there is discrimination. It is not discrimination; she made a very different choice. She stayed home with children for about 20 years.

**Jenny:** So, do you think there is anything women do need to be working on to improve their situation?

**CHS:** Oh yes. I would say the glass is three-quarters full and getting fuller, but first of all there are still troglodytes out there or, if you will, sexists. Males and women who just don’t believe women are as intelligent as men or think that women are just hysterical, and they are just wrong, they are ill-informed. So that is always important, to discredit the stereotypes. But the gender feminists replace those with a whole bunch of stereotypes about men. And they see masculinity as dangerous, something that needs to be controlled or changed. Well, the majority of American women are not going to be grateful to gender feminism if they are able to control masculinity. I mean, we are not at war with men. So, I think there are improvements, but the other thing is, we have got to have a certain grace in victory. There are many areas where we have been so successful. Is it now the males we have to worry about? In schools, women are now 55% of college enrollment. And more boys drop out; boys get lower grades. Boys in high school are further behind. So I don’t want to be gender chauvinist. I don’t like male chauvinists and I don’t like female chauvinists. I prefer a feminism that is grounded in fairness. By the way, a follow-up answer is that the real battles of oppression are not in the United States. I do not feel that the language of gender feminism is appropriate in this country because women have made so much progress. But are there third world countries where it does make sense to talk about systemic oppression and patriarchy? Yes. So that is another thing. We have had our first and second waves of feminism. American women are the freest in the world. And I do think there is an obligation to help women in other parts of the world. But again I hope that is equity feminism and not gender feminism. I don’t think we should export our male-bashing and victimology.

**Dr. Mills:** In your book, you speak about the majority of women’s studies classes, and you refer to that type of class and other classes that teach the “reconceptualization of subject matter” as “unscholarly and intolerant of dissent.”and full of gimmicks.” What is your ideal classroom?

CHS: Well, as a philosophy professor, in my ideal classroom, I address some of the very things that in feminist pedagogy a critic would find very masculinist. I like to, if possible, assign the great works of philosophy. As a feminist, I want women to read Plato and Aristotle or Descartes and like it. I don’t want to spend their time saying, “Well, they were sexist and women were....” That is not how you empower women. You empower them by giving them the kind of quality education that young men traditionally were able to have. So that is the first thing: I use books by DWEMs, the dead white European males. And I try to set high standards; I want students to work very hard. And in the classroom, I encourage debate. If I teach a controversial issue, I consider it a sacred command of college teaching to give both sides. I have a set of opinions, but I never see the classroom as a place for me to export my opinions. I would feel that class was a failure. I don’t want to get papers where they write exactly what I said. That’s depressing. What you do as a teacher is you give students the tools to develop their own ideas, draw their own conclusions. You don’t give them conclusions. And in too many women’s studies classes, they get, “we live in a patriarchy.” And they only learn about the world from a feminist perspective. Well, the feminist perspective, the gender feminist perspective, is important, but it is only one of dozens. So if young women are only given in their women’s studies programs the feminist perspective, or the feminist-Freudian perspective, or the feminist-Marxist perspective, but they are never given the Freudian perspective, or the traditional, the behaviorist perspective or the liberal or conservative or whatever; there are so many theories of human nature; they should study all of it. I think young women can be just as aggressive in debate as young men, and if they are not, I encourage them to be so.

Jenny: There has been some debate about your description of Scarlett O’Hara’s encounter with Rhett Butler in Gone With the Wind, and “ravishing” versus “rape.” Why did you choose that scene when discussing rape scenes, and do you think there is something different about southern women?

CHS: Well, that is a scene which is the most popular in cinematic history, among women. I mean, men don’t remember it, but women love that, they love that scene and it’s in the movie poster, just very famous and very popular. And it is classic. It’s not just Gone With the Wind, it’s not just southern women; there’s a scene like that in every romance story, you know the bodice-rippers, the romance novels, Harlequins. It is a standard scene of a sexual encounter, being overtaken, not raped, but “ravished” is the word I guess you would use in the case of Scarlett O’Hara. And again, I’m not just sitting here wringing my hands and thinking, “oh no, we’re so oppressed, we have to change so women don’t have these fantasies.” And there are women who are very upset with the Harlequin novels and the Gone With the Wind; they want to rewrite the script, they want to change it. And I think they don’t understand that women don’t have fantasies, women don’t want to be raped, don’t want to have anything to do with that. But obviously, if we look at the sales of these books, there is something about that kind of fantasy that appeals to millions of women, and it’s cross-cultural. These Harlequin novels, they sell all over the world. So, it’s not southern women. And the other thing that bothers me is women read these romance novels and men think they are silly and criticize women for reading them. And the feminists think we’re silly and criticize us for reading them. Everybody’s down on women, but if you go to the airports, there’s the romance novels for the women and the spy/adventure novels for the guys. They often have a guy overpowered by a beautiful woman; read James Bond. You know, it’s going on, and yet it’s the women who get criticized and I just think it’s innocent pleasure, a sexual reverie that turns out to be, I guess, a quite common thing in literature.

Dr. Mills: I couldn’t wait to ask you about what you think of Hillary Clinton’s treatment in the press. Do you feel that she is being bashed, or rightly responded to?

CHS: Oh, that is such a big subject and everyone has opinions. At some levels I feel sorry for her, but she did bring so much of it on herself. I mean, what was she thinking? That she could go in having some experience as a governor’s wife and a lawyer at the Rose Law Firm, and she could go and rehabilitate the entire American medical establishment? That is not a triumph of feminism, it’s a triumph of being married to someone who gives you this great plum job. So I don’t think she is a feminist heroine in that sense, and she does invite a certain amount of satire. I think it’s absurd for people to say the press isn’t ready for a strong woman. The press is ready for strong women. There’s Margaret Thatcher, there’s Christie Todd Whitman, there’s Elizabeth Dole—she’s a strong woman. I think that there’s been cruelty to her; it has gone overboard, but to say that people can’t handle strong women seems to me to be a bit absurd. There’s strong women all over.

Dr. Mills: I was thinking more about her open statements about herself as a feminist.

CHS: I don’t think she’s been that open about it. I know feminists have sort of looked to her to be kind of a leader, and I don’t think she’s been that eager to be there. I see her as getting the kind of treatment as Dan Quayle. And also you can feel sorry for him, but there was something about him that invited satire and humor. And there is something about her. She’s the same way.

Jenny: Who are some feminist heroines both historically and in modern times?

CHS: There are so many great women writers and feminists particularly. I want to urge every young lady to read about Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony. Too many young women forget that the rights we just take for granted women had to fight for, women had to take tremendous risks and hardship. There were hunger strikes, there was imprisonment, alienation from family, and every stressful thing that could happen, happened to women fighting to enjoy the simple freedoms that most men enjoy. Those are feminist foremothers. I love to read about them and write about them in books. Modern day, there are just so many women that I do like. I like Margaret Thatcher, Jeane Kirkpatrick, and Lynn Cheney.
