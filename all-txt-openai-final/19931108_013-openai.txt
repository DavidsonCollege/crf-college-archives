THE DAVIDSONIAN ARTS MONDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 1993

Blues Monday hosts Lil' Ed
By Rachel Newcomb

On Monday, November 1, Lil’ Ed and the Blues Imperials transformed the 900 Room into a packed Chicago blues joint.
With the help of their charismatic frontman, Lil’ Ed, the Blues Imperials treated the Davidson community to an evening of
the blues. This event was the third in a series of Intimate Performance Committee offerings.

Natives of Chicago, Lil’ Ed and the Blues Imperials have been playing in some form or another since 1975. At
the age of fifteen, Lil’ Ed Williams learned to play slide guitar, and with the help of his brother, bassist
James “Pookie” Young, created the Blues Imperials. They began playing gigs around Chicago and developed a reputation as an especially
hot act during the early 80s. In 1985, the Blues Imperials drew the attention of Alligator Records, who quickly signed
them after hearing them live. In 1986, they released their first album, “Roughhousin’,” which received critical acclaim from sources as
varied as New York’s Village Voice, The New York Times, and Spin Magazine. They followed this album with "Chicken, Gravy
& Biscuits" in 1989 and have recently released "What You See Is What You Get." Currently, the lineup includes second
guitarist Mike Garrett, drummer Kelly Littleton, tenor saxist Eddie McKinley, bassist James “Pookie” Young, and Lil’ Ed.

Monday’s well-attended show in the 900 Room featured Lil’ Ed and the Blues Imperials performing some of their own songs
for the Davidson audience. The band’s decidedly casual appearance and laid-back attitude contributed to the relaxed feel of the material.
Unlike some more traditional blues artists who sing mournful ballads that could have been written in the 1940s rather than
the 1990s, this band’s songs have a modern, more current edge to them. Most of the songs were upbeat, foot-stompin’
blues that were more conducive to dancing in the aisles than to crying into one’s beer.

Against the backbone of lyrics that dealt with the traditional themes of loneliness, love, and betrayal, Lil’ Ed and the
Blues Imperials fleshed out the words with their skillful musicianship. “My baby left me all alone/ She left me and
my guitar/ I’m a poor boy all alone,” Lil’ Ed wailed plaintively, but he delivered his lines with a huge
grin. Most of the music was happy and full of energy, perfectly punctuated by the fire that dripped from Lil’
Ed’s excellent slide guitar. It wasn’t until the seventh or eighth song that the band played a slow number. Many
numbers gave each of the band members a chance to shine, with solos by the bassist, drummer, and second guitarist.

Lil’ Ed and the Blues Imperials quickly succeeded in capturing the delight of the audience with their skillful, spirited blues.
One especially good song was “Chicken, Gravy, and Biscuits,” which included vocal help from the other band members. “I’ll eat
it all night long!” Lil’ Ed sang enthusiastically, ending the song with a little jump. During the last song of
the first set, Lil’ Ed performed a backbend while still playing his guitar. Falling to his knees, he leaned back
until he was no more than an inch from the ground. To the delight of the audience, he then jumped
up and smiled his toothy grin. The entire set had included only one slow number. Lil’ Ed and the Blues
Imperials served the Davidson crowd an entertaining slice of Chicago blues, demonstrating an evolved technique and a progressive style.

Lil' Ed and the Blues Imperials were a hit in the 900 Room.

Rodin scholar lectures in VAC
Expert continued from page 1
itself (the town’s besiegement and the people’s suffering). Moreover, the fact that the artist placed the subjects in a cube
was, “essential to how he dramatized it.” Elsen proved this theory by showing how the placement of the subjects communicates
a progression of thought and action. Elsen, in praising the genius of the Burghers of Calais, drew a unique comparison
between the initial reception of this work in 1889 and the response that occurred at the unveiling of the Vietnam
Memorial. According to the speaker, both treat their heroic subjects as a part of daily life. As a result, the
two works have “redefined courage in a modern way.” Davidson’s own Rodin sculpture of Jean D’Aire (one of the burghers)
is, according to Elsen, the penultimate study of what was to become the finished product. Commenting on this particular work,
Elsen stated that, “Rodin had never done a finer sculpture than that of the Jean D’Aire.” For those of you
who have not yet made it to the VAC, such accolades should provide incentive for you to view one of
the college’s greatest treasures.
