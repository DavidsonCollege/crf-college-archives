**Slater rumblings warn of annual eruption**

Director of ARA Food Services at Davidson College, Ron Scott, has suggested that he is unhappy with his business year.
The same thing happened last year. On March 31, 1975, Ron Scott admitted a revenue deficit for the year of
$10,000. He proposed the closing of Rusk House, an increase in meal ticket prices, and promised that next year would
be different. This year, Scott shows a profit of only two percent. The parent company ARA Slater expects Scott to
make five percent. Although this is not as great a problem as the deficit of last year was, Scott does
see it as grounds for more change.

Scott is still concerned about the costs of labor and supplies for three eating houses. Bailey is not doing well
and may see limited hours next year. A new meal plan may be implemented that does not allow students to
reclaim missed meals. These were Scott’s problems and solutions last year, too. His solutions didn’t work. They might not work
this time. Like last year, Scott expects to discuss his plans for next year’s changes with students and College Business
Manager Robert Currie. There are limits to where Scott’s need to make money can override his responsibility to provide an
adequate food service. If he oversteps these limits then ARA Slater does not deserve to be the college food service.

**Chancellor's epitaph: "You knew the job was dangerous when you took it"**

Warren Soule’s resignation from the position of SGA Senate Chancellor represents a natural attrition. He was a paid employee of
the Senate and had been hired by a different SGA president than he was working for. In his own words,
“It is a different Senate now than when I took office.” Under the new president, Soule was being asked to
be actively supportive of many of the Senate’s actions. In many cases, Soule, who describes himself as “a moss-backed conservative,”
did not want to support the doings of “a liberal Senate.” After making his complaints known to the SGA President,
Soule resigned rather than fail to fill his office.

The predicament Soule found himself in points up another requirement of the SGA Chancellor. Although not a senator, apparently the
chancellor must be willing to act in support of the Senate’s actions. Soule gave his own epitaph after his resignation—“You
knew the job was dangerous when you took it.” Perhaps the person who next takes the job will now be
advised of the elements of that danger.

Baskin chides SEC’s
By BO BASKIN

SGA Senate President Dr. George Abernethy fondly relates to his philosophy students what I call his ‘shoe-pinch analogy.’ With apologies
to Dr. Abernethy, it goes something like this: A college student is like a man with a new pair of
shoes. When a man buys a new pair of shoes, only he can tell where or whether his shoes pinch.
He and no one else—not even the keenest observer—can knowledgeably pinpoint where it hurts. Similarly, if a college policy fails
to meet a student’s needs, only that student can accurately say what he finds unsatisfactory. However, neither the man nor
the student is capable of ameliorating the pain of pinching shoes or unpleasant policy; such repair jobs remain for the
cobbler and the college faculty and administration.

Now I don’t quite buy the idea that only the faculty and administration are capable of improving policy; I maintain
(if I might be so bold) that students also have a role to play. But the purpose of this column
is not to debate whether students are capable of making decisions. The purpose is much simpler: right now, my shoes
are pinching and I’m writing to gripe about it.

Specifically, my gripes concern the 1976-77 academic calendar. First of all, according to that calendar, Fall classes will end on
Tuesday, November 16 with exams following Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. In effect, this means NO reading days before exams.
My second gripe is that after the Christmas holidays, classes will resume on Monday, January 3. In effect, this means
that those students who cannot get reservations on Sunday, January 2 or who must drive extremely long distances back to
Davidson on hazardous holiday roads will have to either leave home on or before New Year's Day or miss Monday
classes.

This academic calendar was selected by the Faculty Executive Committee about two months ago. Since then, both of these complaints
have been presented to that committee twice. Both times in the form of unanimous resolutions from the Student Senate; both
times by official student representatives of the SGA. Both times, the Faculty Executive Committee refused to alter its proposed calendar.

The most recent refusal came in the form of a letter from the secretary of the Executive Committee. The letter
stated that the committee was “not insensitive to the needs and desires of students regarding various features of the academic
calendar,” that indeed calendar changes have been “made during the last eight years (my emphasis) as a result of student
desires.” (For example, “graduation in May rather than June, longer vacations between terms, four-day examination periods, self-scheduled examinations, split Winter
term and reduction or elimination of Saturday classes”). For these changes, I am grateful. However, that changes have been made
over the past eight years does not alter the fact that students have twice shown their overwhelming disapproval of this
year’s calendar only to be denied by the Executive Committee.

In fairness to that committee, I would like to say that drawing up an academic calendar is not an easy
task. Many different needs and interests must be seriously considered. My complaint is that this year I’m afraid ours were
not.

Why they were not remains largely a mystery to me. Why they were not is not clear to me. Perhaps
the committee has some very compelling reasons for standing pat. Perhaps, like General Custer at the Battle of Little Big
Horn, they do not wish to reverse their own decision. Then, on the other hand, perhaps they don’t think you
care. If you do, sign the circulating petition and join the SGA Senate in presenting it to Dr. Spencer at
his home Tuesday, April 6. My shoes are pinching. Please, if yours are, say so.
