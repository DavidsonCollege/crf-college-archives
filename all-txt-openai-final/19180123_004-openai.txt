A letter from Jno. S. Moore, of Birmingham, Ala., A.B. ’15, written from the University Union, Paris, December 18, says: “I had just gone to sleep when a note came up from Mac. Rumple; he had seen my name on the register and came right up. He is second lieutenant, C. A., and has been to different schools since he came over; was passing through Paris on his way to another one. We have an idea he will end up by going home as instructor. He and I bummed around together in Paris until he left Saturday night, and managed to see a good deal of the well-known parts of it.”
