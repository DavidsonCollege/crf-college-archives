**Mumia talk was good for political life on campus**

By John Pitts  
Columnist

Author Dan Flynn’s recent appearance on the Davidson campus caused quite an uproar among groups of all affiliations and purposes. Flynn was invited to Davidson by a collection of conservative organizations on campus to expose the truth concerning the controversial trial and subsequent death row conviction of cop killer Mumia Abu Jamal. The event aimed to benefit all students regardless of political affiliation and exposure to the case. Some came to be educated concerning the facts and controversy surrounding Mumia’s trial and conviction. For them, the speech furthered Davidson’s political culture by providing educated fodder for debate and discussion.

Conversely, the diehard followers of the Davidson political scene came prepared for battle with copious research and heated arguments. Conservatives and liberals alike enjoyed the only forum for true inter-party debate since the Davidson presidential debates at Eu and Phi Halls. Mumia-acs and Mumia-haters alike should be commended for the quality of the content presented during the question and answer session. At other campuses around the country, Flynn had been physically accosted, his book burned, or the talk shouted down. Davidson students showed real class by respecting Flynn’s right to free speech.

Perhaps Dan Flynn’s greatest service to the campus was his intentional effort to offend and elicit reaction. Beginning with heated e-mail exchanges and culminating in a protest before the actual event, Davidson had not experienced such an outpouring of response to a single political event all year. Thankfully, the speech lived up to the hype. Flynn effused wit and sarcasm as he deftly discredited Mumia’s defense. His tone was caustic and his words penetrating. “Mumia-acs” were justly angered by Flynn’s presentation, but I argue that Flynn paid a great service to Davidson. In a campus where political debate and activism are often a silent pursuit, Flynn proved political fervor is merely dormant among the student body. It is about time someone jolted Davidson students to think critically about current events and then act upon their convictions. Truly, what are beliefs if they can so easily be discarded in the face of opposition? Socrates once said, “I will not yield to any man contrary to what is right, for fear of death, even if I should die at once for not yielding.” Thankfully, no student at Davidson risks death for his beliefs, but judging by the near silence on the campus concerning matters of political importance, one might wonder why Davidson students remain so quiet. Could the fear of rebuke by both staff and peers be the cause of this silence? Will professors of differing opinion change their perception of students who speak out? Will friends disappear once the going gets tough? Possibly, but what does one gain for yielding other than a compromised belief and a victory for those who oppose what is held so dear? Davidson: Relish the opportunity we have been given to disseminate our opinions and when so moved — speak up!

**Finding facts: Amnesty questions Flynn’s motives**

One of the advantages of living in a democratic society is the ability to participate in public debate and to inspire others to take part in positive action. Many campus groups sponsor activities and bring speakers to Davidson in order to foster this kind of environment.

The dynamic involved in this discourse becomes evident when we confront controversial topics. Often heated debates generate strong sentiments from both sides of the discussion, providing a way for concerned groups and individuals to harness these energies and put them to use. After a discussion as controversial as that inspired by Dan Flynn’s presentation Wednesday night, it is left to us, as members of the Davidson community, to direct the opinions espoused by students in a positive direction.

Dan Flynn’s discussion of the case of Mumia Abu-Jamal sparked an intense debate about the facts surrounding Daniel Faulkner’s murder and the guilt or innocence of Mumia. Mr. Flynn had obviously spent a great deal of time and energy researching this case to establish facts proving Mumia’s guilt. I would prefer not to use this space to reiterate the points made Wednesday night. Instead, I will refer you to a report published by Amnesty International on this specific case (www.amnestyusa.org/abolish/reports/mumia/), which involved the efforts of numerous individuals and found evidence contradicting much of what Mr. Flynn proposed. One certainty in this case is that we will never know all the facts surrounding the events that occurred nearly twenty years ago. Mr. Flynn argues that facts must take precedence over ideology in disputes of this kind. While this is certainly a valid statement, I must question the motives of those who are dedicated to proving Mumia’s guilt. When someone devotes such a large part of his existence to undermining the worth of another human being, it is likely that personal convictions, and not “facts”, were the driving force behind his efforts.motivation for embarking upon such a crusade. As Mr. Flynn himself stated, start with a theory and the facts will follow. While this may certainly be true of Mumia’s supporters, it is equally true of his opposition. Since the facts of this case are so muddled, let us then examine the underlying intentions involved in these two searches for “truth.” One approach, that of Mr. Flynn and his organization Accuracy in Academia (www.academia.org), searches for this truth without any obvious positive goal in sight. I fail to see the purpose of a career devoted to proving the guilt of a man already convicted and on death row or proving that AIDS is not an epidemic (as Flynn attempts to do in an article de-emphasizing the importance of AIDS education and research), unless Mr. Flynn is trying to tell us that there is something inherently wrong with standards of decency demanding that we consider all human beings worthy of respect, fairness, and shared community resources. In order to focus on immoral, this cause is yours. If you disagree with the imprisonment of individuals based on religious or political belief, if you consider discrimination on the basis of race, gender, or sexual orientation unacceptable, or if you ascribe to a spiritual tradition that promotes faith in the divine spark within every human being, you can be a human rights activist. The facts of Mumia Abu-Jamal’s case can be debated for years without any substantial outcome, but reality speaks for itself. Reality tells us that the justice system in this country is so severely flawed that it is nearly impossible for an African-American male to receive a fair trial. The death penalty itself is a lottery in which race and economic status matter more than the crime committed. Some have cited Mumia’s case as one that liberals have chosen to rally around in order to achieve their own ends. Why do people need a case to rally around? Is it not because of the very social conditions that incite us to action? And isn’t the end in sight, that of social justice and the promotion of human rights, an end that justifies many of the emotional reactions we see from Mumia’s supporters? It is difficult to see what end Mr. Flynn had in mind, unless it was to use the “facts” to hide the brutal realities of our society that call out to us, demanding action. State-sanctioned killing, police brutality, rape, torture, racism, sexism, homophobia... these things are real. Just ask the thousands of prisoners of conscience who have been freed due to Amnesty International’s letter writing campaign. Ask the 400 individuals in the United States who have been released from death row after being found innocent. Ask the female survivors of Bosnia and Kosovo who endured systematic rape and torture. Amnesty International is an organization concerned with confronting these realities and promoting the worth and dignity of all people. If you would like to do something positive to benefit fellow human beings, the Amnesty student group invites you to join us every Sunday evening at 8:00 in the Wilson Room.
