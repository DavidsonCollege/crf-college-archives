ALUMNI NOTES

The following letter has been received by the Alumni Editor. He would be glad to hear from other old Davidson men in the service.

435th Depot Detachment, Engineers, Camp Greene, Charlotte, N. C., February 7, 1918.

“The Davidsonian,” Davidson, N. C.

With reference to camp life, I am pleased to say that I have found it to agree with me to the fullest extent, and am enjoying very much being in the service of our dear “Uncle Sam.” We have a small detachment of only twenty-six men, the chief duty of which is handling engineering supplies. We spend a part of our time in drilling and are to have guns before long, so that we will at least not fall far behind the Davidson “Army.” I am very glad that I took advantage of the military training at Davidson and believe it is of a great deal of good to me in keeping up with the drilling here. There is one thing which I have learned about it, however, that we did not learn in our courses there, and that is how to get up in the morning to stand Reveille at 6:30 and go through our setting-up exercises by the moonlight. You can easily see that we have devoured all the hot-cakes, mush, and quinine (coffee) by the time the old chapel bell rings, a sound which we all didn’t like to hear.

The quarantine which has kept us out of Charlotte and the mud, have probably caused some of us to appreciate the Y. M. C. A. more than ever before. Though we do not have so much time off from our work, we feel the need of some place for a change, and the “Y” is that place. If you could only see the work that it is doing in the various buildings here, you would certainly be glad of having given your money to the Y. M. C. A. War Fund. The Charlotte people have been very good to us, especially through the churches, and to them we feel very grateful for such kindness as we have received at their hands. I was quite agreeably surprised to find Rev. Locke White preaching at the First Presbyterian Church, since the church has been without a pastor. It is quite good to get with an old Davidson man and talk over old times at the “Hill.”

I hope everybody there is meeting with success, and military training coming along the best possible. With all best wishes to every Davidson man, both in and out of college, I remain,

Loyally,  
Jas. T. Mappreey.
