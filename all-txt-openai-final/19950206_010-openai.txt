**The Follies of Higher Learning**

By JOHN COPPENHAVER
Arts & Living Editor

When I settled down in my seat to watch *Higher Learning*, all I knew about the movie was that it is set on a college campus and addresses some pressing issues dealing with campus life. What I did not know was that the movie would attempt to address every major issue imaginable concerning a college community. It may seem like a courageous thing for one movie to take on so many issues, but movies should not be about issues; movies should be about people. The problem with this movie is that the characters get lost in the issues. I am not saying that movies should not express opinions and emotions about different topics, but movies need to develop characters first and then deal with issues. *Higher Learning* develops the characters only after the issues are laid out.

The movie also tries to tackle too much. It addresses date rape, homosexual relationships, race relations, and other less prominent issues. It is impossible to do justice to any one of these problems by trying to cover them all in a two-hour time period. The first part of the movie involves a young white woman (Kristy Swanson) and her battle in dealing with date rape—a conflict which ultimately leads her to have feelings for another woman. Just as the audience is getting into this character, the movie’s focus switches to a black track star (Omar Epps) struggling to overcome the tension boiling between the black community and a group of violent neo-Nazis. When the racism explodes into violence, Omar Epps’ character has to deal with his own feelings of frustration and anger, which eventually lead him to violent behavior. This second plot line comes the closest to getting its point across and creating an interesting, well-rounded character.

Since the writer/director John Singleton spends all his time focusing on so many different ideas and issues, he does not give the characters time to develop. They end up just being stereotypical vehicles for getting a point across, instead of true characters that an audience can identify with and believe in. For Singleton’s idea (that people need to unlearn hate) to be effective, he needs to have characters that touch the viewers on an extremely human level—not just cookie-cutter people that the general public views as “typical.”

**Mystery Dinner Frightens and Shocks All**

By EMILY SIMMONS

To the sold-out crowd in the 900 Room, the Murder Mystery Dinner Theater on Saturday proved to be a barrage of insults and uncalled-for harassment. With a Chinese dinner accompanied by Valentine’s Day decorations and Ella Fitzgerald’s music in the background, the evening began on a high note. Little did the diners know what was to follow.

After dinner, as a sort of preview to what would continue in the play, one of the lead players, Scott Saperstein, accosted the audience with fortune cookies and insults. This was only the beginning of the abuse that audience members would receive throughout the first act. Charading as a mock murder mystery, the first act of *Murder Takes a Holiday* was actually no more than a continuous stream of insults aimed at various audience members, each of whom was unlucky enough to unwittingly attract the players’ attention. The spectators received verbal affronts, racial slurs, and manhandling, among other “fun stuff.” In addition, if an audience member would not laugh at a joke directed towards her or him, she or he was told to “go to hell.”

As the first act continued and the audience’s sense of humor dwindled, the evening seemed doomed to failure. At intermission, cheesecake was served, Pat clutches head in the audience. Brandon Clarke and the audience members had a chance to discuss what had just happened. No one could believe the type or number of insults thrown around like fortune cookies. In an attempt to escape the oppressive atmosphere, I went outside with friends to get some fresh air. After discussing the play for a few minutes, we were all afraid to go back inside for fear the second act would have already begun and we would become targets, albeit moving ones.

Once inside, I asked Morgan Perry, newly-elected Union Board President, how she felt about the evening. At that point, she was considering stopping the show. Instead, the actors were asked...To put an end to See Mess continued on page II

The popular music industry just doesn’t need any more “legends.” As far as MTV or Rolling Stone is concerned, anyone with a top-selling album, an expensive drug habit, and an untimely death qualifies. (If I hear Kurt Cobain compared to John Lennon one more time...) If you’re looking for a man worthy of the title, all you had to do was drop by Spirit Square in Charlotte on Thursday when Johnny Cash took the stage.

You won’t find a person (living or dead) who’s better qualified as a music legend than the so-called Man in Black. His list of accomplishments could fill this whole article. Cash had at least two singles on the country charts for over 30 years. He’s the only person to be inducted into the Country, Rock ’n’ Roll, and Songwriters Halls of Fame. In the course of a career spanning 40 years, he’s worked with everyone from Elvis to Bono, from Dylan to Danzig. His career had one of its many high points last year with the release of American Recordings, recently nominated for a Grammy. Hotshot producer Rick Rubin signed Cash to his record label and gave him free rein to do things his way. The result was 13 songs of pure Cash — there’s not a thing on the album except for acoustic guitar and one of the deepest, most distinctive voices in popular music. The critics went wild (yes, even Rolling Stone), and Cash’s music was introduced to yet another generation of fans.

The many generations that Cash has impacted were evident Thursday night. I’ve been to quite a few shows, but I’ve never seen an artist that draws a more varied crowd. There were at least as many Doc Martens as there were cowboy boots. I saw a few people in three-piece suits and a few people who could have passed for Hell’s Angels. There were whole families of fans at the show — grandparents, parents, and their kids.

Perhaps nowhere was the meeting of the generations more obvious than right on stage. Cash brought along his son, his wife, and her family (The Carter Family, country legends in their own right) to share the stage with him. The second show on Thursday also had a special guest that made everyone there look young in comparison: Doc Watson, one of the forefathers of folk and country music. Cash called him “one of my heroes” — high praise indeed — and gave him a seat off to the side of the stage, joking with him and flattering him throughout the show.

The focus of the evening, of course, was Johnny Cash himself, who came out in his traditional garb: black from head to toe. He came out to a standing ovation and tore right into the classic “Folsom Prison Blues.” The next two hours were nothing but hits, both from the past (“Ring of Fire,” “I Walk the Line”) and present (“Delia’s Gone,” “Drive On”). More than any of his contemporaries, Cash can belt out these songs with the same power and passion that he gave them at the beginning of his career. His characteristic singing/speaking vocal style has only gotten better with age. And the songs themselves, while hardly complex, hearken back to the sound of rock and roll’s earliest days.

It’s not hard to see why, after all these years, Cash is still on the road. His entourage is composed almost entirely of friends and relatives; even the people at the t-shirt stand had known him for years. Touring seems to be a way of life for the whole family, and they really look like they’re having fun with it. It’s incredible to me that such an icon of the music industry can still pull off such lively, enjoyable performances night after night. Very few groups — not the Stones, not even Dylan — come so close to preserving the original spirit and the quality of music which made them popular to begin with. And with two new albums slated for the near future — a solo album with Rubin and another Highwaymen album — Cash shows no signs of slowing down. Thursday’s show was not the first time he’s been to Charlotte. I’m betting it won’t be the last, either.

Cat Grimmell and Sara Beasley enjoy the performance of The Rob Kosick First Time before it went to competition on Thursday.
