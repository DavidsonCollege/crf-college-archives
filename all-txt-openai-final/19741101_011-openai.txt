### UNC-CH Conquers Wildcats In Rough Club Football Joust

**By BILL LLOYD

The Davidson College Club Football team continued its winless season last Saturday in a tough 14-8 loss to UNC-CH.

Approximately 35 bleary-eyed Wildcats dragged themselves up to the varsity practice field Saturday morning to be confronted by a polished
squad of about 50 uniformed Chapel Hill football players in the middle of their concentrated warm-up calisthenics.

Either as a result of this warm-up foolishness or because of a Friday night Homecoming party, several Davidson players were
seen regurgitating in the woods bordering the field.

After a 20-minute delay in order that a game ball, chains, and a chain crew might be procured, the contest
got underway with Chapel Hill kicking off.

As in the past, the Davidson offense was momentarily unable to generate a potent attack.

After a series of punts, fumbles, and interceptions, Chapel Hill scored on a well-thrown 35-yard pass late in the first
quarter. A perceptual breakdown in the usually alert Davidson secondary resulted in the score. The extra point made the score
7-0.

After a prolonged half-time, the Davidson offense began to move down the field directed by quarterback Carlyle Sherrill and aided
by running backs Bob Bishop, Tim Sellers, and Phil Oblinger.

Utilizing a play straight from the flickerball fields, Sherrill hit flanker Mark Firth on a “sleeper” pass to bring Davidson
to Chapel Hill’s 10-yard line. Three plays later Sherrill sneaked over for the touchdown.

The two-point conversion was good and for the second time in two years, Davidson was beating the Club Tarheels.

For the next 20 minutes, the Wildcats played tough defense led by Bob Olmstead and Buzz.

With 15 seconds left, Chapel Hill lined up for what was to be the last play of the game. A
40-yard bomb was thrown into the end zone and into the arms of a speeding Tarheel receiver.

Covering closely but not closely enough on the play for Davidson was number 28, identified by irate teammates only as
some short, curly-haired kid.

The beaten Davidson cornerback never broke stride and continued across the soccer field and into the showers. The extra point
for Chapel Hill was good.

So once again, the Davidson Club Football team snatched defeat from the jaws of victory by a 14-8 margin.

### Ruggers Drop Pair In Hardfought Scrums

Two weeks ago the Davidson Rugby Club traveled to Charlotte to play a match against that city’s club. Laden with
academia and upset stomachs, the Wildcats did not have a very large turnout. Technically the match was over before it
started as Davidson could not field the necessary men. However, the match got underway when several Charlotte ruggers volunteered to
perform on Davidson’s behalf.

The first half was well-played and highly defensive. Play moved up and down the field with both teams utilizing kicks
into touch to their advantage. Late in the half, however, Charlotte broke through Davidson’s defenses for two tries. Neither extra
kick was good and the halftime score was 8-0 in favor of Charlotte.

Davidson came out to play in the second half. The backs, running well, were able to keep pressure on Charlotte’s
defense while a pursuing scrum held their offense in check. The Wildcats finally scored near the middle of the half
when Bob Schermer got the ball out of the scrum and virtually ran through the entire Charlotte team for a
try. The kick was wide, but Davidson was back in the game at 8-4.

Charlotte came back to score another try and extra kick to make it 14-4. Davidson ruggers attempted to stage a
comeback but just couldn’t punch the ball across the try line. The final score for this match was 14-4, Charlotte.

Last Sunday the Hampden-Sydney ruggers traveled to Davidson for a match on Homecoming weekend. Attendance at the match was light
as ruggers had trouble responding to the scheduled time of 10 a.m. Finally, at about 11 a.m., a ball was
found and enough players had shown up to play a match.

The match was not well played by either side. At the end of the uneventful first half, the score was
Hampden-Sydney 3, Davidson 0.

The second half was marred by arguments and disputes with the official; both sides were glad when the game was
over and they could have a beer. The final score was 9-0, Hampden-Sydney. The parties for the Charlotte and Hampden-Sydney
games were non-competitive.

This week’s match against Tennessee is canceled. The next match is on Nov. 10 with Charleston at Davidson.
