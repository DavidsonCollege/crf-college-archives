**Cliched ending doesn’t mar enjoyable thriller Trapped**

**Bacon, Love, Theron all effective in kidnapping plot**

By CHARLES CUMMINS

Arriving in theatres on Friday, Kevin Bacon’s new suspense thriller opened with little publicity or attention by critics or audiences
alike. Labeled as a story of a kidnapping gone wrong, I approached the movie with low expectations and concluded that
at best, this film might be another that could be used in the next round of “Six Degrees of Kevin
Bacon.” However, Trapped eventually succeeds and delivers a good kidnapping caper, due in large part to the acting of Kevin
Bacon, Charlize Theron, and Courtney Love — yes, that Courtney Love.

In a quick yet effective prologue, the film establishes Joe (Kevin Bacon) as the evil kidnapper as we see the
climax of another kidnapping he has perpetrated. Even though we see the son and mother reunited, Bacon prevents us from
praising his good deeds, proclaiming, “I love bringing families closer together.”

After the opening title, the film jumps to six months ahead. At this point in time, we are introduced to
Dr. Will Jennings (played by Stuart Townsend), his beautiful wife Karen (Charlize Theron), and their seemingly normal daughter Abby (Dakota
Fanning). But as soon as Dr. Jennings departs for a conference trip, Joe moves in, kidnapping Abby from right in
the family’s luxurious home. Quickly, Joe begins to enact his well-laid-out plan with the intention of (supposedly) extorting $250,000 for
Abby’s return, a plan that we are told has worked four times before with four other children of rich parents.

While the story begins in a similar manner to other kidnapping films (i.e., Mel Gibson’s 1996 film Ransom), it is
Kevin Bacon’s performance as kidnapper Joe Hickey that helps the movie to succeed. While most villains in a similar position
are depicted as creating fear in the victim and the audience through fits of anger and rage, it is Kevin
Bacon’s quiet and calm acts that make him seem even more dangerous. It is only in the final climactic sequences
that Joe loses his composure.

It is a college phenomenon that the weekend unofficially begins on Thursday. There is so much anticipation for the fun
that begins on Friday, students decide to celebrate a little early. In fact, posters are put up an entire week
in advance promising a good time for the events to come. When you come right down to it, the whole
week revolves around the events of the weekend; it’s a wonder we students at Davidson ever get anything done at
all.

As a freshman, I find it difficult to balance the heavy workload with social activities. Managing my time well has
become a tough chore. Yet, I manage to do it because I would otherwise go insane without a little fun
every so often.

We got started Friday evening with a cookout on the back porch of one of the houses. There wasn’t a
huge crowd, but it seemed a lot more personal and friendly with fewer people. We got to meet a lot
of the house’s members, and there was a sort of “guest of honor” feeling to it. Sure, they may just
be trying to get us to join their frats, but I can’t help but buy into the whole friendly routine.

The rest of the night was remarkable in how uneventful it was. I noticed that there were a lot fewer
people at the parties than there were last weekend, but there were also no registered parties this weekend. My hallmates
and I hung around one house for a few hours before we got bored and went to the union.

Saturday started off looking like it would fall victim to the Davidson “Saturday curse,” but it soon picked up. After
floating around between sparsely attended house parties, we landed at the Union to see what the Lunar Luau was about,
only to find that it had been cancelled and that the Union had been overrun by a pack of manic
jugglers. We left the Union and drifted over to the senior apartments for the first party at that location since
I’ve been here that was actually worth going to. The word was that there was going to be a lot
of people at one house because the football players were getting back from their away game, so we stopped by
and sure enough, the place was rocking. I had more fun Saturday night than I’ve had on any night since
I came here, despite the initial lack of people at the houses and the absence of anything to do at
the Union.

Students from other campuses may be surprised to see Davidson students outside studying on a Saturday afternoon, or even sometimes
the occasional Friday. Although we are generally studious and dedicated academics, we get our work done in order to have
fun later on in the evening. We work hard during the week so we can reward ourselves later and so
our weekend can begin a little earlier. This past week, for example, was the Cast Iron Filter party on the
Court on Thursday. I did not attend, but I heard that it was a lot of fun. Then again, isn’t
that what college is all about? Isn’t it really about turning a difficult and stressful workweek into an excuse to
have fun? Forget Thursday. How does Wednesday sound?sound? - Contributing writers: Georgie Ahrendt, Rob Heidrich, Mary Kathryn Wyle. Like movies,

His cool and the movie loses its edge, falling into the clichéd action movie ending with car chases, explosions, and
stylized death scenes. In the supporting roles, Charlize Theron is quite convincing as Karen Jennings, wife and mother, forced to
comply with whatever Joe says with the promise that she will ultimately get Abby back. But as the situation gets
more desperate, Karen finally strikes back violently. As the tagline from the film claims, “It was the perfect plan until
she refused to be the perfect victim.” While I don’t want to give everything away as to how she fights
back, let's just say that under the knife, even the most dominating kidnapper can be put into submission. While Joe
fights to control Karen’s gutsy attacks, Joe’s wife Cheryl (Courtney Love) confines Dr. Jennings to his hotel room so as
to avoid any interference with the plan. In a well-crafted performance, Love is able to embody the feelings of a
weak, abused wife and mother who ultimately has no intention of allowing Abby to be hurt and will even protect
Abby from the rampaging Bacon. However, especially during the first sequences pitting Cheryl against Dr. Jennings, the domineering, “I don’t
care what you think” attitude of the real Courtney Love tries to break through on screen. The similarities of the
real Courtney, her personality, and her past, and the fictional Cheryl Hickey allow this rocker/actress to just be herself, and
the role is better because of it. Good casting job here.

Overall, the film succeeds in providing an enjoyable suspense thriller. Nothing original here; but enjoyable nonetheless, just to see who
will win in this battle of parents versus kidnappers. I only wish that the ending could not have fallen into
the typical shoot ’em up, car chase, explosive ending. I think in this case simpler would have been better. That
said, Trapped is an exciting ride, even if you’re only looking for another film title to use in the next
round of “Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon.” - Kevin Bacon menaces Charlize Theron in Trapped.

Johnson shines with haunting, versatile writing
By Wilson McBee
Staff Writer

Denis Johnson takes the title of this short story collection from the Lou Reed song, “Heroin,” and his writing is
similar to Reed’s music: subtle, haunting, and beautiful in a strikingly original way. Johnson, author of critically acclaimed novels and
books of poetry, packs an emotional punch in his terse, understated sentences that is unparalleled in today’s literature. The stories
in Jesus’ Son are culled from publications such as The New Yorker, Esquire, and the Paris Review, but all are
interrelated and narrated by Johnson’s alter-ego F.H., a rambling heroin addict lost in the undertow of the Midwest: its bus
stations, laundromats, motels, and bars.

What makes this writing so unique and fun to read is its versatility: Johnson has the coolness of Jack Kerouac
or Don DeLillo and the storytelling ability of William Faulkner or John Steinbeck. By the final paragraph of the first
story in the collection, “Car Crash While Hitchhiking,” Johnson has drawn you into his world of the drug-addicted and hopeless,
and he has introduced the heartbroken, unhurried voice of F.H., struggling to find something immutable and holy in the filthy
gutter of a world he inhabits. Johnson writes: “It was raining. Gigantic ferns leaned over us. The forest drifted down
a hill. And you, you ridiculous people, you expect me to save you.” Because of his superb manipulation of language,
Johnson dictates the rapid rollercoaster of emotions felt in each story. With each new sentence, Johnson decides whether to make
you laugh, cry, or grimace. Though always told in F.H.’s distinct voice, the stories in Jesus’ Son differ enough in
scope and content so that each story is fresh and unexpected.

“Out On Bail” is primarily a flashback, in which Johnson introduces the lonely hipsters and drug addicts that frequent the
Vine, a neighborhood bar. In the short, violent tale, “Dundun,” F.H. hopes to buy pharmaceutical opium from a man named
Dundun but instead stumbles upon the scene of a peculiar crime. “McInnes isn’t feeling too good today,” Dundun tells F.H.,
“I just shot him.” “Is he really dead?” F.H., a little shaken, asks, and Dundun answers, “No. He’s sitting down.”
In “Emergency,” anthologized in The Best American Short Stories of 1992, F.H. and his Emergency Room co-worker Georgie, buzzed by
mouthfuls of stolen pills, cavort through a snowy September night, and are amazed and overjoyed at everything they experience. That
story ends with another classic Johnson poem/paragraph: “That world! These days it’s all been erased and they’ve rolled it up
like a scroll and put it away somewhere. Yes, I can touch it with my fingers. But where is it?”

One of the great things about reading Denis Johnson, similar to reading Jack Kerouac or listening to Muddy Waters, is
that he lived hard so you wouldn’t have to. Read Jesus’ Son, and you’ll get a taste of America’s darker
side, and possibly a little of the street wisdom usually gained from years of abusing drugs and living life on
the edge.
