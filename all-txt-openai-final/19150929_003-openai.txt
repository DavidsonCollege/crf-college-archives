DAVIDSON COLLEGE DAY
213 North Tryon Street
CHARLOTTE, N.C.

Davidson College Day will be observed this year on October 28, the last Thursday in the month. As was the case last year, recitations will be suspended at 11 o'clock. The college has been very fortunate in securing as speaker for this occasion Dr. W. S. Currell, president of the University of South Carolina. He was for several years Professor of English at Davidson, and was until last fall a member of the faculty of Washington and Lee, at which time he was elected to his present position. He received the degree of LL.D. from Davidson in 1917. Dr. Currell has gained considerable prominence throughout the country as a platform speaker, and while he has not yet announced his subject, his address will without a doubt be pleasing and entertaining to all who will have the privilege of hearing him.

Special attention shown to Davidson men.

According to a statement printed in a recent issue of the Charlotte Observer, Mr. C. E. Robins, of that city, is planning to run a so-called “Jitney” line between Charlotte and Statesville. This line will necessarily pass through Davidson. Although the exact cost of the fare between these points has not yet been definitely ascertained, it is known that it will be considerably cheaper than the present fare by rail.
