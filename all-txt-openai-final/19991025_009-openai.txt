THE DAVIDSONIAN Press RELEASE

F. Kim Hodgson, general manager of WAMU radio in Washington, D.C., and chairman of the board of National Public Radio
(NPR), has been appointed station manager of WDAV, Classical 89.9 radio, in Davidson. WAMU is Washington’s major public radio outlet
for news, talk, and traditional American music programming. Hodgson will succeed John Clark, who retired as WDAV's station manager on
June 30 following 17 years in that position.

Arts & LIVING
NPR Board Chair will lead Davidson’s WDAV Radio

Hodgson will begin work in Davidson on November 1 with intentions of expanding the station’s commitment to promote all fine
arts in the region. Jamie May, vice president for college relations at Davidson, said the college will benefit greatly from
Hodgson’s decision to accept the position. “Listeners in this area appreciate the high quality of programming on WDAV, and Kim
Hodgson’s knowledge of public radio on a national level will help us improve that service,” he said.

A New Perspective

Hodgson was elected to the NPR board in 1994, and its members selected him as their chair in November 1996.
That position has immersed him in strategic thinking about the industry and helped him develop relationships with public broadcasting leaders
nationwide. Hodgson has one year of board membership remaining and says that WDAV will add a new perspective to his
board service. “It is very important that stations like WDAV be at the table in organizations where the future of
public radio is being plotted,” he said. “Believe me, stations in major markets like New York, San Francisco, and Washington
don’t have all the answers!”

Hodgson described WDAV as “a jewel among public radio stations.” He praised its professional staff, integrity of programming, and its
commitment to promote and support all forms of fine arts in the area. Revolutionary technological innovations are making that commitment
even more important, Hodgson said. “The challenge to classical radio is to avoid replacement by satellite broadcasting. The key question
for stations like WDAV is how to remain relevant to the community in which they operate so that people won’t
opt to get their music from a national satellite service. WDAV has to offer its listeners something that compels them
to listen every day, while remaining true to its fine arts mission.”

A Reputation of Excellence

He said the station’s excellent reputation in the public radio world and its mission to serve the arts community attracted
him to the position. In addition, he and his wife, Judy, look forward to living in the close-knit community of
Davidson and relocating closer to Hodgson’s parents in Atlanta. Hodgson has worked in non-commercial radio since 1966, beginning as a
producer of educational programs for the University of Chicago. He was program director for the nation’s first Native American owned
radio station, KTDB in Ramah, N.M., and managed stations for Minnesota Public Radio, the University of Washington, and WETA in
Washington before joining WAMU. During his tenure at WAMU, the station budget grew from $1 million to $6 million, the
number of supporting members grew from 10,000 to 35,000, the full-time professional staff more than doubled to 43 people, and
the station built a new 10,000-square-foot broadcast building. WAMU now attracts more than 450,000 listeners weekly, and produces more than
15 hours of programming weekly for distribution to National Public Radio member stations around the country.

An Evolving Score

WDAV began programming as a public service of the Trustees of Davidson College in 1978. Under John Clark’s direction since
1981, it grew from a 20,000-watt station whose signal...barely reached northern Charlotte to a 100,000-watt broadcast service that reaches a
22-county area of the Carolinas. In addition to airing classical music 24 hours a day, Classical 89.9 promotes cultural arts
events throughout the region on the air and on its website, in the monthly programming magazine, through co-sponsorship of events,
and with the creation of new events like the Music Listening Contest for young music lovers. The ultimate expression of
this philosophy occurred during the station’s 20th anniversary celebration last year. The station commissioned a composition, “Voice of the Wood,”
from North Carolina composer Russell Peck. The Charlotte Symphony performed the world premiere, which was broadcast live locally by WDAV
and syndicated nationally.

Hodgson holds a master of arts degree in speech-radio/TV/film from the University of Wisconsin and a bachelor’s degree in drama
from Antioch College. When he is not working, he enjoys reading, long walks, and listening to a wide variety of
music. He believes that, ideally, every day should begin with a bit of Bach. He and Judy have four grown
children.
