THE DAVIDSONIAN ARTS MONDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1993

A legend makes his way to stardom

Ducas continued from page 11

By the end of the summer, I knew every word on the tape and could even play a few tunes
myself. The summer, however, ended, and Caleb returned to Vanderbilt—with his tape. It took me nearly four months, but I
finally found someone to drive me to Nashville. At about 10:30 last Friday night, a few friends and I walked
into Amie’s, sat down, and put our feet up. I’m not sure what I expected, but what I found in
that tiny bar seemed to match those expectations exactly.

I found George Ducas, clad in denim and boots, strumming a black Takamine cutaway. He was standing—I remember that struck
me as peculiar. But, there he was standing, strumming, and singing to a half-inebriated and half-captivated audience. As far as
I could tell, those that weren’t listening were either drinking or telling the people next to them how great he
was. After the applause died down, I shouted “Since you left town” and without hesitation, George said: “by request” and
smiled.

He played mostly originals, but strayed into a little Jerry Jeff, Grateful Dead, and quite a bit of Dwight Yoakam.
The crowd, predominately college kids and regulars, knew all the words. “I need to do one for Caleb,” George said
and drifted back into his music with “Without you,” another original. He knew most everybody by name, and they knew
him. After he finished a set, George came down off the stage and laughed and drank with the rest of
us. Apparently, a friend of mine had told him who I was and where I came from. He came over,
introduced himself, and asked me to stick around after the show. I think I was caught off guard by his
friendliness.

After a while, he got back up on stage for another set. Sally Smithwick, another singer trying to make her
own luck in Nashville, was there with her boyfriend, and below the barrage of requests, she asked for “Blue Eyes
Cryin’ in the Rain.” Whether he loved the song or she just smiled and melted his heart, I couldn’t tell.
He played it so well, even Willie himself would have cried. Scott Lenhart, her boyfriend and my traveling companion, leaned
over to me and voiced his concern. “I don’t blame you,” was all I said, and laughed. I knew George
was engaged, but decided to let Scott boil for a little while.

He played on for a couple more sets. “This is the first song I ever wrote [he was twelve], I
won’t be playing it on tour next year.” We all felt a little honored. It was “Women and Whiskey,” and
I wondered about what kind of kid this guy must have been. He played an old Foster and Lloyd tune,
a few other originals, and finally closed, around two, with a rendition of “Dueling Banjos” that left us speechless. He
put down his guitar, climbed off the stage, and sat down with us. Honestly, I think I asked only one
question. After that, Sally and Caleb bombarded him, and I did little but write.

He hails from Texas City, Texas, and was raised in California and Houston before making his way to Nashville. He
graduated from Vanderbilt in ‘89 intent on becoming a businessman, but after a year working in a bank, he realized
his future lay elsewhere. Though he started playing when he was twelve, the music industry was something he had never
thought about, and kind of “stumbled into this situation” when a friend asked him to play in Calhoun’s, a bar
down the road. A little later he found his way into Amie’s. That was three and a half years ago.

As to his future, George is humbly reserved. He recently signed with Liberty Records (Garth Brooks’ label) and his single
is due for release in September. He plans to start touring and hopefully open for some bigger artists. Despite hisFriendship
with Radney Foster, George has no plans to accompany him on tour. He doesn’t want to “ride in on the
coattails” of anyone else. No matter what happens, he plans on maintaining the integrity he’s kept thus far. When asked
about his imminent stardom, George was pensive. “The closer I get to it, the more different it becomes... It becomes
real life.” I have no doubt you’ll be hearing George on the radio before too long. I kind of regret
it, though. I’ve only got a few months to make it to Nashville to see him play before he rounds
up a band and hits the road. If you’re heading that way and need a driving partner, let me know
(I’m serious). If we can make it there by eleven or so on a Friday night, I’m game.

Before we left Amie’s in the wee hours of Saturday morning, I asked George for his autograph. He laughed (it
was something he wasn’t used to), and took my pen and pad.

- Best of luck, Geoff! Thanks for my first interview ever!
George Ducas

Thanks for my first interview, George, and I’d wish you the best of luck, but I don’t think you’ll need
it. Merry Christmas, everyone, and have a happy holiday! Special thanks to Caleb Clarke for making this interview possible. Also
thanks to Scott Lenhart, without whom this interview would never have happened.
