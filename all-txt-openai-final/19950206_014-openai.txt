After manhandling Marshall two weekends ago, the men’s basketball team appeared ready to emerge as the class of the Southern Conference, but last week’s results provided little indication of any such thing happening soon. The Wildcats experienced the Statesboro Blues in a 59-52 loss Monday at Georgia Southern before suffering a heartbreaking 69-68 home loss Saturday to Western Carolina.

Davidson (11-8, 4-3) will now hope to return to winning form on Tuesday when they face the defending conference champions, UT-Chattanooga in Belk Arena at 7:00 p.m. (SportSouth).

Saturday, the Catamounts came up with a buzzer-beating three-pointer to escape with the victory. Anquell McCollum, who finished the game just 4-of-17 from the floor, drained a three-pointer with just eight seconds left. The Wildcats came back down the floor and had an opportunity to steal a last-second win, but a late shot bounced away.

Both that loss and Monday’s defeat at Georgia Southern came at the hands of teams the Wildcats swept last season. Georgia Southern traditionally plays well at home, and last year, the Wildcats needed a career-high 25 points along with a buzzer-beating three-pointer from guard Chris Alpert to pull off the victory.

Saturday’s excitement was in contrast to Monday’s game, when Davidson had just one player reach double figures and shot only 38% from the floor. The Eagles led for almost the entirety of the contest, but the Wildcats stayed close.

Despite the recent cold weather, the Davidson baseball team has been practicing every day in preparation for Saturday’s season opener at home against Campbell. The cold weather actually is helpful in a way as the first few conference series are in the mountains — at Appalachian State and Western Carolina, where the weather is a factor early in the season. The players have been working hard, and the expectations are high for the Wildcats this season.

The team has a new look this year, but the Wildcats look like they could improve on last year’s record of 21-31. In previous years, the team has relied on the big hits to produce much of the offense, but this year the team will likely have to manufacture their runs rather than wait for the long ball. “In the past we have been a real power team, but this year our strength lies in our pitching and defense,” says captain Mark Reilly. The team has a lot more speed this year, and fans should expect more hit-and-run plays and more aggressive baserunning from this squad.

Gus Quattlebaum and Brad Edwards will be in the middle of the lineup and both look to continue their hitting success of last season, when they hit .296 and .294, respectively. One of the biggest challenges for the Wildcats will be replacing the dynamite foursome of Clay Hall, Jazz Freitas, Brett Boretti, and Mac Chapman. The group combined to hit 28 of the team’s 47 home runs last season and picked up 81 of the 181 RBI. Freitas was the base-stealer of the bunch, swiping 21 bases to go along with his .364 batting average. Hall led the squad at .371, Chapman hit .337, and Boretti came in at .326.

The infield looks to be very strong. Edwards, Reilly, Quattlebaum, and Jeff Andrews all played most of last season together and work well.Together. “The infield is set from last year, but there are a bunch of spaces to fill in the outfield,” adds Reilly. Several younger players are trying to learn new positions and fit into the lineup as outfielders. Andrews is the leading hitter returning from last season, when he hit .321 with three home runs and 11 RBI. The strongest part of this team is the pitching staff. Several pitchers should see action this year, and the rotation will probably be led by juniors Andrews, Chris Pollard, Rhett Ingerick, and Brian Cole. Sophomores Jon Coulombe and Mordecai Stolk will definitely contribute as well. “The deep pitching staff is the strongest part of our team and that will help us out around tournament time,” says Reilly. At the Southern Conference tournament at the end of the year, the team will play several games in just a few days, and a deep staff is necessary for success.

The team also has some new faces who look to contribute as freshmen. Mike DeSimone, Hamilton Hill, Dom Talvacchio, and Ryan Conaster are all former high school standouts who are hungry for playing time. Hill, Talvacchio, and Conaster are all bidding for a backup catcher position. They are fighting behind Pat Barrett and Drew Van Culin, who lead the drive for the starting spot which Boretti left open when he graduated.

The schedule is packed full of ACC teams who provide great competition for the Wildcats, and fans should be on the lookout for some big upsets by this team. Baseball America picked Davidson to finish seventh in the Southern Conference, but that prediction is without merit. There is great potential for the team, and if the offense comes around, the team will be a force in the conference. Saturday, the Wildcats will be going for the first of hopefully many wins this season.

Brandon Williams (18 points) cut the margin to 48-47 on a dunk that would turn out to be a costly effort. Williams received a technical foul for hanging on the rim, and the Wildcats would never get closer. Georgia Southern went on to outscore Davidson 11-4 to capture their second conference win of the season. The loss added to the team’s woes as the season road record fell to 1-6. The Wildcats hoped to find confidence when they returned to Belk Arena last Saturday, a place that had provided 21 victories out of the past 23 contests.

The Catamounts featured the conference’s premier performer in Frankie King, last year’s conference player of the year. King entered the game with a league-leading 27.2 points-per-game scoring average along with a fourth-best 8.2 rebounding average. He is the most decorated player in the conference since the dominating stint of Keith “Mister” Jennings at ETSU. Davidson swept the Catamounts last season, including a victory in the semifinals in the conference tournament. King showed why he is considered the best as he led the Catamounts to a 39-32 halftime lead with 18 points on 7-of-9 shooting from the floor. Davidson continued to shoot poorly from the floor with a percentage barely over 40%. Junior Chris Alpert kept the Wildcats close with 8 points and 3 rebounds in the first half. Alpert would also go on to dish out five assists to move him into third place on the career assist list at Davidson. The second half would provide more drama as both teams came out with a faster tempo. Western Carolina created turnovers.
