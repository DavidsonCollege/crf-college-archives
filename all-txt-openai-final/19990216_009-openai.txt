Students have what it takes to fight fires

It was midday, and the Davidson Fire Department was dispatched because an alarm had gone off at a screw factory. Fire Chief Wilson Sadler put on his gear, opened the firehouse doors, and drove a ladder truck out into the driveway. There he waited for other members to arrive. The wail of the fire siren could be heard. Within two minutes, other members arrived. These members prepared the first truck, but just as the team was ready, the call was canceled.

Davidson Fire Department has 14 members, eight of whom are Davidson students. These students joined the department under a special program that allows for training and service as a firefighter. Davidson students Fitzgerald, David Farnum, Gregory Filak, Joshua Glazer, Jesse Montgomery, and Adam Walk are part of this team.

After the siren begins, each member has a pager that buzzes for several seconds and then gives a broadcast message from the 911 Dispatch Center as to the location of the emergency. Members go either to the Fire Station beneath the Davidson Town Hall or drive directly to the fire. Members are never on or off duty. When a call is received by the 911 Dispatch Center, all members of the department are alerted. Members respond as best they can; however, no member must respond to any call. Thus, the department does not require any Davidson student to leave a lecture in order to respond. Nevertheless, calls bring on average four members to the firehouse to ride out on the first truck.

When the siren begins sounding, a member has two minutes in which to reach the firehouse and prepare the trucks. If they miss the first truck, they then have two options. They can drive independently or wait at the firehouse while the second crew is gathering to take the second truck. When asked if flying through red lights and stop signs made him nervous, Chief Sadler stressed that fire trucks can only go through a red light if the speed is reduced to 35 mph and the intersection is clear. On the interstate, the speed is increased to 55 mph. The reason for such slow speeds is that fire trucks roll over as easily as other trucks. Safety is a primary concern of the fire department members.

Going to a fire is not as glamorous as Hollywood suggests in films such as Backdraft. Davidson fire trucks go only 35 mph when not on the interstate. On the interstate, the speed is increased to 55 mph. The reason for such slow speeds is that fire trucks roll over as easily as other trucks. Safety is a primary concern of the fire department members.

Beyond the fire trucks and department protocols are people: the firefighters. In the little town of Davidson, North Carolina, men like Chief Sadler and the student firefighters should be respected for their integral contributions to the community.Ringling Bros. & Barnum and Bailey Circus comes to feet in height stands in startling contrast to 33-inch-tall Michu, The Smallest Man on Earth. In Russia, they were confounded by contortionist Marina, The Lady in the Cube. Tong, The Prince of Pythons, from Vietnam, mesmerized them with his 16-foot slithering serpents. Also among this assemblage of the strange and spectacular were fire-breathing Vesuvius, The Human Volcano; Mysticlese, The Master of the Mind, a human enigma who journeys beyond the limits of pain; and Nikolai, The Iron Jaw, a marvel fighters and those who rely upon them. In order to help safeguard the lives of Davidson’s populace, the firefighters themselves must be safe: Fire-fighting may not always be filled with glory and glamour.
