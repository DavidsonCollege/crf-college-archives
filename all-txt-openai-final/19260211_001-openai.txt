**J. Stitt Wilson Starts New Religious Thought In Series of Lectures.**

Noted Sociologist Inaugurates Revival of Religious Thought Among Davidson Students

**SPEAKS FIVE TIMES**

Christianity Acquires New Meaning Under Masterful Treatment

The Hon. J. Stitt Wilson, former mayor of Berkeley, California, came to Davidson last Saturday morning for a series of
five lectures. These lectures dealt largely with the social aspect of the Christian life. Mr. Wilson is a layman and
an exceedingly forceful speaker. He was deeply appreciated at Davidson and gave Davidson men new lines of thought. Few, if
any, of the students had ever before realized the full significance of the Christian’s social attitude.

At the Y. M. C. A. vesper service on Sunday evening, in the last of a series of lectures before
the students, Hon. J. Stitt Wilson, of Berkeley, Cal., gave three of his seven suggestions on the technique of spiritual
life. The Technique of Spiritual Life was the subject of his talk and the three suggestions as he stated are
(1) Pivotal Promise; (2) Prayer, and (3) Devotion to Humanity.

In his introductory remarks Mr. Wilson said, “All civilization is technique. Character is technique.” Technique is essential to the playing
of any athletic game and the technique of study is necessary for the efficient acquisition of knowledge. One of the
greatest troubles with colleges is that the professors do not tell their students how to study, he said. It is
one of the things the Protestant churches are short on. They say, “Come to Jesus,” but do not say how.
It is baffling to try to describe spiritual experiences or to define God but there are a few explicit, concrete,
practical and helpful suggestions on how to develop spiritual life. The first of these the speaker stated as Pivotal Promise.

**Davidson Songsters Win Ovation at Big Concert**

Glee Club Loudly Encored in Initial Performance in Shearer Hall

Making a hit in its first and only performance before a home audience, the Davidson College Glee Club played before
a crowded house last Friday evening in Shearer Hall. The entire program was highly enjoyable, being especially suitable for hearers
composed almost entirely of college men. Probably the biggest hit of the night was the appearance of the jazz orchestra.
This group of musicians was greeted with resounding applause on both occasions that it appeared. The orchestrations played were new,
airy, and catchy, showing plainly that Davidson has a real group of syncopators.

Although the numbers given by the club as a whole received much applause and praise, the three songs sung by
J. H. Caligan no doubt were one of the high spots of the performance. Caligan, after having given two classical
pieces, in responding to an encore, sang “The White Water Lily,” a composition for which he wrote both the music
and the lyric. The accompaniment for all these was played by P. B. Fry.

The opening number on the program was “College Ties,” sung by the entire club. The songsters showed plainly the careful
training and instruction that they had received under the direction of the club officers and Mrs. Gerald Baker, of Charlotte,
who has assisted in the direction of these men this year.

**JUNIOR SPEAKING PROGRAM**

Below is published the complete program of Junior Speaking, as tentatively announced by the special committee in charge of arrangements:

April 1—V. P. I.-Davidson track meet. Dramatic and Glee Club performances.

April 2—Davidson-W. & L. tennis match. Davidson-Lenoir Rhyne baseball game. Junior Oratoricals.

April 3—Honorary Fraternity Competitive Initiations. Freshman baseball game. Special dinner for Juniors and guests. Entertainment in gymnasium.

April 4—Special church services, with Junior choir. Open-air Vespers, led by Queens College delegation.

April 5—Davidson-Carolina game at Salisbury. Davidson-Pittsburgh Debate.

Have you invited your girl? If not, do so at once—he who hesitates is lost—she might come up as the
guest of some other fellow. Get the spirit!

**Enthusiasm Mounts With Announcement of Program For Junior Festivities**

Y. M. C. A. Will Offer its Reception Room for Entertainment of Girls

With the announcement by the Y. M. C. A. that a room is being prepared in the Philanthropic Literary Society
hall to be used by the students in entertaining their girls, plans for Junior Speaking are considered practically complete.

The various committees in charge of that event report that everything is being done to make the affair one of
the most enjoyable and successful in the history of the college. Special committees under Bill Christian and Harry Goodykoontz are
working up interest among the boys and persuading them to not only remain for the fun but to be sure
and have a girl down.

A meeting of the Junior Class was held Monday and at a vote taken it was found that a large
majority of the class was sure of staying and this means the spirit of co-operation is in the class and
success is assured. The program is complete in every detail. Starting off Thursday with a track meet with V. P.
I. and Glee Club and Dramatic Club performances, there is hardly an hour left without some kind of entertainment taking
place. On Friday there is a tennis match with W. & L., a baseball game, and ending up with the
Junior Oratorical contests. There will be seven of the best orators in the Junior Class competing, and this part of
the program is being especially stressed.

Saturday is the big day. A unique entertainment is being arranged between the various honorary fraternities in the shape of
competitive initiations. Saturday night an entertainment royal will be given. The gym will be fittingly decorated and fitted up for
one of the most resplendent and novel entertainments that has ever been attempted here before. The Junior Class is holding
the facts about the nature of this event secret and a real surprise is in store for the guests.

Sunday, special services will be held at the church. That afternoon an open-air vesper service will be given with girls
from Queens and Juniors officiating. Another fact that was overlooked was that special music will be given at church by
members of the Junior Class. Monday there will be another baseball game.

**TO CONDUCT SPECIAL SERVICES**

Dr. Dunbar H. Ogden, widely known Presbyterian minister, who has been selected by the Y. M. C. A. to conduct
the special student revival services, which are to be held here during February.

**Basketball Team To Make Tour of Old North State**

The Wildcat basketball team will make its first extended trip on February 15th, playing many of the leading teams of
North and South on this tour. Manager Garrison arranged...A very complete schedule, the first group of teams to be met
being throughout South Carolina, returning to Davidson for a day and then leaving on a trip through North Carolina. Coach
Monk Younger has not definitely decided yet which of the varsity squad he will take on the trips nor how
many. The first game of the road trip will be with Clemson. The Tigers will be played at Clemson on
the night of the 15th. From there the Wildcats will go to Greenville, where they will play Furman on the
following night, the 16th of February. From Greenville, the Wildcats will journey to Spartanburg, where Wofford will attempt to obtain
revenge for the defeat from Davidson earlier in the season. After the South Carolina trip, the squad will return to
Davidson for a day of rest before continuing their travels. A game with N. C. State College has been scheduled
for the night of February 20th, at Raleigh, and the Wildcat quintet will go there for the next game. They
will also spend Sunday at N. C. State, and from there they will travel to Durham, where a game is
scheduled with Duke on Monday night, February 22nd. The final game of the trip will be played at Chapel Hill,
where Davidson will meet the Southern Intercollegiate champions, University of North Carolina. The other two games remaining on the schedule
will be played at Davidson. Furman will be played in the alumni gymnasium on the night of the thirteenth. The
season will be formally ended when Citadel is met here February 27th.

Under the direction of T. C. Barr, the concert orchestra rendered three classical pieces. The orchestra, although playing in excellent
form, missed the presence of J. S. (Continued on page 7) (Continued on page 7)

Special Services to Begin on February 21st

INTEREST IS KEEN

Dr. Ogden Holds Honorary Degrees From Davidson College and Southwestern University

The regular spring services sponsored by the Y. M. C. A. will be held beginning February 21st and continuing through
February 24th. These services will be conducted by Dr. Dunbar H. Ogden, pastor of the Government Street Presbyterian Church of
Mobile, Ala. This series of meetings will be in the nature of a life work conference and promise to be
of great benefit to the members of the student body, especially those who have not decided upon their life work.

Dr. Ogden received both his college and seminary training at Southwestern University. He has held important pastorates in Knoxville, Atlanta,
Louisville, and Mobile. He is very prominent in the college and university circles of the South, having spoken in some
60 Southern colleges. He has always been identified with young people’s and student’s work and has achieved marked success in
these lines as well as in the pastorate. He was honored by Davidson some time ago with the degree of
Doctor of Divinity and has visited the college on various occasions. His coming to conduct the spring services is looked
forward to with keen interest. During his stay at Davidson he will preach at the Sunday morning church service and
also at the “Y” vespers on that day. During the week he will speak each morning at chapel and again
after supper each night. The day will be given over to interviews when all men have an opportunity to talk
their problems over with him.

Dr. Henderson Irwin, '06, of Eureka, N. C., was recently married to Eloise Farrior, Rev. W. O. Cone performing the
service.

Guilford Quintet Bows As Wildcats Open Fast Attack in First Period

Guilford Starts Off Slowly But Shows Good Form in Second Half

ANDERSON IS STAR

Laird and Anderson Show Unusual Ability to Locate Basket

The Wildcats continued their rather pretentious season so far this year on the cage court by defeating the Guilford College
Quakers here Saturday night in a snappy, well-played, and entertaining game of basketball, the score being at the conclusion, 34
to 23. With Anderson leading the offensive attack, the Wildcats forged ahead of the Quakers in the initial minutes of
play. The score was first knotted, 2-2, but with a field goal and a foul shot, Anderson made it 5-3
for the Wildcats. For the next few minutes, the local team had easy going and had increased the score to
13-3 before the Quakers hit the loop for a field goal counter. But it was the Wildcats’ advantage all through
the first period, the score at the end of half time being 21 to 9.

Not content with their display of basketball art, the Quakers began the second period with a spirit characteristic of the
Wildcat fight and made a rapid attack that necessitated a time out by Captain Laird to solve the situation. The
Quakers lessened the margin, and early in the second stage, the score was 23-16. From that time on, however, the
red jersey men opened up, with interspersed shots by the Guilford cagesters. The boys from near Greensboro had the closing
side of the argument, looping two field goals after the Wildcats’ scoring for the night had ended.

Accurate shooting by Anderson, with expert backing up by Captain Laird, worked a good combination that accounted for a total
of 29 of the 34 Davidson points. Anderson (Continued on page 8)

Wildcats To Face Great Dartmouth Nine in March

Davidson to Play Seventeen Games With Best South-Atlantic Teams

Manager W. T. (Bill) Spencer announced the baseball schedule for the Davidson varsity team Monday night with 12 games scheduled
for the Wildcats between March 26th and May 8th. Opening the season as usual with two games with the Oak
Ridge Cadets, the Davidson team will swing into action early when it meets Dartmouth College on the 30th of March
on Richardson Field. The engagement of Dartmouth on its annual Southern tour brings to Davidson one of the greatest football
players in the history of the gridiron game in the person of Oberlander, the famous quarter of the New Hampshire
eleven. Oberlander is one of the mainstays of the Dartmouth pitching staff, and Manager Spencer reports that every endeavor will
be made to have him pitch while at Davidson.

Coach Younger announced that probably he would have his pitching staff out for early practice next week under “Dutch” Hengeveld,
former Davidson player and coach. The schedule includes games with all of the “big five” of North Carolina with the
exception of Wake Forest, the team in addition meeting Washington and Lee, Virginia Military Academy, and Roanoke College on a
tour of Virginia, which begins on April 27th at Guilford College. This is the second trip on the Davidson schedule,
the team meeting Furman University (Continued on page 3)
