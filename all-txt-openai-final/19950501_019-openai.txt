Davidson crew:
team on the
rising tide

By Rich Glenn
Sports Writer

While many of us are sleeping
away our early mornings, the most
unrecognized Davidson team is
working hard to build a competi-
tive program.

CREW

It might be a shock for many
people to hear that Davidson has
its own crew program, but, in fact,
it is a highly motivated 20-mem-
ber team.

Twice a week, the team heads
out to the lake campus for crew
practice. In charge of the team are
two sophomores: Josh Peklo and
Jay Hinton.

Both joined the crew program
last year but found it unorganized
and lacking direction. But Peklo
was determined to keep the pro-
gram alive. He worked to get funds
from the school to buy equipment.

And by this year, he had a
four-man shell ready for action.
This fall, 20 students, male and
female, came out to row. Most had
never rowed before, but Hinton is
an experienced oarsman and he
acted as a player/coach.

The team worked hard all fall
hoping to get into a few competi-
tions this spring, but over Christ-
mas vacation, disaster struck. The
one shell the team had was crushed
by a fallen tree during a storm.

Now the team was back to
square one.

The hope of any races this
spring was over, but the team
looked ahead to next year and be-
yond. They bought two shells, four-
man boats and also picked up a
single shell. By mid-March, the
team was back in action working
hard to prepare for several races
planned for next year.

Peklo placed in competitions
in Atlanta, Baltimore, Charleston,
Charlotte, Clemson, and Duke.

They are also trying to raise funds
to buy an eight-man shell, so that
the whole team would be able to
practice at the same time. As it
stands, the team practices in two
shifts.

As much as the team has im-
proved, they are striving to do bet-
ter. If all goes well next year, the
team could receive more funds
from the school and build the pro-
gram even more.

Out of 20 members, just two
are juniors and the rest are fresh-
men and sophomores, so the team
will be going strong for a while.

After jumpstarting the pro-
gram, Peklo is very excited about
the success of the program and
proud of his hard work. Peklo and
Hinton should be commended for
their dedication to a challenging
but rewarding sport.

If anyone is interested in join-
ing the program, newcomers are
always welcome.

everything, to be modern and to
appeal to youngsters that it has
effectively alienated true basket-
ball fans.

Today, the vast majority of
NBA games aren’t real basketball.
Most players hit the court with a
lack of emotion and lack of feel-
ing. Stars take six steps on a drive
to the basket.

That’s not a dazzling layup.

That’s walking.

Big thugs that are passed off
as centers get away with elbows to
the jaw underneath the basket.

That’s not blocking out.

That’s fighting.

And none of that belongs in
basketball.

Perhaps the perfect pro bas-
ketball game would be a typical
college game. There would be
emotion. There would be true ex-
citement. Players would actually
follow the rules. Officials would
actually enforce the rules equally
against both teams.

And some of us might be NBA
fans again.

The playoffs have some of
that. There is more emotion, since
the players apparently do care a
little more about whether they win
or lose.

Of course, the NBA playoffs
will never be able to approach the
NCAA tournament in terms of ex-
citement — one reason simply be-
ing that the damn thing is two months
long. It’s pretty hard to maintain a
high level of adrenaline for that
long.

So, now with Jordan back on
the floor, more people will prob-
ably flip on the game to see how
many times he can score 48 points.

Some will probably turn on
the TV to see the tongue wagging
and the wide grin on his face.

And he’ll probably be able to
stop some people from turning the
league off.

If you are a junior and need to pad your
resumé, call us in The Davidsonian office,
and we’ll put you to work next fall. Get a
head start on your future, work for The
South’s Foremost College Weekly.
