### Appalachian Beats Cats

By ROY GRIER  
Staff Writer

Davidson’s new era in college football suffered a staggering blow last Saturday against Appalachian State University in a 30-0 loss. It was the first contest of the 1974 season for the Wildcats.

“We're not happy with our performance,” said head coach Ed Farrell, “but there’s no way we’re the least bit discouraged. I felt we continued to hustle and we proved we can hit. I don’t think they out-hit us.”

The Wildcats never penetrated the Appalachian 38-yard line and were plagued by third down and long yardage situations. They only managed 111 total yards as quarterback Dave Harper completed nine of twenty passes for 87 yards in the air. The Cats fumbled the ball away twice, but made two interceptions and recovered three Appalachian fumbles.

Farrell believes the problems suffered during Saturday’s frustrating battle were ones that can be solved. The team didn’t begin preparing specifically for Appalachian until the week before the game. Farrell stressed that a program is being built on basics which will get better. “I believe in a player-oriented offense and defense rather than a coach-oriented program,” stated Farrell.

What can I say? One moment I walk innocently into THE DAVIDSONIAN office, a mere assistant managing editor (you see, everyone on this staff has a title; it’s part of our participatory democracy system), and I emerged shortly thereafter a dazed and bemused sports editor.

Three quantum jumps upward in title and four less hours sleep on Tuesday and Wednesday nights.

But that much in itself I can handle. No matter that I know next to nothing about the D.C. sports scene. I have a feeling that I’ll learn damned quick. So what if I have a staff of none; just plagiarize from the Observer and keep the IMAC columns coming.

If that isn’t enough, all I have to do is whip out a sports column full of double entendres (find one if you can), jokes about wimps, guesses about the 1982 football schedule, and praise for the fine new track (see related article).

Half my pages are ads, and half of the rest is over-developed pictures. “The rest” no one reads anyway. And since you gave up on this column in the middle of the last paragraph, it should now be safe for me to unveil my four-point program for injecting new life into the sports department.

**Point the First:** Put gum along the outside edges of the pages, and use a lighter weight of paper. You might think Big Bambus make party joints. Wait until you roll with the sports pages.

**Point the Second:** Determine if any other college in the nation plays that singular sport of flickerball. After the response is found to be rather negative, proclaim the winner of the IMAC jousts to be the IMAC World Champions and do four pages of features on them each week for the rest of the year.

**Point the Third:** Junk the present format (words and pictures) for nine one-inch in diameter black circles artistically arranged, three rows of three circles, and sell the pages to ROTC for small arms practice.

An alternative would be to cut the circles out and wear one on your back so the men in blue could sharpen their skills like our boys in green do.

**Point the Fourth:** Diligently stick to Point the First.

Harper’s performance pleased Coach Farrell. “I thought he called a good offensive game,” he said. But Harper is new to Farrell’s program and is having to start all over again, working on things a senior doesn’t normally work on.

Davidson’s schedule has been toned down somewhat this year; yet it will provide plenty of competition for the Cats as they test the wings of Farrell’s program here. “I would be surprised if anybody we play has better material than Appalachian,” Farrell said.

There were a few minor injuries on Saturday, but none of them were serious enough to lose anybody for any period of time. Jose Rodriguez has a slight shoulder separation which might keep him out of the VMI game.

Farrell remained optimistic about the chances of a winning season. “The ingredients to be winners are here, with a realistic schedule. We have no excuses, but we’re not far away from being a good football team,” he concluded.
