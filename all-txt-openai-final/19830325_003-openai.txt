**SGA Weekend Underway | Davidson Hosts Seventy Prospectives**

By DAN VOORHIS

Davidson College is playing host to about 70 prospective students during the annual SGA Weekend which began yesterday afternoon. These potential members of the class of '87 will be informed about college life and entertained until midday tomorrow. High school seniors from all over the country and abroad are invited for three days of non-stop activity to give them a taste of "the Davidson experience." They attend talks, dinners, tours, classes, dances, movies, and even have a few precious hours of free time.

"Of course we're showing the prospectives Davidson in the best light, but all the fraternities, and faculty, and people they see would be the same as if they were students," said Chairman of SGA Weekend Ester Kim.

Although the final number of participants was unclear until the program started Thursday, about 70 prospectives had sent in acceptances. "They are the most highly qualified candidates from all over the country," said Admissions Counselor Alex McCallie. The College sent invitations to this year's top 300 applicants, then let the student organizers go to work. "Ultimately, it is the attitude and behavior of the students that will affect them [the prospectives]," said McCallie.

Students carry out the entire job of planning and executing the SGA Weekend. Ester Kim oversees the event, because she chairs both the Student Admissions Team and the SGA Admissions Committee. Last year she co-chaired the weekend with Warren Overbey. Subcommittees involved in the Weekend include: Programming, led by Lindsey Rader and Vickie Neale; Entertainment, led by Steve Reardon; Transportation, under Garry Banks and Brad Perkins; Publicity, chaired by Garry Banks; and Housing, under Chuck Lampley. The Transportation committee ran drivers down to the Charlotte airport, bus terminal, and train station, using College vehicles.

The prospectives dined at the Commons last night with presentations by Will Terry and various students. Anne Miano explained the Honor Code and academics; Suzanne Dickey discussed Patterson Court and the Union; Mitzi Short spoke on the Black Student Coalition, SGA, and extra-curriculars; and Steve Soud pontificated on sports. After dinner the new arrivals experienced the ubiquitous "people hunt" and square dance.

**Academic/Social Balance Demanded | Library Staff Compiles Questionnaire**

By JOHN SYME

The results of the library noise questionnaire circulated last Fall indicate that students feel there should be a balance between the social and academic aspects of the library. The results, which the library staff compiled last week, reflect the opinions of 25 percent of the student body. Two hundred participants were randomly selected by computer to receive questionnaires, and the remaining 144 responded to a stack of identical questionnaires available in the library. Distribution according to sex and class approximated Davidson norms. Complete statistics and responses are posted near the entrance to the library.

Student opinion on the need for noise control varied from none to a suggestion for employing a SWAT team. Of students polled, 37.8 percent said they would use the library more if it were quieter, 55.4 percent said they would use it about the same, and 6.8 percent said they would use it less. One student said that the noise level in the library is "indicative of the skewed social situation at Davidson, where the students have to go to the library to have fun." Other students liked the social aspect of the library, and one asked, "What is every college library but a place to see friends and influence people?" Many students mentioned the Code of Responsibility, and one went as far as to equate making noise in the library with lying and cheating.

Students offered many solutions: signs ("No socializing — study — make A's!"), monitors, regulated noise zones, going to the Union, and "self-policing." Other noise problems mentioned included squeaky chairs, computer terminals (particularly in the 24-hour study room), loudly banging doors, and the in-Stay in student dormitories. Students chat at the circulation desk in the library, inevitable book-card stamper. Library Director, Leland Park, agrees with the student who wrote that “it is up to the students to make the library what they want it to be.” He said that the general thrust of the responses was, “This is our place, and we’ll take care of it.” Park stressed the importance of students feeling comfortable with the library staff, since their job is to help students with library resources, not to “shoosh” them. The social aspect of the library pleases Park, except for the truly thoughtless people, and it would be “a little chicken” of students to insist on official monitors. Designers of E.H. Little Library concentrated on the intrinsically noisy places on purpose. Head of Serials and Documents Cindy Pendergraft said that there is always someplace quiet to go, and “anybody dumb enough to sit down in the middle of all the confusion we’ve had on this [first] floor tonight, well, that’s what they’ll have.” Associate Dean of Students Sue Ross commented that the Davidson library is “one of the pleasant dormitory rooms, mostly on the floor, mattresses, or couches. The Housing committee has tried to assign as many prospectives to freshmen as possible. According to Lampley, the freshmen would have the most in common with the prospects. In fact, many of the class of ’86 went to the SGA Weekend last year. More than one prospective will be placed on a hall to promote companionship, staying both Thursday and Friday nights. While the hosts are not obligated to do more than house them, the organizers hope that the prospectives will hear a more personal view of the college from these students. Today was a day crammed with activities, including a sample of both academic and social fare of Davidson. To gain an everyday knowledge of studies, the prospectives will attend two introductory courses in areas of their choice. Longer range academic experience comes from the Departmental/Professional panel discussion. Here the candidates will hear faculty, alumni, and students consider the value of Davidson education in four broad areas: pre-medical, pre-law, business, and communications. Prospectives will meet students and faculty at a reception today at 5:00 in the Gallery. Most of the remaining time is devoted to having fun and investigating the social life at Davidson. Groups of 8-10 spread out and sampled Patterson Court for lunch today. Afterwards, they participated in a scavenger hunt. Regular College activities will contribute to the carnival atmosphere of the weekend. Three discos, one in the 900 Room on Thursday, one at the BSC, and another at KA on Friday will allow them to dance to their hearts’ content. A Fine Film and Raiders of the Lost Ark will provide movie entertainment. Two men’s tennis matches and a baseball game should satisfy the sports enthusiasts. In addition, the prospectives will attend a formal banquet tonight at the Commons. Senior Mike Mason will speak on his impressions of Davidson during the festivities. The SGA Weekend favorably impressed students who attended it last year. Freshman John Gilmer said that it was one of his deciding factors in coming to Davidson. “It was a good thing because it gives you a good feel for the College. And we had a lot of fun,” said Gilmer. Although the Weekend is necessarily a distorted view of Davidson, “it is as accurate as two days can be.” Sophomore Chuck Lampley, who came in 1981, agrees, “What you see over the Weekend is what you see as a student.” He also said that the Weekend was a good mix of academics and social life. It definitely influenced his choice because “other schools only have an interview and tour.” But Freshman Elodie McMillan disagreed. “You never really got to meet any of the students because you were always doing something.”
