Gridders rout usual shutout, ruggers capture dual games

In gridiron activity last Sunday, Davidson’s club football team held on to an 8-6 advantage over Central Piedmont Community College to increase their five-game winning streak to six.

The win against CPCC, who is led by quarterback/disc jockey Jay Thomas, was an especially sweet one for the club team because Davidson had never even scored against this team in all previous contests.

The victory was proof of the turnaround that has occurred this year with club football.

Davidson scored first in the game when Freddy Clayton ran the ball across the goal line from about eight yards out. Quarterback Mark Firth scored a two-point conversion moments later, when, on a roll-out play, he elected to keep the ball and run it in.

Davidson had several more offensive sieges in the game but wasn’t able to produce another score. As it turned out, they didn’t need to.

Davidson’s defense held the CPCC team to very little yardage, and only late in the third quarter could Central Piedmont mount an effective scoring drive.

Their first and only score was set up by a 40-yard pass completion to put them in good field position for the first time. They pushed the ball across the goal shortly after that, but a CPCC receiver dropped a pass to nullify the two-point conversion.

Davidson then held off a fourth-quarter rally by Central Piedmont and ran out the clock with the final score Davidson-8, Central Piedmont-6.

Davidson ruggers downed a number two ranked Greensboro 12-10 and Belmont Abbey 24-23 Saturday.

Mark Connors ran the first score against Greensboro and Dan Boggins added two field goals for the Cats in the first game of the afternoon. Greensboro then seemed to gain control of the game but were stopped by Mark Armstrong, Bucky Banks, and Mike Stick. For the first time this spring, Davidson controlled the scrum as Joe Craig spiked his way in for the hooks.

The second game of the day was opened immediately with a break against Belmont Abbey by Bruce Wallace.

The Belmont Abbey team appeared to gain domination of the game as they scored three quick tries.

But Davidson retaliated as Crawford, David Swain, and Hendricks all scored in the last two minutes of the game.

Cat runners suffer second defeat

Davidson’s track team suffered its second loss Tuesday by a score of 86-57 in a dual meet against Washington and Lee University at Lexington, Virginia.

The mile run, the only event which was swept by the Cats, was won by Doug Horn in 4:24.42; following him in second and third places were Fred Borch and Coty Pinckney.

In other running events, Carl McPhail took the 440-yard Intermediate Hurdles in a time of 58:02 and Mark Postove followed in second. The three-mile run was won by Fred Borch, who finished in 15:04.4 while Coty Pinckney came from behind in the last 100 yards and sprinted to second place in that race.

In the field events, John Stanfield took the first Davidson victory by winning the high jump at 6’0”. John Lewis took first place in the pole vault at 13’0”, and McPhail became the Cats’ only double victor by winning the triple jump at 41’3”. Two events in which the Wildcats are strong, the steeplechase and the hammer throw, were not held in the contest.

Coach Sterling Martin, commenting on the meet, said that “we surely didn’t perform as well as we’re able; on any other day, we could probably beat them.”

He cited the combination of the weather and the track as well as the pre-meet injuries of Stanfield and Dick Boehner as factors affecting the outcome of the contest.

Martin said that he was nonetheless “pleased with the performances of the milers and half-milers” and added that “They (W & L) beat us fair and square.”

The Cats, whose record is now 2-2, see their next action Saturday when they travel to Western Carolina for the WCU relays.
