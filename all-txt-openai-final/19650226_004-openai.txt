Fabulous Frosh Finish Season With 14-3 Mark
By JOHN ALLEN
Davidsonian Sports Writer

Davidson’s fabulous freshman basketball squad finished a successful season Saturday with a 116-69 win over the frosh cadets from the
Citadel. Tom Youngdale led all scorers with a 26-point mark as the Kittens, believed by some to be possibly the
best freshman squad in Davidson basketball history, finished the season with a 14-3 won-lost record. Coach Terry Holland, freshman mentor,
feels the season has been very successful and that the squad has developed tremendously.

“We were disappointed with our losses, of course,” he says. “We should have beaten Duke at least once and should
never have lost to UNC, but I am very pleased with the season as a whole.”

The Kittens racked up some impressive figures in their action this season, outscoring their opponents by an average of 15
points with an 86-71 average scoring output. The starting five all totaled double-figure season scoring averages. “Wee Tom” Youngdale, 6'10"
pivotman, led the Wildkittens in rebounding and scoring with a season total of 312 points for an 18.35 average. Bobby
Lane had 271 points and a 16-point average, Scott Sinnock had a 289 total with a 13-point average and playmaker
Cecil Clifton scored 189 points for an 11-point average. Rod Knowles missed three games but still managed a 257-point total
and a 16.4 average. George Leight led the reserves in scoring with 95 points, Pinky Hatcher had a season total
of 51 and Tommy Clayton had 28 points and a 77% field-goal accuracy.

Notes Holland, “The boys have come along well and are all ready to play varsity ball. All eight should definitely
be on the squad next year, and three, maybe four, of them will start.” Tom Youngdale and Rod Knowles, the
frosh big men, will be called on to fill the positions of graduating Ron Davidson and All-American Fred Hetzel, a
tough assignment. Sinnock and Lane, two terrific scorers, and Clifton, a top-notch ball handler, will be fighting with the returning
upperclassmen for the starting berths to be vacated by seniors Barry Teague and Charlie Marcon. Leight, Hatcher, and Clayton will
add reserve strength to the team and like the first five will be counted on heavily.

“These freshmen could all be the nucleus of next year’s varsity,” reports Holland. “We will really be depending on them
next year, but they have worked hard and progressed rapidly and we think they can do the job.”

Coach Homer Smith's footballers have begun preparing for spring practice for next year's season with a newly-devised program of running
and weight lifting. The objective of “Homer's New Look” is “to get the players in the habit of being in
good physical shape all year round.”

“Successful football,” he continues, “depends on this type of conditioning. Since you can't practice football in the off-season as you
do basketball or golf, the only thing that can be done is to keep in shape.”

The new program especially emphasizes that it is not only a regimented program, but very general, flexible, and completely voluntary.
“It depends primarily on the attitude of the boys, which has been excellent,” he adds.

Because of the entirely new outlook in Davidson football, Smith suggests, “We must spend most of the time in the
twenty days of spring practice on the technical part and, therefore, must spend as little time as possible on conditioning.”

The weight program was devised by a trainer at Salt Lake and will be on a year-round basis at Davidson.
Non-football players are welcomed to participate and are encouraged to do so. In the running program, the players are timing
themselves for measurement of their improvement.

Bank Recruits Dole; Coach Closes Cleats

Former Head Football Coach Bill Dole has accepted a position with the First National Bank of Catawba County. Dole moves
to Hickory in about a month and begins work shortly thereafter. He will be concerned with the personnel, public relations,
and advertising side of the business.

“I'll be traveling around Catawba County to the different branch banks and will do some work with newspapers and radio,”
Dole reports. Asked whether he might become connected in an unofficial way with football at Lenoir-Rhyne College, Dole speculated, “The
bank will close at 5 p.m. and my job will end about 3:30, which would make it possible to help
with football at LR.”

R. Walker Geitner, president of the bank, said he was pleased to have “such an outstanding and well-known man join
the bank staff.” Dole received his BS degree from West Virginia University and his Masters from New York University. While
coaching at Davidson, Dole served as president of the Southern Conference Football Coaches Association and was on the executive committee
of the North Carolina High School Athletic Association.

spring and next fall, and it is important that we have a daily routine that encourages conditioning.”

“I’m overjoyed to see the athletic fields filled with activity every afternoon. One of the great advantages at Davidson is
that the athletic fields are near the dorms and therefore easily available.”

Davidson's riflemen journeyed to Blacksburg Saturday and dropped a 1449-1360 decision to VPI’s nationally ranked Gobblers. Malcolm X. Cook, the
top scorer for VPI, led all shooters with a score of 293 out of 300. In fact, all of the
VPI team had scores higher than our top score. Sgt. Bayes commended VPI as “a fine team, who just had
to pick our meet to break their school record.” Other scores for VPI were John Osmers with 292 and Rick
Moore with 291. Lee Young shot a 288 and Ralph Fite had a 286. Jim Kopp led the Davidson marksmen
with a 261. He was followed by Jim Clark and Wallace Hastes with 275 and 270, respectively. Will Norman and
Joe Bailey both had 267's. Sgt. Bayes reported that he was “pleased with our shooting, but it is hard to
compete against schools which have required practice.”

While the Southern and Atlantic Coast Conferences persist in determining their NCAA representatives by the post-season tournament method, the other
18 major conferences are entering their final week of regular season action with nine teams almost certain of playing in
one of the four regional tournaments which precede the National Championship at Portland, Oregon. Ten at-large berths are available for
the nation’s best unaffiliated teams; however, only in the East is the NCAA certain of an overabundance of qualified teams.

EASTERN REGIONAL

The regional tournament of most interest to this area is the Eastern Regional, which includes a tripleheader in Philadelphia's Palestra
March 8 and the finals and semi-finals at College Park, Maryland, March 12 and 13. The Eastern format will feature
the Ivy League representative against an at-large team, unranked Penn State, the Middle Atlantic Conference champion versus the Yankee Conference
champ, and the Southern Conference's tournament champion against fourth-ranked Providence, which sports a 19-1 record and lists St. Joseph’s among
its victims. The Ivy-Penn. St. winner will play the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament champion March 12 and the winners of
the other two Philadelphia games will meet the same night at College Park. St. Joseph's, the nation’s third-ranked quintet, finished
its conference schedule tonight against LaSalle and has a lock on the Middle Atlantic Championship. Likewise, Connecticut sits well above
the rest of the Yankee Conference with a 20-2 record, including a loss to ACC doormat Virginia. The Ivy League
race will be decided tomorrow night as Princeton (13-6) meets Cornell (10-3) at Princeton. Princeton, last year’s champ, must win
and then beat Pennsylvania next week to appear in Philadelphia. Princeton is favored over the Big Red because of veteran
superstar Bill Bradley and the home court advantage in the Tigers' crackerbox-size gymnasium. The Southern Conference tournament this weekend will
be followed next weekend by the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament at Raleigh. Duke, seeded first, faces stern challenges from North
Carolina, North Carolina State, and Maryland.

MIDEAST REGIONAL

In the Mideast Regional, Miami (Ohio) of the Mid-American Conference meets an at-large team while Eastern Kentucky of the Ohio
Valley Conference meets another independent team from the South or Midwest—Independents in this tourney are Dayton and DePaul, both unranked.
The winners of these two games will advance to the University of Kentucky campus at Lexington to meet the Big
Ten and Southeastern Conference champions, respectively. First-ranked Michigan beat seventh-ranked Minnesota 91-78 last Tuesday, but the Wolverines still must meet
Minnesota next Saturday and thirteenth-ranked Illinois tomorrow night before claiming the title. Southeastern leader Vanderbilt must still meet fourth-place Alabama
twice while second-place Tennessee faces four second division opponents during the next eight days.

MIDWEST REGIONAL

In the Midwest Regional, three at-large teams and the Southwest's probable champ Texas Tech will battle to earn trips to
Manhattan, Kansas to meet Big Eight titlist Oklahoma State and tenth-ranked Wichita State, which continues to win despite the January
graduation of Dave Stallworth and the academic ineligibility of Nate Bowman. If Wichita can keep rolling on its momentum, it
is favored to top Oklahoma State which sports only a so-so record this year. Houston, Oklahoma State, and Colorado State,
all unranked, are the at-large teams.

FAR WEST REGIONAL

In the Far West Regionals, second-ranked UCLA and eleventh-ranked San Francisco will be waiting at Provo, Utah, to meet the
winners of an at-large game featuring two independents and the Western Athletic Conference champion versus a third independent. Tenth-ranked on
one wire service, New Mexico must face Brigham Young March 6 in a match which will probably determine the conference
champion. Seattle, the leading independent in the Pacific West, was rocked by a betting scandal involving several of its starters
and whether the Chieftains will return to the NCAA this year is undecided. Portland is among the other teams being
considered for the at-large berths.
