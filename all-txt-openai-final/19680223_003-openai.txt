**Apathetic Not Indifferent**
By BOB DUNHAM
News Editor

Although the Davidson student generally is not willing to become actively involved in issues beyond his textbooks, he still maintains
an active concern for these issues. Such was the opinion of a cross-section of Davidson students, faculty, and administration when
they were questioned about the supposed apathy of the Davidson student body. Most of the people expressing opinions agreed with
the opinion of psychology professor William G. Workman, who commented that “Davidson merely lacks the critical mass necessary to trigger
an explosion.”

“There simply aren't enough students here for our school to be like Berkeley,” he said. “If we had 10,000 Davidson
students, we would probably be more aware of active involvement and participation among students in regard to major issues.” Workman
added that this does not necessarily indicate apathy. “We have to look at such apathy in the terms of the
world beyond Davidson,” he said. “We say that the Davidson student needs to care more about what is happening,” he
continued, “and it is healthy to compare Davidson with the ideal. However, we must stop to compare ourselves with the
realistic.”

“The problem here is that the students here have such a narrow base of comparison,” said Workman. “Very few students
have any real experience with other schools on which to base a comparison.”

Assistant Dean of Students Jim Terry acknowledged the lack of involvement on the part of the Davidson student, but he
said that it was due, in his opinion, to the “harmonious blend of the student cross-section, which tends to obscure
any isolated views or actions.” Terry stated that he felt there were several reasons for this lack of involvement. “Most
students decide before they even arrive as freshmen that they don't want to get involved,” he said. “This usually results
in no involvement in anything other than classwork until the junior or senior year.”

“Other students are so involved in academic self-survival,” said Terry, “that they are afraid to take time for other interests.”
Terry noted the recent student vote on the Student Government Association constitution as an example of this failure of the
student to get excited about major issues. “How long does it take to cast a ballot?” he asked. “And yet
so few are willing to take the moment to express their interest. Certainly the few seconds it takes to cast
the ballot are not wasted.”

“A good number are concerned,” he said, “and yet they are not willing to spend the least amount of time
to express this concern.” He commented that the new Student Government Association should help relieve this need for active involvement
by involving more people. “It is important to start now to relieve the problem,” Terry concluded. “We need to begin
with incoming freshmen and help channel their interests, so that they don't fall into a rut.”

Senior Tom Rhodes acknowledged apathy on the part of students in some issues, but added that students at Davidson are
more unapathetic about their own future than many other college students. According to Rhodes, “the Davidson student accepts a lot
of things without question, mainly due to acceptance of parental beliefs.” He noted a two-part process in the fulfillment of
a liberal arts education, and the necessity of both parts for a student to be complete, including active involvement in
many issues.

“The first part,” Rhodes said, “is a liberation from dogmas of the home environment, while the second is a resynthesizing
of personality and beliefs.” “Davidson tends to spend more time on the second part,” he said, “and we need to
move more toward a total experience, if we want to remove the apathy from the Davidson student.”

Another senior, Geoff Seamans, noted the school's role in determining the amount of student involvement. “The Davidson environment tends to
inhibit all involvement,” Seamans commented. “The school tends to encourage the ability to compromise in one's beliefs, and to discourage
any willingness to proclaim openly any personal cause.” He added, “Davidson is unlike most large schools, where there are numerous
students ready to work for a cause. At Davidson, the individual has to take the initiative to effect any cause
or interest.”

Another reason, according to Seamans, was the student’s “lack of knowledge of what the faculty is doing; he gets rumors,
but very few facts about faculty decisions.” Several of the people who expressed opinions commented that such a discussion brought
out more questions than answers, but most of them agreed that this discussion was one of extreme importance for all
students, which must be resolved by the individuals. Workman noted that this type of discussion was a healthy sign, commenting
that “internal criticism of a school is expressive of an intense interest in it.”

**Radicals Seek To Rend Fabric Of U.S. Society**
By BOB REID

To some members of the new Left, student activism means rending the entire fabric of society. While other student activists
are primarily interested in campus issues, the radicals have turned their energies to more far-reaching goals. “We would like to
see a socialist society where the needs of the overwhelming number of people are met, not just those of the
rich.” This was the opinion of Jeffrey Gordon, a member of the New York-based Progressive Labor Party (PLP), which has
become the darling of the radical left.

The PLP maintains chapters on campuses throughout the country, but since the party has been shadowed by the FBI, the
leadership is reluctant to release the size and number of the chapters. Called Chinese oriented by rival groups, the PLP
considers itself the vanguard of a revolution which will sweep away the capitalist system. “Socialism in the United States can
only be obtained by revolution,” Gordon said. “The people who rule the society repress attempts to change society peacefully.”

Although the revolutionaries will learn from the experience of foreign rebels, the uprising will be led and inspired by American
leaders, he said. “What happens around the world affects us,” he said, “but the revolution must be brought about internally.
I support actions in certain countries, but the key thing is that we have to develop the type of system
that will best serve the people here.”

The party considers itself part of a worldwide revolutionary movement, Gordon said, which includes the National Liberation Front of Vietnam
and the Chinese Communist Party. But Gordon was careful to maintain that the PLP is not controlled by a foreign
influence. Although he did not predict the date of the revolution, Gordon claimed that conditions for uprising are rapidly developing.
“The urban riots, Vietnam and the rising consumer prices will all help set up conditions for revolution.”

“The way a revolution develops is when the people fight for their needs and they realize the system cannot give
them what they want. Then they decide on change.” The political system after the revolution will be one based on
popular will, he said. Officials will be more representative of the people's will. They will not be corrupt, and they
will be subject to recall. Details of the system will evolve from the needs of the situation, he said.

Although the revolution will overthrow contemporary society, the movement will not be foreign oriented and will draw on the traditions
of America for inspiration, he said. “There are a lot of great things in the traditions of the United States,
such as the abolitionist movement and the struggles of the trade unions. I would look for heroes of these struggles
for inspiration.”

But the PLP is definitely internationalist, according to Gordon. “We're a movement based on struggles of the American people but
look to the struggles of people all over the world as united. We are opposed to a system which murders
and oppresses people all over the world and at home.”

**Cornell Is Large, Urbane**

The student who enters Davidson from another college quickly makes comparisons. As a transfer from Cornell University, I have observed
some striking contrasts between the two schools. The Davidson student is markedly conservative by comparison. The background of the students
provides part of the answer. Cornell has a distinctly eastern ethos. White Anglo-Saxon Protestants do not form a majority of
the students. Ghetto Negroes, urban Jews, Oriental Americans, and prep school graduates give the campus a cosmopolitan air.

Fifty-three fraternities compete annually for pledges. Independent life is the choice of about one-third of each class. The fraternities have
seen the need to reform themselves if they are to get the top men in a student body that has
become increasingly serious, even intellectual, in recent years. Overall, the fraternities have come to contribute more to the university.

**Student Demonstrations Not Improper-Educator**
GRAND FORKS, N.D. (IP) — Student demonstrations are not necessarily contrary to the purposes of a university, said Dr. Ronald
E. Barnes, vice president for student affairs at the University of North Dakota. Since the campus is an academic community
which fosters exchange of ideas, “We can be proud of students who are concerned enough about societal issues to assert
their views,” he added.

His perspective on student dissent was expressed in an interview with the UND News Bureau. Some questions and answers follow:

Q. The news media of the nation quite regularly carry reports of “student unrest,” “student activism,” “student power.” What is
your general interpretation of these activities on U.S. campuses?

A. My initial response is that the reporting of the student unrest not only exaggerates the situation in the minds...Here

of the public but is an inaccurate reflection of what is happening on our campuses. Frankly, I wish more students
were questioning and actively seeking to improve the society in which they live. I believe the primary task facing those
of us within our nation’s colleges and universities is to awaken students who are indifferent to the educational process, who
are content merely to acquire useful skill training, and who are complacently uninvolved in learning. Unfortunately, those of us in
higher education apparently have not done a very good job of communicating to the public what higher education is about.
The primary task of a college or university is not to train youth for job slots, nor serve as national
resource centers, nor to “contain” students until society is ready to absorb them into the job market. The purpose of
an institution for higher learning is to educate. This includes preparing a person for a specialized profession and the acquisition
of knowledge, but it is more. It means, among other things, that a student should develop a critical attitude of
investigation, become capable of making independent judgments, liberated from prejudice, and excited about the adventure of learning. In other words,
education should prepare one to live fully and meaningfully apart from his vocation. This means that a university cannot avoid
issues, dodge questions, shy from controversy or put safety before truth. The university bases its existence on ideas, their discovery
and transmittal; and ideas are risky but exciting. Members of the faculty and administration want our students involved in this
excitement, to question us, challenge us, examine and evaluate our ideas, criticize them, and relate their thoughts and their lives
to ideas.

This reversal of the anti-intellectual tradition in the fraternities was boosted last year by an experimental Interfraternity Council program entitled
“The Soul of Blackness.” The week-long program brought together on campus a Negro drama group, Negro poets and historians, and
Negro art shows in a series of programs which focused on the cultural tradition of the American Negro. This year
the topic for the IFC week is “Election: 1968.” Several prominent national political figures will appear on that program scheduled
for next week at Cornell. Cornell, like Davidson, is run by policy made by faculty committees. In recent years students
have been named as voting members of some of these committees. But more effective than students on the committees has
been the persistent work of students appearing before faculty committee meetings for months about particular policy changes. Last year by
this process the Freshman Class Council gained approval of driving privileges for second-semester freshmen—a prohibition dating from the end of
World War II. Open house rules which allow women in the dormitories were liberalized. New open house hours are longer,
and a more realistic policy allows more privacy than under the old rules. Last fall the Freshman Class Council finally
won faculty approval for a change in dormitory liquor policy. Rules which prohibited alcoholic beverages in the freshman dormitories were
repealed. Student administration confrontations are frequent at Cornell. Crises were precipitated last year by campus marijuana arrests, military recruiters on
campus, and by the illegal seizure of a student publication by campus police on obscenity charges. High prices and poor
food brought a student boycott of university cafeterias. The Vietnam War continues to be the primary student concern at Cornell.
The Student Council last year sponsored a convention on Vietnam which drew representatives from scores of eastern schools. The March
on Washington last fall numbered one to two thousand Cornellians in its crowd. The New York City demonstration in the
spring of 1967 drew almost as many. Numbers of students have fasted this year in protest to the war. An
around-the-clock peace vigil endured several weeks of the harsh New York winter in the last weeks before Christmas. Faculty members
and campus clergy are helping to support a printing office available for use by groups who have liberal causes to
publicize. A protest newspaper is published regularly. Almost daily, protest literature is handed to students on the steps of the
Student Union. Firm individual commitment is the basis for most of this student activism. And although the American people seem
generally to ascribe Vietnam protests to “those dirty hippies,” at Cornell protest comes from all segments of the student population.
A student population in excess of 15,000 makes Cornell a bureaucratic, inflexible institution in many ways. Yet with classes as
large as 500 students, make-up exams are scheduled by the professors in consultation with the students. The idea behind this
policy, apparently, is that such matters are the concern only of the student and his teacher. Rigid policy could only
hinder the procedure.

SDS Is Involved In Broad Issues

Unlike some activist groups, the Students for a Democratic Society tries to involve itself in both campus and national issues.
“We try to interest students in gaining influence over the mechanism for change,” said Miss Marilyn MacNabb, field organizer for
the left-wing haven of the upper middle class. “We are especially interested in changes that involve the federal government.” Miss
MacNabb said the SDS does not ordinarily involve itself in local campus politics, nor does it usually take action in
lesser issues such as dormitory hours and drinking rules. But in issues of broader significance, the SDS takes an active
role. “For instance,” she said, “some of the colleges in the D.C. area have been involved in germ warfare research.
Students have no voice in whether or not they want this sort of thing.” “If the university exists to serve
and train the students, then it needs to be sensitive to what students want. Students should have a share in
determining what type of academic community they want to live in.” Draft resistance has become one of the chief SDS
goals, she added. SDS is opposed to the Vietnam War, and the members feel that draft resistance offers the most
effective means of protest, she said. SDS uses several avenues of resistance, she said, including distributing information on legal alternatives
to conscription. Refusing induction is the last resort, she added. Finances and membership are the major problems of SDS, she
said. “You’re lucky you called early because our phone is being repossessed today,” she quipped.

NSA Finds Place Among Students

After floundering for a year in search of a new identity, the National Student Association has discovered a place for
itself in American student life. From its headquarters in Washington, D.C., NSA advises student activists throughout the country on ways
to implement campus reforms. Long associated with liberal ideals, NSA is still hawking progressive policies, such as black power and
a U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam. But under the leadership of President Ed Schwartz, NSA has become the spokesman for moderate
student activism. “We do not encourage student strikes as a matter of principle,” Schwartz said with a whisper of a
Northern accent. “Nor do we encourage hanging the dean in effigy every time students don’t get their way.” But Schwartz’s
philosophy does not rule out strikes as a means to gain reform. At the University of California at Berkeley, Schwartz
advised student leaders to join with the radicals in calling for a student strike. “If there are no other means
available to institute reform, then we encourage strikes. Our policy is very flexible.” NSA’s policies are so flexible that some
radicals have charged that the organization has no policy at all, except to gain the maximum amount of publicity. Many
of these radicals became disenchanted with NSA following the CIA scandal last year and with the convention held that following
summer. It was a year ago last week that Ramparts Magazine broke the story that the Central Intelligence Agency had
been funding NSA in return for information on foreign student leaders. The announcement rocked the organization so much that some
observers gave it only a few months to live. More liberal supporters denounced NSA and predicted an exodus of member
student governments. But the prophecy was never fulfilled. Some schools, such as Brandeis University, left the association, but most stayed
on. Several new schools have since joined, offsetting the defections and raising the number of members from 285 to 335.
But some leftists who weathered the CIA crisis could not stand the climate at the July convention in College Park,
Md. With the victory of Schwartz over Sam Brown for the presidency, the moderates gained control of the NSA leadership.
NSA seems to have survived the defection of liberals, but the loss of CIA funds has presented a more challenging
problem, Schwartz said. The organization is going through a crucial period now, Schwartz said, but officials are optimistic that funds
will be coming soon. “We still do not have sufficient resources to provide the services we’d like to,” Schwartz said.
“We’re building and this will take time. But a few things are developing.” Those “few things” include low-cost life insurance,
charter flights to Europe and a national student record club. Fees from some of these services will form the bulk
of NSA’s revenue, Schwartz said, along with dues from member student governments. Schwartz said he hopes to have the association
solvent by January 1969. In the field of student power, NSA publishes literature on the legal rights of students in
matters pertaining to control by administration. Several staff members are available to advise student leaders on their rights in matters
of college discipline, Schwartz said. NSA is now pleading with administrations to adopt more lenient policies in regard to punishing
marijuana smokers. According to Schwartz, NSA wants administrations to refrain from turning student violators over to civil authorities as a
matter of policy.
