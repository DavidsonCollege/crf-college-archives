YOU TAKE THAT BACK RIGHT NOW, GAIL.
AN HISTORIC YEAR FOR WOMEN AT DAVIDSON. FEMALES ARE ADMITTED FOR THE FIRST TIME, ALTHOUGH WOMEN HAD TAUGHT HERE FOR
OVER A DECADE ALREADY. IT'S NOT JUST A JOB - IT'S FOR REAL ESTATE.

ROARS
DAVIDSONIAN? FIFTY-THREE, FIFTY-FOUR...
WAS TOO, CYNTHIA. BESIDES, CHAUCER HAD A PONY.

COACH HUSSEY, CARE TO COMMENT ON THE DAVIDSONIAN COVERAGE OF THE FOOTBALL TEAM?
NO COMMENT. IT SUCKS.

THE FOOTBALL TEAM, UNFORTUNATELY, WAS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THEN AS NOW. ONE DIFFERENCE WAS THAT WE PLAYED BIGGER NAMES
SUCH AS STATE OR THE CITADEL. BASKETBALL WAS THE SPORT IN THE FIFTIES. DAVIDSON HAD A FANTASTIC TEAM THAT WON
SOME PRETTY TOUGH GAMES. ANOTHER DIFFERENCE WAS THE WILDKITTENS, THE EQUIVALENT OF A JUNIOR VARSITY. ALMOST EVERY SPORT HAD A
WILDKITTEN TEAM. ONE ISSUE DAVIDSONIANS WERE CONCERNED WITH IN THE FIFTIES WAS HIGHWAY DEATHS; SEVERAL STUDENTS WERE KILLED IN AUTOMOBILE
ACCIDENTS. DAVIDSON ADMINISTRATION BEGAN ITS HABIT OF TELLING STUDENTS THAT DORMS WOULD BE COMPLETED IN A WEEK WHEN REALITY PROVED
TO BE AT LEAST TWO MONTHS.

SENSELESSNESS OF WAR. STUDENTS ATTENDED A PROGRAM FEATURING FOLK SONGS AND SPEECHES BY PROFESSORS SUCH AS MAX POLLEY. THINGS HAD
BEGUN TO CHANGE IN OTHER WAYS AS WELL BY THE LATE 1960’S. THE SPENCER COMMISSION REPORT OF 1969 RECOMMENDED A
MOVE TOWARD COEDUCATION. THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED AN EXCHANGE PROGRAM WITH SEVERAL GIRLS’ SCHOOLS. ANOTHER PART OF THE SPENCER COMMISSION REPORT
EVALUATED DAVIDSON’S ATHLETIC POLICIES AND DEBATED THE POSSIBILITIES OF ADDING OR ELIMINATING SCHOLARSHIPS. IN MANY WAYS, THE DAY-TO-DAY LIFE OF
THE AVERAGE DAVIDSON STUDENT HAS CHANGED VERY LITTLE IN 20 YEARS. THE TYPICAL STUDENT USED TO HAVE DIFFICULTY FINDING A
PARKING SPACE BACK THEN. THE PHONE SYSTEM ELICITED COMPLAINTS. THE CAFETERIA FOOD WASN’T QUITE UP TO PAR WITH MOM’S. STUDENTS
HAD TO WORRY ABOUT DATES FOR MIDWINTERS. THEY SAT THROUGH DISAPPOINTING FOOTBALL GAMES. FRESHMEN HAD TRANSPORTATION PROBLEMS (ONE HALL BOUGHT
A CAR TO MAKE THEIR LIVES EASIER). STUDENTS IN THE 60’S PULLED ALL-NIGHTERS; THEY FOUGHT WITH THEIR ROOMMATES; THEY PLAYED
FLICKERBALL; THEY HUNG OUT WITH THEIR FRIENDS; THEY WORRIED ABOUT GRADES AND CAREERS AND LIVES; THEY LOVED DAVIDSON.

1980s, from Page 23
RETURNED TO CAMPUS AS A RESULT OF A ZONING ORDINANCE. SADLY, DAVIDSON EXPERIENCED THE LOSS OF FOUR EATING HOUSES: ATO,
ETC, EMANON, AND FANNIE & MABLE’S. THERE WAS, HOWEVER, THE FOUNDING OF A NEW HOUSE IN 1985. WHAT WAS DESCRIBED
IN THE JANUARY 25, 1985 ISSUE OF THE DAVIDSONIAN AS A “NEW WOMEN’S EATING HOUSE” LATER BECAME SPENCER WITH KUYKENDALL’S
APPROVAL ON FEBRUARY 7TH OF THAT YEAR. THE MOST SHOCKING COURT STORIES INVOLVED NATIONAL FRATERNITIES. KAPPA SIGMA AND SIGMA PHI
EPSILON WERE THE NEWSMAKERS IN THE 80’S. WITH THE ADDITION OF KAPPA SIG AND THE RETURN OF SIG EP, THE
COLLEGE HOLDS WITH 7 NATIONAL FRATERNITIES, 6 OF WHICH ARE ON CAMPUS. IN THE EARLY 80’S RELATIONS BETWEEN KAPPA ALPHA
(KA) AND THE BLACK STUDENT COALITION (BSC) WERE STRAINED DUE TO THE KA “OLD SOUTH” RITUAL, WHICH INVOLVED THE WEARING
OF CONFEDERATE UNIFORMS.Uniforms and parading while so dressed. The conflict resulted in the KA’s having their traditional weekend off campus
thereafter. In sports, there is perhaps only one story which will have any particularly dramatic effect upon life at Davidson,
and that is the Trustees’ decision to move the football program out of Division I and into Division III. This
is something any avid reader of The Davidsonian could have seen coming. In a May 1985 issue, an article by
then senior Dwane D. Wright entitled, “Four Years as a Football Player: No Hoopla, No Respect” appeared. In the article,
Wright complained about the lack of appreciation the team received.

The car was seen again during several robberies at Clemson on Friday, February 5. The owner of the car, a
Jennings Fields of Chamblee, Georgia, was arrested on Saturday. Neither officer, however, was equipped with handcuffs. Fields drew one officer’s
gun, fatally shot him, and escaped in the police car. The second officer, who was unarmed, followed in Fields’ car
but was shot several times. Fields was finally apprehended after being chased by over 25 cars and followed on foot
for over six miles. He was expected to be found guilty the following week.

In appreciation of Mr. Linker, students and faculty collected over $175. It was presented to Mr. Linker on Wednesday during
the Chapel Period.

By John Burns, adapted from a Feb. 12, 1954 article by Tom Warlick

The play was meant to go to Chris Heineman or Derek Rucker, two feisty point guards. With those two closely
guarded, Born, off a screen, came to the top of the key and fired. Nothing but net. Pandemonium ensued and
Davidson drew one officer’s gun, fatally shot him, and escaped in the police car. The second officer, who was unarmed,
followed in Fields’ car but was shot several times. Fields was finally apprehended after being chased by over 25 cars
and followed on foot for over six miles. He was expected to be found guilty the following week.

The Court of Control gradually associated with the uncontrollable downfall of the Court, accelerated by that well-known rebel, John. The
play was meant to go to Chris Heineman or Derek Rucker, two feisty point guards. With those two closely guarded,
Born, off a screen, came to the top of the key and fired. Nothing but net. Pandemonium ensued and Davidson
called time to set up the play. Now Gerry Born, a 6-7", 210-pounder that sort of reminds you of Jay
Schmitt, was used to playing a physical game under the boards. He had two runs of 41 and 37 yards.
Belton was named Southern Conference “Back of the Week” and McRee was awarded The Davidsonian’s “Wildcat of the Week” award.

The most spectacular play of the game came in the fourth quarter, as described by Davidsonian sportswriter Leon Howell: “Belton
eluded a host of pursuers, leaped high in the air, and hit (Don) Campbell 35 yards down the field, who
responded with a circus catch on the five.”

By John Burns

Born, off a screen, came to the top about the absence of “perks” from the Davidson program. The lack of
bags, sweats, and jackets as emblems of their team membership was an issue by which Wright was particularly offended. He
continues, in his article, to scold the lack of “respect” of the college for its football players, citing his high
school as a place where football players received their proper due. Wright claimed in the article that “one gets the
feeling that Davidson tolerates football but does not support it.”

In the 80’s Davidson—along with the nation—was formally introduced to yuppiedom and all that it entails. While politics were pretty
consistent, our musical tastes at Davidson have most certainly changed. The 900 Room has played host to all sorts of
bands from country rock to techno-pop. The early 80's, however, were perhaps the musical highlight of the decade. In 1980,
Davidson was privileged enough to host Marty Bear, whom his critics called “the voice of the 80's.” From the looks
of him, I think Marty was scheduled to do a guest spot or two on Knight Rider, and may even
have been up for a role in Grease II, as he truly seems the quintessential “actor/singer.” Other groups included R.E.M.
and the Bangles.

Davidson has changed significantly over the past decade, for better or worse. But our 150-year past, found in the form
of people, places, and ideals, lingers on. On the threshold of the 90’s, Davidson shows both a sense of history
and an ever-present ability to change its future.
