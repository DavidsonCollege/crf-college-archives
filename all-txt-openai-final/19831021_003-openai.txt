**Faculty To Review Credit Hours Guidelines**

By DAN VOORHIS

Davidson will take an important step toward the credit hours system when the Educational Policy Committee (EPC) distributes its guidelines
for conversion to the faculty next week. The report, to be presented before the full EPC for approval on Monday,
is the effort of an EPC subcommittee formed to design a workable conversion from the old system of course credit
to credit hours. After circulating among the professors, the report will be discussed at the faculty meeting on Nov. 8.

The EPC is the only committee developing the credit hours system. If the faculty approves the guidelines, the subcommittee must
then review all requests for more or fewer credit hours for a class. The College must work out a feasible
system by January if the College is to convert to semesters for the 1984-85 school year.

The EPC based its suggestions on responses solicited from department heads concerning the three major areas of the credit hours
problem. First, professors were asked to assign credit hours to each course in their departments. Second, each was asked how
many credit hours would fulfill major requirements. The third question involved what each thought should be the number of hours
necessary for graduation.

Most courses will meet on either Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for 50 minutes each or on Tuesday and Thursday for
75 minutes each. Since credit hours are based on the actual number of hours of instruction per week, called “contact
hours,” these courses would be worth three credit hours. Problems arise from classes such as the lab sciences or Humanities.
The general rule for lab sciences, including the physical sciences and psychology, is one credit hour for each three hours
of assigned lab per week. As a result, most lab sciences will be worth four hours while a few will
be five.

The Humanities program will continue to meet five days a week for 50 minutes, making it worth five credit hours.
The program’s scheduling raises a scheduling problem because it will take up the space of two classes and require students
to schedule classes around it. Language courses probably will not receive extra credit for lab work.

When considering the number of credit hours for major requirements, most departments will probably maintain the current 10-to-12 course load.
Subcommittee chairman Professor Merlyn Schuh said that a minor concentration might be necessary “to force students to take upper-level courses
in areas besides their majors.”

Another problem involves determining the number of credit hours required for graduation. Because general faculty sentiment is to remain at
36 classes, nine per year, science majors would end up taking a greater number of credit hours. The minimum number
of credit hours to graduate is 108. A science major completing 12 four-hour courses in addition to 24 regular courses
would finish with 120 hours. This equals three or four extra classes. Schuh admits in this problem that “the discrepancy
is unavoidable. Science will demand more semester hours for graduation.” A compromise between 108 and 120 hours will probably be
the final faculty position, according to subcommittee member Professor J. B. Stroud.

If approved by the entire faculty in their Nov. 8 meeting, the final report should end these conflicts. Sending the
suggestions out now is designed to draw out all conflicts and questions from the professors.

**CROP Walk Hopes To Raise $5000 For World Hunger**

By KELLY SUNDBERG

The Davidson - North Mecklenburg CROP Walk will take place Sunday, October 23 at 2:30 p.m. A Fun Run, also
held to benefit CROP, will start at 2 p.m., with registration at 1:30. Organizers expect 200 participants to raise around
$5,000 to support CROP’s hunger-fighting efforts all over the world. CROP Walk participants recruit sponsors who pledge to contribute a
certain amount for each kilometer the participant walks.This year’s ten-kilometer walk is routed through various Davidson neighborhoods, passing six churches
and local industries, according to Walk Coordinator junior Beth Maczka. The walk’s route has special benefits for Davidson students, Maczka
remarked: “It will give us a chance to realize where we’re living — so many students never see so many
parts of town.” This year’s walk is marked by increased cooperation among Davidson area churches, other community organizations, and college
groups. “This is an experimental year for the churches working together,” Maczka noted. “There is a lot of community interest
— scout troops and children from the community center will be walking and helping with the rest stops.” Maczka also
reported positive response from Patterson Court houses. Twenty-five percent of the money raised next Sunday will stay in Davidson, earmarked
for the Hot Meals Program, which provides a hot lunch daily for older persons regardless of income. Funds from the
CROP walk will permit this program to expand. The remainder of the money raised in Davidson will be administered by
CROP, the educational and fundraising arm of Church World Service, an organization of 31 Protestant and Orthodox groups working in
relief and development since 1946. Funds raised by CROP support hunger-fighting programs in over 70 countries on all continents. “We
could raise money in other ways,” Maczka said, “but walking is special. It ought to remind us of the people
who have to walk miles — for food or water, to the doctor or to school — every day.” Those
interested in joining the CROP walk should contact Beth Maczka at 892-6710.

Evacuation Plans Set In Case Of McGuire Disaster
By DAVID McGEE

The town of Davidson has a plan for the unthinkable. Because Davidson lies within ten miles of a nuclear power
plant, the state requires Davidson to have an emergency evacuation plan in case of an accident at the McGuire nuclear
power station on Lake Norman. The plan is a free-standing one, according to Mayor Nancy MacCormac, and could be used
for any emergency. Town, county, and state officials designed the plan to react to emergency reports from McGuire. The plant
has five levels of emergencies: Level 1 (an unusual event), Level 2 (alert), Level 3 (site emergency), and Level 4
(evacuation necessary). If an incident progresses to Level 3, the fire department will notify the town through a public address
system and instruct people to turn on their televisions and radios for additional information. The town’s schools, factories, and day
care center will also be contacted as well as the College, which has its own emergency plan. Before this stage,
though, town officials will establish a headquarters to carry out their pre-assigned duties. If evacuation is necessary, then students and
residents will receive instructions to proceed to holding centers in Troutman, 30 minutes north of Davidson. Town residents were informed
this year of the routes they are to take to the holding centers. For those who need transportation or other
help, three areas have been designated as waiting centers: the community center, Davidson Elementary School, and the Fine Arts Center
on campus. Vans and College Emergency Medical Technicians will be available there. “The plan assumes that emergencies will proceed slowly,”
MacCormac said. For example, it may take several days for an emergency to progress from Level 3 to 4. However,
MacCormac said, town officials will have greater difficulty putting the plan into operation if McGuire informs them of an emergency
already at Level 3 or 4. The plan was completed in September of 1980, and since then the public has
participated in one drill in 1981. A drill is scheduled in November, but the town has not received information on
its involvement in the drill. Most cities and towns nationwide have developed such plans as a result of the Three
Mile Island incident in 1979.
