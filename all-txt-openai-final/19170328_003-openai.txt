**The Davidsonian, March 28, 1917**

**Literary Societies Schedule**

Debate, Saturday night, March 31st:
- **Eumenean** — Affirmative: Jenkins, Liston, Orgain, and Patterson. Negative: Morton, McCloy, McCutcheon, and McGirt.
- **Philanthropic** — Affirmative: C. W. Worth, Bullock, Cumming, T. C. Stone, and Foscue. Negative: Fleming, McDonald, Roberts, and Boney.

Monday morning, April 2nd:
- **Eumenean** — Election of first term officers and Debating Council.
- **Philanthropic** — Declamations: Hari, Berryhill, McClure, Lacy, and W. F. Hall. Orations: Finley, Reese, and Mann.

In the debate last Saturday night in the Eu Society, the affirmative was upheld by Brown, Bellingrath, and F. M.
Mitchell. The negative was upheld by Harwood, Hobson, Hollandsworth, and Humphrey. The debate was more spirited than usual, yet, as
several of the speakers were appointed on short notice, it lacked preparation, which the Reviewer brought out in his criticism.

On Monday morning, Love gave a declamation, "The Farewell Address of Jefferson Davis in the Senate." Those giving orations were:
F. M. Mitchell, "The Submarine Nets;" D. V. Hudson, "A Startling Discovery;" S. R. Keesler, "The Military Camps;" A. Brown,
"Home Rule for Ireland."

In the Phi Society on last Saturday night, the regular weekly debate was held, the subject being, "Resolved, That the
United States should abandon the Monroe Doctrine." The affirmative was upheld by Murray, Robinson, Campbell, and Cumming, while the negative
was presented by W. C. Neel, H. T. Lilly, Mann, Ratchford, and R. H. Stone. The affirmative upheld their argument
on the grounds that the Monroe Doctrine is founded on false principles and has made South America unfriendly; it is
no longer necessary; and a Pan-American League would result in a better policy. The negative opposed them on the grounds
that changed conditions make the Monroe Doctrine as necessary as ever; the South American Republics are not yet able to
withstand European aggression; it has been the basis of our foreign relations; and entangling alliances should not be made.

On Monday morning, Murray gave an oration on "The Use of the Armored Tractor in Modern Warfare." Declamations were given
by Query on "Address to the Confederacy," and by Menzies on "The Leading Nation."

**Campusisms**

J. B. Daffin, '18, and J. T. Maddrey, '19, attended the Y. M. C. A. conference held at A. &
M. College, at Raleigh, March 23rd-25th.

The Glee Club and Orchestra left Monday to be gone until Thursday.

H. B. Fraser, '18, left Tuesday for his home in order that he might join in welcoming home from the
border Troop "B," Georgia Cavalry, of which his brother is captain.

R. W. Porter, ex-'17, spent Sunday on the Hill on his way from the border. He spoke of the good
times and fine experiences he had while in Texas.

R. H. Guerrant, ex-'17, was on the Hill last Friday morning. He is now with the American Steel Founders, of
Chicago, Ill.

**Hon. W. H. Taft Speaks to N.C. Peace Society**

Dr. Martin was in Greensboro, N. C., last Thursday as a delegate, appointed by Governor Bickett, to hear ex-President Taft
discuss the principles of the League to Enforce Peace, of which society Mr. Taft is President. Dr. Martin had the
pleasure of dining with Mr. Taft at the home of Mr. E. P. Wharton, the President of the North Carolina
Peace Society. Mr. Taft lived up to his reputation both as a genial gentleman and a most interesting platform speaker.
At the dinner, he talked delightfully of his past experiences as Governor of the Philippines, and of his work as
a conciliator in Cuba, as well as his present work as a professor at Yale University. His public address dealt
first with the present world situation and our relation thereto, and then with the League to Enforce Peace. He believes
we will have war and considers this a most serious and solemn time in our country's history. It is a
time when everyone should face the duties of the hour most seriously.

Mr. Taft believes in universal military training, both to ensure a reserve of trained men, which can be called on
when needed, thus preventing the necessity of using untrained bodies of men with resultant heavy slaughter, and to increase the
all-around manhood of our young men. The distinguished speaker was never more in earnest as when he spoke of the
lack of respect of the young men of our nation for constituted law and authority, and evidently viewed this and
the lack of patriotism and willingness to sacrifice for the government with alarm. His exposition of the League was clear
and convincing. "If," said he, "America takes the lead in this, it will be established after this war, but if
America does not, the other nations will not, probably cannot, because of mutual suspicion." The large hall was packed and
the great audience in hearty sympathy with the speaker.

**Professor Currie Speaks at Y. M. C. A. Meeting**

At the Y. M. C. A. meeting on last Thursday night, Prof. A. Currie was the speaker, the subject being
"The Plan of Salvation Viewed from a Human Standpoint." Professor Currie began by saying that the way of salvation was
a subject that we should not shrink from discussing or speaking to each other about because it vitally affects our
present life and immortal existence. The speaker next compared the way of salvation to a contract and defined the contract
as a mutual agreement between two competent persons, whether sealed by word or sign. Many examples were given of the
means by which a contract might be made and agreed to. The two kinds of contracts were emphasized—the bilateral and
the unilateral. In the bilateral, each party agrees to do something for the other. In the unilateral, one party promises
something to another as soon as the other has done a specific thing. God's plan of salvation, he pointed out,
was simply a unilateral contract in which God promises to give eternal life to any man as soon as he
shall believe on His Son. Ratified by the seal of God, there is no change in this contract. In closing,
Professor Currie urged the value and the necessity of every man accepting this contract which God offered by which we
might obtain eternal life.

Rev. W. L. Walker, pastor of the Presbyterian Church at Cornelius, will conduct the prayer meeting service of the local
church tonight.

COLLEGE RIFLE CLUB MEETS FOR ORGANIZATION

At a meeting Saturday afternoon of about one hundred and fifty members of the student body, together with a few
citizens of the town, in the moving picture building, the organization of a Davidson College Rifle Club was effected. Dr.
J. W. McConnell was present and presided over the meeting. B. D. Roddey was called on to state the object
of the meeting, and said that the club was in no sense to be a military organization, and was simply
to promote good marksmanship. It was emphasized that members of such a club would be in no way under obligation
to the government in case of war. Dr. McConnell also stated that there would be an organization of a Civilian’s
Rifle Club with about twenty-five members.

The students present decided to organize a College Club, and officers were elected as follows: President, A. C. Wood; Secretary,
B. D. Roddey; Treasurer, L. M. Currie; Captain, H. B. Fraser. The duties of the officers are to be the
same as for any other organization except that the captain is to have charge of the shooting and of the
general management of the range. The government is to furnish each five men a rifle and six hundred rounds of
ammunition, the privilege being given to secure further supplies at cost. It was announced that Captain Morrison, of Mooresville, would
coach the club and act as judge in the meets that would be held. It is not known definitely how
many men will join this club, but possibly a conservative estimate will be between fifty and seventy-five.

While as yet no definite arrangements have been made by the college for the return of Professor Fulbright next year,
it is to be hoped such plans can be completed. The need of the college students for assistance along lines
of public speaking has been more and more realized of late, and the increased efficiency of the students has justified
a further course in this work.

OUR CONTEMPORARIES.

The Old Gold and Black—On the 19th of March the Varsity nine of Wofford played its first game of the
season. It was a practice game, and Wofford won 7-0, but as frequent substitutions were made, each member of the
squad had a chance to play and show his ability.

The Cadet—In order to establish a company of cavalry at the V. M. I., a campaign is being waged to
raise the funds needed for the installation and upkeep of such an establishment. Every ex-cadet is urged to give to
the V. M. I. all that he earns on May 1st. The whole corps is quite enthusiastic over the prospects
and have adopted as their cavalry motto, “Blessed is he who ponies up.”

The Tiger—A banquet was tendered recently by the Aluminum Utensil Co. to all those students at Clemson College who had
sold their ware last summer or who intended to be salesmen this summer. The banquet was enjoyed by about twenty-nine
prospective salesmen.

The Florida Alligator—The subject, “Resolved, That immigration into the United States should be restricted by a literacy test,” has been
decided upon by the committees representing the Universities of Florida, South Carolina, and Tennessee as the subject for the triangular
debate in which the three schools will be represented. The debates will each be held on neutral ground on April
27th.

The Gamecock—Voluntary military training will be introduced at the fall session of 1917 at the University of South Carolina, having
been passed upon by the Board of Trustees at their meeting last week. All who are interested may join the
company, and it is expected that the United States government will detail an army officer for instruction duty.

The Crimson-White—The Jewish students of the University of Alabama have organized a local chapter of the National Menorah Society, founded
at Harvard ten years ago. The society will hold weekly meetings for the study of the ideals, history, etc. of
Judaism.

The Technique and Yellow Jacket—The Wesleyan Glee Club of Wesleyan College, Macon, gave a performance at the Tech Auditorium in
Atlanta last Friday night. The young ladies had arranged not only a most excellent and well-balanced program, but they are
most attractive as well as talented. (The cut of the Glee Club verifies the above statement).

The Spectator—The usual chapel exercises one day last week at the Industrial Institute and College of Mississippi were given over
to the Suffrage League in order that they might put some of their most important “planks” before the student body
and arouse enthusiasm and interest in this organization. The varied program and the speeches were enjoyed by all.

HIGH SCHOOL TRACK MEET HAS BEEN CALLED OFF

It is with much regret that the student body learns that the high schools of Western North Carolina will not
hold their annual meet at Davidson this year. Much interest was taken in the meet last year by the students
and all hoped it would be held again. It seems that these contests are under the supervision of a committee
at the University of North Carolina, and for some reason they have called off the meet in Western North Carolina.
