Beyond Birkenstock ... Looks Like It's Peek Time.

Ugh, the Birks feel like @#$%. Although we’d like to blame the Clinton administration (or should we say the “Rodham Administration?”) for our illness, in fact that shock has already passed (like the proverbial prune). As loyal Americans, we’re glad to give Slick Willey his day in court. No prejudgment or narrow-mindedness around here, boy. We gladly assume the media’s patina of OBJECTIVE JOURNALISM (yeah, and Dan Rather a whole bunch of promises during that thar’ onery campaign, kemosabie).

Referring to the Charlotte Observer, “The nation’s oldest civil rights group declared Tuesday that President Clinton must back up his promises to black Americans with billions of dollars in economic help for inner cities and civil rights laws.” Indeed, anyone given an iron-clad, no-doubt-about-it, Clinton guarantee can certainly expect that promise to be fulfilled. Maybe. Not. Folks, the man promised to do everything for everybody and throw in a billion dollars to boot. Sure, every voting minority group (as the gay rights activists are now finding out). ‘Course, if you’re a Haitian, don’t hasten to that leaky boat right away—there’s a cordon around the island to keep ya’ll folks from settin’ sail. Nothin’ personal, just that it would take five or six years for ya’ll to be able to pull a votin’ lever (which is just too late for “One Term” Willey). Stay home, sit back, and enjoy the American foreign policy that candidate Clinton labeled “cruel.”

Remember that little sign in Clinton’s office, “The economy, stupid!” Whatever happened to that, do you think? Was President Clinton just too busy worrying about Fleetwood Mac to dance with the date what brung him? The Birks wonder. We agree with the Urban League, that many more resources need to be devoted to the inner-cities. Who knows if President Clinton and Co-President Rodham Clinton will ever get around to those pesky economic and social issues. It’s soooo important that he jump right on the gays-in-military issue, right away. Meanwhile, Joe and Tawanna Taxpayer (you remember, the 47% of the voters who actually elected this goof) are wondering whatever happened to the middle-class tax cut they were promised. “Oh, but that’s a campaign promise,” our diligent liberal friends will respond. “Don’t measure him by his promises but by his actions.” Excuse us? Are you suggesting that fulfilling an oral commitment is less important than, say, honorable service while in office? For the amount of time you fools tortured George Bush on that “No New Taxes” awful. We now return you to your regularly scheduled political harangue.

Let’s review some news of the day, shall we? “Agent goes ape in gorilla suit, nabs suspects.” Big deal. “Crews search for ship.” Who cares. “Voters confused by new district lines.” Surprise—nobody ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public. Anything else? Well, there’s “Congress in uproar over gay issue.” That’s kinda interesting. Or how ‘bout, “Millionaires in the cabinet: Clinton 9, Reagan 7, Bush 6.” How about that? In an effort to make his cabinet look more like America, Bill Clinton has included nine millionaires (or, as they prefer to be called, the “economically unchallenged”).

Maybe just one more headline, OK? “Challenge issued to Clinton, blacks: Group wants promises kept, community to help itself.” Seems President Clinton made a whole bunch of promises during that thar’ onery campaign, kemosabie. Referring to the Charlotte Observer, “The nation’s oldest civil rights group declared Tuesday that President Clinton must back up his promises to black Americans with billions of dollars in economic help for inner cities and civil rights laws.” Indeed, anyone given an iron-clad, no-doubt-about-it, Clinton guarantee can certainly expect that promise to be fulfilled.

At Davidson, the cheerleaders take off their sweaters and people still don’t notice the cheerleaders. (Editor’s note—He’s kidding.) And they even give cheers like these:

CHEERLEADERS: One, we are the Wildcats. Two, a little bit louder now. Three, we still can’t hear you. Four, MORE! MORE! MORE! Wait... Hello?!! Is anyone conscious?

I didn’t think we fans were that bad, but a conversation I had with one of the cheerleaders the other day gave me a new perspective on the non-support matter:

CHEERLEADER: Do you know what’s the hardest thing for a cheerleader?
ME: The double flip somersault 360° supra-gymnastic gotta hurt split?
CHEERLEADER: No. To go out and cheer and people don’t respond.
ME: Oh.

Look, the cheerleaders work hard and so do the athletes, so the least we can do is cheer like the nutty, frenzied, irrational, childish, twisted, Biology/History majors we all are. I leave you with a quote from the same cheerleader: “People cheer only when the good plays happen. Maybe if people cheered some more in general, more good plays would happen.” Maybe so. At least we could try.

And to Eddie Yardumian: WE’RE NUMBER ONE! WE’RE NUMBER ONE! NYAH! NYAH! NYAH! NYAH! NYAH!

Community Should be Based on Individuals
Gullan Continued from page 7

Sensitivity training is not going to make Davidson a better place. It is silly to sit down and tell someone he must be sensitive to a particular black student because the student is black. What is desirable is to be respectful of that black student because he is an individual person to be judged on his personal worth. Davidson is defined by the character of its student body. In Ballard’s case, one bigot screwed up. Davidson is not an elitist institution, it is an exclusive one. On an individual level, nobody can ask for anything except to be judged, as Martin Luther King said, “by the content of their character, not the color of their skin.” You don’t pick your friends on any quota system. You hang out with the people you genuinely like. You earn grades based on your performance in the courses. The fraternities don’t have a chart saying what groups must be represented in their pledge class. It is all done naturally. It all just happens. It is natural to be color blind. I like to learn about my ancestors in Germany. You may enjoy learning about your ancestors in Ireland or Africa. It doesn’t matter. When we’re in class, we are Davidson College students and individuals, not Africans, Irish, or Germans. And student is a non-judgmental word. I wonder why there were no students in the cabinet.

Eating Together is Really, Really Nice
Shealy Continued from page 8

She goes to meals, not because of the food, but because they are her one opportunity to see all of her friends, no matter what their sex or social affiliation. Her experience sounds rather appealing when compared to the eating house members here. No matter how much you may like your little organization, seeing the same faces every time you go eat can become monotonous. Granted, under an alternative system house unity might suffer, but then again, people might start to regard house meetings and other functions as more important occasions because they would differ so much from the daily experience of eating that we experience now. Men’s and women’s groups might begin to attract only those who were truly committed to their houses because of the extra time they might require of them. Campus unity would climb dramatically as well (now that required chapel has been abolished, there is little left that brings us all together for any singular purpose). Because of its size, Davidson has an advantage over larger schools in that it could conceivably take on the task of feeding all of us. It just might be wise to make them do it. For me and my class, it is far too late to change what may be a flawed system, but opportunities perhaps remain for the rest of you.

Deidra’s Response
B&W Continued from page 8

The point is that we have to realize that people from different races have the same feelings and abilities as we do. We even put our pants on the same way, one leg at a time. You shouldn’t be interested in someone from a different race just because you think they’d be good in bed, or you’d get respect from your boys because she’s on your arm. It’s not all about that. However, if there is an interracial couple who is serious about their relationship, they should be supported and not shunned.
