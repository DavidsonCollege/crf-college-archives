(Continued from page 1)

lotte to Davidson and requested that if there was anything that Charlotte could do for Davidson, please to make it known to him. Mr. Bryan had motored up from Charlotte for a couple of hours to see the campus, and as he had an appointment to speak in Charlotte at 11 o'clock on behalf of the Fourth Liberty Loan, he was unable to stay long. A number of the town people and faculty were present to hear the statesman, who was given a rousing cheer by the student soldiers as he departed.

Every week some of us are hearing from the fellows who are in the camps or overseas. The Davidsonian is vitally interested in all Davidson alumni who are “With the Colors,” and it proposes to publish from week to week interesting extracts from the letters of these alumni. Fellows, The Davidsonian is your paper, to be kept up to its motto, “Good, Clean and Snappy.” You can help make it such by handing in such extracts to the editor or any of the staff members.

The following lines are from a letter written October 2 by William Love, ex-’20, who enlisted in May in the Marines and is now “over there.” They remind us of William’s humor of old:

“We sailed from a certain port in the U. S. and after a certain number of days we arrived at a certain French port and thence to a certain camp where we now are. France is a pretty nice place when the sun shines, but when it rains you get lost in the mud. This is the dry season now, it rains only six days in the week. In the rainy season it rains eight days in the week.”

Private William Love, Company A, 13th Reg., U. S. Marine Corps, American Expeditionary Forces, France.

Mrs. Spink was ushered by Jane into a friend’s house for an afternoon call, and, as she stood in the hall a voice called softly down from somewhere above: “Jane, if that’s Mrs. Spink, I’m not at home.” The caller lifted her head sharply. “It is Mrs. Spink,” she shouted, “and she’s mighty glad to hear it.”—Ex.
