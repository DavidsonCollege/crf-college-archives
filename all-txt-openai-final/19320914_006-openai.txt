THE PILLAGE OF PARIS
"Nature in the Raw” — after the great French artist Luminais... inspired by the savage fierceness of untamed Norsemen in the ruthless capture of Paris — 845 A. D.

We buy the finest, the very finest tobaccos in all the world—but that does not explain why folks everywhere regard Lucky Strike as the mildest cigarette. The fact is, we never overlook the truth that ‘Nature in the Raw is Seldom Mild’—so raw tobaccos have...No place in cigarettes. They are not present in Luckies... the mildest cigarette you ever smoked. These fine tobaccos, after proper aging and mellowing, are then given the benefit of that Lucky Strike purifying process, described by the words—"It's toasted." That’s why folks in every city, town, and hamlet say that Luckies are such mild cigarettes.

"It's toasted"
That package of mild Luckies

"If a man write a better book, preach a better sermon, or make a better mouse-trap than his neighbor, tho he build his house in the woods, the world will make a beaten path to his door." —RALPH WALDO EMERSON.

Does not this explain the world-wide acceptance and approval of Lucky Strike?
