**Cats lose first Southern Conference game**

By PERRY MATHEWES

Wednesday, the Davidson basketball team lost its first Southern Conference game, 69-67, at UT-Chattanooga, dropping their overall record to 5-6.

Before the Christmas break, Davidson traveled to Princeton and came away with a 58-56 overtime victory. The game started slowly with neither team gaining control until the 7:54 mark in the first half. Junior guard Derek Rucker hit a three-pointer and then a six-foot jumper to give the Cats a seven-point lead, 18-11. Princeton managed to cut the lead by five, sending Davidson into the locker room with a 22-20 advantage.

Princeton opened the second half with a three-pointer to take the lead. They led by as much as eight points, but Davidson was able to keep close. Then the excitement started. With 33 seconds left in the game, Princeton hit two free throws to build their lead to six, 50-44. Senior guard Chris Heineman hit a three-pointer with 18 seconds showing on the clock. Davidson immediately called a timeout. After the timeout, Princeton was unable to get the ball in within five seconds and turned the ball over to Davidson. Two seconds later, Heineman hit another three-pointer to knot the score at 50. The game went into overtime when Princeton failed to score on their last possession.

Davidson took a 54-52 lead in overtime when freshman center Jay Schmitt hit a jumper with 3:08 left. Princeton was able to tie the game 56-56 with 22 seconds left, but junior forward Jeff Himes made a layup with seven seconds left in the game to give Davidson the victory. Davidson had three players who scored in double figures: Himes with 19, Rucker with 15, and Heineman with 14. Himes and senior forward Ace Tanner both led the team with eight rebounds.

On Dec. 20, Davidson demolished Holy Cross, 83-68, in the Charlotte Coliseum. Rucker opened the game with a three-pointer, then Holy Cross scored six straight points before Heineman could respond with a three-pointer of his own. Then Rucker made a fast-break layup after a long Tanner pass to give Davidson a lead they never lost. Davidson slowly extended its lead throughout the half. When junior guard Dean Keener hit a three-pointer with one second left in the half, Davidson had its biggest lead and the halftime score of 37-24.

The second half belonged to Davidson as Holy Cross could never get closer than eight, and Davidson led by as much as 16. Himes led the team in scoring and rebounding with 29 points and nine boards. Rucker had 17 points, and junior center Mike Gynn came off the bench with 10.

On Dec. 27, Davidson traveled to Bowling Green and lost a tough game, 75-71. The game was close most of the way, with neither team able to open up a big lead. With 33 seconds left in the game, Keener hit two free throws to give Davidson a 71-70 lead. However, Bowling Green hit a three-pointer with five seconds left to take the lead. They then hit two free throws to seal the game. Rucker was the team’s leading scorer with 21, Himes had 12, and Tanner had 10. Tanner led the team with eight rebounds.

Last Saturday, Davidson lost 63-56 at South Carolina. The Cats did not play very well in the first half as South Carolina led most of the way, building up a lead of as much as 10 points before heading into the locker room on the better end of a 27-21 score. Davidson stormed out in the second half behind the scoring of Himes and Rucker to tie the score at 33-33 with 16:03 to play in the game. Davidson tied the score six times after that but could never take the lead before South Carolina gradually pulled away for the win. Heineman led the team with 15 points while Tanner and Rucker had 12 and 10 points respectively. Himes had 11 rebounds.

In the UT-Chattanooga game, the Mocs jumped out to an early 7-2 lead, but the Cats came back to take a 12-11 lead. The lead seesawed between the two teams for several minutes before Rucker scored seven straight points to end the first half and give Davidson a halftime lead of 31-27. In the second half, UT-C kept the score close, tying the game three times before taking the lead, 51-50, with 7:15 left. UT-C could not get a bigger lead than four points but held on for the win. Rucker had 25 points for the game.and Heineman pumped in 13. Unfortunately, foul trouble kept a hot Tanner on the bench too much, but he still scored 11. What really hurt the Cats, however, was that Himes was held to only four points. Davidson travels to The Citadel on Saturday and to Western Carolina on Monday in two more conference games.

Now that the new year is upon us, it is time to look back on the games of the past year and choose a hero as The Davidsonian Sportsman of the Year. Sports Illustrated has dibs on Joe Paterno, so we will leave him out of consideration and give someone else a chance. Since The Davidsonian is an essentially local paper with an admittedly small national circulation, it is only right that some mention should be given to area competitors for this coveted honor.

What catalogue of 1986 sports heroes would be complete without Gerry Born? His 25-foot buzzer-beater in the Southern Conference Tournament championship game turned what would have been a good Wildcat basketball season into the best one in the last 16 years. The other Davidson candidate is senior Steve Condon. His all-star pitching for the Wildcat baseball team added up to scouts in the stands and wins on the field as the Cats tallied 21 victories.

On the national collegiate level, the top performers of 1986 were Vinny Testaverde and Pervis Ellison. Bosworth’s big mouth aside, Vinny was the best college football player of the year. Okay, he did not look fantastic in the Fiesta Bowl. Technically, however, that game does not count as it was played in 1987, and who could look good when Paterno had what seemed like 15 linebackers on the field all at the same time? Never Nervous Pervis, as they call him, put his freshman body on the court and consistently outplayed senior big men en route to copping the national basketball title for Louisville.

In professional basketball, there is really no contest. Year after year, the Boston Celtics win the championship. And whom do you think of when you think of the Celts? Larry Bird, of course. He’s a cut above the rest.

Pro football did not have any dominant people in 1986 to my way of thinking. Marino was great, but he didn’t win a lot. McMahon and Tomczak and Fuller and Flutie weren’t great, but they sure did win. I guess my candidate for Sportsman of the Year from the ranks of pro football would have to be Buddy Ryan because I heard his name more than anyone else’s. Every sportswriter in the land seemed to be vying for the dubious honor of quoting him most.

Major League baseball had its share of heroes in 1986. Roger Clemens and his 24 wins definitely deserve mention. Don Mattingly established himself as the best player in the known universe. But the true hero of the year was Bill Buckner. He played all year on a pair of legs you wouldn’t wish on your worst enemy and still managed to drive in 100 runs.

In pro boxing, the choice was easy: Mike Tyson. He reduced the “sweet science” to its simplest element; he hit his opponents so hard that they couldn’t stand up anymore. Bruce Baumgartner also deserves mention. As an amateur heavyweight wrestler, he dominated his sport. He beat all comers and won the Goodwill Games and the world championship.

All of the above were fine representatives of their sports in 1986. A case could be made for the selection of any of them as Sportsman of the Year. But, hey, I’m making the decisions here and I’m not picking them. No, my choice for this glorious honor doesn’t play basketball, football, or baseball. He is not young, or fast, or particularly strong. He is, however, the Lord of Georgian Links, the crown prince of the Augusta National, the Golden Bear himself — Jack Nicklaus.

Nicklaus’ charging victory on the final day of the Masters was the most exciting event in sports last year. He hit drives that he should have been incapable of hitting and sank putts that no one should make. Golf fans all over the world embraced one another and wept openly — or at least shook hands and grinned stupidly — when Jack donned the green jacket. His victory was the best of sport’s clichés — the old veteran beats the young lions — and therefore he is The Davidsonian Sportsman of the Year.
