### ATC Allotting Next Year's Budget

The Activities Tax Council (ATC) met Wednesday to hear budget requests from the organizations which receive their funding from the
council. They are expected to announce their final approvals sometime in the next few days.

Despite requests from the Davidsonian, Quips & Cranks, Hobart Park, SGA, and other organizations for budget increases next year, Business
Manager Bob Currie said that the total amount of allocations will not increase.

The Activities Tax is paid by students in the form of a $45 fee in their tuition, and this fee
has not gone up since last year. Therefore, there will not be any more money this year to distribute among
the organizations, according to Currie.

There will be some changes in the distribution of funds, however. Two organizations previously funded by the ATC will not
receive any money this year. The Women’s Center will become a Union committee next year, and the student carrier current
radio station, WDSR, is no longer in operation. These two organizations combined received approximately $1750 last year.

Davidsonian editor Stewart Cauley is requesting $6,000 next year, a $3,000 increase over the paper’s 1981-82 budget. “Last year’s budget
would carry us through the end of March,” said Cauley. “We also need $1,000 for equipment; we don’t have any
cameras right now.” Cauley also noted that weekly newspapers at colleges the same size as Davidson have higher budgets. Middlebury’s
newspaper runs on a budget of $30,000 a year.

The SGA also receives funding from the ATC. President Tim Johnston said that this year's proposal was for $400 more
than last year, up from $5,900 to $6,300, but he added that after talking to the Council he did not
expect to get the full amount. He cited an expanded program next year as the reason for the increase. “We're
planning two rather large career symposiums next year instead of one,” Johnston said. “We’re also planning a number of student/faculty
socials, and two trustee dinners instead of one.”

Increased printing costs have put a particular strain on the college’s publications. Hobart Park editor Dave Banks said that this
year’s second issue will be considerably smaller than the first because of lack of funds. He said that he turned
away about 60% of his submissions and that next year (unless funding is increased), he will have to turn away
as much as 70%. “The only way to cut expenses is to cut pages, and that means that only a
handful of people can be represented,” he said. His proposal was for $3,650 as opposed to $3,000 last year.

Quips & Cranks has also requested more money for the coming year. Co-editor Jim Reese said that increased printing costs,
plus the need for office supplies and better facilities, has driven up their needs considerably. He added that this year’s
book will be similar in size and scope to last year's but is costing them more. They are also asking
for a salary for the editors. The proposed budget for this year was $27,400 as opposed to approximately $19,000 last
year, according to Reese.
