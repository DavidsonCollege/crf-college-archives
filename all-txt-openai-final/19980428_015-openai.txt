A 4-3 conference record was good enough for a #3 seed for the women’s tennis team going into the conference tournament. Though one place behind Chattanooga in the conference standings, the Wildcats received the #3 seed and avoided a first-round meeting with conference leader Georgia Southern.

This paired the ‘Cats up against #6 UNC-Greensboro. The Spartans, who finished .500 in conference play in the regular season, upset Davidson 6-3 in March. The team went into the tournament knowing that the first round would be more than a formality.

They were right. The teams played a nine-point format, with one point given to the winner of each doubles match. The ‘Cats jumped out to an early lead with singles victories from Dana Casner, Kristen Koenig, and Amber Bradford.

The Spartans were not out yet. They took the last two of the last three singles spots to make the score 4-2. UNCG proceeded to give the ‘Cats a good scare by winning the #2 and #3 doubles matches to even the score at four apiece. The match and the right to move onto the semifinals hinged on the #1 singles match.

Casner and Koenig, who finished the regular season 7-8 in doubles play, fought the Spartans’ doubles team in a tense match and went on to win the match 8-6. This gave Davidson the win and the right to play the winner of Furman and Wofford.

Furman, the #2 seed in the tournament, had little trouble with the Terriers in the quarterfinals. They dropped only one match in a 5-1 victory.

The Paladins defeated Davidson early in March in a fairly lopsided 6-3 match. Once again, the ‘Cats went into the match hoping to avenge a loss. This time it was not meant to be. Koenig and Bradford won their matches at the #2 and #3 singles spots. Both rebounded from a first-set loss to take the next two. Bradford’s match was a marathon, finishing 5-7, 7-6, 6-4. Koenig’s was much shorter. After a 1-6 loss in the first set, she was totally in control, giving up a combined four games in the last two sets.

Casner lost the first set of her match in three tie-breakers and was not able to rebound. Her match finished 7-5, 6-1 in favor of Furman’s Meredith Moore, who went on to be named SoCon Freshman-of-the-Year in addition to earning All-Conference team honors.

In addition to their win at #1, the Paladins swept the last three singles spots to give them four points in the match. That clinched a victory for Furman, and the doubles matches were not completed.

The surprise of the tournament was UT-Chattanooga, who defeated #1 seed Georgia Southern 5-2 in the semifinals. Georgia Southern had finished the regular season with a perfect conference mark and had won all but two matches by at least three points.

Furman went on to the finals to defeat Cinderella-story UT-Chattanooga by a score of 4-1. Furman’s Moore was named to the All-Conference team, while her teammate Emelie Isaksson earned Tournament MVP honors. Despite their semifinal loss, two players made the All-Conference singles team, and two of the three All-Conference doubles teams were from Georgia Southern as well.

Dana Casner received her third All-Conference selection in as many seasons as a Wildcat. Also receiving a SoCon award was Amber Bradford, who was honored with the Sportsmanship Award. Bradford became the third Wildcat to win the award in the past four seasons.

Senior Lynne Shore captained the team to a third-place Southern Conference finish this year.
