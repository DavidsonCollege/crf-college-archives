**Tennis Coach Frank wins 400th**

Jeff Frank isn't just another ordinary guy -- he's the head men's tennis coach and he has just notched his
400th and 401st wins of his career. With a 5-2 win Saturday morning over Charleston Southern, the Wildcats beat what
Frank called "a real good team." The win came in Frank's second try last week for the milestone win. On
Monday, Davidson faced off against defending Southern Conference champions Georgia Southern, but fell 5-2. After topping Charleston Southern Saturday, Frank
and his Wildcats beat Belmont Abbey for win number 401.

Monday against Georgia Southern, freshmen Jon Pastel and Ted Kaplan both logged outstanding performances at the number two and three
singles positions. They dominated against two of the best players in the conference at their position. But GSU took some
close matches for the win.

Saturday morning, Davidson opened against Charleston Southern with excellent doubles play to capture the doubles point. The team then played
strong singles to secure the big win. The celebration did not last long since the Wildcats had to take the
court against Belmont Abbey later that afternoon. Belmont Abbey played surprisingly well in the doubles, winning at the number one
position. Davidson was able to pull out close matches at the other two doubles positions to come away with the
doubles point. After suffering losses at the one and two singles positions, the Wildcats definitely needed a spark. It was
provided by junior Bill Mitchem who was making his singles debut. Mitchem played exceptionally well to win at number three
singles. Davidson was able to take the remaining singles matches to win 5-2.

Davidson next plays today at 2 p.m. against Wofford. In his 23rd season at Davidson, Frank is still just as
enthused about coaching tennis as when he started. "I still really enjoy it," he said. "The highlight for me is
the kids at Davidson... College athletics are not as great in some areas any-

**Senior led Wildcats handle UNCC**

In their last game against county rival UNCC, the rugby team’s seniors went into the match with a mission: to
defeat UNCC one last time and keep Davidson undefeated on the season. Senior captain Simon Priestley helped lead the charge,
often times shouting for higher intensity. At one point, he even challenged the defending players to tackle him. Priestley’s call
was answered, and the seniors completed their mission, beating the 49ers 17-10 in the first game and 12-7 in the
second.

But it wasn’t that easy. In usual fashion, UNCC fielded a strong team and took a commanding 10-0 lead at
halftime in the first game. After senior Tom Shelburne’s motivational halftime speech, Davidson played the best second half of its
season. Shortly after the beginning of the second half, Priestley ran into the try zone for five points and then
converted the kick-after. Sean Callahan, a newcomer to the squad, scored the second try in fine stride, and Priestley converted
the kick-after again. A penalty kick worth three points ended Davidson’s 17-point halftime performance.

The second game wasn’t as intense, given Davidson’s fatigue, but with senior Jeremy Potter’s help, Davidson was able to pull
away for the win. His try near the end of the game secured the victory. Throughout the day, every Davidson
player gave his heart, but seniors like Shelburne, Potter, Priestley, Callahan, and John Walsh carried the team in fitting form.

Baseballs left Wildcat Park in a hurry this week.Two games against two Atlantic Coast Conference teams, fans saw 14 home
runs. Tuesday, Davidson lost 9-7 to N.C. State, a team ranked as high as 18th in some polls. But Wednesday,
the Wildcats more than redeemed themselves, beating Wake Forest 9-8, a regular foe that Davidson had not beaten in 19
games over seven years and one that had beaten Davidson 19-1 earlier this season. With two wins this weekend at
East Tennessee State, Coach Dick Cooke reached the one hundred win mark in his fifth season at Davidson.

The Wildcats (10-14, 6-6 in the Southern Conference) started out hot against N.C. State and held a 7-3 lead going
into the seventh inning behind the pitching of Brian Cole and the hitting of Gus Quattlebaum. But Cole began to
tire in the seventh, and the bullpen was unable to stop a rally by N.C. State that yielded six runs.
After the comeback, Mills Ariail shut out the Wolfpack to close the game, but Davidson’s hot bats had done all
they could against such a tough team. Despite the loss, Coach Dick Cooke was not disappointed with his team’s performance,
saying he was pleased to be “playing with one of the best.”

Wednesday, the story was very similar. Going into the seventh inning against Wake Forest, the Wildcats had built a 9-2
lead. Again they were hitting well behind a favorable wind in what Cooke calls “a friendly offensive park.” Quattlebaum had
two home runs to cap off a great two days of hitting for him. In the two games, he was
a combined 5 for 8 at the plate with three home runs. Davidson never trailed in the game, starting off
the scoring in the first inning when Jeff Andrews hit a two-run home run. In the third, Michael New nailed
another two-run shot for a 5-1 lead, after Quattlebaum opened the inning with a solo home run. Rhett Ingerick picked
up two RBIs in the fifth, scoring Brian Penny and Drew Van Culin with a double. Mark Reilly then brought
Ingerick home with a single. Quattlebaum made the score 9-2 in the sixth with his second homer of the game.

The Wildcats then had a scare in the seventh, the same inning which proved deadly the day before. Jonathan Coulombe
had been pitching very well for six innings, but Wake Forest began to rally. This time, though, Davidson “didn’t let
it get out of control,” said Cooke. After five Deacon runs, the Cats clung to just a two-run lead. Wake
Forest threatened again in the ninth, but Cooke sent in one of his aces, Chris Pollard, who made short order
of the Deacons. He shut down the last three batters to finish the game. Afterwards, Cooke said, “It was a
great win to beat an ACC team.”

At times this season they’ve had hitting and pitching slumps, but that was not so this week. Pollard said, “For
the first time this season, we had both things together at once.” The Wildcats hope to keep the combination going
against Southern Conference competition and move up from the middle of the standings. Pollard sees the team’s good performances against
these two ACC teams as a momentum booster, but his coach has a different opinion. In a game where, according
to Cooke, “one pitcher on the mound can make a huge difference,” he worries more about complacency. He saw his
team get swept last year one weekend after defeating #1-ranked Georgia Tech.
