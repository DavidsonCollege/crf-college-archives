16 THE DAVIDSONIAN CAMPUS LIVING MONDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 1991

- Campus Quote of the Week:
"They [Davidson students] are more conformist—intellectual conformists. They sometimes lack that edge, they lack that intellectual curiosity, or desire to
find out something new... At Harvard, Williams, and Washington I never encountered a group of students so consistently able as
Davidson students are, but at the same time I encountered many students who were intellectually more interesting and more stimulating
than many Davidson students..."
- Robert C. Williams, Dean of Faculty
