MRS. FRANCESKA K. LAWSON TO SING HERE ON SATURDAY

Lovers of good music have a very delightful treat in store for them on Saturday evening, when Mrs. Franceska Kaspar

and offers a program for the evening's entertainment which should appeal to the tastes of all. The concert will begin
promptly at 7:15, and the movies will be postponed until the concert is over. The admission price will be 35

DR. ROBERT H. H. GOHEEN TO BE HERE FOR TWO DAYS

Dr. Robert H. H. Goheen will be the speaker at the Y. M. C. A. service next Sunday evening. Dr.
Goheen has been for a number of years in medical work in India and is spending his vacation speaking to
American colleges on the opportunities that await surgeons and doctors in the foreign field. We have not had a medical
missionary as our guest for two or three years and the coming of Dr. Goheen is all the more welcomed.
In addition to the “Y” service, Dr. Goheen will speak to the Medical Club, to the classes in Biology and
Zoology, and to other groups. He has made a special study of Parasitology and Diseases of the Tropics; and his
talks on these subjects have been most interesting and enlightening. During his “off hours” Dr. Goheen will hold personal conferences
with any medical students who wish to see him with regard to preparation or plans for the future.

WALLACE REID COMING HERE IN “WORLD CHAMPION” MOVIE

Wallace Reid figures in the “World’s Champion,” another of Cecil B. DeMille’s productions, Saturday, the 18th. As a man and
an athlete, all sport lovers may be assured of some real action when Wally and his big fist and ready
smile get busy.

MINISTERIAL BAND HEAR DR. VANDER MEULEN ON TOLERANCE

At their meeting last Sunday afternoon, the Ministerial Band was especially favored by a talk from Dr. Vander Meulen. An
unusually large number of members, besides many visitors, were present. Dr. Vander Meulen spoke to the “embryo preachers,” as he
called them, upon the types of temperaments with which they would come in contact in their religious work. The talk
was one that should prove helpful and broadening to the members of the band in their contact with human nature.
Dr. Vander Meulen spoke of the Greek classification of temperament: the phlegmatic, the melancholic, the choleric, and the sanguine. He
then gave the more modern classification: the intellectual, the emotional, and the practical, and spoke of these as exhibited in
different religious types. Each of these types, he said, has its place in the church. The intellectual class includes the
thinkers and theologians of the church, who reason out and classify the great religious truths. It is they who defend
the faith against the attacks of heretics and agnostics. The emotional class includes the believers in heart-religion, with such evangelists
as Moody and Wesley. Here are included, also, the great hymn writers, David among the great list. The practical class
includes those who believe in practical religion and go about Christian work in a practical way. All of these types
have their places. Only when they deny the existence of any other kind of religion except their own, are they
harmful. Dr. Vander Meulen said that any minister would necessarily come into contact with all of these different types and
it was up to him to develop himself so as to be able to sympathize and deal with each of
these classes according to its particular needs.

C. E. TRAINING CLASS IS TO HAVE DEPUTATION WORK

At the regular meeting of the Christian Endeavor Training Class last week, it was decided to start a series of
deputations similar to those now sent out by other religious organizations on the hill. The purpose of these deputations is
to promote the work of the various young people’s societies in and around Davidson. The leader of the Christian Endeavor
Training Class appointed a committee to look after the deputation work, with J. L. McLean as its chairman. Since the
Training Class was organized last fall, it has discussed the general problems confronting our missionaries in foreign fields. Since Christmas,
they have organized a class in Expert Endeavor which has been doing splendid work. The deputations are merely another phase
of the work being done by the Training Class and it is hoped that this new lineof effort will prove
useful to those societies and churches which can be reached.

Y. M. C. A. DEPUTATIONS BEING PLANNED FOR SPRING

The Y. M. C. A. committee on deputations has planned an extensive program for its department this spring. Harold McKeithan
is the head of this department and has arranged several trips, especially to high schools and prep schools nearby. The
first deputation will go to Kings Mountain on next weekend, March 19-21. They will talk to the high school boys
there on several subjects. This group will consist of J. P. Price, Edgar Houghton, G. B. Sorrells, A. M. Hillhouse,
and Doc LaFar. Last year a committee went to Shelby and its work was so successful that they have asked
for another. J. P. Price, O. J. Allison, and Harold McKeithan will compose this “follow-up” group. Westminster prep school has
also asked for another deputation, which will be sent later in the spring.

Since Christmas, each month two men have gone down to speak to the Charlotte Hi-Y. These trips will be continued
throughout the spring. McKeithan is in correspondence with Monroe, Rock Hill, Oak Ridge, and Lexington, concerning trips for the spring.
The deputations have been unusually successful this year. Their chief aim is to help the high school boys meet problems
which college men have already met and to give some added incentives to the high school boys to come to
college.

“SATURDAY NIGHT” A STRONG CECIL B. DEMILLE PICTURE

“Saturday Night” was good. DeMille knows how to get and hold your interest and his cast can keep it. The
story goes—

A rich society girl is about to announce her engagement to an equally rich and well-known man of the higher
strata. Her jealousy of her fiancé's attention to a working girl whom he has helped out of a trying position
starts things “hummin’.” Her own chauffeur is attractive and she marries him after seeing his bravery in saving her life
on a railroad trestle. The man is all too glad to be free, and to marry the little poor girl.
The poor girl with no society manners and more love for “chewing gum and hot dogs than for operas and
olives,” finds a hopeless situation among the “four hundred” despite her adoring husband. Cooking for a man whose main object
in eating is to eat and that in the most convenient and quickest way brings out all the drudgery where
the rich girl had merely looked for joy. So, as “water and oil will not mix,” the water, as it
always does, sought its own level. The poor girl and the chauffeur find happiness together and years later the broken
society engagement mends itself.
