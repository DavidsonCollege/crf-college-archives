Elvis Re-releases Go Back To True Rock And Roll

By MATT MORRIS

Musically speaking, 1985 will be remembered as the year of the reissue. So far we’ve had 12 incredible tracks of
North Carolina rock on Steve Berger’s compilation album Tobacco-A-Go-Go, four Velvet Underground records including the great Lost Velvet’s LP, VU,
and now RCA has kindly brought three of Elvis’ early LPs back into existence to celebrate the “King’s” 50th birthday.
And what an event it is... Each album captured the “true” Elvis sound, pre-1960, pre-army, pre-Hollywood, pre-Christian; in other words
pure rock ’n’ roll, done the way only a true “king” could.

The earliest reissue, Elvis Presley, dating from 1956, contains simply some of the best Western music there is. “Money Honey”
jams with Elvis pushing his vocal cords (and we can imagine, his thighs) to an animalistic limit. No one can
slink through “Blue Suede Shoes” better than Elvis—not even Carl Perkins' version can capture Elvis’ effortless, utterly simple, powerfully honest
approach. With a basic backing of bass, guitar, drums and of course Elvis, great music erupts from this LP. No
matter what mood you're in, Elvis Presley will seize your emotions. With the sexually potent, hypnotic sound of Elvis bellowing
through the speakers as if from some deep dark 1956 well, “I'll Never Let You Go,” another outstanding cut on
this masterly LP, seems almost psychedelic; dreamlike rock that makes you sway in your shoes and in your head.

This first LP would be tough for anyone to beat (the Clash tried to mimic its power if only through
a cover imitation) but Elvis’ second LP Elvis 1958, while not the completely flawless experience that Elvis Presley is, contains
several memorable tunes. “Paralyzed,” a rocker of the first degree, will leave you gasping. With the simple “boy/girl oh, why
don’t you like me,” etc. glide, Elvis creates a sound that rocks and rolls, all in an unpretentious way. Elvis
probably didn’t even know what he was doing himself, but non-self-consciousness makes for great art and that’s what Elvis’ music
(from this period anyway) is.

Of course there’s an occasional bug in every stew and Elvis 1958 is no exception. “When My Blue Moon Turns
to Gold Again” wallows in Elvis’ bellowing and hints at his later blunted sound. But hey, Elvis 1958 gives you
a real goody worth the price of admission. The king’s first recording ever, “Old Shep,” is a funny, touching tale
in the “Old Yeller” tradition where, in first person, Elvis relates to us the tragic tale of the death of
his true friend, his dog Old Shep. On some strange level (don’t ask me how) Elvis makes me get a
little teary-eyed when he sings “If dogs have a heaven/Then I know/Old Shep has a wonderful home.”

Golden Hits, a great greatest collection, contains all the golden oldies like “Hound Dog,” “All Shook Up,” “Heartbreak Hotel,” “Jailhouse
Rock,” and the haunting “Love Me Tender” that really raked in the bucks, and they truly deserved all their rich
rewards. If you've ever been a skeptic towards Elvis and his explosive talent, check out these LPs—blast from the 50s—and
see what you think. Oh, and be sure to thank the guys at RCA as you leave.
