Silent Partner

Silent Partner, a band from Athens, Ga., will provide entertainment in the 900 Room this coming Friday and Saturday nights.

Each member writes, sings, plays at least two instruments, and contributes to the arrangement of the music.

Members are Kemp Jones, Don Porterfield, David James, and Ben Bickerstaff.

The band performs acoustic music and original rock. Their harmonizing is reminiscent of Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young, and the
Eagles.

If you appreciate smooth vocal harmony, electric guitar, and good music, don’t miss Silent Partner.

Top Hats and Cat Tales

It's that time of year again—time for TOP HATS & CAT TALES, Davidson's annual talent show. This year’s show promises
to be a classic. Not only is there big prize money, but the winner also gets a chance to perform
at Carowinds.

TOP HATS & CAT TALES will kick off Davidson’s big Homecoming weekend on October 4. However, before there can be
a great show, there have to be great acts and great MCs! Tryouts for all acts and for MCs will
be held in the 900 Room on September 24 from 2:30-5:00 and 6:30-8:00, and on September 26 from 2:30-5:00. Sign
up at the Union Desk to reserve a time slot.

The selection committee will be looking for acts that reflect both talent and Davidson spirit and humor. So eating houses,
hall groups, and talented individuals, get your acts together and come to the tryouts.

Two $50 prizes will be awarded to the winners of the large and small group categories, but if you're not
interested in prize money, walk-ons, fillers, and a couple of witty MCs are also desperately needed.

The talent show itself will be Thursday, October 4 at 8:00 in Love Auditorium. The $1.00 donation at the door
will go to the Davidson program in Kenya. Don't miss it!
