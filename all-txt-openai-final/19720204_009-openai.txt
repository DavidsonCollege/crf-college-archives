**Hobbs, Saylor Near Marks As Swimmers Close Season**

By JIM HANNA

The last two dual meets of the Davidson swimming team's season will be highlighted by tough battles, both for the team and for the two top Wildcat swimmers. Coach Tom Stevens' squad, which is 4-3 so far, will face two tough opponents in the next week, while a couple of Stevens' charges will be attempting to set some school records.

Sophomore Jack Hobbs and freshman Rusty Saylor are both within striking distance of college records in their respective events. Hobbs is close to two marks. His best effort in the 200-yard backstroke, a 2:17.5 clocking, is exactly one second off the school record. In last Tuesday's meet against Belmont Abbey, which the 'Cats won 75-35, Hobbs came within nine-tenths of a second of the Davidson best in the 200-yard individual medley. His time was 2:14.2.

Saylor, who swims in the 200-yard breaststroke event, has clocked a 2:33 this season. The school record for his event is 2:31. “Both boys can break those records,” said Stevens, “they’ve just got to work real hard for it in the next week or so.”

The two potential record-holders and their teammates will have their work cut out for them when they meet Appalachian State on Tuesday and Augusta College on Friday. The ’Cats have already lost to Augusta College this year, and the Appalachian squad beat Davidson last year.

“The Augusta team beat Georgia Tech this year, so they are a lot tougher than we expected,” said Stevens. “The Appalachian team beat us last year, and as far as I know they aren’t any worse than they were last year. So both meets will be very tough,” he said.

One of Hobbs’ two defeats this season came against the Augusta backstroke swimmer, so the impetus for a new Davidson record is there. “I keep getting closer and closer to those records,” said Hobbs after his performance against Belmont Abbey. “I think I can get them before the season’s over.”

Stevens pointed out that this season may be Hobbs’ last chance to set the records, since the sophomore is considering going abroad during his junior year. “But there have been records broken every year that I’ve been here, and even with the small squad we have now, I think we'll erase some of those old names and times before the season is over,” he said.

Stevens also mentioned two other freshmen for their potential as swimmers. “John Scholer and Peter Alford should turn out to be real good swimmers for us,” said Stevens. “John is a real hard worker and a very coachable swimmer, and his times have been improving a lot. I expected great things from Peter, but he’s had trouble with the flu this season, and he hasn't really done much. But he will do real well if he ever gets healthy,” said Stevens.

The outstanding depth on this year’s squad, “I've felt that Joe and Eric can score 20 anytime, and we have eight guys who can go out and hit double figures, so that takes up the slack,” he commented. He added that he doesn't think that his replacement, T. J. Pecorak, feels much pressure now as a starter. “T. J. has been playing about 20 minutes a game anyway, so he is used to the situations.”

Falconi pointed to Hunt and Simpson as the men to stop against Furman, adding that “we'll want to beat them because they beat us here, and not too many people do that.”

The major factors for the Wildcats’ success appear to be coach Terry Holland's increased skill at substituting for tiring players, and better use of multiple defenses. The full-court pressure allows the team speed to become more effective, resulting in increased opponents’ turnovers. As Falconi remarked, the sophomores seem to be playing with more confidence now, and this is a good sign as the conference play thickens. So, after the contest with The Citadel, it’s on to the rematch with Furman. John Falconi will be on the sidelines, but Joe Williams will be shaking in his boots.

**’Cat Runners Open With VMI Relays**

Davidson's indoor track team opens its season Monday as the Wildcats take on VMI and Furman in Lexington, Va. Saturday, six of Coach Heath Whittle’s thinclads will participate in the VMI Relays, one of the...most prestigious indoor events in the South. Sprinter Tom Richardson, hurdler Ray Swettenburg, and a distance medley relay team of Mark Connors, Rick Mullen, Howard Boyd, and Ricky Bell are the tracksters who will run in the relays. Richardson, who placed in the 60-yard dash in last year’s relays, and Swettenburg, fourth in the 70-yard high hurdles, both loom as strong threats this year. The freshman-dominated distance medley quartet will have its work cut out for it against the likes of Tennessee, William & Mary, Georgia Tech, West Virginia, Duke, and North Carolina. In Monday’s meet, Whittle expects to have a full squad of 18 set to compete. Richardson will run the 60- and 220-yard dashes and legs on the 440- and mile relay teams. Swettenburg will participate in the hurdles, 440 relay, high jump, and triple jump. Other Wildcats who should do well include Steve Shankweiler in the shot, Bell in the mile, and freshmen Connors and Dave Paco in the 440. Furman looms as the favorite in the tri-meet as the perennially-strong Paladins figure to clean up in the distance events. VMI and Davidson should wage a close fight for second. The Keydets have a well-balanced team, but do not have as many outstanding individuals as the Wildcats. The addition of a strong crop of freshmen this year adds depth and talent to the Whittlemen, who are expecting one of their best seasons in recent years. After the meets this weekend, the thinclads will have only one more indoor meet, the Southern Conference at Lexington. They open the outdoor season March 18.
