IMAC has changed! We couldn’t wait any longer. Along with North Carolina drinking laws and the new Patterson Court policy
on social control, Davidson Intramurals have changed!

First of all, we are more organized. We have elected officers — Jill Boyette, president; Bryan Feigenbaum, vice-president; and Mark
Crowther, secretary-treasurer. Our Intramural Athletic Council consists of these officers and representatives from each fraternity and eating house, independents, and
freshmen. We have re-written our constitution and renewed our commitment to IMAC.

In return, we hope that you renew your interest in IMAC. Even though a majority of students do participate in
intramurals, we want even more participation and a greater variety of students. Hopefully your enthusiasm will enable us to expand
our program. IMAC hopes to sponsor competition in other areas such as tennis, swimming, track, and possibly ultimate frisbee and
sailing. Of course, we all know that nothing in life is free (especially if it is fun), so some entry
fees will be required.

The increasing costs of equipment and improvements have forced us to make another change. Entry fees for the major IMAC
sports — flickerball, basketball, indoor soccer, softball, street hockey, and volleyball — are non-refundable. This money will be used to
supplement the budget and to purchase t-shirts for championship teams (sorry, no national TV coverage yet).

The 1986 Davidson Flickerball season will begin on Sunday, Sept. 28. Rosters will be available at the Athletic Office on
Sept. 12 and they are due on Sept. 19 at 4 p.m. Keep an eye out for IMAC flyers.
