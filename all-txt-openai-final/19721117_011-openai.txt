Captain Ted Severn, Davidson's new swimming coach, is looking for "big things to happen" for Davidson swimming. Severn has helped out with the swim team as an assistant coach. With the former swim coach, Tom, on sabbatical this year, Severn has moved up to the head position. Comparing past teams with this year's team, Severn commented, "There is a world of difference."

Sailors End Season With USC Regatta
By JOHN McELEEN
Staff Writer

The Davidson sailing team will compete in the last regatta of the fall season this weekend at the University of South Carolina. This is the second regatta since the conference championships. Last week, the team placed fourth out of seven in a regatta at the College of Charleston, outranking both USC and Old Dominion. The Citadel handily won that competition, taking first place in the regatta, and first place skipper awards in both the A and B divisions. Prior to the Charleston race, the Cats sailed in the conference championships at the University of Tennessee. After an unusually good showing in the Duke race the week before, the Cats had high hopes.
```Their hopes up for the championship, according to team commodore Daryl Douglas. Douglas skippered “Thistles” in the alternating as crew in the A division with Lee Doug Covar and in the B division. Mark Leonard manned the “Juniors” with Jim Stephenson as his crew. Though Daryl had captured the lead after the first two races, “Tennessee's home team advantage began to pay off,” commented Daryl. The Cats finished sixth of the seven teams. “The wind was fluky,” Daryl continued, “and the Tennessee team as well as the Citadel's, who sent their team up a day early to practice, knew where you could expect a little puff.”

“This home team advantage, coupled with a race committee that set up arbitrary courses regardless of the wind,” claimed Daryl, were two factors partially responsible for Davidson's last place showing. The UT and The Citadel teams exercised their familiarity with the boats and lake to its fullest, capturing first and second places respectively, according to Douglas.
