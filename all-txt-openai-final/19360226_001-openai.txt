CONGRESSMAN J. J. McSWAIN PAYS VISIT TO R. O. T. C. UNIT

Also Addresses Engineers Band of the Charlotte National Guard

PRAISES R. O. T. C. MEN

Points Out the Peril of “Reds” In Colleges

Representative John J. McSwain, of South Carolina, addressed the junior and senior officers of the Davidson R. O. T. C.
unit at the armory Tuesday afternoon, Feb. 18. The Congressman was on the campus en route from Washington to Charlotte,
where he addressed the officers present at the banquet given by the O. R. C. of this section.

At the banquet given by the Engineers’ Band of the Charlotte National Guard at the Charlotte Armory on the same
evening, two methods were presented whereby the United States can avoid being drawn into a European conflict: (1) stay out
of foreign affairs, and (2) maintain a strong defense for army and navy. These national principles were expounded by General
McClosky Parker of the Circuit Court of Appeals, as well as by Representative McSwain, the principal speaker of the occasion.

In addition to a number of R. O. T. C. officers, other Davidson men attending the function were Colonel Rhett,
Major Seifert, Major Cochran, Lieutenant Lamont, Lieutenant Jim Batte, Dr. Howard Arbuckle, and Dr. T. W. Lingle. Representative McSwain, a

Board Denies Student Plea

Changes Effected in Various Departments By Trustees’ Meeting

At the recent meeting of the Board of Trustees of Davidson College, the petition of the student body to bring
dances to the Davidson Campus was denied. This petition was presented to the board at their last meeting held in
February and was referred to a committee at that time and rejected.

The trustees elected a Director of Athletics and a Librarian and also made definite plans for the celebration of the
Centennial. Norman W. Shepard, director of athletics at Randolph-Macon College, and an alumnus of Davidson and the University of North
Carolina, was chosen director of athletics to succeed Captain Norton G. Pritchett who resigned last spring. Chalmers Davidson, a graduate
of the class of ‘28 and present student at the University of Chicago Library School, was elected Librarian to succeed
Miss Cornelia Shaw who has served as college librarian for 30 years. Miss Shaw, following a year’s leave of absence,
will serve as librarian-emeritus of Davidson.

In his report to the trustees, Dr. Lingle pointed out the needs of the college. The needs he listed were
an infirmary, library, field house, church, social center, science building, dormitory, and an addition to the stadium. The trustees granted
Professor L. B. Schenck of the Department of Bible a year's leave of absence to continue his graduate study at
Yale University. The return to Davidson of Professor A. V. Goldiere, of the French Department, and Professor J. T. Kimbrough,
of the Mathematics Department, was announced. These men have been studying in the graduate schools of Chicago and Yale.

Emphasizing the growing interest in music at Davidson, the board authorized the selection of an assistant in the Department of
Music. The meeting closed with 35 trustees entertained with a luncheon in the Banquet Hall. The next meeting will be
May 30.

TRUSTEES NAME DAVIDSON TO BE HEAD

FRESHMAN FRANCHISE IS BEING CONSIDERED

At a meeting of the Student Body held after chapel Friday morning, the following proposed amendment was read by President
Carleton Chapman:

“The Freshman class shall be entitled to a vote in the spring elections of each year under the following conditions:
1 — Each Freshman vote shall count one half that of an upperclassman’s vote.
2 — Each Freshman ballot shall be printed with the words “Freshman Ballot” on it, so that there will be
no mistake and no Freshman vote shall count over its prescribed value.

This project, if passed, will go into effect with the class of 1940.” The voting on this amendment will be
held on Monday, March 2. It was approved by the Student Council two weeks ago.

REV. JOHNSON SPEAKS ABOUT SCANDINAVIANS

Winston-Salem Minister Talks On His Native Country, Norway

On Monday evening at 7:30, Reverend Herbert Johnson, of Winston-Salem’s Moravian Church, spoke to students and faculty in the auditorium
on the subject of the Scandinavian countries, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden.

Dr. T. W. Lingle, in introducing Dr. Johnson, mentioned that he was of Norwegian parentage and not Swedish, as was
stated in The Davidsonian last week. He told how the minister had been educated at the Moravian College in Bethlehem,
Pa., after being brought to this country in his youth, and had filled pastorates in Wisconsin and, now, North Carolina.

The speaker indicated that he would divide his talk along three lines—the land, the people, and the language. All should
endeavor to know at least one foreign language; and to know the land and the people, he agreed, will foster
good will. First, he drew attention to the fact that Hammerfest, near which city his father was born, is much
milder as regards its climate than Wisconsin, 20 degrees farther south, that in fact, the climate of Hammerfest is milder
than the climate around Oslo, the capital. The reason for this is that the Gulf Stream curves in toward the
land near the southern coast. Another striking feature is the great length—meandered length, it is called—of the actual coastline of
Norway, in contrast to the mere north-south length, the former being 12,000 miles against the latter’s 1,100. Such a fact,
surprising as it looks in round numbers, is not hard to understand when we look carefully at the map of
Norway and see all the deep fjords.

Scandinavians are Caucasians, members of the white race, and resent being classed with Finlanders or Laplanders, who are of the
Mongolian race. The so-called ‘Finlanders’ in the Northwest are really Scandinavians, Dr. Johnson said. For centuries these people have been
lovers of land—a statement which looks queer, he admitted, since we invariably think of Scan- (Continued on Page 6)

Davidson Trumpeters Play In Lenoir Band

Six musicians from the Davidson Band went to Lenoir last Monday night to serve as guest artists in a concert
by the Lenoir Band. The six all played trumpets. The group included Mr. Pfohl, A. Moreland Cunningham, Rex Beach, T.
J. MacGill, R. O. Christman, and R. N. Baker. The Davidson Band participated in DeHardis’ number, “Universal Judgment,” which has
many difficult trumpet fanfares.

LIBRARIAN

Miss Shaw to Act as Librarian Emeritus After Year’s Leave

IS DAVIDSON ALUMNUS

Chalmers Davidson Has Master’s Degree

Chalmers Davidson, a Davidson graduate of the class of 1928, was elected librarian and associate professor of bibliographical history by
the trustees at their semi-annual meeting. Davidson received his Master’s degree at Harvard University, and has completed his residence and
other requirements, with the exception of his thesis and final examination, for the Doctor’s degree at the same institution. By
June, 1935, Davidson was admitted to the graduate library school of the University of Chicago. By the summer quarter of
1936, he will have completed four quarters of work in the general field of college and university library administration.

Miss Cornelia Shaw, who has been librarian since 1907, will serve as librarian emeritus after a year’s leave of absence.
Miss Julia Johnston will continue in the capacity of assistant librarian.

The resolution of the trustees was expressed as follows: “That Miss Cornelia Shaw be elected librarian emeritus with a year’s
leave of absence at her present salary, and that the trustees, through their secretary, express to Miss Shaw their appreciation
for her many years of devoted service to Davidson College.” The trustees expressed their appreciation by a unanimous rising vote.

Miss Cornelia Shaw was secretary to the president until 1907, when she was named librarian. “The college is indebted to
her monumental work ‘Davidson College’ and her efficiency in building up the library to its present status,” said Dr. Walter
L. Lingle. Prof. Samuel E. Morrison, of the Harvard history department, said the following of Davidson: “His personality is charming,
his character is unexceptionable, he likes people, and is pleasant to have about.”

Singers Give Concert Here

The Siberian Singers, under the direction of Nicholas Vasilieff, presented a varied and very interesting program before a large and
enthusiastic audience here last night. The singers offered a program of seventeen selections. The program was divided into four sections;
in the first half of the program, the singers rendered music from the liturgy of the old Russian Church, followed
by folk songs. In these two sections of the program, the singers were attired in the 17th Century Moscow Cathedral
robes.

After the intermission, the Siberian Singers appeared in the national costume of old Russia. The singers first presented some selections
from opera, and the fourth and final section was given over to the passionate Gypsy folk songs. There were four
selections which in particular met the approval of the audience. “Lord, Have Mercy,” a hymn from the Russian church, and
the phrase which the Russians repeat forty times at Vespers on Good Friday, was the best received among the religious
selections. The diminuendo of the voices suggested the ceremonial lowering of the Cross, then came the “Laughing Polka,” a folk
song popular even until today. It is the most popular dance song for the younger people in the small villages
and in the rural districts. Then the widely known and ever popular “Song of India,” attracted special attention. This music
and song is about the Phoenix (Continued on Page 6)

FRANK S. BARR TO DELIVER AN ADDRESS HERE NEXT TUESDAY

At the University of Virginia

WAS RHODES SCHOLAR

Speaker Edits “Virginia Quarterly Review”

Professor Frank Stringfellow Barr, Rhodes Scholar, Phi Beta Kappa, and member of Who's Who InAmerica, will lecture here in Chambers
Auditorium, Tuesday evening, March 3, at seven-thirty P.M. While attending the University of Virginia, Professor Barr was a good friend
of Dr. Shewmake, alumni professor of English here at Davidson. Dr. Shewmake said that his friend, Mr. Barr, was regarded
by his university mates as a young man of exceptional brilliance. Even then he was remarkably well informed in the
field of modern literature and showed unusual critical insight in whatever he said or wrote. Professor Barr was familiarly known
in student days as “Winkie.” Later, when he had completed his graduate work and had become a member of the
faculty of the University of Virginia, he was a valuable member of the staff of the “Virginia Quarterly Review,” a
nationally circulated and highly regarded literary magazine published by the University. Upon the resignation of the editor, Dr. James Southall
Wilson, Professor Barr was chosen to succeed him. Under his guidance, the “Review” has continued to occupy a high place
among American literary periodicals. Professor Barr studied at Tulane University, the University of Virginia, Oxford, University of Paris, and the
University of Ghent in Belgium. At present, he is professor of Modern European History at the University of Virginia.

SHEPARD ACCEPTS POSITION AS NEW ATHLETIC DIRECTOR

DEBATERS WIN OPENING MEET AGAINST W. & L.
Boggs, Port, and Harlan Begin Southern Trip After Victory

Wade Boggs and Tyler Port, who left yesterday on a tour of Southern Universities, defeated a debating team from Washington
and Lee last week by a 2-1 decision of the judges, Ed Markham and Jay Sorc. Washington and Lee debaters
met the South Carolina team at Watts. The debate's question was “Resolved, that Congress should be permitted by a two-thirds
majority to override any five-four decision of the Supreme Court declaring a law of Congress unconstitutional.” Davidson upheld the affirmative.
Paul Harlan, the third member of the southern team, is an alternate debater and accompanied Port on their trip. This
afternoon the team will meet the University of Florida in a radio debate which will be aired over station WRUF
in Gainesville, Florida at two o'clock. In this debate, Davidson will uphold the affirmative of the aforementioned question. On February
29, they will take the negative of this question with the University of Miami. It will be held in the
Open Air Park of Miami, Florida, and will be heard through an amplifier. The southern team will meet Emory University
on March 5 in the fifth debate of the trip. The question in this case will be slightly altered to
read: “Resolved, that Congress should be permitted by a two-thirds majority to override ANY DECISION of the Supreme Court declaring
a law of Congress unconstitutional.” On this occasion, Davidson will take the negative side. On March 10, the western team,
Wilbur Edwards and Harold Supy, will begin their trip.

Thompson to Hold Vespers
Dr. William Paliaterro Thompson, professor of religious education at the Union Theological Seminary, has been secured for the Vespers on
March 1. Dr. Thompson graduated from Davidson in 1905 and from the Seminary in 1909. He is a member of
Omicron Delta Kappa, Phi Beta Kappa, and Kappa Sigma. He is also editor-in-chief of the “Union Seminary Review.”

If you are a member of the Faculty being finger-printed at the local police headquarters, do not conclude that the
G-men are on your trail. Several of the Faculty were in service during the World War and are now being
finger-printed to enable them to draw their bonus. Col. Rhett was in regular service, so he is ineligible for an
adjusted compensation certificate. Major Cochran was a lieutenant in wartime and draws no bonus as the Major does. Mrs. Seifert,
at no one rank above captain, is eligible. Participants include Seifert, who was an army nurse in Bordeaux during the
war, Prof. Lilly, who served overseas in the hospital corps, and Prof. Goldiere, who was in the Navy. Coach Foreman
was an officer in the 81st Division. Prof. Watts was in the intelligence service in France. Members of the Faculty
Finger-Printed By Police Dr. T. W. Lingle, Prof. Porter, and Prof. Blythe were overseas with the Y. M. C. A.
but draw no bonus. Dr. Lingle was for several months under fire near Verdun with French troops. Prof. Porter was
with Hindu troops near Marseilles, and his knowledge of Hindu was valuable in that role. Dr. McConnell was in the
service for over two years but draws very little bonus as he was made Lt. Col. Prof. Hood served in
the Psychological section of the Medical Corps. Mr. Hengeveld was with the Marines during wartime but never went overseas. Among
the younger professors in S. A. T. C. service were Prof. Mebane, Prof. Thies, and Prof. Fulcher.

NEW DIRECTOR
Norman W. Shepard, who will leave Randolph-Macon College to guide Wildcat athletics. He has wired his acceptance of the offer
made to him by the Board of Trustees last week.
