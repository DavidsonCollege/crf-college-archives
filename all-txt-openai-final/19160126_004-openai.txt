4 PRELIMINARIES HELD FOR INTERCOLLEGIATE DEBATES

Last night the preliminaries of the inter-collegiate debates were held in both society halls. The question debated was: “Resolved, That
the Government of Great Britain is more Democratic than the Government of the United States.” In the Eumenean Society, Edgerton,
Chambliss, and Patton upheld the affirmative, and Woods, J. R., Scott, Allen, and Smith, F. H., upheld the negative. In
the Philanthropic Society, Ratchford, Neal, and Thames upheld the affirmative, and McLeod, Ormand, Shaw, and Cumming the negative. Each speaker
was allowed twelve minutes for both speeches. Drs. Richards, Harding, and Lingle acted as judges in the Eu, and Drs.
Arbuckle, J. L., and J. M. Douglas in the Phi. The four men chosen in each society will debate in
Shearer Hall on February 12. The question at that time will be the one used in the Davidson-Erskine debate.

DAVIDSON MEN IN “WHO'S WHO IN AMERICA”

Davidson men in the 1915 issue of “Who's Who In America” are: Baker, A. M.; Baker, J. D.; Banks, A.
P.; Boyd, J. E.; Bryan, W. S. P.; Dawson, Edgar; Douglas, D. M.; Faison, J. M.; Fraser, W. B.; Glenn,
R. B.; Graves, N. Z.; Harper, G. W. F.; Hill, D. H.; Holt, L. S.; Jennings, W. B.; Lingle, W.

Withers, W. A. Of the men recorded, 11,034 are reported as having attended college. (Only 8,529 are graduates). The U.
S. report for 1914 gives 569 schools that rank as colleges, giving the bachelor’s degree. This would make an average
of 19% per institution, while Davidson has 31.

WORK ON ANNUAL WELL UNDER WAY

The editors and manager of the Annual report that work is progressing rapidly. Mr. Monse was on the Hill Monday
finishing the photographic work. The art staff has been increased, and this year’s “Quips and Cranks” should be one of
the best in the history of the publication. It is urged that all students and others who desire a copy
subscribe as soon as possible.

THE “1916” GIFT

The class of 1916 will present the college with a drinking fountain, which will be placed at the “old college
well.” The class numerals will be glazed on this fountain, and it will stand as a memorial to the class
of “1916.” It cannot be stated just when this gift will be presented but will be installed in the near
future.

The Davidson-Erskine debate will be held on April 7, at Winthrop College, Rock Hill, S. C. The question debated will
be: “Resolved, That the President’s Ship Purchase Bill should be passed by Congress.”

The Y. M. C. A. meeting tomorrow night will be addressed by L. A. Mullen. His subject will be, “The
College Man and His Friendships,” showing the importance of college ties.

J. M. McBryde has been elected president of the Ministerial Band to succeed J. G. Patton, who has resigned. The
hour of meeting has been changed from 6:15 to 4:30.

COME IN, BOYS.This is the place to get Good Apples, for the receipts have amounted to less than $25, leaving
a deficit too large to be made up by the gain from trips. Davidson’s isolated location from the other State
colleges is a handicap in basketball and heretofore has prevented games from being scheduled with them. This year every college
in the State except one is played twice, and it is hoped that the interest of the students will be
aroused.

Special attention given to “Feeds.” Your trade is appreciated.
