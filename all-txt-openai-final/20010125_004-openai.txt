From page 1:

Organized streaking on Davidson’s campus occurred back in 1974. According to the March 15, 1974 Davidsonian, a group of 15 men from 3rd Cannon Hall, not fraternity brothers, streaked across Davidson’s campus. Individual streakers were not uncommon, but streaking in groups, a growing trend among colleges, was new at Davidson. A few days after the group decided to streak, the Presbyterian Church sent out a memo to its college affiliates. It stated, “We not only encourage but we strongly urge [the administration] to take steps and measures necessary to stop streaking on our campuses.” The statute did not stop streaking at Davidson, and the tradition of fraternity pledges running through women’s eating lines continued.

According to former Dean of Students Will Terry, the issue of streaking did not concern his office. He served as Dean of Students until 1994. “We had no great complaints about it. We didn’t think it was a big deal at this point.” At this point in Davidson history, streaking was not a common practice among fraternity houses. In fact, Dean Terry said that he “never thought of it as a self-selection matter.” He never thought of it as a ritual. “I thought of it as a bunch of crazy people.” Dean Tom Shandley began his job in 1994 and does not remember streaking as a Court-wide activity then. “It was sporadic groups running naked; it was not done by all [pledges].” However, in recent years, Dean Shandley notes that the scope of streaking escalated consistently until it took on the appearance of an obligation. There was fear that the ritual...

Patterson Court welcomes new members

Despite a handful of unwelcome visitors — bad weather, new regulations, and national media attention — Patterson Court sprang to life for Self-Selection 2001, as 279 newcomers became part of eating houses and fraternities. This weekend, 188 women self-selected, showing an increase from 181 last year. Five upperclasswomen and 183 first-years joined eating houses, representing 87% of 2004 women. Warner Hall, Rusk, and Connor were tied with 44 new first-year members apiece; Turner welcomed 43, and CoHo 14 (6 men, 8 women). 75% of women got into their first-choice eating house.

Among fraternities, 83 freshmen (37% of 2004 men) and 8 upperclassmen pledged; this is a slight drop from last year’s total of 106. Kappa Alpha (KA) led the pack with 20 new members; close behind were Kappa Sigma with 17 and Sigma Phi Epsilon with 16. 13 members of Phi Delta Theta and 11 new Pi Kappa Alphas (PiKA) also pledged; Phi Gamma Delta (Fiji) and Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE) rounded off the group with 7 newcomers apiece. According to Patterson Court Advisor Craig Rinker, only a handful of students were disqualified for academic reasons.

All potential Patterson Court members were required to attend the first Lifestyles Speaking Series presentation, given by Judge Mitch Crane on January 18. Judge Crane discussed “Risk Management in the Real World,” dealing with the hazards of drinking, hazing, and other potentially dangerous behaviors. The women began the weekend at 5:00 am on Friday, when eating house members ran screaming through the dorms to claim their new members — much to the consternation of the male residents. (The men of Second Rich retaliated by pouring water onto an unsuspecting group of Connor women.) New members marched, pajama-clad, down to the Court to receive t-shirts, eat breakfast, and get to know each other. Some houses showered other gifts upon their new members. Connor house gave each woman a CD. “It was a good mix, fun to get ready to,” enthused new member Annelle Kallman ’04.

Every eating house on the Court hosted some kind of party on Friday night; as the evening progressed, most celebrants gravitated towards Turner and Warner Hall. New eating house members were drenched with shaving cream and water despite the chilly weather. To combat the cold, RLO staff members set up a coffee-and-doughnuts table, which Rinker called “a way to give back to Patterson Court and all the people having fun.” Dean of Residence Life Kurt Holmes called it “our version of a Patterson Court Roadside Reststop” and said the table went through more than 800 doughnuts and 20 gallons of hot chocolate. Friday also marked the first year...The traditional Self-Selection streak was forbidden by the PCC and college administration. Over Christmas break, this controversy attracted attention from newspapers such as The New York Times and The Arizona Republic. Eating houses warned their members that reporters might be present on the Court to observe Self-Selection. Most fraternities chose instead to send pledges and older members through the eating houses in boxers, briefs, or thongs.

On Saturday, the eating houses hosted sisterhoods, designed for new members to get to know one another. Rusk women got together for dancing. Connor House members told stories. Turner’s planned scavenger hunt was canceled due to the cold weather, and Warner Hall’s new members shared embarrassing moments. Kappa Sig and Phi Delt were the main centers of activity on Saturday night. Both fraternities held dance parties.

Unfortunately, Self-Selection Weekend was not without a few mishaps. At least two students made trips to the hospital after over-consuming alcohol, and a fire engine showed up at the sophomore apartments after the fire alarm was pulled. However, nothing could completely dampen the celebratory mood on the court. Most newcomers and previous Patterson Court members felt the weekend was a success. “It was a great way to kick off the new year,” said new Connor member Megan Kota '04.

Now, streaking joins a long list of rituals and activities that must be excluded from pledging activities. According to a report in 1961, a number of pledge activities were eliminated, such as “Hell week hazing,” forced eating, and parlor games. Other fraternities chose to stop paddling, required “stud,” and “hell week,” or calisthenics.

Despite the controversy that surrounded the Self-Selection night, many students still had a wonderful time. Director of Campus Safety Sam McKelvey reported that there were no major incidents the night of Self-Selection, and that the night was comparable to previous years. “We were not expecting any major problems,” reported Mr. McKelvey. “If someone were to have been streaking, they would have been referred to the Dean of Students office for adjudication.”

Many of the pledges and new eating house members thought the night was fun, with many claiming it was the most exciting night they experienced at Davidson. Andrew Walker '04, a PiKA pledge, said that the night “was very fun, one of the best. It would have been more fun if the pledges had run naked.” George Barrett '04, another PiKA pledge, said that “most of the guys wanted to run,” and that there was no pressure from the fraternity to do so. William Wood '04, a KA pledge, agreed that there was no pressure to run. Overall, he said that the ban on nude streaking “didn’t really change anything.”

Marsh said she was glad they did not run naked. “They had to be more creative [with their clothing]. If they were naked, it would have shock value; but with something on, it was more fun.” She reiterated, though, that the run was only part of the night. “I didn’t expect it to get so dirty,” said Mary Ellen Reed '04, a new Warner Hall House member. “[The guys] were funny, but kinda gross, but everybody had a good time.”

Dean Shandley agreed that the ban on nudity did not compromise the experience for the freshman pledges and eating house members. “I am very proud of our students,” he said.
