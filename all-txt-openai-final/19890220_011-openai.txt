The Davidsonian
Monday, February 20, 1989

Some...

some (did I ever leave with you) thing

in weary dusk unseeing eye wide

gaze up through need -- i too seek

your warm sleeping form

mere glow cast by city’s greyness

i breathe you (in) your scent secure

touching through bare moments of softly us
only searching some attempted refugees

ran common ground from chaos

oh, you’d ask but what i barely held

some strength of desperate me you’d guessed
listen, we’d be i said and meant

but our little time to rest -- now

some (i did ever love with you) thing
missing --

—Peter Tavernise, ’90

And dread:

those doe eyes darted

from train decks to ticket blocks
insectoid mouth aflutter,

“Don’t worry,”

With a dumb show shoulder shirk

Pulling brown brows up

receding on puppet twine

You assumed a dough hue

Pasted thick and vague

As an ink blur

Muffled as murmurs into death tubes.

You twist to the southbound’s scream
As light in needles like iron burned.
That smile silhouetted

scatters in shards at my feet.

Weighted like a baby

With sandbullets slung from the neck
I bend to gather the pieces.
