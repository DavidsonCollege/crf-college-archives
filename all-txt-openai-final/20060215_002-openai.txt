Luce Scholarship finalist Lucy Marcil ’06 will travel to Washington, D.C. tomorrow for her final round of interviews. Marcil will
learn whether or not she received the scholarship in late February or early March. The Luce Scholars Program grants internships
and stipends to 15 Americans under 30 to live and work in Asia for one year.

“It’s a program that’s looking for people who have no experience [with] Asia, who haven’t studied it, who haven’t been
there, but who have very strongly defined career goals and who show potential to be leaders in whatever field [they
choose],” Marcil said. “If you get [the scholarship], they put you in an internship in Southeast Asia for a year
and they match that internship with your career goals.”

Marcil, who plans to attend medical school, hopes that participating in the Luce Scholars Program will help prepare her for
a career in medicine. “In respect to health and healthcare, I hope to gain a practical and emotional understanding of
issues, especially revolving around diseases like HIV,” Marcil said.

Although Luce Scholars cannot choose which country they work in, they can state a preference. “I’m particularly interested in China,”
Marcil said. “It has such a large population and a horrible public health system.”

Marcil discovered the scholarship through Davidson’s Graduate Fellowships Committee. Select faculty and administrators serve on the Graduate Fellowships Committee, which
assists students with fellowship and scholarship applications. Marcil began the application process in early November. Her application included a personal
statement explaining why the Luce Scholars Program was a particularly good fit for her, as well as a copy of
her transcript and four letters of recommendation.

“There are about 200 applicants. Then, you have a regional interview. Mine was at Duke with a man who had
been a Luce Scholar,” Marcil said. Forty-five finalists are chosen following the regional interview. The finalists are split into three
groups at three different sites for the final round of interviews.

“This time you have a panel of six interviewers, and have one-on-one interviews with each for 30 minutes each. My
interview is in D.C.,” Marcil said. “The nice thing is they pay for you to go there. I’m going Thursday
night. They have a get-to-know-you dinner. Then, the next day is all interviews. They pick six and then that’s it.”

If Marcil receives the scholarship, she will most likely begin intensive language training that will prepare her to leave for
Asia in August. Marcil is already well-prepared to travel abroad. “I studied abroad first in high school for a summer.
I went to Switzerland for six weeks. Then, my junior year, I studied in Denmark in the fall for four
months. I went back in the summer of 2005 for my thesis,” Marcil said.

The Luce Scholars Program began in 1974 and is funded by the Henry Luce Foundation. In 1936, the late Henry
R. Luce, co-founder and editor-in-chief of Time, Inc., founded the Henry Luce Foundation. Currently, the Henry Luce Foundation has nearly
$700 million. In addition to the Luce Scholars Program, the Foundation provides funding for the study of interdisciplinary education, religion
and theology, American art, environmental and public policy, and opportunities for women in engineering and science.

at Davidson support the proposal of a Cingular tower on campus. “I came to Davidson as a Cingular/AT&T customer, but
was left with no choice other than to pay extra money to switch to Verizon,” Davis said. “The addition of
a Cingular tower would give some future students an option and allow some of them to save a little cash.”

Other students also complain about the extra expense of switching cell phone services and using long-distance calling cards. “Because I
was either roaming or could get no signal from Suncom/AT&T, which was later bought out by Cingular to form Cingular
and a separate Suncom company, on campus, I switched to Verizon in the past year,” Nia Pleasants ’06 said. “It
just made more sense to switch to a different cell phone company so I could get reception on campus rather
than spend more money using my long-distance card number for Davidson.”

Director of Physical Plant Facilities David Holthouser, who is working with Cingular on behalf of Davidson, weighed the potential advantages
and drawbacks of the tower. One major disadvantage to having a tower is its visibility throughout the campus. While the
IMAC lights are 80 to 90 feet tall, the tower would be a minimum of 120 feet tall.

“From the College’s perspective, it would be better if four to six phone companies worked here,” Holthouser said. Having the
tower on campus would require Cingular to pay rent for space used, which would mean the college would make a
small profit from the tower. However, profitability is playing a minor role to the greater campus environment and, especially, to
students’ needs. “The bigger motivation for us is getting some cell phones to work,” Holthouser said.

tuberculosis are maintained. “ThisGrassroots approach allows physicians to work within local cultures,” Professor and Chair of Biology Verna Case said.
Locals understand and explain cultural needs to doctors, who are then able to medicate patients in a more effective manner.
Conventional wisdom had thought treatment of infectious diseases in developing countries was nearly impossible, but PIH has shown that, with
community involvement, treatment can be successful. Farmer’s visit is a result of desire expressed by students involved with the Davidson
in Mwandi program led by Case and Wessner’s HIV/AIDS seminar. Farmer is also the subject of Tracy Kidder’s book, “Mountains
Beyond Mountains,” which many students read. “I realized the extent to which disease and poverty can drain a society of
its stability,” Davidson in Mwandi participant Wes Fiser ’07 said. “[Farmer] proves that treating disease often involves more than medicines,
such as finding decent living conditions for some of his patients.” --Wes Fiser ‘07

Joey Chow ’06 was also on the Mwandi trip and read Kidder’s book. “What inspires me most about Paul Farmer
is his compassion toward his patients and the people he meets,” Chow said. Farmer’s innovative approach resonated with many Davidson
students. “He proves that treating disease often involves more than medicines, such as finding decent living conditions for some of
his patients,” Fiser said. “A large part of why he’s been so successful is his holistic approach, which encompasses community
development and addresses social justice issues,” Lucy Marcil ’06 said. Marcil, who was already interested in public health and medicine,
said Farmer’s work inspired her and helped clarify her career direction.

The students who took Wessner’s HIV/AIDS seminar last semester, as well as the current and previous participants in the Davidson
in Mwandi program, will have an informal class with Farmer Sunday afternoon. Seven of these students will have dinner with
Farmer before the talk. “It will be an amazing opportunity to speak with someone who is currently making a major
change in the way healthcare is viewed in resource-limited settings,” Krista Heiner ’06 said.

While Farmer’s work is medical, his message is relevant to the entire Davidson community. “Many Davidson students share a desire
to help the most needy, and I think they will find Paul Farmer’s example worthy of emulation,” Fiser said. Marcil
also recommended that all students attend the lecture. “This topic is highly relevant to topics beyond pure public health—social justice,
international development, globalization, politics—basically topics that affect everyone,” she said.

Farmer’s visit was expensive, and his invitation to come speak at Davidson is the result of a major joint effort.
Various Davidson organizations and departments contributed, including the Dean Rusk International Studies Program, the Union Board Speakers Committee, the Anthropology
and Biology departments, the Public Lectures Committee, and the Smith Fund. The Mecklenburg County Medical Society, through the auspices of
the Dr. Elias S. Faison Foundation, I.D. Consultants, Dr. Ozzie and Mrs. Patsy Reynolds, Drs. Shelly and Nate Spell, and
the Lake Norman Regional Medical Center also provided contributions. Student enthusiasm also played a large role in the successful effort
to secure his visit.

Farmer’s speech has been widely publicized throughout the community. Wessner wrote an Op-Ed piece in the “Charlotte Observer,” student volunteers
have placed posters advertising the visit on campus and around the community, and local physician organizations have been notified of
the upcoming visit. Tickets are free, but those interested in attending are encouraged to get tickets ahead of time. Tickets
are available at the Alvarez College Union ticket office, which is open on weekdays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.

**Suspicious Person**

While conducting a foot patrol near the baseball fields at about 12:45, an officer heard someone striking an object with
a baseball bat or stick. Upon approaching the baseball bat house, the officer saw a male’s silhouette striking the fence.
Upon arriving at the bat house, the officer did not see anyone, but saw that someone had hit the fence
with a field rake, which broke. The officer saw two white males walking in front of the building. The subjects
said they were not Davidson students but were staying with a friend. They confessed to breaking the rake. The officer
took the subjects to their friend’s house and told the friend he was responsible for all damage. The subjects were
charged with trespass and escorted off campus.

**2/11 DCPC Fight in Progress**

Officer received a call about a fight between two women in front of Davidson College Presbyterian Church. One woman said
she started the fight because she would not help the other take down some beds, and as a result, the
second woman made racial comments and “got in her face,” then took a swing at her and started the fight.
A student heard the argument but did not see who threw the first punch. The student broke up the fight
and called 911. One of the women was transported to Presbyterian Hospital in Huntersville with a laceration to the left
ear. Both were issued trespass warnings.
