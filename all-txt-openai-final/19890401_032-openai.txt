April 1989 THE DAVIDSONIANâ€™S 75th Anniversary Issue

Dreams from the Head: DAVIDSON, 2064

First of all, let's assume human beings still inhabit the Earth, that the old United States is still around, and
above all, let us assume tuition continues its annual rise. Dan Quayle never becomes president -- here is Davidson College
imagining in 2064.

Dorms and Cats: Norment? Still getting in the application. HAN is covered in protective domes to keep data rapists at
bay. Alumni offspring, but because of enrollment policies, we wink at it.

Dear Parents,

Tuition this year will be raised to a mere $10 million per semester. The campus tour...

Although our human core still eats at the dining hall, $10 million won't get a building. Yes, Grandison of Faaddre.

Social houses, the Fitchard Several Study Cartels...

Have you seen the latest Davidsonian?

Fundraising goes on...

Couple benches, no one has claimed them.

Things change, the way they stay the same.

What you can do with an Activities Grant:

1) Send Lefty Driesell to a Dale Carnegie Course
2) Finance a wine taste-in
3) Buy shirts for the ski team
4) Buy flashlights to study in the library

But you can have a "Happening," make a movie, sponsor a symposium, or do anything novel or creative to liven
up this place. The Activities Grant Foundation has the money if you have the idea. Start thinking about it. You'll
get a letter next week.
