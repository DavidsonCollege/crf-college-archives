**Dawson Quits Team**

**Wilson-Led Wildcats Edge VMI 62-55**

By STEVE BYERS

Whatever happened to the good ol' days when a game against VMI was a sure win? Well, Davidson did beat
VMI 62-55 Saturday afternoon at Johnston Gym, but it was no sure thing. In fact, had VMI made a free
throw at the end, the game easily could have gone to overtime. The Wildcats improved to 7-11 overall and 3-4
in the Southern Conference with the victory.

Coach Bobby Hussey was forced to shuffle his lineup again, this time because of freshman Caryl Dawson’s decision to transfer.
The Cats are now down to 11 players, and the loss of Dawson puts added pressure on freshman Chris Heineman
at the point guard position. Senior Tom Franz will probably back up Heineman, because sophomore Pepper Bego seems to be
at home at the “two” guard position. Put in simpler terms, the backcourt seems to be settled. The frontcourt, with
senior Kenny Wilson and sophomores Gerry Born and Jim McConkey, is definitely set and has been since Born and McConkey
began to assert themselves. Hussey may continue to reward certain players for good practices with occasional starts, but look for
Heineman, Bego, Born, McConkey, and Wilson to be in there with the game on the line. The VMI game was
no exception.

Wilson, as usual, led the Cats with 17 points, while McConkey dominated the boards with 13 rebounds. The last eight
minutes of the game found the Cats in an unusual position — trying to maintain their lead and hold off
the Keydets. Davidson by now must seem more comfortable with coming from behind, and this game proved that as the
Cats made no field goals in the last eight minutes while VMI refused to fold. Not until Bego hit a
pair of free throws with no time left could the fans breathe a little easier.

Though the game lacked spectacular plays and exciting full-court basketball, it showed that Born and McConkey are two up-and-coming players
in the Southern Conference. They controlled the inside for the Cats the entire game and hit jumpers (from 10-15 feet)
with consistency. And speaking of shooting, Heineman and Bego, with 10 and 12 points respectively, are beginning to exhibit their
offensive potential.

All of this could not come at a better time, because the Cats begin a four-game road swing tomorrow night
at Appalachian State which will show just how much character their young team has. This new lineup must gel quickly,
for the toughest part of the schedule remains, including games against Marshall, Western Carolina, and a rematch with UTC. The
Cats probably will not win the conference, but at least they have a realistic shot at finishing in the top
three, considering the balance in the conference this year. Maybe these hard-fought wins and losses of the last few weeks
will prepare the Cats for games down the road. Wilson said it best: “It’s not how you drive, it’s how
you arrive.”

The VMI game saw the unveiling of a new Wildcat mascot, which could be a good omen. But the annual
alumni game had John Gerdy '79 scoring 36 points, proving that some things never change. If only Gerdy were still
eligible...

**Women’s Basketball**

The women's basketball team wrote this piece as a letter to the editor. Due to space limitations in the Letters
column, we are printing it here.

Davidson College has a winning basketball team. The Davidson community does not seem to know it, and the coverage in
The Davidsonian certainly does not reflect it. The other day an expert sports observer (not a participant) commented to me
that winning is the ultimate pursuit in sports. The Davidson women’s basketball team agrees. Winning is setting goals and achieving
them. That is true in life, in studying, and in sports. In setting a goal you stretch your capabilities by
shooting for something you have never before attained. Once set, the...Goal takes on its true value through the effort you
expend to achieve it. A team puts out a very different kind of effort because the members work together toward
an agreed goal and thereby not only receive the special pleasures of having a lot of fun and sharing many
rewarding experiences, but they also create a unique and close relationship.

The realization of the goal (and even the surpassing of it) is the culmination of all that effort and hard
work. The victory. Out of the 1,400 students at Davidson, there are nine of us on the basketball team. We
have found a particular value in setting goals together, working toward them, and finally achieving them. When the nine of
us are on the court looking (up!) at the fifteen out of some 10,000 from UNC-Charlotte, the results on the
scoreboard look one-sided (their-sided to be exact). But to us, the results go far beyond the numbers on the wall.

At the beginning of the season, we set out to improve. One goal was to consistently reduce our turnovers. In
an early game, we committed 31. Last week, we kept it down to 13. That's winning. Here’s another example. Given
our physical size and the size of other Division I, full scholarship, six-foot-plus players, the absolute score is nowhere near
as important as the relative score. In the first game, we had no defensive control over those trees towering above
us. We set a goal to keep them under 100 points. And we have. We've kept them under 90. That’s
winning. We used to average 30 to 35 attempted shots. We set a goal to attempt more than 60 shots
per game. And we have. That's winning. Every game we have done something better than in the games before. The
coach said so. That’s winning.

A group of supportive and energetic guys come to our practices regularly. They push us and help us to improve.
We have a strong and dedicated group of fans who come to cheer and support us at every home game.
That's winning. Winning is setting goals and achieving them.

We have learned not only to love our coach but to trust and respect her for having the patience, the
dedication, the guts, and the fortitude to stick it out with us and for impressing upon us the value of
positive, unconditional support which she herself represents. We have all learned that it is indeed possible to have (and yes,
enjoy) two-and-a-half-hour practices (well, maybe not the circuits) and to play three games a week in a Division I league.
We have grown a lot (unfortunately not in inches) from these experiences. And the only way we are able to
do this is that we support each other continuously and unconditionally. And that is winning. It really is.

For the nine of us to take on UNCC with a student body easily quadruple the size of Davidson’s and
Lord only knows how many scholarship player/giants; for the nine of us to play this team ranking in the top
20 in the nation in the Charlotte Coliseum; for each of us to have fun and to trust that everyone
else is enjoying the challenge; for the nine of us to strive together to meet our agreed goals and to
finally achieve them... That is winning.
