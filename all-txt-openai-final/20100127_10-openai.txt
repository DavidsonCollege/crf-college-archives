10 THE DAVIDSONIAN

THE LOBSTER
Guest Writer

Hello student body! This is the first time I have written in The Davidsonian. Why now? I want to call
your attention to the men’s basketball game on Thursday against College of Charleston. It is arguably the team’s biggest game
of the year so far. For those of you who are new (freshmen and transfers), we tend to dislike the
Cougars. They ruin everything.

At last year’s Black Out Belk game, Charleston beat us 79-77, breaking our 27-game winning streak at home and our
43-game winning streak in conference. When we met in Chattanooga in the semi-final of last year’s Southern Conference Tournament, they
knocked us off again 59-52. This loss spoiled our hopes for an NCAA Tournament bid. I was a sad lobster
that day. Most recently, they beat us 67-55 down in Charleston in December. Davidson had an uncharacteristically poor shooting performance
that day. This time around, it would be great if the ’Cats could ruin things for them.

As of now, the Cougars have lost one game in conference play, just this week to Western Carolina. It would
be huge if Davidson gave Charleston its second loss in consecutive games. Wouldn’t you all love to see that? I
know I would.

Now, I don’t want to say anything bad about the people at College of Charleston. My cousin goes there, and
she is wonderful. But here’s an act of theirs that I feel shows the true character of Charleston students. On
Friday, they won an exciting game at home against Wofford, scoring the game-winning basket with less than two seconds left.
Good job Charleston on a solid win. They beat a formidable conference foe. But after the game, the students inexplicably
stormed the court. Come on! They beat Wofford! They did this a few weeks ago when they beat UNC, but
this is completely different. They were supposed to beat Wofford! That is all I’ll say about that. You judge for
yourselves what you think. I’ll move on.

Some of you may be reading this saying, “Hey. We’re 9-11. We have a losing record. Why should I show
up Thursday? I don’t think we have a shot.” You’re wrong here. But that’s okay! You may have been reading
stuff from people like ESPN.com writer Pat Forde, who called Davidson “just another academic school with a sub-.500 basketball team.”
Whatever, Pat. This Davidson team is definitely better than its record shows. We have been competitive in most of the
games we’ve lost. Remember that Wofford team Charleston squeaked by at home? We nearly beat them on the road. I
believe we would have won if Wofford had not been given twice as many free throws as the Wildcats. Another
narrow loss came against Cornell in overtime. It took a prayer from thirty feet to sink the Cats. About two
weeks later, that same Cornell team went to Kansas and almost pulled the upset over the No. 1 ranked team.

Tom Divinnie ’10 started the men’s season off with a bang, crushing the Davidson record in the 3000m and winning
the race at the UNC classic with a time of 8:24.47, sweeping the competition by over four seconds. Charlie Schmitt
’11 also broke Alex Hoyt’s ’09 3000m record of 8:35.7, placing fourth with a time of 8:35. Ryan Hopkins ’12
followed close behind, in sixth place with a time of 8:38. Peter Bruton ’10 led the Wildcats in the men’s
mile, placing seventh with a time of 4:21.66. Blake Evitt ’10 followed in tenth place with 4:24.41. Demetrios Pagonis ’13
also made his debut on the track in the mile with a time of 4:27.80. The Wildcats’ distance medley finished
strong with a third place finish at 10:49. Bryce Jones ’11 placed sixth in the pole vault at a height
of 4.20m (13 feet, 9.25 inches), barely missing the 1975 Davidson pole vault record of 14-0ft. Mordecai Scott ’10 led
the Wildcats in both the 60m dash and 200m, racing 7.16 seconds and 23.34, respectively. Scott was only three hundredths
of a second off the Davidson record for the 60m dash. The Davidson women broke into...their 2010 indoor season sweeping
the competition in the 3000m event. After a stellar cross country season leading the Wildcats, Natalie Atabek ’13 made her
debut on the indoor track placing third in the 3000m with a time of 10:21.21. Heather Connaroe ’11 followed close
behind, coming in sixth with a time of 10:30.31. Danielle Ruggieri ’11 was the final Wildcat over the line with
a ninth-place finish and a time of 10:38.54. Rosie Lewis ’13 also made her first appearance this weekend in the
UNC Classic representing Davidson in the 60m dash and the 60m hurdles. Jane Gay ’12 doubled up, leading for the
’Cats in both the 1600m and 800m, coming in at 5:35 and 2:30, respectively. Haley Holway ’13 and Caroline Gecker
’13 also ran the 1600m, and Cara Wilck ’13 the 800m. The Wildcats compete again next weekend, Friday, January 29th
and Saturday, January 30th at the Liberty Open in Lynchburg, Va.

WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 27, 2010

Davidson students cheer on the team during last week’s home game against Western Carolina. Students play a huge role in
creating a home court advantage.

Even in the very first game of the year, the Wildcats hung with then No. 10 Butler until the Bulldogs
pulled away in the last few minutes. Davidson’s worst loss all year is fourteen points. So hopefully I have convinced
you we have a good team. Because we do! Those of you who stuck around for the second half against
Western Carolina can vouch for me here. The Wildcats have their spurts where they ball outrageously. We’ll hit our shots.
We'll play tough defense. We won’t turn the ball over. If these spurts become more consistent, Davidson can do some
great things. I encourage all to come out Thursday and to the final five home games as well. The team
loves to see Belk Arena packed. The crowd against Western Carolina was solid. I was pleased. But on Thursday, I
want to see the student section packed. I want to hear everyone screaming their heads off for the whole forty
minutes. Hopefully, we can help the team to a big win and a strong finish to the season! We can
definitely beat Charleston. And remember, we still have a shot at the NCAA Tournament if we win the SoCon Tournament,
a task which these Wildcats are capable of performing. So again, please show up Thursday night! Thanks. And go ’Cats!

The Wildcats maintained possession and control of the contest. While Western Carolina relied on deep shooting for the whole game,
launching 20 from behind the arc, season average with 13 points as she continues her senior streak down the stretch.
