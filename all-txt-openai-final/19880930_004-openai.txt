**Who is the mayor of Davidson?**

By TRENT STEVENS

Davidson—yes, it’s the college we go to, but it’s also the name of the town in which we live. How many people know, for example, the name of Davidson’s mayor? His name is Russell B. Knox, and he plays a large role in this community.

Knox is truly a native of Davidson. His great uncle, Frank J. Knox, was a member of the town’s first board of commissioners and was elected mayor in 1895. His family built a large portion of Main Street’s present facade, including the building that now houses First Union. His parents farmed and operated a grocery store on Main Street.

After graduating from Davidson High School, Knox attended Davidson College for two years before he was drafted during the Korean War. When he returned from the army, he decided to finish his formal education at Presbyterian College, where he received a degree in business administration. Since that time, Knox married the former Pat Tucker, a graduate of Queen’s College. He has three children and will soon have four grandchildren.

In addition to serving as mayor, Knox has been president of Knox Realty, proprietor of Davidson Dry Goods, a member of the Lion’s Club, a member of First Union’s board of directors, a charter member of the YMCA, a member of the Wildcat Club, a member of the board of directors of the alumni association of Presbyterian College, chairman of the board of deacons of the Davidson College Presbyterian Church, and a member of the board of directors of the Pine’s retirement center. He has also coached little league baseball to orphans and he likes to play golf in his spare time.

The Knox family is no stranger to politics. While two family members have been mayor of this town, one of his brothers has been the mayor of Mooresville for eighteen years and another unsuccessfully ran for governor after serving as the mayor of Charlotte.

A registered Democrat, Knox first entered the political arena in 1977 because of his concern for the preservation of Davidson’s history and tranquility, both of which were being threatened by unrestrained growth. According to Knox, “The philosophy of the town of Davidson is that we are not seeking new growth. We have grown over the years just by letting people seek Davidson out rather than Davidson politicians out trying to recruit new industry to come to Davidson.”

Knox also remarked, “Our number one product is education. A great percentage of the people who live here are either an employee of Davidson College, has a loved one who works at Davidson College, or in some way has some tie with education in Davidson College. I think that that has a direct impact on the community.”

At the town level of government, Knox is joined by five commissioners. Each commissioner is the head of two committees. Since Davidson does not have a town manager, Knox assumes most of a town manager’s duties. The mayor of Davidson is essentially a chief executive officer, “who supervises the internal workings of the town, who supervises the maintenance crew, and who supervises the day-to-day operations of the town.”

“There’s one thing you gotta know before I start,” Josh White, Jr. told a packed 900 room last Saturday night, “I’m good! But you have to believe you’re good,” he continued, “because that way, if YOU leave here thinking I’m not good, I’ll still feel OK, and YOU’LL be the one with the problem!”

The comedy was a bonus for those of us who saw Josh White, Jr., who then proceeded to roll through nearly two hours of guitar mastery that ranged from fun folk and country to mellow blues, gospel, and the barely audible. Stan Hynds told the crowd I, for one, was not disappointed. But tucked neatly inside his warm voice and easy sense of humor was more than just a good time, because Josh White, Jr. brought a series of messages to the stage. His songs dealt with equality and human dignity, and both the music and the message seemed extremely well-received.

In a song about a street-sweeper, White sang “It’s my job, and that’s what makes the day,” drawing a comparison between himself and the sweeper, and sending a clear statement about the respect.police,” Knox explains. But despite these responsibilities, Knox does not have to keep regular office hours in the town hall. “I have found the fact that I have an office [Knox Realty] on Main Street; my door is open nine or ten hours every day if anybody needs access to the mayor,” he said. As for the length of his workday, “I would say that my average day would be about three hours.”

On the issue of college/town relations, “I certainly think that the overwhelming majority of the citizens of the town of Davidson are grateful that Davidson College is here. I think Davidson College is the n See MAYOR, page 6

that they were in for a treat, and - Josh White, Jr. plays 900 Room that we all deserve as human beings, regardless of our positions in society. At times, White was as much a camp counselor as a musician, admonishing the audience at one point to use a soft-bristle toothbrush. “If you’ve got one with hard bristles, throw the sucker out, preferably in a dirty place so you can’t change your mind!”

The Intimate Performances Committee of the Union definitely presented one of the most personable performers ever to come to the 900 Room, and his humor won the audience from the start. I bought a new toothbrush yesterday. White made comments about his faith in God throughout the show as well and spouted personal proverbs that held the crowd as though he were a sage, often drawing laughter and applause (“...negative comes toward you, think of something positive: do a medley!” ...laughter... “God can only do for you what He can do through you, and She can do anything!”...laughter/applause).

White described some of his songs as his “80’s songs.” “I call them that because they remind me of my 60’s songs, the kind of songs that make people think, y’know?” He continued, saying “If by chance this song offends some of you,” pause... “it’s supposed to.” You saw it coming. He then sang a Tom Paxton song about a woman who makes less than a man doing the same job.

Along with the guitar, White displayed his mastery of the pause. At one point, White read a list of children’s lessons, such as “don’t hit people,” “clean up your own mess,” and, a favorite with the audience, “take a nap every day.” He then waxed philosophical about what the world would be like if everyone took those rules to heart. “It doesn’t matter how old you are,” he reminded us.

The clearest note sounded Saturday night was an anti-apartheid message punctuated by “The Free and Equal Blues,” in which a doctor explains to a boy that “every man is the same when he’s got his skin off.” The racial message was made especially poignant when White performed some songs from a play about his father who grew up a blind, black street musician in the south. He conceded that some of it may be “a bit dated,” but in conjunction with his songs of inequality, for blacks and women especially, the performance seemed very appropriate for today. I don’t think anyone left the show thinking Josh White, Jr. isn’t “good!”

Pop Film Wall Street Power and money: Davidson dream? By BRETT BAKKE

Wall Street is blessed with both a fairly original concept and a gifted cast. The movie stars Charlie Sheen as Bud Fox, a young stockbroker on the move in New York City. His father is played by Sheen’s natural father, Martin Sheen. Michael Douglas plays Gordon Gekko, who tells Fox the “importance of information” in the Stock Market game of acquisitions and trading. The other big name is Darryl Hannah, who doesn’t do much acting of import but does look nice on a big screen.

This movie may be particularly salient to today’s society because it shows the various conflicts of a yuppie on the way to the top. Fox has to compromise his morals repeatedly as Gekko leads him further into a web of fraud and deception. The tension this creates is similar to a good action thriller but without the corny action or overdone music that tends to dominate such films. Wall Street brings forth many questions about what it is to be successful, how much of a compromise is too much, and other money and power related themes. See MONEY, page 5
