STARS IN OUR CROWN
by Louella O. Linker

The summer social session at the local college is underway, and my husband reports that the nightlife and afternoon card games have been greatly enlivened by the presence of several charming young coeds.

A certain MISS SARAH ADAMS brings a long line of red lights with only a few green ones in the distance. The gentlemen at the College don't think she learned her variation on the North Carolina Hop in Mill Town, N.C.

Our own little township is making two female contributions to the academic life, and it is hoped that this relationship shall be extended to a social one. MISS MARY BEATY is fresh from her second year at Agnes Scott.

Then there is our local high school graduate, MISS PATTY KIMBROUGH. Her name and figure are familiar to local residents. The young gentlemen would like to see more of Patty about the campus (for she will be at Salem next fall) than a brief red flash on the way to class.

MISS LYNN PALMER is planning to go to Saint Mary's in her new hometown of our state capitol. Her former residence of New Orleans has endowed her with much Storyville spice. I fear there is going to be a lot of competition between the State boys and our gentlemen in the fall.

My husband tells me that there is a very attractive co-ed commuting from Charlotte, MISS BECKY DEAL. She is blissfully pinned to a former Davidsonian, but personally, I would prefer to have my bliss a little closer than Emory Medical School.

Well, to each his own, and I still have my Cop.

WATERMELON FEAST TONIGHT AT NINE

Special invitations have been sent to local girls in an attempt to supplement our co-eds. An order for twenty (yes, 20) ice-cold watermelons has been placed.

YOUR COLLEGE UNION
by Joe Collese

All of us are aware of the weekly Wednesday interludes and the weekend movies sponsored by the College Union, but there are many services which you may enjoy almost any day of the hour or minute.

For those with an ear for music, we have all kinds, speeds, and sizes of records which may be checked out and taken to the Music Room. In this second-floor "rendezvous," you will find soft couches and a high-fidelity phonograph.

The music lover's cubbyhole is located in the center of the building, and although it has a large plate-glass window overlooking the spacious ballroom, it does not have an air conditioning unit. Until Mr. Smith can find one in his bag of magic, we suggest that you ask the desk attendant to turn on the fan therein.

Available in the Union lounge is a vast variety of periodicals, newspapers, and books. For the time being (until we refrain from taking them to our rooms), the new copies of magazines must be checked out at the desk. There is a score of art folios by such masters as Van Gogh, Rembrandt, and Degas which may be taken out and observed until your aesthetic heart is content.

If you are bored, and television doesn't bore you, we might suggest that you slip into the Television Room.

There are many forms of entertainment which can be created in the Union Ballroom. You might play the "Missouri Waltz" on that beautiful baby grand or get up a foursome for bridge. For a change of scenery, you could venture out onto the patio for a game of shuffleboard.

And, if you insist on paying for your fun by the minute, you have the possibility of billiards or ping pong.
