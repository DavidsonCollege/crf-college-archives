CAT TALES
By TONI CASALI
DAVE WARDEN
Guest Columnist
Captain 1938 Wildcats

Toni has promised me that he will take full responsibility for this particular column, so if you do not like
it talk to him and just glare at me.

What kind of a football team will Davidson College have this fall? I have been asked that question time and
time again—probably you have asked me yourself, and probably you think you have the correct answer. If you happen to
be one of those that think Davidson College will be beaten by State, mauled by Duke, trampled by Carolina, whipped
by Furman, flogged by the South Carolina Gamecocks—then you are just the person that I want to read this column.

If you believe that we will put up a good fight but still think that we will lose to these
teams, then what “in Heaven's name” do you expect but defeats? What I'm trying to say is this: The football
team has to have the full support of the 650 members of the Davidson student body. Eleven men go out
on the gridiron to represent you—the Davidson Student Body. They don’t go out on the field half-heartedly, expecting defeat and
with the intention to just put up a good fight and yet lose the game. They go out with heart,
mind, and body, set on winning the game. Why should you, 650 strong, expect them to just hold the score
down?

Put your whole heart and mind into the game. When your team fumbles let it hurt you as much as
it must have hurt the player who fumbled. When the other team fumbles, be just as eager to recover it
as the players. “Hold that line” with every ounce of energy that you possess. Bat down every pass that the
opponents throw, be on your toes making and taking every break. Then if you do this throughout the game you
will find that you have not only put your heart and mind into the game, but also your body. You
will be tired but happy and satisfied with a game well played.

Davidson student support at football games has been almost perfect. The Davidson spirit is a great and wonderful thing. Personally,
I do not think it has diminished in the least. “Well!” then you ask, “what am I yelling about!” Just
this: Give your football team your WHOLEHEARTED SUPPORT. Don’t say as I have heard many say—“Ah, well! we should give
Duke, Carolina, etc., a good game, but they will win by a couple of touchdowns.” With you in that frame
of mind, I ask you, do you think you are giving the team your solid support? You may be present
at the game, but something will be lacking, and that something may cause your team to lose. If the entire
Davidson student body had enough confidence in their team to KNOW that they would defeat Duke this fall—do you think
that Duke would win? Well, I believe with my heart, that they WOULD NOT. Duke would not only be playing
eleven Wildcats on the field, but they would also be playing 650 Wildcats in the stands. Now, do you think
that eleven Duke men could handle 650 Wildcats? There can be only one answer to that.

I am not pointing to one team on our schedule! This applies to all the teams on our schedule. Now,
you will probably bring up the point, “you don’t have the material for a good team this fall.” My answer
to that is this—we have a hard-working, clean-living, and last but greatest of all, a God-fearing squad of football players.
I might also add that they have no trouble speaking English. When the going gets tough, I'll take this kind
of football player any day, and be thankful I have him.

We do not have to have a bunch of Jews, Germans, or Greeks, to win football games. Harvard had one
of the best football teams in the East last fall and they had only two or three foreign-looking names.

I hate to lose and I only hope that 650 Davidson students hate to lose as much as I do.
My parting words to you are these: “Let's fight them to the last ditch—jump the last ditch and keep fighting
them.”

Four Teams Remain In Hotly Contested Race

The SAE’s, Phi Gams, SPE’s, and Kappa Sigs remained undefeated in the current softball tournament as six games were played
during the past week.

The SAE’s beat the Pikas 4-2 in a first-round match, and then took on the KA’s who had a bye
in the first round. Schabel gave up 12 runs in the first frame to let the SAE’s clinch the game
and go into the semi-finals. Although the KA’s tallied five times in the third, the final count was 15 to
9.

In another first-round game, the K. Sigs defeated the Phi Delts by a 19-5 margin. The winners scored consistently in
every inning as Scott pitched good ball. Ogburn, Phi Delt pitcher, gave up 14 hits while his mates were gathering
10 off Scott. Means had two doubles and a three-bagger to lead the batting.

The SPE’s landed on the Pi Kappa Phi’s and won, 10 to 6 in their first game. Lyons and Craver
looked good afield and at the plate.

In the fourth of the first-round consolation matches, the Phi Gams defeated the Betas in a close game, 13-11. Bolin
was the moundsman for the winners while Squires tossed for the Betas. Barker led the hitters with two triples, one
with the sacks crowded. The Ganiers and Irwin also played well.

The Betas took the Phi Delts into camp 8-7 in the first of the consolation matches. They will meet the
other losers in the first round to decide the championship.

The Juniors tied with the Sophs for the interclass championship with four won and two lost each. The Seniors were
next with three won and three lost and the Frosh brought up the rear as they lost five times while
winning once.

THE DAVIDSONIAN

Davidson Sports
Wildcats To Face Devils

Strong Duke Team To Present Host of Stars

The Davidson varsity track team meets the Duke University cindermen in Durham Saturday in the 'Cats’ last dual competition of
the year. The Blue Devils have probably the second strongest team in the North Carolina conference—having been beaten by Carolina
by a slender margin. The Dukes are expected to be the most powerful in high and low hurdles, both sprints,
440 yd. run, shot put, and javelin.

Don Kinzler, star Devil timber-topper, won the high hurdles at the Penn relays two weeks ago in the excellent time
of 14.8 seconds. In addition, Kinzler clipped off a 14.4 at Annapolis last Saturday. This was the fastest flight of
high hurdles run in the southeast since the heyday of Georgia's famous kangaroo, “Spec” Towns, two seasons ago. Herb Hudgins,
Duke football great, is a conference standout in the low hurdles, having negotiated the 220 yd. obstacles in 24.5 seconds
or better on several occasions. Reavis is the Blue Devil sprint star.

On the other hand, the Blue Devils will not be so strong in the pole vault, two-mile runs, and the
high jump.

Frats In Race For Top Place

The inter-fraternity sports competition comes to a head this week as the softball tournament draws to a close. According to
present standings, any one of four fraternities can win the annual cup by winning the softball. The Phi Delts are
leading the present standings with 646 points. Next are the Phi Gams with 567 points, and the SAE’s are third
with 558. The Kappa Sigs with 550 and the KA’s 541 round out the list of possible contenders for the
inter-frat crown.

She’s Got Everything

“BULLY JOHN” RUDISILL and SAM HEMPHILL are two veteran reasons for the Cats’ sudden exodus from their baseball slump last
week. Rudisill played a large part in the Wake Forest victory by driving in three runs at a crucial moment.
Hemphill has played consistently good ball on the keystone sack all season, his fielding being a feature of the Wildcat
infield. Both men are juniors and are playing their second year of varsity ball. Rudisill plays right field and Hemphill
covers third base.

Abbey Cops First Place In Junior College Meet
Napier of Brevard, Wins 100, Hurdles, Broad Jump

The Belmont Abbey Crusaders scored 41 1-3 points last Saturday to win the first annual North CarolinaJunior College track meet,
held here at Davidson.

Kittens Lose Close Games | Ray, Mars Hill Speed Artist, Strikes Out 24 Men

The Abbey won five first places to almost double the score of the second team, finishing with 21 points. The
Davidson frosh lost three close games during the past week, the first to Mars Hill after a seven-run spree in
the twelfth inning, the second to Presbyterian Junior High, 2-3, and the last on Monday afternoon to Wingate, 13-14. Oak
Ridge finished fifth with 4-8 markers. The Junior collegians posted some good times, the outstanding of which was probably Napier’s
10.1 hundred-yard dash. The Brevard star also won the 120-yard low hurdles and the broad jump to lead the individual
scorers by a wide margin. His fifteen points comprised almost three-fourths of his team’s markers.

Ten Men Enter National Meet

The National Chapter of Sigma Delta Psi, honorary athletic fraternity, recently informed the local chapter that the national championships of
the fraternity are soon to be held. The local group has selected ten men to comprise its team. They are
Boo Walker, Wilson, Ned Iverson, John Donaldson, Swede Johnson, Dave Sprunt, Nick Schiltz, Milton Crisp, Foots Cowan, and Monroe Wicker.
Times, distances, and heights for the following twelve events will be taken and sent to national headquarters at Purdue University.
There they will be compared with records from 61 other institutions holding chapters, and winners will be decided.

Event Points
100 yard dash—2 for 12.6 sec.
120 yd. low hurdles—2.2 for 17 sec.
20 foot rope climb—1 for 13.9 sec.
100 yd. swim—1.2 for 2 min 10 sec.
One mile run—1 for 6 min.
High jump—3 for 4 ft. 4 ins.
Football punt—1 for 40 yds.
Javelin throw—1 for 120 ft.
Baseball throw—1 for 250 ft.
16 lb. shot put—1 for 30 ft.
Run broad jump—1 for 16 ft. 9 in.
Run high jump—4 for 4 ft. 6 ins.

Golf Tourney Attracts Two

Davidson's varsity golfers were inactive this week in intercollegiate competition, as the Wildcats prepped for the Southern Conference tournament at
Hot Springs, Va., which is to be held on Friday and Saturday. Charlie Pegram, sophomore ace of the team, and
Coach Spearman, premiere coaching staff shot-maker, entered the Charlotte Country Club tournament, which was held last Thursday through Saturday in
Charlotte. Pegram was beaten by Al Dowtin of Wake Forest, three and one in the semi-final round. Coach Spearman won
his first-round match but was defeated by Pegram in the quarter-finals. Both men qualified last Thursday with twin 78's. The
Davidson golfers will wrap up their practice rounds today and probably leave sometime tomorrow for the Virginia tournament. The 'Cat
linksmen will probably be classed as dark horses, and if sufficiently “on” their games, should push Duke and North Carolina
for team honors. Duke's Tom Perry is probably the individual favorite.

Hollywood cameras are clicking on the Virginia Military Institute campus these days getting “local color” for the film version of
“Brother Rat.”

Steere Bests Demon Deacs In Nip and Tuck Battle

Steere Paves Way To Victory Over Demon Deacons

Varsity Takes First Big Five Win as Fitzgerald Drives in Winning Run in Fifth Inning

His Third Win of Season Steere Pitches

By ELLWOOD MOYER

A five-run rally in the fifth inning gave the Wildcats a 9-8 win over the Wake Forest Demon Deacons last
Thursday afternoon and sent the Laird men into ninth place in the Southern Conference standings, one game behind V.M.I., the
Davidson goal for the 1938 season. The win, Davidson's first in the Big Five circuit and sixth of the season,
was the Cats’ fourth win in their six home games this season. Eddie Steere went the route for the Lairdmen
although he was hit hard in the early innings. The Deacons got to the Cat right-hander for eight runs and
nine hits in the first five frames but after that, the Wildcat hurler was invincible. After setting down 13 hitters
in order, Wake Forest put on a short-lived rally in the ninth which saw Farley triple into deep center and
Dickens, purposely walked, pulled up at second on a steal. However, at this point, with the winning run on the
sacks, Steere forced Fuller to ground out, ending the game. Two walks, an error, and hits by Dunford, Rudisill, and
Fitzgerald accounted for the five tallies in Davidson's half of the fifth inning. The Wildcats close their season this week,
meeting Furman on Tuesday, Catawba on Thursday, and N.C. State on Saturday.
