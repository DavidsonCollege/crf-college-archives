### Super Start

"Believe me. It wasn’t easy there at first to get started," says David L. Barker, Class of ’71 UNC—CH School of Pharmacy. Dave has a family and a good job. And the extra expenses of getting established in his new town. Then the car they had driven in college started to clonk out. That’s when Dave had more expenses than cash. But Dave was lucky. The very year he graduated, First-Citizens Bank invented Super Start for people just like him. So Dave got his new car. No hassle, and a preferred rate loan with a delayed payment option.

Graduating students from four years of college, post-graduate, or professional school can qualify for Super Start.

Also, be a student in good standing with a C or higher average. And be of legal age with definite plans to live and work in North Carolina after college.
