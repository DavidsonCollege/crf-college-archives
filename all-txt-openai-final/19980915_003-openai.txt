THE DAVIDSONIAN

On Tuesday, September 8, the SGA Senate passed the resolution of the Student Advisory Council to the Director of Auxiliary Services regarding improvements to the Union Cafe. Foster Haselden, chair of the SAC, authored the resolution. “I hope people will listen to it,” said Haselden. “It really does come from the students.” He continued, “It’s basically an articulation of student concerns and student requests.”

Haselden was first concerned about the cafe when he returned to campus for RLO staff training. “I saw the changes, and then all my friends came and asked me about it.” In response, Haselden talked to Richard Terry, the Director of Auxiliary Services, to help update the SGA on the changes. Haselden said people were most concerned about the shortened hours and missing bottled drinks. From there, Haselden and the SAC continued to meet frequently with Terry during the first two weeks of school. Because of the meetings, health and beauty products, First Aid, and bottled drinks have returned. A smoothie machine and greaseless french fry machine, which were purchased this summer, will be installed once the Physical Plant runs the power line.

Haselden calls the resolution he wrote with SGA President Ann Harriot Fisher “the most recent step we’ve done.” The Polling and Response committee will conduct a student survey, and the SAC will continue to meet with Terry. Haselden said that they will “work through the SGA and the committee.” Haselden has enjoyed working with Terry, who has been “very willing to work with the SAC” and receptive to the committee’s suggestions. Haselden said, “He (Terry) has a good relationship with the SGA and this committee.”

Haselden understands “the economics of the situation and that the Union Cafe is a business that actually runs very well. Richard Terry is charged with reaching a yearly income and finding out how to reach it. They’re (Auxiliary Services) doing their job, and we're (SAC) doing ours.”

The SAC also covers the Union Outpost, Vail Commons, the laundry, in addition to the Union Cafe. “We meet with the heads of each branch of Auxiliary Services and tell them what students have been talking to us about, get updates on what’s coming next, and answer questions they might have about students’ concerns or wishes,” said Haselden. Haselden regards the committee as a “communicative process,” and said it “has been really active during the last two years.”

Resolutions are “the way SGA works. If we really want something, we put it in writing,” said Haselden. Past SGA resolutions include evaluating diversity at Davidson and helping Professor of Spanish Magdalena Maiz-Peña receive tenure. For “the big things that students really want, the senator that’s working on it writes it up. After it’s written, the resolution is presented to the SGA, we discuss it, and then vote on it.” Once a resolution has passed, the SGA sends it to those Haselden calls “the real decision makers.” Haselden hopes that this resolution “carries a lot of weight because it comes from the SGA and the students,” but adds that the success of a resolution depends upon the individual situation and time frame.

Haselden has worked on the SAC since Fall 1996, and he has been its chair since Spring 1997. During this time, he believes, “communication has been a real asset. Auxiliary Services has been very cooperative and I understand that they have a job to do that they work really hard at. Whenever they can make an improvement, they always have.”

Terry also feels the process has been productive. “I very much appreciated the work of Foster and the SAC, and I thought it was really great work.” He was not surprised by anything in the resolution. Terry is “trying to do what is best for the school,” and he plans to “continue to bring back some products such as batteries and frozen entrees.” The candy bar selection has already been increased by thirty percent, the old Saturday hours are back, and bottled drinks have been restored, though Terry said the cafe “may not have the same vast array.” Auxiliary Services is still “exploring how we can provide refrigeration (for bottled drinks) without taking up as much space” so that there is room for new products and the cafe is more handicap accessible. Terry added that many items have just been moved and students had problems finding them.

Planning to have a continuous process of improvements, Terry is looking forward to the SGA survey. He said that changes are “still in flux” and that improvements “should always be fluid.” He plans to work with Haselden to find a process for continuous feedback. Terry emphasized, “We’re not enemies in this, the students and Auxiliary Services and myself.”

Jesse Smallwood, chairman of theSGA Polling and Response Committee said that they are writing the survey to “gauge students’ numerical and statistical reactions to changes in the Union.” The Polling and Response Committee also hopes “to get concrete ideas about how to improve the Union and to change it to meet students’ needs.” Smallwood plans to gauge whether students like the changes, when students use the Cafe, whether they use it for meals or snacks, what items students use the most, their preferences, and their favorite brand names. Smallwood said that brand names are important because only three-quarters of the brands can be reinstated. Haselden said, “I wrote this resolution just to articulate what students have come up to me concerned about and what they would like to see improved at the Union Cafe, and I hope that this has a positive impact on the Union.” Haselden wants “everything to work out best for the students. I think that’s why it’s (the Union Cafe) there, to serve us.”

Where does meaning rely in your life? This was the proposition set forth by Dr. Abraham Verghese when he came to speak to students and faculty in Love Auditorium last Wednesday night. Verghese’s talk was following the freshman class’s reading and discussions of his book, My Own Country, during orientation. The book deals with Verghese’s personal search for meaning in his life as a physician and the search of his AIDS patients as they are abruptly confronted by their mortality in Johnson City, Tenn. Verghese told the audience that “the cold and unimaginable language of science couldn’t capture the grief in the stories of my patients and their families,” and thus he narrates them in My Own Country. In reference to the book, Verghese said, “In these stories, there is a kind of victory... All of us are going to die. It’s not something we think about. Yet, when you have HIV, it becomes your dominant thought. One emotion comes out more than anything: What has been the meaning of my life? It’s often a question we put off until the next step, but for my patients, that question could not be ignored.”

Verghese left the audience with life lessons from his experience. He said, “meaning for my patients did not reside in wealth, good looks, and power. Meaning seemed to often reside in the relationships they had formed with family, friends, and significant others.” Verghese concluded his talk with a letter written from a dying AIDS patient to his mother. While at Davidson, Verghese talked with Dr. Rosemarie Tong’s Medical Humanities class and had a breakfast with Dr. Brenda Flanagan’s creative writing class. He also participated in a book signing in Charlotte for his recently published second novel, The Tennis Partner: A Doctor's Story of Friendship and Loss. Verghese told the Medical Humanities class about the need for compassion and moral sensitivity as well as scientific competency in physicians. Tong said, “Dr. Verghese is a model for the way medicine should be in the new millennium. He’s a perfect combination of head and heart.”

Freshman Roshan Paul, from Bangalore, India, traces his roots to Kerala, the same southern state in India from which Verghese’s parents migrated. Kerala is predominantly Christian and Muslim, and the only state in India to have a 100 percent literacy rate. Paul, who met Verghese during a breakfast, said, “It was nice to speak to someone eloquent but also soft-spoken. Dr. Verghese can talk for hours on anything... He has a treasury of experience to draw from.” English professor Dr. Tony Abbott, who introduced Verghese to the audience in Love Auditorium, said, “I thought it was a wonderful evening. I was impressed with Dr. Verghese’s warmth and openness. Reading his book for orientation and then having him come here was a very powerful combination.”
