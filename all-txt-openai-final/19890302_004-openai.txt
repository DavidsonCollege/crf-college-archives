**Women’s Month: A Time to Address Student Concerns**
By LIZ YAREMA

The month of March is upon us and with it comes Davidson’s celebration of 15 years of women as official
members of the student body. For you see, besides being the time earmarked as “spring break,” March is also Women’s
History Month. In a gala campus-wide celebration, the college will host speakers, numerous films, open lunches, exhibits, and other events
in hopes of sparking discussion and debate on women’s issues. Organizers call the project “Women at Davidson: A Tradition of
Excellence.” Sponsors include the Women’s Concerns Committee, Cinema Classics, Campus Forum, and the Alumni Lecture Series. They have worked together
to draw energy and enthusiasm for the month from as many parts of the campus as possible.

Even professors are getting into the spirit of things. By focusing on feminine elements in classroom lectures and discussions, professors
hope to raise students’ awareness of women’s issues and concerns. Classes will address a variety of interests: something for students
with passions for music as well as art, science as well as philosophy, sports, literature, international studies—and just about anything
else. You get the picture.

Why bother? Why does women’s history merit an entire month of events? Might a separate month dedicated specifically for women
further delineate differences between women-as-a-minority? Although statistically females may not be a minority, some students and faculty say that as
far as society’s treatment and perception of women goes, they are unfortunately still very much a minority.

**Patricia’s Peeves:**
History professor Sallie McMillan, who currently teaches Davidson’s pioneer women’s studies class,believes that although society has made many advances towards
equality between the sexes, much more is left to do. She cites some examples: help for two-career families, equal pay
for equal worth, a woman’s personal liberty over her own body, and corporate “glass ceilings” that deny women the opportunity
for advancement past certain levels in business. “Women still have to fight discrimination in too many aspects of their lives,”
she says. A student in her class comments, “Especially here at Davidson. When you say ‘Women’s Concerns’ or start talking
about stuff dealing with women today, others look at you like you’re from outer space or like they expect to
see you on TV at some bra-burning rally. It’s sad how many closed-minded people there are among the students and
the faculty,” the student says. Another person asks, “Can’t they see that women aren’t the issue at all, that what
we’re really talking about is basic humanity and equality for everyone?” Equality is the ultimate goal of Women’s History Month
according to several organizers of “A Tradition of Excellence.” They hope that someday a month set aside especially for women
will be unnecessary, that issues and perceptions concerning women will be so well integrated into Davidson life that a special
month would seem redundant. For now, they are marking their calendars and counting on the belief that education is one
of the best ways to dispel myths and prejudices that could harm society.

Just don’t even say it...

Pondering the possibilities for this week’s column, I turned to my roommate studying at her desk and said, “Hey, what
about an article concerning people who clean under their fingernails while they’re standing over your bed? I really hate that.
Think anyone would read it?” After a long silence, the Queen of Concentration mumbled, “In a minute, I’m almost done.”
That’s all she has to say, I found my topic. You see, “In a minute,” and “I’m almost done,” are
two of my most despised phrases. There are a lot of obnoxious phrases in the world, we all remember, “You’re
growing like a weed!” and “Have a nice day.” Yet, there are some precious quotes that simply make my skin
crawl. I’ll share some of them with you.

If I ask a friend when they are going to repay the five dollars I loaned them, they would do
well not to respond, “When I get around to it.” Not only does this response dredge up memories of tacky
wooden circles with “This is a Round Tuit” painted on them, it also makes me want to charge interest. When
I get two A’s, a B+ and a B for the semester—and I’m ecstatic—I don’t want the girl down the
hall to look at me and say, “I’m so happy for you.” It’s not like I can respond, “Yeah, me
too.” It leaves me with nothing to do but feel dumb.

Then there are pick-up lines. Guys, refrain from ever starting a conversation with, “Has anyone ever told you...” This only
works with Queenies. I hate people who take me aside and whisper, “We’ve got to talk sometime.” If you really
want to talk to me, find me when I’m alone and start talking. Nothing annoys me more than trying to
pay attention in class and devote myself to work when I’m expecting to find out something awful in the near
future.

I’ve also been accosted with, “You’ll understand when you get to be my age.” Now, this phrase was bad enough
when my grandmother used it. But there are students, sometimes no more than a class ahead of me, who will
look me straight in the eye and explain that as soon as I live a little longer, God will enlighten
me and I will see things their way. Now maybe I just don’t like people who have trouble with white
lies, but when I buy...
