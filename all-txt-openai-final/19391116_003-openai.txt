Thurs. Nov. 16, 1939 THE DAVIDSONIAN

Question of the Week

Since the announcement last week in chapel of the revision of the cut system, discussion of its merits has been
on every tongue. Here are the statements of several representative men on the campus when asked, “What do you think
of the recent revision of the cut system?”

Don Hott, Senior: I'm all for it. I had a week's sick cuts taken off the books and the limit
raised. It did a lot of good. Of course, the system is not as liberal as last year, but it
is better than the last one, so I think it is a good improvement. The failure of the last system
was that a student carrying only twelve hours of work had the same number of cuts as one carrying twenty-one
hours. Of course, we can't expect to get a perfect system from one’s point of view.

Tom Rogers, Sophomore: Undoubtedly the entire student body is greatly pleased with the newly installed cut system. I am certainly
no exception. The cooperation given the faculty by the students thus far this year is greatly responsible for its added
freedom, and we should remember that when we are inclined to have a demonstration such as has heretofore been a
traditional part of the Davidson year.

Frank R. Walker, Junior: I am highly in favor of the new cut system. However, I think we could easily
go back to the old cut system which we had last year, provided heavier penalties were placed on those who
overcut. I think the persons who were careful not to overcut last year should not have to suffer for those
who obviously did not care how much they cut. I think the present system is very suitable for the freshmen
but is somewhat limiting on the three upper classes. This revision definitely shows that much can be gained by talking
over problems existing between the students and faculty than by using harsher methods. Nothing has ever been gained by riots
which accomplish nothing and show the student body in ungentlemanly conduct. Further misunderstanding between the two parties concerned would be
the only result.

Leonard Menius, Senior: I am in favor of the new cut system. I think that the number of cuts allowed
should be on an ascending basis, giving the upper classes more cuts because the upperclassmen know better when and what
they can cut without it affecting their grades in any detrimental manner. For this same reason, I am in favor
of the Dean's list, also because it offers a reward for three years of good hard work. However, I think
that the main thing that was wrong with the old system was that overcutting was not penalized enough, not that
we were allowed too many cuts.

Frank Hall, Junior: In my opinion, the present revised cut system is a great improvement over that in force at
the beginning of the year. Nonetheless, I feel that it could certainly be improved greatly still. Of course, I realize
and appreciate the benevolence of the faculty in its concession to the students' desires. The main deficiency as I see
it is that at present a senior even on the Dean's list gets twenty cuts, which is a mere matter
of two cuts more than I got when I was a freshman. Thus it would appear that an allowance should
be made for the number of hours carried by the student if any such general regulation is enacted.

Jim Kerr, Sophomore: Our newly inaugurated absence regulations show a definite improvement over those to which we were subject at
the beginning of this year. There was a slight idiosyncrasy in the former system—it stated that the cuts were granted
only for the benefit of those who needed them in case of illness. This was apparently based on the assumption
that seniors got sick almost twice as often as freshmen, for the former received fourteen to the latter’s eight! This
has been rectified to the contentment of all, and sick cuts are no longer counted against one’s unexcused cut record.
Notwithstanding, I feel that those

Of Alumni Permanent Peace

Dr. A. V. Goldiere and Dr. G. B. Watts were Davidson's representatives at the annual meeting of the North Carolina
chapter of the American Association of French Teachers, held in Charlotte on November 3 and 4. Hosts on this occasion
were the French Department of Queens-Chicora College.

With both pleasant and painful memories of seventeen months’ service in 1917-18, Mrs. N. T. Smith, supervisor of the Davidson
dormitories, expressed the fervent hope last week that Davidson students will never have to take part in another great war.

As the country celebrated the twenty-first anniversary of the Armistice, Mrs. Smith paused to recount some of the experiences she
had while working with the soldiers stationed at Camp Greene in Charlotte. Working under the War Camp Community Service, it

“There were soldiers there,” she remembered, “from every section governed by the United States and from every walk of life—artists,
writers, clergymen, master-mechanics who could build almost any-

thing. We had to stand witness at army weddings and funerals, even to nurse victims of the dreaded meningitis and
influenza. How-

ever, we must not let the present international conflict lead us into the Second World War.”

Rice Speaks To Students On Present Crisis

Students here paid tribute to the boys who gave their lives in the First World War in a season of
silent prayer at eleven o'clock on last Saturday, anniversary of the Armistice.

Sam Spencer, president of the Student Body, asked that two minutes of silence be observed in all classes in order
to give students an opportunity to pray for peace. A bell was sounded at eleven and re-

Maxwell for a university session. The program included a literary paper exchange in the 1850s. The half-day event in North
Carolina will be the highlight. A travel talk on France is also planned. The court is now looking for a
Frenchman, United States citizen, involved in a million-dollar fund from the Rockefeller Foundation. The completion of the program will be
celebrated at the annual D-Club banquet, probably held in Chambers on Thursday evening, December 7. These plans were decided upon
at the last meeting.

The following freshmen, tried and convicted at a session of the Court of Control held Tuesday night, November 7, were
sentenced in chapel Monday by Judge Benny Harrison:

- J. B. Campbell, found guilty of failure to wear his freshman cap, walking on the grass, and inciting freshmen
to leave before upperclassmen, was given one week of strict campus.
- Vincent DeWitt, found guilty of the same charge, was also sentenced to remain on campus for one week.

The D-Club voted favorably on a motion that the varsity cheerleaders be given complimentary football tickets. The banquet will be
held in the dining room of Chambers, and members of the D-Club will of course be invited, as well as
many sportswriters, photographers, and other visitors, among them certain alumni.

Last Sunday evening, vespers were conducted in Chambers Auditorium by Dr. Sylvester Green of Hartsville, South Carolina, President of Coker
College. Dr. Green took his text from Psalms 90 and 102. His theme was a Living Religion, which he showed
in three aspects: it must be unselfish, productive, and more than our forefathers both spiritually and intellectually.

The Journalism Club met last Wednesday night at the S.A.E. fraternity house. President Austin announced that the petition drawn up
by the Club for application for admittance into the Honorary Fraternity Council had been accepted. Warren Ludlam, President of the
Council, would allot a time for meeting sometime in the near future. The minutes of the last meeting were read,
and the neophytes completed their prerequisite to membership by presenting a one-act play in French. The new members are:

- H. T. Brady
- W. T. Burch
- L. H. Jackson
- J. C. Little
- W. C. Plunkett
- E. C. Scott
- R. L. Smith
- A. B. Taylor
- D. B. Thompson
- A. C. Winn

Dave Sprunt was in charge of initiation. Refreshments, games, and songs followed a short business meeting, and the "Frenchmen" adjourned
to meet again in the latter part of November. Plans for the future include trips to nearby girls' schools to
cooperate with other French clubs in exchanging short French plays.
