**Sig Ep (Continued from Page 1)**

He believed that by the beginning of the winter term, freshmen were capable of making a judgment regarding their social
status. In a statement regarding Sig Ep’s policy change, Dean of Students Will Terry said, (Continued from page 1) the
people connected with this project must get together so that they can at least agree on the figures. Recently, opposition
to such a system of financing has arisen. The administration has begun to wonder whether such high costs to students
make the construction advisable, and it will now consider the financial alternatives. The Development staff, which apparently has not been
consulted, has expressed some concern over the handling and negative attitudes about financing the new dorms.

Vice-President for Finance and Development C. David Cornell recently stated, “It is premature at this point to say building the
new dormitories is impossible.” However, even Cornell, Decision “all during the plans for ‘rush’ between all the groups involved, on
campus and off, never once did anyone object from Sigma Phi Epsilon to the proposed schedule. From my viewpoint, all
these protestations of cooperation and then this vote Dormitories male enrollment must drop. However, this is unacceptable to many people,
notably some of the alumni money givers. Yet, it is important that the number of coeds be increased to create
a better male-female ratio and a more natural atmosphere. Furthermore, if considering the dorms as the community stabilizes to an
enrollment of 1200. College officials must get together promptly to settle their differences and work out a uniform policy on
the dorms. If it is finally decided to build now, then the financial people had better begin deciding on the
“hows” of such a plan. Time and delay are starting to tighten the noose around the new dormitories.

**Monson Gives Honor Court Position On Thefts**

The Student Senate voted to back the Student Hearing Committee's campaign to lessen library book thefts in this week's meeting.
The Chairman of the Student Hearing Committee, Mark Monson, appeared at the meeting in response to the Senate’s proposal for
a turnstile system in the new library. Monson expressed a concern that this action was adopted before other measures have
been tried to stop the problem of missing library books. He read a resolution from the Student Hearing Committee which
proposed the following action for the winter term:

1. Establishment of a temporary check-desk for all books leaving the library.
2. A publicity campaign directed towards all users of the library in order to generate an increased concern and consciousness
of the problem. This campaign will potentially include...such items as posters, book-drop stations, and talks by Hearing Committee members to
eating clubs, freshman halls, and faculty members; and 3) request assistance of the SGA, Library Committee, Student Conduct Council, faculty,
and administration to help in the campus-wide effort. After discussion, the Senate passed an endorsement of the Hearing Committee's resolution.

Steve Dodd reported from the Educational Policy Committee. The committee approved night exams in their last meeting. Also, in Tuesday’s
meeting, the Senate approved the nominations of John Munce as Senate Parliamentarian and Sue Cunningham as a Senate Executive Committee
member.

To rush by the fraternity to issue bids on their own schedule is a breaking of a gentlemen’s agreement and
an act of bad faith toward all other social groups on and off campus,” he continued. Baker explained that Sig
Ep “didn’t consider changing its decision until Oct. 31. We didn’t make any objections prior to that. We had been
giving it our full support and did participate with the first formal rush.”

Jim Coggin, Sig Ep rush chairman, supported the move declaring that “Sig Ep is distinctly separate from the on-campus eating
groups. We feel that our decision to rush, bid, and pledge freshmen the first week of winter term will not
adversely affect the self-selection procedure and will provide a positive contribution to the social life at Davidson.”

Obstruction (Continued from page 1)

It is presently uncertain what student members of the committee John Hornickel, Blain Butner, and Bo Phillips want as they
have never made their position clear. Former student members of the committee and others intimately involved, on the other hand,
have pushed for student representation with full voting rights in the faculty meeting. It became quite clear after the first
year of committee deliberations (1971-72) that the faculty would never go along with students voting in any kind of faculty
meeting. So the students compromised their position to the point where they demanded only to attend and participate in any
and all debate, but not to vote. For their part, however, the faculty seems unwilling to compromise at all in
this matter. Since they are arguing from a position of strength, they are as unyielding as granite. (Their position is
a result of two factors: 1) students have little bargaining power, and 2) Spencer has assured the faculty that nothing
will go to the trustees without their approval.)

It seems that what the faculty is really afraid of is students just listening to faculty discussion and debate at
their meetings, or witnessing the real power struggles unfold. As it now stands, faculty members may hold any position they
wish and ignore student opinion since only the SGA president will be there to hold them to what they say.
Unfortunately, one student against 90 faculty members is not very good odds. If students were present in a significant number,
then the faculty might be forced to consider what they say more carefully, a possibility which many want to avoid
at all costs. This is where all the controversy presently lies. On Nov. 28, a third governance model, drawn up
by trustee member Mullis, professor MacCormac, and student Phillips will be presented to the full committee. It is hoped that
this model will provide an alternative to the educational policy dilemma. It is doubtful, however, that it will incorporate any
significant student input at the faculty meeting level.
