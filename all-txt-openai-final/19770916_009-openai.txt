The nation’s first Clinch River, Tennessee. This will determine our research. $6,000,000,000 directly in nuclear reprocessing and studies, that figure. An effort is being made for the project by the nuclear energy field. The Clinch River Project is a part of our nation’s alternative to deferral. Experiments will continue, but give us the freedom to focus efforts into solar energy. A broad title for any methods of using the sun’s energy is unlimited. Once systems utilize solar energy, unlike mineral energy, it is diffuse and not like a mine or a well. The use of solar energy for space heating and water heating will expand into other areas such as windmills. When technology is ready, 20 percent of all our heating could be solar within the next decade. Progress could be made in utilization. Currently, solar energy, unlike any of the fuels, would impose no risks like those of nuclear energy. Solar heating is competitive with traditional energy. Solar energy has had dollars in research, and the competitive threshold was passed long ago. With real utilization and conservation, solar power generation could provide us a clean energy source.

Meetze maps out Davidson energy measures

Schlesinger is now heading the new Department of Energy. Carter has released his newest energy proposals, and in the quest for enlightenment, the Davidson student ponders the question of an efficient energy plan for his alma mater. There is a higher consciousness of our energy situation. To College administrators, the maintenance and improvement of present systems, as well as planning for Davidson College’s future energy needs, is of much concern.

“Admittedly, we’re wasting energy,” said Director of the Physical Plant Grover C. Meetze, Jr. “Yet we have to be careful about how we spend money to save money in correcting problems.” As outlined by Meetze, the Physical Plant has devised a three-phase plan for energy conservation spread out over the next ten years. The first stage consists of a “conserve-energy-by-the-way-we-use-it” policy. “We are cutting wattage, cutting out some lights throughout the campus, and are anxious to work with a student committee to rework the control cycles which regulate the heating of dorms,” he said. Presently, the heating operates on an “on and off schedule” of one half on and one off at a time.

“We're conscious of the mistakes. For example, the dorms are not heated evenly—the fault of an old control system, but we want to correct the mistakes from a comfort standpoint as well as conservational,” Meetze added. Included in Phase I is a plan to reduce the number of lights in the library, but not so as to affect operation. The library is partially heated by air blowing over coils heated by the lights. Phase II will involve the wide spending of money for worthwhile improvements such as insulating dorms, patching leaks, and insulating steam lines, and the installation of storm windows. The conversion to some other type of energy use will be involved in Phase III. This phase will be achieved gradually as experiments are conducted to test the feasibility of various alternatives. (The Ridge Road solar heated house is one such experiment.)

“The energy-saving situation is not new, we are all aware of it. We are just trying to catch up on the application of it.”

Meetze installs experimental solar heating in Ridge Road house in preparation for future

Director of the Physical Plant Grover C. Meetze has installed experimental solar heating in a college-owned house on Ridge Road. “We’d been looking for a place to set up an experimental project because we believed solar energy has come faster than believed for industrial use than for residential,” he said. He is experimenting with the Ridge Road house “so that we can determine what kind of equipment we buy” for new college buildings.Buildings and to "experiment on our own," said Meetze. The College purchased the house several years ago specifically for this project, according to Meetze, because it has the square footage small enough for a controlled experiment. The house was in a bad state of disrepair and condemned several years ago. After renovating the house, the Physical Plant insulated the walls and roof, and plans to insulate the floor so "they can know just what they have done."

"The way we're installing the solar heating system is that we're putting panels outside so they're easy to reach," he said. The panels are in the southern yard of the house. The sun shining on the panels heats water piped through them. The water is then run through a heat exchanger over air blows and heats up before entering the heating ducts of the house. The panels have a southern exposure and can be rotated enough to follow the sun during winter months, but as low-energy panels, they cannot catch the sun’s energy year-round. Meetze has surrounded the panels with gravel that has a scattering effect and allows the panels to catch more sun rays.

"We have a storage tank to store the heated water when it is not being used," said Meetze. "We want to work out a valve arrangement to regulate and record the amount of energy used." In the event that supplemental heating is needed in the house, Meetze has installed an electrical coil heater over which the air will flow before entering the heating ducts. The electricity used for this will be checked and regulated on a separate meter than that used to measure the solar energy.

"Ultimately we hope to tie this experiment into our control room in E.H. Little Library. We have a control in there that will let us read the temperature on the hour," said Meetze. At present, the only temperature and energy gauge is located in the house. The project is not completed yet, but "we're hurrying to get it ready so we can use it this winter," he said.

Meetze plans to mount a high-temperature solar panel that will follow the sun completely by rotating on an X-Y axis on the roof of the steam plant sometime in the future. "Our idea there is that we can take energy straight into our steam plant," he said. Meetze’s main purpose for the installation and experimentation with solar energy is "to keep some action going on this solar business because the more we can do, the more we can deal with the engineering of new structures on campus," he said. "Some of our new structures will have provisions for solar energy."

Although solar heating is "not a practical installation, from a planning standpoint you cannot put an estimate on it," he said. Solar energy is much more expensive to use than oil, coal, or electricity primarily because of the initial installation cost. "But with the rising cost of oil and coal, this could change overnight," said Meetze. He does not have an estimate of the cost of the panels at the Ridge Road house because the monies used came from his general budget. Meetze hopes solar energy at Davidson will first be used to heat the water used by the College.
