The inaugural Coastal Collegiate Swimming Association turned out to be a meet for the ages for the Wildcat women’s swim team. The women took home the championship Saturday evening with 660 points, out-performing Florida Gulf Coast University (634) and nine other schools. The men also had an excellent showing, producing 741 points to take second place behind College of Charleston (846).

Second-year coach John Young was named Coach of the Year for leading the Wildcat women to the inaugural CCSA title. “We knew that the meet would be close,” Young said. “And if the women embraced the competitive challenge we’d have a chance. It was a great team effort and fun to be a part of.”

First-year phenom Lindsey Martin ’11 led the Wildcats by winning the 50- and 100-meter freestyles (23.62 and 51.12, respectively). Anna Stringfield ’11 offered support in the form of a third-place finish in the 200 backstroke (2:06.13). “I was cautiously hoping to win my events,” Martin said. “I knew there was some pretty tough competition scattered throughout the meet and it would take some work to beat my competitors, and fortunately it all worked out. And I was so happy for John and his being named Coach of the Year. Like the swimmers, he has put so much time and effort into the program that it was great to see him get credit from such a large audience.”

Alanna Ream ’09 finished third in the 1650 freestyle in a time of 17:08.63 and was followed in sixth place by Caitlin Sheetz in 17:32.21. Ineke Stegger ’11, Maddie Stough ’08 and Caroline Curtiss ’10 each qualified for the consolation final in the 200 breaststroke. Stegger and Curtiss placed first and second in the consolation final in the nightcap. Stegger finished ninth with a time of 2:25.23, and Curtiss finished in 10th with a time of 2:28.89.

According to Young, the women also enjoyed excellent leadership from their senior captains, Stough and Kirsten Allen ’08. “They had the women excited to perform all weekend,” Young said admiringly.

The Wildcat men were led by the 400 freestyle team of Fiete Stegger ’08, Miguel Rodriguez ’09, Scott Frantz ’09 and Merrit Peele ’09, who won their race in a school-record time of 3:03.40. Frantz also broke his own school record in the 200 backstroke, riding a time of 1:49.55 to victory. Stegger also broke his own school record, riding a time of 46.43 to second place in the 100 freestyle. Rodriguez placed third in the event with a time of 46.81.

Nate Lander ’10 finished second in the 200 breaststroke in 2:09.41 and was followed by Ben Lucas ’11 sixth place effort (2:14.30). Miller Williams ’10, Robb Broughton ’08 and Adam Topaz ’08 led a Wildcat sweep of positions 3-5 in the 200 flystroke, with times of 1:54.11, 1:56.05 and 1:56.96, respectively.

When asked about the team’s future, Young expressed confidence in his team’s ability to repeat. However, he also wanted to make sure his swimmers appreciated what they had just accomplished. “It is important that we enjoy this feeling for a spell. We’ve just completed a long season and are excited to celebrate it, and reflect on it,” Young said.

Great Saturday, grim Sunday in opening series

The opening weekend for the Wildcat baseball team started with two solid wins against Radford and Georgetown, but Davidson could not win either rematch on Sunday, which brought the team’s early season record to 2-2. Stellar pitching performances on Saturday allowed the Wildcats to beat Radford 8-3. Zac Long ’08 made his return tothe mound after two years of injury and rehab from Tommy John’s Surgery prevented him from starting. Long made the most of the opportunity, allowing three runs in five innings of work and hurling five strikeouts. Chris Kennedy ’10 and Mike Frongello ’11 relieved Long and held Radford scoreless to finish out the game. The Wildcat bats also pitched in to secure the win. The top of the order for the Wildcats set the pace. Singles by Hugh Eden ’08 and Brett Shore ’09, followed by a walk for Pre-season All SoCon selection Zack Kayne ’09 loaded the bases in the bottom of the first. Chase FitzPatrick ’09 hit a two-run double to drive in Eden and Shore. FitzPatrick would later stroke a solo shot and a single to go 3-4 in the game with three RBIs. Matt Webb ’09, the other Wildcat to receive Pre-season All SoCon honors, followed FitzPatrick with a two-run single but injured himself on the play and had to leave the game. After this four-run first, the Wildcats never looked back, tacking on four more scores, including a Jay Honeycutt ’10 home run, to close the game 8-3.

Thomas Middour ’10 started the nightcap for the ’Cats against Georgetown and held the Hoyas to only two runs in five innings. Mac Hunter ’11 and Frongello closed the game; Hunter gave up one run while Frongello shut the door on the Hoyas for his first career save. Although the weather cooled, the bats didn’t. Designated hitter Danny Weiss ’11 continued his college debut with a 2-4 performance against Georgetown, adding to his first game performance to hit 4-7 with a double and five RBIs between the two games. Two squeeze plays in the eighth extended an 8-3 lead to the final 10-3 margin.

Unfortunately, the tables turned for the Wildcats on Sunday, with Davidson losing 13-2 against Georgetown and 20-3 against Radford. In the morning game, Erick Fernandez was 4-for-5 and Sean Lamont went 3-for-4 with a homer and four RBIs to lead the Hoyas over the Wildcats. Georgetown scored five runs in the second and four in the fifth to leap to an enormous 13-0 advantage. Davidson broke its scoring drought on a two-run home run by Honeycutt but could not manage to tack any more runs to the team total. Radford right fielder Reggie Keen went 5-6 with four RBIs and four runs scored to lead his team against Davidson. Shortstop Ben Toth added to the offensive showcase with a 4-6 performance that drove in three runners.

“We learned that guys are going to have to step up in roles they are not accustomed to and perform and that everyone on the team is going to play a factor in winning games,” Kayne said. “Hopefully we can learn from our games this weekend and use them to prepare for the many games coming up in the next two weeks.” The Wildcats will return to the Wilson Field diamond at 4 p.m. on Wednesday against Virginia Tech.
