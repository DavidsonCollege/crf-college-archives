JANUARY 28 DATE SET FOR PRELIMINARIES

At a meeting held Monday afternoon, the Debating Council decided on the dates for holding the preliminaries and finals for the intercollegiate debating teams. The preliminaries will be held in the respective society halls on Monday night, January 28, and the four men selected in each society on that night will contest in the finals two weeks later, on Monday night, February 11. The two teams will be chosen at this time. The subject for the preliminaries will be, “Resolved, ‘That the successful prosecution of the war demands that all citizens of Germany, Austria, Bulgaria and Turkey, now residing in the United States, be interned for the period of the war.” This is the query that will be used in the debate with LaFayette College. The Council is still at work on the details of the two debates. The debate with LaFayette will be held on March 22, but the place has not yet been settled. The debate with Roanoke College will be held at about the same time, at Davidson. The subject for this debate will be decided within the next week or two, and will be used in the finals. This is the first time in years that a debate has been held where the students can attend, and the Council places it here with the hope that a greater interest in intercollegiate debating may be aroused.

MEETINGS WERE POSTPONED.

Owing to the coldness of the Philanthropic Society Hall there was no meeting of the society Saturday night. The Eumenean's program consisted only of the roll call due to the fact that so few of the Freshmen who were to be initiated were present. The initiation will be held next Saturday night. The program for the Phi Society, Saturday night, is as follows:

Debate—Affirmative: J. W. Clark, A. L. Foscue, C. Howell.
Negative: W. C. Cumming, H. C. Hamilton, D. W. Roberts.
Orations: O. P. Hart, R. E. McClure, T. C. Misenheimer.
Extemporaneous debate—Affirmative: S. M. Davis.
Negative: H. T. Lilly.

The subject for the regular debate is: “Resolved, That the Federal Government should permanently own and operate the railroads.”"ate all interstate railroads of the United States." Dr. J. W. Bradley, of Suchien, China, will address the Y. M. C. A. meeting tomorrow night at 6:45. Dr. Bradley has charge of a large hospital in China and tells of his experiences in an interesting manner. He is a good speaker, and all who hear him are sure to like him.

**DINNER GIVEN "D" MEN BY COACH FETZER**

Coach Fetzer delightfully entertained the famous football team at a dinner last Tuesday evening. All were present except J. A. Shaw. Drs. Douglas and Arbuckle, of the faculty, were also present. The team had broken training and proceeded to enjoy the delicious repast without restraint. As there were no after-dinner speeches, everybody was at ease and none were rendered uncomfortable. All left feeling that the season’s hardships had been rewarded.

Friends will be glad to know that Professor Currie and Mr. Jackson are out again after a few days’ confinement. Dr. Martin and Professor Reed have also been unwell for a few days.

All the “D” men!
