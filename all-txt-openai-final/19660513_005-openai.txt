‘Cats Romp Foes In SC Tourneys

Netmen Conquer Conference

The Davidson netmen scored a record 36 points in amassing a clean sweep of competition in the Southern Conference tournament
Wednesday in Richmond. Entering the tournament favored heavily and seeded first in all divisions except the number one singles and
number three doubles, the ‘Cats swept all their matches to break GW’s old record of 33 points.

Second-seeded Bill Council upset GW's Tom Morgan, 3-6, 6-0, 6-0, in the number one singles attraction. Although he injured his
foot during the match, Morgan still played well, according to Coach Harry Fogleman. Raymond Pucind got past Larry Little of
GW, 8-6, 6-2, 6-2, in the number two finals. In other action, Sam Archer downed Richmond’s Burch Cates in three
sets, Dick Hurd downed Bob Murdock of GW, 6-3, 6-1, Pier Parrott put down Terry Benbow of the Colonials, 6-4,
6-2, and Woody Faulk smashed Wally Beabenista of William and Mary in straight 6-1 sets.

Council and Parrott led the ‘Cats’ attack in the doubles department with a 6-4, 10-8 victory over twins Richard and
Edward Field. Playing Tuesday morning, the weather was tough, according to Fogleman. “It was 44 degrees, and there was a
21-mph wind. It was tough to serve the ball, and there was a crosswind, which made it worse. That afternoon
it warmed up to 45, and the wind died down a bit.”

In Monday's action, the ‘Cats lost a total of one out of 17 sets played in walking away to a
substantial early lead. Phelps was the culprit, as he dropped one of the three sets in beating Brock of West
Virginia in a 2-6, 6-3, 6-0 win. Tuesday saw the Wildcats sweep the finals and clinch victory after only two
days of play. Council earned his chance to face the top-seeded Morgan by besting Frank Cooke of East Carolina, 6-1,
6-1. Council and Parrott moved through Eddie God and FAM of Furman, 6-4, to gain the finals. Twenty-seven points were
enough to win the tournament, and the Wildcats already had that. The only thing left to do was to sweep
the finals, and they did that, too. Hines of VMI, Hatcher, and Phelps triumphed over Owen and Sollenberger of GW,
6-4, 6-0, and Faulk and Hurd downed Moss and Beabenista of William and Mary, 7-5, 6-1.

George Washington finished second again this year with 19 points, followed by William and Mary with 17, East Carolina with
14, Richmond and VMI with 12, Furman with nine, and The Citadel and West Virginia with eight. Coach Fogleman commented
that he was very pleased with the ‘Cats’ performance, as they lost only two sets in the finals. He also
praised Hatcher for his performance.

It goes without saying that Davidson is unaccustomed to hearing about all the conference tournaments we win. And the double
shot of victory was really not anticipated because of the de facto blackout of reporting from Southern Pines by the
wire services. Only a few here knew of our first-day lead there, so it was a shock for many to
find out how badly we swept both tournaments. On paper, there was a great likelihood of our sweeping the tennis
tournament, but yet almost everyone held their breath hoping only that we would win it.

Three conference championships in one year. We're still a long way from being the little giants of the Southern, but
just wait.

Maybe it was the sullen, overcast sky which gave the day a look of sadness, or the fewness of the
nine players on the immense field, or maybe it was Tom Stevens’ disappointment which was obvious from a look at
the turnout for yesterday’s baseball practice. No doubt much has been said about the problems of this year's team and
about the baseball program. They will finish this year with an 11-23 record after tomorrow's doubleheader with Furman, and this
will be the second straight year that we have done poorly. But this is also the second straight year that
people who could have reversed that record decided that baseball was a drag, and cut out for greener pastures or
sandier beaches.

All is not bleak. Coach Stevens can look to next year. North of the tennis courts lies what could be
the best college baseball field in this area. Dr. Mebane calls it one of his best engineering jobs at Davidson
elsewhere in this issue. “A diamond is a diamond, but this could be a facility of which Davidson could be
proud. It needs a dugout and a fence to exclude stray dogs and golfers. It needs some permanent plans for
spectator seating. There is no grassy knoll to sit on if portable stands are filled. This diamond should be a
boon to the baseball program at Davidson. The offense should be helped because the farther outposts of the outfield will
be within bombing range of our sluggers, too. The present diamond is immense compared to the new park's dimensions of
320 down the lines and 360 to dead center. But what would be a bigger help to Davidson baseball is
an assistant coach. Surely our freshman program is weak. Football is a great detractor of athletic freshmen. But another baseball
coach would give the baseball staff a chance to do some recruiting and scouting as well as helping freshmen develop
their pre-varsity skills. We think it's time to fix this deficiency. Heath Whittle will have Sterling Martin on his staff
next year, and it is time that we give baseball a chance to help itself, too.

Baseballers Close Season With Paladin Doubleheader Tomorrow

SOUTHERN PINES — Fighting high winds and bitter cold the first day and a serious challenge from the rest of
the field on the second, the Wildcat golfers clubbed their way to a victory in the Southern Conference tournament here
on Tuesday and Wednesday.

Led by medalist Doug McKeever at 160 and runner-up medalist George Leight at 161, the ‘Cats roared away from their
opponents and topped William and Mary, their closest competitor, by 21 strokes. George Brower, runner-up through the first day’s action,
finished as third lowest scorer, and Joe Jelks tied for fourth to ensure the victory.

Early scores from Wednesday's round gave Dr. Tom Scott several moments of uneasiness, as the Indians began to close the
gap. All the marbles lay in how the two teams played the back side of the monstrous Country Club of
North Carolina course, and here the ‘Cats met the challenge. Early reports indicated that Leight was coming in with a
terrific back nine, but it was too early to tell until Leight approached the 18th green and rapped in an
eight-footer for a birdie, giving him a one-under-par 35 on the back side and a 77 for the day. Then
came medalist-to-be McKeever and one could see the anxiety in Dr. Scott's face slowly change to one of happiness as
McKeever tapped in for a 78. The tournament was in the bag, as Jelks and Brower followed with 83s for
164 and 162 respectively. John Giles and Champ Covington found the course a little demanding and shot respective scores of
88 and 95 Wednesday, although Giles was “hitting the ball pretty well for 48.”

The victory was really a team effort, as evidenced by the close bunching of scores after the first day despite
terrible weather conditions. Such a bunching of scores is advantageous to a team because if a man should have a
bad day in the second round, one of his teammates could be counted in his place, since only the top
four scores count.

In mid-June, the golfers will go to the NCAA tourney in Pasadena, Calif. The victory marked the fourth golf championship
in Davidson's history and the third since Dr. Scott took the helm.reins 11 years ago. McKeever joins Bucky Dennis and
Verner Stanley as Davidson's medalists over these years. Asked about how it looked at the outcome, Jalks commented, “We were
real fortunate to have the individual champion in Doug McKeever. Leight did a great job with one under on the
back. Brewer deserves a lot of credit for putting the pressure on Ed Grimble, the first day’s medalist, causing him
to soar to a real high score.” “It's a wonderful, hard course,” added McKeever. It was a lot harder for
the other eight teams.

WINNING'S AS EASY AS: Henry Wilmer is scheduled to start for Davidson. Saturday at West Virginia's Hawley Field in Morgantown,
the Mountaineers took two Southern Conference contests from the ‘Cats, 6-1 and 7-0. Howard Bryon was the victim of the
first game. Henry Wilmer, who started, took the loss. Again the Cats had stick trouble as only Skip Waite and
Dick Lindsey could solve the Mountaineer pitchers. In the first game, Waite singled to drive in Lindsey with the ‘Cats’
only run after Lindsey had singled to open the inning. In the second game, Waite boomed a double, which was
the team’s only hit in the contest. After seeing a baseball game in Baltimore Sunday, the ‘Cats went to William
and Mary with blood in their eyes. But the ‘Cats could not handle the Indians. Charlie Elliott pitched the first
game, but it was a 5-0 shutout.

Gridmen To Spring Practice

Tomorrow the Davidson football squad will take the field for the last time this spring, concluding drills which began on
April 11, with a scrimmage on Richardson Field's gridiron at 4 p.m. Faced with a shortage in numbers and some
key graduation losses, these Wildcats have responded with spirit and determination, effecting improvement in every phase of the game. Coach
Homer Smith said, “I have been extremely pleased with their willingness to work and be a good football team. At
the start, our biggest problem was helping each other. We didn’t have a ‘hamburger squad’ like the larger schools have.
But we solved this problem and had a good spring practice.”

CLOSE EVALUATION
Coach Smith pointed out that he and his staff have evaluated the squad very closely, to be sure of taking
advantage of everyone's abilities. He cited the performance of certain players as being strong points. “We are pleased with the
option play running of Jimmy Poole. Second, our defensive backfield of Roan Gruber, Tommy Caldwell, Jake Fronbsen, Tommy Dews, and
Dick Lindsey will have experience and ability. We are well pleased with the ability of our pass receivers—William Rikard, Greg
Cox, Pete Gildemeister, Caldwell, and Gruber—to get open and catch the ball. Also, along the defensive line, Joe Gaddy, Tupper
Morehead, and Buddy Newsome will give us experience.”

At the beginning of drills, the offensive line had the biggest gap to close due to graduation losses. But with
Walter Greene anchoring the line, Gary Waldron and Joe Murphy manning the guard slots, and Kit Thompson at center, the
gap has been closed. Now they have no further to go in September to be ready than any other group.

KICKING SACRIFICED
Work on the kicking game was sacrificed. However, Caldwell ranked second in the conference in 1965 in punting, and Felks
Glidewell is expected to assume Jim Terry's chores capably. Jacobsen, who will play both ways next fall, expressed the feeling
that the spring season had been rough but profitable. He said, “There was good spirit, and you could notice improvement.
Tommy Dews did especially well, but everybody showed improvement as practice progressed.”

ALTERED OFFENSE
While the only changes made on defense concern fundamental ways of playing it, the Wildcat offense will look different. Next
fall the Wildcats will run from a three-back I-formation, with a spread end and a wing back who may be
in tight or split wide as a flankerback. Coach Smith concluded, “Next year we will be thinner in numbers than
any future Davidson team. It is almost certain that Walter Greene and Tommy Dews will receive All-Conference recognition. But we
will make no apologies for the way we play. We should have a good squad.”
