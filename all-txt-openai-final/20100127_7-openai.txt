THE BOCUS ISSUE

Belk—In an effort to recruit
more men to become hall coun-
selors, the Resident Life Office
has made significant changes to
the application process for men.
The application will no longer ask
such trivial questions as “Why do
you want to be a hall counselor?” or
“How will you manage your time
as a hall counselor?” Instead, male
applicants will be given questions
such as, “What is your favorite
Clint Eastwood movie?” and “Who
is hotter, Jessica Alba or Shakira?”

This got your attention, didn’t it?
This is an example of how effec-
tive the new RLO policies are.

Furthermore, RLO has changed
its workshops to be more attrac-
tive to men. Administrators and
RLO veterans alike claim the new
programming is more realistic,
effective, and relevant for the Da-
vidson male. For example, the
“How to deal with finding alcohol
in a freshman’s mini fridge” ex-
ercise has been replaced with the
“Tackle and manhandle the
abusive drunk” workshop. The
“Mouth-to-mouth on a freshman
girl” exercise in particular has
been successful. Attendance and
participation in that workshop is
unparalleled in the history of ori-
entation programming, not just at
Davidson but in the entire world.

These changes have proven to
be quite successful. Applications
to be a male hall counselor have
skyrocketed in the past few days.
Even men who do not attend this
college have applied! Many males
have lauded the school’s attempts
to reach out to them and are apply-
ing in droves.

“I feel very encouraged by the
fact that the school is trying to
reach out to my gender,” said one
junior applicant.

“I just wanna beat up drunk
guys and get to first base with
freshmen girls!” said another.
Whether or not this surge in inter-
est will last, however, remains to
be seen.

College Slacker Boasts Highest
GPA Among Slacker Friends

Ryburn—All bets are
off in one of the college’s
least-contested academic
bouts in recent decades.
After 3 semesters of ly-
ing to his parents about
his grades, Davidson
College junior Pat “The
Sandman” Critchlow has
scraped together
a GPA capable of
causing them only
minimal concern. Though his
slightly elevated GPA is not entirely
impressive on its own, Pat has ev-
ery intention of comparing it to his
friends’ only recently lower ones in
order to make himself look smarter.

“So, like, Harrison used to have a
pretty decent GPA and I had to tell
mom and dad that I was ridin’ on a
2.3 just to get them off my back,”
Critchlow explained, puffing on
an unlit cigarette. “But
after I showed him how
to watch Cops for free
online, he didn’t go to
class for about a week
and half. I’m pretty
sure that’s what got me
ahead.

Basking in his rela-
tive omniscience,
Pat intends to
celebrate by par-
taking in two successive weeks of
champions and visiting his buddy
Kyle at Wake; both put him in grave
danger of slipping back down the
slacker totem pole. Pat, however, is
not concerned.

“Instead of fitting my life around
school, I try to fit school around my
life,” Pat philosophized to me. “Be-
sides, my dad’s pretty loaded so I
think I’m cool to chill for a while.”

Chambers—Class harder than
you thought it would be? RateMy
Professor giving you false reviews
or inaccurate information? Use of a
simple new equation may allow you
to more easily determine the ease of
the class you’re in.

Here’s the process: Add up the
number of football, basketball, and
baseball players in your class. Di-
vide that number by the number of
kids that are not forced to sit in the
front row. Now take your answer
and multiply it by the number of
kids in the class that you could
imagine playing frisbee golf, or
anyone that has ever referred to it
as ‘disc golf.’ This should get you a
pretty accurate number for the ease
of your class.

Football + Basketball + Baseball
Kids in front row

Classes like ‘Pirates and Their
Booty’ should get you numbers
like 10 (5 football, 3 basketball, 2
baseball, 2 front row, 2 ‘discers’).
Courses of this type generally have
few graded assignments, and final
grades may be up to 80% reliant on
the laughable “class participation”
criterion. Classes of Ease 5 and up
lack cumulative finals or long
presentations. A course like ‘Ad-
vanced Chemistry of Econometrics
in Ancient Greek,’ however, ranks
at Ease 0 due to its 8:30 lab peri-
ods 6 days per week.

(Frisbee Golf Students) x Ease of Class

This incredible new formula allows subpar students to excel
in environments of mediocrity

The formula does have its short-
comings, researchers warned. A
few things to keep in mind when
using this formula: this formula is
void (and the class is hard) when
there are two or more people in the
class hailing from the Orient. If
this math is too complex for you,
drop out of Calculus I right now.
