**Grid Cats suffer disappointment in homecoming game after encouraging win over Methodist**

By Robert Lloyd-Still

On a beautiful day for homecoming with 2,500 fans in attendance, Randolph-Macon upended Davidson in a nerve-wracker. The Cats led the entire game until Yellow Jackets quarterback Andrew Bush and receiver David Hughes connected on a 21-yard catch. That completion gave Randolph-Macon a 21-16 victory.

Davidson appeared to have this game wrapped up with a 16-7 lead and only 3:49 left to play. The Cats were unable to stop Hughes and the Randolph-Macon passing game defeated Davidson in the end. Special teams also hurt the Cats in this game. After halftime, the Cats allowed a 98-yard kickoff return to Dexter Hurt.

When the game appeared over with thirty seconds to play, Quarterback Richard Howell provided the Cats with a glimmer of hope. He hooked up with Ike Bailey on a 42-yard fly pattern. Howell then ran the ball eight yards to the Yellow Jackets' 33. With seventeen seconds to try and score a touchdown, Howell threw the ball up to Kelly Shirley in the end zone. The pass was close but Randolph-Macon defensive back Dwayne Elmore intercepted to end the game.

Howell played another strong game in his illustrious career at Davidson. He completed 13 passes out of 24 attempts for 216 yards and one touchdown. On the ground, Howell scampered for a 38-yard touchdown that appeared to put the Cats up for good.

Davidson really wanted this game especially for Head Coach Landis who played his collegiate football at Randolph-Macon. “The kids played hard and deserved better, but that’s not the way it worked out,” Landis commented. “We had respect for the passing game, but they did a great job of making the play when they had to so maybe the law of averages caught up with us.”

The week before this devastating loss, Davidson handed Methodist a 34-7 beating. The game was over fall break with few students in attendance, but the Cats played for pride. The Cats’ record now stands at 4-3 and they really want to finish above five hundred this season. Davidson students are not the only ones who have recognized a dramatic improvement in the football team this season. Ron Green of the Charlotte Observer wrote two weeks ago that noted the improvement. The Cats hope to rebound this coming week when they face Hampden-Sydney at 1:30 at Richardson Field.

**Women's soccer draws even after weekend of hard play**

The women’s soccer team evened its record to 8-8-1 with losses to the University of Dayton and Campbell University and an overtime win over the University of Louisville. The Wildcats spent fall break on the road, first traveling to Dayton. Field conditions were terrible after a steady rain that continued to fall throughout most of the game. The strong Dayton squad, who recently tied powerhouse University of Virginia, handed Davidson a 4-2 loss.

The team then traveled to the University of Louisville. Down 2-0 at the half, the Wildcats came out aggressive in the second and sent the game to overtime at 3-3. Sophomore Claudia Lombard, who had scored all three of Davidson’s goals in regulation, also put in the game-winner during overtime. “The game against Louisville was exciting because it was the only time we’ve come back to win this season,” said freshman Lucia Plosser.

The Wildcats then faced Campbell here at Davidson last Saturday. Davidson had more shots on goal than Campbell but couldn’t put the ball in. Campbell took the contest 3-1. “We haven’t won the games we needed to, like the Campbell game, to get ranked in the region. We have the talent, we just haven’t executed,” said senior Jenny Satterfield.

The team will finish up its season this weekend with a game against Virginia Tech, who beat the Wildcats earlier in the season 2-1. “They weren’t as skilled as we were. We weren’t playing smart in our last game with them, though. We missed some opportunities in the last game, and if we play well we should win this time. It would be a great way to end the season,” said Satterfield.

Adding to her comments was sophomore Katie Schwab. "The team has really worked hard this year; we've given all we have. To finish with a winning season wouldn't be what we'd hope for earlier, but it also wouldn't be a huge disappointment."

The field hockey team had a busy Homecoming Weekend as they played both Wake Forest and Radford University. On Saturday, the Wildcats traveled to Winston-Salem for their last game on turf this season. Davidson played one of the best turf games they have played all year, but the Demon Deacons outscored the Wildcats, winning the game 3-2.

Sunday afternoon, Davidson faced Radford, one of the team’s biggest rivals. Once again, the Wildcats played strongly, but they could not come up with the win. The two teams battled through regulation time plus two overtime periods, with the final score ending up in a 1-1 tie.

The Wildcats' loss to Wake Forest was an especially disappointing one because the team dominated the first half of the game. Davidson was playing extremely offensively, taking numerous shots and pouncing on the Wake goalie. With about ten minutes left in the first half, sophomore Holly Kledis scored with a hard shot on goal. With this lead, the Wildcats gained confidence and ended the half with momentum and enthusiasm.

However, in the second half, Wake caught some of that energy and scored fairly early. Davidson started playing defensively and with more caution, and the Deacons scored two more goals (one as the result of an unfortunate oversight made by the referee). The Wildcats did not give up, however, and they turned on the offensive pressure once again. With about five minutes left in the game, Erin Lang scored one of her picture-perfect penalty strokes, hitting the upper right-hand corner of the goal-cage. Davidson continued to push up offensively, but they could not get the ball in the cage, giving Wake a 3-2 victory.

After this loss, Davidson was more determined than ever to obliterate Radford, a team they have never beaten. Back on their home field, the Wildcats played with intensity and aggression, and despite Radford’s dirty tactics, the Cats...

Cat Nips: Jason Byasee
Complaining & Whining About Sports

I must confess to feeling somewhat bummed, and certainly not very sportsmanlike. The Davidson football team just left its heart on the field versus Randolph-Macon, only to watch the Yellow Jackets win on a last-minute touchdown pass. Rats. Watching Davidson lose, combined with the fact that I’m sitting in front of a computer screen during homecoming weekend, has left me, well, bitter.

So, while we’re on the subject of bitterness, it's time to talk about everything that I don’t like about sports nowadays. When you see me this week, stop me and let me know whether you agreed with me or not, at least that’ll let me know whether you read the ole’ “Cat Nips” section. Here goes:

The NCAA is just doing a poor job in its governance of college basketball. Before this season, the NCAA decided to delay the beginning of the hoops season by two weeks, so that practice begins on November 1 instead of October 15. They also voted to cut the number of basketball scholarships a school could award from 15 to 13, and to limit the number of assistant coaches a program may hire.

Now, granted I don’t know the whole reasoning behind the adjustments, but I reckon they’re trying to pare down the ever-growing stature of the game, to help keep college basketball programs from becoming semi-pro organizations rather than humble participants in intercollegiate athletics. The real result is that fewer high school basketball stars are gonna be able to play college basketball without the scholarship help, and that fewer young coaches are gonna be able to find coaching positions.

Now, if those things don’t seem like a big deal, consider the view of many black college coaches, that fewer African-American kids will be able to go to a good college at all, due to the cut in scholarships. Is college basketball somehow now better because two fewer kids per school will get a free education out of basketball? Is the game better because fewer young coaches will get the chance of a job at the college level?

College basketball is going to continue to grow, certainly nationally and maybe even internationally. Cutting the allowance of funding or practice days will accomplish nothing, and the NCAA either needs to reevaluate its options or else explain something to me.

Now, onto complaint number two. Why the heck is Major League Baseball doing this whole realignment thing? Since my dad was a kid, there have been four divisions, and the best team from each, after 162 games, gets to go to the playoffs. So even though the San Francisco Giants won the second most games in baseball this year, they...
