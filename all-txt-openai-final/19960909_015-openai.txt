### Odyssey ’96 | Intramurals expand under new leadership

#### An Epic Adventure
By Kerry Brophy
Staff Writer

The Odyssey program drew to a close on August 18, attracting 113 freshmen from all over the nation. Participants traveled
to Davidson for each of the six Odyssey sessions running throughout the summer to enjoy a week-long outdoor adventure including
hiking, canoeing, and a service project. The summer officially concluded after consuming 104 lbs. of cheese, 515 lbs. of gorp,
and 700 bagels. Participants hiked an average of 24 miles, paddled nearly 14 miles, and left having gained an immeasurable
number of new friendships and wild tales.

"I wish I was still on the Odyssey. The memories I have will last a lifetime," Tonya Werner claimed. Many
freshmen emphasized the importance of having a week to become acquainted with fellow classmates in a challenging and dynamic setting.
Participants confronted many experiences as a group, from setting up camp and cooking meals, to learning to cope with rain
and a challenging hike up the trail. Likewise, the Odyssey provided a unique opportunity for self-discovery and contemplation of the
coming four years at Davidson.

Davidson students who led this summer's trips say the Odyssey was an invaluable experience for them, as well. "It felt
great to be part of an experience in which freshmen had the opportunity to meet physical challenges, make new friends,
and relax a bit before freshmen orientation," senior Stephen Elliot said.

The summer of 1996 also marked a special time in the history of the Odyssey program. This is the first
year for Davidson Outdoors to offer sessions throughout the summer, thus allowing more new students to be involved. Ed Daugherty,
who directs Davidson Outdoors with his wife Marlys, said that this year provided a more complete experience for freshmen than
in the past. "For me, it was as powerful an experience as the first time I ran it," he said.

The summer of 1996 has given way to classes, sports, and the daily dramas of college life. Yet many members
of the class of 2000 are reminded of the Odyssey not only by the bug bites and blisters that still
won’t fade away, but by the still-lingering thrill of meeting new challenges and new friends.

Five new sports, an ultimate champion, and a web page — these are the exciting changes coming this year in
intramurals. The students’ desire for more intramural sports has been addressed. Thanks to the hard work of Noni Nielsen and
other members of the Intramural Council, intramurals have exploded onto the Davidson sports scene this school year, with the number
of sports offered nearly doubling.

Students can now participate in individual tennis, racquetball, and golf tournaments in addition to the traditional sports of flickerball, basketball,
softball, volleyball, and indoor soccer. Outdoor soccer will start in the spring. There will even be a swim meet. "We
wanted to get more people of all athletic abilities involved," said Nielsen.

Perhaps the most intriguing addition to intramurals will be the "overall champion." In past years, each sport was played separately
and the winning team would receive t-shirts. Now, however, there is an elaborate scoring system that will champion will represent
fraternities, freshman halls, and independent teams. At the end of the year, the freshman hall...and the fraternity/independent team with the
highest point totals will each receive the grand prize. For the latest game results and upcoming events, students will now
be able to call up the Intramural Web page (www.davidson.edu\athletics\imac!). And for those not computer-oriented, there is going to be
a new intramural board in the front lobby of Chambers also displaying scores, game schedules, point standings, and highlights. Teams
that compete for grand prize compile all the points different teams tally during the year.

Rugby tops 49ers

“Considering it was our first game situation, we played well. We have strong props and fast backs,” said second row
player Roger Mills. “We will be the team to beat.”

Muddy conditions caused by Hurricane Fran forced the rugby team’s first scrimmage versus UNC Charlotte to be moved to the
flickerball fields. But that didn’t stop the Wildcats from prevailing, 20-5. Davidson was led by fly half Hank Ackerman who
scored two tries despite suffering a nose injury. Wings Jason Cody and Matt Burkhardt also scored tries for the Wildcats,
and Warren Buford played well in his first game at scrum half.

Soccer drops game in overtime

Spartanburg, SC — The women’s soccer team was sky high after last weekend’s rousing win over South Carolina. But it
came down with a thud on Saturday, losing at Wofford, 1-0 in overtime.

“In a nutshell, we didn’t come prepared to play,” said coach Kevin Hundley. “There was a letdown from the week
before and we didn’t focus as well as we could have. To Wofford’s credit, they were ready to play. It’s
very disappointing.”

The game’s lone goal came three minutes into the extra period when Ginger Applegate deflected an Emily Olmstead pass into
the lower left corner. Davidson’s best chance to equalize came just minutes later when sweeper Amy Balsinger gathered a crossing
pass in front of goal and blasted a shot barely tipped over the crossbar by Terrier goalie Ileana Moschos.
