Dry Humor

(A Restless Summer in Southern California)

Wind whips across my face,
cuts like a knife
but draws no blood.
Damned Santa Ana winds.
Where are you when I need you, Jim Bowie?
Your knife cut deep ——
drew good red blood.

Now the knife glitters in my hand.
At twenty it’s time to cut some ties,
a nervous surgeon preparing to seek the heart.

My thoughts are desert dry and deathly sterile.

The knife is keen, but the hand is shaky.
I shut my eyes against the stinging sand;
tears come against my will.

I need to leave home, to head up north,
but I'll settle for a cold beer
and a quick prayer
for rain.

Lee Torrence '83

The Highway

Like a long, white leg cast,
it lies heavily upon the ground,
stitched to it with twine
of dried mustard and strips of gristle,
compacting miles of rich muddy colors
and falling among families of trees,
dividing them with its wrath.

It gnashes into the sides of soft, pillowy hills,
leaving rough scars, swollen and red.
And all the while, unnoticed plants
come protesting through its cracks,
frantically pushing up for air.
