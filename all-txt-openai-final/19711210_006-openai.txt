**Local Players To Present ‘Superstar’**

“Jesus Christ, Superstar” is coming to Davidson.

Dr. Anthony Abbot, Professor of English and temporary director of the Davidson Community Players, has announced that the Players will
perform the controversial rock-opera for their annual winter production.

The Community Players are made up of those members of the college community, such as professors and their families, who
are not normally able to participate in the dramatic productions of the student body. The community group augments the three
yearly productions of the students with its own winter and summer presentations.

Abbot said that the community dramatists “should easily respond to the mood and the spirit of ‘Superstar.’ The Davidson community
is overflowing with latent musical and dramatic talent, a surprising wealth of stage ability. This is a town full of
hams.”

The play itself demands such talent, according to Abbot. “‘Superstar’ is a difficult play to perform, for it involves intricate
technical, musical, and dramatic work. It is, of course, one of the best pieces of drama produced in this century,
and this is why we've chosen it for our winter production.”

Cast in the lead role as Christ is Dr. Earl MacCormac, a member of Davidson’s philosophy department and one of
the community’s foremost handball players.

“MacCormac is perfect for the part of the Superstar,” Abbot commented. “He already has a feel for the role, a
natural portrayal of the Messiah, and it appears that the role was made for him and he for the role.”

Judas, the antagonist in the story, will be played by H. Edmunds White, Director of Admissions. White, who played the
executioner in the stage production of “A Tale of Two Cities” and performed as Simon Legree in “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,”
is considered by Abbot as a natural for the role of Jesus’ betrayer.

Sara Penland, a college secretary, has been chosen to play the voluptuous Mary Magdalene. The role was given to Mrs.
Penland over the more experienced Mary Earnhardt “because of the depth of feeling and sensitivity Sara has displayed in practices,”
Abbot said.

Pontius Pilate, the Roman military governor, will be played by Dr. Sam Maloney, Professor of Religion, while showman C. Shaw
Smith, Director of the College Union, will play the mocking, prancing Herod, the local king.

Caiaphas, the Jewish high priest who runs the country from behind the scenes, will be played by John M. Bevan,
Vice-president of Academic Affairs, in his Davidson stage debut. Dr. Charles Lloyd, Professor of English, will play the disciple Peter,
while Drs. George Abernathy, E. E. Brown, Lawrence Kimbrough, Chalmers Davidson, and James Reid will perform as the rest of
the disciples.

Ralph Quakenbusch will conduct the nine-piece orchestra and the 79-member kazoo band, while Dr. Ernie Patterson, Professor of Economics, will
be in charge of costumes.

Because the play, by virtue of its radical interpretation of the life of a sacred religious figure, will probably incite
some public protest, Abbot has appointed William Jackson of the political science department and Dr. Sandy McKelway, Professor of Religion,
to serve as consultants for public relations.

**India Cancels JYA Program**

The Junior Year Abroad Program at the University of Baroda, India has been cancelled by the Indian Government, “at least
for the academic year 1972-73," according to President Samuel R. Spencer Jr.

In an airmail letter received yesterday, Deputy Assistant Minister for Educational Exchange S. N. Lohia explained “that relations between our
two countries do not allow the inauguration at this time of the exchange program between Davidson College and the University
of Baroda.

“We hope that conditions conducive to the proposed exchange will be re-established in time for the 1973-74 university year,” Lohia
continued.

Spencer expressed shock that the Indian Government had decided to cancel the program. “I am amazed that the Indians approved
the program only a few weeks ago and then destroyed the work of both Davidson and Baroda personnel who worked
so hard to get the program ready for next year.”

Assistant Professor Frederick Gaige, director of the South Asian Program, thought that the cancellation was in retaliation for the American
Government’s freezing of uncommitted aid funds in the pipeline. “I think that it is quite obvious that JYA in India
is one of the casualties of the Indo-Pakistani War.”

Lohia’s statement about the relations between the U.S. and the Indian governments seems to refer to the aid cut-off and
to statements by the State Department critical of India’s position. “It’s a pity that they chose exchange programs as a
means to retaliate, though,” Gaige said.

A Sagittarian likes to share his good vibes. Even his drink. Sagittarians are good-vibes people. And Schlitz Malt Liquor goes
down well with Sagittarians. Because Schlitz Malt Liquor is Taurus, the Bull. Known for its dependable good taste, and sociability.

People under your sign love freedom and like to take on a challenge. Taking a risk doesn't bother you. You're
independent and spirited. You say whatever you think, and sometimes you can be pretty blunt. Despite the fact that you're
plain spoken, people like you because you’re gifted with bright optimism and an uncanny intuition. And there's nothing you like
better than sharing your ideas with friends.

Your ruling planet, Jupiter, gives you a lively, almost compulsive interest in people. And people sharing good times is what
Schlitz Malt Liquor is all about. You always introduce your friends to the Bull, because he's got the stuff you
admire. Sagittarius and the Bull—you’re both brave, bold, and proud.

Nobody makes malt liquor like Schlitz. Nobody.
