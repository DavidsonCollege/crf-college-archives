**Investigation into Sig Ep incident still underway**
By Naresh Nagella
Senior Staff Writer

Last week, The Davidsonian printed an article in its Police Blotter claiming that a student, freshman Brett Kirkpatrick, was assaulted
at Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity during a Jan. 23 party. It later came to be known that the reporter, freshman
Scott Geiger, did not read the police report before writing the story and only printed the testimony of his friend,
Kirkpatrick. Specifically at issue were the presence of an illegal (at Court parties) beer bottle and previous Sig Ep President
Tripp Franklin’s involvement in the altercation. A Davidsonian investigation into the night’s events has attempted to clarify the story.

Kirkpatrick reports that as he was leaving Sig Ep, he bumped into a noticeably intoxicated Franklin, saying “Excuse me.” (Many
observers claimed Kirkpatrick was intoxicated as well. And Kirkpatrick, who is under the legal drinking age, does admit to being
offered champagne and beer while at the house throughout the night.) Kirkpatrick stated that then, a noticeably intoxicated Franklin yelled
back at him, “No, excuse you.” He claims to have done nothing else to have provoked Franklin. After this exchange,
Kirkpatrick claims shoving ensued as blows were thrown at him, ultimately resulting in a two-and-a-half-inch laceration on the back of
his head requiring a trip to the emergency room and four staples to close it.

Specifically, Kirkpatrick is able to name Sig Ep brothers junior L.P. Hill and sophomore Scott Lafranchi as two people who
definitely assaulted him. Regarding the damaging blow to the back of his head, Kirkpatrick claims, “I am 95 percent sure
it was L.P. Hill. I did not get to see who exactly hit me because of the angle of the
blow, but when I looked around, he was the only person in the best position to hit me so hard.”
A freshman witness on the scene also stated that someone hit Kirkpatrick on the back of the head, but he
was not able to see exactly who it was. Hill declined to comment for this article. However, Lafranchi stated that
“after such fundamentally fallacious reporting, The Davidsonian no longer deserves to print this story. If any member of the community
wishes to find out what happened, they can contact me.” Franklin’s sole comment was, “I did not assault anyone nor
did I provoke anyone else’s assault.”

Kirkpatrick claims to believe no bottle was involved during the assault. But, he said, “a hand could not have caused
a two-and-one-half laceration on my head. It must have been an object or someone’s ring.” The current Sig Ep President,
junior Jason McMullan, agreed to be interviewed for this article. He said, “There was definitely no bottle in the house.
We go through a thorough check to make sure there are no residual bottles, either. The Risk Manager and bartenders
did not see any bottles, also.” McMullan said that Kirkpatrick might be confused as to what occurred at the party.
While he did not see the whole event, McMullan did talk with every brother possibly involved in the altercation. “All
the blows thrown were frontal. (Brett) did not even know when his head was hit. It was nothing more than
a scuffle between individuals, and it was separated and over quickly,” he stated.

Regarding which brothers were involved in the fight and what their “in-house” punishment might have been, McMullan stated, “I have
no comment on the reprimand or the result of the fraternity investigation. The matter has been dealt with internally, though.
We do not want it to be made public, but we have a fraternity Code of Ethics that must be
enforced. Releasing the results would be like revealing our secret initiation rites. It’s no one else’s business.”

The police report and witness testimony does not reveal who or what might have committed the damaging hit to Kirkpatrick.
When pressed as to what might have caused Kirkpatrick’s laceration, McMullan responded, “It is entirely within the realm of possibility
that he walked into an open door edge or backed into a window or the wall — as some of
the EMTs speculated.” McMullan was very upset with Geiger’s reporting. “It should have been put into the op-ed section. He
did not even read the police report and is Brett's friend. He wrote the (slanted) article because he felt nothing
was happening,” he said. Geiger defended his actions by saying, “I should not have placed the report in the Police
Blotter. It should have been its own article. The police did not take statements that night. What Brett told me
was the same as what actually went into the police report.”

Kirkpatrick is angry that no one is being punished for his assault. “I wanted to retaliate and punch the guys,
but I did not, because I wanted the school to handle it. I thought the Code of Responsibility would handle
it. To say that I banged my head on the wall is ludicrous,” he stated. Specifically, Kirkpatrick wants someone to
pay his medical bills and said, “I do not understand why Sig Ep had its investigation and the Dean’s office
is having their own and no one is coming forward. I think it implies that a brother did do something.”
McMullan denied any knowledge of a coverup, though. “I talked with everyone who knew anything, and all the explanations were
the same,” he stated. Finally, McMullan said that the matter is by no means completed. “The fraternity punishment is by
no means the only one (that might occur). The Dean of Student's Office is also investigating.”is conducting their own investigation,
and it could still go before the Judicial Board.” Assistant Dean of Students Ernest Jeffries did say that the investigation
is ongoing and will be completed thoroughly.

My method was wrong; but facts are still true.

To the Davidson Community:

Last Tuesday, I received a phone call from the current president of Sigma Phi Epsilon. He informed me that my
account in The Davidsonian’s Police Blotter of the incident that occurred at the SPE house on the night of Friday,
Jan. 23, was not only inaccurate but also offensive. He requested that I retract the statements I had written; this
is not a retraction.

What I included in the Police Blotter of the Feb. 3, 1998 Davidsonian in connection with that incident is the
police report of the victim, Brett Kirkpatrick, taken by Officer Deborah L. Lower of the campus police on the following
day. In an error of discretion, I failed to report the statements given by the members of SPE because of
my firsthand experience of the situation. And that experience, the reason why I was at SPE that night, was because
of my connection with the victim.

Brett Kirkpatrick is one of the best friends I have made at this school, and on the night of Jan.
23, I returned from an off-campus party, and, before returning to my dorm, I and the two other guys I
was with went into SPE with the sole intention of finding Brett. When we did find him, he had endured
a fight and a wound to the back of the head. Blood was running down the back of his neck
and had already soaked into the collar of his shirt. He was enraged and threatening violence, but under the care
of the house’s EMTs. At that time, I witnessed the SPE — identified by Brett as the individual who struck
him from behind — attempt to flee the scene. Upon seeing this, Eric Knoche, my pledge brother and also a
close friend of Brett’s, chased after him and pulled him back to the scene. Following this, the SPE brothers who
talked to the police claimed they could not identify the individuals involved in the fight, and that no one witnessed
the fight or the blow that fell on the back of Brett’s head.

This experience led me to believe, and I still believe, that the SPEs on the scene covered for the brother
who attacked Brett from behind after the fight had been broken up. In the following 13 days, nothing was achieved
in the way of justice, and in my haste and passion, I tactlessly and without forethought included an event that
deserved an entire, unbiased article (which has now been written by Naresh Nagella), in the menial corner column of the
Police Blotter.

I understand my first mistake was attempting to write an objective article about a subject with which I was emotionally
involved. My next mistake was my failure to put aside my feelings and write the article that Naresh has now
written. And if I could not have brought myself to objectivity, I could have delayed my piece and written an
op-ed. Either way, I could have better served myself and Brett.

However, I say again that I retract nothing I’ve written; I only acknowledge that there was a better way to
report it. Furthermore, this statement was made on behalf of The Davidsonian without regard for myself — I apologize for
the situation I put them in.

Finally, I do believe that SPE will soon come under attack in the investigation by Dean Jeffries that is already
making headway, and that Kirkpatrick, I, and all of the others who stood by us will be vindicated by the
result of that investigation.

A clarification from the editors

In last week's Davidsonian Police Blotter, staff writer Scott Geiger wrote of an incident at Sigma Phi Epsilon that had
occurred on Jan. 23. We believe that, rather than reporting from the Campus Police reports available to him or writing
an op-ed, Scott wrote his article according to what he had heard from sources that were involved and his own
feelings. He then misrepresented this information to the editors and the campus as fact from the police reports by putting
it in the Police Blotter.

Based on these events, senior staff writer Naresh Nagella was assigned to conduct a more thorough investigation on behalf of
The Davidsonian in order to clarify the events that occurred; however, even through our work we cannot come up with
all the answers. Dean Jeffries is leading an investigation into this matter, but it should be stressed that the inquiry
is ongoing: official conclusions have yet to be drawn. We regret this mistake and to the best of our abilities,
we will ensure that this will not happen again during our administration of this paper.
