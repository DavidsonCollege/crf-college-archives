THE DAVIDSONIAN

The seven Wildcat backs poised to launch an air attack (upper left) are (left to right) Johnny Frederick, Tommy Peters,
Art Roach, Shep Booth, Buck Williams, Mac Bruce, and Ben Washburn. Bill Dunn (upper right) is a Davidson sophomore end.
Alf Taylor (above) is a member of the junior class who is serving his second year as a varsity first-string
guard.

Tackle George Floyd (center) is a member of the sophomore class but is about as big as any member of
the Wildcat squad, weighing 215 pounds. Coach Gene McEver and Ben Lacy, senior fullback (above), discuss the contest with the
U.N.C. eleven. The generalship on the field will be in the hands of Lacy, a 165-pound fullback from Richmond.
