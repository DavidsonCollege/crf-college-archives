Johnson, Wildcats come up short in upset bid

Davidson’s bid for its first NCAA tournament victory since 1969 came within a couple of missed three-pointers from fruition. The
70-62 loss was Davidson’s 11th on the season and ninth all-time in tournament history. Coming in as a 15 seed
left the Wildcats with one of the toughest matchups in tournament play: the Ohio State Buckeyes in Dayton, OH.

Davidson was able to silence the hostile crowd early in the game as Ian Johnson ’06 scored 12 of the
first 14 Wildcat points. Ohio State had seemed determined to shut down Davidson’s perimeter game and Johnson had several one-on-one
opportunities in the paint. His left-handed hook became a dangerous weapon against the Buckeyes. Ohio State seemed unable to find
any offensive rhythm, shooting just 29 percent in the first half, and Davidson was able to take a five-point lead
after a Kenny Grant ’06 three-pointer and a Brendan Winters ’06 backdoor cut.

“Our defensive gameplan was to double-team their ballscreen and double-team their catches in the post,” said Johnson who finished with
26 points and 10 rebounds. “It worked well in the first half, but they spaced better in the second half.”

In the first half, Davidson smothered the Buckeye’s star forward and Big Ten Player of the Year, Terence Dials. He
was held to just six points on 3-12 shooting. Although only leading by four points at the half, Davidson went
into the locker room with tons of momentum, having silenced the partisan crowd, successfully attacked the Buckeye frontcourt and scared
the Buckeyes into the realization that they could lose.

For only the second time all season, Davidson relinquished a half-time lead to lose the game. Trailing by three with
14 minutes remaining, Ohio State went on a 10-0 run that was sparked by the outside shooting of Ron Lewis.
Throughout this stretch, Davidson shooters could not find their range and the Buckeyes took advantage of mismatches inside, with Dials
dunking over several Wildcat defenders. Davidson never pulled closer than three points, as their three-pointers wouldn’t fall and their defense
was not able to collapse on the paint with the Ohio State shooters warming up from outside.

While it certainly did not help that the referees were letting Dials be physical, that open jumpers would not fall
and that the entire arena was against the Wildcats, Davidson seemed to give in at the end. Although they had
played on the big stages this season, the Wildcats' success always seemed to come in front of friendly crowds in
smaller atmospheres. They folded against North Carolina, Duke, and Syracuse, an attribute that all of the tourney analysts mentioned when
predicting this game.

“Our practice experience on Thursday was a brand new experience for us,” said Johnson. “All of the media and Ohio
State fans were there, and it felt like a game.”

For the Wildcats, however, Friday’s loss meant the end of an era of Davidson basketball. Winters and Johnson finished fourth
and 10th, respectively, on the career scorers list. Kenny Grant ’06 set the season record for assists, while Matt McKillop
’06 finished second all-time as the most prolific three-point shooter in Davidson history. The attitude in the locker room was
positive in that the players expected to win and were not satisfied with coming close. Davidson basketball has turned the
corner, and with a solid new freshman class, the Wildcats could be dancing again next year.

Two rainouts give baseball breather after losses

The Wildcats went 0-3 in a home stretch against the Yale Bulldogs this week, bringing their record to 10-10 on
the season. “We’re struggling,” said Rob Wilson ’06. “We started off the season pretty well, we were 9-3 at one
point.A lot of big contributors have been injured, which has hurt us. But we’re still 10-10, so by no means
is the season lost.”

Game one against the Bulldogs was a back and forth battle at first. Yale’s two-run homer in the top of
the second was countered by a two-run shot from Alden Crissey ’07 in the bottom of the inning. The ’Cats
gave up one run to an RBI single in the fourth, then another two on a double in the fifth.
Down 5-2, Davidson came back in the fifth with two runs; Blake Osborn ’07 scored on a bunt by Ronnie
Shore ’06, who reached third on the play due to a Bulldog error and subsequently scored off a Jay Heafner
’06 double to left. The 5-4 score after the fifth was as close as the Wildcats would come, however. Yale
tacked on three runs in the sixth inning with a triple driving in two and a single plating the other
one. The seventh inning buried the ’Cats, as Yale played small ball and batted in four runs against Davidson relief
pitching. The Wildcat offense had put one run on the board again in both the sixth and seventh innings, but
the 12-6 score after seven remained unchanged.

The St. Patrick’s Day game saw more theatrics and a closer score. Starter Wilson let in six earned runs and
another two crossed the plate before Michael Kaufman ’06 took over to throw two perfect innings. Against Wildcat relief in
the ninth, Yale tacked on another three runs to make the margin seven. Davidson scoring was initially slow. Alden Crissey
’07 drove in Gregory Zage ’08 in the second on a sacrifice fly, and Shore sent home Hugh Eden ’08
on a groundout in the third. In a savvy play in the fourth, Alex Entrekin ’07 reached base after striking
out on a wild pitch; Entrekin was then advanced by a Crissey groundout and scored on an Osborn single. Only
one seventh inning run came for the ’Cats, and so they went into the bottom of the ninth trailing 11-4.
In the ninth, however, the bats came alive. Led by their seniors, the Wildcats batted around the order to put
together five runs. The inning came all on small ball, with nobody hitting greater than a double. The Bulldog defense
finally managed to force a last out and keep Davidson from completing the comeback.

The third game against Yale was closer still. Starting pitcher Rob Shenk ’07 held the Bulldogs to two runs through
five innings while the Wildcat offense put up five to take their first lead of the series. In the sixth,
Yale touched Shenk for a homer and Kaufman stepped in to finish the inning without further damage. The bottom half
saw a Crissey double send home Brett Shore ’08 and Heafner for a 7-3 advantage. Yale poured it on in
the seventh, however, nailing Kaufman for five runs and the slim 8-7 lead. The lone run was enough, as the
Bulldogs held on to win and take the sweep.
