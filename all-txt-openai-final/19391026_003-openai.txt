Question of the Week

The custom of passing students down in chapel, started last year as an idle prank, is rapidly coming to the forefront as an issue of vital importance. This prank, by virtue of its repeated performance, is well on the way to becoming a Davidson tradition. Alarmed at this state of affairs, student leaders have urged student cooperation in putting a stop to the custom. Below are samples of student opinion.

The question: Are you in favor of putting a stop to the custom of passing students down in chapel?

Campbell Baird, Junior:
If pep meetings have been eliminated as contrary to the desirable spirit at chapel exercises, it seems to me that everything of that type should be stopped. When visitors come to Davidson, they judge the student body by the way it behaves in chapel. That's about the only time they have a chance to see all the students together. "Passing down" must look like prep school stuff to them. It lowers student morale and kills all respect for the exercises. It should be stopped before it becomes a tradition.

Dave Vosburg, Sophomore:
If a boy doesn't mind being passed down, I think it's a lot of fun and amuses the whole student body. However, it's a different thing if the boy doesn't want to be passed down. Many boys have good reasons for not wanting to be passed down. Also, it should not be done if the program is running late and passing down would cause chapel to end late.

Fulcher In Tour Group
Physics Instructor Among Notables On Railroad Examination Trip

Professor H. E. Fulcher and Dr. W. P. Jacobs, President of Pee College and a graduate of Davidson in the class of 1913, were among the newspapermen, railroad executives, and educators who went on the Piedmont and Northern and Durham and Southern Railroads inspection tour October 17-20.

The tour, which is an annual event, carried the group through the Carolinas and Georgia. Their party left Charlotte Tuesday morning, proceeding to Georgetown, where they inspected the Southern Kraft Paper Mill, the American Cyanamid Company, and other industries. The group of eighty men arrived in Charleston on the "Directors Special" Wednesday afternoon and continued their inspection of Paper and Sugar industries. In the late afternoon, they were the guests of General Summerall and inspected The Citadel.

In the evening, they were the guests of the Charleston Chamber of Commerce and the Industrial Bureaus at a banquet held in the Solas Hotel. Thursday, October 19, was used to inspect the Union Bag and Paper Company, the Dixie Asphalt Plant, the National Gypsum and Sugar Refining Company, all of Savannah. A two-hour boat trip on the Savannah River, making constant observation of the newly developed industries in that city, ended the inspection. The trip ended Friday morning when the "Directors Special" returned to Charlotte.

M. Jenkins. These officers were guests of Lieutenant Colonel Steel of the Military Science department and were honored at a special parade of the Davidson ROTC unit.
