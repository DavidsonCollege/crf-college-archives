Traveler

effortlessly as fast and high above as the maestro’s mouth sees fit. You’ll find yourself looking skyward during these sections.
Popper often seems to be dragging these guys (Sheehan and Hill) behind him and although they are never too far
behind they are always the first ones to cry uncle and bail out of a crescendo. Hill is not spectacular
but is as solid as a bloke can be. Sheehan’s bass style (as noted by Chip Petree) is very similar
to that of Muzz Skillings (Living Colour) and Popper’s vocals oftentimes sound like those of that band’s front man, Corey
Glover. (Listen to “Mulling It Over.”) But, as said, this band is not jazz, though jazzy, and is definitely not
hard rock like Living Colour. These influences are combined, with others, into a very unique blues/rock mesh that is very
attractive to the ear as well as the Allman Brothers, whom they opened for last summer. “But Anyway,” the album
opener and, in my opinion, the best track, is an introduction to and a demonstration of Popper’s harmonica heroics. It
is also a vocal and lyrical high point. “100 Years” is a slow one that, like side B’s “Alone,” shows
that the band’s technique is tight enough to stand up after scrutiny (a fact that I never really doubted) when
the tune is slow enough to allow it. There is a nice poke at conservative incrementalism in “Slow Change” but
other than that the Traveler plays apolitical blues (the meanest blues of them all).

Blues Traveler is a recording that is definitely worth owning and a band definitely worth following.
