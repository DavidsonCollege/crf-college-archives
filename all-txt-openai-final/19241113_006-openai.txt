Three Scoreless Ties in Football History of Two Schools—First Game at Davidson

Should Davidson win this afternoon’s game, the post-war record of the Wildcats and Tar Heels will stand tied, with each
club credited with three wins and the one famous scoreless tie of 1920. Dope fiends, however, have discovered that in
the nearly thirty years of football relations between the two schools, Carolina has walked off with 15 games while Davidson
has won only three. Three games have gone to scoreless ties.

The football relationship between the two institutions began in the fall of 1897 when the Tar Heels defeated Davidson in
Charlotte by a 10-0 score. In rapid succession, the Carolina squad piled up five straight wins until the first scoreless
tie of 1904. Not strange to say, it was in that year that the now famous Carolina coach represented the
Davidson team, playing a ripping game in the backfield. However, it was only until 1910 that the fighting Wildcats placed
the Red and Black banner above the Blue and White, when L. Richardson picked up a Tar Heel fumble and
raced 60 yards for not only the first victory of the Wildcats but the first touchdown ever scored by a
Davidson player on the Carolina team.

After several more defeats came the World War, when in 1917 the two teams did not meet. In 1918, with
only four lettermen back at Davidson, Coach Fetzer built up a team that was able to hold Carolina four times
within the one-foot line, winning 14-7 when Red Johnston raced 80 yards with a pass from the famous Spann at
quarter and later in the game scored on a sweeping end run.

The next year was the year of Runt Lowe’s greatest playing for the Tar Heels. His punting was one of
the wonders of the game, Carolina winning 10-0 when he drop-kicked for a field goal and Spaugh, another Winston-Salem boy,
scored a touchdown. Ferrington, still another Winston product, kicked the extra point.

In 1919 came Gig Shepherd to Davidson and in November he swept for 25 yards around Carolina’s end for the
only touchdown of the game, as Davidson won on Prince Albert Field, in Winston. Red Johnston, this year at Carolina,
and Spratt Moore, had a battle royal on the same field in 1920 when the two teams fought to the
third scoreless tie. That too was the last game to be played in the Twin-City.

The following year found the “wonder team” from the University beating the Wildcat eleven 29-6 in Charlotte, a pass, Hendrix
to Davis, both playing today, scoring the Davidson touchdown after a march up the field from the Wildcat 29-yard line.

Last year Coach Younger for the first time led the Wildcats against the Tar Heels and for the first time
the two teams played on the home ground of the University boys at Chapel Hill. Doped to lose by a
great score, the crippled Davidson machine turned loose a terrific attack that outgained the Tar Heels, but lost 14-3. Hunt,
on the Davidson team today, scored the field goal after a march down the field, in the first minutes of
play.

North Carolina Wildcat ‘Stirred Up Over Contest
Carolina Has Purchased Davidson Ram for Own Use—King of Golf Flock Held

Wherever one hears the name Davidson College in that place one hears of the “fighting Wildcats.” When they received that
cognomen one does not know but in the years and years that have elapsed all have agreed that it is
a fitting name. Last year through the courtesy of an alumnus the Davidson campus had as its guardian the first
live Wildcat. Imported from the Everglades of Florida it found the North Carolina climate too severe and during the summer
of 1924 passed into a better land. A few weeks ago another Wildcat, this time a real North Carolina feline,
captured near Fayetteville, was secured. With a ferocity far surpassing that of the southern kinsman and on a par with
that of its fellow-wildcats, it today paces its narrow cage with a stealthy step and a gnarling stare.

The pedigreed ram that the University of North Carolina has recently adopted comes from the native haunts of the real
Wildcats, having been purchased last week through Dr. Arbuckle of the Davidson faculty. Repeated efforts were made to secure the
king of the golf course flock, but all in vain. Why the Carolina boys have adopted a ram is not
known and whether they wish to be called “Rams” or “Rammers” is a question. But that in the wired cage
is a little fur-covered feline which would give its life blood for one moment's fight with Mr. Ram is beyond
question.
