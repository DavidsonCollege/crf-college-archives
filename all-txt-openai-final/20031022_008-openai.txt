**Staff Editorial**

In thumbing through our archives recently, we came across a column in the Opinion section of a Davidsonian printed almost
10 years ago to the day, on Nov. 1, 1993. Columnist Chris Frampton examines the effects of the College’s minority
recruitment efforts, raising questions that are remarkably timely even a decade later. We find it useful to re-print his column,
slightly edited for length, not because we agree with his points, but in hopes that it will illuminate how the
diversity debate has evolved since Frampton left Davidson:

**Diversity. What an issue.**

Time and time again members of academia have repeated this word, believing whole-heartedly that if they said it enough, colleges
would suddenly begin to look like a gigantic fingerpainting of races. The idea has been forced into the role of
the most important item on the agenda for today’s college campuses. Even conservative Davidson has fallen in behind the diversity
banner, bringing to its campus a speaker so upset with the English language that she replaced the word heroine with
the word shero.

And diversity is a fine idea. Certainly, as Johnetta Cole indicated in her address, colleges and the world can “draw
on the talents, sensitivities, and the plain old smarts of all our people.” But why now? Is this the battle
that remains to be fought in terms of equal rights for all members of American society? Possibly. But are there
positive results to the active minority recruitment that has become so popular? Maybe not.

Certainly people deserving of an education but restricted financially have been given an opportunity they might never have had as
a result of this trend. But, obviously, not all minorities are poor, so why would they want to come to
Davidson? It is a question that is on the minds of many college administrators. The answer seems to be along
these lines: “Because we have a black student center, because we give a large number of minority scholarships, because we
will cater to your needs.” But the result of such a response may well be dangerous.

Last year, a black student responded to the question of why he was a member of a committee by saying,
“Because I am black.” The look that followed seemed to say, “What are you, an idiot?” Last week, Travis and
Rafael wrote that most white students do not talk to them unless they were drunk. They claimed that teachers ignore
them in class. Almost every black student on campus is a member of the BSC and those that are not
often appear to be pressured into joining. This doesn’t appear to be diversity. It seems that blacks have begun to
officially segregate themselves. Why? Possibly they feel that they are integrated in appearances only. Possibly.

Not even one percent of Davidson’s fraternity members are black. So are appearances correct? One question seems to stand out:
is the Admissions Office’s policy of minority recruitment beneficial to the College at the expense of those it claims to
help? Hopefully not. Hopefully the answer will become an unwavering no.

**Dialogue needed to challenge prejudices**

A few weeks ago, we were confronted with the prejudices that exist in our midst in a way that made
us all take note. The KKK is a racist, misogynistic, homophobic organization that boasts a host of prejudices along religious
lines as well. Perhaps just because it is an organization that is prejudiced against so many of us, we can
use this incident to ensure that, in opposition to the writer’s intent, respect for the differences among us increases. We
shouldn’t need to be black to be angered by racism or to be Jewish to be angered by anti-Semitism. The
reality, unfortunately, is that when you’re part of a largely homogenous community, these prejudices tend to become invisible to those
in the majority. Our choice to allow racism, sexism, homophobia, and anti-Semitism to be invisible, however, is a choice that
emboldens the racist, the sexist, the homophobe, and the anti-Semite. The response from so many student organizations has been encouraging.
Still, there are too many among us who don’t understand what this act symbolizes. WeI would ask each of you
to seek out your invisible biases, to challenge yourself and those around you to understand a different perspective. Talk about
this incident, yes - but more importantly, talk about it with someone who isn’t like you. Don’t waive off a
homophobic or racist statement or ‘joke’ as being harmless; it isn’t. Use your patience, your intellect, and your humanity to
understand why one of us may believe that prejudice isn’t an issue on this campus and why another may feel
confronted by intolerance regularly.

As members of the Committee on Ethnic Diversity, we are charged with increasing the ethnic diversity on this campus. We
are committed to the belief that Davidson College’s mission, “to liberate the minds of young men and women,” goes unfulfilled
if we are allowed any unchallenged prejudices. We invite you all to participate in the campus-wide dialogue on diversity that
we will be initiating this year.

Members, Committee on Ethnic Diversity:
Ruth Ault, Kelly Chaston, Scott Applegate, Nancy Fairley, Burkhard Henke, Ken Menkhaus, Shelley Rigger, Carlos Rivera, Fred Smith, Brenda Tapia,

Football program united against racism

On behalf of the entire Davidson College football program, student-athletes, and staff, we would like to express our utmost regret
and indignation concerning the recent appalling acts of vandalism. We feel that the spray-painted letters “KKK” call forth racism in
all its ignorance and cowardice. The vandals attempted to mar not only the physical structures but Davidson College in its
less tangible, and most valuable form: the community.

As a group of students who are fortunate enough to represent Davidson College beyond the classroom and beyond our campus,
we must make this statement as a team, unanimously denouncing the hateful acts and those who committed them. We applaud
the measures already taken by students and members of the faculty and staff in response to the senseless and repugnant
act, and we pledge our support, as always, to respectful fellowship.

Some answers about Kappa Sig status

As the Patterson Court Advisor, I have been asked numerous questions regarding the status of Kappa Sigma Fraternity on the
Davidson campus. I would like to take this opportunity to address some of those questions and concerns.

During the spring of 2003, Kappa Sigma members were involved in a hazing incident that led to the suspension of
their chapter from the Davidson campus. Furthermore, as a result of this incident, Kappa Sigma’s national office suspended the charter
of the Davidson College chapter, several members who were involved in the incident were removed from the national roll of
the fraternity, and the new members of the spring 2003 pledge class were not initiated into the organization.

Unfortunately, the negative actions of a few members had a tremendous effect on an organization that had existed proudly on
the Davidson campus for many years. While several members of this organization are still students at Davidson and remain close
friends, they are no longer a recognized organization of the college and were instructed by their national office to cease
all activity in the name of Kappa Sigma Fraternity.

The college and the Supreme Executive Committee of the National Fraternity will review the status of the Davidson College chapter
in the fall of 2004. However, any violations of the terms of the suspension before the fall of 2004 could
result in the chapter failing to regain recognition.

I realize that this situation and the current status of Kappa Sigma may be confusing to many students, especially first-year
men who will soon be receiving bids from fraternities, so I felt it important to address the concerns that have
been brought to my attention. I would encourage anyone with questions or concerns regarding Kappa Sigma or fraternity membership to
contact a member of the Patterson Court Council executive committee or myself.
