#### MATH & A FRESHMAN'S LAMENT
Dear Mr. Editor:

Around three months ago I, like many of the class of '59, received a notice from Mr. Hengeveld advising me to take a refresher course in Math. I wrote several of my friends already on campus (I later learned it is a campi), and told them my plans. From then on I was doomed.

Instead of the review course in Math, these friends decided that I should take the whole year's work and be done with it. It was a nice summer, ‘tis a shame I didn't get to find out how nice.

Although sometimes I wish I was back home or on the beach or just away from here, the majority of the time I am content with the wonderful college whose motto was translated to me by a considerate upperclassman Latin scholar as "We hate snakes more than anybody."

I won't say it was a mistake coming this summer. In fact, I feel it gives me somewhat an advantage over the freshmen entering next fall. For one thing, I have gotten to walk on the grass to my heart's content; and with a little encouragement from the Greyhound strike, I have learned how to get back to God's land, that is Lumberton, without paying.

Although my feelings about Davidson's summer range from the greatest to the lowest depending mostly on whether we are starting a week or looking forward to a weekend, you can be sure that come next fall I shall be glad I was here—at least I'll tell all the green freshmen that.

Ne Ultra and all that,

Buie Seawell '59

#### WEDNESDAY & WEEKEND

"Tonight at 8:30"

For all Davidson bridge experts and for those who are not experts, there will be a bridge tournament held during the Break tonight. The playing is scheduled to start at 8:30 p.m. in the Ballroom. Even though you have not signed up to play, it won't be too late to enter until the hands are dealt.

Of course, the hands will be pre-dealt. In charge of the tournament are John Dykers and Rufus Cromartie.

Although the tournament is for bridge players, all are reminded that this is the regular Wednesday night Break. Cokes will be served. It is hoped that there will be a large attendance, for this is the last Break.

Alan Ladd and Arlene Dahl (she's the doll who stays thin by sipping Pepsi-Colas) are technicolored in DESERT LEGION, to be shown gratis on Friday and Saturday at 9:00 p.m. in the Union Ballroom.

#### VESPER SERVICE
