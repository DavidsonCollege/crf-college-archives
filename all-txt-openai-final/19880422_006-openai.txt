My name is Fish  
I talk real fast  
I run real fast  
My name is Fish  

My name is Fish  
I need some cash  
It goes real fast  

Help me get cash  

My name is Fish  
I sleep all day  

I work all night  
The papers rush  

My name is Fish  

I drive real fast  

If a dog is  
in the car be-ware.

Ode to Chocolate  

Oh, my beloved, tempt me no more;  
I have not the strength to resist your allure.  

Enticed from attempts at my waistline's reduction  
I succumb to delights of your sensual seduction.  
Varieties surround me; the selection is vast  
And each one inveigles me more than the last:  
Curvy smooth frosting, the waves of thick goo;  
Provocative warmth of a dripping fondue.  
Steaming hot cocoa with whipped cream on top  
Comforting tenderness fills every drop.  

Hot fudge, you’re my weakness, and I must confess,  
Like ice cream I'll melt from your gentle caress.  
Boxed candy delights epicurean tastes  
Each morsel enveloped by chocolate embrace.  

A mouthful of ice cream’s a sapor to savor,  
A delectable delight in my favorite flavor.  

For my lips' enjoyment there’s no sweeter bliss  
Than the moment when Hershey will give me a kiss.  
Oh, glorious chocolate, voluptuous confection  
Forever you'll have my impassioned affection.

The Bodhi Desk  

There I was,  
Sitting in a tree  
that was my desk,  
contemplating Buddha  

in a pile of shit.  

I saw myself  
a fly, a thousand lenses,  
seeing nothing,  
buzzing on in search  
of Buddha, truth,  
and shit.  

From stagnant, stinking stupor,

The Denial  

The knobby contorted grasping claw  
Reaches out from beneath the thick dense mass  
Of a formidable vast oceanic realm.  

With the turbid, oozing, rich liquid streaming down  
The monstrous, bulging arm of its controller,  
The beast strives to grasp the areas beyond its reach.  

Nothing to grip, nothing to sustain, nothing, nothing,  

The creeping salty concoction swarms up the  
Limb's fleshy length, vessels bulging and screaming;  
And the disturbed network of waves folds back in place,  
Allowing the gates below to open, their hinges moaning,  
Their rocky monuments vibrating in disturbance,  
Their stronghold awaiting the last of the hurled ones.  

Wake to the Age of the Twelve await as the mawing womb  
Engulfs the pitiful beast into its black and jagged portal.  
The entrance shuts tight, and the brows of the Great One raise  
In affirmation and delight, shaking existence.  
He whirls his grayish head, gripping the annihilating javelin with authority,  
And looks down upon the world in silence.
