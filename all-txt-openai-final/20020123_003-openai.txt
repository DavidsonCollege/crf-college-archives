**Distinguished visiting professors bring unique gifts to campus for spring semester 2002**

**COLLEGE COMMUNICATIONS Press Release**

Many Davidson students this spring semester have the opportunity to take classes from three distinguished visiting professors at the college. Novelist Josephine Humphreys, philosopher David Armstrong, and diplomat Anne de Lattre are in residence at Davidson this spring to provide a perspective on the world that is not regularly available. Each professor will also make a public presentation at some point during the semester. Here’s an introduction to these special guests:

**David M. Armstrong**

David M. Armstrong, an Australian philosopher who has been deeply influential in metaphysics, epistemology, and the philosophy of mind, serves as the Kemp Distinguished Visiting Professor at Davidson this semester. Armstrong is teaching a seminar on “The Mind-Body Problem,” a subject that has occupied his thoughts and scholarly attention throughout his life. Armstrong believes that the mind is a physical bodily function, rather than existing as a separate entity that others describe as the human soul.

Armstrong’s book *Mind-Body Problem: An Opinionated Introduction* (1999: Westview Press), serves as the textbook for his seminar. The book reviews the history of the great philosophical debate on the subject, beginning with the thoughts of Descartes and moving through thinkers like Hume and Huxley. Several other prominent philosophers will visit Davidson to give guest lectures to the group during the course, and that prospect delights Armstrong. He said, “Heil and the other guests don’t agree with me on a lot of things, and will have a go at me during the course. That, along with the opinions of the students, should make for quite a lively and exciting semester!”

Armstrong will pursue several other projects during his time at Davidson. He is currently writing a book about truth, and will deliver a college-wide lecture entitled “The Scope and Limits of Human Knowledge,” which echoes the title of Bertrand Russell’s book *Human Knowledge: Its Scope and Limits*. Armstrong, whose wife, Jenny, has accompanied him to Davidson, received his Ph.D. from the University of Melbourne and was Challis Professor of Philosophy at the University of Sydney from 1964-1991; he is now an Emeritus Professor of Philosophy there. He was named an Officer of the Order of Australia in 1993 for services to philosophy.

**Anne de Lattre**

Anne de Lattre, a specialist in European and African affairs, returns to familiar surroundings to serve as James K. Batten Professor of Public Policy this semester. A French citizen, she taught at Davidson in both 1986...and 1988. She will teach courses this semester in “European Integration” and “France and the United States.” A native of Paris who did graduate studies in international relations at Johns Hopkins University, de Lattre has worked on African aid and development issues for almost 40 years. In 1962 she began her career as an economist with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Her investigation of economic development programs with that agency led to the formation of a cooperative venture between nine sub-Saharan countries called Club du Sahel. From 1976-1988 de Lattre served as its director, helping donors guide aid funds to the Sahel countries and strengthening food security programs. During the past ten years she has served as vice president of a U.N. conference on worldwide desertification, and chair of a French national committee charged with helping reform research performed for the benefit of developing countries. 

De Lattre, who has written numerous articles and papers on African development in journals and magazines, concedes to many economic and political problems in Africa, but anticipates a better future for the continent. She said, “The modernization of Africa will take a long time, but I’ve seen big changes in my work there. When countries have been able to avoid war, they’ve made progress.”

Josephine Humphreys

South Carolina novelist Josephine Humphreys is at Davidson this spring as the McGee Professor of Writing. This is her first-ever semester-long collegiate teaching assignment, though she has conducted numerous short residencies and writer’s workshops. “That’s actually why I accepted the appointment,” noted this author of four books: Dreams of Sleep (1984), Rich in Love (1987), The Fireman’s Fair (1992), and Nowhere Else on Earth (2000). “It’s good for a writer to get out of the comfort zone and change the trappings of everyday life.” Her familiarity with Davidson also made the appointment attractive. Humphreys has been on campus twice before to give readings. In connection with a 1989 visit here, she also served as judge for the Vereen Bell student writing award. The student she selected as winner that year is her now-famous fellow novelist Sheri Reynolds! “I’ve always enjoyed being in the presence of young people,” Humphreys said. “I’m very much looking forward to my classroom time with Davidson students.” 

In addition to teaching, Humphreys said she and her husband, Tom Hutcheson, are looking forward to having time throughout the semester for reading, attending cultural events, and strolling through the campus and town. She can also probably be frequently found in Little Library. Her first novel, Dreams of Sleep, was the winner of the 1985 Ernest Hemingway Award for a writer’s first novel. In 1992, Rich in Love was made into a motion picture starring Albert Finney and Jill Clayburgh. Her latest novel, Nowhere Else on Earth, concerns a swamp-bound settlement of Lumbee Indians who face aggression and enslavement from a Confederate “Home Guard” during the Civil War. Humphreys is a graduate of Duke University, and earned her master’s degree from Yale University. She has received a Guggenheim Fellowship, the Lyndhurst Prize, and an Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Nowhere Else on Earth was the fiction winner of the Southern Book Award last year. Humphreys will give a reading from her novels on Thursday evening, January 31, at 7:30 p.m. in the Smith 900 Room.
