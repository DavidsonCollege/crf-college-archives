**The Gods Must Be Crazy entertains, delights**

By JENNY LIVINGSTON

“The Gods Must Be Crazy” could never have been produced here in America. We have become so jaded in our outlook and sophisticated in our film-making technology that a film of such innocence and originality can no longer be created in the States. Our entertainment industry has grown up and lost its childhood forever. Thank God for imports — we can’t make these movies, but hopefully we can appreciate them.

It takes a slight effort at the beginning. Having become so accustomed to the technical displays we call movies in this country, we find it hard to get used to a film in which the only special effect is an elementary fast-action technique, to a film in which people get shot and don’t blow into pieces before our eyes, to a film which is edited poorly and dubbed sloppily. It is no technical marvel. Most of the actors aren't even actors; they're just people.

The movie opens, in fact, with shots of a clan of Kalahari bushmen, yes, bushmen, not actors made up to look like bushmen, but the real thing. They are shown carrying on their utopian existence until one day a pilot drops a Coke bottle out of his plane and into the lives of the bushmen. They find hundreds of uses for this fantastic “gift from the gods.” But soon they find themselves dependent on it and begin to fight over it. The head of the clan decides that it is an evil thing and decides to drop it off the edge of the world where it can do no more harm. The symbolism here is pretty obvious. This is not a film of sophisticated metaphors.

From there, the scene changes abruptly to a city in the south, “the civilized world.” Again, it’s an obvious juxtaposition for an obvious effect. The technique is completely guileless, but no less valid. In fact, after having been jerked around by so many more subtle movies, I really appreciated the honesty of this film.

The acting, too, is extraordinarily honest. The main character, the bushman N!xau, is completely untrained as an actor. His emotions are pure and unfettered by method. The director is to be commended for his minimal interference with N!xau’s natural talent. The other major actors are perhaps more experienced, but they are just as open and honest. They do not impose themselves on their characters; they embrace them.

The acting is not limited to people. Excellent performances are turned in by the animals of the Kalahari, one baboon in particular. But the best performer in a non-human role is “the Antichrist,” a land rover with a mind and personality of its own. Probably the funniest scene in the movie involves the car in an all-out battle with its driver, Dr. Steyn. The humor is very physical, even slapstick. It harks back to the days of Laurel and Hardy and the Keystone Cops. It was funny then, and it still works. The oldest bits are invested with new life. From the pratfalls to the car chases “The Gods Must Be Crazy” is...

**Indigo Girls thrive on unique style**

Editor's note: This article by Gerry Yandel appeared in the Feb. 8, 1986 issue of the Atlanta Journal/Constitution and is used with permission. Indigo Girls will perform two shows in the 900 Room Saturday night at 10 and 11:30.

“I don't want to wait for heaven
I can find what I need right here on Earth this time.
Too many people want to wait for heaven
But if you can't feel it here you won't feel it there anyway.”
— From “Holy City” by Indigo Girls

For the record, it’s Indigo Girls, not the Indigo Girls, and they’re finding what they want in Atlanta — a faithful, if small, following. Also for the record, which doesn’t have a title yet, all of the songs on it will be their own, and it should be released during the summer.

Both Indigo Girls, Emily Saliers and Amy Ray, are getting sick of the blues symbolism attached to the name. “I just thought it was catchy,” said the 21-year-old Ray. “It's blue and it’s deep,” said 22-year-old Saliers, laughing. “I think it has a ring to it.”

They’ve known each other since sixth grade at Laurel Ridge Elementary School in Decatur, Georgia, and they used to hate each other. “I was jealous of Emily because she was already writing songs and playing guitar. I wasn't writing anything, I was practicing three chords,” Ray said. “Yeah, I was writing songs about the sky and the clouds,” Saliers joked.

After getting over their aversion to each other, they got together in 11th grade at Shamrock High School. Their first gig was a PTA meeting. After playing “open mike” nights at Good Ol’ Days in...Buckhead and Sandy Springs as the B-Band (“It stood for a bad word, but that was a bad image,” Saliers said.) and Saliers and Ray, they went on to bigger things such as playing on Bourbon Street sidewalks and the late Professor Longhair’s Tipitina’s in New Orleans. “We made enough to take the trolley home and get some dinner. We thought we were great. We were really bad,” Saliers said in retrospect.

They returned to Atlanta and Emory University in 1983, where Saliers graduated with a bachelor’s degree in English and Ray is pursuing her bachelor’s degree in religion and English. And they've become accomplished enough as musicians and songwriters to have a cadre of fans following them from club to club in the Virginia-Highland, Emory, and Inman Park areas. They call themselves “the cheapest band in Atlanta,” and Cathy Bufford, manager and booking agent for the Moonshadow Saloon, said she loves working with them. “We've used them a lot, they’re reasonable, very flexible, enthusiastic, and a lot of fun.” They've been the opening act at the Moonshadow for such notable performers as Loudon Wainwright III, Dave Mason, John Sebastian, and Donovan. They've done the background music for the Theater Emory production of Sam Shepard’s “Curse of the Starving Class” and shared the bill with “Shepard Shorts” during Theatre Emory’s Rush Hour and Late Night Theatre.

The music Saliers writes is a cross between mellow rock and jazz, Ray calls her music “intense and driving” and a few of her songs are heavy on religious imagery. But the real treat is their voices, which are best illustrated by their live a cappella version of Paul Simon's “American Dream.” They have a self-produced single out now — with Saliers’ “Crazy Game,” a bluesy jazz song about love and insecurity, and “Someone to Come Home,” Ray's soft rock song about breaking away from motherly ties (with a vague reference to the second coming of Jesus) — which received airplay on WRAS, WRFG, and WREK radio stations in Atlanta.

Buoyed by their single's and live shows’ successes, they decided to work toward a themed album that will feature only original material and highlight their harmony. “The album is going to focus on the harmony because that’s really our forte,” Saliers said. “It gives us the chance to intertwine our different styles. We have more room to do a lot of different songs,” Ray added.

The Indigos are working with producer Frank French (a member of Atlanta band Drivin’ and Cryin’), who recently came out with an album of instrumental music called The New World, which he produced in his own studio. They've been playing around with the title “Blue Food” but, Saliers said, “We've pounded the blue imagery enough. My dad said we should call it ‘Scratch Tracks.’”

“We want it to be sort of a concept album. I feel it will hang together a lot more,” Ray said. “It will be the Indigo Girls’ sound, something recognized and unique.” “I think there is something about us that’s unique, I don't know what it is, but why do people come out to hear two guitars and two voices?” Saliers asked.

Whatever the answer, they don't want to change their formula for success. “We don't want to make any compromises for commercial music. We just want to do what we do. No Madonna,” Saliers said. “And no Lionel Richie hook lines,” Ray added. They'd rather try to keep their personal touch they said they have with their audience. Their shows are characterized by frequent interaction with the audience, having a good time on stage, and walking around during their breaks to meet new people in the audience. “It works to our benefit, it's easier and easier to get jobs. It's gotten to the point where people call us and tell us about new places opening up,” Ray said.

They book their own dates in town because they don’t want to sign up with a talent agent. “That just wouldn't work,” Ray said. “We want to do it on our own and do it now,” Saliers added. “We don't want to wait five years for a Warner Bros contract.”
