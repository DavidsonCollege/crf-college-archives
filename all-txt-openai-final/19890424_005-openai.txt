**Eating out on the Court: how your house rates**

By ANJALI SHARMA and VASHIST WORAH

Do you have a weight problem? Let Patterson Court take care of that! If you want to lose weight, join
a women's eating house. If you want to gain weight, join a fraternity. Although the surroundings and the utensils are
much the same, each house on the Court has its own distinct personality and flavor, as well as its specialties.

For salads, we recommend Rusk. Don’t let the large number of girls intimidate you. They are quite nice, and they
talk of all the normal things that collegiates do: dates, parties, and classes. You won’t go hungry around Rusk: there’s
always plenty to go around. The day we dined here, a menu of hot dogs, salad, and boiled potatoes was
served for lunch.

Phi Delt offers you a peek into their kitchen when you go to collect your food. It’s “Cordon Bleu” today:
kind of like dumplings with lots of grease in it. This entree is accompanied by salad and bread. The topic
of conversation was, inevitably, sports and the role of Phi Delt.

If you’re a diet-conscious grease-avoider, try Spencer. Sausages, eggs, applesauce, and bread highlighted the meal we ate. Conversation gushes forth
as members apologize: “There are normally more people here... the food’s usually better.” We agreed that the food was good
(try the sausages). Listen carefully and you will learn that boys and parties, papers and professors are also a topic
of conversation here.

Kappa Sig is your best bet for music. A pledge strumming the guitar and another singing entertained us. (Don’t be
embarrassed Jamie!) Please do NOT try the baked potatoes unless you like them.

SPE had vegetables and poultry in a white sauce (add some cheese and you would have Phi Delt’s “Cordon Bleu”).
Plenty of salad, onion rings, bread, and last night’s brownies. Here you can get the latest details on last week’s
date and the new girlfriend. When the food is served here, it is pounced upon without having to listen to
prayers or announcements. Topics of conversation include volleyball, scholarships, room situations, and hall counselors.

We unfortunately picked the wrong day to visit Warner Hall. The menu consisted of stew and rice. Frighteningly huge cauldrons
were on the buffet table. Conversation soon stilled, as members learned that the house was under review. However, if you
need someone to talk to, the Davidson pre-meds are “not just a bunch of science geeks who want six-figure salaries.”

**Not just a bunch of science geeks who want six-figure salaries**

By TRENT STEVENS

It is not a surprise that one out of every five Davidson students follows a premedical curriculum for undergraduate study.
The popular major includes those planning to attend medical school, dental school, and veterinary school. Approximately 95 percent of premedical
students graduate from Davidson with acceptances to post-graduate schools.

Davidson premeds are not just a bunch of science geeks who want six-figure salaries. In fact, they are far from
the truth. Junior Boyd Gillespie is one student who challenges the myth. A classical humanities major, he said that “seeing
the triumph of the human spirit when someone overcomes a deadly disease” would be one of the greatest rewards in
his chosen profession. “My dad’s a doctor,” he adds, “I’ve never thought of being anything else.”

His roommate, Will Warlick, is another who refutes stereotypes. “The greatest reward [of being a doctor] will be my ability
to help others and improve their quality of life,” he said. He cited “helping others” and his academic leanings.toward science
as being the main reasons for his career direction. Despite those academic leanings, other ones have led him to major
in history. Arjun Srinivasan may be a freshman, but he has already decided that he wants to go to medical
school. “I’ve always been interested in science,” he said. He plans to major in biology and is currently considering clinical
research as his specialty.

“Both my parents are doctors,” said Lee Nagendren, a senior music major. She plans to become one herself. John Cock,
Calvin Martin, and Willis Parting rated high for atmosphere and music. “It’s very nice to have another totally different field
of study that I can turn to when the other is driving me up the wall,” she said. She will
attend the University of Alabama School of Medicine in the fall, where she may specialize in pathology. One subspecialty which
interests her is performance medicine—the afflictions of musicians.

Professor John Williamson, chairman of the committee, said that standard medical school study involves “hitting the books” for the first
two years, then “hitting the wards” for the additional two. A 3.3 GPA and a score of between 50 and
55 on the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT) are the minimum credentials for a Davidson student to be accepted at
most medical schools. He added that “under- predictors” of medical school success and that “below a 3.0 is essentially a
cutoff” for medical school admissions. “We advise students of the realistic probabilities of getting into med school and we advise
them on what they need to do to increase the probability that they will get in,” he stated.

Warner Hall girls were quite willing to listen. KA's definitely make the prettiest girls! The pledges had a fashion show,
and the “Fiji Man” won! Chicken, beans, and salad were served today. This was the only fraternity where we found
fresh fruit. KA’s brownies are highly recommended. SAE’s atmosphere was definitely loud. Whoever threw records and saucers the furthest was
rewarded with cheers. Lasagna with (hardened) cheese was served. However, it was accompanied by wonderful bread and ice cream. Some
interesting people eat down there and none seemed to conform to the SAE stereotype.

We highly recommend Pika to all you women. Red threadbare carpet and mismatched furniture are soon forgotten around these guys.
Three rounds of applause and multitudes of expletives started off our eating experience. A good meal was served: salad, bread,
BBQ chicken, and apple pie! Classical music was played as the brothers waltzed down the aisles. Sam, the former president,
Benjy, Allan, Eric, and John were all great fun to talk to.

And then there was PAX. Believe us, this is no place for meek-hearted frat brothers! Those paper-ball fights can really
get out of hand, and the risk for serious injury cannot be ruled out. If a rowdy, uncontrolled atmosphere is
what you’re looking for, this is the place to go. It’s a little boring sometimes, though, as there are no
pledges to haze, no beer all over the floor, and no music blaring at 110 decibels. The place really smells
clean! There are people here who really stop and talk. An actual intelligent conversation over dinner? They’ve got it here.
They’ve even got a groovy salad bar and real food. For dinner, we had salads, homemade brownies, scrambled eggs, and
rice. It’s been a long two weeks (that’s the time it took us to visit every Court house). We’re hungry
now, so off to the Commons!
