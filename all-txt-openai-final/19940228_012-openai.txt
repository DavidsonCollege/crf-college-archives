## REALITY BITES
### It's a movie about, for, and in spite of us.
By Robert Ramsay

Some of the most powerful and affecting films are remarkably unrealistic. This is why I find it so refreshing to
watch powerful and affecting films that are, of all things, like a home movie in their realism. Steven Bochco recently
pulled it off on television with his controversial NYPD Blue, and Ben Stiller, from the almost unwatched series The Ben
Stiller Show, has done it even better with Reality Bites (Universal, PG-13).

The film concerns a group of college graduates struggling to find something to do with their educations. At the forefront
is Lelaina (Winona Ryder), an aspiring documentarian who videotapes her friends in an effort to show their struggle to find
their future and themselves. Her emotions are caught between her best friend Troy (Ethan Hawke) and an executive from In
Your Face TV named Michael (Ben Stiller).

This is not, though, a love story in the classic sense. It is, in fact, less about love than it
is about reality, and the struggle to live within it. The characters, having just stepped into the “real world,” try
to give up the run-home instinct and develop an ability to say “I am an adult and can handle this.”

Written by 24-year-old screenwriter Helen Childress, the film is so appropriate for the college generation—those of us who will soon
be entering the world of dead-end jobs and closed doors. But Reality Bites is suitable for our age group not
only when it concerns the job market, but also when it addresses relationships, sex, managing money, and being resourceful.

In one of the most touching and amusing scenes of the film, Lelaina and her friend Vickie (Janeane Garofalo) are
in a cafe, and Vickie is pondering her life as she waits for the results of an HIV test. She
explains that she feels like a new character on Melrose Place, an analogy that reflects the cohesion of reality and
visual media in our culture—a fact also represented by interspersed clips from Lelaina’s documentary.

Stiller and Childress include even more elements from today’s pop culture. Vickie works as a salesperson at The Gap and,
after finding out she has been promoted to manager, says, with fear in her face, “I’m in charge of all
those t-shirts. Crew neck, v-neck, ribbed, what have you.” She expresses in that one line the anxiety that responsibility causes
these people to feel.

Lines in the film range from the extremely witty (see above) to the marginally sappy, such as Troy’s exclamation to
Lelaina: “The only thing you have to be at 23 is yourself.” But the performances are so strong that the
film never falters.

Ryder has not been this good since Heathers—she is, in fact,
