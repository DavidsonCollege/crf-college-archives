#### Caviar, Chandeliers, And Couch

An old friendship brought Davidson College trainer Tom Couch an unforgettable tour of Europe. Couch’s former football coach at Western Carolina, Jim Gudger, was selected to coach the U.S. Olympic basketball training squad on the three-week tour. Couch was asked to serve as the team’s trainer.

Couch thought his most serious injury would be a broken neck by Gudger, “He put Lefty Driesell to shame screaming and hollering. I asked if Lefty had ever worked for him.”

The twelve-man squad took five days at Colorado Springs to learn the offenses and then departed for their first game at Turku, Finland. Included on the squad was Dennis Wuycik of North Carolina and the heralded Maryland recruit Tom McMillen. Most of Couch’s unusual experience occurred while there.

“A lot of tourists told us that in Moscow the rooms were bugged and our luggage. They would go through it.”

When he got there, his roommate had lost his briefcase. “We figured that if our room was bugged, the microphone would be in the chandelier, so every time he walked by the chandelier he’d say, ‘Bring my briefcase back.’ Sure enough, three days later they brought it back.”

Couch said he found the caviar good. “And every time you had to drink vodka straight. They were offended if you didn’t. I didn’t know how long I would hold out. It’s like eating hot peppers. Then I learned I could pour it in my water glass and get away with it.”

The food and drink soon got to the Davidson trainer. The water in Russia wasn’t fit to drink. “I was probably the sickest one in Moscow. I’d gone so far without a drink of water I said I was going to drink some water if it killed me—and it almost did. I had the European trots for four days.”

This wasn’t Couch’s only discomfort. “One of our Bible professors was over in Europe last year and he told me to take all summer clothes. It was 42 in Moscow.”

Couch said that it seemed the entire population of Moscow (six million) was on the streets at the same time. He believed the further he went away from Moscow, the people became friendlier and more progressive. He also mentioned that the Russian basketball team was paid well, making 240 rubles per month, when the average salary is 120 rubles.

“I think the Russians did do an excellent job. They had read the Sports Illustrated article about the track team and I think that is one reason they went all out for us.”

Tom McMillen caught a lot of Couch’s attention as well. “McMillen was probably the one who talked to the interpreters the most. He’s a brilliant young man. I expected the worst from him, but I probably got to know him better than anyone else. He’s quite a young man—I wish we could have got him at Davidson.”

“McMillen tried to convert one of the Moscow railroad conductors into a capitalist. The guy was a devout atheist and said he believed in nature first and Lenin second.”

In London, he said McMillen sort of served as a tour guide to the rest of the group. The squad finished the tour with a 10-3 mark and were only soundly beaten by the Russian nationals. The team started strong by winning its first seven games. It was a young U.S. group, too—the oldest player was 22.

Couch felt that the tour made him appreciate the U.S. even more. “Our protesters ought to put themselves over there. I don’t think they’d ever protest again. I may get mad the next time I see a protest. They never bothered me before.”

Despite the loss of several key team members since the completion of spring practice, Davidson football coach Dave Fagg is optimistic in his outlook for the coming season. Fagg indicated that several players who were counted on as starters on this fall's team will not see action. Ricky Snipes, defensive end, hurt his knee in spring practice and is not expected to play at all this fall. Bill Reeves, who also manned a defensive end position, dropped out of school in the spring. Offensive tackle Steve Baldwin has elected not to play this season and Gary Cornette has transferred.

Spring practice also cost the Wildcats the services of Billy Colvin, who reinjured his back. Fagg said, “Colvin had a very good spring practice and we really thought he would help us this fall.”

Monday’s scrimmage with Catawba also cost the Wildcats starting middle linebacker Woody Montgomery. Montgomery suffered a broken arm. Fagg said of the losses, “When you lose the caliber of seniors that we did through graduation and then so many men of this quality, it makes it much tougher. Since quite a few of them are interior linemen, that makes us thin in the trenches and means that several boys have to learn two positions in order to give us depth.”

Junior Joe Poteat is expected to replace Montgomery at middle linebacker with sophomore Jimmy Hardison also expected to see action at the position. Despite the rash of missing people, Fagg sees a lot to be optimistic about as the Wildcats head into the final weeks before the season opener with Richmond.

“I think we have the opportunity to have an excellent season. Mike Mikolayunas has done a great job for us. It looks like the Mark Thompson to Mikolayunas and Rick Lyon combination will be a good one for us.”

Fagg indicated that in Monday's scrimmage the Wildcats had trouble on pass protection for Thompson but that “we've got it straightened out in practice this week.”

Fagg is counting on Mikolayunas, John Ribet, Dave Mockbee, and Bill Bracken to supply the running game to complement Thompson's passing. Fagg and his assistant believe that the new “wishbone” offense will be ready for the Richmond opener. “The players have done a real nice job of picking it up,” said Fagg. “It should prove to be a really interesting attack to watch.”

“We have some inexperienced players in the lineup like Thompson and Mockbee, who has switched from defense to offense, but there are older players. We are confident that Thompson can be a very fine quarterback.”

Despite the loss of Ed Terry, who set several Davidson kicking records in his three varsity seasons, Fagg looks for the Wildcats to have a strong kicking game again this year. “We have to get down the timing on our kicking game, but Harold Wilkerson looks like he’s going to be an outstanding replacement for Terry. In the Catawba scrimmage, he kicked a 41-yard field goal.”

Richmond's win over N.C. State last week firmed Fagg’s opinion of Richmond's football squad. “It's a tremendous football team. It's not the most comfortable feeling to open against one of the conference's strongest teams but we will be ready.”

Thompson awaits action in scrimmage.

#### Richards Makes Spiders Favorite

People around Richmond aren't paying any attention to talk about Archie Manning, Rex Kern, or Jim Plunkett when it comes to naming this year’s leading quarterback. They believe they have one of the finest in the nation in Charlie Richards.

#### Promising Wildkittens Brighten Grid Prospects

If last year's freshman football team—with only three scholarships invested in it—was one of the finest in Davidson history, the 1970 Wildkittens could go into the books as the best ever. Head Coach Dave Fagg has brought in more than 40 players this year. On several occasions, he has called the 1970 freshmen “the finest group of recruits since I have been associated with Davidson.”

#### Crawford Lost To Brevard; Attempt For McMillen Fails

By CHARLIE TERRELL, Sports Writer

No, this isn’t a fish story, but one of the prize catches of last year’s...Basketball recruiting efforts have slipped away while another highly-touted prospect never swallowed the bait. Dave Crawford, the 6-10 bulwark from South Hill, Virginia, who was counted on to provide strength at the pivot position for the freshman team, will not be attending Davidson this year. A conversation with Wildcat basketball Coach Terry Holland revealed that Crawford, who had high college board scores, was accepted at Davidson with the condition that his high school grades would improve during his final semester. According to Holland, Crawford “was requested to take a course in summer school here and make a C on it.” After Crawford received a D in the course, the admissions committee said he could not attend Davidson. When asked about Crawford’s future plans, Holland said that Dave is presently attending Brevard Junior College and he expressed hope that Dave could come to Davidson in one or two years. Noting that the situation was “cut and dried,” Holland commented that Crawford was a young man with great ability who “needs to find himself as a student.”

Another more publicized situation has involved the indecisiveness of Tom McMillen from Mansfield, Pa., who was lured to the Carolina Tar Heels by Coach Dean Smith but who recently switched and enrolled at the University of Maryland, much to the delight of former Davidson mentor “Lefty” Driesell. Coach Holland remarked that he was “happy for Coach Driesell,” and expressed regret at the failure of his staff’s efforts to land McMillen. “Tom never visited the campus, and we were unable to talk with him at his home,” said Holland. He added that Davidson’s efforts were hindered by the lack of someone to operate on the inside of the McMillen family struggle. Davidson trainer Tom Couch traveled with Tom McMillen in Russia this summer with an Olympic preparatory team and according to Holland they became good friends. However, Holland lamented the inability to establish earlier communication with McMillen as a reason for his apparent lack of interest in Davidson. It can also be surmised that parental pressure may have caused McMillen to turn a deaf ear to Coach Holland’s offerings.

TRYOUTS FOR THE ALCHEMIST - (MAJOR FALL DRAMA PRODUCTION) MONDAY, Sept. 21 - TUESDAY, Sept. 22 IN THE FINE ARTS BLDG.

We welcome the student body back to town, especially the Freshman Class.

However, freshman coach Gene McEver is quick to note that it will be hard to better last year’s 4-1 record. Perhaps the best of the freshman crop is Eddie Petitt, a 6-4, 220-pounder from Keyser, West Virginia. He played quarterback for Keyser High School and could play the same position for the Wildcats in the future. However, he could wind up at defensive end or linebacker. “Wherever he plays he will be a good football player for us,” said assistant coach Evans Brown. The coaches are also high on another quarterback, Steve Keller, a 6-0, 185-pounder from Columbus, Ohio, where he was honorable mention all-conference. Two running backs—John Webel of Mansfield, Ohio, and Mike Harding of Stem, N.C.—are also considered future varsity standouts. Harding, a 6-3, 194-pounder, is one of several Blacks who will be on the freshman team this fall. Offensive line coach Turnley Todd says that Steve Shankweiler, a 6-3, 222-pound tackle from Atlanta, and Tom Jones, a 6-3, 210-pound offensive tackle from Hinckley, Ohio, are two of the best prospects he has seen at Davidson. Frank Olejack, Jerry Mauro, and Jerry Haynes are expected to join Richards in the backfield. Richmond established themselves as the class of the conference Saturday by whipping North Carolina State, 21-6. Two other contenders weren’t as lucky. Clemson downed The Citadel, 24-0, and Toledo crushed East Carolina, 35-2.

The Citadel will display to the league a devastating running game. Tailback Bob Duncan is regarded as one of the best in the South. Billy Watson has been elected to operate the “Citadel Veer” offense. He surpasses last year’s quarterback Tony Passander as a runner but his passing ability is dubious. Defensively, The Citadel is weaker than the 1969 edition. All-American John Small has joined the Atlanta Falcons. The line and linebacking corps are inexperienced. The secondary should be as good or better than the past. East Carolina has abandoned the single wing and now runs with a Proset T. The offense isn’t the only new thing as Mike McGee is the new coach. With McGee come six junior college stars. One of these, John Gassazza, will start at quarterback. ECU is also blessed with a standout fullback, Billy Wallace. There is depth at the receiver positions, the only place there is any depth on the entire squad.

It’s anybody’s guess how the rest of the league will finish. William and Mary finished with a 3-7 slate last year while Furman and VMI together only won one game. VMI did gain their first win in two years Saturday by dropping Furman, 13-0. The Keydets have more experience this year and have some added speed in the backfield. Veterans returned to all positions except the defensive backfield. Again Furman allowed many basketball-like scores (losing 77-14 to Davidson) last year and the defense doesn’t appear to have improved greatly.
