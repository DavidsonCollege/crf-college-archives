### Straycats Top UNC-CH in Club Football

by Joe Ford ’82

There was a time when Davidson Club Footballers would say, “If we only had a true quarterback.” The team has
found one, and he’s a winner. Chip Fishback, a sophomore, led the Straycats to a 33–8 romp over the Tarheels
of UNC-Chapel Hill.

Fishback used the sure-handed receiving of Carl Rist and a controlled yet explosive backfield of Allen Griffin and Mark Adams
to tear up the Tarheel defense.

Though the Cats controlled the first half both offensively and defensively, they couldn’t find many plays that would end up
in the endzone. It was a Fishback pass to Rist for the first of his two touchdowns that put the
Cats up 8–0. The Tarheels came back and tied the game on a fluke reception by a surprised Tarheel after
the ball was deflected by senior captain Alec Driskill. The half ended at 8–8 and the Cats knew it was
time to regroup and find the magic to put points on the board.

The Cats came out in the second half revived and rested. It was the men in the trenches who proved
to be the focal point. On the offensive side, the linemen fired off on the snap quickly which opened up
holes for the halfbacks to scoot and scamper for two touchdowns and more yardage than normally seen in a club
football game. The line is made up of Eric Crum, Doug Wiley, Ian McClean, and Bud Aiken. The Straycat defense,
led by senior captains Steve Shelby and Alec Driskill, forced two interceptions, two fumbles, and a safety. The defensive backfield
and line units complemented each other well as the two interceptions were due to devastating pass rushes which sacked the
quarterback five times, and fumble recoveries due to the strong hits by the defensive secondary. The defensive line was made
up of Jim Crowe, Eric Crum, Cyler Caulton, Rob Farley, and Terry Kurtts. The linebackers are Steve Shelby and John
McColl, and the secondary is made up of Alec Driskill, David Proffit, Keith Evans, Bobby Barnes, and Chris Norwood. Driskill
and Barnes each had an interception.

The game ended with Davidson scoring more single-game points than it has in the last two years. After the game,
Alec Driskill, the coordinator for the Club Football team, said, “We played a good game. We made some mistakes, but
it was the best game we've played in four years. Everyone was fired up, and we realized our potential when
we saw the points on the board.”

### IMAC with the Doughboys and the Slimshafts

#### Hotspots for Homecoming

Last month we were commissioned by Head Grounds Mistress Grover Meetze to compile a listing of places of interest in
the Davidson area. Henceforth arose the Doughboys and Slimshafts Guide to Wildcat Hotspots.

- **Anchor Tavern**: Located just outside town limits, this favorite drinking spot of certain English and German professors is really
hot. Be sure and say hi to Leo when you drop in to buy a T-shirt but don’t go after
sunset because that’s when it closes down. KA’s never go there.
- **Buttery and Beanery**: One of the favorite Sunday KA hangouts (the other is church), B&B is undergoing rapid expansion.
The newest addition to the staff is Should-be-Miss-America Angie Horne.
- **Cashion’s Bank and Trust**: And you thought it was a grocery store. Actually, it’s a front for a county-wide
belly dancing ring of gorgeous high school girls. By the way, possum fritters are on sale this week.
- **Davidson College**: Not very important. Located across the street from the post office.
- **Exxon**: Popular hangout for former basketball coaches. Has more soft drink machines than South of the Border.
- **Fiji House**: This renovated Pizza Hut with purple doors has more drug dealers than Bogotá.
- **Howard’s Grocery**: The owner of this place is so poor that the only time he has tinsel on his
Christmas tree is when he sneezes on it.
- **Irwin Dorm**: Due to the bovinous coeds that inhabit this dorm, its bathtubs have stretch marks.
- **Julie Vanderpool’s House**: Speaks for itself. This beautiful house recently transferred from Georgia.
- **K and K**: Great place for freshman hall misers. Take plenty of penicillin.
- **Little Dorm**: Davidson’s version of the United Nations. That hula hoop girl probably lives there as well as John
“doormat” Shaw.
- **M and M**: Houses more strains of botulism than a medical school laboratory. Great place for KA chapter meetings
on Saturday morning.
- **Nature’s Way Organic Food Store**: Supplier of alfalfa sprouts for Rusk’s salads.
- **Park’s Rexall**: Oldest cashier since Methuselah. Geach moonlights as a delivery boy.
- **Quincy’s**: Future employer for all Davidson football greats.
- **Rusk**: Davidson’s version of a rodeo when the ice cream tubs come out on Sunday.
- **Spencer’s Car in His Backyard**: Eternal resting place for fossilized bud feces.
- **T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**: Nothing; only Bob Ruth could come up with stories for these letters.

Next week the Doughboys and Slimshafts will give explicit accounts of their Homecoming dates. In case that isn’t boring enough,
the SPE’s will have another band party. And if you're still not asleep, you can always read the rest of
the paper but be sure you check off each article after you read it.
