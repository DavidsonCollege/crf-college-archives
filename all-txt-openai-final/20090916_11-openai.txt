the 'Cats dropped all three decisions.

Davidson opened their home season Friday night with a game against the UNC-W Seahawks, losing 3-0 (25-21, 25-17, 25-19). Sarabeth
Peele ’11 was a strong striking force for the Wildcats with 10 individual kills. Her classmate, Hayley Lawson ’11 was
also a strong offensive asset with 26 assists.

Jorden Benedict ’11 and Christine Perzinski ’12 also snagged multiple kills for the 'Cats. For the Davidson defense, Peele picked
up nine digs for the 'Cats.

Davidson started their second day of tournament play with a morning decision against Radford University. The game was taken by
the Highlanders 3-2 (22-25, 22-25, 25-17, 29-27, 15-13).

The 'Cats led the match at first 2-0 but fell short in the end. Peele once again was a leading
force for the 'Cats with 27 kills. Jorden Benedict was also a leader for the Davidson offense with 13 kills.
Team setters, Anna Bradbury ’11 and Lawson had 24 and 23 assists respectively.

Davidson closed out their tournament in the weekend’s final game with a match against the Canisius Golden Griffins. Lawson boasted
a weekend high 37 assists while Molly Crenshaw ’13 picked up 11 digs for the Davidson defense. Davidson’s endeavors did
not prove enough as the Golden Griffins took home the win, 3-2 (25-15, 25-11, 20-25, 24-26).

The 'Cats will make their final tournament appearance of the season as they travel to Winthrop this weekend to take
on James Madison, Gardner-Webb and the Winthrop Eagles.
