HELL GROENING

OUR RELATIONSHIP IS GOING NOWHERE.
WE'VE GOT TO TALK.

TO NEVER SPEAK TO YOU AGAIN.

CAN YOU POSSIBLY BE SERIOUS FOR JUST ONE SECOND?

HOT PANTS? STUDY DRIPPING? THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD?

THAT'S IT. WE'RE THROUGH. YOU HAD ONE MORE CHANCE.

DAMN YOU AND YOUR IRRESISTIBLE EROTIC WILES.

LIFE IN HELL BY GROENING

LET YOUR FINGERS DO THE WALKING.

IT'LL READ AWHILE.

KEEP YOUR ICY FEET AWAY FROM ME, MR. FREEZEY.

THE WAY YOU DROOL IN YOUR SLEEP IS BEYOND REVOLTING.

HEY PAL. I COULD WAIT TILL YOU FALL ASLEEP THEN MURDER YOU. EVER CONSIDER THAT LITTLE POSSIBILITY?
