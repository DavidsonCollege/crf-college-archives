BY ODI CASALI

Davidson’s track teams showed up well last Saturday when they turned in their first victories of the season. The varsity
especially performed nobly in doubling the score on V. P. I.’s Gobblers. Prior to the meet Saturday, the Wildcats had
not tasted of victory in two attempts, and likewise (or vice versa) the Gobblers had not tasted of defeat in
the same number of attempts. But Saturday the worm turned and Davidson emerged victorious over a hitherto unbeaten team.

Captain “Soup” Brannon seems to be in a class all of his own. Since coming to Davidson, “Soup” has set
new records in both the mile and two-mile runs. He has broken his old record in the two-mile on several
occasions, and seems to set a new one each time only to break it himself. Saturday he lowered his two-mile
mark to ten minutes, two and five-tenths seconds, clipping no less than five full seconds off his old mark. It
wouldn’t surprise us in the least to see “Soup” bring the mark below ten minutes the next time he runs
the event. If Brannon keeps up his good work he ought to have things pretty much his own way in
the State Meet in Greensboro this year.

“Big Jim” Swart, V. P. I’s threat in the weight events, failed to live up to expectations in the meet.
He put the shot over 47 and a half feet to win first in the event, but could do no
better than 124 feet, 2 inches in the discus throw and consequently lost out to Pete Knox, who threw it
a foot farther. Rhinehardt, of the visitors, furnished the thrills of the meet. He pushed Fleagle in both the 100
and 220-yard dashes, and then in the 880-yard, after trailing the first lap, he exerted himself to reach the tape
ahead of Gwynn.

Davidson’s golf team will have four of its busiest days of the season beginning today. Foursomes will be played with
Carolina, Duke, and N. C. State on successive days, and Saturday the team will enter the State Meet, which is
to be held in Greensboro. Last year the Davidson golf team won the state championship and has a good chance
of repeating this year.

The Davidson track team meets another Virginia foe this week-end at Lexington, Va. V. M. I. will be encountered in
what should prove to be one of the Wildcats’ hardest meets.

Wildkittens Defeat Hickory High School

Monday, April 18, the Davidson Wildkittens met and defeated Hickory high school at Hickory by a 6-5 score. Ashton pitched
very well for the ’Kittens, opposing Abernathey and Bivens of Hickory. K. D. Weeks led the hitting for the Davidson
team, getting two hits out of four times at bat, while Burns and Payne tied for honors for Hickory. The
game was very close throughout.

DAVIDSON TRACKMEN DOWN V. P. I

Davidson Nine Trounced By Elon Christians, 7-4

The Elon Christians took an early lead over the Davidson nine here last Thursday to finally defeat them 7 to
4. The Christians totalled twelve hits which netted them victory. Most of the batters for the visitors followed up Reiber
who led the hitting with a triple, double and single in four trips. They were pounding the pill hard, for
eleven putouts were accredited to the Davidson outfielders. The Wildcats played a tight game, but luck seemed to hold victory
beyond their grasp. They hit Mann, Elon twirler, for nine bingles which profited them only three runs, though they bounced
three of their hits in the third inning, four in the fifth, and two in the last frame. Davidson was
able to get only one hit in the ninth. Bradsher led the Davidson hitters with a double and two singles
in five trips to the plate.

’Cat Tennis Team Is Victor Over Furman

Winning but one out of three matches on their southern tour, the Davidson tennis team returned last Thursday. Emory and
South Carolina both routed the Wildcats, but the locals defeated Furman, 9-0. The Emory team defeated Davidson in Atlanta Monday
afternoon, six matches to three. Jimmie Halverstadt, Number 1 for Davidson, featured the afternoon's play by defeating Boykin of Emory,
6-1, 8-6. In the match with Furman the ’Cats defeated the Purple Hurricane 9-0. Furman won but two sets out
of the entire meet. On the following day Davidson met defeat at the hands of the University of South Carolina
netters, 5-4. Earlier in the season the Cats beat South Carolina, 5-4. During the entire set-to the Gamecocks waged an
uphill battle, but finally emerged victorious at 5 to 4.

Earl Bradsher Leads in Team Batting Averages

By getting four safe hits in seven times at bat in the two games during the last week, Earl Bradsher,
centerfielder, was able to take sole possession of first place among the Wildcat regulars in batting averages. Bradsher, who wasIn
a tie with Bruce Peabody, first baseman, for the lead last week, “Doc” Mathis, outfielder, connected safely in six tries
and lost 56 points by an 8-0 score. Big ito slip into fourth place. Buck Mills moved into the afternoon,
(eight times 300 class by getting four singles in at bat during the week. Croker, with a near-perfect defense supporting
him, with an average of .333, and Smyre with .300. McKeithan limited Davidson to three hits and at no time
was he in danger. The contest was beautiful to see. Pearce, on the mound for Wildcats, was performing nicely and
the test was anything but “all Duke.” In this canto, however, the slugging aces of the Blue Devils gave vent
to their pent-up wrath and lashed at the offerings of Pearce with all fury. After the debris had been cleared
away, the scorekeeper’s pad showed a sum of six hits and five tallies for the visitors. From thence onward was
a period of uninteresting baseball which prolonged the advent of the end of a game which was conceded to Duke.
The inability to hit was the glaring weakness of the Wildcats. Pearce hurled nice ball for seven innings, but when
the eighth rolled around he weakened sufficiently for the opposing batsmen to run rampant.

This contest marked Duke's entrance into Big Five baseball circles, and, needless to say, she made a very auspicious entrance.
Last year the Blue Devils copped the Big Five championship. Should they continue the excellent work shown in this game,
they have a fine chance of retaining the championship. Only two extra-base hits were made during the fracas. One was
a double by Mathis of the ‘Cats, and the other a terrific home wallop by McKeithan. McKeithan’s circuit blow occurred
in the second inning and brought Pechan, who was on first, in before him.

’Cat Net Team Beats Richmond University
The Wildcat net team of Davidson College administered a sound defeat to the University of Richmond netters on the local
courts last Saturday afternoon by a count of eight matches to one. The only match won by the Virginians was
Cohen's victory over Charlie Harrison at Number 6 by the scores of 6-3, 9-7. No match went for more than
two sets. The Davidson team was handicapped by the absence of Myers and Roddey, regulars at Numbers 3 and 6
respectively, who were still suffering from injuries sustained in an accident on the return from the southern trip of the
team. However, McClean and Harrison gave a good account of themselves, the former winning over Rudlin, 6-1, 6-4, and then
teaming with Harrison to take their doubles’ match, 6-2, 6-1.

Summary:
Singles—Halverstadt (D) defeated Captain Kelly (R), 6-0, 6-0; Lafferty (D) defeated Earp (R), 6-2, 6-0; Enloe (D) defeated Harless (R),
6-3, 6-2; McLean (D) defeated Rudlin (R), 6-1, 6-4; Captain Calder (D) defeated Hecker (R), 6-1, 6-0; Cohen (R) defeated
Harrison (D), 6-3, 9-7.
Doubles—Halverstadt and Lafferty (Davidson) defeated Kelly and Harless (Richmond), 6-1, 6-1; Enloe and Calder (Davidson) defeated Hecker and Earp (Richmond),
6-2, 6-2; McLean and Harrison (Davidson) defeated Cohen and Rudlin (Richmond), 6-2, 6-1.

BRANNON SETS RECORD
Davidson Captain Breaks Old Record in Two-Mile Run

Both the varsity and freshman track teams won their first victory of the season when two V. P. I. teams
were defeated at Richardson Field Saturday. The Wildcats decisively whipped the V. P. I. Gobblers by an 84½ to 41½
score, while the Wildkittens eked a 61-56 victory over the visiting freshmen. In the varsity meet, Davidson took ten firsts
and tied for first in another event, to pile up its large score. One event, the broad jump, was swept
by the Wildcats, the visitors failing to place a man. The surprise of the afternoon came when Knox, of Davidson,
hurled the discus 125 feet 2 inches to rob Big Jim Swart, V. P. I.'s star weight man, of first
place in the event. Swart was true to form in the shot put and copped that event with a distance
of 47 feet 6½ inches. Rhinehardt, of the visitors, led the individual scoring by taking first in the 880-yard run
and seconds in the 100 and 220-yard dashes for a total of eleven points. Fleagle, Davidson's dash star, was second
with ten points gathered by taking firsts in the 100 and 220-yard dashes. Captain Brannon, of the Wildcats, set a
new Davidson record for the two-mile run when he ran the event in 10 minutes 2.5 seconds. Henry Rhyne, after
high jumping 5 feet 11 inches, attempted a new record in that event but failed to clear the bar in
three tries. V. P. I.'s yearling team went into an early lead. (Continued on page 5)
