### FOR A BETTER DAVIDSON

Vol. XIV DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N. C. NOVEMBER 4, 1926 No. 8

#### COLLEGE JOURNALISTS GUESTS OF SALEM AT SEMI-ANNUAL MEETING

Byron Hayworth, Editor of The Guilfordian, Sounds Keynote of Convention in Opening Address — Other Editors Speak

Declaring that the college press stands in danger of exercising “too much freedom,” Byron Hayworth, editor of the Guilfordian, and president of the North Carolina Collegiate Press Association, urged a reactionary move against excessive liberty, in his address before the twelfth semi-annual convention of North Carolina college editors, at Salem College, last week. Mr. Hayworth’s address was a highlight on the calendar of the greatest collegiate press convention ever held in North Carolina.

“We have been asking for more freedom,” he said, “when in reality we have too much freedom already! We are even now in danger of losing the very valuable and necessary assistance and supervision of our faculty members.”

Following this declaration against the freedom of the college press, Mr. Hayworth explained to his listeners the peculiar responsibility of the college editors. He urged the cooperation of the convention delegates in establishing greater prestige and recognition for American colleges and college students, pointing out that much of the criticism of our colleges and universities is due to the improper exploitation of campus college newspapers. His address was heard by more than 50 delegates, representing the leading college publications of the state. For the first time in the history of the association, representatives of all the college newspapers, magazines, and annuals in the state were present.

The convention opened last Thursday with a get-together meeting in the campus reception room at Salem College, at which time (Continued on page 6)

#### Exterior of Stadium to be Finished This Week

Dedication to be Special Feature of Home-Coming Day — Donors to Be Here

A novel attraction has been added to the festivities of Home-coming this year. The dedication of the new Richardson Stadium will add a new feature and much interest in the exercises of the day. The stadium is now nearing completion and will be ready for its dedication by the 13th of November. All the concrete has been poured, but it has to settle several weeks before it can be used. The exterior has been completed with the exception of a few finishing touches. The plumbing fixtures have been installed in the new dressing rooms under the stadium, and work is well underway to have this interior work completed as soon as possible.

The R. O. T. C. Battalion and Band have been working to make their part in the exercises of the day a success. In the morning the R. O. T. C. unit will assemble on the athletic field for a demonstration of calisthenics exercises and after this parade. The public exercises at the new stadium will begin at 11:45. All visitors will be seated on the southern end of the stadium, the northern end being reserved for the battalion for the remainder of the exercises after the parade. At this time, with President Martin presiding, the exercises of the formal presentation and reception of the field and stadium will be held.

The formal presentation will be made by Mr. J. Max Hendrix, '14, of Greensboro, representing Messrs. H. S. and L. Richardson, donors of the field and stadium. Though (Continued on page 2)

#### The Davidsonian to Reward Reporters

With the hope of stimulating interest in journalism on the local campus, the management of The Davidsonian has announced that a formal contest is to be instituted among its reporters and departmental heads, which is to culminate in the choice of the most valuable worker at the end of the present school year. An appropriate award, to go to the worker whose efforts constitute the most meritorious service of the year, will be a special feature of the contest.

Rules governing the contest and the award are to be formally conveyed to the staff workers of the publication as soon as they can be approved by an executive committee. A group of judges, to be chosen from the ranks of prominent journalists, will determine the winner of the award, the selection to be based solely on service rendered during the present school year. Advance information indicates that the award will consist of a certificate and gold medallion, bearing an inscription indicative of the conditions under which it is won. A special committee chosen from members of the local faculty will render the first decision on the award, the winner to be chosen from the four men of their choice by the final board of judges.

A continuous contest, in which the best-prepared article of each week is to be chosen by a member of the Department of English, will be an important factor in determining the qualifications of the different reporters. (Continued on page 5)

#### Tigers and Wildcats to Clash for Second Time at Charlotte Saturday

Game Ended in 6-6 Tie Last Season

INTEREST HIGH

Adkins Holds Leading Offensive Power of Visitors — Wildcats Out to Win

When the Hampden-Sidney Tigers meet the Davidson Wildcats in Charlotte next Saturday, a very scrappy game is expected. The Tigers are in top shape with a very successful record so far, and are in hopes of subduing the Wildcats. As Davidson has one of the strongest teams in the state this year, the game promises to be a very close and hard-fought contest.

The Tigers have a creditable record this year. They held the strong University of Virginia team to a 0-0 tie. As Virginia beat V. M. I., the fight shown by the Tigers deserves especial praise. Hampden-Sidney dealt Elon a crushing blow last Saturday, with the big end of a 44-0 score. The Wildcats beat Elon 26-0, which shows that the Tigers and Wildcats are well matched. Last year the Hampden-Sidney-Davidson game ended in a 6-6 tie, and this year’s game promises to be equally close.

In the Tiger line-up are several men deserving special mention. Atkins, who always plays a creditable game, will be on hand to receive passes. Dudley, captain last year, playing center, and Mills, strong tackle, will be important factors in the defense. Richardson and Worden, who have been out of the game for two weeks due to injuries, will be back in the game Saturday. Their return will greatly strengthen the Hampden-Sidney offensive.

The Wildcat line-up will probably be the same as (Continued on page 7)

#### 1927 Norris Trophy is on Display Here

The Norris Trophy will again be presented this year to the Davidson athlete who shows himself to be most proficient in the different branches of sport carried on here. The cup has been placed on display in the window of the White Drug Company. Shortly before the close of college, a vote of the entire student body will determine the winner of the trophy for 1926-1927. The man decided upon will be presented with thedealt taking cup at commencement. The honor went to Harry Vanee last year. Vanee had distinguished himself as a player of note both on the gridiron and diamond, and was also a member of the wrestling team. A previous award was to G. F. Laird. By a ruling passed last year, a man winning the cup once is thereby made ineligible from further competition.

The Trophy, a large silver loving cup, was presented by the Norris Candy Company of Atlanta, Ga. It becomes the permanent possession of the one fortunate enough to win it. Rules governing the award are as follows: the director of athletics, the faculty athletic committee, the graduate manager of athletics, the president of the student body, and the alumni secretary, with Mr. Frank E. Lowenstein of Atlanta, Ga. as ex-officio chairman, shall have charge of the details of awarding the (Continued on page 6).

Doctor Ben Lacy of Union Seminary to Open Annual Life Work Meetings Sunday Night

JACK RUFFNER

One of Hampden-Sidney’s most powerful gridiron stars. He will come to Charlotte Saturday to participate in the annual Wildcat-Tiger fracas. Reports from the Old Dominion State, where the Hampden-Sidney machine has been making a fine stand, indicate that Ruffner is a player of superb qualities —Charlotte Observer photo.

The Y. M. C. A., in conducting its evangelistic services, has been unusually fortunate in securing for a leader Dr. Ben Lacy, president of Union Theological Seminary. Dr. Lacy will be assisted in this work by the Glee Club quartet and possibly some other song leader. Dr. Lacy will preach at church Sunday morning and at the Y. M. C. A. vesper service at 6:15 in the evening. On Monday, the chapel hour will be set aside for his use so that all Davidson men will have an opportunity to hear him. He will speak in the evenings of these days at 7:15. The meetings will not last longer than one hour, a length of time that anyone may well spare to hear one of Dr. Lacy’s powerful discourses. Because of his war record, he will address the R. O. T. C. unit and will review the battalion. Dr. Lacy’s ability as a preacher is surpassed only by his magnetic personality. He keeps in close touch with men and is here to help Davidson students to fight out their problems. Bill Covington is in charge of interviews, and all interested will please see him in regard to the time of these appointments. All interviews will be held in the “Y” recreational center—the room on the left.

Dr. Lacy is pleasantly remembered as the preacher of the first sermon of the present college session. The response to this service was marked, many students being impressed by his inspiring and earnest address. Dr. Lacy, a former Davidson student, was a Rhodes scholar at Oxford for three years. On returning to this country, he served as a home mission worker under Dr. White in Wake County. At the outbreak of the war, he enlisted with the Thirtieth Division as chaplain, where he saw much active service. After the war, he was called to the pastorate (Continued on page 5).

TIGER TERROR

Here he is, fellows, that ripping, raring, tearing Sprinter Adkins, whose work in the Davidson-Hampden-Sidney game last year was one of the prettiest gridiron exhibitions ever witnessed in these parts. He is still the same old Adkins, but the Wildcats are hoping to tame him down some next Saturday afternoon—Charlotte Observer photo.

The Norris Athletic Trophy committee, the Charlotte, Davidson Eleven Scores First. But Cadets Come Back Strong During Second Period to Push Over Two Counters

Although outweighed 25 pounds per man, the Davidson Wildcats played a football game Saturday against the Virginia Military Institute Cadets that will long be remembered as one of the most colorful gridiron classics ever played by these teams. V. M. I. weight won, 12 to 7, using her tremendous advantage in the second period to score two touchdowns and win the game. First downs were evenly divided, each team making an even dozen, with one of the Wildcats’ on a penalty. It was the first defeat of this season administered to the Wildcats, and approximately 6,000 people saw the Davidson team grimly fight and saw them defeated only after a sensational struggle.

The Wildcats were the first to score. Early in the first quarter, the ball was on V. M. I.'s 41-yard line, and Dick Grey hurled a pass to Wells for 20 yards, and followed with another to Lincoln for 20, which placed the ball on the one-yard line, where Leggette bucked it over. Leggette featured in the drive to the 41-yard line, carrying the ball on all but three plays. V. M. I. began a drive in the second period, assisted by a pass for 14 yards and a five-yard penalty for offsides on the Wildcats, when the cadets were within the sacred zone of the Davidson team, Barnes taking the ball over for V. M. I.’s first score. The second six-pointer was also made by Barnes in the same period after a 46-yard drive. A pass, Barnes to Nabors, netted 25 yards, a second one followed for a 15-yard gain and line smashes made the rest. (Continued on page 5).

Queens Glee Club Will Sing Here November 23

Diversified Performance to be Presented by Girls From Neighboring Institution

Announcement has been made by J. S. McRae, president of the Davidson Glee Club, that the glee club of Queens College will be presented in their annual concert here on the night of November 23rd. The performance by the Queens girls is a yearly affair and consists of well-trained choruses, musical skits, and individual members which delight a Davidson audience. Not only will the program consist of musical numbers, but also there will be several readings and selections of a similar nature. A number of voices have been added to the club and together with the old members, form a well-balanced organization. Miss Mae Joiner, president of the Queens Glee Club, states that a program will be presented this year that is up to their usual standard.

Arrangements are being made by the Davidson Glee Club for its annual tour, according to Caldwell Withers, advance manager. The schedule, as yet, is in a tentative form and exact arrangements have not been made, but most of the performances will be presented in the Old Dominion. Several attractive offers for one-night engagements have been received from various parts of the state, and some of them will probably be accepted. The glee club is going through lengthy practices in preparation for the approaching season and will make its initial appearance on the night of Homecoming Day, November 13th. The Symphony Orchestra, as well as the Jazz Orchestra, is rounding into shape (Continued on page 6).
