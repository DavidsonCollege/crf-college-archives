WHAT'S WHAT

AMONG AMERICAN COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES

By REES JENKINS

When this comes off the press, the campus will be flooded with visitors from other campuses, particularly from women's colleges;
so, what I have will probably be comparatively stale. Here goes—despite the odds.

Your reporter has been faithfully studying the column writing techniques of Walter Winchell and “Gopher” Mann, in order to give
you, my fans, a more interesting column. However, in view of the fact that the latter has not yet appeared
before the congressional committee for the investigation of un-American activities, he must be Communist influenced. The Hollywood scourge is on
so we hope he will soon be in the clear.

This department has a lot of college newspapers that are really very interesting after all. I have a gem that
I have carefully selected from the library for your examination. If you want to check up on the week-end activities
of your best girl, look for the paper published by the student body of her school and I am fairly
sure she will appear in a list or two that reveal the activities of all the girls. If she is
at Scott, for instance, you will find that about three of the four pages are devoted to listing that she
went to such and such a place and participated in such and such an activity. To save you the trouble,
if she is an A.S. gal, I'll tell you she was at a fraternity house at one of the local
colleges. So you don't believe me? Check the Agnes Scott News if you think you can.

new in color — lighter in weight

CORDUROY SHIRTS

The soft, rich color... the light unhampered comfort you have found in other McGregor sport shirts, now comes to corduroy.
Unusually luxurious in texture, it adds new appeal to your whole appearance. Remarkably light in weight, it brings you new
comfort, without sacrificing any of the warmth and sturdiness for which it is famous.

Blue, Tan, Green and Maroon. Sizes Small, Medium, Medium Large and Large.
