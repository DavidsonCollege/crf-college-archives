10 THE DAVIDSONIAN

Are Conference Tournaments worth it?
HUNG Staff Writer

With Selection Sunday done and gone and the 2009 NCAA Tournament field set in stone, media pundits have shifted their
attention to the usual questions: who will be this year’s Cinderella? How will the small schools fare? Who will make
the Final Four? Is it possible for an unexpected team to win the title? All are valid and intriguing questions
that will pervade the sports media and will be written about ad nauseam over the course of the next month.
Lost in the shuffle, of course, will be the events of the past few weeks: conference tournaments.

This generation of college students takes the institution of conference tournaments for granted. Today, only the Ivy League does not
sponsor an end-of-season tournament to determine its participant in the NCAA Tournament. Other conferences, like the Southern Conference and ACC,
have sponsored tournaments for decades.

The positive aspects of conference tournaments are numerous and have been cited incessantly by conference officials for years. Conference tournaments
are often an economic boon for the member institutions. Furthermore, they generate significant television exposure for the conferences that would
not have ordinarily been given during the regular season.

For the major conferences, a tournament makes even more sense. For teams on the verge of securing an NCAA berth,
the tournament is an opportunity to beat another good team and clinch that spot. Schools from major conferences often boost
their résumés by making surprise appearances in the semifinals of tournaments. It seems to be understood that upsets happen in
conference tournaments, and large schools are often rewarded.

But, what about smaller conferences? The poor record of lower seeds is often cited by the pundits that degrade the
abilities of small conference schools. Well, that is because the smaller conferences often do not send their best representative to
the tournament. While underdogs in big conferences are rewarded and their favorites relatively excused, favorites lose any opportunity at a
bid when they lose in small conferences. All of which certainly begs the question: are conference tournaments worth it for
the little guys? Does the Southern Conference benefit from Chattanooga’s run on its home court?

Small conference tournaments almost never draw large amounts of fans and are often held in terrible locations. The Atlantic Ten
tournament drew horribly when located in Atlantic City for two years. The Southern Conference tournament had horrendous attendance for Davidson’s
victory over Elon in 2008. Even the host Chattanooga Mocs failed to draw an impressive crowd for a tournament championship
earned on their home court.

The West Coast Conference has an interesting system. The top seed (usually Gonzaga) only has to win two games to
clinch the automatic bid. Lower seeds have a much tougher road. This means that the conference is more likely to
send its best team instead of one that got hot and won a few games it should not have won.

Furthermore, small conferences rarely make much money on these tournaments. Sure, the host city bids a little money and attendance
helps a little bit, but do those effects really outweigh the losses?

In spite of my evident reservations, I do think that conference tournaments are a positive overall. I like that every
team starts fresh and almost every team in Division I can say that if they win ten games in a
row they are the National Champions. I do not think that the favorites should have every advantage going into the
tournaments. I do believe, however, that the committee should not look at them nearly as hard. Does Louisville really deserve
the top seed overall because it won its tournament and UNC lost without ACC player-of-the-year Ty Lawson? I certainly do
not like the emphasis placed on these tournaments that do not represent the entire season.

The conference tournaments definitely hurt smaller conferences’ ability to pull upsets in the NCAA tournament. That said, I do believe
that the sense of hope, the joy of something for every school to play for, and the absolute equality, at
least in a small sense, makes conference tournaments a worthy endeavor.

Robinson garners honors, but Wildcats fall to Cougars
JOHN MORGAN Staff Writer

By defeating Furman 66-63 on Feb. 28, the ’Cats earned a five seed and first-round bye in the SoCon tournament.
On the flip side, they had to face College of Charleston, one of only two teams to defeat Davidson twice
this season. Still, the Wildcat squad kept victory a reality even midway through the second half. Time and again, Charleston
pulled ahead, only to allow relentless Davidson comebacks. Riding the effort of Mercedes Robinson ’09 and Mandy Halbersleben ’09, the
team’s two seniors, the Cats drove to within one with six minutes remaining. The back-and-forth action finally took its toll,
however, and Charleston capped the tally at 65-54.

Uncharacteristically poor shooting from the Davidson offense, especially from behind the arc, halted the team’s championship aspirations. “We were ready.
We were prepared,” Head Coach Annette Watts said. “Our kids knew what they needed to do. We didn’t miss many
defensive assignments. [The ball] just did not go in the basket.”

Despite the scoring difficulties, Robinson and Alex Thompson ’10 produced another pair of highlight performances, netting 19 and 21 points,
respectively. While this season rode a roller coaster of highs and lows, the legacy left for the future extends in
a positive fashion. “For this team to rally and do some of the things they did, with the limited resources
that we had thisyear, I’m proud of Baseball * £@ Lp e Men’s Basketball them,” Watts said. “What was special
about this team,” Robinson said, “is that no matter what hurdles we had to overcome or even when things looked
grim, we always stayed positive. We believed in each other, and we never doubted the great team we had the
potential to be.”

Highlights on the year include the unprecedented 7-0 start to the conference schedule and Watts’ first ever victory against Chattanooga.
“I have to look at it on paper to see that we only won 11 games,” she said, “because it
seems like we won so many more, and we did win so many battles.”

For Watts, this year’s team invigorated her approach and direction. “I’m bad to try to sugar-coat things because I feel
like [the players have] been sheltered. But the truth of the matter is they want it told just like it
is. This team taught me that — ‘tell us what we’ve got to do, and push us to get there’.”

And for Robinson, the squad’s cohesiveness pulled everyone together every game, whether win or loss. “All the moments we spent
together laughing, crying, and battling each other on the court are so special to me,” she said. “No specific moments
come to my mind because there are so many. I was blessed to be a part of such a close
team on and off the court.”

Robinson, named to the first team All-SoCon, finished her collegiate career with 1,115 points, seventh on Davidson’s all-time list. Where
she will be most sorely missed is right under the basket, where she grabbed a record-breaking 288 boards this season.
Filling the void becomes the inevitable struggle for next year’s players. “They’ve got to make up for rebounds and points
from Mercedes. And they’ve got to make up for energy and always going hard from Mandy,” Watts said. “There’s a
bunch here that can do it, it’s just a matter of who will step up and get ’er done.”

But along with the void, this year’s seniors leave a legacy of leadership. “It’s not about how many points I
scored or how many rebounds I pulled,” Robinson said, “but that I was someone my team could count on always
to compete and to contribute everything I could for us to be successful on the court.”

The three most likely candidates to take over reins next season: Thompson, Julia Paquette ’10, and Monica Laune ’10. Along
with Ashley Lax ’11 and the four freshmen, the team will witness the arrival of as many as five players
in the recruiting class. Running the gamut from quick point guards to 6’3” posts, the class of 2013 will complement
an already well-balanced force.

The program next year will also benefit from the coaches’ experiences together — Watt’s three assistants will no longer be
newcomers. “I like my new staff. They’ve brought a lot of new energy and new things to practice,” she said.
“But I look forward to it being so much easier for them... The stress level will really be down for
them.”

From this season’s challenge, the players face a direction that, in Robinson’s opinion, heads onward and upward. “They will be
the underdogs next year, and that is a position that Davidson hasn’t been accustomed to in a long time,” she
said. “But I know they will rise to the challenge. I think the girls are ready to step up to
fill in for me and Mandy with confidence. We were faced with plenty of obstacles this year that will prepare
them for anything that comes their way next year.”

Mercedes Robinson ’09 was named first team all-SoCon after averaging 14.7 ppg and 9.6 rpg. She finishes her career as
Davidson’s all-time leading rebounder.
