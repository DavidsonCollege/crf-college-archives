EDITORIAL

INDEPENDENT THINKING
Soon our defenseless heads will be showered with theories, reform measures, eulogies, prophecies, solutions of world problems and all those classes of subjects which make ideal Junior speeches. At such a time we cannot help but try to guess how much of the speaker’s real self goes into his message, how much independent thinking has followed the necessary study of the subject. It is so easy, if our minds are built that way, to accept a statement, simply because we see it in print or because we have heard someone make it. To question it would require that sometimes very difficult operation, the unnecessary use of the mind. Or it may be, we are in the habit of always disagreeing—to immediately take the opposite side and refuse to be shaken from our position by any outside force. We think that this is one of the most common characteristics of a small calibre man. In neither of these two common types of minds do we find much independence of thought. Both follow blindly a habit of mind and refuse to bring into the subject the personal element. It might be well, when the speakers are running over their speeches for the last time, or when the listeners hear these masterpieces by the followers of Demosthenes, that they pause and ask themselves the question, “What do I think about this matter?”

THOUGHTLESSNESS
At Davidson, where the keynote of our life is a friendly and helpful feeling for our neighbor, we are sure that only thoughtlessness could be responsible for the sometimes just complaint which has been made about the order during the speaking exercises. A whispered conversation, a laugh at the wrong moment, leaving the hall during a speech—all these are small things, but they may cause even an experienced speaker much difficulty. Let us all help, and not hinder, the class whose guest we are for these three days.
