**A BEGINNING**

This column is my first attempt at writing anything about sports and for this reason I find it important to express what I feel about athletics. I will not attempt to reach any conclusion as to the place of athletes in a small church-supported liberal arts college. Instead, I am going to put down what I believe about athletes in the hope that any impressions and opinions which I express as sports editor will have some meaning when viewed against a backdrop of my beliefs. Writing what you believe about anything is not easy and in trying to make this article easier, I thought back and remembered three athletes that I have watched perform at Davidson—Charlie Benson, John Huie, and Bill Jarman—these three men have made it easier for me to express what I believe to be the real meaning of athletes and why men play games. The what and why of athletics. And for this and for their performances I thank them.

Many varied reasons have been given for including athletes in the domain of an educational institution—they build character, they provide relaxation, they contribute to good health, they furnish public relations material for the college—these are a few, but do any of these reasons touch upon the question what is athletics? I think not. I have always felt that the real meaning of athletics lies in the actual effort of competition. The effort of the individual to push himself to the full extent of his talent in an attempt to overcome that which he is pitted against, the struggle of the athlete against men or records or time—this is the meaning of athletics.

Why then do men play games? The explanation of this is two-fold: the first is found in the joy of competing and the second in the successful completion of the competitive effort—winning. Anyone who has played a sport knows the joy of competing, whether the individual possesses talent or no talent is of little importance. The joy of competition comes from the struggle of one opponent against another. The varsity athlete, the intramural has-been, the winner, and the loser all know this joy. It originates in the awareness that you are giving the fullest of your talents in an effort to overcome your opponent. Just as a tennis match between Pancho Gonzales and a twelve-year-old can have very little satisfaction or enjoyment for Gonzales neither can any game without the struggle of competition have satisfaction for its participants—the why of athletics can be a very hollow thing without the joy of conflict.

The joy of conflict is the major reason why men, regardless of talents, take part in athletics, but it in itself is not the complete answer. The second reason that sports are played is to win. Winning is the successful completion of the competitive effort, the knowledge and the evidence that your struggle has been successful in overcoming your opponent. Winning is not the race won last year nor the race won an hour ago; it is the instant knowledge that your effort has prevailed. It is the reward of excellence, and excellence is the combination of the competitive effort and the natural talents of the athlete. These natural talents impose a limit upon the degree of excellence an athlete may achieve and thus impose a limit upon the ability of any man to win. But talent has always had an important place in sports. From the earliest records of athletics until today, talent has been viewed and recorded as the most important attribute of an athlete. Every man is not a varsity athlete, there is some selectivity. Because of this reason, the joy of competing is only a part of the why of athletics. The competitive effort is an attempt at perfection and sports are played in an attempt to achieve this perfection. And for the individual with talent this attempt is called excellence and winning is the result of excellence.

How important then is winning? Jim Tatum has been quoted as saying that winning is not the most important thing, it is the only thing. I doubt that winning is this important. The man of inferior talents knows that he cannot defeat the superior athlete, and yet he plays the game as fiercely as he is capable. This man surely knows the joy of reaching out for his own perfection, but he cannot experience the joy of knowing excellence in his sport. This joy can come only to the winner. What then is the fate of the loser? For the man of little talent, his joy rests in the knowledge that he has given the best of his ability to win, prevented from doing so only by the limitations of his talents. And what can provide more satisfaction than the experience of the athlete of inferior capabilities who, because he has pushed himself to his limits, defeats his more superiorly gifted opponent? For the athlete with talent, winning is the final result of playing, and anything short of winning will rob the sport of a great deal of the joy that makes it worth playing.

I have not mentioned the crowd; the spectator or the fan because I have been talking about athletics and they are an active thing; watching athletics is a passive thing. Watching is the something extra. It is the gravy, the enjoyment, the identification, but it is not the playing. Perhaps the sport cannot be separated from its audience as I have done, but I believe it can.

This column is what I feel about athletics, and for this reason in the future this column will attempt to express the view that sports are played both for the joy of competition and to win, that talent is an important part of athletics, and that all athletes must seek to find their own personal perfection. And further that this staff and myself will not only report the competition as it occurs, but seek to recognize those teams, coaches, and individuals who play their particular game in an effort to exceed the limitation of their own talents, achieve excellence, and win.

**AN ANSWER**

Some people will agree with what I have written in this article, some will not, and some won't give a damn, but at Davidson we have men of talent who have been told that they can’t win because this school is academically too good (?), or because the other man is bigger, or because the newspapers, students, and coaches don't expect them to win. I ask these men, is this true? Can’t you win? Is there anything short of winning for you? And how much of the joy of playing has been lost in losing?

**Cats Defeat Eastern Kentucky**

Davidson's beleaguered baseball team finally broke back into the win column Wednesday by nipping Eastern Kentucky College 7-6 here. The win raised the ’Cat won-loss record to 3-8.

The ‘Cats appeared out of the game in the early innings as the Maroons scored once in the first inning and four more times in the second. Starter Barry Teague’s wildness, plus the visitors’ adept bunting and clutch hitting contributed to the 5-2 deficit after two innings. As the game progressed, however, Teague settled down, holding the Kentuckians scoreless. He was removed for pinch hitter Don Davidson. To keep the best hitting he had in the game, Coach Tom Stevens moved Tom Hamilton in from center field to pitch and put Davidson in the outfield. This move paid off in the seventh and ninth innings. The ‘Cats parlayed three hits and three Maroon errors into four runs in the seventh. Eddie Earle's two-out run-producing single tied the game 6-6. In the ninth, shortstop Phil Squier led off with his third single of the day. Tony McNay sacrificed him to second, Earle was passed intentionally, and after two outs, Don Davidson lined a single to left, scoring Squier. Hamilton picked up the victory in relief, his second against one loss.

This was about the only bright spot for the ‘Cats during the last week. Last Saturday they hosted V.P.I. for two games, dropping both, and were buried twice Monday under the power of nationally ranked West Virginia. In the V.P.I. twin bill, the Davidson baseballers were unable to combine good hitting and good pitching, although they demonstrated both. In the first game, Dave Johnson and Paul Briggs allowed the Gobblers only one run and six hits. Yet, they were no match for VPI's Lee Melear, who shut out the ‘Cats.

**Successful Cindermen Hosts At Tri-Team Meet**

Coach Heath Whittle’s very successful Davidson track team met the University of Richmond and Appalachian here this afternoon in a three-way meet scheduled to get underway at 3 p.m. In an interview earlier this week, Coach Whittle echoed his previous praise of his athletes and anticipated another fine showing today. His praise follows the team's performance in the fourth annual Piedmont Relays at Furman last Saturday. Against such competition as Clemson, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Furman, the ‘Cats amassed a respectable 25½ points, missing a fourth-place tie with Tennessee by only 2½ points. The talented Furman squad proved to be bad hosts, as senior track captain Bob Cordle...

**Coxton Shines As Football Squad Ends Spring Drills**

Next year’s varsity football team all but put the wraps on spring workouts Saturday with its annual game-scrimmage at Johnston Field. The white team defeated the reds, 13-7, in the spirited climax to what Coach Bill Dole termed, “the best spring practice we’ve ever had.” The white offense began moving effectively in the second quarter as it drove three-fourths of the field for the first score of the afternoon. Quarterback Benny Coxton ripped off three first downs in as many carries, and then directed three more, before Pat Fisher smashed over in two tries from the five. Bill Dole’s extra point made the score 7-0. The white team rolled again in the third period behind the running of Coxton, Fisher, and Dave Lopp. The score came when Coxton jaunted 30 yards through the middle of red defenses after finding his pass receivers covered on the play. Dole’s second conversion attempt was blocked. Late in the game the reds marched 60 yards to score behind the quarterbacking of rising sophomore Sid Tompkins, and the running of backs Tom Worrall and Bill Joyner. Joyner slanted over from the...Four, and Dole converted, this time for the red unit to end the afternoon’s scoring at 13-7. Chief among the highlights of the day and the spring was the return to form of explosive quarterback Benny Coxton, who has been out of contact for eighteen months with a shoulder injury. Coxton ran wild over the defensive unit and was the vital cog in an offense which unofficially gained nineteen first downs to the opposition’s eight. On the limited occasions when he felt it advisable to pass, he did that nearly as well. Dole calls Coxton the best quarterback he's ever seen in the Southern Conference, and adds, “I’ve never coached a player with as much ability.” Asked if the two-season lay-off had hurt Coxton, Dole smiled and answered, “It didn't seem to."

Coach Dole admitted he was well pleased with the squad's performance as a whole and was cautiously optimistic about next season's prospects. He cited tackles Dick Fulp and Bill Dole, guards Russ Walls and Morris Williams, and center Britt Smith as forming the core of a veteran line which will be much the same, but more experienced than last year's. With the added depth of a fine crop of sophomores, Dole plans to employ a two-unit system with both teams seeing approximately equal offensive and defensive duty. The staff feels that the biggest change from last year will be a great improvement in defensive end play where a trio of rising sophomores Phil Hightower, Jim Rollins, and Pack Hindsley, along with rising junior Steve Davidson, have all looked good.

With nothing but good things to say about Coxton, Dole is quick to add that he thinks highly of a couple of other signal callers—veteran Earl Cole and Sid Tompkins. While giving a generous appraisal of his own squad, Dole stressed the fact that most other schools in the conference will also return veteran units. “Our schedule is a good one,” he says, “and a tough one.” How the record will reflect next season's endeavors he declines to comment, but all in all says Dole, “We'll be an improved football team.”

They took 10 events and swept to a 12-point margin over second place Clemson. For Davidson, the team of Cordle, Turner, Kelly, and Watson finished second in the 440-yard relay behind a Clemson team which tied the meet record at 42.5 seconds. The same four men brought the 'Cats a fourth in the 880-yard relay. In the two-mile relay, Reese, Phillips, Leslie, and Martin finished fifth. Individual performances by Cordle, Turner, and Fraser aided the Davidson cause. Cordle finished in a tie for third in the broad jump with a leap of 22’5". Alan Turner ran the fastest hundred yards of his career, but his 9.6 was only good for third; Segal of Furman set the meet record in winning this event with a 9.6. In the high jump, Fraser placed third for Davidson; again, the first-place finish was good for a meet record.

In summing up the meet, Coach Whittle said he was “very pleased" with his team's showing. He noted that the ’Cats will meet VPI here Wednesday at 3 p.m. This will be an excellent opportunity to see a successful Wildcat athletic team.

The winning column last Wednesday by whipping lost record to 3-12 on the season. The ’Cats out on three hits. In the second game, the ‘Cats jumped out to an early 4-2 lead on the clutch hitting of Lance Walker and Phil Squier, but lefty Barry Teague had control problems and couldn't hold it. V.P.I. fought back to take a 6-4 decision. The ‘Cats missed a big chance in the fourth inning when they had the bases loaded with no one out and failed to score.

Monday, the hapless ’Cats proved no match for West Virginia’s strong Mountaineers. In the first game, every Mountaineer hit as they bombed Paul Briggs, Earl Cole, and Tom Hamilton for 13 hits and won 11-3. In the second game, the visitors put on a blazing display of base running, stealing 10 bases, including home twice, and rolled over the ‘Cats 10-3. Ronnie Rudolph was the losing pitcher. Yesterday, the 'Cats journeyed to Greenville, S.C. to play Furman’s Paladins in hopes of upping their 0-6 conference record.

Fuzzballers Nip Pfeiffer: Beaten By Indiana, U.N.C.
BY CHARLIE SHAPARD

The Davidson College Tennis Team swept over the Pfeiffer College team, 4-2, on Friday, April 12, in a non-conference match. Monday, the local netters met a strong Indiana team and were swamped 9-0 by the Big Ten school. Coach Harry Fogleman said Monday, “Indiana is probably the best team we'll meet with the possible exception of the University of North Carolina team, the Atlantic Coast Champs,” whom the ‘Cat netters met Thursday, losing 9-0.

Winning for the Wildcat netmen in the Pfeiffer match were Captain Bobby Austell, Bill Backlund, and Frank Bumgardner; Austell teamed with sophomore Bill Shutt to take the other ‘Cat win. Thursday, the Wildcat netters dropped a 9-0 match to the powerful University of North Carolina Tennis Team. Hidden in this uninteresting score was some of the best tennis that has been played at Davidson all year. Bobby Austell nearly captured his match with Basketball ace, Charlie Shaffer, before losing the final set before an estimated crowd of 500. The Freshman team captured four singles matches and broke even with the UNC Tarbabies when the final doubles match was called off.

Next Monday, the Wildcats travel to Raleigh to play the State College netters; on Wednesday, the ‘Cats play Guilford at Guilford. On Friday, they play VMI at Lexington, Va., and continue their Virginia trip on Saturday to meet VPI at Blacksburg. Davidson now has a 1-3 conference record and hopes to return with an even slate. Fogleman stated, “The boys still think that they are going to have a winning season and with the toughest part of the season gone, we should close with a fine record.”

The freshmen netters lost a close match to the Greenville High School team, 5-4. Woody Cleveland lost the number one match, while Dick Hurd took the number two match. Other Davidson wins came from Jeff Frank, Jack Goodykoontz, and in the number one doubles with Hurd and Cleveland teaming together.

INFERIORITY CAN BE FUN

The second gravest problem confronting college students today is inferiority feelings. (The first gravest problem is, of course, the recent outbreak of moult among sorority house canaries.) Let us today look into the causes of inferiority feelings and their possible cures.

Psychologists divide inferiority feelings into three principal categories: 1. Physical inferiority. 2. Mental inferiority. 3. Financial inferiority. (A few say there is also a fourth category: ichthyological inferiority—a feeling that other people have prettier fish—but I believe this is common only along the coasts and in the Orinoco Basin.)

Let us start with the feeling of physical inferiority, perhaps the easiest to understand. Naturally, we are inclined to feel inferior to the brawny football captain or the beautiful homecoming queen. But we should neither be brawny nor beautiful, who marks in the world. Look at Napoleon. Look at Socrates. Look at Caesar. Look at Lassie.

We are inclined to feel inferior by looking at the outside. Sometimes, of course, you can. Take Marlboro Cigarettes, for example. Just one look at that jolly red-and-white pack—so bright and pert—so neat but not gaudy—so perfectly in place whether you are at a formal dinner or a beach picnic—so invariably correct for any time, clime, or condition—one look, I say, at this pack and you know it has to contain cigarettes of unparalleled perfection. And you are right! That pure white Marlboro filter, that fine, flavorful blend of Marlboro tobaccos, will give you a smoke to make the welkin ring, whatever that is. So those of you who have just been sitting and admiring your Marlboro packs since the beginning of the semester, why don’t you open a pack and light one? Light a cigarette, I mean—not the package. Then you can settle back and smoke your Marlboro and, at the same time, continue to gaze rapturously at the pack. Thus you will be twice as happy as you are now, if that is possible.

But I digress. Let us turn now to the second category, mental inferiority. A lot of people think they are dumber than other people. This is not so. It must be remembered that there are different kinds of intelligence. Take, for instance, the classic case of the Sigafoos brothers, Claude and Sturbridge, students at Wake Forest. It was always assumed that Claude was the more intelligent just because he knew more than Sturbridge about the arts, the sciences, the social sciences, the humanities, and like that. Sturbridge, on the other hand, was ten times smarter than Claude when it came to tying granny knots. But no matter; everybody looked down on “Stupid Sturbridge,” as they called him, and looked up at “Clever Claude,” as they called him. But who do you think turned out to be the smart one when their granny almost got loose and ran away? You guessed it—good old Stupid Sturbridge.

We arrive now at the final category, financial inferiority. One way to deal with this condition is to increase your income. You can, for example, become a fence. Or you can pose for a life class, if your college is well heated. But a better way to handle financial inferiority is to accept it philosophically. Look on the bright side of poverty. True, others may have more money than you have, but look at all the things you have that they don’t—debts, for instance, and hunger cramps. And what about friendship? You don’t need money to have friends, and let me tell you something, good people: the older you get, the more you will realize that nothing is so precious as friendship, and the richest man in the world is not the one with the most money.

Rich or poor, you can all afford the pleasure of Marlboro, available at equitable prices in all 50 states of the Union.
