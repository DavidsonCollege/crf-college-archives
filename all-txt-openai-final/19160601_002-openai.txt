ALUMNI LUNCHEON.
As the shadows began to lengthen and the biddies to gather around their mother, the old boys on the Hill Tuesday came from every part of the town and campus to assemble at the Y. M. C. A. for alumni luncheon. Simultaneously began to peal forth music’s sweet melody, a la college songs, interrupted here and there by spasms of yells from classes old and young. The alumni in the embryonic state were put to their best to out-yell their fellows of less hair and more whiskers. Under circumstances that both aroused and bespoke the love of one hundred and thirty fellows who are first, last, and all the time for Davidson, their alma mater. This was reunion year for all classes that have graduated every fifth year back. Hence, it might be said that the banquet was in honor of the classes of 1916, 1911, 1906, 1901, 1886, 1881, 1876, etc. These were classes most in evidence, but as the train cannot pass the station without certain Sophomores being there, so cannot a commencement be “pulled off” without ’93. The representation from all the intermediate classes seemed to be larger than usual. It was proven on this occasion that men, like women, can do two things at one and the same time. The annual business meeting of the Alumni Association was held while the menu was being carried out per direction of the caterer and to the delight of the fellows. R. M. Miller, '76, Charlotte, N. C., was elected president for the ensuing year; W. T. Bailey, Greenwood, S. C., ’06, vice-president; Dr. Jno. Wilson McConnell, Davidson, N. C., '02, secretary. Trustees elected by the alumni were Dr. Walter L. Lingle, Richmond, Va., and A. L. Mills, Greenville, S. C. W. T. Bailey, ’06, was toastmaster, and the speeches were spicy—some witty, some eloquent, all interesting. From the time grace was said until the master of ceremonies called attention to the fact that the hour for the next number on the day’s program had arrived, the meeting was on the gallop. The “hit” of the evening was a short oration by Dr. Shearer, entitled “You would scarce expect one of my age.” Thus ended the annual meeting of the Alumni Association all too soon.

DISTINCTIONS ANNOUNCED | VISITING TRUSTEES TROPHIES AND MEDALS
Immediately following the Junior Orations, Dr. T. W. Lingle announced the distinctions in scholarship for the year, an account of such distinctions being found elsewhere in this issue. Judge Jno. M. Dodge then presented the athletic trophies: the class football championship cup to the Freshmen’s team, of which J. Pickens was captain; the baseball cup to the Sophomore’s team, of which R. P. Richardson was captain; and the track cup to the Sophomore’s team, of which G. S. Crouch was captain. The medals won during the past year in the two Literary Societies, the Philanthropic and the Eumenean, were presented by Rev. D. P. McGeachy. Four inter-collegiate debater’s emblems were awarded: for the Davidson-Erskine debate to W. H. Neal and J. A. Thames; for the Emory-Davidson debate to J. G. Patton, Jr., and F. H. Smith. The Fresh-Soph declaimer’s medals to G. C. Bellingrath in the Eu. and to G. F. Webber in the Phi.; the Fresh-Soph debater’s medals to G. C. Bellingrath in the Eu. and to J. L. Fowle in the Phi.; the Junior-Senior debater’s medals to L. G. Edgerton in the Eu. and to R. H. Ratchford in the Phi.; the Essayists medals to W. Y. Sayad in the Eu., and to R. H. Ratchford in the Phi.; and the Fiction medal from both societies to L. A. Chambliss. A prize consisting of a medal and a set of Shakespeare’s works, given by the Independent Magazine for excellence in composition connected with some phase of Shakespeare’s life or works, was won by L. A. Chambliss. Only members of the Senior English class were eligible to compete for this prize.

OFFICERS ELECTED BY ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION
The annual meeting of the Athletic Association for the purpose of electing officers for the ensuing year was held Thursday afternoon, May 25, in Shearer Hall. At this meeting, characterized by good order and a systematic dispatch of business, capable and efficient men were placed at the helm of the various athletic activities at Davidson. To the office of president of the association for the coming year J. P. Laird was elected by acclamation. Hugh Grey was elected vice-president, and J. P. McNeill secretary-treasurer. Managers and assistant managers for the various other teams were elected as follows: Manager of the baseball team of 1917, S. C. Harris; manager of track team, Hugh Grey; assistant managers of football, R. C. Jones and T. W. Clark. A. S. Tompkins and T. A. Finley were elected by the association as members of the Executive Committee of the Athletic Association.

AN INTERESTING FIND.
A very interesting find has recently been made at Davidson. Some workmen, while digging a ditch across Main street, discovered a gold medal, which proved to be a Fowle Orator’s Prize. On one side was engraved the name “J. W. Osborne, Charlotte, N. C.,” and the date “1878.” On the other side was the motto “Bene dicere et recte agere.” The medal is round and has a ring in the top. It is not tarnished in the least, being practically as perfect as when new. The owner of the medal is now Hon. James W. Osborne, a prominent lawyer of New York. The medal will be returned tohim by Mr. Parks, of the Bell Telephone Co., as soon as his address can be secured.
