ABOVE: The vehicle that so totally looks like the Vamonos Van when you’re dark and it's drunk out

Holy crap, student just got on wrong van

CORNELIUS—In what has been met with a campus-wide chorus of ‘how the hell did he actually manage to do that,’ Mario Swartz ’06 mistook another vehicle for the college-operated Vamonos Van this weekend. Instead of heading back to campus after an early night out this Friday, Swartz found himself en route to The Pines.

“Holy freaking crap, I’m on the wrong van,” said Swartz out loud, just moments after stepping aboard the excursion vehicle of Davidson’s most prominent retirement village. “I’m surrounded by old people, and I’m on the wrong van.”

The confusion leading to the blunder began when Swartz and a group of friends were departing Cornelius’ Galway Hooker Irish Pub after some early drinks Friday evening, and were preparing to board the Vamonos Van, as they usually do, back to campus. Coincidentally, The Pines van was stopped outside the Galway Hooker at the exact same time, in the process of transporting residents back home after a late evening of Bingo at the Cornelius-area Lion’s Club.

“Apparently they had to stop at the bar because some resident was having a bladder control problem or something,” Swartz later reflected on the evening. “Which I guess is sort of a coincidence, because I had told my group to wait up as we were running out so I could use the can. God, after all that stout I had to piss like a race horse.”

As Swartz ran out of the pub to join his departing friends, he inadvertently stepped aboard the wrong vehicle. “They look exactly the same,” said Swartz, “except for the little sign on the side or whatever. I mean, it was dark—and I was pretty drunk... Oh who am I kidding, I’m never going to live this down.”

Realizing that both vans had already gotten underway, Swartz had no option but to ride back to Davidson with a busload of senior citizens. “It’s not like it was all that bad,” he recalled. “In fact, they seemed pretty happy to see me. I learned an awful lot about the Korean War, and even got to play some Cat’s Cradle. Which is actually sorta fun when you're wasted. In an I’m going to die soon sort of way.”

Having since had time to reflect upon the incident, Swartz is proud that, despite his inebriated state, he was able to ascertain that something was wrong within moments of stepping on board The Pines vehicle. “I’m sorry, but Davidson girls don’t look that bad,” he said. “And I’d been drinking.”

In Response to Feb. 11 “DCPC ‘prank’ in fact big corporate marketing deal”

I am sitting here in Daytona with my pit crew on the eve of the big one, the 500. Though my pit boss is yelling at me to get back on the track to test his latest set-up, I felt the need to e-mail in this response to your in-depth reporting on our worthy attempt to display our new NASCAR corporate logo from the DCPC church steeple. What you said was all true, but requires a bit more explanation.

Yes, our church leaders have been concerned about the decline in Sunday worship attendance. Some had been telling me since my arrival at DCPC that I am a poor preacher, but I had assumed they were referring to the amount of compensation they are offering me. Turns out they meant something else. Duh!

What finally caught my attention was the one Sunday in the past year when we could not blame bad weather for our poor attendance, and I preached my heart out to the small congregation but the offering plate had just its usual smattering of one dollar bills. Desperate to turn the ship around, the next day I shared with our governing board that prior to entering the ministry I had experience with driving go-karts. So why not try our hand at NASCAR racing? This led to the decision to invest church funds in the venture.

Then came the now-famous “Boogity, boogity, boogity” Sunday, after which construction engineers were called in from Physical Plant to check the structural stability of the DCPC roof, unaccustomed as it is to such enthusiastic outbursts. Then elder Kennedy did his daring thing with letters to THE YOWL the steeple clock. Now it is race week in Daytona and... well, here we are. Pray for us to fight the good fight and finish the race, receiving the crown of victory.

While we are here, I have been preaching from the roof of the infield concession stand each evening. After all, that is how Robert Schuller got his start and that led to the Crystal Cathedral. Man, are they hungry for the Word down here! We plan to return to our corner in Davidson near the left field foul pole of the campus and really stir things up with some crazy contemporary architecture and wild worship.

Thank you for the Yowl’s continued interest in DCPC.
