Committee discusses needs

groups, including students from farming and unskilled family backgrounds.

The evening meeting of the Goals Committee began with a re-evaluation of its purposes. According to Professor of Religion David
Kaylor, the committee had spent a good deal of the time during its February 21st meeting discussing plans for the
Carnegie Building, only to find out later that the Trustees had decided earlier in the day to turn the building
into a guest house.

“I don’t have any desire myself to be a part of a committee that is simply rubber stamping decisions that
have already been made,” Kaylor said. “I feel that there’re some hidden agendas here that we don’t know about,” he
concluded.

President Samuel R. Spencer Jr. assured Kaylor that no effort had been made to conceal information from the committee, and
that the Carnegie Building had been the only subject that needed immediate attention by the Board of Trustees.

As the meeting continued, Professor of Chemistry J.N. Burnett said that he needed more data from faculty, students, and administrators
about goals before making decisions about the areas Stair had outlined at the opening of the meeting.

“I have the feeling that we’re kind of working in a vacuum,” he said. “I just can’t gaze into a
crystal ball and see what things are going to be like in 12 years.”

that the college should consider numerous ways of using its available facilities before building new facilities. Spencer cited the increasing
competitiveness of state institutions and said that Davidson should strive for first quality academic programs in all areas.

SGA President John Munce proposed that the committee direct discussion to a recent Senate resolution dealing with student ideas about
goals for the college. He suggested that this might be a jumping-off point for the committee. The group considered the
Senate’s resolution, and near the end of the meeting concluded that a similar report from faculty and administration members on
the committee would be helpful.

The committee decided to consider these perspectives on goals at their April 23rd meeting.
