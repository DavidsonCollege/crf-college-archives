**Davidson professor uncovers glimpses of his own past at local flea market**

Staff Writer

Davidson classics professor Michael Toumazou has headed an archaeological dig in Cyprus, his home country, for the past ten summers; for him, finding artifacts usually involves hours of picking through the dirt under the sun. But while browsing the Charlotte Metrolina Flea Market last year, Toumazou unearthed invaluable links to the Cypriot past—without a pickaxe or trowel. On the table of a Floridian dealer, Toumazou discovered two small wooden boxes that together contained 128 glass slides, each about four inches tall and wide.

“I was beside myself,” he remembers. “Out of the thousands and thousands of tables laid out there, I was amazed that I could find the two boxes with Cyprus slides.” Toumazou has developed approximately twenty of the slides and has assembled the photographs into a presentation of prints, which the VAC’s Smith Gallery will display until March 2. The slides offer insights into life in Cyprus at the beginning of the century. “From a historical point of view, these are probably as valuable as anything I’ve found in our Davidson dig there,” reflects Toumazou.

Some of the slides present landscapes, ruins, monuments, and churches, but most portray scenes of Cypriots at work: fishermen mending their nets, shepherds guiding their flocks, and women molding pottery, sewing lace, baking bread in outdoor ovens, and gossiping at the village fountains. “It’s striking because a lot of acts that they show are clearly not practiced anymore,” explains Toumazou. “One picture shows a man plowing the fields using the same methods that archaeological evidence shows were used in 2000 B.C.”

Although most of the slides show objects that have become outdated, Toumazou remembers some—including the outdoor ovens, plows, and wheat threshers—from his childhood. In fact, many of the slides were taken in his hometown of Famagusta. Chemistry professor Ruth Beeston, who accompanied Toumazou on the archaeological dig in Cyprus last year, values the slides as a historical record of a culture. “It is interesting that the slides feature not just scenery and architecture, but a record of daily life among the Cypriot people. These are not somebody’s ‘snapshots’ or pretty postcard pictures,” she says. “They are carefully composed images with attention to details of facial expression and costume.”

Because the collection came to Toumazou without any information as to its origins, we can only speculate as to who took them and when. In studying the slides, Toumazou has detected several pieces of evidence that could solve the mystery. The larger of the two boxes, which contains eighty-one rectangular slides, bears the label of the Lumiere company, a famous French motion picture company. The presence of this label indicates that a foreign photojournalist took the pictures in Cyprus and then developed them in Lyon, France.

Toumazou found clues as to the slides’ age in a picture accompanying a 1926 National Geographic article about Cyprus, where he noticed a tree standing in front of a church. Because a picture in Toumazou’s collection shows the same church and tree, and because the tree in his collection is shorter than the one in the National Geographic article, Toumazou has deduced that his slide was taken before 1926. He finds it possible that many of the slides in the larger box were taken around the same time.

**Congratulations to Students, Faculty, and Staff of Davidson College**

During the last academic year, you borrowed over 80,000 items from the Library, and now the inventory of the collection for 1999-2000 has been completed. The report: The lowest loss rate in 40 years! Congratulations and many thanks to the Campus Family for continuing one of the special elements of the Honor System and our life at Davidson. You’re the greatest!

The smaller box, on the other hand, which holds forty-seven square slides, contains several images that bear close resemblance to the photographs published by the Mangoian brothers in their 1947 book *The Island of Cyprus*. Based on the similarities, Toumazou suspects that the Mangoian brothers took some of the slides in the box in the years preceding 1947. Toumazou plans to continue studying the slides for more definitive information.and he hopes to assemble the prints into a coffee table book. Eventually, he plans to donate the slides to a historical foundation in Nicosia, Cyprus. “From the beginning, as a scholar and a native of Cyprus,” explains Toumazou, “I thought that they should stay together and be taken to Cyprus for an archive. I didn’t buy them for myself, and that’s ultimately what I want to do.” Some quotes courtesy of College Communications.

Project Life Players mix medicine with drama

In the movie Patch Adams, Robin Williams claims, “If you treat a disease you win or lose. If you treat the person, you win every time.” A dedicated group of Davidson students has taken this to heart, creating the Project Life Players. This group, clad only in jeans, black t-shirts, and sunglasses, and armed only with five green wooden blocks, travels to local hospitals to perform for sick children.

Senior pre-med theater major Cari Lentzsch originally created the Project Life Players as a way to connect her two passions. According to Cari, “There is a healing process to theater, and nothing warms your heart like seeing a child smiling at you. Whether we perform for one child or for twenty, we are making a difference in somebody’s life.” The group is not associated with the highly successful campus Bone Marrow Drive. Rather, the group is named in honor of Cari’s grandparents.

The group holds practices late at night in Cunningham. In order to warm up and get in a silly and creative mood, the group starts each rehearsal with an 80’s retro dance party (think “Fame” meets “Flashdance” meets Jane Fonda). Then come the fun theater games designed to get people in the theater mood: “Be a table, be a sports car, now an ice cream cone...” (Brownie points to whoever can identify the source of that quote). The group also has some bonding activities (for example, the human knot) before settling down to business.

One of the most prominent examples of the group’s commitment towards fun is that for the audition, each performer was asked to read both Piglet and Pooh from a scene from “Winnie-the-Pooh”, and then asked to be a “cute fuzzy-wuzzy little animal.” The Project Life Players write and perform their own material. During the fall semester, they dramatized three classic children’s stories: Where the Wild Things Are, Dr. Doolittle, and Nefara’s Beautiful Daughters (an African tale). “A lot of the joy in this group comes through our own creativity,” said Cari. The shows have also been adapted for members of the audience to become involved in the show.

The rehearsals are extremely laid back, with the group coming to consensus over individual issues and no true director actually giving out orders. In essence, it’s an actor’s dream come true. But the Project Life Players are not all fun and games. The students must be committed enough to attend rehearsals and be willing to work hard. The unofficial mantra of the Project Life Players is “We will have fun, but we will work hard.”

However, even more of a challenge for the Players than the time commitment is the fact that hospitals are not the happiest places on earth, and many a poor pre-med student has struggled through Organic Chemistry only to realize he or she dislikes sickness. Some people avoid hospitals at all costs. But Chelsea Lewis ‘04, Music and Theatre Fellow Chris Walters, William Graham ‘02, Elizabeth Smith ‘04, Alex Jamieson ‘04, Susan Robison ‘04, Kenneth Franklin ‘04, Gray Lyons ‘03, Clinton Rickards ‘04, Sheila Natarajan ‘03, Mary Donoghue ‘04, Jackie Protos ‘04, and Shaheen Counts ‘01, don’t.

There’s something magical about making children smile, about taking somebody who is sick and having such an impact on that person that he or she can forget his or her own problems, and instead worry about how Max’s adventures with the Wild Things will turn out. Yet, the group also has a profound impact on the performers. As Cari so adequately put it, “This is the kind of group that will change the lives of anyone who comes into contact with it.” It’s that simple.
