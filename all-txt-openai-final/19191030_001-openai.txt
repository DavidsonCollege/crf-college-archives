Be Prepared - For Fall

FOR A GREATER DAVIDSON

Vol. VI. DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N. C., OCTOBER 30, 1919. No. 9

S. H. Askew Succeeds Dave Rob- S. H. Askew Editor-in-Chief of Davidsonian.

A meeting of the student body was called Friday morning for the purpose of electing an Editor-in-Chief of The Davidsonian.
D. W. Roberts, who was elected Editor-in-Chief last year, has been detained from college on account of illness and has
therefore tendered his resignation. The result of the election showed that S. H. Askew was elected Editor-in-Chief for the coming
year.

Wildcats Preparing to Give Ga. Tech Hard Fight

Team Still Crippled, but Hopes are Entertained That All Regulars Will be Fit for Saturday’s Fray

The center of football interest in the south during the week is turned to the Georgia Tech-Davidson game. The fur
will fly and the dust will rise when the Golden Tornado and Wildcats clash on Grant field next Saturday. One
of the hardest fought games of the season is anticipated. Davidson will enter the game greatly handicapped by the absence
of several players from her lineup on account of injury. Some of those on the injured list will probably play
but it will be under great difficulty. Jack Black will probably still be out of the game with his broken
hand. Johnny Johnson is still suffering with an injured shoulder and Hammett from injuries sustained in the V. M. I.
game. Brady has been confined to his bed for several days and will not be in trim for the fray.
“Doc” LaFar is still out of the game with a wrenched knee as a result of the Clemson game and
will not be permitted to play Saturday. The Wildcats then with five Varsity men on the injured list will be
greatly handicapped in meeting the strong Tech aggregation. Tech has a powerful team this year and their record so far
goes to prove that the Purple and Gold warriors have acquitted themselves well. Rolling up a total of 184 points
against their opponents’ 0 in the first five games and finally capping the climax by holding Pittsburgh to a 16
to 6 score, is an accomplishment to be praised indeed. Davidson, however, has always proven a worthy rival and is
considered such according to forecasts from Tech, and much interest is being manifested as to the final result. The two
teams were unable to meet last year on account of Uncle Sam’s Army regulations, but the result of the game
in '17, when the Red and Black crossed Tech’s line for a touchdown and also kicked a field goal, is
still afresh in the minds of the two student bodies. A fair comparison of the two teams may be compiled
as follows: Wake Forest held Tech to two touchdowns. Tech’s team, however, was split, on account of a double header,
and this must be taken into consideration in comparing it with Davidson's 21 to 0 victory over the Baptists. The
best comparison can be secured from the games with Clemson. After holding Tech scoreless the first half, the Tiger resistance
finally crumpled and four touchdowns were put across. Clemson won the week before from Davidson, 7 to 0. There are
the figures. Figure out the dope and estimate Davidson’s chances for yourself, great handicap and against all odds. If she
loses, the Golden Tornado no doubt will wear a few scars to remind her of the hard-won victory. It will
be a clean, hard-fought game with straight football and line plunging featuring. The proteges of Coaches Heisman (Continued on Page

Reporter’s Club Holds Big Feed

Members Growing in Weight at Least — Spence and Askew Make Talk — Freshmen Furnish Amusement

A blinding flash! A loud report! And it was over. The men who were able to do so slowly wound
their dreary way toward their rooms and rest sweet rest. For McIlwaine performed a flashlight operation on the assembled body
of Davidsonian reporters and future members of the newsgatherers gang and thus ended the feed given by the Reporters club,
ably supported by the business or rather the financial department, to the freshmen who have written for the livingest wire
on the hill. “I say we did” was the unanimous reply of those invited, and inviting, when asked if they
had enjoyed the festivities. “I’ll say they did” is the verdict of the press representative present, after seeing the crowd
fall-to on the eats. The show began at 9:15 Saturday night in the classroom of M. S. and T., with
the feed proper. The chairman of the committee on amusement (for upperclassmen) and torture (for freshmen) then announced that the
guests would give an exhibition of their literary talents. They did. If that night's work is a fair sample of
newspaper ability as contained in the fresh class, The Davidsonian in the next few years will be entirely given over
to the peanut parcher. Mauze headed the list of attractions.

Dr. A. S. Johnson to Lead Y. M. C. A. Evangelistic Campaign

Services to Begin Next Tuesday Night, Lasting Three Days — Special Music

Everybody is looking forward with intense interest to the annual campaign of the Y. M. C. A. to be held
November 4, 5, and 6. This year promises an unusually interesting campaign, for many reasons. Dr. Albert Sidney Johnson, pastor
of the First Presbyterian church, Charlotte, will be the speaker at the meetings. This fact alone gives the assurance of
a successful campaign. Dr. Johnson is a man of unusual ability.

V. M. I. Vanquishes Valiantly

Scrapping Presbyterians, 14 to 7

Handicapped by Loss of Four Regulars, but Fought Gamely — Leech Outstanding Star for the Cadets

In a game that was hotly contested and full of thrills from start to finish the V. M. I. Cadets
defeated the Red and Black at Lynchburg on the 25th, by a score of 14 to 7. The Wildcats put
up a great fight against their heavier opponents but were handicapped by the loss of four regulars who were kept
out of the game by injuries. Brady and LaFar were absent from their usual places in the line, while Black
and Johnston — the former with a broken hand and the latter with a badly injured shoulder — went in
for the last part of the game, but were too late to overcome the lead of the Cadets. Of the
two teams which were first lined up against each other, however, V. M. I. played the better football and earned
the victory. The Virginians started off with a rush. They began a steady march down the field after receiving the
initial kickoff, and by a varied attack of line plays and end runs, carried the ball to D. C.'s 8-yard
line. With the ball in the shadow of her own goal the Davidson defense stiffened and the ball went over
on downs. The half ended without either goal line being seriously menaced again. At this point it looked like anybody's
game, although the Cadets had gained more ground than the lads from North Carolina.M. L's ball in midfield. The third
quarter brought disaster to Quarter up. Score: V. M. 1.0; D.C. 0. The Wildcats, with a “Dere Mable” letter which
at first appeared to be of the “it’s all off” variety, but when read by alternate lines transformed itself into
an epistle of the “Sweet Papa” kind. R. F. Davidson demonstrated beyond the shadow of a doubt the fact that
Davidson should be a great seaport by reason of the fact that it has the two requisites, viz: plenty of
water and a “shipping business of no mean proportions.” X next gave a demonstration of his jibing ability. His name
is withheld through fear that the representatives of the Cracker State might hold one of their famous cravat parties with
X as the center of attraction.

An apple bobbing contest next was the center of attention for the crowd as a whole, and ten freshmen in
particular. All were declared losers and, as a penalty, were requested to clean up after the event. The proceedings then
proceeded to a joke contest, in which some originality was at least displayed in the coinage of the word choiress.
Booth and Cooper were declared winners and forced to accept, as prizes, a cake of Octagon soap and a mouse
trap, respectively. The booby prize, in the form of an all-day sucker, was distributed between Davidson and Smith, the former
getting the candy and the latter the stick.

A poem in rank verse was endured from Florida Davis as best the listeners were able. Wolfolk rendered a eulogy
on The Davidsonian, Peanut Parcher excepted in verse form. The last act was staged as per menu and consisted of
talks by persons associated with The Davidsonian. Boulware, the assignment editor, consumed the thirty seconds allotted to him in rising,
bowing, and reseating himself. The president of the Reporters Club, Spence, endeavored to tell the new men how to write
articles but seemed to be unable to ramble far from that subject so near to his heart—the Peanut Parcher.

Matthews, speaking as the business manager of the publication, called for the support of the club in matters pertaining to
his department. This was readily promised in view of the fact that he had made the feed possible. The speech
of the editor-in-chief, Askew, closed the oratorical part of the program. He made a talk in which he gave his
listeners a lot of good solid stuff and which, if followed, ought to aid materially in making, as he intimated
was the aim of the staff, The Davidsonian the best college weekly in America.

Receiving the kickoff, they were unable to advance the ball and resorted to punting. V. M. I. then began an
irresistible series of line plunges which, coupled with a forward pass, put the ball on Davidson's 1-yard line. Dickson carried
the ball over for the first touchdown and Leech kicked goal. Black and Johnson went in at this point and
Davidson's prospects looked better. It was not D. C.'s day, however. An attempted pass from Spann to Johnston was pulled
in by Bunting, who raced 40 yards for another touchdown. Leech kicked goal.

In the last quarter, the Wildcats played true to their real form, sweeping their opponents completely off their feet. A
pass to Douglas for 15 yards was followed by another to Johnston for 25. After several line bucks, Spann passed
to Douglas who made a wonderful catch, eluded two Cadets, and dived over for Davidson’s only touchdown. McAlister kicked goal
from a difficult angle. The Red and Black threatened to score once more before the final whistle but lost the
ball on an intercepted forward pass. For V. M. I., Leech and Bunting played the best ball. Mentor and Shipley
also showed up well for the Virginians. Douglas put up a star game for Davidson, both on the offensive and
defensive, while McMaster smeared up everything that started his way. In the backfield, Spann and McAlister played splendid football and
Cassell's punting outdistanced that of his opponents till he was forced to retire with a sprained ankle. Johnston also proved
a spectacular ground gainer after he went in, while Black's line plunging proved an eye-opener to the stands, although he
played with an injured hand.

First Quarter:
