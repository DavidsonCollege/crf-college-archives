Your belly and you

-The story of one

man and his gut-

The current situation here at
Davidson certainly is dishearten-
ing. I can think of about as many
positive things to say about this
place as I can do pull-ups. But if
there is one thing that this school
has a surplus of, it’s fat. You can’t

_ eat anywhere on campus without
gaining weight, increasing your
risk of heart disease, or effectively
blocking all of your arteries.

This, however, is not neces-
sarily a bad thing, for the accumu-
lation of fat leads to many won-
drous occurrences. More impor-
tant than all is the emergence of
belly. Bellycan do many unbeliev-
able things. His presence can and
willimprove your life and the lives
of those around you. Some people,
though, don’t necessarily know
how to use belly to the best of their
ability, so here are some tips to
make your world a better place. As
you will soon see, the benefits of
belly are infinite.

1) Warmth. Unbeknownut to
many,belly provides a more than
adequate supply of heat. When
you are cold, just place your hands
under your shirt and hold on to
your stomach. The rewards are
plenty. Not only does belly keep
your hands warm, he also installs a
great sense of well-being for you
can mock those frigid others who
are not so blessed with such a gut.
Since it’s winter I can’t begin t co)

' express how much this feature

comes in handy. A friend of mine
told me that those who embark on

wilderness trips to the arctic rely
on their bellies for warmth and
comfort. A cold camper places his
hands on belly or ona friend’s. In
a life or death situation,belly could
in fact turn out to be a life saver.

2) Self-Defense. I have never
been in a real fight, but if I was I
would surely win. I shall not hesi-
tate to tell you why. In most manly
fights, guys go for shots at the mid-
section. Folks withbelly are there-
fore gifted.

and watching college football with
my father. At one point of sure
genius, I began tocram the wrinkled
prunes into my belly-button. One
after another, they slowly began to
disappear. My dad thought this
was hilarious, and soon the whole
family was in on the fun. Words
can’t express the horror on their
faces when I flexed what muscles
I had, and twenty-some-odd rai-
sins shot from the depths of belly.

with noeffort on my part; all Ihave
to dois show up withbelly , and the
laughter ensues.

5) Women. For some strange
reason girls have an attraction to
belly. I really don’t know why this
is, but I am not going to complain.

6) Storage. The bigger belly
is, the more your belly can hold.
This means that each day you can
eat progressively more and more.
This allows for the maturity of a

out of your
victim. If you
think I am ly-
ing about this

around you ... as you will soon see,
the benefits of belly are infinite.

Compare and
Contrast. One
of the best
things to do

one, just try
me! Second, belly can be used as
a weapon. [If it’s big enough, it
may be wise to try to fling it at the

.unruly. I have seen many flee at

the site of an attacking belly.

3) The Raisin Game. This
one was my dad’s favorite and
rightfully so. To play this game all
you need are raisins andbelly, But
before I tell you the rules of the
game let me first inform you of its
illustrious history.

Teall started, one Saturday, af-

ternoon after had received a hair- .
cut from my mother. I sat on the’

couch, half-naked, eating raisins

From then on it became a Saturday
afternoon tradition to see how many
raisins I could jam into belly. Try
this one with your friends. Hold a
competition.

4) Humor. All of a sudden I °

have become the center of all co-
medic situations at my fraternity.
Why you may ask? It’s obviously
because of belly. When there is
belly, there is humor. When there
is fat, there is frat. At house meet-
_Aags; alk.jokes seem to somehow
endup with belly. Because of him,
my popularity has boosted enor-

mously. This apparently comes

with belly is
to show him to your friends. They,
in turn, will show you their belly ,
and laughter will inevitably fol-
low.

This also could become acom-
petition—more and more will flock
to flaunt their own belly , thinking
theirs is the best. Iurge you tohold
your own contests. Have a panel
of skinny people judge the bellies
of others. A soft, round belly ob-
viously earns more points than a
coarse, flat belly.

_8) A friend. In times sittin.
ache and depression, there is one

person who you can tell all of your

deepest, darkest secrets—it’ sbelly.
He will never tell anybody,

Also, if you feel the need to
exercise, take belly fora walk. He
doesn’t need a leash and he most
certainly never runs away. Other
people can also make friends with
belly. Doug Cutting seems to have
a strange attraction to mine. I think
he likes belly more than he likes
me.

9) Music. Yeah, The Edge is
a terrible music station, but belly
plays all your favorite hits.
Whether it be rock, jazz, or classi-
cal you enjoy, belly can do it all.
Dan Guill once played an entire
symphony on my belly , much to
the amazement of others in atten-
dance.

You can hit belly with hands,
sticks, bricks, or most anything
else. Play along to the radio or
compose your own tune. When
you have reached this stage, you
are ready to sing along with belly.

10) The Truffle Shuffle. This
is my all-time favorite. Upon re-
quest, put your shirt above your
head and wiggle belly to and fro.
Then convulse, thus producing a -
rippling effect. Your audience will
surely love this one to death.

Once when I was attempting
toimpress others withthe “shuffle,”
some parents stumbled upon the
show. They @id not know me and
promptly asked their son who the

“little ound-boy” .was.> I hid in
“shame, but deep inside belly was
laughing.

Well, I’m done with my trend
of positivity and back to my usual
string of complaints. Actually,
this article is more of a construc-
tive criticism, an observation that

may change the fabric of Davidson °

extracurricular life forever. Basi-
cally, I’ve noticed a trend of do-
nothing-nerdiness expanding here
. on campus. I won’t call it apathy,
just more of a selfish laziness. Stu-
dents here continually use school-
work or studying as an excuse to
avoid participating in anything non-
academic or anything that doesn’t
involve a mouse and keypad.
How many times have you
asked a favor of someone only to
have them refuse, saying “I’ve got
a paper to do, sorry”? Iunderstand
that schoolwork comes first around
here, but Davidson students usu-
ally take things too far. More than
once Ihave been snubbed by people
that have a project due...ina
week. Friends have refused to play
in IMAC games because of an
impending assignment .. . due a
week from tomorrow. Now I real-
ize these infractions in social eti-
quette may occur because no one
likes me, but the lack of motivation
to do anything extracurricular ex-
tends far beyond my lazy friends
(or, at least the people that let me

hang out with them).

Last Saturday we had a club
soccer game right here on the his-
toric Davidson campus. I was a
barn burner against the dynamic
dozen from Central Piedmont
Community College. There was
scoring, fighting, slick moves, con-
troversy, even some fans—but no
ref. Actually, that’s not true. We
did finally find

three more hours of Sega before

Come on people. Stop staring
at the Home Shopping Network all
day waiting for the Star Trek box
set, and do something interesting.

easily, it’s placed more or less in
between the library and the com-
puter center. Or join a club. I’m
not even going to mention how
much help we need at The
Davidsonian. Since it’s almost
December and there’s no yearbook
in sight, I’m sure the crew atQuips
and Cranks could use a helping
hand. Or try the athletic arena.
I’ve had a very

slack and not
finding an official, but [happen to
know he called several people. I
also know that there are dozens of
varsity and former club players

- well qualified to ref the game who

preferred to sit home and pad their
backsides in front of the television.
Of course, they wouldn’t admit
that. No, never, they probably give
the same, jaded excuse of “I’ve got
a project to do” all the while think-
ing to themselves “Ha, ha! Fools!

If you like sports, stop playing
armchair quarterback all day and
jog over to Baker for some exer-
cise. For the socially inclined, we
have aplace called Patterson Court

tions and women’s eating houses

sembled which is saying a lot be-
cause the team I coached last year
was also the finest female
flickerball squad ever assembled.
But much like Pat Riley, I felt I
needed a new challenge, and so I
moved on. Neither team actually
won the championship because of
some technicalities I won’t getinto,
but the season was still fun. This
year’s team admires me so much
that they actually named them-

selves after me (me being the Kool
and them being the Gang). Plus, I
got a free T-shirt both years. You
just can’t get that from surfing the
‘net all day.

Basically, what I’m saying is
“DEVELOP A PERSONALITY.”
There is more to life than differen-
tial equations andCD-ROM. Don’t
hide behind the guise of the over-
worked student, get off your butt
and participate in life. The people
that do participate around here
seem to do everything. It’s sort of
an oligarchy of extracurricular jug-
gernauts. When President
Kuykendall needs advice, who do
you think he calls? Dean Shandley,
Dean Williams? No [ tell you, he
rings up El Jéfe—Davidsonian
god, club soccer extraordinaire,
flickerball guru, legend. Do you
think the leaders of our society
look for guidance on the quiet floor
of E.H. Little. Heck no, they want
people who know the flavor of life,
people who cando more than quote

.from every episode of Dr. Who

ever filmed.

So stop complaining about
homework and start making an
impact. Join ateam, start aclub, do
some service, write an Opinions
article for God sakes. I don’t care
what you do, but do something.
