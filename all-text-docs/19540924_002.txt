Former Student Asks Purpose of College:

To Make a Living or

The following is an article sent to The
Davidsonian by Kurt H. Biedenkopf, a Ger-
man exchange student who attended Dav-
idson some five years ago. Biedenkopf,
who is doing newspaper work in Germany
at this time, writes to consider with us the
problem of what we seek as college men.
Replies to the article from students or
members of the college family will be

“ weleomed.—Ed. .

With Davidson College having reopen-
ed her doors and thus gotten another year
of learning under way this seems as good
a time as any for me as a former student
at Davidson to send greetings to the facul-
ty and the students and let them know
that my thoughts have often returned to
Davidson since I left four years ago to re-
turn to my home in Germany.

I think it will be safe to assume that the
thoughts and considerations which may
occupy you upon your return to college
work will most probably be similar to
those of German students in your position.
Those of you new to college life will find
yourselves confronted with the task of
arriving at some clarification of your mis-
sions, aims, and purposes at this institu-
tion; those coming back for another year
of study will tend to examine your aims
and ideals previously chosen and develop-
ed to come up with an appraisement of
their values and the possible necessity of
revision.

Similar to your German counterparts
you may have devoted your university
work to the completion of two major pur-
poses. One will be to learn a job, that is,
to acquire the scientific tools necessary for
the execution of a scientific profession.
Doing this you are guided by the correct
assumption that a scientific education, re-
fered to as academic education in Ger-
many, offers you a better chance to reach
a social standard of living which, aspired
to more or less by all of us, will guarantee
you a life of relative material security.

Viewed thus college work may be taken
as an economically sound investment,
Work, a number of years of your lives,
and money represent the capitals which
you expect to yield; as interest you expect
to gain better opportunities in life, a high-
er standard of living, and material well-
being. Under such aspects your decision to
study derives from an economic and prac-
tical consideration and your studies repre-
sent the means to arrive at an end of main-
ly economic character.

Since you are, however, more than ap-
prentices of science your studies at David-
son are guided not only by such economic
considerations but will find their motiva-
tions just as much in a desire to study and
do research for the sake of science and
knowledge. You will strive to detect the
inner associations of things, to examine
the intrinsic values of all which is present-
ed to you as science and try to contribute
to the further completion of this scientific
structure of human knowledge.

In studying you will seek for the truth,
may it be by endeavoring to understand
the nature of God in theology or the exis-
tence of the infinity in mathematics, may
it be by searching for the laws of combina-
tion of elements in chemistry or the caus-

es of life in biology. You will ask for the:

causes of events you observe and the
truth for truth’s sake. In doing thus you
continue on a path which exists as long as
humans are directed by the desire for
an answer to the oldest question known to
mankind: Why?

Repeatedly have I heard German and
American friends of mine argue that the
main difference between German and
American students could be found in the
latter’s capacity to motivate their studies
by but the first of the two purposes de-
scribed above and that they would have
no desire to do research and study for the
sake of truth and knowledge alone. I am
sure that I find you in agreement with me

To Seek After Truth

when saying that this is not true. While
having studies at Davidson I learned that
economic and practical considerations
were not the only motives underlying my
American friends’ decision to study and
that they too were inspired by the desire
to search truth for truth’s sake.

Yet we may not let ourselves be tempt-
ed into underestimating the number of
students to whom college work is but an-
other form of specialization and who look
upon their college as an institution at
which one can buy knowledge similar to
buying stock for the expressed purpose of
drawing interest and dividend from it.

We ali know well that life in our pres-
ent day form of society is hardly possible
without some form of specialization or an-

other. Without the special knowledge ac-
quired in his own field the student could
hardly ever become prosperous. Would he
limit his studies to a search for truth for
the sake of this truth he would not have
a chance in life.

But thanks to the insight into the mech-
anism of this human society of ours we
furthermore know, that the ultimate exis-
tence of this society depends on humans
capable of recognizing, analyzing, and pos-
sibly answering problems and questions
of common interest and validity, thus
reaching beyond the limits of their spec-
ialist education; the answers to such ques-
tions and problems being the indispensible
presuppositions to the creation and regen-
eration of aims and ideals without which a
functioning human society cannot exist.

‘A country within whose boundaries lives
and works the world’s best specialist la-
bor, may they be scientists or mechanics,
may well be capable of building the fast-
est airplanes and the most modern televi-
sion equipment, but it will not be in a po-
sition to supply the ideas and ideals which
the world must expect a leading nation to
bring forth. To supply and hence create
such ideas this nation needs men whose
expressed aims are to search for and find
the truth not as a means to some other
end but as an end in itself. Ideas and
ideals are answers to questions, questions
the results of doubts and doubts the con-
sequence of seeking and searching.

The more students of the free world
regard university work merely as an in-
stitution of practical and economic value
and look upon their professors as men
payed to sell knowledge and thus tend to
diminish their capacity to seek and doubt,
ask and answer, the more the free world
will be deprived of one of its main bas-
tions of strength without any efforts what-
soever on part of its enemies.

Though specialist labor in your country
and mine be superior to that behind the
iron curtain, this difference is of a quanti-
tative nature. The qualitative difference
between the free and the communist
world is to be found in the possibility to
question and search which our guaran-
teed freedoms supply us with and which
allows us to ask without fear of the an-
swer. Should we neglect this possibility by
neglecting the second purpose of univer-
sity work described we may find our-
selves at one time or another incapable to
practice the art of searching for truth as
an end in itself. This must not necessarily
lead to a loss of our freedoms; yet once
they are made no use of we may run the
risk of deflating and finally loosing them
without noticing it until it is too late.

I feel that we should try to arrive at a
synthesis of specialist education and gen-
eral learning and seeking for the truth as
an end and not only as a means to an end.
It is no doubt true that without the former
we are unable to defend ourselves mater-
jally without the latter, however, we may
not be in a position to survive intellec-
tually and spiritually. And history of man-
kind has selected and named but those
nations as great which were spiritually
and intellectually superior to others. )

Important Questions

Must Be Considered

By LEIGHTON McCUTCHEN

Where do you think you're
headed! Your life is about one-third
gone. If you see any reason for
living out the rest of it, you surely
see some challenge to meet, some
problem to be dealt with. Many
people have many different kinds
of questions that concern them
most. Shall I drink or not? What
work shall I go into? Can 1 use
people to satisfy my particular de-
sires? Shall I go to the flick, or
get a date?

Here is an attempt to point up
some of those questions that de
mand an answer from most of us
at some time or another. These
below are not optional. They seem
to me to be the kind that we must
seek to answer soon too, for this
is not the day of our fathers when
time was luxuriantly distributed.

In a sense we are of the dead. By
that I mean that the civilization
we have come to consider everlast-
ing is rapidly proving to be quite
flimsy in terms of eternity, or even
history for that matter. It looks
like it might crumble, or so we are
told. This fact doesn’t necessarily
lead to despair, but it does put a
premium on this kind of question-
ing, and the answers we try to find
to our questions.
t—Who em | end where am !
going?

This is a living question be-
cause at least four forces claim
ultimate allegiance of us. In the
name of the “only” truth they try

“to tell us who we are, and they

are obviously not very compatible
with each other.

The Four Forces

a.—The Milltery says that basi-
cally I am a thing. I am to give
unquestioning obedience at any
time to the machine of the army,
because the only way to settle
things is the unhappy but realistic
way of war; that in the end a
strong military is the source of
ultimate strength.

b.--Society says that ‘basically I
am a good average member of
society; that I am potentially a
business success if I learn well
enough the customs and rules of
the game called competitive busi-
ness; that conformity, initiative,
and a certain amount of pride are
the keys to success; that I have a
right to expect a happy life made
enjoyable by a wife and family
and material plenty.

c.—Christienity says that I am

basically a potential son of God:
that I am best a man when I recog-

nize my total subserviance to God, ,

and live humbly for others; that I
am going to be increasingly close
to Him now and after death if I
will lose all—pride, my own ambi-
tion, hostility, love of wealth—and
walk in love.

d.—Communism says I am basi-
cally a part of a mass; that I am
good when I am working for the
mass; that I am really the result

of a sort of cosmic economy that
is self-propelling and quite suf-
ficient unto itself; that I will have
meaning only as 1 work for the
classless society, otherwise I am
worse than nothing.

t1.—Should t help to erase the
“color bar” used to separate peo-
ple?

Why must this be settled in a
hurry? The colored peoples of the
world who are in the overwhelm-
ing majority of the population are
restive (note eg., Kenya, China,
India, Indo-China). They are look-
ing at the proud white and saying,
“What now ‘Top-man’? You can't
play with us anymore. The time
has come for you to make up your
mind. Are we really people, just as
good as you? And don’t talk about
it. We can see plain enough what
you are doing.”

tt.—(To those who claim to be
‘Christians)\—What is the neture
and function of the church?

This is a genuine question at
this time because “fellow” church
members are calling each other
liars and heretics on the basis of
each others answers to just this
question. One side says that the na-
ture of the church is a united
body, and that its purpose in the
world is to first and foremost pour
out through it the love of God in
Christ. Others say that the nature
of the church is primarily doc-
trinal. They claim that its purpose
is to draw all men into agreement
to itself before love can really be
shown them (such as in the exten-
sion of complete fellowship). These
forces are demanding allegiance
now. The time is particularly short
for the answering to this one, for
the world is “closing down” to the
conventional expressions of the
church (e.g. in China, secularism,
ete).

This exhausted

article has

‘neither the important questions

which we must answer, nor the
facts that make such questions of
prime consideration. Perhaps I've
left out the ones that are the most
important to you, but these at
least must have an answer. What
do you have to say about them?
Better yet, what ways will you use
to find out the answers for them?

Letters To
The Editor

Expressions concerning mat-
ters of general interest to the
student body end alumni are al-
ways welcomed by the editors.
Such communications should not
exceed 150 words. All letters
must be signed. Occasionally per-
mission may be granted to with-
hold the suthor’s name. In any
ease the author's identity must
be known to the editor.

The “Gadfly”

Attention Freshmen! Advice
On Frats and Davidson Spirit

Even now freshmen, as you are
remembering that last gala rush
party from which you have just
returned and are excitedly and
nervously discussing together
which fraternities you liked, sleepy-
eyed upper classmen are gathering
wearily around in eleven different
groups in the final night of the
tiring rushing program. They will
be deciding on how well you would
fit into their respective groups;
you should remember that they
are much more exhausted by this
hectic week and further behind in
their work than you are, since they
have had to stay up into the far
hours of each night.

They will attempt to be as fair
as possible, although each one
must be careful to issue only so
many bids and try to get the very
best of you, in their judgment, to
come their way; you have finished
looking them over and have chosen
your favorite so go on to bed and
try to get some sleep.

But sleep is hard coming as you
will find after such an exciting
night, and when drowsiness finally
overcomes you, most of you will
begin to dream. Perhaps it will be
of the summer when those friendly
rush fetters sparkling with praises
of Davidson and their fraternity
began coming—of the people who
are alumni of many fraternities
who all told you they hoped you
would join -theirs——of the final
advice from your folks about which
group they would like you to join
—of the fun of meeting new
friends during orientation and see-
ing which fraternities they liked—
of the memorable rush parties
themselves when everyone had a
smile and glad handshake for you
and seemed, incredibly enough,
concerned about what courses you
were taking (as if they didn’t know
what freshmen have been taking
at Davidson for years)}—of your
excitement when you passed the
first big hurdle and got invited
back the last two nights—of—

To the Post Office

Suddenly your alarm clock set
for 6:30 stuns you into conscious-
ness, and quickly you rush to dress
and join the rest of your class-
mates on the eager dash to the
post office. Perhaps on this mem-
orable walk you will remember Dr.
Cunningham’s words quoted from
the Sanskrit about “. . . looking
to this with its joy of action,
splendor of beauty, and bliss of
growth...”

Yes, this day will be “. . . the
salutation of the Dawn so that
yesterday will become a dream of
happiness and tomorrow a vision of
hope, if you live well today .. .”
Finally you reach the post office;
nervously your fingers tremble as
you open the box and. your heart
skips a beat as you see what is or
is not inside it... -

What your box will contain, .anx-

By GILBERT GRAGG

jous freshman, no one under the
sun can predict. If you are among
a highly favored percentage of
your class with athletic ability, a
striking personality, and good looks
you will probably have your pick
of any fraternity with each hoping
fervently that you will come their
way. Congratulations are in order
for you, and here is hoping you'll
make a wise choice.

Then about half of you will get
three or four bids, although many
in this group won't get the bid of
your first choice. You are good sta-
bie guys with nothing to be held
against you on first appraisal and
will make good solid members. A
smaller percentage of you will just
get one or two bids and will prob-
ably join, even though the frater-
nity is far from your favorite.

The remaining percentage of the
class, if it is the same as ones in
the past, will be divided among a
very ‘minute percentage of boys
who get bids but do not accept,
because they feel that there is a
different way to achieve brother-
hood, and a larger percentage who
do not get any bids at all and are
very disappointed because their
box is empty.

For all of you it will be a mem-
orable day — there will be all
kinds of emotions experienced.
Those of you who get the bids you
wanted will be very happy and
will find in your fraternity a won-
derful fellowship of boys who will
become your brothers in a_ real
sense; they will help you in your
studies, introduce you to the cutest
girls at Queens, and let you double-
date with them etc ... For every
hard task they require, such as
menial pledge duties, you will find
all the inconveniences have been
richly worth it when you receive
your treasured pin and are initiat-
ed at last.

Then you who do not get the bid
you wanted but do get another
one and go ahead in that fraterni-
ty, you. will probably be surprised
to find after a little while how
congenial you are with that group
and wouldn't trade the fraternity
you joined for anything, as your
bonds in friendship with its mem-
bers grow — just remember that
there would be some in any group
that you wouldn’t like but the ma-
jority of you would.

One Black Bail Amidst A
Galaxy of White

As for you who get no bids, you
will feel left out. Probably you'll
remember being told glibly dur-
ing orientation “that if you get a
bid don't let it go to your head and
if you don’t, don’t let it go to your
heart” and realize how impossible
it is to do the latter when your

folks and friends who wrote gush-
ing letters of recommendations,
describing you as little gods, will
be anxious to know what you join.
ed and be waiting even then for
your call “

Undoubtedly some of you feel
bitter at first as you remember
how friendly everyone was to you
and decide that they are a bunch
of unChristian snobs and hypo-
crites; just remember, disappoint.
ed freshman, that it only takes one
blackball amidst a galaxy of white
to keep you out and that many
members of most of the fraterni-
ties are almost as disappointed as
you that you didn’t get in and
might have argued themselves blue
in the face, but to no avail.

Perhaps you will start Criticizing
fraternities when you see other
boys taken because of family con-
nections, forgetting that even
sometimes legacies are refused.
Probably you will be critical of the
whole system for its exclusiveness
and for claiming brotherhood when
its very nature of selection denies
the principle of brotherhood, for-
getting that thousands (Negroes,
Jews) are discriminated against
much more seriously than any of
you will ever be and that had you
gotten the right bid you would
have joined and not been critical.

Just remember you will have an
opportunity to participate in in-
tramural sports and other school
activities and to show your abili-
ties, along many lines; you will
find many wonderful unexpected
friendships among independents as
well as having close friends in dif-
ferent fraternities. No doubt you
will again think of Dr. Cunning-
ham’s words about the challenge
and thrill of a new year when you
will have unexpected sorrows and
disappointments, but remember
there are always many unexpected
joys also!

New Horizons

All of you freshmen, whether
you join a fraternity or not, will
find that the essential and most
cherished principle at Davidson is
that you will ultimately be accept-
ed for your own character and per-
sonality and have a fruitful college
career because of what you really
are regardless of whether you are
in a fraternity, independent, have
a ear, work your way through
school, ete. . .

Indeed, the spirit of Davidson has
and always will transcend these
barriers — and remember, fresh-
men, that it isn’t what happens to
you in life that is important but
what you make of it. So those of
you who don't get a bid, or the
right one, in the morning, keep
this in mind, and for you it will
truly be the “Salutation of a new.
Dawn.”

“Upper Classman” Outlines Four
Types Of Nauseating Freshmen

By HIRAM CATON

Neophites, plebs, peons, peas-
ants, Call them what you wish, for
they are here. Every year, these ne-
farious and stupid creatures des-
cend upon us, and tragically most
of them last throughout the entire-
ty of the two terms. They distract
us gentlemen from our proper du-
ties, and they cause us a multitu-
dinous amount of trouble.

For instance, just the other day
on my way to philosophy 41, one
of them approached me and asked
the location of the Chambers
Building. And those abominable lit-
tle red hats. Why they wear the
atrocious things with pride, as
though they were a crown or halo
or something comparable! The en-
tire matter is unintelligible to me.
I can’t imagine how they got out of
high school. Which brings me to my
point. Although I'd like to, I can’t
ignore the nymphs. Between ex-
plaining this and warning that, }
have detected some very definite
types of College Freshmen.

The High School Honor Boy. This
type is not content to be a lowly,
diabolic freshman. He insists on be-
coming a sub-freshman by his pro-
fuse and haughty references to his
glorious high school career. He
revels in the thought of it, and in
anticipation of a similarily glitter-
ing college career. He proudly dis-
plays his medals, pens, awards, and
so forth in a conspicuous place on
his lapel, or shirt, or T-shirt, or,
I assume, even on his pajamas.

But however obnoxious he may
be, there is one concession: he is
harmless. His glory and place of
honor are no more (except at home
where mama is), and he soon fades

into obscurity.

The Lover. Although this group
is not unique to College Fresh-
men, its place among them is more
pronounced, This may be account-
ed for by realizing that The Lover
is in a new locale, with new oppor-
tunities, new challenges, and, new
addresses.

And, aside from all this, he is
now dealing with a new species:
the college girl. He is intoxicated
by the thought of his conquests-to-
come. Then, we must realize, that
he must establish his position
among the mob as an Extra-Special,
A-1 Lover Boy. This particular
challenge spurs him on with re-
newed vigor. This type is annoy-
ing not only because of his brag-
ging, but because I myself am his
potential competitor, and I don't
relish such thoughts.

The Sceptic. This group is by far
the most dangerous. They are cyn-
ical, serious, and armed with de-
vastating arguments. They conjure
up profound theories that prove we
souls have been believing in some-
thing wholly false all the while.
They are bitter because the world
does not recognize their astound-
ing genious and their scientific, ir-
rifutable philosophy. When they go
to church, they mock the speaker,
catch mistakes in his grammar, and
generally ridicule him for being ig-
norant. .

They are always ready for an ar-
gument. Any argument. They have
facts and theories that will prove
their argument on anything from
the beginning of the universe to
the pronunciation of ghrapthirisew-
