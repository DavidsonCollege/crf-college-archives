Luckless Freshmen Initiated
the Literary Societies

Various Forms of Torture Inflicted on Fifty-eight Aspiring Future

Eumenean Society..

Since the days when initiations R. 0. T. C.

into the societies were always fla-
vored with the odor of tomatoes and
antiquated eggs, no such lively inia-
tion has been held to surpass last
Saturday night’s performance in the
Eu. Society.

About 35 Freshmen formed a line
in front of the society hall and at a
given signal, filed into the seats pre-

ared for them. No time was lost
in beginning the program.

“Curley Locks” Walthall and
“Bristley” Kretchener were called
on to render the well known duet—
“How Green I Am.” The old soci-
ety men were never able to find the
solution to this question, but the
supposition is that the Freshmen,
whose very existence is so closely
interwoven with the verdant, un-
derstood and felt the force of this
touching song.

“General Alarm” LeLorme and
“Blushing” Long were the next to
take the floor. Their rendition of
“Home, Sweet Home” was attended
with great success, however, musi-
cal critics at large believe that the
eflect would have been better if the
singers had memorized the words.

The Davidson and Japan Aero.
Service, Limited, next gave three
exhibition flights with Fresh Min-
ter, Rhames, and .Carr, W. S., as
passengers, With the exception of
a little engine trouble, the feat was
most successful. Rhames won the
altitude record with ease.

The event which attracted the
most attention was a boxing match
between “Packey” McFarlane and a

better if we give them some vase-
line.

knowledge along journalistic chan-
nels. Each week the fraternity holds
a discussion meeting, in which the

Dr. Martin Gives Simple Rules for
Choosing Life’s Work

Men who did not attend the Y
service Sunday evening missed a
treat in the form of a timely lecture
by Dr. Martin on that all-important
question for the young man, “What
shall my life work be?”

In his introductory remarks Dr.
Martin stressed the fact that we do
not pass this way but once, and that
when our time of active life is gone
our great opportunity for unselfish
service to humanity is forever be-
hind us. Accordingly, we should
make use of every opportunity that
comes our way, and should give God
the refusal of our lives.

Four or five important steps
should be followed in the process of
choosing one’s vocation, the first
and probably the most important of
which is to give the heart unreserv-
edly to God. Unless we are in the
right relationship with God, and un-
less we choose our life work in con-
sultation with Him, we assume a
tremendous responsibility in making
the choice alone.

In the second place, the entire
self should be dedicated to God and
His service, whether it be as a bank-

With the game with N. C. State
less than a week in the future the
Tech men are going through a hard
workout in preparation for the
Wildcat team. Coach Fetzer has a
squad of 50 men to pick from and
with 10 of last year’s Varsity back
on the job he is not having such a
hard time deciding who will be his
first string men.

Captain Weathers and Ripple are
slated for the positions at tackle.
These two men will be remembered
as a pair of the hardest men to go
over or get around that have ever
worn the Red and White. This is
the fourth year at Tech for both of
them and from all reports they are
in prime condition and going better
than ever. Ripple weighs 200 pounds
while Weathers is 15 pounds heavier.

Kirkpatrick is holding down one
of the flanks in the same good style
that he showed last year, but Coach
Fetzer has a problem on his hands
as to whom the other end will be.
It is still possible that Homewood
will return and thus take care of
this berth, but in case he does not
teturn it is possible that Lawrence
will fill his shoes. Lawrence is a
big fellow, six feet four inches tall,
with a good deal of experience in
handling the outside position.

Floyd is one of the best men in
the center of the line that State has
produced in the last few years. He
performed brilliantly in the V. M. I.
game last year and great things are
predicted for him this year.

Coach Bill has to pick a new snap-
per back, as the big center gradu-
ated last year. This position seems
