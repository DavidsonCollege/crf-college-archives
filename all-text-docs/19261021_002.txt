Wildcats continued to keep their slate
clean in the 1926°drive for the state!
championship. Five victories over med- |
iocre teams have been chalked up and
with the Wake Forest clash the Cats will |

start on a round of the five hardest |

games ever alloted to a Davidson team in|’

as many weeks.

The clash with the Deacons looms
largest at the present time. As far
as we can make it out the result will
depend largely upon the weather con-
ditions. The boys.ffom Wake For-
est have built their offensive around
aerial attacks with Riley and Rackley
as the high lights. A wet day will
greatly diminish or totally destroy
its effectiveness. Good Passing de-
pends upon speed and very few men
c#h develop any _ extraofdinary
amount of speed with soggy real
estate clinging to’ their cleats. In
such a case Davidson should win by
a small margin. If Jupe Pluvius re-
strains himself, however, there will

be high times down on’ Wearn Field
Saturday. ny

these parts. The V. M. I. cadets will at-
tend en masse. The Young Men’s Bus-
iness Club is sponsoring the clash and
from advance indications, they will fill
the new, Municipal Stadium to overflow-
ing. Railroad rates to the Hill City have
been reduced in order to encourage a
larger attendance from this vicinity. Da-
vidson should have a good delegation
there to help the boys win that game.

As the major Big Five games approach
there is much talk as to who will win
the state title. Our friends in Charlotte!
have rather prematurely picked the Dea- |
cons to come out on top and are sticking |
to their conclusion. As far as the writer |
can Wake Forest is on the slide,

coming to the front.

Saturday. Carolina, however, looms
ahead.
Davidson has about the same

chance of winning from Carolina as
she did last year. If the quarter-
backs can keep their heads clear and
a few breaks come our way, the
Cats will come out on top in that con- |
test, but otherwise the chances are
little better than they were during the |
previous season. If Davidson drops
that battle Carolina will take the |
title again, and leave Davidson, Duke |
and Wake Forest to fight it out |
among themselves for the next
three places. State can hope for
nothing better than the cellar posi-
tion,

In Hampton, Coach Monk Mattox has |
uncovered an end of rare promise. |
Whenever you see an end get boxed in, |
and then turn and catch the man who |
has circled him before he has gone ten |
yards, you may know that he is a flank-|
man of unusual ability. Hampton did |
that just twice in the Furman tilt Satur- |
