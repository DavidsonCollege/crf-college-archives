THE DAVIDSONIAN

As soon as I walked out of
Belk dorm on my way to class the
other day, [knew something wasn’t
quite right. There on the lawn
surrounding Chambers were doz-
ens of what appeared to be piles of
snow, and it was eighty degrees!
As I walked a little further I be-
came aware that I wasn’t seeing
piles of snow at all, but I was no
less perplexed. I seemed to be
headed straight into a herd of al-
bino elephant seals. [kept on walk-
ing, though, and I was very re-
lieved to discover that I was just
seeing students engaging in that

age old springtime college tradi- -

tion of sunning, studying, and frol-
icking about the campus quad on
one of the first days of nice weather.

Ihave never really understood
why students do this. I, too, am as
white as rice and carry around an
extra layer of winter fat at the be-
ginning of spring. And while you

OPINIONS...

College is sooo college

might find me sweatin’ to the old-
ies in my room in front of my
florescent desk lamp, you can for
sure bet that you won’t catch me
laying around on the grass for all to
see. It just doesn’t make any sense
to me. After all, nobody in high
school studied out in their yard. I
have thought long and hard about
this matter, and the only solution I
could think of is that they think this
is how they are supposed to behave
in college. You really can’t pick
up a college brochure that doesn’t
have students throwing frisbees and
socializing out on some lawn.
However, this isn’t the only

bizarre thing that is practiced by no
one but college students. I have
forever wondered why so many
people here were Teva shoes, and
I use the term “shoe”: lightly.
Whenever I ask one of my friends
how he can go to class wearing
something that basically amounts
to a high-top flip-flop, I usually
hear something like, “‘dude, there
just so comfortable and hassle-
free.” I’m sure a loin cloth is also
comfortable and hassle-free, but
you won’t catch me wearing one
for obvious reasons (and some not
so obvious ones).

Another thing that baffles me

is how many cars here have some
type of rack on top of them. There
are racks that hold everything from
bikes and surfboards to kayaks
and water bongs. Why, just today
I spotted a few cars with ski racks

_on them. Now, I’ll have to check

my calendar, but I could have
sworn it was April.

There is a certain group of
college students that are more
collegish than most. They are the
people who refer to concerts as
“shows.” Asin “man, I was inrare
form at the Dead show last night,”
or “that Widespread show was
sooooo kind.” These people can

easily be spotted because they all
have stickers of their favorite bands
on their cars. Believe it or not, I
have even seen acouple of cars that
have both stickers and racks. As
for these people, I believe they
should just go ahead and get their.
diplomas because it would be im-
possible for them to become any
more collegiate.

I have been worrying that I
have lagged behind my fellow col- .
lege students in accepting these new
ways of life. Sure, I have a couple
of shirts that contain the words
“Coed Naked” followed by some
sport, but that isn’t enough. So I
have strapped on some Tevas and
tied a canoe to the roof of my car.
As soon as I cover my car with so
many stickers that you can’ ttell the
make or model, I’m heading out
west to follow Phish. Maybe I’ll
wear a loin cloth so I can get that
all-over tan. See you in Boulder.

choices, as each person could de-
cide whether or not to become a
“member.” But is this separatist
- attitude something we wish to es-
pouse? Is it best for Davidson?
A program that participants
must choose to buy into cannot
guarantee financial stability. How-
ever, a program thateveryone buys
into ensures that the budget will be

met, eliminating the realistic pros-

pect of forcing some groups to pay
higher fees to make up the differ-
ence.
might purchase membership. So
could 100.
And who pays extra when the
program grows insolvent? If the
_ Administration lacks the money to
pay for this policy now, then don’t
be surprised when some students
inherit a greater financial burden
later. Without surveying the stu-
dent population, one cannot possi-

bly discern the degree of support

for the current plan. A smaller
price for a larger population will
be more attractive to both school
and students.

Total membership in the six
on-campus fraternities and three
women’s eating houses (including

Sure, 200 Independents .

participating freshmen) equals
roughly 900 people this semester.
Independents, BSC, and FIJI make
up the remaining 600 students.
Considering that about 70% of this
year’s freshmen joined a house,
total Court membership, equaled
about 600 people during first se-
mester. Therefore, there were ap-
proximately 475 Independents,
BSC members, and FIJI members
last semester. (These totals are
cautiously low so as to better sus-
tain a balanced budget).

The current policy revision
asks the nine on-campus houses to
pay $500 each, but this fee is sim-
ply transferred from a different
charge; hence, this is not an addi-
tional payment. Our proposal calls
for the same. Our plan goes one
step further by reducing individu-
als’ fees across the board. We
request that Court members pay
$4.50 per semester, while all other
students will pay $10 per semester
in order to secure Court access.
The following figures indicate a
$1,300 first semester deficit bal-
anced by a$1,300 second semester
surplus:

Fall Semester—>(9 X $500) +

(600 X $4.50) + (475 X $10) =

$20,700

Spring Semester—>(9 X $500)
+ (900 X $4.50) + (600 X $10) =
$23,300

Rather than ask people to sign

onor stay away, we should take the
approach of calling everyone a
“member” from the start. A few
dollars would be tacked on to
everyone’s tuition bill, and a li-
ability form could be filled out
later as amere formality. NOONE
IS FORCED TO PAY INTO OUR
PLAN. Essentially, you can get
your money back if you do not sign
the liability form. But one can
gather that our rates are lower and
more equitable than those previ-
ously offered.

We believe that our proposal
will make Patterson Court more
enjoyable, more affordable, and
more inclusive. Itstresses ourneed
to not only welcome all Davidson
students into the fold, but encour-
age them as well. We hope that its
potential benefits and shortcom-
ings will be studied so that we may
all grow more focused in our task
at hand.

The
Dave Zimmerman
guide to street wine

Recently, an article explain-
ing the complexities of malt-li-
quor came to my attention. A
friend of mine, the recently gradu-
ated Dave Zimmerman, asked me
to help him compile a list of wor-
thy street wines as a service to the
Davidson community. Since no

street wine tastes anything like —

wine, here is a list of some of the
better known street wines to help

you choose what to drink with
dinner tonight.

Nightrain: Just as George Wash-
ington was the father of our coun-
try, Nightrain is the father of street
wines. Smooth, drinkable, and
potent, it has been the drink of
choice for winos for over 50 years.
Guns ‘N’ Roses wrote a song ex-
tolling its virtues (chorus: I’m
ready to crash and burn, I never
learn) so it must be good. Great
for sitting around and passing out
with the boys.

Wild Irish Rose: I have never
been to Ireland, but I bet even the
Irish know better than to drink this
stuff. Tastes like a mix between
Cherry Kool-Aid and battery acid,
which is what it was used for in
World War II. It does have a nice
aftertaste, until you throw up.
Makes for a pleasant evening over
the toilet.

White Rocket: The absolute
worst. Even Slash doesn’t drink
this nectar o’ the street. If you are
unfortunate enough to ingest White
Rocket, do not smoke for 72 hours,
as the main ingredient is gasoline.
The very sight has been known to
cause projectile vomiting and pro-
longed comas. If this is all youcan
afford, the College will give youa
grant.

Thunderbird: A pretender to
Nightrain throne. Deceptively le-
thal, Thunderbird is the leading
cause of spontaneous hobo. com-
bustion. Often used as a herbi-
cide, itis the only one of the wines
that tastes anything remotely like
wine, but as the nausea sets in you
wonder why they bother. It comes

in one and two liter jugs, which at
five dollars a pop is a cheap way to
commit suicide.
Mad Dog 20/20: The choice of a
new generation. Doesn’t even pre-
tend to be wine. With flavors like
“Kiwi-Lemon” and “Guava-Mung
Berry,” the fruit juice masks the
taste of the rubbing alcohol, mak-
ing it very dangerous. Derives its
name from the fact that right before
you pass out in the yard, you foam
at the mouth. Has a nice flask
shaped bottle, convenient for chug-
ging, or other alcoholic related ac-
tivities.
Fuki Plum, Rice: The name says
it all. The Japanese make a good
car, but they sure can’t make street
wine. Fuki was originally amethod
of honorable suicide. One sip of
Fuki Saki explains why hari-cari
became so popular. Not particu-
larly potent, but the taste of fer-
mented rice will get you every time.
No red-blooded American bum
would be caught dead on a park
bench with this stuff.
Cisco and Boone’s Farm: A waste
of three dollars. These two only
have 10% and 8% alcohol, as op-
posed to the 22% for White Rocket.
They were marketed mainly for
rich prep-school girls rebelling
against their parents. Boone’s Farm
and Cisco are not a total loss, how-
ever, as both go well on Wheaties,
making them an important part of
this balanced breakfast.
A note on Moonshine: Never,
under any circumstances, drink
Moonshine or anything else served
to you in a Mason jar. People who
drink Moonshine think Deliverance
is a love story and that it’s normal
to go blind at 20. Personally, I
would rather eat a paint chip salad.

Here endeth the lesson. Any
further questions can be answered ©
by Igor, who hangs out in the ditch
behind Dover’ s. Bon appetit, and
remember:

Hard before beer, you’ re in the
clear; beer before hard, you’re in
the yard.
