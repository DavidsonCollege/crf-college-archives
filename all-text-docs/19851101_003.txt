Reagan is scheduled to be interviewed by
members of the Soviet print media on
Thursday.

South Africa — In an effort to quell
violence in the Cape Town area, police
began enforcing  state-of-emergency
powers; 102 anti-apartheid groups have
been banned from meeting and all chil-
dren have been ordered to be either at
school or at home during school hours.

Twenty-three white and four black
women were arrested for protesting the
presence of the army in the black
township of Soweto. A prominent Zulu
official was murdered by blacks as a con-
sequence of continued intra-black politi-

—a weekly

cal conflict.

The Rev. Beyers Naude asked U.S.
banks to make all future loans to South
Africa contingent upon Pretoria’s lessen-
ing of punitive actions against apartheid
opponents. In an endorsement of an anti-
apartheid ad run in a South African news-
paper by 91 South African businessmen
on September 29, 52 U.S. businessmen
ran a Similar ad reading “Today, we add
our voice to theirs.”

In Mideast news, the U.S. announced
that it will make arms sales to Jordan con-
tingent upon Jordan’s agreement to begin
peace talks with Israel; Jordan accused
the U.S. of blackmail.

Jordan’s King Hussein and PLO
leader Yasir Arafat met in Jordan to dis-
cuss their strained relationship; Arafat
said that he will accept “nothing less”
than a direct role in any Mideast peace
talks.

Meanwhile, the Israeli Parliament
voted 68-10 in support of Prime Minister
Peres’ peace overture to Jordan made last
week in a speech before the U.N. In
Lebanon three of the four Soviet Em-
bassy officials kidnapped over a month
ago were freed by their captors; the kid-
nappers killed one of the Soviets three
days after the kidnapping.

Elsewhere in the world — In El Sal-
vador, after a complex prisoner exchange
between the government and leftist re-
bels, the daughter of President Duarte
was released after 44 days of captivity.

As a result of last week’s U.N. cele-
bration, U.S. special envoy Shlauderman
and Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Tun-
nerman met in Washington to discuss the
tension between the two countries; no
progress was reported. Honduras inter-

cepted 14 tons of non-lethal U.S. aid
bound for rebels fighting Sandanistas in
Nicaragua.

In Argentina, a limited 60-day state
of siege was proclaimed by President
Raul Alfonsin in an effort to stop a wave
of threats coming from right-wing ter-
rorists. Indian Prime Minister Gandhi
and Pakistani President Zia agreed to
begin talks to reduce the tension between
their hostile countries.

Gandhi met with Soviet leader Gor-
bachev in Moscow to discuss the Krem-
lin’s arms proposal. China denied a U.S.
allegation that it violated a July U.S.-
China non-proliferation agreement and
said that its nuclear deals with Pakistan
were for “peaceful purposes only.”

France conducted a nuclear test in the
South Pacific. Secretary of State Shultz
and Canadian Foreign Secretary Clark
met in Alberta and agreed to begin free-
trade talks early next year. Fifty-eight
major international commercial banks
gave their endorsement, but not their full
commitment, to a U.S. plan to help end
the international debt crisis by increasing
loans to Third World debtor nations.

Yelena Bonner, the wife of Soviet
dissident Andrai Sakarov, will be al-
lowed to leave the U.S.S.R. to seek med-
ical treat’ ment. Finally, nine impre-
ssionist paintings, valued at 12.5 billion
dollars, were stolen from a_ Paris
museum; among the stolen works was
“Impression Sunrise,” the painting by
Claude Monet that inspired the name of
the movement.

Domestically — On the eve of his
trial John Walker pleaded guilty to spy-
ing for the Soviet Union and will receive
a life sentence; his son will receive a 25-

Summit preparations made; Afncan violence continues

year sentence for his involvement in the
family spying.

The United Auto Workers and
Chrysler Corp. ratified a new labor con-
tract thereby ending the 12-day strike by
70,000 Chrysler employees. After living
eleven days on the new Penn. State artifi-
cial heart, Anthony Mandia got a human
heart on Monday.

Carrying an international crew of five
Americans, two West Germans and a
Dutchman, the space shuttle Challenger
left on Wednesday for a 7-day research
mission. Meanwhile, NASA is looking
for a journalist to ride aboard a shuttle
mission at the end of 1986; they want
someone who can communicate to the
world the awesome beauty of the experi-
ence.

In animal news — Scientists in
California now believe that the erratic be-
havior of Humphrey, the 40 ton whale
who has been “lost” in the Sacramento
River for the past three weeks, may be
due to the fact that he, is a she, who ts
pregnant.

Officials at the Washington Zoo re-
port that Ling Ling, the giant panda given
to the U.S. by China, may also be expect-
ing.

Finally, after a tremendous com-
eback, the Kansas City Royals won an
11-0 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals
to win the World Series, four games to
three.

Thought for the week — “No color,
no religion, no nationality should come
between us — we are all children of
God.”

User Services Building offers better computer facilities

area of data handling,” Casey

Recently, the Computer Ser-
vices Center opened a new facility
on Main Street as part of its con-
tinuing effort to increase com-
puter availability to students, fac-
ulty and staff.

‘Most people on campus have
a reason to use computers ,” Com-
puter Services Director John
Casey said. He said the new User
Services Building should do a
great deal to help people realize
how much a computer could help
them.

The User Services Building
contains ten new terminals for use

puter system, a new draft-quality
printer, and a new THESIS print-
er. The facility also supports
microcomputer users with a
number of personal computer sta-
tions and a software library.

“We designed the building
with users, particularly new users,
in mind, and we want them to
come take advantage of it,”’ Casey
said.

The new center has many fea-
tures designed to accomodate

computer instruction: there is a
conference room with a large

large board that classes can use for
instruction, and free informa-
tional literature on shelves in each
room.

It’s also very easy for a new
user to get acquainted with the
systems. “Our students do primar-
ily text processing,” Casey
pointed out, “so we have a number
of new approaches to people.
Somebody will sit down with you
for fifteen to twenty minutes to get
you started using the system, and
then you’re on your own — unless
you have a problem. You're not
on the spot, and you're not under

He also pointed out that stu-
dent assistants are almost always
on duty to help those who are hav-
ing difficulties.

There are now close to 45 ter-
minals available for the use of stu-
dents on campus, and more than a
hundred students and professors
have purchased personal com-
puters as part of the campus-wide
microcomputer project. Casey
said the Computer Services Cen-
ter is offering a full schedule of
workshops this year.

New personnel with Com-
puter Services include assistant
director for academic computing
John Savarese and departmental
assitant for the Self-Study Beth
Covington. In addition, — staff
member John Robbins has taken a
position as a full-time academic
programmer, writing and translat-
ing programs for use in the David-
son curriculum.

The Center also acquired new
equipment over the summer, in-
cluding extra memory and disk
space for the academic PRIME
and additional communication
lines. Many people with their own
microcomputers, such as Apple
IIs or Macintoshes, are now able
to use the PRIME in their rooms
by phoning in and computing over
the phone lines.

“We've only scratched the
surface of what we could do in the

said. “How do you draw a conclu-
sion from a big mess of data? That
sort of thing could be very impor-
tant to the liberal arts,” he added.
Unlike some __ institutions
which emphasize central comput-
ing over individual computing,
Davidson will continue to offer
students an equal opportunity to
use both sorts of machines, Casey
said. Since microcomputers are so
much better at word processing.
the most important academic use
of computers at Davidson, it
would be best to emphasize the
use of microcomputers as well as
central computing. Casey pointed
out that any machine as large as
the PRIME with many people
using it will be too slow too often
~ people will type without seeing
anything appear in the screen, and
then the cursor will suddenly jump
forward. With microcomputers,
this sort of quirk 1s not a problem
The PRIME, however, is still
used for paper-writing by many
students who have already learned
how to use it, and it will continue
to serve that purpose for some

_time to come. Ultimately, how-

ever, Casey sees its role as that of
a workhorse for programming,
analysis of data, administration,
library organization, and or-
ganized drill (such as the French
language drill programs that some
classes are already using).
