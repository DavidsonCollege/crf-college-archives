SATURDAY NIGHT

The above 12 inches could have been filled with just
about anything; however, this is Thursday night at about
1:00 and I cannot find anything to say
communicative.

But I will be in Durham Saturday and I will be proud
to be there. And if any of our readers are interested in
reading about accomplishments, please note the following.

FAME AND HORATIO ALGER ...

On February 6, Coach Charlie Parker—a Davidson
institution after his 26 years with Wildcat athletics—was
named to the Helms Hall Amateur Wrestling Hall of
Fame. The roster of the organization includes a total of
81 distinguished wrestlers, coaches, and contributors to

the sport.

In receiving the award, Parker adds to an impressive
list of credentials which he has accumulated over his
career. He is past chairman of the N.C.A.A. Rules Com-
mittee; is in his fourth year as editor of the N.C.A.A.
Wrestling Guide; was Coach of the 1963 U.S. Olympic
and National A.A.U. Wrestling Committees; and is a
certified international referee and judge.

Looking back over a long and successful career,
Coach Parker ranked his selection by the Helms Founda-
tion along with being named coach of the U.S. Pan-
American team last year as “my biggest thrills in sports.’

“Wrestling consists of 60 per cent desire and 40 per
cent conditioning,” said Parker,““But new techniques are
important too. I couldn’t even make the team now if I
wrestled like I did in college.”

Parker joins a select group of 32 coaches who have
been enn the Hall of Fame. From his own viewpoint
he had jokingly estimated it would take “50 years at
least” to receive the honor.

It has been over a quarter of a century since Coach
Parker came to Davidson, but his formula for winning

“Selvy Night’ in Greenville. 70-55.

’Cats Drop Second,
Prep For Blue Devils

BY JOHNNY CLARK

Furman’s Purple Paladins, playing before 6,000 frenzied home court fans last night, caught the Wildcats
of Davidson looking ahead to Saturday night's encounter with Duke and mauled the fourth-ranked ‘Cats 70-55,
combining a spirited effort with probably the worst Davidson effort in two years for what Paladin coach Lyles Alley
termed “one of our greatest victories of all time.” : : :

Thus tomorrow night's en-
counter in with the fifth rank-
ed Blue Devils of Duke, al-
though it will still provide a
duel between two nationally
ranked teams and two All-
Americans in Fred Hetzel and
Jeff Mullins, is now tainted
with a somewhat anti-climatic
nature after Furman’s surpris-
ing victory. The contest, for-
merly billed as a battle be
tween North Carolina's basket-
ball titans, will be played at
8:30 before a full house in
Duke Indoor Stadium, a com
mercial TV audience in the
Raleigh and Greensboro areas,
and closed circuit TV audience
in Davidson.

ECONOMICS CAN BE CHUCKLES

Many of you have been avoiding economies because it is so
widely known as “the dismal science.” Oh, good friends, stop
cheating yourselves of many a laugh and cheer, because eco-
nomics is a positive viol! True, it 1s called the dismal science,
but that is only because it was invented in 1681 by Walter C.
Dismal,

It is easy to understand why Mr: Dismal’s discovery of
economics is today almost forgotten, for the fact is that he
himself only stayed with the subject for two or three days.
After that he took up embonpoint, which means fatness. It is
said that at his apogee, Mr. Dismal reached 1200 pounds. This
later became known as Guy Fawkes Day.

It was not until 1776 when Adam Smith published his Wealth
of Nations (or Ozymandias, as it is usually known as) that the
world came to realize what a rosy, twinkly, fun subject eco-
nomies is, As Mr. Smith showed in his jocular little treatise,
there is nothing complicated about economics.

at AS &
‘his later became Kuowa ds the [ouisida Purciicse

When there is a great demand for a product, a ‘great supply
is placed on the market. When there is a small demand, there
is a small supply. Take, for example, castanets You walk into
any average American town today and Pll wager you won
inore thati eighty or ninety castanet shops. That is bec
demand is small.

For Marlboro Cigarettes, on the other hand, the demand is
great. Thus, you will find Marlboros—with all their yun
rich tobacco flavor and pure white Selectrate filter and pli
soft pack and unpliible Flip-Top box—at any counter wher
cigarettes are sold in every one of our fifty great States ind
Duluth.

To Adam Smith, I say, belongs the distinction of popularizing
economies. Mr, Smith was followed by David Ricardo. In fact,
everywhere he went he was followed by David Ricardo Mr.
Smith finally got so annoyed that he summoned a bobby, as
British policemen are called, and had Mr, Ricardo arrested,
This later became known as the Louisiana Purchase

Upon his release from gaol, as a British jail is called, Mr.
Ricardo reported to his parole officer, Thomas Robert Malthus.
They soon became fast friends, and one night over a game of
whist they invented the stock exchange, or chutney, as it is
called in England.

Well sir, with the British having, you might say, a corner on
economics, the French decided that they wanted some eco-
nomics too. Being, however, a proud nation, they refused
simply to borrow British economics, but insisted on inventing
their own. At first they tried using the truffle hound as a medium
of exchange. When this proved less than satisfactory, they
switched to pomade. Discouraged by this second disappoint-
ment, they finally shrugged and said, “Oh, who cares about
economics anyhow?” and returned to the guillotine and Maurice
Chevalier.

America, I am pleased to report, had much better success with
economics. Our early merchants quickly broke down economics
into its two major categories—coins and folding money—and
today, as a result of their wisdom, we can all enjoy the automatic
toll station,

Well sir, I could go on and on about this fascinating subject,
but I know you're all in a tearing hurry to rush out and sign
up for Econ I, So I will leave you now with (+o kindly words
of farewell; Gresham’s I aw. @ ives Nav Shulman

We, the makers of Marlboro Cigarettes, are tobacconisis, ©
rol economists. But this much we know about supsily and
demand: you demand full favor in a filter sigcretic; we
supply it-—-Marlbora!l
