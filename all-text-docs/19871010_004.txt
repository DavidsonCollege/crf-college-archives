Homecoming:
The primer

By GLENN FOGLE
and ASH AHSANUDDIN
Well, it’s another wonderful
weekend for being bored at
Davidson except this weekend is
special--it’s Homecoming!
If you are a freshmint you will not
have experienced this time for rev-
elry and general fun. You
freshmints who are fortunate
enough to have dates to the Home-
coming dance should be looking
forward to discovering why most
of the upper classmen decide to
avoid this opulent extravaganza at
all costs.

Buton thebrightside, you will at
least have someone of the opposite
sex who is interested in you (hope-
fully) to share your boredom with.
Those of you who do not have dates
are less fortunate. Yet never fear,
the MacLads have put their heads
together this week and have come
up with a few suggestions to aid
you in avoiding the “slough of de-
spond.”

Here are ten suggestions for lads
and lasses minus dates who would
like to liven up their Homecoming
weekend.

Ladies
(because they should
always be first): t
eRead War and Peace. If you
finish this go on to The Gulag
Archipelago. :
eJoin the Support Group for

women who have a problem with
food. It meets Mondays from 6:30-
7:30 in Chambers 301. No men
allowed. Check announcements
for further details.

eWrite a letter to the MacLads
and include your name and
Davidson address.
eCall Grant Morain (-6334) be-
cause he’s still looking for a date,
Crash a fraternity cocktail party
(or more than one). .

“Miscellaneous” announce-
ments... “WANTED: Davidson

of this is to put food coloring in the
balloons).

take guys now).

Look, ma! New column!

Confidential Health

By AUDREY SHIELDS

This is anew column based on a
question-and-answer format, in-
tended to give information on any
issue concerning your health and

‘ well-being. “Confidential Health”
is written through the advice and
expertise of the staff and faculty on
campus and through the resources
of the Davidson community.

The Davidsonian staff is not in-
volved in reading or answering the
questions. -

This is a confidential process. _

Some of the most commonly
asked questions deal with issues
surrounding our behavior and per-
sonal choices. Some of these issues
include: sexuality, sexually trans-
mitted diseases, contraception,
heterosexual and homosexual rela-
tionships, alcohol and drug use,
nutrition, fitness, tobacco use,
stress, eating disorders, depres-
sion, and other mental health con-
cems.

This week Dr. Audrey Shields:

from the Infirmary answers a ques-
tion of concern to most students.

' “Dear Confidential Health -- It
seems like I always have a cold.
What can be done about. colds? Can
they be prevented?” -- S.K.,
Davidson,

“Dear S.K.: Unfortunately, the
average adult has from two to four
colds yearly. Colds are caused by
many different strains of respira-
tory viruses.

Most colds last for from four to '

seven days. There is no antibiotic
for acold, so treatment is directed
toward relief of the symptoms.
Nasal congestion is usually helped
by decongestants such as Sudafed
or phenylpropanolamine. A vari-

ety of cough syrups and throat loz-

enges may also help. Vitamin C
offers no real proven benefit. As
always, adequate rest and good
nutrition help your body to fight the
virus,

A“‘cold” lasting for more than a
week may actually be due toaller-
gies rather than a virus. Occasion-
ally, colds can result in sinus or
bronchial infections. If-your cold
doesn’t resolve itself in seven days
or if high fever develops you
should consult your physician. ~

The best way to prevent acold is

>to avoid physical contact with

people who have colds. Hand-
washing is particularly beneficial
in this regard. Some spreading of
the virus occurs from droplets (i.e.
a sneeze), but most people give
colds to others from direct physical
contact. No vaccine against the
cold currently exists.

If you have a question, please
send it to:
