intense feeling of not belonging to the

to a feeling many balcks have being
used by the College to keep up its
appearance as a liberal and progress-

Darlene Cunningham believes
“Davidson will always be a nice old
high-standard school for WASPS.
They bring in a few international
students; likewise they bring in a few
blacks. They use us and yet they
think they’re doing us a great favor.”’

Although Billy Hutchinson feels
one “must accept the situation and
work with it,”’ he believes ‘‘the school
is following its priorities: it’s an upper
class institution and there just aren’t
that many upper class. blacks.’’
Hudson underscores the utilitarian
nature of the College’s relations
toward blacks. Says he, “Sometimes
I feel like I’m here to educate rather

be educated.”’
w Many blacks looked hopefully to
the community of Davidson as a pool
for friends with common interests.
Many had their hopes extinguished
by what Darlene describes as ‘‘a

part of the College. They’re willing to

With sparkling eyes and thoughts
of good nutrition, the Davidson
student aspires for the ultimate in
A.M. dining; disappointingly, he
usually settles for Slater.’ Lest he
become despondent from morning
monotony, this week’s focus is on
suitably satiating establishments for
the breakfast set, primarily the two
close enough to campus to be prac-
tical.

Unpretentiously nestled between
the downtown sectors of Davidson
and Cornelius is this area’s preemin-
ent morning diner—The Bunn War-
mer. Being the result of years of
metamorphosis, the modern-day
Bunn Warmer evolved from the fertile
seed of Albert’s Grill, est. 1957; two
ladies, mother and daughter, run it
now. In the words of a regular at the
“BW” (as it is effectively called),
“This place has been here since that
lady was her daughter’s age.”

The Bunn Warmer is a ‘‘home
kitchen’’, in the words of its pro-
prietors, with more than just good
food—the open conversation is nour-
ishment for the soul. Subjects range
from mean husbands to political
debates. I asked, ‘‘What do you talk
about when you're here?’’ Quickly
came the reply, “The people who
aren’t here.”

The specialty of the grill is thick

are known for their high syrup
absorption coefficient which guaran-
tees satisfaction of a working man’s

appetite. Favorites also include
scrambled eggs with cheese and the
ever-rare liver mush. Toast, jam and
grits are served with the breakfast
plates, and of course milk, juice and
coffee are available for those with a
high liquid preference.

Opening at 6:30 am, the cozy
counter-top stylé stool service fur-
thers the intimacy of your dining
experience. The Bunn Warmer is
located about fifty yards to the
Davidson side and across the street

the feeling of being used by the
College should engender something
short of ideal adjustment on the part
of black students. Add to these
factors social opportunities so insuf-
ficiently geared to blacks’ interests
and tastes that Hudson is moved to
declare ‘‘The big problem with being
black at Davidson is the social life,”’
and the picture becomes all the more
bleaker. Truly, the absence of a sense
of belonging many blacks experience
is as serious as it is lamentable.
Sadly, what is even worse than the
feeling of not being a part is the
insouciance this feeling and stifled
efforts to eliminate it beget. Hudson
could recall ‘‘no real successes in over
three years.” He characterized many
blacks’ attitudes by ‘‘malaise and
apathy....maybe- it’s hopelessness.”’
Darlene also cited ‘‘the hopelessness
which has arisen from unsuccessful
efforts,’’ and highlighted the tra-
gicomic nature of the situation in
saying, ‘It gets to the point where
you can’t let prejudice bother you.”
In short, there seems to be among
many blacks a feeling of literally
doing time at Davidson. Many feel
they’ve been admitted to the College

breakfast bars are two in Concord.
The first, open all night, is the Waffle
House, a cozy chain-type place loca-
ted about one mile to the left of where

pretty good (ah, those pecan waf-
fles!), and entertainment is available
by sitting at the counter and wat-
ching the chef whip up omelets.

The second Concordian cafe is the
Tasty World at the Days Inn. The
food is edible, but the decor is exactly
like every other Tasty World you've
ever been in, including the adjacent
gift shop (with Daytona Beach ash
trays and Gatlinburg tee-shirts).

not given the same spportunities for
personal gr@wth which white students
enjoy. Black students reap as much
as possible academically from David-
son as, in theory, all students do. But
socially, four years at Davidson is
something which must be endured
rather than enjoyably experienced.
Asked if he would ever return for
Homecoming, Hudson says, ‘“‘It
doesn’t seem enough like a home to
_come home to.”

Token article

If this article has dwelt dispro-
portionately on the negative and thus
supposedly more newsworthy aspects
of the black experience at Davidson,
it must surely be due to a great deal
more than this reporter’s vain, if
meager, hopes of sensitizing an
audience to social injustice. Pat
Hudson, who incidentally is ‘‘sur-
prised that the Davidsonian’s annual
token article on Davidson's token
blacks came before Christmas this
year,’’ pours salt on an open wound
but highlights a situation in need of
remedy when he says, “I think they
think we're news.”’

and we will not go deeply into these.
Mention should be made of Denny’s,
a favorite of one cult of students.
Many claim that no place in Charlotte
attracts a stranger group of people.
Perhaps by expanding our definition
of breakfast to any morning-time
meal, the ‘‘peak’’ hours of Denny’s, 2
to 5 pm, may be included as due for
consideration. Ask a cultist how to
get there.

Lack of opportunities can be no
excuse for missing the morning meal.

from the 7-11. It is recessed from the
busy through-way and can easily be
missed unless one is committed to the
search. The journey will be rewarded.

The other area alternative is the
Coffee Cup. Being much closer to
campus, (down the street and to the
left from the P.O.) the Coffee Cup has
the advantage of convenience over the
Bunn Warmer. Pancakes, eggs and
sausage also are available here, but a
touch of the humanness is sacrificed
to big business. However, the Coffee
Cup is by no means sterile; besides
they brew a mean cup of coffee, and
the conversation isn’t bad even
though it is usually shouted across
the room.
