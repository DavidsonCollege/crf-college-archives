HOCKEY ROUNDUP

Davidson continues to roll

By Mark HyMERLING
Hockey Correspondent

Facing off against the CSC Flyers, the
only team to beat the Davidson Roller Hockey
team this season, the Wildcats. were on a
mission last weekend.

A win over the Flyers meant a five-game
winning streak, a move to first place in the
league, and of course, revenge.

The Wildcats came jumped to an early 1-
0 lead on a goal by Evan McCormick, as-
sisted by Dave Smith.

Ryan Auster provided an insurance goal
as he ripped aslap shot from the point through
a group of players positioned in front of the
net. The two-goal cushion was cut in half
when a Flyers’ forward picked up a loose
puck and went one-on-one with goalie Jamie
Heit.

. The Wildcats closed the scoring in the
first period when Mark Hymerling fed Ron
Olson, who tucked the puck into the net. Heit
shut the door on the Flyers for the rest of the
first period.

The second period saw the game get
more physical as the opposing defense stayed
on the backs of the Wildcats. Despite the
defense’ s relentless attempt to knock the Wild-
cats off their game, they continued to play a
focused and concentrated attack.

McCormick scored first in the second
period on one of his trademark rushes into the

. Offensive zone, dodging defenders and beat-
ing the goalie with a deft move. Auster fired
home a wrist shot from the slot to widen
Davidson’s lead. ;

Stevinson scored on a wrist shot from the
right face-off circle, beating the goalie through
the five-hole. Hymerling took advantage of a
turnover by the Flyers’ goalie, firing a slap
shotinto an empty net after the goalie sprawled
across the floor.

The Wildcats carried a 7-4 lead into the
third period, as Bryan Stevinson and Heit
provided outstanding defense.

The Wildcats dominated the third pe-
riod, scoring three unanswered goals after the
Flyers had cut the Wildcats’ lead to two.

Auster spotted Hymerling alone in the
slot and feathered a pass to him that he one-
timed into the net. McCormick scored on a
slap shot that went through the Flyers’ goalie
and proved to be the final nail in the coffin.

The Wildcats went on to cruise to the 10-
6 victory on 10-for-10 scoring. :

The Wildcats, now alone in first place,
are the highest scoring team in the league,
recording 52 goals in fewer games that every
other team in the league.

Wildcats win Wofford series 2-1

By Rick BENDER
Davidson S.1.D.

SPARTANBURG, S.C. - After drop-
ping the first game of a twinbill to Wofford,
10-3, Davidson (8-5, 5-1 in SoCon) bounced
back Saturday with a 12-5 victory in the
nightcap to win the series, two games to one.

To open the series, the Wildcats had
scored twice in each of the seventh and eighth
innings to defeat the Terriers last Friday night
by a score of 8-5.

Down 5-4 after six innings, Davidson (7-
4, 4-0) got singles from sophomore Jack
Purcell and senior Ben Brown to start the
seventh. After advancing on a sacrifice by
Ryan Stroker, Tim Frend tied the game with
a grounder to second. Brown then scored on
a wild pitch to give the Wildcats a 6-5 lead.

In the eighth, Cassidy Lundin and Billy
Ryan opened with bunt singles. Toby Crabtree
moved them along with a sacrifice bunt, and
Purcell was intentionally walked to load the
bases. Brown struck out, but Stroker was hit
by apitch, which forced in arun. A wild pitch
scored Davidson’s final run.

Stroker (2-1) earned the victory by pitch-
ing 6-1/3 innings, surrendering five runs (three
earned) on eight hits and one walk while

striking out four. Mark Wells came on and
shut down the Terriers on one hit over the
final 2.2 innings for his first collegiate save.

In the first game Saturday, the Terriers
(2-8, 1-2) scored three in the first off of Jamie
McDonald (1-1), to counter the single run the

Wildcats put on the board in the top half. Two .

in the third, then another in the fifth chased
McDonald from the hill.

Davidson tried to claw its way back into
the game in the seventh, scoring tworuns. But
with the bases loaded and two outs, B.J.
Turner got Ryan to fly out to end the Wild-
cats’ best opportunity. Wofford then scored
four in the eighth to put the game out of reach.
Brian Casey led the Terriers with four RBIs
with two doubles. Chad Livingston banged
out three hits to lead the 12-hit attack. :

Kyle Hadden (1-2) picked up the vic-

tory, hurling 6-1/3 innings and allowing three

runs on three hits. He managed to avoid big
innings despite walking nine batters. Turner
was credited with his first save of the season.

Stewart Sloan had two of Davidson’s
five singles in the game to lead the offense.

A six-run third inning was all the runs
Davidson would need in the finale. The scor-
ing was highlighted by a three-run triple by
Jeremiah Parvin.

The six runs answered Wofford’s four-
run inning in the bottom of the second off of
Wes Self (3-1). All four runs scored with two
outs in the inning, with Livingston providing
half the runs with a two-run double.

With an 8-4 lead in the eighth, the Wild-
cats tacked on four more on four hits, an error
and two passed balls.

Self went 7-2/3 innings, allowing 10 hits
(half of those in the second) and four runs
while walking one and striking outtwo. Wells
pitched the final 1-1/3 innings, striking out
three.

Stroker led Davidson with three hits, and
Sloan delivered his first home run of the
season, a solo blast in the fourth.

Aaron Price, Kevin Blocker and Chris
Cotugno each had two hits for the Terriers .
while Livingston led the team with two RBIs
in the second game.

Charles Bobo (1-2) was stuck with the
loss as he didn’t last the third inning.

Davidson was back in action Tuesday
afternoon at home against Wake Forest try-
ing to avenge their embarrassing 30-4 loss to
the Demon Deacons last Thursday. The 26-
run loss was the worst defeat in Wildcat
baseball history. The results of Tuesday’s
game were not available at press time.
