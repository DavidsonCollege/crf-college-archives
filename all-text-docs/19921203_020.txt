DAVIDSONIAN SPORTS

Musch Scores 22 As Men's
Hoops Tops St. Joseph's

By Chris Hood
Detlef Musch burned St.
Joseph’s for 22 points, Janko Narat
added 19 and a host of newcomers
gained vital experience Wednes-

day night as the Wildcats handed -

St. Joseph’s their first loss in five
contests, 98-78. The contest was
_ the first for Davidson, which earned
a 107-90 exhibition victory over
Imortal Desportivo the previous
Friday.

The Monks, fourth-ranked in

NAIA Division II, came out firing
. three-pointers from the start, hold-
ing the lead until George Spain’s
basket while he was fouled with
11:15 to play in the first half.
Spain’s bucket put the “Cats up 20-
18; Detlef Musch hit both ends of
a one-and-one three. and-a-half
minutes later to give Davidson a
26-25 advantage it would never
relinquish.

Davidson led 42-36at the half,
and St. Joseph’skepthitting bombs
to open the second half, but two
runs by the ‘Cats put the game out

of reach for the visitors. Narat
knocked down a three-pointer and
hita pair of free throws as Davidson
scored nine unanswered points near
the midway mark of the half, and
the ‘Cats held the Monks scoreless
for four minutes late in the game to
assure themselves of the win. Chris
Alpert scored a pair of baskets as
Davidson increased its 84-72 lead
by 10 between the 5:08 and 1:09
marks.

“I don’t really like to play
these kinds of games where we
have to win,” said Musch, who led
all scorers. Zimmerman and Spain
each tallied 13 points; Musch’s 13
rebounds were tops for either team,
and Narat pulled down 10.

“Any time you win, you’re
delighted,” head coach Bob
McKillop commented. “St.
Joseph’s did what they had to in
order to stay in the game, and we’ ll
have to do better defensively.” The
Monks’ 15-for-32 three-point
shooting kept the game competi-
tive for much of the evening.

The Davidson bench contrib-
uted 38 points and a huge boost for
the starters. Alpert, a freshman,
spent a good bit of time relieving
Zimmerman at point guard and
nailed five of six from the floor for
10 points, Spain hit six of eightand
one free throw for 13, and Ron
Horton scored six. Freshmen Jeff
Anderson (who started) and Bran-
don Williams also had six points
apiece, showing excellent athletic
ability mixed in with occasional
reminders that they are freshmen.

Against Imortal Desportivo,
the ‘Cats broke open a close con-
test with an 11-0 run midway
through the half to take a 34-18
lead over the visitors. Narat fol-
lowed a running dunk by Ander-
son with a pair of layups. and a
three-pointer from the baseline, and
Davidson enjoyed a comfortable
lead for the rest of the match.

best halfof basketball we’ve played

Surging Swimmers Prepare to
Face Keydets, Rambling Wreck

By Will Cobb

The Davidson swimming and
diving team has been extremely
busy improving times and compet-
ing against other ‘schools during
the past month. The Davidson
squads faced Howard and North
Carolina early in November, and
beat both teams soundly in both
women’s and men’s competition.
It was the team’s first home meet,
and timescontinued to drop. Coach
Ron Morrow remarked, “All the
1991 team records were shattered
in our first home meet; the team is
much further ahead than at this
point last year.”

Freshman Churchill Hooff
continued to perform well, taking
- first in the 1000 and 100 meter
freestyle. The men’s 400 meter
freestyle relay (Kevin Boler,
Carlton Craig, Hooff, and Dave
Martin) set a school record and
displays the potential for possible
participation inthe NCAA compe-
tition in the spring.

In women’s competition, se-
nior Tracy Barwick took first place
in the 200 meter butterfly with a

time of 2:32.07. Sophomore
Rebecca Falkenburg won the 50
meter freestyle and
freshmanWendy Johnson handily
won the 200 meter individual med-
ley with an impressive time of
2:27.88. Although they faced no
competition from the Bison or Tar
Heels, the diving teams went
through a set of dives and scored
well.

On November 14, the
women’s team took to the pool
against Pfeiffer and Salem, and
defeated them by scores of 144-95
and 189-37, respectively. Johnson
took both the 200 meter individual
medley and the 100 meter freestyle.
Jennifer Schuetz earned a team-
high 17 points in the competition.
Meg Bentley and diver Paige Hull
each scored 13 points for Davidson.
Morrow was pleased with the
team’s performance in the meet.

The Wildcats faced their
toughest test of the year to date in
a home meet against Georgia
Southern and East Carolina No-
vember 21. The women’s diving
team defeated both schools while

the men fell short against the tradi-
tionally powerful ECU squad.
Caroline Prioleau won the three
meter diving competition, while
freshmen Cart deBrux and sopho-
more Thad Reece had outstanding
performances in one and three
meter diving.

Johnson and Schuetz contin-
ued their outstanding performances
in the pool by winning convinc-
ingly. Hooff again droppedhis time
in the 1000 meter freestyle, this
time breaking the 10 minute mark;
he also did well in the 500 meter
freestyle and 200 meter individual
medley as well. Craig swam ex-
tremely well, taking the 200 meter
freestyle, andsenior HaylerOsbom
continued his dominance in the
200 meter breaststroke.

The next meet for the team
will be this Saturday at 1:00 p.m. at
Cannon Pool against Georgia Tech
and VMI. “We are looking to beat
VMI,” Morrow said, “but Georgia
Tech will be extremely tough.
Hopefully our swimmers will be
able to lower their times again.”

KA Wins 2nd Straight Flickerball Title

By Jim Tayberry

In the championship game of
the Men’s Division I flickerball
tournament several weeks ago, the
winner of the loser’s bracket, Just
Average Guys (representing Sigma
Phi Epsilon), were defeated in a
close game 31-25 by Crunch-N-
Munch (representing Kappa Al-
pha). It was Crunch-N-Munch’s
second succéssive Division I title.

KA got off to an early lead,
but Sig Ep fought hard and kept the
game close. KA used ano-huddle,

-hurry-up offense in its march to

victory. Arthur Morehead,
Crunch’s quarterback, had a solid
game as he completed short passes
over the middle tokeep drives alive.
EricGilbert, David Clingman, Matt
Cox, Matt Woodlief, Tom Price,
and Morehead all played well for

the Crunchers. Glenn Smith just
wasn’t much of a factor.

In the final of Men’s Division
II flickerball, 2nd West Belk
smashed the very spirited and loud
3rd East Belk. The dandy hall
counselor duo of Chris Shields and
Richard Rivera led their Freshman
squad through a dominating sea-

Women's Hoops

Returns to Drill Ferrum

By Chris Hood

When Tonya Sharpe hit’a
layup 57 seconds into Tuesday
night’s women’s basketball sea-
son opener against Ferrum, she did
more than open the year’s scoring
for the Wildcats; her bucket was
the first for the varsity squad since

Davidson dropped women’s bas- .

ketball in 1986. ~

Four ‘Cats finished in double
figures as Davidson led from the
beginning in trouncing the Pan-
thers, 64-40, before approximately
400 fans at Belk Arena. Kristen
Ferrucci and Kristin Solsrud each
scored 13, while Erin Butcher
added 12 and Maggie Young 11.

The game was won in the first
half, in which Davidson outscored
the Panthers, 42-16. Davidson’s
defense held Ferrum to six of 28
shooting, while the “Cats connected
on half of their 36 attempts. Many
of Davidson’s baskets directly re-
sulted from fast breaks caused by
turnovers or beating the Panthers’
press.

The key for Davidson i in the
opening minutes was overcoming
first-game anxiety. As one of nine
freshmen on John Filar’s squad,
Ferrucci admitted she was “really
nervous. This was definitely a step
up from high school.” Eight of the
nine freshmen played against
Ferrum, and six saw over 10 min-
utes of playing time.

Erin Butcher began the sec-
ond half with a driving layup, and
Ferrucci made a free throw to in-
crease Davidson’s lead to 45-16,
but the ‘Cats were unable to domi-
nate as they had in the first half. A

basket by Ferrucci with 4:03 re-
maining rescued Davidson from
nearly an eight-minute scoreless
period in which Ferrum closed the
gap from 55-22 to 55-32; Young ~
followed with a pair of buckets,
including athree-pointer, with time
running down to solidify the vic-
tory.

“We let down some in the

_ second half, and we were notnearly

as fluid,” head coach John Filar
assessed. “It was more mental than
anything; there just wasn’t quite as
much adrenaline in the second
half.”

Nevertheless, Davidson’s pro-
gram has advanced rapidly since
Filar led a club team into competi-
tion last year. The ‘Cats spread
their scoring evenly, and Ferrucci
and Butcher, who pulled down 16
and 12 rebounds, respectively, pro-
vided plenty of muscle Tuesday
evening. “We also got anice spark
off the bench from some players,”
Filar added.

The ‘Cats return to action Sat-
urday at 6:00 p.m. when Washing-
ton and Lee visits. The Generals
are in their first year of varsity
play, and Davidson won both meet-
ings between the club level teams
a year ago.

If the Ferrum contest is an
indication, Davidson is likely on
its way to its third consecutive
victory over the Generals. “You
would not believe how far we’ve
come in the last year,” senior Jen-
nifer Roos said. “When: Tonya
made the layup and we heard the
crowd roar. . . we knew we were
for real.” :
