Ada Jenkins School Becomes

Davidson Community Center

Ada Jenkins School for the
past ten years.
formation was acquired
during a discussion with
Chairman of the Davidson
Park and Recreation Com-
mittee Randall Kincaid.)

Ada Jenkins School, as an
institution, was attended
solely by black students
before the desegregation
ruling made by the Supreme
Court. Approximately ten
years ago, it was vacated as
the blacks were moved to
Davidson Elementary School,
which had been all-white prior
to the integration.

This integration left the
building idle, which is the way
that it remained for many
years. Three years ago (or
somewhere thereabouts) the
idea came up that the town of
Davidson could use a kin-
dergarten for the children of
the community. Consequently,
some of the concerned
citizens sought federal funds
to support such a project. Af-

ter the necessary application .

and investigation, the funds
were granted for the operation
of the kindergarten.

Hence, Ada Jenkins School
acquired a new name, the
Davidson Child Development
Center. This name still is im-
printed on the front of the
building, even though there is
no longer a kindergarten in
operation),

The child development

program was discontinued
when federal funds were with-
drawn.

The rationale of the gov-
ernment for making this move
was that the town’s populace
had grown in income status,
That is, the people of Davidson
were making too much money

The in- -

to be on federal assistance
supporting a kindergarten.
This position was noticeable
according to the census”
figures released at that tme.
Now Ada Jenkins School

was no longer the Davidson |

Child Development Center.
Once again, it stood idly by,
one of the many relics of the
“Old South’’ prior to in-
tegration.

Time passed. Then, about
one year ago, an organization
known as the Open House
(located in Charlotte) became
interested in the building for
their purposes. After inquiring
as to the availability of the
space, they were told to check
the. attitude of the town to-
wards having Open House use
the building.

Consequently, there was a
strong reaction against such a
measure which was voiced
mainly by those who reside
nearest the school. As an
alternative to the dilemma of
whether to lend the building to
the Open House or to let it
stand idle and waste away,
there was the suggestion that
it be’ developed into a com-
munity center for the town.

The Town Council took over
the matter at this point. First,
they decided to refer the mat-
ter to the Park and Recreation
Committee. Then they ap-
pointed Kincaid as the new
chairman of this committee.
Thus, the committee began an
investigation into the
possibility of returning the
building to the use of the town
and the feasibility of making it
a community center for the
town. |

This is the position in which
the building may be found
today. Davidson has a com-
munity center, which seeks to
operate for the benefit of the
entire populace.

After making the af-
firmative decision regarding
the community center, the
committee decided to lease
two thirds of the building for a

SUMMERS

(Ed. Note: This is the second installment
of a three-part series on counseling at
Davidson.)

Having received two grants of $22,000
from the Office of Cooperative Education of
the U.S. Department of Health, Education
and Welfare; Davidson College has hired
Ken N. Wood as director for experimental
learning programs and placement.

Wood has assumed the duties of handling
the placement aspect of the program with
Suzie Summers, who has_ been handling
most of the placement responsibilities over
the past few years while working in the
College Union. He is also now responsible
for developing internships, career service
projects and other off-campus experiences
for students and deals with the portion of ex-
tended studies projects which necessitate
off-campus studies.

“TI conceive of my office as a kind of
brokerage, allowing myself to serve as a
liason to. inform students as to what is
available in the way of learning resources
outside of the campus experiences and. to
form bridges between student and academic
communities and student and outside com-
munities,’’ said Wood.

He expressed optimism about his office
handling both experiential learning
programs and placement. ‘‘The two com-
ponents of this office will complement each
other,” Wood said. ‘Through providing ex-
posure to students, they can develop many
of their own contacts and give themselves
‘options to explore on their own,’’Wood in-
dicated.

“In .our placement emphasis, we are
looking for vocational development for the
student, rather than a senior year attempt
to make some bread,” Wood explained.

“T’d like to explore the ways in which we
can use alumni; they are our vast untapped
resource,’’ he added. ‘‘Alumni have access
to temporary internships and more per-
manent jobs. I’d like to think we could play -
the role of a catalyst to serve between the
alumni and students.’’

Wood is presently building a file of sites
for opportunities in career service, in-

ternships, placement and extended studies

involvement.

College President Samuel R. Spencer Jr.
expressed his personal opinion that David-
son students would use off-campus learning
experiences to serve rep A rather than

“I agree that field experience should be a
consciousness-developing process where
students develop a sense of human needs
and community needs and examines his own

relationships with Wood
elaborated, *

He indicated that most Davidson students :
have been sheltered-in-regard to many
worldly experiences and life-styles.

“Students who go to Davidson are not
those who have had great exposure to
human needs. People who are economically
disadvantaged, such as the. people of Ap-
palachia or the inner city areas of our large
urban centers live in cultures pretty foreign
to students here: I think students-at David-
son need to examine their life styles in per-
spective -with the needs, problems and ex-
priences of people such as these,” said
Wood. ©

Wood felt that little has been done here in
the past to prepare students for study
abroad or for other experiences away from
the Davidson campus. ~

““Tt seems to me that there has been very
little done in preparing students for off-
campus experiences. Little happens when

others,’’

_ they return to integrate their experiences

with the rest of the academic program.

“J think it’s important to work with
students during the quarter prior to their
leaving Davidson to help them to articulate
their own goals for the program and to help
them gain skills in analyzing their situations
and in listening; often non-verbal listening
skills for communication with people in
foreign cultures.”

Wood expressed hope that various faculty
members and clinical psychologist would be
working with students, often in group
sessions, to assimilaté off-campus ex-

. periences with Davidson academia.

“I don’t come here with any canned
programs or. definite answers,’’ said Wood.
“I’m here to expand and support what’s
moving here.I think it’s up to students to a
large degree to determine how this office
will be used to benefit them. Hopefully
students will be thinking about using their
entire four year college experience, not oe
a summer or year abroad or job after
graduation,’’ said Wood. ~

Both Suzie and I are committed, we’re
working together for the same things. Our
offices are open, and students get : the
priority,”’ Wood concluded. |

Wood and Summers have offices located
in the basement of Chambers building in the
student counseling services area. eer oie Seale
