LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Kendrick Postulates ‘Absurdities,

Dear Editor:

This morning, as is my
habitude, I retired to my room
with a flagon of vintage port
and the daily newspaper to
greet the day. Although I was
somewhat chagrined to discov.
er that I had picked up THE
DAVIDSONIAN instead of Le
Monde, I decided to make the
best of it and hearken unto the
mews and editorial voice of the
Davidson College student
body. Lifting my eyes from
Mr. Magnus’ amusing cartoon,
I skimmed Mr. Kendrick’s let-
ter.

Thinking (an occupational
hazard of the Junior Year
Abroad program) about Mr.
Kendrick’s theses (and I use
this word loosely), I realized
what ‘‘manner of man"’ wrote
this tirade. This can best be

shown by careful considera-
tion of the converses and im-
plications of its main points.

(1) A gnome studies 11
hours, sleeps seven, and at-
tends classes the rest of the
day. Passing over the stylis-
tie exaggerations this asser-
tion contains, one gains the
impression that study, espec-
fally intensive study, is sus-
pect. After all, what did the
gnome come to Davidson for if
he wanted to study?

(2) The gnome asks syco-
phantic questions after each
class, and the professor is
taken in. Following this, one
would think that the non-
gnome never questions be-
cause: (a) He knows the an-
swers. (b) He is afraid of ap-
pearing a “suck”. (c) He
hasn't followed the lecture

Ungentlemanly Criticism

Uncovers Jealousy

Dear Editor:

At last we know what is
meant by the well-known eate-
gorization of this college's
students as ‘‘Davidson gentle-
men.”

And at last we have found
a clear-cut example of this
“cool’’ Davidsonian. Witness
the letter to the editor of this
paper from Mr. Bilt Kendrick.

Now that we are aware of
the above we can get to the
task of “stamping out’ all who
do not fit this category.

Of course I am being sar-
eastic; therefore I shall quote
freely from page 349 of G. W.
Allport’s The Nature of Pre-
judice.

“The easiest idea to sell
anyone is that he is better than

someone else. Snobbery is a
way of clutching at one’s sta-
tus...

“By turning their attention
to unfavored _ out-groups,
(snobs) are able to derive
from the comparison a modi-
cum of self-esteem.”

Maybe Mr. Kendrick’s prob-
lem is that he is afraid that
the objects of his derision are
getting more out of their col-
lege education that he is.

Maybe Mr. Kendrick is for-
getting that we are all human
and we all have the right to
live the way we want without
being subjected to the kind of
ungentlemanly criticism which
he has levied upon us.

Social Council Requests

Better Audience Conduct

Dear Editor:

Since Homecoming we have
heard many comments, both
good and bad, concerning the
Righteous Brother's Concert.

The Social Council feels that
these comments are fine for
after the concert, but we also
feel that during the concert the
audience should refrain from
interjection such as ‘‘get
aft’, “shut up”, “sit down”,
and the perennial hiss.

There are several good rea-
sons for our feeling this way
about the unnecessary ‘‘noise’’
at concerts.

1.) It ruins the concert for
those who have paid to see
good entertainment without
audience participation. A rude
audience is only hurting itself
because an insulted performer
is never at his best.

2.) Even though the hiss is
an acceptable mode of expres-
sion around Davidson, out-
siders such as the Righteous
Brothers are appalled by it.
and refer to the Davidson aud-
jence as ‘‘the rudest bunch”

they have ever seen, much
less played before.

3.) It is discouraging for
members of the Social Coun-
cil to work so hard for what
we feel is a great concert,
only to see the Righteous
Brothers cut half of their act
because they are literally
afraid of remaining on stage
too long.

4.) This unfavorable aud-
ience reaction hinders us in
booking other top talent. Al-
ready reports have been re-
P3—Social Council Regrests
ceived from other agents who
have already “heard all
about” our student body.

5.) We feel that hissing
makes an audience, if nothing
else, look perfectly ridiculous
to outsiders.

We can do aothing else but
ask your co-operation in mak-
ing the remainder of our con-
certs as successful as they
should be in every respect.

well enough to ask a reason-
ably intelligent question.

Mr. Kendrick repeats the
threadbare assertion that a
professor, regardless of his
personal study experience, his
association with other students,
and his native intelligence, is
easily fooled by even those as
repulsive as gnomes. I detect
less observation in this than
sour grapes.

(3) The gnome retires at
11:00 p.m., and unreasonably
insists that noise of volume
sufficient to penetrate his
Ttoom's walls be checked. This
infuriating trait infringes on
the non-gnome's right to play
Mary Wells as loudly as pos-
sible, sing along, and pound
on his friends’ doors.

tion, the student regulations,
and the security forces are

tional gnomunist conspiracy.

(4) The gnome rarely dates
because he can't find anybody
as pitiful as he is, or because
he can't communicate in less
than intellectual terms. Re-
sisting the temptatien to infer
that the non-gnome has no
trouble in finding someone as
pitiful as himself, one sees
that the gnome inexcusably
flaunts his reading and educa-
tion by using words that ex-
press his thoughts more clear-
ly and exactly.

(5) The gnome has no liking
for and does not participate in
athletics. Aside from the pet-
ty-mindedness of scoring
someone for not liking the
things he likes, I wonder if

Mr. Kendrick feels that physi-

(besides the pre-pro ball ma-

It would also be interesting

ities.

Curriculum Change Vital
To Davidson's Program

Dear Editor: ,

Davidson College has reach-
ed a fork in the road which
will decide her future. In- one
‘direction lies the smoothly
paved road of mediocrity and
tradition (i.e., being good, but
not nearly the best).

In the other direction lies
the road—unpaved, of course
—toward a new and more ma-
ture concept of learning which
could establish Davidscn as a
leader in higher education.

Davidson has everything that
is necessary for building a
program at which other insti-
tutions would turn as green as
their ivy.

She has a student body which
is longing for a modern cur-
riculum, professors who can
ably present it, and the ma-
terial resources with which to
make it a reality instead of the
dream. that it now is.

In the German university
exists the state of pure aca-
demic freedom for which we
are often told a liberal arts
college (Davidson?) strives.

The German student -selects
the number of courses for
which he feels he can do the
work and doesn’t have to wor-

ry about paying an extra tax.

if his desire or need for extra
courses is above a set limit,
or if he didn’t have a certain
“projected average’’’ whea he
entered.

He attends class not because
he has only one cut left, but
because he wants to learn.
Since there are few tests or
grades (there are none in the
larger lecture classes, but in
the smaller seminars a final
exercise, Kilausurarbelt, or
term paper, Hausarbeilt, grad-
ed cn a pass or fail basis may
be required), the student is
left to work according to his
own desire and initiative.

The student prepares him-
self for an exam (also pass or

- fail) given every three or four

semesters which determines
his right to continue studying,
and for the final (Abschiuss)
exam which usually comes
after eight semesters of study.
If this free system works in
a university, why wouldn't it
work as well or even better at
Davidson?
,Davidson has an advantage
which universities (German
and American) and the ma-
jority of American colleges

have lost at the undergraduate
level and that is the small
size of her student body which
enables close contact between’
students and professors and a
vital exchange of ideas and
concepts on a personal level.

If a new curriculum means
try:ng new ideas, hiring more
professors (or replacing a few
professors?), expanding course
offering. and the use of sem-

inars as the main class unit,

then that is what must be done
if Davidson wants to be count-

‘ed among the top colleges of

the future.

Davidsca has reached the
fork. Let's be bold enough to
make the decision which will
make other colleges look to
Davidson as a leader and as a
goal in modern education and
not vice versa. The time is
now or never.

erate” gnome is scurrying to
the library?

Third. even if the non.gnome
loses the Hare-and-Tortoise
race to the library, it is not
possible for the gnome to keep
out the necessary books longer
than two weeks if the non-
gnome puts in a request for
them. I feet the situation Mr.
Kendrick describes only oc-
curs when the non-gnome wan-
ders over to the library a few
days before the paper falls
due.

(7) The gnome never lends
his notes out. Shame, shame.
The gall of those gnomes! Not
only do they attend class, but
they actually take notes and
listen, and even ask questions
to clear up points!

And if that's not bad enough.
they refuse to pick up hitch-
hikers and share their ill-got-
ten spoils. I fear that. I'm be-
ing excessively Aesopian. but
this one reminds me of the Ant
and the Grasshopper.

(8) The. gnome’s weekly en-
tertainment consisis of drink-
ing quarts of beer at Hattie's
and being obnoxious. Come
now, Mr. Kendrick! Surely you
must admit that the only dif-
ference jn this area is that
the gnome only worships
Bacchus weekly, whereas the
non-gnome is somewhat more
frequent! Of is that your cri-
ticism?

(9) The gnome’s extra-cur-
ricular activities consist of
(a) asking irrelevant quest-
tions at Open End, or (b)
throwing frisbees on Cham-
bers Lawn. Perhaps (a) is ex-
plained by two observations:
the non-gnome, as his defini-
tion emerges in this letter, is
rarely present at Open End,
and, when present. he feels
the gnome's questions are ir-
relevant because he does not
understand them (cf. Ken-
drick’s thesis No. 4 (b); (b) I
am grieved to taint two hither-
to unblemished reputations
with gnomishness, but I, even
1, saw our own beloved Presi-
dent and Fraternity Liaison
Officer throwing the object
described in the very place
mentioned. Yea, the hand of
the Gnome doth lie heavily
upon Israel.

€10) The gnome approves of
a chapel speaker by taking

notes, disapproves by hissing.
This assertion is unaccepta-
ble to any empirical observer,
because the non-gnome is (1)
not present (cf. No. 14), (2)
asleep (cf. No. 3), or (3)
cramming for his next. class;
and thus unable to gather evi-
dence to support this conten-
tion.

(11) The gnome is upset
when he hears noise from a
concert or an athletic event
in his library den. This con-
tention also fails for lack of
evidence, since (unless Ken.
drick himself is Unclean) its
author has never been in the
library during one of the a-
forementioned events.

(12) The gnome applies for
scholarships at every grad-
uate school, hurting mnon-
gnomes’ chances. Again the
repugnant nature of the gnome
is shown. Not only has the
gnome unfairly studied for
four years, but he actually
expects to take advantage -of

-his work!

The reports on over-crowded '

graduate schools, with no sure-
ty of acceptance regardless of
record have apparently not
reached Mr. Kendrick, who
with his non-gnome colleagues
would have the gnome consult

them about to which graduate’

schools he may apply.

(13) The gnome favors non-
drinking on campus and com-
pulsory Vespers. It is difficult
to reconcile this contention
with Mr. Kendrick's No. 8, on
the inebriety of: gnomes, or
No. 1, on their using every
spare minute for study.

‘Il suggest that Hattie’s does
not offer an example of Aca-
demeian quiet. and the gnomes
who vote against bringing Hat-
tie's home have this in mind.
although I remain unconvinc-
ed that they are a majority.

I challenge Mr. Kendrick’s
Statement that gnomes vote
for compulsory Vespers, and
feel that he must have had
certain pre ministerial stu
dents in mind, who count it as
lab.

(14) The gnome never cuts
class, chapel.
parking ticket. Again the non
gnome bias against attending
class is evident, and again a
contradiction arises because
chapel obviously offers needed

But then, cutting chapel on

poorness jis alien to -non-
gnomes. who do it as a social
grace (Tea-Time at Mary’‘s).

(15) The gnome bathes once
a month, and his room smells
bad. Really. Mr. Kendrick! If
you had surveyed the janitors
instead of cutting this invec-
tive out of whole cloth, you
would have discovered that it
is precisely your “gnomes”
that maintain their rooms, ef-
fects and persons in cleanli-
ness and order.

If the state of the room next
to you offends your sensibili-
fies to such an extent that you
must publish the fact, I cannot
conceive of your entering the

The ‘‘gnome™ he describes,
if taken in all his 15 unlikely:
attribules, is a schizophrenic
of whom there may exist one:
if the contradictions and ab-
surdities Mr. Kendrick postu-
lates are removed, he is the

cates can be drawn from what
he is against, the non-gnome
emerges as a ‘‘student’ a-
gainst study, class attendance,
