After half a month of Chemistry
study sessions, Mickie and Mooch

the realm of third-base, Davidson
juniors Mike Vedder and Julie
Swanson celebrated their second
anniversary with an exchange of
aluminum foil gifts.

Just last week the couple delight-
ed fellow Third Belk residents by
announcing their one-week, papier
mache anniversary. They are but
two weeks away from the coveted,
rarely-attained mica anniversary.
When one hallmate accused her of
being pretentious, Julia responded
with a look of noncomprehension,
then said, “We just like to pretend
that we’re a lot older than we are,
and act really serious about it and
know that we’re better than other
couples because of our maturity.”
Mike chimed in, “These tin and
gifts represent the solidity of our
relationship. It’s pretty unique.”
The couple is heartset on planning
a commitment to the obligation of
avowing the promise of one day
becoming engaged. A date has not
yet been set.

Boxer Knocks Out Frogmanhenry the index and thumb finger tech-

After nearly seven months of
silence and exile, disgraced
Microsoft Outlook Web Access
host Frogmanhenry has finally spo-
ken with campus media.

The former URL prefix, current-
ly allowing off-campus e-mail
access to students at Wake Forest
University, could only stand and
watch this past summer as
Davidson administrators elected
not to renew his contract and
instead sign up-and-coming inter-
net hotshot Boxer to a three-year
deal.

In an exclusive interview last
week, Frogman enlightened the
Yowl’s team of investigative
reporters with the details of his ter-
mination.

“There’s what they told you, and
then there’s the truth,” the ex-serv-
er from his new home in Winston-
Salem said. “If you think I got
canned simply because of my web
skills, you’re kidding yourself.”

According to Frogmanhenry,
school officials caught wind of a
steamy relationship between him
and web counterpart Shirley,
which, unbeknownst to either party,

nique, leaving out the middle fin-
ger so as to not imitate the act of
applying lipstick. I’ve given lip
balm a chance, but all that dab-
bing and applying just made me
feel like I was putting on makeup.

Shirley, unhelpful to anyone last
week, could not be reached for
comment, though her close friend
Louise had this to say: “L:louise is
not accessible. Access is denied.”

Despite Frogman’s accusations,

“School officials caught

Frogmanhenry and web
counterpart Shirley,

policy.”

the College's ITS director, Blair
Butane, stood by her decision: “It’s
simple. Frogmanhenry provided
Davidson with years of dedicated |
service, but when it came down to =
dollars and cents, Boxer was the
obvious choice. And besides,
Frogmanhenry is just a &$#@!$%
weird name.”
