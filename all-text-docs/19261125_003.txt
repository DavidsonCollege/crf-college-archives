THE DAVIDSONIAN, NOVEMBER 25, ‘1926

Tyinkle Little Star

Scintillate, scintillate,
Infinitesimal planetary orb,
Incessantly I interrogate
Your constituent element,
Up above this sphere so high
Similar to an Incandescent rhomboid

in thessky. .

Garrison—“Why don’t they have women
engineers?”

Short—“Because they'd stay out too
lzte with fast mails.”

Misogynist
Copeland—"T hate all deceitful women.”
Westbrook—“Ah, a woman-hater.”

Speaking of women, they ought to have
cleaner minds than men—they change
them oftener.

Professor—“I look at the falling snow
and just wonder why the little snow-
flakes dance.”

Fresh Monk — “Couldn’t it be because
they’re getting ready for the big snow
ball?”

The professor was trying to deliver a!
lecture to a crowd of boisterous stu- |

dents. “There’s so much noise that I
can’t hear myself talk,” he at last ven-
turend to assert.

“Cheer up,” came a voice from the rear,
“You ain’t missed much.”

Lady (to tramp)—“Aren’t you the same
man I\ gave some biscuits last week?”

Tramp—“No, ma’am. And what’s more,
my doctor says I never will be the same
man again.”

Chemistry Prof.. — “What's limburger
cheese composed of?”

Campbell—“It ain’t composed, it’s de-
composed.”

Bradford—“What’s the matter with’
Ed Douglass’ eye?”

Gilmore—“Well, we went to see ‘The
Vanities’ and the fiddler’s elbow struck
Ed in the eye.”

Sullivan—‘T heard a ghost story the
other night and my! it did make me
move,”

She—“T wish I knew it.”

Aesop’s Best
Four animals went to the circus — a
pig, a duck, a frog, anda skunk.

They all got in except the skunk. The
}pig had four quarters, the “duck a bill,

| the frog a green back; but the skunk had

| Only a scent.”

Wells—“What

| Norwood—“You say your girl insulted
you?”

| Sparrow—“Yeah, she told me to put my |

|hat on when she heard a woodpecker

| knocking on the pole across the stree.”

History Prof.—“Tomorrow we will take
the life of Abe Lincoln. The class will
|

please come prepared.” -

Fritz Littlejohn’ says that his. girl is)
so. fond of arguing she seldom eats any- |
thing that agrees with her.

There was a young woman so thin
| She looked the same as a pin;
Don't think I would creep
To the keyhole to becp,
I was told by a friend who looked in,

All things come to him who orders hash |

Only the Interest
| I sent my boy to college
With a pat upon his back,
| I spent ten thousand dollars
| And got a quarterback. |

Branch—“Why do you always carry
that towel to dinner with you?” |
Jones—“I’m always afraid they'll have |
soup and I want to save my mustache.”

' Prof. (in Georgraphy class)—Why is
dry air not healthy?”

Leo Pritchett—‘Because it hasn't any

moisture in it.”

that’s ever kissed you?”
She—“I don’t see why they all ask the
same question. Of course you are.”
Speaking of stingy men, how about the
Jew that was so stingy he tried to send a
night letter duringthe last clipse of the
sun.

THAT’S the way P. A. talks to you in the bowl
of a pipe. This great national gloom-chaser
stabs the darkest clouds with a ray of sunshine.
Buy a tidy red tin of Prince Albert today and
see. Tamp a load of this friendly tobacco into
your jimmy-pipe and light up.

Cool as a sub-cellar. Sweet as the breath of
fresh-cut violets. Fragrant in the tin and fra-
grant as you smoke it. Never a tongue-bite or
a throat-parch. So mild you can hit it up from
sun-up to sun-down, yet with a body that satisfies

There’s more philosophy in a pipe-load of
P. A. than in the average Doctor’s thesis. No
matter what brand you are smoking now, you
don’t know how much your jimmy-pipe can
mean to you until you pack it with good old
Prince Albert. Get started now.

PRINGE ALBERT

—no other tobacco is like it!

lo be

P.A. is sold everywhere in
tidy red tins, | tipe and half.
pound tin humidors, and
pound crystal-glass humidors
with sponge-moistener top.
And always with every bit
of bite and parch removed by

the Prince Albert process.

Coat Weigh With You?

Lots of heavy weight coats are actually less worn than those of lighter,
more closely woven fabrics---and they’ré seldom as styleful.
