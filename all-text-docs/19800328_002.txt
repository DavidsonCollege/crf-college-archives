_ Davidson will definitely have
a new student-run pop radio
' this term, according to Janet
Coleman, who with David Sap-

students will be able; to ‘hear

‘broadcasts by plugging'their —

radios into wall sockets con-

ing to Sappenfield.

Broadcasting will begin as
soon as the ROTC Department
clears a store room in the
basement of Belk.

The station will broadcast. a
mixture of rock, jazz, and folk
from 10 am to midnight 6 days a
week and 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. on
Saturdays.

However, this depends on the
station’s operating budget

next month. —

Clarifications

Evaluation

All students will not be
required to sign sheets indenti-
fying their faculty evaluation
forms, as stated in The David-
sonian last week.

Individual professors may re-

quire their students to sign the |

sheets, but students will then
have the right to refuse to fill
out an evaluation form.

Budget cut

The $85,000 cut in the athle-
‘tic budget will not be primarily

vate colleges from 15.5 million
to 68.8 million dollars. This
would allow each student to
receive $1500, an increase of
$825 over the present average
state subsidy of $675.

_ Green's proposal would fix
state aid to students in private
colleges at one-half of that

‘which University of North Car-

olina schools receive.
Carl Stewart, Green’s oppo-

‘nent in the May 6 primary,

opposes the increase because it
would limit the authority of the
state legislature in budget-
making decisions. wi

Stewart also suggests that
such an increase in state aid
could conceivably result in a
loss of some of the indepen dence
private schools enjoy. -

Both Democratic candidates
for Governor, Bob Scott and

incumbent Jim Hunt, said the

proposal deserves careful con-
sideration. Neither candidate

Jackson saw the 234 un-
claimed balllots as purely a
result of students not crossing
out thei names or initialing the
directories. “We haven’t used
the directories in an election in
over a year...I’m not surprised
that everyone didn’t sign the
books,” Jackson said.

Another possible reason for
the discrepancy was one of the
day; that could: probably ac-
count for 80 or 90 ballots,

Austin and Lloyd apparently
acted without Bowie’s know-
ledge. ‘‘We just wanted to see if
the count was accurate,’’ Lloyd
said. Asked about any suspi-
cions of ballot stuffing, Lloyd

issue.

-Green believes his proposal
will better insure the future of
North Carolina’s private col-
leges, mitigate the competition
between state and private
schools for state tax money,
and eventually cost the North
Carolina taxpayer less.

many ideas while campaigning
and will follow up on as many as
possible. ‘‘I hope that the ideas
continue to flow.”’

Waddill invited all interested
students to attend the open
SGA meetings on Tuesdays at
9:00 p.m. and to look into posts
available on the Advisory Coun-
cils which will be open after

said, ‘‘we don’t want to draw
any conclusions.”

In a meeting with candidates.

Robert Bowie, Richard Terry,
and David Waddill last night,
Jackson said that all agreed
there had been no ‘‘evidence for
ballot f for any of the
candidates.”’ ‘‘I can’t believe
anyone would suspect that,’’
Jackson said.

In the meeting with the
candidates, all felt the results
were fine and saw no reason for
another election, although Aus-
tin and Lloyd did, Jackson said.

Jackson thought perhaps the
“system should be looked at,”
and he plans to suggest some
type of investigation to Presi-
dent-elect Dave Waddill.

The final vote rested at 482
ballots credited to Waddill,
270 to Terry, and 227 to Bowie.

“Some of us lost our tempers—

Miller said he was upset that
the soccer players were practi-
cing on a wet field—‘‘which
tends to wear out the field in a
hurry....We gotta have a place
to practice if we're going to be
successful.”

““We’re authorized to have
Spring football practice, and
that’s one of our fields,” Miller
added. a

When asked if the soccer
team’s having permission from
Sterling Martin to use the field
made a difference, Miller said,
“He's in charge.”” However,
Farrell pointed out that “the
