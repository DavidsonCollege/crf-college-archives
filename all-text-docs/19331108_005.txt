’CATS TO FACE
CITADEL BULLDOGS

————

BACASKIE NOQVELL 38.

The classic battle between Da-
vidson and The Citadel will be the
main attraction Armistice Day on
Richardson Field. The two ancient
rivals will meet in their annual
battle in a game sponsored for the
benefit of the Baby Hospital in
Charlotte. Davidson and The Cita- .
del have always played a close
game of clean football and the
1933 encounter should be no dif-
ferent.

Davidson fans will have the oppor-
tunity of seeing two of the South's
greatest punters in action here next
Saturday. Quarterman of The Citadel
is considered one of the country’s out-
standing booters, while Mackorell, Da-
vidson field general, is one of the
South’s best, and has shown much im-
provement this year over his work of
last season.

The Bulldogs come to Davidson
this year with a not over-impres-
sive record in back of them, their
main claim to glory being that
they held the powerful University
of South Carolina Gamecocks to
a six-point margin of victory.
However, Davidson met The Cita-
del under simil cir t
last year, and a vastly under-rated
Bulldog eleven took the Wildcats
down, 7-6.

The rivlary between Davidson and
Citadel is an ancient one, dating back
to 1910, when the ’Cats and the Bull-
dogs played to a 0-0 tie. Only once
have more than two touchdowns sep-

arated the two teams, on that occasion,

the Wildcats winning, 27-6. The Da-
vidson boys have won eight contests
to two for The Citadel, and two ended
in ties.

After a fortnight of inactvity the
Davidson
whip into action on Richardson
Field Friday when they meet the
Wofford yearlings. The Wildkit-
tens have tied Lees-McRae Junior
College, and lost to N. C. State

when the Watts “World Wonders”
brought home the bacon, 7-0, but the
Wattsonians were too much for them,
and the last quarter touchdown, made
on a pass, Smyre to Miller, proved to
be the deciding factor.

Great personages of the football
world were on both teams. Outstand-

Callie, Wehner, and Smyre, while Mc-
Kinney, “Cokey” Branton, and Mad-
ison Armistead appeared to be the
shining lights for Georgia.

The game showed little

successful passing attack. Most of the

Wildcat Harriers Win

Over General Runners

Dunaj, of W. & L., Takes First,
Followed by Eight David-
son, Men

The Davidson harriers again showed
their heels to opponents here last -Fri-
day when they decisively defeated: the
Washington & Lee runners, led by the
fleet-footed Dunaj, by a score of un-
even proportions, 20-43.

The distance of three miles was ne-
gotiated by Dunaj in the fairly good
time of 16 minutes and 54 seconds.
He was followed in close order by the
whole Davidson team, for the Wild-
cats placed the next eight men in or-
der before the second General was
able to come in.

Dunaj, sports followers will remem-
ber, is the man who gave the leading
milers in the South such a run
track circles last spring.

The Davidson team was without the
services of its captain in the race, as
Frazier has been laid up for some
time with a cold, and was also un-
able to compete in the meet with N. C.
State. He is expected to be in good
shape for the next meet, however.

Unless a meet is procured for this
week, the only remaining run for the
harriers is a meet on November 18th
with the Cavaliers of Virginia.

The order in which the runners came
in, with the points scored by each, is
as follows: Dunaj (Washington and
Lee), 1; Oakes (Davidson), 2; Mer-
chant (Davidson), 3; Morrow (David-
son), 4; Gullette (Davidson), 5; Mc-
Fadyen (Davidson), 6; Glass (David=
son), 7; Morris (Davidson), 8; (last
two Davidson men do not count in
team scoring) ; Browning (Washington
and Lee), 9; Drake (Washington and
Lee), 10; Woodburg (Washington and

face a powerful team from Citadel
next Saturday in one of the several
inter-Carolina games which have taken
place this year.
The dope sheet fayors the Charleston

Presbyterian College to a 7-6 victory,
and P. C. beat Wofford 20 to 0, while
the best the Wildcats could do against
the Terriers was 28-13.

may find it tough sledding when they

Citadel were good enough to
give the South Carolina Birds a
mighty tight battle, and forced them
to use their regulars for three quar-
