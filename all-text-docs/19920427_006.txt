Selection

Continued from page 5

age those whom they didn’t
like from self-selecting their
house. Oral encouragements
(called by one student in 1980
“thinly disguised bids”) became
the rule in 1978, with active
discouragements prohibited.
Realism prevailed, though, and
it became clear that the social
stigma of joining a house you
were not wanted at overpow-
ered the principles of self se-
lection. This is the current situ-
ation of Patterson Court. You
can select any house you want,
but who would dare select a
house they were not givena bid
to? Self-selection as conceived
in 1970 exists no longer, but it
has evolved.

Self-selection changed
because its reasons and argu-
ments carry little water today.
Davidson’s size, so small in
1971, has increased considera-
bly, and the opportunities that
have come with it (including
cocducation and a larger inde-
pendent population) have also
grown, destroying the notion
of there being no viable social
alternatives. Previously, there
were no alternatives to the fra-
ternitics. If you were inde-
pendent, you had no social life,
since fraternity parties were all
closed. Now, however, parties
areallopen. With that change,
the distinction between frater-

nity and independent is not as strong
as it was in the sixties. The mixed
nature of residence halls, the increased
mobility of students, the increased ac-
cessibility of entertainment outside the
college campus, and the viable eating
alternative of the Vail Commons for
independents and fraternity members
alike has helped close the social gap.

But as much as the times and the
college has changed, the premises of
minimizing rejection, although noble,
sull proves impractical. Life is full of
rejections, social and otherwise. Stu-
dents are rejected from receiving
Resident Advisor and Hall Counselor
positions, rejected at the polls forSGA,
and will be rejected from job positions
after they leave college. Self-selec-
uion approached the ridiculous in trying
to eleminate it, as illustrated by Phi
Davies ’81: “I think our local chapters
of Phi Beta Kappaand ODK should be
forced to adapt self-selection. If they
refuse, throw ‘em off campus!” The
self-selection system never did, any-
way, Stop Or even minimize rejection,
since the students simply reverted to
social stigmatism and peer pressure to
keep the individuals they disliked from
joining their house. Even worse, and
it tried to minimize the rejection at the
cost of group bonding and cohesive-
ness. The fate of the eating houses it
spawned proves that fact.

The eating houses created by self-

selection proved inherently weak, ~

especially compared to fraternities.
Spencer conceptualized the eating
houses in 1970 as offering the same
“constructive functions” fraternities
did. He mentioned that eating houses
could offer the same leadership train-

ing and opportunities. While eat-
ing houses did require leadership,
they basically existed to feed their
membersand to hold some parties.
Fraternities, however, for the most
part had to deal with wider issues
and more complex requirements,
They had values to pursue, and
built organizational structures to
engage and excel in athletics, aca-
demics, and service, as well as to
provide eating services and an
active social schedule. Five things

that fraternities had that eating ~

houses did not push these goals.
First, there existed strong national
organizations that oversaw the
fraternities and gave them a set of
meaningful values and goals. The
national groups gave supportstaff,
materials, and training to the fra-
ternities, as wellas the opportunity
for leadership beyond the chapter
level. Second, friendly rivalries
between the groups helped then to
push for achievementand constant
betterment, especially when
awards and publicity directed that
rivalry towards scholarship, ath-
letics, and service. Third, the fra-
ternities held rush, which taught
and required valuable social skills
that benefited these men in the
business world. Fourth, the na-
tional nature of the fraternities gave
these men instant contacts all over
the country in business, higher
education, and socially. Lastly,
the fraternities instilled loyalty and
dedication through the close bonds
of friendship that lasted many
years. This proved important, for
those alumni gave valuable finan-

cial and advisor supportto thechap-
ter. The fraternity is one of the few
and is the most consistent places of
contact between the student body
and the graduates of the college.
Just ask the members of former
eating houses how many alumni
offered any advice, help, or sup-
port before those houses closed.
No eating house at Davidson up-
held the values, taught the skills,
held the recognition and prestige,
commanded the loyalty, or offered
the possibilities of fraternities.
Thecurrentsystem hasevolved
through practical experience and
with the lessons of the past, withan
eye on the ideals and intentions of
1970 but with feasibility in mind
as well. Spencer, although he
supported the concept of fraterni-
ties, disliked the fraternity system
with it’s exclusivity and intoler-
ance for others. However, the

system is no longer at fault, but -

rather a few individuals. The col-
lege is not supporting actions that
alienate and segregate, as the quick
and decisive actions of this year
have shown. It is standing, along
with the community (including the
fraternities), against intolerance.
Of course, Davidson and the fra-
ternity system are not perfect and
need improvement, but to elimi-
nate or badger the system evades
the real problems. Eating houses
perpetrate thealcohol problem just
as muchas fraternities, ifnot more
so due to the lack of pressure and
influence of alumni and national
organizations. If the college, the
faculty, and the press would move

decisively to work with the greek
system for real education and real
fraternal achievement and compe-
tition rather than hampering it, then
the fraternities of Patterson Court
could bring both themselves and
the entire college forward. The
fraternities must move in an equally
decisive manner forward to wards
the pursuit ofexcellence, however.

Those who ‘choose to exploit
the current situation to move for
the growth and extension of social
alternatives and possibilities will
help tosolve the kind of discontent
that brought about self -selection;
those, however, who move in or-
der to attack the greek system and
suggest a return to the original
conception of self selection ignore
history and it’s lessons, destroy the
future and its possibilities, and
moreover insult the attempts of all
who workcd to adapt the system to
reality.
