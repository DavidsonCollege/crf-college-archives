Resolved: That Davidson
College should adopt a ‘‘sex

After an hour of back-biting,
arm waving, open mouthed,
babbling harangue; the shrews
managed to defeat the galiant,
ungirded, knights of oratory in
a decision that was racked with
controversy —no one could un-
derstand why the decision was
not unanimous.

Basically the debate boiled
down to one important issue—/
what should be the goal of
Davidson College in its admis-
sion: policy? |

After citing current and re-
cent statistics on admissions,
Warren indicted the present
system of admissions claiming
that the arbitrary quotas set by
the trustees are ‘‘unjustified
and pernicious.’’ A goal was set
by the affirmative team of
admitting the best qualified
students of either sex.

A healthier social attitude
coupled witha stronger student
body academically were two
important advantages claimed
by the affirmative in their
policy proposition: The ‘arbit-
rary nature of the present
admissions policy was the deep-
seated. problem according to the
affirmative analysis.

tween college education and
career choice was presented by
the affirmative, shoring up their
position even further.

The negative did manage a
couple of good arguments.
Prappas questioned the compa-
tibility of balance and a healthy
social situation by pointing out
the pendulum could swing too
far in the other direction if too
many women were admitted,
thus raising a problem of inter-

nal coherence in the affirmative .

presentation.

Thompson also pointed out
the ‘‘unwritten credos’’ of
the trustees which are periodi-
cally handed down from Mount

Sinai for our further edification.
Behind the inherency consi-

derations and solvency analysis
lies a very important issue
facing the college; an issue that
demands attention, study, and
honesty; an issue that isn’t
simply. going to go away.
Debate and discussion is a
healthy mode of examination
and study.

Perhaps in light of the past
and in prospect for the future,
discussions like these, fun yet
thought provoking, will truly
become a part of the policy-ma-
king process at Davidson. Such
a goal can only further the
ideals of ‘the school and make
them truly relevant and appli-
cable.

Lou Reed blends jaz, ook

By ROBERT BOWIE
Staff Writer
“I do’ Lou Reed better than

‘anybody else.’’ This line, mut-”

tered by Reed himself some-
where amid the patter on his
new album Take No Prisoners,
says a lot about rock stars and
the public posturing that makes
up the American institution of
““celebrities’’. :

Like his mentor Andy War-
hol, Reed perfects the art of
““chit-chat’’ which lies at the
heart of this record.

Reed started out over ten:
years ago with a brilliant first
LP called The Velvet Under-
ground and Nico. Warhol pro-
duced the album and, with his
usual modesty signed his name
to the entire work.

Readers of the fine print on
the inside could discover that
Reed and a man by the name of

John Cale had written all the’
songs. Reed had freshly drop-

ped out of college; his lyrics
were filled with the light cyni-
cism of his teacher, the late
Delmore Schwartz.

Cale had the greater musical
background of the two; he had
studied under the prestigious
composer Jannis Xenekais and
has since gone on to record with
Terry Riley.

Together, they launched a
frontal attack on the seritimen-
tality of '60’s rock: Reed spat
out the words in a flat, unemo-
tional voice, while Cale .intro-
duced the atonality that makes
so much modern music sound
distressing to housewives and
other Philistines.

With the breakup of The
Velvet Underground, Reed lost
the group of musicians he had
learned to improvise with and
his records descended into the
drivel of the ‘‘average rock
record’’. ,

Transformer was largely the
work of producer David Bowie;
Rock and Roll Animal showed
Reed posing as an. obviously
fal e Frankenstein figure to sell
more records.

Sally Can't Dance reaches the
low point of being churned out
to fulfill a recording contract.
Reed had sold out and knew it.
Time had come to get ven-
geance on RCA and the hype
that had been handed out with
each concert.

Metal Machine Music comes
close to claiminf’the rare title of
the worst piece of music ever
recorded. As far as I can tell,

the whole thing consists of

He was soon relieved of his
RCA contract and the constant
demand to make another “‘hit”’.
Relocated at Arista, Reed set-

music the way he wanted to.

Davidson students will be

Southeast is only eighteen miles

gathering a flea market, how-
ever, is an injustice.

The jewelry is not all cheap,
though. One merchant dis-

deliberately destroy any ‘‘poetic

words.

Reed’s work at Arista is
closer to jazz than rock, and it is
inspiring for Reed to take such a

Unfortunately, Reed overdoes ~
his vocals in many places and
seems more concerned with
talking to the eur sige

One vendor specialized in

One striking characteristic of
