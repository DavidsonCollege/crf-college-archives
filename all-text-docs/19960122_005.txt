The former parsonage across
the street from the Davidson Col-
lege Presbyterian Church became
the newest addition to the housing
options at Davidson over winter
break.

Equipped with two porches, a
full size kitchen, a living room and
a generous amount of living space,
the “Manse” is being used only
this semester for those returning
from abroad who could not be
housed on campus.

In the past five years the num-
ber of students studying abroad
during the spring semester has been
greater than the returning students
from the fall. However, this year,
the tradition was broken when the
number of students leaving for the
spring was half of those returning,
leaving the Residence Life Office
facing a minor crisis.

On top of that, most of the
returning students were women,
causing additional problems find-
ing acceptable rooms. Kurt
Holmes, Director of RLO ex-
plained, “The only open real estate
that the College had access to was
the parsonage property.”

The déal with DCPC wasn’t

struck until December 31, when
the church decided that it would
move its four Sunday School
classes from the house and squeeze
them into the basement of the
church.

Instead paying rent on the
property, the College agreed to in-
vest money and have the house
fixed up so that it would be more
valuable to the church after the
students move out. “$14,000 has
been spent so far for rewiring and
upgrading electricity, fixing the
heating, ventilation and cooling
system, painting and changing
locks so that students would be
able to live there this spring,”
Holmes commented.

Holmes also admitted that the
College “was taking a good loss”
because the revenue from student’s
housing fees would not cover the
expenses for some of the work
done.

At the same time, he felt that
this was the best’solution for stu-
dents already living on campus
and for those returning.

In early December, RLO sug-
gested moving the male students
currently living on the first floor of
Akers to other empty rooms on
campus so that the returning girls
could then take those rooms. How-

ever, the RLO wanted them to move
during exams, and most of the stu-
dents living in Akers felt that the
arrangement was unfair.

To prevent future mishaps and

_ develop a policy concerning issues

such as these, the RLO has put
Debbie Young in charge of form-
ing a committee to address such

issues as who has more priority in
housing — those already living on
campus or those returning.
Holmes is optimistic that the
problems will be resolved before
next fall. The RLO is also consid-
ering building a new dormitory

-somewhere on campus to offer

more housing options..

Megan Driscoll, a junior liv-
ing in the house, says, “I feel as
though RLO has been very recep-
tive to the needs of the people in
the house.”

Gina Carlotti, another resident,
says, “I feel very lucky to have
gotten this housing when I was last
on the waiting list.”

Art historians off to the Louvre

As other students settle into
Davidson for the long haul, 13
students prepare for a semester
abroad with classes on campus for
three weeks.

The five sophomore and eight
junior Davidson students partici-
pating on the Art History trip to
France are living in various rooms
and lounges across campus for their
remaining weeks in the United
States.

As part of Art 372, 374, and
376, students prepare two 15-20
page papers: one on art in Paris
(done over Christmas break) and
one on art in the provinces (done

during the second: semester review
period).

“We had.a thesis and a bibli-
ography due January 1, and then
we had a 20 page paper due Janu-
ary 15,” said junior Amy
Clemmons. “It’s been a lot of
work, but the papers will help us
more fully understand and appre-
ciate the works we will see.”

Then the students are off for
ten weeks of study across the At-
lantic.

In the meantime, they iui
themselves scattered across cam-
pus, living wherever they can find
space. Some live in single rooms
left open by JYA’s, to lounges in
Martin Court F and down the hill.

Asked what he hoped to gain from
the trip; sophomore Christian
Durrett was left speechless.
Forhim, it promises to be more
than a vacation in the Mediterra-
nean. “It’s a really intensive trip,
but that’s the way I want it to be,”
said Durrett. But he was quick to
add, “Of course I’Il have some fun,

Rati why she chose to par-
ticipate on the program, junior Kate
Greene added, “I’ve always been
intrigued with France and enjoyed
Art History classes. I’m looking
forward to acquiring a greater un-
derstanding of the culture of a for-
eign country and to being com-
pletely thrown into the culture and

surviving.”

Though many:of the group of
thirteen will elect to leave France
soon after May first when the pro-
gram officially ends, several, like
Durrett, intend to remain in Eu-
rope to travel.

The trip will be led by Dr. C.
Shaw Smith, an Associate Profes-
sor of Art History and Humanities.
