THE DAVIDSONIAN

Tibetan Monks to
Perform, Speak as Part
of South Asia Week

By Dack Stackhouse

Harry Houdini used to do it -
sort of. He would escape from
safes by holding the necessary tools
in his throat, then bring them out
by contracting his neck muscles.
Tibetan Buddhist monks also strive
to escape by using their throats.
However, they seek to escape this
world of suffering by using their
vocal chords to sing sacred chants.
A monk trains for years, eventu-
ally developing the ability to per-
form polytonal chants, in which he
or she harmonizes with himself or
herself. Although the singing is

only one aspect of their practice, it
is, nevertheless, a very amazing
and important part.

At 7:00 in the 900 Room on
February 15, as part of both South
Asia Week and Solidarity Week, a
group of Tibetan monks from the

Gaden Shartse Monastery will be -

speaking about Tibetan culture and
giving a demonstration of “The
Awesome Voice.” No admission
will be charged, and it promises to
be a culturally enlightening.event.

The monks will talk about Ti-

walked around campus.

DAYTON, Ohio - Winter

Judith Allik, associate pro-

versity of Dayton, says the dark,
cold days of winter can result in
seasonal affective disorder (SAD).
SAD creates “a general sense of
malaise,” according to Allik, and
seems to'strike women more often

than men.

“January and Febriiary’c can be
really rough for some people,”
Allik said. “The symptoms don’t
vary from general depression.
You're apt to be lethargic. You’re
apt to sleep more than you usually
might. It might affect your appe-
tite - you might eat more carbohy-
drates.”

If you can *ttake a vacation to
a sunnier spot, Allik suggested
that exposure to bright lighting for
several hours a day can help re-
lieve symptoms. “Whenever there
is sun, gctoutside and expose your-
self to as much of it as you can.
Take a walk,” she advised.

Union Planning Committee Formed
McMillen to Head Group, Explore New Union Options

By Tom Koonce

Administration officials have
taken a small step towards build-
ing a new Union on the Davidson
campus. This past week Dean of
Students Will Terry asked twenty
people to serve on a Union Plan-
ning Committee. The committee
will be composed of mostly fac-
ulty and staff as well as some stu-
dents.

According to Terry, thecharge
of the committee “is to design a
pragmatic scheme for a college
Union outlining the specific spaces
and services needed for the Union

‘to accomplish its mission.” Terry

said the committee will look at the,
“needs of the Union in light of the
needs of the campus.”

History professor Sally
McMillen will chair this commit-
tee. She has experience with the
Union from serving on the Union
Board for the past four years.

The primary responsibility of
this committee is to update the
facilities programming for a new
College Union. This is a descrip-
tion of spaces and services needed
inanew Union. Suchalisting was
last drawn up in 1990 by a similar
planning commitice.

Union Director and member
of the committee William Brown
said that the committee will “take
what was written in 1990, update it
and make it a more accurate state-
ment of what Davidson needs or
wants.” Brown said that the com-

mittee will follow “a broadbased
process to hear from as many
people as possible.”

According to Terry the com-
mittee will bring in an outside con-
sultant and will do a lot of on-site
visits to other campuses in order to
come up with ideas for the new
Davidson Union. Brownsaid, “The
committee needs everybody’s par-
ticipation in the thought process.”

Terry hopes that the commit-
tee will have completed its-duties
by the end of May of this year. The
decision of whether or not to build
a new Union will be made by the
Facilities Planning Committee, the
Development Officeand ultimately
the President. .
