This week--we move-over—te-the-National League tot

preview spe prospects for the senior loop’s eighty con-
tenders. HJnlike the rival Americapggircyit there should
be only tWo real pennant threats, U®t With the Braves the
Phils, and the Pirates on the upsurge it’s rather hard to
determine how the also rans will finish. Without further
comment here’s the order in which we think they'll break
the tape:

Eddie Dyer’s St. Louis Cardinals who had to whip
3rooklyn in a post-season playoff to earn the right to re-
present the National League in the 1946 W orld s Series,
will win the flag with less effort this time. The Red Birds,
operating under new management last year, were initially
unnerved by the raids from south of the border which
definitely weakened their squad. Their case of jitters was
increased by an epidemic of sore arms which plagued a

number of the chunkers. In spite of these setbacks the]

spirited Cards came from behind to win.

This season, with the tension somewhat re-
laxed, the St: Louis—entry—will—show_its_oppon-
ents aclean pair of heels. Man for man the defend-
ing champs are superior in every department, due
largely to the yields of their extensive farm sys-
tem. Stan Musial, “Whitey” Kurowski, and Enos
Slaughter are on hand to supply the batting punch
while in Slats Marion and Terry Moore the Card
manager has two men who can scoop up grounders
and snag flies with the best in the majors. Add to
this the excellent mound corps headed by such
top notch performers as Murry Dickson, “The
Cat” Brecheen, and Howie Pollet and you have a
combination that just can’t miss.

BUMS SECOND
Gloom will hang heavy over Ebbetts Field when the
coming baseball season draws to a close for once again tht
rabid Brooklyn rooters will have to be content with sec-
ond slot, and in eur that ain't good. The beloved
Bums have a rare mfXture of age dnd youth on their
roster — the type of club which has always responded to
the urgings of fiery, umpire baiting Leo Durocher. Never-
theless, the Dodgers do not have enough real talent to in-
sure a. victory this year. The inner works should be
strengthened defensively by the return of the veteran Ar-
ky Vaughan but except for the aging Dixie Walker and
perhaps Pete’ Reiser (victim of a slump-in ’46) there
are no hitters who can consistently blast in the runs. Some
of “Lippy Leo’s” pitching mainstays are also somewhat
ancient but judging from their records none of them are
quite ready for the wheelchair. Fireballer Johnny Van
Cuyk, an 18 game winner for Fort Worth last summer,
should be a welcomed addition to that department.
Thé rejuvenated Boston Braves will press the
Brooks all the way. Most of the credit for the
rapid rise of this once lowly club must go to
peppy, shrewed Billy Southworth who has in-
stilled in his charges new fight and determina-
tion, and to owner Bob Quinn who has gone all
out to supply his manager with good material. If
the former Card’skipper could count on more hits
by his infielders he might threaten St. Louis, but
he'll have to be content with smooth fielding
by those worthies. In the outfield Southworth
has three fence busters-in Hopp, Holmes, and
Carvel. Johnny Sain, Ed Wright, Mort Cooper, and
Bill Lee are quite capable of bearing the brunt
of the hill chores.

CUBS FUTURE UNCERTAIN

Fourth place is reserved for Charli¢ Grimm’s Chicago
Cubs if a few of the Bruins regain their stride. Bill
Nicholson is the key to the success of the club. In 1946
“Big Bill’s average tumbled to .220 and he managed to
belt only 8 homers. If he begins to hit again, and if Clar-
ence Maddern, rookie up from Tulsa, can slam the ball
to the tune of .300 or better, the Cubs will have a trio
of fine outer-gardners. ‘‘Ace” Parker, ex Duke football
great, is a candidate for a post in an infield steadied by
the veteran campaigner, Stan Hack. Another question
mark is the pitching staff. If Wyse, Borowy, and Schmitz
improve, the Bruins might be able to move up the ladder.

PHILS TOP BUCS

Philadelphia and Pittsburgh will battle for the top. berth
in the second division. It will be close but the Quarker
City lads should emerge victorious; Ben Chapman, who
led his squad from the depths last season, has a dashing
club, headed by the sensational Del Ennis, 1946. rookie
of the year and the cagey “Schoolboy” Rowe, who won
11 games in 15 starts. The Pirates, under new ownership,
are also on the make. Billy Herman, making his debut as
a major league manager, will cause trouble, but this is
not the Buc’s year Hank Greenberg should prove to be a
valuable asset but no miracles can be expected until some
new hurlers are obtained.

The impotent Reds and Gaints will again fall heir to the
seventh and eighth places, Neither aggregation can.boost of
an offense although the New Yorkers have a pair of dis-
tance hitters in backstops Walker Cooper and Hank Dan-
ning. The Redlegs chief forte is their pitching staff head-
ed up by such battleworn chunkers as Bucky Walters,
Johnny Vander Meet, Ewell Blackwell and Joe Beggs The
contributions of this quartet plus the work of Cincinnati’s
fine. defensive infield should enable them to shade

THE DAVIDSONIAN

Friday, March 28, 1947

Jack Burris, hard-hitting Wildcat centerfielder, crosses the plate
Southern Conference game with Duke’s Blue Devils. Burris blasted a 350 foot homer in a
double and a single. In the background is Bert Anderton, Wildcat third base coach.

Three Tied For
Volleyball Lead

Inter-fraternity volleyball rolled
into high gear last week with the
first three being played.
Emerging on top of the 15 game
spree were three undefeated nines,
Phi Gams, Phi Delts, and Kappa
Sigs, with three wins each. The
S. P. E.’s and S. A. E.’s pressed
close behind with two victories and
one loss, Tied up for the third slot
were K. A. and Beta with one and
two. The Independents, Pikas, and
Pi Kaps found themselves at the
bottom of the heap with three losses

rounds

and no wins. 4
Big Three Establish Lead

Action started Monday, March
17, with the “Big 38” establishing
their early lead. The Phi Gams
beat K. A., Betas trimmed Inde-
pendents, Kappa Sigs trounced Pi
Kaps, the Phi Delts downed S. A.
E., and the S. P. E.’s defeated the
Pikas.

In the second round the Pikas
took another licking, this time from
the K. A.’s. The Independents
dropped theirs to the Phi Gams,
while the Betas were bowled over
by the Sigmas. The S. A. E.’s eased
out the S. P. E.’s andthe Phi Delts
bested the Pi Kaps.

Round three put the top teams
definitely in front. The Phi Gams
kept their record clean by dumping
the Pi Kaps. The Kappa Sigs
stayed up top at the expense of the
Independents, and the Phi Delts
did the same to. the Betas. The
S. A. E.’s bumped the K, A.’s and
the S. A. E.'s stayed in the run-
ning with a win over the Pi Kaps.

To Duke Bluz Devils, 13 - 7

Last Monday, Duke's potentially great baseball team defeated
an equally promising Davidson nine by a 13-7 score.
the case in many. past Davidson-Duke games, the contest was much

Lose

As has been

The game started off with a bang
—Duke scored two runs in their
half of the first inning, but the
Cats came back to tie the score
in the second frame. The Blue
Devils’ went out in front to stay in
the third rack although the locals
were never really counted out of
the scrap until the top of the ninth
when the-visitors pushed over four
tallies.

By the time that this column
appears in print, the actual statis-
tics will be known to all and sun-
dry. However, we feel that there
are certain phases of the game
which merit added comment. Per-
haps the biggest surprise to the
average Wildcat fan was the hit-
ting of little publiczed centeirfield-,
er, Jack Burris, who touched Coach
Jack Coomb’s hurlers for a homer,
a double, and a single. In addition
to his work with the stick, he also
performed well afield.

In spite of a number of glaring
errors (some of which were appar-
ently caused by the poorly graded
infield) the entire Davidson inner
works showed up fairly well in the
season’s opener. Jake Wade, who
replaced the Riling Jimmy French,
Charlie Pierson, and Bill Bird,
turned in some sparkling defensive
plays. When the ’Cats get a few
more games under their belts,
Coach Jamerson should have one of
the strongest defensive combines
in the Southern Conference.

In addition to Burris, Captain
“Pop” Bowman and Carl Shepperd
played well in the outer garden.
The former, the leading hitter for
the ’46 Davidson nine, added a solid
single to the locals’ offensive while
the latter made several great
catches in deep left.

Norm Whiteheart started on the
mound for the ’Cats and was re-
lieved in the seventh by Malcolm
Earp. Hal Mapes and Buddy Chan-
dler handled the catching chores.

Story Primes

Those who have seen proselytes
of Wild Bill “The Hook” Story’s
favorite sport out tossing the pig-
skin around these last few days
have seen but a preview of the com-
ing Spring practice. Beginning
April 8, the second “spring” prac-
tice will last three weeks. The
huskies working out daily in bright
red jerseys and white shorts are
more or_less keeping in-shape for
the coming gridiron skirmishing.

On March 8, thé first three-week
spring practice ended with an in-
tersquad scrimmage. Doing the
heavy work in the line faithfully
were Ernie Strictlin, Bob- Sharpe,

the Giants.

PERRY VS. LUFLER

Fred Perry, former national
professional champ, may appear
in an exhibition match against
tennis coach Bill Lufler Mon-
day. The English born Perry is
playing in Greensboro Saturday
and can be induced to come to
Davidson provided a_ proper
guarantee is offered. Lufler
has just returned from St. Pet-
ersburg, Florida, where he was
resident pro at the St. Pete
Country Club for the winter sea-
son. The two men have met
many times before on the pro
tennis circuit. A sterling per-
formance is promised by these
racket wielders if sufficient
funds can be offered to the tour-
ing Perry:

Cat Marksmen
Down Clemson

Davidson's keen-eyed riflemen
victoriously invaded Clemson Col-
lege’s campus last Saturday, to take
a shoulder to shoulder small bore
match by a score of 880 to 828.

Coffey High Man

High man for the Wildcats was
steady-nerved Don Coffey, who
made a 40 in the krteeling position
to earn a total of 184 points.

A. M. Rankin was second with
182 points of which 50 was made
in the prone position-and-40-in-the
difficult standing position. Both
of these tallies were high for the
meet.

P. M. Brown with 177 points, D.
P. Deaton, with 169 points,/ and
Charly Maxwell with 168 points,
(50 of them made in the sitting
position) rounded out the high
point men for the victors.

For Clemson, Gumby shot a 170,
Cornetti a 169, Harris a 165, Puss-
ley a 162 and Davis a 162.

Ping Pong, Pool
Touinaments Set

By Charles Elyea

Charles Elyea of the Y. M. C. A.
cabinet announces several Y spon-
sored ping-pong tournaments to be
held shortly after Spring holidays
in the Y. There will be a singles
and a doubles tournament in ping-
pong, a singles tournament in
French pool and a doubles tourna-
ment in eight ball. Although the
actual playing of the tournaments
will not begin until April 8th, after
Spring holidays, Umpire Elyea asks
all entrees to register before the
holidays. Bob Berry and Ben Gib-
son will assist Elyea with the pool
games and Clayton Carpenter will
help oversee the ping-pong tilts.

The tournaments will be played
in the Y. All Davidson students
are eligible. Rules will be posted
in the game rooms. In the initial
games, winners will be determined
by three out of five games in ping-
pong and by two out of three games
in pool. Prizes will be given to
the winners.

Elyea also added that the Y
equipment is to be greatly improved
before the tournaments,

PASTEURIZED
GRADE “A” MILK

Mooresville
Co-Operative

The Red and Blacks have matches
with some of the crack tennis teams
in the country including Kalama-
z00, Yale, and*Colgate to be played
on the home courts and travel far
afield to take on Vanderbilt, North
Carolina, and N. Y. U. On Thurs-
day, April 17, Duke comes to the
Davidson campus to take part in
the ceremonies surrounding the
dedicating of the new courts. All
told, 20 matches are to be played,
6 of which are going to be uphill
grinds, but Bill Lufler is hoping
to come through the season with
at least 16 wins.
Two Lettermen Return

Building his team around four
crack players, Coach Lufler has
the material out of which may come
the victories he seeks. Two letter-
men from last year’s squad, Buck
Archer and Jerry Robinson, will be
joined by Bo Roddey and Ted Kees-
ler. The last two men on the play-
ing team will probably be drawn
from either Don Hatch, Whit Cobb,
Glenn Turpin, or Lenoir Keesler,
But Coach Lufler has assured your
scribe that he hopes to see every
man on the squad wielding rackets
during the season. Those rounding
out the team are Mike Williams,
Allen Fanjoy, Johnny Walker,
Henry Neisler, and Rod Palmer.

Although the usual procedure in
a match is to play five singles
games and two doubles, the team
this year will be playing 6 singles
and 8 doubles matches against their
opponents. In each case, two sets
out of three have to be won before
a man or a doubles team can claim
a victory. ' Each match counts 1
point, making 9 points the maxi-
mum number the team can attain,
with 5 needed to win.

As-everyone-on the campus-had
undoubtedly noticed, Coach Lufler
will be putting his’ boys through

‘| practices on new $1500 courts which

ought to improve their play consid-
erably. With the addition of bleach-
ers and green canvas at the backs
and ends of the courts, the Wildcats
will have a new arena in which to
test their claws.

Probably the. highest hurdles to
be gotten over will be the matches
with Kalamazoo and Yale. The
Michigan -college apparently has 5
or 6 teams all told which it scat-
ters over the country to bring fame
back to their campus. Last year
they were the country’s intercol-
legiate champions. Yale also is
stacked with some of the U. S’s
crack tennis stars. The matches
with the New Haven boys which
will be played here are only for
practice, but when the Wildcats
travel north near the end of April,
they will be playing for keeps,

As you know, Davidson roared
through last year’s season without
a loss, but this spring a schedule
has been made out which would try
the mettle of any team in the coun-
try. But in spite of this Coach
Lufler fully expects to have a high-
ly successful season. For once the

talent for accomplishing just that
is on hand.
