Again: Delayed Rush

With an exchange of sighs and
cynical comments fraternity men will
fill out another poll next week. This
one deals with an old. and perhaps
tired issue, at that: delayed rush.

This topic still has an amazing
vitality. After last year's bold stand
by the combined fraternity presidents
strengthening pledge regulations. the
faculty removed the spectre of Sopho-
more Rush which haunted fraternity
court for months.

Now, however, new demands are
being heard. The superficialities and
insincerities of our early rush system
are under scrutiny by the IFC, and by:
the fraternity presidents. This time
there is no faculty pressure. direct or
indirect. But if enough student opin-
ion can be mustered in favor of some
form of detayed rush, a new vitality
might appear around fraternity court.

The .evils of the present. system
are many: fraternities are forced to
give an inaccurate picture of them.
Selves in order to attract freshmen.
The importance of fraternities is too
often overrated. but brand-new fresh-
men can't see this. In one hectic week
fraternities cannot get to know their
choice rushees: the Rush Week Veneer .
is worn by all parties.

We favor rush at the beginning
of second semester. The advantages
inherent in such a system have been
heard before. Without a whole year’s
worth of disadvantages to hinder ‘ac-
ceptance of delayed rush, we are hop-
ing fraternities will see the need to
install a new system. .

Many can find disadvantages in
second semester rush. The problem
of the first semester moratorium is
the toughest. Two objections are al-
Ways uppermost: what about freshman
social life. and what about dirty rush?

On the problem of social life: ex-
cept for a few blind dates and an oc:
casional ride. what does a fraternity
give its pledges during the first semes-
ter? We would like to see more ex-
change dances, sponsored by the
Union and even the Freshman Coun-
cil. Provision could perhaps be made
for freshmen to keep cars on campus
over weekends. Although last year’s
plans for enlarged Union facilities
were sometimes derided, we feel that
for one semester the freshmen could
have a profitable social life independ-
ent of fraternity membership.

Martin Tries Again

In student assembly Monday
morning President Martin will resume
the practice he started last year: he
will hold a question-and-answer ses-
sion with students. Many had wonder-
ed if the open interview would be con-
tinued this year.

The delay occurred because in
many ways last year's sessions were
unsatisfactory. Although the idea was
good, it was almost worked to death.
Students ran out of questions, and
President Martin got tired of answer-
ing the same questions over and over
again. ‘sg

If students respond to. Monday's
opportunity, the practice will undoubt-
edly be continued, perhaps once more
this semester, and twice next semes-
ter. And the opportunity is great. It
is a chance to air definite controver-
sies, clear up misunderstandings, and
put the administration on the spot
about its policies, without getting per-
sonalities and pettiness injected.

Although President Martin re-
portedly looks forward to the sessions
with fear and trembling, he is to be
commended for consenting to resume
the practice. We expect interested
studets to question him on such sub-
jects as the dance-weekend pledge,
Executive Committee action on the
Honor System, the immediate goals of
the new 15-year plan.

The problem of dirty rush is
stickier..On a small campus such as
ours, where most fraternity men know
each other, and where most rivalries
are taken out on the flickerball field,
the bitterness between groups is
usually kept to a minimum. Would
jealousies and backbiting break out on
Patterson Court? It would take
time, perhaps. to overcome the petty
intrigues that characterize our pres-
ent rush system. But fraternity men
would eventually realize that actions
speak louder than words, especially in
the “intimate” arena that is Davidson.

Each fraternity would be per-
mitted to hold a limited number of
open houses during the semester. In
addition each fraternity would be, al-
lowed to invite a select group of
rushees to off-campus parties, perhaps
at a fee uniform for all fraternities.
Fraternities would not be allowed to
feed freshmen in fraternity houses.
except by special permission. But
there would be no way to prevent the
casual “dropping in to watch TV” on
the part of freshmen.

Enforcement of whatever rush
regulations are necessary should be
left up to the fraternity presidents,
the IFC, and perhaps to the Freshman
Council; for dirty rush hurts the
rushee as well as the fraternity. No
freshman should be rushed to the
point of expecting a bid when the
fraternity as a whole is not interested
in him. The fraternities know this,
and the Freshman Council might be
an effective voice to calculate fresh-
man feeling.

Rush dates could be sent out the
last week in the first semester, and
only those freshmen with ‘'C” aver-
ages would be eligible for rush. Two,
or at: most three nights of parties
would suffice to “get serious” with
select groups of rushees. Pledging
would take place in the middle of the
first week of second semester. An
accelerated pledge program could
have pledges ready for initiation by
the middle of April, at the latest.

Here, then. are our suggestions.
The student body is tired of hearing
about delayed rush. But we need a
change in our too-hasty, insincere rush
program. We think second semester
rush is the best answer.

D. B.S.

Discussion of these issues is im-
portant. When they can be talked
about in a calm, impersonal manner by
the key figure in the administration,
no better opportunity exists for the
student body to seek clarification on
vital campus matters.

Welcome

As sure as November brings
autumn colors, Thanksgiving, and the
ROTC turkey shoot, it finds almost
270 freshmen awaiting the annual
parents’ day. Maybe it’s the autumn
melancholy the Romantic poets used
to write about; maybe it’s just being
away from home for two months for
the first time; but we’ve always notic-
ed that there’s hardly a freshman who
doesn’t look forward to having the
folks down for Freshman Parents’
Day. Even mature college men are
just a little bit anxious to show off
their new environment and to reas-
on Mom that everything is really

_ Well, the campus is still wearin
its sporty fall togs. The freshman
dorms are all clean and waiting. Wel-
come. freshman parents — your boys
are glad to see you.

Cafeteria Evaluated;
Students Criticize Line

The David Ovens College
Union, site of cinema and Slater
System. will have a $150,000
portion of. the new 15-year fi-
nancial drive.

at, at present. are its
needs; especially in the oft-
commented-on cafeteria? Even
more, what are its present
main faults. in connection with
these neéds, as seen by the
students?

Food quality is no longer the
most. verbalized of the present
faults. Typical freshman feel-

ing seemed to be represented
by the statement of the cafeter-
ia doing a “fairly good job”
even though most of them quali-
fied by saying that. they could
not, of course, compete with the
fraternity boarding systems that
allow more specialization. The
main freshman complaint was
that the breakfasts are not kept
warm.

IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS

A Fickle Fellow,
To Say The Least

The most widely used text-
book for college economic stud-
ents is “Economics, An Intro-
ductory Analysis.” familiar to
Davidson veterans of Economic
21-22.

The author is Prof. Paul A.
Samuelson of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology. He also
is president of the American
Economics Association. Here are
extracts from successive edi-
tions:

First and second editions,
1948 and 1951: “If price increas-
es could be held down to. say,
less than 5 per cent per year.
such a mild steady infiation
need not cause too great con-
cern...”

Third edition, 1955: “If price
increases could be held down to,
say, less than 3 per cent per
year, such a mild steady infla-

tion need not cause too great
concern...” ,

Fourth edition, 1958: "If price
increases could be held down to,
say. 2 per cent per year, such a
mild steady inflation need not
cause too great concern... "

Fifth edition, 1961: “Price in-
creases that could be held down
below 2 per cent per year are
one thing. But...”

And on the TV program Meet
the Press. March 1961: “ ... if
we can hold things down so that
the official index of prices goes
up by no more than 1.5 or 2
per cent, I shall be very con-
tent.”

Some people hope the profes-
sor will keep on talking and
that his book will go through
many more editions.

is being made. In fact, to sup-
plement this effort, the Union
meal ticket now costs $200 per
semester, an increase of $.02 per
meal.

Lack of adequate facilities
was the direct, or indirect, cause
of most of the complaints level-
ed. It is obvious to even the
most casual visitor that the
tables are crowded together.
This was, in essense, the main-
spring of a freshman’s sugges:
tion of “another main thorough-
fare’ for student entrance and
exit to the Union than via the
eating area.

MEAL LINE CRITICIZED

Students were most sensitive
on the factor of waiting in line.
Although most acknowledged
the trouble of setting up a tem-
porary line, many criticized the
cafeteria ior not tnstituting a
second one sooner when needed.

The lack of a permanent sec-
ond line to speed things up was
mentioned especially by stud-
ents who have had to rush from
fourth period classes to eat, and
then to a lab or fifth period
class.

The granted slowness of the
line, which also results from a
want of kitchen equipment, add-
ed to the frequency with which
athletic teams are allowed to
brqak in front on weekends, has
raised several angry queries as
to whom service is due first.

It should be mentioned here,
though, that the cafeteria has
definite plans to correct many
of the above physical inad-
equacies along with the general
enlarging, improving, and re-

arranging which will be conr -

pleted if the funds of the 15-
year program are secured.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Students Discuss Chapel Talk, .
Dance Weekend Saturdays

Durham

Dear Editor:

Upon reading the articles and
editorial in last week's DAVID-
SONIAN regarding academic-
scheduling. 1 was immediately
struck by the fact that no men-
tion was made of the Saturdays
during Midwinter's and Spring
Frolics Weekends. Having at-
tended Saturday classes during
these dance weekends for the
past two years, it has been my
feeling that generally students
are neither particularly eager
nor well prepared to attend the
classes on these days.

This causes one to wonder
just how much is accomplished
in these classes and if they are
really worth continuing under
the present circumstances.

Among the possiole solutions
to remedy this situation might
be either to continue the classes
and break down and distribute
the dance weekends on the Sat-
urdays throughout the semester
or to make the Saturdays of
dance weekends holidays.

Of course the present situa-
tion does have its advantages;
holding classes on these two
Saturdays adds to the total num-

ber of class days per semester
and at the same time does not
adversely affect the students or
professors.

Rodger Durham

Edgar
Dear Editor:

According to Professor Goody:
koontz we do not have to make
a choice between being dead
or red. Rather, the choice is
between life and death.

I agree with the professor in
that the first choice, “red or
dead,” need not be made. There
is no reason why we should be
red or dead. I also value my
life, but I believe that the way
to save that life is to be found
in some positive Goldwater-type
vim, vigor, and vitality in our
foreign policy, rather than giv-

ing all up for lost and accept-
ing defeat at the outset.

if we acquiesce, we will
surely all be red, and most
probably a lot of us will be
dead too (if not as a result of
the bomb, then by execution for
crimes against the state.)

We must not let the crashing
of bombs drive us into a state
of panic. We must not spend
our time trying to find a scape-
goat in a poor little ol’ Senator
from Arizona.

Let's choose to save our skins
by calling the big Russian bluff
with our own nuclear strength,
for which Mr. K has due re-
spect. Let's choose life; life
that affords us something that
many overlook in these trying
days — liberty.

Khrushchev Given Reason
To Regret Parthenon Error

BY COSTAS STATHOS

Who could ever imagine that the Parthenon could
fight Communism? And yet, it did!

We usually say that the classical world lies far back
in the past, aiid for all of us it is something quite inani-
mate. This picture, however, is bound to turn upside down
if we consider the following facts:

August 1961: In a feverish speech in Moscow Premier
Khrushchev declares: “... we will destroy all Greece and
the Parthenon too if... etc.”

This is a historical phrase. It was just a threat, no
doubt But it proved to be quite a heavy blow on the face
of the orator himself. How?

October 29, 1961: Slections in Greece. The Free
Popular vote—a thing that sounds Greek to Mr. Khrush-
chev—pushed the National Radical Union (right wing)
ahead. Then followed the Union of the Center (a coalition
of the “prodigal sons” of politics, who are destined—who
knows by what mysterious forces—to play the role of a
foil) and lastly the Pan-Democratic Agrarian Front (ac-
tually the Communist party under a mask).

It was reported that the left wing party lost a great
deal of its power.

The carrier of Kremlin’s principles—if they may be
called so—the peace loving party—that proved its lust
for peace in the years after the German occupation by ,
throat cutting—lost its prestige.

This happened chiefly because Khrushchev made
that pitiful mistake. God biess him!

Some simple pieces of white marble to have such
influence on political affairs; unbelievable!

This at first seems illogical. But the key is that the
Parthenon does not represent merely an idea. It is an
integral part of Greek life.

It would not seem so far-fetched if we say that
Greeks cannot do without the Parthenon just as Ameri-
cans cannot do without .. . the dollar.

Now, how can we compromise these two things, the
Parthenon and the Dollar. The Spirit and the Matter?

It is because the Parthenon for the Greeks is at the
same time a dollar-making machine.

Just think of the increasingly rising touristic move-

ment—mainly based on the object of Mr. Khrushchev's

menace—which lately tends to overcast all other sources
of national income.

So the threat was double. But his expectations went
with the wind.

Let us hope that he will draw a useful lesson out
of it and that he will hold his tongue from now on.

O.K. take it easy Mr. Khrushchev!
Drink your vodka and let us alone!
