resisters are obtained by matching Se-
lective Service registation lists with So-
cial Security Administration files. IRS
then mails the letters. The first mailing
has been sent to 33,000 men. Roscoe L.
Egger Jr., Commissioner of IRS, has
said IRS only plans to turn over 200 ad-
dresses to Selective Service out of those
who don’t respond to the warning letter
because it seems unlikely the Justice
Department would prosecute more than
that number.

“People who receive these letters,
or have questions concerning non-regis-
tration clearly need more information
which CCCO can give them,” attorney
Feldman said. CCCO:has started a list
of persons interested in non-registration
issues, to which the organization sends
out regular bulletins on developments in
the area of non-registration. According
to the General Accounting Office, over
700,000 men have not registered. “We

believe many are refusing to sign up as a
protest to war and American milita-
rism,” Feldman said. .

At this time the federal government
has indicted only eight people for refus-
al to register. The government is cur-

rently only charging non-registrants’

who have turned themselves in, as the
eight above. Warning letters from the
Justice Department have been sent to
some non-registants turned in to the go-
vernment by private individuals :

The Central Committee for Con-—

scientious Objectors ws formed in 1948
and has a network of 2,500 counselors
around the country who counsel indi-
viduals on the draft, registration, and
conscientious objection. CCCO also
helps people in the military who are
looking for discharges and does pre-en-
listment counseling, telling people con-
sidering the military the other side of the
story from that which is given in the re-
cuitment ads.

Ratliff Elected
toBread Board

Charles E. Ratliff Jr., a long-time
social activist, chairman of the econom-
ics department at Davidson College,
was elected Tuesday to the board of di-
rectors of Bread for the World, a Chris-
tian citizens’ movement which lobbies
Congress for legislation to reduce world
poverty.

As one of the 42 board members,
Ratliff will help direct the action of the
group’s 36,000 members. Local chap-
ters, including-one in Charlotte and an
affiliate group in Davidson, meet

‘monthly to educate members to human

needs, government policy and to plan
letter writing and telephone lobbying

campaigns directed toward congress- .

.. 34

men.
“U.S. government foreign aid poli-
cies are primarily determined by stra-
tegic and economic interests,” Ratliff
said. He explained -that Bread for the
World is working to change that through
its current sponsorship of the Hunger
and Global Security bill.

Last year it won passage of a bill
which enacted a four-million-ton emer-
gency wheat reserve, as well as emer-
gency food aid to Cambodia, East Afri-
ca, and other countries.

“It’s in the self-interest of the United

States to work to eliminate world
hunger because it’s a military and eco-
nomic threat to our domestic security,”
said Ratliff. “American people strongly
support private relief efforts such as
CARE, OXFAM and church projects,
but the government has a miserable re-
cord of aid to poor nations.”

Ratliff’s involvement with Bread
for the World dates back to its founding
by its current executive director, Arthur
Simon, in the early 1970s.

Ratliff had recently returned from
spending two years in Pakistan, a coun-
try where two-thirds of the citizens suf-
fer from protein deficiency, where he
served with the United Methodist Board
of Global Ministries. His work there in-
cluded teaching economics at Forman
Christian College and participating in
rural development projects.

“I came back to this country very
aware of the need for action to eliminate
hunger not only by church groups, but
through the public sector as well,” he
said. .

Ratliff graduated from Davidson in
1947 and began teaching here the same
year. He later earned A.M. and Ph.D.
degrees from Duke University. A 1971
“Outstanding Educator of America,” he
received Davidson’s top teaching prize,
the Thomas Jefferson Award, in 1972.
He has published several books on taxes
and public finance, and scores of arti-
cles for trade journals. His name is in-
cluded in “Who’s Who in America,”
“Who’s Who in the World,” “American
Men of Science,” and “Contemporary
Authors.”
