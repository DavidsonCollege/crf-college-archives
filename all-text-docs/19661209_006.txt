hear one side. The conservative
businessmen who make up the
chamber’s backbone apptauded
loudly at Romney's allusions to
weakening of the democratic
system of government and Jeop-
ardizing private institutions and
human liberty.

As he got uway from emo fon
and into specific proposals, the
audience cooled somewhat,

First, he said, ‘'we must cor-
reat an imbalance in out nation-
al tax structure which  short-
changes state and lacal govern
ments, They’re running out of
money.”

High national taxes make any
increnge in ‘local taxation bm
porsible, he xmid.

Sceond, “we must madernize |

must be modernized within a
framework of strong local salf-
government. Locn? governmenis
must especially be urged vw con-
solidate where necessary and
to solve area-wide problems

rangements.”

Roumey’s talk to the ¢hamber
was oslunsibly non-pollticnl, but
there was no pretense of mak-
ing his GOP talk so,

“The Novomber — elections
prove the disillusionment with
gung-ho laws that don’t get re-
sults. They givo the Republican
Party a tremendous opportunity
to prove itself.”
