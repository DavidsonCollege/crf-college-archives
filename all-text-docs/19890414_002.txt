Anywhere from 300,000 to 600,000 protesters converge on capital

By TRENT STEVENS '

Davidson students were among
the hundreds of thousands of ac-
tivists who demonstrated on the
streets of the nation’s capital last
Sunday in the “March for
Women’s Equality, Women’s
Lives.” Organized by the National
Organization for Women (NOW),
the march brought anywhere from
300,000 to over 600,000 marchers
in support of both the Equal Rights
Amendment (ERA) and the right
of women to have a legal abortion.

Seven Davidson College stu-
dents, six female and one male,
joined 177 other pro-choice activ-
ists in four buses for a journey
which started shortly after mid-
night on Sunday from the Char-
lotte Planned Parenthood parking

lot. Almost 11 hours later, the
caravan pulled into the parking lot
of the Pentagon.

The gromp soon reached
Constitution A venue, a focal point
of the march. “All the streets were
filled from side to side with people
marching up (to the Capitol Build-
ing),” said senior Camille Cooper.
“It felt as if a million people were
there,” she added.

Junior Leigh Hall reported that
approximately 40 anti-abortion
demonstrators attempted to block
the road near the Washington
Monument, the starting point of
the march. It “was like trying to
hold back a flood with a garbage
can lid,” she commented.

The marchers were a diverse
group, in both their backgrounds

and their methods of expressing
their views. “It was such a cross-
cut of the American public,” stated
Hall, who also observed the ban-
ner of a woman who was a con-
fessed atheist: “Keep your church
out of my crotch.”

Other signs bore such slogans as
“Keep Abortion Legal” and “Preg-
nant and Pro-Choice,” in addition
to symbols such as the coat hanger,
an object used in performing abor-
tions during the days before they
became legal.

Whoopi Goldberg, one of sev-
eral celebrity activists who spoke
to the crowd, was quoted as say-
ing, “Hangers as an alternative are
wrong.”

bus who had been working to-

ROTC blood letting yields163 pints

Red Cross staff discounts AIDS rumor

By DAVID SCOTT
and MUADI MUKENGE

Davidson students and faculty
contributed a total of 163 pints of
blood last week during the semi-
annual Red Cross blood drive, sur-
passing the goal of 150 set by
Davidson ROTC, the Sponsoring
organization.

ROTC cadets helped Red Cross
staff set up a temporary donor sta-
tion in the Union while students
and volunteers manned blood
pressure machines, filled out
forms and passed out cookies.
Members of the Davidson Emer-
gency Rescue Service and volun-
teers from the community aided
the effort.

According to Red Cross nurse
Patty Howell, people should not be
apprehensive about giving blood.
It does not cause extreme pain and
donors are replenished with or-
ange juice and cookies, she said.
“After you’ve given a few times,
you can hardly tell any difference

when you’re finished.”

The Red Cross needs blood. The
Carolina Region of the Red Cross,
which is based in Charlotte, must
take inan average of 1,200 pints of
blood per day. Eleven bloodmo-
biles are sent out every day to sites
including colleges, and the re-
gional headquarters in Charlotte
takes donations during all business
hours. :

Red Cross officials were asked
about rumors circulating around
campus which say that three
Davidson students tested positive
for the AIDS HIV virus after tests
of fall blood drive samples. Offi-
cials were confident that the ru-
mors could not possibly be true.

Dick Larkins, lead volunteer for
the blood drive, responded. “You
will hear all kinds of wild stories
like that.” Larkins stressed that
there is no way he, the nurses nor
the public could possess that
data—whether or not it is true.

About 5 percent of all blood

received is destroyed, said Lark-
ins. The causes are largely due to
the presence of diseases such as
hepatitis and syphilis rather than
the HIV virus, he added.

All blood samples are sent to the
Charlotte lab for testing, said

‘Larkins. Anyone whose sample

repeatedly tests positive for the
HIV virus is notified individually
by mail. According to Larkins,
only the Charlotte lab’s chief oper-
ating officer, Jerry: Squires,‘ and

‘ medical director Paul Jennercould

possibly know who tests positive.

The organization is not author-
ized to release information as to
whether or not anyone received a
notification letter, says Red Cross
public relations director Debbie
Slappey. “That is purely confiden-
tial information,” she stressed.

“The important thing is that stu-
dents need to know for sure that it
is still a fact that you cannot get
AIDS from donating blood,” Slap-
pey added.

wards a march like this for 25
years,” said senior Mibs Raney.
“There were groups that I have
never even heard of before.”
Some of the marchers were men.
“My main reason for going was

. to find out more about the move-

ment,” said senior Jeff Muir, the
only male activist from Davidson
to attend the march. “It is not just
something that affects just
women,” he said of abortion, “it
affects everyone.”

Political science professor Mary
Thornberry also went to the site of
the march. “A march is obviously
designed to do a number of
things,” she said, citing the effect
that such a march has on lawmak-
ers and the reinforcing effect it has
on other supporters of a cause.

Despite the diversity of the pro-
choice crowd, they were all
marching for the same central
causes. Of primary concern to
many was the upcoming Supreme
Court trial involving a Missouri
abortion law. It is possible that the
Supreme Court’s decision in this
trial may lead to areversal of all or

- part of the 1973 Supreme Court

decision in the Roe vs. Wade trial,
which led to the legalization of
abortion in the United States.

“I believe that the woman
should have the right to choose,”
said senior Sheri Reynolds. “I
won’t deny that I had a great time
(at the march), but I think that it
was asinine that I had to march for

added that the abortion issue is “an
issue of control.”

“T think they’re playing emo-
tional hardball,’Raney said of the /
pro-life activists. “I think the pro- ©
lifers are trying to make it a good ©
vs. evil decision and it’s not as
simple as that,” she said.

Muir said that pro-lifers “have
some valid points in the sense that
abortion is taking life.” However,
he disagreed with what he feels are
pro-lifers’ misconceptions that
women use abortion as a kind of
birth control.

“Whose life is more important:
the woman or the child?” he asked.
He referred to pro-lifer threats and
bombings of abortion clinics when
he stated, “I don’t appreciate their
imposing their views on others by
using such criminal and brutal
tactics.”

Even if the Supreme Court over-
turns its earlier decision in the Roe
vs. Wade case, the decision will
not automatically change the laws
concerning abortion.

“The immediate focus (of the
new ruling) would return to
states,” Thornberry stated. She
referred to the abortion issue as a
“valence” issue, one that she said
legislatures despise because mem-
bers’ votes on the issue have a
direct impact upon the members’
popular support at election time.

““T would consider going on the
march to be the single most impor-
tant thing that I have done in my

my right to make decisions.about JJife thus far,” Cooper related. “I

my own body.”

She added, “‘At this point, pro-
lifers are making a moral issue out
of something that is a legal mat-
ter.”

“J just wanted to join the major-
ity of people in the country who
want to make sure that decisions
about abortion remain personal
and not controlled by the law,”
Hall echoed. “This is an intensely
personal and intimate decision.”

Hall also encouraged Davidson
students to look up the definition
of self-determination, and she

would urge people who believe in
pro-choice to write to their con-
gressmen and representatives,”
she added.

She referred students to the
1988 Congressional Staff Direc-
tory, which is edited by Charles D.
and Anna L. Brownson, for the
names and addresses of these
sons. The book is available in the
reference section of the library.

“Abortion, whether it’s legal or
not, is going to continue,” Muir
argued. “But ifit’s legal, it’s going
to remain safe.”

Freeman, when asked about his re-
action to the decision, said, “To
tell you the truth, I just found out
myself. Ireally haven’ thad time to
think about it.”

Harris says Hussey was a “ma-

jor factor” in his decision to come

to Davidson. He adds that his per-
formance has improved partly due

to Hussey’s encouragement.

“He provided a lot of motivation
and inspiration for me. That’s very
important, because despite drills
you need motivation if you want to
be the best that you can.”

Most players shared a wish of
good luck in the future for Hussey
and gave their support for his deci-
sion. Junior Alan Hunter said,
“The game: of basketball, and
coaching basketball, is like a busi-

ness. There are certain ways to
conduct business, certain deci-
sions have to be made. I can sup-
port anyone who has guts enough
to make a decision and I stand by
him.” : eos
Regarding a new coach, junior
Maurice Gray commented that the
team is “open to the change.” The
‘Ohio native is confident that the
team has the potential to win more
games next year.

“I’m hoping they’ ll bring some-
one in who will motivate us,” said
freshman Paul Drobnitch when
asked about next year’s coach.
“I’m still hopeful we’ll do well
{next year]. Practically everyone’s
coming back. I’m definitely stay-
ing,” he added.

Freeman also said that he plans
to be playing at Davidson again
next year. mE Nee

Hunter, looking ahead to next
year, added, “‘As a rising senior, I
can get along with almost anyone.
My goals haven’t changed. I have
faith in the administration. I will
try to make whoever they chose
feel comfortable in a new environ-,
ment.” aie 5

Junior Jay Schmitt declined to
comment until after Hussey’s
press conference.
