BLUE SKY PRESENTS CASE

Ed. Note: The following is
the text of the arguments
put forth by the Blue Sky
Committee in support of Its
recommendations.

_ INTRODUCTION

Just two years ago a group
of seven educators spent three
days at Davidson College in
the capacity of a Visiting
Committee of the Southern
Association of Colleges and
Schools for the purpose of
evaluating our institutional
self study. The Visiting Com-
mittee issued a written re-
port which was. for the most
part, very flattering to the
Coltege. But their written re-
port described our chapter on
educational program as dull
and unimaginative. They sug-
gested that Davidson needed
to limn with more clarity and
more vision the role of the
college in the next ten or
twenty-five years. We need.
ed, in their language, to do
some dreaming and some
blue skying.

i? has been said that a
priesthood never reforms it-
self. The Visiting Committee
doubtiess served to trigger
info action a long-standing
suspicion of many of us that
our historic program has now
become outdated and that it
is time for a change. At any
rate, in the spring of 1966
the Faculty gave enthusiastic
approval o the proposal that
we conduct a thorough re-
study of our educational pro.
gram and authorized the es-
tablishment of a special com-
mittee to conduct the inquiry
and to make recommenda-
tions. In May of 1966 the
Trustees tikewise approved
the principle of curriculum
revision and authorized the
Dean of the Faculty to under-
take the details of revision
for ultimate approval by the
Faculty. Such were the im-
mediate origins of the Blue
Sky Committee.

For many months now the
Blue Sky Committee has been
working steadily. The Com-
mittee had met in formal sés-
sion 46 times. and each mem-
ber has had many outside
committee assignments. as
well as numerous sub-com-
mittee duties. With the help
of a grant from the Duke En-
dowment. its members have
visited more than a dozen of
the best liberal arts colleges
in the country. and we have
had visitors from some of
them on our campus, such
as the Deans from Amherst.
Bowdoin, and Sewanee. En-
thusiasm has been manifest
not only among members of
the Blue Sky Committee but
also from most other mem-
bers of the Faculty. who have
made many worthwhile con-
tributions to our = study
through the reports of the
eleven sub-committees which
worked faithfully all last win-
ter and spring. The Commit-
tee has considered many pro-
posals which do not show up
in this report. Many alterna-
tives have been rejected. But
the many months of discus-
sion and argument have end-
ed in a remarkable degree of
agreement on both aims and
means. Most of the recom-
mendations have been adopt-

ed with unanimity; there are
no minority reports.

CONTEXT OF RESTUDY

Believing that ‘a text with.
out its context is a pretext’
we have tried to ground our
proposals firmly in education-
al realities as they exist both
in higher education in general
and at Davidson in particular.
We begin by noting that in
recent years educational Jit-
erature has been glutted with
Gire predictions of the decline
and fall of the liberal arts
college. especially the church
related one. It is true that
the surface forces and trends
of our times seem to militate
against its easy prosperity
and its ability to compete in
the current academic market
place. Such a college appears
to many observers to be ob
solete because it was design-
ed to serve purposes and to
reflect values that no longer
seem viable in a new and dif
ferent culture. For example,
when Davidson College was
founded higher education was
quantitatively dominated by
private colleges; this is no
longer so. The rapid expan-
sion of American higher ed.
ucation, especially public
higher education, has mini-
mized the quantitative con-
tribution of such colleges to
the total tasks of higher edu-
cation. The private. church
related college is now in a
minority position. The vast
increase in public funds for
the purposes of higher edu-
cation has also placed private.
colleges in a less prosperous
condition than that of most
public institutions. This was
not true a_ century and a
quarter ago when Davidson
was just beginning. Further.
the steady secularization of
American culture during the
last century has diminished
the status of church. colleges
through the inexorable pres
sure of the mores upon. all in
stitutions of our society. in
cluding educational institu
tions. Church related colleges
are in the minority and are
on the defensive. Finally, to
many observers the death of
the liberal arts ideal seems
inevitable because the explos-
ion of knowledge complicates
the former simplicities of
learning and suggests that
there is no body of essential
knowledge and no group of
absolute values which can
any longer give unity and pur-
pose to an educational pro-
gram. Specialized scholar-
ship. not broad basic learn-
ing. permeates twentieth cen-
tury education, and such a
trend puts the liberal arts
college in a minority and de
fensive position.

Even though we do not ar-
gue with the fact that the
kind of education Davidson
provides is in the minority,
and perhaps on the defensive,
we do contend that it is not
obsolete. Liberal arts educa-
tion does not continue to ex-
ist simply because it Is al-
ready in existence. Its vi-
tality cannot be explained
merely in terms of the mo.
mentum of a century, for too
many people die every year
who have never died before.

the market place is an index
of Its worth, then its value
can hardly be questioned, for
we cannot admit even a ma-
jority of those who apply.

But liberal arts education
is not obsolete for reasons
better than the number of
persons who demand it. It fs
relevant to this secular and
technological age not only
because it is still in demand,
but because it makes de-
mands of its own. It will not
endure a lazy mind that is
satisfied with facts. It thinks
not so much of materials to
be covered as of understand-
ing to be achieved. It insists
that the principal task of a
college is not only to furnish
the mind with knowledge but
also to help each student find
himself as an individual and
then to lose himself in causes
and ideas that are greater.
more enduring. and more
worthy than he. Liberal edu.
cation has something to say
about the inescapable reali-
ties of life—about good and
evil, joy and suffering. death,
history, science. God.  Al-
though it cannot give any stu-
dent a faith. but only alter
natives, it can help him pro-
vide a framework of funda.
mental attitudes which may
allow him to discover the
meaning of life for himself.

‘Thus curriculum revision is
predicated upon a_ recogni-
tion of several educational
realities of our time. First.
the ‘explosion of knowledge
complicates the tasks both of
defining and of confining lib
eral education. The vast in-
crease in the quantity of hu
man knowledge which has
characterized the past gener
ation convinces us that no

longer can thére be said to
exist an agreed-upon. body of
learning which stamps any
single structure with the seal
of orthodoxy or final authori-
ty. This fact says to us that
rigid programs must give
way to flexible ones if the
educated man of today is not
to become the obsolete man
of tomorrow.

Further. a liberal arts cur-
riculum that meets the de-
mands of any age is. by its
very nature, different from
others. It is unique in that
there is imposed upon it no
external pattern, as in law
or medicine. There is no
license or certification from
the state to freeze it into a
certain mold. A college must
decide for itself what its cur-
riculum shall be. This is a
constant challenge to a facul-
ty and neglect of it by reason

HONORS COLLEGE

SUMMARY |

An Honors College would be established for 35 to 50 .
students, whose graduation requirements would then be
set by the Honors College faculty. The College’s faculty
would be rotated with the regular faculty. ‘
| NON-WESTERN STUDIES

A program in Non-Western studies would be offered, but
there would be no major in this area.

AREA REQUIREMENTS
The field of Hberal arts would be divided into four areas:

Language. Literature and the Arts: religion and philoso-
‘ phy: social science; and natural science. Students would

be required to pass area examinations before entering

the junior year.

THREE-TRACK PROGRAM

A student would be allowed to take regular courses. or if
he wished, and were qualified, to take up independent
study or enter the Honors College.

THREE-TERM YEAR

The two semesters would be replaced by three terms.
with first term exams before Christmas and second term
exams before spring vacation.

ROTC

Basic ROTC would be voluntary and would receive no
academic credit. Advanced ROTC would receive two
courses of credit. The Committee called for the develop-
ment of a new and. imaginative program of officer train.

ing.

GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS

Thirty-two courses would be required. eight per year:
three courses each of the first two terms, and two the
third. Twelve courses would be required for a major, and
12 for the basic requirements.

LEARNING CENTER

A learning Center would be built featuring programmed
learning and resources for independent study, as well as

a career service program.

are readily accessible at a
cheaper price in many good
institutions. Davidson, with
the advantage of a highly
selected student body, must
offer something literally ex-
traordinary, or else deserve
to wither away into medi-
ocrity. This fact says to us
that ordinary programs must

posals permeated with chal-
tenges Yo the superior student.

The final glittering reality
to be mentioned--and stress

Davidson student. Hardly any
person now engaged in any
phase of higher education will
argue with the conclusion that
college students are now far
better prepared academically
than they were ten years ago.

lege can afford to walk back-
wards into the future.

It is in the light of these
realities that we propose spe-
cific features which we be-
lieve will help us meet the
demands of a new age. We
are convinced that. above all
other features, we require
Mexibility and challenge to
individual student responsi-
bility to a greater degree
than we have had in the old
program. Flexibility is a-
chieved by a number of de-
vices to be described below.
such as a new calendar. a
provision for area require-
ments to replace the former
rigid core requirements of
specific courses. a_ three-
track plan whereby a choice
is given in the ways by which
students may meet area, ma
jor. and graduation require
ments, and by the proposal
of an Honors College. Chal
lenge to individual student
responsibility is written into
the program by means of
many of these features al
ready mentioned. but also by
the proposals for a learning
center. area examinations.
and especially by the provis
jons for independent study
and the Honors College.

When we realize the broad
enéd scope of education and

the varied abilities and train

ing of students. we. are led to
see that no one structure, no
one plan. can accommodate
the diversity of experience we
seek. As the Sub-conimittee
on Student Life pointed out in
its Report, this diversity can

not.be provided by structures,
but can be stimulated by
them. Because so iaclr. of
education occurs through
chance encounters. it cannot-

could write to state the bald
fact that statistics show that
the Davidson student is now
far better prepared for flexi:
ble and challenging programs
than ever before, and better
than students in many of the
very best colleges which al-
ready have revised their pro.
grams in recognition of this
realtity. These data demon.
strate beyond cavil that the
raw material for an exciting
intellectual adventure is on
our campus. The task of the
future at Davidson is the task.
of developing the full poter-.
tial of such human material.
It will be a tragedy for this
college if the high level of
ability in the student ‘body is
not matched by a similar
growth in the quality and cali
ber of the curriculum. This
fact says to us that the quali-_
ly of the student dictates the
need for a far greater degree
of individual student respon
sibility in education.

And so it is that the Com-
mittee has been led to an un-
derstanding that patterns of
the past, however glorious
and however pertinen! to one
age, are not necessarily good
enough for another. It has
been a traumatic experience
to tinker with vested inter-
ests and to challenge almost
sacred assumptions which
have accumulated over many,
many years of time. And we
wish to make it plain that by
seeking a new pattern we do
not intend to belittle the old.
As Santayana has said, “We
do not refute our predecass-
ors, we only bid them fare-
well.” We simply recognize,
as the twentieth century
moves on, that college peo-
ple, like church ones, can
never seitle down. They must
always be on the move; both
must ever be a pligrim peo-
ple whose lives are fived be-
tween the Red Sea and the
Promised Land. No institu-
tion has the right to claim
a vested interest in a past
mistake or, more accurately,
to perpetuate in one age what
has outlived its admitted use-
fulness in another. Wo col-

a

be completely programmed.
What we try to envision is an
environment sso open and so
free that these crucial acci-
dents of discovery are every-
where encouraged. And so
it follows that if our design
for environment of education
is for one that is flexible and
open there must be provided
an opportunity for a greater
measure of student responsi-
bility. If we picture a setting
in which the student becomes
educated instead of getting
an education. this implies for
him an involved role, not an
inert one. He must be, ulti
mately, the motivating force
for his own education as he
takes advantage of offered
opportunities and as he
moves from encounter and in
quiry to experience and in-
volvement. The process thus
centers on the student: the
environment around him is
the medium through which
his ewn identity and his own
intellectual integrity may be
stimulated. The logic of these
convictions leads us to real-
ize that we must make ex-
ceptions for the exceptional
student and that no required
ritual fits the needs and abili-
ties of all students. We must
encourage each one to under-
stand that what he does be-
yond the ritual will be the
true measure of his excel-
lence. The most important
examination he will ever have
will be the examination he
gives his own conscience.

Such, are the chatlenging
veattities that make up the
context In which the Commit-
tee has worked and planned.
The recommendations we
propose reflect our recogni-
flon of these realities and of
the chailenges inherent in
them. But educational com-
mitment, if it is authentic,
will be not only to the reali-
fles but to the possibilities of
our age. One thoughtful edu-
cator has reminded us that
the principal task of our col-
leges is to educate man to
see reality as the God of
Genesis saw the chaos: as
clay to be worked; and above

She Ravidsantas

all to recognize that the work-
ing of the clay is a part of
the reality.

A curriculum is a combina-
tion of information. techni-
ques, and attitudes whose
proportions must constantly
change. It is an expression
of a conviction that the tone.
style, and skills connected
with liberal learning can
make one more sensible and
more responsive as well as
more knowledgeable. It in-
sists that a truly liberal hu-
man being can be produced
by the yen for excellence.

In such a context, and with
such a hope, your Commit-
tee is proposing a new cur-
riculum. acknowledging that
it is always a means to an
end. The features, described
in the following sections of
this report represent our at-
tempt to recognize the reali-
ties of our age. but also to
realize its potentialities by
providing an environment of
flexibility, challénge. and in.
creased student responsibil-
ity.

ADVANTAGES TO
STUDENTS

In planning a new program
for Davidson College. your
Committee constantly has
had before it the educational
needs of the Davidson stu-
dent. We have proceeded in
the conviction that it was to
hiis best interests that we
preduce .a curriculum that
was not so braad that it would
frusliate or-not so deep that
it. would paralyze. We have
sought to provide ‘flexibility
challenge. and opportunities
for inereased student. respon
sibility. We- believe these
qualities are featured in the
new proposals. The present
program of rigid and uniform
requirements is replaced ‘by
one with far more choice
within the broad areas af lib
eral education. This arrange
ment is a recognition of the
changing nature of. Nberal
learning. 1t wifl maké his
education. more relevant to
his times, whichever track he
may choose. Challenge and
individual responsibility are
provided in many ways. but
especially. by the area exami
nations which require a re
sponsibility beyond assigned
course materials and by the
opportunities for independent
study and the Honors College.
We believe he can become
far_better educated than was
Jikely under the traditional
program.

ADVANTAGES TO THE
FACULTY

Up to this point little or
nothing has been said direct-.
ly about the effects of the
proposed new curriculum on
the members of the Faculty
as teachers and scholars. The
faculty advantages inherent
in the proposals need now to
be summarized and evaluat.
ed.

In the first place, it will
become necessary for each
faculty member to revise his
present course structure and
content in order to fit the
work of a 15-week semester
into a ten-week term. Each
instructor will have.to re-
think and reorganize his
course materials; this neces-
sity will be professionally
good for most of us in com

pelling us to update our
teacning in both content and
methéd. Further, each de-
partment will have to review
its offerings in the light of a
new calendar and different
student requirements.

The flexibility, provided in
the new program will also
compel the faculty member
to take far more seriously
his role as academic adviser,
especially to those students
who elect tracks outside the
regular course track. This
will afford limitless oppor-
tunities for close intellectual
and personal relationships
between faculty and students.

The composition and needs
of the Faculty are matters of
utmost concern to the present
and future welfare of David
son College. It will not he
sufficient for Davidson to
continue its compensation
program into the future.
While a¢his surely needs to he
done. the College must. also
recognize and plan for the
professional needs of its Fac-
ulty: if the talents and prom-
ise of the students are to he
adequately developed. A chal-
lenging new curriculum. will
hold many and attract others.
but only if teaching loads can
_be reduced, research oppor-
tunities increased. and excit-
ing changes for perpetual
self-renewal provided. Your:
Committee believes our pro-
posed program. gives promis¢
of these things.

From the beginning one of
the stated purposes of curri-.
culum revision has..been the.
ghieclive of a reduction’ of
teaching loads from an aver:
age of 12 hours a week, to
one of nine. The question be~
comes. what will we need to
hold our own in quality and
still reduce teaching loads
to approximately nine hours?

We have already explained.
our proposal to abandon se
mester hour requirements
and to substitute the require:
ment of 32 courses for gradu:
ation. With this recommen:
dation in mind. on thé basis,
of the prevailing ratio of 15:
to. 1. what are staff needs:
under .the new proposal?

1000 students at cight cours
es per year equals 8000 cours-
es. If faculty membei's teach
two courses éach term they.
would teach six courses in an
academic year instead of the.
present eight. By mathe.
matical calculation, we find
that 89 faculty members are
needed. not counting the
faculty needs of special pro-
grams such as Honors Col-
lege and Non-Western stud
ies.

Recalling our proposals for
a new calendar and the 3-3-2
plan, and the arrangement
shown in the chart, we be-
lieve we will be able to ad-
just the teaching loads of the
Faculty so that about 22 fa-
culty members can teach
three courses for two terms
instead of two courses for
three terms, and have one
term off during the academic
year; the other 67 faculty
members would each two
courses in each of three
ferms. Our hope is that by
rotating the 22 members who
wilt teach their nine hour
load in two terms instead of.
