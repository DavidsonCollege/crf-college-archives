Les Moore: More or Less
Blues Musican Plays Outpost:

By JAMES BERRY
Staff writer

Last Saturday, Davidson’s
weary travellers found refuge from
the cold and windy weather inside
the Union Outpost where they were
greeted by free tacos and the sweet
sound of the blues. As a part of
Midwinters weekend, the College
Union presented a three piece out-
fit for the Outpost’s customers.

The lead vocalist, Les Moore,
played rhythm guitar on his acous-
tic, and behind him sat Glenn
Kawamoto on fretless bass and
Bobby Donaldson on lead guitar.

The show consisted almost
exclusively of covers from various
artists such as Eric Clapton (the
band’s rendition of Layla came
close to Clapton’s unplugged ver-
sion), Rod Stewart, Dire Straits,

and Chuck Barry. Countless other
blues classics made the set list as
well.

The relationship between the
three musicians was obvious from
their on-stage personalities and was
confirmed when I had a chance to
sit down and speak with them. It
turns out that the three men don’t
work together much at all but have
performed on and off asa group for
a few years.

When they’ re not performing
as an anonymous trio, they play in
separate bands, work on indepen-
dent projects, or serve as session
musicians in the studio. Glenn
Kawamoto and Bobby Donaldson
work in the Austin and New Or-
leans areas respectively. Only Les
Moore is based in Charlotte and,
after a little prodding from the oth-
ers, he offered some information

about his work.

One of his upcoming projects
is to host an open stage show at the
Double Door (a blues club in Char-
lotte) on February 13. He’ll set up
his own equipment and instruments
and offer the stage to various local
artists with the intent of showcas-
ing some new music.

Also, every Tuesday he ap-
pears at the Dilworth Brewery and
every Wednesday at the Providence
Road Sundries as a part of the
acoustic open stages that the two
clubs sponsor.

After Saturday’s afternoon
show (February 4), the three had
plans to play at the Midtown Sun-
dries that evening along with a
drummer to complete their en-
semble. As aclose to our talk they
wanted to thank the Union for the
tacos.

Music of Midwinters:
Cravin’ Mellon and Curnette & Maher

By DAVE WILLIARD

Amidst a hailstorm of contro-
versy, Nashville boys Curnutte and
Maher brought their incendiary set
list all the way across I-40 for a
unique opening act at Friday’s
Union Midwinters concert.

Steve Curnutte, resident Billy
Ray Cyrus imitator, felt the weight
of the 900 Room’s typical audi-
ence nonchalance hit him like a
chunk of rancid cheese.

As the pre-law majors stared
blankly, Curnutte went through his
repertoire of songs about Buddha
bellies and quadrupeds. The acous-
tic duo then moved on to a set of

the direct insults if they wanted to
continue the show. Before the
second act began, Perry apologized
to the audience on behalf of the
Union and thanked us for perse-
vering.

As the second act began, there
was an air of discomfort about the
room. No one wanted to have to
stop the show, but no one wanted
to sit through another hour of taste-
less jokes andembarrassment. The
tension began to ease as the act
proceeded, thanks to the sports-
manship of the students who had
been asked to participate in the
play. The inappropriate insults
were at a minimum, and the
audience’s response was genuine.

When the play closed, I felt as
if I had just been through some-
thing I shouldn’t have gotten my-
self into in the first place. Atleast,
however, we had some reason to
clapatthe end. According to Perry,
“‘Asusual, Davidson students came
through and added their own per-
sonality and an element of class”
that kept the evening from being a
complete failure.

Maherand Curnutte both went
to Wake Forest; Curnutte gradu-
ated, but Maher got too many com-
munity service hours racked up
zgainst him to make it all four
years. The time he urinated in a
Burger King bag in his dorm was
the final straw, according to the
Wake Forest Dean of Students’
office.

Cravin’ Melon pounced the
stage after Curnutte and Maher left
with a throng of women in tow.
The Melons sounded like a mix-
ture of, well, Craven Dogs and

“Dr. Gil Holland reads from his new book

Blind Melon — hence the name
(Blind Dogs didn’t seem to ring
quite true). Perhaps they are alittle
low on Vitamin C? These guys
were straight ahead power guitar-
ists to the core. I have never heard
a more kickin’ version of a Steve
Miller song!

Still, it was a bit disturbing to
see one of the band members in his

-early thirties. wearing hiking boots

and a plaid shirt tied around his
waist. He just looked too much
like a freshman trying to get a
PiKA bid.

In the immortal words of my
next door neighbor John: “Hey!
Both bands sang all the words in
the right order!”

cal” college students.

For example, everyone knows that neo-Nazis hate blacks; a more
important point to get across is that many apparently “normal,” mentally
healthy students still harbor racist feelings. This movie barely sheds
light on the subtle, everyday racial tensions that go on at almost every
college or university in the nation. Extreme situations, such as the
violence in this movie, may be exciting to watch, but they fail to relate
the issues at hand so that the spectators can identify with the situation in
their own lives.

This movie does reveal some important problems and themes, but
it fails to relate its message personally to the audience members. These
issues must be understood not only in the minds, but also in the hearts of
the people watching.
