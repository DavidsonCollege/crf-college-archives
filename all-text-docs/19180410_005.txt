The “Wildcats” annihilated the Uni-

All of Georgia’s runs were due to er-

plays by hitting the ball hard, and at the

right time. Boswell and Flowers were
the chief sluggers for the Presbyterians.
For Georgia, Mott’s fielding was good.
and Hargrett’s three-base wallop was the
only real batting that the Georgians
were able to show. The score:
