Movie Review

Broken
Arrow
misses
target

By Ep AcLE

Movie Critic

John Woo knows how to
direct action films. Anyone that
has ever seen any of his Hong
Kong action films knows that
he’s an old pro. What the Hong
Kong films such as The Killer
had which separated them from
standard Hollywood fare was
the depth of characterization that
Woo gave each of his charac-
ters. The Killer worked because
Woo setup the characterizations
of both the policeman and the
killer (Chow Yun Fat). Even
though Fat was a relentless as-
sassin, the audience sympathized
with him. Broken Arrow could
have used some of the charac-
terization that Woo’ s earlier film
employed. |

Arrow’s plot is relatively
simple to follow. While on a
training mission over the Utah
desert in a B-3 Stealth Bomber,
pilot: Vic Deakins (John
Travolta) punches out his friend
and co-pilot Riley Hale (Chris-
tian Slater). He then takes off
with two nuclear bombs The
rest of the film is basically a
face-off between the two old
friends as they race to gain con-
trol of the weapons across the
Western desert.

The Western locale is no
accident. Much of the filmseems
to be a reconfiguration of old
Western ideas (the whole film is
basically an extended shoot-out).
The score itself seems to have
come straight out of an Ennio
Morricone score that one could
find in a Sergio Leone Spaghetti
Western.

The action sequences are
impeccable. Many of the new
school directors (such as Quentin
Tarantino) have pointed out Woo
as one of their main influences.
That can be seen in Broken Ar-
row through the use of Woo
trademarks such as the light-
ning-fast editing, the balletic
slow motion, the gun-in-each-
hand-blazing-away sequence
and the countless number of
stand-offs that occur in the film.
Woo’s skill in the editing room
becomes apparent in the open-
ing credits brutal boxing se-
quence.

Yet Woo’s most endearing
trademark of character depth is
missing. Muchcould have been
done with the friendship between
the men. Travolta is an accom-
plished actor—he could have
done wonders with a more re-

+ ONE ADDICT'S STORY]

The Melrose Phenomenon

By Mary Tow es ALLISON
Assistant Arts and Living Editor

Ah, Mondays. Youdrag your-
self out of bed, thinking you have
nothing to look forward to but an-
other week of Davidson’s grueling
workload, when you suddenly re-
alize that there is something.

It’s Melrose Place —amind-
less collaboration of scandal and
tawdry love affairs that makes life
at Davidsoncomplete. Never mind
that-you have two tests to study for
and a paper to write; there are no
excuses for missing Melrose (more
affectionately known as MP).
Heaven forbid that a meeting would
keep us away, or that we would
walk out of the room before catch-
ing scenes from the next episode. I
havea friend, we’ Il call her Bonnie
for protection’s sake, who is so
obsessed with MP that she has the
perfume and an entire magazine
dedicated to the show.

It is not enough to know the
characters only by name (one must
have a very high tolerance for TV
addiction to not get hooked after
the first or second episode), watch-
ing MP should be a vicarious ex-
perience.

In a conversation my friends
and I might have about MP, we
refer to the inhabitants of Melrose
as if they were close acquaintan-
ces. Bonnie was talking about the
show just the other day: “Can you
believe that Billy? He was so rude
to confront Alison moving in with
him in front of the whole wedding
reception! I was so embarrassed
for her. He’s gotten really aggres-
sive lately.”

We’re suspicious that Aaron
‘(Spelling) is going to try a Billy’s-
been-possessed-by-Brook’ s-ghost
theme. Even the most faithful
Melrose watchers would see this
as a frivolous attempt at finding a
story line. Bonnie and I are hop-

ing that this isn’t the case.

A couple of weeks ago, Fox
showed a two-hour episode of MP
(the crowd cheers). Everyone knew
that two people were going to die;
the entire week before the show,
my hall discussed who we thought
it would be.

We were all disappointed
when the first’ victim was
Kimberly’s psychopathic kidnap-
per from her radio show days; he
was kind of entertaining, and, after
all, what’s Melrose without men-
tal disorders?

Some traitor in the room went
so far as to comment that Fox was
just trying to boost ratings by do-
ing a two hour show, and no one
important would end up dying any-
way. After bearing a few evil
stares, she regained her compo-
sure. Near the end of the episode
all other members of the cast were
intact and, yes, even I was losing
faith in Aaron Spelling.

Wait! A glimmer of light (and
it wasn’t one of Amanda’s tight
satin shirts in’ the background);
Brook threw one of her whiny little
fits again and Billy, with a
newfound assertive personality,
left with Alison. Any religious
MP viewer could have known what
was coming next. The room fell
silent and we watched as Brook
slipped, hit her head on the side of
the pool and floated unconscious.

Noone said anything for a few
minutes and then everyone agreed
that it was for the best, she was
only making everyone miserable
(including herself), and none of us
liked her anyway. It was a typical
MP twist, with just enough sus-
pense to make us come back for
more.

Bonnie and I, as well as many
others (even if they’re not willing
to admit it), are happy to escape
into this realm of MP. Sure, it’s
not real, but that’s the beauty of it.

Kiss and tell

with the

afterlife

Dr. Moody speaks about near death

By NaresH NAGELLA

Assistant News Editor

Dying and coming back. Wouldn’t those people have storiesto tell?
Dr. Raymond Moody, author of Life after Life and seven other
books on the subject, came to campus Wednesday to tell some of those
stories. As part of the Medical Humanities Lecture Series, Moody gave
a talk on “Learning from Near Death Experiences,” a topic he considers,

“jazzy and exciting.”

To preface his lecture, Moody spent a half hour warning the
audience not to take his stories as evidence of an afterlife, stating, “as
dramatic as [the stories] may be, it is not fair to state that they are valid
