Students Become Teachers, Help
Children In Learning Academy

By ALLEN LEWIS
Staff Writer

Every Davidson student
has at one time or another
wished that he could be on
the giving end of education
rather than the receiving end.

The wish has become real-
ity for Davidson juniors
Frank Ball. Kenny Hayes and
Rick Travilla and sophomore
Steve Hayes. They are teach
er aides in the Charlotte.
Mecklenburg Learning Aca-
demy.

' a ae &

The Academy. part of the
Charlotte-Mecklenburg School
System, is located in Hunt-
ersville in the former Tor-
rence-Lytle High School. Its
purpose is to aid the under
achiever—the student who .<
behjnd his classmates in aca
demic achievement = even
though he is of average or
above average intelligence.

The program is designed to
stimulate interest in school.
so that the underachiever
leaves the Academy with a

desire to learn.

The school opened last Oc-
tober and is presently open
to eighth-grade boys although
in the future. girls may be
included in the program. Al-
so, students from lower
grades may be included in
the p-ogram. When fully in
operation. the school will
have about 160 students.

Under Donald Hayes. direc.
tor, and Barney Coffey, resi-
dent director. the student is
given an intensive program

of study which is tailored to
his individual needs. Before
coming to the Academy, the
student takes a diagnostic
test to determine what his
needs are.

Since the students live on
campus during the week.
there can be up to nine class
hours as compared to the
normal six-hour day in a
public school. The program
includes evening labs and
other special activities such
as field trips and visiting
speakers and groups. The
student stays on an average
of three to four months, but
he can stay as long as neces-
sary in order to solve his
problem.

Since the school is not fully
equipped (there will be a
fully equipped shop facility
soon), the teacher aides are
mainly activities directors.
They supervise study halls
and athletic activities such
as basketball, softball, arch-
ery and horseshoes. They al-
so assist the students in labs
and individual projects, Ball
is now teaching them karate.
while Travilla teaches them
wrestling.

“The school i> «(I
developing stage.”’ said Steve
Hayes. ‘The staff is not real-
ly sure what they want us to
do. Our function isn't clearly
defined yet. Later, we may
teach them languages and
other subjects."

‘Although it's still too early
to tell, we feel that there is
a definite improvement after
the boys leave here.”’ said
Coffey. “The parents have
said that their sons seemed

fo be more interested in
school after leaving here.”

“We also feel that our
teacher aides are an inval-
vabdle asset to our program.”
he said “They get along with
the bos and keep up their in-
tv est in what they are do-
ing.”

Moliere’s ‘Tartuffe’ Due
Presentation In Charlotte

Molier’s ‘Tartuffe.’’ the ne-
oclassical French comedy,
will be presented. in Ovens
Auditorium at. 8 p.m. Feb
14.

“This is one of the great:
est comedies ever written in
the French language."’ Dr.
Joe O. Embry, professor of
French, said.

“On one level there is the
sophisticated satire of the
17th century French aristoc-
racy, but there is also enough
slapstick humor in the play
to entertain people who don't
understand French," he add-
ed.

Under the sponsorship of
Davidson, the Chariotte-
Mecklenburg Public schools,
Queens and Winthrop col-
leges, ‘“Tartuffe’’ will be
performed in French by Le
Treteau de Paris.

The story of the play cen.
ters around Tartuffe, posing
as a poor wretch, who has
been taken into the household
of the wealthy Orgon. Orgon
and his mother, Madame
Pernelle, have been duped

by his affected sincerity, but
the other members of the
household know him for what
he is. an impostor seeking to
take advantage of Orgon’s
kindnesses.

Moliere's comedy rapidly
becomes a merry ‘‘pot-au-
feu’ with all sorts of com-
plications resulting from Or-
gon's myopia. Orgon propos-
es to marry off his daughter
Mariane to the red-nosed
glutton Tartuffe.

Tartuffe, however, has his
cap set for Elmire, Orgon's
wife, and attempts to seduce
her. Orgon's son is tempo-
rarily disinherited, in a fur-
ther complication to the plot.
Tartuffe ultimately {s reveal-
ed to Orgon as the hypocrite
he really is. But. ironically,
Tartuffe seems to hold all
the trumps, and very nearly
succeeds in playing them to
bring ruin to Orgon. his ben-
efactor.

Statistics, which the Amer

the U. S. Office of Education
jointly collect. require the
book count to include the 1i-
brary’s holdings of govern.
ment documents.

During the Christmas holi-
days Jack McGeachy, a stu-
dent document assistant at
the library, made a special
inventory of the documents
housed in the library's west
basement. McGeachy com-
pleted the inventory after
two years of work.

Dr. Chalmers Davidson, li-
brary director, said that ‘‘this
total of the government doc-
uments, added to the last of-
ficially reported annual fig-
ure in June, 1967, of 133,886

Concerto
‘Mystical,

Chaotic’

ED. NOTE: On Jan.
15, Witmer Haydn Welsh’s
“Concerto for Voice and Or-
chestra” was premiered in
Love Auditorium by the
Chicago Little Symphony
with Miss Ilona Kombrink
as soloist. Welsh is associ-
ate professor of music. The
reviewer, Ashton Trice, is
& junior.

By ASHTON TRICE

As with most of Welch's
compositions, the concerto, a
secular musical form. derives
its inspiration from the com-
poser’s personal religious
mysticism.

Each of the three move
ments contain a short recita-
tive with text from the Song
of Solomon. which to Welsh
offers a blending of a mys-
tical search for divine order
with elements of divine and
human love. Otherwise the
soloist sings, without words,
as a member of the orches-
tra.

To me, the first movement
was chaotic. The rich melod.
ic nature of the two subse-
quent movements was lack-
ing—the ear could only catch
occasional, brief moments of
beauty.

The graéeful second move-
ment was abundant in mel-
ody, derived from the motifs
of the early disorder, and it
was beautifully orchestrated.
retaining much of the Mid-
dle Eastern flavor of Welsh's
oratorio ‘‘Joseph.”’

Miss Kombrink was espe-
cially pleasing in this part,
using to great advantage the
dark, sensuous timbres of her
voice.

The ,third movement was a
contrast to the earlier por.
tions which were generally re-
laxed, representing the close
of the search and the fruition
of the loves, by a series of
joyous passages, tapering in-:

to a calm, peaceful finale,

where harmony was achiev.
