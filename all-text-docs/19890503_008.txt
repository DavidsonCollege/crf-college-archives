Trump University course

—
By TONS 0. DOUGH

Trump University has revised its master course schedule
and its graduation requirements. The complete course catalog

is available in the new Registrar’s office on the twenty-ninth floor of the

Trump National tower next to the waterfall.
One change is anew quarterly system calendar. Classes will be held 365 days a year, with
the next break scheduled to be Leap Year’s Day in 1992. All classes, excepting this year’s
due to its members’ imminent graduation, will be required to take at least 7 courses a quarter.
Graduation requirements include 120 courses with a 3.9 minimum GPA for each quarter.
Trump says he subscribes to the bigger-is-better school of thought. “I like thinking big. If you’re going
to be thinking anyway, you might as well think big,” he said.
According to Registrar Sue Ross, “All students must major in either Economics, Business Management,

Construction Management or Architecture,’ each of which will require 117 courses to complete. Area
requirements include one course in each of these four areas. Now maybe these kids will stay off that Patterson

Court!”

New faculty members have
not been announced, but some
rumors report that I. M. Pay will
chair the architectural department,
Paul Volkswagen will head the
economics department, Lee Iapepsi
will lead the business management
departmentand the people to thank

These changes reflect Trump

University’s official attitude
towards the liberal arts, which is
one of disgust. The revised
Statement of Purpose reads,
“Trump University, the university
with the name that screams
‘quality,’ is dedicated to the
education of futute yuppies and
other fine money-grubbing young
adults. As an atheist institution,
our purpose is to keep all students
on the road to riches, no matter
what the consequences or the
means by which this wealth is
achieved.” Another portion reads,
“Think big. I like thinking big. If
you’re going to be thinking
anyway, you might as well think
big.”
