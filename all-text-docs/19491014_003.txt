Carolina Inn,

Yes, in spite of logical demands |
for complete destruction, Carolina
Inn, overlooking Copelands “If if

next week,” will undosbtedly 'con-

sity is often referred to as a build :
ing but this is definitely a mis
nomer. In the first place it doesn't
meet with the building standards
of the early American log cabin
established by the FHA under
Pocahontus.

However, we must admit that;
this traditional structure has sev-,
eral modern conveniences and inno.
vations which were concocted by
the first Physics Department at!

you want some water you pull a

it has rained recently, The water is
heated by the rising flames from
your cozy potbellied stove.

Once au insurance. man visited

quick action is necessary, I reached
to my pocket for the protruding .
candy bar, ripped the nut-covered
bar from its wrapper. and cast it
into his gaping jaws. So now it’s
nuts he doesn’t like! He showed in
his obvious way of searching out -
tidbits: in his food that in spite of
his pedigree, he contains a trace

Atl of our mongrels have many
odd traits. Mob psychology seems
always to be in effect. Not a game
passes without their deciding to
play a queer form of hopscotch and
tax on the football field. Our dogs
are very democratic in their ideas
about love, And they sleep. What
sleeps! A collision with another
planet wouldn't affect them. Un-
fortunately, the Davidson campus
has a shortage of fire plugs. I
summon all to be awake to the
quivering muscles of a dog’s hind
teu, They disrupt our assemblies.
And they stroll Nonchalantly in
our classes, not seeking knowledge.
Not that I’m down on the absent-
minded professor who proverbially
combs his cigar and lights his hair,
winds up: his key and opens the
door with his watch, fondles mice
and sets traps for the baby, says
his prayers when he enters a thea-
ter and leaves the church for a
smoke between acts. but there was
a prof a day ago who, when passed
a flea-caverc.l off cast ot a jackal,
cursed under his breath the lowly
freshman who failed to tp his
beanie. ‘€

Herc arc listed a few of the ob-
noxious, .but fascinating traits of
our dogs. Now it is up to us to
get alony with them. Simple is
the rude for this: :
