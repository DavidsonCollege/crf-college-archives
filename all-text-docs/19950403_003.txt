TAKE BACK THE NIGHT

By Betu LInDsey
Staff writer

One out of every three women
will be a victim of sexual assault
during her lifetime. Only 16 per-
cent of rapes are reported. Sev-
enty-five percent of rape victims
know their attackers. The Senate
Judiciary Committee’s 1991 re-
port found that 624,000 women
are raped every year, 12,000
women each week, one woman
every 50 seconds.

The atmosphere was hushed,
some greeting each other in muffled
tones while others sat in nervous
silence, The mood was intense as
students, faculty members, admin-
istrators, and members of the
Davidson community awaited the
fifth annual Take Back the Night.

Take Back the Night,
Davidson’s annual forum on rape,
focuses on an issue that is much
more prevalent than many at
Davidson would care to admit.
“Davidson is very good at doing
intellectual exploration of very
tough issues, but is not very good
at exploring the emotional side,”
says Sarah Carlson ‘93, a news
intern in College Relations.

_ Letitia Campbell, who headed
up Women’s Month, agrees. “This
event puts a human face on what is

sometimes a really abstract issue.”

This year’s event featured four
speakers, including Courtney Gil-
bert, Jessalyn Wynn, an additional
female, and a male. Each pre-
sented his or her own story, as
descriptive or as general as each
would like and exposed the power-
ful “human face” of this problem.
They brought to each listener the
frank realization that the issue of
rape is not just on the news or in the
newspaper but is a reality at
Davidson.

The speakers were followed
by Junior Laura Leibfreid’s rendi-
tion of Tori Amos’ “Silent All
These Years” and a poetry read-
ing. Each audience member then
tied a red ribbon around his or her
wrist in support of rape victims.
The event closed with a silent vigil
outside of the Union in which mem-
bers present held candles and tied
ribbons on a tree in remembrance
of rape victims.

Carlson was part of the first
Rape Awareness Committee
formed at Davidson in 1989. When
she joined, she “felt a strong sense
of solidarity based on something
more then similar academic and
ideological interests,” she says.

Although at that time the Dean
of Students Office made the rape
education program top priority,

Students gather for a candlelight vigil to

a

memorialize rape victims and protest violence against women.

“‘we encountered considerable op-
position from other students who
felt threatened by our frank discus-
sions of sex, Patterson Court, alco-
hol, and power relationships ... and
vehement letters filled The
Davidsonian, debating feminist
agendas,” says Carlson.

Take Back the Night, a pro-
gram which now takes ona variety
of forms and serves a variety of:
purposes, began in England as a
protest against the fear that women
encountered walking the streets at
night. It came to the United States
in 1978 and has taken root in most

of the country. Occurring in a
variety of forms, Take Back the
Night finds unity in its desire for
the self-empowerment of the
women planning and attending the
rally and march. ;

FLAG |

— from pagel

ognized FLAG’s supporters and
expressed excitement about the
forum, saying, “It makes me real-
ize how far FLAG has come.”

However, Grimmel also de-
scribed recent incidents which she
said “make me realize how far we
have to go.” Onamen’s freshmen
hall two weeks ago, aFLAG mem-
ber was verbally harrassed by a
group of three students as he posted
flyers for the sexuality forum.
Recently, FLAG’s bulletin board
in Chambers was vandalized and
torn down.

Panelists responded to three
general questions regarding the
discovery process of their sexual
orientation, people who have
helped them through their discov-
ery process, and how their experi-
ences at Davidson have been in-
strumental. Then the forum opened
up to audience questions, oral and
written. The panel included two
men and four women. Senior Hal
Dougherty, former Co-chair of
FLAG and a panel member at last
year’s forum, joined the group
during the audience question por-
tion. :

Freshman Robert Knight, a
new Co-chair of FLAG, spoke
poignantly about losing a friend in
high school because he was homo-
sexual: ‘‘My friend told her dad,
and her dad said I had mental prob-
lems and needed to go to a counse-
lor. She felt like she couldn’t be
my friend. The situation is still not
resolved.”

Knight’s mother travelled
from Orlando to be at the forum
and addressed the crowd. She said,

“I know that you love somebody
first, and you love them no matter
what comes along. Robert is a
blessing in my life, and Hlove him.”

Freshman Amber Sharick
spoke candidly about her bisexual-
ity: “I’ve never said I’m straight,
I’m gay, bisexual, whatever. Be-
ing bisexual is a weird thing. I
think it is misunderstood .... Rules
were never very clear for me. I
hate to put a limit on friendships,
and say, ‘Because you are female,
I can only love you so much.’”

Sharick’s freshman hall at-
tended the forum en masse and
cheered loudly when she spoke.
Sharick spoke emotionally about
their support. “My hall has been
amazing. Without them, I’m not
sure I could be here tonight ... I
have been amazed by the accep-
tance. They treat me with respect.”

Lisa Moore, a 1994 graduate,
travelled from WashingtonD.C. to
speak at the forum. Moore says, “I
didn’t want to deal with [my ho-
mosexuality] while at Davidson. I
was at Davidson at a time when
there were several black students
who did not make me feel comfort-
able with this issue at all.”

Moore, whois African-Ameri-
can, said, “For me, it is a racial
issue ... I’m still in the process of
dealing with the black commu-
nity.” Moore said she returned to
Davidson for the forum to let people
know that “gay people are all
types.”

Senior Allison Greenlee spoke
of using the Davidson FLAG net-
work to feel more comfortable with
her sexuality. After the sexuality

forum her sophomore year, she
wrote Meg Jones, who had spoken
at the forum, a letter. Greenlee
said, ‘Anytime you: know there.is
somebody else who is in the same
situation that you are, it makes it
easier.”

Amy Bertram, a 1994 gradu-
ate, explained how her classes at
Davidson helped in the process of
discovering her sexuality. “I be-
gan questioning my sexuality when
writing papers last year at Davidson
.... now I look at my journal en-
tries, and I’m amazed I didn’t put
two and two together.”

Bertram described how she
encounters problems when she and
her current girlfriend are together.
“Any time that Allison and I show
any form of affection, even from
good friends, we get some kind of
flack ... it’s a real uncomfortable
thing for some people. We try not
to flaunt it, but sometimes I wantto
hold the hand of the person I am
dating.” :

In response, Dougherty said,
“Tt takes time to work through that.
Holding hands might be a jerk to
their system, but maybe that’s a
jerk that they need.”

Sophomore Zac Lacy kept the
mood light with his witty insights,
especially when responding to a
question asking why he uses the
word “faggot.” “I use those words
because they’ re descriptive. Iused
the word ‘fag’ for 19 years before
I realized I was one.”

Lacy also spoke about the
Davidson community. “These
people sitting at this table are the
only openly gay students [at

Davidson]. That is the definition
of repressive. I have to go else-
where to find a social life within

more open dialogue. That is the

way you lead to less repression.”

After two hours of dealing with
issues ranging from homosexual
marriages to having children to
Biblical issues, the tone of the par-
ticipants, which had ranged from
giddy to frustrated, ended on an
upbeat note.

Jones, who could be called the
mother of the Sexuality Forum,
says there is still room for more
discussion: “Those people are ba-
sically the only people who are
willing to come out to more than
two or three people. There are

people sitting out in the audience
who are not quite so open. One of
the keys to this whole issue is to

. have: visible: role-models- ..,..
' Davidson can’t go back. TI feel

good that this movement or what-
ever you want to call it will con-
tinue.”

Jones, who is leaving
Davidson to attend graduate school,
says, “Those people yelling and
clapping for them wouldn’t have
happened three years ago. That
was the neatest thing I observed
sitting in that room: there wasn’t
that tension.

“T hope that the sexuality fo-
rum will continue to happen and
that people will care enough to
make it happen.”
