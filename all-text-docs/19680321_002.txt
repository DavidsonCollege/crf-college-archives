Admissions Policy:
Short Of Tokenism

A check with the Admissions Office
reveals the not-so-startling news that
Davidson College, the progressive, in-
novative, Blue-Skying educational
leader of the South, has so far admit-
ted a total of one Negro to the Class
of '72.

About four Negroes, three of them
athletes, are still under consideration.
One Negro has already been rejected.

Since only about half those accepted
normally enroll, the black student
seems to run the risk of extinction at
Davidson, except for the saving graces
of.the Athletic Department.

It seems passing strange that Da-

‘Progressive’
Leadership

The latest tabulation of Negro —
voter registration in the South °
reveals a great deal about North ~
Carolina, that “progressive South-
ern leader.” 1

The Tar Heel state ranks dead :

last.

Not only that, but the state is
also last in the number of elected
Negro officials, according to the f
latest bulletin from the Southern
Regional Council’s voter educa-
tion bulletin.

“It has been usual when dis-
cussing things Southern,” the
news letter says, “to put Missis-
sippi at the bottom and North
Carolina somewhere near the top
... It is apparent that changes
are underway in the South.”

It’s changes like those we hate
to see. Now, progressive North
Carolina, what are you going to
go about it?

ST AE

OT SAIN OE GEE DY RGA:

vidson should have no more black
students than it does, since it serves
primarily an area with a large per-
centage of Negroes. The occasional
black student has the status of a
mirage. We have not even reached the
plateau of successful tokenism.

So the Admissions Office, with all
the aplomb of a professor’s three-year-
old daughter offering a mud pie to a
sophomore, presents us with the in-
formation that qualified Negro appli-
cants to Davidson are about as rare
as dodo birds.

Reasons: most black students intelli-
gent enough to get into Davidson can
also get into Ivy League schools with
hefty scholarships,.More important is
the lack of social opportunities at Da-
vidson — limited for whites, practical-
ly nonexistent for blacks. After visit-
ing New Haven and Boston, few bright
Negroes are impressed with upper
Mecklenburg County.

In the midst of a racially troubled
time in an area outstanding for its
racial problems, Davidson College is
evading the responsibility it has to the
nation and to the South to educate and
develop responsible Negro leadership.

To move into the last third of the
twentieth century at the rate it should,
the college is going to have to educate
black men in the South and for the

uth.

It will certainly require an active
recruiting program and perhaps a
system of remedial courses to prepare
those who come from inferior secon-
dary schools.

If an amount of time, effort and
money equal to that the Athletic De-
partment spends recruiting jocks each
year went into searching the South
for capable Negro high school stu-
dents, maybe Davidson could reach
the status of full token integration.

And maybe we could find a few
Jews, too.

The Elections Fiasco

The scrapping of Monday’s election
was bad enough, but not nearly so bad
as a lot of other incidents connected
with this month’s elections.

Forgotten
Platforms

|
Political platforms always seem *
' to change, especially around here. *

During the campaign, the can- %
didate’s platform is of primary
importance. Hundreds of them,

- each Sursting with insight and
big ideas, are plastered all over
& campus.
But once elected, the candidate ¢
seems to push his platform aside
and forget his promises. And, %
consequently, nothing much gets
done.

A change is needed, and we
intend to help it along.

_ We've been carefully saving the
platforms of all the election win-
ners this spring, and during the
coming year, we plan to pull them
out every now and then and see
-if our leaders are actually doing
what they said they'd do.

If they aren't, we'll merely
remind them of it, gently.

Walter Lingle’s letter on this page,
gratifying in one respect, nonetheless
does not alter the basic question con-
cerning the trustees’ rule that the
president of Davidson must be a Pres-
byterian.

It boils down to this: the next presi-
dent will be a Presbyterian, unless the
trustees cannot find a suitable man.
Then, and only then, would they
broaden their search.

But, we ask, why not open the selec-
tion process from the start? The trus-
tees can undoubtedly find a qualified
Presbyterian. But it’s even more likely
they can find other men, equally or
better qualified, in the ranks of other
denominations.

Statistics tell the story.

According to a recent edition of the
“Yearbook of American Churches,”
there are some 125 million church
members in the United States today.

Of that number, slightly over 69
million are Protestants; and of those,
4.3 million — or 6.23 per cent — are

The handling of the elections has
been shoddy, to say the least, and most
of the blame for it should rest square-
ly on the Student Council and its
Elections Committee.

On at least one occasion a polling

place was left completely unmanned,
with unmarked ballots left out where
any passer-by could reach them.
‘ At least once the polling place in
Chambers was closed during official
voting hours, a clear-cut violation of
the bylaws.

Regularly ballots were being count-
ed before the polls were officially
closed, a violation of elections proced-

ure,

And worst of all, at least two poll
workers were openly telling students
how to vote. Ironically, one of them
was the same one who just last month
was encouraging students at the polls
to vote against the new Student Gov-
ernment Association Constitution.

You can explain away Monday's
invalid election to oversight, if you're
generous, but no amount of generosi
can alter the other flagrant -
ties that the Elections Committee has
permitted to go on.

It is a sad commentary indeed on
the state of student government here
when a student committee runs an
election as if Davidson were the state
of Mississippi.

Maybe Monday's ballots aren’t the
only things that ought to be scrapped.

Trustees’ Slim Pickings

Presbyterians.

Six per cent. It doesn't take a math
major to figure out that the trustees
are passing over 94 per cent of Ameri-
ca’s Protestants in making their all-
important choice.

We're familiar enough with the ar-
guments for restricting ourselves to
Presbyterians. We realize that there
are a number of outstanding Presby-
terian college presidents around and
that perhaps a Presbyterian president
would have a slight advantage in fund-
raising and in relations with the Pres-
byterian Church. We’ll even go so far
as to concede that Davidson’s previous
presidents —. all Presbyterians, natur-
ally — were capable men.

But statistics speak louder than any
of those arguments.

If we limit ourselves to that meager
six per cent in our selection we are

denying Davidson the full opportunity .

job.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Two Students Laud
Team, Coach, Fans

To The Editor:

It seems as if every letter
to you involves a criticism
of one kind or another—just
possibly it's time that this
medium of communication be
used for another purpose.

I have never written a let-
ter to the editor during my
entire four years at David-
son probably because I have
seldom thought my feelings
on a particular issue merited
the print or the space.

But Saturday night in Ra-
leigh I had an_ experience
that to me merits much more
than the space that this paper
or any other media of com-
munsication could give it.

For four years people have
been telling me about a nebu-
lous concept often referred to
as the ‘Davidson spirit.” I
had been doubly concerned
because although I had never
experienced this burning zeal
myself, I felt that I had wit-
nessed it in the loyalty of an
uncountable number of alum-
ni.

But Saturday night in Ra-
leigh E not only witnessed it
and felt it—I was part of it—
a group of gutty young men
playing their hearts out,
cheerleaders yelling their
faces blue, a band blowing
over the cheers of 10,000 UNC
fans, and Davidson support-
ers cheering and waving, fus-
sin’ and cussin’ .. . Then a
buzzer sounded and a dream
faded away.

But the cheers didn't die—
first a cheer for Davidson
that was probably louder than
any during the game (if that's

itorial, ‘Trustees’ Rule: Ask-

fog for a Second Stringer?”,
may I say to you and your
readers what we have al-
ready said in a letter to your
student committee, namely:

“You can be sure that we
are not as a committee go-
ing to recommend the elec-
tion of a man as President
of Davidson whom we do
not feel to be highly com-
petent just because we
have been lmited in our
search to Presbyterians. If
we should ever find our-
selves in that position, I
am sure that our commit-
tee will be the first to rec-
ommend a change in the
restriction.””

Incidentally, it might be an
Anteresting exercise for you
to obtain from Dr. Carleton
Chapman a list of the “very
few men whom he would con-
sider to be great college pres-
idents in the United States to-
day’ and then ascertain how
many of them are Presby-

possible); cheers for a group
of players who never once
gave up, never once stopped
fighting; cheers for a fine
coach whom possibly we have
buried in so much criticism
that we forget just how much
he has contributed to this
school.

Weil, it's kind of hard to
describe without being overly
sentimental, but I was proud
as hell and I know that two
or 3,000 other people in that
coliseum were just as proud.

Proud not only of a fine
coach and a great basketball
team, but most of all proud
to be a part of Davidson
College.

To The Editor:

I learned something new
at the Eastern Regionals in
Raleigh last Saturday night.
I already knew that our boys
were fine people who would
not let the petty rivalry and
bickering of the fans make
them play a “grudge game.”’

For some reason, though, I
wasn't sure how Lefty would
act during and after the game
(if we lost, especially).

My doubts proved unfound-
ed. He behaved like a big
man, in the deepest sense of
the word. Most of us have
never wanted anything so
badly as he, his staff and the
team wanted that game: yet
all of them controlled their
grief Uke gentlemen, even

after being close to victory.

Lefty's move of congratu-
lating Rusty Clark for his
wreat game was the move of
a sportsman, and, for some
reason, I'm not at all sure a
Dean Smith or a/Larry Mil-
ler, had U.N.C. lost, would
have been able to show such
bigness.

I hope that our coaching
staff and team can continue

to be the great sports and’

fierce competitors that they
were in Raleigh and all year.

The whole student body
could well express in the fu-
ture its appreciation of this
kind of Davidson basketball
by refraining from hooting
and waving at fouled-out op-
ponents, from screaming dur-
ing attempted foul shots, and
from any booing of an oppos-
ing player or -oach,

I have been as guilty or
more so of this type of
“cheering’’ as any student
here.. However, the com-
pletely undeserved boos
which Lefty got at Saturday's
game from U.N.C. fans made
me want for Davidson to dis-
tinguish itself by the sports-
manship of its fans, coaches,
and team, from such schools
as U.N.C., Duke and Vander-
bilt.

Next year’s Eastern Re-
gionals will be an excellent
opportunity for us to do this.
but for now all we can do is
thank Wildcat basektball for
giving us such a great sea-
son.

By HEYWARD CARTER
Associate Editor

One Big Computer Date

It is never very hard to find someone who can list -
all of what he feels are Davidson’s faults, while extol-
ling the virtues of another school. All of us have done

some tim it usually runs more to useless com-
plaining than Valfible criticism because few of us
know enough about any other college to really offer a
valid comparison. . .

I war talking the other day, though, to a friend
who had gone to Davidson for two years, was In Mont-
pellier last year with the Junior Year Abroad Program,
and then transferred to Amherst as a Junior this year.
In light of the fact that Davidson claims to seek a place
among the best smail colleges in the nation, or even as
THE best small college, a comparison between David-

-son and Amherst seems to be fair. Amherst has only

about 200 more students than Davidson, is in an isolat-
ed, “academic” environment (ie., is in the middle of
nowhere), and is certainly highly regarded among
small colleges. ;

The major difference my friend stressed was the
freedom that was so much a part of life at Amherst
but which was almost totally lacking, in comparison,
here. The freedom he talked about was not only that
of a wet campus and open dorms, but primarily that of
intellectual interest. A student is given as much lee-
way as he can handle in deciding for himself what is
important in a course. He is not only permitted but
encouraged to branch out into his special fields of in-
terest because he is given more free time to pursue
these interests. .

Amherst, he said, is easier than Davidson, but it
is easier because the lists of minutia and facts that are
easy to test a student on and which comprise most of
the courses at Davidson are not a part of the Amherst
system of teaching. The emphasis is more on thinking
than parrotting. oe

“So what,” you say; “Davidson is moving in this
direction with the new curriculum and more emphasis
on independent study and seminars.” True—Davidson
is finally moving in this direction and this will take us
a long way to catching “wp with schools like Amherst,
but as much as or more than a new curriculum David-
son needs a new of student. There just plain aren’t
a whole lot of individuals at Davidson and those who
are real individuals learn that they'd better keep it to _
themselves if they want to get along around here . . .
or at least that they’d better be an acceptable type of
individual. ;

But at Amherst there are so many diverse types
on campus they make the Davidson student body look ~
like one big computer date — which, in effect, it is.
Black power leaders, racists, magicians, . . . anything
isa part of the student group there. “Everyone,” as he

t it, “has got something special, and he shows it.

at’s what makes them such amazing people.” It is
also what makes our student body, when compared to
theirs, look more like a student corpse.

My object is not to praise Amherst or to encourage
anyone to transfer, but it is, rather, to point out that
we do have quite a way to go in the areas of student
freedom and student personality before we can ser-
iously call ourselves the best small college in the na-
tion. We do have certain disadvantages, such as loca-
tion and lack of funds (even with Amherst’s large en-
dowment the tuition and expenses amount to $4,000
per year) but these certainly are not too serious to be
overcome. We can overcome them, and I believe that

we will

But it will help us a great deal if we keep our eyes

on schools of the caliber of Amherst and, if not imitate
them, at least learn from them.

Kearfott: ‘Look At World’

cross through my mind: why
don’t. those people realize
that this world is too damn
big, with too many problems
that we've got to solve if it's
going to be worth living in?

The thing which prompted
this letter was a recent arti-
cle in THE DAVIDSONIAN
on student leadership, and in
particular, on the Richardson
Fellows program.

To its director, Mike Mooty,
a little piece of advice: If
you want to train your lead-
ers, send them to the slums,
not the banks; have them live
in the filth of an Appalachian
mining town; send them to
Afghanistan or Mozambique
or rural Mississippi.

Because, Mike, you can't
teach them to be leaders un-
til you teach them the prob-
lems, until you force into
their tightly sealed minds
that being a leader is not be-
ing president of the SGA or
a member of ODK: but in-
stead it is being one who
understands what's really
happening in this world and
is so sickened by the sight
of it he vows with everything
that's in him that he's going
to try and change it.

If you want leaders, Mike,
open their eyes and make
them really take a good look
at this world, make them see
what's happening beyond the
steps of Belk dormitory.

Then you'll have your lead-
ers, Mike, for if they once
realize what's really going on
all around them, then becom.
ing that company executive
won't mean a thing to them.

The only thing that will
make a damn to them will
be to change this world we

live in, to clean out those
dirty rotten spots; and they'll
lead others toward this goal.
‘And so, Mike, can you
teach your boys leadership?

The fact is simple, though
tragic, that it cannot be at-
tained at Davidson College.

A beginning can indeed be
made there, not through your
committees or your officers.
but through those books that
gather dust on the shelves
and those professors, though
few in number. who would
give up all their degrees to
see genuine thought on just
a few of those faces before
them. :

But it can only be a begin-
ning there, for this key to
leadership is understanding
and can come fully only
through seeing the world and
through fighting to compre-
hend the picture it repre-
sents.

To find that understanding,
you've got to get away from
Davidson College and the
closed society of white racism
which it breeds (albeit un-
knowingly and undesiringly)
through its acceptance of an
academic community almost
totally white, Protestant and
““pure-blooded.”’

Sure, Mike, you can train
your boys to be the president
of Wachovia Bank or the
head of Burlington Mills.

But just make sure you
also train them to close their
eyes when their Cadillacs roll
past the skinny iittle black
kid with the funny eyes—the
eyes that don't shine like a
kid's eyes should, those eyes
without hope,
