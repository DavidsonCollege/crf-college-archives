2 Scholarships
Left For Cagers

Only two basketball schotar-
ships are available for next
year's freshman team, Coach
Lefty Driesell revealed this
week,

Curresntly 13.8 scholarships
are allotted to basketball. ac-
cording to Dr. Tom Scott. ath-
letic director. One scholarship is
now vacant due to Scott Sin-
nock’s quitting the team. More
scholarship funds, equivalent to
eighth-tenths of a scholarship.
are being added to the basket-
ball fund from the Living En-
dowment.

‘‘Most major college teams
have 20 scholarships,”’ Driesell
said. ‘‘Lack of scholarships has
been our problem as long as I've

been here. I think we ought to
have at least 16."

The new scholarship is being
added this year because of a
three-year program to increase
athletic scholarships from the in-
crease in the Living Endowment.
All athletic grants are controlled
by the Faculty- Scholarship Com-
mittee.

Football also benefits from the
scholarship increase. There will
be 47.7 football awards available
this year. up from last year's
45.4, according to Scott.

“Athletic scholarship funds are
a constant percentage of the Liv-
ing Endowment. They are being
increased due to the increase in
the endowment.” Scott said.

The Wildkittens’ blitz began

adding five, the ‘Kittens spurted

‘We're running things differ-

Coaches Express Concern
Over Present PE Program

(tn this second of a three-
part series on physical educa-
tion at Davidson, the writer
presents and examines the
general opinions of the group
of men who know physical ed-
ucation at Davidson best, the
coaching staff.)

By Tom CooK
Sports Editor

Though they are generally
concerned with the welfare
of their individual sports,
most of the coaches who
teach physical education
want to do a good job, bet-
ter than the one they are do-
ing now.

Where there are student com-
plaints, many of the coaches
sympathize with them and want
to make the program more than
the hour's exercise that it is
now.

The general plan of the PE
program is to introduce a fresh-
man to four sports which he can

use in his later life. One might
not classify wrestling in this
category, but it is a sport in
which the conditioning is valu-
able, as are the running and new
skills used in soccer. Often, in-
troduction to these two sports is
the means by which students de-
cide to pursue a sport further at
the freshman intercollegiate lev-
el.

Heath Whittle, assistant direc-
tor of PE, admitted. “The stu-
dents have a legitimate gripe
about the program. I feel it can
be improved over the present.”
He cited problems of overcrowd-
ing of certain periods, shying
away from Saturday periods and
the problem of absentee coach-
es.

“New coaches are brought
with the understanding that they
will teach PE. But it is not
their prime interest."" Whittle
agreed with others who favored
hiring one or two men who
would concentrate on PE and in-
tramurals, thus releasing coach-
es from many of their PE du-

i| ties.

DeMoisey Pulls Off Hair-Raising Movs

Of the general attitude of the
coaches, one of the areas which
drew criticism last week, Coach
Dick Short noted, “It's hard to
go down and get involved when
you are thinking about what you
are getting paid for. Physical
education has definitely improv-
ed since I was in school. Under

‘1Coach (Joe) Hunt (former as-

| ig py

LL

sistant cage coach), we had a
lot of fun until basketball start-
ed, then we hardly met. We
didn’t get much done,”

Most of the coaches are con-
cerned with the motivation of
the program. Harry Fogleman
declared, “The time students
spend here is worth something.”

HATTIE'S

“just up the road. .”

Fogleman proposed that the
graduation requirements in qual-
ity points and semester hours be
increased by two each to 126
and that PE adopt a grading
system with each semester
worth one-half semester hour.

Along with this, Fogleman said
he thought the same cut system
as the college uses, 25 per cent
(or 11 PE cuts), should be adopt-
ed. Coach Tom Stevens favored
retention of the present cut sys-
tem because ‘‘when you count
up all the free cuts, you get
about as many as most classes.”

Fogleman's system would in-
clude offering certain classes at
specific hours so that students
could choose their activities.
Tennis, golf. swimming and
handball would be required. Ste-
vens favored an improved swim-
ming program with higher re-
quirements. Fogleman favored a
return to the grading system
while Stevens preferred the pres-
ent pass-fail system.

All of the coaches are concern-
ed with the attitudes of their
students toward their activity.
Coach Tom Couch stated, “I'd
like to sit down with the guys
and talk to them about their
sport and talk about the rules,
fundamentals and skills involv-
ed.”

The department's opinion of
the tests required for satisfac-
tory completion of the course
was varied. Dr. Tom Scott, di-
rector of athletics and physical
education, said, ‘‘There’s not a
good reason to have the tests
or even to have the book. There
is probably a better appreciation
if they know the game, and the
book has all the reference ma-
terial.”

Most of the instructors in the

department admitted that the
main value of the tests lays in
the necessity of knowing some-
thing about the sport in order
to pass the quarter. A problem
was that the tests were taken
very lightly and different coach-
es professed to different consid-
erations of their value.

Fogleman turned to another
aspect of the PE program when
he stated, “Athletics has become
such a vital part of American
life that each person ought to
be trained in the working of the
body and the administration of
his hometown athletes.’’ Brown,
a physical education major like
Fogleman, noted, ‘‘Here, there's
no way for a person who wanted
to be a coach to get a certifi-
cate.” Seeing this problem as
motivational. Brown expressed
a desire to establish enough
courses for a prospective teach-
er to get his athletic certificate.
Scott agreed that this expansion
would be desirable. but doubted
that there would be sufficient de-
mand for such courses to sup-
port them presently.

All of the coaches were ada-
mant in their desire to improve
their own performances in PE.
Couch remarked, “The program
as it is now, fits the needs of
the college. But I feel that, even
if you have to have more class-
es, you ought to have smaller
classes.” Stevens concluded,
“The boys’ attitude may be bad
when they get here. but we just
need to do better teaching of
skills. For what the program is
designed for, to make the guys
come down here. it is accom-
plishing its purpose. I guess we
just want a little better pro-
gram.”

Meditations .

MASKED MARVEL

With the Southern Conference Tournament only a
few weeks away, Lefty’s Fabuldus Five may be happy for
once that this conference’s representative at the NCAA
competition must be the winner of the post-season play-
offs.

There has been an infamous conference tradition
that the winner of the tournament is never the team
which finishes on top after the regular season play. But
the hapless quintet that always seemed to get the axe in
the bowels of Charlotte Coliseum was the Wildcats. And
lurking in the wings were the cagers from West Virginia,
who always seemed ready to swoop up the honors.

But this year the Morgantownies are top dogs,
while the Dixie Darlings fram Davidson have stum-
bled into the race for the second slot. The rubes from
West Virginia have dodged revenvers and poverty
workers long enough to whip six conference oppon-
ents while losing to only one—Davidson.

If the traditional jinx holds true this year, the Moun-
taineers won't even leave the Coliseum with their white-
lightning, much less the conference title. But this season
there is someone else ready to capitalize on a Mountain-
eer miscarriage. That team is William and Mary.

The Indians have been on the warpath ever since
Davidson assistant coach Warren Mitchell cashed in his
Cat claws for a warbonnet and went to a new calling
where the wampam was just a bit greener and the status
a bit higher.

Mitchell has managed to fire up his team which,
under the leadership of Ron Panneton, has knocked off
seven conference opponents and lost to only four. The
Indians now. stand second in the conference. Their recent
scalping of Davidson's quint showed the rest of the con-
ference family that they are not afraid of the Coliseum,
and that they can hand any team, even hometown David-
son, a licking there on any given night.

__ Mitchell knows his opposition well. Mitchell and West
Virginia are old foes. And of course, he has one advantage
over Davidson that no other coach has—he helped recruit
and train nearly every man on the Wildcat roster. He
knows their strengths and weaknesses, and will, no doubt,
use his knowledge well,

s e * s ¢

Since, no doubt, the platitude factory on the second
floor of the gym will soon be mouthing this bit of news
from coast-to-coast, we will scoop the black-haired baron
of ... and say it first—Rod Knowles seems to have found
his old touch and is looking like the player he really is.

Marquette Coach Al McGuire called Knowles
“the best big man” he had seen all season after the
6-9 junior bagged 27 points against McGuire‘s team.
Last week against Richmond Knowles garnered seven

ints early in the first half before Driesell benched
im with three fouls. In the second-half Knowles
bagged another 15 points before fouling out.

The tri-captain center fouled out against William
and Mary, but not before adding 22 points to the Wildcat
totals. More and more he has been looking like the Rod
Knowles who tore apart Rhode Island last year in the
eastern regionals.
