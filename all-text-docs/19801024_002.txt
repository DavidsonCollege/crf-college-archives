courses to fulfill the require-
ment.

In Area II (Religion and
Philosophy) students would
have to pass one basic philoso-
phy course and two religion
courses, one of which must be

“concerned primarily with the
Christian faith.'’ Presently a
student may take three religion
courses. The committee report
recommended the mandatory
philosophy course in order that
students be ‘introduced to sys-
tematic thinking about the na-
ture of reality and human
values.’’ The requirement of one
Christian religion course, the
report said, is in line with
Davidson’s statement of pur-
pose.

In Area III (Mathematics
and Science) students would
have to pass two courses, one of
which must be in natural sci-
ence. A course taken to demon-
strate the mathematics compe-
tency would not count toward
this requirement.

In Area IV (History and
Social Science) students would
have to pass three courses: a
Western history survey course,
a basic economics course, and a
basic course in anthropology,
political science, psychology, or
sociology.

In the new Area V (Non-
Western Studies) students
would have to pass one course
from a list of approved non-
Western courses. This ‘‘ac-
quaintance with the non-West-
ern world,” the report stated, is
“‘an essential part of a liberal
education.’’ Possible examples
of non-Western courses include
Civilization of South Asia, Hin-
duism, Chinese Philosophy, and
Chinese Politics. A non-West-
ern course could also satisfy
another distribution require-
ment.

Students must satisfy the
competency and distribution
requirements early, according
to the report. By the end of the
junior year students should
have completed all but the
fourth term of the language
requirement and two courses of
the distribution requirements.
One advantage of students’

. taking core courses early is that
they ‘‘will be more likely to
bring a common background of.
knowledge and experience to

_ upper-level courses,” the report

EPC members ‘described. the

proposal as a clarification of:
Davidson’s goals rather than a

substantive policy change. “It

‘really isn’t that radical,”

French Department Chairper-
son Hallam Walker said, Center

for Special Studies Dean Frank -
Bliss described the changes as.

“making a good thing better.”

As I see the proposal,”’ Bliss
said, ‘‘we have attempted to
encourage a less specialized
undergraduate education, to
improve basic skills generally,
to tilt a bit more toward
requirements than toward elec-

tives, and to increase interdis-

ciplinary and _ international
awareness.”
“We think it’s a good plan,”
Purcell said, ‘‘with one excep-
tion.’’ The exception is the
addition of a fourth term to the
language requirement, which

Purcell and Medlin protested in

a minority report.

_. year language

In their report, the two
student committee members ar-
gued that the first three terms
of language instruction could be
made more effective. The addi-
tion of a fourth term, they felt,
would lower the quality of upper
level courses, discourage stu-
dents from beginning a new
language, reduce elective op-
tions, and place an undue strain

‘on the language departments.

The additional requirement
‘‘would hurt students really

_ motivated with the language,”’

Medlin said. ‘‘The whole pro-
gram needs to be looked at,”
Purcell added. Medlin pointed
out that the French Department
has recently made some chan-
ges in the French 20 program,
adding more emphasis on oral
skills. Such changes ‘‘need to be
done first,’’ she said. ‘“Three
terms should be sufficient,’’
Purcell concluded.

The other members of the
EPC, however, were unani-
mously in favor of the addition
of a mandatory fourth term.
The United States, their report
stated, ‘‘is no longer in a
position to dictate to the world
on its own terms.”

‘‘Three terms isn’t enough
time to achieve the command of
language which we want stu-
dents to have,"’ Bliss said, ‘‘It
takes time, not only good
courses.”’

Walker pointed out that the
fourth term competency course
will not be identical to existing
fourth term courses taken by
majors. ‘‘We expect to create
courses which would take into
account the interests ‘of people
in other areas, such as econo-
mics, politics, and history,’’
Walker said, ‘‘We want this to
be a means of showing people
that their command of the
language can be of use to
them.”’

While the committee’s report
specifies that the fourth term
course must be taken at David-
son, Zimmerman said it would
“not be contrary to the spirit”
of the proposal to allow excep-
tional students with strong
foreign language literature
backgrounds to pass out of the
fourth term course.” ,

Kelton pointed that Chapel

‘Hill has recently instituted a

two year language requirement,
although it previously had
none. Davidson, too, had a two

sent term system and ‘Blue —

Sky curriculum” in. the early

1960's. we .
~The language ‘requirement is

“not. a punitive measure,” Wal-

ker said,- ‘Nobody is really a

linguistic ¢ripple.’’ The pro-
posed change does, however,

‘“‘put the onus on the language

departments to do the job,” he

The increased number of stu-
dents taking history, philoso-
phy, and foreign languages will
“clearly’’ necessitate ‘‘a look at
the staffing situation,” Kelton
said..

- Zimmerman emphasized that
concerns about staffing. should
be secondary. “We want the
faculty to consider theses
changes on their educational
merits," he said, ‘“‘then we will
proceed to arrange the staffing
within reason, staffing should
be arranged to serve the pro-

gram rather than the program
arranged to serve staffing

needs.”’

Kelton said he thought the
proposals would require real-
location of faculty rather than
hiring of new professors. For
example. to cover increased stu-
dent demand for philosophy,
philosophy professors may have
to teach exclusively within their
department rather than in
Humanities or the Center for
Special Studies, in and of
themselves, the proposals will
not require that we go above
the present faculty limit of
100,"’ he said.

Walker said that, in the
long run, if the proposals are
approved, ‘‘inevitably there will
have to be some increase in
the staffs of departments af-
fected.’’

“There may be some with-
drawal of upperclass specialty
courses,’’ Zimmermann said,
since many of the.students now
taking these courses are non-
majors satisfying an area re-
quirement which they could sat-
isfy only with a basic course
in the proposed curriculum.
However, Zimmermann felt
that even if courses are drop-
ped the overall effect would
be beneficial. ‘‘Upperclass
courses are diluted in the pre-
sent arrangement by the need to
teach inexperienced underclass-
men.”

In the event that it becomes

necessary to drop a substantial
number of upperclass courses,
Bliss said, ‘‘we will have to
consider hiring additional facul-
ty members. This is important
because the committee does not
wish to weaken any department
major in any way.”

The proposed requirements
would be ‘“‘helpful’’ to prospec-
tive students, Medlin said.
While the ‘‘specificity of the
language might frighten few,
most would be grateful for
“such a well thought-out core
curriculum,”’ especially since ‘‘a
lot of students come’ not know-
ing what courses to take.”

The effect on.enrollment of
the new curriculum would be
minimal, according to Purcell.
‘I’m not sure graduate require-
ments affect anyone’s decision
to choose a school.” Zimmer-
mann agreed that few prospec-
tive students are very attentive
to academic regulations.

The only feature that might
affect prospective students
would be the language require-
ment,’’ Zimmermann said, but
no one knows what effect the
present requirements have. He
added that he hopes Chapel
Hill’s new language require-
ment will cause secondary
schools to place greater empha-

sis on foreign language instruc-

tion.

If the proposals are passed
and the new regulations printed
in the catalogue, Zimmermann

Odell said the station will
broadcast from 7 a.m. to mid-
night during its first week
operation according to the num-
ber of students willing to disc
jockey. If the station must
reduce its hours, morning pro-
gramming will be cut first,
Odell said.

The station’s programming
will be varied. Disc jockeys will
be free to choose what to play
within ‘‘vague guidelines,”’
Odell said. For instance, they
will not be permitted to play
loud acid rock in the early
morning.

Odell hopes WDSR will ex-

With several projects lined up
for the coming year, Davidson

_PIRG hopes to rekindle student '

interest. One such project is a
look into the practice of red-
lining, in which banks withhold
loans to certain areas due to
ethnic or economic make-up.
PIRG is also planning an
energy conservation survey of
on- and off-campus housing and
a forum dealing with toxic
wastes to follow up an investi-
gation into the dumping of
those wastes in North Carolina.

Following up on a survey
done in 1974, Davidson NC-
PIRG and Duke NC-PIRG have
been working on passing a bill

Davidson PIRG will encounter

years.

said, there would probably be
‘‘some means of warning all

. prospective freshmen, including

early decision students’’ about
them. Zimmermann added that
the catalogue does contain a
disclaimer that ‘‘academic_re-
gulations are subject to
change.”’

Zimmermann said that, while
the faculty will ‘‘almost certain-
ly’’ not vote on the proposals a
their November meeting, the
new core curriculum, if it is
approved, could be ready by the
February deadline. Kelton
pointed out that every new
course designed to fulfill the
new distribution requirements
would also have to be approved
by the faculty.

“I anticipate a great déal of
discussion,”’ Bliss said, ‘‘and
some counterproposals.”’

The proposed core curriculum
would not lead to major changes
in most students’ schedules,
according to the committee.
“It should not materially de-
crease the number of electives
that an average student takes,”’
Zimmeremann said.

“Students are going to have
to be more aware of require-
ments" if the proposal is ap-
proved, however, Purcell said.

Students will have some voice
in the outcome of discussions
concerning the proposals, Med-
lin said. ‘‘The main way they
will have input,”’ she said, ‘‘is
by talking to the faculty.”

pand in the future. For in-

stance, the station might buy a
telephone monitoring system
from WDAV. The system
would enable announcers to
broadcast from outside the sta-
tion via telephone lines to the
studio. With telephone monitor-

ing, the station could cover
sporting events taking place
both on and off campus.

The station’s staff wants to
expand the limited record li-
brary. They hope to buy high
quality used records at bargain
prices, Odell said.

Couple donates Blue
Ridge mountain retreat

By FRANCES PALMER
Staff Writer
A wealthy couple from Banner Elk has given a house in the Blue

Ridge mountains to the College.

Situated on one and a half acres on the eastern continental
divide, the house is approximately a two and a half hour drive from
Davidson. It has 9,000 square feet and seven bedrooms. The house

and property are valued at $300,000, according to Director of
_ Communications John Slater.

Slater said the College: would like to use the house as a retreat

and conference center. For example, Bill Bolding and the resident
-advisors used the house for a retreat in early September. However,
‘Slater said the College has not yet decided exactly what to do with
‘the house.

The house is completely unfurnished. Slater said they: hope to

"attract donations of furniture, linens, and kitchen utensils from
alumni. —

Slater said the College would like to hire a couple as resident
caretakers 80 the house would be available through out the winter

to various groups of students.

It is still uncertain whether the College will accomodate outside
groups because of the extensive furnishings and upkeep it would

require.

The College received the deed on October 8 from Mr. and Mrs.

Robert C. Schwebke.

‘College gets $350,000

- An anonymous alumnus has presented the College with a gift of
stock worth $350,000, according to Director of Special Resources

Julius Melton.

The stock was given in the form a gift annuity agreement. In
such-an agreement, the contributor continues to receive incomé

from the gift while he lives.

In this case, the alumnus will receive approximately $20,000
annually in mostly tax-exempt:income. At his death the entire fund

will go to Davidson.
