New
thriller
suspects .
the usual

By Ep AcLE

Hollywood. has lost faith in
the masses. How else can one
explain the recent plethora of films
which seem to have been designed
for the cinema-goers with the in-
tellect of Barney the Purple Behe-
moth? Gone by the wayside are
intelligent films which engage the-
ater-goers enough stay in their
minds longer than it takes the end
credits to roll. All too often these
days the movies studios are pro-
ducing are nothing but gorgeously
crafted pieces of eye-candy — ex-
pensive and fun to look at, but
ultimately as memorable as the
latest episode of “Full House.”
When a film as daring as The Usual

Suspects comes out, it is enough to
make anyone believe in the future
of the medium. Suspects is a first-
rate film — by far the best movie
I’ve seen this year.

The plot revolves around a
time-honored film noir set-up: a
crime has been committed, leav-
ing only one man standing at the

.end. It is up to the detectives
interrogating the surviving crimi-
nal to sort out the details of the
incident. From this simple frame
the screenwriter, Christopher
McQuarrie, ahd the director, Bryan
Singer, craft a film that takes all
the old conventions of the noir
genre and sneds them hurtling back
in the viewer’s face.

Verbal Kint (played magnifi-
cently by Kevin Spacey, only one
of a talented cast that includes
Gabriel Byrne, Chazz Palmenteri,
and, in his’first solid role, Stephen
“Not the Fat One” Baldwin) is the
“cripple” who has survived the
explosion aboard a ship which has
left more than 30 men dead. We
soon find out that Kint was one of
five criminals laying siege to the
ship that night. Learning how they
got there is half the fun.

It soon becomes clear that a
powerful criminal, Keyser Soze, is
pulling the strings that make these
men dance. Soze is no ordinary
criminal; he is a being of mythical
strength and. fury, a man whose
very name is spoken above a whis-
per only when death is imminent.
Part of the movie’s bravura touches
comes in the way the director de-
picts Soze as a shadowy being with-
out a face, aman who seems to live
off of the darkness which perpetu-
ally surrounds him.

As the five men continue on
their quest in Kint’s flashback, try-
ing to break free of Soze’s influ-

ence, they only find themselves

sinking deeper and deeper. De-
spite their best efforts, in the end

Senior Decor

Apartment art adds flare and style to student living

By JAMES BERRY

* The art of interior design re-
quires a keen eye, an open mind,
anda strong back. Itis an art rarely
appreciated but well practiced, and
the Davidson College campus is
no exception. The most potential
canvas lies down the hill at the
Martin Court senior apartments
where more space, more artists
(with four or five to an apartment),
and more opportunity for indi-
vidual expression always lead to
wonderful finished products. Pos-
sibly the most amazing character-
istic of this branch of the arts is the
fact that, while every carefully-
placed piece of furniture conveys
its own meaning and works within
the context of the remaining space,
the apartment itself doubles as a
living area, capturing form and
function ina stark freeze frame. It
is a balance not easily achieved
but, when successful, cannot be
surpassed in its raw emotional
power through any other media.

I had the opportunity to tour a
few of these artistic centers and
take in what they had to offer. My
first stop was in the cleverly titled
Building C, the abode of Katie
Schwab, Jennifer Reisenleiter,
Rosie Molinary, and Lylen Ferris.
Upon entering I was struck by the
vibrant colors.draped across every
available wall space. This cel-
ebrated collection of tapestry is the
product of years of careful pur-
chases in various parts of the world.
Each was hand-picked for its style
and elegance. The collection is not
limited to the strict definition of

tapestry but extends into the realm
of clothing as well. The curators
were kind enough to explain that
much of what I saw were in fact
skirts carefully placed to disguise
their utility. Even a pair of jeans
was added to the collection in this
fashion, decorating the end of the
hallway. Specially requested art-
work was also displayed in the
central living space. Another se-
cret I was fortunate enough to learn
was that each of these items came
into the hands of the owners di-
rectly from the artists, who hap-
pened to be boyfriends. In any
case, it is a marvelous collection
and one that should not be over-
looked.

My next destination proved to
be a mecca of style, intelligence,
and wit made one. The artists

responsible (Shannon Simmons,
Amy Burrows, Kelly Cunningham,
and Katie Rogers) obviously took
time in designing their masterwork.
The tufted-golden-velvet-swivel-
Simmons-family heirloom is only
one of three chairs in the living
room. Itis accompanied by a grand-
daddy-deep-ultramarine-high-
wingback chair. The third of the
chairs is a minimalist block chair
done in bone. Next to it stands
another exercise in minimalism: a
chrome glass-topped table that,
while simple, hints at the provoca-
tive in its curvature. The couch
dominates the space and draws the
room’s differences together. Mov-
ing to the kitchen we find a se-
quined peacock wall hanging and
a Nepalese paper lantern shade with
blue tassels. A tile mosaic serving

tray serves as the table’s center-
piece. A watercolor culinary herb
reference finishes off the collec-
tion with modest elegance.

Beth Lindsey, Heather
Wineberg, Kristi Cops, and Siouxz
Staff took a thematic approach with
their apartment. The living area
houses a fouton with an unresolved
southwestern pastel print mattress.
Pink and white satin throw pillows
with harlequin and ballerina pat-
terns finish off the piece nicely.
We now move into the aforemen-
tioned theme. As members of Rusk,
the four have done an impressive
job of displaying their eating house
mascot, the cow, all over the apart-
ment. The plates, bowls, and cof-
fee mugs all contain the bovine

The Thrilla from Manila

RenElvis visits Davidson for annual ‘50s dance

By JORDAN DEBREE
& Nick PAUL
Staff Writers

The most piercing questions
of the student body (e.g. Where the
hell is the career service office?
What time does brunch end? and
What is the meaning of life, or
lifetime credit?) are all eclipsed by
the one cyclopean yearning to get
inside the mind of RenElvis.

Your Faithful Reporters: I
guess you must have been asked
this many times before, but what’s
the scoop Rene? Why Elvis?

RE: He is the best example of
the American Dream. He came
from a poor family and rose to all
of this. (wild hand gestures)

YFR: Are you the only Fili-
pino Elvis impersonator?

RE: In America, yes. There
are three other Filipino Elvis im-
personators that live in the Philip-
pines. They are all my friends.

YFR: So Rene, how does the

family feel about this Elvis thing?

RE: Ask my mother.

At this point Elvis was
whisked away for another photo
shoot. Being the journalistic
schmucks that we are, we cornered
and cross-examined his mother.
Mrs. Elvis looked at us kindly.
What could she tell us about this
man, her son, who wore fake side-
burns and had gyrated his hips on
countless dance stages like these
for almost four years? Who is the
man behind the Man? She simply
responded, “It’s great,” graced us
with a beautiful smile and then
rattled off his tour schedule for the
next few months. She mentioned a
visit to California. We just couldn’t
pass this one up so we rushed over
to where RenElvis was serenading
a ten year Old girl.

YFR: Have you ever consid-
ered being a Flying Elvis?

RE: No, it’s too risky. I do
have several entrances in which I
use a Zip line to fly onto the stage

from above.

Elvis and the Caped Crusader
all in one ... wow.

RenElvis gave us a free copy
of RenElvis, the Unauthorized

Biography and showed us his CD.
Nick tried to swap his singing Elvis
car deodorizer for a CD, but Elvis
said he already had three of those.
You can’t help but be attracted toa

man like Rene. He exudes charm
and sophistication. Finally the two
of us were squeezed into his photo
session. We asked if RenElvis
wouldn’t mind sitting on the Harley
with the two of us on either side.
Gesturing to his crotch, he men-
tioned something about tight pants
and the last time he straddled a
chopper and kindly declined.
