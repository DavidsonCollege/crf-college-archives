Lovelies in Contest

Say, what’s wrong with you
guys? Are you bashful, lazy, or
spineless? Here’s the chance to
make a hit with your best girl,
bring fame and honor on her and
yourself, and make a stompin’ suc-
cess out of a new institution here
on the campus. You have the chance
to do all this, and yet you are re-
sponding about as enthusiastically
as you would to a summons to serve
twenty years in the Siberian salt
mines! How do you think your
lovely young lady friends would
feel if they found out that you didn’t
think enough of their physical

charms (which, we are told by re-[

liable sources, they spend much
money and more time enhancing
solely for the sake of your appre-
ciation) to bother entering her in a
beauty contest where she might re-
ceive formal and widespread recog-
nition for her beauty!

All kidding aside, the Pan-Hel-
lenic Council and the Dawidsonian,
who are cooperating to sponser this
beauty contest, hope that it will
turn out to be the success that it
certainly ought to be, and that it
will be continued as an annual af-
fair and become a part of that often
referred to Davidson tradition. It:
is a self evident fact that there is
certainly no deficit of lovely young
ladies squired and courted by the’

employed.”

AS RUSSIA SEES US...

Beginning with this issue the
DAVIDSONIAN will publish
a series of Russian cartoons
about the United States. These
cartoons originally appeared in
the Russian magazine KROK.
ODIL. They have since. been
published in book form by the
Public Affairs Press, in Wash-
ington, D. C., under the title of
“Out of the Crocodile’s Mouth.”
Since, at present KROKODIL
is the only humor magazine
published within the Soviet
Union; since over half of its
content matter is concerned -
with the sins of America; and
since, with this ever-increasing
flow of propaganda directed
toward the Soviet peoples, we
will soon no longer be able to
say, “It’s just the Polit-buro
that’s against us, the people
really like us’; the DAVID.
SONIAN, in the interest of our
national welfare and for the
benefit of Davidson students,
is publishing this series of Rus-
sian portrayals of the United
States of America.

With Catholics In

\Ousting Coca-Cola

(From The Christian Century)

Catholics and Communists have
at last found something on which
they can agree. They are both
against Coca-Cola. In the French
National Assembly. the Communists
combined on February 28 in a solid
bloc with the U,R. P. (the Catho-
lic Party headed by Premier Bid-
avet) to pass a bill giving the health
ministry power to exclude the
American soft drink from France.
The bill must be passed by the up-
per chamber before it becomes law
but if that body fails to do so, it
may be returned to the lower house
and there, if passed again, put on
the statute books. The bill does
not mention Coca-Cola by name,
merely giving the health ministry
power to keep out of the country
any beverage “made with vegeta-
bles, vegetable extracts, or any pro-
duct of vegetable origin.” But the
Catholic and Communist deputies

‘| who put it through made it clear it

was Coca-Cola they were after. An
amendment was adopted extending
the prohibition to overseas depart-
ments, which means that the soft
drink is also to be excluded from
North Africa; where it has be-
come popular with the Mosleums,
who are supposed to be total ab-
stainers. Newspaper reports indi-
cate that the U. R. P. voted against
Coca-Cola more in deference to
pressure from wine-producing re-
gions than for any reasons of church
teaching. The Communists joined in
simply to make trouble for our

own American interest in Europe. | mained

Both these strange Allies managed
to convince themselves, before the
debate ended, that, in the words of
one of the most passionate depu-
ties, “The whole landscape of
France is at stake.” Perhaps it was.

CLAWS FOR COMING SEASON

Coach Crowell Little graduated from the University of
North Carolina in 1938. From there he launched upon a varied
coaching and Army career, beginning at King’s Mountain
High School in 1938, and continuing as head football coach here
at Davidson in 1950 after a period of Army service. Coach

Little was at Kings Mountain High
School from September of '38 to
June of '39. From there he came
to Davidson as head freshman coach
under Head Coach Gene McEver.

In January, 1941, Coach Little
was drafted into the Army. He was

Coach Little said that he consid-
ered Davidson to be a fine school

with a high rating and that he

was happy to be connected with it.
He stated that he would “like to
bring Davidson's athletic prowness
up to its academic standing.” Coach
Little went further to say that he
felt sure that within a few years
Davidson could produce a team of
which the student. body and the

‘Talumni would be proud.

Commenting on last Saturday's
first annual Red-Black football
game, Coach Little said that he was
not too disappointed with the re-
sults. There were quite a few mis-
takes, some that were inexcusable
and some that can be improved
with practice. Coach Little was ex.
tremely pleased with the spirit
that was shown in this game. He
said that the team must have this
spirit in order to win.

Coach Little stated that he had
heard that there were some non-
participating football players on the
campus. He extends to them an in-
vitation to play football, and he as-
sures them that they will be given
every opportunity to show their
