David Mutchler:
Mathematics

By JANE HARPER
Staff Correspondent

David Mutchler joins the
math department at Davidson
this fall. Mutchler, who will be
here for one year, “is teaching
Calculus and Statistic and
Computers.

Mutchler has spent the last
eight years at the University of
Virginia where he earned both a
B.A. and a M.A. His first visit
to Davidson was in the spring
for an interview and he said that
the immediate friendliness of
the students struck him. He
also said that it was the only
campus he’d ever visited that
was pretty in the rain.

Mutchler appreciates the size
of the College, welcoming the
change from a large university.
The emphasis on teaching at
Davidson and the contact with
the students are two other
reasons for his coming here.
After this year is over he will
decide whether to continue
teaching or go into computer
programming.

When he is not teaching,
Mutchler likes to ski and to play
bridge. He said that he is tired
of losing at his newest game,
blackjack, and hopes for a
change of luck soon.

Ann McMillan:
English

Features Editor

Ann McMillan’s only previ-
ous contact with Davidson was
a great-uncle who attended in
1900. ‘‘I’m not sure that he
graduated, but he did attend.”
Apart from this, everything
about Davidson is new to her.

As assistant professor in the
English department, McMillan
is teaching Introductory Survey
and freshman Composition this
term. Her academic career in-
cludes an undergraduate degree
from Agnes Scott and graduate
degrees (M.A. & PhD.) from
Indiana University. ,

McMillan’s pastimes include
studying Chaucer’s works (par-
ticularly ‘‘The Nine Female
Worthies’’ and ‘‘Legend of
Good Women") and collecting
tacky T-shirts. Says she of this
latter interest, ‘‘I don’t have
that many, but they sure are
tacky.'’ She also edited an
environmental study in gradu-
ate school.

McMillan now resides in
Davidson, but hails from Col-
umbus, Georgia.

Cynthia Lewss:
English

By JEFF HERRIN
Features Editor

When asked about her past-
imes, Cynthia Lewis talks ex-
citedly of Hairy Buffaloes and
Prairie Fires. No, she is not
suffering from delusions of
Western adventure: she also
speaks knowledgeably of Black
Russians and Hurricanes.

Cynthia Lewis enjoys bar-
tending, and has tended bars
professionally, even teaching
the trade at Harvard. In addi-
tion to this interest, she enjoys
singing in the church choir,
playing the piano, upholstering
furniture, and, in her words,
“piddling around the house.”

Asked for a relevent com-
ment, Lewis said, ‘‘I hate
cooking.’’ But not to worry.
Said she: “I love having stu-
dents over for parties, and I'll
get food from somewhere.”’

Lewis, who is unmarried,
received her B.A. from Ohio
State and her M.A. and PhD.
from Harvard. She is presently
teaching Humanities and En-
glish composition, and expects
to be teaching several courses
on Shakespeare, her ‘‘speci-
alty."" She came to Davidson
because she likes the atmos-
phere and so far has not been
disappointed.

Oh yes, about the Prairie
Fire. Cynthia Lewis tells me it
goes like this: add a half-bottle
of Tabasco sauce to a glass of
Tequila, then offer someone a
dollar to drink it. ‘Usually they
won't, but when they do, it’s
worth the dollar."’

Peter Venturelli:
Sociology

By FRANCES PALMER
Staff Correspondent

Peter J. Venturelli is a new-
comer to the South as well as to
Davidson. He has joined the
Sociology department on a reg-
ular appointment and is pre-
sently teaching Introduction to
Sociology. Later in the year he
will teach Urban Sociology and
a course entitled Deviants. '

Venturelli grew up in a small
northern Italian community
and obtained his degree from
Illinois State University. He is
currently nearing the comple-
tion of a PhD.

The atmosphere here, with
the small town and small stu-
dent body, was one reason
Venturelli came to Davidson.
He also likes the combined
emphasis that the College
places on teaching and research.

Venturelli, his wife, and their
ten month-old son Phillip like
the Davidson Community so
far. However, they miss the
diversity that a big city has to
offer. Venturelli's interests in-
clude urban sociology, race and
ethnicity, and social psycho-
logy. In his spare time he
enjoys cooking, photography,
and jazz and classical music.

In June of this year, the
Midwest Sociological Commit-
tee awarded Venturelli the Er-
nest W. Burgess Award. The
award was a result of Ventur-
ellis research on the study of
ethnic communities.

environment associated with
Davidson.

Sutton hopes to encourage
students interested in foreign
studies to pursue their desires,
as he did, by spending time
abroad in study. His interests
include outdoor sports and
music, and he belongs to the
Oratorial Singers of Charlotte.

Although he enjoys city life,
Sutton is glad to be back in

having ‘‘fun.”’

French

By SHANNON ANDERSON

Alan Singerman is a visiting
professor in the French depart-
ment here at Davidson this
year. Hailing from the Univer-
sity of Maine in Orono, Maine,
Singerman is teaching French

the non-academic side he is
enthusiastically assisting Ster-
ling Martin in organizing a
fencing club at Davidson, as
well as teaching some of the
fencing classes.

French during high school. ‘'I
was supposed to start taking
Latin, but I outright refused to
and took French instead,” he
said.

Singerman first became inter-
ested in Davidson because of its
high academic reputation and
he greatly admires the study
abroad program here: ‘‘It is
fabulous, absolutely fabulous. I
am especially impressed with
the institution’s commitment to
study abroad and with the
number of students taking ad-
vantage of this tremendous and
unique opportunity.’’ He also
appreciates the demanding aca-
demic structure of Davidson
and the type of student it
draws, ‘‘I work best with this
type of student,’’ he explained,
“interested and aware of the
demands that confront him.”

Singerman studied at the
Sorbonne in Paris for two years,
in Strasbourg for one year, in
Freiburg for a year, and lived in
Brittany for three years. Ob-
taining his B.A. in math at
Ohio University, he had a
double major in math and
French. ‘Mr. Singerman” be-
came ‘‘Dr. Singerman’”’ in 1970
when he got his PhD. at
