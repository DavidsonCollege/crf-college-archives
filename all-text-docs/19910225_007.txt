Rude Notes & Random Scribblings
Farewell Scribble

Yes, indeedy, it has come to
pass. That which so many feared
might take place, butnever though
actually could, did. Yours truly
has become the Editor-in-Chief of
“The South’s Foremost College
Weekly”. It seems as if the least

tame beast is taking control of the

zoo. Expect several stories about
on-campus Elvis sightings, and

D.A.
Thompson

faculty members who are actually
from other planets. (Let’s notrule
out an investigative special report
on the “love children”. of Captain
Kangaroo and Charo.)

The unwritten code of editorial
ethics forbids me from continuing
this column, and so it is in this
installment that I must proffer my
goodbyes as the rabble rousing
D.A., and reintroduce myself as
the less scandalous David Arthur.

Before I go, however, I'd like to

suggesta few simple ways to make.

your experience at Davidson both
more exciting, and more memo-
rable.. (Trust me, they’re all rela-
tively legal, and if you’re careful,
nobody’ll be able to touch you
with a felony charge).

1) Inthe warmer months, many
students. tend to attend classes
without wearing any shoes.

These bohemian show the rest
of us how trapped we are in ourpa-
thetically limiting footwear, and,
more often than not, make us all
question whether or not we are
simply mindless automatons who
have. been enslaved by the well
shod establishment, © ee

These people are a. collective

menace.

My advice, when i in Chambers,
forcefully restyour preferably boot
covered foot upon any naked toes
you happent to see. Slide your desk
over the | unwary callouses of that
oh so very “free” little hippie-
wanna-be sitting behind } you.

neta gene :

sound when they threaten to have
your speakers towed, they don’t
really mean it. All these guys
really want is a little attention and
love.

Treat them well. Play friendly
pranks on them. You could use
your redneck friend’s pick-em-up
truck to tow away the Cushman
which is illegally parked outside

. the house. (They live for that one.)

While being lectured about the
necessity of towing cars at 3 a.m.,
you could suddenly yell “Krispy
Kreme Doughnuts!” and then
snicker as he looks over his shoul-
der for a yummy treat. (Oh,
how you’ll both giggle!) Remem-
ber what you learned in first grade
about the police being your friends?
Well, good friends tease each other
all the time.

3) If you’re ever feeling a little
bored, one sure fire way to get the
evening going is toenter the insidi-
ously spelled Korner Puband shout,
“I’m a gay, jewish, liberal from
New York who thinks the South
sucks, and that George Bush should
seek peace in the Middle East!”
You’re sure to make tons of new
friends who’d be more than happy
to take you to the woods and show
you the new noose little Billy Bob
made at camp.

4) Alltoo often, misguided stu-
dents complain about how the lec-
tures they must endure in order to
get credit for Humanities are both
terribly dull and utterly useless. If
you ever find yourself inthe middle
of what you considera frustratingly
unexciting Humes lecture; go to
the stage, take off your clothes,
and massage your tingly bits while
singing “Moonlight In Vermont”,
or.“‘Thank you Falettin’ Me Be-
micelf” at the top of your lungs.

Not only: will this little trick
liven up the lecture, but it is also
guaranteed to perk up a sagging
love life.

5) If you’re really intrepid, you
could admit publicly that you just
don’t care about Davidson’s ath-
letics. At this time of impending

ascension, when I must forsake

bothacolumn andastate of being,
I can’t help but think of young
prince Hal of Shak € e's: The

Amnesty International's War

By Kirk Williams '91

I was sitting in Love the other
night for the talk by Margaret
Atwood when someone in the front
row asked, “Will you, as a Cana-
dian and a supporter of Amnesty,
comment on the war?”. The ques-
tion disturbed me because, through-
out the buildup to conflict and the
days since the first cruise missiles
hit Baghdad, both supporters and
critics of the use of force by the
Coalition have used the name and
work of Amnesty International to
justify their respective positions. I
think it is necessary, therefore, to
outline what Amnesty International
has actually done and said about
the events in the Gulf.

On December 18, 1990, Am-
nesty International released a re-
port detailing brutal human right
abuses committed, in Kuwait, by
the occupation forces of Iraq. The
report details how “Iraqi forces
have tortured and. killed many
hundreds of victims, taken several
thousand prisoners and left more
than 300 premature babies to die

after looting incubators from at —

least three of Kuwait City’s main
hospitals.” Techniques of torture
used include cutting off people’s
tongues and ears, electric shock,
shooting limbs, and rape. The
report also pointed out that “such
abuses have been the norm for
people in Iraq for more than a
decade.”

 Inearly January, President Bush
sent a letter to over 450 college
newspapers in ‘which he relied
heavily on the Amnesty Interna-
tional report to justify allied use of
force). He wrote that each day that
the allies delay action against

spaces. Since it would be one big
week, there would be much greater
publicity and perhaps more people
would get.a chance to attend.
Students could sell their work,
making a little money off of the
week.

Hussein is “Another day of atroci-
ties for Amnesty International to
document.” This letter coincided
with debate in Congress over the
war. Amnesty issued a statement
to Congress to express how the
organization is “deeply distressed
by the selective use of its recent
report on human rights violations
in Iraq/Occupied Kuwait during
the present debates in Congress.”

Jack Healey, Executive Direc-
tor of AIUSA, told the Committee
on Foreign Affairs that Amnesty
“welcomes the recent efforts of
President Bush and the U.S. Con-
gress to focus attention on the
egregious human rights abuses
being committed in Kuwait. We
hope, however, thatthe U.S. Gov-

ernment will express equal con-—

cern about human rights abuses in
other countries, regardless of the
ideology of the governments in
those countries or the geopolitical
interests of the United States.”
Healey has also stated that if the
U.S. government policies had pre-
viously expressed concern over
human rights conditions in Iraq
that, “Our country might not be
digging in for war today.” An
example of U.S. Government pol-
icy shortcomings is that a few
weeks prior to the Iraqi invasion,
despite evidence of Iraqi torture of
children and the killing of thou-
sands of ethnic Kurds in gas at-
tacks, the Bush administration
“refused to conclude that Iraq had
engaged in a consistent pattern of
gross human rights violations,”
Amnesty has also detailed
human rights abuses in many coa-
lition states. Coalition ‘partners
Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia

tions could be done too. Little one
scene humorous readings, politi-
cal skits, improvisational stuff.

A major point ofan Arts Festi-
val would be bringing the arts into
a community setting. We could
advertise to the public, for one
thing. As it stands now we usually
go and see individual events on a

routinely use torture and detain
political prisoners ‘indefinitely
without trial. Similarly, Israel, in
recent years, has detained, without
trial, thousands of Palestinians for
“peacefully exercising their rights
to free expression and association.”
Israel has also been condemned
for excessive use of force for kill-
ing hundreds of Palestinians in the
past three years.

Amnesty International does not
take a stance on the territorial dis-
pute over Kuwaitand is pleased by
the President’s declared indigna-
tion over the human rights abuses.
Amnesty, however, is disappointed
by the selective nature of this in-
dignation and believes that “Ex-
ploiting human rights to justify
violent confrontation is itself inde-
cent.” The work toeradicate human
rights abuses would be greatly
helped if the nations of the world
developed consistent human rights
policies.

While the war continues,
Amnesty continues to document
and battle against human rights
abuseseverywhere. In afew weeks,
for instance, Amnesty International
Starts its 1991 Women’s Campaign
to call attention to. abuses of
women. The Davidson College
chapter of Amnesty meets each
Thursday night to write about
human rights abuses all over the
world. Anyone who is interested
in writing letters on behalf of vic-
tims or in learning more about at-
tempts to improve human rights
conditions are encouraged to stop
by.
