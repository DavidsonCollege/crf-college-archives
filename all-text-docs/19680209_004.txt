Frustrated Furman Falls
As Stall Strategy Backfires

Davidson frustrated a Fur-
man stall Tuesday night and
handed the Paladins a 55-40
setback. The win brought the
Wildcats’ record to 6-1 in the
Southern Conference and
tightened their hold on first
place in the league.

The ‘Cats are accustomed
to playing a looser, run-and-
shoot style of basketball. ‘We
did not play smart against
the stall at first. That’s why
& was close at first.’ coach
Lefty Driesell said.

Once the ‘Cats go? used
to the slow brand of play
they had no trouble con-
trolling the Paladins and
winning the ball game.
Guerd Dave Moser led the
attack, hitting tive shots
from the outside.

Doug Cook's 10 rebounds
helped the ‘Cats gain.a 35-19
advantage on the _bhack-
boards. Mike O'Neill, who
had played well as a substi-
tute in the West Virginia
game, «ame off the bench in
the second half to spark a
rally that put Davidson oxt
of reach.

Furman Coach = Frank
Selvy thorght that the stall
strategy was the only chance
that the Paladins had of
staying with the ‘Cats. The
slow down kept the game
close in the first half. The
halftime score was 2420 in
favor of Davidson.

“A slow dow ,ame is a
nerve-wracking thing. You
have to wait and be pa-

fent. If you don’t, it can
beat you,’’ Driesell said.

After Davidson had gained
a substantial lead ‘n the sec-
ond half the ‘Cats further
frustrated the Paladins by
going into a slow down game
of their own. Sitting on a
safe lead, the Wildcats re-
fused to shcot and forced
Furman into 4 frantic catch-
up style of play.

Alter ;’ayirg the stall all
e ening, Furman was not
able to play successful come.
from behind basketball. The
win brought the over all rec-
ord of the Wil’cats' to 14-4.
By winning its 1ast four ball
games Davidson has pulled
itself up to a tie with Boston
College for 13th in the UPI
poll.

‘Cats Grab SC Lead

With Win Over WVU

Sporting a powerful, even-
ly-balanced scoring attack.
the Wildcats crushed West
Virginia University last Sat-
urday, 91-77.

Davidson added a tight de-
fense and an over powering
rebounding performance to
win the game before a sell-
out Charlotte Coliseum
crowd.

The victory avenged the
eariler loss at Morganton
in overtime and gave the
"Cats an opportunity to win
the regular season South-
ern Conference competi-
tion. Finishing the season
in first in the conference
would give Davidson the
number one seed in the all-
important conference tour-
nament.

The Mountaineers never
really frightened the Wild.
cats, who consistently broke
open their sagging defense.
Mike Maloy, Doug Cook,
Wayne Huckel and Rod
Knowles pulled in rebounds
at both ends of the court to
enable the ‘Cats to dominate
the boards.

Maloy led the team in re-
bounds with 15, while David-
son out-rebounded WVU 53-

“ awe played really good de-
fense against them. That is
one of the big reasons we
were able to win,’ Coach
Charles (Lefty) Driesell said.
He praised Dave Moser es-
pecially for his defensive job
on West Virginia star Ron
Williams.

Moser held the flashy
guard to 16 points. Williams
had been scoring an aver.
age of over 20 points a
game. Maloy allowed Carey
Bailey only six points and
six rebounds, far below his
season averages in both
categories.

Maloy led Wildcat scorers
with 16 points. Jerry Kroll.
Cook, Huckel, Moser and
Knowles alt scored between
12 and 15 points.

“We shot well and were
pleased with the balanced
scoring of the team."’ Driesell
added. The ‘Cats shot nearly
52 percent from the floor.

But the game was won at
the foul line. The Mounties
hit 31 field go&ls to David-
son's 29. The ‘Cats hit 33 of
42 free throws, however, to
provide the winning margin.

Super-Mountie Williams
Tough, Even In Defeat

Ron Williams, West Vir-
ginia’s shoo-in for All-Con-
ference and strong candidate
for All-America, did not play
an especially good game
against Davidson Saturday
night. Still he left little doubt
in the minds of the nearly
12,000 onlookers that he is
one of the finest guards in
the nation.

Wildcat Dave Moser did a
magnificent job defending
the super-Mountie, but Wil-
liams was still impressive
with his speed and his play-
making. The outcome of the
two games between these
two teams this year indicates
that the success of the Moun-
taineers depends largely on
the play of Williams. In the
WVU win earlier in the sea-
son he chipped in 30 big
points. His 16 Saturday were
not enough to lead his team
to a win.

Before the game Wil-
tiams acknowledged that
the Davidson-WVU game
was one of the biggest of
the year for both teams. He
recognized the fact that the
winner would probably win
the top seed in the SC
fournament.

“This is a big game, but
the tournament is the big
thing for us.’ Williams said.
He said that WVU has great
respect but no fear of David-
son. He added that regard-
less of the outcome of Sat-
urday’s game the Mounties
would be out to win the tour-
nament.

Dick Klein. owner of the
Chicago Bulis of the NBA,
was at the game to scout
Williams. Even though Wil-
liams was not having one of
his better games of the year
Klein was impressed.

“He is good enough to
play in our league right
now. | think he is a far bet-
ter play-maker than Dave
Bing,” Klein said. He also
said that Williams . could
become as good a scorer
as Bing, quite a compli:
ment for the Mountaineer

Klein said that he would
choose Williams in the second
round of the NBA draft if he
were still available then. He
said that he doubted that a
guard of Williams ability
would survive the first-round
of the draft.

“If he is going to play in
our league he will have to
learn to shoot more and pass
less. He played too much
of a team game tonight."
Klein commented after the
game. Williams must be
ranked as one of the best
players the Wildcats will face

ed 25 against Davidson in
the first meeting of the two
teams this year, again an-

noyed the Wildcats. Hum-.

mell started the season as
a substitute, but gained a
starting role before the Jan.
13 Davidson game. In Sat-
urday’s contest he tossed
in 21 points and kept WVU
in the ball game until the
‘Cats pulled away in the
second half.

Swimmers
Challenge
Appies

Davidson's ‘Catfish sought
to improve their 2-2 record
today in a meet with Appa-
Jachian State University at
Boone. Next Friday the
swimmers will host Emory
University in a meet in
Davidson's home waters.

Coach Tom Stevens said
that he expects the team to
do well in the meet with Ap.
palachian. Next week’s meet
with Emory will begin at
2 PM.

“Our match with Emory
should be an exciting, even
one. | hope that many of
the students will come
down to watch it,” Stevens
sald.

The prospects for the rest

of the swim season have been
brightened by the return of
team captain Eddie Beach
to practice. Beach missed
several weeks of workouts
when he underwent surgery
for a knee operation in De-
cember.
_ “His knee still gives him
some trouble kicking,’ Stev-
ens added. The injury also
prevents him from doing the
kick necessary for the breast
stroke. He is also unable to
do flip.turns.

Stevens said that Beach
will swim in both of David-
son’s upcoming meets, prob-
ably in the 500 and 1000 yard
free style events.
