Field Day.

The annual field day exercises were
held on Sprunt Field last Monday morn-

thus winning the meet. Thg Juniors
came next with 35 points and the Fresh

the Sophoomres brought up the rear

SANDLAPPERS ENJOY
A SPRING GATHERING

The annual spring gathering of the
Sandlappers from South Carolina took
place in the Eumenean Hall last Satur-
day night.

About fifty of the faithful were there
to partake of the cakes and sandwiches
and peanuts and dopes provided by
“Snag” Bailey, the illustrous steward of
the evening. After the platters had been
licked clean the argument started in real
earnest,

Prof. J. L. Douglas led off and Dr. J.
M. Douglas and Dr. J. M. MacConnell
followed. Having been told of the good
old days Leonard Dick and others began
to discuss the pregnant present.

Which discussion centered mainly about
the reasons why the Sandlapper contin-
gent at old S. C. has not been: on the
increase of late. After the clouds had
rdlled away it seemed to be pretty well
established that the Club should get to
work Pronto and see that the old Pal-
metto state be represented in proper
force next year. Plans were laid for a
joint meeting of students, their relatives
and friends and alumni some time during
Commencement at which time South Car-
olina at Davidson could be further dis-
cussed.

The names of prospective students
from South Carolina were assigned to
each member of the Club who will get in
touch with the new men and assist them
in their work of setting rooms and room-
mates. In addition the Club plans to get
in touch with every important high
school and preparatory school, in the
state.

J. I. Smith of Greenivile was elected
to succeed W. J. Cooper, of Kinstree, as
president. Brown McCallum will suc-
ceed H. H. Smith as vice-president and
“Buck” Shaw will assume the duties of
secretary and treasurer, succeeding R. F.
Davidson and W. T. Elliott. A steward
will be elected later.

EXAMINATION SCHEDULE SHORT STORY ANTHOLOGY

TO BE PUBLISHED SOON

The last: session of the North Caro-
lina Press Association decided to put
out an anthology of North Carolina
short stories selected from ° material
submitted the various colleges of the
state. The primary aim of the associa-
tion is to publish the stories and only
the stories which are representative of
the talent in every North tarolina col-
lege,

A committee for the: purpose of tak-
ing this work in charge has been select-
ed and is already at work. R. R. Jones
of Davidson is heading the committee
and with him are associated Lyman of
Elon Allen of Trinity and one man from
State College who has not been selected
as yet. Letters have already been writ-
ten by the chairman of this committee
to ten of the best and largest puolishing
houses in the state for bids on the
work.

The stories will be sent in from all
parts of the state and any person who
is a bona-fide student of a-college which
belongs to the North Carolina collegfate
Press Association is eligible to submit
a story. All contributions will be care-
fully read and selected by a special
committee. This committee will be com-
posed of members of tthe literary boards
in the various colleges, probably three
men in number. These stories will be
judged entirely on their merits. May
31 has been set as the day by which
time all contributions must have been

' submitted,

The anthology will probably appear
during the summer. Plans are being
made for the printing of 2,000 copies,
one of which will be placed in the li-
brary of every college of note in the
country. The proposed book will con-
tain 145 pages 125 consisting of liter-
ary ‘matter and twenty of advertise,
ments.
