Theft in the Union

What’s happened
to the honor code?

By RICK JENKINS

The African carving which
was allegedly stolen from a
College Union art display before
Thanksgiving has yet to be
recovered, according to Union
Director C. Shaw Smith.

For the two weeks prior to
Thanksgiving break, the Africa
art collection, which was valued
between $25,000 and $30,000,
was on display in Davidson’s
Union Gallery.

When time came to return the
collection to Charlotte’s Mint
Museum on November 13, a
costly piece was inissing, accor-
ding to Smith.

Valued around $1600, the
piece is an antique wood carving
of an African figure with a
decorated face and straw cost-
ume.

The object was the first ever

_to be removed from a Gallery
exhibition, Smith said. The
high integrity of the Davidson
community has allowed for such
displays to usually remain open
and unprotected.

But the recent incident has
broken this faith, according to
Smith. ‘‘Its disappearance is an

uneasy situation for Davidson
to cope with—do we make
known the theft or do we hush it
up?”’ asked Smith.

The removal of the art piece
not only places the College in an
unnecessary predicament with
the Mint Museum and its
insurance agency but threatens
the likelihood of future dis-
plays, he added. Smith said
that any information concern-
ing the missing object would be
appreciated.

Davidson to act as sponsor
for local child abuse center

By HOWARD BROWNE
Staff Writer

CHARLOTTE—In January,
Davidson may be given several
hundred thousand dollars that
it never intends touse.

At least it doesn’t intend to
spend the money on itself,
according to College Trustee
Larry Dagenhart, but will in-
stead hold the money for a
nascent child abuse center in
Charlotte.

This is because of a ‘‘techni-
cality’’ in North Carolina’s tax
laws which gives a greater tax
advantage to educational insti-
tutions than private community
service organizations, Dagen-
hart explained. The person don-
ating the money wishes to
remain anonymous and wants
the money used for the benefit
of children.

Davidson has agreed to act as
one of four sponsors for the
organization, which will be
known as the Family Support
Center.

Y poses no contest

The four candidates for

YMCA offices are unopposed.

Contacted this week, all four
stressed they want to get more
students involved in the Y’s
programs.

L.C. Brewster '80, candidate
for president, also stresses that
the Y is here for students to use.

“I'd like people to realize that
we can help them get projects
going—we are open to new
projects ‘and ideas,’’ Brewster
said.

Brewster’s previous exper-
ience with the Y includes work-
ing with the community center,
the depot lunch, the ice cream
social, and the environmental
block.

She also has served as YMCA
treasurer.

Vice-presidential candidate
Anne Stanback ’81 wants to
help the Y continue to work as
successfully as it has this past
year.

Stanback has served as block
head for the environmental
block as well as working with
separate YMCA activities.

“As a sponsor we are willing
to accept this gift— provided
tax ruling is obtained openly
and honestly with the North
Carolina Department of Rev-
enue. It won’t be done without a
formal ruling in writing from
the department,” added Dagen-
hart.

Davidson's Trustees were
first approached by the Center
in May, 1978. In June the
Board voted in favor of helping
the Center. ‘‘We generally fa-
vored the idea and were very
interested in having a partici-
pating role. The money was in-
cidental,’’ said Dagenhart.

“We will receive the money
from the anonymous donor with
the request that it will be used
for the Family Support Cen-
ter,’’ added Dagenhart. He said
also that, should the Center fail
or fall apart Davidson would
use the money for another
cause.

vice-president as a ‘“‘liaison”’
between the Y cabinet and the
various blocks.

“The Y is the’ most service-
oriented of all the organiza-
tions’’ on campus according to
the candidate for secretary Kar-

it is my favorite to give my time

Hester has participated on
the Publicity Committee, the
Alternate Lifestyles Sympos-
ium Committee, and as a STEP
tutor.

The concern of Elizabeth

urer, is ‘“‘to make. sure people

know where their money is -

to the Y.”

volunteer lawyer for the Center
said they hope that the receipt
of such a large gift will encour-
age other donations, grants,
and possibly, federal funds.

“It will give us a track
record,’’ said Booe, He said
the money would enable the
Center to actively seek dona-
tions and would lend more
validity to their organization.

Booe and Dagenhart expres-
sed hope that. Davidson invol-
vement with the Center will
encourage faculty and student
participation.

“We have been given assur-
ances that there will be .suffi-
cient opportunities for David-
son students and faculty,’’ said
Dagenhart.

He continued, “It is incum-

_bent on institutions like David-

son not only to provide the
on-campus educational exper-
iences, but I think, along with
that there needs to be signifi-
cant opportunities for participa-
tion in worthwhile community
activities. Davidson best fulfills
its purpose when it broadly
serves the community in which
it finds itself.” :

According to a descriptive
pamphlet on the Center it will
be based on approaches used in
Denver, Colorado at the Nat-
ional Center on Child Abuse. Its
four-hour Hotline, a twenty-
four hour crisis nursery, and a
hour crisis nursery, and a
community educational prog-
ram.

The Center received its start

aftera,task force, set up by
Mii Park Presbyterian

. Church in Charlotte to study

crime and the church’s role in
its prevention, decided that one
solution to the crime leap is the
prevention of child abuse.

Mr. Booe said the group
decided, “‘the way to deal with
criminal justice is to deal with
child abuse, to treat the disease
and not the symptom.”’
