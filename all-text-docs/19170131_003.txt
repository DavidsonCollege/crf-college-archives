tien of the materials which entered into
the character, and for the careful plan-
ning of the structure in the light of
God’s Word, and the preparation that
must be made by each of us for that life
which is to follow the earthly one. The
imperative need for daily attention to
the forces which effect our lives was
emphasized and the influence which
these seemingly trivial things could have
was clearly brought out.

WEEKLY MEETINGS.

Saturday night in the Eumenean So-
cietv the question was “Resolved, That
the United States should adant a policy
of universal compulsory military serv-
ice.” The affirmative was upheld by
Sayad, Honeycutt and T. B. Woods, and
the negative by Liston. Jenkins and
Hudson.

The affirmative contended that the
adoption of their plan would (1) unify
the nation, giving all the various nation
alities a common band of. patriotism:
(2) to protect us against foreign invas
ion. Tt is not undemecratic, thev said,
and cited Switzerland as an_ instance,
and warned us to profit by the example
of England, and not be caught unpre-
pared,

The paints of the negative were: (1)
hat is it not necessary to our defense ;
(2) it influences us towards an aggres-
sive poliew: (3) it makes other nations
structfel- of us: (a4) it interferes with
a man’s life wark. making hin sacrifice,

WHERE THE PINS GO

Many persons wonder what becomes
of the pins, and a French scientist has
deemed the question of sufficient mo-
ment to make a painstaking investiga-
tion. The pins, he says, go hack to the
dust of mother earth. His experiments
have shown that an ordinary pin left ex-
posed to the clements will disappear in
eighteen months. A common hairpin
will dissolve into dust in 154 days. A
steel pen will vanish into dust in cigh-
teen months, but a polished stecl needle
will withstand the ravages of time for
a period of two and a half years.—Fx.

Some sons go to college to get a lib-
eral education, while their fathers stav
at home and receive an education in lib-
eralitv.—Sacramento (Pa.) Times.
