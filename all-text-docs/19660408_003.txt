Fraternity

KA PLEDGES WASH CARS DURING GREEK WEEK
Brother John Hunter Supervises

For Leaders’ Initiative

A national fraternity officer
took a long. hard look at Dav-
idson fraternities Monday night
and came up with a plea for in-
creased initiative on the part
of fraternity leaders.

William LeClere, executive
secretary of Chi Psi fraternity,
speaking to fraternity pledges
in Hodson Hall. at the annual
Greek Week banquet, listed five

dangers facing fraternities on| -

this campus.

First, he said, the overwhelm-
ing preponderance of fraterni-
ties constitutes a danger for
the system: “The ultimate solu-
tion will be either the growth
of the college or a shrinkage in
the number of fraternities.”

In the meantime, the plan for
total affiliation is, LeClere con-
tinued, only a temporary solu-
tion; but as long as the fra-
ternities play such a large role
in campus life, it is their re-
sponsibility to take the initia-
tive in enriching the total pro-
gram of the college.

“Fraternities must provide an
alternative,” he said, ‘‘and
it's up to the undergraduates to
find the alternatives, not the
faculty.”

The second danger to which

LeClere pointed was a lack of; -

effective communication with
the faculty. “The basic need,”
he said, ‘‘is to use some imagin-
ative thinking,’ using as ex-
amples programs undertaken by
fraternity systems at other

small colleges facing problems |<.

similar to Davidson's.

Third, LeClere pointed out,
fraternities need to strengthen
alumni ties. An effective com-
munication with alumni will
lead the way to greater alumni
participation in the debate over
the place of the fraternity sys-
tem.

The heart of the problem, Le-
Clere said in his fourth point,
is the lack of imagination in un-
dertaking new programs.

men and the mature seniors.”

He pointed to the danger of
directing fraternity programs
too much in the direction of
‘keg. combo and collections of
couples.”’

“The greatest danger to the
fraternity system,’’ LeClere as-
serted, ‘‘is that it will die from
within by losing sight of his rea-

son for being. You've got to hold
to the basic tenets of the sys-
tem.”

Closely related to this was Le-
Clere’s final point: the danger
of provincialism. “It's a fact
of life at all colleges, he con-

cluded, and you've got to es-'

cape it and see that your little
world isn't the entire world.”

By ED EMBREE
Davidsonian Feature Writer

The Carolina Inn, the old ram-
shackled home beside the Post
Office on Main Street, has an
interesting history and possibil-
ity for imaginative use in the
future. The house was built in
1837 by “L. Dinkens"’ who left
his name on the fireplace.

Built the same year David-
son opened, the house served
as a home until Hinson Pinck-
ney Helper bought the house in
1855 and opened the Helper Ho-
tel in 1860. The hotel provided
a place for travelers to stay and
for girls to stay during com-
mencement exercises.

“Pinkey,’ Helper had a broth-
er, an obscure author, who had
- an instrumental role in hasten-
ing the Civil War.

Hinton Rowan Helper publish-
ed The Impending Crisis, an eco-
nomic critique of the Southern
slavery system, shortly before
the War. .

The book was used as cam-
paign material by the Repub-
licans. As a result H. R. Helper

was forced to leave the state and
the North Carolina Jegislature
passed a Sedition law against
the book.

Hinson Helper sold the house
to the Sloan family who con-
tinued to use the house as a
hotel until the College bought
the building in 1946 with the ins
tent of converting it into a guest
house.

Funds have never been made
available for the necessary ren-
ovation and conversion of the
house however, and for the past
several years the College has
allowed the town to use it is a
“Teen Canteen’? for local teen-
agers.

Several ideas have been re-.
cently forwarded for utilizing the
old hotel for college purposes.
Mrs. Peter Nicholls, Supervisor
of Dormitories, feels that the col-,
lege is in need of additional
guest housing and that the old
hotel could provide a conven-
ient and historical building for
such housing. This is the same
opinion the college has held for
the last 20 years without re.
sults.

for possible future expansion.

WRUCK PROPOSES TAVERN

Old Hotel Lives On

Another suggestion, probably
more appealing to the Davidson
student, is one made by Pro.
fessor E. O. Wruck, who has
suggested renovating the inn to
its original condition and open-
ing it as a tavern and restau-
rant for the students.

Wruck cited the situation at
Princeton where there are two
taverns closely associated with
the University. At one, the Nas-
sau Inn, there are boarding.

Profits realized from the tav-

ek Week Winds Up

fraternities have been schedul-
ing athletic events between the
pledges and brothers. Tuesday
night the Sigma Chi pledges
defeated the brothers, including
varsity players Ronnie Stone and
Tom Youngdale. Wednesday, the
Phi Delt pledges took on the
brothers in a softball game.

The finale of Greek Week is
today, with pledge field day
and the annual Pledge Regatta. -
The events will not depend on
athletic prowess, said Westfall,
but upon the ability of the class
to work together. ‘This will pre-
serve the purpose of the new
system, to build unified, mature
classes.”

Davidson To Administer
Selective Service Tests

Selective Service Qualification
Tests will be administered at
Davidson on May 1M, May 21 and
June 3.

The test will be used by local
Selective Service boards in con-
junction with students’ class
ranks in determining future
draft deferment. The test is vol-
untary.

Dr. W. B. Hight, director of
student counseling, said that

R

“each student should examine
his rank in his class and should

about whether or not he should

Applications for the test must

can Council of Education out-
lined the criteria which will be
used by local draft boards in
determining student deferment:

(1) First year students (rising
sophomores) should make a
score of 70, if they elect to take
the test, be in the upper half
of their class and should be ac-
cepted for admission to the sec-
ond year class.

If second and third year stu-
dents take the test, they should
also make a score of 70. How-
ever,

(2) Second year students
should be in the upper’ two-thirds

_ of their class.

(3) Third year students should
be in the upper three-fourths
of their class.

(4) Seniors who plan to enter
graduate school should make a
score of 80 and/or be in the up-
per quarter of their class.

Local boards may use the
above qualifications as guide-
lines in determining who should
receive deferment. Meeting
these qualifications does not
guarantee deferment. However
local boards may, at their dis-
cretion, impose stricter stan-
dards for making decisions on
draft deferment.

The day on which a student
takes the test is decided by
Science Research Associates,
the firm which is handling all
assignments of test centers and
the administration of the test on
the national level. '

At Davidson, Dr. Hight will
administer the test in thr Col-
lege Union on all three dates.
Dr. Hight indicated that if a
large number of students sign
up to take the test at Davidson,
they will probably be evenly
distributed among the three test
dates. However, if few students
sign up, they will probably take
the test on the first test date.

A number of questions - about
the upcoming test are still, unan-
swered. A representativeof the
Selective Service Board in: Char-
lotte indicated that the proce-
dures for the test were prepared
on short notice and that more in-
formation was expected shortly.

The Charlotte Board did rec-
ommend that students enrolled
in ROTC take the test.

Although enrollment in ROTC
does carry some. weight in de-
termining eligibility for draft
deferment, some unforeseen cir-
cumstances, illness for instarice,
may cause a student to drop out
of the ROTC program. In such
| cases, these students would then
be subject to the criteria outlined
for use by the local boards.
