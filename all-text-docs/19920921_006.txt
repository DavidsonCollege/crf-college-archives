Hurricane Andrew Ravages Louisiana
Davidson Volunteers Witness First Hand the Storm's Damage

By Gigi Cooke

On Wednesday morning Sep-
tember 2, 1992, a convoy of seven
college vehicles and a 48' tractor
trailer loaded with relief supplies,
building materials, and our crew of
twelve college employees, left for
Morgan City, Louisiana. Prepared
to offer skilled help to the area of
Louisiana which suffered the most
severe damage from Hurricane An-
drew, our group of “do - gooders”
represented the combined efforts
of the Davidson Community to-
.. ward hyrricane relief. We reached
Morgan City early Thursday
evening and quickly filled the halls
of Atkinson Memorial Presbyte-
rian Church with the relief sup-
plies donated by the members of
our community. An early encoun-
ter with our first hurricane victim -
a young man travelling with his
wife and small children who had
lost everything in the storm except
his microwave and TV, which he
sold to pay for their trip north -
prepared us for more widespread
devastation than our initial and
quick observations suggested.
Power had just been restored, and
the roads and many of the yards
had been cleared from the fallen
trees. A closer look at the area
revealed a severely depressed city
with far-reaching and scattered
damage.

Morgan City and the surround-

ing areas of St. Mary’s parish are
fully integrated. “Neighborhoods”

do not exist in the full sense of the
word down here... we all learned
rather quickly that the people here
generally donotknow or help their
neighbors. The coming together
of a community that often follows
a disaster did not exist-(poverty
and the stress of meeting basic
needs often prevents that commu-

winds and rains exaggerated dam-
age accumulated over years of poor
conditions of the houses before the
storm. Hurricane Andrew finished
what poverty had started, and yet

these needy people did not want to
admit that they needed help. On
several occasions we left bags of
groceries at the door, or gave extra
supplies to an accepting family so
that they could distribute those
goods to other family members in
need. The people we encountered
were not “needy and greedy” but

rather unaccustomed to offerings
of help and generally concerned
that someone else may be worse
off.

Adrenalin - or Mr. Collins’s

eT co ie ea | Stepwise Sty rey

adrenalin - gave us a twenty hour
work day on our first full day in
Morgan City. Separate crews re-
paired two roofs in Morgan City
and shoveled the fallen ceiling out
of therooms where the water leaked
in and caved in the tiles. Ray
Thrower and I spent the afternoon
exploring southern Louisiana and

nication regardless of the common
hurricane experience.: Well mani-
cured homes often stood next to}
ruined or damaged low-rent hous-
ing,‘and yet our group from North
Carolina extended the first offer-
ing of help. So... concentrating our
efforts on the elderly, the handi-
capped, single women with small
children, and generally those un-
able to help themselves, we spread
our relief efforts to citizens off
Morgan City, Amelia, Bayou Vista,
Franklin,_and_Patterson.
Collins was a regular Daddy
Warbucks adopting these people
as his own and finding a way to
give them a better place to live.
After hold-ups with the Red|
Cross gave us a slower start than
anticipated, we began investigat-
ing the need in the areaon our own,
Certain members of the church ei-
ther needed assistance or recom-
-mended others for help, the Coun-
cil On The Aging made several
referrals, and eventually even the
Red Cross spread knowledge of
our efforts. Many of the referral
handedour way through the church
and the Red Cross did not require
our immediate help. We gave high-
est priority to “drying in” those
people without a roof overhead,
Many times the looks of a house
from the outside hid the true extent
of the interior damage. Heavy

Princeton Review!

We know you guys like to party a lot. But still,
is anybody minding the store?

You failed to notice an important change in the LSAT.
The question format that you call Triple True/Faise,
which used to appear in all sections of the LSAT, has
not appeared on the LSAT since February 1991.
But you still prep your students to “crack” this
‘ obsolete question format.

That’s wasted cracking, guys. May we suggest that
you briefly disregard your margaritas, and
update your LSAT course materials? We know it's

work, but somebody’s gotta do it.

The answer to the test question.

particularly the remote fishing vil-
lages of Dulac and Cocodrie. Dev-
astation tohomes in the deep bayou
area was severe. The winds and
especially the rising tides shred-
ded trailer homes and tore houses
from the foundations. We found
very few people in this southern tip
of the state, I guess these people
just left what little they had before
the storm. That evening we worked
under lights powered by our own
generators in Franklin and inad-
vertently drew much attention to
ourcrew. As we repaired the roof,
mopped the kitchen floor, un-
clogged the drain, and left food for
Mrs. Porter, many curious neigh-
bors stopped to question why we
had come into a predominantly
black area to offer our help. We
received similar feedback from
others...genuine appreciation for
our efforts combined with perfect
wonder as to our motivation to
help. ee
Saturday afternoorf work took :
us to Franklin, a small community
about 35 miles west of Morgan
City. Mildred and Morris Madi-
son,an elderly couple in poor health
who had stayed during the storm
for lack of money to buy enough
gas to leave, captured our hearts
and our curiosity about the way of
life for so many people in the area.
The hurricane had sweptaway most
of the roof of their home, in which
Mildred had spent her entire life.

“After decades of disrepair arid'sev-

eral soakings from rains which fol-
lowed the storm, the interior pre-
served little of the careful attention
apparently given to the two-bed-
room house at one time. The
wooden floors, which Mildred
spoke of waxing weekly asa child,
were wet and rotted from the ceil-
ing collapsing, and most of the

furniture had mildewed from the
dampness and the heat. Even as
we re-built the roof, a storm rolled
in and soaked their house for the
fourth time in one week. We spent
a day and a half re-building the
roof and air-conditioning one room
of the house. The gratitude of
Mildred and Morris was over-
whelming... while Morris took
hints from the crew on how to
continue. minor repairs, Mildred
told us over and over that “this is
better than Christmas” and she
cried when she saw the new bed
and bed-frame donated by amem-
ber of the church in Morgan City.

In almost every case our crew
gave the people we helped the in-
centive to start helping themselves.
So many people who were down
and too overwhelmed by the dam-
age to even clear out a space in
their house to sit, came tolife again
once we offered our support. This
was especially true of Josephine
Ruffin on Birch Street. Easily the
worst looking house from the out-
side, the condition of this house
improved little on the inside. A
tree had fallen at the front door and
had broken the electric meter and
crushed her car. Inside, the ceiling
had collapsed and had remained
damp and rotting in an ankle-deep
pile covering the floor for more
than a week. Our crew removed

‘the tree from the porch and car,

restored electricity, repaired the
roof, and shovelled out the ceiling
and other debris from the inside of

her home. By the following mom- _
ing Mrs. Ruffin had cleaned the
entire house and was as proud of
her home as a new home-owner
might be... and even her “compact
car” as she described it could not
