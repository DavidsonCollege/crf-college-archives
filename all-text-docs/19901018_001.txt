COLLEGE RELATIONS

The first black alumnus elected
by fellow graduates as a Davidson
trustee takes the honor seriously.
“It’s not something to trivialize,”
said Dr. William S. Hutchings II
78, a family practitioner in Ma-
con, Georgia. “It’s not every day
you getachance tohelp lead one of
the most prestigious colleges in
the country.”

Hutchings has been working
for harmony between the races his
whole life, and he says he’ll bring
that orientation to the Board of
Trustees when he joins it for a

an opportunity to: help raise
peoples’ consciousness of issues
there in the community that don’t
touch all of their lives,” he said.
“The whole interracial ball game
hinges on exposure. If you’re not
exposed to different aspects of the
community and the world you
won’t understand them, and that
leads to fear and ignorance.”
Hutchings was an_ active
Davidson student, serving as hall
counselor, social chairman at Fan-
nie & Mable’s eating house, vice-
president of the Black Student
Coalition (BSC), Student Union
president and a member of the

four-year term on January 1. “It’s

life. He graduated with a BS. in
biology and received a Justin Pot-
ter Foundation Scholarship to at-
tend medical school at Vanderbilt
University. He received the Henry
J. Kaiser Family Foundation Merit
Award upon his medical school
graduation.

He has also been an active
Davidson alumnus, serving as a
member of the Board of Visitors
and working with the Leadership
South consortium. Back in his
hometown of Macon, he has led
the city’s interracial council and

council on campus and religious

Student Organizing Conference on
East Bloc Agriculture Changes

By ELLIE BROWN

When Davidson College jun-
ior Caroline Williamson began
looking for summer jobs lastspring,
she had no idea her search would
lead to her planning of a major
global conference. But through her
work in Washington D.C., with the
International Policy Council on
Agriculture and Trade, she will be
traveling to Budapest, Hungary,
later this month to help coordinate
aconference on Eastern bloc agri-
culture.

The conference, which will be
held at Budapest University from
October 21 to 23, is formally titled
“Restructuring Food and Agricul-

- ture Systems in Central Europe
and the USSR: Strategies for Pol-
icy, Investment, and Assistance.”

Williamson sought out her job
with the International Policy Coun-
cil as her mandatory internship for
the Davidson in Washington sum-
mer academic program. Foiinded
in 1987, the council was created to
cope with the myriad of complex
domestic, international, social,
economic, and political problems
that are facing global agriculture
today, Its members , from both de-
veloped and developing nations,
represent government, interna-
tional organizations, business,
banking, farming and academia.

Williamson recalls that M. Ann
Tutwiler, a 1980 Davidson gradu-

ate and associate executive direc-'

tor of the council, told her during
the application process that she
might be working on Latin Ameri-
can debt policy. However, by the

time Williamson arrived in Wash-
ington last summer, planning for
the conference in Budapest had
begun.

Williamson and another intern
spent the next eight weeks mailing
5,000 invitations to individuals all
over the world and keeping track
of their responses. She later be-
came conference logistics coordi-
nator--writing memos on travel
arrangements and attendance
forms, and researching agriculture
in the USSR and Poland for brief-

ing books for conference partici-

pants.

The conference will involve
close to 300 participants, all ex-
perts drawn from three major ar-

Davidson Tenth Best

By CHARLIE GRIER

Davidson College moved into
the top ten of national liberal arts
colleges according tothe 1990 U.S.
News and World Report guide to
“America’s Best Colleges.” The
ranking moves Davidson up five
notches from the 1989 report.

Theannual guide published by
the magazine ranked the top 141
national liberal arts. colleges, as
determined by the Carnegie Foun-
dation for the Advancement of
Teaching. The foundation classi-
fied the schools on the basis of
academic degrees and programs
offered as well as enrollment.

The guide ranked schools in
five areas: reputation, selectivity,
financial resources, faculty re-
sources, and student satisfaction.
From these five areas, U.S. News
determined a percentile score and
an overall rank for each school.
Davidson scored highly in student
selectivity and student satisfaction.

Amherst College in Massachu-
setts emerged at the top of the
rankings, followed closely by
Swarthmore College in Pennsyl-
vania, Williams College in Massa-
chusetts, and Bowdoin College in
Maine. Besides Davidson, the only

other southern school in the rank-
ing is Washington and Lee, ranked
15th.

Reaction to therankings among
college administrators was posi-
tive but reserved. “It is. a privilege
for Davidson to be listed among
the schools on the charts,” Presi-
dent Kuykendall said.

- Robert Gardner, Dean of
Admissions, echoed the thoughts
of Kuykendall. “I love it,” said
Gardner. “Being in the top ten will
mean a lot to the kids.”
