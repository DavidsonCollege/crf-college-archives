Down she sot;
Laid an egg,

THE TEST. |
The test of a man is the fight he makes,
The grit he daily shows
The way that he stands on his feet and
takes
Fate’s numerous bumps and blows.
A coward can smile when there’s naught
to fear
When nothing his progress bars,

“SHORT AND SNAPPY.”

“Short and Snappy!” Did you ever
see that phrase before? No, I did not
coin it. “It was coined by the “Hard-|
boiled Tops” while preparing the Amer- |
ican soldiers to face the “music” in
France. I am merely borrowing the use
of it because it fits best of any I can
think of just now.

I wish to tell you in a few “Short and
Snappy” sentences of a sale that is going
on at Ed Mellons, in Charlotte. Suits
which would have cost you thirty-five to
forty-five dollars two weeks ago can now
be bought for twenty-five to thirty-five
dollars respectively. If you want a nice}
tweed for spring wear, now is the time
to get it and still have the price of
Keith’s left. |

Better see Mellon’s line before buying |
your spring suit or hat. They have the}
up-to-date brands. ' (Adv.) |
