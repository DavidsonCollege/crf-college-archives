Seniors lian To
Aerial Magellans

About thirty members of the Senior
class accepted the invitation of the Char-
lotte Chamber of Commerce to attend the
illustrated lecture of the “Round-the-
World?Fliers” at the Charlotte auditor-
ium Friday evening.

Late that afternoon Major James, rep-
resentative of the Chamber of Com-
merce, telephoned and asked that as
many members of the Senior class as
could to come over for the lecture, ex-

Commerce. Ben Beall carried the men
down in his cars.

This is a part of the plan of the Char-
lotte Chamber of Commerce to secure

and Charlotte, and to obtain friendly re-
‘lations. They plan to link the two more
closely together.

Lieutenants Harding and Thomas, two
of the fliers who recently completed the
first flight around the world, gave an
illustrated lecture on the trip. They told
something of their experience and hap-
penings during the flight.

They had both stationary pictures and
moving pictures of various phases of their
flight which they used in connection
with their lecture.

The whole entertainment lasted about
two hours, and all who were able to go,
enjoyed it very much.

Had it not been for the Queens Col-
lege Glee Club concert, for which many
of the seniors had bought tickets, prob-
abty more would have accepted the ‘in-
vitation and gone down.

“Father Time is no gentleman.”
“How’s that?”
“He tells on women.”

Two Debating Teams Are

Debaters Selected for Two Fresh |
Debates from Twenty-five
Contestants

In one of the warmest preliminaries of
many years the Davidson representatives

in the Freshman triangular debate with °
, Wake Forest and Carolina were chosen |
on last Thursday night.

From the twenty-two contestants, the
following eight men were selected: Af-|
firmative, Leo Pritchett, F. D. Daniel, |
and A, T, Dillard, with M. M. Lockhart, |
as alternate. Negatives: H. F. Peterson,
H. T. Powell, J. P. McKnight, and F. W.
Ebey as alternate.

The query for the debate was, Resolved,

That North Carolina should ratify the
port terminals and water transportation,
act. The Wilkitten forensic artists will

defend the affirmative of this question
against the strong Wake Forest Fresh-
men trio at Davidson, while they are at
the same time trying to conquer the Tar
) Heel neophytes in Chapel Hill. Both en- |
counters have been dated for April 6.

Last year the Wildkittens downed,
Carolina by a unanimous vote of the de-
cision committee but fell before the Bap-
tist orators by a 2-1 decision,
the chances for a double victory by the
Wildkittens appear to be favorable. The
|preliminaries, at which the two teams
were chosen, revealed an unprecedented
number of entrants—twenty-two; and
‘also a strong array of unsuspected de-
hating talent. Every speaker acquitted
himself creditably and the winners are,
without doubt, the most promising first
year men that Davidson has claimed in
many years.

The keen interest and close competi-
tion being manifested by the freshmen
in their first intercollegiate meet en-
courages the debating boosters to be-
lieve that a genuine renaissance of in-
‘terest in the forensic arts is now brow-
ling.

if the new men continue their good work |

in debating he sees no reason why they
should eclipse, before their grad-

which the Wildcats may boast.

DAVIDSON
FIVE YEARS AGO

, Ata mass meeting of the student body,

the slogan Tloover for President was
adopted., Much argument both pro and
leon preceded this action, the main dis-
cussion being carried on by members of
‘the Polity Club, headed by Dr. Lingle.

The chief attraction at the time was
the coming Student Colunteer Confer-
fence which was held from Friday to
| Sunday. Seventy of the delegates were
i known to be members of the fairer sex,
which gave the affair an added interest.
We wonder that the number of Volun-
teers did not show a sudden increase.

Seven members of the Reporters’ Club
were awarded the golden quill. These
men were the first to receive this honor,
it having been inaugurated only a short
time before.

The following appeared in the editor-
“All millionaries play golf. Join
the golf club and qualify.”

During the week the Seniors and
Juniors originated a long needed custom
|by adopting a class ring. It was to be

{numeral on the other.

An article appeared in the Davidson-

j}ian of that date which gave a brief his-
| tory of Miss Shaw’s life and work. It
|expressed the deep appreciation of her

The following are two extracts from
\the Peanut Parcher: ‘We aren't archi-
tects but we want to make a suggestion
for the new dormitory; build it different
from Georgia and Rumple.

“O, it’s fierce to be stuck on Tanglefoot
Like it’s fierce to be shot on classes;
The same thing’s true of tar or glue,
But it’s fine to be stuck on lasses.

As usual an article appeared condemn-
ing some phase of the R. O. T. C. depart-
ment. This one had to do with the wear-
ing of mixed uniforms. It condemned
all those who indulged in this practice
as slackers. :

Lewis Schenck was elected president
of of the Y. M. C. A. for the coming
year.

The baseball team had just ended a
rather mediocre season, having won ex-

actly half of the games played. Schenck
was high point manyfor the year with a
total of 197 tallies to his credit.

It might be noted that the term “Wel-

!|/PROFESSOR WACHTER WILL

RECITE FAVORITE VERSES

Many of Kipling’s Best Dialect
Poems Will Be Given By Artist

Among the numbers which Professor
Wachter will give in the Kipling program at
Shearer hall Friday evening, March 20, for
the benefit of The Davidsonian are two
poems in the English cockney dialect. One
is the favorite Gringa Din in which an ex-
British soldier tells the story of a water-
carrier joined to the British troops in India.
The other requires the impersonation of an-
other former British soldier, who saw service
in South Africa. It is called Chant Pagan.
There is grim humor running through ts
graphic description of his experiences as a

trooper, contrasted with his present occupa-
| Hea that of “mowing the lawns of the
| Squire.”

| It is said that Professor Wachter is a
master of cockney dialect and that his inter-
preations of the Departmental Ditties and
Barrack-Room Ballads is unsurpassed.

Who is Tomliison? He’s the ghost of the
man who lived on borrowed ideas, in charac-
|ter neither good nor bad, whom St. Peter
| refuses to admit to heayen and whom the
Devil bars from hell. Hear Professor
Wachter read the poem, which only Kipling
could have written—one of the most dra-
matic, vivid, searchingly humorous poems in
all literature. You will want to know what
becomes of Tomlinson after his journey
from star to star and his descent from sun
to sun to the “row of naughty stars that rim
the mouth of hell.” Just as the spirit grips
him by the hair, so will the poem grip you.

The Explorer will tell of his adventures,
hardships and sufferings in opening up an
empire. This poem is one of Kipling’s
finest. His unerring genius for catching the
central thought and vividly portraying it in
masterful phrases is nowhere better shown.
The Explorer is a poem of unselfish heroism
and typifies those whose sacrifices make
progress possible.

Mr. Will Neal will sing a swinging musi-
cal version of Mandalay and a picturesque
setting of Fussy Wussy recently composed
by Oley Speaks. He will be accompanied by
Mrs. Baker in her own delightful manner.

At the request of those who have heard
him-give i: Profeccos. Wachter will include
in his program Friday evening, March 20,
one of John Masefield’s Salt Water Ballads
The particular one referred to is Cape Hora
Gospel. In this poem an old “sea dog” re-
counts his adventures in rounding Cape
Horn. It is said to be an extremely humor:

ous characterization.
