ship, and women’s rights

By Laura McCanpbLisu
Staff Writer

On Thursday night, the Campus Forums
Committee, Speakers’ Committee, and the
Women’s Issues Committee had scheduled a de-
bate concerning “Pornography and Women’s
Rights” between Dr. Nadine Strossen, the presi-
dent of the American Civil Liberties Union(ACLU)
and a liberal feminist, and Dr. Gail Dynes, a
radical feminist
and sociologist.

nography must be tolerated as a form of’ free
speech. Instead, Dynes gave the audience a slide
show and presentation that was open to questions
and input.

She began by saying that she intended to
“introduce the pornography industry, and the ef-
fects of pornography on women’s lives in this
society.” Dynes criticized our modern society for
being an image-based one, whereas we used to be
a print-based culture. “We are bombarded with

images every-
day,” she said,

Unfortunately,
Strossen, the au-
thor of “Defending
Pornography,”
could not partici-

ily medical emer-

Dynes criticized the images in advertising
“that portray women as property and men as
property owners,” even if they aren’t explicitly
intended to be pornographic material.

form of com-
munication.
They draw
you in.”

Dynes presented

an interactive presentation for the audience in the
900 room. This event was a feature of Women’s
Month.

Campbell Goodloe ’00 introduced Dynes. A
professor of sociology and women’s studies at
Wheelock College in Boston, she is the co-author
of the book, “Pornography: The Production and
Consumption of Inequality.”

In the debate, Dynes had planned to expose
the negative effects of pornography while Strossen
had planned to share her opposing view that por-

Dynes said the
main problem
with this type of society is that “we live in an
image-based culture with a largely image illiterate
population.” Thus, Dynes told the audience that
her purpose was “to introduce you to media lit-
eracy and teach you how to interpret the images
that bombard you everyday.”

Dynes criticized the images in advertising
“that portray women as property and men as prop-
erty owners,” even if they aren’t explicitly in-
tended to be pornographic material. “Many also
say you don’t mean ‘Playboy’ when you are talk-

ing about pornography,” she added, “but it is.
Anything that is mass-produced and distributed to
stimulate male masturbation is pornographic.” In
pornography, Dynes said, “Women are dehuman-

people in Europe maintain their ancient languages.

Her travels and study will be funded by a
$22,000 grant from the Thomas J. Watson Foun-
dation, which recently named Setina as one of its
60 Watson Fellows for 1999. More than 1,000
students applied to the first round of the selection,
describing their ideal ““wanderjarh” outside of the
United States.

Setina based her Watson proposal on her
love of poetry, photography and pervious travels
to Europe. She made her first trip to Wales during
the summer of 1997, while studying at Cam-
bridge University in England ona Davidson study
abroad program. She received a grant. from

Welsh culture. She spent five weeks at that time
studying Welsh language and poetry by taking
language classes and traveling independently to
visit Welsh poets and an old family friend.

the culture, and when she returned decided to

ship. She explained, “The people who still speak
Welsh are a minority and do so intentionally. They
show an amazing tenacity to hold only their lan-
guage in the face of a vastly dominating lan-
guage.”

In addition to her time in Wales, Setina will
spend time studying poetry in two other Celtic
languages: Breton in the Brittany region of north-
ern France and Gaelic in Ireland. In Ireland she
will work through the Poet’s House, a center for
the study of Gaelic poetry.

An avid photographer, she will also docu-
ment the minority populations and their natural
environments. She said, “It’s interesting that all
three are coastal cultures. I think that landscape
may influence language, the way things are named.”

Her photographs and poems she plans to
write will give her a means of sharing her year
with others. “My photographs and my poetry will
give me two different ways of representing the
experience and bringing it back to share with
others,”’she explained.
