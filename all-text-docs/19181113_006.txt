DAVIDSON CLASHES N. C.
AT WINSTON-SALEM

Davidson did not meet a team from
the University of North Carolina last
year; there was no such team. This
year, however, representatives of these
institutions will again clash on the grid-
iron.

Davidson's team this year is an un-
usually strong one. In spite of all diffi-
culties and disappointments, Davidson
has a team of which she has good reason
to feel proud. Fhe heavy Washington
and Lee team came down quite confi-
dent; yet only once did that team show
any real strength. Davidson's team was
clearly master of the situation. Coach
Fetzer is usually remarkably reticent.
But even before he had seen it win so
handily over the Generals, he was wil-
ling to say that this year’s team was the
most promising that he had ever seen on
Sprunt Field. It is of course true that
the organization of the team will be
somewhit set back by the fact that this
week we lose Spann, our veteran quar-
terback, and Captain Crouch. And J.
M. Barnhart, who wasshowing up well
as sub fullback, leavgs at the same time.
The team and the Wwhole college will
sorely miss these men. But Coach has
several good men to fill these vacancies.
For quarterback he may use cither Doug-
lass or Robeson, or he could shift Me-
Fadden or McAllister from halfback.
And there are several men who can take
the center, particularly Brady, who tho
now at guard, has a good deal of expert-
ence at center. Davidson still has a good
team, * .

At Carolina, Coach Ritch has assem-
bled a team which quite casily beat Camp
Greene Remount last Saturday. but its
real strength is quite problematical. ‘The
Carolina team is almost entirely yet ‘to

make, with a coach who is clearly at a}.

disadvantage against Coach Fetzer, who
has’ been coaching Davidson teams suc-
cessfully for years,

Altho the entire student body is be-
hind the team, and would be glad to be
in Winston-Salem and support the team
next Saturday, on account of the fact
that a trip could not be arranged with-
out cutting out inspection, Lieutenant
Dennard says that he cannot give any
Jeave except the regular week-end passes.

TOWN TPEMS.

Mr. C..L. Grey and family left on
Monday to make their home in Hender-

friends regret to see Mr. and Mrs. Grey
leave our community.

pared on the subject. Refreshments were
afterwards served and the meeting was
thrown into its social functions,

PROGRESSIVE IRELAND.

An Irishman and a Scot were arguing
as to the merits of their respective coun-
tries.

“Ah, weel,” said Sandy, “they -tore
down an auld castle in Scotland — and
found many wires under it, which shows
that the telegraph was knoon there hoon-
dred 0’ years ago.”

“Well,” said Pat, “they tore down an

ould castle in Oireland, and there was no
wires found undher it, which shows that
they knew all about wireless telegraphy
in Oireland hundreds av years ago.”"—
Pittsburg Chronicle Telegraph.

The students are glad to see Professor
Currie out again after his severe attack
of pneumonia. It is hoped that he will
be able to assume his class work again
