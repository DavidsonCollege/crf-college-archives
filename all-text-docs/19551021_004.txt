Federal Service Exams
Now Open to Applicants

The first Federal-Service En-
trance Examinations opened today
to college seniors and college grad-
uates who want a career in the
Federal Service. Applicants have
until November 18 to file for the
first written test to be given De-
cember 10 in more than 1,000
localities, including many college
campuses, Phillip Young, chairman
of the U. S. Civil Service Commis-
sion announced.

The new program, unique in
Federal history. will be permanent
and continuous, with examinations
planned periodically as Federal
personnel needs require it. Filing
is permissible at any time for any
of the subsequent examinations.
which will be open to both special-
ists and non-specialist seniors and
graduates. Replaced are approxi-
mately 100 college-level examina-
tions. Many of these have been giv-
en only in specialized fields and
infrequently.

Job offers can be made by Fed-
eral agencies to persons passing
the examination once their names
become available on the tists of eli-
gibles which the Civil Service Com-
mission will set up early next year.
Appointments following graduation
can be obtained in such fields as
physics, metallurgy, chemistry,
cartography, engineering, mathe-
matics, meteorology, and oceano-
graphy. The opportunities will be
in administrative, personnel, tech-
nical, and professional positions:
salartes range from $3,670 to S4.-
525.

‘At present turnover rates, be-
tween 8.000 and 10,000 of these po-

this examination.

Application forms have already
been -made available at college
placement offices or may be ob-
tained from the nearest Commis-
sion office.

College students who have com-
pleted (or will eomplete within 9
months of filing application) eith-
er one, two, or three years of study
leading to a bachelor’s degree with
major study in one of the optional
fields listed above may apply.

Government representatives will
visit most campuses before Novem-
ber 18 to explain the new program
in detail. College placement of-
fices will be given full information
concerning the representatives’
visit. Interested students should
contact that office.

Mr.’ Young emphasized that any
senior passing the examination can
be hired as soon as he graduates,
whether that is in February or in
June, provided he has come within
reach of agency selection on. the
list of eligibles. This means his
name must be among the top three
names on the list. The higher the
examination mark, the more quick-
ly the name can be reached for
appointment.

A student may tell a Federal
agency representative, either be-
fore or after the examination. that
he would like to work for that
agency. Similarly an agency repre-
sentative may, at either time. ask
a student to consider appointment
only with that agency. Those taking
the examination will be given an
opportunity to express preference
for employment in a_ particular

Such appointments can be made

once the three’ conditions of pass-
‘ing the examination, graduation,
and availability for selection are
complied with.

The new Federai-Service En-
trance Examination, for the first
time, gives the non-specialist sen-
ior or graduate an opportunity to
compete for a Federal management
internship. The new superseded
Junior management Assistant ex-
amination for this purpose had
been open only to persons who
specialized in certain fields.

All candidates will be given a 3-
hour written examination on the
morning of December 10. Those
wishing to try for management in-
ternships will take an additional
3-hour written test later in the
day and will be given a group oral
test in March.

The marks made in the two ex-
aminations will be tallied separ-

ately so that a poor mark in one!

examination will not lower a high
mark made in the other. However.
a failing mark in the first examina-
tion will eliminate the candidate.
Separate fists of eligibles will be
made up from those taking only
the first examination and from
those taking both examinations.

Further information and appli-
cation forms may be obtained at
many post offices throughout the
country, or from the U. S. Civil
Service Commission, Washington

Sigma Upsilon Vates
Ten Into Membership

BY JOHN

HARMON

Davidson’s Blue Pencil Chapter of Sigma Upsilon, ex-
clusive literary fraternity, chose by the ball system ten addi-
tions to its already distinguished membership at its ‘first
meeting on October 6 in the recently and attractively re-
decorated Beta Theta Pi fraternity lodge.

Five of these new members were
carefully gleaned from the facul-
ty. These are Professor George B.
Watts, Professor’ L. S., Champion,
Professor J. B. Ficklen. and Profes-
sor B. Gillespie. Dr. Karl G. Jung
was extended: an invitation to at-
tend all the year’s literary meet-
ings and other activities, but be-
cause of his limited stay at David-
son, he was not officially voted by
the.active brothers into the hood.

It was somewhat harder to get
good student members with liter-
ary interest, let alone talent. The
group did, after much collaboration
and collusion, decide upon five stu-
dents whom it. deemed worthy of
bearing the distinction of SU. Fore-
most among these is Jim Beaumont
Marshall. He is foremost because
he is one of the two members of
the present senior class who were
elected to membership, and also
because he has a long line of dis-
tinctions at Davidson and elsewhere
to recommend him, and also sever-
al influential friends in the group.
Likewise outstanding is Dick More-
head, who has honors which it is
not necessary to enumerate. Dick
will add, {t is hoped, prestige, if
‘not productivity, to the fraternity.

Harry Antrim is the only one of
the “Sigma Upsilon Elect” who is a
member of the junior class. Harry
is precious, however, and will fit
in nicely. Somewhat unprecedented
was the election of two sophomores,
John Bernhardt and John Frye, in-

to a group usually reserved for old-
er heads. However, they are both
quite nice persons and they will
without doubt have the good sense
to remain silent unless spo’.en to
directly—a virtue sadly lacking in
some of the more witty among the
clever people so common to Sig
Up’s select set.

At the time of the first meeting.
John Harmon. who was unanimous-
ly elected secretary at the final
meeting of last year, was away
from the city. Joel Conarroe ably
filled his splendid secretarial
shoes. however, and wrote some
terrific minutes.

The October 6 meeting was de-
voted entirely to routine business
and to the election of new mem-
bers, so no reading program was
given. The second meeting, on Oc-
tober 20, however, is a donkey of
another hue. After preliminary
business and the usual trivia, a
fabulous little program was enjoy-
ed by the fabulous little group.
This was at the Phi Delta Theta

THE DAVIDSONIAN

Bridge Tournament
To Feature Blind Expert Judge Beauty Contest| ®

Dr. A. M. Dye, nationally known bridge expert, will be
a special guest at the first Duplicate Bridge Tournament of
the year. The tournament is for students, faculty members,
and townspeople at 7:30 on Tuesday night in the ballroom of

the College Union.

Dr. Dye will play with Dan La-
Far and will use his special set
of braile cards since he is, totally
without sight. In spite of his handi-
cap, he is expected to obtain a rat-

ing of Senior Life Master, the Hall
of Fame for Duplicate Bridge, at
any time.

All people in the Davidson Com-
munity who are at all interested in
bridge are urged to take part in
this event. The tournament is for
beginning and average players, and

no previous experience is neces-|*

sary. Mr. J. A. Postell of Charlotte
will be on hand to explain the dup-
licate system and direct the tourna-
ment. All you need bring is a part-
ner and 50c per couple to cover
expenses.

Since its recent. advent, dupli-
cate bridge has become one of
America’s greatest pastimes. By
moving systematically from table
to table, each pair plays against
each other pair. Each pair also
plays the same hands. Score is
figured: by comparing the result
after everyone has played every
hand.

It is hoped that there will be a

cess is the only living hetress of
note who has never sought pub-
licity. She has never been known
to give an interview to the news-

The current tour is Birch's

heads in wonder at the beauty of
the passing attack. Few fans any-
where were witnesses to 4 more
spectacular offensive display. It
was even more amazing since Tom
Newton, the leading pass receiver
of the Southern Conference, was
unable to play.

The fact that Belton was “back
of the week” in the Conference,
that he led in passing yardage and
is second only to Wyant of West
Virginia in total offense came as a
surprise to no one. Newton and
Gramley are first and second in
Pass receiving, while Dyke Little
is fourth in passing yardage. Don
McRee, with a fine day, came up
to seventh in rushing in the con-
ference.

lice their own persuasive methods.
Finally, in order to see his aged
father, he was permitted to go to
Hong Kong. There, after three
more years of seemingly hopeless
waiting, he was permitted to enter
the United States. Now he is here,
after five years of waiting, and
his beaming smile comes from the
heart, for he is having his tong-
desired education in freedom.
His entire family is widely
traveled. His father was for 25
years a YMCA secretary, and an
aunt who studied at NYU is a
YWCA secretary. His mother is
still in Shanghai, unable to join
his father who is living in Hong
Kong. A brother is working with
the American embassy on Formosa,
and there is a sister in Zuerich,
Switzerland, and one in Orlando,
Florida, who went to Agnes Scott.
Surprisingly, he has already
found connections here with his
life’ in China. His Sunday Bible
class was taught by the father of
Sam Magill, and his algebra teach-

fuses to perform without practice,
he is an excellent pianist. When-
ever it becomes politically possi-
ble after graduation and graduate
study, he plans to return to China
to teach.

His goal is to become a bridge
between China and the West,
transmitting the cultures from one
to the other. Already he has
learned much about the West, and
we on our part are certainly proud
to have with us a student with such

spirit.
