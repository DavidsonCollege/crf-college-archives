THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE

PAGE TWO

FRIDAY, OCTOBER 25, 1963

(Letters to the editor do not necessarily reflect the views of the editor.)

Academic Probation

We were extremely pleased to
learn that the Executive ‘Committee
has seen fit to propose to the faculty
certain liberalizations of the Academ-
ic Probation rule. ;

The proposal to make the six-
week freshman report unofficial is
merciful and just. most cases the
six-week report consists of one re-
view grade per course, which is a poor
excuse for putting a student on proba-
tion for an entire semester.

As we were not told exactly what
other proposals the Executive Com-
mittee did make, we are limited to
hopeful suggestions of changes in the
rule we feel are necessary.

The first question we have con-
cerns the change made this year in
the Academic Probation requirement
raising the minimum number of hours
and quality, points from 9 and 6 re-
spectively to 12 and 9. Question being,
is this change necessary or useful?

We definitely think not. for sev-
eral reasons. For instance, the exist-
ing promotion requirement for en-
trance into the junior class is 54 hours
and 48 quality points. Even if a stud-
ent were to make 12 hours and 9 quali-
ty points for four semesters, he would
not qualify for promotion to the junior
class. despite the fact that he had
never been on Academiic Probation.
In other words, the promotion rule
takes care of itself, so why harass a
student when he knows he has to im-
prove anyway?

Even if the harassment is for some

Can it be possible that the four
thousand-plus alumni and_ student
feet which will tramp around in the
Patterson Fraternity Court during the
IFC-Alumni luncheon this Homecom-
ing weekend will improve the appear-
ance of this perennial eye-sore? Good
Luck. Still the College refuses to spend
any money to beautify this “Weejun
trap,” as it has aptly been called. May-
be one of our wealthy alumni will see
the mess and donate a small sum to
remedy the situation. Our Father,
which art in heaven ....

ant Dean of Students Bob Young for
his genuine interest in an intelligent
service to Davidson’s fraternities. He
is constantly on the look-out for pos-
sible problems and crises which might
arise and has taken steps to solve them
before any further damage is done to
fraternity-Administration —_ relations.
We appreciate his efforts, through
which he has made the position of
Fraternity Liaison Officer an increas-
ingly important and helpful post.

Are the local churches (i.e. those
at which Sunday morning attendance
is equivalent to Vespers attendance)
more suitable for worship than those
which are not within the town-limits of
Davidson? Could not the Honor Sys-
tem be extended to cover pledged at-
tendance at our home-town churches
or those in Charlotte? Some progress
was made in this area last year; guess
the powers-that-be feel that we should
be satisfied for a while.

Still in an ecclesiastical vein, we
would like to express our thanks to
Chaplain Will Terry for nothing in
particular and everything in general.
The National Review to the contrary,

reason deemed necessary, why not
concentrate on students who are fail-
ing courses? Under the 12 and 9 rule,
a student with two F's can still escape
Academic Probation. We feel that the
old 9 and 6 rule, with perhaps a pro-
vision for students with two F's, is
adequate, if such a rule is necessary
at all.

Secondly, for reasons Rick Lowery
discussed in detail last week, we
strongly advocate removal of the
rule’s restriction on extra-curricular
activities away from Davidson. That
restriction serves no purpose apart
from punishing those contributing to
the college outside the classroom.

Thirdly, rather than forcing a

student on Academic Probation to at-
tend all classes, why not simply re-
strict his cuts?
_ Finally, we are at a loss to under-
stand why the rule was changed so
that once a student got on probation,
he could not get off for an entire
semester. The previous rule stated
that a student could go on or off at
any grading period.

Actually, we are against both
rules. Why not make Academic Pro-
bation a real probation period? If a
student fails to make 9 hours and 6
quality points or has two F’s at the
END of any semester, put him on pro-
bation. If he cannot make his grades
the following semester, then review
his case, and if necessary boot him.
But please cut out this silly harass-

ment.

we feel that Christianity can be made
relevant on the Davidson campus,
even for the Gant & Weejun set. Rev.
Terry is no gung-ho evangelist, in the
Bible-Belt sense, but in his own un-
assuming way he has been most ef-
fective in his work. He listens so well.
And it is good to see the Chaplain do-
ing something more than drinking cof-
fee with the secretaries in the Union
every morning.

Wonder what kind of reception
Madame Nhu would have received at
Davidson? Despite the fact that David-
son is desperately trying to cover her-
self with Ivy (which, we hear, raises
academic standards immeasurably), it
is hard to believe that the Davidson
gentiement would: have resorted to
eggs and rocks, as did our idols,
Princeton and Harvard. The often
intolerable maleness of Davidson's
atmosphere would prohibit such
harsh treatment of such a fair mem-
ber of the fair sex, regardless of her
political activities.

And, while we are talking about
sex, need we mention how overjoyed
we are to have our campus so bounti-
fully adorned with females? What
could be a more welcome balm than
chilly weather and dry leaves, loud
Negro combos (via Hit Attractions, of
course), Chanel No. 5, and skirts?
Welcome to our campus. May Monday
never come.

It’s interesting to speculate on
how many college and universitiy
presidents have worked themselves
te death. Between squeezing money
from reluctant capitalists, represent-

ture classes, and absorbing the person-
al attacks of tactless, if ‘well-meaning,
critics, they are understandably a

The president of this college has
not worked himself to death. This is
not because he doesn’t work hard (he
does), but because he has sense
enough to take an occassional break
and relax. We welcome President
Martin back to the Princeton of the
South from a well-deserved vacation.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

S’nP Pilot Lauds Paper,
Blasts Montana Doctor

Ackerman

Dear Editor:

The letter to the editor by
Dr. F. D. Hurd attacking the
article written by Rick von Un-
werth on the actions of Gover-
nor Wallace seemed to me very
“radical” and unealled for.

I suggest that this parents has
some abnormal desire to find
out more than he knows now
about Davidson College, es-
pecially when he calls on THE
DAVIDSONIAN to publish
“more articles typical of David-
son College.”

Articles which are “typi-
cal” of eny campus news-
paper's domain have no news
value in themselves. Is it not
trve that virtue hes no news
value?

This writer must admit such
actions as taken by Gov. Wal-
lace, which we might conven.
iently label “vice,” do have news
value and are read by people
such as Dr. Hurd.

A student newspaper is not
dedicated to catering to Alumni
and/or to parents of students.

Instead, this newspaper is
printing what the students feel,
and no one has the prerogative
to propagate their prejudices or
feelings on a conscientious stud-
ent who is trying to find out the
truth for himself.

Am I not right that students
are attempting to expose them-
selves to as many different
points of view as possible, even
though they may be hindered by
their parents?

Dr. Hurd states that “I am
still happy that I saw fit to send
my boy, at an increased expense,
so far away from home in or-
der to get away from similar as-
sociates (von Unwerth) in the
Northern colleges.”

May | ask the writer of this
letter whether his son had any
consideration in where he per-
sonalty wanted to go to col-
lege, and did the writer write
his son‘s appileation, end did
he eppear for his son’s Inter.
view in Dr. White's office, or
what?

The writer says that his son
came to Davidson~rather than a
northern college at an increas-
ed expense. Though Davidson
may pride itself unduly and
naively in being among the fin-
est in the South, she does rightly
pride herself in offering pros-
Pective students, as opposed to
Parents, a less expensive educa-
tion than most northern schools.

All I can add is in the letter’s
own words: “... if one knew
more concerning the writer's
history this type of vicious ex-
pression might be explained.”

Orr

Dear Editor:

Last Friday there appeared in
‘THE DAVIDSONIAN an indict-
ment of Rick von Unwerth deal-
ing indirectly with a very basic
question—that of the purpose of
a college education.

I speak of Dr. F. D. Hurd’s
letter odmonishing the editor to
refrain from allowing such “un-
typical” .articles to appear in
future DAVIDSONIANs. Dr.
Hurd’s use- of the phrase “to get
away,” used in connection with
coming to a southern college,
conflicts rather sharply with my
opinion on the purpose of col-
lege.

To attend college is “to en-
ter;” it is to enter the realm of
learning with its ideas, its ideals,
its capacities, its personalities,
but above all, with its questions.

There is no valid reason (ex-
cept for the facade of tradition)
why southern colleges such as
Davidson cannot or should not
be concerned with the questions
facing our nation today.

The rece dispute is the
momentous question of our
generation, and it cannot be
decided, or even dealt with,
without the “individuals”
from whom Dr. Hurd would
seek to escape.

It is through the efforts and
abilities of active, interested
individuals that an eventual so-
lution to the Negro problem
will be evolved, not through the
distant, disinterested passivism
which constitutes such a large
bloc of America’s recreation.

I further disagree with Dr.
Hurd’s contention that the arti-
cle by Mr. von Uawerth was
“very radical and explosive,”
even for an institution such as
Davidson. Ours is an exeiting
and controversial era in which
von Unwerth’s opinions and
modes of expression are as wide-
spread as the daily task of brush-
ing one’s teeth.

His thoughts represent the
views of thinking people, and
there is no basis for an assump-
tion that admission to Davidson
automatically curtails the
thought process,

I certainly hope that von Un-
werth's article is typical of Dav-
idson, because while few of us
have contributed significantly
to the body of werld thought,
many students at Davidson are
interested and sometimes active
participonts in the struggles of
our society, from which we do
not wish to be sheltered.

There is one final point which
T feel shoutd not be dwelt on,
but neither should it be over-
looked. My respect for Dr.
Hurd's intelligence and educa-
tion restrains me frem any per-

sonal criticism based on the
contents of one short letter.

However, I feel a man of Dr.
Hurd's professional standing, if
sincerely interested in any sub-
ject, should spend more time in
the preparation of his theme
than did Dr. Hurd. The style and
form of his remarks detract
markedly from the impact of his
censure.

Baum Seeks Open
Basketball Drills

Dear Editor:

After having studied several
hours in the afternoon, I de-
cided to take a short break. Re-
alizing that the basketball team
had started practicing, I decid-
ed to go down to the gym and
watch the team work out for a
while.

However, I was cogently in-
formed that the practice was a
closed one and that no one was
to be allowed to even watch the
team pactice from the balcony.

They said thet the coach,
(Drissell, 1 believe is his name)
hed told them to let no one
watch the prectice. | check-
ed my schedule of basketball
games and found that the firs?
one was only 37 days away.

Now, I can definitely see the
need for a closed practice for a
few days previous to some major
game, but starting this proced-
ure at this point seems a little
tidiculous to me.

The school pays a lot of
money to have a good basketball
team and I am sure that we all
benefit a lot from this program.
But it does seem that we the
students should be able to sec
the team perform at other times
than at the regular ball games—
a team that has definite All-
American potential among its
members.

Could it be that the presence
of “outsiders” would cramp the
style of the above named coach?

Perhaps even by just watch-
ing the team practice, we of
less ovtstending athletic abili-
ty could pick up a few point-
ers and would thus come to
enjoy our own attempts at the
game more when we had «a
chance to play a simple pickup
geme.

Also, we might just absorb
some of the coach’s knowledge
of the game and thus improve
even further our own geme.

But as it was this afternoon
and as it has been for several
other previous afternoons this
year, this mode of self improve-
ment is being prevented by the
obstinate rulings by the man in
charge.

(John Stuart Mill in “On Liberty”)

BY BILL HUFFORD

The state legislators of
deemed what ideas shall or,

North Carolina have now
more properly, what ideas

shall not be heard in the state supported universities.
In a brief 39-minute period near the close of last

year’s state legislature,

the first step was taken toward

the destruction of academic freedom on the state cam-

puses of North Carolina.

In railroading the bill through,
there was no discussion, and no
state college or university was
given the opportunity to express
its views.

In fact, the leading educators
of the state were not told of the
bill's existence until after it was
passed.

The law (HR 1385), commonly
called the “gag law,” prohibits
from state supported campuses
all speakers who (1) are known
members of the Communist par-
ty, (2) advocate the overthrow
of the Constitution of the United
States or the State of North
Carolina, or (3) have pleaded the
Fifth Amendment with respect
to questions about communist
or subversive activities.

Reaction fo the law has not
been exactly mild. Newspapers
(The Charlotte Observer for
one), educators and even the
State Board of Higher Edu-
cation have clamored for its
repeal.

Not only must the institutions
refrain from having such speak-
ers. but they are also given the
task to enforce it.

President D. Grier Martin
comments on the situation: “Un-
der this law, it will almost be
necessary for the universities to
send out. questionaires to the
prospective speakers, resulting
in many speakers saying, ‘To
heck with it.’”

Answering whether there is
a chance for repeal of the gag
law, Martin continues, “There is
some chance, but not a first
elass chance. Maybe in the fu-
ture it can be modified. If it
isn’t modified. North Carolina
will have a rough time getting
speakers and faculty members.”

DAVIDSON'S GAG

The “gag rule” doesn’t apply
to Davidson. But how about us?
Are we in actuality better off
than the state colleges?

Davidson has never had a com-
munist on campus to speak. nor
until last year had the possibili-
ty ever been considered. Danny
Carrell, last year’s Student
Council president, presented a
list of controversial speakers to
President Martin.

A communist was on that list.
All the speakers were approved

except for the communist.

John Spratt, Student Council
current president, believes Car-
rell did have trouble last year
on speakers. ‘I think,” said
Spratt. “that there was a com-
promise last year: James Far-
mer (head of CORE) and some-
body from ADA (Americans for
Democratic Action) instead of
the communist.”

Many students have suspect-
ed that Davidson has a fixed
policy banning communists
from the campus. This, how-
ever, is not quite true,

But the school does wish to
review any proposed controver-
sial speaker. Both Spratt and
Martin call it an understanding.

“Nobody,” emphasized Spratt.
“told me to do it (see Martin
about speakers). But this is the
most reasonable approach.”

There are many reasons why
President Martin has hesitated
on giving the green light to a
communist speaker. “The big
thing,” believes Spratt, “is that
Martin would get 10,000 letters
if one communist speaker came
here. That's trouble!”

The main‘ thing is this—the
president gets hit from both
sides. ‘There are a lot of con-
flicting problems,” said Martin,
“and these make it difficult for
me.” Walking the fence is not
a very pleasant vocation.

GAG LOOSENING?

What about the future? Are
we going to be allowed to hear
opinions radically different
from those the administration,
trustees and alumni hold?

This year the Student Coun-
cil has asked President Martin
to allow a city councilman of
New York City in the 1930's,
Benjamin R. Davis, to speak
in chapel. Davis was and is a
communist. Martin's answer
should come this week.

Davidson has come a long way
in the past few years in present-
ing speakers whose opinions
differ from the college's. This
week will be crucial in determ-
ining whether the campus of a
private institution is a freer
sounding board for unpopular
ideas than campuses dictated to
by politicians.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Chapel Culture Huckster
Wasted Worthless Words

Newcomer

Dear Editor:

There
cultural
culture,

There is something crass
about a man who deprecates
crass materialism, yet offers the
remedy of bigger crowds for
culture.

Tuesday's Dale Carnegie of
the Arts cries for more faces at
plays, more ears at concerts,
more blinking, gazing eyes at art
galleries. He equates the culture.
boom with culture.

But Is not the truth, O werm
In sheep’s clothing, rather
that where two or three are
gathered at a pley—~and grasp
its meaning—culture is in the
midst of them. Call thet cul-
ture.

A man who campaigns for cul-
ture speaks in tongues like, “all
H—busted loose...” or “Cul-
ture-wise we must consider...”

If materialism is the cancer
of culture, then why judge the
success of culture on the num-
ber, the material total, of those
who attend it, of the collected
conglomerated heap that stuff a
theater with straw people?

And, O ‘non philistine”, a
correlation between the deluge

is something very un-
about a salesman of

of crime in America and the
dearth of culture in America,
Hardly a valid cause and effect.
How does culture cure crime?
Was not Louis XIV a paragon of
the cultured criminal?

No, the absence of culture is
not the fall of society, nor then
is the presence of culture the
salvation of the 1930’s, the land
of Beethoven and Kant, the
fountainhead of much of the
West's best philosophy, music,
theology, and art, and then
Preach culture as the salvation
of Germany!

Culture is not a redeemer,
and it does not filter down
te the mass vie mint mwus-
eums, junior leagues, book
study groups, or writers lee
gues composed of daffedil-
hatted widows.

Let the pudding be the proof.
Who now will attend a play be-
cause of Tuesday's pep-talk for
culture?

Few.

But Hsten to Eudora Welty
murmur a short story, or hear
Rhodes Scholar-novelist Rey-
nolds Price read a paper on
aesthetics, or hear a poem read,
and then culture will kindle its
own fire in man.

Culture is its own best advo-
cate, it needs no salesman.
