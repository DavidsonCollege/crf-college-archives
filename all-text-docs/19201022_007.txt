THE COMMISSARY PROSPERS.

Behold! Ponzi's new addition to
vhis commissary. [ts graceful round-
ed lines, noiseless motor should
make any man want to open a com-
emissary. Through the stillness of
the night comes the hum of the dia-
mond-hearing motor, and the long
illuminating rays of perfect radio-
lite.

This has been the chief amuse-
ment of the hill, since its arrival.
Now listen. fellows, Ponzi doesn't:
charge you a cent to let vou look it:
over, This is the only thing vou can
get free at the Commissary. All the |!
bevs that haven't already taken ad-
vantage of this free show should do
so at once, since he may begin to
charge admission, |

All Charlotte stoad dumbfounded |
when this magnificent work of man
noisclessly glided through — the!
throng oof astonished onlookers.
When the graceful car came on the
football held, people forget there
was a game going on, and turned:
their attention to the new arrival. |
Many a sigh came from the Fresh- i
men, saving, “Te think a fresh-cap |
could cause so great a marvel.”

There was wailing and gnashing:
of teeth, however, for the Macamac
parted with ten perfectly good
plunks for the privilege of teaching
Fonzi where not to park in Char-
lotte.
