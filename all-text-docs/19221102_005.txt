LITERARY NEWS

Dark, grim November, stalking
by, grieves for the year so
soon to go;

Brown tints upon the hillsides lie
and in the air come hints of
snow.

Dim, morning shadows fill the
day,

The owers are dead, the birds
have flown;

po leaves are heaped in stark

ely array—

The brook’s voice will bring a

solemn tone.

—Joel Benton.

D
EU SOCIETY MEETS IN
REGULAR SESSION

The regular meeting of the Euma-
nean Literary Society, held Thursday
evening, October 26, was one of the
shortest of the year. ‘Three of the
eight regular speakers of the evening
were present and two were appointed
from the house.

The question for debate, Resolved,
That the U. S. should adopt a system
of arbitration of strikes similar to that
of Canada, was hotly contested by W.
T. Jones, Biddle, Frazer and R. H.
Smith. As two of the speeches were
impromptu the debate was not what it
should have been, several of the argu-
ments being quite unsound and without
authority.

A short but forceful oration on the

subject, “Don’t Be Satisfied,” was de-
livered by H. M. Morris.

During the evening plans were dis-
cussed .for a meeting of the Fresh
society before the Senior Eumaneans,
to take place Thursday, November 2.

PANDEINIC SOCIETY HAS
‘ BANNER MEET OF YEAR

The meeting of the Pandeinics this

this term. :

solved, That the United States should
adopt a system of arbitration in labor
disputessimilar_to that of Canada.
Hudgins and Huie on the affirmative
opposed Young and Cox, P., on the
negative. The -speeches showed re-
sults of careful preparation and the
points were hotly contested. The
judges decided in favor of the affirma-
tive.

J. E. Milton delivered as an oration,
a_ selection from “The Strenuous
Life,” by Roosevelt. H. 1. Currie re-
ported on the current events of the
week.

The feature of the evening was an
expository lecture on the Panama
Canal by W. T. Baker. He used dia-
grams and: photographs to illustrate
his description of the canal and the
canal zone. Baker brought out the
fact that the American people should
be proud of this great work which was
accomplished by American genius.

SIGMA UPSILON HEARS
PROF. ERWIN SPEAK

The third meeting this year of the

Sigma Upsilon honorary. fraternity
was held on October 23rd in the P1
Kappa Alpha hall. This was the first
meeting in which the regular literary
program was carried out and practic-
ally all of the members were present
to enjoy it.

The program as carried out was as
follows:

Professor Erwin read an exceed-
ingly interesting and scholarly article
on “The Technique of the One-Act
Play.” His hearers were greatly im-
pressed with his thorough knowledge
of the subject. It was voted unani-
mously by the club to have him make a
synopsis of the article to guide other
members in their work in the future.
This Professor Erwin kindly con-
sented to do.

A very important part of the pro-
gram was the first act of a play read by
its author, W. J. Cooper. This was the
first of a number of discussions that
will be held by various members of the
club this semester on “The One-Act
Play.”

Probably the most thoroughly en-
joyed part of the program came last
when delicious refreshments were
served. After a delightful social hour
the club adjourned until two weeks
hence.

bate was one of the best this year, The
men on both sides showed good pre-

PHI SOCIETY PROGRAM
COMPOSED OF NEW MEN

The new men in the Phi are coming
to the fore, Last Thursday night four
new men participated in the program.
W. Il. Fitts and C. E. Houston gave
declamations. Both of these men were
above the average in delivery, poise,
and easy position on the floor, ‘They
held the attention of their audience
throughout the performance. ‘The
Cremation of Sam McGhee,” by Fitts,
held the precedence of the two, though
the “Death of Benedict Arnold,” by
Houston, was not to be criticised.

The new men on the debate were J.
IF, Carrigan and A.B. Clator on the
affirmative, while 11. M. Wells and J.
Ii. Holtzhouser represented the nega-
tive. The debate, Resolved, That the
United States should have a System of
arbitration to settle labor ‘disputes
similar to that of Canada. The de-
cision committee rendered a unani-
mous decision in favor of the negative.

Professor Wagner thanked — the
society for electing him an honorary
member and, by request, gave an ap-
preciative criticism of the declama-
tions,

People Will Talk

If you love a man, he isn’t worth it.

If you don’t, you don't know what

If you lead him on, you're a flirt.

If you ignore him, you're a snob.

If he’s old, you're robbing the grave.

If he’s young, you're rocking the

If you stay at home, you're an old

If you don’t you're too gay.

DAVIDSONTAN BOW
(Continued from Page one)
a pretty return to midfield. Davis
gained cight yards on a short pass and
the game was ended,

For Davidson Taison and Davis on
the flanks played their usual ‘stellar
game, ‘Trinity rarely attempting end
runs, Martin backed up the line in
fine style. ‘The Methodists also had a
pair of nifty wing men in Captain Neal
and Carter. Smith, at quarter, played
a great game.

The game as seen by an eye wit-
ness:

From the very start Trinity leaped
forward with an attack on the tackles
and closer in that bent back the Da-
vidson defense. ‘The Methodists made
their most impressive drive in the first
few minutes. From his own 35-yard
line Smith called for a line attack that
swept down to the shadow of the Da-
vidson goal. On straight rushes
through tackle, varied by a delayed at-
tack at the same place, Trinity rushed
along for four first downs. In a pinch
Smith himself could always gain
through center, and Ladgerstadt, a
recent find at Trinity, drove hard
through the line.

The attack carried to the three-yard
line before Davidson could throw it
back with a fine defense all along the
line. Never once in this drive did
Trinity runners get outside tackle. It
was steady line work with little variety
but the forwards were clearing the
path and backs were shooting through
for steady, short gains.

Following a pupt and futile at-
tempts on both sides, Davidson ium-
bled in midfield and Trinity again
started toward the goal. Summers rose

twice in the line to hurl back drives,

but the Trinity backs fought their way
to the 25-yard line, never once swing-
ing wide. Then Smith changed his
generalship in a flash and sent Lad-
gerstadt wide around right end for 19
yards to the Davidson seven-yard line,
a shift in attack which worked beavti-
fully.

The quarter ended with Trinity on
the verge of the touchdown. It came
immediately after the second quarter
started. Two rushes gained slightly
and then Smith shot through a_ big
hole which Jimmy Simpson made in
the center of the line. His drive car-
ried yards behind the goal. Simpson’s
drop-kick for the extra point was
blocked. ,

For the remainder of the period
neither team made headway. Once
Brice, the Davidson center, blocked a
punt, picked up the ball with a clear
field ahead but juggled it around and
fumbled it, with Trinity recovering in
the scramble. Only one first down
was made in the quarter and Trinity
made that.

A bad pass by Brice got Davidson
into trouble early in the third quarter
but the ball was recovered on her 10-
yard line. Following the punt, Trinity
again opened an attack. A 16-yard
pass, Smith to Neal, carried to the Da-
vidson 20-yard line, but the Wildcats
fought off line plays, Smith shot
another pass which players on both
teams juggled in the air before Hen-
drix hauled it in on the five-yard line,
a close play, full of excitement.

Davidson punted and again ‘Irinity
Was attacking, Buta fumble gave the
alert Hendrix his chance and he
scooted 10 yards along the sidelines
before he was thrown. A pass from
the same Hendrix to Faison gained
seven yards and Hunt and Laird ham-
mered out small gains, with Hendrix
again slipping through for eight. Da-
vidson jwas showing real power now
and she drove pass the center of the
field, A penalty against Trinity helped
and then Hendrix shot a 25-yard pass
to Faison to the seven-yard line. ‘Two
rushes carried it to the ‘wo-yard line
as the quarter ended,

With a touchdown looking certain
Trinity threw back Hunt for ne gain
and on the fourth chance Captain
Moore, shooting at right tackle, was
lifted off his feet and thrown back. Tt
Was a great stand by Trinity. Punts
followed and Davidson tried hard with
passes, but without great success.
Trinity finally started from near the
center of the field and again the grind-
ing attack on the tackles drove to the
25-yard line. Time was almost up and
Simpson dropped out of the line as if
to pass.

But again Smith had changed his
tactics and Simpson threw a long pass
to Neal on the goal line and the Trinity
captain had only a few, steps to take.
Simpson’s drop-kick. for the point was
close but missed, The game ended
soon after,
