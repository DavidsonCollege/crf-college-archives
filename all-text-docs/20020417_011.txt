The Davidson men’s track and field team
traveled to UNC Charlotte last Saturday fora
- small, five-team meet in preparation for the
. upcoming conference tournament. The Wild-
cats competed against Charlotte, Wake For-
est University, NC State, and East Carolina,
placing fifth among tough competition.

Senior Jay Jahnes came through with the
highest place for the Wildcats last weekend,
finishing fifth in the 800-meter run in a time
of 1:54.10. The time puts Jahnes within the
top-ten list at Davidson and is fast enough to
place him in the top three in the current
conference standings. Jimmy Swansbrough
followed Jahnes in the 800-meter with a
season-best time of 1:59.34. Freshman Kevin
Bell was the lone Wildcat in the 1500-meter
run, placing sixth with a time of 4:13.25.

It was a Wildcat pack that finished in the
3000-meter run. Sophomore Ben Gaspar led
the Davidson runners in a time of 8:57.94,
followed by teammates Dave Bunge, Brad
Becken, and Chris Schmader.

Junior Freddie Bowie had Davidson’s top
finish in the springing events, placing sixth in
the 4000-meter. run with a time of 53.08. He
was followed by teammates Chris Rouisse and
David Oyler in times of 53.20 and 53.88,
respectively. Bowie also competed in the 200-

meter with a time of 24.77, finishing behind:

freshman John Leverett with a time of 23.33.

Drew Weber led the Wildcats in the hur- —

dling events, competing in both the 110-
meter and.400-meter hurdles. He had a time
of 16.83 in the 110-meter hurdles and 57.76
in the 440-meter hurdles. Teammate Johannes
Norling also ran the 400-meter hurdles, fin-
ishing with a time of 59.12.

The Wildcats will look to make a strong
impression at next week’s conference tour-

nament, April 18-20 at Eastern Tennessee .

State University.

Senior Dan Gibson, recently named the
Southern Conference runner of the week, will
look to lead the Wildcats on the track. He is
currently the leader in the conference stand-
ings inthe 1500-meter. With additional strong
runners Greg Scott, Greg Schernecke, and
Jahnes, the Wildcats will certainly have a
major impact on conference competition.

ibavidion har never participated in this re-

gatta, the members only had a vague idea of
how stiff the competition would be. While
there were some extremely strong programs
at Occoquan, five out of six of Davidson’s
boats managed to finish in the top three. -

Unlike most regattas, Occoquan does not
have preliminary heats followed by finals
for the boats that place in the top of their
heats. Instead, the regatta coordinators sim-
ply divide the boats into heats and‘ then
award a gold medal to the boat that finishes
first in each heat.

This lack: of finals proved frustrating for
some of Davidson’s rowers. For example,
even though the varsity men finished solidly
in second place with a time of 7:10.0, there
was not a finals event for them to compete
against the top finishers from the other heats.

they had not practiced in, the novice men
finished fourth in.their heat. The novice

women’s boats also did remakably well and
came in second and third in their respective
heats. Most of the novice women felt ex-
tremely positive about this race and are happy

_ to see that their dedication is finally paying

off. As Katie Bennett ’05 said, “We showed
huge improvement over our first regatta.
Walking boats finally made me realize why

I’ve been [working sohard]all season.” Fresh-

man Kim Newton agreed, “It makes me real-
ize that with hard work, great people, and a
common goal, anything is possible. Next

men’s pair came in an impressive second-
place, barely holding off the boat from
Carnegie Mellon that finished just one sec-
ond behind them. Brian Nickerson ’04 com-
mented that he was very happy with their
race, because it proved once again that the
rowers’ dedication and hours of practice are
paying off.

“We worked ‘hard over Easter,” said
Nickerson, “and we know that if you work
hard, you get results.”
