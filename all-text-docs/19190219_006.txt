MR. PARKER WRITES
OF WORK IN KOREA

Pyengyang, Korea, Jan. 2, 1919.
Dear Fellow Workers:

We closed our fall session on the 20th
of December, and at that time practi-
cally all of the college boys, and a num-
ber of the academy boys went out two
by two into the country to hold revival
services for a week or ten days. Most
of these boys are returning now, and
they give very encouraging reports of
their work. My secretary went out with
another boy to a church some distance
away where many had fallen away dur-
ing. the last few years from various
causes, and he reports that many of these
came back, and many new ones decided
to believe. “The churches were very an-
xious to have the boys come, and paid
all their expenses. All arrangements
were made through the College and
Academy Missionary Societies, so that
each call was supplied as far as possible.
The boys certainly showed a fine spirit
to be willing to give up almost. their
whole holiday to this work, and we feel
that they have been a great blessing
wherever they have gone. We have not.
as many boys as we had last year, but we
have a fine lot of Christian lads, and we
feel that work among them is indeed a
great privilege. Saturday we begin school
again, and we are looking forward to a
good year, 1 don’t think any of the boys
will drop out at this time.

We have had a most. delightful
Christmas in every way. On Christmas
Eve we had our community tree at the
Gillis’ home at 4:30 in the afternoon.
The children gave a nice program of
songs and recitations. “No presents were
given on the tree to foreigners, but each
one brought an offering of food or cloth
ing for the poor of the city, of which
there are so many suffering ones. Also
a collection was taken during the day for
a “home” for the poor, which the mis-
sionaries have undertaken to run. About
two hundred and sixty yen was subscrib-
ed by the community. This home is for
the down-and-outs, and provides a sleep-
ing place and a square meal—of millet,
which is considered the poorest grade of
food—for those who have no place to go.
The attractions are such as only those
who are in real want take advantage of
them, so that no one is helped who is not
needy. A great work has been done by
this home in the past. and we feel that
it is much needed. “Phe Korean who
has had charge of it heretofore was an
ideal man, who enjoyed his work, and
gave himself to it, making friends of
those who came in. and sacrificing self
in many ways. We are very sorry to
have lost him this year, and don’t know
what provision can be made, but we are
hoping and praying for the right man for
the place. It isn’t an casy position to
fill, and one has to be willing to give up
a home of his own in order to do the
right kind of work. Last year we gave
tickets to beggars who came to the door,
and these tickets entitled them to one
night’s lodging and board, but all the
plans have not been worked out yet for
this year, and we may find some better
way to do.

On Christmas day we sent around
cards and small remembrances to the
children of the community as usual, and
each one celebrated for themselves. At
ten in the morning and again at night
each of the city churches had a Christ-
mas program, the one in the morning be-
ing especially for the children. At this
service offerings were taken for the poor
also.

We had a mild December, and Christ-
mas day was not cold, but night before
last the wind began to blow, and yester-
dav and today have both been extremely
cold—to say the least. I went over to
my office at the school awhile ago to get
my tvpewriter—we had no fire in the
school building during the holidays, so

I have had to move over to the house—
and my hands almost froze off bringing

it home. Of course I ought to be get-
ting used to the cold now after three
winters of it here, but every year it seems
to be just a little worse than ever before.
And our coldest weather hasn't come
yet!

We are always glad to hear any news
from home, and we know that this has
been the merriest Christmas for a long
time. May the New Year bring you
each one many blessings and the greatest
happiness. As the.Koreans say, ‘Ten
thousand times ten thousand blessings be
yours.” Remember the work in your
prayers, As ever, your fellow worker,

W. 1. PARKER.

V. PLL. Game, Feb. 15.

The Wilcat quint played V. P. I. to
a wenderfully close score. After a slow
trip the team arrived at 8 p. m. at
Blacksburg and had to cat a light supper
and dress almost immediately. In the
first half V. P. I. put in some second-
strong men, and the game was rather
slow. Harrington had four shots to roll
out of the basket. This half ended 5-5.
In the second the first team of V. P. I.
were held almost to a standstill by the
Red and Black five. With ten seconds
in which to play, the score standing 18
to 17 in favor of V. P. L., one of their
guards pulled off a long shot and the
game ended 20-17. Schenck and Chal-
mers guarded in great style, while Har-
rington shot six goals.

Miss Reading, representing the “Ev-
erett Waddey Co.,” did a thriving busi-
ness here Friday.
