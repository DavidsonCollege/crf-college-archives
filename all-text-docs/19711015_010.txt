Nixon’s Plan Examined

Nixon economie game plan.
terming 1t “not such an awe

“Nixon was trying to check

Spaghetti Success
Feeds New Plans

By DAVID ARANT
Staff Writer

Due to the success of last
Saturday's spaghetti supper, the
cafeteria plans to serve a meal
every Saturday night.

The spaghetti supper was eat-
en by 130 persons, and this Sat-
urday a fish-and-chips supper
will be served.

Students Have complained
about the meal ticket which
allow them 20 meals a week.
but students points out that
they miss several breakfasts
and weekend meals when they
leave campus, Many would like
other students to be able to eat
in their place.

Manager of the cafeteria Ron
Scott said, “The rate of board
is based on the average parti-
cipation of the students.” This
participation is determined from
past averages, and since, the
avreage student does not eat 20
meals a week, he only pays for
this average number of meals.

“If we were to charge for 20
meals, the board would be
higher,” said Scott. The advan-
tage to the student is that he
ean claim 20 meals a week with-
out actually paying for that
many.

The $1.25 price limit on meals
from the snack bar line has
been eliminated, and unlimited
seconds will be allowed.

public,” Bronfenbrenner added.

Addressing the subject of the
American economy as it exists
today. Bronfenbrenner stated
that, “the economy would be
better if more firms were al-
lowed to fail when they get in
trouble.”

He pointed to the Penn Cen-
tral Railroad and the Lockheed
Corporation as examples of
two firms the administration
had helped financially to pre
vent bankruptcy.

“Alter all. business is based
on the premise of taking a
risk,” he said.

“The new owners might take
a hard line towards the unions.
The unions in turn, realizing
the possibility that the compa.
ny might fail, would make
more inodest demands,” he
noted.

Clodfelter, Colleagues Call
For Reform In Voting Laws

By ALEC HOON
Asst. Managing Editor

Five student body presidents.
including SGA President Danny
Clodfelter. issued a joint state
ment at a press conference in
Charlotte Thursday. appealing
to North Carolina Governor Bob
Scott and to the State legisla-
ture to change two voting pro.
visions for the upcoming May
presidential primary.

The two provisions in ques-
tion are that the primary will
be held on Tuesday instead of
on Saturday as has been done
in the past, and that voters are
unable to vate by absentee bal.
jot. :

In the press conference state-
ment. the presidenis announced
that “As student body presi:
dents of the colleges and uni-
versities of Meckienburg Coun-
ty and in conjunction with
groups of students and other
concerned citizens across the
state. we would ealt upon the
General Assembly to move the
primary date back to the [first
Saturday in May and to reform
the structures of absentee ball-
loting. and upon the Governor
to support the scheduling of
these items on the agenda oi
the coming special session of
the legislature.”

The presidents had hoped to
Meet with Seott when he was
in Charlotte on Friday to greet
President Nixon. but Seott’s of
fice announeed that they would
be unable to sce him because
he wond be hemmed in dr
Nixon's security.

On Wednesday, Scott. who was
in Charfotte. turned down a pet-
ition by loeal Democratic party
regulars Who are working in
conjunction with the five pre-
Sidents, to change the two vot-
ing Provisions, Saying that the

issues had been ‘‘thoroughly
discussed"” by the legislature,
according to The Charlotte Ob-
server.

Thursday's Observer report-
ed however that both North Car-
olina Lieutanent Governor Pat
Taylor who presides over the
state Senate and Phil Godwin,
the Speaker of the House of
Representatives, expressed their
approval for moving the pri-
mary back to Saturday.

Godwin said, ‘I never did see
the reason for changing from
Saturday in the first place."

Concern was expressed by
Godwin that the special ses-
sion was not the best time to
consider the change because the
session was supposed to deal
solely with the restructuring of
higher education and that ‘‘we
are going to be carried away
with a full blown  session."'

The primary day was chang-
ed to Tuesday in the first place
due to a study by the State
Flection Board showing that
the traditional Saturday turn.
out was substandard.

What they failed to consider
in analysing the statistic was

that the primary was on the
fourth Saturday in May, which
is the Memorial Day weekend.

This may have been one rea-
son for the small turnouts.

Being the first North Caro-
lina Presidential primary, the
importance of allowing all re-
gistered voters to express their
feelings is increased.

The principal reason that the
presidents feel that Saturday
would be a better day is that
it would enable students to vote
without cutting classes, and
transportation workers and
salesmen who are often gone
on weekdays, to vote.

As it now stands, one can-
not vote by absentee ballot in
a primary in North Carolina.
The presidents in their state-
ments felt that this presents
‘unnecessary obstacles to ef-
fective participation of  size-
able groups of the population
in the primaries.

‘Pleased to accept this new
responsibility of citizenship. we
request that we be given the
chance to exercise it in practice
as well as in theory,’ the joint
statement concluded.
