GRAHAM PLAN MODIFIED WHILE
VIRGINIA RESIGNS AT MEETING

Some Favor Abolishment But
Majority Vote For Milder
Regulations

SHEPARD ATTENDS MEET

Athletes Must Pass 24 Hours
Work to Play

Resignation of one of its
members and modification of
the Graham plan featured the
meeting of the Southern Con-
ference in Richmond, Va., Fri-
day and Saturday, Dec. 11-12.
Coach Norman Shepard repre-
sented Davidson at the con-
ference.

Immediately after the group had
convened Friday afternoon, the rep-

resentative of the University of
Virginia, Capt. Norton G. _ Prit-
chett (who was director of ath-

letics here before going to Virgin-

ia), delivered a letter of resignation]

from his institution, stating that
Virginia, having conscientiously
abided by the regulations of the

conference, felt that those rulings
failed to accomplish their purpose
and only bred a distrust and_ ill-
feeling among the member institu-
tions

Resignation Tabled

The conference decided not to
accept the resignation of Virginia
as yet, but to table it’ until next
year’s meeting, in hopes that offi-
cials of that school might see fit
to withdraw their resignation be-
fore that time.

According to Coach Shepard, the
