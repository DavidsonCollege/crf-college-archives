SIX VETERANS RETURN

Question On Right Of Congress
Over Supreme Court

About twenty student aspirants to
forensic honors will gather at 7:30, next
Friday, Noy. 15, in the Eumenian Liter-
ary Society Hall, to try out for the var-
sity debating team.

The question is: Resolved: That Con-
gress should be permitted by a two-thirds
majority to overrule any five-four de-
cision of the Supreme Court, declaring
a law unconstitutional.

Those trying out are: Wade Boggs,
Fitzhugh Dade, Wilbur Edwards, Paul
Harlan, Heywood Hill, Hector Me
Geachy, E. J..Mack, Torrey McLean,
Charles Mauze, William Rader, James
Salango, Gibson Smith, Robert Stewart,
Tyler Port, and Harold Sugg. of these
aspirants, those on last year’s team were
Wade Boggs, Tyler Port, James Salango,
and Harold Sugg, as regulars; and Wil-
bur Edwards and Paul Harlan, as alter-
nates. Last year was the first year of in-
tercollegiate debating for these regulars.

Freshman try-outs will be held during
the second week of December. All fresh-
men are urged to attend varsity try-outs
in order to familiarize themselves with
the methods and procedure.

The judges will be headed by Dr, C. K.
Brown, chairman of the faculty commit-
tee on debating. Other judges will be
Prof. E. J. Erwin, Prof. E. A, Beatty,
Dr. W. P. Cumming, and Prof. Archi-
bald Currie.

In the try-outs, each speaker will be
allotted five minutes to develop any one
or two points on either side Six regulars
and three alternates will be picked for
the varsity team.

Debates tentatively arranged for the
southern tour are with the University of
South Carolina and the University of
Miami. Others are also being consid-
ered,.On the western tour, the Davidson
group will meet Seewanee, University of
West Virginia, and Washington and Lee.
In the North, a tentative debate has been
arranged with Swarthmore and others
are being considered. Of these debates all
ready arranged, those with Washington
and Lee and University of South Caro-
lina are to be held in Davidson.

‘Whistling In The Dark’
To Be Presented Soon

“If work continues at its present rate,
the play ‘Whistling in the Dark’ will be
presented on the night of November 25,”
said David Herring, president of the Red
and Black Masquers. The play is being
directed by Dave Herring and W. F.
Pierce and is under the supervision of
Professor E. I. Erwin. The stage man-
agers are Earl Clark and Dunlap Covy-
ington,

Although the beginning of this play
has been reviewed in the Davidsonian be-
fore, the ending has been carefully guard-
ed. The directors will only make such
statements as the following: “We can't
tell you how Mr. Porter extricates him-
self from his predicament, but you've
never seen it done this way before.”

The predicament, as revealed by the
directors, is this: Wally Porter, a crime
novelist, and his fiancee, Toby Van Bu-
ren, find themselves in the hands of a
group of gangsters, who threaten them
with death if Wally cannot concoct a
fool-proof way to murder the Crime Com-
missioner. The clever plot which this
writer which he
promises will leave no clue and the se-
ries of events which follow in quick
succession are well worth seeing.

The cast includes the following char-
acters: ‘Wally Porter (acted by W. H.
Barrow)—obviously  well-bred, _ intelli-
gent looking, but timid; Joe Salvatore
(J. Y. Wilson)—dull as to wits but very
reliable; Slim (A. T. Port)—Slender,
nervous, fairly intelligent but a thorough-
ly unpleasant gangster; Herman (H. F.

New Gym Resounds To
Cries For Devil Blood

The gala Homecoming week-end
was officially’ started Friday night,
the eighth, with an impressive pep
meeting in the Alumni Gymnasium.

Cheerleader Joe Dees introduced
two new yells in honor of the oc-
casion. The ‘‘Beat Duke’”” moan was
popular, but the general concensus
of opinion was that the split stands
yell was too complicated for the
doubtful intelligence of the average
freshman. Freshmen stomped on the
floor instead.

At the end of the meeting cough
drops were distributed. Said cheer-
leeder Dees, “Five hundred free
boxes of cough drops were dis-
tributed.” Cough drops were Beech-
nut free samples—new brand.

Main features of meeting were
speeches by grads Harley Branch,
’27; Bill McCallie, '25; and P. G.
(Duke) Billy Ravenel, ’35. Speakers
were received with enthusiasm and
applauded with wild shouting, yell-
ing, and clapping.

Annual photographers took snaps
by flash of the assembled notables
which included alumni and girls.

Head Cheerleader Joe Dees ex-
pressed the opinion that we would
win our next two games by a large
score if the student body turned out
with the same fever pitch enthusiasm
at the next two pep meetings like
they so loyally did at this meeting.

Instigating the eager students to
even greater heights and fanning
the spark of hope into a roaring
conflagration of Wildcat determina-
tion, the cheerleaders Johnny Allen,
Ken Knorr, Salty Peters, and Gene
Vogler exhibited powers of inspira-
tion which the former pep meetings
have not brought forth.
