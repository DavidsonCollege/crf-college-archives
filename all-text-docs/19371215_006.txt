This poor old grad, in his freshman daze,
Adopted studious thoughts and ways,

He crammed his Turret Top with fact,
But never learned how one should act.

t’s simple arithmetic that the more cars

General Motors sells the greater this organiza-

tion grows. And the solid fact back of that
growth is this: General Motors cars must con-
tinually offer

more in terms of

extra value

to win those sales. It is only because General
Motors 7s great that it can maintain the re-
search and improvement program responsible
for such modern betterments as the Turret
Top, the Unisteel Body, No Draft Ventilation,

Knee-Action and advanced Hydraulic Brakes.
