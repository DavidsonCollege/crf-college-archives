Symposium On Careers

A two day symposium on career fields and issues will be held January
14 and 15. Debbie Carlton, coordinator of the symposium, said that its
purpose is to broaden students awareness of the demands that certain
careers require and the sacrifices that one must make in order to pursue
various careers.

“We as students are not qualified to make our career choice,’’ Carlton
said. ‘‘We tend to romanticize about careers and often make impulsive
decisions.’’ This symposium will be an information exchange between
experts in various career fields and the Davidson students.

Almost twenty fields will be represented by experts in their fields.
Most of the speakers are alumni who have shown strong support for the
symposium.

The schedule is as follows:

Wednesday, January 14

1:00 Open Luncheon: ‘‘Choosing a Career”
2:00 Career Issues Workshop

4:00 Career Fields Workshop

6:30 Banquet — tickets available

8:00 Panel discussion: ‘‘Career Values”’

Thursday, January 15

1:00 Luncheon

2:00 Career Fields Workshop

4:00 Career Issues Workshop

6:00 Dinner for guest speakers on Patterson Court
8:00 Keynote speech

The workshops will be very informal discussions. The panel discussion
speakers will represent the legal, business, political and medical fields.
Some of the topics that will be discussed throughout the sympo-
sium are ‘‘What Corporate Life is Like,’’ ‘‘Salary versus Job
_ Satisfaction,’ ‘‘Dual Careers’’ and ‘‘Career, Marriage and Family.”

More specific details concerning the various speakers will be
published after the Christmas holidays.
