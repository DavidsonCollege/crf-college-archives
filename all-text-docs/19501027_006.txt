Reformed High School Problem Child, “Abie” Klein,
Now Typical College Casanova and Campus Wheel

There appeared in the Capital of
the “peach state’ on November 5,
1929, a small bundle of individuality,
which was immediately labeled
“Williamsis Rupertus Kleinensis in
order to differentiate it from a
similar specie of the same order.

From that point, however, the
records of the growth and activity
of the speciman for more than 4
decade were obscured possibly by
ink or jam stained hands. It does
appear, though, that sometime dur-
ing this period the still immature
Kleinensis became a part of a cer-
tain gang (scientifically: subhumani
hoodlumus atlanti).

The first real evidence we have
of the character of the individual
deals with a narrow escape from
reform school. It seems that in
Junior High School certain of the
more unsettled and_ individualistic
students were given deficiency slips
to carry home to their parents.
But Bill (for brevity, we shall speak
of it hereafter using this apellation)
seemed to believe that the slips
could be more appropriately used
torn into confetti. At this point he
fell into disagreement with the
authorities and the threat of reform
school was presented. Needless to
say the democratic young fellow de-
cided to fall in with the majority
opinion on the issue.

At Boy’s High our object of
study must have made an immedi-
ate impression on his teachers. His
first semester he made a C, a D, and
two F's and continued with the
former grade throughout his high
schoo! career. He was said to have
had possibilities of becoming an
outstanding back on his football
team, but a broken collar bone
nipped’ this blossom in the bud.
Never the indolent type, this ac-
tive young mind turned to newer
and greener fields of conquest. More
will be said of this later:

To name his extracurricular -ac-
tivities in high school would require
too much space, but to describe two
of the more typical might give the
reader a general idea. Bill was al.
ways noted among that select
group which met in the upper sto-
ries of the school in the early
morning in order to drop bags of
water on nfembers of the faculty as
they entered the building. To show
the wide range of his character
he was also delighted in turning
on the water in the chemistry lab,
heating the handle to the faucet,
and then leaving both in that state.

Always somewhat of an enigma
to his teachers, he was at the same
time in one of the teen age gangs,
desirous of becoming a veterinar-
jan, an unimpressive scholar, an

Eagle Scout, and in love with a! Por tall infoymstion contect your nearest

senior at Agnes Scott.

Then came a change in the life
of Bill Klein. As a senior in high
school he was called to study for
the ministry, became inactive in his
high school fraternity, started teach-
ing Sunday School in a polio hospi-
tal, and made up his mind to come
to Davidson. He himself says that
at this point his whole life was
changed.

Little need be said to upperclass-
men concerning Bill's campus ac-
tivities: But for the benefit of the
freshmen: he runs the 440 on the
track team, is a member of Phi
society, the “D” Club, Phi Deita
Theta and the student council, and
is president of the Pan-Hellenic
council. Last year he was social
chairman on the YMCA cabinet.
Incidentally he has made A’s and
B's all three years. Bill has become
quickly recognized by members at
two consecutive freshman classes
because of the whistles he receives
when he makes an announcement
in chapel. ’Tis said that this is an
honor due to all holders of above-
mentioned social chairmenships.
However, in this case it might be
due to the general knowledge of
his ways with the fairer sex.

Perhaps his attraction to the la-
dies is due to something they see
in his eyes or maybe it is his stand
on the ideals of Chivalry. The latter
was once demonstrated in his
high school days when he got into
a fight to protect a certain young
lady from vulgar language. The out-
come was both participants being
arrested and released soon after
They met later that night at a drive-
in to finish what they had started.
A general free-for-all ensued. The
thing finally broke up when the
“other guy” had to be carried home.

had something to do with the out-

Much to the distress of the stu-
dent bodies of surrounding girls’
schools, Bill’s attention is focused
at present (and forever, so he says)
on Miss Dot MacLeod at Queens.
Bill sprained his ankle this sum-
mer and was forced to go to New
York for treatment. The fact that
Miss "MacLeod lives in New York
of course had nothing to do with
it.

His roommate, “Hoopy” Davis
who has to straighten Bill out

pected to blossom into young man-
hood this fall.”

Among their major engagements
in the 1949-50 season are appear-

tra under Eugene Ormandy and
with the Little Orchestra Society
of New York in a performance of
a new concerto for two pianos writ-
ten by Bohuslav Martinu and dedi-
cated to Lubshutz and Nemenoff.
Their annual Carnegie Hall reci-
tals are gala events in New York;
they average somewhere around
eighty performances a season—this
year this indefatigable duo set an
all time high in the final nine weeks
of their transcontinental tour when
they covered 56,700 miles from
March 1 to May 1.

In addition to their contribution
as performers, these two fine artists
have greatly enriched two-piano li-

ists and by the many beautiful ar-
rangements of compositions made
by Pierre Luboshutz for two pia-
nos. Pioneers in the duo-piano con.
cert, Luboshutz and Nemenoff are
responsibile for the high estate in
which it is today held among critics
and laymen alike, because of their
choice of programs and the high
level of their performance.

Before they formed their specta-
cular musical partnership both ar-
tists had distinguished themselves
as soloists both abroad and in this
country. They began playing two
pianos for the sheer pleasure it
gave them, and for the entertain.
ment of their friends. Out of these
informal recitals grew their public
conrert tours. They met in Paris
in 1929, when Mile. Nemenoff en.
rolled in a master class conducted
by Mr. Luboshutz at the Paris Con-
servatory. A romance ensued and
two years later when Pierre Lubo-
shutz was on his second tour of the
United States and Genia Nemenoff
on her first, they were married—
just three days after she arrived in
this country.

As brilliant and popular offstage
as they are on, the Luboshutz’ are
noted for their hospitality and in
between tours in New York their
charming home is a gathering place

Discussed In College Handbook

Most important characteristic of
a good roommate, say college stu-
dents is consideration.

This is the general conclusion of
the “College Board” of the Going-
to-College Handbook whose fifth
annual edition has just been pub-
lished here by Outlook: Publishers.

Students from all over the U. S.
A.—150 of them—were asked,
“What Makes a Good Roommate?”
Their replies, summarized by the
handbook editors, are:

A GOOD ROOMMATE: (1)
Is considerate (about lights, radio,
use of room, etc.); (2) respects per-
sonal property and privacy; (3) is
loyal; (4) goes at least half.way;
(5) helps keep a neat room; (6)
can discuss controversial questions
without getting ruffled; (7) makes
reasonable adjustments; (8) keeps
reasonable hours; (9) cultivates a
cheerful disposition.

The College Board also offered
some negative impressions, as these
students said: AN UNDESIR-
ABLE ROOMMATE: (1) Thinks
chiefly of self; (2) makes unreason-
able demands; (3) betrays confi-
dences; (4) borrows without asking;
(5) leaves things scattered around;
(6) argues heatedly; (7) is nosey—
and noisey; (8) comes in late and
wakes everybody up; (9) is too sol-
itary—or too sociable.

The College Board was also
queried about other topics, with
answers reported in the current is-
sue of the Handbook: (1) What
practical suggestions would you
make about clothes for college?
(2) If you could go back to high
school days, what changes would
you make in preparing for college?
(3) What is the most inspiring or
revolutionary idea you have yet

would you suggest to the in-coming
student about extra-curricular ac-
tivities? (5) Is part-time work
good for a college student or not?

Handbook editors express their
strong conviction that a free col-
lege press, with its recognized dan-
gers, is more desirable than a muz-
zled press. ‘They also point to what
they feel is a vast unconcern on the
part of students toward many of
the most important and pressing is-
sues of the day. On this point, Dean
Rusk, Assistant Secretary of State,

explicit word than “thing.” I will

that he compare the two words and
draw his own conclusions.

In conclusion, though I am
startled by the lack of sense in the
attacks on my article, I am pleased
to note that either the attacks de-
feated themselves by their own
egregious blunders or else as in the
case of Mr. Bell’s letter, they ac-
tually strengthened my position.
Once again, I would advocate the
change. Let us not be fooled by

expressed his opinion in the Hand-
book: .

“Vital interest in pressing so-
cial issues is present among most
students and would assert itself if
given a chance—by an imaginative
curriculum, interested professors.
sensitive student and community
leaders.”

John Oliver Nelson, professor in
Yale Divinity School, writes on
“Finding Your Life Work in Col-
lege,” and E. Fay Campbell, higher
education leader, of Philadelphia,
offers a word of advice on “How
to Choose Your Courses”; While
Hunter B. Blakely, Richmond, Va.,
discusses “Choose Your College
Wisely.”

Other writers in the 60-page vol-
ume include Muriel Lester, of Lon.
don, who says in an article to col-
lege students, “Keep Your Eyes
Open for the Greatest Adventure.”

Campus Interviews on Cigarette Tests
Number 4... THE COMMON. LOON

Me

O.. fine-feathered friend isn’t being “taken-in”
by all those tricky cigarette tests you hear so much about! A fast puff of
this brand—a sniff of that. A quick inhale—a fast exhale--and you're
supposed to know all about cigarettes. No! You don’t have to rely on quick-

tricks. The sensible way to test a cigarette is to smoke
pack after pack, day after day. That’s the test.

Camel asks you to make...the 30-Day Mildness Test.

Smoke Camels—and only Camels—for 30 days. Let your
own “T-Zone” (T for Throat, T for Taste) be your
proving ground. And when you've tried Camels as a
steady smoke, you'll know why...
