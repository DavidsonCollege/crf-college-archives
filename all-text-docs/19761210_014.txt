Ta-Tas present annual tally

By THE
- BODACIOUS TA-TA’S

The recent complaint of the
laundry that it is being-swam-
ped with pungent, putrid,
rancid white socks and jocks
indicates one of two things.
Either Mark Shelley has deci-
ded to take his laundry down,
or 5-on-5 basketball has com-
menced.

Relying on the type of
investigative reporting we are
infamous for, we have dis-
cerned that the latter is true.
Shelley’s laundry is still in his
room

NARRRARRAA

This issue includes the first
annual Ta-Ta Tally. The tally
attempts to pick the teams
that best exemplify six hap-
hazardly chosen bodacious
categories:

Most Deteriorated. Captain
Climax and the King Colons, a
band of burned out biology
majors, who by season’s end
will be recognized as Private
Prostration and the Consti-
pated Colostomies.

Most Dangerous. Pershing
Rifles, sometimes referred to
as the Slaughterhouse Five.
This gang of ex-SWAT men

has never played more than
one half of a basketball game
due to their unusual half-time
drills, in which they line up
their opponents and execute
them.

Most Disgusting. Gomers
Pyle, a contemptuous assem-
blage of foul gutter rabble.
Opponents are especially re-
pulsed by Franks Fartz, the
precursor of Gomers Pyle.

Most Obnoxious. Squatty
Bodies, a team of bellowing
blimps to whom the word
deodorant has no meaning.
The Squatty Bodies’ most
effective defense is to have one
of their team members sit on
the opposing team while the
remaining four Bodies take
turns scoring at will.

_Most Ingenious. Cancelled,
a phantom fivesome whose
name alone causes most op-
posing teams not to show up

at all.

Most Congenial. Five Easy
Pieces, a promiscuous pentad
that pollutes its rivals with
private pre-game parties, ren-
dering them unfit for play.

Best Team. Monolithic De-
fenders of the Faith, the only
team that smacks of purity, a
team whose religious dedica-
tion to basketball should allow
them to ascend to the cham-
pionship.

Worst Team. Sloppy Sec-
onds, a degenerate, immoral,
malicious squad of munchkins
who will finish no higher than
second in any game they play
this season.

So concludes the first an-
nual Ta-Ta Talley. Being the
all-knowing authorities on
IMAC basketball, we urge you
to feel safe in betting all your
meal tickets on these sure-fine
forecasts.

Cheerleader squad leads Wildcats

By STAN HALES
Staff Writer

BRUCE HOLLIDAY
Sports Editor
One of the most improved
squads on the Davidson ath-

letic scene this year is that of
the Wildcat cheerleaders.
From tryouts through summer
camp. to weekly practices,
enthusiasm and dedication
have made the difference be-
tween this year’s cohesive
group and the backbuster
squads of past years.

For the cheerleaders, the
season began in Knoxville,
Tennessee, at summer where
the cheerleaders not only
learned new drills and routines
but more importantly got to
know each other. Words such
as ‘‘cohesive’’ and ‘‘gregar-
ious’’ were used by several
describing the group.

Their cohesion and enthu-
siasm didn’t end with summer
camp, but has carried over

... Shooters’ spirits high

[ Continued from page 13]

Other Davidson shooters in
Saturday’s match were senior
Rob Mitchell with 246, sopho-
more Andrew Mac Donald
with 242, freshman Mike
Pearson posting 221, fresh-
man Robert Kirkendol shoot-
ing 217, freshmen Berkley
Mann and Louis Williams
with 197 and 191 respectively.

“Our spirits are pretty high;
we have a good time and we all
enjoy shooting. Everyone is
looking forward to our return
match with N.C. A. & T. in
January and then our South-
ern Conference match with
William and Mary in early
February. We lost to William
and Mary last year but this
year things should be differ-
ent,” said Niblock.

Coach Flannigan feels that
if his team continues to im-
prove at the present rate
Daivdson will have a real
chance to capture some gold in
the Southern Conference and

W.C.C. tournaments in the
spring. 2

“We're only half way into
the season and have a 9—38

record already. Everyone. ex-
pects to do much better than
last year’s record of 13—10,”’
says Flannigan.

into weekly practice sessions,
almost unheard of in past
squads. These practices mark
efforts on their part to reach
and maintain a high degree of
consistency and competence,
reached to some degree as
evidenced by awards they
have received.

But, no matter what goes on
in summer camp and weekly
practices, Davidson cheerlead-
ers, just like their more athle-
tic counterparts on the field,

are measured by how they
perform during the game.
Whatever it is they’re doing, it
works. As even the cheerlead-
ers themselves have noticed,
never before have crowds been
so responsive and in tune to
what the cheerleaders were
doing. They like to attribute
this not only to their improve-
ment, but also to the David-
son football and basketball
players whose improvement
has made their task more
enjoyable.
