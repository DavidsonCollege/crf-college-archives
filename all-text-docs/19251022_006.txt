Followers of the ‘gridiron sports in this

Laval is using this year. This formation is

Turning over to the nineteenth chap-
ter of Luke, Mr. Glasgow cited the in-
cident where Jesus dined at thefrouse of
Zaccheus and how Jesus converted him.
|“A sordid and contemptible little Jew
was changed into a respectable man and
| Christian,” Mr. Glasgow stated, “and in
|the same way Jesus will take us today

|and make us Christian, men of worth.”

The last speech of Jesus’ that was re-
ferred to, was the one in which we find
Jesus asking Peter if he loves Him. He

asked Peter this question three times and
| each time Peter answered in the affirm-
|ative but the last time, his answer was
more passionate. He had to ask this dis-
ciple this question three times to have the
| right effect; Peter had his mind on things
of the world. “Just in the same way,
we are prone to let our mind and body
follow sensual things and we have to
| have constant reminding of the real
things in life.”

I like college fine except that you have to|
study a lot, and that takes up so much of |
your time. We go to breakfast and then to

guns, too, just like those that Hank Sed- |

They had a football game here the other
day. I wish you could have seen it. You
know I always thought football was a kind
of a disease, something the matter with your
feet until I came here, but it ain't. Some-
body else’s team came down here and all the |
college fellers sat up on the seats and yelled |
to go get em wilecats. I didn’t see no wile-
cats out there, so I thought they must be
foolin’. After a while a man who had forgot
to put’ on his pants came out in his white
wihter underwear and blew a whistle. - You
know he didn’t wear red flannels like mine.
They were real white like the ones in Sears
Roebuck. I started to go tell him that he
forgot his breeches, but as there were some
ladies there and ‘he did not seem to notice
he had forgot them I didn’t want to embar-
rass him, Well that football game was a

any breeches ran down there and patted him

Then they all got lined

fellow must have got mad again, for he
kicked the ball so hard that it went sailing

that was on the frame, They didn't have a
bit of hay on those frames, and I didn’t see
‘any growing around here, either. Maybe
they didn’t plant anything on the ground
this year. I guess they was letting it rest.
Pa, you told me I wouldn't need that big
yellow and green striped wool shirt that I
wore all last winter when I was chopping
cord wood, but every feller up here has one,
and I want mine, too. Lots of the fellers
wear plow shoes, too, and I don’t think
some of them know much about plowing,
cause lots of them have real muddy shoes,
and you know it will ruin the ground to
plow when it is muddy, won't it? I am
going to tell them when I get a chance.

You know that pair of garters you
bought me down at the settlement before |

days after I got here. Nobody wears them,
they just let them sag, and don’t seem to
mind it a bit. . So I just.Jet mine sag, too.
