MR. SPENCE

Davidson Has

Well-Known

Hotel Man in Mr. Spence

Mr. Earl Spence is one of those
men around the campus whom we
see little of but who nevertheless
is a very necessary part of the col-
lege machinery. Planning the menu
for the college dining hall and see-
ing that it is carried to completion
‘is Mr, Spence’s job and he does it
well. - \

Mr. Spence was born in Nor-
folk, Virginia, and attended Wil-
liam and Mary College. His voca-'
tion has assumed many forms and
has taken him many places. For a
time he was on a diner belonging to
the Union Pacific Railroad. Later
he was in charge of the private din-
ing hall of ‘the publishers of the
New York “Times”. Here the
“Times” staff entertained Edward,
Prince of Wales, and other Joyal
figures. At another time in New

York Mr. Spence operated over
one hundred cafeterias for 30,000
employees of the American Tele-
phone Company. He has operated
hotels in Greensboro, N. C,, and
elsewhere, and has been president
of the Southern Hotel Association
and Vice-President of. the Ameri-
can Hote! Association.

‘He came. to Davidson during the
war when an army unit was sta-
tioned at the college and has re-
nained since that time in charge
of the dining hall. (He claims to
be one of the evils that came in
with the army and has never left).
He is very fond of Davidson and
hopes to remain here.

His only son was graduated from |
the college in 1934 and his daugh-
ter is serving now in Japan as a
librarian with the army of occupa-
tion,

in time of need, but his only com-

ment was, “It was close.”

Soon after the tennis matches
were completed, the results from
the golfing events began to come
in, and although all the individual
scores are not available, the match
ended im a tie — 74% to 7%. Dr.
McGavock and Ray Brown won
their foursome, and the _ brilliant
putting of Mumpsy Millar, teamed
with the superb all-round golf of

In the volley balt event which
followed the brilliant play of the
faculty’s team, failed to stop the ex-
cellent net game of ‘the Seniors.
and the latter took the event in two
straight games 21-7 and 21-9.

Last but far from least was the
softball game, in which the sen-
iors, led from in front of the mound
by Smith and Dubose, and from
the plate by Grover L.ce,. Dave Mil-
ler and several other potential
greats, sneaked by the faculty all
stars on a 9th inning rally by the
narrow margin of 22-7.

And so the glorious victory was
accomplished, just as the Seniors
walked from the field with — their
laurels, all was not sweetness and
light for them, for several profes-

Rev. McClure opened a spirited
ten-minute talk with “I am caught

. an ODK chain on my watch

His delivery emphasized the funda-

mental and essential importance of |

recognizing leadership on the cam-
pus and in life.

pus and in life. The eternal quality
of Christian leadership was lauded,
“A man’s soul disciplined, gov-
erned, lifted by that spirit about
him to the highest ends of life”
was to be strived for. The chal-
lenging leader to be cherished and
followed, said Rev. McClure, was
the “matchless Galilean, the Cap-
tain of all men’s souls.”

The formal initiation took place
in the faculty room, second floor
of Chambers, at 5:30 Wednesday
afternoon. The evening found the
ODK group at the Guest House

Elections Board Suggest Revisions

Last Friday, May 12, Dave Mil-
ler, as chairman of the elections
board, read to the student body a
set of recommendations for improv-
ing the present regulations govern-
ing student elections. These sugges-
tions were presented not as an
amendment to the constitution «
the student government, but oniy
as a broad outline by which the
amendment may be later created.

The elections board formed these
ideas from their own experiences
in running the elections this year.
They felt that the present system
is unsatisfactory to most of the
student body and that something
should be done while elections are
fresh in the minds of the student
body, Therefore the student coun-
cil suggested that the plan be pre-
sented to the students for consider-
ation, However, no action will be
taken until September, when the
student council will go to work on
the plan. °

The boards outline as read in
chapel is as fullows:

I. NOMINATIONS:

(A) Student Body Nominating

Convention (Tuesday).
Nominations from the floor for:
1. Student Body officers.

Elections within 24 hours after the
conventions.

3. A very brief statement of ac-
ceptance by the nominee would be
necessary to validate a floor nom-
ination.

4. As indicated above, all offices
voted on by Student Body as a
whole would be nominated the
same day. Same for, classes.

Il. VOTING ¢

used to insure secrecy.

a prescribed precinct desk (alpha-
betically).

qualified would be presented to the
Student Body for election. The
Publications Board would be com-
posed of the retiring editors and
business managers of the three pub-
lications, plus three faculty men.

Another suggestion of the board,
which by an oversight was not men-
tioned, is that the election of head
cheerleader be.as it has been in the
past except that all nominees be
required to have served one year
as a Davidson cheerleader.
