THE DAVIDSONIAN

ATHLETICS ALL

Coach Tilson’s Gridmen
Start Spring Training

Over Eighty Uniforms Issued to
Football Candidates—Several
Games Arranged

Regular spring football practice started
Monday afternoon under the coaching of
Coach Rawson, Coach Tex Tilson being
away on a football trip. Two weeks will be
spent on the fundamentals, and conditioning
work, Then an additional two weeks will
be taken up with work on signals and scrim-
maging. Coach Tilson has planned to stage
a regular game each Saturday in March.
Two squads will be selected as everly as pos-
sible to oppose each other in these contests.
These will be conducted as far as possible
like a regular varsity game, and the competi-
tion will no doubt be very keen.

The practice will be carried on through |
March if it can possibly be done. Regular
practice of baseball and track may interfere
with the continuance of football, but it will
be carried on until then,

Coach Tilson has announced that those
who draw a uniform and then cease practice
without a very good excuse will not be given
another uniform at any time. Anyone who
intends going out for football in the fall
must come out for this spring practice or not

Eighty uniforms had been issued from the
gymnasium through last Monday, and it is
expected that more will be demanded during
the first week of practice. Freshmen will
join in this practice also, and it is expected
that quite a few of them will make a good
showing for the varsity.

The Davidson Wildcats have again swung
into action after having struggled manfully
with exams for the past two weeks, and are
on the last half of the schedule now. Hav-

and Wake Forest, this week, they complete
the week of games with Durham Elks here
tomorrow night. Next week they have only
one game scheduled, that being with the
Charlotte “Y” in Charlotte. The game
scheduled with Stetson University here was
called off.

The Charlotte game is expected to bring
out a lot of fight in both teams. Charlotte
has been met and conquered once this year,
but that was at the first of the season, ‘and
on the Davidson court. The game will be
played on the Charlotte court, and this gives
them an advantage. They have shown won-
derful improvement since playing Davidson,
and are putting in a claim as one of the best,
if not the best, “Y” team in the two Caro-
linas,

fort to sce both of these games, for they
have but a few more chances to see Davidson
in action this year, for the team takes a Vir-
ginia trip that will practically wind up the
season for them,

Three more volumes of The Oxford
| English Dictionary have recently been
purchased, making a total of six vol-
umes now in the college library. The
final volume of this dictionary, which is
the tenth, is now under preparation, and
portions of it have already been pub-
lished.

The collection of the materials which
are used in this dictionary began in
| 1857 with the appointment of the Philo-
logical Society in London of a commit-
tee for the collection of words unregist-
‘ered in existing dictionaries. It now
extends to 14,597 pages and deals with
391,710 words, illustrated by 1,704,318
quotations. The price of the nine vol-
| umes which have already been completed
|is over two hundred and fifty dollars,
and yet this amounts to only about one
and: one-half cents a page.
| The Time (London) says: “In three
points, at least, the dictionary has no
|rival. These are: First, the scientific
treatment of etymology; secondly, the
| historical continuity of usage; thirdly,
| the precision of reference in the illus-
trative passages quoted.”
