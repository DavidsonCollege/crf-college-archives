Gas prices around Davidson
are edging past one dollar a
_ gallon according to a recent

‘Davidson survey.

Prices range from 92.9 cents
per @allon for regular at the 7-11
on the edge of Cornelius to 104
cents for premium at Archer’s
Texaco.

Procedure provides for sanc-
tions for honor code violations
ranging from a warning to
indefinite suspension. It can
only be amended by the Student
~ Conduct Council (SCC). Terry
‘said he does plan to submit «
proposal to SCC to codify the
new policy.

- Both Terry and McEwen said
they. were confident that the
decision would not have nega-
tive effects such as making
students reluctant to report
violations or the Honor Council

‘“‘The honor system becomes
such .a part of people around
here.” McEwen also said that,
since the Honor Council deter-
mines guilt or innocince indep-
endently of sanction, there
would be “no impact on mem-
bers’ ability to make an equit-
able decision.”

Though most station opera-
tors predict that prices will
continue to rise in coming
months, they say gas shortages
are unlikely. An employee at
Cashion’s Gulf station on Main
Street said there had been no
problems getting gas shipments
for over two months. In fact, he
said he could get a shipment
within two days if needed.

The Dean of Students still
has the authority to decide not
to press charges if there is
insufficient evidence of a viola-
tion. ‘We don’t want a ‘big
brother-is watching you’ atmos
phere,”’ Terry said.

“When there are open, unlocked -

rooms with wallets laying out in
the open or in pants pockets on
the bed, it is hard to prevent
theft,” Bolding said.

“It is no great insult to the
honor code to lock a door when
there is no one around,”’ he
added.

Bolding also asked students
to “‘be aware of strangers on the
halls. Ask someone what he
needs if he looks like he doesn’t
belong.”
