Transfers Get Better

Grades

CORVALLIS, Ore. (CPS) -- Stu-
dents who transfer to Oregon State
University in their junior or sen-
ior years have higher grade point
averages than students who
Started at OSU, a study by OSU
researcher, Carol Kominski
found.

Two year campus transfer
students’ averages tend to be 10
to 15 points higher that the OSU
average. Though the transfer stu-
dents’ grades drop after they en-
rollat OSU, they stay higher than
average, Kominski concluded.

“What this study shows,”
Kominski said, “is that commu-
nity college students can be very
successful if they choose to con-
tinue their education at a univer-
sity.”

Women
RICHMOND, Va. (CPS) -- Abo
500 alumni and “friends” of Vir-

lawmakers not to force the all

desirable.”

Regarding methods for
Davidson students to prepare them-
selves for the workplace, Edmunds
stated clearly, “do something! |
throw that out more as achallenge
than anything else.” Edmunds
urges Davidson students to explore
the opportunities around them, and
not to become too narrow in what
they are doing while at school.

Edmunds also offered a check-
list of qualities for which employ-
ers look, and things students can
do to aid their marketability.

1) Be inclusive of human be-
havior courses in your curriculum
at Davidson. Social sciences are

™ very important to the development

of understanding in the workplace.
2) Engage in extra curricular
activities to learn teamwork and

Entreprenuer Edmunds '80 spoke at the Eleventh Hour. :

By David Thompson

During last Thursday’s 11th
Hour lecture, Amy Edmunds ’80,
discussed employment-related is-
sues and offered several sugges-
tions for Davidson students who
wish to make themselves more
marketable in the workplace. .. ..
This Halifax, Virginia native has
10 years of sales and sales manage-
ment experience, is a member of
the Better Business Bureau and the
Small Business Council; among
other organizations dealing with

employment in Charlotte.

She also owns and operates two
firms, Executive Reflections and
Executive Essentials, which aid
both personnel departments for
Fortune 500 companies, as well as
those seeking employment with
such corporations.

Her writings have been pub-
lished in over 15 newspapers, and

on Tuesday. evenings at 8:00pm;.
Edmunds hosts television show on
Cable channel 8 called “Executive
Reflections”. As if her schedule
were not full already, Edmunds
also devotes time each month toa
modeling career, and she can be
Seen in certain advertisements in
the Charlotte area.

Edmunds stressed the impor-
tance of internships to one’s
Davidson experience. “Davidson
can become very utopian, very
tranquil,” she said. “Internships
can shake it up”.

While at Davidson, Edmunds
engaged herself in several intern-
ships which helped her decide what
she did want to do by showing her
things she did not want to do. Of
herinternshin at The Charlotte Oh-
server, forexample, Edmunds said,
“trying to make news when there is
no news is not something I found

look for team players.

3) Develop listening skills.
Students too often become. frus-
trated with their jobs because they
are not willing, or just unable to
listen. In today’s economy one
should not take their jobs for
granted, and need to listen care-
fully to. the needs and wants of
their employers.

4) Employers. see leadership
ability as an absolute necessity.
Technical knowledge is not
enough, people must be able to
motivate a group to action.isie104

5) Flexibilty.is'a must.-Don’t be
afraid to take on ‘responsiblities
which lie outside of your stated job
description.

6) Develop a sense of urgency
about yourself. Be willing to putin
the-extra-time required to distin-
guish yourself as both a student
now, and as an employee in the
future. Edmunds suggests that if
you cannot name at least two char-
acteristics that set you apart from
the crowd, you need to develop
them. f

7) Finally, Edmunds urges a
sense of perspective. Do:not lose
yourself, your identity, in your
work. Know the importance of
what you do, but realize that your
wark exnerience chanid nat he all
consuming. Where you are em-
ployed isa part of your life, but not
your whole life.
