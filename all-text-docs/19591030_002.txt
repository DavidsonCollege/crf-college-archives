Student Council: “A Weak Sister’’?

What has happened to the Student

Council? In the past it has been the

most active, most influential student
organization on campus. Right now
it has, by its own inactivity, relegated
itself to a position below its tradition-
al “weak sister” the YMCA.

The Student Council will soon find
itself the ‘‘weak sister’ in the eyes
of the student body if it does not
move. We are quick to judge.

The fact that honor cases are no
longer under the jurisdiction of the
Council is no justification for inactivi-
ty. This was innovated, in fact, to re-
lease the Student Council from this
time-consuming function and allow
more time for communication be-
tween the students, faculty and ad-
ministration.

We face too many problems that

need to be resolved, or at least dis-
cussed in open forum, to remain
aloof.

Last year President Green pro-
posed to hold meetings in fraternity
houses to gain greater participation.
His proposal recognizes a need, even
if it does not satisfy it. We favor well-
publicized forums of a vital nature
held in the Union Ballroom.

We need more than anything else
to develop a liberalism of thought and
action that -will permit open criticism
of a positive nature wtihout hesita-
tion or fear.

The student body cannot now be
condemned for seeming indifference.
We wait for the Student Council to
provide the impetus that will enable
students to have a voice in the solu-
tion of all problems.

The Necessary Evil

The sudden tendency toward the
lackadaisical things regarding schol-
astic and the pleasant urge to day-
dream more than usual reminded us
this week that Homecoming was
drawing near—if, for some peculiar
reason, we might have forgotten it.

In a way it brings . disquieting
thoughts, for it also reminds us that
we. despite the security fostered on
the hill, are disturbingly dependent
on something from the outside world

‘namely the opposite sex.

Sometimes we hate to admit it,
girls. but we guess you’re pretty im-
portant to us. You must be, for you
change our whole mode of existing.

You change us from unshaven
lads in dirty khakis and wrinkled
sweaters to immacuately attired Da-
vidson Gentlemen, robed in the latest
Ivy League fashions.

You change us from sincere ideal-
ists, dedicated to academic inquiries,
to devout hedonists dedicated to....
well, you know what we mean.

You change our campus from a
Georgian monastery into a Garden
of Eden. .

Yes, we’ve got to admit it, girls—
you are important to us. So give us
a good time this weekend, girls. We
need plenty of pleasant memories to
help us face Monday. morning.

J.H.

Salesmen Of Sloth

In dispute after labor dispute this
year, companies have tried to get at
the problem of union featherbedding.
And important though this problem
of pay for no work is, it seems to us
to reflect an even more serious mat-
ter.

That is the apparent acceptance
by many Americans of the idea that
they don't need to work very hard,
their apparent preference to get by
with the least effort and indeed to
demand progressively higher pay for
progressively less work.

We realize that statement is sub-
ject to the perils. of any generaliza-
tion. We also realize that part of this
country’s high material standards is
this ability of individuals to live com-
fortably on the basis of relatively few
hours of work. We further realize
that many men nonetheless do work
extremely hard and \that some, or so
it is said, thereby drive themselves
to early graves...

Throughout American industry
there is a discernible employe apathy.
Throughout the American economy
there is featherbedding — railroad
firemen paid to tend non-existent
fires, musicians paid for not playing,
farmers paid for not farming, pilots
paid for not flying, everywhere men
paid for watching machines that do
not need watching.

At this point it might appropriate-
ly be asked: If all this is so, how come
the productivity of labor is said to be
constantly increasing? The plain an-
swer is that the rising productivity of
labor is largely a misnomer. Capital
investment in ever more productive
machinery is the answer.

It is impossible not to wonder
about the attitude of people who ac-
cept pay for no work, year in and
year out, or who do the least possible
—a form of inactivity that might be
called unofficial featherbedding. It is
impossible not to wonder what has

-—

happened to their self-respect.

Hére again there is an answer.
Union ‘leaders not only sanction and
encourage all forms of featherbed-
ding; they defend the practices.

Immorality exalted, it appears,
ceases to be immorality. And the
union example is followed elsewhere.

Conspiring with and reinforcing
this union attitude is the govern,
mental philosophy fashionable in our
time. Ths would remove from the in-
dividual many of the cares of dealing
with life, and most particularly re-
move his sense of responsibility; in
a word, spare him the bother of be-
ing 4 human being with inherent dig-
nity and self-respect. It is not so sur-
prising if many people are willing to
do little when Government presumes
to do all.

So much for causes. The effects
are also evident with increasingly
painful clarity. Frequently shoddy
workmanship. Crippling strikes for
whimsical reasons. Disdain for the
contract. The enormous economic
toll of featherbedding which is rapid-
ly turning this into a high-cost econ-
omy, as reflected in the inability of
U.S. products to compete as once they
did in world markets. Perhaps most
important of all, the erosion of values
once held high. ”

We are not calling for some nebul-
ous national moral resurgence,
though the problem is a moral one.
We are saying that if there ‘is softness
in America today it is not primarily
inferior education or “inadequate”
public spending but this union and
Statist-sponsored philosophy of indol-
ence. There are other countries, some
friendly and some otherwise, where
that philosophy does not obtain.

And we are saying that a little
moral indignation ought to be direct-
ed at the salesmen of sloth that
weaken our society.

A SPECIAL DAVIDSONIAN POLL

Seven College Girls View ‘The Davidson Gentlemen”

Randolph-Macon

There is so much that could
be said in praise of Davidson.
This definition only illustrates
a few of the examples which
distinguish Davidson, to a girl,
from some other schools.

gentleman — (jen-t’I-man),

n. 1. Davidson a. Polite. The
girl on a weekend feels that
she is respected by her date
and his friends. Upon enter-
ing a room seats are offered,
and everyone is immediately

introduced to her. Most im-
portant, at parties she feels
at ease!

b. Natural. No “airs” or com-
ments by her date to prove how
sharp he thinks he is ate found.
Because he is such a great per-
son anyway, this isn’t neces-
sary. Especially is this import-
ant when her date is someone
she doesn’t know very well or
a blind date.

There is none of the ten-
sion which would otherwise
have occurred, and the girl
soon feels as much af ease
as she would if he were a
boy from home.

c. Friendly. This word de-
scribes the whole atmosphete
of the school and the weekend;
and the boys create the atmos-
phere. Upon arriving she feels
welcome and upon leaving she
feels missed.

Has Sin Triumphed At Dav

1836: From the records of
the Davidson College Church:
“A report having gained credit
that about Christmas of 1838,
A.D., one of our members (a
college student) had taken
some part with a company of
youths in dancing, the session
held an interview with him in
which he acknowledged the
crime and professed in a satis-
factory manner a feeling of re-
gret and repentance. His regu-
lar standing in the Church was
therefore continued.”

1899—From a letter by Dr.
J. B. Johnston, Class of 1901:
“One spring, 1899, Winthrop
College came up to spend the
day with us. They landed here
about ten o'clock in the morn-
ing and by one o’clock they had
seen everything that was to be
seen about Davidson .

Well, on this particular day
by 1:30 there was nothing to do
but sit around and wait for the
train. Somebody suggested a
dance and everybody agreed.
We rounded up a few guitar
and mandolin players and
everybody flocked to the old
Commencement hall and they
danced straight through until
train time, which was about
five o'clock

1900—Student dances (secret)
held in Charlotte (From Mr. F.
L. Jackson, 1906): “The stu-
dents began to give dances im-
mediately after commencement
in Charlotte. These were kept
out of the newspapers and were
regarded as not officially col-
lege dances though only David-
son students and their dates at-
tended.

The Roaring Twenties: “Stu-

dents gave dances in Charlotte, |

Mooresville, Concord or any-

looking, and intelligent, so 1
am told, since my psychology
teacher said the average 1.Q.
at Davidson is 145 — but |
wonder.

However, he is quite special
and his ability for planning
dance weekends is certainly an
indication of intelligence and
good taste.

The spirit of the Davidson
Gentleman is high and | can
see his true self emerge on
these big weekends. He al-
ways seems to have a blast.
especially travelling here and
there without “here” know-
ing he’s going “there” and
vice-versa,

He is quite friendly, and to
a girl Davidson College would
be “the place.” I like the Da-
vidson Gentleman as do so
many of the Sullins girls who
have been lucky enough to date
him and luckier still to keep
him around.

Salem

My opinion, I’ve heard, you de-
sire.

About Davidson gentleman you
inquire.

Why you have chosen me from
all the rest,

I'll never know, but here’s my
best:

-Webster says gentlemen are -

high-born, well-bred;

And in my opinion, this is very
well-said.

Under this definition not all
can be placed;

In a group so large, some must
be erased.

To this small minority we'll no
give heed, :

But only to those who are

Fe

where they could find a hall.
Still not officially recognized
by the college. There was much
surreptitious dancing to Vic-
trolas in the fraternity halls.”
1938: The Faculty Minutes:
“Faculty ruled that square
dancing was not dancing but a
‘folk game,’ so might be_ in-
dulged in on the campus.
Recommendation to trustees:
‘The word dancing as used in

Rule four shall be interpreted ~~

to mean round dancing as com-
monly practiced in modern so-
cial functions, and does not in-
clude group games or folk
dancing as defined under the
general heading, folk danc-
ing.’ o

1938: The. Trustees’ Reply:
“The General Assembly ‘has
from time to time made de-
liverances calling upon its
members to refrain from danc-
ing ... We feel sure that the
students of the College gvould
not want the Trustees to take
an action which would be out
of harmony with the deliver-
ance of the highest court of
our church.

“Recognizing the supreme
authority. of the voice which
speaks, ‘Come ye out from
among them and be ye sepa-
rate. Touch not the unclean
thing’ we call upon our stu-
dents to face squarely the is-
sues presented by (dancing), in-
vestigate its true character,

“gentlemen” indeed.

A Davidson “gentleman” does
it up right:

He acquires two dates for the
very same night.

He picks you up at half-past
cight—

That's fine, but seven-thitty
was the hour-for your date.

Transportation with twelve
others in a borrowed car?

As you know, “togetherness”
can be carried too far.

Mountain Springs is our desti-
nation, of course,

And there we watch the boys
drink with much remorse.
Return to Salem—quite regret-

table;
A week's restriction—however,
inevitable.

All joking aside: I agree with
the rest——

Davidsonians are surely among
the best!

What’s he like?
A gentleman in the true
sense of the word: kind, cour-'

teous, thoughtful, generous,
‘capable — unless we get ob-
noxious about the whole
thing. ©

He is a thinking man—with-
out the filter.
The Davidson Gentleman is
an individual.’When a girl is
dating someone from D.C. she
feels that it is a distinction,
for he embodies all character-
istics of a good date and few
of those which would deem
him, shall we say, less desira-
ble?

The Davidson Coltegs Gent,
along with his campus, has

IGSOR:
measure its power to... dead-
en spiritual life, and arrive at
character - making decisions

which shall control personal at-
titude.”

1943: Faculty, after hearing
many student petitions read,
recommends that dancing be
legalized at Davidson, because:
“Dancing has become a recog:
nized mode of social expression
. and’ t he Presbyterian
Church, so far as our commit-
tees know or have been able to
ascertain, does not officially
condemn dancing .. .”

A modest but heartening
note ends the recommendation:
“The YMCA Cabinet has voted
unanimously its approval of
this recommendation.”

February, 1945— First logal
dance in 109 years of college
history is held on the Davidson
campus: “This dance was ad-
vertised as the Farewell
Frolics, for some now-forgotten
reason ... The orchestra was
that of Ernest Hinkle, from
Charlotte. On Friday night, the
students dressed informally and
danced to the music of an au-
tomatic record machine, more
commonly called a “juke box.”
Among those songs which were
most in demand by the dancers
were the following: MORE AND
MORE, I'M BEGINNING TO
SEE THE LIGHT, and RUM
AND COCA-COLA.”

@ certain intangible air, @
magnetic something which
says, “Why settle for less
than the best?’

He has a certain handshake,
a manner of walking, of talk-
ing, a special way of saying,
“I'd love to have you down for
Homecoming.”

What more can you say about

him? He’s a gentleman and he’s
from Davidson, isn’t he?

Converse

We at Converse may be
stereotyped as ‘status seek-
ers,” but our focal point of ap-
peal for the Davidson man is
the recognizable traits in him
that distinguish him as a “gen-
tleman.”

We refer, tongue in cheek,
to our appellation “Converse

ladies,” but in truth this con-
cept has a significance for
us and sets a standard for
ourselves and likewise a
criteria by which. we judge
the men we date. These quali-
ties which we seek are found
in, the Davidson “gentleman.”

As our space is limited, we
are -unable to elaborate fully
‘on the exceptional qualities of
the Davidson “gentleman.”
However, this is not such a mis-
fortune, as you undoubtedly are
as well aware of your finer
points as we are.

Betty Lake

Hollins

T have taken a brief survey

. among the Hollins students con-

cerning the question at hand;
however. I do not feel that
I can give an accurate, yet per-
sonal, account of the “Davidson

Gentleman” until I have visited’

your campus and actually. have
made the acquaintance of more
than just. a few of its repre-
sentatives.

It is so hard to accumulate
data on such a short notice:
however, I would be more than
happy to comply with your re-
quest at a later date.

Cynthia Simmons

Queens

As a Queens young lady, I’m
curious

About you Davidson gents’ in-
tent:

Why do you seek my opinion

And ask me my feelings to
vent?

Now some of you fellows are
fine with me,

But some I don’t like at all.

Like the Queens ladies, you
vary a bit:

You are fat; you are short;
you are tall. ;

To select a D.G. of my choice,

I'd choose an amiable fellow,

But in the bargain I’d surely
get

A dreadful black umbrella.

Your plea was sent in suck
earnest haste

By airmail ‘cross twenty
miles—

Have you suddenly found your
tactics unfound?

For us, are you changing your
style?

fn these four years I’ve never
heard

Of Davidson Gentlemen who
sought

Opinions from GIRLS of the
Davidson man;

They knew without asking (they
thought.).

Do your egos need boosting?
Is there a crack

In that smooth veneer of as-
surance?

T doubt it. You're starting an-
other war ‘
Of the sexes—to prove YOUR

endurance.
Ann Carmichael

U. of N.C.

Back in the woods, away from
it all,

Davidson gents stand proud and
tall;

Their pride stems from a tra-
dition old

Of scholarship, honor and cour-
age bold.

A heritage he protects and de-
fends

So the glory of Davidson never
ends.

The Davidson Gent stands out
in a crowd,.

But not because he’s flashy and
loud;

Rather because he has qualities
Yrare

With which few others can
compare.

He's certainly all that any girl
could want:

Scholar, athlete, and “bon
vivante.”

Now that you've read our little
verse

And know our poirt of view,

We hope that the “Go” bug
will get the best of you. .

And you will head to Chapel
Hill (It’s not too far away)

So we can show “the others”
the truth in what we say.

As we were diligently searching the Scriptures for
inspiration, a nightly practice which we’ve developed re-
cently, we came across a passage that was a little too

meaningful to be avoided.

A little research on the subject showed that the
passage is found in the Protestant Liturgical Year under

Halloween.

We'd like to point out some glaring parallels to
demonstrate that even our founding fathers really found-
ed the dance weekend on high principles.

Guilt feelings tend to be reduced when one realizes
that his actions have a scriptural basis (no reference
to Lot intended). The application of high criticism to
this otherwise innocuous passage brings out its modern

meaning for all of us:

A man appears, so possessed by nasty evil spirits
that no man can subdue him. When asked his name, he
replies that his name is called Legion, because he is

not one but many (but not

to exceed one thousand).

With the aid of a masterful stroke of psychology,
the evil spirits are cast out of the man into neighbor-

ing herds of swine.

The swine, now similarly possessed, join in a great

stampede and converge on

the scene, make a frenzied

ascent to the heights of Belk, and fall off the roof.
