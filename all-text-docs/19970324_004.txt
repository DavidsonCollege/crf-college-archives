IIMCR is based in Washing-
ton, D. C., and according to its pro-
motional literature, is “dedicated to
providing mediation skills to anew
generation of world leaders and
college students through the provi-
sion of seminars and symposiums
that teach the new science of con-
flict resolution.”

Some projects in which IMCR
officials have recently been in-
volved include briefing Israeli and
Palestinean media-
tors during the Oslo
talks and establish-
ing communica-
tion between U. S.
President Bill
Clinton and Syrian
President Hafez al-
Assad.

The symposium
lasts four weeks

tional Relations, who teach Dutch
diplomats.

International women’s issues addressed by Williams

By JENNIFER STARR

“Advancing the status of
women is directly related to US’s
goals... Itis the right thing to do and
itis the smart thing to do,”-says Bisa
Williams, special assistant to Secre-

Albright.
“Williams spoke on International

Women’s Issues on March 18. In
her lecture, Williams described in-
ternational women’s issues as sa-
lient to US goals and an active com-

ponent of US foreign policy.
Williams asserted that advanc-
ing the status of women around the
globe can lead to peace, democ-
racy, an improved world economy
with more jobs and the spread of US
values. She explained that it would
be difficult to have “true democ-

racy without the full participation
of women.”

She offered examples of
women’s groups working for peace
in Bosnia and Burundi as evidence

. of the positive differences which

women can make.

Williams also described how
the inclusion of women is vitally
important to modernization and
world economic growth. She ex-
plained that women traditionally do
much of the buying and selling in
many countries but still make-up
most of the abjectly poor.

She quoted a Turkish leader’s
words, ““‘It is difficult to modernize
with only half a population’” to
illustrate that the inclusion of
women is important for practical as

well as ethical rea-
sons. Williams sug-
gested that educating
women, providing
them with health care,
and giving them “a
fair chance at the lev-
els of political and
economic power’ can
help break cycles of
poverty and over-
population.
According to
Williams, the US
government’s efforts
on behalf of women
includes reporting
honestly on human
rights, backing the

which are persecuting those who
use rape as a weapon of war and
cracking down on those who traffic
in women.

However, during the question
session she admitted that the US
government’s response to foreign
governments’ actions which deny
the equality of women (such as the
recent actions by the Taliaban in
Afghanistan) is usually limited to
persuasion, constructive engage-
ment, and the withdrawal of fund-
ing.

In the question period, Will-
iams also addressed the role of cul-
ture and religion in international
women’s issues. According to Wil-
liams, religion is not often as large
a barrier to women’s rights as many
people assume. For example, she
said that no government or reli-
gious leaders required female geni-
tal mutilation.

Williams also sees culture as
constantly evolving and capable of
accommodating new roles for
women. “Culture is as people de-
cide to make it. We believe in
democracy which gives women a
voice [to change culture],”’ she says.

Williams has gained first hand
knowledge of international
women’s issues throughout her ca-
reer. After graduating from Yale
and UCLA and teaching English at
Rice, Williams entered the foreign
service. She has been stationed in
places as far flung as West Africa,
Panama, and Washington, DC

She joined Albright’s staff at
the UN and moved with Albright to
the State Department. While at the
UN, Williams participated in the
Chicago Women’s Conference, the
Beijing Conference and the Cairo
Conference on Population Control,
and the Habitat Conference.
