Media Awareness: How To See Show

By VINCE RABIL
Contributing Editor

The Fourth Davidson
National Print and Drawing
Competition opened last Sunday
amidst gala festivities and
much social fanfare. It will be
on exhibit until April 18 in the

Cunningham Fine Arts
Building.
One hundred sixty-one works

were selected by Judith Gold-
man, managing editor of ‘‘Art
News’”’ from among 2476 entries
from 50 states and Puerto Rico.

Nearly one third of the works
are drawings, and according to
the show’s director, Herb
Jackson, this show ‘‘might be
thought of as the year drawings
become a major issue for the
juror.”’

Thirty-two states and. the
District of Columbia are

represented in the show, but
nearly one third of the selec-
tions were from New York and
California based artists.

This may be due to the high
quality of the entries, which
Jackson states ‘‘was the highest
in the history of this project.’’

$3250 in awards

A total of $3250 in awards
were provided by the show’s
sponsors and awarded by the
juror. A large number of works
were sold at the openning, but
the picking is still good.

Although the show’s juror was
unable to attend the opening,
one could see there many of the
featured artists munching on
strawberries and sipping wine.

It is my hope that many of you
who ‘‘made this scene’’ will be
able to return to the show again
and really ‘‘see’’ it. After all,

this show is about seeing in its
highest sense: total visual per-
ception.

In order to fully perceive each
work one must open his senses
to an awareness of media (pen-
cil, mixed inks, intaglio
processes; relief, serigraph,
color use, etc.), and try to per-
ceive ‘‘where” the artist is
“coming from.”’

You must determine if a work
is about its images or the
properties of its medium
primarily.

Media important

As a viewer you cannot really
“‘see’’ a piece unless you are
able to determine whether the
artist is exploiting the proper-
ties of his medium to create an
illusion, or whether the artist
exploits the textures, tones, and
structures of an image to ex-
plore the properties, uses, and
qualities of certain media.

In short, is the message in the
use of the medium, or is the
medium secondary to the com-
munication of a message?

Seeing vs. looking

I must admit that I left the
show after an initial overall

‘ “look-at’” somewhat depressed.

1 felt these selections were sen-

_timental, conservative, and

gin terms of

backward-loeking
the modern tradition.

These reactions resulted from
looking and not seeing: a
mistake made by many who
will view the show looking for
political, religious, literary,
metaphysical or mythical com-
mentary.

The works selected by Judith
Goldman for this show were
created for their own reason
d’etre. And these, for the most
part, are about purely sensual,
visual experiences.

In order for most David-
sonians to ‘‘see”’ this show, they
will have to leave their
academic robes at the door and
remove the jargon colored
glasses from their eyes.

Within the criteria set by
Goldman are coherent use of
imagery, consistent stylistic
treatment, mastery of
technique, and a primary con-
cern for for visual and materia:
issues,

Another Saturday Night
Dare Francis. the creator of this skeletal drawing. was
the second Davidson College student ever to have his
work displayed in the Davidson National.

There can be found, never-

theless, many styles and a
broad range in the use of and
experimentation with diverse
media.

Imagery secondary

Despite what I have said
about visual experience, it still
may seem strange that in a
show with so much realism and
representation there is not
more literary communication.
Perhaps this can be explained
by the use of imagery by these
artists as secondary to their
primary concern with “how”
the image is communicated:
their media. ig

For the most part these work
are extremely medium con-
scious, and thus the artists
use their images as: structural

ee

frameworks for exploring what
visually can be done with pen-
cil, charcoal, serigraph,
lithograph, intaglio, woodcut,
etc.

This concern for media is
very ‘‘Twentieth Century”, and
so my initial reaction that the
show is “backward-looking”’
has changed upon “‘seeing’’ the
issues being dealt with here.

Compromise

In a sense many of these ar-
tists are making it easy on the
viewer by exploring their media
on representational format.
Perhaps it is a good com-
promise between the natural
desires and needs of the viewing
audience and the intellectual
concerns of the artist with the
properties of his media.

Of course what I have said
here is awkwardly general and
based on overall characteristics
of the show. You will find upon
“seeing” the show several ex-
ceptions: literary, political, and
comical,

Please do not allow the easy
perception of these works deny
you the experience of ‘‘seeing”’
the more visually — involving
works, Certainly do not deceive
yourself with the belief that you
have ‘‘seen”’ this show after one
quick look.
