such am extent that it is extremely
difficult for his soul to be rescued.

The Prince of this world has now
become firmly entrenched and has
captured ‘the souls of many power-

WHY... I smoke Chesterfield

( FROM A SERIES OF STATEMENTS BY PROMINENT TOBACCO FARMERS )

“I think Chesterfield is the best cigarette on the market.
Ive smoked them for about 20 years. It’s mild and it’s
got more real tobacco taste.

“Liggett & Myers buy the middle leaves...it’s the best
leaf... it’s mellow... it’s got to be ripe. They consistently
pay above the average to get the tobacco they want.’’
