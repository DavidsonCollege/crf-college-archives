The Davidsonian

Fifteen

To the Editor:

Recently, the Davidson College
Cheerleaders had tryouts and the win-
ners were on the order of six guys and
five girls. The magic numbers of six and
five were decided on after seemingly
hours of discussion or rather argumen-
ts. This brings me to the point of my let-
ter.

At the first meeting after selection of
next year’s squad, it was brought up
that two of next year’s squad were
inadequate or incapable of being ‘‘good’’
cheerleaders because they could not do
the “‘lifts.’’

Because of such inability, it was
recommended that the squad add an ex-
tra member--the guy who finished
seventh.

The suggestion was considered by the
new squad and after aproximately an
hour of practice, during which the two
incapable cheerleaders were’ asked to
work with every girl on next year’s
squad, the new guy was voted in.

This is not enough time to do all “‘lifts”’
for it takes more than an hour to do any
sort of cheer even a ‘“‘lift.’’

Such an act is in violation of what was
originally: told the guys and girls and
even the judges before tryouts. Had the
judges known that if the guys that
weighed the least made it they would
have to add another guy. they might
have voted differently.

Cheerleading is just _ that--
cheerleading. If we want cheerleading
to be just a weight-lifting sport why not,
have a squad of football players.

Getting the crowd involved is the pur-
pose behind being a cheerleader. Par-
ticipation dwindles when all the crowd
can do is watch and wonder if the girl is
going to be dropped.

Many men and women have gained
many honors doing things that they
were, at first. unfit to do.

Moreover. I think that doing a lift is
more of a combined effort in that if the
girl gives just a little the lift can be done
by the “‘incapables”. However. some of
next vear’s girls will not give as much to
the incapables as to the capables
because thev have already told them-
selves that these guvs cannot do the ‘“‘lif-
ts:”” ‘

Finally, it is known that the seventh
guy will miss some of the home games.
To me, it shows nonchalance and makes
the team you are cheering for not as
worthwhile aS your previous com-
mittment.

To “slap someone in the face”
requires a reason and if your only reason

is that he weighs 140 instead of 170. is it
right or even fair? |

To the Editor:

In response to Mr. Beasley’s letter in
the April 17. 1975 issue of the David-
sonian, I would like to say just one
thing:

“Bill, vou took the bait like I had
hoped someone would. and I hope you
run with it and make others like yourself
proud to be a member of the Eumenean
Society of Davidson College. Thanks,
Gus.”

TITERS

Cheerleader tryouts become uplifting

To the Editor:

Mr. Steve Peck has earned accolades
of the highest order for putting together
the 4-day symposium, “‘Latin America
1975: Problems and Perspectives,” that
was held in the College Union last week.

I saw three of the films that he
secured, and all were excellent.

I attended three of the lectures, and
the remarkable thing, to me, was that
Mr. Peck manages to secure speakers
who represented a wide area on the
political spectrum, ranging from liberal-
-almost radical--through liberal to con-
servative, the latter coming close to
falling into the reactionary areas on the .
spectrum.

One of the speakers, Mr. Jose Yglesia,
is quite well- and widely-known asa
writer on Latin American Affairs.

It seemed a shame that the films and
the lectures were somewhat less than
sparsely attended.

Prep jocks dominate intramural sports

To the Editor:
“‘Pencey Prep is this school that’s in
Agerstown, Pennsylvania. \ You

probably heard of it.’’ If you ever went
to high school you must have heard of it.
or else you had to have been a moron.

But I didn’t write this letter to talk
about the little red book of the/high
school set. but about ‘Prencey Prep.
which happens to be the name of my
IMAC team.

Yeah, I know. you probably never
heard of this one. but that’s your tough
luck. I’ll tell you everything you need to —
know, and then I don’t care if you never
hear of us again.

The guys that play for Prencey Prep
have played about every IMAC sport un-

der various and sundry IMAC-type

names for as long as they have been at
Davidson.

We’ve always just coasted along,’
playing for the hell of it, laughing at all
the IMAC professionals, joking with the
incompetent refs, dropping passes and
striking out, and loving it all the time. Of
course, we’ve never won anything much.
(winning can be hazardous to your en-
joyment of sports). and we certainly
have no reason to cry sour grapes,
because we never really expect to win.

But we do expect a little respect from
IMAC organizers so that we can enjoy
our exploits as much as the winners do
theirs, and that respect has been rather
blatantly lacking for some time now.
We’ve had about enough, I think.

To explain: For two basketball
seasons, we played B-league under the
names ‘Carolina Bombers” and ‘‘Em-
bo’? and found oursleves scheduled in
the late-night time slot (11:00 or 11:30)

.. Soldiers

(Continued from page 9)

such ‘a commentary: both have served a
tour of duty as instructors at USMA.
Ellis, a graduate of William and Mary,
and Moore, Davidson ’62, were both
commissioned as officers through the.
Reserve Officers Training Corps.

In writing they have not relied solely
upon personal opinion, but have in-
cluded many interviews with USMA
alurrni, cadets, and officials. Their
blend of objective facts and subjective
opinions contribute to make “School for
Soldiers” a very readable and intriguing
book.

As the authors say in their preface,
much of what they say will not sit well
with West Pointer. but the general’
reader is reminded that no resistance
was offered by the Academy to their ef-
forts.

~

In presenting their views “School for
Soldiers” by all means deserves your at-
tention and careful consideration if you
desire a new perspective on the West
Point graduate.

LETTERS

The Davidsonian solicits let-
ters to the editor on any sub-
ject. All letters for publication

Letters received in The
Davidsonian offices by Sunday

for every game but two or three. For two
seasons, now.
Of course, none of us go to bed at any

decent hour, and we can shoot hoops at

midnight as well as at noon. But there
comes a time when you finally realize
that you’re playing late because you’re
B-league and nobody knows you and, ex-
cept for one swell track star, you don’t
have a single big-time jock on your
roster, and mainly because none of the
“good” teams want to play in the middle
of the night. ;

It’s kind of hard to just overlook an in-
sult of that variety, but we never said

- anything because we were still having.

fun.

And then came softball. Five of our
first seven games were played amidst
the towering southern pines of IMAC’s
most interesting playground, Field Two.

For the uninitiated, Field Two is a
flickerball field which doubles as half of
a softball field. We don’t really mind
chasing softballs through the woods, and
we’ve picked up our share of cheap-shot
singles to right. so we still, had no big
complaints.

At least not until we found out that

everybody’s favorites, those won-
derful I Felta Thi’s, had played every
single game on either the practice foot-
ball field or the lower soccer field,
where guys like the Thi’s, with big, bad
bats, can hit freely to all fields.

Obviously the leading teams want to
be able to hit, and they probably don’t
dig chasing pine-tree fouls, but why
should they enjoy the luxuries at our
expense?

here have been other minor insults
from the IMAC people: just the other
day we had softball and volleyball
games scheduled for the same time slot:
and then we always come to find our
scores and records incorrectly recorded
(if we ever win one, they still record
losses).

I hope you can partially see the point
I’m trying to make. We aren’t going to
quit playing IMAC, and we're not going
to complain everytime something hap-

tous.

But the idea that IMAC caters to the
stars at the of the amateurs is
upsetting to say the least, and I think it’s
time to start doing something about it.
Besides, it would be good for some of the
hotshots around here to be reminded
the IMAC sports can be pretty much fun
if you get down and play like the peons.
just for the hell of it.

Here’s a hearty Embo for Dunn and
Dunean. who will now have to admit
seeing the name of our B-league teams
in print for the first time.

In the Thrill of defeat, .....+++
