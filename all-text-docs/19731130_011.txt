SAE Grabs IMAC Flickerball Crown

By CAPTAIN And ERICA

i

Well welcome back fools.
We understand that everyone
is back on campus after a
short Turkey-day vacation,
except for C-IV_ whose
brother’s and sisters were un-
mercifully slaughtered and
eaten over the week. Well
everybody has their bad
breaks. A tough one indeed.

Seeing as how there was no
paper the week before the
holidays, C.A. and YB, (who
has been freed from his slave-
like bondage) should recap the
flickerball tourney.

In the quarter finals, the
SPEs pulled off the upset of
the season as_ they defeated

as he is 25 years old. He has a
good outside shot.

Peter Walsh is only 19 years
old and is the youngest big
man on team. But his 7-0
frame will probably permit
him to see action against some
smaller Cats. One of his
problems is covering the quick
man.

Bill Palmer is the other

Emanon by about 7 or 8 points

Keith Stanzel and QB Bil Bill
Higgins led the determined
SPE offense while Bob Hor-
ton’s rushing contained the
scrambling Calvin Allen.

The N. Main Gozinyas cap-
ped off a good season as they
canned the KA's in the tourney
as once again they proved that
alcohol can be used as an in-
tramural stimulant.
Congratulations to ‘‘Drix’’
Hendrix who performed well
in the “redeye’’ slot for the
Gozinyas. Other quarter final
action saw the SAE s behead a
stubborn C-I freshman team.
C-I had a fine season,
especially for freshmen just
learning how to play.

And rounding out the action
the darkhorse Cleveland In-

dians crushed PGD to gain a
semi-berth behind Mark
Rodgeman. Bobby Evans and
Juan Sachez led the way.

The semi finals saw the
Tribe take the SPE's 49-34
despite a valient SPE
comeback and the Indians
superior athletic ability over-
came the SPEs regiment.
The other bracket found the
SAE now on their way toa title
as theysobered upthe drunken
Gozinyas in a massacre.
Peyton Prospere’s throwing
and Eldon Bosham’s defense
was just too much for the
Alkies.

In the final the Indians were
simply outmanned by SAE,
specifically Peyton Prospere.
He led the E’s to a 61-39
wipeout of the Tribe, as SAE

Cats Tangle Here

Aussie that may see extensive
action in the front court. Being
6-7 he has good height and ex-
perience on the court. He has
been playing very well recen-
tly since coming off an injury.

The Kangaroos will be a
true test for the Cats on
Friday night. The amount of
improvement that has been
expected on the Davidson
squad will be put in the
limelight.

of many steps that will be
taken by the administration to
improve our physical plant
facilities in the area of
athletics,” Winston pointed
out. ‘We will do this, of cour-
se, without taking away from
the financial resources for the
academic environment at

The drainage system in-
cludes the installation of 1400
feet of curbing around the
perimeter of the track. There
are also catch drains which
are six feet wide being spaced
100 feet apart around the inner
area of the track.

The job should be completed
within three weeks, if the
weather permits, Winston
acknowledged.

“If the ground freezes,”
Winston said, ‘‘we will have to
wait.”

The final phase of placing
the rubberized surface on the
top of the track will start as
soon as the first phase is com-
pléted, if the weather permits.
If not, it will be done in the

spring.

The actual surface will take
only one day to put in place
and the track can be painted
and ready to run on within a
week once the surface can be
laid down, according to Win-
ston.

Winston termed the project
as a “positive move since we
had been trying to raise the
money for such a track for the

In comparison with the
costs of other new style tracks
within the Southern Con-
ference, the college can be
pleased with getting a fine
track for a reasonable price.
The new track at William and

cost an estimated
$150,000 while the new nine-
lane tartan track being built
by Richmond will cost the
Spiders. close to $250,000. .

It is hoped that the track will
be ready for the 1974 track
season, barring any unforseen
difficulties.

Winston added __ that
donations are still being
sought to help finish the fund
drive to cover the costs of this
new and néeded facility for
the athletic program at David-
son.

Holland will be able to see
where his weaknesses and
strong points are prior to the
official opening of the 1973-74
basketball season.

One big factor may be the
age difference between the
two clubs. Despite the fact
that the Cats are returning
most of last year’s team and
will be heavy laden with ex-
perienced players, the Aussies
will have an average age of
almost 23 years per man. This
could be a factor in the out-
come of the contest.

The big man has been the
Cats primary concern in the
past. Gaze’s men will be out to
attack that weakness if it still
exists.

At any rate, the 8 p.m.
tip-off will be the beginning of
this year’s basketball season.
The fate of the coming cam-
paign may have some descrip-
tion after the game.

ees best pnoere yon team of
1973.

The three-on-three tour-
nament was also completed
last week. There were
teams entered featuring some
fabulous names, a few coed
teams, and some fine basket-
ball. C.A. & Y.B.’s favorite
name was Montezuma’s
Revenge, closely followed by
the Dick Smith Phekirz.

After the field was narrowed
down to four teams, a surprise
freshman squad of Corey

Young, Geoff Ely, Will
McLean and Jim Dulin
defeated the SPE’s in a barn-
burner. At the other end of the
gym Duncan, Rodgeman,
Evans and Flanagan manhan-
dled the Hurwood Derbies.

The final wasn’t very close
as Duncan, Rodgeman,
Flanagan and Evans had to
much talent and experience
for the hustling frosh. The
final was 21-12 as Pat
Flanagan sunk three in a row
from somewhere in downtown
Detroit to win it.
