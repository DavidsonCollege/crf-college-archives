Text of the Report of the Faculty Committee on Intercollegiate Athletics

Introduction

Last spring the faculty charged us to
report on (1) the costs of Davidson’s inter-
collegiate athletics program, (2) whether
Davidson should continue intercollegiate
football and (3) whether Davidson should
continue competing in Division I. Our
report focuses on financial and academic
costs, broken down into football, basket-
ball, other men's sports and women’s
sports. We begin by describing our current
situation. We then examine five options
before making recommendations.

The Current Situation

In 1987-88 the College spent $1.84
million on Division | intercollegiate athlet-
ics, of which 76% went to football and
basketball. Per player we spent $13,200 in
football, $38,700 in basketball and $2,100
in other sports. Football players also re-
ceived a higher-than-average amount of
need-based grant from the College: al-
though they comprised 5% of the student
body, they received $269,000 in College
grants, or 14% of the total need-based
grants. The 1988-89 budget totals $1.86
million for intercollegiate athletics, of
which 79% will go to football and basket-
ball. College need-based grants to football

players increased to $415,000, or 18% of
the total need-based grants. This year the
average football player received a total
need-based aid package amounting to 63%
of tuition, room and board; the average
non-football player, 16%.

We also pay high academic costs for
football and basketball. Although our Divi-
sion I programs attract the occasional bril-
liant athlete, average SAT scores for in-
coming football players fall more than 100
points below the college average, while
incoming basketball players’ scores fall
more than 200 points below average. These
low averages result largely from College
policy for committee cases, especially in
football. [Footnote: Our admissions com-
miltee ranks applicants on a 1-10 scale.
Normally admitted students receive rat-
ings 7-10; wait-listed students usually re-
ceive ratings 6-7. The number of recruited
football admissions has varied froma high
of 40 (three years ago) to this year's more
traditional number of 30. We usually allo-
cate these recruited admissions evenly so
that we admit one third who meet the nor-
mal admission standards as well as one
third in the ‘‘wait list'’ range; the entire
faculty committee scrutinizes the one third
who fall below a rating of 6.1n practice, the
faculty committee creates a pool of admis-

sible football men in the under-6 range and
the football coaching staff designates
which ones will be offered admission. Be-
cause the faculty committee turns down
some of football's most desirable recruits,
the football staff feels the faculty controls
the process. The faculty, however, do nct
feel they control the process because they
do not set the number of committee cases to
be admitted. Basketball recruits up to its
scholarship limit (15 players across the
four years), with no fixed number in the
committee-consideration range. All other
sports are limited to one committee case
per year, and those are not always used.}
Performance at Davidson matches these
low incoming standards. The average class
rank at graduation for football players is the
31st percentile; for basketball players the
33rd percentile; for other male athletes the
39th percentile. Female athletes exceed the
college average, having an average rank at
graduation in the 54th percentile.

Several other disturbing points deserve _

mention. In the past 11 years, football play-
ers have committed 27% of the honor code
violations despite comprising only about
5% of the student: body. [Footnote: Ac-
cording to data supplied by Dean Terry,
students committed 84 violations between
fall 1977 and spring 1988. Athletes com-

mitted violations as follows: baseball 7,
basketball 5, football 23 and soccer 3.)
Football and basketball players withdraw
from Davidson at significantly higher rates
than other athletes. Of committee case
football recruits since 1983, nearly one in
four has dropped out of school.

On 22 March 1988, over President Re-
agan’s veto, Congress passed the Civil
Rights Restoration Act, which requires in-
stitutions receiving federal aid to spend
equitably for men’s and women’s pro-
grams. In the past six months litigants have
filed 16 complaints against 12 institutions
(Chronicle of Higher Education 2 Novem-
ber 1988). Our current 9.4/1 ratio of expen-
diwres for men’s/women’s sports, there-
fore, exposes us to a possible lawsuit unless
we institute a plan to come into compliance
within (probably) three years. This threat,
we hope, will compel us to do what we
ought to do anyway: Treat all students
fairly.

College legal counsel has not yet com-
pletely analyzed Title IX’s impact. Some
leeway exists. For instance, dollar amounts
spent per player for equipment costs need
not be equivalent since some sports require
more expensive equipment. In our opinion,
however,. these adjustments will not
change our problem significantly. The
minimum defensible ratio is

sports remains the same, we must add
$1.26 million annually to women’s budg-
ets to reach the 54/46 ratio, and $540,000 to
reach even the minimum 70/30 ratio. The
$340,000 for the new athletic complex
must be added to these figures, for totals of
$1.6 million and $880,000 required to
achieve the respective 54/46 and 70/30
ratios. Advantages include:

Maintaining the Division I sports pro-
gram that has made us distinctive among
liberal arts colleges ‘most selective’’ and
“‘highly selective+’’ in admissions.

Continued media coverage for our ath-

letic teams at the present rate.
Disadvantages include:
- Difficulty in finding even $880,000. to
add to the athletics budget. [Footnote: In
1987-88 the Wildcat Club raised $245,000
of the $272,000 it pledged.]

Uncertainty of long-term prospects for
success in Division I given our small and,
for men, decreasing size. Adding athletic
scholarships to football and/or other men’s
sports would multiply our difficulties re-
garding Title IX.

Option #2. Play Division III football and
leave other sports in Division I.

We would save about $480,000; we
would need to add $840,000 to women’s
sports to reach the 54/46 ratio, and
$340,000 to reach even the70/30 ratio. The
$340,000 for the new. athletic complex
must be added to these figures. Taking into
account the $480,000 savings, an extra
$700,000 and $190,000 would still be
needed to achieve the respective 54/46 and
70/30 ratios [Footnote: Discrepancies in
several computations result from correct-
ing for rounding errors.) Advantages i in-
clude:

- Continuing to provide an educational
experience in football, at a level appropri-
ate to an institution of our size and aca-
demic standards, ’

Disadvantages include:

- Difficulty in finding even $190,000 to
add to the athletics budget. We would not
be able to afford swimming teams, and
would probably have to reallocate money
from basketball to womén’s sports as well
to achieve equity. ;

Difficulty in scheduling, football, fire

- Possibility that the NCAA’ will hile out
» this option by creating a level of “AAA $0
that true Division III schools will not have
to compete in foothall against schools that
play Division I in other sports.

+ Uncertainty of prospects for football
success in Division Ill, since We would not
attract our current caliber of athlete.

Option #3. Play all sports in Division III.
We would save at least $750,000 (fur-
ther savings would come from basketball).
We would.need to add $620,000. to
women’s sports to reach the 54/46 ratio and
$220,000 to reach the 70/30 ratio. The
$340,000 for the new athletic complex
must be added to these figures. Taking into
account the $750,000 savings, an extra
$200,000 would be needed to achieve the
(54/46 ratio, while the 70/30 ratio would be
‘met with $190,000 to spare. Advantages
include:
: Competing at a level appropriate to. an
institution of our size.and academic stan-
dards.
- Achieving at least a 60/40 ratio in
men’s/women’s expenditures and paying
for the new athletic complex without in-
creasing the athletics budget.
