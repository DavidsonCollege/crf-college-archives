The Era of Neo-Apartheid?

Four days before I left Char-
lotte on a four-week study tour of
South Africa, parliament passed a
law abolishing the last pillar of
apartheid. It overthrew the
“Peoples Registration Act,” which
required all citizens to be regis-
tered at birth according to race.

The outside world hailed the
collapse of apartheid and the United
States lifted economic sanctions.
South Africa became once again a
citizen in good standing among
governments of the world.

However, during my four
wecks of observing the legal sys-
tem in Johannesburg and my trav-
els across the country, I realized
the South African government has
managed to pull the proverbial
wool over the eyes of an entire
planet. Ironically, the South Afri-
can government removed apart-
heid to continue its antagonistic
role in the struggle for black eman-
cipation and enfranchisement. In
day-to-day life, nothing has
changed for black South Africans.
Poverty, illiteracy, malnutrition,

homelessness and white economic
dominance will continue to

Freedom Party, another black po-

and liberation groups. Nelson Man-
dela, the newly elected Presi-

remain solidly in place.

In striking apartheid, the
South African government mini-
mized its losses as the system
reached a point of diminishing
returns. Sanctions, multi-lateral
pressure from black liberation
groups, and divisiveness in Presi-
dent de Klerk's Nationalist Party
conspired to end apartheid.
Failing to discontinue the sys-
tem would have produced one
of two scenarios for the South
African government: a slow and
painful death that included un-
ending international economic
sanctions or a quick coup. The
repeal, however, has given the
government license to call for
negotiations. These negotiations
are heinous because freedom is
non-negotiable.

To further weaken the black

dent of the ANC, has spoken
of such abuses for years.
There are also allegations that
the South African Defense
Forces (SADF) have been
used to intimidate political
organizations and leaders by
killing off their constitucn-
cies. Is the international com-
munity unaware of these
abuses, or does the interna-
tional community not care?
When President
de Klerk ‘struck apartheid
from the laws of the land,
only the skin of the system
was removed. The flesh and
bones of apartheid remain be-
cause the government denies
blacks voting rights and mini-
mizes their economic power.
Given that these are still the
realities of South Africa, what

freedom.movement, the govern-
ment allocated about two million
dollars for anti-African National
Congress activities by the Inkatha

litical party. This appears to have
been an effort not only to weaken
ANC support but also to create di-
visiveness amongst black leaders

has changed for its black citizens?

Black South Africans lamented
the removal of United States sanc-
tions, because sanctions gave them

leverage in fighting for their po-
litical and economic rights. By
lifting sanctions before voting
rights were bestowed on all citi-
zens, the United States and other
nations have legitimized an ille-
gitimate government.

There is no doubt that black
citizens will eventually be South
Africa’s majority voters. One
hopcs that a new South Africa will
not include oppression of whites.
However, black oppression iscer-
tain without black voting rights,
fair and equitable redistribution
of land, and equal educational op-
portunities. The good news is that
itis not too late to re-impose sanc-
tions.

In recent years controversy has arisen concerning the issue of

rush in the first few weeks.of school. This year, once again,

complaints are being heard. In response to this rumble of
discontent, The Davidsonian asked 5 randomly selected .

students to voice their opinions on this issue. The following
are their responses to the question:.

“Do you think limits should be imposed on
-rush activities in the first few weeks of school?”

Yes, they are new to their environ-_

ment; they need time to get used to

it; they’re scared. I’m a resident -

advisor, and I was on duty the first
day of school and I saw akind of a
rush party going on in Belk witha
commoncontainerofalcohol. This
kind of gives freshmen an acceler-
ated start; something they’re not
used to.

Girish Gyalani, ‘92

Yes. College is, in itself, a huge
transition from life in high school.
With it comes. great deal of work
and responsibility and freshmen
should have the opportunity to
experience it first without the in-
fluence of fraternities and the ac-
tivities that surround them.
Phiderika Foust, ‘94

Yes, because freshmen need to have
a chance to get to know one an-
other without upperclass and fra-
ternity involvement. Fraternities
have plenty of opportunities torush
later in the term.

e - Gregory Pence, PhD. oe

Yes. Students need some time to
become acquainted with Davidson
and to concentrate on their studies.
Rush activities ought to be post-
poned until students are familiar
with Davidson.
Christopher Edwards, ‘95

Yes. It’s hard enough adjusting to
Davidson without getting involved
in Rush right away.
