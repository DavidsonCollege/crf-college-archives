the Student Body Leaders En-
joyed by All—Band Fur-
nishes Good Music

Practically the whole student body
attended an informal reception given
by the Y. M. C. A. Monday evening
to welcome the Freshman class to
Davidson. The gymnasium, deco-
rated with D. C. banners, was well
filled and good fellowship prevailed
everywhere.

Almost all the faculty were pres-
ent with their wives and a number
of town people were there to greet
the new men. Light refreshments
were served, which were enjoyed by
all. The college band furnished ex-
cellent music, which did much to
add to the success of the occasion.

After an enjoyable half hour spent
in friendly greetings Lewis Schenck,
president of the Y. M. C. A., made
a brief address of welcome to the
Freshmen. He urged all to take an
active part in the “Y” this year.

After this speech Dr. G. M. McCon-
nell explained to the new men why
they were so welcome to Davidson
and what is expected of them here.

Coach Grey, our hard-working
football coach, then made a stirring
appeal to the students for their sup-
port of the football team. He said,
‘Davidson teams are beaten, but
never defeated.”

Captain Hammett, speaking for
the entire team, promises that they
will do their best in every game this
season, which is all we expect or de-
sire of them.

Buck Currie made an appeal for
a better Davidson, -which, as he says,
will take the best in every man.

Eris Cassell and Jap Cummings
promise interesting and valuable lit-
erary productions this year in the
form of The Davidsonian and Maga-
zine. They ask for the co-operation
of every man in their work.

Joe McCaskill spoke in behalf of
the literary societies and wants all
the Freshmen to consider the ques-
tion of membership seriously.

The speeches being completed, all
were urged to remain for an amus-
ing movie in the form of “Mary’s
Ankle.”

The Rev. E. D. Brown, trustee for
Concord Presbytery spent Wednes-
day on the ill. Among other
things he entered his son E. D. Jr.

~in the freshman class.

With Chapel Thurs-
day Morning

Dr. Martin Welcomes Old and New
Students, and Introduces
New Professors

The opening exercises of. the
1920-21 session were held in Shearer
Hall, at the chapel hour on Thurs-
day, the 9th of this month. At this
time Dr. Martin announced to the
students the fact that never before
in the history of the institution had
there been such a large enrollment,
for so early a date in registration.
Four hundred and twenty men had
deposited their shekels with the
treasurer and signed their:fate for
the collegiate year. The five hun-
dred mark is well in sight and the
goal of the Greater Davidson Club
almost realized.

Dr. Martin gave a short and
hearty welcome to the old men re-
turning, commending them for their
faithful work in the past and solicit-
ing their earnest efforts and co-
operation in the future. The new
men were cordially welcomed to Da-
vidson College and were offered the
co-operation of both the faculty and
student body in making the first
year of their college course one of
the most fruitful ones.

The new members of the faculty
were introduced by the president,
namely: Dr. Fraser Hood. holding
the chair of Psychology and Edu-
cation; Prof. Irwin, the second chair
of English; Prof. Byers, Spanish
and German; Captain Hearn, profes-
sor of Military Science and Tactics.
Dr. Martin then brought the stu-
dents’ attention to a number of
changes in the schedule and curricu-
lum for the year. Also making men-
tion of the improvements ‘in the
equipment of the college. After a
few other announcements of minor
importance the exercises were turn-
ed over to Captain Hearn, in the in-
terest of the R. O. T.C. °

Greatly Enlarged

Valuable Advanced Course Offered
This Year

The cqllege curriculum is wonder-
fully augmented by the addition of
the two practical advanced courses
of Education JI and Educational
Psychology II to be taught by Dr.
Fraser Hood, formerly of North-
western University, now Davidson’s
first C. E. Graham Professor of Edu-
cation. These courses form a neces-
sary part of the educational prepa-
ration not only for teachers, preach-
ers and others who expect to devote
their lives to work among young
people, but also for every man who
is to competently fill his place in
society as head of a family. For any
one who expects to deal with chil-
dren these courses offer exceptional
advantages to learn how the child
thinks and how his habits of
thought must be directed and de-
veloped through the proper proc-
esses of learning.

Dr. Byers’ prospective addition of
an advanced course in Spanish be-
sides being of great cultural value,
will prove a wonderful asset to the
necessary mental equipment of the
business man who expects to en-
gage in the great South American
trade.

COACH GREY WELCOMED
BACK TO THE CAMPUS

Great was the joy of the Davidson
students when they learned that
Hugh Grey was to be the coach of
football this year. Not only was
he one of the stars when he was in
college but since his graduation he
has been turning out winning teams
at Baily Military Institute. Coach
Grey became an alumnus of David-
son in the spring of 1918, having
been one of the best all-around ath-
letes ever at this institution. He
played on the football team for three

With Well-Attend-

ed Service
Dr. Arbuckle and Lewis Schenck
Sound Keynote for Year’s Work
. In Short Speeches

“Christian Service” was the key-
note of the speeches made at the Y.
M. C. A. service last Sunday night
by Lewis Schenck and Dr. Arbuckle.
After a short song service led ‘by
Buck Currie, Scheck, the president
of the College Association, made a
report for the Board of Control, ex-
plaining its failure to secure a gen-
eral secretary to fill the place made
vacant by the resignation of “Bob”
Miles last spring.

The students of Davidson should
turn this failure into a blessing, he
thinks by assuming more responsi-
bility as workers for the “Y” on the
campus. He then discussed the or-
ganization of the Y. M. C. A., show-
ing what would be expected of each
committee and how every man on
the campus may co-operate with
these committees in accomplishing
these aims. In closing his speech
Schenck called attention to the cards
‘placed on the seats and asked every-
one present to check the form of
Christian service in which he would
be most interested.

Dr. Arbuckle closed the service
with a few words on “Helpfulness.”
He pointed out that just a few who
had signed the cards could be used
this fall in these activities, but that

every man on the campus could en-|+*

gage in personal work by helping

and cheering his fellow students. He|«

said that he considered the highest
tribute which any man could have
paid to him was that he was always

elping others, and that he hoped
that it could be said of Davidson
men that they were found helping
others, for this is the only road to a
Better Davidson.

The meeting was well attended
and the audience was very respons-

Wildcats Begin Practice
on Sprunt Field a
eek Early
Hard Schedule “Demands Strenuous

Workout—Sizty Men Answered
Coach Gray’s First Call

Signals! 17-42-64 Hike! Snap, and
they’re off. The Wildcat gridiron
squad, increased to about 50 husk-
ies, representing in the neighbor-
hood of four tons of meat, and bone
combined, have been laboring out
under Old Sol’s rays on Sprunt field
for the past two weeks, Coach Grey
has the squad in hand, and is fast
whipping them into shape.

With one of the largest squads
for many a moon, Sprunt field re-
sembles an animated ant-hill. Pig--
skins soar back and forth, and Old
Man Dummy is getting what is
coming to him now, after nine
months of rest. The way the Red
and Black warriors hit him is a
shame, causing him to sweat bits of
sawdust at every lick.

Seven of last year’s Varsity are
back, and around this as a nucleus
Coach Grey is building this season’s
Red and Black machine. Hammet,
captain and star tackle, is back at
his old position and looking fit as
ever. Davis will be on the other
side of the line in the same position.
Douglas is back at his former posi- .
tion on end. LaFar and Romefelt
will probably take care of the guard
positions. Cassell is the only Var-
sity backfield man to-return ‘so far. -

t is too early yet to predict as
to the new men, but several are
showing up conspicuous in their
relative positions. They will no
doubt give the veteran players a hot
race for the purse, and last year’s
scrub team is not to be held too
lightly. Several of the scrubs are
making good and will undoubtedly
win places when the whistle blows
for the first game, October 25.

News from up around Coach Fet-
zer’s camp at N. C. State is rather
scarce as yet, but this much is sure:
the Tech eleven is not going to be
a bit worse than it was last year.
Coach “Bill” has his proteges out
sweating off the old avoirdupois and
when they line up at the other end
of the gridiron against us Septem-
ber 25, they will be in first class
shape.

Fifty or more candidates are out,
and prospects are bright for a ban-
ner Red and White eleven.
all of last year’s team is
Young, at guard, graduated, and
Whitaker, at center, are the only
two men to be lost, and aside from
these, the rest of the veterans will
be on deck. Faucett, All-Southern;
Gurly, Pierson, of the backfield, and
Murray, Yankee baseball property,
also in the backfield, are on hand.
