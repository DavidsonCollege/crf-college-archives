THE ‘DAVIDSONIAN

Page 3

With more than 9,000 hysterical fans looking on, North
Carolina State’s Red Terrors came from behind to edge
the White Phantoms of North Carolina 50-48, in the
final game of the 1947 Southern Conference Basketball
Tournament. The Raleigh quintet, trailing 7-20 at one
point did not go into the lead until 10 minutes of the
second half had elapsed and even then a desperate Caro-
lina rally almost tied the score with seconds remaining.
The victory gave State its first loop crown since 1929
and was a fitting climax for the Durham event.

The first and only spectacular upset occurred
in the curtain raiser Thursday when South Caro-
lina shaded Duke in a seesaw struggle, 56-54. Big
Al Adams bettered his more highly publicized
rival, Ed Koffenberger, by racking up 21 points
a figure which proved to be tops for a single
game. Phil Cantore’s push shots accounted for
17 more of the victor’s markers while Garland
Loftis’ 12 was high for the losers.

A_ sluggish State team, paced by a pair of: rangy
basketeers, Bob Bartels and Fd Negley, rolled over a
scrappy but out-classed Maryland five, 55-43. The Old
Liners stuck to a man to man defense in spite of pre-
tournament rumors that Coach Shipley would employ a
zone in an effort to halt the Terrors. Tommy Mont,
Maryland’s ace “T” formation quarterback, spearheaded
the Maryland attack but they could not keep pace with the
elongated State cagers who controlled the rebounds
throughout.

George Washington’s dark horse quintet impressed
the spectators in their first appearance by pasting, the
gallant Washington and Lee Generals. While rolling up
their 70-55 victory the men from the nation’s capital
put on the smoothest performance to which the observers
were treated during the first round, Gustafson, Kreis
berg, and Cantwell were the Colonials’ leading point
getters while Johnny Rausch, diminutive guard who was
largely responsile for G.W.’s tournament win over David-
son’s great °42~43 aggregation, turned in a fine floor
game. The Virginians’ tallies were divided between SIX
players. Harner and Chipley, two of the Gen’s big guns
fouled out, thus damaging their team’s chances materially.

North Carolina’s second seeded five blasted a scrappy
Richmond crew 55-43 in the last preliminary game. The
Spiders’ tight sliding zone slowed the play a great deal
and Carolina’s frequent “freezing” act repeatedly drew
the boos of the crowd. Coach Scott’s strategy, however,
finally drew the defenders from beneath the bucket, en-
abling the Phants to maintain their lead-by sinking quick
crip shots. Actually the criticism should have been directed
at the zone which has done much to slow basketball down.
Jim Hamilton seriously threatened Adam's single game
scoring total but was one point short when the final gun
sounded.

In spite of great expectations neither of the
semifinal contests were too exciting. In the opener
the Red Terrors were hitting on all cylinders
as they rolled over third seeded George Wash-
ington 70-47 to earn the right to compete in
the title scrap. The Hotshots, led by the superb
Dick Dickey, who demonstrated both his offensive
and defénsive abilities, went into the lead to stay
‘after about five minutes had elapsed and were
never headed. The Colonials were defintely stale
and only Bill Cantwell played consistently well.

The Gamecocks, fresh from their win over
Duke, were walloped by a clever North Carolina
club 58-33. The South Carolinians didn’t resemble
the same team which knocked off the Blue Devils
and their opponents were not to be denied. Bob
Paxton, unquestionably the meet’s outstanding
player, was consistenly hitting with his famous
push shot while his running mate, “Daddy”
Hamilton, was also rippling the mesh repeatedly.
Jim White and Norm Kohler were passing, drib-
bling, and guarding especially well. Al Adams
and Co. were guarded throughout and not one of
them was very effective.

In_ the campionship game both State and Carolina
were at their peak. The latter’s accurate marksmen
dropped long shot after long shot to go into the lead
before the. former ‘switched to a man to inan defense.
Shortly thereafter the Red Terrors put on a sustained
drive which finally sent them rocketing ahead. The Phants
did not give up and even without Hamilton ‘and’ Kohler
who left the game via the five foul route, narrowed the
gap to 2:points. Two shots, a hook by Dillian which rolled
in and then out and a wild long shot by Hartley kept
the fans gaspitig until the final gun.

Paxton played his usual brand of ball for the Phants
while White, who repeatedly calmed the losers by slowing
down the pace for a few minutes, was also outstanding.
Bartels and Negley replaced Dickey as “State’s offensive
leaders.

TOURNAMENT SIDELIGHTS

From a reliable source your, scribe learned that efforts
will be made next; year to invite all 16 conference teams
to the tournament. Such a move, however, will probably
be opposed by a number of the competing coaches.
Duke’s loss to South Carolina proved that ‘it isn’t always
true that a team has a definite advantage on its own court.
This has been one of the reasons why the event has been
held in Raleigh for a number of years. Now it appears that

Last year, the team composed of
Captain Don Bryant, Bill Hodgin,
Ford Little, and Allen Meade, came

match on the card ended in a 13-13
tie with Washington and Lee. Last
but not least on he docket was the
Southern Intercollegiate

Bryant and Hodgin both reached
the finals.
