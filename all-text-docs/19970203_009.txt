THE DAVIDSONIAN

MONDAY, FEBRUARY 3, 1997

Ah, the smell of freshly sharp-
ened. pencils... the jockeying for
position to get that certain class...
the enormous sticker price of
books... the beginning of the school
year.

One might ask why someone
would write an article about the
nuances of the start of school when
the semester is winding down.

Well, the factis, the semesteris
a mere two weeks old for us. This
is how we find ourselves in
Wiirzburg, Germany: deciding if
Tae Kwan Do counts as a PE credit,
sitting through a class that could be
either math or psychology, and de-
ciding whether we should take that
weekend trip to Paris or to Prague.

Wehave been in Germany since
August 31 and have enjoyed every
minuteof our time here since. Dur-
ing the month of September we

lived with host families in the tiny,

north German towns of Lubbecke,
Rahden, and Frotheim, affection-
ately known as the Alt Kreis
Minden-Lubbecke.

During this time we were in-
corporated into and familiarized
with the intricate workings of Ger-
man families and society. We took
afew group trips and had class once
a week, but other than that, we were
left to our own devices.

We cannot speak for everyone,

that our home stay had provided us
with.

Finally, WORZBURG! The
hopes, dreams, and fears that had
built up over the past year immedi-
ately sprang to the forefront of our
racing minds. The images of bu-
reaucracy, entrance exams, food,

have met a potpourri of wonderful
people here whorun the gamut from
salsy, Spanish senioritas to flirta-
tious, French cassanovas. Keeping
up with these people ‘socially has
been a formidable task.

A typical day for us includes
waking up a good hour and a half

but personally we loved
our families. In.fact, we
are traveling back north-
ward to spend New
Year’s with them. We
could fill a whole book
about stories from our re-
spective families, but suf-
fice it to say that the

before class begins.
We scarf down a
fresh croissant, down
some OJ, grab our
umbrellas (it rains
everyday), put on our
hiking gear, and head
“up the hill.” But,
THIS IS A HILL!

Rutings and the Hankes |
will never be forgotten.
The first of October was a gray
and rainy day that adequately re-
flected our emotions as we said
teary goodbyes to our families and
boarded the bus for the five-hour
trip to our new home in Wiirzburg.
A fresh world awaited us in our
new city, but we were content to
reflect upon the joy and comfort

and directions permeated our every

thought. Well, eventually we got

our lives in order after much trial
and error and found everything we
needed, except for ice and Dr. Pep-
per.
October was spent meeting new
‘people and studying hours every
day for the big exam that was loom-
ing at the end of the month. We

The hill from Sopho-
more Nation to Chambers looks like
aspeedbump compared to this mon-
ster. It takes about 30 minutes to
walk, although lazy people prefer
public transportation.

So we go to class with 120 of
our best German friends and try
hard to understand why that profes-
sor is applying the Taylor series to
determine the vector norm, all in

German, of course.

Writing e-mail on the 20 com-
puters available to 17,000 students
sometimes presents mental and
sometimes physical hardships.
Then we layer up to walk back
down the hill to our beloved abode.

. Our dorm, the infamous
Internationales-Haus, can best be
described as Spartan living. The
Davidson group is scattered, smoth-
ered, and covered (by the way, we
miss the Waffle House) throughout
five floors of the nine-story edifice.

Each floor consists of 15 co-
eds, one kitchen, one shower, two
toilets, and loads of love. We will
never, ever criticize Davidson fa-
cilities again. For those of you who
think that a coed hall is a tropical
paradise, just remember, you are
going to have to ask yourselves
who that person is in the stall next to
you.
These close quarters, however,
serve as a melting pot for the many
nationalities represented .on each
floor.

This past week I have been
reading a lot about Davidson tradi-
tions, specifically, about Self-Se-
lection. All this talk about tradi-
tion has me thinking about some of
my own Davidson traditions. Not
all of “my” traditions are unique to
me — though I suspect that my
habit of wearing fake tattoos to
Independant formals has not be-
come a trend — and my most im-
portant tradition is shared by nu-
merous Davidson graduates as well
as a small but enthusiastic collec-
tion of current students.

That tradition is my member-
ship in the Philanthropic Literary
Society. In June, the Society (af-
fectionately known as Phi) will
turn 160, a birthday which. repre-
jsents the survival of one of the
oldest institutions on campus. Phi,
like the Eumanean Society, was at
one time one of the few, if not only
centers of social and academic ac-
tivity onthe Davidson College cam-
pus. Membership in the society
was highly prized, and competi-
tion between the two societies was
fierce. The presence of the Societ-
ies on campus has declined over
the years, but they have not disap-
peared altogether. The Philan-
thropic Society has grown and
changed alongside of the College,
though sometimes at a slightly
slower pace; for example, the So-
ciety resisted admitting women as
members until 1983. However,
the goals of the Society and its
members — academic excellence,
the development of oratorical skills
and fellowship — have not
changed.

Iam proud to be a member of
the Philanthropic Society; when I

climb the steps of Phi Hall, the
evening’s reading clutched in my
hand, I am conscious of those who
have gone before me, the debates
which resounded from the balcony,
and the discussions which occurred
within the the Hall itself. As I
ascend the stage to take my place to
the right of the President, and open
the elderly dictionary to find the
Word of the Day, I watch the mem-
bers amble in, and I am happy that
the statesmen which regard us from
their frames still have a society to
admire. I am pleased that there are
people at Davidson that gladly sac-
rifice an hour out of their precious
Sunday evening study time to gather
in the Hall and take part in a variety
of activities, including reading se-
lected pieces of literature to their
fellows, games of Spontaneous
Story. and sometimes the odd game
of Charades. These people also serve
as a willing test audience for each
others original works of prose or
poetry.

Reading literature to each other
may not sound like much fun —
who doesn’ thave mountains of read-
ing to do on Sunday night? — but
the literature we read at Phi is not
(usually) the same as our home-
work. Our choices are guided only
by the topic of the week (War and
Peace and Drinking Stories were
two from last semester) but any-
thing on any subject is welcome.
There is no quiz at the end of the
semester.

At various times, Phi has been

accused of being too formal and

staid —not exciting enough. While
Robert’s Rules of Order is not my
favorite book, I must admit I like
the formality of the meetings. There

is a distinct measuredness to the
proceedings, certain conventions
that must be followed, which is
comforting compared to the weekly
chaos I call a schedule.

The final joy in this tradition is
that I will graduate this spring from
Davidson, and also from Phi. I will
have two diplomas. One will rep-
resent four years of academic toil.
The second will represent three
and a half years of making time for
literature, my first love, of friend-
ships and good times had within
(and without) the confines of the
Hall — and the knowledge that in
the grand scheme of things few
people have a Davidson diploma,
and even fewer havea Philanthropic
Literary Society diploma.

The diploma is also an indica-
tion that the Philanthropie Society
deems me worthy to serve as their
representaitive in the outside world.
I encountered Phi because a friend
turned off the TV, looked at me
and said “Put your coat on, we’re
going to Phi,” and I didn’t argue. I
am graduating from Phi because
from the first moment that I stepped
into the dim glow of the hall from
the freezing Davidsonian night, I
knew I had found something spe-
cial, something I did not want to
give up.

_ If anyone in the audience
would like to experience Phi for
themselves, we are still meeting in
Phi Hall (the one facing Main St.)
from 9-10 p.m. on Sunday eve-
nings. The topics forthe coming
weeks are: Valentine’s Day (2/9),

*Failure (2/16) and TBA/Historical
(2/23). Guests are eligible for
membership after attending three
meetings. All are welcome!

... Yes! Count it! With four
seconds to go the Cats have just tied
the game up. UTC inbounds the

‘ball ...

College basketball is one of the
best spectator sports in the world.
Fans root more passionately, the
players play with more devotion,
the tickets cost less, and there is no
fear that the team may suddenly
uproot and move to Baltimore. For
many students, their loyalty to their
school and its team extends far be-
yond graduation.

The Division I status of:

Davidson was an attaraction for me,
I admit it. [don’t mean to slight the
lower divisions, but Division I sports
are consistently more exciting and
are of higher quality. Whether this
is the fault of the media or not is
another issue that I am not going to
discuss.

Davidson Basketball has re-
cently resurfaced as a power in the
Southern Conference and has been
nationally recognized for its high-
quality play. Last year was one of
the best ever and the excellence is
bound to continue. The three fresh-
men marvels of last year are now
sophomores and have become hard-
ened veterans who can help guide
this year’s outstanding frosh class.
The coach has scored a coup, again.
Notonly has he been able to lure top
high school prospects to our small
school, but he has consistently
proven himself to have a gifted bas-
ketball mind and to be a top-notch
motivator, and don’t forget, he’s a
snappy dresser. He has molded his
team into a swift, powerful force
that must be reckoned with.

Unfortunately, many of the
Davidson students out there don't
realize all this. Armed with your
overused excuses, such as the trite

' Brown shoots ...

“T have so much work to do,” you
ignore your duty as a well-rounded
student and skip game after game.

Come on, lighten up. Be a
Ferris Bueller, not a Cameron Frye.
A basketball game is social. It’s
exciting. The team needs you. Don't
forget, as students, you getin FREE!
At other schools, students have to
pay. Here, you don’t even have to
camp out the night before to get
tickets. It doesn’t take that long to
walk to Baker from anywhere on
campus or from Concord Road.
Belk Arena is quite large when you
compare it with the size of our
school, so we need as many bodies
as we can get to fill itin orderto give
our team true home-court advan-
tage.

But yourresponsibility doesn’t
end once you sit down to watch.
You must cheer. Don’t be like the
majority of Davidson students.
Looking around the gym, it’s some-
times hard to tell if there’s a basket-
ball game going on, or just an in-
tense chess match. Don’t complain
about the idiots in front who keep
standing up, instead join them.
Scream when the other team shoots
freethrows. Paint your face. So the
dots are dumb, but they’ re all we’ ve
got. Wave them with all your might.

Release all of your inhibitions and

go stark raving mad for 40 minutes
of pure energy. Pretend it’s Self-
Selection night all over again (but
please keep your underwear on).
The team needs you. They’ re play-
ing great now, come on out and see
for yourself.

... and the Cats steal it back!
Twosecondson the clock ... one...
it’s good!
Davidson wins! Davidson wins!

Oh, yeah. The guys hoops team
is really good, too.
