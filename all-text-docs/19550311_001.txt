Rev. Chas. W. Ranson

To Speak At Vespers

The Vesper speaker this Sunday
is the Reverend Charles W. Ran-
son, General Secretary of the In-
ternational Missionary Council,
with headquarters in New York
City.

Dr. Renson was born in Ireland
in 1903. He received his education
in Belfast and at Oriel College,
Oxford, In 1924, Dr. Ranson en-
tered the ministry of the Methodist
Church in Ireland, and after a
period of service at home he went
to India as a missionary. On ap-
pointment to the Madras District
in India in 1029, he saw service in
several different types of work—
as a district missionary in a rural
area, as pastor of a Tamil-speaking

ere em

°

congregation in the city, and as

un evangelist to students in near-
by schools. His most continuous
and effective work, however, was
done in the Kellett Institute which
is a center of evangelism and
social witness set in the heart of
the city of Madras. In this work,
Dr. Ranson developed the two in-
terests which dominated his mis-
stonary career—the presentation of
the Gospel to the Indian people
and a passionate concern for
social renewal.

From 1943 to 1945, Dr. Ranson
served as Secretary of the Nation-
al Christian Council of India,
Burma and Ceylon. While in this
capacity he directed the National
Christian Council’s survey of
theological education and gathered
up the results of this survey in
his book, The Christien Minister
in Indie.

In 1946, Dr. Ranson became Di-
rector of the Department of Social
and Economic Research and Coun-
sel of the International Missionary
Council. In July of 1047, he was

ke
DR. CHARLES W. RANSON

elected General Secretary of the
Council, the position which he
now holds.

Dr. Ranson participated in the
Amsterdam Assembly of the World
Council of Churches and in many
of the Executive and Central Com-
mittees of the World Council which
have been held since that Assem-
bly. He is at present a member of
the Executive Committee of the
Commission on International Af.
fairs of the World Council of
Churches. He is also a member of
the Royal Institute of International
Affairs in London.

In July, 1852, he carried the
planning responsibility for the
general meeting of the Interna-
tional Missionary Council at
Willingen, Germany, where dele-
gates from {lity nations represent-
ing twenty-six major denomina-
tions were present.

In addition to his duties as

him of difficulty in meeting essen-
tial college expenses. The winners
are chosen on the basis of superior
scholastic ability, well-rounded
personality, strength of character,
and high qualities of leadership.
The Union Carbide grants cover
the complete cost of tuition for a
full, four-year academic course.
They also provide, in addition,
reasonable allowances for the
necessary books and usual fees, as
established by the college. Awards
are made on the basis of good
scholastic standing and personal
reputation, recommendation by
their school authorities, and a real
interest and ability in scientific
research. Winners have the op-
portunity of summer employment

with the Union Carbide and Car-

bon Corporation during their col-
lege years, .

Both scholarships have as their
purpose the development of youth
into men who will make real con-
tributions to soctety—the former
in the fleld of public service and
the latter in the field of scientific
research.

Philanthropic Society
To Debafe Eumanean

The Philanthropic Literary
Society met Monday night, March
7, in historic Philanthropic Hall.
President Malcolm Williamson
conducted ga short business after
which Vice President Kerry Spiers
presented the evening program.
This program consisted of several
readings from papers written by
society members in the 1946-1948
era, A remarkable parallel was
noted in these older dissertations
with the issues present on the
campus today.

The highlight of the evening
meeting was the challenge offered
by President Malcolm Williamson
to the members of the Eumeanean
Society for the annual debate. The
challenge was accepted with fear
and trepidation by Eumanean
President Tom Dove. By mutual
agreement it was decided that the
time, place, and subject of the
debate would be decided at a
Jater date. The Philanthropic
Society then adjourned for two
weeks.

Eumanean Accepts
Phi Debate Challenge

On Monday night, March 7, the
meeting of the Eumanean Literary
Society was called to order by its
president, Tom Dove.

After a short business meeting,
Bob Talbert entertained the mem-
bers of the society with his read-
ings of several poems and a short
story. Harry Brownlee, one of the
critics for the evening, was inter-
rupted during his criticism by a
rap at the door from members of
the Philanthropic Literary Society.
Malcolm Williamson, president of
Phi, came over to issue a challenge
for a debate to be held two weeks
later. The chollenge was quickly
accepted. Gordon Bondurant then
gave his criticism of Talbert’s
readings. .

Bill Gallier read a paper on the
Negroes of Africa, and Lloyd
Chapin read three short poems.
Comments on both these works
were rendered by Mr. Bondurant
and Mr. Dove.

Impromptu speeches were made
by Tony Dick on “The Faculty
Gave Us too Many Cuts,” and by
Sam Sutton on “Why Twin Beds
Are More Conducive to a Compati-
ble Marriage.” After these talks
the meeting was closed.

General Secretary of the Interna-
tional Missionary Council, Dr. Ran-
son has been visiting lecturer at
Drew University, Princeton Theo-
logical Seminary, and the Episco-
pal Theological School, Boston. He
has preached and lectured widely
both in the United States and
abroad, his latest trip being to
Switzertend, Denmark, Norway,
Sweden, Finland and Germany in
the summer of 1953. While in Ger.
many, the Theological Faculty of
the University of Kiel conferred
upon him the honorary degree of
Doctor of Theology. .

Make Florida Safari

Ten students under the direc.
tion of Professor Tom Daggy will
leave Davidson tomorrow for a
ten-day camping trip into Florida’s
outdoors. The 3,000 mile tour,
sponsored annually by Davidson’s
Biology Department, will take the
men as far south as Key West.

Spending the nights in tents and
sleeping bags, the group will travel
by automobile and will make a
number of stops to study flora and
fauna and to collect items for
further study on the return to
Davidson.

Making the trip are Curtis El-
lison, Miller Byne, Bob McCain,
Jim Knox, Bob Dalton, Bob
Shive, Tom Firor, Phil Hicks,
Homer Bodiford, Bob Wilkinson,
and Mr. Daggy.

The trip’s itinerary includes
overnight stops near Jacksonville
and Miami, two or three days in
Key West, several days in the
Everglades, and a return possibly
up the gulf coast.

The idea for the expedition
arose seven years ago when sev-
eral biology students complained
they missed trips such as members
of the college band, chorus, and
other organizations enjoy. Since
then Dr. Daggy has taken a number
of students on an expensive field
trip to Florida every year except
last year.

Florida was picked for such a
trip because it is far more ad-
vanced and has much more to offer
than other regions during this sea-
son.

Besides wading swamps and
hiking the boys hope to get in a
little fishing and skin diving in
Key West. They will return to
Davidson after spring holidays.

Ben Johnston Named
To Handbook Staff

Richmond, Va.—Ben Johnston
of Davidson has been named to the
College Board of the next volume
of the Going-to-College Handbook,
annually published here for stu-
dents in and looking forward to
college.

Nominated by college or nation-
al youth officials, members of the
College Board serve as advisors to
the editors in planning and de-
veloping the book.

At the present time the College
Board is being polled to discover
attitudes on a number of lively
campus problems.

Scheduled for publication next
August in time for hometown
going-to-college functions, the
Handbook will be used during
the remainder of the year by stu-
dents looking forward to college.

Sociology Dept.
Shows Movie Series

On Wednesdsy, March 9, the
Sociology Department and the Col-
lege Union sponsored the first in
the series of educational movies
about life in various areas of the
world,

Two films were shown Wednes-
day, both dealing with Southeast
Asia. The first dealt with the
tropical mountain island of Java.
The major portion of the film
showed the preparation of products
for export, chiefly cocoa, tea, and
rubber. It is astounding that one-
half the world’s supply of rubber
comes from Java. The main food
of the Javanese is rice, which
grows in abundance.

The second film was a presenta-
tion of the primitive life of the
nomad tribes of Malaya. Living in
vast tropical jungles, the people
wander from place to place, hunt-
ing and fishing. The movie also
showed the interesting methods of
food preparation used by the
Malayans.

Dr. Malcolm McAfee of the
Sociology Department announced
that plans have been made to show
similar moving pictures every
other Wednesday, Two films on
Africa will be shown on March 23.
On April 6, the subject will be
the Orient, with particular em-
phasis on the farming methods of
China. The New World, with em-
phasis on Eskimos and Indians,
will be the topic on April 20.

The movies will be shown in
the College Union Ballroom at 4:00
p.m., on each of the above dates.
All students are urged to attend.

Le Cercle Francais
Features Comedy

Le Cercle Francais of Davidson
College held its regular meeting
on Tuesday evening, February 22,
1955, at the home of Dr. and Mrs.
A. V. Goldiere.

After the singing of “La Mar-
seillaise” and a short business
meeting conducted by President
Fred Summers, Vice President
John Harmon presented the pro-
gram for the evening.

Larry Trotti, Steve Huntley,
and Tom Warlick each read a brief
story in French, and Jack Crymes
gave a talk on Maurice Couve de
Murville, French ambassador to the
United States.

The evening's program was high-
lighted by the presentation of a
French comedy, “La Farce du
Cuvier," by Fred Summers, Albert
Harris, Bill Gordon and Tommy
Dove.

A cross-word puzzle in French

and the serving of refreshments by

Mrs. Goldiere and Mrs. Watts
ended the evening’s meeting.

Sandburg To Appear
In D. C. Artist Series

Poet-Historian Here | HF”

Night of March 24

By DO. H. OGDEN

On Thursday, March 24, at 8:15
one of the outstanding literary
figures of our time will appear on
the Davidson platform—Carl Sand-
burg. Wrote T. K. Whipple of the
poet, “The best term that 1 can
find for Sandburg is that of a
psalmist .. . His feelings - for
the sky, the ocean, the winds, for
all the more grandiose aspects of
nature, for vastness in time and
space, is like that of the Psalms...
Sandburg’s poetry is in truth a
veritable Psalm of Life—for he
is essentially an accepting, yea-
saying psalmist.”

Burl Ives, who was previously
scheduled to appear at this time
on the Davidson Artist Series, is
opening that night in New York
in Tennessee Williams’ new play,
“Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.”

Carl Sandburg was born in 1878

Dr. Henry David Calls College Educational
Service Stations in Speech fo Conference

(Reprinted from The Chicago
Daily News)

Chicago, I1.—This has been a
gloomy week for college and uni-
versity officials. For the third
time in four days, they found
themselves the target of sharp at-
tacks,

They were told Tuesday that

most of them operate “service sta-

tions” rather than colleges.

The meaning of education has
been lost, the speaker said, in a
maze of superficial activities, in-
ternal organizations or administra-
tive structures.

1000 EDUCATORS

The barrage of blows came from
Dr. Henry David, executive secre-
tary of the National Manpower
Council at Columbia University.
He gave the keynote speech before
1000 college presidents, deans and
other educators, attending the Na-
tional Conference of the Associo-
tlon for. Higher Learning. Four
hundred and sixty colleges, cover.
ing every state except Maine, are
represented.

Five Profs Depart:

Pietenpol Announces
’55-’56 Faculty Changes

Many of the changes and addi-
tions to the faculty for the 1955-56
college year were announced yes-
terday by Dean Pietenpol, Dovid-
son College Dean of Faculty.

Those members of the faculty
who have resigned and will not
return to Davidson next year in-
clude Professor Erwin C. Buell,
assistant professor of Political
Science; Dr. George Labban, as-
sistant professor of Greek; Pro-
fessor Peter Terwey, assistant pro-
fessor of mathematics; Professor
Alexander Vavoulis, assistant pro-
fessor of chemistry; and Professor
Benjamin H. Wilson, assistant pro-
fessor of English.

Professor Labban has resigned
in order to accept the position as
Professor of Greek at Southwestern
University in Memphis, while Pro-
fessor Terwey has accepted a
position in the mathematics de-
partment of Lamar College in
Texas.

Professors Vavoulis and Ben-
jamin Wilson have both resigned
to continue their study for their
doctorates. Professor Buell has not
yet announced his future plans.

New members of the faculty next
year will include Dr. H. P. Ford,
Dr. Richard R. Bernard, and Pro-
fessor H. Alden Bryan.

Dr Ford, who will be associate
professor of Political Science, grad-
uated from the University of Red-
lands in California, and took his
Ph. D. in Political Science from the
University of Chicago in 1950. He
was a Kent Fellow during his grad-
uate study. Now employed by the

State Department in Washington,
his interest is concentrated on the
Far East.

Dr. Richard Bernard, a graduate
of the University of Virginia, will
be an associate professor of mathe-
maties.\ He also did his graduate
work at the University of Virginia,
and has since been an assistant
professor of mathematics at Yale
University. He served in the U, S.
Navy during World War II, work-
ing with the Exterior Ballistic De-
partment of Naval Proving
Grounds,

Professor Bryan will get his Doc-
torate in Chemistry from the -Uni-
versity of Tennessee in June. He
graduated from King College, then
took a position as a chemistry
instructor at the University of
Tennessee, where he is now serv-
ing. He will be with the chemistry
department at Davidson.

Taking over the reins as Director
of Athletics next year will be
Dr. Tom Scott, who will get his
Doctorate from Columbia in June.
Mr. Scott, who has served on the
faculty at Chapel Hill, was coach
of the famous Phillips 66 basket-
ball team for several years.

Returning to their positions on
the faculty next year will be Dr.
William McGavock, professor of
mathematics, and Dr. Frontis John-
ston, professor of history. They
have both taken leaves of absence
to study under the Ford Founda-
tion. -

Other changes in the faculty, if
any, will be announced later in the
semester by Dean Pietenpol.

“With a few notable exceptions,”
said Dr. David to the somewhat
uneasy-looking educators, “higher
education has been defensive about
its intellectual functions and re-
sponsibilities.

“It has been all too willing to
escape from these to grapple with
less difficult problems of in-
ternal organization, administrative
structure and
activities.

“Many institutions of higher edu-
cation discourage critical thought
and reflection in both their stu-
dents and their faculties.

“Too many of them respond so
readily to the demands made upon
them by society that they tend
to operate as educational service
stations rather than as educational
institutions.” ;

Dr. David said that the colleges
have fashioned their own profes-
sional language —“jargon,” he
called it—which has helped to
isolate the professors from the
community at large.

EMPHASIS ON SCIENCE

‘fhe current emphasis on science
and technical subjects is danger-
ous for the future welfare of
higher education, Dr. David
warned. +

Even though engineers and
scientists are needed, other
branches of learning are of equal
importance, he stressed.

The social sciences, humanities,
education, the arts and religion
must not be neglected, the speaker
said.

Dr. David objected to the atti-
tude, held in some quarters, that

men talk, learning the songs the
people sang. “Nothing could have
been better.” Amy Lowell wrote,
“The pictures which all these
trades have left in his mind have
greatly enriched his work.”

When the Spanish American War
broke out, young Sandburg enlisted
in the first company to set foot on
Puerto Rican soil. Upon his re-
turn, he worked his way through
Lombard College in Galesburg
where Professor Philip Green
Wright encouraged him and helped
him publish his first book of
poems in 1904.

After college he engaged in va-
rious activities, chiefly journalistic.
In 1914 he was awarded the
Levinson prize by Poetry Magazine
for the best poem published in
‘that magazine during the year.

1916 marked the appearance of
his Chicago Poems (including such
works as “Fog,” “Chicago,” and
“Nocturne in a Deserted Brick-
yard") which shocked some
Americans with their brutal frank-
ness and seeming formlessness of
verse. But America had got “a new
voice” and soon the “new” poetry
meant that of Carl Sandburg. His
free verse is not far from prose,
his style is his own, and his new
four-time movement (as opposed
to the English three-time move-
ment) carries the “vision, the
anger, the tenderness, and the
irony" of the poet.

Cornhuskers (1918), which won
a special Pulitzer Prize, Smoke and
Steel (1920), and Slabs of the Sun-
burnt West (1922) reflected the
life of the plain people, Sandburg
relying on the wisdom of the peo-
ple he knew, his people — the
American people. in Good Mern-
ing, America (1928) we find an
undertone of brooding and pes-
simism with the use of symbols of
mist, fog, and ashes. These- works
established him as an American
artist, working often with ver-
nacular cadences and slang, and
sometimes with subtle impres-
sionism such as “Fog.”

Of the strange and powerful
The People, Yes, which appeared
in 1936, a number of critics have
said, “It is one of the great Ameri-
can books.”

Between 1917 and 1933 he wrote
for the Chicago Dally News, later
supporting himself by lectures and
book sales, while he penned the
magnificent and beautiful biogt
raphy of Lincoln which won the
1940 Pulitzer Prize for history.
The work includes Abraham Lin-
coln: the Prairies Years in two
volumes (1926) and Abraham Lin
coln: the War Years in four vol:
umes (1939).

Remembrance Rock (1948) is a
long, historical novel and last year
appeared Always the Young
Stranger, a sensitive account of his
early life.

Students will be admitted to
the presentation by their identifi-
cation cards and tickets will be
available at the door.

Fire Destroys Biology
Examinations at NYU |

New York (ACP)—Destruction
of biological final examination pa-
pers was given as a motive for a
$2,000 toss due to fire at New
York University. In addition to the
examination papers, almost all of
the professor’s research and grad-
uate notes were completely burned.
These notes, including his lecture
notes, represented an accumula-
tion of many years’ work, the
Heights Daily News reported.

The plant department superin-
tendent said that while the
arsonists have not been found, It
is generally believed that they
were students. “This view is
further substantiated,” the Daily
News says, “by the fact that noth-
ing was stolen, since a ‘typewriter
and other items of value re-
mained unburnt after the fire.”

The professor said that most of
the students in his Comparative
Anatomy course will receive a
grade of “P" certifying simply that
they have passed. However, he
added, that a few students will re-
ceive a grade of “F.”
