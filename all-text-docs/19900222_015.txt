Wildcats hit the track and the record books again;
Freshmen bow to experience

By JAY CLUGSTON

The men’s and women’s track and
field teams ended their indoor season
with “strong” performances at Satur-
day’s Lynchburg College(Va) relays,
according to coach Gary Andrew. Two
indoor | school records were broken
despite.a slow 12 lap per mile track and
weaker competition than the Cats’ pre-
vious two meets at Virginia Tech.

The women’s team defeated Lyn-
chburg College and Bridgewater Col-
lege for the team title. The men, lacking
in numbers, dominated the distance
relays but finished fifth of five teams.

Kathy Beach, named most valuable
female performer, won the 880
yd.(2:31.4) the two-mile (12:16.2) and
anchored the winning 4 x 880 yd. relay

(11:25.7). The weaker competition al-
lowed Beach, who had missed practice
three days the previous week due to
sickness, to run the two mile as a train-
ing run, going out the first mile in 6:31
and running the final mile in 5:45.

Susan Swift broke theindoor shot-put
record with a put of 33 ft. 8 in. She also
improved her 300 yd. (45.1) and 60 yd.
hurdles (9.7) times. Swift is “hungry”
and should break the outdoor shotput
record during the upcoming outdoor
season, according to sprint and field
event coach, Beth Manson.

Other strong female performances
were by Heather Tarplay running two
of Davidson’s fastest races in history-60
yd. Hurdles (9.4) and 300 yd (41.9),
Jennifer Brown 880 yd (2:34.2) and

Sarah Sadowski two-mile (13:34.5). All
three of those women combined with
Kathy Beach to form the already men-
tioned winning 4 x 880 yd relay team.

The highlight for the men’s team was
the defeat.of the freshman 4 x 1 mile
relay team (Ian Stewart, David Kerns,
Ben Wiley and Peter Hurtado) by the
upperclass team of Chris Otrok; David
Murray, Ted Richardson and Jay Clug-
ston.

The freshmen, who jumped out to a
surprisingly early lead, were put in
their place by sophomore Richardson’s
third leg, which gave the upperclass-
men a 13 second lead. Freshman Peter
Hurtado’s 4:40 fourth leg could only
close the gap to 10 seconds and the
upperclassmen won 19:09 to 19:19. Both

of those times broke the existing school
record and the teams placed first and
second.

The menalsoentered the twoteamsin
the distance medley relay (800-440-
1370-mile), which placed first and third.
The first place team (11:25.1) was aided
by excellent legs ran strong 880 yards in
the 4 x 880 relay to place the Wildcats
second improved his shot put to (32’6")
and sophomore transfers Lewis Guedry
(300 yards-38.7) and Jeff Fraley (60
yards-7.2; 300 yards-38.7) made their
collegiate debut. Freshman Dan Franks
made his mark at 37.9-300 yards.

The Wildcats begin their outdoor
track season during spring break with
meets at UNC-Wilmington and the
University of Miami.

played as the fifth team.
Brewer and Ruth were the
most consistent and successful
team, according toCoach Caro-
line Brown-Price. They won
two matches against Furman
and Virginia Tech. “The
matches were very competi-
tive, and we were
up against some
tough teams. Our
biggest accom-
plishment was not
letting” ourselves:
be beaten before
we even stepped
onto the court,”
Brewer said.
“After two
and a half days of
doubles, I can see
a huge improve-
ment. The week-
end gave our team
a chance to get out
and play some
outstanding
teams, and to try
out what they've
