Marathon distance adds motivation and meaning to running

By Christy Block

Torun a marathon is, through
the eyes of the average onlooker,
an act of sheer lunacy. Ask those
running what they think, and they’ll
tend to agree, “but that’s the fun of
it.”

When asked why she’d even
consider trying to run 26.2 miles,
Senior Bailey Foster, who is train-
ing for the Savannah Marathon in
February, replied, “It gives me
something to work toward during
my runs, and it has nothing to do
with school.”

Besides being a great stress
release, “the challenge of it” gives
it a certain glamour, as Heather
Crouse explains. The attraction of
the marathon appears tobe a strange
and mysterious thing to those who
don’t run at all, and perhaps the
marathon can not even be appreci-

ated by those who have not at-
tempted such a feat.

The challenge of the mara-
thon is not merely a question of
strength, nor is it a question of
speed, The marathon’s challenge
lies in its demiand for a certain
lifestyle and a perfected form of
training; if the runner does not
train properly for a race of this
caliber, he or she will hit what
runners refer to as “The Wall” and
not successfully get past it without
stopping the race.

After running 15-20 biiies tt the
body runs out of carbohydrates to
burn for energy, and so must take
from its stored energy: fat. Asa
result of this change, the runner’s
energy level decreases because fat
does not burn as quickly as glu-
cose/carbohydrates. The body does
its own version ofa downshift, and

the runner, if not trained to men-
tally conquer the lower energy
output of “The Wall”, will not fin-
ish the race despite how good his
or her physical form.

In Bob Glover and Pete
Schuder’s Competitive Runner’s
Handbook, they explain the draw
of the marathon: “It symbolizes
the peak of physical and mental
performance. Once you finish a
marathon, you are a real runner.”

Senior Jenny Satterfield is a
veteran of the marathon run, and is
presently training for the Charlotte
Marathon in January, which hap-
pens to be the fourth most difficult
in the nation.

When asked if her involve-
ment with marathon running has
changed her, Jenny answered: “It
shapes your life. It changes the
way you look at things: you look at

Smoke clears: Union survey results in

By Susan Warren

Friday, September 17, 352
Davidson students, faculty, and
employees filled out a question-
naire concerning smoking sections
in the Union Cafe and in the Com-
mons. Though the majority of the
1,000 surveys issued were not re-

turned, those that were show in-
sightinto students’ feelings toward
smoking and smokers.

These surveys were distrib-

complaints from non-smokers and

“that those who smoke make rea-

Record enrollment expected
Washington, D.C. (CPS)—The
number of college students en-
rolled in public and private insti-
tutions is expected to reach a new
high of 15 million this fall, Secre-
tary of Education Richard Riley
said in the annual “Back-to-
School” forecast.

The number of earned de-
grees that will be awarded this
academic year is also expected to
set records. According to the
Department of Education esti-
mates, 504,000 associate degrees
will be awarded; 1.1 million
bachelor’s degrees; 378,000
master’s degrees; 41,000 doctor-
ates; and 75,000 professional de-
grees in medicine, theology and
law.

It is estimated that colleges
and universities will spend about
$198.1 billion in 1993-94, up 3
percent since 1992. In the past 10
years, higher education spending
has climbed 53 percent.

Average spending per full-
time equivalent college student is

percent since 1983-84. Publiccol-
lege spending averages $13,400
per student; for private colleges
spending averages $24,000.

Women dancing with

The University of New Mexico,
Albuquerque, N.M. (CPS)— A
country and western dance class

many women, was offered by the
physical education department for
one credit with the intent to teach
students how to dance in social
situations, according to the Daily
Lobo, the school newspaper.

The instructor, Jim Calvert,
made the comment to graduate
student Jill Cornell. He later said
he did not intend to discriminate,
but wanted to keep the ratio of
men and women even so tradi-
tional roles could be practiced in
the classroom.

“T have no problem with la-
dies dancing with ladies,” Calvert
told the newspaper. “But to avoid
confusion, I’drather havea leader
Stay a leader through the whole
class. Leading is a job and fol-
lowing is a job. It gets confusing
to switch back and forth.”

Mandela offered
honorary doctorate
Gainesville, FL(CPS)— ‘African
National Congress founder
Nelson Mandela may be offered
an honorary doctoral degree by
the University of Florida, for his
work in human rights in South
Africa.

There are some behind-the-
scenes discussion on the matter,
said Peter Schmidt, director of the

“It’s in delicate negotiations
rightnow. We haven’t heard yet,”
Schmidtsaid. A formal invitation
will be sent to Mandela if he is
interested in accepting. Mandela
was nominated by Schmidt and
Distinguished Service Professor

negotiations began shortly there-
after.

sonable efforts to minimize the
annoyance caused to others.”

The surveys grouped the par-
ticipants into regular smokers, oc-
casional smokers, and non-smok-
ers. Each group was asked the
following four questions:

¢ Do you feel you should be
allowed the privilege of smoking
in the dining facilities?

¢ Would you agree to a policy

" that doesnot allow smoking in any

part of the dining area?

' © Would you agree to a policy
allowing smoking in sil esta
areas only?

¢ Would you agree to a sotiey
allowing smoking only outside the
building?

In the Union Cafe and the
Commons most students who re-
sponded to the survey were non-
smokers. They felt that smoking
should be prohibited inside but al-
lowed outside the building.

The Cafe differed from the
Commons in that the non-smokers
would consent to designated non-
smoking and smoking areas, while
the Commons’ eaters were against
smoking anywhere but outdoors.

Of the respondents who do
smoke, the majority felt they should
be allowed to smoke indoors, in
both the Cafe and the Commons.

Carleton Pritchard, Director
of Auxiliary Services, was in
charge of this survey and describes
the Commons’ results: “The sur-
vey strongly indicates that students,
faculty, and staff concur in the
notion that the Commons public
areas be smoke free areas.”

Though the diners at the Cafe
had a much more liberal view to-
ward smokers, the majority felt
that smokers should not beallowed
the privilege of smoking in the
facilities.

A more detailed version of
this survey’s results will be avail-
able later this week at both the
Commons and the Union Cafe.

food as energy, you take care of
yourself and listen to your body
like never before.”

The challenge of the mara-
thonis alluring for some, repulsive
for others, but universally worthy
of respect. Marathon training is
full of possibilities for injury due
to over training, not stretching
properly, or in some cases not get-
ting enough water or food for this

type of physical stress.
But apart from the dangers of
uneducated training, marathon
training gives the daily jog a dis-
tinguished flair. One needn’t be a
talented athlete norin superb physi-
cal form to train. All it takes is a
time commitment and the desire to
claim the status of “real running-
hood,” and the long run becomes
your own road less traveled.

Ortmayer wins the CASE

CASE continued from page 1

He started his work with the
case teaching method four years

ago, after he received a fellowship
from the Pew Foundation for Fac-

ulty Fellowship for Foreign Af-
fairs based in Harvard.

The fellows were supposed to
look at case studies as a means of
teaching. They were encouraged
to write new case studies for use
with undergraduates in order to
keep courses fresh.

The fellows share their case
studies with the other teachers for
use in the classroom. Ortmayer
and his colleagues can see the di-
rect application of their research,
while other people’s research goes
unnoticed.

Ortmayer learned about the

award two weeks ago at a faculty
meeting, but the teachers were told
not to say anything publicly until
last Monday. CASE wanted to
announce the award winners si-
Multaneously in the other 46 states
in which the award is given.

From thestate winners, CASE
picks a national teacher of the year.
Dr. Rosemary Tong, a philosophy
professor, is the only Davidson
College professor to have won the
national award.

Each year the campus nomi-
nates someone forthe award. Then,
the nominated professor and Rob-
ert Williams, the Dean of the Fac-
ulty, get letters of recommenda-
tion from students and alumni.
Thus, Ortmayer was able to win
the award, because of the respect
his students have for him.
