n has not been offi-

Hl telat up by the Advi-
Board, Kello sees three
‘alternative methods

ee ee

One, that ‘semi-finalists

"who were not in fact selected

to be NC Fellows” be invited.
Two, that ‘‘recommenda-

selors, from faculty, from the
Dean of Students, and so on
can be taken for outstanding
individuals.”’

And threw, that ‘‘soffiething
of a mini-selection procedure”’
be gone through again. This
last alternative, however,
would ‘‘take a considerable
amount of time and would eat
up a lot of resources,’’ in
Kello’s opinion.

Kello feels certain that other
selection procedures will be
proposed in the Advisory
Board meeting.

Whatever plan is adopted,
Kello wants to be sure that
people who would like to be
part of NCF' are not ‘‘bumped
off’ of the program.

Procedures for the evalua-
tion of students currently part
of the program have not yet
been established or discussed.

Although there is no pro-
cedure in the Fellows docu-
ment which deals with such an
evaluation, and NCF currently
has no mechanism for carrying
this process out, Kello expects
that ‘‘it would be done mainly
by the Advisory Board.”

“The basic information that
we need in order to decide who
is not using the program is
already available,” Kello ex-
plained.

Each NCF student has a file
in which all information re-
lated to his work in or through
NCF is kept.

All correspondence to or
from the student’s summer
internship supervisors, his
summary and evaluation of
these internships and a des-
cription of his other NCF-re-
lated activities is held for the
student’s personal file.

“We wouldn't have to do
anything extraneous to what
we already do to get that
information,’’ said Kello.

Additionally, a student’s
involvement in activities out-
side of the program would be
taken into account in such an
evaluation.

**We recognize that, in a
funny kind of way, if the
program is working well we
are likely to have students
who are less involved with the
program than they were ini-
tially.

“Tf we have in fact selected
students who show great lead-

‘My overall feeling is that
when people have taken ad-
vantage of their internship
opportunities they’ve taken

full advantage of them.”

Kello offered two possible
explanations of why some .
F don’t take advantage
of the program’s opportuni-

Those students who are less
actively involved in the pro-

gram ‘‘either have not worked
hohe our office and Ken
Wood’s (Experiential Learn-
ing) office early enough in the
year and have let summers
and other opportunities go by,
or have lined up internships
but haven't taken advantage
of their opportunities.”

Kello does not see that the
program’s limited budget
would block the acceptance of
upperclassmen into NCF.

It would cost NCF ‘‘very
little extra money” to admit
additional upperclassmen into
the program’s set on-campus
activities.

“The major expense of hav-
ing a few more people would be
in terms of summer intern-
ships.

“We won’t be getting extra
money to help fund summer
internships but our stockpile
of paying internships seems to
be going slowly but steadily.
ily.

“We are growing...almost
day by day, and certainly
month by month. We are
able to open up more paying
internships.”

This expansion, according
to Kello, is due to the work of
Mrs. Martin (Assistant Direc-
tor of NCF), and through
sharing the contacts and re-
sources of Ken Wood’s office
and the trustees of the pro-
gram, the Trustees, business
and professional leaders in
various areas volunteer part of
their time to travel the region
and the country to talk to
people in various research
organizations.

‘‘We want NCF to be an
alive, working, developing
kind of thing. '

“Tf it isn’t doing that for an
individual, I would hope that
the individuals we have in the
program ,would have enough
integrity, and a sense of re-
sponsibility to the college
community and to the pro-
gram to say, ‘Look, I’ve made
a decision for myself; this isn’t
right for me. I’m not taking
advantage of my opportunity
