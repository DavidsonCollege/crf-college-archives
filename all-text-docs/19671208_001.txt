STUDENT LIFE SUBCOMMITTEE

Report Proposes Changes In Athletics, Social Life

By GEORGE ALLEN
Staff Writer ;

Sweeping changes for student life are being pro-
posed in the Blue Sky Subcommittee Report on Stu-
dent Life, which is now being considered by the Blue
Sky Committee. ; .

The report suggests many changes, including:

—Non-subsidized athletics;

—Strengthened extracurriculat programs;

—Renovation and construction of dormitories;

—A total reorganization of and increased oppor-
tunities for student social life, to include drinking on
campus. ;

Proposed changes fall into three categories, ac-
cording to senior Bobby Lane, subcommittee chairman.
They are: the functional relationship of the college to
the student, the professional relationships of student
to college and the personal relationship of student to
college.

in athletics, the report recommends that Davidson
implement a vigorous -non-subsidized program. This
would mean that a greater emphasis would be placed

Resolution Asks
Ticket Reserve

By JOHN WILLIAMS
Staff Writer

Student Council Secretary Sam Darby proposed
Tuesday a resolution that the Davidson Athletic De-
partment reserve 1,000 tickets for Duke students at
the Davidson-Duke basketball game next season in the
Charlotte Coliseum.

The proposal highlighted a somewhat rowdy coun-
¢il méeting and followed an announcement by Presi-

dent Tom Earnhardt that proposed Residence Hall As.

on intramural athletics and that intercollegiate com-
petition would be with schools nearer Davidson's size.

The committee recommends that Davidson seek
membership in the College Athletic Conference, which
is composed of such schools as the University of the
South and Washington and Lee University.

In the area of interpersonal relationships, the
report recommends changes for dormitory life, the
College Union and social life organization.

The residence hall proposals call for larger dormi-
tories equipped with lounges, suites, storage areas and
kitchenettes. These changes would demand a substan-
tial capital outlay, but the subcommittee indicated that
these changes would be worth the expense.

The subcommittee implies the abolishment of the
fraternity system, and suggests uses for the houses on
Patterson Court.

In the subcommittee outline, seven of the houses
would be used as dining halls open to ail students.
Under the assumption that a new building would be
constructed, the College Union cafeteria would serve
as another dining hall for those students who could

ROTC Slated
For Inspection

The faculty will meet
Tuesday to consider the
proposals of the Blue
Sky Committee on
ROTC.

The Tuesday meeting
has been scheduled so
that the faculty can con-
sider and act upon the
proposals before the
meeting of the Board of
Trustees on Dec. 20.

The Blue Sky recom-

+

not be accommodated at the houses on Patterson Court.

The remaining five houses would be used for aca-
demic and administrative purposes. One house would
become a record library and art studio; the second
would be a guest house annex; the third would house
the placement bureau; the fourth would be a foreign
language center; and the fifth would serve as a visual
aids center.

Recommendations for a new Union include more
lounges and television rooms, a snack bar and a Rath-
skellar serving beer and wine.

Concerning student religious life, the report states
that if the college is going to take its religious com-
mitment seriously, it must commit more financial re-
sources to it.

The report suggests that a revitalization of cultural
activities and the functioning of special interest groups
(clubs, music, etc.) is needed.

It specifically recommends the organization of
short-term discussion groups dealing with a specific
topic. These might meet for a short period, say for
several weeks, and might be organized like the present

Committee Wants Senate,

the Duke Athletic Depart-
ment had reserved no
tickets for Davidson stu-
dents for the game in
Durham this year.

The resolution reads: “At
its meeting of Dec. 5, the
Student Council expressed
the view that some tickets
should be made available to
students supporting opposing
teams at all Coliseum games.

“Opposing teams should al-
ways have the benefit of sup-
port from students represent-
ing their institutions. In the
interest of hospitality, we
hope that such a policy will
become standard practice.

“Specifically, the council
voted to make 1.000 tickets
available to Duke University
for its faculty and students -
for the game to be played
on Feb. 19, 1969. at the Char-
lotte Coliseum.

“Since this is always an
important game for the teams
of both Davidson and Duke,
we feel that it is only fair
that these tickets be made
available to Duke with the
stipulation that all unsold
tickets be returned within 10
days of the game.”

After heated discussion of
Duke’s failure to provide at
least some tickets for this
year’s game, the council de-
cided that a copy of the reso-
lution ought to be sent to
Duke immediately following
the Jan. 3 game.

Franklin Anderson, mem-
ber of the Constitution Re-
vision Committee, told the
council about the ‘“‘compro-
mise” which would allow the

Body Constitution.

Anderson said the RHA
would be governed by a Resi-
dence Hall Committee. pro.

consisting of proportionate
representation from all dor-
mitories. The representative
can be either a member of

mitory.

Tickets

To Student Body

By BOB DUNHAM
News Editor

The Duke University Ath-
letic Department announced
this week that it would not
provide any tickets to David
son students for the Duke-
Davidson basketball game
Jan. 3.

The announcement spark-
ed a series of reactions and
counter-actions from both
personhel of the Davidson
Athletic Department and stu-
dents.

In making the announce-
ment, Duke Athletic Director
Eddie Cameron said, ‘“We
just don't have the tickets
at this time. If we have any
left over after our students
are taken care of, we will
send them to Davidson, but
that appears very unlikely
at this time.”

“Our gymnasium — seats
8,500."° said Cameron. ‘'We

sold 3,500 season tickets,
which leaves 5,000 tickets for
our students. Due to the size
of the Duke student body,
this won't even be enough
for our own students. And
we must take care of our stu-
dents first."

Dr. Tom Scott. Davidson
athletic director, expressed
his regrets about the action,
but said the matter of. ticket
sales is up to the individual
school.

“It happens all over the
country,” Scott said. “If a
school decides not to give the
visiting team any tickets, it
is their prerogative.”

“I wrote in September,
asking for 200 to 500 tickets,"
said Basketball Coach
Charles (Lefty) Driesell,
“but they (Duke) told me
they couldn't do that. They
said they had to take care of
their students first.”

Adding that Davidson
would not give Duke any
seats next year, Driesell
said. “Their move just does
not make sense.”

Informed of Driesell's
statement, Cameron said he’
was “not upset.”

Government Association

By BOB TRAVERS
Associate Editor

The final draft of the new
Student Body Constitution.
which was officially released
by the Constitution Revision
Committee to the Student
Council this morning. calls
for drastic changes in the
structure of student govern-
ment and in the area of stu.
dent rights.

An open forum on the Con.
stitution will be held Tuesday
at 4:30 p.m. in the Morrison
Room of the College Union.
Members of the constitution
committee will be present to
explain and dicuss the draft.

The Constitution calls for
the creation of a Student
Government Association
(SGA) consisting of all regu-
larly enrolled students. The
SGA will elect a Senate as
its legislative unit and a
president and vice president
to head its executive unit, the

eran
COMPLETE DRAFT
See Page Six

Senate Executive Committee
(SEC).

The Constitution also at-
tempts to spell out the rights
and responsibilities of the
students in Article IV. which
has become known as the Bill
of Rights.

This part of the constitution
attempts to protect the aca-
demic freedom of students.

It will attempt to prevent
professors from determining
course grades on any basis
except academic accomplish-
ment. It will also prevent un-
reasonable searches of dor-
mitory rooms and’ student
cars.

All searches will require a
search warrant which will
specify what is to be searched

and for what purpose. Such
warrants will be good for 12
hours.

The Senate will have 23
members. Each class _ will
elect three members, and
nine members will be elected
from all dormitories, distri-
buted according to the num.
ber of residents in each
dorm. The president of the
SGA, who wii! serve as mod-
erator of the Senate, and the

vice president constitute the
remaining members of the
Senate.

The Constitution also calls
for the creation of a Court
of Appeals to handle any con-
stitutional questions and ‘ap
peals from the Honor Court
and the Student Regulations
Court, which will continue to
exist, although the regulations
court has been renamed Stu
dent Governiment Court.

Local AAUP Members
Praise New Rights Bill

By DAVID COOK
Staff Writer

The proposed Bill of Rights
drew a number of favorable
comments yesterday at an
open meeting of the local
chapter of the American As-
sociation of University Pro-
fessors.

About two dozen professors
and a handful of students re
viewed both the Bill of Rights
and a document of the AAUP
national organization and
found them to be quite. simi-
lar. :

Time did not permit dis-
cussion of the entire Bill of
Rights. and the local AAUP
took no definite stand on it.
The professors agreed to
meet again sometime after
Christmas.

Dr. J. H. Ostwalt, registrar
and associate dean of the
faculty, said afterwards that

“any action on the provisions.

of the two reports should be
a cooperative endeavor—a
two way street between stu.
dents and faculty.”

The major point of discus-
sion during the meeting was
the matter of confidential
student reports. Ostwalt.

Student Is Campused
In Drinking Violation

A junior found guilty of
possession of alcohol on cam-
pus was restricted to campus
until March 23 by the Faculty
Committee on Student Disci-
pline Thursday night.

The student said that he
would appeal the decision to
the Faculty Executive Com-
mittee, Dean of Students
Richard C. Burts said.

The alleged violation occur-
red last Friday night. Securi-
ty officer Al Carriker discov-
ered the violation.

Concurrent with the cam-

pusing sentence is disciplin-.
ary probation, Burts said.
The student's parents have
been notified of the action.

The appeal. if carried out.
will be the first appeal from
the Student Discipline Com-
mitte to the Executive Com-
mittee under the new Facul-
ty Constitution instituted this
fall.

Therefore, appeal proce-
dures have not yet been de-
termined, Burts said. How-
ever, appeal proceedings
must be begun in the next

five days. It is not known
whether the appeal will be
held before the Christmas
holidays or not, Burts said.

The penalty has no_ effect
until the final appeal is con
cluded.

Burts said that the student
did not dispute the details of
the incident. Carriker was not
present but had sent in a re
port.

The student was to confer
with Burts today about be-
ginning appeal proceedings.

agreeing with the recommen.
dations of both the national
AAUP and the proposed Bill
of Rights, said ‘‘a general ad.
ministrative rule should be
passed requiring written per
mission from the student.in
order to release a record.”

The professors also touched
on the problem of “improper”
academic evaluation and the
role of the Controversial
Speakers Committee. which
sets speaker policy.

Stimulus programs.

The subcommittee suggests that the college imple-
ment a new code of conduct, containing a Code of
Intelfectual Responsibility and a Code of Social Respon-
sibility.

The former would set forth standards of honor in
academic work; the latter would serve as a guide for
the student in his relationship with his community.

Lane commented on the future of the report, now
under consideration.

“Tam fearful, he said, “that the report or sections
of the report are going to get lost in the administrative
quagmire of the committee structure.

“It seems to me that, at the very least, this report
raises some serious questions concerning the area of
student life at Davidson College which have not been
dealt with as deeply as they should have been,” Lane
said.

Other committee members are: Dr. Anthony
Abbott, secretary; Bill Andrews, John W. Gresham,
Hansford Epes and Drs. A. B. Brinkley, James G. Mar-
tin, W. G. McGavock, Charles Ratliff. :

Proposed Dump Site

Draws Citizens’ Ire

By DICK ANDERSON
Staff Writer

A proposal by the Meckien.
burg County Commissioners
that a garbage disposal area
be located just outside the
Davidson town limits began
gathering opposition this
week.

The Commissioners stress-
ed that the disposal area
would be a “land fill.’ but
concerned citizens led by Bill
Bondurant, assistant to Presi-
dent D. Grier Martin. labeled
it a “dump” and began cir-
culating petitions in protest.

The Commissioners’ propos-
al. contingent upon the ap-
proval of the Davidson town
board, asks that the garbage
disposal area be located one
mile south of town on Con-
cord Road.

The main purpose of the
“land fill is to cover over
a gully-filled area, according
to Dr. James G. Martin, Com.
missioners’ chairman and
Davidson chemistry profes-
sor.

**We have authorized a full-
time position for an equip-
ment operator to insure daily
attention to the coverage of
refuse,”’ he said.

However, Bondurant. a4
resident of the area, cited
odor and a decrease in land

value as two criticisms.
“The town already has a
rodent problem of serious
concern to a number of her
residents,"’ he said. ‘A near-
by garbage dump would com-
pound this problem immense-

F ire Rul

Martin promised to have
trees planted along the road
to shield the dump from view.
However, Bondurant said
that this idea was as ‘‘unper-
suasive~ as trees allegedly .
shielding automobile grave-
yards from view."'

The vote was 175-145 in
favor of the amendment, but
212 was necessary for the
two-thirds majority. One stu-
dent cast a neutral ballot.

An earlier election Tuesday
was invalidated because bal-
lots were distributed to the
freshmen in assembly. Ac.
cording to the Constitution,
freshmen are not allowed to
vote until second semester.

Student Council President
Tom Earhhardt said he was
“disappointed with the elec-
tion," but added that he
hoped it would ‘make stu-
dents aware of the danger of
setting even a small fire in
the dormitories.”
