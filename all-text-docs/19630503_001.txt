Former President Sparks
Debate At Council Meeting

John Spratt, president of the Student Council, and Danny Carrell, the past presi-

dent, locked horns in council debate on Carrell’

s motion to give the Honor Court the

authority to interpret controversial sections of the Student Body Constitution at the
council’s meeting Wednesday night.

Carrell’s motion was to give
the Honor Court the power to
interpret articles seven and
eight of the Student Body Con-
stitution. (Article seven is the
Honor Code and article eight is

Arbuckle Fecuses
Light On Gambling

Howard Arbuckie, chairman
of the Honor Court, who was
present at the Student Council
meeting Wednesday night, said
the court's chief concern in-
volves not its authority but the
gambling problém that has
arisen on Davidson's campus.

He told THE DAVIDSONIAN.
“We know there is gambling and
something must be done with it.
No eyes are going to be closed
and no backs turned:

He pointed out that the Honor
Court had done nothing to com-
bat ‘this problem yet because
they couldn't go around looking
for specific cases of the prob-
lem. He did say, however, that
the Court did have some names
of students participating already
and that the Honor Court would
act decisively if cases were
brought to them.

Arbuckle said that the whole
problem. began early this year
and “the Honor Court did noth-
ing about it, so it just grew
and grew and grew.” He also
mentioned that the real danger
in gambling was that it might
lead to more serious problems,
such as stealing and drinking on
campus. ‘

He said that THE DAVIDSON-
1AN should be the means by
which the Honor Court gets
through to the Student Body. He
Stated that he plans to use the
newspaper much more in this
capacity.

John Todd Takes |

Journalism Award

THE DAVIDSONIAN held its
annual staff awards banquet in
the private dining room of the
College Union Monday night.

The D. Grier Martin Award
for the best writer on the staff
during the past year was pre-
sented to John Todd. a fresh-
man from Gastonia. Todd, an
Independent, is now serving as
Assignments Editor of the paper
and received the award in rec
ognition of his outstanding work
in handling several extensive
assignments this past year.

Bill Hagen, past editor of
THE DAVIDSONIAN, recogniz-
ed Dave Stitt, past managing
editor and present editor,
Charlie Ramberg, past assign-
ments editor, Charlie Dibble,
former news editor, and Tom
Loflin, feature writer, for out-
standing work during the past
year,

In a speech following the
meal, Hagen commented on THE
DAVIDSONIAN and the power
of the press on the campus.
“The present furor,” stated
Hagen, “does show what power
the press has on present and
future issues. Publicity is pretty
near the jugular vein of a col-
lege.”

In his closing comments Hag-
en pointed out that many per-
sons fail to realize that most of
the issues presented in THE
DAVIDSONIAN are not products
of the paper and staff. He then
commended the new staff for
the work thus shown and turned
the platform over to Stitt who
made several remarks concern-
ing the gravity of the job in the
coming year.

the Student Body Regulations.)

Carrell said that the Honor
Court was originally set to en-
force the Honor Code and Stud-
ent Body Regulations. The Stud-
ent Council, not the Honor
Court. now has the power of in-
terpretation.

Carrell called the Honor
Court a “policeman for the
Student Council and not a
court as such.” Carrell’s
amendment, if passed by the
Student Body, would give the
Honor Court the legal right to
interpret these articles.

Carrell said that the Honor
Court was actually using this
power now. but he pointed out
that there was always a chance
that the Student Council would
override a decision of the: Honor

‘Court, After potnting out that.

this motion had. been defeated
twice by last year's council, Car-
reli called the group “selfish”
for not giving the Honor Court
authority. to interpret what {it is
intended to enforce.

In countering next year's Stud-
ent Body President John Spratt’s
argument that there has never
been a problem of this nature.
Carrell points out the possibili-
ties of one in the future. Carrell
in .ds argument. mentioned that
three areas in the Student Body

‘regulations were particularly

general ones and would need in-
terpretation: gambling. hazing,
and dormitory practices.

Spratt. on the other hand,
does favor a clearing up of the
matter, but feels that the Stud-
ent Council should have the
right to make policy declarations
which the Honor Court must
obey.

He mentioned in particular:
the ambiguity of the word
“campus” which is involved in
these regulations. He pointed
out that @ clarification of this
word might very probably be
needed in an Honor Court
trial, and he considered the
Student Council the body that
should perform this clarifica-
tion.

Carrell's motion was tabled
by the council until the meet-
ing next week.

In other business of the coun-
cil, Spratt said that the commit
tee on gambling was waiting be-
fore taking any action or mak-
ing any decisions until some-
thing was announced or done by
the Honor Court.

Next year's members from the
council to the Student Activities
Committee will be John Spratt,
and sophomores Tom Heffner,
Will Jaekson, and Charlie Mar-
Shall. Walter MacDonald was
named to the Magazine Advisory
Board, and John Barrow will be
Gun Room Manager next year.
Bruce Swain was named’ to the
Foreign Students Committee,
which will also include members
of the Union Board. and the
¥MCA.

John Killian. member of last
year’s council, noted that all
the discussion on the Honor
Court “problem” was done by
himself. Spratt. Carrell, and
Fred. McGuirt. senior member
of the council..He urgéd the new
council to take a more active
part and express their views on

‘all questions before the council.

W. F. Goodykooniz
Resignation Effective Immediatel

FRIDAY. MAY 3. 1863

Twenty-six students marched to the office of Dean of Faculty Frontis W. Johnston
at 3:15 this afternoon only to fail in their attempts to persuade the College to recon-
sider its acceptance of Dr. W. F. Goodykoontz's resignation.

The students, most of whom his resignation was accepted that time

are currently enrolled in classes
under Goodykoontz asked the
dean. to reconsider his Wednes-
day decision which put the con-
troversial professor's resignation
into effect immediately. The
marchers tried to persuade John-
ston to permit Goodykoontz to
continue meeting his classes
through the end of the semester.
_ After a 40-minute discussion
with Johnston, the five students
who presented numerous writ-
ten requests to the dean emerg-
ed from his office to inform
their cohorts that their effort
had been in vain.

Other members of the English
Department began
Goodykoontz's classes yesterday.

This morning Goodykoontz
addressed 350-400 students in
the Morrison Room of the Col-
lege Union Building. Discussion,
which continued for over two
hours, touched on all issues rais-
ed during the controversy.

Goodykoontz told THE DAV-
IDSONIAN late last night
that he would talk to the Gen-

‘eral Counsel of the American

Association of University Pro-
fessors (AAUP) this morning
and ask about “the legal right,
or Jack of it, for the administra-
tion to act in this manner (ac-
cepting his resighation with so
Httle time remaining in the
semester).”
Goodykoontz stated that it

did not really make any differ-
ence to him whether

Duke Fund Endows
Davidson $125,000

Davidson College has received a $125,000 grant from
the trustees of the Duke Endowment Fund, who met here

last Tuesday.

The announcement was made
by R. Grady Rankin of Gastonia,
vice-chairman of the endow-
ment. It will provide $45,000 to
aid in the financing of four
improvement plans of the col-
lege, and the remaining $80,000
will be applied to the cost of
the new wing for the College
Union building.

The $45,000 portion will be
used as follows: $25,000 for
library books and an additional
staff member for one year; $10,-
000 for faculty study and sab-
batical grants: $7,000 to aid in
the operation of the computer
center which students and facul-
ty can use in research; and
$3,000 for the preparation and
equipment of additional faculty
offices.

The College Union addition
will include space for the
student store, and enlarged
recreational area, and, even-
tually, for expanded dining
facilities. The contract has
been swarded and work has
begun on the addition. The
wing will be ready for use
sometime during the 1963-64

academic year.

The remaining $45,000 of the
cost of the addition will be fi-
nanced with funds received
from other sources.

The Duke Endowment Trust-
ees had a full day on the cam-
pus, beginning with a business
session on Tuesday morning.
After their meeting, they were
taken on a tour of the Humani-
ties lecture room and the ad-
ministrative offices.

Before a buffet luncheon,
the group visited the college's
new recreational area on Lake
Norman. At the funcheon Dr.
Frontis W. Johnston, dean of
the faculty, spoke on “‘Chal-
lenges Before Us.”

The late James B. Duke es-
tablished the Duke Endowment
in 1924 to provide financial as-
sistance to colleges and other
nonprofit institutions. Davidson
is one of four educational .in-
stitutions which receive assist-
ance from the endowment.

According to President D.
Grier Martin, the Duke Endow-
ment has been the greatest sin-
gle factor in the financial sup-
port of the college. .

Martin are the members of the
Rush Week Committec.

Olin, Rush Week chairman,
presented two procedural chang-
es to the IFC. The first change
would help to eliminate the con-
fusion as to the confirmation of
dates to fraternity rush parties
during Rush Week.

Olin plans to set up a mas-
ter board, something like a
stock board, with each fresh-
man listed in alphabetical or-
der. Beside each name there
will be spaces for each rush
party during the week. As the
confirmed dates are received,
they will be posted on the
board. The rush chairmen can
at a glance see who is coming
to which party.

Olin commented, “This way
everything will be much smooth-
er, especially for the rush chair-
men. Not only can he see who
is coming, but also whether his
list is complete.”

The second change tries to
end the problem of bids being
lost in the mail. “We plan,”
Olin explained, ‘‘to make the
IFC the middle man, eliminating
the post office. The IFC will
handle all the distribution of
bids.”

To do this Olin proposes that
the IFC have for each freshman
a manila envelope with his name
on it. The fraternities as usual
will put their bids into regular
envelopes and turn them into
the IFC.

At a specified time Saturday
morning, the freshmen would
come to the College Union and
pick up his envelope containing
his bids. All the freshmen would

be given an envelope even if he:

did not receive any bids.

In order to stop any fraterni-
ty from informal rushing Thurs-
day and Friday of orientation,
the council will vote next Mon-
day on a proposal to prevent any
contact between fraternity men
and freshmen before dorm rush
on Saturday. Next week the IFC
will alzo discuss ways of en-
forcing the rules against “dirty
rush” and the “gentleman's
agreement” of the 15 minute

meeting ,

now or at the end of the se-
mester. He did say that he
thought it would do harm to
the students in his classes for
him to leave at the present
time: “It seems to me this
is a petty act on the part of
the administration that shows
their indifference toward the
students.”

Dr. D.-Grier Martin, president
of Davidson College, said: that
the action was taken at this
time “because Dr. Goodykoontz
submitted his resignation.”’ Mar-
tin stated that the resignation
could have been accepted at the
end of the semester but said.
“We did not see fit to do so
(accept the resignation at that
time).”

He also said that he realized
that “there will be both good
effects and bad. effects” on the
students in Goodykoontz's
courses. When asked to elabor-
ate on the good and bad effects,
Martin said, “I am not in a posi-
tion to comment at this time.

‘Goodykoontz offered to re-
Sign from the college on Tues-
day provided that two condi-
tions were met: That “my con-
tract for the year be paid in
full and all Vagabond transpor-
tation and equipment expenses
be paid. in full.” and that, “the
President retract publicly the
false statement about my pay
or pay for all substantial teach-
ing and activity assignments -be-
yond the so-called normal load
that 1 have undertaken sinec 1

Wednesday, Dean Johnston
replied to the offer by a letter
in which he stated that the col-

lege would agree to the first].

condition upon presentation of
vouchers of Vagabond: expenses
and would meet the second con-
dition by paying Goodykoontz an
extra year's salary ($8600). That
letter also included the follow-
ing statements:

“I know that you have often
expended your energies beyond
the call of duty”: and “Since we
will need the rooms in the Fine
Arts Building for the activities
of the Executive Weck-End, we
plan to take down the exhibi-
tions on Friday morning if you
have not. removed them before

Bob Young
To Become
New Dean

Robert C. Young. Davidson
graduate of '61, will serve as the
new Assistant Dean of Students
in the coming year.

According to Dean of Students
Richard C. Burts, Young will be
a regular appointee. That is, he
is not appointed for an interim
period but will hold the job for
an indefinite time.

Young attended Davidson
on a Dana Scholarship and
was @ member of Phi Delta
Theta fraternity. While at
Davidson he was a member of

Cadet Corps Commander and
was named to Who’s Who in
American Colleges and Univer-
sities. At present Young is sta-
tioned in Germany where he is
finishing his term in the Army.

The exhibits mentioned in
the letter were the spark
which set off the controversy
between Goodykoontz and the
administration. Goodykoontz,
with the aid of about a dozen
student volunteers, removed
the exhibits Thursday night.

Goodykoontz admitted that
even though he did not specify
a date for resignation in his
letter, “I did not mean to imply
that I wished to resign immed-
iately.” He sent a letter yester-
day to Johnston stating this fact
which had the following clause:

plete them satisfactorily.

Johnston retused to permit

end of the semester, however.

Faculty Members
Run For City Office

Three members of the David-
son faculty—Professors J. T.
Kimbrough and J. G. Martin,
and Grover C. Meetze—are can-
didates for seats on the David-
son Town Council in the May 7
election.

Kimbrough, the only incum-
bent of the three, is serving his
third term on the council. He is
a professor of mathematics.

Martin, who is a professor of
chemistry, and Meetze, super-

‘| visor of buildings and grounds

for the college, are newcomers
in the commissioners’ race.

All three candidates claim
there is no issue in the election.
Each said he felt that he was
doing his part in helping out
local government.

As one candidate put it, “Any-
body who feels that the power of
the federal government is too
great should take an active part
in local government.”

A $400,000 bond issue will
probably bring out even more
voters. The bonds will be used
to improve the town’s water,
sewer, and electric facilities.
Davidson College has agreed to
assume $100,000 of the debt
which will be incurred.

F. L. Jackson, a Davidson
graduate, is assured of re-elec-
tion as mayor, a post he has
held for nine years. Jackson has
bo opposition.
