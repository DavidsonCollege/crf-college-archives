Baker strengthens
security system

By Martha Knight

Anyone who uses Baker
Sports Complex can now enter only
through the front doors.

Baker administrators recently
installed an alarm system that con-
nects to all back and side entrances
of the building. If one of those
doors opens, the Baker staff can
immediately respond to the situa-
tion. ae

Anyone who admits another
person without authorization is
subject to lose his or her privileges
at Baker for an indefinite amount
of time.

Director of Physical Educa-
tion Ron Morrow describes this

added security as “pro-active rather‘

than reactive.”

Those who use the facilities
have always been required tocome
to the main entrance and present
their identification card to a work-
study student, who then runs it
through a scanning machine that
records their presence in the build-
ing.

However, Morrow says that,
in the past, students and members

of the community knew that they
could also be admitted simply by
knocking ona side door and wait-
ing for someone to open it from the
inside, Some people unknowingly
added to this problem by leaving
doors ajar so that outsiders could
enter at any time.

_ Morrow cites an incident that
occurred two weeks ago, in which
five high-school students who were
denied access at the front desk
went around to another door. An
unidentified Davidson College fe-
male opened the door and allowed
them inside.

Although no harm resulted on
this particular occasion, Morrow
says that problems can arise when
people admit others who may not
be students.

Once inside the complex, un-
known individuals could sustain
injuries for which the school would
be liable. These people might also
use the opportunity to steal from
the locker rooms at times when
athletic teams are practicing or
participating in games.

Baker require the staff to enter
dark rooms late at night in order to
lock up the facilities. The new
security system ensures that work-
ers know who is in the building at
all times and do not fear for their
safety.

Morrow believes that these
measures serve the same purpose
as the coded locks on the dormito-
ries and on the Visual Arts Center.

F.L.A.G. forum to promote openness

By Mary Laura Moretz
Gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and
“straights” willing to be honest
and open about their sexuality will
serve as the panel for the third
annual Exploring Sexuality Forum.
The forum, sponsored by
F.L.A.G., Committee for Women’s
Issues, and SHOC, will kick off
the third week of National
Women’s History Month at 8 p.m.
on March 14 in the 900 room.
Meg Jones, moderator for the
forum, aims to “make a healthy
environment for discussion where
sex is concerned.”
Jones will begin the program

by asking three questions which
each panel member will answer.
The forum will then open for both
anonymous and open questions
from the audience.

According to Jones, F.L.A.G.
encourages such open discussion
in an effort to “make people more
sensitive to the issue of sexuality.”
Jones says, “Being gay at Davidson
was really hellish a few years ago.
We hope to change that.”

The forum will be held during
Women’s History Month during
which the Committee for Women’s
Issues supports educational pro-
grams on issues of gender and sexu-

Late start on Christmas
break not to happen again

Break continued from page I

In it, he will propose that the break
dates never go past December 20.

Dr. Sandy McKelway, secre-
tary of the Executive Committee,
is still unsure that students would
prefer to begin school earlier in
Augustin order to ensure an earlier
Christmas break.

Jennifer Humphrey, chair of
the Council on Academic Affairs,
suggests that some sort of student
poll be taken in order to see how
students feel about this issue. She
feels that students would most
likely prefer to return earlier.
Humphrey says that the decision
to institute Sunday exams was “the
best that they could do for next
year.” f

As a hall counselor, Wendy
McHugh was obligated to stay at
Davidson until December 23. She

feels that student opinion would

definitely lean towards an earlier
start. “I think people would much
rather start earlier sothat we can go
back early,” she said.

McKelway is still struggling
with the issue and its complica-
tions.

He says that the faculty would
definitely not want to start earlier
and would always want school to
start on a Monday.

If school started an entire
week earlier, he feels it would cut
into many people’s summer plans.

Hesays, though, that what hap-
pened this year at Christmas Break
will never happen again. Classes
will resume earlier in August be-
fore break reaches dates so close to
Christmas. Right now, the calen-
dar is moving back one day each
year, but eventually the dates will
move forward again.

aimed specifically towards women.

. More than half of the panel is
male, and Jones expects a good
mix of men and women in the
audience.

nience the students. We want to
make Baker more secure for stu-
dents, faculty, and staff,” he says.

The new system affects many
athletes, particularly members of
the soccer, lacrosse, and field
hockey teams, which practice on
fields behind Baker.

Sophomore lacrosse player
Jennifer Lake says that it takes
more time to reach the training
room, which is located on the
ground floor at the back of Baker.

“It is very frustrating to run
from the back to the front and
down and up stairs when you need

to see the trainer during practice,”
she said.

Lake also feels that it would
be helpful to make changes that
would allow athletes to exit through
the side doors of Baker after prac-
tice yet still prevent others from
entering.

The training room staff be-
lieves that the administration has
compensated by providing all
coaches and Baker employees with
private codes that will disarm the
alarm when it becomes necessary
to use an entrance other than the
front door.
