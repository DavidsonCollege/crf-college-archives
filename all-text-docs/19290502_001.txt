MacDougall Discusses

History Of

Psychology

During Lecture Friday

Apollinian and Dionysian Views
of Psychology Taken Up

TWO PRINCIPAL SCHOOLS

Terms of Subject Explained—In-
tellect and Nature Studied
from Different Angles

Dr. William MacDougall spoke last
Friday night before a large crowd of
students, faculty and other
townspeople. The subject of his speech
ran chiefly along the line of the history
of Psychology, and its steady advance.
He states that there are two views which
scholars have taken toward this subject
—namely, the Apollinian and Dionysian

members,

views.

The speaker further stated that Psy-
chology as a whole has been somewhat
neglected, and because of this, several
new volumes. have been written. The
question that arose in the minds of the
Psychologists of old was “What is the
nature of man?”

The Apollinian view is an intellectual
view, which regards man as a reasonable
being, and which consists of the same
components as other bodies with the ex-
ception of the soul. On the other hand
the Dionysian view is not so easily de-
fined; it recognizes much in nature which
we cannot understand. —

Those of the Apollinian view believe
that nature is rational—man is a creature
of vague impulses, of which he has very
little knowledge. In the rivalry between
two ways of thinking, the Apollinian yiew
has always in favor, being both
mechanical and rational. This favorable
view knew how to deal with facts of
motivation, hence condemns itself to prob-
lems of science, which furnishes pursuits
for amateurs. This fact exposes a defect
in this mode of thinking. France and
Italy adopted this view toward Psychol-
ogy. It is objective study of human na-
ture, making an assumption that man is
a machine and nothing more—a mechani-
cal system.

been

Those taking the Dinoysian view do
not claim to understand man through and
through, but only observe man in his
outward impulse; that is, something un-
derlies his actions. In the middle of the
Nineteenth Century, the Dionysian view
began in full force, which was more pro-
ductive and which brought Psychology
to the supreme test. This is the Ameri-
can way of thinking.

SEVERAL CHANGES
MADE IN FACULTY

There will be few new members of the
faculty for the session of 1929-30. Two
members of the present faculty will spend
next year in study. Professor Gorr will
do graduate work at the University of
Pennsylvania and Professor Blythe has
a leave of absence for a trip to Spain.

James Truesdale will take Professor
Gorr’s place in the Greek and German
Departments, having been an exceptional-
ly good student in these subjects at Duke
University where he graduated last year
with a, Bachelor of Arts degree. He is
taking his Master of Arts degree at Duke
this year. Truesdale was Phi Beta: Kappa,
Omicron Delta Kappa and one of Duke's
candidates for a Rhodes Scholarship. He
was editor of the college annual and solo-
ist in the glee club last year. He is a
member of the Sigma Phi. Epsilon frater-
nity.

W. R. Weaver, a present senior here,
will take Professor Blythe’s place for one
year. He will study at the “Middlebury
College in Vermont this summer in pre-
paration for his new duties. Weaver has
been an exceptionally good student during
his four years here in Davidson, especial-
ly in Spanish. He has been an Honor Stu-
dent several times and is at, present a
Student Assistant in Spanish. He is from
Hickory, N. C., and is a member ‘of the
following organizations: Spanish Club,
Reporters Club, and the Theta Upsilon
Omega ‘social fraternity.

Professor Schenck who has been on
leave of absence this year will return
next year to take his place as Professor
of Bible.

Fraternities
Re-opened

Notwithstanding the fact that
all the fraternity halls were re-
cently closed to ladies by regu-
lation of the faculty, Dr. M. E.
Sentelle, dean of the college, has
permitted a reopening of the
halls for Sunday, May 12, so that
exercises, in observance of
Mother’s Day, may be held dur-
ing the afternoon. The halls will
be opened after the morning
church service until about seven
thirty o’clock Sunday night, and
a large number of mothers are
expected to be at Davidson on
that day.

be contented with wearing the ordinary

in general there were in addition to the
self-appointed supporters of the law an
officer for every hall. All upperclassmen
were instructed to refrain from running
errands for the unfortunate rats, although
they were not allowed to go into the drug
store or picture show until atter supper.
There is no rule against an upperclass-
man’s attending the picture

Reports from Atlanta that G. F. (Red)
Laird had been secured by Davidson Col-
lege athletic authorities as an additional
member of the coaching staff here were
verified by Capt. Norton G. Pritchett,
athletic director of Davidson, who stated
that the former Davidson athlete had
been secured as a special assistant to
Coach Younger “with a view to working
out a more definite policy in relation to
intercollegiate and intramural — sports.”
Captain Pritchett added that Laird would
he assigned to coach several of the fresh-
man athletic teams.

The Davidson director also stated that
it is a later intention of the department
of physical education to inaugurate a sys-
tematic course in physical development of
those not taking part in collegiate. sports,
and because of the well-rounded develop-
ment of Laird in three major sports, it
was believed he will be the logical man
to assist the authorities in this develop-
ment.

“Red” Laird is a name well-known in
North Carolina circles. For four years
he represented Davidson College on the
gridiron, basketball court and diamond
and while a sophomore here was voted
the best all-round athlete and awarded the
Norris Trophy Cup. He coached the Ca-

has been with the University School for
Boys in Atlanta during the past season.

Vitaphone Picture
Shown in Davidson

The owners of the Davidson Theatre
were hosts to the students and people of
Davidson on Monday afternoon at the
first all-talking movie ever shown in
Davidson. The picture shown was “The
Trial of Mary Dugan.”

Only very few parts of the dialogue
were not clear and on a whole the picture
was a‘ success. The object of the show
was to get the students’ opinion on talkies.
Unless it is the will of the students to
have sound pictures the vitaphone equip-
ment will be sent back to the manufac-
turer. If talking pictures are continued
to be shown the price of admittance will

the prevailing mood is liveliness.

Almost half of the pages are devoted
to poetry. In the special poetic section
the leading contributors to the magazine
for the past year are characterized in a
series of epigrammatic verses worthy of
the divine Dorothy herself. The gay
note runs through many of the other
lyrics; some are good, some not so good.
One of the best, Dreams, is spoiled by one
poor line and a false rhyme. There is
considerable variety of mood and rhythm
in the lyrics, though the verb, to dream,

mental companions as presenting serious
thought in compressed form,

Of the sonnets, Worship is by all odds
the best, though the sequence of four con-
tains some striking lines.

Philan’s: Quest, a Jong poem in blank
verse, deserves its position in the first
six pages of the magazine. It contains
some of the best poetry written at David-
son in many a day. There is nothing
amateurish in either conception or execu-
tion, The-thought moves logically from
beginning to end, The blank verse is
varied in movement, and the thought runs
easily from line to line. The language is,
in the main, dignified and sonorous, but
changes with the mood of the peom to
include modern scientific terms and collo-
quial expressions. To weave “pithecan-
thropus” and “streptococcus” into blank
verse requires skill. The two lyrics,
though they serve well to break the long
succession of blank verse lines are not
so good as the other parts of the poem.
Though the tone of the poem is serious,
its rapidity of movement gives a liveli-
ness, Which, as-has been said is the key-
note of the whole magazine.

The three short stories are hardly so
good as the verse. The Battle of Martini
is a lively war story, based on an. ori-
ginal theme. The idea is better than
the exectition. The Forbidden City con
tains some good descriptive touches; in
fact, the descriptive passages are much
better than the narrative, though both are
lively enough. The most startling detail
of this series of startling episodes is the
fact that the baby, when discovered, is
only five hours old. The Means and the
End has a good basic idea, but its devel

opment and its general style could be
improved,

The two most serious faults of the
magazine are its total lack of essays

(though the wealth of verse may com-
pensate for this) and the large number
of typographical errors.

To Be Held On Lawn

On Sunday, May 5, the first open air
“Y" vesper service of the year will be
held. If the weather permits the re-
maining services of the year will be held
out of doors, except the Mother's Day
program. These meetings are to be con-
ducted just to the rear of the Y. M. C. A.

The rising Junior class is in charge
of the vespers on May 5. No definite
program has been announced, but a very
interesting one has been planned accord-
ing to the President of the class, C. H.
Goodykoontz. There will be several musi-
cal selections rendered by the townspeo-
ple and members of the student body.
Also a number of responsive readings will
be on the program. There will be no
speaker,

The Freshman class will conduct the
services on May 19, while the Sophomore
class will be tn charge for the final vesper
service of the school year.

Each year when the weather becomes

warm and the attendance begins to drop
the “Y” service is held out under the
campus elms. This has in past years in-
creased the attendance almost a hundred
per cent and it is hoped “that this year
will bring the same result.”

Doctor Richards, Davidson Bible pro-

was “the Somewhat savage onset of in-
telligence upon the stronghold of char-

he emphasized the following points :

Personality is one of the component
parts which go to make up leadership.
For a long time, there has been a grow-
ing hostility arising between the forces
of character and intelligence. The mod-

Professor Harde is a native French-
man from Turenne. He has been in this
country for some time, as fie taught at
Middlebury College, Vt., before he took
his professorship at N. C. C. W. This
was not his first appearance at Davidson;
he spoke here last year also in French on
the subject of French boarding schools.

His address was not a scientific descrip-

Penick said faith was
under two in the Bible;
objective faith and subjective faith. The
former relates to what God has done for
man. It what we refer to when we
speak of the “Christian Faith.” At present
we are thinking of the later or subjective
faith. It to what God
has done for us. One of the best defini-
tions of faith is that of the Mystic Shrine.
“Faith,” he says, “is the response of the
whole personality to one’s spiritual en-
vironment.” “Whole” the important
word in this definition.

Man is a thinking being yet reason

The tendrils of the soul reach out and
apprehend things which escape the intel-

personality. It is the citadel of the soul
