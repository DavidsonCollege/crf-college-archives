THE DAVIDSONIAN, OCTOBER 26, 1922 :

CHONG’S LETTER

Daivdson College,
October 23, 1922.
Dear Joe:

That fighting Wildcat team stuck
with ’em Saturday and it took the
Gobblers 16 minutes of hard labor to
carry the oval across. ‘Then in three
minutes the Wildcats undid all the
hard work of the Gobblers by tying up
the count.

When Baker, Gettle, Sherertz and
Tex Tilson not to mention the seven
other near, pygmies ambled on Sprunt
Field it looked like 21 points was
about the least possible score.

Why, Joe, if you packed the Gob-
blers on one side of the scales and
tossed. the Wildcats in on the other side
and then added in a second Sam Davis,
the Gobblers would still be the heav-
iest. Gettle could give away about 30
pounds to any man in the Wildcat
backfield and when you think of Baker
and Sherertz up in the two century
class you know what beef the Wildcats
was up against.

It was Home-Coming Day and there
was about 3,000 out to see the Tech-
men scrap the Presbyterians. Doc
LaFar and Rooster: McFadden were
out to see what kind of a showing
their successors would make and those
successors did themselves proud. You
see theWildcats hadn’t been licked on
Sprunt Field in 10 years and this was
just about the toughest team they’d

Nappy allowed 20 yards gain around his

flank Saturday, but inflicted 22 yards loss on

the Gobbler backs. -Two yards sounds
good, ch!

ever go up against anywhere.

You’ve often heard how a strong
offense is the best defense. Well, the
Red and Black scrappers are noted for
always reversing something and they

it in the scrap pile. They made the
statement go that the best offense is a
strong defense and they worked it out
so well that V. P. I. missed beating us
21 points by a margin of exactly 21
counters. Red Laird grabbed a V. P.
I. pass and raced down the field. Well
there were two V. P. I. fellows and
‘Lias Faison just behind him and
about the time ‘that one of ’em almost
had him ’Lias cut ’em both down and
Flake finished the remainder of the 75
yards in safety. Everybody on that
field was yelling themselves hoarse
about that time and there was more
joy registered on Sprunt Field than
has been done in several years.

Well everything got quiet sudden
when Flake put his toe into the ball on
the place-kick. The ball wert low and
then Baker threw up his hands and the
ball hit them and sailed over the bar
for the tying point. Two or three
more plays had been run before the
stands even started to stop yelling.

The last of the quarter the Gobblers
didn’t have much show. Nappy Davis
snatched a 25-yard pass that put the
pigskin on Tech’s 10-yard line. Then
on the fourth down with four to go
Laird grabbed a pass but went out of
bounds on the 2-foot line.

The Red and. Black warriors threw
a big scare into the Gobbler camp in
the second quarter when Jim Hendrix

On Thursday, October 19th,
Mrs. Moore, mother of *Captain
Moore of the football team, wife
of a former football player and
an old friend of Davidson Col-
lege, presented to the men of the
football squad two baskets of
fruit. She talked to the men,
assuring them of her interest in
Davidson athletics, and of the
interest of all the old friends of
the college.

Wearing a Davidson sweater,
adorned with the D*** won by
Doctor Moore ween he was a
student at the college, she typi-
fied the spirit of the alumni of
Davidson, ‘This spirit of interest
shown by the alumni was no un-
important factor in the victory
won on Sprunt Field Saturday.

JUNIORS DEFEATED BY
SOPHS IN FIRST GAME

The Sophomores got off to a flying
start in the race for the class basket-
ball championship by defeating the
Juniors, 39-5, in the first game of the
series. The Juniors were outclassed
from the start, due mainly to the lack
of team play, while the Sophs showed
the results of practice and careful
coaching. ‘That the work of the guards
was especially good is shown by the
fact that the Juniors failed to make a
field goal. The half ended, 23-3 in
favor of the underclassmen.

At first the game looked as though it
was going to be a close affair, Mc-
Bryde and Staley each registering a
pair of foul shots. The Sophs seemed
to come to life at this point, and started
their perfect team work. Before the
half ended they hung up 12 field goals
and Staley tossed a foul shot to match
the one thrown by McBryde.

The Sophs came back with a rush
in the second half and swept the
Juniors off their feet. They added 13
markers to their total before the
Juniors stopped them. Substitutions
were then made on both eteams and
the rest of the game was fought on
even terms,

Teamwork was the real reason for
the Soph’s victory, but the sensational
shooting of Mitchell and the close
guarding of Morrison and Koring de-
serve special mention,. The Juniors
fought hard but failed to show their
class. Elkins and McBryde put up the
best game for them.

P. C. FRESH WIN BY
- SEVEN-POINT MARGIN

For the first time in its history. Da-
vidson College was represented in a
football arena by a Freshman squad.
Last Thursday afternoon the fur of
the future Wildcats and fuzz of the
future Blue Stockings were mixed in-
discriminatingly in Rock Hill, where
the latter won a 7-0 victory.

teen ‘round any end,” is the statement heard
in the V. P. I. dressing room after Satur-
day’s game.

ians were going to be swept off their
feet before they «could become ac-
quainted with their new surroundings.
But the march of the South Carolina
Calvanists was brought to a halt on the
North Carolina five-yard line, and
there they were held for downs. From
this time on, the Wildkittens showed
their Jaws and ripped the lines of the
Blue Stockings for the rest of the
game.

In the second period the wear and
tear of the, first quarter told on the
boys from Clinton and Davidson
rushed the ball to P. C.’s one-yard line.
But here the Wildkittens took their
turn and were held for downs. ° Thus
the first half ended in a scoreless tie.

The third quarter opened with both
teams determined to score. The Blue
Stockings tock the ball on the 50-yard
line and there by lightning like speed
of Clinton's end runs, the ball was
placed on Davidson's 30-yard line. He,
Clinton, again starred for P. C. and
after receiving a 10-yard pass, took
the remaining 20 yards by a pretty
piece of broken field running, Cope-
land-added the extra point. This ended
the scoring for the day. The David-
sonians threatened again in the last
but were unable to put the oval over
the last white line before the final
whistle,

It was a hard fought, fast, clean
game throughout. The team work of
both aggregations was commendable.
The work of Baker and Creighton,on
the wings for Davidson looked mighty
good, while the speed of Sappenfield
and the punting of Black, who aver-
aged 40 yards, placed the ball in enemy
territory on more than one occasion.
The line held like a stone wall with
Doughton and Vance shining at the
tackle positions.

DIXIE DOPE

Trinity’s loss to William and Mary
while Davidsgn fought the V, P. I.
eleven to a 7-7 tie swings most of the
comparative scores on the Davidson-
Trinity game in favor of the Wildcats.
Trinity beat Hampden-Sydney, 28-0,
while V. P. I. beat them, 38-0, giving
the Red and Black a 10-point margin,
and Va, Tech beat William and Mary,
20-6 and they in turn beat Trinity,
giving us a margin of 21 points. On
the other hand Carolina beat Wake
Forest, 62-3 and Trinity only 21-0.
Working by way of our tie with the
Baptists, Trinity will beat us 38-0.
After all it is in the fight and if the
Wildcats go after Trinity like they
went after the Virginians, look out
Methodists.

States showing against Carolina was
somewhat of a surprise and means that
Davidson has two hard games instead
of one before she can take off any
championship honors. When we con-
sider that Washington and Lee only
beat State, 14-6, and last Saturday tied
West Virginia the conquerers of Pitts-
burgh, Ga. Tech’s old rival it makes
the task look harder than ever before.

Carolina by virtue of their victory
over State still stands out the fore-
most for the State championship. The
rest of the teams line up somewhat as

follows. The games won and lost are
contests within the State while the
points include all games played.

Furman showed a powerful drive
and endurance last week when they ,
crushed Citadel, 28-0 Thursday, and
then journeyed down to Atlanta and
beat Oglethorpe, 26-0 Saturday. Tech
and Furman both beat Oglethorpe by
four touchdowns, but the Golden Tor-
nado didn’t play the Thursday before.
It looks bad for the Wildcats but Da-
vidson can win out if they go South
with blood in their eyes and fight from
start to finish.

Only one major Southern team has
gone through the season so far without
being scored upon. Tulane has pre-
sented an impregnable defense to the
opposition while their backs have ac-
cumulated 78 points. Among, the
class B teams Chattanooga has man-
aged to keep her goal line free from
the invader,

By swamping Mercer Saturday
Auburn has swung into the lead as the
South’s best offensive team. The
other leaders are:

Auburn—208, opponents 32, lost 1.

Centre—169, opponents 30, lost 1.

Alabama—163, opponents 40, lost 1.

Georgia—137, opponents 36, lost 1.

Washington and ‘Lee—124, oppo-
nents 25, undefeated. :

All of these teams seem to have dif-
ficulty with their defense-though in
most cases an unfortunate Northern
invasion accounts for. the majority of
the points for the opposition. ~ Al-
though Alabama has 163 points to her
credit her defeat by Tech and tie by
Sewanee puts her decisely out of the
Southern race.

The leading scorer of the country is
not an A-1 team, however. Kings Col-
lege by virtue of her 206-0 rout of
Lenoir run her total’well above 300 to
27 for the opposition. V. P. I. de-
feated them, 25-6 at Blacksburg,

_ It is early yet to pick out the stand-
ing of teams in the race for Southern
honors but if games to date are any

indication of comparative strength it
