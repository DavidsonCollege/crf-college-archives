Narrow @Ninds :...

Students are careless. Not just David-
son students, perhaps, but all students.
Not just about material things, either, but
often-about things which can and often do
cause much more serious and irreparable
damage.

We refer to the way in which we often
laugh and joke about a boy who in some
Way we may consider queer, possibly be-
cause he is physically different from us or
more often hecause he holds some ditter-
ence in ideas from our mean, narroyy-mind-
ed average.

Did it ever occur to any of us as we
snickered behind our cynical hands that
perhaps it is not the individual with whom
we make such sport that is a little peculiar
When we accuse someone of being differ-
ent would we not do well to consider
whether it might not be better if all-of as
would deviate from the crowd a little our-
selves ?

We live inva, limited, well-ordered: socie-
ty, associating with the same elite group
of friends constantly. until we talk, act,
dress, and even look like the entire gré up.
Then we glance at the outsiders and laugh
at them because they do not use the same
slang, the same mannerisms, the same slop-
py habits that the “fellers” have acquired.

If a boy is different, that is all the more
reason that.as Davidson or any other kind
of gentlemen we should do all in our pow-
er to.help him, not to make him miserable,
lor this reason more good boys than we
would care to admit have been driven away
from this campus on whose democracy and
friendship we like to brag,

But we are not as cruel to these boys as
we are to g0me of the more unfair cases
who we “cut” largely from hearsay. These
are the ones whom we never bother to get
to know because one of our clique once
made a careless remark about some chance
word or action the person in question
might or might not have said or doit.

It_all -boils down to the fact that alarge
part of the student body is narrow-minded,
not perhaps in the usual connotation of the
term, but then there is more than one way

fare we to judge?

Probably the most common form ot
narrowness which we are likely to ‘encoun-
}ter among students is intolerance of intol-
erance, \ belief that another student does
not approve of what we approve of, a con-

| dition for which a number of names have

heen devised, will cause inimediate place-
ment on the “list” to’ which there is so
much reference

The most common criticism of Dayidson
}as an institution by its students deals
ivaguely with its “prep-schoolishness”,
whatever that means. We can think of no
more juvenile attitude than that under dis-
cussion,

The point, it seems, is obvious. Who
Have we the right to
make the lives of clags and college mates
unhappy beause of some real or fancied
queerness in their lives?— The answer 1s
equally obvious.

Letters To The
Editor....

Dear Editor :

In recent months there has been some
talk amoung students as to the ineffective-
ness of chapel music. The chapel period
should be atime of relaxation but it should
be principally one with an air cf quietness
and devotion as you would feel in a great
cathedral scemingly closed off from the
hustle and bustle of the day.

I believe that this could be more ef feet-
ively brought about—by—a—change—in—the
chapel music. The preludes are almost al-
ways unfamiliar pieces which are appre-
ciated by only a few. Many of the students
are not musically minded and cannot appre
ciate the music as much as the more fami-
liar. Few enjoy listening to preludes of
Bach and Beethoven but pieces as Debus-
sey's “Clair de Lune,” Handel's “Largo”
Widor'’s *Poceata,” Tschaikowsky’s “An-
dante Cantable”; Dvorak’s “Largo” from
the New World Symphony: excerpts from
the “Nuteracker Suite” and numerous oth-
ers are more tanuliar works, Phese tium-
bers are just as appropriate for chapel pre-

THE LAST WEEK-END
By Walter Boyd

It was three in the morning, yet
our unsuspecting Cam was
still tossing about his bed desperate-

pear on the morrow.

The next morning, between the in-
termittent snores of his ‘roommate,
were heard strange bits Of versatile
phrases not common in the diction-
ary. Cam was still dreaming about
last night.

Cam awakes with a start, looks
at his watch and hastily begins
dressing—slipping quietly into his
prize possessions—his grey flannel
pants with the blue overall straps
neatly sewed on with greenthread
And old straw hat, White T shirt
and track shoes complete his para-
phenalia.

He lights a cigarette, pulls his hat
down low over his eyes and trudges
through the drizzling rain toward
the battered walls of Rumple.

He had scarcely crawled through
the hole ‘which served as an en-
trance, when he was accosted by a
large bewhiskered beast. “My gosh,

what are you?” (Had not Cam fail-

ed his biology exam last semester,

seeking its comforting heat.

Cam called forth her delicate ap-

pelation in his rasping voice,

"Bobbieee”’.

In a few minutes, which seemed
like hours, with a flourish of her
skirts she came grandly down the
stairs, tripping on the missing third
step and collasping in a gruesome
heap at the bottom. Cam gently pick-
ed her up, saying that they would
surely have to repair that step if
the college was going to use Rum-
ple for ten more years: They went
out hand-in-hand, toward the Sigma
Chi house, making a handsome
couple.

Cam was struggling with his crim-
son bow tie and it was already 8 :30.
“Curses this Bugs-Bunny— uni-
form”, murmured as he found
the tie stood virtically. He finally
got this straight and slipped into his
pleated brown overcoat; sucking
jovially on his cigarette holder he
started out again in the rain toward
Rumple. To his surprise she was_al-_
ready waiting, looking as a vision
of .untouched beauty in her pink
strapless evening gown, which so
elegantly matched her orange carna-

They exchanged compliments and
left for the dance, leaping over the
mud-puddles arm-in-arm. The music
was soft and slow tonight—again
Cam danced with Bobbie the whole
night. While dancing he suddenly
got a sickening feeling in the pit of
his stomach as if something were
pushing against it. “I must be in
love,” thought Cam, as he looked
into her limpid brown pools. Then
looking down he realized that it
wasn't love, but a stay that had
come loose in her corset.

Intermission was the same as before
She threw herself at him with such
vivacity that he was forced to rest
between struggles.

Back to the dance and then that
tender goodnight scene. He was
cautious this time and eluded her
grasp, shouting “Good-night, Bob-
bie,” over shoulder as he raced for
the safety of the dorm.

Comes Sunday morning and Cam
awakes with a song 6n his lips and
joy in his heart. Bobbie will leave
and it all will be a bad dream. After
a sprinkling of powder to cover the
5 o'clock shadow, he hurries up to
Rumple to wind up his affairs. Bob-
bie ambles down the stairs looking
even more “Zombilical” in the dawn
than he had tried to forget. With
her billfold in hand she pays the ex-
orbitant prcie of three dollars for
her “Week-end at Rumpfe”,

After getting all of the luggage to-
gether, Cam performs the — final
duties of a Davidson gentlemen and
tells her how much he hates to see
her go. (Don’t be hasty in drawing
your conclusion, it isn’t always so
