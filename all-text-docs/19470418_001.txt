INSPECTION

The annual War Department
Board inspection of Davidson's
R. O. T. C. unit will be held on
the eighth and ninth of May.
The Board will consist of three
field officers headed by Colonel
James W. Coutts.

The differences from _inspec-
tions of previous years will be
that it is consuming two days
instead of one as heretofore. In
order for the unit to receive the
rating of excellent, which the
college has received since 1928,
it must make a grade ten points
higher since the War Depart-
ment raised the grading scale.
The inspection will cover the
four classes’ work, and will con-
clude with paraile and review.

On Tuesday, April 8th, members
of the “D” Club gathered to attend
to all pressing matters that had
accumulated since the last meeting.

One of the important accomplish-
ments of the meeting was an addi-
tion to! the constitution which pro-
vided for the appointment of a
Publicity Committee whose func-
tion will be to furnish the David-
sonian a constant source of news
concerning the latest activities of
the club. " Due to the increased
price of gold “D” charms, initia-
tion dues were raised from $4.00 to’
$4.50; and a recommendation was
made to the Athletic Department
to the effect that the seven sports,
Football, Basketball, Track, , Base-
ball, Golf, Tennis, and Wrestling,
all be placed on the same basis as
far as awards are concerned. This
means that anyone earning a let-

ter in» one of these sports will be

awarded a black “D” sweater. At

voted that only seniors are in the
future to wear or to receive white

ing records in that sport this year:

Stroupe, Rufus Long, Phil Cox,
M. E. Price, W. M. Alexander, Dick

After all regular business had

presentation were made, after
which the meeting was concluded.
