Students shirkKWDAV’s classical quota

Davidson College's admini-
stration has ordered its campus
radio station to play more
classical music, and the student
volunteers who run the station
are upset.

The 18,500-watt station,
WDAV (89.9 FM), which

broadcasts from 7 a.m. to 1

a.m. every day, already devotes
about a third of its program-
ming to classical music. Dr.
Sam Spencer, Davidson's presi-
dent, has ordered that increased
to 50 per cent on Nov. 15.

WDAY’s student staff, a
group of about 60, objects. Led
by elected General Manager
Carrington Thompson, the staf-
fers claim the extra classical
music will come at the expense
of other programming, which
includes rock, folk, jazz and
educational broadcasts.

And, Thompson adds, people
in the administration are wrong
if they think the students are
upset purely because they don’t
want classical to bump some of
their beloved rock ’n’ roll off the
air. ““We’re not seeing it as rock
vs. classical: We’re seeing it as
rock vs. everything else,” he
said Thursday.

Editorial from The Charlotte
Observer
September 18, 1978

Suddenly, the question for
noncommercial, or public, radio
in Charlotte has become not
whether, but what kinds. The
Charlotte area is going from
getting no noncommercial FM
signals to three (four, if you are
able to pick UNC’s Chapel Hill
transmitter, which has just
doubled its power to 100,000
watts). The trick will be for
those noncommercial voices to
stake out different sorts of
programming.

WDAYV, the Davidson Col-
lege station, has been broadcas-
tingan 18,500 watt signal since
May. WPRV, the state-owned
South Carolina station in Rock
Hill, added its 100,000 watt
signal in July. Now WFAE, the
10 watt UNCC station, will get
the federal money to buy the

equipment to become a 100,000

watt station.
WFAE station manager Rob-
ert Pittman hopes to be on the
air by next June. What kind of
noncommercial broadcasting
mix will the stations make?
South Carolina’s contribution
is likely to be distinctly second-
ary. Its Rock Hill station
simply passes on Columbia's
programming. During the
sachodl year, except during va-
cations, it broadcasts instruc-
tional programming during the
day,

io sevideon and UNCC are the

core for this region, and the two
schools ought to be thinking
about how their efforts can
complement one another. That

won't be easy, because stu-.

dents, faculty, staff and com-
munity all need a say in what
goes on the gir.

Davidson, for instance, is
under instructions from its
trustees to develop -into a
fine-arts station. Some of the
student broadcasters, however,
would rather play more rock
music, offering more of what is
found already on commercial
stations.

It is a dilemma for Davidson.
The school’s hope of building
community support for its sta-
tion is unlikely to succeed
unless WDAV has a specific
identification. If the identifica-
tion is rock, who needs it?

At UNCC, WFAE is hoping
to be three things: a public
radio station sérving the com-
munity, a “‘public relations tool
for the university,”’ in manager
Pittman’s phrase, and a train-
ing ground for student broad-
casters. That is a much larger
concept than Davidson’s plan
for a fine-arte station from a
much larger institution than
Davidson. But it is no more
than a concept.

As the two schools translate
those concepts iito practice,
they ought to be talking with
one another. The result should
be more variety, and thet is

much of the promise of noncom-:

mercial radio.

pledged: to make the radio
station more heavily classical
than it already is. .

After researching paperwork
college officials submitted to
the Federal Communications
Commission two years ago in an
effort to win the power increse,
Thompson concludes: “‘We cur-
rently are playing more classical
music than they ever proposed
to the commission.”

Thompson and his staff,
whose position ia supported by
the college’s student newspa-
per, The Davidsonian, plan to
meet with the board of trustees

or November.

me’, hope to persuade the

trustees to reduce the 60 per

,cent_ requirement, or at least

pledge not to order still. more

On one hand, the school’s
radio station must serve its own
students; indeed it depends on
them to stay on the air.
Classical music undoubtedly is

not big with most students. ©

Then again, in boosting its
power, WDAV also serves the
general community, where clas-
sical music has traditionally
been in short supply.

FREEDOM NEEDED

Then there’s the complicating
question of student freedom,
which good colleges, including

Davidson, generally encourage.

Just as student newspaper staf-
fers should be reasonably free to
produce their publications, stu-
dent broadcasters should enjoy
maximum freedom to run their
radio stations. Balancing stu-
dent freedom with the needs
and goals of a college is often
