Greetings, IMAC followers, ~

it’s great to be back. Last ‘week
there: was no. IMAC column in
this publication. We’te very
sorry. Oh, it’s not that we
didn’t write one. We did. Our
editor simply refused to print
it. Why? We were told it was

‘because the article was in poor

taste and did not reflect kindly
upon Ronald Reagan. That's. a
pity. He’s such a good guy—
didn’t you.root:-for the National
Guard at Kent State? We were
for the Vietnam War all the

- way. Still think it had its

redeeming features.

Anyway, they didn’t. print-

the article last week. Some of it

some of it usually is. Hell, they-

print. a lot of the really nasty

~ stuff, -but one: never really ~

knows what they’ll edit or what
they'll leave in. They're pretty
consistent. Now we can see why
they cut the part we wrote last

availability. More than a dozen
members of ATO talked with
the Trustees after the meal on a
serious level for an hour, after
which they excused themselves
because of other commitments.
John, on the. other hand, left
immediately after finishing his
meal without talking to the
Trustees.

It is unfortunate that such a
trivial incident has attracted so
much attention. Certainly there
are issues on this campus much
more deserving of our concern.
ATO would like to thank the
Trustees, Dr. Ivan Hoy and
Mr. and Mrs. Graeme Keith,
for taking the time to discuss
some of these issues with us.

Friday is the last day before they go up

year about Richie D.’s*physical
attributes (it had to do with
pole vaulting) and this year’s
analysis of. the nicknames in-
volved in the Southern Cal-
South Carolina game (look up
those nicknames — it’s pretty
funny). That stuff was rather
explicit, but if you had taken
three or four sentences out of
last’ week’s article, you could
have printed it'in The Christian
Science Monitor. 7

We probably wouldn’t have
taken the time to lodge our
protest, but alot. of people were

upset. about the absence of the |
IMAC column last week. Some .

had tears in their eyes,, especial-
ly Sam.-He thought that article
about I.M. Oblivious was hilar-

dous: It reminded ~him -of- ao
college president he used to: ~
know (I think the guy was

president of Williams). A lot of —

other people were upset, too,
including Bob B., Ports, Eva S.
Vince, Touchdown, X, Gay
Bear; Minor, and about every-
body else that we like. Joby had
forgotten about it. It’s not that
those people didn’t enjoy the
rest of the paper; most everyone
we talked to liked the Rely
picture on the front page, and a
couple of the Trustees who were
once sort of shaky in their
support of coeducation think its
just super now. The only thing
that was missing besides the
IMAC column was another
thought-provoking picture of
that new police vehicle. Maybe
it’ll be back in next week.

Now, we figured that some
people might not care whether
or not there was an IMAC
article so we had a poll taken in
order to get a feel for the
article’s support and impor-
tance. This poll was done by the
United States Underwriters for
Research Propagation (U.S.U.-
R.P.) and cost us just under
$2000. Here are the questions
and results:

1. Which article in The Dav-
idsonian do you read first?

In flickerball this week there
were a host of games, and
attendance shot up over the
50,000 mark. In the key game of
the week, the Rastros bested
the Old Men, 33-19, as John

-Cain starred on defense and

Eddie Haskell vented his wrath
on John Kelton. Hurtin 4
Certin, the KA’s, and At Your
Cervix massacred an assort-
ment of inept freshmen and
upperclassmen while the SAE’s
took over the #1 spot by
successfully measuring Chip
Christian’s weight without the
aid of a beef scale.
