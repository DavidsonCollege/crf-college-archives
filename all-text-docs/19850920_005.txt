Jackson’s Work On Display

By MATT MORRIS

In his afterward to Lolita,
Russian author Vladimir Nabokov
boldly states, “I am neither a
reader nor a writer of didactic fic-
tion . . . for me a work of fiction
exists only insofar as it affords me
what I shall call aesthetic bliss,
that sense of being somehow,
somewhere connected with other
States of being where art (curios-
ity, tenderness, kindness, ecstasy)
is the norm.”

Had they met, Herb Jackson
and Vladimir Nabokov would un-
doubtedly be close friends. Now
on display in Chambers, this
Davidson artist’s drawings reach
not for a moral code, or any par-
ticular “meaning” but instead
stimulate on a more visual basis.
Jackson leaves the interpretation,
the “guiding hand,” where, as
Nabokov points out, it really be-
longs — in the audience’s own
heart and soul. While Jackson
may not paint a neo-expressionist
picture of a mushroom cloud, just
by allowing the eye to voyage into
his playful, mysterious, solemn
drawings, you can be sure he is
aware, and in touch with basic
human dilemmas, joys and sor-
rows. Jackson is an “abstract” art-
ist only in the sense that Billie
Holliday is an “abstract” vocalist
— what she sings is ultimately not
as important as how she sings.

Using countless layers of oil-
crayon coloring, Jackson’s works

refuse to settle on a single tone and
through time can be viewed as or-
ganic, perpetually changing
“pieces of nature.” Pollock’s fa-
mous statement “I am nature”
rings loudly in Jackson’s draw-
ings and like nature itself, there is
a different way of seeing each
piece everyday. P73, a typically
lush Jackson drawing filled with
vibrant fields of blue and leather-
tan, first reminded me of a soft,
diffused summer day, but upon re-
turning to the piece I found it had
become something angrier, its
elements coming together in a
more disconcerting way. (I’m
anxious to find out what it does to
me tommorow.)

Many have tried to pigeon-
hole Jackson’s style, with artists
like William Baziotes, Mark
Rothko and of course the ghost of
Jackson Pollock roaming around
somewhere within his canveses
and drawings. However, Jackson
is just too fine an artist for this sort
of sinful evaluation. His works
occupy their own space in the uni-
verse.

In a broader, more spiritual

sense perhaps, Jackson cannot es-

cape his own roots — he is a true
Southern gentleman artist and this
comes out in each of his works.
On the surfaces of his drawings,
all is quiet and seemingly peace-
ful, yet underneath there are sug-
gestions of darker, more mystical
implications strangely unique to

line. The papyrus P2 appears tran-
quil enough, but what exactly is
that monstrous form underneath
the drawing’s sandy textures?
Similarly, the earliest drawing in
the show, P27, has an initially
sobering feel but upon closer
viewing reveals an icy behemoth-
form lurking in the darkness.

Picking a favorite would be
next to impossible, (a task similar
to choosing one’s favorite tree)
but at this minute P87 seems espe-
cially intriguing. With a frieze-
like use of blue “mist” hanging
over a jagged Franz Kline stroke
of hellish red, the drawing con-
jours an infinite variety of people,
places and moods. But again, that

is a personal reaction to an iso-
lated moment in space and time.

ence.” See these drawings so you

Adventurer And Rebel Speaks In
Union’s 900 Room

By AARON LEVINE

Earlier this week, a rebel of
sorts came to Davidson. Dr. Jack
Wheeler, a combination of an-
thropologist, idealist and adven-
turer, spoke in the 900 Room last
Monday evening. He has been
trekking in Asia, Africa, and the
South Pacific, throughout jungle
and desert. His experience in this
regard led him to write The Adven-
turer’s Guide.

After traveling on a grant
studying anti-Soviet _ rebels
worldwide, Wheeler helped

create The Freedom Research
Foundation to support his favorite
cause, anti-Marxist guerrilla
movements in  Soviet-backed
third-world nations.

He came to Davidson to tell
about his cause. He spoke vehe-
mently on the need for the US to
support these movements, for the
sake of Democracy. He spoke as
an authority. He gave a slide pre-
sentation which included his ex-
perience with the Nicaraguan
“Contras,” the Afgan Mujahad-
din, the UNITA fighters in An-

gola, and the Cambodian KPLNF.

The slide show may have pro-
vided information which other-
wise would not have been
explained as clearly with mere
words. Wheeler tried to show that
these guerrillas are serious about
winning. They really want to
fight, by themselves, for them-
selves. CIA aid? No way!

Wheeler might not have
looked like a rebel; yet like any
rebel, he is controversial. Some
audience members expressed dis-
approval of him.
