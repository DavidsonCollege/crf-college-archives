Peacemaker: a solid DreamWorks debut

The Peacemaker, a cool thriller
starring George Clooney and Nicole

Kidman, is the first film from the hyped |

DreamWorks SKG, the company star-
ring some guys named Steven Spielberg
and David Geffen.

The movie isn’t.anywhere near
perfect, but it does keep rolling along at
asteady clip, with Clooney and Kidman
looking about as good:as you can look
while being fired upon by crazed,
nuclear-device-toting Bosnians.

Clooney plays a cocky Army Spe-
cial Forces colonel who’s somewhat of
an expert on the ins and outs of world-
wide illegal arms trading.

Kidman, a scientist who heads the
White House Nuclear Smuggling
Group, doesn’t know as much about
this sort of thing as George does.

But she can speak Russian, read
satellite photographs, spit out techno-
babble, and run like a greyhound while
wearing high heels.

Clooney and Kidman team up to
stop a Russian general who has swiped
10 nuclear warheads, one of which has
been promised as payment to a.Bosnian

@ Nicole Kidman and George Clooney co-star in The

Peacemaker, a suspense thriller.

terrorist.

The story takes place all over the
world, with sequences in Russia, Ger-
many, Macedonia, France, Slovakia,
and the Czech Republic.

One of the best scenes takes place
in Vienna, where Clooney uses a
Mercedes as a demolition derby car,
repeatedly slamming into three cars
that have been chasing him and Kidman
through the city’s narrow streets.

The final sequence takes place on
the east side of Manhattan, right around
the United Nations building. Clooney
and a team of snipers are trying to nail
the head terrorist before he sets off a
bomb and obliterates the surrounding

area.

The director shows a steady hand
in building tension here, with clear sniper
shots suddenly being blocked by cute
little girls and trees.

The movie tends to have low points
in between action sequences which hurts
the overall thrust and power of the film.

Yet, these low points make the
movie alittle more realistic than if there
was just scene upon scene of things
blowing up and people being shot.

The director does a good job of
developing Kidman’s character, but
Clooney stays the same throughout the
film.

Grade: B.

THE DAVIDSONIAN ARTS 6 LIVING TUESDAY, OCTOBER 7,1997

By Eric Borcstrom, AMY Marks,
AND LINDSEY MEYERS
Student Health Advisors

Last week, we finished speaking
to PE 101 classes, also speaking to a
few halls.

You may have noticed our hot
pink flyers advertising our hall pro-
grams.

‘If you would like us to come
speak on your hall, let your hall coun-
selororRA know. Asaparty favor, we
will distribute fasty treats.

This week we will respond to the
first question we have received: What
isahealthy relationship at Davidson—
physically and psychologically?

There is no perfect recipe for a
healthy relationship, but we have a few
suggestions that might help.

At the base of a healthy relation-
ship is communication. Early on, it is
important to talk about each other's
expectations.

At times during the relationship,
you should discuss emotional aspects
about yourself such as what you like
and don’t like.

This would help your significant
other decide what is appropriate in
different situations.

For example, does your. partner
want to be touched? How much time
do they want to spend with you?

It can be rather annoying if you
are being smothered by your girl/boy-
friend.

Take time to discuss your sensi-

The tricks to a pro-
ductive relationship

tivity levels and hopefully things will
go more smoothly. If you don’t know
the status of the relationship, call fora
DTR— Define The Relationship. This
will help both of you to be happier.

Like many students’at Davidson,
you have a busy schedule, and a rela-
tionship might seem to be an addi-
tional time commitment.

It is helpful to find a balance
regarding the time you spend with each
other.

This can be one of the most diffi-
cult things to do when juggling a busy
schedule. ;

Even if you have been dating for
along time, itis important to plan dates
and set times to get together.

Don’t just assume that he or she is
going to leave time open for you.

It is also important to have a
healthy sexual relationship.

This does not mean that you have
to be sexually active, but both people
should know each others limits, de-
sires, and wishes.

At Davidson, there is a wide spec-
trum of sexual activity, from absti-
nence to frequent hook-ups, and it is
impossible to know what any one per-
son wants without talking about it.

In any case, mutual satisfaction is

‘the goal.

We hope this provides some use-
ful information, and perhaps will raise
some questions for future columns.

Please send questions to The Stu-
dent Body, c/o Mitch Shores, PO Box
4180.
