With the aid of a few thousand pounds of microorga-
nisms, we’re helping to solve the water pollution problem in
Rochester. Maybe the solution can help others.

What we did was to combine two processes in a way
that gives us one of the most efficient water-purifying sys-
tems private industry has ever developed.

One process is caiied “aciiveted sludge,” developed
by man to accelcraic nature’s microorganism adsorption.
What this means i: that for the majority of wastes man can
produce, there is an crganism waiting somewhere that will
happily assimilate it. And thrive on it.

The breakthrough came when Kodak scientists found
a way to combine the activated sludge process with a trickling
filter process and optimized the combination.

We tested our system in a pilot plant for five years.

(At Kodak, we were working on environmental improvement
long before it made headlines.) And the pilot project worked
so well, we built a ten-million-dollar plant that can purify
36-million gallons of water a day.

Governor Roekefetiér called this “the biggest volun-
tary project undertaken by private industry in support of
New York State's pure-water program.”

Why did we do it? Partly because we're in business to
make a profit—and clean water is vital to our business. But in
furthering our own needs, we have helped further society's.
And our business depends on society.

We hope our efforts to cope with water pollution will
inspire others to do the same. And, we’d be happy to share
our water-purifying information with them. We all need clean

water. So we dll have to work together.

More than a business.
