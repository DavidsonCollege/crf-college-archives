THE DAVIDSONIAN

Malagasy connection

By ANDREW WHITEMAN
Guest Writer

Whenever I told people about
my plan to go to Africa, I always
got some reaction. Most of the
time, the reactions included fear
for my life or admiration of my
bravery, both expressions of how
apparently scary Africa is.
Naturally, I was somewhat nervous
to spend a semester in Madagascar
in a cultural immersion program.

I lived in three different loca-
tions, including a rural village,
each with a different family. I took
anthropology and language courses
in French and Malagasy,
Madagascar’s language, and also
conducted an independent study
project.

Over the course of the semester,
I constantly battled stereotypes. I
wanted to be at ease and have a true
cultural experience but was appre-
hensive. I hated that I believed
what people were telling me:
Madagascar __is dangerous.
Inefficient. Poor. Unsanitary.
Walking on the streets of the
bustling capital, Antananarivo,
made me nervous. People constant-
ly heckled me for money, food and
clothes. My first reaction was to be
distrustful of anyone who
approached me.

On the other hand, I was living
in a culture very different from my
own, and people also had their own
Stereotypes about me. Foreigners
are a rare sight. People stared and
laughed, and even babies cried
when they saw me. I often got the
impression that Malagasy people
assumed that I was worth unimag-
inable amounts of money. I was
even treated differently as an
American as opposed to a
Frenchman because the United
States still represents the land of
dreams and opportunity.

-Davidson College encourages
study abroad. By graduation,
about 65% of a class will have
studied abroad for credit some-
time while a Davidson student.
For the class of 2007, it was 74%.
Students usually study abroad
during the junior year for a
semester, but sometimes during
the sophomore year and/or dur-
ing the summer after the fresh-
man, sophomore, or junior year.
The cost of semester study
abroad programs are usually
comparable to the cost of being
on campus, while financial aid
and scholarships can be used for
any Davidson study abroad pro-
gram that takes place during the
academic year and for approved
non-Davidson programs that take
place during the academic year.

My rural village home-stay
experience was particularly helpful
at dispelling some of these prevail-
ing stereotypes. I lived for five
days in Analamaitso, population
100, in the home of a Malagasy
family. This experience was quite
daunting at first for both the vil-
lagers and me. The first few days
were full of awkward stares and
bad attempts to speak the local
dialect. We were all confused.

Soon, I realized that I would
have to find other ways to establish
connections. I started to participate
in daily life. I worked the land,
shelled peanuts, helped with cook-
ing and most importantly got to
know people. I found that even
with a language barrier, there are
many other ways to establish con-
nections. Simply by giving a high-
five, playing with children or mak-
ing any possible attempt to speak
the language, I could make friends.

Things were going well until my
host mother asked me if I wanted
to go for a walk around a few other
villages. I said yes, but soon regret-
ted the decision after being sur-
rounded by groups of people, eager
to hear what the white man had to
say.

“Oh great,” I thought. “I am
being taken around to be shown
off. I am totally on display—I hate
this!”

But as the experience continued,
I had a realization: Everyone was
eager simply because they had
never met anyone like me before.
The only impressions they had of
foreigners were based on stereo-
types, if that. At that moment, I saw
that I had to let go of my own inse-
curities. I started to understand that
the whole point of this experience
was to get to know people, to share
a laugh, to be myself.

On the last night of my rural vil-
lage stay, my family and I

affiliated programs in 22 countries
around the world. In addition,

Study on approved non-Davidson
programs.

An obvious benefit of study
abroad is experiencing another
country or culture. Study abroad

usually results in personal growth ;

including maturing, having
increased confidence, learning new
problem solving _ techniques,

becoming more open-minded plus
improving language and communi-
cation skills. It is sometimes possi-
ble to receive Davidson credit for
core courses, major, minor and/or
concentration credits. Student also
often take courses that are not
offered at Davidson such as
Aboriginal History in Australia.

A Davidson student’s first step in
the study abroad process is to
attend a Study Abroad General
Informational Meeting. During the

exchanged gratitude for the experi-
ence we had together. My host
father, André, said something that
deeply touched me: “We want you
to know that we don’t take any-
thing for granted.” I was so happy
that he believed, like I did, that we
had gotten past some of our differ-
ences,

When put into a place like a rural
village, the differences between
cultures seem stark, but one must
find the similarities. I had the best
time during my semester in
Madagascar sitting around the din-
ner table and conversing with my
host families. If I learned a little
about someone else’s perspective,
then I made progress.

I thought a lot about the idea of
progress while in Madagascar. Yes,
some of the stereotypes are true: It
can be dangerous, dirty and ineffi-
cient. When foreigners try to
approach such problems, however,
they must see beyond biases which
are most likely not accurate. My
semester taught me that the first
step in addressing global issues is
to have a genuine conversation
with someone from another cul-
ture.

spring of 2008, these meetings
take place on Mondays at 1:30
p.m. and on Thursday at 4 p.m.
through Reading Day (May 8th).
There is no need to make an
appointment; just show up at one
of these meetings that last about
an hour. A student can then make
an appointment for an individual
counseling session with Carolyn

Ortmayer, Study Abroad
Coordinator, or Ann Brindisi,
Study Abroad Counselor.

Students intending to study
abroad during the fall of 2008
must let Davidson know by March
15, 2008 by completing an “On
Leave” form. For the first time,
this “On Leave” form is on-line.

The Davidson Study Abroad
Office stands ready to help stu-
dents find appropriate study
abroad programs and to answer
questions about study abroad. We
are located in Duke Residence
Hall. Go Global! Study Abroad!
