The Morning After

As much as we rant and rave about change, sometimes change is deleterious. If

one mistakenly has sex without a condom or other birth control device, or the birth

_ control device used fails and the female partner fears she is pregnant, the world can
suddenly come to an end for once happy college students.

In the past, these students could take some respite from their anxiety knowing that
the Student Health Center could provide a “morning after” pill in the event of such
emergencies. This fall, however, the Student Health Center decided to discontinue the
service. Students must now go through the Center and get a referral to doctors not
associated with the college. The pevious question is “Why?” :

What if the woman was raped? Why should anyone have to go through the
traumatic hell of dealing with more than one clinic. when Davidson’s own should
suffice? Yes, some students, parents, faculty, staff, and doctors believe life begins at
conception and that the “morning after” pill is a euphemism for a quick abortion. But
others disagree or are not bothered by the termination of a pregnancy. The availability
of an option is better than no option at all.

What statement does this make about the Student Health Center and, more
broadly, about Davidson College? Are we too afraid of unwanted pregnancies to
aknowledge their existance? Are we too afraid of the possibility that the college might
be condoning casual sex? Regardless, through this policy adjustment, Davidson is
implicitly putting itself in the position of legislating morality. And we know that is not
the college's intent.

___ Davidson’s own Health Educator wants this service reinstated. Why. hasn’t it
been? Who makes these decisions? Once again, the students weren’t asked.

The meaning of life found here

To the editors,
When I attended a
Davidson gathering for stu-

dents studying in England, I
was disgusted after reading

ticle on what the meaning of
life was all about. I have
never been one to speak up
inclass, or even write a letter
to The Davidsonian, but it
was about time I did, even if
I am in England and away
from Davidson.

Britton’s main point
seems to be that there is no
way that anybody could ever
figure out the meaning of
life, and even God himself
doesn’t know the answer.
Hey, now there is a deep
thought if I have ever heard
one.

The meaning of life is a
self-awakening or an inner-

If there was no meaning to
life, why would our Creator
have even put us here? Life

Britton Taylor’s opinion ar-:

quest for one’s true identity. .

has a purpose and it is up to
the individuals to struggle
between himself and his so-
ciety in order to find his own

spirit. This mightbereferred —

to as just the maturation pro-
cess, not just the “sexual
maturation” process as
Britton seems to joke sev-
eral times.

When we arrived at
Davidson many of.us hoped
to fit in and be “cool.” Most
people found it easy to joina
big group (like a fraternity
or their hall) to associate with
and conform to the group’s
identity so they didn’t have
to be judged individually.
But as we experienced liv-
ing with people from around
the world at Davidson, the
group mentality eventually
breaks down (but for some
people it hasn’t!). This is
the time when you really
question who you are and
who you want to be. It is a
time when you assess your

strengths and weaknesses as
a person, question your val-
ues, and begin to enjoy who
bit. of confidence, you can.-
set your goals and face any-
thing in the world.

Everybody has their
own version of their mean-
ing of life because we are all
individuals on this planet. I
hope that all of you at
Davidson come to reach a
level of maturity as a person
when you finish your time.
there. Eric Sapp putit nicely
in his article (I actually
agreed with him for once!)
that Davidson builds not only
a student, but also an indi-
vidual. I hope that you will
realize how much Davidson
really does for you while
you live in the Davidson
community.

Best of luck to all Wild-
cats from the U.K.

To the editors,

The stomach is full. The
refrigerator is stocked. The
laundry, clean (not to men-
tion the room). Our parents
have come and gone.

Am I the only one on
this campus who genuinely
gets excited about parents’
weekend? I don’t care so
much about the “good, qual-
ity time, spent talking about
the rest of my life,” but the
time spent with other par-
ents, families interacting,
seeing the gene pool of your
roommate, finding out
whether the red neck is he-
reditary—it’s like experienc-

[ing an episode of Friends,

kinda.

I just think the school
should make a bigger deal
out of it. It’s the old-timers’
pockets from which the
$20,000 comes. Iknow there
are activities planned, a tail-
gate get-together, speakers,
etc., but I also know some
parents just don’t feel alto-
gether welcome.

This year is a little dif-
ferent with the convocation
mix-up, but other functions
were also not so successful.
I took my parents to meet
my professors, and two of
them were not to be found. I

understand ifthey have some

other pressing business to

attend, but this weekend is
the only chance the parents
get to relive their college
days, to rub shoulders with
the intellects who are not
only influencing their chil-
dren but running away with
their money as well.

I don’t want to be an-
other unsatisfied customer
perpetuating the us-against-
them mindset. I’m happy
with Davidson, my parents
are happy with Davidson,
just sometimes our expecta-
tions get a little inflated.
