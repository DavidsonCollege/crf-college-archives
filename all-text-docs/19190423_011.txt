CHRIST'S PRAYER 1S STUDY
OF VOLUNTEER BAND.

Roberts led the last meeting of the
Volunteer Band in a study of the prayer
Christ taught his disciples, There are
two great divisions: God's glory and
man’s good. Under the last the three
petitions are for provision, pardon and
protection, Protection does not mean
absolute exemption from temptation. but
strength to overcome in trial. The three
temptations of Christ in the wilderness
illustrate his teaching on this subject. All
of his prayers were unselfish. The plu-
ral pronoun “we” and “our,” used in
prayer include all. Every great revival
of the Holy Spirit comes through prayer
for others. Of course one must be right
himself to have power in prayer, but he
really prays for himself only that he may
be used to help others.

MINISTERIAL BANDS ELECT
OFFICERS FOR COMING YEAR

At the last meeting of the Ministerial
Band there were twenty-three men pres-
ent.

The following officers were elected to
serve for the coming year: L. G. Cal-
houn, president; W. P. Cummings, vice
president, and C. E. Cunningham sec-
retary.

An enjoyable talk was rendered by
C. F. Allen, ex-’19. He chose as his sub-
ject matter the first twelve verses of the
third chapter of Proverbs, He brought
out the ideas that this passage deals with
the works of God; and that we should
trust God with all our heart, not a part,
but all. A decision must be made as to
whether we will serve God with all our
heart or with only a part.

The meeting was very interesting and
it was enjoyed by all present.

|DR. MARTIN'S CONDITION

BETTER; NOW AT HOME.

Dr. Martin's condition is so improved
that he has been discharged from the hog-
pital and is at home for a few days be-
fore he goes to Mississippi to recuperate.
In all probability he will not be able to
assume his work again before commence-
ment, but the student body hopes that
he will soon recover his strength and be
back at his office by next fall.

D. C. BULLETIN HAS
BEEN REVISED TO DATE.

The Davidson College Bulletins have
been received at Mr. Jackson's _ office.
The bulletin has a great many changes
and one or two additions, in comparison
to the 1918 issue and which will make it
a much better advertiser for Davidson.
The new catalogue shows an increase of
58 students over the enrollment of the
last collegiate year, and with a list of
two hundred prospective students, and
with such a magazine to advertise, Da-
vidson should at least double this in-
crease next year,

The catalogue shows an_ illustrated
view of the colege, which includes four
proposed buildings. ‘lhe historic sketch
is also revised from last year, and two
new courses have been added to the cur-
riculum. These are: Accounting and
Business Methods, under F. L. Jackson;
Military Science and ‘Tactics, under
Lieut. Col. A. H. Mueller, U.S. Infan-
try. Another change is the addition of
one unit, for entrance, to the fourteen
which heretofore has been the case. An
account of the §. A. ‘T. C. is given, in
addition to the regular college roll, with
the officers and non-commissioned offi-
cers and rosters by companies.

ABOUT COMMENCEMENT.

All the particulars of our commence-
ment have not been worked out yet, but
how does this brief forecast sound, fel-
lows?

Dr. Mauze, of Huntington, W. Va.,
will deiiver the baccalaureate sermon;
Dr. McCracken, president of Lafayette
College, the annual address; also a good
“Y” speaker will be here whose name
will be announced later. A special effort
is being made among the alumni to bring
a larger number than usual together this
year. Several classes have already an-
nounced reunions, notably '14, ‘09, ‘04.
and ‘99. The return of ‘99 is to be
especially big on account of this being
the twentieth anniversary of the grad-
uation of this class. “The trustees are
expecting to have an unusually import-
ant meeting, and doubtless it will be well
attended. They have to select a new
English professor, and determine several
other matters of far-reaching conse-
quence.

Sometime during commencement a
memorial service will be held for the
Davidson heroes who died in the army.
This program has not been completed,
though it is known there will be a me-
morial address by a distinguished speak-
er, special music and other features ap-
propriate to the occasion.

Two other noteworthy occasions will
be the exercises of the Senior class in pre-
senting their class gift, and the carnival
the student organization is planning in
lieu of the reception usually attended by
societies and fraternities.

Commencement, beginning on Sunday.
will last through Wednesday this year.
Everybody is invited to the big time.

Thrifty Idea.

“She is a very proud beauty.
night we parted in anger.”

“Going to make up?”

“TI guess so. But I think I'll stay
mad about a week and spend some of
my money on myself.”—Louisville Cou-

rier- Journal.

t SUNDAY SCHOOL BOOMING

BIBLE CLASSES SLACKING.

The Bible classes this week were very
good considering the number of boys that
were off the hill for Easter. It would
help the attendance a great deal if ev-
ery floor would have a meeting. “The
first Hoors of Georgia and Watts have
not had meetings for several Sundays.
There was a total attendance of 90 with
32 from Rumple, 18 from South Cham-
bers, 15 from North Chambers, 13 from
Watts and 12 from, Georgia.

The Sunday schools were up to their
usual standard with 18 teachers and at-
tendance of 223. There were 4 teach-
ers at Brawley's and 54 pupils. 4 teach-
ers at Cornelius and 50 pupils, 6 teach-
ers at Caldwell. and 41 pupils, 3 teach-
ers at the mill and 33 pupils, 1 teacher
at Shearer chapel and 25 pupils. ‘There
was no meeting at Oak Grove as the
superintendent. was absent.

An eminent Scotch preacher was try-
ing to explain to an old lady the mean-
ing of the Scriptural expression, “Take
up thy bed and walk.” He informed her
that the bed was simply a mat or rug
easily taken up and carried away.

“Na, na,” was her reply, ‘T canna be-
lieve that. ‘The bed was a regular four-
poster. ‘There would be no miracle in
walking away wi’ a bit o’ mat or rug on
your back.”
