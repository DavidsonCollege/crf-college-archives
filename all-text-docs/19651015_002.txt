FRIDAY, OCTOBER 15, 1965

(Letters to the editor do not necessarily reflect the views of the editor.)

A New Responsibility

We wholeheartedly commend the
faculty for its prudent and’ realistic
approach to the matter of student
consumption of alcoholic beverages.

Although the measures approved
by the professors differ slightly from
the recommendations made by a joint
faculty-Trustee committee, we feel
certain that the college trustees will
look favorably on the faculty action.

The amendments are not meant to
be an endorsement of student drink-
ing; rather, they are a sign of the
faculty’s confidence in the maturity
and responsibility of Davidson stu-
dents. .

Such action did not come hastily.

Ten months ago the faculty realized
the need for a meaningful statement
of the policy of the college in this
area and recommended the appoint-
ment of the joint study committee.

The recommendations of this com-
mittee were approved with minor

amendments by the faculty Tuesday.

It is indeed encouraging that the
success of such a joint committee be
demonstrated by the positive action
taken by the faculty. .

Even more impressive is the unani-
mity of feeling among the faculty dur-
ing the week. Several professors have
remarked to us since the meeting con-
cerning the harmonious, yet serious,
discussion of the matter.

Rarely have we seen such accord
following a faculty meeting on a topic
of such importance.

We are confident that Davidson
students will accept this increased
measure of responsibility placed upon
them by the liberalized rule.

We are confident, too, that students
will accept their share of responsi-
bility within the college community
for seeing to it that future issues are
discussed in a similar spirit of calm,
unemotional cooperation, -

A Recent Trend

We welcome and encourage the ex-
pressions of opinions on this page in
the form of letters to the editor and
are gratified that THE DAVIDSON-
IAN ‘is able to serve as a-forum of
thought for all sides of various issues.

But we are concerned with a re-
cent trend, begun in the last couple
of issues and carried on by Ken Childs
in this issue, of misstating objective
facts in leading to subjective conclu-
sions.

In the case of Childs, he states,
without any basis, that Associate Edi-
tor Johnny Clark’s position is “the
view that the ‘behavior of the Ne-
groes in Watts can be largely ex-
plained in terms of the color of their
skin.’ Whether Childs has to invent
a new position for Clark because it is
easier to refute than Clark’s actual
position, or whether he honestly takes
the flaming radicals’ view that any
critic of modern civil rights tactics is
a racist,” we do not know.

Evidently irrelevant to Childs is the
fact that Clark’s only allusion to race

was in pointing out that the rioters
were Negroes and that many of their
victims were white, a point against
which few will argue. ;

For his convenience, Childs ignores
the fact that Clark states his position
as in agreement with Will Herberg,
that the James Farmers and Martin
Luther Kings, “the inciters to law-de-
fiance in the name of ‘convenience,’
are ultimately responsible for the

”

ots.

That Childs’ defense of his room-
mate's letter is strangely inconclu-
sive is beside the point, the point be-
ing that perhaps it would make more
sense to reject a viewpoint that Clark
did express rather than one Clark
neither holds nor has expressed. .

If those writing letters for publi-
cation would state as facts only those
which are in truth facts, then a con-
siderable amount of editorial page
bickering could be eliminated. with
the result that real differences of
opinion would be more obvious and
the arguments more conclusive.

Postal Bureaucracy

One of the changes returning up-
perclassmen noted first in famous
Davidson standards was the revised
mail schedule at the “P.O.” The time-
hallowed custom of scribbling a few
lines just after supper to the pretty
ones or the hometown bank and get-
ting the letters in the outgoing mail
that same night is gone, perhaps for

good.
Where the Davidson Post Office.

once had five mail pick-ups per day,
now there is a stretch between 5:15
p.m. and 8:30 a.m. when no mail is
dispatched — a 15-hour period once
alleviated by the traveling Charlotte
Highway Post Office at 9:55 p.m. and
2:53 a.m. This service is gone like
first week rush and doesn’t seem like-
ly to return.

Besides the definite inconvenience
caused by the fact that no mail leaves
Davidson until 8:30 a.m., students
have also noted that it takes a long
time for mail from Charlotte or any
nearby point to make its way to the
Davidson PO. Recent tests of the mail
service showed that it took 28 hours
to get a letter from Charlotte to David-
son, a distance of about 20 miles; and
worse still, it took one letter 36 hours
to travel from Cornelius to Davidson,
a distance of only about two miles.

Nor is Davidson alone in this latest
mail snafu. There is no way that any-
one in Davidson, Mooresville, Corn-
elius, Huntersville, or Mount Mourne,
can get a letter moving out of the
post office after about 5:15 in the
evening, unless that individual wants
to drive all the way to the central
Charlotte post office.

The announcement by Davidson's
Postmaster, Bill Mayhew, a Republi-
can appointed by former President
Eisenhower, that Davidson's mail
classification had been changed from
second class to first class post office
status made many students feel that
the change in rank was responsible
for the deteriorating serivce.

‘Mayhew said that the change from
second to first class made no dif-
ference in the number of small pick-
ups or deliveries at Davidson — what
this change amounted to was simply
recognition that there were a lot more
stamps sold last year than usual to
citizens and female-conscious Wild-

ats.

“The revised schedule of mail rout-
ing,” Mayhew commented, “is due to
a new concept in the U.S. postal sys-
tem that went into effect last June —
this is the sectional center system,
whose goal is to get every piece of
first-class mail from center to center
in 24 hours.” ;

This “sectional center” business
works like this: Every piece of mail
going out of Davidson is sent to Char-
lotte, the nearest sectional center;
from there the mail is routed. to var-
ious points over the nation. This is
why it took 36 hours to get a letter
from Cornelius to Davidson; it had
to go to Charlotte first. .

Mayhew explained that the sectional
center system was brand new and that
there were numerous bugs still in it.

Somehow we are skeptical about
any new system that takes 36 hours
and 45 miles to get a letter two miles
— but for now there’s no. alternative.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Childs Disputes Graves:

‘Questions Are Important

Dear Editor:

Now that we have read Mr.
Graves’ letter we may know
why he lost his scholarship, but
we certainly know nothing more,
if anything, about Watts. Per-
haps Mr. Nzongola’s language
was poor and his analysis over-
simplified, but Mr. Clark's posi-
tion is not worth defending, and
the point of the Nzongola letter
was to express indignation with
his trite, shallow explanations of
a significant . problem.

Clark’s position is somewhat
less than that of the sophisticat-
ed racist, i.e., the view that the
behavior of the Negroes in Watts
can largely be explained in
terms of the color of their skin
tather than by careful analysis
of their predicament in our
society.

Questions are more ‘mportant -

to me than answers — what hap-
pened in Watts is interesting. but
why it happened is the import-
ant thing and neither Mr. Graves
nor Mr. Clark came close to the
real question, much less the an-
swer.

Dear Editor:

The following begins as a dia-
logue of sorts about fraternities
and the issues they raise. For
the author’s self-defense the
identity of the participants is left
to the reader.

Reviewing the situation, the
protestations of the zealots
seem to assume the propor-
tions of incantation and elixir,
ironically the accouterments of
its enemy.

Fraternities are the putative
repositories of primitive fetish-
ism, litinous rituals which are
quaint or antediluvian, depend-
ing on the degree of the com-
mentator's intellectual sophosti-
cation. More realistically, an
instructive analogy can be
drawn with fundamentalism: rit-
ual is meaningful only to the
believer.

Mvsticism is the inherent pro-
genitor neither of its critics al-
legation of pandemic anti-intel-
lectualism or its adherents spir-
itual “‘redolence” that stimulates
inter-membership coherence.
Rather, as part of an ossified
Davidsonianism. Patterson court
has become the arcanum of
camaraderie.

These factors are significant,
but have no deterministic value.
for heterogeneous student per-
sonalities from often dissimilar
vicinages do not substantiate
unique characterizations of (a)
fraternities(s). Another argu-
ment is that from without, the
campus, fraternities included, is
atypical or schzoid, though not
this fact but its derivatives for
academic community and for a
prototype of “reality” are of
immanent import.

In final compromise the critic
might offer that the demise of
fraternities is the particular in
& more general and belated attri-
tion, the shedding of a fingols-
tic integument.

The discussion, inevitably,
turns to the purpose of David-
son College. (Purposes would
make possible the Introduction
of congeries of hopelessly dis-
parate, contradictory _ state-
ments. The tedium of an in-
cisive analysis of the concept of
a Christian liberal arts college,
e.g., is simply not worth it.)

No individual, of course, can
speak with absolute impunity,
but from almost every quarter
in some fashion the liberal arts
and academic freedom evoke
appealing images. The idea, if
not the words, was clasically ex-
pressed by John Stuart Mill. A
more contemporary version is
that of Henry Steele Comma-
ger.

There is no fixed body of
truth about politics, history,
economics, or law any more
than about physics, biology, or
medicine. It is not the busi.
ness of the university to hand
down a body of agreed-on
truths, or to indoctrinate the
young.

if, in a moment of folly,
the university or its professors
attempted to do this they
would fail, for young men and
women intelligent enough to
get into a university are too
intell’gent to submit tamely to
indoctrination.

Hopefully, this is true of Dav-
idson, Commager continues.

The university, to be sure,

on gifts and appropriations
and many people carelessly
conclude that those who pay
the piper may call the tune.
But appropriations to a uni-
versity no more justify public
control of its intellectual ac-
tivities than appropriations to
the judiciary justify control of
the decisions handed down by
the judges.

The inauguration of the gen-
uine liberal arts at Davidson
and academic programs for their
own sake in the pristine sense
of academic freedom would be
an upheaval more revolutionary
than severe fraternity restric-
tlons or even their abolition.

Perhaps Commager'’s words
are not what is intended by ‘“‘lib-
eral arts” at Davidson. but if it
is, the implications cannot be
restricted to fraternities. The
egregious heteroclite of frater-
nities, however, in such an ideal
should not require explicit state-
ment.

It is legitimate to ask whether
Davidson College has supported
and encouraged fraternities as
social organizations of a general
sort or as the affiliates of na-
tional bodies that prescribe local
membership unanimity for ad-

(

mission and in some cases pre-
scribe religious and racial
groups. Has the college defined
the need which fraternities os-
tensibly fill ?

In this connection Mr. Vick’s
tripartite division (cf. Letters
to the Editor, DAVIDSONIAN,
October 9, 1965) is relevant, but
unrealistic. There is obviously
more to Davidson than the aca-
demic aspect: e.g., the. “whole
man” or the “Davidson gentle-
men”, which are terms that ef-
fectively loosen the purse strings
of middle-class Southerners, but
may be the excuse for arbitrary
action, as witnessed in the fac-
ulty resolution referred to by
Vick.

The malaise affecting fraterni-
ties to a greater extent, propor-
tionately, than extra-fraternity
groups is perhaps the discour-
agement of individualism. The
fraternity solution to the pro-
verbial identity. crisis is too
stereotyped,

To argue that a sufficiently
motivated individual will not
be thwarted by fraternities shifts
the argument from the group
to the individual, where gen.
eralizations, merely by numeri-
ical weight, are tenuous indeed.

It might be more valuable to
redirect the question and com-
pare both college goals and
individually successful social-
academic relationships in and
outside of fraternities. The bur-
den of proof is on the fraternities
as well as the college.

Finally, a more nebulous but
pregnant question involves Dav-
idson’s social permeability. Is
the college society's critic or
society's patron, To mix a meta-
phor, Is Davidson College the
nursery in the WASP’s nest?

CLOSE-UP ,

By TOM CRAIG
Davidsonian Associate Editor

| TT ETE TE:

It was a day in late May, and I was visiting
a friend in Uppsala, Sweden. My classes in France
were over, and I had come to spend some time with
Torgny Rasmuson, whom I had met the fall before.

Torgny had reminded me often of a lifelong
friend from home. Both Torgny and my hometime
friend were sons of doctors; both were themselves
pre-medical students. Each of them had an interest
in swimming, and both were at one time nationally-
ranked breast-stroke champions. Each enjoyed the
out-of-doors, their major pastime being hunting,
fishing, and camping.

I had thought of these similarities that day, and
wondered just what my hometown buddy was doing
at the time. We had both gone to Davidson, rooming
on the same hall our Freshman Year. During vaca-
tions we often got together and talked, sincerely and
with an eye to the future, as true friends can.

_ The postman arrived at Torgny’s, and I had an
air-mail special from home. Curiously I ripped open
the letter, and before reading it, noticed the en- |
closed newspaper clipping.

KILLED IN AUTO CRASH

“ partanburg Doctor’s Son Killed in Auto
Crash,” it said. And then the article began with a
Sickening finality, “Sam Orr Black, III, 20-year-
old Davidson College student, was killed .. .”

Tragedy had struck my little circle of friends.
I was 3500 miles away from home; what could I do?
Rapidly, blindingly, scenes of Sandy’s life flooded
my mind...

I saw him as a small boy telling one and all
that he was going to be a doctor like his Daddy and
Granddaddy were. I saw him describing vividly to
a captivated eighth grade audience, the operation
he had been allowed to watch his father perform the
day before. I saw him tying the national age group
breast-stroke record in the summer of the ninth
grade. I remembered the time he brought the small-
est member of his live snake collection to school, in
his pocket, and terrified his teachers.

___ Tcan never forget his profitable sideline, hunt-
ing quail and selling them to a local restaurant. In
high school he mastered all the Biology thrown at
him; he served on the Student Council; he won an
appointment to the Air Force Academy.

At Davidson, a young lady at Limestone, Kappa
Alpha, and his pre-med courses were main interests.
It was on a trip to his fiancee that tragedy struck.

From an ocean away, all that I could do was -
harbor my memories, and then try to write his
parents. Then as now, words seemed futile, inade-
quate messengers for my feelings.

AWARD

Last week's DAVIDSONIAN noted that a Sandy
Black Memorial Award had been established by his
grandmother. The annual honor, in the form of a
cash grant, will be awarded to the rising senior
pre-medical student deemed most outstanding by the
Administration and the Chairmen of the Biology and
Chemistry Departments. .

No more fitting tribute could be established.
The ideals, the deep human interests, of Sandy Black
will be carried into the medical profession by the
Davidsonians who receive the Award.

t ey the Award be a challenge, as well as a trust,
‘o them.
