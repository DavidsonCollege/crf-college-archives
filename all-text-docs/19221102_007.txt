HERO OF NEAR EAST IS
A DAVIDSON GRADUATE

The training which mien receive at
Davidson serves not only to increase
their mental forces and their moral re-
serve, but it serves also to strengthen
the manly character in them, of protec-
tion to the weak and helpless.

It was just a few days ago that
word was received from Mitylene, re-
counting the rescue work of Ameri-
cans in the Near East. In these dis-
patches was mentioned an incident
which clearly showed the result of
manly training at Davidson. L. W.
Klutz, now of Galveston, Texas, but a
native of Chester, S. C., figured in a
rescue which was vividly described in
the report of Dr. Mabel Elliott. It
seems that in the rush attending the
loading of refugees on a steamer, a
Greek baby'was pushed from a barge
into the waters. The occupants of the
barge were either too dumbfounded of
selfish to offer aid, but nevertheless,
manhood asserted itself in Mr. Klutz
who witnessed the accident from a
steamer some hundred yards distant.
Unhesitatingly he doffed his hat, coat
and shoes and plunged into the bay to
attempt a rescue, which with, God’s
help, was effected. - Resuming his gar-
ments the hero continued through the
day, unmindful of his serious condi-
tion. But the director, Doctor Elliott,
found him so, and was just in time to
avert a case of pneumonia.

This is the type of men Davidson
is teaching and Davidson spirit turns
out. It is not only the type which stirs
his Alma Mater to songs of praise, but
the type which every true man wor-
ships and honors as his ideal. It is the
model man, the true man, the Ameri-
can man—it is a Man of God.

DAVIDSON ALUMNI RECEIVES
FELLOWSHIP DEGREE

Once again does rightful and due
honors fall to Davidson. One of her
former students, Dr. Robert E. Abell,
of Chester, S. C., has left for Boston
to receive the most coveted honor that
can fall to the lot of an American
physician, He is to receive a degree in
the American College of Surgeons,
which he deserves, sevenfold, because
of his faithfulness and loyalty to duty
as surgeon in chief of the Chester
sanatorium.

Davidson College joins with the
town of Chester in celebrating this
event which is an honor to man, home
and Alma Mater.

R. O. T. C. SOON TO
OPEN RIFLE RANGE

After November 11th the indoor
rifle range will be open to all Fresh-
men taking R. O. T, C. . This range is
one of the best equipped in the South,
and all new men should avail them-
selves of this privilege.

Last year the Freshmen made an
unusually fine record, and it is consid-
ered doubtful, by the officers in com-
mand, that this year’s class will equal
it.

A contest will be arranged between
men from each company. The win-
ner of this contest will be presented a
bronze medal for marksmanship. Rifle
meets will. also be arranged with
Georgia Tech, Mississippi A. and M.
and other schools in the South.

Due to the lack of equipment, the
regular maneuvers and __ stunts
scheduled for Armistice Day will not
be held on that date, however, Major
Hearn hopes to hold this event as soon
as the necessary equipment is received
from the War Department.

ment of West. We've been hoping for
some time he’d lose it.

QUIPS AND CRANKS TO
BE BEST PUBLISHED

Although the 1923 Quips and
Cranks is yet in embryonic form much
of the preliminary work has already
been done. All the photography has
been completed with the exception of
the R. O. T. C. pictures. What the R.
O, T. C. pietures will be depends
largely on how much the battalion is
willing to expend. It is hoped, how-
ever, that there will be a picture of
each company, individual pictures of
the cadet officers, pictures of the in-
structors and the sponsors, and special
pictures.

The annual this year will cost from
$3,000 to $3,500, it is stated. As the
annual receives only two dollars per
student from the blanket fee the
manager, R. I). Mcleod, has peti-
tioned the Board of Directors for per-
mission to assess the students $3 or
$3.50 per man. This is quite neces-
sary as the above are the only sources
of income, ‘The contract is as yet un-
signed. It will not be split this year as
heretofore. The fall advertising drive
will start the last of November, ‘The
management earnestly desires that all
students who can secure ads for the
annual from parents or friends will do
so. The solicitors will work Charlotte,

Winston-Salem, Greensboro, States-
ville, Mooresville and Davidson. A
large part of the advertising is secured
from the alumni, The foreign adver-
tising has already been written for.

The 1923 Quips and Cranks will
consist of about 250 pages. The backs
will probably be of leather. ‘Two spe-
cial features will be the beauty section
and the two-color plates. The beauty
section will be larger than ever before
as each of the four literary societies
will have a sponsor this year. ‘The
plates until this year have been in only
one color, There will be a comic sec-
tion which will correspond to the Gos-
siper of last year. It has not yet been
decided what this section shall be
called, and all suggestions to this end
will be appreciated if turned in to the
editor of this department.

If any of the students have kodak
pictures featuring campus life, art con-
tributions, or contributions to the cal-
endar they should turn them in to the
heads of the respective departments.
The staff is composed of the following
men.

W. S. Buchanan—Fditor in Chief.

SENIORS DEFEATED BY
SOPHOMORES, 27-16

The Soph wrecking crew passed the
second mile post on their way to the
championship by trimming the Seniors
Tuesday night, 27-16. The guarding
was close in the first half and neither
team was passing accurately. The
Sophs ran up an eight-point lead before
the Seniors could score but the cham-
pions came back with three markers
and the half ended with the score, 8-3.

In the first period, the Sophs in-
creased their advantage of five points
to an 11-point lead and the game ended
27-16. Starting off the period, Morri-
son, Mitchell, Anderson and Staley
each rang up a field goal putting the
score 16-3.

The Seniors then rallied and made
four points on a long shot by Bostick
and two free throws by Bradley. Brad-
ley and Staley each. tallied one on a
double foul by Staley and Gentry made
the count stand 18-8. Joe Bostick
made two more goals and the Sophs
gained on the Seniors the rest of the
way, winding up with an 11-point
margin.

Staley was high point man for the
evening with a total of 19 points. Mor-
rison and Koenig guarded their men
like leeches and*seldom did the cham-
pions get under the basket. Joe Bos-
tick’s work on the floor stood out for
the Seniors while Bradley's accurate
foul shooting helped pile up the score.
