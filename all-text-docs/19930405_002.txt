Kirkland, Randolph Represent Davidson at 1993 NCSL

By Alice Felmlee

The Davidson delegation to
the North Carolina Student Legis-
lature (NCSL) recently attended
the 56th Annual Legislative Ses-
sion at the Old State Capital Build-
ing in Raleigh.

The students debated bills
written by fellow college students
from all over the state, simulated
roles of Representatives, Senators,
Speaker of the House, Bill Com-
mittee Chairs and others. In addi-
tion, they met with members of our
state legislature to discuss issues
such as the proposed tuition in-
' crease throughout the UNC sys-

tem.

Annual Session (this year held
March 24-28) is the most impor-
tant event of the Student Legisla-
ture; however, the organization is
active throughout the year, provid-
ing all college students in North
Carolina with the opportunity to
mimic government in action, as
well as influence policy directions
in the state.

A constitutional amendment
bill by Anni Kirkland and Mary
Randolph dealing with religious
discrimination was awarded Best
Bill introduced in the House of
Representatives during the recent

session. Unfortunately and de-
spite much lobbying the bill be-
came stuck in a Senate committee
and was never signed.

The Governor of the NCSL,
Becca Norton of UNC-Chapel Hill,
signed bills legalizing gay mar-
riages, permitting repeat sex of-
fenders to choose chemical castra-
tion in return forreduced jail time,
and establishing an education trust
fund to be used by school districts
interested in moving to a year-
round school system.

hibiting discrimination in adop-
tion proceedings, and imposing

feelings.

Three Davidson women de-
scribed their personal circum-
stances of sexual assault. One
speaker who wishes only to be
identified here as Jenn also spoke
at the first Take Back the Night at
Davidson because she realizes the

significance both to her peers and
herself. At age ten, she was raped
by acamp counselor but managed
to put the incident out of her mind
until she was seventeen. Since
facing the truth, Jenn has gained
strength through sharing her story
in order to increase awareness and
sensitivity about the issue.

The second speaker, sopho-

more Mary Randolph, accounted
multiple accounts of sexual assault
including an incident witha teacher
in kindergarten as well as situa-
tions of acquaintance rape in high
school.

Another sophomore described
an encounter during her senior year
of high school at a roommate’s
party. She meta college man who
invited her to take a walk outside.

’ He eventually raped her on the

ground by the side of the road. She
and Randolph both emphasized the
involvement of alcohol in their situ-
ations but that alcohol could by no
means be held solely accountable.

Following a prayer led by
Assistant Chaplain, Brenda Tapia,
half of the audience moved outside
the Union fora march around cam-
pus. The procession of about 75
people walked through dark areas
holding candles and chanting a
variety of chants including, “Yes
means yes/ No means no/ What-
ever we wear/ Wherever we go”
and, “Take Back the Night/ The
time is near/ We will not be/ con-
trolled by fear.”

failed on the floor and were never
sent to the Governor. Represent-
ing Davidson were Anni Kirkland
as Speaker Pro Tempore of the
House, Mary Randolph in the Sen-
ate, and Frank Gibbes in the House.
Debate, although guided by parlia-
mentary procedure as is used in
Congress and State Legislatures,
was always heated, usually well-
researched and articulate, andnever
dull.

The state-level organization
wishes to enlarge its membership
to include as many North Carolina
undergrads as possible in the del-

egations from each school. The

leaders to find a voice, learn, and
influence decision making.

Through participation in
NCSL, Davidson students may also
attend the United States Collegiate
Congress (USCC) in July. USCC
is a Similar student-run model leg-
islature comprised of members
from state student legislatures all
over the country.

Davidson students interested
in either the NCSL or USCC should
speak with sophomore Anni
Kirkland, the Davidson Delega-
tion Chairperson.
