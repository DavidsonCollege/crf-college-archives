Moliere’s Tartuffe combines comedy and love

By ANDY BALL
Moliere’s Tartuffe, the Thea-
ter Department’s major spring
production, is a light-hearted
comedy of deceit, gullibility and
general tomfoolery, with a dose of
romantic love thrown in for fun.

The story skips lightly from
scene to scene with enough twists
and tus in the plot to keep things
interesting for the play’s entire
length. The several backdrops
with their casually draped tapes-
tries and long shadows would al-

most be spooky were it not for the
comedic theme. And, oh yeah, the
dialogue rhymes. It’s an interest-
ing experience to listen to a play's
conversations when every other
line sounds like it’s straight from a
Hallmark greeting card.
Basically, Tartuffe is a play
about one man, Tartuffe, who
fools another man, Orgon, into
believing a false show of religious
piety. Tartuffe takes extreme ad-
vantage of every bit of charity he
is given, to the detriment of
Orgon’s home and family. Al-

though Tartuffe is a comedy, I
sometimes found myself relating
Tartuffe’s self-appointed saintli-
ness to a few of today’s more
prominent religious TV
evangelists.

The character of Tartuffe is
excellently played by Chris Light-
bown. He becomes a real snake-
in-the-grass not only with his act-
ing ability but also with his stark
costuming and gaunt make-up.
Dan Michaelis, a veteran of
Davidson productions, gives a

superb performance as Orgon, the
bumbling victim of Tartuffe’s
cunning. Donna Peters, as the
ever-wise servant Dorine, pro-
vides most of the laughs through-
out the play. Jim Dillon also gives
a shining performance as the
clear-minded Cleante Shorter.

Impressive performances are
also given by Noe! Brewster as El-
mire; Cameron Dougan and
Catherine Norton as the lovers
Valere and Marianne, respec-
tively; John Black as the hot-

Lolita ‘deflates any and every pretension’

By MARK CHEN

Lolita is a comedy without
laughter. Which doesn’t mean it
isn’t funny. Which doesn’t mean
you'll feel great and happy when
you leave the theater. Which
doesn't mean you won't be given
profound ideas over which to
mull. Which doesn’t mean you'll
have to discuss it at the next sec-
tion meeting of Humes. Which
doesn’t mean you won't enjoy the
viscious satire, the unbridled
cynicism, and general doubt as to
the rationality of modern men and
women.

Lolita is in black and white
and is set in the great, modern, en-
lightened era of the 1950s. It is
based on the novel of the same
name by Vladimir Nabokov.
Stanley Kubrick, the director of
2001 and A Clockwork Orange,
directed this screen adaptation.

James Mason plays Humbert
Humbert, a literate man of letters
who has taken a position at a very
liberal liberal arts college. But he
must find a place to stay for the
summer, so he goes to the home of
Mrs. Dolores Hayes. She is quite
willing to let a room at a very
nominal fee. Dr. Humbert is
doubtful about the lodgings until
he spies a very nice attraction.

This is Mrs. Hayes’ daughter
Lolita, aged fifteen. She offers
very interesting possibilities to
this middle-aged but handsome
man. Dr. Humbert quickly con-
cludes his living arrangements.

What follows after that is
about three or four different
movies. Which movie you see de-
pends on which view of Dr. Hum-
bert you take. The first view is his
perspective. He is a man of great
culture who is far above the
frivolities of life. He looks at life
dispassionately, noting the absurd
behavior of those around him in
his journal. But then Lolita comes
into his life. She is a vision of such
innocence and beauty that Dr.
Humbert gives his whole exis-
tence to the pursuit of her. All in
all Dr. Humbert is a man caught in
the banality of existence, lost in
the pursuit of love.

In the view of Dolores Hayes,
played by Shelley Winters, Dr.
Humbert is a wonderful man who
is a godsend after seven years of
lonely widowhood. In bed he is
“so good.” Which is not to say that
Dolores Hayes has only the phys-
ical in mind, for she is the chair-
man of the Great Books commit-
tee of her women’s club. He is “so
wonderful” and she will give any-

thing to serve him and make him
happy — until she finds out that
she is the “cow” in his journal.
Not only is he insulting, but he is a
sneaky pervert going
after . . . but no, it’s too horrible
to say. Dolores Hayes is a woman

who has been very ill-used by her
lover and her daughter.

Sue Lyons plays the lovely
nymph Lolita. She doesn’t have as
many problems as Humbert or
Dolores because she has many
other things in her life she does to
pacify herself. 1) There is her bub-
ble gum. 2) She is happiest with a
plate of French fries and a malt. 3)
When in doubt, she falls asleep. 4)
Her greatest fear in life is bore-

dom. She can’t stand being bored.
When bored, she runs away. The
worst thing is that Humbert can be
so boring. He reads Keats to her
and won't let her see “filthy
boys.” Her mom orders her
around. They're both so boring.

Then there is the view of the
artsy TV writer Clare Quilty,
played by Peter Sellers. He is al-
ways on the lookout for new talent
and finds it in Lolita. Once he sees
her talent, he cannot let her lan-
guish in obscurity. So he goes
chasing off in pursuit over most of
the United States. He gets his
chance eventually, for Lolita is a
pretty willing victim. She makes
for a good time for a while.

All these people meet and bus-
ily set out to hoodwink, entrap,
and sucker each other. They are so
busy in these mind games that it
becomes impossible to know who
is fooling and who is fooled. A
person could see Humbert as a
dirty old man who corrupts an in-
nocent child. Lolita gives some
proof for that view, for she usually
acts like a very bored child on a
very long car trip. But then Lolita
“just happens” to extend her leg in
his face or look very innocently at
Humbert. She gives off the most
offhand yet potent sexuality. And

Fortner talks about life in Davidson

By NELLE MCCORKLE

Jim Fortner has lived on Wal-
nut Street since 1947. He was
born in a house across the street.
His first job, as a seven-year-old
in 1921, consisted of walking
cows to and from a Concord Road
pasture; his wages were twenty-
five cents a week.

Orphaned at age 14, Fortner
said, “I lost my mother and two
sisters in five weeks.” To support
himself, Fortner said, “I have
even picked cotton.” He has also
worked as a dishwasher at L.J.
Hannah's Cafe, now the site of
Conder Insurance Company. He
has lived continuously in David-
son except for four years spent in
Marshville, North Carolina dur-
ing World War II.

A favorite Fortner story con-
cerns his meeting and subsequent

marriage to Mrs. Fortner, then
Madge Malcolm. Fortner delights
in telling the story in his wife's
presence. “The courtship lasted
about a year and a half,” Fortner
said, “and I was in second place
when we began.”

Fortner first saw his wife-to-
be as she and another girl left a
Methodist Youth Fellowship
meeting. A friend walking down
the street with Fortner introduced
himself and Fortner to the two
girls.

Soon after, Fortner began to
visit his future wife at her family’s
home in Cornelius. “I was wash-
ing dishes for the cafe where I was
getting my meals,” Fortner said.
“She had to be in bed by 10. At
9:30, he’d [Mrs. Fortner’s father]
hit his shoe on the floor and that

the mile and a half to the Malcolm
house because I wouldn’t get off
work ‘til 7:30.”

“Shortly after, she moved five
miles out inthe country . . . Itre-
ally didn’t allow much time for
visiting. Later on, I began to see
that wasn’t going to work, so I
began to talk her into marriage.
Finally, I talked her into saying
she would marry me, but she
wouldn't ask him [her father], be-
cause she said he would never
consent. We decided to elope,
which we did. It was to be a sec-
ret, but she told her best friend,
and it was no longer a secret.”

“A lot of our friends said it
wouldn't last, and that was 53
years ago.” The Fortners now
have seven grandchildren and one
great-grandchild. On the Fort-

sary, their family hosted a recep-
tion at the Davidson Methodist
Church.

A graduate of Davidson High
School, Fortner sent his three chil-
dren to college. “No member of
my family had ever finished high
school, and I wanted to graduate,”
he said of himself. “[We had to]
moonlight to send our kids to
school.” In order to do this, they
managed Davidson’s movie
theatre. “I can remember when the
highlight of the weekend was the
Saturday night movie in the old
gymnasium, in which they only
had one projection machine and
no girls there. . .”

From 1933 until his retirement
in 1979, Fortner worked at David-
son’s Carolina Asbestos Com-
pany, beginning as a laborer.

headed Damis; Beth Parker as the
prudish (and whistle-toting)
Mme. Pernelle; Wayne Magruder
as M. Loyal; Richard Sheridan as
the police officer; and Julia
Cardwell as Flipote.

All in all, the theatrical depart-
ment has come up with an excel-
lent cast and crew and a real win-
ner of a show. Tartuffe is defi-
nitely worth your time and money
these last days of Spring Term.

Tartuffe is playing both this
and next weekend.

she is ready, willing, and able.
Lolita soons drives Humbert into a
ridiculous obsession.

The games go on until all roles
get reversed and reversed again.
But what is the object of this
game? To say that love is the sub-
ject of this movie is absurd, for
never has romance been such a
sorry humbug. But sex is not the
issue either. If it were, then every-
one in the movie could settle
things comfortably and without
fuss. So why are these people
making fools of themselves? The
answer (if there is one) seems to
be that all these people are driven
by illusions. Love is a lie and sex
is a mess. Sex would be easier if
we treated it like eating or dating.
But we keep messing it up with
our illusions.

Of course you can reject this
idea and say that Nabokov is a
cynic. Or you could just ignore the
Big Idea and enjoy the movie as
nasty satire. The movie is full of
sly jokes that deflate any and
every pretension. The acting is
good, the story is good, and the
camera work sets up some won-
derful scenes. I’m not going to say
more, so you’ll have to go see it
yourself. It will be shown in Love
Auditorium on Saturday.

“Thirteen years later, I was plant
manager,” Fortner said. During
these years, Fortner also belonged
to the volunteer fire department.
He and his wife chaperoned local
teenagers at the Teen Canteen,
now the college’s Carolina Inn.

“The Davidson Methodist
Church has honored me with
every position you can have. I’ve
been a Methodist for 62 years,”
Fortner said. Now an adult Sun-
day school teacher, Fortner is past
superintendent of the Sunday
school and chairman of the Ad-
ministrative Board.

“If I’ve obtained any success,
it’s because I’ve learned to get
along with people,” Fortner said.
“We've had a lot of setbacks, but
the Lord always made a way.”
