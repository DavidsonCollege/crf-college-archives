Davidson showed off the leather, but the bats carried the Wildcats all weekend.

Are Wildcat sports underfunded?

Every season, Davidson’s athletic teams
battle some of the most talented and presti-
gious programs in the nation, and they give
this school a reason to both cheer the victo-

the wins and losses, however, fail to fully
account for the achievement of our athletic
programs.

What the casual fan does not realize is
how difficult it is for Davidson to compete
even at the level it does now, given the finan-
cial and academic constraints put on the var-
ious teams.

Along with teammate Steve Mayo ‘o7, Dillon fired a
team-low 219 in the three day Southern Conference
Championship, including a 71 on the final day. His per-
formance helped the team to finish third, their best place
in over 30 years. Dillon was also the only Davidson golfer
to be placed on the All SoCon second-team.

It had been almost two years since the
Wildcats earned a series sweep in the
Southern Conference, dating back to an April
2003 tilt with The Citadel, but Davidson
erased that streak this past weekend when
the ’Cats won three straight against
Appalachian State at Wilson Field.

Davidson opened the week against No. 7
UNC Chapel Hill, and the Tar Heels jumped

on the Wildcats early by plating three runs in ~

the first against Wildcat starter Brian Packey
08. :
That three-run outburst was more than
enough for a Tar Heel staff that boasted a
nation-best 2.02 team ERA coming into the
game. Packey settled down after the rough
first inning, but Davidson posed little offen-
sive threat the rest of the game in the 4-0
loss.

Davidson then returned home to host
a three-game weekend series with
Appalachian State on Friday, and the
*Cats looked to move up in the confer-
encé standings and above .500 for the
first time since a strong early-season
run.

The ’Cats got off to a good start early
against the Mountaineers on Friday,

Regardless of whether the men’s soc-
cer team makes the NCAA Tournament
or the lacrosse team records a losing
season, the community rarely credits
the performances by both the student
athletes and the coaching staffs.

Upon deeper inspection, each team’s
accomplishment is a remarkable one, to
say the least.

An uneven playing field

This fall, men’s soccer defeated
Furman 2-1 in a thrilling overtime
match-up. The box score reflects an overall
dominance by the ’Cats, including a 14-8
advantage in shots-on-goal, but the box score
does not do justice to the true difference
between the two programs.

Furman is perhaps Davidson’s closest peer
in the Southern Conference; a small, liberal
arts college that has a strong academic repu-
tation and annually competitive athletic
teams.

In sports, though, Furman should have a
huge upper hand from the outset. In soccer,
for example, Furman offers eight total schol-
arships for its men’s team, just short of the
9.9 allowed under NCAA regulation.
Davidson, on the. other hand, receives just
over four scholarships per season for men’s
soccer.

The scholarship difference is not limited to
just soccer, or to just Furman, but rather to

jumping out to a two-run lead in the first
inning on an Andrew Musashe ’05 double
and a Jay Heafner ’06 home run. The ’Cats
added another run in the third, capitalizing
on sloppy defense by the Mountaineers to
take a 3-0 lead.

In the fourth inning, Appalachian State
roughed up Davidson starter Andy Carter
05, scoring six runs on six hits and two
errors. Carter remained in the game, howev-
er, and he pitched two more shutout innings
before turning it over to the bullpen.

Trailing 6-3, the "Cats offense refused to
go away quietly, as Davidson responded with
an unearned run in the bottom of the fourth
and three runs in the bottom of the fifth due
to a series of Mountaineer errors. The ’Cats
added another run in the bottom of the sixth
off of an Eli Benefield ’06 double that scored
Heafner.

almost all Wildcat teams and their respective
opponents.

Even Davidson’s hallmark program, men’s
basketball, is not funded to the same extent
as most Division I programs. Believe it or
not, even the Paladins provide more scholar-
ships to their basketball team than Davidson.

Furthermore, a large portion of Davidson’s
maximum scholarship allotment requires
academic success.

Men’s soccer provides 4.4 scholarships
annually, but part of the monetary allotment
comes from the Davidson Scholar Program,
which mandates that each recipient be in the
top 50 percent of the incoming class.

“(DSP is] a great program,” said head soc-
cer coach Matt Spear ’93. “We use our dol-
lars not to buy players, but rather to rewarc
them.”

Sam Navarro’s (705) game winning home run

With the game tied 8-8 in the seventh inning, Navarro

launched one out of the park to give the ‘Cats a 9-8 win

over Appalachian State. In the two other games of the

series, Navarro went 5-7, hitting another home run and
batting in five runners.
