Despite loss, hope persists for Wildcats

By Mike AN ANDERSON

Staff W Writer

Saturday’s showdown against conference
powerhouse Chattanooga had all the mak-
ings of a natural disaster for the women’s
basketball team.

The Lady Mocs entered Belk Arena witha
daunting 7-0 mark, having beaten Southern
Conference oppo-
nents by an aver-
age of 21 points
per game. The
Wildcats—still
enduring growing
pains over the
early course of this
rebuilding season—had dropped six of seven
SoCon match-ups by an average of 16 points.

Yet the Wildcats refused to go down with-
out a fight Saturday.

“IT wrote on the board that today’s game
was more about getting respect than giving
it,” said head coach John Filar. “Today was
a matter of getting some respect, of winning
some pride back.”

Sure enough, Filar’s goal was accom-
plished. Davidson finished the game strongly,
getting outscored by only five points in the
second half en route to a 78-60 loss.

Chattanooga, for perspective, knocked off
the conference’s second best team, UNC
Greensboro, by 16 on January 13.

Three different Wildcats led the way with
14 points apiece: Janna Magette, Kim Taylor
and Kelly Copland. Copland and Taylor also
combined for 17 rebounds, leading the Wild-
cats in a dominating effort on the boards (41
rebounds compared to Chattanooga’s 30).

“That (rebounding) is an exciting stat for
us,” Filar said.

“People hit the boards big time,” said
Copland. “There were times when you’d see
three white jerseys fighting for the same
rebound.”

Ashley Hallsted’s three-pointer at the 14:49
mark cut the Mocs’ lead to five, but Davidson
never got any closer.

“Chattanooga is one of the most talented
teams—if not the most talented team—to
ever play in the Southern Conference,” Filar
said.

Though conference player of the year
Damita Bullock had a quiet night, Chatta-
nooga freshman Miranda Warfield lit up the
scoreboard with 22 points in just 26 minutes
of action.

“Tt hurts to lose,” says Copland. “But if we
can run with Chattanooga, we know we can
run with anybody.”

That type of confidence will be just what
this team needs as the second round of con-
ference action nears.

Slow out of the gate during the first half of
this transitional season, Davidson captured
just one victory (over
winless Appalachian
State) in the first go-
round—a stretch that in-
cluded six double-digit
losses including a 39-
point debacle at UNCG.

as the season continues.

“We need to play every game from here on
out with the effort and intensity that we
showed today,” said coach Filar. “We need to
do that and we need to make our shots. Our
defense has improved 100% since two or
three weeks ago even.”

The Wildcats return to action on Saturday
when they travel to East Tennessee State.
The Lady Bucs defeated Davidson 80-69
December 6 at Belk Arena.

Filar hopes that the first round of confer-
ence action afforded his youthful team with a
taste and familiarity of Division-I basketball.

“We often forget as a staff that for 50
percent of our team, this is the first time
seeing opponents in the Southern Confer-
ence,” he said.

Added Magette: ““We’re gonna be a lot
more experienced this go-‘round.”
