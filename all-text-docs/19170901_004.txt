The DAVIDSONIAN September 1, 1917

DR. MARTIN WRITES
LETTER TO STUDENTS

(Continued from page 1)
"19, graduates of Oglethorpe ‘Training
Camp, but discharged on account of
physical deficiencies, will assist, and are
well prepared to do so.

Uniforms will be decided on after
college opens. They will not be ex-
pensive, and will be such as will be use-
ful after college is over.

The college will work with its usual
high efficiency, and we hope for a full
student body of men of serious purpose.
T cordially suggest to all Davidson men
in these last few days before college
opens that they encourage young men
of serious purpose and proper prepara-
tion to enroll in their old college.

Cordially yours,
Won. J. Martin,
President.

WHAT A FATHER
OWES HIS CHILDREN

By Rev. Walter L. Lingle, D.D.

“A father owes his children a Chris-
tian education. Practically all fathers
recognize that they owe their children
an education. But there are still mul-
titudes of professing Christian men who
do not seem to realize that they owe
their children a Christian education. It
is passing strange that fathers and moth-
ers will bring up their children with the
greatest care in the nurture and admont-
tion of the Lord until they are 16 or 17
years of age, and then send them off to
a school or college without the slightest
inquiry into the religious influences of
that school or college. As a result many
of the boys and girls from our Christian
homes are being sent to schools and col-
leges where their minds and morals are
poisoned for life. 1 have seen one splen-
did young fellow after another go from
Christian homes to such colleges and
have seen them return utterly indiffer-
ent to religion. When you think of
sending your child to college your first
question ought to be: ‘What will be
the moral and spiritual influences of
that college on my child?’ Fathers, you
awe your children a Christian educa-
tion.

NEW WATER TANK
NOW BEING USED

The new 80,000 gallon tank is being
used to supply the water for the college.
The two tanks on the roof of the south
wing of Chambers have been taken
down and the roof repaired. This is
only one of the improvements that have
been made since commencement. The
flag now floats at the top of the new
one hundred and twenty foot steel pole.
At the base. ir. the concrete foundation,
which extends some two feet above the
ground, is a plate bearing the insertp-
tion, “Presented by the class of 1917.’

COLLEGE DIRECTORY.

It was thought best by the manage-
ment to postpone the publishing of the
College Directory until after the open-
ing.

If you have any old phonograph rec-
ords that you are tired of, bring them
with you and give them to the Y. M.
A. Social Center. The phonograph has
been sent off for repairs, but we hope to
have it back and going fine when school
opens.

DAVIDSON MAN WRITES
A MILITARY MANUAL

the 1sth Calvary, U. S. Army, has writ-
ten a book entitled, “Selective Service
Manual.” Mr. James graduated from
West Point in 1910. The book is not
only intended for prospective soldiers.

THE SCHEDULF.

We regret. very much the fact that
we were unable to publish the schedule
of recitations in this issue of THE Dav-
IDSONIAN. Several alterations were
made necessary by Dr. Lingle’s de-
parture for France, and we were unable
to secure the desired schedule at the
necessary time.
