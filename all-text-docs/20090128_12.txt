Nostradamus MC’s

Apocalyptic Step
Show

Duke Family Performance
Hall — Sororities and fraternities
from schools around the state sent
groups of performers to David-
son’s campus to participate in the
third annual “Revelation of the
Divine Greek Step Show.” In what
has been called “an innocent mix-
up,” confusion about the host of
the show left many in the audience
scratching their heads.

Many Davidson students were
excited to see Nasir Jones, better
known by his stage name “Nas-

tradamus” or simply “Nas,” but
“_. the planets will

align and the sky will
burn.”

were greeted instead by a bearded,
prophesying Frenchman. Nostrad-
amus, born Michel de Nostredame
in 16th-century France, is a legend-
ary seer, healer and author. None-
theless, he seemed out of place as
he MC’d the step show.

“Homie was out of it,” audi-
ence member Monica Rodriguez
noted. Nostradamus first argued
to reschedule the show for Dec.
12, 2012, “when the planets align
and the very sky will burn!” Rather
than the “Tllmatic” encore Nas was
expected to deliver, Nostradamus
went on to praise the wonders of
bloodletting as a plague/hangover
remedy but was astonished that hu-
man waste was found only in front
of the senior apartments.

Nostradamus was taken aback
not only by plumbing, but by the
thousands of technological innova-
tions that have become common-
place in our “Hell-fated kingdom.”

“Your magic music contraption
is wondrous!” he exclaimed, exam-
ining an iPod. “Tt truly is regrettable
that humanity has come so far, only
to be wiped away in a whirlwind of
poisons and collapsing planets.”

When asked what he thought
about the night’s performances,
Nostradamus smiled and nodded
his head. “These cats got a heavy
step. Shit was tight.” Nostradamus
closed the performance with an im-
promptu freestyle rap. Though in
some verses his meter and diction
were out-dated, many students re-
garded his lyrics as the highlight of
the night. A particular favorite was
his closing verse:

“Seas will thunder

And pull the world under!

The paupers will perish

as will the rich:

the Apocalypse

gonna be a bitch.”

Republicans Concerned about Size
of Obama’s Stimulus Package

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- With
President Barack Obama whipping
out his enormous stimulus package,
currently valued at $825 billion,
Republican critics have raised their
voices in protest. House minority
leader John Boehner stiffened with
objection during meetings earlier
this week.

“This
package is
too big, too
unwieldy,
ig and reckless

A in general.
me I don’t see
A startled Boehner how we can

really control

the thrust of it.
I can barely wrap my head around
the package we’re facing.”

“I can barely wrap my
head around the pack-
age we’re facing.”

Other representatives in the
Capitol shared similar sentiments.
Senator Richard Little (R, Dela-
ware) worried that the Obama
package would create a problem of
overstimulation.

“We really have to consider
whether or not this is what the
American people want. Are they
prepared to take a package of this
size?”

Critics of the package are wor-
ried that some of its measures will
inevitably stretch the common
American far beyond his or her
comfort levels. Another concern is
the apparent lack of protection to
go along with a package that will
touch millions of Americans.

President Obama plans to in-
clude specific information about the
package in a government-run web
site. The hope, said a senior advi-
sor, is that “by putting this package
on the internet, which is already the
number one package resource in
the world, we should be able to in-
crease stimulus interest, awareness
and participation. The more people
stimulated, the better.”

Democrat Rod Johnson, one of
the authors of the bill, asked critics
to be patient.
Due in part
to the pack-
age’s large-
size, he said,
it could take
as long as
two years
for the pack-
age to reach
full potency.

Obama promises
“If we give the package is well-
developed ,

the package the
time and attention it deserves, there
should be enough to go around for
everybody. I can only hope that this
stimulating package doesn’t shrink
in a cold sea of partisan criticism.”

Middle-School Boys Protest
Davidson-Charlotte Commuter Rail

Davidson — Scores of pubescent
boys and concerned members of
the community gathered Tuesday
to protest the development of a rail-
way service between Mooresville
and downtown Charlotte. Con-
cers about noise, cost and overex-
pansion were listed but the primary
issue was a sentimental one.

“We risk losing access to an im-
portant part of the American tradi-
tion. If we give up these train tracks,
where do our youth mature?”

American folklore has long
romanticized little-used railways.
The protesters fear that: refurbish-
ing and frequent use of the David-
son line will prevent small bands of
boys from rambling along, getting
to know each other better, and fi-
nally standing up to their bullying
big brothers.

“Tf we lose this treasure of folk-
lore, how will the youth of Char-
lotte-Mecklenberg County come to

Cornelius middleschoolers on
their way to adventure, discovery,
and adulthood

terms with the maturation of their
bodies and minds? They need to be
able to enjoy a swimming hole and
cook hot dogs on branches every
once in a while,”.5th grade English
teacher Diane Aldridge said.

The youngsters themselves
were especially concerned. “I
don’t see how else my friends and I
can get the true bildungsroman ex-
perience without those train tracks.
Plus, I really want to carry around a
handkerchief on a:stick.”
