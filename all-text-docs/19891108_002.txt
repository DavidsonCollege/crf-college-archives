Golf, music, science and politics around the world

Watson Fellowship finalists share their proposals

By MARGARET CARROLL
Last week Davidson announced its
four nominees for the Watson Fellow-
ship competition. These four individu-
als have proposed to study an area of
special interest for the year following
graduation. Ap-
proximately 75
fellowships are
awarded each
year throughout
the country.
Those _ selected
are: Gates Grain-
ger and Muadi
Mukenge, both
political science
majors; Katherine
MacDonald, a
psychology ma-
jor; and Jonathan
Darsey, a Center
major in Mexican
development
studies.
Grainger’s pro-
posal is to study
and experience golf in
the three biggest golf
countries outside of the
United States: Japan,
Australia and Great
Britain. Grainger hopes
tocompare the attitudes
of the nations and the
culture toward golf and
to trace its development
in these countries. ,
Because he is inter-
ested in sports, Grain-
ger wanted to investi-
gate the ways that

months in Japan, four in Australia and
two in Great Britain. He will travel and
also play in golf tournaments overseas.
Grainger said, “I proposed to study golf
because I wanted to propose something
thatI would enjoy doing. That’s why it’s
a unique, maybe even
bizarre, original pro-
posal.”

Mukenge’s proposal is
to do research on three
types of African-based
music: soca, zouk and
congolese. Since African
rhythms are increas-
ingly being incorpo-
rated into Western
styles, she deems it use-
ful to discover the na-
ture of the music. She
will travel to Trinidad,
home to soca; Martin-
ique, home to zouk; and
Zaire, home to congo-
lese. While there,
Mukenge will study the
styles’ characteris-
tics, performance
and instrumenta-
tion; observe how
music is a reflec-
tion of national
culture and dis-
cuss how politics
has aided or ham-
pered the. music
industry.

Mukenge,
originally from
Zaire, has just in
the past two years
become familiar
with African and

tries express themselves Caribbean_ popu-
through golf and why it ; lar music and con-
appeals to groups MuadiMukenge siders musicas her

within the countries.
Grainger explained that he chose Japan
because it is “golf crazy,” adding that it
costs several million dollars to join a
country club there and that people must
reserve tee-off times months in ad-
vance.

Grainger plans to spend about six

vocation. She sees
this proposal as a rare opportunity to
find out moreabout Africancultureand
even plans tolearn how to play two per-
cussion instruments. Mukenge will
spend three months in each place and
then go to Europe and look at the styles
as they are manifested in European cul-

ture.
While in Trinidad, Mukenge hopes to
attend the annual masquerade-style
Carnival in which musicians from all
over the Carribbean perform. Mukenge
said, “I will have direct access to the
music and the musicians.
I will be able torecord jam
sessions, conduct inter-
views, attend perform-
ances, and conduct li-
brary research.”
MacDonald’s proposal
is to conduct research in
neuroscience at the Uni-
versity of Munich with
Bernard Sable, M.D., and
in Argentina with Enri-
que Torre, M.D. She
hopes to research Parkin-

Alzheimer’s patients. When she came to
Davidson, she continued her interest by
working with laboratory rats.

Darsey’s proposal is to go to Mexico,
Spain and Nicaragua to talk to politi-
cians, intellectualsand business leaders
about how these
countries are
moving from au-
thoritarian
forms of govern-
ment to liberali-
zation. Darsey
did research on
the subject in San
Diego this sum-
mer and became
highly interested
in the Mexican
political situ-

son’s and Alzheimer’s ation. For the
diseases, noting in par- first time in Mex-
ticular how scientific ree YO ¥ ico’s history, the
search in these twocoun- Jonathan Darsey PRI (Institu-

tries is affected by the
economy and
other factors.
MacDonald
will work with
Sable, whose re-
search relates to
Parkinson’sand
Alzheimer’s.
She will also
work with
Torre, whose re-
search consists
of a molecular
approach to
brain injuries.
MacDonald will
conduct studies
with rats with
brain lesions.
She plans to
study the proc-
ess called
sprouting,
whereby neurons in the rat’s brain re-
cover from injuries. aa
MacDonald became interested in
neuroscience while doing an internship
at the Duke hospital neuroscience divi-
sion, where she worked primarily with

tionary Party) lost a state
election (in Baja Califor-
nia). In the last presiden-
tial election the PRI only
won by a small majority.

Darsey said that this is

the first time that the PRI
has been open and honest
about the actual election
results in the country. In
the past, it has either
rigged elections or denied
opposing political parties.
Darsey also noted that
since the autocrat General
Francisco Franco died in
1975, Spain has had more
of a western democratic
government. Nicaragua is
also scheduled to have free
elections in the upcoming

year.

Each of these countries
has been morereceptive to foreign capi-
tal and trade. Darsey wants tostudy not
only the history behind these move-
ments toward liberalization butalso the
effects and influences ypon the com-
mon people in each of the countries.
