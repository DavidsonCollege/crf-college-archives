DAVIDSON, N.C. — The Davidson College Sym-
phony Orchestra gave its annual spring concert
last Thursday evening at 8:00 p.m. in Love Audi-

torium. The full orchestral ensemble was greeted
by ahealthy assortment of faculty, staff, students,
and community members, who had come to pay
witness to the final concert in this, the DCSO’s
fifth year of existence.

The concert program consisted of Mozart’s
Overture to “The Magic Flute” and Lalo’s Cello

Press RELEASE

Encomiast, the album from what is probably
Davidson’ s only dark ambient project, is currently
available online at www.mp3.com/encomiast. For
those of you unfamiliar with this genre of music,
it discards conventional ideas of melody and har-
mony, and frequently tempo, in favor of a flowing
and spatial quality, to numbing effect. It has been
described as music for “the music lover who can
sit and enjoy the evolving sound of someone else’s

nightmare,” to quote the web site for Cold Meat
Industry, one of the leading record labels of post-
industrial electronic music. Encomiast contains
45 minutes of dark soundscapes in both audio and
mp3 format from Ross Hagen and features
“concupere,” a 30-minute ambient jam session
that features the sonic manipulations of Nick Paul.
Plans are being made to have CDs available here
in the near future, but the album is only available
online at www.mp3.com/encomiast or through
special arrabgements at the present. For more
information contact Ross at extension 6365.

der of the corpulent orchestra played Beethoven’s
symphony with spirit and precision, in an impres-
sive display of technique considering the diffi-
culty of the repertoire.

The crowd gave a standing ovation upon
