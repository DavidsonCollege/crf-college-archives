as Stone does. Nevertheless, he’s
doing very well right where he is,
and should be able to stay around
for a while.

On the other hand, there are so
many others out there who can
deliver great songs, but whom I
would not consider to be the kind
of song-after-song tested and de-
pendable artists that can really be
put among the cream of the crop.

Billy Dean can deliver a great

one, but he sometimes tends to-
ward the sappy. Suzy Boggus also
has the potential to give listeners
and audiences a wonderful rendi-
tion of so-so songs. All she needs
is areally good set of tunes to take
her to the next level. Joe Diffie?

won’t break into the elite. Holly
Dunn and Lorrie Morgan may have
seen their big chances come and
go. When she releases her first
album on her new label, Epic
Records, Patty Loveless will take
one more good crack at regaining
ground, trying torecover her popu-

Kershaw, Collin Raye, Marty
Stuart? Not quite .. . and the list

we hope you will go see it for
yourselves, so we aren’t going to
give away too much. We will tell
you, however, that this movie has
a great cast. It isn’t hard to like
Jodie Foster — even if she did go

imagine her in a “Little House on,

the Prairie” role, but apparently
she is capable of portraying a wide
range of characters. And after see-
ing this movie, the same can be
said of Richard Gere, who stars as
Jack Somersby. The prince of
“Pretty Woman” and instigator of
“Internal Affairs,” Gere this time
plays a Confederate soldier return-
ing home after six years of war.
But is he really? Mrs. Somersby
(Jodie Foster) isn’t so sure. But
we’re not going to tell you.
Whether he is or isn’t Jack
Somersby doesn’t really matter.
This movie brims over with emo-
tion, and is a terrific love story.
There are also some great action
scenes — no kickboxing — but
they do fight with torches, plus
there is even some gun-fire. We
are usually indifferent to scenery,
but in this ‘case, it struck us as
particularly beautiful, a logical
backdrop for this film. “Somersby”
is set during the Reconstruction,

and the clothes and the buildings
correspond to this perfectly.
Parts of this movie will make
you mad. Parts of this will make
you laugh out loud. But mostly
this movie will make you think.

"Damage"
Just in Time
for Oscars

By Scott McLean

‘Tt is quite unusual to have two
of the best films of the year tocome
out simultaneously so late in the
eligibility period for the Academy
Awards, but after all, we live in a
strange world. The first of these
films, “The Crying Game,” has not
yet made its Charlotte debut so I
have been unable to see it. Hope-

fully this will be remedied soon.

because at the moment it is the
hottest film in Hollywood (at least
that’s what my roomie’s “Enter-
tainment Weekly” says). There is
talk of Oscar nominations for two
of its stars, one of whom (Miranda
Richardson) is also in the second
most talked about film of the year:
French director Louis Malle’s
“Damage.” For those of you who
don’t know, Malle is Murphy
Brown’s real life hubby and his
film paints one of the darkest pic-
tures of sexual obsession that I
have seen to date. ;

The film centers around
Stephen Fleming (Oscar winner
Jeremy Irons), a minister in the
British government who is about
to be elevated to a Cabinet level

of the best musicians you can hear
in popular music. (If you think
Pearl Jam has good musicians, you
need to re-evaluate what a good
musician is.) Phish has proven that
they have the talent and creativity
to move beyond regional acts, the

much harder to come by in the
future. But with so much new
talent, you have to work harder to
get yourself noticed. Everyone,
nowadays, is “that hot new star;”
you’ ve got to be something more.
And, believe me, everyone is
searching to find out just what that
“something more” is.

Oh sure, the secret is this:~

position, At one of the numerous
socials he attends he meets the
exotic Anna Barton (Juliette

-Binoche) and what these two ac-

tors are able toconvey with glances
andnowords is incredible to watch.
Binoche’s presence alone nearly
knocks you over in your seat. The
next day Barton calls Fleming at
his office and the two get together
for an afternoon tryst. What be-
gins as just a fling becomes com-
plicated when Fleming discovers
that Barton is his son’s new girl-
friend. Though he hates himself
for what he has done, Fleming is
unable to stop himself and the af-
fair continues, even after his son
proposes to Anna and she accepts.
What ensues becomes tragic, as is
alluded to when Annatells Stephen,
“Beware of damaged people - they
know how to survive.”

The performances of Irons
and Binoche are superb to say the
least, and the fact that the audience
feels sorrow for their characters
instead of disgust is a credit to
them both. Additionally, Miranda
Richardson is excellent as
Fleming’s wife. Sheactsas though
she doesn’t see what is going on
although in her heart she knows -
the truth. While some aspects of
the plot become rather difficult to
believe, this works for the film
instead of against it by giving it
some “oomph” (no pun intended).
The first-rate cast Malle has as-
sembled gives his picture a life that
almost transcends the boundaries
of the screen. The only problem, I
believe, is that this is one of those
movies that you'll either love or
hate. Either way, it is definitely
worth the price of admission to
find out.
