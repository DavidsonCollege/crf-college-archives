Hodges’ Play
To Be Staged

Masquers Will Present “My
Chance Is Better.”

Dan Hodges has recently com-
pleted a play to be produced by
the Red and Black Masquers dur-
ing the first of May. It will be
a three-act collegiate comedy en-
titled, “My Chatce Is Better.”

The play deals with the various
of students in a small col-
and their campus problems.
problems as how to avoid
flushed for the big dance,
how to keep that high school com-
petition from captivating the inter-
of the “gal’ back home, or
how to get by without blitzkreig-
ing your pocketbook to buy her an
Easter bouquet.

The characters this
true-to-life comedy are: the typi-
cal B. M, O. C., college stud, Rotcy
cadet, newspaper reporter, and the

A leading role in the production
will be played by one of Davidson's
myriad Tryouts will
be held for this position of honor.
(See Dan Hodges any infor-
mation desired time and
place.)

An innovation to the usual Dav-
idson play will be the serving of
cold drinks and other refreshments
at reasonable prices during inter-
mission.

The Red and Black Masquers
are in hopes that some sort of en-
tertainment can be offered at in-
termission to quiet the nérves of
the atidience after the gales of
laughter which the first two acts
of the play will have provoked and
to complete a “gala” evening.
