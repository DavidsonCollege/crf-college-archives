Outing Club Members Explore

By JIM JERNIGAN
Staff Writer

Under the leadership of Scott
Schreiber, the Davidson Outing
Club will journey to the White
Mountains of Maine during the
spring break. Snowshoeing will
be the prime activity along
marked trails. Cold weather
camping will be a challenge in
itself. exclaimed Schreiber.

The group will leave March 14
from the college and return
March 20. the day before
classes resume. Specific details
of the trip will be made as soon
as a firm count of participants
has been made. Interested per-
sons should contact Schreiber.
Tom Jenkins or Tom Hatley im-
mediately.

Biology Professor Tom
Daggy has asked the Outing
Club to publicize his extended
studies’ nature inventory of
Rocky Face. A group of four to
eight students will assist Daggy
in an intensive survey of this
biologically unique mountain.

Rocky Face is an abandoned
rock quarry located 75 minutes
from Davidson near Hiddenite.
N.C. Besides its vertical face.
the mountain has a_ steeply
sloping side which supports a
varied plant and animal fauna

The Outing Club is also in-
vestigating the possibility of
establishing a co-op with the
N.C. Outward Bound program.
Duke and St. Andrews already
have programs which enable a
student to gain academic credit

Trustees Consider Budget Today

(Continued From Page 1!)
In addition to the budget. the
Finance and Management Com-
mittee will present proposals on

a new faculty-staff housing
area, medical insurance for
retired personnel, and a

proposal regarding the town’s '
development.

Mr. G. Don Davidson, chair-
man of the Religious Policy and
Programs Committee will
report on its efforts to find a
new chaplain. It is expected to
report that no one has yet been
found, but that candidates are
still being interviewed and that
we will have a chaplain by
spring.

The Development Committee
is expected to have a progress
report on the Queens-Davidson
Fund Drive. This is aneffort to
raise several million dollars
from Presbyterian synods in
North Carolina and Florida. A
large part of Davidson's share
of this money is slated to go to
the E. H. Little Library.

Dean of Students Will Terry
will present a progress report
for the Student Life and Health
Committee which has been con-
cerned with finding a new college
physician. The committee has
also been looking into working
out a plan to have a new area
clinic in Huntersville provide

. Financial Aid Affected

(Continued From Page 1)

Miller stated that the
National Association of Student
Financial Aid Administrators
is lobbying presently to have
enactment of the Basic Op-
portunity Grants delayed a year
because of the lack of time to
implement it.

“There is going to be some
kind of clash between the
Congress and the _ Ad-
ministration because of these

requests
“The Congress had approved
the Basic Opportunity Grant in
addition to the existing
, Not instead of the
Direct Student Loans and the
Supplementa! Opportunity
Grants,"’ Miller said.

An important aspect of the
new funding will be the shift to
direct government subsidy,
rather than subsidy through the

“The Basic Opportunity
Grant will be administered by
the government ; the
arrangement will be between
the government and the
student. Financial aid ad-
ministrators are somewhat

skeptical that this machinery
can be assembled in time for
next. fall, as the = ad-
Ministration's .» budget
provides,” Miller said.

The federal committment to
Davidson currently accounts
for 31 percent of the total! col-
lege expenditure for financial

health services tor the college.

Terry and Trustee W. Blair
Gwynn will present a progress
report on student housing for
the Budget. Buildings and
Grounds Committee. Cor-
nell will outline proposals tor
financing this housing.

This year’s meeting of 42
trustees will probably be the
last time that there are this
many trustees. Changes in the
by-laws were made which will
reduce the number of trustees
elected by the Presbyterian
Synods. The rules were also

changed to prevent trustees
from serving more than twelve
conseculive vears.

Other activities in the spring
