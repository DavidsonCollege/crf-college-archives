Men's soccer is learning that the road is a tough place to go

By Will Cobb

They said there wouldbesome
tough days on the field with sucha
young team, and they have come.
After going above .500 with a win
at The Citadel, the Davidson soc-
cer team has hit its longest losing
streak in over two years. The Cats
tried to break the four game losing
streak yesterday when they trav-
eled to Statesboro, GA, to face

Georgia Southern. Now the over-
all record on the season stands at 6-
9-1 with a 2-1 conference record.

The skids hit only four days
after their last win when the Cats

faced UNC-Greensboro. After 90

minutes of play the twoteams found
themselves deadlocked at 1-1. Then
the injury woes continued when

junior Neal Andrews injured his

knee, sidelining him for the next

two weeks. His replacement is
freshman Matt Hill who stepped in
immediately.

Unfortunately, the overtime
periods were unkind to the Cats as
UNCG rolled up three goals to
take the 4-1 victory. The Cats
looked to rebound from this upset
when they headed to Columbia,
SC, for the seventh Annual MetLife
Classic over fall break.

Davidson faced Boston Uni-
versity in the first game of the
tournament on October 16. Boston
brought a strong team from the
North for a physical contest. The
Cats held tough as Hill had his first

' start in goal, making some out-

standing saves.

Holding off a fierce Boston
attack, the 0-0 tie was broken with
16:43 left in the game when a loose

ball in front of the goal was picked
-up and blasted past the Davidson
goalie.

The game would be put out of
reach about six minutes later when
a Boston player broke free and
gave his teammate a goal with a
perfect assist. The Cats then faced
the University of South Florida, a
5-1 loser to South Carolina.

Suffering their third straight
loss in a row, Davidson fell to
South Florida 4-1. The Cats fell
behind early and never recovered.
South Carolina knocked off Bos-
ton University 2-1 for the tourna-
ment championship.

Following the weekend trip,
Davidson traveled to Charleston,
SC, to face the College of Charles-
ton. This road game would be no
prettier as the Cats were shutout 5-

0. In the four losses, Davidson has
mustéred only 2 goals while giv-
ing up 15. The four remaining
games give Davidson an opportu-
nity to finish above .500 and sec-
ond place in the Southern Confer-
ence.

The conference tournament
will be held in Greensboro on No-
vember 5-7. In order to receive a
bid to the NCAA tournament,
Davidson needs to win the South-
ern Conference tournament. Their
next home game will be versus
Appalachian State this Wednes-
day at 7:00PM at Richardson Field.

maintained their poise. The teams
played a scoreless first half, al-
though Davidson had numerous
scoring opportunities due to the
smooth transitions from defense to

-offense made by Suzanne Hardesty,

Robin Pepper and Nicole Ficeto.
In the second half, after
Radford scored during a scramble
in front of the cage, the Wildcats
took control. They out-smarted
Radford, passing the ball quickly
and switching fields often.

Davidson scored off ofa great play
by Suzanne Hardesty and Holly
Kledis: Hardesty cut into the circle,
received the ball and gave a perfect
flat pass to Kledis, who was in the
exact position to tip the ball into
the corner of the cage.

With the tied score, the Wild-
cats did not let down as they con-
tinued to mark well defensively
and create offensive opportunities.
Defender Jill Bennett had a great
game as she shut down Radford’s
scoring threat, denying her the ball
all over the field. Unfortunately,
the team’s persistent efforts did

not convert into a win, but the
Wildcats left the game knowing
that they had out-played their op-
ponent.

After the game, Coach Pryor
commentedon the team’s improve-
ment and undying spirit: “This is
a team that plays with heart and
never gives up.” Despite theirlack
of actual notches in the win col-
umn, the Wildcats had a successful
weekend because they played hard
and they played together.

Their next home game is Fri-
day afternoon against Virginia
Tech.
