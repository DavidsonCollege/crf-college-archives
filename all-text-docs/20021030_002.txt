will review all appli-
cations and choose
“Sunbeams” by No-

vember 14.
Sunbeams will
then be eligible to re-

ceive grant money
from the Sunshine
Lady foundation. Be-

staff at the Sunshine
Lady Foundation must review each proposal
and determine whether the project complies
with the foundation’s mission and guidelines.
Selection as a Sunbeam by Davidson’s com-

spring. A maximum of six grants can be awarded
each year to Davidson students, and so far,.
students have taken advantage of the opportu-
nity made available by the Sunshine Lady, the
sister of investment tycoon Warren Buffett.
Although the Sunshine Lady Foundation does
not usually fund international projects because
of tax reasons, international projects are pos-
sible by working through an American non-
profit. For example, last year, Kristin Nickel
04, Nick Mantini ’03, and Dan Morris ’03
became Sunbeams when they proposed a plan to
aid children in Nicaragua. By working with the
Doctors of Global
Health, Nickel,

“[The Sunshine Lady — Nimiins and

Morris were able
to give money to
Gener-
aciones Alliance,
a Davidson stu-
dent organization
that works inter-
nationally to fund
the expansion of
an education cen-
ter for children
who live ‘in the
Managua __ city
dump.

“Dos Gener-
aciones is a cause
that we believe in,” says Nickel, “and the Sun-
shine Lady grant gave us an opportunity to
support this cause. That’s what it’s all-about.”

This year’s deadline for the Sunshine Lady
Grant is November 8. Applications and more
information about this grant and other service
opportunities is available at the Community
Service Office on the fourth floor of Alvarez.
