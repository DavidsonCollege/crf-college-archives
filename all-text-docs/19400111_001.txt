Professor Friedrich B- F. Marti
Discusses Problems

Of ‘The Next Peace”

Naturalized American of Har-
vard Faculty is Former
German Professor

FORUM FOLLOWS TALK

Advocates Federation Of
Nations-in Future

Speaking on the topic “The
Next Peace,” Professor C.J.
Friedrich of Harvard Univer-
sity lectured to the students
and townspeople of Davidson
on January 4, at 8 P. M,, in
Chambers auditorium.

Professor Friedrich, a native Ger-
man but a naturalized American
citizen, gave the reasons for the
need of a new peace and explain-
ed his idea of what the next peace
should consist of. He said that
the entire — present trouble was
brought about by the unjust settle-
ment after the first World War.
The people were to blame for this
settlement rather than the states-
men for they were so instilled with
hate that they wanted
penalties imposed. Professor Fried-
rich praised the formation of the

extreme

League of Nations and said that
its chief. fault was that too much
was expected of it, and that the

democracies had not the right for-
eign policies to make it work.
Just Settlement

To have a lasting peace, he said,
a just settlemeft should be made
and that settlement should be made
with the aid of the German people
rather than forced upon them. He
suggested that a series of federa-
tions be made to embrace the coun-
tries of the world and then a league
of continents be made to replace
the present League of Nations.

Following the address a forum
was held and the audience was in-
vited to ask questions. Prof. Fried-
rich is a_professor of Government
in the Harvard Business School
and a former professor at Heidel-
burg ,University, Germany.

Snowballs Fly As Heavy
Downfall Covers Campus

And the snows came! Yes, near-
ly four inches of white, cold, wet
snow—and it all happened between
eight-thirty and one o'clock Sun-
day. The, snow, falling quickly on
the already frozen ground, stuck
almost immediately and soon built
itself up to a depth of nearly four
inches—the heaviest snow seen here
at Davidson in several years.

The-snow--brought with it its
usual quota of snowballs, black-
eyes, broken window panes, and
wet feet. It has become exceed-
ingly dangerous for a peace-loving
student even-to venture outside his
room. His quiet reverie may be
suddenly shattered by a well-aimed
snowball.

“Rearm! Rearm! More munitions
immediately!” might well have
been the cry as snow battles raged
along many sectors from Duke to
Rumple. The Chambers front was

also the scene of much activity,
especially about mid-morning each
day. No casualties have been re-
ported as yet, but an official survey
reveals a great deal of damage to
have been done sat the
each of the battles.

This sudden.change in the weath-
er also caused many sudden chang-
es in the plans of Davidson stu-
dents. Not a few students were off
the campus for the week end and
were unable to return in time for
Vespers Sunday, and some even
missed their classes on Monday
morning.

The more important paths around
the campus were quickly cleared of
snow Sunday afternoon, two mules
pulling a drag-sled used for the
purpose,

The snow itself was followed by
sleet which gave the new-fallen

scene of

snow an icy crust.
