After Four Straight Victories Wild-
cats Face Hardest Game of
Schedule at Chapel Hill

The Wildcat basketball team has two
more games to play before the exam sched-

is the hardest that they will have on the
schedule. They will journey over to GCaro-

Donald's cagers in one of the important
games of the season for Davidson. Tuesday
night they will mect the Elon team on the
Davidson court.

Friday afternoon the team leaves in cars
for Chapel Hill, expecting to arrive there in
time for supper and a practice on the Caro-
lina court that night. Saturday night they
will give Carolina one big fight for one of
the state’s most important basketball games.
They will leave right after the game, return-
ing home.

_ While Carolina is doped to win the game,

the Wildcat tossers will let them know that
they have won a game, if they win. Dope
has been upset all this season, and it isn’t too
late now for some to be spilled. Carolina is
playing on their own court, which gives them
a good adyantage. They also have three of
last year’s team back>and two men from the
1923 team. They also have some good ma-
terial from year’s Freshman squad.
They have played only one game this year
in which the whole squad participated. They
played the Charlotte “Y" team during the
Christmas holidays, but the whole team was
not there, and nothing can be said about this
game, other than that they won by a field
goal. They played the Durham Elks Friday
night.

last

The only inter-collegiate game that the
Carolina team will play before the David-
son game will be the Guilford team Friday
night.

The team that Carolina will probably put
in the field to compete against the Davidson
team will be composed of Cobb and Mce-
Donald, forwards; Dodderer, and
Purser and Devin, guards.

The Eelon team will be played here Tues-
day night. Nothing can be learned of the
Elon game, other than what the Greensboro
News said of it the other day. That paper
stated that Elon and Guilford will be on a
par with Duke. If the Elon team can put
up the fight that Duke put up last Friday
and Saturday, then another good game can
be expected. The are no
slouches when it comes to playing basket-
ball, and’so the fur should fly when these
teams meet Tuesday. The two teams did not
meet last year, and in the last meeting Elon
Was the victor.

The schedule called for a game with Clem-
son here last Tuesday, butothis had to be
called off, because final arrangements could
not be arranged. Manager Ocland is trying
to arrange a game with some fast “Y” team
before the Carolina game, to keep the boys
in practice. He is trying to get the Kan-
‘napolis team over here.

You said it, Eddie!

All the Davidson spirit is not centered in
jour football team by any means; the basket- |
‘ball squad here by their wonderful comeback
against the Duke University quint last Fri-
day won the honor of being called Wildcats
as much as any team that ever wore the Red |
and Black.

After all hopes of a Davidson victory had
apparnetly been lost by the entire crowd in
the Auditorium the team came to life. It
was as thrilling from a basketball point of
view as the great football rally down at
Pinehurst last October or the last quarter of
the Thanksgiving Day game with Trinity.

The Wildcat victory over the Methodists
was the first since 1921. For the past five
times the Trinity team had beaten the Wild-
cats. In 1922 when the Red and Black team
won ten out of thirteen games, Trinity won
two of the three games the Wildcats lost.

Whether the Wildcats start from the first
whistle as in Saturday night’s game or wait
for a final burst of phenomenal speed as the
night before, they are going to have a hard
time in defeating the Tar Heels.

lina teams have met defeat at the hands of
Davidson to be over-confident when a Wild-
cat game is on.

From all advance dope the Carolina team
will be good but not the Southern champion-
ship team that was turned out over there
last year. The loss of both McDonald and
Carmichael along with Captain Green is a
heavy one,

It seems that they are having a bit of
trouble in filling the center's position. Dod-
derer is good on the tip but goes back to
stationary guard after that.

They'll need a®good one when Anderson
lines up for his first time against a varsity
team from North Carolina.

Anderson is high point man on the David-
son squad, having piled up 46 points in the
four games that Davidson has played. And
they've all been ficld goals, without an ex-
ception.

The game will be the first meeting be-
tween Monk McDonald and Monk Younger
in the capacity as opposing coaches.

Wake Forest is another team that must
have a good quint. Practically the entire
team of last year is back. When such men
as Vickers and Greene and Ellington are
forced to make trips as subs the first string
must be pretty strong.

They won two games last week—over Dur-
ham Elks and Richmond Blues. This week
they are on a trip through “ole Virginny,”
where they meet W. & L., Virginia Tech,
V. M. I., Lynchburg, the Richmond Blues,
and a game with Georgetown,

However, we can never use them as com-
parative scores, for the eastern trip comes
first in February when Duke, the Durham
Elks and Wake Forest are met on successive
days.

From reports coming in the V. P. I. team
will be unusually strong this season. This
year’s game will be the first meeting of the
| Gobblers and Wildcats on the court in many
| years.

Clarence Rawson, the Fresh basketball team
will open the 1925 season here on February
5 with the Trinity first year quint. Follow-
ing this will come a four-game trip through
North Carolina, on which the five will meet
the leading freshman and prep school teams
of the state. Oak Ridge, Trinity and Caro-
lina or N. C. State yearlings will all be met
on this little journey.

Coach Rawson says that his team will be
built around two good defensive guards and
will be one of the strongest defensive teams
he has ever put out, considering forwards.
Present indications are that the team will be
weaker than last year’s. However, Rawson
says that in case he can develop some good
goalmen he will put out a first-class quint.

Delma Brown, for three years a star on
the Smithfield High-School team which lost
only five games in three years, one being by
a one point margin to Asheville for state
championship in 1923, along with John Mel-
ton and McAulay, are the leading guards.
Brown is fast and great on floor work.

At center Oden, from Greensboro High,
and Ben Wilson, are showing up well, with
Oden holding a slight margin.

The forwards are led by Maulden, from
Kannapolis, along with Hall, of Belmont,
and Milner and Mills, from Reidsville High
School, which won the state championship
last year.

Fairmont College—Sparing the paddle
spoils the Freshman, believe The Sunflower.
“Last year the paddling line was abolished at
Fairmont College with what has proved to be
unsatisfactory results.” The unpaddled
Freshmen are a disloyal lot, continues Sun-
flower, they have not “entered into the activ-
ities of the school with the same whole-
heatrted interest that was displayed in past
years,”

‘While The Sunflower is not in favor of
the primitive paddle line of the past with its
clubs, broom-sticks, two-by-fours, and other
makeshift paddles, it does favor the paddling
line for Freshmen with regulation paddles
and unless such a system is restored the
abolition of all Freshmen rules, including the
Wearing of green caps and ribbons, for under
the present system it is impossible to enforce
them and they are worse than no rules at
all.”
