interested in assisting us toward the

needed objective.

A large, attractively furnished Stu-

uses—for a Bible Class, for socials,
for conferences, etc. This room, to
cost approximately $10,000.00, has
been agreed upon by the First Pres-
byterian Church of Concord as its
contribution to the total objective.

a huge success each time.

A group of approximately forty
couples is expected to attend, and
although, the crowd is expected to
be smaller than it has been in years
past, there is no reason why this
party should be any less of a suc-
cess than they have been in the
past few years.

You can not be wholly successful
by half-hearted efforts.

To correct abuses is constructive.
; to permit them is destructive.

FRATERNITY GIFTS
Social and Honorary Frater-
nities will be solicited for funds
in order to realize the $1,000
goal of the 1944 Christmas Gift
Fund. A number of fraternitics
have already expressed their de-

sire to-give from. their own
treasuries in addition to the in-
dividual contributions of their
members.

‘This is not the first year that
fraternities have donated as a
group. Such genuine and active
support has gone a long way in
the past of assuring the success
of these campaigns.

Key men in each fraternity
have been contacted, the matter
was brought before them, and it

will be discussed in their respec-

tive chapters.

Friends And
Alumni Help

cent many loyal

STUDENT LEADERS COMMENT

In commenting on the 1944 Gift
Fund Project, Jim Alexander, Pres-
ident of the Y, said, “The choice of
projects toward which to
contribute our money this Christmas
seems the best possible. The dedi-
cation of a memorial to those who
have given their lives in this war is

we are

the least we can do to demonstrate
our appreciation. The undettaking
of any task should be done with the.
intention of doing one's best. This
certainly deserves all we can spare
to. make it our best.”

Student Body,. says, “The project
