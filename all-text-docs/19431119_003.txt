State Takes’
20-0 Victory

Turner, Mauro Attack;
Cat Passes Click

The North Carolina State Wolf-
pack decisively thumped the David-
son Wildcats before a crowd of
2.500 sun-drenched spectators at
Memorial Stadium 20-0. Bouncing
back hard from a recent 175-0 loss
to Duke, the Wolfpack unleashed
a powerful ground attack and took
advantage of the shoddy Wildcat
pass defense to chalk up the one-
sided triumph. .The defeat brought
down the curtain on the football
scene at Davidson for the '43 cam-
paign.

State Powerhouse Opens

The two teams sparred near mid-
field for the majority of the first
quarter with neither team having
the upper hand. Late in the period,
however, the State powerhouse
began to roll. With Turner and
Gibson ripping the 'Cat line to rib-
bons. the’ Wolfpack steamrollered
its way to the Davidson 15 before
the quarter ended. On the first
play of the second period, Turner
started to run to the left, stopped
and whipped a pass to Pearce. in
the end zone for the first State
touchdown, Zick converted. After
a punt exchange the visitors again
went into high gear, driving to. the

drive had moved the pigskin to the
"Cat 12. At that point the elusive
Turner waltzed through the David-

version attempt was wide. State
put on several more drives, but
they were not able to threaten
seriously again. Aside from the
brief passing spurt in the second

quarter the Davidson attack was’

completely throttled by the heavy
State line.

Turner State Star

Howard Turner, State’s speedy

tailback, was clearly the outstanding
performer of the day. He was aid-
ed by Muro‘and Andrews in the
backfield and Pearce, Zick, and
Novick in -the line. For the out-
gunned ’Cats Ashmore, White, and

The K. A.’s and Kappa Sigs bat-

tested interfraternity touch foot-

four victories and suffered only one
defeat each. \

The K. A.’s, paced by Jim Lowry
and Bill Nichols, combined a power-

After receiving the opening kick-
off, the 'Cats launched a drive which
penetrated deep into Clemson terri-
tory before it was halted. Led by
Ashmore and White, the Presbyte-
rians forces moved from their own
28 to the Bengal 16. The Tiger
forward wall rose up at that point
and averted the threat. Neither
team was able to produce a sus-
tained march for the rest of the
period,

The Tigers took the offensive
early in the second quarter, blast-
ing their way to the Davidson 1
where Williams recoyered Riddle’s
fumble to end the threat.- A few
minutes later Rutledge intercepted

Only One Letterman Returns

Coach Norman Shepherd will is-
sue the call for candidates for the
1943-44 Wildcat cage outfit on Mon-
day afternoon. In spite of heavy
losses to the armed forces, Shepherd
hopes to put a flashy outfit on the
court which can hold its own against
any opposition.

Last season's team, one of the best
in the history of the school, reached
the semi-fmals of the Southern Con-

team throughout the season. Peters
was aided by John Belk and Jack
Wyman, as well as other fine play-
ers. All members of last year’s team
have left with the notable exception
of Jim Lowry.

Nevertheless, everything points to
a successful season. Ed White and
Lennox Turnbull, members of last
year's freshman five, have returned,
and freshmen, including
Mike Williams, Bob Freeman, Bob
Flowers, and J.D, Ashmore, showed
up well in games against the Air

“B” Team Loses To
Scrappy Barium Boys

In a closely contested, hard fought
game, Barium Springs nosed out
the Davidson “B” team by a one
point margin, 20 to 19. The Wild-
cats outplayed their opponents but
lacked the experience and unity that
the Barium Springs boys had.

Davidson scored twice in the early’
minutes of the game, first by a sus-
tained-drive from midfield and again *
by a pass from Scofield to Thomp-
son, caught over the ‘halfback’s’
head and run 15 yards ‘to.a T. D.
Both attempts for the extra points
failed.
