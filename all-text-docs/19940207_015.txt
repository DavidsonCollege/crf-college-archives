Holland, Slagle, Millen head west hoping for another Final Four

By Will Cobb
This Wednesday, Davidson
sends its representatives to Kansas
City, Missouri, to state their case

for the NCAA men’s soccer Final

Four for 1995 and 1996 at the
annual NCAA soccer association
meeting.

Mountain
Bike Club
chartered

By Jimmy Cline

Take a look at all the bike
racks around campus and what do
you see? Multitudes of mountain
bikes crammed together. Moun-
tain Bike Club founders Jim
Livingstone, Dave Stewart, and
Will McDaniel noticed this abun-
dance of mountain bikes and de-
cided to do something about it.

January 27 marked the date of
the first meeting of the Davidson
College Mountain Bike Club. Sev-
enteen people attended the organi-
zational meeting and many others
expressed interest.

“The purpose of the club is to
organize rides so fellow mountain
bikers can gather together and so-

land, men’s head soccer coach
Charlie Slagle, and former Direc-
tor of Marketing Pat Millen. Un-
like the past presentations

Davidson has given to be able to

host the past two weekend events,
the trio plans to use a more subtle
approach. As Millen puts, “We
have nothing more to prove.”
After the 1992 Final Four, the

opinion from the NCAA was that it
was near perfect. For those who
have attended both events know
that the difference between 1992
and 1993 was substantial, and the
NCAA had no suggestions for im-
provement on last December’s
event.

Slagle wants the NCAA to
recognize the strong foundation

cialize while getting in a good ride,"
stated co-founder Jim Livingstone.
Although some of the members of
the club are experienced in racing,
all levels of mountain bike riders
are invited and encouraged to take
part in the rides.

Rides are planned to occur
approximately once a week, usu-
ally on Friday or Saturday after-
noon. Future rides include the
Beechspring trail in Concord and

several South Carolina rides, in-
cluding one in McAddenville.
There is no cost involved in the
club except for the responsibility
of providing one’s own transporta-
tion to the ride sites.

The next meeting is sched-
uled for February 17 at 7:00 p.m. in
the Union Pit. If interested and
unable to attend call either Jim
Livingstone -6620, Dave Stewart
-6635, or Will McDaniel -6633.

The Bavidsonian

We, the editors, extend our apology to coach K erstin Manning and all the women and men of Davidso
College for the irresponsible attitudes reflected in last week's article "Manning ready to bring in new era 0
women's lacrosse." The sexist piece was mistakenly published and in no way reflects our own ideas.

and support for the tournament in
Davidson. “The reason we are in
the position we are has to do with
the cooperation of Davidson Col-
lege coupled with the support of
the Davidson community,” Slagle
adds.

Though last December’sevent
seemed to have no room for im-
provement, tournament chair Lee
Sargent has formulated a 15-page
outline of proposed changes for
next year. “The 15-page outline
for changes shows the dedication
Davidson has made to make this
event as successful as possible.
Lee Sargent puts so much pride
into this,” said Millen.

One of the changes proposed

includes raising the scoreboard to
include more seating in the end
zone and also to enable everyone
sitting to be able to see the full
SCOTEDORIOL eae

Davidson will be competing
against the University of Richmond
and the University of Maryland to
host the event. Davidson stands as
the frontrunner. Hopefully the
NCAA will recognize that there is
no reason to change locations.

“I want people to think about
the men’s soccer Final Fouras AD,
After Davidson,” says Millen. If
Davidson can keep the same people
working on this event with such
aspirations, maybe there will never
be an “After Davidson.”

Women's track looking good

team toreup the track. Marie Grisez
ran a strong first leg (2:30) before
handing off toa determined Phuong
Nguyen (2:36). Mary Baxter(2:43)
and Annie Parsons (2:55) rounded
out the relay.

Vanessa Sims debuted in her
first Davidson track meet by com-
peting inthe high jump. Hoping to
clear 5’2", Sims gracefully leaped
5’3 3/4" to place fourth and shatter
aschool record. In other jumping
events, Lara Burkholder leaped
16’9 3/4" in the long jump. In the
triple jump, junior Maria
“Fishhead” Whitehead soared
34’5" and Burkholder, 31’ 11 1/2."

In the throwing event, Erika
Gromelski challenged her personal
best and threw 28’9" in the shot
put. The second school record of
the day fell when the distance med-
ley relay broke the previous mark
by nineteen seconds. The awe-
some team consisted of Sallie
Permar (800, 2:34) Maria
Whitehead (400, 64.1) Carolyn
Meadows (1220 4:13) and Jean
DeMoss (1600, 5:45).

After two successful track
meets, Davidson’s track team can
only get better. With a busy sched-
ule and a competitive team, the
women look to run faster, .jump
longer, and throw farther in the
next few months.
