_ OPINIONS

"TUESDAY, DECEMBER 12, 1995

A couple of years ago, I wrote
an article for The Davidsonian
about the Great Trustee Question.
You know, whether or not trustees
should be active members of a
Christian church.

I am now a couple of years
older and, hopefully, a couple of
years wiser. Having learned that a
day when I don’t say, “yesterday, I
was wrong about this or that,” is a
day that I’m not being honest with
myself, I’ vereconsidered my opin-
ion about the Great Trustee Ques-
tion.

In 1993, I thought that church
(or synagogue) membership should
be a Trustee requirement. Itis now
1995 (I’ve finally- gotten used to
writing ‘95 on my checks and the
new year is less that a month away.
. . [hate that), and I have changed
my stance on the church-member-
ship requirement.

There are two reasons for my

change of heart. The first is a little ©

ugly, so please forgive me ahead
of time for being a big-mouthed,
obnoxious, opinionated jerk.
Davidson is not really a very
strong Christian institution. We
say a lot of pretty words and puff
ourselves up, but look around you.

Greg Garrison

Why I changed my mind

We go to a school that hands out
free condoms, but refuses to sell
tobacco products or treat smokers
with a whole lot of respect.

If you look into the Bible,
you’ ll find that it’s fairly consis-
tent about casual sex but notably
silent on smoking.

I am personally pretty ticked
about the school’s stance on ciga-
rettes (although they’d surely cost
at least thirty dollars a

Davidson’s government, though.
It has to do with a doctrine called
Common Grace.

Reformed theology, to which
Presbyterians adhere, states that
someone does not have to be a
Christian to make sound decisions.
The idea is that God extends a
common, preserving grace to all of
humanity, so that His hand and bits
of truth can be seen in every cul-

Trustee.

There is practical evidence
supporting this—according to
Gallup, in America unethical be-
havior (which they break down
into surprisingly specific catego-
Ties) is practiced with approxi-
mately the same frequency among
“Born Again Christians” and the
rest of society.

To bring it a little closer to
home, I was recently talk-

carton if they did sell them
in the Union Cafe), but
going to Cashion’s isn’t
such a great inconve-
nience thatI’ddo anideo-
logical about-face be-

... a trustee does not
have to be a Christian to

be a good trustee.

ing to a good friend, and
she was telling me that

_ last year she asked all of -
the girls on her hall how

many of them had hooked

cause of my weekly carton run.

But I digress. For good or for
ill, who can honestly say that the
historical church plays an integral
role in the decision-making pro-
cess around here?

The meat of my change of
heart really doesn’t have anything
to do with casual sex or smoking or
the church’s involvement in

ture and civilization.

In other words, a doctor or a
poet or a musician or a mathemati-
cian or a scientist or a parent does
not have to be a Christian to be a
good doctor or poet or musician or
mathematician or scientist or par-
ent.

And a Trustee does not have
to be a Christian to be a good

up on the Court since
they’d been here.

They all had at least once,
except for my friend, I’m sure that
some of those girls were Chris-
tians. My friend is not.

By using this example, I am
not trying to judge anyone for their
behavior, but merely to provide an
example that almost all of us can
identify with, including myself.

Sound, ethical behavior and
ideals should be the foundation for
deciding who may becomea Trust-
ees. Having faith does not insure
the establishment of honorable,
ethical, or intelligent decisions.
Having honor, integrity, and intel-
ligence does.

Tam not at all suggesting that
we abandon Christian ideals.
Rather, I am suggesting that we
fulfill them, encouraging truth,
mercy, justice, and honor.

A school that allows people
to. seek truth but not exercise their
understanding of it is neither mer-
ciful (for it demands ideological .
homogeneity), just (for it denies
many who have learned here to
have a voice in the education of the
next generation), nor honorable (for
its attitude toward alumni betrays
its declared ideals of truth and in-
tegrity).

All too often churches and
governments become social clubs,
rather than groups of people from
both genders and every ethnic
group who celebrate mercy and
justice, bound together by love.

Isuggestthat the Trustee board
avoids being the former and strives
to be the latter.

Voice

-The last hurrah-
(Providing all his core
requirements come
through)

I take on voices. It is the
oddest thing. I have just heard
Reynolds Price speaking on Na-
tional Public Radio about the short
history of the United States, and I
am afraid that I can write no other
way than he spoke. But I do not
have my own voice. For years, too
many really, I feel have been writ-
ing for this newspaper about school
and beer and girls—not necessarily
in that order. Looking at my old
articles, I feel both loss and glee.
So many words were written late at
night in a fifteen minute flurry of a
clicking keyboard. Everything I
wrote about I knew and I loved.
Davidson has been a wondrous
place for me.

Davidson, unfortunately, has
also been the site of my greatest
failure. I was in college, but I was
never, until this year, a student. In
those articles I wrote what I knew.
It is safe to say I knew little. I ran
through the first years of college
career like a horse with blinders
on. I was lightning fast, but I could
see only where I was going. It was

an oval track. By the time I saw
~ where I had been in such a hurry to
get, it was too late to goina differ-
ent direction.

So this year I became a stu-
dent. A new race has begun, and
again I do not know where I am
going, but I have already been
somewhere and I hope not to re-
turn. Being a student is an odd
thing, especially if you have never
been one before. Perhaps, of all
my difficult classes, Senior
Colloquium has been the hardest.
Strangely enough, I have kept up
with almost all of my work. But I
have learned little in thatclass other
than that [have a lotto learn. What
a lesson.

And this is why I have no
voice. When I write, I so often
sound like the author I have most

recently read that I. wonder if I
have any other skill than imitation.

At some point, I’m afraid. ‘I will -
“have a voice, be it sooner or later,

I will find my tone and pace and
whatever else is needed and I will
like it. My hope, though, lies in the
possibility that I could be wrong. I
may never find that voice.

I want always to be rediscov-
ering the truth. I never want to pin
down my emotions or build up my
barricades. Instead, I hope new
choices are always mixing them-
selves in my head, for being a
student is like a drug. Once you
start learning and really caring
about it, you can’t get enough. A
bookstore becomes a horizon, a
classroom a haven.

Perhaps, then, this is the luxury
that Davidson provides for you,
for learning is a luxury, Dr.
Kuzmanovich: the possibility to
know that there is always more to
know. I hope it does not take
everyone else as long as it took me
to realize how blessed we are to go
here. Do not worry that you are
going in the wrong direction, but
make sure you might not want to
go another way. Have no regrets,
and please, take your core require-
ments.

I want to finish with two
things. First, a quote from Jacob
Bronowski in The Ascent of Man
(1975): “It is important that stu-

dents bring a certain ragamuffin -

barefoot irreverence to their stud-
ies; they are not here to worship
what is known but question it.”

And finally, a story: as I was
copying that quote down in the
Chemistry Building, I heard a a
squeal. “Holy —— (expletive
edited)! Yes! Yes!” Glee, unre-
fined, unrequited, and absolute
glee. A girl came in one hand and
her fist in the other. She floated,
really. What a sight.

Christmas

from page 6

gives you an almost irresistible
desire to pick the whole damn thing
up and shake it. But then you
remember, this is a mall you’re
talking about, and you can’t bench
your own weight. Reluctantly, you
step inside. You cannot help but
remember how even Dante had a
guide.

Seven and ahalfhellish weeks
later you re-emerge (it has really
only been three hours, but that’s in
outside of the mall time. We're
talking about the amount of time
that Christmas shopping has sucked
out of your life which is roughly
approximated by seven and a half

_ weeks). You are sallow, lifeless,
utterly defeated, and not quite
ceratin whether or not you are go-
ing to vomit. You look around.
Other people are leaving the mall.
They all have your dazed expres-
sion, as if they have been shopping
in some over-crowded suburban
gathering place with department
stores. Oh wait, scratch that last
sentence. Anyway, a streaker
drives past in a sfnall red car with
“nuke gay whales for Jesus”
painted on his chest. No one no-
tices. You keep walking. You are

hit three times by people that are
too angry to stop, but that’s okay

because you are numb to the pain..

In fact, you are rather grateful be-
cause the jolt from each collision is
just enough to make you remem-
ber that you actually are awake.
You get to Hardees, and are so
confused that you do the unthink-
able and eat (there is a reason that
there is a Hardees across the street
from every major mall in America).
- Does this sound familiar? I
admit, I may have been a bit prone
to hyperbole when writing this, but
Iam not far from the truth. Christ-
mas shopping is one of the most
stressful activities a person could
possibly engage in, outside of be-
ing a Davidson college student,
and what’s worse is you rarely
leave these shopping sprees with
gifts you are excited about giving
to anyone important, but after
you’ ve been shopping for two and
a half hours you don’t care. The
paper weight in the shape of a
watermelon is a marvelous idea,
and an excellent example of craft
making that anyone with a pulse or
any sense of taste would be wholly
unable to appreciate.
So I say to you all, it's time for
a revolution! Let’s keep Christ-
mas the way it was meant to be, a

relaxing holiday where we sur- -

round ourselves with the people
we love, and give thanks to whom-
ever or whatever we feel like giv-
ing thanks to. But, let’s leave the
stress behind. ;

Let’s start giving Christmas
presents all throughout .the year.
Imagine how nice it would be to
receive a Christmas present in the
middle of June. You could attach a
little card that said “Merry Christ-
mas. I just wanted to bring a little
of me into your day. Love, (Your
name here).” I think it would be
awfully kind, and it would save
everyone a great deal of unneces-
sary trouble. So let’s save Christ-
mas, and put a little surprise back
into gift-giving. This is an idea
who’s time has come. Viva Revo-
lution.

(P.S. — In the name of the
honor code, I cannot claim this
year round gift-giving idea.as my
own. I ran across it in Maybe,
Maybe Notby Robert Fulghum, of
Everything I Ever Needed to Know
I Learned in Kindergarten fame.
And for all you people out there

’ looking for the perfect gift, if there
is anyone in your family who likes
to laugh and can read I highly
recommend this book.)

Sincerely,
Will Bradshaw ‘99
