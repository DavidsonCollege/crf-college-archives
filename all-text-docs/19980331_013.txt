THE DAVIDSONIAN

Sports Editor

With the conclusion of the winter season, many
Davidson student-athletes will bid farewell to the locker
rooms. Some will return next season, and some will not.
This year the wrestling squad loses six grapplers who were
on the roster during their senior year. This is a tribute to
those athletes who have competed in. what is arguably the
most intense of all collegiate sports. These seniors wrestled
in the tough Southern Conference, which is filled with
schools whose academic standards are miniscule in com-
parison to Davidson’s. These athletes successfully divided
their time between class and athletics. In their final season
as Davidson athletes, the seniors led the team to the best

record it had posted this decade.

George Escaravage

Escaravage and Wall served as
co-captains for the 1997-98 season.
Both. have been on the roster in all
four seasons that they have attended
Davidson.

Wall missed the fall of his junior
year when he studied in Spain, but lost
none of his talent during that semes-
ter. He returned in the spring to post
an 11-5 record, including three pins,
and also became the first Davidson
wrestler at any weight class to ad-
vance to the finals of the Southern
Conference in 28 years.

Wall wrestled his matches in the
190 weight class and also in the heavy-
weight class. Wall finished his career
with a record of 52-13. He also won
24 of his matches by pin.

Escaravage provided team lead-
ership throughout his career at
Davidson. His junior season was cut
short when Escaravage broke his hand

and was unable to wrestle.

Despite the injury, hé was named
co-captain for his senior season. Unfor-
tunately, Escaravage remained sidelined
for all of his senior season as well. He
did not wrestle but still carried out his
role as a co-captain.

Cameron spent his career at
Davidson primarily as a backup wres-
tler, filling in whatever weight classes
were open in a particular match.
Cameron wrestled matches at 177, 190,
and also at heavyweight.

Cameron has the notoriety of be-
ing the only wrestler on the squad to
have won all of career victories by pin.
Cameron has six wins in his career, all
by pin. Three of his pins came during
his season, one of them against an op-
ponent who outweighed him by sixty
pounds.

Broughton joined the squad in his
junior year and gave the team a wrestler

another wrestler at 190. During his two
seasons with the team, Broughton accu-
mulated eight wins, two of them by pin.

Herman was on the team roster
from his freshman year through fall of
his senior year, when he was forced to
leave the team due to a job he took as a
student teacher for this spring.

Herman wrestled primarily at 167,
and garnered 11 wins over the course of
his three and a half seasons, one of
which was by pin. His 65 escapes
sophomore season is the third highest
single-season total in Davidson history.

Sterling was one of the most suc-
cessful members of the class of ‘98.
Wrestling at 142 and 150, Sterling had
an immediate impact by winning 20
matches in his rookie season. His total
of 21 near falls that year places him fifth
on the all-time single-Season total list.
He finished this year with acareer record
of 56-37 including two pins.

Discussion over Kosovo,

Men’s tennis still strong in conference play

The tennis team decided to be nice
to Appalachian State. After all, how
can you not feel sorry for a squad so
weak that it cannot even find six players
to fill the singles spots?

How was Davidson nice to the
Moun-
tain-
eers?
Jon
Pastel
sat out.
This
was
prob-
ably the only reason that the Wildcats
didn’t blank the opposition. Moving up
to the #1 spot, Brett Ialacci lost his
match in the final set. Jeff Tonidandel,
moved up from his normal place at #3,
also lost. his match.

After a small scare, Davidson re-
bounded nicely by taking the next three
matches in straight sets. At the #6 spot,
Eric Bourn won by forfeit. Yes, forfeit.
In a tennis match.

The doubles matches were much
of the same for Davidson. Ted Kaplan
and Judson Sutherland easily won the
#1 doubles match 8-3. Tonidandel and
Tyler Epp win their match 8-2. At the
#3 doubles spot, the freshman duo of
Billy Boykin and Whit Hansen won by
yet another forfeit.

The Mountaineers upset Davidson
by scoring two points in the match, but
gave up five, four of them in matches
that were actually played.

Whatcan you say about this Moun-

taineerteam? Atleast they’ re notas bad .

as VMI.

Pastel did not stay on the sideline
for too long. He returned to action for
the team’s match against UNC-Greens-
boro and won his match with a convine-

ing score of 6-1, 6-0.

Once again in the #2 spot, Brett
Ialacci rebounded from a first set loss to
win the second and third sets 6-3, 6-3.
Whit Hansen won a barn-burner at the
#5 spot. After losing the first set 5-7,
Hansen won the second 6-3. In the
third, Hansen won by a narrow score of
7-5 to give Davidson its third victory.

Davidson’s wins at #1, #2, and #5
were matched by UNCG wins at #3, #4,
and #6. The match was tied at three
points apiece going into the doubles
matches.

Sutherland and Kaplan gave
Davidson a good start by winning the
first match 8-5. Pastel and Alex Okulski
clinched a win for Davidson with an
easy 8-3 victory at #2. In the third
match, Tonidandel and Epp polished up
the sweep of the doubles matches.

The two wins brought the team to
12-7 overall and 4-1 in Southern Con-
ference play.
