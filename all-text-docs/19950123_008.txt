Gull’s Nest: Bill Gullan

Differences are disturbing.

Why are there squabbles be-
tween groups at Davidson? Why
do we have trouble getting together
to do things? There is a tension
between unity and diversity, and
the growing emphasis on differ-
ences is very disturbing.

First, each individual is
unique. Everybody has talents and
shortcomings. Each person should
be judged separately on his/her
own ability—that much is clear.
Dr. King, whose birthday we have
been celebrating, talked of people
being judged by “the content of
their character, not the color ‘of
their skin.”

Such a method is the fairest,
most humane, and most accurate
way of evaluating people. Every-
one has something to bring to the
table, yet some distinguish them-
selves through their talent and per-
sonality. At this level, at least, I
feel we can all agree.

I also think the we can all

condemn the inhumanity of rac-
ism. I object to racism because it
stifles the individual. People are
pegged before they can show their
stuff. People’s proclivities are pre-
dicted without any knowledge of
their character.

Racism may be evil or stupid,
but, above all, itis premature. Other
things that are premature include
expecting fraternity men to act a
certain way, assuming international
students are a certain type of per-
son, stereotyping South
Carolinians,etc.

The afore mentioned mindsets
have not had the devastating his-
torical effect racism has had, but
they originate from the same basis:
that one need not take the time to
get to know a person before as-
suming things.

It even happens to me. When
I was a freshman, I had the reputa-
tion of being some sort of loud-
mouth, unfeeling, Rush Limbaugh,

ogre. It is positively false, yet
many who heard it, believed it, and
expected things from me before I
actually got to know them. I began
to empathize with those whose
group identity overshadows their
individual uniqueness. To be
treated as an individual is the most
anyone can ask.

I believe that blacks, women,
and gays marched to be treated as
individuals, not to simply secure
greater rights fortheir groups. That
is why it bothers me when group
differences are emphasized. How
am I to know that after attending
something like “Everything you
always wanted to know about Af-
rican-Americans, but were afraid
toask,” that answers to many ques-
tions would vary depending on
what black person you ask?

If I had stood up and asked
what type of music black people
like, would there be one answer?

‘If I had asked what black people

feel about taxes, would one re-
sponse have been enough? Do all
blacks vote for the same candi-
dates, see the same movies, and
read the same books? No. There is
just as much disagreement on such
issues within the black community
as there is within any other. So
why do we feel the need to separate
people on the basis of what group
to which they belong?

If we think aboutit, we will all
realize that friendship is based on
shared experiences. I have great
friends in my fraternity (we do
many things together), from my
freshman hall (we lived together),
from my classes (we endured to-
gether), and from any other expe-
rience I might have had. Iam more
likely to be friends with the black
girl with whom I muddled through
economics than I am to be friends
with simply a random person.

There are many times when
we celebrate our differences, and

that is fine if we’re learning from
each other. But, as Davidson stu-
dents, aren’t we more likely to be
friends with one another than we
are to be friends with people who
aren’t sharing this four-year
(maybe five for me) chapter in our
lives with us. There is more that
unites us than divides us. To live
together peaceably, we only need
to tap into it.

Why then, is there a separate
orientation for minority students?
They are going to be taking the
same classes as me, eating the same
Commons garbage as me, weigh-
ing their social alternatives like
me, picking up their mail from the
same place as me, receiving mail
from girls, parents, Duke Power,
and Rose’s like me. I could go on
forever, but the point is that we go
through so many things together,
why should we permit our admin-
istration to treat us as anything but
individuals?

Elvis lives.

You see, Elvis is more than
just a person. He is a god in many
ways. People at.Graceland make
weekly pilgrimages to his prop-
erty, pay their respects by singing
his songs, look at the stain glass
windows throughout his house, and
they celebrate his “death” by plac-
ing flowers on his grave. This is
only something you can realize if
you ever have the opportunity to
visit the holy place.

Sure, everyone goes there

skeptical, but everybody leaves a
changed person. You see, you
visit and you look at paintings and
movies of Elvis in his youth. You
become mesmerized by his studly
voice and moves from old news
clips. You study his hair: how he
parted it, and what kind of brush he
used. You “ooh” and “ahhh” over
his first glittering white jump suit.
You visit his private racquetball
court envisioning what grip heused
on his forehand, and how quick his
feet were.
You visit the “Jungle
Room’—decked with terry-cloth
rug on the floor and ceiling. You
see the tiger-striped couches and
parrot feathered chairs. This is the
room where he wrote many of his
songs. If you listen close enough,

you can hear his voice stillechoing —

off the walls. You visit the Elvis
Automobile Museum and look at
his first Cadillac and the last car he
used in a movie.

You venture outside and see
hundreds of Elvis impersonators
dressed like him, talking like him,
dancing like him, many believing
that they are actually him. You see
thousands of tourists piling into
the trams for the $19.95 “deluxe”
Elvis tour to see everything from
his private airplane to his private
bathroom. People file into the gift
shops purchasing Elvis shot
glasses, post cards, and boxer

shorts. ©

The tour guides are like walk-
ing games of Trivial Pursuit.

“How tall was he?”

“Six feet.”

“What size shoe did he wear?”

size 12.7

You feel sorry for these people.
How can they invest so much of
their worries into the life of some-
body that does not live anymore?
“C’mon, buddy,” you say, “it’s all
right for Halloween, but this is
Christmas. Snap out of it. The
guy’s dead.”

Then everybody turns around
and stops what they are doing. They

_ Stare at you like you’re crazy—

like you have committed a sin. ©

Or no, maybe it’s something
different. Yes, I think it is now.
The look is more of pity. They feel
sorry for you, sorry that you cannot
see the things they do. Or, even
worse, you see the same things, but
don’t want to believe them. You
feel claustrophobic and pressured.
So you slowly back your way out
of the holy land.

You back up past the Elvis
Museum. You pass the people
standing around in Elvis jump suits.
You pass through the Graceland

house. You pass the pictures of

him that leave people inawe. You
pass the people watching the last
living horse that belonged to Elvis.

You get a ride back on the
tram and notice all of the different
languages being spoken. People
from all over the world have come
to see the holy land.

And then, you pass through
the main lobby filled with Las
Vegas lights and prices—just like
the King would have liked it.
People continue to walk past you.
Bumping your shoulders, running
you over, and saying rude things to
you if you get in their way. All
they can see is the name “Elvis”

Project Life

At Davidson, we have a very
special program that, statistically
speaking, should not exist. The
Project Life Bone Marrow Drive
was founded just five years ago at
Davidson, and it is already one of
the largest student-led drives in the
country. What makes our drive so
unique, however, is not merely the
number of participants but the num-
ber of ways bone marrow trans-
plants have touched the Davidson
campus. Project Life was founded
by three Davidson students whose
lives were saved by marrow trans-
plants. In addition, four Davidson
students have successfully matched

flashing on off . . . on and off.
Eventually, you are able to bully
your way back to the overstuffed,
awaiting college car with winter
clothes, stereos, and skis.

Youjump inthe Acura Integra,
put it in first gear and lock the
doors. Still, people keep pouring
into the park from family cruisers,
mobile homes, and vans. Youdrive
down the driveway and see the
“Welcome to Graceland” signs one
after the other, one after the other.
People drive by you camera ready
with their eyes and mouths wide
open. You put your head down
and keep edging your way out of
the park. You eye Elvis Presley
Blvd. and look for signs to the
quickest way to the highway that
will lead you out of this craziness
and back to the safe parameters of
your home.

And you wonder if Elvis is
still alive.

Frustr ation and solicitation

During my term as opinions
editor for The Davidsonian I have
been impressed with the degree of
effectiveness that this section of
our paper has. Heated debate and
intellectual discussion have been
raised as a result of the views ex-
pressed on these pages.

What impresses me even
more, however, is the lack of
assertiveness in members of the
student body to publicly respond
to opinions or to present their own.
Some do, and these columnists
comprise my staff: Ike Bailey,
Rosie Molinary, Bill Gullan, Ken
May, Holt Vaughan, Walt Barron,
and a few others whose words we
read week after week.

I really should not have a
"staff," though. Unlike news,
sports, and arts, the opinions sec-

tion is an open forum for debate in
which anyone can participate. The
time to develop our own opinions
is nigh, and in order to truly be-
lieve them they must be tested.
Write them down, put them in cir-
culation for open discussion, and
see what comes of it.

I admire Alan Staggers for his
courage in submitting the article
about the Nation of Islam. I ad-
mire Ike for his relentless tackling
of racial issues. Iadmire Eric Sapp
for challenging the Commons. I
admire the writers who have the
guts to stand up for themselves.

You have an opinion because
you think and feel. So, do some-
thing to make the opinions section
of The Davidsonian whatit is meant
to be--a catalyst for thought and
cogitation.
