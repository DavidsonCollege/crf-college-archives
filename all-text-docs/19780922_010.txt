Jerry Reed should have
played ball with Burt at FSU,
for in ‘‘Smokey‘‘ they are a
perfect combination.

must go from Atlanta 6 Texar-—
cana, Texas, and back in 24
hours. This task is not difficult
unless returning with four hun-
dred cases of stolen Coors (a
perennial Reynolds favorite) is a
part of the bargain.

‘Reynolds and Reed pull off
mission impossible with only

breathing down their exhaust

deliver the brew to a dry-throa- ’

Even if you’re not a Burt
Reynolds groupie, I recommend
this bunch of garbage to each
and every person crazy enough
to read this B.S. Burt would not
object if you saw it either.

Smokey and the Bandit will
be shown at rock-bottom prices
here Friday night at 8 and 10:30
pm in Love Auditorium. If
you've seen it before and do not
wish to see it again, visit the
900 Room, and go to the second
showing. The local beer joint
should change your mind.
