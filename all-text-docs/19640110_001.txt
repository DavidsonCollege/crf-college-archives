days later an Episcopal minister wil

1 talk with students about his experiences in the
rs will be sponsored by the YMCA Forum Series,

which has as its topic for the year, “Challenges to the Christian Faith.”

The invitation to Dr. Scriven,
who is a professor of history
and philosophy of science at
the University of Indiana and
who is a proponent of atheism,
is an example of the program's
aims as expressed by Bill Fer-
ris and Jay Federman, the
Forum Committee’s co-chair-
men: “The Forum's program
will confront Davidson: students
with ideas outside the Judaeo-
Christian tradition which are
not voiced on campus. The pur-
pose of the program is to deep-
en student understanding of the
problems faced by religion in
the twentieth century.”

Dr. Scriven's academic back-
ground includes a PhD from
Oxford; terms as research as-
sociate at the Minnesota Center
of Philosophy of Science and as
assistant professor in philosophy
at Swarthmore Oollege; and a
two-semester fellowship at the
Center for Advanced Study in
the Behavioral Sciences at
Stanford, Catif.

In the Tuesday assembly pro-
gram, Dr. Scriven will speak
on “The NonExistence of God.”
In addition to the coffee hour
after chapel, the Forum Com-

‘philosophy at Davidson,

Count Basie To Play
For IFC Midwinters

Count Basie and his orches-
tra, popular jazz musicians,
have been contracted. by the
Interfraternity Council for its
Midwinters concert, which will
be held on Saturday afternoon,
Feb. 8, at 3 p.m.

Basie will bring with him a
20-piece orchestra and a featur-
ed singer. While emphasizing
jazz, their style of music varies
from show tunes to pop.

Basie, whose band is describ-
ed by this week’s Time maga-

zine as “the swingingest band
in the land,” was a big-band
leader in the ‘30s. Benny Good-
man was his competition then.
_and the Count is still considered
among the top three jazz men
in the country.

Basie, 59, plays the piano
himself, and among his bend
members are Sonny Payne,
drums; Marshall Hoyal, sax;
Snooky Young, trumpet; and
Freddy Green, guitar.

Recently he recovered any
lont fame with a New Year's
Eve show at his home base,
Basin Street East, the famous
night-club in New York City.
Time has since called his group
“the best-drilled orchestra in

' jazz—which is why it swings
_ like no other.”

present some remarks of his
own. A question period will
close the program.

“The Challenge of the Inner
City” will be the topic in chapel
on Feb. 6 of The Reverend Rich-
ard Gary of St. Mary's Man-
hattanville Episcopal Church in
New York City. His parish com-
prises West Harlem slums and
project houses and middle class
apartment areas. The congrega-
tion also includes persons af-
filiated with Union Theological
Seminary and Columbia Uni-
versity.

The Rev. Mr. Gary’s ministry
has been described in the fol-
lowing words: “One day he's in
court with a young ‘hooker,’ the
next he’s guiding a discussion
group on Bonhoeffer in the
better hivise apartments or
lecturing at Union, and the next
he’s ministering to the needs
of a man hand-cuffed to a hos
pital bed in the ‘slum’ Knicker-
bocker Hospital, where he is al-
so chaplain.”

In addition, The Rev. Mr.
Gary is active in the civil rights
movement. He onganized all of
New York’s Episcopal Churches
for last summer's Aug. 28
“March on Washington.” He has
also worked in refugee work
camps in Europe.

A coffee hour will follow his
chapel talk, with a tea in the
afternoon, and a program at
8:16 p.m. in the Morrison Room.

Government Jobs
Open For Summer

The North Carolina Center
for Education in Politics an-
nounces a statewide competition
for six Polities Internships for
the summer of 1964. Each in-
tern will be placed in the Wash-
ington office of a United States
Senator or Congressman, or on
the staff of the North Carolina
Democratic or Republican par-
ties in Raleigh, or in the cam-
paign organization of a North
Carolina gubernatorial candi-
date.

A stipend of $500 will be
awarded each intern. This grant
is sufficient to cover normal
expenses during the 10 week
internship period (approximate-
ly June 1 to Aug. 15). Interns
in Washington will live in a
student rooming house selected
by the Center. Those working
in Raleigh will live in North
Carolina State University dor-
mitories.

Additional information and
application forms may be ob-
tained from Dr. W. P. Minter.
Deadline for applicants is Jan.
25.

Only a possibility this

fall, a Davidson-sponsored

junior year abroad is now a reality. At their meeting last
Dec. 10, the faculty approved a plan presented by the
Foreign Study Committee making it possible for a student
to study in either France or Germany during his junior
year under a Davidson program. Informed sources said
the approval was unanimous.

Thus far, 24 students have al-
ready made deposits to travel
with Davidson’s Junior Year
Abroad during the next school

’ year. Twelve ‘of them will go to

Germany, 12 to France.
Students going overseas will
leave probably in early Septem-
ber, since the academic year in
Europe does not begin until the

; next month. Through arrange-

ments of the Experiment in In-
ternational Living, a nonprofit
organization designed for the
purpose of giving students all
over the world foreign exper-
iences, the students will live for
one month in private homes of
families in France and Ger-
many. During this time, they
will take an intensive course in
either French or German, de-
signed to give them better facili-
ty with the language they must
speak for almost a year.

After the month, students will
begin courses at French and
German universities. The uni-
versity in Marburg, a town of
about 46,000, has been selected
in Germany; one of three uni-
versities in France will be
selected for the group there.

A Davidson language pro-
fesser will be with each group: -
Or. T. 0. Pinkerton will lead
the group in Germany; Dr.
Francis Ghigo will go to
France. The edopted foreign
study plen states of the pro-
fessor accompanying each
group: “In addition to being
adviser to the students in the
group, he will conduct a sem-
iner in some literary study
correlated with lecture cours-
es of the university, and will
also meet each student in-
dividuelly et frequent inter.
vals to conduct a continuing
surveiilanee of his work in
other courses.

“The Davidson professor in
residence will translate the
student’e accomplishments in
his studies in the foreign univer-
sity into one of the following
terms for each course: pass with
recommendation for acceptance
of credit. pass without credit,
and fail.”

If the professor recommends
credit, then a student's credits
from overseas will be entered
on his record here just as any
other transfer credit. Work done
abroad will not count on a
student's numerical average.

However, each Davidson de-
partment. involved in courses
a student takes overseas may
require the study of some
American text along with for-
eign texts; and a student may
be examined on his work abroad
either by a mailed examination,
or after he returns for his senior
year in September.

The emphasis is on the
“may”; it is up to each in-
dividual department as to how
it wishes to handle students
taking its courses abrosd—it
may require no examination
at all.

Dr. J. O. Bmbry, chairman of
the Foreign Study Committee,
said that students would not be
through with the program until
about mid-June. “I expect many
of the students will stay on even
longer to travel and use the
excellent opportunity they have
to see Europe.” .

While the students study at
the foreign university, the plan
States that they “will have no
special. courses set up for
Americans with the exception
of the seminar meeting with the
Davidson professor. They will
live as native students and will
not have any special arrange-
merits to set them apart.”

To qualify for the Davidson
program, a student must have
an overall average of at least
1.75 and at least a 2.0 in the
language of the country where
he wants to study. In addition

prospective students must fill
out applications and provide
several recommendations from
other than professors for the
Experiment in International
Living. Embry pointed out that
it is necessary to mect the ap-
proval of -this organization as

well as that of the college in.

order to go abroad.

The cost per student for
the program for the year a-
broad will be $2,400. This is
opposed to the yearly fee of
$1,600 paid for tuition, room,
and board by members of this
year’s Freshman Class. “How-
ever, the fee is not so large
when what it covers is con-
sidered,” said President D. G.
Martin.

“The $2,400 provides for an
ocean voyage both ways, ex-
penses during the homestay
period, and tuition, board, and
room for the entire school year,
including vacations. It does not
include books, incidentials, and
transportation costs during va-
cations.”

Martin is very enthusiastic
about the program, and inform-
ed sources familiar with the
adoption of the program report
that despite some opposition
expressed by certain faculty
and administration members
when the plan was first propos
ed, he provided positive leader-
ship necessary to boost the plan
through the faculty.

Instrumental in getting the
plan adopted was Martin's as-
surance that he would find out-
side sources to help meet ex-
penses of the program, since
student fees alone can by no
means pay the way. “We are
certain that we will get a grant
from a foundation to help cover
costs not payed by individual
students,” Martin said. He can-
not at this time name that
foundation.

Martin said that since two
faculty mombers would go a-
broad with the students, it
would be necessary to hire addi-
tional professors, probably two.
“However, I feel the plan is
well worth that,” said Martin.
“The. benefits that the faculty
members that go abroad will
receive have perhaps been over-
looked, but I think they help
make the program very” worth
while for us to have.”

Despite the fact Davidson now
has a plan for a junior year
abroad, students may continue
to enroll in other Junior Year
Abroad programs under the
existing regulations for them.
Only three students are over-
seas with other programs this
year.

Big News On Campus:
’Cats Are IN The News

BY TOM LOFLIN

The biggest news of the
week on the campus seems
to be the fact that Sports
iMustrated, which hit the
stands today, has a good
spread on Davidson’s bas-
ketball Wildcats.

The biggest news of the
entire year may well be the
‘Cats. But Taylor Blackwell’s
publicity office is definitely
not the place to go if speedy
information about the na-
tion’s fifth-rranked basket-
ball team is desired.

1 walked in Monday to see
how the pro publicizers were
coming with the Davidson
image. I don't know why, but
Blackwell wasn’t on the phone.
The first five minutes I spent
with him must have been about
the only time his phonean-
swering left arm got 4 rest that
morning.

In those few minutes, he did
manage to relate the story of
the Sports Illustrated articie
to me. Bob Ottom and photo-
grapher Walter Ioss flew down
here on tickets bought by the
magazine to try to find out why
a small Christian school has

stopped turning. its other cheek-

in basketball. They spent all
day last Friday and Saturday
looking into many different
phases of the school.

“Ottom talked with the presi-
dent and the Admissions Of-
fice,” Blackwell told me, “and
he even made an in-state re-
cruiting trip with Coach Drie
sell. I don't believe the two
visors slept for two days, and
if they don't have a good story,
then they must be more disap-
pointed than anybody.”

Blackwell revealed that the
suspicious “Lefty” Driesell
at first thought the two were
West Virginia plents, and he
would not allow them to see
his secret scrimmege in prep-
aration for the big game. “t
had to wire New York to find
out that they were O.K.,”
smiled Blackwell, “and then
Lefty really seemed to take
to them. He was really excit-
ed about the publicity they
can give the school.”

But best of all ts the fact that
the school is now being consid-
ered by both Life and the Sat-
urday Evening Post for stories.

“Dhey approached us, we didn't
ask them,” Blackwell said al-

Vendors To Be

Drink vending machines are to be replaced
im the dorms by new vendors on a trial basis,
Supervisor of Dormitories Mrs. J. B. Moore
announced Thursday. The machines were re-
moved over a month ago due to abuse by the
students. The machines malfunctioned as the
result of a few students’ trying to get a free

drink from the machines.

The vending machines with self-contained
ice makers are activated as the coin trips an
activator switch on its fall into the coin box.
The activator switch is very delicate: the wire

that extends across the path of
less strength than a bobby pin.

Students desiring to trip the switch inserted
a piece of coat hanger wire into the coin slots
and depressed the wire, Mrs. Moore said. They
got a free drink; the next man just lost his
money. In touching the wire it is almost im-
possiblt not to bend it out of shape. After the
wire has been bent, coins will go into the box
but ‘will not activate the machine.

Mrs. Moore stated that students seemed to
ignore all warnings that the machines were
out of order. One student took down the out
of order sign that she had put on the machine

most fearfully, “and we cer-
tainly can't yell too loud to
them from down here. We'll
just wait to see what happens.”

It was about then that Black. .
well’s phone forgot its manners
and interrupted us almost con-
stantly for almost an hour. First
it was some sports writer in
Norfolk wanting to know the
beam statistics for the year. And
they still dont let people make
calls to little Davidson for
nothing.

Belle Banks of the local
Mecklenburg Gazette called for
a sports story. Thanks to the
’Cats, the little Davidson weekly
is now getting subscriptions
from as far west as Texas and
Arizona.

Sandwiched between the
phone rings. I managed to wring
out a few more facts before I
left in disgust:

Blackwell has to dig up two
basketball pictures to be used
on the covers of The State
magazine and Coach and
Athelete. His office already
this school year has had
double the requests for pic-
tures as it had last Year.
“We've already overrun our
budget,” Blackwell worried.
“Thank goodness President
Martin is so understanding of
the situation.”

The U.N.C. Sports Network
helped to make the Chartotte
Invitational basketball tourna-
ment the big success it was by
feeding all of the games to its
member stations. And WBT,
one of the strongest radio voices
on the east coast, is catrying all
of Davidson's home games.

Monday morning, Bill Currie
of WSOC-TV, Oharlstte, cut a
tape interviewing the team that
will also be shown on WRAL,
Raleigh. Blackwell is very hope-
ful that it' will be good enough
to be shown: by both ABC and
NBC.

Blackwell’s office has been
so busy that it did not even
close on Christmas Day. When
we make NUMBER ONE, Black-
well and his staff may even have
to stay up nights.
