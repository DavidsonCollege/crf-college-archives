WILL TERRY

William Holt Terry
Named as Davidson's
New YMCA Secretary

Davidson College President Dr.
John R.
nounced the appointment of Wil-
liam Holt Terry as secretary of the
college YMCA.

Terry succeeds the Rev. Samuel
H. Magill, who resigned last week
to become Director of Student
Activities at the University
North Carolina.

The new secretary is a native of
Durham and graduated from Da-
vidson with the class of 1954. For
the past year he has been a stu-
dent at the Union Theological
Seminary in Richmond, Va.

The YMCA is the center of cam
pus religious life, and sponsors stu-
dent activities throughout the year.
Dances at nearby women’s colleges
and a series of oustanding speak-
ers combines with service activ-

ities of the members to create a}

varied and active program.

Terry was prominent in student
affairs while an undergraduate. He
was president of the Eumanean
Literary Society, assistant editor of
the college annual, a member of
Sigma Phi Epsilon, social fra-
ternity, and of the honorary fra-
ternity council, and served as chief
marshal at commencement. He was
elected to “Who's Who in Ameri-
can Colleges and Universities” and
to Tau Kappa Alpha, national hon-
orary forensic fraternity.

He assumes his duties immediate-
ly. Magill will remain at Davidson
for the next six _weeks before
joining the administration

Orientation Program
Seen As Successful

| John Child, Freshman Advisor,
jsaid that orientation was a suc-
|cess, and that he believed that
| the five-day period was of in-
valuable help to the freshmen. Dr.
Spencer, Dean of Students, also ex-
pressed his view that orientation
| was very successful.

During the five-day period, the
Class of ‘59 was divided into
groups based on individual interest
with the hope of increasing the
effects of the counseling.

Among the extra-curricular fea-
tures of the program were movies
at the College Union, Faculty
Open House, the Faculty Reception,
a dance with the belles of Queen's
College and the Freshman-Facul-
ty barbecue.

The orientation ended as the
upper classmen returned to the
campus to begin classes last Wed-
nesday.

Rush week, which began Mon-
day, September 19, culminates

HELM

in a dual role as Chief Photog-
rapher and Photography Advisor.

Perhaps the outstanding develop-
ment in the staff’s planning is that
John Whitcomb of Darien, Con-
necticut has graciously agreed to
judge the Beauty Section. Whit-
comb is considered by many to be
the foremost magazine illustrator
of the day, and has a feature page
monthly in Cosmopolitan. The
Beauty Section will include four
full pages, a formal portrait and
two informal shots of the winner,
as well as formal portraits of the
six runners-up. Hamp Mauze and
Henry Faison will be in charge of
campus collection.

The 1956 Quips and Cranks will
present the school year just as it

occurs, in chronological order, with | -

a parallelism in copy and pictorial
representation. Dark green has
been chosen as the second color
and Old English scrip will be used
to contribute to the conservative,
“Ivy League” design. The layout is
the largest in the school’s history,
a full fifty pages bigger than last
year’s. For the first time since 1949
each social fraternity and the Cam-
pus Club will receive four full
pages. Competent representatives
have been designated in each
respective organization to keep an
account of its activities in both pic-
ture and print. Davidson social life
will be further portrayed by a
spread, two full pages, on each of
the three dance weekends.

The dedication of the annual
was decided by a ballot of the
Class of 1956 in a class meeting
after yesterday’s chapel. So as to
maintain the element of surprise
the dedication affords, the dedica-

tion will not be announced pub-|
licly. The choice was made from}

seven members of the “college fam-
ily” nominated by the annual staff.

It is the earnest desire of the
editor and his staff that impartial
student representation be
increased in every aspect of stu-
dent life. We pledge careful
photographic selection to assure
there is no vain repetition of stu-
dent demagogues or members of
any social organization. Our only
ambition is to present an original,
readable, durable, attractive, and

According to a tabulation made
late Tuesday, about 215 freshmen
joined the Davidson College YMCA
during the recent membership
drive held during the orientation
period. The tabulation was not
complete, since some reports from
solicitors had not been verified at
that time, and others were still
coming in.

The membership drive for upper-
classmen will begin on September
27 with a chapel program outlin-

\|ing the procedure for the drive.

Solicitations will be made from that
time through September 29, accord-

jing to Hampton Mauze, chairman

mittee have already made exten-

About 60 solicitors have been en-
gaged and they will choose the
same number of assistants to make
sure that no person is overlooked.
Each solicitor will contact about
eight men during the drive.

Membership in the YMCA is ob-
tained through the signing of a}
statement that one accepts the pur-
pose of the YMCA as outlined on
the membership card. This card

will contain various questions to
ascertain the member's interests |
so that his talents can be used to
