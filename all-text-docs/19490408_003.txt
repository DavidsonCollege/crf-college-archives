If the showings made by the Wildeat nine this week are
any portent for the future, then Davison followers. slyould
see some classy baseball before the season flees away. After a
series of games in which they were able to win only one, the
cats suddenly bounded back to bane out wins over William
und Mary and North Carolina State,

In trouneing William and Mary, Davidson looked like a
different team from the Which had been humbled by
Springfield on the local diamond earlier in the season. While
hitting was sufficient to account for the win, the Cats will
have to sharpen their batting eves to gain decisions in future
games, In general, howevey, the smooth fielding that the boys
exhibited surprised even the most optimistic.

'

Lt would be impossible to single out all the individual per:
formers who looked good on the diamond this pastaweek, but
mention should be made of the beautiful twirling jobs by
Dutch Hengeveld and Charlton Torrence. For Duteh, it was
his first win of the seasow after a shaky start in previous
games. Torrencé, in posting his win over the Wolfpack, racked
up a triumph over the team which had come from behind to
beat the Cats, 6-5, in an earlier game with Torrence handling
the pitching chores. One thing is certain... Jamerson has at
least two pitehers who should hold their own in any ‘company
this year

One of the more encouraging notes as far as local baseball
goes, is the creditable way in which Bert Andertou and Dick
Richards have closed the big gaps that were left in the out-
field when the season was in its embryonic spiges. Both
covered the pastures like hawks in the State tilt without a
miscue, Buddy Chandler is doing miglity well in his efforts to
make Coagt Charley forget that Dave Poole is absent from
the squad this year, Although he had a little trouble in the
State game, Buddy turned in a faultless performance against
William and Mary and has been working his pitchers well

rom here, it looks as though Derrick Barton ‘and his

“racketeers’’

are going to post another enviable record on
the tennis courts this year. After smashing their way over
Presbyterian, Georgia Tech and the University of South Caro
lina, the netters have not yet been put to the acid test of top
flight competition. In Yale, they may find it, for the boys
from New Haven gave the Cats a seare last year before bow-

iuy, 7-2,

With the completion of the work on the local tennis courts,
the Cats will be able to put in more hours of practice, Prior to
the Yale mateh, the boys were able to hold only scattered
practice sessions, but a look at the record thus far makes it
axppear‘as though they didn’t suffer from lack of work. By
the time of the UNC mateh, which is expected to be the big
test for the netters his year, the Cats should be primed for a
knovk-down-and-out battle,

With little Monty Hill leading the way, Davidson’s:golfers
bounced back from the State defeat by outpointing Catawba
20'2-6%, Monty fired a one under par 71 over the Charlotte
Cayntry Club coursewhich is good golf by any standard: In-
cidentally, during the summer, Monty accomplished what
every golfer hopes for at one time or anoher ... scoring a
hole-in-one on a 175-yard drive, during a Greensboro tourma-
