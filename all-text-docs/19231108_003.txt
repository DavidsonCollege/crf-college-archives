THE DAVIDSONIAN, NOVEMBER §&, 1923

Cox
Tackle N. C. State

FRESHMEN MEET YOUNG
GAME COCKS FRIDAY

The next opponent of the Davidson
Freshman football team is South Carolina.
Dope on the young Game Cocks is scarce
and though the Newberry Fresh beat them
by a small margin the memory of the defeat
handed the Wildkittens last year will
have them fighting to keep the Presbyter-
ians from getting revenge.

to

Davidson's Freshman team has been mak-
ing a splendid record this season, marred by
only one touchdown, and that made because
of heavy odds. At the beginning of the sea-
son Charlotte. was defeated 6-0, Furman was
held to a 0-0 score, P. C. suffered defeat
at their hands, 12-0, and last week State
meted out a defeat of 7-0, though the Wild-
cats outplayed them.

The game with South Carolina will be
watched with interest. ‘The team so far has
made a record to be proud*of and a defeat
handed to the Game Cocks, will only make
the record more enviable.

DEPUTATIONS TO NEARBY

students off the hill last week-end

Wildcats Meet Clemson Tigers Saturday
For First Grid Contest In Four

Years

evious Contests and Are Doped to
Again ¢

Of the 13 games played, Clemson has won
6 and Davidson 4, while 3 have resulted in
a tied score. ‘The last two contests went to
Clemson, so it is the Wildeats’ turn to win.

The following — list Clemson players
gives an average weight of 171, with a line
much heavier than Davidson's, But the
Wildeats accustomed to being out
weighed, and with even breaks on Friday
ought to take the Tigers out by a margin
of one or two touchdowns. Whatever the
final score, Clemson will know she has been
through a hard serap, for the Red and Black
machine is coming back strong

THE INFIRMARY ROLL

The Sophomore class is evidently the
healthiest the hill, An exam-
ination of the records of patients at the
infirmary shows that during the past
week one Senior, one Junior and four
Freshmen have paid the infirmary a visit.
Colds seem to be common ailments. The
Sophomores should be congratulated for
the vitality of their class asa whole, for
the record that they establish early in
the term and still maintain, Indeed the
vitality of the student body is to be com-
mended as well as the general health
conditions existing at Davidson. W. M.
Heston who-is in the hospital in Char-
lotte, is recovering from an operation
for appendicitis, and will probably be
back in school this week. Those who re-
ported to the infirmary last week are:

Wildkittens Outgain Teck Colts But
Lack Final Punch

In a game in which the Davidson Fresh-
men easily outelased the State new men, but
where the breaks went to the Techmen, the
latter won by the score of 7-0. The game
was played at Pinehurst last Thursday, be-
ing witnesed by a large crowd, and the sup-
erior playing of Davidson against apparent
odds won the merit and praise of the on-
lookers.

Time after time the Wildeats carried the
ball within striking distance the goal,
only to lose it by a fumble, an intercepted
pass, or the State team holding by its super-
jor weight. Again when it seemed that a
touchdown was eminent for Davidson,

EVOLUTION A DISTRACTION
FROM FAITH OF OUR
FATHERS

The: Ministerial Band held its regular
meeting Sunday afternoon in Shearer
Halil. In spite of the rainy weather a
large attendance came out to hear Dr.
Fraser Hood speak on Turning Aside.

people who talk continually of evolution
are doing so because of fear and not for
love of religion.” Thus evolution is be-
coming a burning bush to turn people's
thoughts aside from primary to second-

In conelusion Dr. Hood said that the
chief funetion of a minister is to keep
in, such intimate contaet with God that
he will constantly be receving messages
from Him.

ern Championship race last week, and W. &
