take the lead in tackling this
vital concern. Therefore, I pledge several
concrete action steps. First, we plan to ap-
peal to the Faculty Executive Committee to
. give this college community a full day off
for Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. We will use
a formal resolution, letters and

cial aid packages, and tenure practices.
Furthermore, the SGA will continue
to financially support organizations such
as OLAS, ISA, BSC, and FLAG and also
events aimed at promoting minority is-
sues. Then, we will work to

e-mails from students, and a

change the SGA bylaws to
require all Senators to par-.

petition with hundreds of names
as support. Second, we prom-
ise to send every faculty mem-
ber and administrator a copy:of
a resolution passed last spring
regarding diversity, hiring and
firing practices, and class op-
tions. By resubmitting this im-
portant document, we hope
these decision-makers will
more carefully evaluate our sug-
gestions.

Minority groups or
groups devoted to
this issue cannot

issue. We all must

help. Therefore, by

meetings, I promise
that the Student

which advocate cultural di-

events.

What Will
Follow?

What has happened on campus since this
incident (in reference to the racial slur written on
a poster) has been quite commendable. The
events of the past week did much for my confi-

dence in this school. White students, standing up
off previously apathetic seats, are clearly and
vocally joining others already in the struggle for
greater understanding. This reaction is applauded
and celebrated as a much needed first step. Now
an essential and previously missing component
is beginning to be filled.

However, as we all search for answers there
is one looming question: What will follow? Itis
great to see a community band together and face
the evil within its mist but what of next semester?
What of next year? Will these recent enlistees in
the struggle renew their commitment voluntarily
or will another incident be required to rekindle
their flame? Also, let us not forget the ones
whose minds are still closed to reality. What
force will be needed to jar their intellect? I stand
eager to aid those who step up to act. I also stand
looking, listening, and anticipating the answer to
these questions.

The Power of Two

Apathy stands at the real heart of the matter. Overall campus awareness

and tolerance must improve.

Kristen Taylor
Sophomore Perspective

Two words. That’s all it took to set the
campus on its ear last week, literally, as the
talk of the weekend was not the quintessen-
tial hook-up, but rather a racial slur. Then, a
ubiquitous yellow flyer magnified an iso-
lated incident of two words into a visual
assault a hundred times over. I am not dis-
counting the importance of advertising the
meeting, but I disagree with the sensational-
ist way in which the flyer was written. The
distributor of the flyer commented at the
meeting that she wanted everyone to be
affected in the same manner as the-original
hall that found the

sorbed with burning out light bulbs? As we
take all the correct steps to address the issue,
it remains to be seen whether anything can be
done to correct it. At the forum, mandatory
monthly meetings, workshops and a black
history core requirement were advocated al-
though making attendance mandatory only
resolves the issue of empty seats. As well,
this issue was manipulated into a vehicle to
push for a full day holiday for MLK Day.
Neither of these solutions adequately ad-
dresses the individual commitment to toler-
ance and acceptance that is needed. The only
realistic outcome focuses on affecting the
mindset of our community. By incorporating
the lesson 'we have learned into our everyday

life, we thereby make

The real heart of the matter, though, is

within ourselves and end it with two words of
