Sigma Chi's placed one each.

Height, Hustle, and Hoop-Rating
Make Frosh Cagers Club to Watch

By CHARLIE HASSELL

“You've got some excellent shots
on that team,” was N, C. State
Coach Everette Case's observation
after seeing his frosh squad down
Davidson's 79 to 56. That just
about sums up the freshman basket-
ball team’s greatest asset—offen-
sive play.

Freshman Coach Ray Brown has
high hopes for the Kittens’ coming
season. “I think we'll give any.
body a good game; that’s the tough-
est game the State freshmen had
had yet,” he said the morning af-
ter the opener. The State contest
mirrored the way the boys have
been playing at practice al! year.
They showed up well on offense,
setting an excellent percentage on
their shots. The large majority of
the shots were made from around
the foul circle, with just a few of
them being pushed in from under
the basket. But defensively they
looked like a group of guilty fresh-
men on court day—scared to death,
“We've got to work on our de-
fense; the boys aren’t getting with
their opponents and worrying
them,” Brown says. This is true
of practically the whole team, with
but one or two exceptions.

As for height, the freshmen can
put a team on the floor that makes
even the varsity look up to them.
They are tall everywhere except
the guards. George Melton, start-
ing center, is 6 6”. Bill Michael,
Ted Oldenburg, Graham Keith
Tim Gilley, and Bill Glidewell are
all well over the six foot mark. Of
course, there are a few short men,
Eddie Adams, a 5’ 9” guard from
Kentucky, being a glaring example
But Eddie is one of the best shots
on the team, evidenced by his
fifteen points against State. Dennis
Boyd also poured in fifteen points.

on the frosh squad. Aside from
those already mentioned, Sam Clare,
Johnny Gray, Easy Henley, Char-
lie Hasty, Alfred Wells, Sid Cutts,
Bill Sledge, Preston Barber,, and
John Holt may yet make their mark.
Brown plans to keep all of these
boys, unless they drop out of their
own accord,

The schedule for the Freshman
team is not a long one, but there
will be several good home games.
All of them will be preliminaries
for varsity, and the list includes
U.N.C., Clemson, Duke, Oak Ridge,
and another bout with State. In ad-
dition to these, they will play sever-
al games with junior colleges, the
first being Belmont Abbey tonight

This year’s Davidsonian All-Fraternity Football team is as representative as any that
have been selected in many years. Six different fraternities placed men on this year’s team,|.
with only two teams placing more than one man. This year's runner-ups, the Kappa Sigs,
placed the largest number on the team, having three men, selected. The SAL’s, with two men,

Seemore Simmons, Guard, KS

A holdover from last years first
team who once again came through,
was Seemore Simmons, Seemore
was the mainstay of a strong Kappa
Sig line. His crashing charges con-
stantly kept opposing backs in the
hole.

Wes Pritchard, Guard, Phi Delt
Wes is a lineman who just last
year was playing a lot of fresh-
men ball. However, this year he
switched over to the intramural
ranks and proved what made him
a mainstay of the freshman team.
Although he played a lot ‘at end,
Wes was selected as a lineman.
Mike Myers, Center, Beta
Mike Myers, this years All Fra-
ternity center, gained his starting
position largely because of his de-
fensive work. Mike was one of the
finest linebackers to be seen in a
long time. Besides being a top notch
defensive man, Mike was also a fine
offensive center.

Hil! to Bob were the cause of the
Betas lone defeat of the season.
Bill Bird, Back, KA

Bill Bird again proved to be one
of the finest running ahd passing
backs that the intramural field has
seen. His ability to dodge in-charg-
ing linemen, as well as his passing
ability earn him a place on this
year’s team,

Monty Hill, Back, SAE

Monty’s fine pass receiving as
well. as his running carn him a
place on the first team. When
Monty went out for passes he cov-
ered the entire field, and when he
did the passing he was able to spot
receivers all over the field. Not to
be forgotten was his fine running
ability.

Jim Sloan, Back, KS

“Slimy,” as Jim is called gains
his starting birth largely because
of his punting and passing. All dur-
ing the year “Slimy” got off beau-
tiful punts which kept opponents
backed up against their goal tines.
Not to be soon forgotten, either,
were his fine long passes, ‘
Johnny Kelton, Back, Sigma Chi

Johnny was the whole show for
this years Sigma Chi team, for he
did most of the passing and a large
‘part of the pass receiving. The
Sigma Chis flat passes to Johnny
constantly kept the opposing teams
on the alert.

Campus Interviews on Cigarette Tests
Number 8... THE SEA GULL .

“I’m not as gullible
as I look!’’

iw Mayte our little over-water friend is just fishing for _—

a compliment. On the other hand, he may have reference to
all these quick-trick cigarette tests you hear about nowadays.
Well, he’s not the only one who’s been at sea. Frankly, how can
you judge a cigarette by a swift sniff? Or another cigarette by one fast
puff. What's all the rush about, anyway? When it comes to
making up your mind about cigarette mildness,
we think you'd like to take your time.
That’s why we suggest:

The sensible test—the one that you make on a day

after day, pack after pack tryout for 30 days. It’s the
30-Day Camel Mildness Test! Simply smoke Camels—and
only Camels—for 30 days. Let your own “T-Zone”

(T for Throat, T for Taste) be your proving ground. When
you’ve tried Camels as a steady smoke, you'll know why...
