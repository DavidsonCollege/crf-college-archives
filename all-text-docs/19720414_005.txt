Innocents Abroad Face Smallpox

A smalipox outbreak in Yugo-
siavia, caused by a Moslem pil-
grim bearing contaminated holy
water from Mecca, has public
health officials in Europe and
the Mideast on the alert. Many
governments, fearful of an epi-
demic, have ordered mass vac-
cinations. The U. S. Public
Health Service sent a team of
American doctors to Yugoslavia
to train Yugoslav officials in the
use of an air-gun vaccine injec-
tor that can inoculate 1,000 peo-
ple an hour. (“The Wall Street
Journal”, April 4, 1972).

Kobert Touchton is presently
on Classics Abroad.

Looking for a completely uni-
que experience? Colt 45 may be
634% % more unique than being
midwife to a rhirmocerous, but it
loses to tall these gems.

Try waking up in Yugoslavia
one morning after having a lit
tle too much ouzo (a Greek
liquor) the night before in
Greece.

Or if that doesn’t fit your fan-
cy, how about finding yourself
in Zag.eb, Yugoslavia, without
a World Healh Orgaz.zation
vacc-nation form when there’s
smallpox all over the country
and you can’t get back into
Greece witnout that form.

1 thought the first was enough
of an experience. Actually, it's
not as bad a3 it sounds. I wasn’t
the victim of a white slave
trade. I was on a train from
Athens to Belgrade when 1
drank that ouzo, trying to im-
prove Greek-American relations.
(Wha. I won't do for my coum
trv.) A Greek man with a travel
bag full of vodka for his wife
and ouzo for himself offered
me some of the latter after he
got cn the train at Saloniki.

How could I turn him down?
When Tom Hatley, my travel-
mate, refused some, I had to
drink a litle. But three more-
than shot-glass-size diinks? What
could make me do such a thing
as that? Maybe it was a fore
knowledge of what was to come
when I crossed the border. All
I remember is the wait at the
border and a most uncomfor'-
able night sleeping with, an ov-
eractive heater right beside my
bed.

But getting into Yugoslavia is

easy compared to getting out.
To get out you have to have
that Lttle yellow form from
W.H.O., and mine was back ina
locked car trunk in Athens with
the key in Esmere, Turkey with
Steve Balkcom. I found out |
veeded it when I went to buy a
‘rain ticket from Belgrade to
Zagreb.

That was Saturday, and of
course the embassy was closed,
though I certainly tried to get
in. I did happen to run into a
doctor at the embassy who told
me he’d give me another form
for $20 if I'd come back Mon-
day.

Sound easy enough? Well, not
when you're going to Zagreb on
Sunday and already have your
tickes (we had to get out of Bel-
g.ade, a dirty, dingy, downcast
city). But, we noticed more and
more people with bandaids on
their upper arms as we walked

around Belgrade, and Tom
hadn't had a smallpox vaccina-
tica in nearly three years.

So, to Zagreb, a far more
beautiful city than Belgrade, and
an American consulate there.
B.ight and early Monday morn-
ing we walked in, and after a
short wait went in to see a
Croatian woman who told us
the consulate couldn't work
miracles, (I always thought from
tse movies that they could do
anything.)

I explained our situation to
the lady, and we debated whe:h-
er we could get a reply from
Dr. Davis or not in two days’
time (and whether the Greek
government would accept a tel-
egram).

She finally sent us to a hos-
pital with a set of sentences on
sheets of paper that we could
use like deaf-mute cards to get
the:e and find an English-speak-

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

To the Editor:
Here is a copy of a leter sent
March 30 to Mr. Cornell:

Ja the last issue of THE DA-
VIDSONIAN, the students were
informed that tuition has again
gone up, by the mere sum of
$225. I feel, as do most of my
peers, that this increase is bo.h
unjustified and unethical. Un-
ethical in as much as we were
asked to put down a deposit for
next year before your office
formally rotified us of the in-
crease.

Davidson Coliege has grown
tremendously. Not in student
body bw rather in unneeded
personnel. The admin‘stration
has added several highly paid
administrators (with personal
secretaries) who have been ex:
tremely ineffic:ent.

Your job is to cut cost, but
rather you seem to encourage.
inefficiency. Did you know that
the registrar can.not even tell
a student how to declare a ma-
jor? Mr. Stacks suggested to
you that the laundry cease use
of paper wrappings for laundry
(for a $1,000 savings) but you
urmed him down. Why?

And of course we all are well

aware of how Davidson College’s
plethora of custodians and
grounds men earn their money.
That is by fertilizing trees twice
a year and wasting time. The
list goes on. But, I need not re-
mind you of these things as you
are paid $30,000 to see it for
yourself.

However, 1 would like to tell
you that perhaps a very big
reason why applications and stu-
dent calibie is on the decrease
is due to Davidson's skyrocket.
ing costs. My brother is a merit
scholar finalist, an All-Virginia
Madrical, All-Virginia jazz mu-
sician (sax, flute, and clarinet),
has board scores of 1400 and is
an A student. He has decided
no. to come to Davidson. Why?
Because for the price he feels
he can do better. He is mot
alone.

How do you justify your ac-
tons? Please do not bore me
with bull-shit about inflation.
Expectantly awaiting a reply.

ing doctor. (As it turned out,
there wasn’t one.)

No. even those old movies of

food lines in Europe after the
war prepared me for what I
was going to see at the hospital.
There were lines of people ev-
erywhere, pushing and shoving
each other, all trying to get in
ta get their vaccination. We
showed our third deaf-mu:‘e sen-
tcace to a lady who looked like
a nuise.

Up the stairs and down the
stairs we were led, up to a pri-
vate office and then back down
to the mob scene in the lobby.
Finally a nurse appeared who
listened to our situa.ion and de-
cided that we'd just as well go
ahead and get the vaccinations
since Tom needed one and I
had little choice if I wanted to
go back to Greece to meet Pro-
fessor Labban on time.

We were escorted into one of

year that, despite allegations
from Davidson professors that
his immaturity is showing, the
year not only will be rewarding
but also will create no special
difficulties in re-entering David-
son, in readjusting to Davidson's
academic routine, nor in being
accepted by a graduate school.

An important difference be-
tween the experience at one of
the Eight College Exchange
schools and at a state university

the vaccination rooms, ahead of
about 35 Yugoslavians who a!
most didn’t let me_ through.
(There po US-Yugolsav_ rela-
ticas!) The nurse checked with
the doctor in charge, who said
1 should get the vaccination.

Give the murse your passport
and your 20 Dinar and roll up
your sleeve. The prick. Then sit
down there while they process
the forms and look at the people
fighting to get in the room. One
elderly lady with bright red
cheeks almost cried when the
door closed on her and she had
to wait ‘ul next’ time. Shortly
our passports and completed
forms came back. Mission ac-
complished.

Colt 45, who needs it? I'll
stick with PBR and get my
kicks in other, slightly more
exotic, ways.

Now if I can just get back
into Greece. .. .

Church-Related Colleges May Get Federal Aid

Like most private colleges, church-related private col-
leges are hav.ng financial problems. However, they may
soon be able to receive direct federal aid. In a recent U.S.
Supreme Court decision, any institution of higher learning
was given the r.ght to qualify fur direct federal aid provid-
ed that its educational function 1s not distorted by its relig-
ious commitment.

According to Chief Justice Burger, ‘institutions with
admittedly religious functions but whose predominant edu-
cation mission is to provide their students with a secular
education” are entitled to federal aid.

New Medical Schools Proposed

The Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs has ap-
proved a bill that would authorize $625-million over a five-
year period to help set up 10 new medical schools. Veterans
Administration hospitals would provide student-training
faeil:ties for these schools. The House of Representatives
has passed a bill providing for the creation of five new
medical schools connected with VA hospitals.

However, many medical school officials do not feel the
Veterans Administration should become involved in ad-
ministering medical education.

Students Help Taxpayers

Students in over 120 American colleges ana universi-
ties are helping low-income taxpayers fill out their tax re-
turns. The students, most of whom are studying law, busi-
ness, or accounting, have taken a training course sponsored
by the Internal Revenue’s Volunteer Income Tax Assist-
ance (VITA).

The Internal Revenue Service hopes the program will
help save these low-income taxpayers some of the $66-
million lost each year by taxpavers who do not realize that
thev are entitled to refunds and therefore never file for
them. A VITA program official said, ‘college students are
really the future of this whole program.”
