Faculty Religious Requirements Should
Be Changed For Academic Improvement

In view of the recent concern over
the religious requirements pertaining
to the Davidson faculty, and par-
ticularly in the light of the great
variety of opinions expressed by the
faculty on this matter, the DAVID-
SONIAN wishes to present the follow-
ing proposals:

1. The rule requiring the Presi-
dent of Davidson College to be a Pres-
byterian should be modified. It is
reasonable, and. we believe. generai-
ly acceptable to faculty, students, and
alumni, that the president of a Pres-
byterian college should be a Presby-
terian—in most cases. Certainly it is
not very likely tin the foreseeable
future, at any rate) that the Board of
Trustees would pick a non:Presbyte-"
rian to head a school confrolled by the
Southern Presbyterian Church.

Nevertheless. there are conceiva;
ble circumstances in which. a man
would be otherwise acceptable to the
Trustees. but might not be a Presby-
terian. To provide for such a case,
we recommend that the rule be
changed from an inflexible require-
ment in the Trustee’s Charter and By-
Laws to a statement of general policy
that could be waived on appropriate
occasions.

2. The rule requiring seventy-five
per cent Of the full professors to be
Presbyterians shovid be done away
with completely. As a check on the
content of teaching (if it is intended
to be such), this rule is a failure. To
require that three-quarters of the top
jobs on the faculty be held by Pres-
byterians does little to control the
content of teaching in the school as
a whole—for this purpose. the dis-
tinction between full professor and
the lower faculty ranks is a useless
one. Furthermore, such a requirement
would tend to make some men be-
come Presbyterians in response to
economic and social pressures, not out
of personal conviction.

Finally, this rule can act as an
impediment to the promotion of able
teachers. perhaps even causing them
to leave Davidson altogether. And
many non-Presbyterians who might
otherwise take jobs teaching here are
deterred by the knowledge that. they
would be. in a sense, ‘second-class
citizens’ ‘of the college community. At
a time in which qualified teachers are
increasingly harder to find. we won-
der whether Davidson can afford to
handicap herself in this way.

3. The rule setting up special doc-
trinal requirement for teachers of Bi-
ble and Philosophy, and requiring
them ail to be Presbyterians, should
be revoked. To limit the content of
these courses to Southern Presbyte-
rian Bible and Southern Presbyterian
Philosophy, which is clearly the aim
of the rule. is out of place, even in a

Southern Presbyterian college. It
would be better to have these courses
oriented in a generally Protestant
framework (as they are now, in prac-
tice), and better still to have such
courses taught objectively, without
any particular doctrinal slant, by a
staff that would include men of vary-
ing religious viewpoints. We feel that
it would be of great educational value
to let Davidson students, as part of a
liberal education, choose for them-
selves between conflicting opinions in
matters of such importance.

4. The religious oath required of
all professors should be done away
with. This requirement is similar to
the seventy-five pér cent rule, in that.
it makes a distinction between facul-
ty ranks that has no relevance to the
content of teaching in the classroom.
It looks as though the purpose is to
keep the top rung of the academic
ladder in “safe” hands—certainly not
very commendable. from the view-

point of academic freedom. At least |

one man now on the faculty has re-
peatedly refused promotion to full

professor because of conscientious .

scruples against taking such an oath.
Others may take it “with their fingers
crossed,” simply to obtain promotion,
making the oath itself an empty for-
mality. Such an oath is.a standing bar-

‘rier to many well-qualified men who

otherwise would come to Davidson.

5. The rule requiring all members
of the faculty to be members of “some
evangelical Church” should be modi-
fied and made more flexible. In addi-
tion to the fact that Davidson is auto-
matically excluding a great many ca-
pable teachers by this rule, there is
a powerful educational reason for
such a change. The present policy
prevents the Davidson student from
having any direct intellectual contact
with intelligent, well-trained ren who
have a religious outlook different
from the one to which they have been
exposed in their childhood. This
means that. as far as the college is
concerned, the student’s viewpoint is
to be kept permanently narrow in
certain areas. Such a situation. in
which certain types of ideas are kept
off the market and an_ intellectual
monopoly established. is incompatible
with the basic aims of a liberal edu-‘
cation.

We realize that Davidson is a col-
lege in the Protestant tradition, and
that most of its teaching staff should
be Protestants under any circum-
stances, but we urge that this rule
be modified to allow, in special cases,
the hiring of teachers with.a different
religious orientation in order to
remedy difficult personnel shortages
and to broaden the intellectual hori-

zons of the student body.—C.H.C.

Davidson Sabbath - 1850 -

The recent discussion concerning
overcrowded conditions in Vespers,
and the possibility that, from time to
time, certain classes may be exempted
from required attendance brings to
mind the question. how was the Sab-
bath observed: at Davidson a hundred
or more years ago?

The following letter written by
Stephen D. Ramseur, a Davidson stu-
dent, to his sister on October 17, 1853
gives an interesting and factual ans-
wer:

“You asked me how | spend the
Sabbath day here. In the morning at
Sunrise | go to prayers in the Chapel
from there we go to breakfast, and
then there is about an hour until Sab-
bath School, which time | spend in

reading my Bible. It is about 11
o'clock when Sabbath School breaks

up, and then we listen to a sermon

from one of the members of the
Faculty. After the morning sermon,
I read some good book (I am reading
Dodriges “Rise and Progress of Re-
ligion”) which | hope may prove of
lasting benefit to me. At three o'clock
all of the Students go up to the Chapel
and recite a Bible lesson to Dr. Wil-
tiamson which is very interesting and
instructive, and we have another ser-
mon Sabbath night. Yes, Dearest
Sister, | try to spend the Sabbath in
a way as | think will please my Father
in Heaven, and will be beneficial to
my never dying soul.”

Ramseur left Davidson in 1855 to
enter West Point. He became a Con-
federate general in the War between
the States, and was killed in that con-
flict.

PISTOLS MORE DANGEROUS THAN BOURBON

President Kuykendall Reverses Opinion On Firearms;
Student Councilmen Favor Constitutional Amendment

By ED ARMFIELD
Davidsonian Managing Editor
Last week The DAVIDSON.

IAN asked President John Kuy-
kendall and the Student Council
a vital question. That question
was: Which is more dangerous
in a dormitory room, a bottle of
bourbon whiskey or a .38 pistol?
Partly as a result of this article
there has been a move on cam-
pus to prohibit the possession
of firearms in dormitories by
including this in the Student
Body Regulations. Last week
President Kuykendall appointed
a committee to look into the
possibility of such a rule. Mem-
bers of this committee aré
John Huie, Dee Green and Char-
lie Rutherford.

CHANGE OF HEART

Several weeks ago in an in-
terview with The DAVIDSON-
IAN, Kuykendall opposed such
a move, saying that he thought .
this would be “spreading the
Council too thin.” Now he-has
had a change of heart and is
in favor of bringing enforce-
ment under the Council. .Kuy-
kendall explained this by say-
ing, “It is my firm conviction |
that firearms must be kept out
of the dormitories. Originally,
! did not feel that it would be
necessary to enact an amend-
ment to the Student Body Reg-
ulations because of the strength
of student opinion on the mat-
ter. I¢ has become apparent,
however, that we are still faced
with the problem. Therefore, |
am in agreement with the pro-

posed move to bring about stu-
dent legislation in the form of
an amendment to Article %X.”

John went on to say that
there was a very good chance
that such an amendment will be
discussed at the regular Coun-
cil mecting, Monday, October
27. A formal amendment could
be offered to the Student Body
on the following Friday.

USE OF ARMORY

One of the solutions as to
where guns could be kept for
students wishing to have them
for hunting purposes lies in an
offer from the R. 0. T. C. de-
partment. This was mentioned
by Tom Cutting who said that
along with a Student Body Reg-
ulation, “a place should be pro-
vided for firearms . . .a plan
of putting them in the R. O. T.
C. armory is now being devel-
oped.”

Kuykendall, in discussing this
possibility, stressed the fact
that Colonel Adams wants the
“gun clab” to be as autonomous
as possible, a feature which
would be practical with respon-
sible leaders.

The idea of keeping weapons
in the armory seems to have
found favor with quite a few
Council members who recognize
the valtte of a gun for reerea-
tional uses. Sophomore Verner
Stanley thought that such an
arrangement “would not ser-
iously inconvenience sportsmen
and would insure the safety of
our college.”

Several Councilmen were in

favor of amending such a Stu-
dent Body Regulation on the
grounds that the present rule,
supposedly enforced by the fac-

utly, is confusing and ineffec-

tive. Dee Green, Junior Class
president, favors student en-
forcement because, “We have
rules with teeth in them egainst
drinking and, to me, this mat-
ter of firearms is a much more
serious issue.” John Huile rec-
ognized that while “this rule
will not eliminate the possibil-
ity of another accident, it cer-
tainly is @ step in the right di-
rection which seems essential.”

Councilmen-roommates, Char-
lie Rutherford and Sam Sloan
both spoke out in favor of a
new Student Regulation, Char-
lie saying, “The most effective
way to prevent future accidents

is through a Student Body Reg-

ulation” and Sam adding. “With
anew rule... the individual
and the Council will both know
where they stand.”

RUMORS OF WEAPONS

Sophomore Spiro Macris ad-
ded that, “Even though such a
new rule may reflect on the
Student Body’s sense of respon-

sibility .. . in the light of ru-
mors that some students have
weapons in their rooms this

year—this in spite of requests
by both Administration and
Student Council not to do so—
a definite rule is necessary.”
Bob _ Livingston's. comment
was that, “An amendment to
Article 1X . . .would be struc-
turally simpler than the pres-

Cole’s Classic . . . . . By Popular Demand

LETTER TO EDITOR

Complacent Faculty Reprimanded
For Missing Political Program

Dear Editor:

This Tuesday night I saw
three Davidson professors sit-
ting in the middle of four poli-
ticians who had come to the
campus to speak on couurent

campus to speak on current
events and their party plat-
forms, domestic and foreign.

Some Davidson professors
would avoid association with
“politicians.” I have had the
privilege of being taught by
each of these professors. Last
year was the first year at Da-
vidson for two of these men,
and I believe that they are the
best thing that ,has happened
to Davidson since I have been
here. In addition to being good
instructors, these three men
really think for themselves,
something that is unusual at
Davidson, even (or especially)
on the part of professors. But
they also are very well in-
formed and have facts at their
command.

PEANUTS

PEANE TS

Almost all of our other pro-
fessors were conspicuous by
their absence. Perhaps they
would say that they are disin-
terested rather than uninter-
ested, but the fact remains, they
were not there, which implies
that they are not concerned. I
believe that it would be a very
good thing for Davidson, and its
students, if the majority of its
professors would show more
concern, if not interest, in cur-
rent events and_ international
relations.

LACK OF INTEREST

This lack of interest in the
rest of the world on the part
of the administration is evident
even in the curriculum of the
school. For many years the
Political Science Department
has struggled along with one
(1) professor, even after Dr.
Ford left. The course, “History
of American Foreign Policy,”
although a history course (83)
was dropped this year, even

though it is carried in the cata-
logue, for this reason: Dr. Spen-
cer, the former professor of the
course, left Davidson, and the
History Department had no one
who would (or could) teach the
course. But it refused the offer
of the Political Science Depart-
ment (one man) to teach the
course, for purely department-
al reasons.
WEAK IN AWARENESS

This school is strong in His-
tory, Bible, and (Classical)
Greek; but this strength is al-
most a weakness, when it is not
counter-balanced by more mo-
dern courses. This school is
strong in tradition, but weak in
awareness and concern about
what is happening today, and
may happen in the future.

At the risk of being consid-
ered a free thinker, I would
advocate that the administra-
tion and faculty be a little more
“progressive,” or, more simply,
“interested.”

Bob Hoagland

amendment, Richard advocated
“such action by the Student
Council which would impress
upon the Student Body the feel-
ing that firearms are not wank

cally desirable, and should be

THE PHILOSOPHES

Needed: A New
View Of Vocation

By OAVID ROBINSON

The fall of each year wit-
nesses the parleying of enlister
and enlistee, of businessman,
research expert, foundation rep-
resentative, or graduate school
devotee and the Davidson jun-
ior or senior. Conversations be-
tween the forces center upon
the subject of occupation and
occasionally deepen to border
upon vocation.

A portion of the emphasis of
the recent visit of the Rocke-
feller Brothers Institute to Da-
vidson illustrates the mood of
a majority of such conversa-
tions.

They, es others, would
like to harness to their
Program or industry a
talented, somewhat open-
minded, and relatively un-
committed group of stu-
dents for experimental par-
ticipation with a view to-
ward continuation. Commit-
ment is promised as well as
livelihood, vocation as well
8s occupation. Necessary in
the spiritual attitude of the
student is a willingness to
consider; the hardening of
willingness into devotion to
job is theirs to perform.
Proponents and participators

in the professions of ministry,
teaching, and similar occupa-
tions of high psychic value just-
ly feel the need of compensat-
ing for the lack of lucrative at-
tractiveness found therein in

their publicity to the coming
generation. This sentiment
leads to the founding of fellow-
ship programs offering oppor-
tunity for the pondering of en-
trance into the particular oc-
cupation.
Vocation means calling,
2 variousty-administered in-
sistence from above by an
entity other than the once
called, implying almost ex-
plicitly o third dimension,
the voice of God acting in
history; it means a re-
sponse in deepest subject-
ivity to highest objectivity.
Enlister and enlistee have
alike perverted such a doc-
trine, by removing the all-
important participation of
God and by enmeshing
themselves in an often even
unhumanistic competition.
We at Davidson — at some
time ourselves to be ap-
proached for enlistment—share
in the poverty of the concept
of vocation. We gain our will-
ingness to consider from many
sources: the appeal of an estab-
lished firm, the influence of a
physician father, and the op-
portunity for advancement, to
mention but a few. Such will-
ingness to consider obliterates
our willingness to commit, for
that into which the Davidson
students proceeds can involve
no commitment, or, at most,
that partial hardening of the
years which renders man gently
insensible to other than egoistic
value. 5
Our responsibility lies along
a refiningly-defined narrow
path. A consciousness of abili-
ties and limitations, manifested
in self-criticism, and an ever-
deepenng awareness of need
must be combined with a con-
stant openness to the “voca” of
God in order to restore mean-
tg to the experience of voca-
ion.
