Important Role

Faculty

By LLOYD

Davidsonian News Editor

Committees of the Davidson College faculty perform a
large number and wide variety of functions.

Divided into two categories, ap-
pointive and elective, there are
twenty eight of these committees
listed in the present college cata-
logue. Since Davidson is a faculty
governed institution, subject to the
control of the trustees, these com-
mittees are of great importance,
and their recommendations are us-
ually accepted.

Dr. C. J. Pietenpol, as Dean of
Faculty, is one of the key figures
in the committee system, He serves
as chairman of the Curriculum
Committee and is a permanent
member of the Executive Com-
mittee. Both of these committees
are elected by the faculty and sub-
mit their reports and recommenda-
tions to the faculty for approval.

CURRICULUM COMMITTEE

The Curriculum Committee is
made up of six members beside
the Dean of Faculty, three elected
from the faculty at large, and one

elected from each of the three
main divisions of curriculum, that
is, natural science, social science,
and the humanities. In addition to
Dean Pietenpol, Professors C. K
Brown, Cumming, Gallent, John-
ston, Lilly, and MeGeachy are the
present members.

Some of the problems facing
these men at the present time are

those of planning course descrip-
tions for the new catalogue, re-
examing the present basis of

with the matter of an inter-semester break.

The committee. on the Court of

Vernon Hunter, presented its re
port to the Council

Hunter presented several recom
mended changes in the Freshman
Regulations. He said that the pur

It was also recommended that the |
Court be brought back into Chapel. |
By screening the cases before they |

were presented in chapel,
Court could lend real construe

tiveness to maintaining the Fresh-

man Regulations.

There was lively discussion on!

the regulation that . Freshmen
should “show respect to upper
¢lassmen at all times.” Hunter's
report recommended that this
phrase be incorporated in another
rule. stating simply that Fresh-

Some members favored continuing |

the present and separate rule that
Freshmen should “show respect to
upperclassmen “at all times.” A
motion to keep the rules separate
was defeated.

There was discus

also. some

The “D” Club held its third meet-
ing of the year last Monday night.
After President Ed Speir opened
the meeting and disposed of the
preliminaries, Watt MeCain put
fon a one-man preview of what
‘could develop into the 1956 “D”
Club. Foolies, the first event of,

As there is a shortage of avail-

qualified to be directors are re-|

Being in good shape financi-
ally, the club discussed a possible
scholarship or other project which

sent Davidson athletic policy made

‘the “D"” Club financial means.

ed the committee, Hunter
recommended, that the Freshmen
be allowed to take off their caps
and name tags before the regula:
time if they win the Freshmen
Sophomore Day contest. Council
man Bondurant said that he agreed
on the point of allowing the Fresh
men to take off their caps if they
won the contest, since the pur
pose of the caps is to build class
spirit. However, he said that the
committee was putting the wrong
emphasis on the matter of the
nume tags, since the purpose of
the: name tags to learn the
names of the Freshmen. The Coun-
cil concurred on this observation

Next, the Council was presented
with a plan to have an inter-semes-
ter break. Councilman Bill Bondu-
rant showed the Council a plan
that he, President Anderson, and
Councilman Linny Baker had
drawn up. The plan called for a
shortening of the registration
period at the beginning of school
in September and several other
changes which are designed to
streamline the time it takes to get
classes started in September.

In addition to gaining an extra
day in September, another day
would be gained by cutting off
one day at the beginning of the
Christmas holidays. The result of
these two extra days would be a
possible inter-semester break. De-
tails of this plan were not com-
pleted at the meeting, but they
