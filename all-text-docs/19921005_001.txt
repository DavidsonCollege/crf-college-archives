Reporter Discusses ©
Thomas Supreme
Court Hearings -

By Russ Tarver

Timothy Phelps, one of two
reporters who exposed Anita Hill’s
allegations of sexual harassment
against Supreme Court Justice
Clarence Thomas, spoke in the 900
Room on Thursday, September 24.
Phelps. author of the recently pub-

lished Capitol Games: Clarence’

Thomas, Anita Hill, and the Story
ofa Supreme Court Nomination, is
the Supreme Courtreporter for New
York Newsday Magazine.

Soon after the June 17, 1991
resignation of Supreme Court Jus-
tice Thurgood Marshall, Phelps be-
gan researching Clarence Thomas’
background. Inthe process, Phelps
discovered Hill’s accusations
against Thomas.

_ When he first interviewed
those who knew Thomas, he re-
ceived conflicting observations of
Thomas’ character. “I began to
think after only a few days that I
was reporting on two different
people,” said Phelps. Some of his
sources were very positive about
Thomas, while others were ex-

tremely negative. “I heard stories
about people who were fired by

having messages pinned to their

chairs...I started scratching my
head and wondering what was go-
ing on,” said Phelps.

After.detailing his. extensive
research, Phelps attempted to ex-
plain the reasoning behind the Ju-
diciary Committee’s decision to
continue Thomas’ confirmation
proceedings. ““We [Phelps and co-
author Helen Winternitz] found, in
researching the book, that so many
Senators had been touched by scan-
dal of some kind oranother that the
Senate, as an institution, was inca-
pable of challenging the moral cre-
dentials of a Supreme court nomi-
nee.”

After further commentary,
Phelps opened the floor for ques-
tions.

The 1992-93 McGee Visiting
Professor of Writing, Elizabeth
Benedict, extended the invitation

Longtime Librarian
Meeks Retires After
13 Years of Service

By Sarah Sadowski

The days of “Merde!” as the
opening salutation atthe E.H. Little
Library’ s circulation desk are over.
On Wednesday, September 30, Pat
Meeks, the incomparable charac-
ter and chieftain of circulation, re-
tired after 13 years of service to the
Davidson College community.

Meeks has been a long-time
member of the Davidson commu-
nity. Her husband, Walter Meeks,
was a professor in the French de-
partment, and the two directed two
of Davidson’s JY-Montpellier,
France programs, the firstof which

was only the second year of the
program’s existence.

Meeks began hercareer as cir-
culation supervisor in 1979. Since
that year, she has coordinated all

“aspects of circulation, including

the supervision of 35-40 workstudy
students each year. The flow of
students, professors, and commu-
nity members to and from the cen-
tral circulation area made her one
of the most visible employees of
the library.

Her sharp wit, smooth tongue,

Filmmaker Spike Lee
to Visit Davidson
"Rap Session" Set For October 21

By Katrice Shuler
On Wednesday, October 21,
Davidson will welcome a “righ-
teous black man” (Buggin’ Out,
Do the Right Thing). In a bold
reaction against the obstacles fac-
ing minorities in the college com-

munity, the Union Speakers Com- |

mittee, the Black Student Coali-
tion, the Public Lectures Commit-
tee, the Dean of Students Office
and the Love of Learning Program
will sponsor "A Rap Session with
Spike Lee."

Lee, a graduate of Morehouse
College in Atlanta and of New
York University’s film school, will
answer questions ranging from film
to race relations. He presently

~“teachesacourse on film at Harvard,

runs Forty Acres and a Mule Film
Works, ownsarecording company,

writes books on filmmaking and _

preaches a synthesis of Malcolm
X’s and Martin Luther King, Jr.’s

. teachings.

At his most recent speaking
engagement at UNC-Chapel Hill
on Friday, September 18, Lee
spoke out in favor of a Black

Cultural Center. Many in atten-
dance’ supported his views, but
many opposed his angry statements
about racial relations.

Lee merits both praise and
criticism from his movies as he
reminds the audience that African-
Americans have been taught to hate
themselves, their race, and their
heritage. He controls every aspect
of production to prevent corrup-
tion of his vision by juggling the
roles of writer, producer and direc-
tor of his movies (excepting the
screenplay of the upcoming re-
lease of Malcolm X, which was
written by James Baldwin and
Arnold Pearl).

~ Inhis first feature film, She's
Gotta Have It (1986), he explores
the life of a sexually over-active
African-American woman and
draws accusations of sexist over-
tones.

Hisnext movie, 1988's School
Daze, caused such controversy
during the filming that Morehouse,
Lee’s own alma mater, refused to
allow him to finish filming on cam-
pus because Lee chose to depict

prejudices among African-Ameri-
cans based on skin tone.

In 1989 Lee released his most
controversial film, Do the Right
Thing. Critics claimed that the
climatic riot scene advocated vio-
lence, Lee's characters acted as ste-
reotypes, and the deletion of drugs
from the movie created an unreal-
istic atmosphere. Some accused
the film of affecting the NY may-
oral election between David
Dinkins and incumbent Ed Koch.

1990’s Mo’ Better Blues raised
feminists’ eyebrows with his lack
of depth in female roles. Some
critics felt that the movie was a
muddled mess in light of his previ-
ous work. |

Jungle Fever (1991) makes a
Statement against interracial rela-
tionships by showing that the issue

Lee’s latest project, Malcolm
X, will be released November 20.
The film is already being labelled
controversial. After wresting the
legacy of Malcolm X from direc-

get committee prioritizes based on
recommendations made by the
Admissions office. Admissions
initially makes proposals accord-
ing tocomparisons of Davidson to
various colleges and universities.

Forexample, faculty compen-
sation has been one of two priori-
ties for the past several years. The
school has made significantstrides
to become competitive in this area,
deemed “absolutely essential to
maintaining a quality faculty,” by
Sutton. Currently its budgetary
allotment towers over any other
individual budget division.

Financial aid closely follows
Academic Affairs in order of pri-
ority by Davidson. According to
the Financial Aid office, 60% of
the student body receive some form
of assistance, from merit scholar-
ships to work study compensation
and thirty percent of it is solely
need based. Financial aid budget-
