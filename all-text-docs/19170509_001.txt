Colonel Scofield
Passes to His Reward

Had Lived More Than Fifty Years
in Davidson.

An omnious hush crept over the cam-
pus Wednesday when the news spread
that Colonel Scofield has passed to his
reward. Altha the Colonel had been
laboring under a dread disease for some
time, his death was rather unexpected.
A distinct shock was felt among the
students, and their hearts made sorrow-
ful when, in reminiscence, the familiar
figures of the Colonel was summoned
only to be saddened by the thought that
he is no more.

Colonel Scofield was one of the best
known inhabitants of Davidson. He
was born in 1847, in Columbia, S. C.
In 1857 his family moved to Davidson.
The father of the Colonel was a con-
tractor and received the contract for the
construction of Chambers building. At
the completion of this task the family
moved to Illinois by wagon, where they
remained during the war. Meanwhile.
his father died, and Mrs. Scofield with
her son returned to Davidson in 1867.

In 1870 the little grocery and confec-
tionery store was established. This
marked the beginning of Colonel Sco-
field’s business career at Davidson. He
has since proved himself ‘to be one of the
most prominent merchants and busines
men of the locality. He was builder o/
the liren mill, and also helped lay on
the telegraph lines in the community
For some years he was the efficient sta
tion agent for the. railway company
Later the Colonel was emoploved ir
building the Y. M. C. A. building ane
the church. He was also active in the
service of his church and held severa’
offices. He was a deacon and for some
time treasurer. [1] health finally forced
the Colonel to give up his more active
duties to live a quiet life. He had re
mained undisturbed in his store until hi

death.

At 3:30 Thursday afternoon — the
funeral services were conducted in the
Presbyterian Church by Dr. Richards.
A large number of the town people and
a good many of the students showed
their‘ lovalty and respect for the “Old
Colonely” by attending the funeral serv-
ices and later going in solemn procession
to stand with bowed heads before the
grave. The high esteem with which the
Colonel was held was fully evidenced
by the great abundance of flowers. pre-
sented as tokens of love from friends, in-
chiding the students. The pall-bearers
were the officers of the church. An hon-
orary escort was composed of the pres-
ident of the student body. the old and
new presidents of the Y. M. C. A., and
the presidents of the classes.

The students heartily sympathize with
the close friends and relatives of Colonel
Scofield. We feel that we have lost a
sincere friend, but our loss is his gain.
far he has heen called to a higher life.

Mrs. C. F. Myers. Mrs. A. W. Mc-
Alister, mother of J. W. McAlister, '19.
and L. L. McAlister, ’20, accompanied
Mr. Mvers and Mr. Hamtree, who
came from Greensboro to attend the last
Y. M.C. A. service of the year.
