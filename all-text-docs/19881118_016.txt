From RELIGION, page 12

me that he would stand for his faith “no matter what the
government might do to him.” I also attended a prayer
meeting one night at the apartment of a girl named Ana,
who is about my age and is crippled with a severe limp.
Watching Ana and her friends sing praises to God in that
tiny two-roomed apartment, meeting weekly and risking
jobs, family, and education because their faith in God take

higher precedence in their lives, I thought about how often

people take religion for granted in the United States.

Anaand her friends know that although they do not have
external freedoms in all circumstances, they have beliefs
‘which no one can ever take away from them.

What does religious freedom really mean to us? Do we
take opportunities to worship God as often as we can when
there are numerous opportunities and no risks involved?
Are we thankful for true religious freedom?

We really are blessed because we do not have to suffer
for our beliefs. I hope, however, that we do not forget
those in Poland and other countries who are risking their
lives due to a lack of religious freedom. I only saw a
glimpse of the value of religious freedom while I was in
Poland, a country of contrasts.

From RECYCLING, page 12

two huge dumpsters, complimented one another on the
excellent job of sorting, and went home feeling peachy.
Scare tactic: If Mecklenburg County doesn’t recycle, the
landfills will be landfulls in one year, (y’know, give or
take...). Fortunately, this doesn’t concern us because, A.
Most of us are not from Mecklenburg county, B. The col-
lege will find some place to put its trash, C. (your answer
here).
Nobody is to blame for this crisis. Everyone is to blame.
_In other words, the recycling committee needs your help.
Don’t panic...you don’t have to join the committee, and
~ you don’t even have to volunteer to help sort, ner drive, ner
nothin’ (although I think they would genuinely appreciate
it if you could volunteer some time). What they DO need
is a small effort on the part of the college community as a
whole to take the time to sort your throwaways (eek! time!!

Iain’t got much!) And the best part is...itdoesn’ ttake much
time!

One example of aiding the effort was the recent UNION
BOARD decision to buy paper plates and cups for all
Union events instead of the universal environmental bad
guy, styrofoam. Several Patterson Court houses did the
same thing earlier in the year. Some say styrofoam has
gotten a bad rap, but it is a perfect example of an innocent

lil’ everyday object that is clogging our landfills. Why? *

Because styrofoam NEVER GOES AWAY. It’s dish-
washer safe, light as air, and will still be in its present form
1000 years from now (unless incinerated). It should be
mentioned that paper is more expensive, but environ-
mental damage is far more costly still.

Look inside the blue plastic barrels in the Union next
time you walk by, and see if there’s any paper, styrofoam,
wrappers, i.e. NON-recyclables inside. Odds are there will

be, and sorting it out, according to the shedmen (shed-
women agree), is a hassle. So please do what you can by
putting only appropriate recyclables in the Union barrels.
Basically, it would make the whole process run MUCH
more smoothly if people pitched it where they’re ‘posed
to.

And/JF you should happen to have a few spare minutes
next time you’re in Chambers, take a look at the recycling
info bulletin board (first floor, coming from Belk, on the
left). The recycling folks would love to have all the help
they can get, but even if they can’t get your help, having
your interest and support is just as important. Thank you
very much, and long live the landfill!

From LETTER, page 12

that just sounds silly. Since I’m not getting graded on this,

I will cater to no one’s linguistic idiosyncrasies but my
own. And I know the Quayle joke’ s old. Hey, nobody’s ~
making you read this.

The fact is that when the sun starts setting early and Jack
Frost starts nipping at our noses, Davidson students start to

become bogged down in sedentary pursuits. If they’re not
flocking to the library in a stress frenzy, then they’re bound ©

for dark smokey rooms.to commune with VCRs. (Ciga-
rette smoke, you understand. There’s no drug use here in
Camelot. Or in the NFL either. Or the Panamanian
cabinet.) Some of us just sit around and drink too much,
but then, that’s not a seasonally or locationally particular
pursuit. My theory, Sam, and I came up with this about a
minute and a half ago, is that most of the creative, interest-

ing people are cither mired in apathy, or they’re too busy

‘conducting chemistry experiments on their brains to pro-

vide much entertaining diversion. Stoned people, while
_they are no doubt having a lovely time themselves, are

about as entertaining as a Humes lecture. Okay, sure

tripping people are funny, but there is never one around
when you need one, and there is always the risk that they’re
going tofreakouton you. _—

Then there are the people who don’t have any excuse for
their dullness. People whose quest for diversion is satis-
fied by Freddy and his talking lamp. These people plan
their days around coming up with a good argument for that
Milton discussion next week. They do all of their home-
’ work and, worst of all, they enjoy it. This scares me,

because I’m going to be competing with these people for

the rest of my life. Grim notion. Now I’m not belittling
intellectualism. Studying, reading and contemplating are

all great, but this isn’t the school of Socrates, it’s an
American college in the twentieth century. We have
more important things to do. For example, there are loads
of classics which I would love to be broadening my mind |
with right now, but I’m too busy purging this cynicism
from my system. -

Thank goodness for Piecemeal, Kevin Dunn, and Mike
Schill, and the basketball team. It’s time for lunch, so this
is as good a place as any to stop writing, I will, of course,
conclude with the obligatory Davidsonian disclaimer
which, by convention, must accompany anything -
touched with satire or light-hearted social criticism so the
pinheads don’t get in an uproar. Here goes: Pm joking,
I’m joking, I’m joking. Mostly.
