The two DC’s

While in Washington, D.C.
this past summerI came to acouple
of startling conclusions: my fellow
political science majors from
Davidson are obsessed with run-
ning into me on the Metro, and the
similarities between DC (Davidson
College) and DC (District of Co-
lumbia) are greater than I initially
between suspected. Who knew the
typical Davidson student had so
much in common with Newt
Ginrigh and company.

In early June, freshly recov-
ered from spring exams,
Davidson’ s entire political science
department (or so it seemed) con-
verged upon Washington in an
orgiastic frenzy. Why such a fer-
vent migration to Washington? We
poli sci majors have an instinctual
affinity for the District, and every
summer, as if years of politically
oriented classes‘aren’t enough, we
flock north for more.

In addition to our department’ s
Summer in Washington program,
a large number of us freelanced
our own internships. Every time I
turned around there was another
person with whom I’d had 86
classes. The novelty of attempting
to make short but meaningful small

talk at 8:30 a.m. on subway plat-
forms wore off instantaneously.
After about five accidental run-ins
I expected to see familiar faces all
around town. I even began hiding
from random strangers who re-
sembled any Davidson student.
By early July I wondered if I
was merely another intern tennis
ball the poli sci department ma-
chine had spit out to be wacked
around on the court of Washington
politics. With horror, and an even
more shameless metaphor, I began
to feel like one of many interning
drones who had come to buz (with-
out play) in homage to the queen

‘bee of policy-making cities. It

seemed my individual attempt to
enjoy a 3 month escape from
Davidson had all been in vain!

As Washington’s population
began to look a lot like Davidson’s
I noticed other parallels between
these two bastions of intelligéncia.
First of all, I realized that among
Davidson’ Washington contingent
I knew not only political science
wonks but a few art, history, and
English majors as well. What beck-
oned these folks to the Capital?
Some strange psychic connection
between the two DCs?

Foolishly, at first I had merely
contrasted the two places (Ithough
that the cities’ similarities were
limited to a lack of skyscrapers and
an affiliation with Woodrow Wil-
son). For instance, I noticed that
while “I have so much work” tops
the most commonly used phrase

list at Davidson, “policy blah blah.

blah blah policy blah” remains a
steady number one on the District.
As for local celebs, Davidson’s
leading personalities include Ri-
chard Terry, Polly Griffin, the in-
famous Judy Krenzer, (Big) Dave,
and of course, Bill Gullan.
Washington’s top five hotly de-
bated movers and shakers are much
more high profile: Newt, Hillary,
Marion Barry, Bill (Clinton, and
of course Bill (Gullan). To
Davidson’s credit, we may nothave
the big names, but our fine SGA
president is making waves in both
areas. Bill’s hefty leap into the
pool of politics has already created
an extra large splash—the country
is bracing for future cannonballing.

Such glaring differences in
scale aside, a more thorough ex-
amination of the two cultures re-
vealed that these twocities on ahill
are actually quite similar. As for

Have we forgotten
already?

A little over 50 years ago one
of the most important events in
human history came to a close.
While any war the size of WWII is
obviously a dark part of history,
many people saw a strong glimmer
of hope emerge from that dark-
ness. For one of the first times in
history different countries with
different backgrounds united to
fight against a threat to humanity
and its values. The US and the
other Allies fought in Europe
against a government which ruled
with and taught hate and fear of
one’s fellow man. As the war
progressed and was finally brought
to a close, the world learned that
the enemy which wehad been fight-
ing had engaged in horrible and
unspeakable offenses against hu-
manity. The Nazi death camps
which caused the deaths of mil-
lions of Jews, Gypsies, and politi-
cal dissidents were without a doubt
one of the greatest, if not the great-
est, crimes ever committed against
humanity.

This last summer I visited the
newly opened Holocaust Museum
in Washington D.C. It was an
incredibly powerful experience.
Even though there were hundreds
of people in the museum it was
dead quite, and if people spoke,
they spoke in whispers. Seeing the
pictures and films and reading the
histories and letters was one of the
most emotional experiences of my

life. It blows the mind to imagine
that humans were capable of doing
those things to each other. You
cannot help putting yourself in the
place of the victims of death camps
and'Nazi policies. It is impossible
to imagine how it would feel to be
awakened and arrested in yourown
home, to watch your wife stripped
naked by a young Nazi soldier,
forced to walk naked for miles
before being told to stop and dig a
ditch, to watch as a Nazi officer
walks behind the row of diggers
shooting each in the head before
pushing them into the ditch, and to
know that the last thing you will
see is your children and your wife
killed. Think about that. It is a
horrible thing humans did fifty
years ago. I felt shame, anger, and
incredible sorrow. The only posi-

tive part of the museum is its theme:

“Never Again.” That is the only
hope; that is the only good that
came out of what the Nazis did.
The world, and the US in particu-
lar, promised “never again.” Never
again would we let these abomina-
tions take place.

On the 50th anniversary of
that pledge, one would think that it
would receive special consider-
ation and reaffirmation. Yet 50
years after WWII the policies and
beliefs for which people cursed the
Nazis have reemerged. Ethnic
cleansing is at the center of the
conflict in the Bosnian war. Hate

of those who are different is why
people. are dying in Bosnia. Fifty
years after the world stood aghast
at what had happened in Germany,
what is the world doing about
Bosnia? Nothing. We are sitting
back and worrying about getting
involved. We remember Vietnam
and say, “it’s none of our busi-
ness.” Have we forgotten the words
on which this great country was
founded? “Liberty and Justice for
All,” “Life, Liberty, and the Pur-
suit of Happiness,” “All Men Are
Created Equal.” These phrases are
what our country is based upon.
This is its foundation.

What could be more of our

business than something that to-
tally contradicts these basic prin-
ciples? I cannot think of a better
cause for Americans to die for.
One thing that all of our great lead-
ers have maintained is that there
are some things more important
than life.

Waris horrible, butsome times
itis necessary to endure that evil so
that a greater good may ‘be ob-
tained. That is why so many men
signed up to fight and die fifty
years ago. For the sake of their
memories, for the sake of what
America has always stood for, and
for the sake of humanity, we can-
not afford to let these crimes con-
tinue. They must be stopped and
we must do what ever is necessary
to stop them..

political debate, in Davidson our

.international politics forum, the.

Dean Rusk Program, puts up a lot
of signs but what exactly does it
do? Similar all bark but little bite
occurs in Washington where pub-
lic figures argue, sound-byte, and
propose but never seem to accom-
plish even 2% of their agendas. On
a more fundamental level, both
Davidson ahd Washington’s ad-
ministrations are full of Republi-
cans and religious conservatives:
At the same time, in both locales,
the media is distinctly liberal. (Did
I mention high parking ticket
fines?)

The most uncanny resem-
blance, however, lies deep in the
psyche of both cities. Basically,
people in Washington and
Davidson are nerds with a vision.
Instead of leading the easy life (a
blow-off school or a nine to five
job) Davidson students and Dis-
trict residents love to strive for the
light at the end of the tunnel. At
Davidson, that elusive flicker of
hope usually translates as the apoc-
ryphal post-graduation career. In
the Capital city the dream is one of
a perfect America where every
government policy is fair and just.

For better or worse, this tendency
to aspire to some distant mirage
has led many Davidson students
and Washington residents to cre-
ate their own bubble world where
the future is first, and everything
else is last. :

Over time we both become
oblivious to the diversity of
lifestyles in the outside world;
Washington residents. acknowl-
edge that the beltway acts as botha
psychological and quarantined
youngster from that fabulous movie
The Boy in the Bubble, most of us
never contemplate the territory
beyond our artificial boundaries
except in the context of-class or
home. ;

’ _ Asmuchas many of us would
like to deny it, we’ re a lot more like
Newtand his pals than we thought.
Perhaps so many Davidson stu-
dents go to Washington because
we easily identify with such one-
track minded, ambitious over-
achievers. On the other hand,
maybe it’s just to pay lots of rent,
toil away in the heat and humidity
and get paid nothing just to beef up
anorexic resumes. Who knows?
Maybe some my Washington sum-
mer compatriots whiled away their

Very short article

I'll make this brief. Judging by the
space left in this section, I have no
other choice. Because of the in-
credibly apathy at this school I
don't have enough articles to fill
this section. Come on people!
What's wrong with you? You must
have an opinion on something, Get
off your butt, sit yourself down at
a computer, and write a damn ar-
ticle. It's easy, productive, and if
it's in English I will printit. If you
need further motivation here are a

few reasons why you should send
in an opinions article now:

1.) Chicks dig guys who write for
the Opinions section.

2.) Studs dig girls who write for
the Opinions section.

3.) If you write, then you won't
have to read this dumb little state-
ments.

4.) The Opinions Editor, Jefe, is a
powerful and popular guy. Get-
ting on his good side is a smart
move for any ambitious student.
