Concert
program
makes
history

By JENNIFER CARLSON

Staff Writer

This week, The Davidson
College Music Department will
make history. For the first time,
The Davidson College Sym-
phony Orchestra, DC Concert

Choir and DC Chamber Sing- *

ers will share the stage, giving
two admission-free perfor-
mances of one unprecedented
program.

On Thursday, April 17 at
8 p.m. in Davidson College
Presbyterian Church and again
on Saturday, April 19 at 8.p.m
in First Baptist Church, 301 S.
Davidson St., Charlotte, one
can enjoy Davidson College’s
first-ever choir and symphony
program, featuring works of
Mozart and Bach.

With approximately 85
students in the Concert Choir
and 65 in the Symphony Or-
chestra, this program will star
one-tenth of the Davidson stu-
dent population. In addition,
four professional singers from
Charlotte and Europe will share

their talents as soloists. Yet

_ there is more to this program
than sheer numbers. Accord-
ing to DCSO conductor Rich-
ard Prior, “this is music-mak-
ing on a scale and standard
keeping with Davidson’s pro-
file as a premier institution.”
Prior and DCCC conductor
Donna M. Di Grazia will share
the podium, leading perform-
ers through an impressive rep-
ertoire.

The Symphony Orches-
tra will open the program with
Mozart’s Overture from Mar-
riage of Figaro. DiGrazia will
then conduct Magnificat by
Bach, featuring the Chamber
Singers. Prior will return to
the podium for the final selec-
tion, Mozart’s Requiem, star-
ring the voices of the Concert
Choir.

The Thursday perfor-
mance is entitled the “James
G. Swisher Memorial Concert”
in honor of the late Davidson
pianist-in-residence and be-
loved musician. Keep in mind
that the concert is in Davidson
College Presbyterian Church,
so early-arrival is advised (re-
member how quickly seats fill
upatevents like Vespers). Prior
expresses warm thanks for the
consistently strong support of
DCSO. He affirms that the
upcoming concert is “what
Davidson and the surrounding
community should expect”
from the DC Music Depart-
ment. Please come and be a

part of history.

Whas lering the Was ics

Dream Team thrills Davidson students with
personal interaction and stellar performance

By STEVE DUNCAN

Music does live at Davidson.
No doubt, everyone has been to a
student recital or three, giving the
obligatory standing ovation and one,
maybe two curtain calls for little
Mike Pealson, that kid who sits so
quietly three rows back in Econom-
ics but does play his ophicleide
rather loudly.

But how many times do you
get to see the real thing? Who
among you has heard a stirring ren-
dition of Shostakovich’s Sth played
live by the Chicago Symphony? Or

Conceived by Joseph
Robinson, a 1962 Davidson Col-
lege alumnus and the principal obo-
ist for the New York Philharmonic,
this week-long residency will allow
Davidson students the chance to see
these celebrated performers in
nightly concerts as well as the op-
portunity for personal interaction in
master classes.

Hindemith recital b

lows audience away

Six sonatas featuring wind instruments and piano showcase student talent

By JENNIFER CARLSON
Staff Writer

On Monday April 7, 1997, in
Hodson Hall, six talented Davidson
students and accompanist Cynthia
Lawing performed music of Paul
Hindemith (1895-1963) to an in-
trigued audience.

The idea to produce an All-
Hindemith recital came from the
creative minds of seniors Steve
Duncan and Jay Hudson, who had
both been individually studying
Hindemith pieces. Hindemith, “one
of the most prolific and influential
composers of the twentieth century,”
held a special interest for the wind
instruments. Duncan and Hudson
therefore designed a program fea-
turing six sonatas for wind instru-
ments and piano. Their idea proved
to be undoubtedly successful. ©

The program opened with the

triumphant sounds of the trumpet
played by senior Tom
Vanderbloemen. In this perfor-
mance of the first movement, Mit
kraft, of the Sonata for Trumpet and
Piano (1939), Vanderbloemen ex-
hibited great control of crescendos
and sustained notes. His playing
was indeed loud, but it did not drown
out the excellent piano accompani-
ment of Lawing. Together, the duo
effectively captivated the audience.
Elena Franklin, ‘97, then qui-
eted the mood with her performance
of the second movement of the So-
nata for Bassoon and Piano (1938).
This was my first opportunity to
hear a bassoon solo, and I was quite
pleased. The instrument provides a
unique, soothing resonance, exem-
plified by Franklin’s skillful play-
ing of this tranquil sonata.
Next, Hudson exhibited great
rhythmic control in his performance

of the Sonata for Tuba and Piano
(1955) by maintaining a triple meter
against the duple meter of the pi-
ano. Particularly enjoyable in this
piece were the rich bass notes of
the tuba and the rhythmic conclud-
ing measures.

In the following selection,
Sonata for Horn and Piano (1939)
featuring junior Erika Rissing, there
was commendable interaction be-
tween the soloist and pianist.
Rissing successfully sustained
notes, leading directly into forte
sections without taking a breath.
Lawing meanwhile exhibited care-
ful retardandos , slowing down to
preserve the pleasing atmosphere.
Congratulations to both on a solid
performance.

Laura Sheaffer, ‘99 gave an
excellent performance of the So-
nata for Flute and Piano (1936), In
the first movement, Heiter bewegt,

Sheaffer carried a beautiful melody,
effortlessly reaching high notes. The
slower second movement was fol-
lowed by the fast, rhythmic mea-
sures of the final movement, Sehr
lenhaft - Marsch. Piano and flute
complemented each other well from
the beginning to the resounding,
lively finale.

To conclude the evening,
Duncan and Lawing performed all

‘four movements of the Sonata for

Trombone and Piano (1941). In the
first movement, Duncan played
various musical intervals, reaching
high and low notes with ease. He
continued such skill in the following
sections and executed crescendos
effectively. Lawing performed the
difficult accompaniment with mas-
tery, keeping rhythm and holding
notes to lead into subsequent move-
