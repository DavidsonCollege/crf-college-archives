HOLLYWOOD SINGER .
COMING WITH BROWN

Les Brown’s Band, which will appear in concert at David-
son on November 22, will bring with it several exciting per-
sonalities. Jo Ann Greer, the band’s featured vocalist; Butch

Stone, comedian; and Stumpy

Brown, vocal stylist and bass

trombonist, head the list of entertainers.

Jo Ann Greer the pretty, dark-
eyed, 24-year-old, songstress hails
from Hollywood. She has appeared
with several famous orchestras be-
fore coming with Les Brown. Some
of the better. known orchestras
were Freddie Slack, Sonnie Burke,
and Ray Anthony. ;

Les Brown has always been noted
for his great vocalists. To name a
few of his former vocalists who are
now stars in their own right —
Doris Day, Eileen Wilson, and Lucy
Polk.

Before Miss Greer joined the Les
Brown organization, Les liked her
singing well enough to have her
appear on several Bob Hope radio
shows. At the present time she is
one of the busiest vocalists in Hol-
lywood. Between Les Brown road
trips there is never a dull moment
for her. She has appeared on many
radio and TV shows. Her beautiful
voice is used constantly by the
movie studios when she sings for
the stars. Her most popular success
was doing the singing for Rita Hay-
worth in “Affair In Trinidad” for
Columbia, and again for Miss Hay-
worth in “Miss Sadie Thompson.”

Her latest Coral records with Les
Brown are “Sentimental Train,”
“Back In Your Own Back Yard,”
“The Man That Got Away,” and
“Sentimental Journey.”

“Finding ‘Butch’ Stone was one
of the greatest strokes of luck I’ve
had in the band business,” says

leader Les Brown. In his fourteen
years with the band, Henry “Butch”
Stone has won a string of titles in-
cluding comedian, vocalist, assistant
leader, music librarian, gloom
chaser. Butch has won friends the,
world over for his great entertain. '
ing feats as well as his smile.

His recorded renditions of “A

Good Man Is Hard To Find,” “Put i between the hours of 9:00 and 11:00

Something In The Pot,” “Triskaidek
Aphobia,” and many others have
made him one. of the leading
stylists of the past decade.

Vocal stylist and bass trombonist,
Stumpy Brown is the younger
brother of the Renown leader. A
student of New York Military
Academy, he still found time to
perfect his trombone artistry.

Another talent, that of acting,
‘came to light when Monogram en-
gaged him to play the title role in
“Kilroy was Here,” after which he
was featured by Metro-Goldwyn-
Mayer in “The Duchess of Idaho”
with Van Johnson and Esther Wil-
liams.

“The Band of Renown” will hold
their concert in Johnston Gymna-
sium on Tuesday night, November
22. Advance tickets are $2.00 and
tickets at the door will be $2.25.
Students may purchase tickets now
from the College Union or any In-
terfraternity Council
tive.

Davidson College's R.O.T.C. De-
partment has been designated to
carry out the fall Red Cross blood
drive, which will be held on De-
eember 5 and 6 This is the first:
of two blood drives, the second to
come in the Spring.

Donation forms have already
been distributed to the R.O,T.C.
Cadets. Donors are reminded that
the permission of parents is re
quired if the donor is under the
age of 21. Printed forms for this
‘request arc available through the
R.0.T.C. Department.

Much of the work of coordinat-
‘ing the drive will be done by the
fraternities, as in the past. Com-
petition between the fraternities is
expected to increase the turnout
for, the drive.

The Red Cross would like to
stress the fact that the country
need not be at war for blood to be
necded. Blood is needed in both
peace and war, although wartime

the organization, dealing with his
impressions, reactions. and experi-|
ences as a student in Paris and as
a tourist throughout the French
nation. Meyer supplemented his |
talk with color slides taken during;
the past year in that country.

The meeting then progressed to
the most pleasurable part of the
evening when the members a

appreciation of the language than
can be obtained in the classroom.

the syllables is a measure of in-
telligence. The syllables in them-
selves could not bring about ego-
involvement. but the fact that the
subject thinks his intelligence is
being tested does. In other in-
stances the subject is given ma-
terial which is, in
volved. An example of this would
be when a musician is asked to
learn a passage appraising the
value of music in modern culture.
A physicist, for example, would not
be as ego-involved in this situation
as the musician would.

In an experiment of the effect of
stress on learning, done by the
psychologist Alper, the subjects
were told that the ability to re-
arrange jumbled sentences was an
intelligence test used by the Army

itself, ego-in-|

to select officer candidates. All the
subjects were draft-age males, and
the experiment was performed dur-
ing the war. A. male accomplice
was placed in the room with the
subjects and he “managed” to solve
the problems quicker than the sub-
jects, at the same time remarking
about the ease of the problems. To
further add to the ego-involvemenf,
a sexy, attractive female was
placed in the room, on the pretense
of helping with the experiment.
Actually she added to the sub-
jects’ embarrassment by making
derogatory remarks when they
failed to keep up with the male ac-
complice. A control group was
asked to rearrange the sentences,
but the ego-involved situation was
not created, and they worked under
normal circumstances. Both groups
performed the test under normal
circumstances one time, but in a
second session the experimental
group was placed in the ego-in-
volved situation. Results showed
that there was no_ significant
change in the performance of the
control group on the two tests.
However, there was a marked dif-
ference in the performance of the
experimental group, with ability
to perform the task being greatly
altered on the second trial.

A similar experiment was per-
formed by experimental psychology
students at Davidson last year. In
this experiment the subjects were
presented with a simple learning
task, and then were placed in an
ego-involved situation. Another
group was merely asked to learn
the material under normal condi-

Davidson Bridge Club
Receives Charter

Through the efforts of the Col-
lege Union, a bridge club for the
Davidson community has been
chartered, as the Davidson Bridge
Club. The club has been sanctioned
to give master points and conduct
tournaments. Mr. J. A. Pastell has
been appointed Director, and the
organizational meeting will be in
the Ballroom of the Union at 7:15
p. m. Tuesday, November 15.

The first tournament to be held
will, be a two session individual
tournament. The first session will
be November 15 after the organiza-
tional meeting. the second will be
December 8. Master points will be
awarded, and a silver goblet, stand-
ard prize for any A. C. B. L. tourna-
ment. will go to the winner.

The tournament will be free to
members of the club. Membership
for the rest of the year is $.50 per
person. Any group representing
either a fraternity or a local bridge:
club with up to 10 members will
be admitted for $3.00. This cost
eovers the charter, the directors
salary, and the expense of operat-
ing the tournament and one other
regular duplicate bridge game.

On hand for the tournament will
be Dr. A. M. Dye, a Life Master
from Charlotte. He will play but
will not be eligible to win. It is
hoped that a number of fraternities
will take advantage of the three
dollar fee for up to ten members.

Anyone at all interested in
bridge should attend the meeting
and game on November 15. Any
questions will be answered, and an
executive committce consisting of
2 students, one faculty member,
one representative of local bridge
clubs, and one person from the
town of Davidson will be elected.
From these will come the officers.
So if you are at all interested come
to the meeting and see what this
is all about, or see Buddy Dye.
