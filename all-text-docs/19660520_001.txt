Of Acceptance Replies

“The percentage of accepted
applicants who have decided to
come to Davidson,"’ according to
Admissions Director H. Ed-
munds White, ‘‘is the lowest in
three or four years.”

As of May 17, 258 boys havc
acknowledged their acceptance,
some of these coming from thr
waiting list.

White noted, however, that
this decrease seems to be the
same in other schools compar-
able to Davidson. One reason is
the rising cost of private col-
leges; Davidson's tuition in-
creased $100 this year.

Another possible cause of the
decrease this year, White con-
tinued, is the new acceptance
system with only two acceptance
dates, the early decision one in
November and the regular one
on April 14.

Under the old system with
four acceptance dates the ad-
missions office often had to ac-
cept some boys without having
access to their completed fold-
ers. The present system has pre-
vented this, but White feels that
some boys not accepted until the
later date may have chosen

Who’s Nothing Taps

of Davidson—the Who's Noth ng

of the

This vear's tapping is a fitting
one. The co-presidents, Georgi
Brewer and Robert Lake, so
voted because no one waned
full responsibilit: , called a mee:

course, no one attended. Then,
they forgot to set a chapel date
for the tapping.

Present members are Charlie

The new members: include

other schools at which they were
already accepted. :
The most important factor

erted in a wider geographical
area.

The list of applicants from
outside Davidson's geographical
region is larger than any pre-
vious year. White explained
that as Davidson's national rep-
utation increases, so do outside
applications.

White commented that 100 of
the 400 acceptances mailed April
14 were for applicants outside
the Southeastern states.

In the Midwest, boys from
Colorado, Nebraska, Missouri,
Kansas, Oklahoma and six from
Texas have acknowledged their
acceptances.

Nine boys will be coming next
year from Ohio, Illinois and In-
diana. So far there are 18 from
New York, New Jersey and
Pennsylvania and seven from

Possible |
Next Year

Davidson may get a taste of
big name entertainment next
year if students are willing to
pay. an admission fee at Social
Council functions.

Social! Council Chairman Vince
Foster and past Council Cha‘r-
man Dan Campbell both agreed
that an admission fee of one dol-
lar a head would enable the
Social Council to hire big name
talents such as The Supreinvs.

Foster pointed out that the So-
cial Council receives about
$20,000 to finance its activities.
The remainder of the $30,000 so-
cial fund is presented to the
Union. Thus the Social Council
can pay about $3,500 from its}
own pocket for each of the six
big weekends on campus.

If students pay the one dol-
lar per person admission fee, the |
Council would be able to obtain}
entertainment desired by
student body as shown by
recent popularity poll.

Foster was very pleased
the performance of the Social,
Council and its activities this se-!
mester, as was Campbell, Fos
ter was especially happy with
The Bitter End Singers; he said
that “even though the group
didn't have a big name, the
Council knew they were good."’

Foster foresees an improve-}
ment in Social Council entertain-|
ment next year because of the

popularity poll. Such an im.
provement, said Foster, is “the

Hampshire.

goal of the Social Council.”

York, S. C.° As last year's
the camp. will provide facilities
to house all incoming fresh
man.

In discussing the YMCA spon
sored camp, Don Carroll, in
charge of next year's camp,
says ‘We are not using a cen-
tral theme because we wish to
hit some major areas of campus
life not so closely: related. In-
terest areas will be three fold—
ethical and religious, practical
and personal."

The main speaker will be
Harry Smith, campus pastor of
the Chapel Hill Presbyterian
Church, who will discuss the
moral and religious questions
that the freshman faces on the
college campus. His talk will
highlight the philosophical seg-
ment of the program.

The second area of interest
will deal with the practical side
of college life. Such topics as

how to study will be discussed
During this phase the incoming
freshman will have the oppor

tunity ‘“‘to talk with different
professors.”
The personal aspect of ac

tivities will provide time for the
boys to get to know different

members of their class in a con-!

genial atmosphere of recreation
and fellowship.

In addition there will be a
program on the challenge Dav-
idson faces.

Bobby Lane will serve as pro-
gram. chairman for this year's
camp. The counselors will rep-
resent every phase of activity
on the campus, They include
the presidents of the student
‘body, the YMCA, and the Col-
lege Union. Additional consel-
ors will be the chairman and
vice-chairman of the Honor
Court, the vice-president of the

Questionnaire Praises
Humanities Program

One hundred and fifty juniors
and seniors were given the
chance to evaluate Davidson's
two year Humanities Program
| three weeks ago. This week Dr.
| Daniel, D. Rhodes, chairman of
| the first year program, released
| the objective results and a few
tentative interpretations

; Only. 50 of the students re
iturned the six page question
|naire. “‘Neédless to say, the
Humanities faculty was, some

been much more helpful with a
higher percentage.’’ Every stu
dent at Davidsan who has com.
pleted the two-year program
was mailed a copy of the ques
tionaire,

WOULD REPEAT

A full 70 per cent of the stu-
dents indicated that if they had
it to do over, they would take
Humanities again. Ninety per
cent also said that they had rec-
ommended the program to other
students.

Forty of the 50 considered the
“carry-over value of this pro-
gram for other courses” to be
good or excellent, and forty-two
said the course quickened their
intellectual curiosity.

what disappointed,”. comment
ed Rhodes.
“The evaluation would -have

vided over whether the ‘first
year average daily assignment
was reasonable or excessive, but
an overwhelming majority con
sidered the second year average
assignment to be reasonable.

For both the first and second
year programs, a large majority
thought the amount of required
writing was reasonable. About
70. per cent considered the bal
ance between lectures and dis
cussions for both years satisfac-
tory.

Sixty-five per cent voted in
favor of changing professors for
discussion groups only at the end
of.the semester. Professors in
the first year program, with one
exception, are presently changed
at mid-semester also, sixty per
cent favored regrouping students
in discussion groups during the
year. Presently this is not done
in the fréshman program.

Several students indicated
their desire to add some study
of music to the course.

MOST VALUABLE

Concerning the element which
they considered most valuable,
the students ranked ‘‘quality and
breadth of reading material"
first and ‘‘acquaintance with a
variety of professors’ last.

The students indicated that fol-
lowing the second year program,
they generally did have a sense

(Staff Photo By Olson)

of the meaning and unity of
Western civilization, and an ap

preciation for this. cultural her

itage. Several students men
tioned a more favorable reaction
to the study of more recent

events and books, especially be
cause of their first-year back
ground.

Rhodes observed, ‘‘Some stu
dents wanted more instruction
on how to write; some wanted
more creative writing; and some
wanted book reports. Overall,
the students seemed to feel tha:
they had gained a sense of the
integration of knowledge, going
beyond disciplinary barriers.

“Students felt that on the whole
they had become better ac
quainted with good reading and
broad reading, and that they
had read some things which
they would not have read other
wise.”

ANSWERS HELPED

Rhodes emphasized strongly,
“We of the Humanities staff
wish to express our genuine ap-
preciation to those students who
took the time and trouble to fill
out the qustionnaires and turn
them in.

“We especially appreciate how
thoughtful, honest, and construc-
tive the comments were. In the
long run we feel that the per-
sonal comments of these stu-
dents may possibly prove more
valuable than the objective an-
swers.”

Most of the professors in the
Humanities Program have not
yet had an opportunity to read
the questionnaires, accordingly,
Dr. Rhodes emphasized that he
could only speak for himself
and that his interpretations were
tentative.
