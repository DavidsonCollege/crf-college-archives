nually by the college Student Chris-
tian Association, which rotates the
speaking assignment among minist-
ers of denominations represented

Regulations outlining conditions
under which veterans, disabled af.
ter fighting started in Korea, may
be entitled to Public Law 16 re.
habilitation training, have been is-
sued by the North Carolina Veter.
ans Administration Regional Of-
fice.

Training Extended

The training, previously limited
to World War II veterans, was ex-
tended to many veterans disabled
on or after June 27, 1950, by Pub-
lic Law 894, signed by the Presi.
dent late last year.

Most. of the policies and pro-
cedures set up under Public Law
16 have been carried over to the
new training program, the VA said.
In fact, the newcomers apply for
training on the same forms used
by disabled World War I1 veterans.

Under Public Law 894, a veteran
must have been disabled after the
Korean conflict began and prior
to a date yet to be fixed.

The new law requires that the
disability be such that the VA may
pay compensation at full wartime
rates. Such rates are paid for dis-
abilities .or injuries resulting from
armed conflict, or during extra-
hazardous service, or while the
United States is engaged in war.

Nine Years

Under the new law, the July 25,
1986 deadline for Public Law 16
training will not apply to the newly-
disabled veterans. Instead, they
will have nine years from the end
of the current emergency in which
to train.

Public Law 894 states that vet-
erans who already had GI Bill or
Public Law 16 training, as a result
of their World War II service, may
be erititled to additional training,
if found necessary because of new
disabilities.

In determining whether such a
World War II veteran needs train-
ing, and what type he should get,
the VA will consider his previous
records of advisement and training
as well as his current medical rec-
ord. The reason, the VA said, is
that previous training may be capi-
talized to the fullest extent prac-
ticable.

In the case of a veteran who in-

terrupted Public Law 16 training

to re-enter the armed forces, the
VA also will evaluate his past
training record and present medical
file, to determine whether he still
is able to go ahead in the same em-
ployment objective.

singer, has improved with age. Mr.
Niles who was originally from Ken-
tucky used an instrument which is
called the dulcimer of which he
had three that he made himself,
each in a different tone.

Mr. Niles used his subtle wit to/

its utmost advantage in telling of
the history and origin of the ‘bal-
lads. From the morals of several
ballads he offered advice and many
helpful hints about the different
situations of life. It is interesting
to note that he has a collection of
65 ballads of local origin, and this
collection is the largest of its kind
in the Western Hemisphere. Mr.
Niles presented a program that was
not only very interesting but also
very entertaining.

PHI SOCIETY
HEARS NEW MEMBERS

An ancient body received new
blood last Monday evening when
the Philanthropic Literary Society
welcomed six new members whose
entrance papers proved them to be
excellent additions. Don Mahy
read his “Seven Stevedores,”’ a tear-
jerking episode of departures from
the Philippines. Bob Crutchfield’s
poem, “Reflections Upon Great-
ness” was pure quasisocratic bril-
liance. Hunter Strader’s “Single
Shot” was a tale of war. “Down
Under” by Howard Proctor might
have been termed quaint, realistic,
and inclining foward the gutttural.

Virginia, and South Carolina), and
the High Council, the group was
chartered an ATO club on May
1Sth. Then word received last week
that the Club’s petition had been
“Overwhelmingly approved” by the.
undergraduate chapters of the fra-
ternity touched off preparation for
the Formal Installation which is
now in progress.

The question as to the desirability
of such a move arroused consider-
able discussion ,but the members
finally voted to join with the na.
tional under certain specified con?
ditions.

The program continued as Bill
Trotman presented an original one-
act play entitled Phi Bete. The play
tells the tragic story of a young
college student who, under pres-
sure from his parents to make
“Phi Bete,’ but unable to make the
necessary grades through honest.
work, finally resorts to cheating.
As the play nears a climax, the
boy is caught cheating on a final
examination. Unable to face his
parents in disgrace, he takes his
own life in utter despair.

The program concluded with two
other readings—a paper by Neal
Leach entitled “Georgia Incident,”
which was read by Hartley Hall,
and finally a short story by Bob
Barron.

could be made to the constitu-

According to Article XIV
of the Constitution, regarding
to amendments and revisions,
amendments must first be
passed upon by the Student
Council. It shall then, after
being presented to the student
body, lie oft the table for ten
days. A vote of the student
body may then be taken, and
a two-thirds majority of those
present and entitled to vote
is necessary for the proposed
amendment to be adopted. It
then immediately becomes a

Campus Interviews on Cigarette Tests
Number 13...THE OCELOT

Ou feline friend may not be from Missouri, but she sure
likes to be shown! She saw right through those thin, quick-trick, cigarette
tests and realized you couldn’t fairly judge a cigarette’s mildness with a
mere one puff or a swift sniff. Right on the spot, she decided they weren't
fur her! Sophisticated, but shrewd, she knew what she wanted.
The Sensible Test . . . the 30-Day Camel Mildness Test,
which simply asks you to try Camels as your steady
smoke—on a pack after pack, day after day basis.
No snap judgments needed. After you’ve enjoyed Camele—
and only Camels—for 30 days in your “T-Zone”
‘(T for Throat, T for Taste), we believe you'll know why...

More People Smoke Camels
than any other cigarette!

‘“*T don’t mean
to be catty—
but I hate

pussyfooting!’’
