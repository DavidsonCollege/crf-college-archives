Forty-eight Davidson stu-
dents will be Spending their
junior year in four European
countries, India, and Africa.
The universities of Marburg,
Germany, and Montpelier,
France, will, as in the past,
take the largest numbers—12
and 24, respectively. There
will be five in Spain, five in
Britain, one in Africa, and
one in India.

“Being immersed in a for:
eign culture is one of the
most enriching experiences
a college student can have,”
commented Vice President
for ‘Academic Affairs John
M. Bevan. ‘More than any
thing else, study of this na
ture contributes to individual
development -and world un-
derstanding.”’

steadily grown since its. in-

spring term and a summer
term at Oxford University in
conjunction with Mary Bald-
win.

Explaining that “it’s the
kind of subject that doesn’t
allow for neat answers,” Col-
lege President Samuel R.
Spencer Jr. talked Monday
night about coeducation for
Davidson.

The Open End, which drew
about 30 students and facul-
ty, failed to reveal any defi
nite date on which female
students can be expected on
the Davidson campus ¢h
masse.

Spencer said he did not
want to give a specific date
because he didn’t want to
“cop out” on any” promises
or assurances. He. did say,
however, that he was in
favor of coeducation.

The president said that
most members of the heavi-
iy-male Davidson communi-
ty had looked at the matter
mostly from a ‘Smale chau-
Vinist’’ standpoint. He said
the college must now consid-
er whether coeducation would
be beneficial for the women
attending as well as just for
the present male communi
ty.

The biggest obstacle block-
ing the college from aban-
doning its traditional all-
male enrollment is financial
problems associated with the
move, according to Spencer.

Davidson College is almost
unique among small col-
leges in that it is not in
debt at this time, and un-
less monetary support can
be guaranteed from ‘alumni
and friends, the college can-
not embark on a costly pro-
gram such as coeducation.

When questioned as to the
position of coeducation on
the list of priorities, Spencer
placed the library- at the
top but said that coeduca-
tion was among the top prior-
ities. He said further that
it would drop in position if,

Spencer said he anticipat

order to build a fund for co-
education in the future.

He further said that. the
placement of the new library
has no relationship to pre-
sent plans for future’ expan

tees if May that the college
give diplomas to some fe-
males, such as faculty wives
and married students.

The second avenue is to
‘ake upper division (junior
and senior) girls only at
first. In this way the college
would be able to choose stu-
dents who will major in
areas where the college has
a better staff situation than
others,

The third avenue is to ac-
cept women as regular stu
dents. This is the most cost-
ly plan andthe one most
students think of when they
hear of ‘‘coeducation.”’

Fourthly, the college could
establish a coordinate pro-
gram with a_= girls school,
probably Queens. Under this
System some courses. and
majors would be offered only
at one or the other of the
campuses, with many courses
and degrees duplicated. Each
school would then be able to
best use its particular re-
sources,

RHC To Fine Students

By RICH WILSON
Managing Editor
Anyone found possessing or
using fireworks on campus
will be fined between 10 dol-
lars and 25 dollars, accord-
ing to Bill Alexander, Presi-
dent of the Residence Hall

Council. (RHC).

Alexander said the RHC has
empowered the house com-
mittees, composed of dorm
representatives of the RHC,
to levy fines against those
who admit to possession or
use of firecrackers,

Any cases involving judg-
ment will be sent to the reg-
ulations court for a decision.

“So many people are real-
ly upset over the use of fire-
crackers on campus,” said
Alexander. ‘‘Not only are

Of Fireworks

fireworks a nuisance, but
they also are a fire hazard
and can cause personal in
jury.”’

Alexander noted that one
student has already been fin
ed 25 dollars for throwing a
firecracker at a janitor.
“Luckily he wasn’t hurt,”
said Alexander. ‘‘But the fact

remains that the janitor
could have been seriously in-
jured.”’

Dean of Students Will H.
Terry said he was satisfied
that the firecracker problem
is on its way to a solution
by the action of the RHC.

“This is another illustra-
tion that when students get
involved and concerned about
an. issue they will handle it
by themselves.’’
