Service Corps
Fund Drive :
short & sweet

By JEAN SORACCO
Features Editor

Bewildered by the problem of
what to do with any extra cash
you have on hand? Well, the Y

The Y is starting the year
with its annual fund drive to
raise the money needed for its
various activities.

“The change challenge held
last spring lacked good re-
sponse,”’ said treasurer Eliza-
beth Medlin, ‘‘and is the reason
for the upcoming drive Monday
through Wednesday, Septemb-
er 17-19. It will be short but
very intense.”

In the past the average
faculty donation:has been $5.00
a petson, while the students
averaged only thirty cents a
person. “Because it is a student
organization, it would be nice to
see student takeover during the
drive,”’ said Medlin.

The fund drive will involve a _

door-to-door campaign. Medlin
feels that the personal contact is
extremely important. ‘“‘The
campaigners will be able to
answer questions about the Y
and ask for student support in
time as well as money.’’

Student involvement with the
Davidson campus and commun-
ity is the purpose of the Y.

Some of the opportunities
offered by the Y include tutor-
ing, working with the elderly,
recycling, and visiting prison
inmates.

“If anyone wants to partici-_

pate in something,” said Med-
lin,“‘just let any of us know.”

Imagine yourself ten years
hence, degreed from Davidson,
probably married and hopefully
working. And if current trends
continue, your spouse will prob-
ably work too. The two pay-
check family is becoming more
common every year.

Today there are more women
working outside the home than
inside. ‘‘Women are joining the
labor force, not to express
themselves or get rid of their
husbands, but for the same
reasons men work~ for money!”

Caroline Bird, an authority
on the economics of working
women, takes a hard look at the
impact of dual career couples in
her latest book The Two
Paycheck. Marriage.

Featured on NBC’s Today
Show, the book “attests to. new
ways of thinking about sex and
power, household and financial

management, family planning
and child care.”’

According to Ms. Bird the
second paycheck not only frees
women from full time careers as
housewives, but liberates men
from the burden of supporting a
family.

Traditionally obedient family
men must no longer follow their
employer's dictates out of eco-
nomic necessity.

Marriage will according to
Bird become less an economic
arrangement and more a per-
sonal arrangement. As the
years pass, ‘“‘there will be fewer
and better marriages, fewer and
more cherished children and a
choice of ways for individuals to
get support, financial and emo-
tional, that was formerly pro-
vided by the _ traditional
family.”’ -
Not that the future is entirely
rosy for the working couple.

Bird acknowledges that di-
vorce will increase, ‘‘since a
woman with income of her own

Bird to talk on money:and marriage

is less likely to stay in an
unsatisfactory marriage, and, if
the marriage is satisfactory,
that income, which often allows
families to outpace inflation,
threatens traditional relation-
ships.”

Older couples pretend
nothing has happened, using
her paycheck for ‘‘special pur-
poses" or pooling incomes. Con-
temporary couples bargain and
split expenses. But, ‘‘no matter
how you cut it, the second
paycheck presents difficulties to
most couples.’’

Ms. Bird, also author of the
controversial Case Against
College, will be on campus
September 20, sponsored by the
Union Speakers Committee.

There wil be a luncheon in the
Morrison Room at 1:00 p.m.,
conversation in the pit at 4:00,
and a lecture, involving inter-
views with two community
career couples in Love at 8:00,
followed by coffee in the Mor-
rison Room.
