OH YOU UNIFORM
I miss my three-tint neckties,
I miss my silken hose,
I’ve really got to miss a lot
When I wear army clothes.

A sergeant is a guy who is given chev-
rons ‘to show that he is supposed to help
the captain hold his job.

ASK ANY OF THE DOUGHBOYS

They will tell you that the first thing

‘they learned about the war was that the

girl who could dance like a blue: streak
could not knit socks.

The boys who go to camp will tell vou
that an army cook is known by the mess
he makes.

“Cohan Right!” bawled the quartermaster
as he checked up ona row of fiaures.

being doughless.

Bell—“I guess I stand in pretty well
with the officer of the day.”

Webb—“Howzat?”

Bell—“He came by my post last night
and said, “Oh, what a relief!”

Cap'n Deck—"“Here,

Captain, who has just parted two fel-
