A good way to get the most out
of anything is to pause now and
then and refresh yourself... with
ice-cold Coca-Cola. Its taste is
delicious. Its after-sense of re-
freshment is delightful. A short
pause for ice-cold Coca-Cola is
the refreshing thing to do. So
when you pause throughout the
day, make it the pause that re-
freshes with ice-cold Coca-Cola.
