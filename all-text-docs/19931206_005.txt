Save the world and buy a gift at the Alternative Gift Market

By Letitia Campbell

Ahbh ... Christmas. A boun-
tiful time of food, family, brightly
decorated trees with presents piled
around them, warm cider, cookies,
and water buffalos.

“Water Buffalos???” You ask.

Yes, this year, you can cel-
ebrate Christmas by purchasing a
water buffalo to be sent to East
India by Outreach, an international
human development agency. The
water buffalo will provide milk,
butter, and cheese for a village and
for market. The profit from the sale
of the dairy products would fund
bicycles for people needing trans-
portation.

And if water buffalo aren’t
your thing, then maybe an acre or

two of.rainforest, a wheelbarrow,
or an eye operation would interest
you.

The Chaplain’s Office, the
Chapel Committee, and a variety
of other student organizations, in-
cluding Patterson Court Houses
and religious groups, are sponsor-
ing an Alternative Gift Market with
the theme “Give the Worlda Christ-
mas Present.” The Market will be
open between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. on
Sunday, December 12 in the TV
Lounge of the Student Union (dur-
ing the Community Christmas
Party).

The market will allow students
to Christmas shop (since exams
don’t end until the 23rd) and it

gives all the members of the com-

munity achance tocelebrate Christ-
mas in a unique way.

What can you buy? Chickens
and water buffalo, antibiotics and
eye surgery, water wells and acres
of rain forest, foodstuffs for hun-
gry people and shelter for the home-
lessin the United States. Started in
1980 in Pasadena, California, Al-
ternative Gift Markets now extend
across the United States. Hun-
dreds of Churches, organizations,
and schools will hold markets this
year.

Harriet C. Prichard, founder
and president of Alternative Gift
Markets, Inc., believes that the
markets “offer shoppers the op-
portunity to preserve our endan-
gered planet as well as help hun-

gry, sick and homeless people--
the world around--help themselves.
Instead of shopping for presents
friends and family here may not
really need or even want, we can
give gifts of hope and new life toa
needy world.”

When individuals purchase
gifts, they receive Christmas cards
naming their gifts, ready to mail or
deliver as holiday gifts,

Donors, card recipients, and
hungry-homeless people all receive
joy at Christmas, a turn-around
from the usual materialistic holi-
day celebration.

Simple gifts, like clean water
and antibiotics, mean survival for
many people. Gifts like a bus ride
for a Sioux s’adent or a shovel for

Family troubles may haunt the holidays

By Mandy Curtis

Christmas trees, gifts, lights,
cookies and carols, peace and joy,
friends and family--these are the
images that come to mind when
one thinks about going home for
the holidays. However, for many
students, a happy homecoming is
just an image, far from the reality
of dealing with the family.

According to Dr. DeWitt
Crosby of the counseling service,
many students go home to face
family members with alcoholism,
mental illness or serious depres-
sion, parents with marital difficul-
ties, conflicts with siblings or fami-
lies under economic strain. Others
have to deal with subtle problems
such as parents who are overly
intrusive or demanding.

Often Davidson students feel
responsible for solving the prob-
lems at home. Crosby states that
students put too much pressure on
themselves thinking they need to
change a situation or work to keep
things the way they were. “Stu-
dents feel like they can change
things and it’s frustrating when
they can’t,” she says.

It is inevitable with the nature
of the holiday season that people
get stressed out, particularly with

family. Everyone has a picture of
what Christmas should be, the
Norman Rockwell version; how-
ever, it is the rare occasion when
the ideal is the reality. According
to Crosby, this is what “raises the
disappointment level.”

"Everyone has a
picture of what
Christmas should be,
the Norman Rockwell
version; however
it is a rare occasion
when the ideal is
the reality"

Families are always trying to
do too much during the Christmas
break, says Crosby. This can also
be a source of stress for those stu-
dents who just want to go home
and relax after a semester of work.

Besides the fact thatit is Christ-
mas, students are home for a whole
month when they’ve been away
for so long. This transition is very
difficult for students as well as for
parents who are not used to living
in the same house again. Crosby

argues that a month is too long for
students to be home, and suggests
everyone make alternative plans
for at least a portion of the break.

There are different ways col-
lege students deal with the prob-
lems in the home. Two likely
approaches are what Crosby calls
the “ostrich” approach and the ac-
tive approach.

Those who act like nothing is ©

going on are taking the “ostrich”
approach; basically they deny and
ignore. Students who get involved
in the situation and try to make
changes are playing an active role

' but are often discouraged when

things do not work out.

In addition to making other
plans, students need to communi-
cate with their parents and other
family members. They don’t need
to try to change things but talking
about what is going on is the
healthiest approach.

Crosby added that “keeping
expectations at a reasonable level
is important.”

"It’s alsoa good idea to talk to
a third party about problems at

- home before leaving for the break,

says Crosby. A friend, professor
or counselor can give “clarity or
validation.”

a link between students and re-
cruiters from corporations,
non-profit enterprises, graduate
schools, and recruitment agencies.

for more information.

With the increase in impor-
tance and complexity of both non-
profit careers and management
skills, a one to five year program in
non-profit management is now
being offered on area campuses.
Students may elect to take the fifty
haur, eight course program in one
year, or spread the courses out over
five years.

The brochure states that the
student “will develop a personal-
ized program of study drawn from
a curriculum of approximately
fifty-five classes.”

Courses are offered at Duke
University and in the cities of
Greensboro, High Point, and Win-
ston-Salem; students may take
classes at either or both locations.
Acomplete catalog is available for

College, high
school celebrate union
MIDDLEBURY, Vt. (CPS)-

and DeWitt Clinton High School
of New York City celebrated a
six-year partnershipin November
that has been based on an ex-
change of students and faculty to
fulfill needs at both institutions.

On November 15, a dozen
Middlebury faculty, staff and stu-
dents went to New York to spend
a day teaching, lecturing and con-
ducting workshops as they dis-
cussed other opportunities for ex-
changes between the two institu-
tions.

In the past, students from the
Bronx high school have had the
opportunity to visit Middlebury
College and attend classes when
they are considering attending col-
lege.

Some DeWitt Clinton stu-
dents have been included in such
prestigious programs as the Bread
Loaf New England Young Writ-
ers’ Conference.

Students in mining competition

ROLLA, Mo. (CPS)- Six
mining engineering students at the
University of Missouri competed
in a mine rescue competition in
October, campus officials said re-
cently.

Amine rescue was simulated
in the university’s experimental
mine, in which five workers had
to be rescued from a poorly venti-
lated mine.

Ron Robison, supervisor of
the experimental mine on cam-
pus, said the competition was
tough. The students competed
with six other professional teams,
some teams consisting of former
students of the university’s min-
ing engineering program. He said
this was one of the main reasons
for the last place finish.

“You just don’t beat those
professional teams,” Robison said,
adding that students will begin
training in December for a spring
competition.

Increase in hiring projected
BETHLEHEM, Pa. (CPS)-
Although companies are doing
less recruiting on college cam-
puses this academic year, many

Middlebury College of Vermont

employers are anticipating a bet-
ter year than last year, the College
Placement Council said.
According to the council’s
Job Outlook 794 report, 57 per-
cent of the 245 employers re-
sponding in a survey plan to hire
more college graduates for the
1993-94 recruiting season than
they did last year. The project
hiring 5.9 percent more graduates
in 1993-94 than they actually hired
‘in 1992-93.
Many firms, however, do not
plan on active recruiting on cam-
pus, according to the survey. Re-
sponding employers plan to visit
7.4 percent fewer campuses in the
1993-94 recruiting season than
they did last year. Last year was
described in the survey as a
“buyer’s market” for employers,
and that low inflation, coupled
with a tight job market, kept in-
creases in starting salaries low.
Only 37 percent of non-profit
organizations and government

offices plan to increase hiring,

while 57 percent of service em-
ployees plan to hire.

MBAs help women
break glass ceiling

DAYTON, Oh. (CPS)-
Women who want to break
through the glass ceiling into top
management jobs might consider
earning a master’s in business ad-
ministration.

Researchers at the Univer-
sity of Dayton and Pepperdine
University in Malibu, California
studied women in management
positions at Fortune 500 compa-
nies and found that women who
hold MBA degrees are entering
corporate top management jobs
quickerand in largernumbersthan
similarly prepared men.

According to Rebecca Yates,
associate. dean of the University
of Dayton’s School of Business
Administration and co-author of
the study, the findings debunk
recentstudies that indicate women
are blocked in their career paths
by “an invisible glass ceiling.”

The researchers’ study found
that 25 years after receiving
MBAs, women held nearly three
times as many top management
positions as their male counter-
parts.
