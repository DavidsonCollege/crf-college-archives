| ~~ Freshmen select

Women’s houses achieve parity; |
fraternities find selves with smaller pledge classes

By SUSAN PEARSALL

“Ecstatic and tHrilled” is how Patterson
Court Council president Ginger Broaddus
described herself following last Thursday’s
Patterson Court self selection process. Perhaps
the most pleased with thé results of self selec-
tion were the women’s eating houses, Warner
Hall, Rusk, and Spencer, each receiving thirty-
nine new members. The parity is welcome
after last year’s lopsided results caused Rusk’s
and Spencer’s waiting lists to swell tremen-
dously.

The only complaints about self selection ’88
which might possibly arise would come from
the fraternities which, with the exception of

newly-resurrected Kappa Sigma, have smaller
than average pledge classes.

At least partially to blame for the seeming
scarcity of freshmen males on the Court this
year is the new grade regulation approved by
the Patterson Court Council; any freshman
wanting to join any Patterson Court House must
have a minimum 2.0 GPA before he will be
admitted to the membership. As a result, forty
freshmen are currently ineligible to join a
house.

According to Dean of Students Will Terry,

New phone system here July 4

Phone service will no longer be optional;
system will offer 4-digit intra-campus dialing

Davidson College has signed a contract with
Southern Bell for an ESSX (sm) telephone
system that will be installed over the July 4
holiday. The new system will provide phone
service for faculty and staff offices as well as
for students living in college dormitories.

Under the new system, all dorm rooms will
be permanently wired for ESSX (sm). Students
will be billed for telephone service by the
college rather than Southern Bell.

According to Bob Stephenson, Director of
Personnel and Administrative Services,
charges for basic service will be included in the

The faculty of Davidson Col-
lege passed a resolution Tuesday
calling for the Board of Trustees
to divest college holdings in
companies doing business in
South Africa.

In this most recent resolution,
the faculty encourage “complete
divestment.” In addition, the reso-
lution calls for the Trustees to:

+ “Encourage corporations cur-
rently in Sullivan Category II
(making progress’) to take such
actions necessary to be rated in
Category I (making good prog-
ress’) or be subject to divest-
ment;”

° Inform the Faculty of “prog-
ress which has been made in the

implementation of its policy.”

¢ Encourage the college ad-
ministration to provide “scholar-
ship aid for black South African
students” and. to support “other
educational initiatives in South
Africa.”

One source stated that the reso-
lution passed by a vote of 57 to 15,
but official verification is not
possible at this time.

Lou Ortmayer, one of the au-
thors of the resolution, stated that
the vote was much stronger than
last year. Last year’s resolution,
passed on September 16, 1986,
called for immediate divestment.
The new resolution, Ortmayer
stresses, sets up no timetable.

Critics of divestment have

charged that by cutting ties with
corporations that do business in
South Africa, Davidson loses its
leverage in influencing their ac-
tions. They encourage active par-
ticipation as stockholders in these
companies instead of divestment.

When asked to speculate on
Trustee reaction, Ortmayer was
skeptical about the possibility of
divestment. Ortmayer said that he
would prefer that the college not
divest. He said that he would
rather encourage corporations in
South Africa to act for change, of
going to the extent of staging civil
disobedience.

college each month. Students will have private
long distance authorization codes to prevent
use of their phone for this purpose by others.

Stephenson also explained that state regula-
tions prevent the college fron: giving students
optional phone service.
