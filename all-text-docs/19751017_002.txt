“This program is a great
opportunity to learn lang-

available at Davidson. It
certaintly opens up Dav-

commented Dr. Jacobus.

Funded by a federal
grant in the early sixties

the idea was to create a,

relatively inexpensive pro-
gram, so students could
study those little taught
languages without great
expense to the college.
Recently the National
Association of Self-Instruc-
tional language Programs
was organized for the
inter-
change of ideas. Davidson
was one of about 50 original
members. It is hoped that
number will grow to about

Cassette system replaces
‘antiquated machine reels

By BRAD SWALWELL
Staff Writer

The Davidson College Lang-
uage Lab was transformed
this past summer from an
antiquated reel-to-reel tape
system to a modern cassette
tape system, according to
Language Lab Director Pat
Snouse. e"

‘“The new system is much
easier to use, both for the
students listening in. the lab

' and for the staff running the

lab,’’ said Snouse.

Senior David Wiley, who
worked in the Language Lab
this past summer, commented
on the change-over from the

500 schools.

Working mainly with
cassette tapes, along witha -
text, the student concen-
trates on the spoken lan-
guage with reading skills

_ also developed. .

In addition to working
daily with the tapes, three
. times a week the student
works with a tutor Whose
native tongue is the lan-
guage the student is
studying.
These tutors are not
trained language instruc-
tors, and they are paided
by the college. Davidson is
fortunate to have many
foreign students studying
here to aid in the program.
_ Students are evaluated |
at a campus where the
language is taught by a
fulltime instructor. There

new casette system.

“T took the old reel-to-reel
master tapes and from them
made cassette masters. The
machine does this in one-
fourth the time of the reel-to-
reel master. So a thirty minute
reel-to-reel master can be dup-
licated onto a casette in about
seven minutes.

‘‘Then I took the cassette
master and made two dupli-
cate cassettes in one-sixteenth

the time of the original

Snouse added that the job is
far from completed.

“There are still many tapes
to be made. We're getting up
first the tapes that professors
need now,” she said.

given a grade on his
performance.

Back at Davidson.
Dr. Jacobus reviews the
grade and usually assigns it
to the student as a normal
grade.

After three to four terms
of study at Davidson, the
student usually needs more
contact and feed-back with
native speakers of the
language.

_ Then the student is”
encouraged to take part in
summer institutes or, if
possible, study abroad.

Motivation comes en-
tirely from the students
themselves, so applicants
are well screened to see if
they have this ‘motivation
as well as a native capacity
for languages. If a student

Snouse said that besides
tapes for the ‘‘Big Three’”’
languages--French, German,
and Spanish--the lab has tapes
for twelve other languages.
These languages are: Chinese,
Greek, Hebrew, Hindu-Urdu,
Italian, Japanese, Latin,
Norwegian, Portuguese, Rus-
sian, Sanskrit, and Swahili.

‘‘Most of these twelve are
for Dr. Jacobus’ Critical Lang-
uage Program,” said Snouse.

Snouse said that the lan-
guage departments are not the
only departments using the
Language bab. Dr. Rupert
Barber, Professor of Speech
and Drama, has theater tapes
in the lab for his students. -

“The English Department is
having us put several plays on
cassettes. This is a slower
process than making cassettes
from the reel-to-reel masters.

“The plays are on records,
which must be played through
at a normal speed to make a
cassette master,”’ said Snouse.

In addition, Snouse said
that Professor Jean Cornell of

‘the Speech Department is

using the lab with a, class this
fall, and the Sociology Depart-
ment had discussed putting
tapes of famous speeches and
lectures in the lab.

Snouse said that students
who want personal copies of
tapes in the lab can have the
lab personnel make these
copies.

‘‘The student furnishes a
blank cassette. We will make

- copies of any of the lab tapes

without charge,’’ said Snouse,
adding that 67 tapes were
made for students in Sept-
ember.

The Language Lab is open
68 hours a week, including
Saturday mornings and Sun-
day afternoons and evenings.
Snouse is assisted by work-
study students. three after-
noons a week, plus evenings
and weekends.

“Last month, 2170 people
used the lab. On the average,
160-170 people use the lab
each day during the week,’’
said Snouse.
