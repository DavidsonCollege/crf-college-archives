record since 1933, For

the season the record book shows six vietorios, three defen s
and one tie. We won't try tooplace the three losses as tm ra
victories, but it gertainly would not be a stretch of the truth
to place the. 14-14 tie with VMI in that of) overburdyned

put on one of their best games before the happy but weary
homecoming crowd,

Probably the man who should receive’ the lion's share of
the credit for the glories is Coach Bill Story, In his sophomore
year as a college coach, Story made a name for himself among
Wildeat backers. It necessarily follows that we @xpress deep
regret in losing ‘‘the man from the Deep South.”

A big portion of the credit should also eo to Assistant
Coaches Charlie Jamerson, Al Mo neyhan, and Dick Redding
Jamerson, who succeeds Story at the helm, was backfield
couch and chief scout. It was his reports that told the Cats
of the next week's foes. He will be sorely missed in this post.

Moneyhan could always be seen on top of the press: box

with binoculars and telephone in hand reporting to the bene’
onall plays in the game. His reports did more than any in find
ing the right subs at the right time,
* But with all the orchids we do not mean fo take one bit
of the credit from the boys who did the sweating and Niel
ing. The ‘big red line’? wasn our mind the most formidabls
in the annals of the Red and Black. MH certainly was the
strong point of the squad led by Hd Rhodes, Carl Eborn,
Buddy Chandler and Johnny Richards only to mention a few.
A fleet and hard-driving set of backs worked well behind this
bulk. Carl Sheppard, Jim Sifford, Mae Erwin, and Buek Wil
liams paced this group which followed the blocking of Dave
Poole and Charlie Rimer,

At the same time the ¢ridiron boys were parading their
wares, another Wildcat team was celebrating its return te
action atter a lapse-of eight years. The cross country squad,
led by Capt. Jack Gray, Blake Bradley and-Bob Grube eased
through a season whieh dealt it no defeats in dual competition.

As Old) Man Winter moved in Coach Norman Sheppard
issued the call to the hardwood for his basketeers. Co-Captains
Buddy Cheek and Mike Williams led the squad which waltzed
through the season with a’ 19-8 record, and advaneed to the
semi-finals in the Southern Conference tournament, High
light of the early season was a 44-42 upset over Duke’s
talented Blue Devils, a feat not accomplished since 1988.

The Cats rode into the tournament and trounced Maryland
in the first round before bowing out to Duke in the semi-
finals. The victory over Maryland was sweet revenge for ai
early season setback by the Old Liners.

Cheek set a terrifie pace in piling up 870 points for the
season with 124 of them coming on free throws. He was justly
honored by being-placed on the All-Conference five.

The same team which wore Wildeat colors this year will
be around for duty again next year, Williams and Cheek have
again beerf” elected co-captains. Whit Cobb, J. D. Ashmore,
and Bob Maner will be on eall to round out the starting five.
On reserve are Dave Poole, Bo Roddey, Bill Iverson, Duteh
Hengeveld, Ed Hopper and Dick Mills.

Spring sports are still going strong but the boys have
given a pretty good indication that they will hold up their
end of the bargain.

As we go to press the baseball team has rung up a U0)
average with eight wins and as many losses. Though that
mark won’t burn up any league, it is still a vast improvement
over recent years. Coach Charlie Jamerson has built a winning
combine around virtually the same club which last year
managed to win only one game. The.addition of freshman
ace Dick Marlowe to the mound staff is probably the main
feature of improvement, but due to studies Marlowe is only
around for home duty. Me

Two other freshmen have moved in and grabbed starting
berths. Dave Poole shifted easily from the hardwood to the
diamond to nail down the number one catcher’s job, Auburn
Lambeth has shown sufficient batting power to move into the
starting. rightfield spot.

Only two other changes from last year’s squad were the
shifting of Hal Mapes from behind the plate to first base,
and the finding of Bill Bird to take over the hot corner duties
from Bert Anderton. Bird was around last year but never had
a chance to show his wares, but when given a chance this
year he quickly proved himself. SSP BEE
