The 1971 edition of the
Davidson football team will
be unveiled Saturday night,
as the Wildcats journey to
Winston-Salem for a_ clash
with highly regarded Wake
Forest.

Davidson coach Dave Fagg
was faced with severe grad-
uation losses, and will field
a relatively young, inexperi-
enced squad.

A lot of questions will be
answered when the 'Cats get
their baptism of fire Satur-
day.

Two Quarterbacks Lead Offense

Seldom does one encounter

a football team that could be
described as_ schizophrenic.

Football teams normally in-
spire a great number of ad
jectives, many of them in
psychological terms, but us
ually they run along” the
lines of ‘‘ambitious’’ or
“aggressive.”

The Wildcat team that
faces the Demon Deacons to
morrow night could be de-
scribed as schizophrenic. It
has two heads.

The teams dual _ identity
stems from the fact that the
‘Cats have two © starting
quarterbacks.

Rick Kemmerlin and Scot

EITHER...
. Scotty Shipp

Lowry Signed As
Freshman Cager

The Davidson cagers con-
cluded their recruiting for
this year with the signing of
Jim Lowry during the sum-
mer.

Lowry averaged 22 points
a game as a senior in Hen-
derson, Ky. and was named
all-State honorable mention.
He shot 44 per cent from
the floor and 78 per cent
from the foul line.

During his senior year,
Lowry averaged eight as-
sists per game. |

Lowry is the son of a past
Wildcat cager.

Lowry is the fourth recruit
to join the Wildkittens, Greg
Dunn, Larry Horowitz and
Sheldon Parker were recruit-
ed during the past year.

ty Shipp are both filling in
the key slot and neither
seems to have developed
much of an edge over the
other.

“They are both doing an
excellent job.’ said Ernie
Tall. Davidson's new back-
field coach, ‘‘and it’s hard to
say right now who has the
advantage.”

Shipp quarterbacked in the
Catawba scrimmage and led
the ‘Cats to their vic-
tory, but Kemmerlin got a
lot of time in too.

Tall said that Shipp will
likely lead off in the Wake
game, because he is a little
faster than Kemmerlin, and
could possibly work better
with a running backfield.

But he would forecast no-
thing else.

“We're going to go with
Scotty because he’s look-
ed real good in practice the
last couple of days.” he said,
“but we will likely play Rick
a good deal, too.”

So, still two quarterbacks,
neither actually edging out
the other.

Shipp is considered a ‘‘sort
of triple threat man" by the
coaches.

He is a good passer, an ac-
complished runner and_ the
team's punter. He got a
litle more experience than
Kemmerlin last year behind
Mark Thompson, including a
51 yard scoring pass against
VMI.

But Kemmerlin is still con-
sidered the team’s best pas-
ser by Tall.

Shipp’s performance in the
spring game showed 12

passes completed for 15.
Kemmerlin hit 12 of 18.

Tall also said that both
Shipp and Kemmerlin exhib-
ited comparable talents for
team leadership.

“Each will make a fine
quarterback,’ he said, “they
can both w work with the team

and are good leaders.”’
And so the Wildcats con.

tinue with two heads,
quarterbacks _ of roughly
equal ability - Scotty Shipp
considered by some to be

more of a_ ground attack
quarterback, and Rick Kem-
merlin, the Wildcat passer.

Two New Coaches

Join Cat Gridders

By CHARLIE TERRELL
Sports Writer

Two new faces will be on
the sidelines tomorrow night
when the Wildcats meet the
Wake Forest Demon Dea-
cons, and they belong to as-
sistant coaches. Ernie Tall
and Alex Gettys.

The addition of Tall, who
will handle the offensive
backs and receivers, and Get-
tys, who will work with the
defensive line, compensates
for the loss of Will Campag-
na, former Davidson assist-
ant now coaching at A. L.
Brown High School in Kan-
napolis.

Tall is a graduate of West-
ern Michigan University,
waere his playing career was
curtailed by an injury as a
freshman. He served as West-
ern Michigan freshman and
“redshirt” coach from 1966
through 1969.

He then moved to the Uni-
versity of South Carolina as
a graduate assistant on Paul
Dieizel’s staff.

At Western Michigan he
earned a degree in physical
education and mathematics,
and holds a masters degree
in education from South Car-
olina.

“I’m happy to be here, and
this is a fine opportunity for
me to work with Dave Fagg,”
Tall remarked.

“The program here is on
the upswing, and I know
we'll be there Saturday,” he
concluded.

When Gettys was a fresh-
man player at The Citadel
in 1965, an assistant coach
named Dave Fagg was there
also.

Since then the 24-year-old

native of Pickens, S. C., has
earned his degree in busi-
ness administration, and is
nearing completion of work
at South Carolina for his
masters degree.

Like Tall, he was a grad-
uate assistant under Dietzel
last vear.

Gettys describes the de-
fensive line as a blend of un-
tested and experienced play-
ers.

He cited junior Bill Gar-
rett as one of the finest tack-
les in the conference.

“‘However, he will be in-
experienced at the other
tackle spot and we will rely
heavily on sophomores for
our back-up positions,” he
noted. ;

Preparing the players to
play Wake Forest presents
a great challenge to Gettys.

“The attitude is just out-
of-sight, really excellent, and

we are going into this game

to win,” he commented.

He has been particularly
impressed with the way the
team worked during training
at Camp Carolina and other
pre-season work.

Praising his former coach,
he pointed out that ‘‘Coach
Fagg really has the interest
of the players at heart. He
is young enough to remem-
ber what it was like to be a
player.”

To many spectators and
fcotball scribes, a Davidson-
Wake Forest match-up seems
a bit ludicrous, but as Gettys
puts it, ‘“‘we have everything
to gain from this game.”

If he and Tall have any-
thing to do with it, the Wild-
cats will do more than just
“be there.”

set,’ says Fagg. “But see
still have some fights for at.
fensive positions.” ---- :

On. defense, Mike  Sikés
and Jimmy Hardison will
start at the ends. Both have
been shifted from lineback-
er. Bill Garrétt returns at
one tackle, where he shoultl
shine, while sophomore Mike
McFarland will start oppe-
site him.

Seniors “Woody _Montgoris-
ery, John Barbee,

Norris and Joe Poteat fort

backers. The deep mew

Vandiver, John Maloney and
Terry Woodlief return.

On offense; however; @ rash
of injuries -has causedl head-
aches for Fagg in an area
which already had many
question marks.

The Wildcats expect a a mare
balanced attack this year,
with tast year’s top rushers,
John Ribet and Bill Bracken,
returning.

“I don’t think we’ll be quite
as bound by down, distance
and field position play cali-
ing tendences as we . have
been in the past,” Fagg said.

Scotty Shipp and Rick Kem-
merlin are running neck-and-
neck for the starting nod at
quarterback. ‘‘Shipp has the
inside track but the position

is still up for grabs,” ac-
“cording to Fagg.

Either can throw capably,
so the Wildcats won't aban
don the airways completely,
but there should be less pass-
ing coupled with the improv-
ed running game. Harold Wil-
kerson’s kicking is a plys,
also.

The offensive line was dec-
imated by graduation and is
the team’s biggest question
mark. ,

Tight end Andy Davis is
the only returning starter.
Guards Robert Elliot and
Jim Ellison, and split end
Randy Parker are lettermen
who move up from last ues
second team.

Larry Spears. and Gary
Coulter are the tackles with
Bill Nicklas at. center. -All
are junior non-lettermen. -.

About Wake Forest, dé-
fending ACC champions and
favored to repeat, Fagg says,
“They have one of the finest
college backfields in the cotin-
try and their defense is go-
ing to ‘be a lot better than
they would lead” you to” be-
lieve.” ~

The Deacons have 15-start-
ers back from the 1970 squad,
including All-ACC~ quarter:
back ‘Larry Russell and All-
ACC fullback Larry Hop:

Russell directs the Wake

cons have several other
