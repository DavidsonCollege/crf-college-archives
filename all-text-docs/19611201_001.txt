College Moves Forward
In Foreign Study Area

BY TOM LOFLIN
Davidsonian Staff Writer

Recognizing the need for encouraging Davidson
students to consider a period of study abroad, President
D. Grier Martin appointed a Foreign Study Committee,
composed of four faculty members, this past month.

The committee includes Chair-
man J. O. Embry, Prof. Thomas
QO. Pinkerton, Prof. Donald W.
Tucker, and Prof. Bradley D.
Thompson. The first meeting
was held Tuesday, Nov. 21, at
which time the official policy
of the college was drawn up.

Davidson’s new policy toward
study abroad will make it easier
for students to obtain informa-
tion about overseas study and
obtain credit here for work done
while in foreign universities.

FOUR AREAS

The committee will assist
students ir the following four
areas: poe ,raduate work in for-
eign countries, without regard
for college credit; a junior year
abroad for full credit; a junior
year abroad as an independent
student with full, partial, or no

Davidson

Receives
$250,000

Davidson College réteiv-
ed Tuesday two special
grants of $125,000 each
from The Duke Endowment,
which has regularly given
gifts and financial support
to the college in the past.

President Martin said that
the grants were not unexpected.
“We have come to depend upon
them,” he commented.

These ‘special grants are a
regular part of The Duke En-
dowment program, which has
given financial support to the
college every three months for
the past several years.

One of the $125,000 grants
will be used toward the salaries
of the faculty and staff as pro-
vided for by the trustees in ac-
tion last year. The other grant
will go into Davidson’s endow-
ment.

Davidson's endowment con-
consists of over 10 million dol-
lars in gifts and bequests in-
vested in common stocks and
other securities under the aus-
pices of investment counselors.
The income from. the endow-
ment is used to run the college.

This $125,000 will be of
special help to Davidson toward
meeting a challenge issued by
the Richardson Foundation fast
year. This foundation has agreed
to give Davidson $1,300,000 if
Davidson can raise $425,000
from other sources.

The Duke Endowment was es-
tablished by the late James B.
Duke to make annual appro-
priations for operating expenses
to Davidson, Duke, Furman, and
Johnson C. Smith. The special
grants, such as the two Davidson
received Tuesday, are given for
various projects outside of oper-
ating expenses.

Last year, Davidson used both

i ee

credit given; and a summer of
study and travel without
academic credit.

The new policy will go into
effect immediately and will ap-
ply to current sophomores and
freshmen.

In order for a Davidson stud-
ent to take his junior year a-
broad under the new program,
he must first consult with a
member of the committee —
Embry for French speaking
countries, Pinkerton for Ger-
man speaking lands, Tucker for
Spanish, and Thompson for all
other languages.

APPLICATION
Next an application.must be
submitted to the committee be-
fore Jan. 15 of the year preced-
ing the junior year. The applica-
tion will include a statement of
purpose for study abroad and
choice of courses, a four year
program for the student with
the signature of a professor in
his major field. a copy of his
college transcript with at least
a 1.75 average, and a letter of

approval from a parent.

A student will be required to
have completed at least through
the 21-22 language course for a
program where part of the
courses are in English and
through 31-32 for a program
where all of the courses are in
a foreign language, or fill this
deficiency by an intensive sum-
mer school program.

The Foreign Study Commit-
tee will study applications and
make recommendations to the
dean of students by Jan. 25;
each student will be notified of
the acceptance or rejection of
his application by Feb. 1.

MUST KEEP JOURNAL

In order to receive credit for
the junior year’ abroad. a stud-
ent in the program will have io
keep a journal for submission to
the committee upon returning.
In the journal, the student will
list his courses and professors,
textbooks and parallel reading
done for each course, a state-
ment of the subject of each class

Firearms
Change
Proposed

The Student Council voted
unanimously Wednesday night
to present to the student body
an amendment to the section of
the Student Body Constitution
which deals with possession of
firearms on campus.

The amendment is designed to
extend the present regulation in
the constitution to prohibit the
keeping of firearms anywhere
on the campus of Davidson Col-
lege without the express per-
mission of the Student Council.

At present, the regulation
merely prohibits the keeping of
firearms in dormitories, but the
council was disturbed over the
danger imposed by students
keeping firearms in fraternity
houses.

To encourage the use of the
college gun room, the Council
had extra gun lockers built to
make sure all requests for space
could be granted.

The Council also decided to
set up a new system of locks for
the lockers and the gun room
itself to further safeguard the
weapons. A combination lock
will be put on the main door of
the room, with another lock on
each individual locker.

Student Body _—‘ President
George Trask will present. the
amendment in chapel next Mon-
day, and on the following Mon-
day the student body will vote
on it. A two-thirds majority of
the student vote is required to
pass an amendment to the con-
stitution.

Other action’ at the council
meeting included a decision to
participate in the State Student
Legislature next March. Dele-
gates will be chosen at the be-
ginning of the second semester
by a committee composed of
Student Council members and
faculty representatives.

All students are eligible to.
attend the legislature as dele-
gates, and selection procedures
will be announced at a later
date.

Trask also announced that the
Elections Committee will be
chosen next week. That com-
mittee will be composed of a
senior from each of the twelve
fraternities and one independ-
ent senior.

YMCA Gift Fund Goes

Businessman Offers
$500 Challenge Gift

BY WILLIAM WALKER
Davidsonian Staff Writer

__The student body of Davidson College has selected
Taijon College, in Taijon, South Korea as the recipient of
the proceeds from the YMCA’s Gift Fund Project drive.

The project, which is being
sponsored by the Presbyterian
Church, was selected as the re-
sult of a student body balloting
on Nov. 28. It was one of four
such projects offered to the
student body during chapels
over the past two weeks for
consideration. Presented by
Miss Carole Cameron of Queens
College, it claimed 50 per cent
of the 585 votes cast to win the
balloting.

$4000 GOAL

“Our project is to buy labora-
tory equipment, library refer-
ence books, and textbooks for
the college.” said John Williams,
spokesman for the Y.

Contributions to this year's
project will be sought all next
week by solicitors for the Y.
One person on each hall will dis-
tribute envelopes personally, re-
ported Bob Moore, who is in
charge of the financial end of
the project.

This collection will begin
Monday. Faculty members will
also be contacted in the drive
which extends through Friday.
The Y has established a goal of
$4,000 to be raised locally.

An anonymous challenge gift
of $500 has been made to the
Y by a southern businessman
having no connectiog with Dav-
idson. He will match every dol-
lar, up to $500, which the Y
raises above the $3,500 level.

That much money has not
been donated since 1956 when
$4,700 was raised for a Hungar-
jan refugee family which moved
to Davidson.

Last year, students selected
the Madras, India Boys Town to
be the recipient of the gift

Fraternity Men Prefer
Present Form Of Rush

BY BOB REYNOLDS
Davidsonian Staff Writer

The results of the poll conducted two weeks ago by the Interfraternity Council
have shown that two-thirds of the approxi mately 300 fraternity members and pledges
who responded favor a form of rush similar to that of last year.

“The purpose of the poll,”
said IFC President Bob Waugh,
“was to give all concerned a
chance to say how they wanted
rush to be carried out, and we
also wanted to get the swing of
student opinion. Though we had
hoped for a better response, in
many cases students have shown

special funds to improve faculty | that they had put much thought

Of the 255 who expressed
definite inclinations either way,
81 per cent of the seniors, 79
per cent of the juniors, 83 per
cent of the sophomores, and 67

ments on the advantages and dis-
advantages of the present setup,
the poll met with a variety of
replies, mostly from those who
oppose delayed rush.

These comments usually point-
ed out the needs of freshmen for
friendships, aid, and general
security in the early months of
their college career. These peo-
ple felt that this “general se-
curity” could best be provided
through fraternities.

‘PUTTING UP FRONT’

Several mentioned that with
a delayed rush many freshmen
and fraternity members would
be put through the strain of
“putting up a good front,” while
others held the opinion that the
friendly atmosphere on the Dav-
idson campus is largely caused
by the close contact of freshman
and upperclassman during rush.

In the main. those who favor-
ed delayed rush felt that the
present system is based too
much on first impressions and
that delayed rush would serve to
lessen the problem.

USEFULNESS OF POLL |

As to how the poll would be 1
used, Waugh said that the IFC,
“will shortly come up with a
definite plan for the conduct of
rush next year. The plan will be
based on student opinion and;
what we feel can best be work-
ed out of the situation.”

For a final note Waugh add-
ed, “Last year student apathy
was a major factor that led to
the threat of sophomore rush.

but in asking for definite com

funds. The money was used to
build additional facilities there
for homeless boys. Two years
ago, $3,200 was raised and em-
ployed to purchase equipment
for the Christian Hospital in
Bangkok, Thailand.

A CHRISTIAN COLLEGE

Taijon is a liberal arts college
with 140 students and four de-
partments: English literature,
religion, mathematics and phy-
sics, and chemistry. It concen-
trates most heavily on the
sciences.

The five-year-old college has
been fully accredited by the
South Korean government from
the time of its opening in 1956.
It is open to Christian students
from South Korea, and stipu-
lates that its faculty, as well as
its students, be Christian. The
faculty contains some foreign-
ers, including Americans.

VERY SMALL 8UDGET

“It operates on a budget of
$32.000 a year, which is very
small for ‘ils needs.’ said Wil-
Hiams. At present it requires
only about $300 a year for a
student's tuition. Furthermore,
the recent change of govern-
ments in South Korea has in-
creased the college's financial
problems.

“Because the present Korean

government required a tax on
the school,” Williams said, “they
were forced to cut the faculty
salaries by about five per cent.
The state universities are ablr
to offer the, faculty larger salar-
ies than they are now receiv-
ing.” Many of the faculty mem-
bers commute for miles to the
college to teach one day a week.
The salary cut has made state
university offers even more ap-
pealing.

‘WESTERN EDUCATION’

Outside of contributions such
as the Gift Fund Project, Tai-
jon’s primary financial backing
comes from the Board of World
Missions of the Presbyterian
Church which is the organization
most concerned with the col-
lege. Williams said that both he
and Bob Moore, the Y’s solicita-
tions committee chairman, were
confident that they “can raise
about $4000" with the whole-
hearted support of the student
body.

Williams feels that the out-
standing feature of the college
is that “they are giving a west-
ern type education” with the
emphasis on practical know-
ledge and its application to the
problems that surround them.
