By George Ennett
As Told To Friedrich Otts

In accordance with the policy
adopted last week of bringing to
the attention of their fellow stu-
dents within the hallowed walls of
Davidson the daring deeds of the
most outstanding of the many war
heroes in school, the Davidsonian
continues this week with the ac-
counts of one of the most famed of
the famed—George, alias “Dum-
Dum,” alias, ‘“Possiero,” alias
“Bull” Ennett of Sky Club, N. C.

Mountaineer

Fame is nothing new to the Mon-
ster of Montreat. Even before his
nefarious deeds in the late great
conflict came to light, his name had
been headlined in every newspaper,
his picture had been placed in every
post office from Bangor to Bakers-
field, little boys everywhere sent
in box tops for ‘Dum-Dum” comic
books; grown men imitated his
‘hairdo, to the great distress of
American barbers. As a member of
the pérsonal staff of the king of
the Manhattan Underworld, “Gen-
tleman Jim’ McKants, and as star
sharpshooter in an
known far and wide to cops as the
most dangerous in existence, he had

organization

riseh rapidly in his chosen profes-
sion, being universally recognized
as an expert in the use of the sawed
of shotgun, the tommy gun, the
hot foot, and the “Wood-up.” Hence
his “Dum-Dum”, which in
this does not refer ‘to the

name
case

At the outbreak of the war, and
in keeping with the War Depart-
ment policy of placing men promi-
nent in civilian fields in similar
positions in the Army, General
Eisenhower summoned Ennett from
his haunts in the late spring of
1943. Motivated by a strong desire
to serve his country and by the
unique opportunity of polishing and
broadening his professional tech-

niques, our hero jumped to arms,
as a sort of personal ambassador

and-shortly after, sailed for France
between Harlem and the Rue
Pigalle.
Railroaded

Upon his arrival there, the break-
through at St. Lo had already oc-
curred, and the Germans were sur-
rendering in such numbers that the
Allied General Staff, fearing that
the mere sight of Ennett on the
front line would terrify the enemy
into last-ditch resistance as the
easiest way out, ordered him held
under wraps until a more propit-
uous moment should came along.
After a routine strip-down physical,
however, he was immediately as-
signed to the “Red Ball” Express,
most notorious of all black market
organizations. Ennett had often
heard from his fellow “Red Ballers”
of the advantages of this work, and
he looked forward to it eagerly.
Dame fortune, however, did not
smile on him for upon looking into
the contents of his first truckload,
he found not cigarettes, or K ra-
tions or chocolate bars, but a bailey
bridge. Undaunted, he set out with
typical Ennett spirit. Then’ fol-
lowed long periods of roaming the
French country side, looking in vain
for prospective customers, and fi-
nally settling for two bottles of
sparkling water and a big, black
German Shepherd. Life during this
time would have been unbearable
had it not been for the designing
company of a petite mademoiselle
named>La, Couchonne whom he met
on his first day in France. In
something less than a year, how-
ever, the Bulge broke and Ennett
was whisked away~to the front to
return to less active duty.

The rest of this heroic story will
be paned down from generation to
generation as long as war veterans
have children. Cut off by a Ger-
man counterattack in a little Bel-
gian village, Ennett and the rest
of his squad took refuge in a wine
and champagne cellar, Two days

Opens Drive

At a recent meeting of the Board
of Trustees of Davidson College,
permission was granted the admin-
istration to open a drive for the ad-
ditional funds necessary to cover
the costs of the construction of the
new gymnasium and church. Due
to the postwar rise in prices of both
construction materials and labor,
it has been estimated that the cost
of these buildings will be approxi-
mately 40 per cent more than the
amount so far,collected.

Tn addition to funds necessary for
the completion of the gym and
church, the proposed campaign is
going to have a second objective,
the raising of the present endow-
ment fund.

Accepted, To Be In Effect

An amendment and a fifth section
will be added to the Pan Hellenic
Council constitution by a necessary
three-fourths vote_of_the-Dakidson
social fraternities which was taken
March 13. These additions to
the constitution, which concerns it- *
self with the responsibilities of Pan
Hellenic Council in respect to col-
lege dances, will go into effect with
the first dance of next year. The
coming Spring Frolies will be gov-
erned by the present constitution,

Section three, to be altered by the
accepted amendment, has read up
until the present: “The signatory
chapters agree to underwrite with
their representatives all council
dances, the council and the several
chapters to assume 50 per cent of
the risk, respectively. In event of
loss, 50 per cent of the net loss will
be.prorated_among the chapters,
the remaining 50 per cent among
their representatives. In case of
gain, the net profit shall be divided
in like manner,”

Faults Eliminated
As stated in the above section
each fraternity -has in the past as-
sumed 50 per cent of all losses and
gains incurred by the Pan Hellenic
Council through its sponsorship of
school dances.

The recently accepted amendment
will allow the council to know, in
advance, exactly how much money
may be allotted to each of the var-
ious be met, and to
prepare for such accordingly. Here-

amendment reads as follows: “See-
