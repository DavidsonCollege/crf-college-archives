Education in Ill Light

Were Davidson Seniors given the op-
portunity of selecting the next president
of the College, Dr. Ben R. Lacy, presi-
dent Union Seminary,
Richmond, Va., the man, if
they are to be judged by their preference
as indicated questionnaire which
they recently filled out at the request
of the staff of The Davidsonian. Dr.
Lacy’s rival in the seniors’ eyes was Dr.
Taliaferro Thompson, Union
Seminary, who was almost as_ popular,
lacking only one vote.

This series of questions submitted to
the Class of 1929 brought forth many in-
teresting replies in regard to their own
personal preferences concerning David-
son as well as in the fields of world af-
fairs, literature, and so on. The response,
approximately one-third was considered
very good and, in the opinion of many is
typical of the entire body.

Following Dr. Thompson as a prefer-
ence as Davidson president came F. L.
Jackson, Dr. J. C. Rowan, S. Clay Wil-
liams, and Dr. Walter Lingle, in the order
named, "i

Seniors were asked to name their fay-
orite world figure, and some, interperting
literally, gave Colonel Charles Lindbergh,
who won first place, a good race with
Joan Crawford. Benito Mussolini was
popular for the nomination but was not
sufficiently strong to crowd the leader.
Other celebrities, and near celebrities,
were Calvin Coolidge, John W. Davis,
Herbert Hoover, Edison, Ejnstein, H. R.
H. the Prince of Wales, Will Rogers,
Ghandi, and Owen D. Young.

Jean Valajen won over D’Artagnan as
the choice of characters in fiction even
though Douglas Fairbanks had so re-
cently played as the latter at the local
theater in “The Iron Mask.” Philo Vance
ran well indeed but had not enough his-
torical: background, perhaps, to capture
first place. Tom Jones, Don Quixote
and Romeo were popular figures with the
seniors. Among others mentioned were,
Sir William Blakeney, King Arthur,
Hawkeye, Scattergood Baines, Ivanhoe,
Huck Finn, and Oliver Twist.

Southern sons were decided in their
choice of Robert E. Lee over Napoleon
and Woodrow Wilson, even though the
latter’s attendance at Davidson might have
been expected to garner enough votes
to put him across. Alexander the Great,
LaFayette, George Washington and Liv-
ingstone also ran.

“The Count of Monte Cristo” and “A
Tale of Two Cities’ were almost as
popular as “Les Miserables” but the lat-

The large number of members of the
scholastic order in the class, they point
out, testifies to their standard of values.

Princeton, had a number of fourth
year men not come here, would probably
be preparing to give them diplomas>this
Spring. Washington and Lee was pop-
ular, being next in line, with North
Carolina third. Vanderbilt, N.C. State,
Duke polled some votes. Some Seniors,
probably interested in the gentle art of
wooing, indicated Converse and N. G
C. W. as a second choice,

There was a stiff race between the
practical members of the class and their
idealistic brothers when Accounting
nosed Philosophy out as the most valu-
able subject which they had studied, His-

Biology were believed most valuable in
the order named.
