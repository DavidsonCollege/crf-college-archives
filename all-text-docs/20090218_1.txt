‘White Out’ will
help raise funds

The content of basketball locker
room conversations rarely appears
in the pages of The Davidsonian.

- One conversation’s impact, how-
ever, continues to grow and affect
€ the lives of more than just the Da-
+ af vidson student body.
_ According to Andrew Lovedale
’09, the Men’s Basketball Team
came up with the original idea of
sending their used basketball shoes
overseas (still in very good condi-
tion) while talking in their locker
room. After completing his first
year at Davidson, Lovedale brought
shoes and practice gear donated by
his teammates to his hometown of
Benin City, Nigeria.

Together with the Men’s Bas-
ketball Team, Samaritan’s Feet (a
non-profit organization that deliv-
ers Shoes of Hope worldwide) and
alumni organized by Pete Ashcroft
’57, Lovedale hopes to collect
thousands of shoes this weekend at
the “White Out” game versus But-
ler University.

The days when Lovedale first
received media coverage for his
basketball prowess have long since
passed. With the new initiative to
send shoes where they are needed,
Lovedale’s basketball career at Da-

Ursula Oppens
combines traditional and
contemporary.

As Davidson sets out to assess
its Strategic Plan, trustees, board
members, faculty and _ students
have asked themselves “what will
Davidson look like in ten years?”

With this question in mind, the
faculty-led Committee on Curricu-
lum Development (CCD) will pres-
ent a review of the current curricu-

- Jum and a plan with recommended
changes to the rest of the faculty in
April. Based on this general plan,
the CCD will establish specific
strategies to achieve its goals.

“We are looking at where we
are now and what we’d like to see
in ten years,” Professor Swallow,
Chair of the CCD said. This means
working with the Principal Execu-
tive Staff who is responsible for the
college’s Presidential Strategic As-
sessment to find what direction the
college should take. Reviewing the
curriculum is a main component of
this plan.

CCD came up with four broad-
ly defined objectives it would like
to see Davidson students integrate

are globalization, diversity and in-
clusivity, sustainability and inter-
disciplinary study. “We have laid
out these high-level objectives,”
Swallow said, “and now we’re fig-
uring out the strategies to achieve
those.”

While details of these strategies
are not definite yet, and might not
be for a few years, some of the ideas
under discussion include increas-
ing the number of international
students, the variety of professors’
fields and backgrounds and the
available study-abroad programs.

“So, we are hoping to have more
of an interdisciplinary approach,”
Michelle Jester ’09 from last year’s
Curriculum Study Group said. This
might mean shifting the focus of
core requirements from specific
disciplines to specific skills.

These “core skill” requirements
could include moral reasoning, cre-
ative arts, quantitative analysis and
others. For the different skills, stu-
dents could integrate more than one
field of study, thereby approaching
each problem from several per-
Spectives and using different meth-
ods. “This would hopefully reduce
the number of course requirements

overall while still providing stu-
dents with the value of a liberal arts
education,” Jester said.

The goal is to make this global,
diverse and interdisciplinary study
“more institutionalized,” Swallow
said. As of now, the best resource
for students to integrate several
fields in one major is to go through
the Center for Interdisciplinary
Studies (CIS). What the CCD has
in mind is something similar to a
CIS major but available as a regu-
lar major, or as Swallow stated, to
set up for students “a more normal
process to Pursue an interdisciplin-
ary major.”

Another idea to diversify the
college is to attract more interna-
tional students and professors. ““We
want to incentivize a greater diver-
sity of people to apply to David-
son,” SGA President Davis Green
’09 said. The assumption is that a
more international student body ex-
poses all students to cultures unlike
their own, thus globalizing every-
one’s awareness.

low, when the CCD met with all

As many students already
know, Davidson has a rich tradi-
tion in the training of future doc-
tors and dentists, known around
campus as “Pre-Med.” But
Davidson also offers other pre-
professional: programs that do
not get as much attention, such
as Education, Engineering, Pre-
Ministry and Army Reserve Of-
ficers’ Training Corps (ROTC).
Most students have no idea what
comprises these programs.

Dr. Rick Gay, the chair of .
the education pre-professional -
programs, said that, “Students —
have the option to complete a li-
censure concentration with us in
secondary education in the fields
of English, mathematics, social
studies, French, Spanish, Latin
or the sciences.’

With the completion of their
concentration the Davidson stu-
dent would be recommended to
receive a professional teaching
license issued by the state of
North Carolina. “The goal of the
education department,” Gay said,
“is to help all Davidson students
who want to go into teaching,
whether they earn a concentra-
tion with us or not.”

In the past ten years, 26 Da-
vidson students have completed
the Licensure Concentration;
since the spring of ’02, 43 stu-
dents have completed the inter-
disciplinary concentration.

Davidson’s engineering pre-
professional program cooper-
ates with a dual degree program
alongside Columbia University
in New York and Washington
University in St. Louis. This pro-
gram requires students to stay at
Davidson for three years, and if
they are accepted, they will at-
tend the engineering school for
two years.

There have been students
who choose to continue on at
Davidson for their senior year
as well, giving the student more
flexibility in their classes. Da-
vidson’s website states: “upon
successful completion of the
prescribed courses in the dual
degree program, the student re-
ceives bachelor’s degrees from
both Davidson and the engineer-
ing school.”

This represents a great op-
portunity for any aspiring en-
