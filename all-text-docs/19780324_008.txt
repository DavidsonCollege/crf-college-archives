Martin determined to keep fields dry

By BAD BERNARD

Staff Writers

There are certain things in life
which cannot be separated.
Sandwiches go with soup; Hor-
ses go with carriages; Christian
professors go with good facul-.
ties; Horseflies go with cow-
turds; and beer goes with
softball. This spring however,
Sterling Martin, the czar and
Napoleon of the IMAC fields,
has strictly forbidden the drin-
king of beer while playing
softball.
' He justified this edict thusly:
“Bernie, we just can’t afford to
keep paying for all the lost balls
that drunk people throw away
or foul off. And I’ll be damned if
you think that I am going to
replace all of the trees and
bushes that have been yellowed
and destroyed by people taking
leaks (i.e. making No. 1’s.(.”

Sterling showed he meant
business when on Sunday, he
called out the ROTC reserves,'
armed with large, blunt rocks'
and headed by Lard McDonald,
to surround the team called
Slack to the Slack Power.

Several of the smally, long-
haired Slack radicals began
jeering the soldiers and offering
them beer, whereupon reserve
buck Private Chippy Bondurant
hollered, ‘‘Kill the Commies.”
Following their leader’s orders,
the remainder of the soldiers
began hurling the big rocks at
the protestors. Several Slack
Players were stoned and had to
be carried from the field.

So this spring if we can’t get
drunk, at least we can get
stoned, so Play Ball!

SCOUTING REPORT

1) Slack to the Slack Power:
Strengths-good rapport with
IMAC officials tends to give
this team an edge. Also, Sherry
Barker serves as a distraction to
the other teams. Weaknesses-
Team’s players tend to be fuzzy
minded at times and often have
difficulty running the bases in
proper order.

2) Dartus Tunic and the Big
13: Strengths-Good size where
it counts. ‘Had good spring
training in Florida and most of
the players are back from last
year’s team that finished third.
Weaknesses—team has low
self-image and feels overshad-
owed by other awesome KA
teams, like Spring Fever.

3) Cannonballs: Strengths-
Team can rely on Sandy R. to
pull them through the first few
games. Algo the loss of Boke,
and Big R is a plus. Weaknes-
ses-Nard, Kareem, Max, Abdul
and the rest of the players. Also
Richie has problems with Mar-
pad and cannot keep his clothes

Will Miller checks his package

he often can pitch a no hitter.

Jonesy will provide depth in the
field, and the addition of the Pi

Phi’s cannot hurt. Weaknesses-

Players have a hard time get-
ting their little boys off, and
spring training at Fort Lauder-
dale was interrupted by a sky
diving contest.

5) Whizz Kids: Strengths-
Bert Downs has improved his
throwing ability, and can now
easily throw a ball from second
to first. RoRo returns after a
JYA experience (Jr. Year as a
Cannonball)-and Dodah is more
serious minded now without a
beard. Weaknesses-Tex and

4) Ragmen: Strengths-When |

element to this happy go lucky
group of youngsters.

6) McFleet and Stuff:
Strengths-Team now controls
two very powerful student offi-
ces and may attempt a Coup
D’Etat if they don’t win the
title. Also, addition of Locke
White from the Cannonballs
may help. Weaknesses-Team
has a tendency to play like the
L.A. Dodgers in the playoffs.

7) The Four’ Skins:
Strengths-They have a direct
connection with the Great One.
They have a tendency to make
plays out of their derrieres, and
in tournament play they. play
about 10 feet over their head.

Weaknesses-their players.
8)Presto’s Grill: Strengths-
All are strong hitters and they
may win it all, just as they did
last year. Weaknesses-The loss
of ace vereran pitcher Jon Hart.
whom we all loved and che-

rished dearly.
This concludes our sneak
_ at softball and if your

team didn’t get mentioned,
don’t feel bad, because you
probably weren't good enough
anyway. It goes without saying
that none of the teams men-
tioned are freshmen halls, be-
cause it takes at least a year for
students to learn to mix alcohol
and solftball and still win.
That's al s all for now. GBO.
