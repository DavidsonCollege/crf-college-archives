Schleifer contests Abagui’s claims

To the Editor:

In response to Mr. Abagui’s article
of the 20th: I agree with Mr. Abagui’s
assertion that we in the United States
know only what we read in the press
concerning the Middle East. That is
where any agreement ends. For the
rest, I was amazed, shocked, and
offended by his ideas. Mr. Abagui
may be closer to the Middle East but
1 teel this only makes his own
thoughts colored by ‘‘conditioned
slanted prejudices and ideals.’

Mr. Abagui calls the press in the
United States our ‘‘pro-Zionist and
Opinion

Jewish controlled mass média.”’ Yet

he begins his article‘with a pro-Sadat -

quote from an American.’magazine
which chose Sadat as its ‘Man ofthe
Year’. The liberal press in the United
States, which sided with North Korea
throughout that debacle, is anything

but pro-Israel. In fact, their preju-

dices may lead them closer to a true

and fair evaluation of the situation.
Mr. Abagui calls the Israeli ap-

proach to the peace‘talks and their
way of bargaining ‘‘capricious ‘and
obstinate attempts of resistance on
the part of a selfish minority that is

“Michael is somewhat younger than
me, but he looks older.’’ —Lord
Caradon

It was a field day for the Davidson
Anglophiles: a real life British Peer on
campus. Well, to be technical he was
not your actual hereditary, medieval
peasant mangling sort, but he does
have a castle and regularly walks with
his hands behind his back in the
British aristocratic style. It’s funny
how common that suddenly became
on campus last week!

As a member of the welcoming

committee—i never thought I would —

be a token Limey—I did have
occasion to meet his lordship. Im-

pressions? Well, at first not many. .

Obviously a learned man, vastly.
experienced in international affairs.
“T say, did you know he was once
Secretary of State for Foreign and
Commonwealth Affairs?’ extremely
genteel, and vaguely olde worldly
Then I listened. ‘Typical ‘Coterié]
Blimp’ type,’’ I thought; “Should

have gone down with the Empire and
made the world.safe for irreverent
ne’re-do-wells like myself.” ‘‘God, if
he had his way, I’d be in the army

fighting in the far flung reaches of the
Empires.” Don’t laugh! We still have
Hong Kong and Gibraltar, not forget-
ting good old Northern Ireland, that
nome away from home for willing
British troops. Then I listened again.

He dealt extraordinarily well with
our friend who regularly seethes with
Zionist/Russian/Imperialist § para-
noia; perhaps he had something
interesting to say after all. I inter-
viewed him. Result—a complete
blank. “I am not that interested in
politics back home.”’ “‘But in this era
of nationalism I think Britain has a —
definite role to play.”’ “We have
wonderful connections through the
Commonwealth, our relationship with
the Americans, and now, of course, as
members of the EEC.” ‘‘I would like

: aebo.ece Britain. take a more positive
role in worlu ‘affairs; ‘we should: Conc’

up with some new initiatives."" Save

Of course this initiative would come
from a country faced with a million
unemployed, racial trouble and a
growing Fascist party, arguments o-
ver Scottish devolution, a balance of
payments problem that occasionally
would send John Maynard Keynes
racing for his slide rule, two inept
political parties, and to top it all, no
more Sex Pistols! :God, even the
Welsh want independence! Neverthe-

less, this is the wreck Lord Caradon
wants to launch, once again, into the
troubled sea of world diplomacy.
Well, Britain may once have ruled the
waves, but in today’s world, old chap,
it takes most of our diplomatic skills
trying to prevent the Arabs from
buying boating rights on the Serpen-
tine in Hyde Park. No wonder
Michael Foot looks older. (Foot is
Deputy Leader of the Labour Party
and Leader of the House of Commons,
a real politician. :

wonders of North Sea Oil, the panacea

not concerned with the conse-
quences.’’ But let us first try to
discern what went on at these peace
talks. Mr. Sadat, in a beautifully
orchestrated move, called for talks to
settle,the conflict between his country
and Israel, Mr. Begin agreed to talk
but at no time said he would make
any further concessions, Sadat broke
off the talks ‘‘accusing the Israelis of
deliberately blocking progress,”
(Charlotte Observer, January 19,
1978.) In response an Israeli cabinet
minister said that Sadat ‘‘was under
the illusion that we would surrender
to demands that at no time were
acceptable.”’ (Observer, Jan. 19.)
Obviously, neither side is willing to
make concessions; therefore it is just
as fair to accuse the Egyptians of the
same capriciousness and obstinacy,
especially considering Sadat’s state-
ment that ‘‘Isrdel...cannot have both
peace and the Arab territories cap-
tured in the 1967 Mideast War.”’
(Observer, Jan. 21, 1978.)

On the issue of those ‘‘Arab’’

territories, this must be said. The

1967 Mideast War was not started by
the Israelis to gain Arab land, but

‘just the opposite. Throughout history

a victor in a war has been. allowed to
keep the lands it won, especially if it
had been attacked initially. To ask
the Israelis to give up their land, we
should first ask the Soviets to give up
Poland, the eastern portion of Ger-
many, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia,
etc., and also return the Columbian
territories now know as Panama and
the Canal Zone.

Mr. Abagui talks about the Zionist
movement in rather harsh terms. Let
us not forget the suffering that this
people has endured through the
centuries, culminating with the re-
gime of Hitler. It is that suffering
which prompted the founding of the

present state of Israel,
‘Zionist Movement.”’

All these statements by Mr. Aba-
gui are shocking in their fallacious-
ness, yet all would be tolerable if it
were not for his comparison of the
Jews to the Nazis. That statement
was totally uncalled for. If anything
in the Middle East situation can
prompt accusations of Nazi-like prac-
tices it is the terrorism used by the
Egyptians and *Palestinians.”’ Their
utter disregard for such as we are in
now. The Judaic idea of ‘God's
chosen race’’ has absolutely nothing

and no

to do with the master race principle of ©

earthly superiority. Mr. Abagui
should find out about this ‘‘religion
respected by the Arab majority’’
before he makes such statements.
And please remember that one princi-
ple of all Christian religions is that we
are the heirs of Judah, and therefore
are also God’s people.

Finally, Mr. Abagui attempts to
win over our sympathy for his cause
by briefly depicting the sad state of
affairs inEgypt today. If anything
this sounds like an argument for
allowing the Israelis to keep their land
for the sake of all those people living
there, Jewish and Arab alike. The
Israelis have already taken one desert
and mande it a decent place to live.

As for my own “‘slanted preju-
dices,"’ thank you Mr. Abagui for
releasing me from them. I used to be
open minded, convinced by the liberal
American press that both sides were
at fault. I will now throw my
undivided allegiance to the Israelis,
since I cannot, with a clear con-
science, side with some group that
will act so ruthlessly, as I feel you
have done in your article, to gain their
ends.
