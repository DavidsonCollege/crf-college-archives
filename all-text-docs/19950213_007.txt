Accepting responsibility

We have a problem. Members of our community throw away too many
recyclable goods. The length of time it has taken us to address this issue is
embarrassing and confounds anyone concerned with the new movement on
campus for a college funded recycling program.

Obviously, we’ ve attempted to institutionalize some sort of system that
would better handle campus waste in past efforts of small and ill funded (if at
all funded) committees, as Maria Whitehead points out in her letter to the
editors. Obviously, these committees have not and cannot handle the

‘ enormous task that should be treated as an obligation to the community.
Obviously, students are indeed aware and concerned about the issue — not
apathetic. Students have finally raised the white flag, not as a symbol of defeat
or discouragement, but as a plea for help. Obviously, change should occur.

Aluminum cans in the trash, newspapers tossed with photocopies, plastic
colliding with glass — we’ ve all seen this at least once, if not a dozen times.
We watch passively because we know. that most likely our efforts will be
fruitless as long as the administration withholds its support. How can a few
ambitious and commendable students, sorting through a shed full of waste
between their 11:30 and 12:30 classes, possibly deal with even a snippet of the.
thousands of pounds that should be taken care of? -

Last week’s petition, signed by 950 of us, reflects student demand for the
college to begin funding a program that will satisfy the legal and moral
obligations we have to the state and to ourselves.

We must think of recycling as a cooperative and everyday responsibility.
And obviously, we cannot do it by ourselves. Recycling should be handed
over to the Physical Plant, paid for, organized, and implemented by the
college.

To the editor:

Inthe past several years,
there has been growing con-
cern among the Davidson
students that ourcampus has
noestablished recycling pro-
gram. This concern has re-
sulted in nearly futile efforts
by numerous small commit-
tees (Recycling Committee,
Environmental ActionCom-
mittee, On-Campus Service
Committee) to take on the
mission single-handedly.
However, these groups find

they do not have the time, .
man-power, or money to sig-

nificantly resolve the prob-
lem at hand.

The true dilemma does
not lie in the masses of recy-
clable waste hauled weekly
from this campus but in
Davidson’s responsibility as
an educational entity and a
creator of leaders.
Davidson’s Statement of
Purpose reads: “Davidson’s
primary purpose is to de-
velop persons of humane
instincts, of disciplined and
creative minds, and of Chris-
tian character for full lives

of leadership, of service, and
of self-fulfillment.” As
tomorrow’s leaders, this
campus should have a com-
mitment to making its stu-
dents environmentally
aware, allowing them to
make immediate and future
contributions toward the sus-
tainable management of the
world’s resources through an
institutionalized recycling
program.

Along with Davidson’s
commitment to its students,

it has an obligation to the :
community. North Carolina —

has passed laws prohibiting
aluminum in landfills.
Davidson has a responsibil-
ity by law to provide, abun-
dantly, bins for aluminum
can (these bins are, however,
not available in Baker or the
senior apartments).
Davidson has a responsibil-
ity as acommunity leader to
help meet Mecklenburg

.County’s goal set in 1990 to

reduce waste by 40% as of
June 30, 2001, by providing
recycling areas for glass,
plastic, paper, aluminum,

and cardboard. But the most
important intent of a recy-
cling program remains the
opportunity it gives students
to make changes that will
better their lives and their
environment.

We do present this let-
ter humbly as we are reluc-
tant to criticize Davidson or
the administration. Para-
doxically, it was here we
gained the knowledge of a
dire need to conserve, and
here, we learned to scruti-
nize problems and? créaté
solutions. So; withthe State-
ment of Purpose, we affirm,
“in gratitude for what has
been accomplished, but in
humble recognition that it —
has not fully measured up to
its own ideals either in learn-
ing or in life, its trustees, its
faculty, its students, and its
friends must constantly re-
dedicate themselves to their
task” ... of nurturing the
whole person.

Sincerely,

Maria Whitehead

Careless captions

To the editor:

I was very disappointed
to see the caption “Sicko-
psycho half-time” attached
to the photograph by Rob
Kosicki of Gentle Douglas’s
half-time performance at a
recent basketball game (The
Davidsonian, February 6,
1995, p. 16). Gentle Dou-
glas, who is amember of our
campus staff, is,a highly
skilled, internationally

ranked athlete whose disci- °

pline and integrity have been
deservedly recognized. I
would invite everyone to
come see him work out at
the college gym, where. he
trains almost every day dur-
ing his lunchhours. To label
his performance (which was
one of the most interesting

‘professional nor informed

nor kind. Through training,
talent, and focus, profes-
sional athletes do things
which the rest of us simply
cannot do. We can grate-
fully enjoy being awed by
such efforts just as we can be
enthralled by a great lecturer,
musician, poet, ora new idea.

Intentionally or uncon-
sciously tainted with the
“isms’’of the worst kind, the
thoughtless words of the cap-
tion serve to divide and
marginalize persons and sin-
cere interests in our own
community on the very eve
of Solidarity Week. As
Michel Foucault pointed out
years ago, the presumptive
establishment of norms for
“sanity” has justified dan-
gerous extremes of both the

Perhaps this commentary,
even benighted as it was,
should have been reserved
for the quippy Lollopalooza
sidelines of these editorial
pages.

I would hope that the
anonymous commentator
would come forward and
fully apologize to Mr. Dou-
glas. He or she is missing
out on a great athlete and a
great person, not to mention
the instantaneous standing
ovation which Gentle
Douglas’s performance re-
ceived from the many stu-
dents who were fortunate
enough to have witnessed
his well-honed features and
feats.
