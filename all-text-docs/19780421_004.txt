Crucial fifteen pages

A fifteen page document was released
to the faculty last week. When passed in
its final form, that document, the pro-
posed faculty code of evaluation, shall
have a tremendous impact on Davidson.
College. For years to come, the regula-
tions in the code will determine who
teaches at Davidson, how they shall be
judged, and how long they will stay. The
power that the document carries will cause
some apprehension, but the recent dis-
missal of Dr. Devon painfully illustrated
the critical need for such a document.

When policy is established, there is
sometimes a tendency to rush into the
new procedures without examining the full
implications. Such an incident must not
happen with this code.

Recent events surrounding the ouster of
Dr. Devon have caused apprehension
among some members of the younger
faculty. Charges of “intimidation” have
been made against the administration. A
truly outstanding faculty simply cannot be
built under an aura of intimidation. Thus,
it is imperative that these young profes-
sors be satisfied with the document.

Only the senior members of the faculty
can insure that satisfaction. Unfortunate-
ly, confidence in the senior faculty is at a
low ebb, also. Where were the professors
when Dr. Devon was dismissed? Why did
not the professors offer some suggestions
to Dr. Zimmermann when he was writing
the code? Many professors are prone to
complain about the apathy of students.
But why cannot these same professors
show some concern about events that
affect their colleagues?

Perhaps an apathetic faculty could be
tolerated. However, a hypocritical faculty
does not deserve toleration. It can only be
hoped that the faculty will show a real
interest in the code by carefully scrutini-
zing every sentence, at least for the benefit
of the younger professors and the stu-
dents who study under them.

No one expects such a lengthy document
to be: perfect. Everyone will have a
different opinion. But several portions of
the proposed code deserve close consi-
deration by the entire college community
before approval:

First, there is a continuing problem
concerning Christian commitment. David-
son College went through a painful
experience last year with the Linden Affair.
It seems, from reading the draft copy of
the code, that the experience has been
forgotten.

According to the proposed code, a
person must, before becoming a faculty
member here, accept Davidson’s State-
ment of Purpose which “recognizes God
as the source of all truth” and “sees Jesus
Christ as the central fact of history, giving
purpose, order and value to the whole
life.”

The College is holding up a clear sign
that discourages non-Christians from
seeking appointment here. At the boycott

last spring, Visiting Professor Pat Ed-

mondson said something that is still

. applicable: “It is my understanding that
the way the Lord works through his
community is by drawing people to him
through the power of this love and not by
drawing lines around and saying ‘We don’t
let people in who are not already followers
of Christ before they come in.’ ”

Davidson cannot profess to be a truly
liberal arts college if it closes its doors to
those of non-Western and non-traditional
views.

The second major problem concerns the
Status of untenured faculty members.
These faculty members are excluded from
the process of hiring new professors.
According to the proposed code, “The~
candidate will be interviewed by the

tenured members of the appropriate
department or departments as well as the -
department chairman, the (Vice-President
for Academic Affairs), and the President.”

No mention is made of an active role for
untenured faculty members in evaluation.
If the College has hired someone, regard-
less of whether tenure has been achieved,
should not they be competent enough to
have a voice in the workings of their
department?

_ Surely, the professors do not magically
become competent af the minute tenure is
granted. By denying these newer profes-
sors the opportunity to participate fully in
the building of the Colleae faculty, the
code stifles the new perspectives and
innovative ideas the new faculty bring with
them. This is a strange way indeed of
gaining the irust of the untenured faculty.

The third area of concern regards the
fifth. criterion for faculty evaluation: “the
capacity to exemplify by personal witness
the intellectual and moral values for which
the College stands.”

“Witness is a strong word, stonger
than “accept” or even “support.” And who
determines what are the “intellectual and
moral values” of the College? Judging an
individual’s ethical and moral values is a
trememdous responsibility. Those who sit
in judgment must not be dogmatic in
dictating our Community’s ethical stan-_
dards: a liberal arts college thrives on a
diversity in its beliefs.

« Another clause that has aroused much
concern is the criterion demanding “sup-
port’ of established faculty policies.” Must
a faculty member conform to every policy
in order to keep his position secure? If
established faculty policies are wrong or
outdated, what vehicle is there for
change?

Obviously the complexity of the faculty
evaluation process makes it impossible to
come up with a perfectly objective
Statement. The responsibility for having a
meaningful code rests with the entire

| college community. We challenge each
segment of the community to assume that

responsibility.

Premeds get shaft
on MCAT test site

To the Editor:

On April 15, 80 Premedical
students from Davidson and
surrounding colleges were forc-
ed to take the Medical College
Admissions Test, a long, diffi-
cult eight-hour test of critical
importance to medical school
applicants, on miniscule desks
in a crowded lecture room in
Dana because Dr. Herb Jackson
refused to allow th test to be
taken in Room 100 of Cham-
bers. The test was scheduled to
be taken there, as always; the
official admission tickets stated
that it would be so; but,
because the Romare Bearden
exhibit was in the gallery, use of
the room was denied, despite
the premedical advisor’s objec-

tions. The exhibit could have
been moved aside temporarily;
it was not. The gallery was
locked during the examination
period. .
This is not the first time Dr.
Jackson has asserted this type
of authority over the gallery. It
was funded and built with the
intention that it would be a
multi-purpose facility; but it is
not used thus. Although exhi-
bits such as Bearden’s are
undoubtedly of importance,
Davidson must ask itself whe-
ther it values more its academic
reputation, or its cultural sta-
tus.

Letter to the Editor

Peeples criticized

To the Editor:

I did not like Bill Peeple’s
treatment of the ROTC Depart-
ment last week. To say that the
slant of your column was se-
vere, that you were at times
misinformed, or that your criti-
cisms are threadbare under-
states the issue.

What irks me is that, under
the guise of writing an unbiased
features article on the depart-
ment, you interviewed its mem-
bers, whose opinions were given
with this in mind, then turned
their comments against them in
a naive, if unkind, way.

Deception is poor journalism.

Criticism where it is not due
in unwise.

May I now set some issues
straight. Military officers, I am
told, are always addressed by
their titles. Captain, Colonel,
whatever. Never do they go by
‘‘professor.’’ Could someone
you interviewed have pulled
your leg? Or was it pulled from
the air?

Another point:. The ROTC
Department is not unique in its
policy of saluting only when in
uniform. This is Army, not
Davidson policy.

If mentioning this was an
attempt to show that Davidson
ROTC is deviant or slack in its

more convincing.

Relating ROTC’s goal of ad-
venture to Boy Scout recruiting
posters will convince me no
better. In fact, having been a
Scout, it rather annoys me. The
Scouts are one of the few
exceptionally fine groups a-
round. It provides adventure
for those who would otherwise
not get the chance. In any case
I think Scouts neither need nor
deserve your criticism.

Finally, Bill, I am surprised
at your pessimism. If someone
joins ROTC with the ambition
of getting to the moon, he or she
should be commended, not ridi-
culed. There is no reason to
think that with determination
(which Davidson students are
known for) this individual will
not get there.

Our age fosters these dreams.
That we will see projects like
colonization of the moon come
to pass will be more due to the
optimism and determination of
this ‘‘dreamer’’ than to your
impotent gripes.

It seems that that personwith
that goal in mind took a logical
step by joining ROTC in fulfill-
ing that goal. Does this make
ROTC a joke? I think not.
