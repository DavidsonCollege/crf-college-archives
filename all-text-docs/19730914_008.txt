The team dropped two games

Injuries plagued the Cats as
David Kitrell strained liga-
ments in his knee,hip and thigh;
Sam Upchurch caught an elbow
in the face that caused a two-
stitch cut. The most serious in-
jury to a Davidson player was
sustained by freshman John
Rhyne who broke his hand. A
Clemson player broke his leg in
the contest as well.

In commenting about the
game, Kitrell said that, ‘“‘The
only reason that we lost was
that we were out of shape.
Clemson had been working out
for a while and with a little
more conditioning we would
have been able to beat them.”

The Rugby team, although
only a club sport in its official
status, has become an in-
creasingly popular pastime on
the campus in the past several

years.

Sam Upchurch, “The team has
never lost a keg party after the

The annual freshman Cake
Race has returned to Davidson
after a year lay-off and its rein-
stitution brought a refreshing
light on Davidson.

The cake race, instituted by
retired track coach Heath Whit-
tle in an attempt to discover
hidden cross-country talent,
was run on the afternoon of
Sept. 3 as part of the 1973 orien-
tation program. Although Whit-

tle was present, present head
track coach Sterling Martin

was the man in charge.

self, which spreads over a 1.6
mile area ing David-

allowed them to set the ball
up against either a man-to-man
or zone defense. Their op-
position was usually more ex-
perienced and older than the
Wildcats. Thus Holland felt they
learned to handle themselves
better under different cir-
cumstances.

“I thought that we were par-
ticularly good in learning to
move without the ball on of-
fense.'’ Holland commented.

Defensively the Cats em-
ployed mainly a man-to-man
full court press. It was very suc-
cessful in helping to break open
several of the ball games and

run the scores up.
The Davidson squad .
averaged 99.2 points per contest

during the 20-game slate. Nine
times they scored 100 or more
points in a game. Their high
total came against Mors Vale
when the final tally was 133-75.

Greg Dunn paced the Cats in
scoring as he hit on 166 of 258
shots from the field for a 19.1
average and a shooting per-
centage of 64.3.

“Dunn was exceptional of-
fensively for us,’’ praised
Holland. ‘‘He went to the basket
and really put in the points.”’.

Four other players finished
the tour in double figures for
Davidson. The second high
scorer was guard John Falconi
who in 14.1 points per
game. Forward T. Jay Pecorak
a senior, hit at a 12.6 clip, while
Paul Wagner and Sheldon
Parker averaged 10 points per
game.

hauled down 161 rebounds for
an8.1 average.

It should be noted that
throughout the majority of the
tour the Cats played a five-
on,five off style of substitution.
Holland ined that the five
starters would play for the
opening five minutes of a game
and then the five substitutes
would play the next five
minutes. This would
continue throughout the game.

Then the teams would be
alternated and shufled for for the
next game. This was done so
that the coaches could see
everyone for an extensive
amount of time under actual
game conditions.

“We thought the trip was
aiso successful in this respect,’’
commented the fifth year men-
tor. ‘We got to see all of our 10
boys more than we would have

The Cats finished with a 17-3
mark for the tour. Holland
would no doubt be quite pleased
if they come up with a similar
