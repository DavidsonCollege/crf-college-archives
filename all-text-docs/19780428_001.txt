Code of evaluation receives criticism

By CAROLE LOPSTON
and LYNN PEACE
Staff Writers

The Professional Affairs Committee,
(PAC), chaired by Professor of Physics
Alan A. Wolf, held a meeting Tuesday
to solicit faculty opinions on the code of
evaluation. Approximately half the
faculty attended.

“The most encouraging aspect was
the widespread interest on the part of
the faculty on this matter,’’ said
Professor of Philosophy Robert May-
dole.

‘‘A lot of people expressed their
opinions. The opinions were well
thought out, not merely surface opin-
ions, but that got to the root of
things,”’ he added. ee

“A lot of people said they felt it was
a very fruitful meeting,”’
Wolf. ‘‘The general feeling was one of
optimism.”’ he concluded.

About half of the fourteen-page
document came under discussion dur-
ing the two hour meeting, according to
Wolf. The material discussed included

(Pp

the code’s preamble, the sex criteria for
faculty evaluation, and the roles of
faculty, students, and administration
in the evaluation procedure.

A second meeting of the PAC and
the faculty concerning the code will be
held next Tuesday.

Vice President for Academic Affairs
T.C. Price Zimmermann attended the
meeting and described his role as ‘‘a
guest, there to listen and reflect on
what the faculty had to say.”

Both Zimmermann and Wolf report-
ed many calls for clarification of certain
phrases in the document and the
presentation of many different faculty
viewpoints. __
~ According to Zimmermann and Wolf
there was ‘‘a great deal” of interest in
the extent to which ‘‘Christian charact-
er’’ as expressed in the Statement of
Purpose is to be emphasized. wa
, According to Zimmerman, somebody
who has Christian commitment ‘‘ac-
cepts Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour
and tries to follow the precepts of the
Christian religion in his life.”’

Faculty were also concerned about

‘the extent to which this squares with

the College’s stated intent to hire non-
Christians,’’ said Wolf.

The Christian emphasis of the docu-
ment as a whole is ‘‘too heavy,”’
expressed Biology Department Chair-
man Donald Kimmel.

“If they were to state it once or twice
and then a little here and there it would
be O.K. And then drop it. We’ve
wrestled for years.on what Christian
commitment at a‘Christian college
means. It’s gotten us into very hot
water,’’ he explained.

Maydole said that he felt ‘‘the
document represents a step backward
on the Christian tenure issue. It’s one
more statement that makes us sound
defensive about being Christian,’’ he
said. .

One faculty member described the
code as an offensive document to those
outside the college community.

“It doesn’t help in recruiting faculty,
he said. ‘‘It might be too Bob
Jonesish.”’

Kimmel searched for a word to
describe the tone of the code. ‘‘Patern:
listic, maybe,”’ he said. ‘‘So many ot
our pronouncements are not just easy,
confident language.”

“There’s insecurity inherent in it.
We're not at all sure what we’re about.
It comes out in this document,’’ he
concluded.

Maydole said, ‘‘One gets understan-
dably nervous reading one phrase after
another of this flavor. There’s no
attempt to encourage free speech, no
mention of academic freedom. It’s
conspicuous by it’s abscence.

“T like the idea of having a rationale
for making decisions, but it should be
one that encourages and protects
academic freedom and diversity.”’

Another major topic of the meeting
concerned the proposed student evalu-
ation forms. Faculty members propos-
ed different forms with regard to
different class formats and different
departments, said Wolf.

# After months of planning

Departments report changes

By EMILY PARTIN
Staff Writer

The faculty adopted a propo-
sal to abolish the 301 and 401
Extended Studies based on a
recommendation by the Educa-
tional Policy Committee (EPC)
late last year.

According to EPC member
Harris Proctor, the committee
had been aware of mixed feel-
ings and dissatisfaction on the
part of some faculty and stu-
dents concerning the present
301/401 system.

Each department was asked
to design a substitute program
in the place of the 301 and 401
courses, said Richard C. Burts,
Jr., Registrar.

In the Biology department,
“the same things will be going
on, just under different num-
bers,’ said dept. chairman Don
Kimmel.

The Chemistry
will offer 8 ‘‘Indepe

similar to those for 301 and 401,
but these new courses will not
be required of majors.

The Psychology department
has renamed Psychology 301
“Practicum for Majors.’’ The
course will essentially be similar
to the former 301, the major
difference being that it is not
required, according to Psycho-
logy department Chairman
John Kelton. The 401 course

has been retained.

The Physics department has
changed its 301 to ‘‘Laboratory
for Juniors’ and 401 to “Senior
Project.”

Premedicine 301 has now
become 295 ‘‘Premedicine for
Juniors’”’ and 401 is now 297
‘‘Premedicine for Seniors.”’
These courses will allow the
student to pursue an interest in
a field other than Biology,
Chemistry, and Physics, provi-
ded it is related to premedicine,
according to Department Chair
man James Frederickson.

English 301 and 401 have

nations, but instead of one three
hour exam there will be three
one and a half hour exams. 399
will also cover techniques of
literary study and the 499 exam

will involve the study of a
literary genre.
Music 301 and 401 will be

similar to the previous 301
requirements.

The Art History section has
elected to retain the same 301
and 401 courses.

Art Studio 301 and 401 have
been renamed 302 and 402. In
describing these courses, Profe-
ssor of Art Doug Houchens
said, ‘‘In general, this is the
same policy we have followed.
This is a firmer reshaping of it.”

Many departments are doing
away with 301’s and 401’s
substituting one course in their
place. According to Professor of
Economics Charles Ratliff, de-
partment chairman, 395 ‘‘Sen-
ior Session”’ will be required of
ill senior majors, instead of 301

studio Wednesday to await their first high power broadcast.

At 6:33 p.m., after receiving
a signal from Engineer Paul
Sealy, WDAV Classical Music
Programmer Frances Wilson
shouted, ‘‘That’s it. We’re on.”

She twisted a red knob and
flipped a black switch on their
control panel to send Handel’s
Hallelujah Chorus —specifically
chosen for the occasion—as far
as Winston-Salem and Spartan-
burg.

Although originally sche-
duled to begin full 18-hour
programming next Monday,
WDAV will. continue to broad-
cast only a short while each day
for at least two more weeks.

The delay can be attributed
to slow equipment delivery and
minor foul-ups, according to
General Manager Carrington
Thompson. He shrugged it off
as being nothing to worry
about.

Director of College Communi-
cations Martha Roberts joked

WDAV's new high-power signal is supposed to reach an 80-mile

that the only ‘‘major problem”
faced so far by WDAV in its
move to 18,540 watt transmis-
sion, 89.9 on your dial, is that
a mouse got into the transmit-
ter shack and gnawed on the
insulation.

* Despite her levity however,
several radio station staff mem-
bers seem anxious, almost
scared, about suddenly having
to confront a possible audience
of 2,000,000 people.

“T think it was a lot more fun
at 10 watts because it wasn’t so
serious. It'll be less fun now.
I’m concerned a little bit,’’
confided one active student who
declined to be mentioned by
name.

One disc jockey, freshman
Bruce Lipsitz, admitted that he
was much more comfortable
when WDAYV was ‘“‘just one
step above the walky-talky’’
stage. ‘‘I don’t feel that they've
