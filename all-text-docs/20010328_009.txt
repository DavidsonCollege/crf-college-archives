Over this past Spring Break, the Davidson
College Concert Choir and Chamber Singers
went on tour to Orlando, Florida. The choirs
performed at Eastminister Presbyterian
Church in Columbia, SC, the Trinity Prepara-
tory School in Orlando, the Bolles School in
Jacksonville, Peachtree Presbyterian Church
in Atlanta, and finally the Fourth Presbyte-
rian Church in Greenville, SC. In between
the performances was a two-day break in
Orlando to enjoy the city’s many attractions.

Along the way, the choir members stayed
with host families, many of whom attended
Davidson. All of the members found it inter-
esting to share experiences with the alumni
and discuss the school “then and now.”

Mark Murray ‘04 and Jeff Fox ‘04 stayed
with a former choir member for their home-
stay in Atlanta. “We were tired and wanted to
go to bed, but he just wanted to stay up and
talk,” Mark said. “He was so excited.” Many
alumni from the areas in which the choirs
sang attended the performances, and they
thotoughly enjoyed the music performed.
Every choir member received at least one
compliment on a “job well done” from an
alum.

The most enriching
experience of the tour,
however, was getting to
spend time with fellow
choir members. Accord-
ing to Jonathan Schellack
‘04, “I enjoyed getting
to know people I did not
know and people I al-
ready knew.”

Jonathan’s .statement
displays the primary pur-
pose of a tour. While
concerts and attractions
are part of any tour, the
things that people will
remember are the new
friendships made and the
existing friendships cul-
tivated. Being on the
same trip and sharing the
same experiences will
inevitably bring a group
closer, and this tour.was
noexception. The mem-
bers of the tour group
make the tour the experi-
ence that it is.
