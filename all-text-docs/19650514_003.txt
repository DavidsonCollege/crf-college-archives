Turner Tours Europe,
Finds ‘Second Heaven’

By CHARLES TURNER

When I began to think of
the many experiences we
had during our travels, it is
hard to decide what I should
write about. To describe all
of the adventures could
easily develop into a book,
and yet I wonder what you
would find to be most in-
teresting.

I suppose 1 could start off by
telling about the theft of our
passports, travelers checks, etc.,
while we were in Vienna. In-
cluded in this report would be
the detective in the police office
who smiled and told us that’
such thefts happen regularly
during the tourist season and
that there was very little he
could do for us. Fortunately the
U. S. Consulate issued us temp-
orary Passports to replace those
stolen,

Maybe your
readers would
be more inter-
ested in a de-
scription of
Larik Abdul-
lah,, an Iraqi
boy whom we
met in Vienna,
and with
whom we
traveled from Vienna to Istan-
bul. He had boxed in the
1660 Olympics in Rome, winning
there a silver medal and meet-
ing Archie Moore, whose friend-
ship he treasured more than the
silver medal he won. His many
anties and his high spirits made

\—

our stay in Vienna pleasurable.

despite the mishap with our
passports and travelers checks.

Perhaps I should also tell
about a boy we met in Buda-
pest, Hungary, who walked up
to us on the street and asked if
we had any western magazines
or newspapers. After we gave
him a copy of Time, he showed
us to a cheap hotel, of which
there are few and far between
in Hungary, and also gave us
a good tour of the city.

He wants to visit Germany this
summer. but can only bring the
equivalent of five dollars out of
Hungary. J am now in the pro-
cess of finding him a job in
Marburg so that he will be able
to make the trip.

The most enjoyable part of
the trip was Greece, mainly be-
cause it was the first country
we came to after Turkey. Ath-
ens is beautiful and not too ex-
pensive, and therefore is the
gathering place of all sun-lov-
ing, Europe-touring Americans.
We met five other Marburg-
Davidson gentlemen while drink-
ing coffee on Constitution Square
in front of the American ‘Ex-
press office.

Tiff Harrington and Bunky
Blalock gave us the idea of vis-
iting Meghonos Island, where
we spent a week reading and
lying in the sun.

On the island we met a paint-
er who hails from Biloxi, Miss.,
arid who has lived on the island
for seven years. The main town
is very clean, the people are

friendly (and somewhat tourist-
minded), and rooms .with run-
ning water can be found for fifty
tents a night. Heaven? I thought
that Meghonos runs a close sec-
ond,

How about Italy next? In
Rome there is too much-to see,
One must stay there for at least
a month to do it half-way jus-
tice. However, giving the Colis-
seum, Pantheon and Forum all
due credit, I found the cata-
combs to be the most interest-
ing sight. They are a netivork
of tunnels under the city which
were. used mainly as the ceme-
teries for the early Christians
and as places of worship.

For the artists on our campus,
Florence would be the main
place of interest. (I do not mean
to exclude Michelangelo’s work
in Rome, especially the ceiling
of the Sistine Chapel, where one
needs binoculars to assure him-
self that the Daniel is really
painted and -not sculptured.)

The Uffizi Gallery, the Pala-
tine Palace and the National
Museum of the Bargelio, to
name a few, show many works
by Botticelli, Titian, Raphael,
Rubens, Bellini and da Vinci,
as well as works of Michelangelo
and many others.

After leaving Florence, we
spent four or five days travel-
ing through Switzerland on the
way back ‘to Marburg, during
which time we relaxed from
the trip and tried to prepare our-
selves to meet another semester
at the University.

To squeeze nine months
of life in Europe, particu-
larly in Germany, into a
short space is a physical im-
possibility. I have pondered
at length concerning what
would interest most the Da-
vidson students about our
year:

Would it be descriptions of the
untold number of people we
have met and of the places we
have seen that present history
alive and unforgettable?

Would it be excerpts of the
political discussions we have
fad with students in regard to
America, its position as world
leader, and more specifically its
position in South Vietnam?

Or would it be explanations of
the varjous customs and habits
of the German people? Howev-
er, all of this is available in
newspaper or magazine articles
written by men much more
versed than I, and in a manner
exceedingly more. interesting
Ahan mine.

Thus I have decided to brief:
ly explain what this year has
meant to me
personally.
Simply Stated,
1 have discov-
ered “myself. I
went to Da-
vidson as most
freshmen _de-
termined to
work like hell
and get the
best grades possible. little else
mattered.

Then also as most Davidson
students! 1 ‘discovered that
grades were not the standard of
an éducation, but instead of ap-
plying myself to individual work.
I believed the school was at
fault and thus spent the whole
sophomore year doing litte but
criticizing the Davidson system.

Had I not come to Germany
this year, I probably would still
be Hloundering in that hapless
profession which enthralls so
many of our students,

Here, with so much independ-
ence that it sometimes over-
whelms you —no requirements
for attending class, no assigned
books, no tests—where one can
sleep all day if he wishes, where
one can go skiing for three
weeks if it suits his fancy, where

one can play cards and drink

time he pleases, you soon dis-
cover where your interests lie,
and whether or not you are in-
deed a student.

If you discover that you are
really stimulated by the ideas,
movements, and _ peoples
throughout the history of our
planet, as I have, you become
a new personality who will nev-
er return to the constant profit-
less criticism of an educational
system because you recognize
that your education will be the
result.of your own effort or non-
effort.

Havin g been exposed to so
many people and nations during
the course of this year. none of
us here will ever be able to dis-
interest ourselves in the prob-
lems of our paSt. present, or fu-
ture world.

To listen to two of vour best
friends, a Syrian and a German,
discuss Ulbricht’s visit to Cairo
and Germany's arms delivery to
Israel frustrates you.

There is no right or wrong:
but it also impels you to search
for an answer, not a_ solution
maybe, but at least an attempt.

little about art, then go through
the magnificent galleries of Eu-
rope and marvel. at the shadings
of DaVinci, the colors of Cara
vaggo and El Greco, the mas-
culinity .of Michelangelo, the
tones of Bellini.

You can't help but want to
learn more. To be totally ig
norant of opera, then to see and
hear Rossini’s “Barber of Se-
ville,” Verdi's ‘Don Carlos,”
Beethoven's ‘‘Fidelio’’ makes
you aware of all the time you
have wasted, but will no more,
thinking opera was “square.”

To meet a janitress in Prague
who speaks six languages makes
you ashamed of your shoddy
language of two. but helps in
your determination to learn
more.

1 and the other students here
will come home looking and

speaking similar to before our

departure. but inside there will
be something new that will nev-
er be extinguished, a fire that
possibly would never have been
ignited had we not been a part
of the European community for
this past year.

European Study ‘Lights Fire’

‘Living Into’ German
Highlights Taylor’s Stay

By HANK TAYLOR

If I am queried as to what
I consider the greatest sin-
gle aspect of this Junior
Year in Germany, I have an
immediate answer — the
learning of the language.

It should quickly become
clear to you that I am referring
to-a learning process which is
quite different. from anything
you would be able to experience
by learning a language at home.

A German word for this proc-
ess could be translated as ‘‘liv-
ing into’ the language. It means’
a really thorough acquaintance,
based on constant seeing, hear-
ing. using, and feeling of the
language.

It means, especially at first,
a great deal of mental disci-
pline, forcing oneself not only to
speak but also to think in Ger-
man. It also means plenty of
downright hard work. But it is
‘a process as rich, exciting and
rewarding in itself as in its re-
sults.

How could T ever explain, for

example, the enthusiasm one

. .. One's delight in speaking
to fellow students in colloquial-
isms which hvae always before
been a stumbling block and
which his texts didn't even
bother to translate, but merely
approximated in a footnote.

. One's satisfaction in

learning the rhythm of the Jan-
guage and many other techni-
calities for which there are no
rules, but only a feeling.

_. .. And, perhaps above all,
the pride one feels after speak-
ing with a German and being
asked what part of Germany
one comes from; the éxclama-
tion of surprise or even the gap-
‘ing stare when ‘he hears that
you're an American.

Here 1 would mention that
you do your country consider-
able service in
Amiericans, partly at least for-
good reasons (we aren’t thrown
daily with other languages as
Europeans are), have the evil
reputation among many , Euro-
peans of never learning a for-
cign language or having the least
interest in doing so. Your coun-
‘{er-example will delight. the Eu-
Topean and edify the ‘‘Ameri-

More than anything else, a
foreign language is an opener
of doors. It is your introduction
to. another culture to an extent
and in a fashion’ which the best
translator can not equal.

Ability in the native language
is your door to another people,
to how they live, and to how and
what they think and believe. It
can create for you opportunities
to observe and to actually live.
their way of life to an extent
which the. tourist never dreams
possible.

It appears to me that. the very
learning of a language has ipso

facto a broadening effect. It

seems to me to function some-
thing like this:
Anyone who has studied even

the bargain.”

most other languages, has a
rather rigid and complicated
pattern which determines the or-
der in which a sentence is to be
constructed.

Americans ‘usually have . fit

with it, because they're. used to
throwing in words and clauses
as the spitit moves them. It is
impossible to conquer this diffi-
‘culty without learning to men-
tally approach a sentence as a
German does.

Another example: Learning
German language, or any Jan-
guage, is much more than Jearn-
ing the expressions which trans-
late literally from one speech to
the other. Especially in the
realm of idiomatic expressions,
where the ‘bulk of the material.
has no. direct English equiva-
lent, one must get. out of his old
accustomed ways of expressing
himself and of comprehending.

To change frequency and end
on a-very practical note, I would
like to mention that a second
Jangague is a tremendous help
to one here when he travels, and
almost regardless of where ‘he
travels. :

1 was quite amazed by the
number of people in Greece and
Italy who spoke German, and
not only in the highly educated
groups. A great number of ev-
eryday working people have Jiv-

ers, taking advantage of ‘high >
German wages and good Ger-
man beer.

Davidson’s Critics Draw Criticism From New Critics

Morrisett

Dear Editor:

Since last September I have
followed with keen interest the
rather eventful year. at David-
son. If one word describes the
year there it must be ‘‘re-eval-
uation."

Early last fall it was the ath-
letic program. Later it was the
fraternity situation. Then an-
other rehash of the faculty path.
And now again you are taking a
look at the drinking rule.

I think it is commendable that
the Davidson student body cares
enough to continually re-evalu-
ate its situation, as long as this
re-evaluation is constructive and
directed toward self-improve-
ment.

But as I read each edition of
THE DAVIDSONIAN. it be-
comes very clear to me that in
several instances, much of what
is said and done by the David-
son student as a reaction to a
certain existing situation is not

constructive. In fact much of
the criticism has been extreme-
ly harsh, biting, and destruc-
tive. I consider articles by Mr.
Smith, Mr. Clark, and Mr. Car-
son as notable examples.

It is not so, much the criticism
itself which is unhealthy, but
rather the tone in which it is
voiced. It is often sarcastic and
not infrequently cynical. I do not
wish to imply that this tone sud-
denly raised its ugly head this
year. It has been slowly scratch-
ing at the surface, sucking the
very goodness from and sapping
the strength of the student-fac-
ulty relationship.

If we were as quick to praise
as we are to criticize, not only
would the number of problems
diminish, but their solutions
could be found more rapidly.

We get so involved in the in-
tricacies of a problem that we
often lose a great deal of the
perspective which is so desper-
ately needed for securing a suit-
able answer. It appears that, to

a certain extent, such was the
case with the social life ques-
tion.

But the trustees have come to
the aid of both the independent
and the fraternity member. It
is they, along with several fac-
ulty members, who have lent
stability and perspective to the
situation. In addition, they have
revoked the shackling faculty
oath.

Yes, the fraternities will have
more pledge classes. You wilt
have a football team next year.
The library wilt get more books
from the increased budget. And
the college will get some more
great minds who wouldn't have
come because of the oath.

With all this, I think it is
gross ingratitude if you cry for
more liberal rules so that drink-
ing on campus is not unlawful,
taking a girl into the dormitory
is not against regulations, or
attending vespers or chapel is
not compulsory. Rules and regu-
lations at one institution are not
necessarily applicable at an-
plicable at another (e.g. Dart-
mouth).

Personally, I think you owe
the trustees and several mem-
bers of the faculty, particularly
Dr. McGavock, a debt of grati-
tude for all they have done for
you during the past year.

Whenever you engage in con-
versation with graduate students
here, invariably the conversa-
tion turns to “Where did you
do your undergraduate study?"
When you answer ‘Davidson’,
you get an assortment of replies
like “Oh, I wish I had gone
there,” or “They really turn out
a scholar there.” It didn't take
many comments like these to
develop an immense pride in my
Alma Mater.

So to you, the Davidson man,
I would say this. Be quick to
praise and slow to prick your
school. You have good reason to
be proud of it.

Dear Editor:

It is a fact of life that the pre-

patient with many existing cus-
toms and institutions; needless
to say. the world is much bet-

hope that the present Davidson
Student body will continue to be
impatient.

We must realize, however,
that we are not the first young
people who have felt so sup-
pressed by existing conditions,

Let us not, however, lose sight
of the great progress made in
the last few years. To cite a few
figures from a Davidsonian edi-

91 since President Martin was
inagurated in 1959, the faculty
salaries rising from an average
of $6,608 with $874 fringe bene-

fringe benefits of $1,478.

For the first time I am view-

and I have had some difficulty
defining a main issue on which I
could formulate and pinpoint my
opinions, given my own fratern-
ity-social experience at David-
son. I think Mr. Harrington has
provided the most substance
with which I can associate.

As a fraternity member, my
social experience at Davidson

too enjoyable). However, for all
the benefits I reaped, I could

“nothing more than the individ-

something else.

1 do feel that the voice which
raised the issue has a legitimate
plea. These non-fraternity men
have had their opportunity for
the widest social participation
withdrawn in their first week at
Davidson. I also feel that the
“mysterious fog coming from
Patterson Court or the Union”
does exist as an aggregate soc-
ial problem created by the fra-
ternity system as a whole when
it incorporates a freshman in
its socially secure ranks.

The result is two camps: one
with social outlets, the other
only individual initiative. One
has, the other has not. The
grounds for discrimination are
ready-made. And yet, most fra-
ternity men are less attached to
their fraternities than the cur-
rent outrage of their defense

This is all well and good for
this purpose, but I do not feel
that the fraternity men truly
fear for their fraternities ex-
cept as a means of fulfilling a
social necessity and maintain-
ing their status on campus.

The thought that returns to
me time and again is that be-
yond the social superiority pro-
vided by the fraternity system,
most students couldn't care less.
However, this social superiority
pervades student conduct, and
the lack of other issues for com-
mon ground on which both
*‘camps’’ might meet more con-
genially and even socially is,
in my view, the overriding dif-
ficulty. Uninterested students,
faced with the crisis which af-
fects their only moving interest
at Davidson, finally take arms.

The issue is real and the out-
come looms large in the future,
but I most agree with Harring-

ton's argument that too much
energy is being channeled into

a trite issue by college students

who should be interested in larg-
er issues for their movements.

the whole I cannot feel that most
students are interested.

I cannot be sure if the fault
lies with Davidson College as
a sounding board for the larger
current ‘‘crucial national and jn-
ternational issues’ or if the in-
dividual students lack the inter-
est. as a result of being in a
community dedicated to prepar-
ing them for future involvement.
But more stimulation must be
provided from somewhere, and
I feel the college is the logical
source to generate more inter-
est in current issues.

My call would be for more
central coordination of all the
students: social activities, Jeave
the fraternities as they are and
give the students more grounds
on which to respect each other

and remove a student's social

I am in full agreement with
Michael Harrington's hope that
the six month ‘‘experiment’’ in

student involvement in what I
recognize as a very real issue

can blossom into a closer as-
sociation by all students with
more important issues.
