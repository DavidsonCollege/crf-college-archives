President John Kuykendall
outlined his suggestions to the
council Monday night, and he
hopes to conclude discussion
and action on these matters at
a call meeting next Monday
in order to get any possible
amendments in motion. These
amendments would then go to
the student body for final con-

need.)

Once upon a time, there was
a young girl student named
Cinderella Gummidge. Cinderel-
la was a student at Miss Pink-
ham's Select Academy for
Young Females, located in Car-
olina’s beautiful and spacious
Swamp and Bog Belt.

Cinderella wanted to attend
a dance at Davidson, where
her sweetheart, Clyde Whif-
fle, was enrolied. Insurmount-
able difficulties seemed to
lie in her way, but having
read in the “Queen City
Clarion” the advice given to
“those with problems” by a
Miss Eden Blight, she sent
the following letter, hoping
to find an answer. Here is
the letter and the reply:

Dear Miss Blight,

I have a problem. I want
to go to Davidson for a dance,
The wicked old dean of my cal-
lege has gotten all my profes-
sors to give me a lot of home:
work to keep me too busy to

go. Also, I can’t find a ride..

Please help me, cause if I don’t
go, my sweetie, Clyde. is liable
to shaft me.

CRUSHED BY FATE

Dear Crushed By Fate,

Honey, you sure do have
a problem. Anybody who
wants to go to Davidson for
anything has a problem. See
a psychiatrist.

“Rats,” said Cinderella
when she saw the answer,
“this isn’t any help.” So she

Kingston Trio Tickets

Go On Sale Monday

Tickets for the Kingston Trio concert will go on
sale to the student body Monday in the Union. The con-

cert will be held in Chambers Auditorium at 7:30, March

3.
Ticket sales witl be opened
to the general public Thurs-
* day with several distribution
points in Charlotte. The IFC
advises that afl interested
students purchase their tick-
ets before sales are opened
to the public.

The advanced price for the
tickets is $1.50 on the Davidson
campus and $1.75 in Charlotte
and at the door.

The IFC plans to send Iet-
ters to schools in this area and
will also publicize the concert
through both radio stations and
the newspapers.

President Anderson also
geve a progress report on
plens for Greek Week, thus
opening a lively discussion
among the IFC representa-
tives. The IFC is split into
two main groups regarding
thelr role in Greek Week,
one favoring tight regulation
of fraternity activities, the
other opposed to any regule-
tion which might be inter-
preted by the fraternities as
dictatorial.

Anderson’s report was based
on a meeting with the pledge
trainers of all fraternities. This
group recommended emphasis
on a competitive Field Day to
be held between the pledge

classes, and a dfscontinuation
of the traditional Skit Night.

In the IFC meeting, however,
the faction opposed to close
regulation and IFC _ participa-
tion opposed even the Field.
Day idea. When asked by Presi-'
dent Anderson for positive sug-.
gestions regarding a Greek
Week program the representa-!
tives had none which prompted.
Anderson to remind them that|
“in this, the first Greek Week,
we have a great responsibility:
to make it a suceess. The IFC;
has the ball now and if we fum-
ble it, we may lose control of
Greek Week to the faculty or
lose Greek Week entirely.”

preoccupied with whether eight
Negro school kids are going
to go to school or not. That's
what they are concerned with
— whether a Negro kid will go
to public school or not!”

The cause of this situation
is industrialization, Golden
said, “What did it was his-
tory. History did it. Cog-
wheels. Industrialization. if
you want to blame anyone,
1 think it would be Buck
Duke. The day Mr. Duke
built the first dam on the
Catawba River, he sounded
the death knell of segrega-
tion. 1t could exist only in
an agrarian civilization,
which is gone.”

The result of this industriali-

resistance to integration was “a
matter of myth, legend, and se-,
manties. ‘Equality’ they !
take this in & way that can't
ever happen. There’s no such
things as equality. What there
js is acceptance of man.” |

Intermarriage of the races
would be no problem, he stated. |
“The rate of intermarriage has
been extremely low. Marriage
is a gamble anyway and a dif-

the South must choose “‘be-
tween the memory of the past
and the reality of the cog-
. . We must address
ourselves to the question
whether we will permit twenty-
percent of the population to
enter the industrial age of the
twentieth century, or to keep
them in the agricultural age
of the nineteenth century.”

In the end, Golden stated,
the Negro “will be very lone-
ly. He will lose all of his

“In any mixed marriage both,

As to his own plans for the
