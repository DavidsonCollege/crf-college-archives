Phi Mu Alpha will sponsor Davidson’s first All Musie Day

banquet. Members of Phi Mu hope
it will become an annual affair.

Slotted on the evening’s program
will be a performance by each or-
ganization attending. These will
include a clarinet quartet, several
skits and numbers by the talented
Queens- Davidson Madrigal sing-
ers. This latter group practiced
popular songs of the 16th Century
on its members’ spare time, and
gave recitals in Charlotte during
the past season.

New officers recently named
for next year are Charlie Ro-
per, president; Allen Garrison,

vice-president; Bill Crymes,
secretary and Morgan Bailey,
treasurer.

Long-playing records amounting
in worth to $25 were bought by
the sinfonians for Davidson’s mu-
sic library. The records were dedi-
cated to the memory of college men
killed in World War I.

Answering recent editorial
comment in this paper regard-
ing a chapel trio, retiring presi-
dent Al Neuman commented
“I don’t think chapel was the
place for the trio. Music of
that sort was written primarily
for the enjoyment of the play-
ers rather than the audience.
It should have been played in
the evening.” He believes Phi
Mu will take steps in the fu-
ture to see that the programs
are better coordinated.

Phi Mu Alpha has:as its purpose
to advance the cause of music on
the college campus and in the na-
tion at large.

fers membership upon those who
show their love for music as their
profession, or who work to ad-
vance the cause of music.

Commonly called Sinfonia, Phi
Mu Alpha was organized October
6, 1898 at the New England Con-
servatory of Music by Ossian E.
Mills and thirteen associates, Its
organization was originally that
of a Sinfonia club, but in 1900 it
was determined to expand and form
a regular college fraternity in mu-.
sical schools of approved excellence.

A loan fund is maintained to
help worthy qualified brothers to
remain in school and complete
‘their education.

With an active membership of
about 20,000 in its 85 chapters
Pi Mu Alpha is perhaps the
largest group %f its kind.

Seniors, Faculty
Collide Tuesday

Athletic grounds here will be
red hot with action Monday
when this year’s seniors meet
picked champions from the
faculty at large in an annual
senior-faculty day series of con-
tests. Events will start at 2 p.m.

Sports used to show the su-
periority of one group will be
golf, badminton, handball, ten-
nis, volleyball and softball. The
individual teams have been
carefully selected so as to make
the members well proportioned
as to their ability.

There will be a gala barbecue
after the softball game at
Erwin Lodge.

AT LAST...

to discuss the pros and cons of the
plan presented, which we heartily
endorse. But we would like to pose
this question. As said, at long last,
the ball has started rolling. Wil it
continue to do so?

The answer lies in 1) the student
body and 2) the faculty and admin-
istration. As Dr. Puckett expressed
it, “We're going to do a better job
and we're going to ask you to do
a better job.” The faculty has at
least taken the first step. The stu-
dent body—particularly the junior,
sophomore and freshman classes—
have the next move.

THE EBERHARDT...

York, where he was met by his
wife. After 107 days of harrowing
thrills and experiences under the
hot desert sun, exploits that only
a priviledged few get to experience
in a lifetime, his first words upon
reaching America were his passion-
ate quip “it’s good to be back.”
Prof. Eberhardt seriously hopes
Davidson fraternities will some-
day invite Arab students to come
here as exchange students. Plans
to this effect are now being formu-
lated, Also Prof Eberhardt hopes
to some day take a DC-6 and 40
men from southeastern universities
on a two months tour that will
retrace his recent yourney. But as
for now we can assure, you his lec-
tures starting 2nd semester sum-
mer school will be interesting and
well illustrated from experience.
