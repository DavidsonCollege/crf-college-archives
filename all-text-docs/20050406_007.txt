some like it hot...

By ELIZABETH BURKHEAD AND SARA SAMS

If you’ve begun to lose hope of ever
arranging a nice intimate dinner with the one
who makes your heart flutter due to a declin-
ing bank balance or absence of stylish
wheels to get you off campus, worry no
more. A bountiful meal in Vail Commons
drains a declining balance of a mere seven
dollars and offers an amazing variety (if not
always quality) of food.

Something can be found to please even the
most sensitive palates and stomachs, a cru-
cial criterion for both a date evening and a
solitary mid-day lunch. 4

The cafeteria experi- 4
ence must, however, be
approached carefully, so
we braved the waters to
sample a __ typical
Monday’s lunch menu
to provide a_ helpful
guide to your Commons
encounter.

For an attractive din-
ing experience, atmos-
phere is everything. We_
strongly suggest dining
in the Harrison Room,
apart from the sports
television and accumu-
lating student lines.

We also support the
decision to place your
tray outside, where «|
tables provide a jg
more leafy and »:
naturally-lit envi- — %
ronment (a good
option, as long as
you avoid the
bees).

Accumulating a
balanced meal with

plethora of not-too- *
enticing selections can be
difficult.

The pseudo-vegetarian at our
table enjoyed a meal of only Vegetarian (V)
menu selections. The eggplant Parmesan was
one of the more delectable meatless plates

Coming out

Once again, questions posed anonymously
by the campus community:

I’ve been questioning my sexuality for a
while and think I’m gay. I’m sick of hear-
ing people assume everyone is straight.
Sometimes I feel alone or made to feel dif-
ferent, which makes me definitely not
want to come out. Are people just being
small-minded, or is it homophobia?

Your concerns are valid and, unfortunate-
ly, quite common. There is an important dis-
tinction, however, between the small-mind-
edness you mention and homophobia.

In the broadest definition of the word, het-
erosexism refers to the assumption that
everyone is or should be heterosexual. This
is a cultural norm to which Westerners have
become accustomed and is probably much
more prevalent than homophobia at
Davidson. :

Most students will assume a date to a
Court function must be of the opposite sex,
for example. And many among us will pre-
suppose that our peers have never experi-
enced homosexual intimacy. As is true of
most assumptions, they are often wrong.

Homophobia, however, is defined as an
intense hatred towards or fear of gay men
and lesbian women. Thankfully, homopho-

available. Relative to other line options
(slightly scary steamed broccoli), the egg-
plant was unctuous. It was quite flavorful
with the right proportion of mozzarella, and
soft enough without requiring the teeth to

see it headlined.

Going the meatier route, chicken Parm
always pleases—just make sure you go to
Commons a little late, which not only will
allow the crowd to die down but also the
sauce to soak into the chicken.

If you time it just right (12:50 has proven
to be the optimal arrival time), the breading
should be the perfect delectable blend of

very picante. The sandwich bar offers the
Southwestern Turkey sandwich, which

Davidson campus, but you should not take
for granted that it does not exist.

For all of its openness and
acceptance, Davidson College
represents a larger communi-
ty of varied beliefs, some of
which are hostile to homo-
sexuality.

According to many non- |
heterosexual Davidson stu- |
dents, though, being “out” on ©
campus rarely leads to out-
right prejudice. ;

That is not to say, how-
ever, that gay students do

biases every day, but overt
intolerance is atypical. Please
remember that being open
about one’s homosexuality is a
constant struggle between
increasing understanding
and encouraging acceptance ,

banana peppers, lettuce, tomato, and red pep-
per mayonnaise on a rich sourdough bread.
Consuming the entire ’wich, though, proved
to be extremely difficult, not only because of
its staggering height but also because of the
relentless intensity of its flavors. For expert
sandwich-chompers only!

If you’re into hot chicks—hot chick peas,
that is—go for this week’s hummus special,
Smokin’ Black Bean, on grilled sourdough.
It offers a tittle extra heat, though the spice
does not overpower the sandwich (which is
delightful with honey mustard).

This week’s pizza special is not for the

ing conglomeration
of toppings: pepper-
oni, salami, sausage,
tomatoes, red
onions, black olives,
mozzarella and
pizza sauce, all syn-
ergizing to create a
unique cornucopia
of sensations.

The simultaneously
best and worst thing about Commons is that
you can keep going until ‘you shout,
“Enough! I’m done.”

While you are not limited to measly
morsels (in fact, small portions can be quite
difficult to acquire), you must pay careful
attention to your own hunger level.
Overconsumption is easy, especially if your
taste buds remain slightly unfulfilled.

Learning from
“Take Back
the Night’

By STEVEN GENTILE
Health Advisor

Recently, Davidson men and women got
the opportunity to “reclaim the night” by
talking about their sexual assault and abuse
expériences. What did we, as a student body,
learn from their talks?

One thing to take from the night is that it
takes a community to help prevent such hor-
rid occurrences.

Fellow men, it is not okay for your friend
to sexually harass a woman — no matter how
drunk he or she is. Take, for instance, the
dance floor. If you see your fellow comrade
groping on the dance floor while dancing,
make it your business to stop the incident!

What is happening or is about to happen
may seriously damage the girl. Furthermore,
the girl may, and should, press charges
against your friend. It is to everyone’s best
interest for you to intervene. Do it subtly, if
you want — you don’t have to make a scene.
Take your friend aside, save the girl by step-
ping in and dancing with her, or... make a
scene. You should do whatever you can do to
save the woman.

Women, you’re needed in. this manner,
too. If you are sexually harassed, do not
brush it off. What is happening to you is
wrong — it’s never okay. Sure, you may not
have a problem with the incident; or, if the
guy is your friend, you may not want to
cause any harm by pressing charges.

Even though you may tolerate the offen-
sive behavior, the next girl may not. The guy
can cause serious harm to the next girl, phys-
ical and emotional. Stop this behavior by
intervening early-on. The emotional and
physical distress of the offended far out-
weighs any punishment the offender should
receive.

It takes a community to prevent sexual
harassment. Set aside your close friendship
ties if your friend causes pain to another.

Finally, gender biased roles were used in
this article simply for convenience. Sexual
harassment happens both ways — man to
woman, woman to man, man to man, and
woman to woman. In any case, it takes all of
us to prevent these incidents from occurring.

condoms, and better sex

Ah, the age-old question. The best and
most concise description comes courtesy of
Davidson’s Health Advisors: insert the index

and middle finger

into the vagina and do

ask Dr. a “come _ hither”
motion, i.e.

pulling the

ine eC ksq aw fingers in a
aa circular

a motion toward the
wrist. Unlike the clitoris

© which projects from nearby tis-

sue, the g-spot rests deep

within the vaginal wall.

Using firm pressure, the
lima-bean sized _ g-spot
responds to stimulation by

, hardening and _ swelling,
much like the male’s penis.
Many women

describe an orgasm
reached through g-
_ Spot stimulation as
deep and long-lasting
whereas clitoral stim-
ulation often produces a
* more intense but signifi-
cantly shorter orgasm.

Is there a difference between “ultra sen-
sitive” condoms and regular condoms? Do
the thinner condoms break easier?

There is no reliable evidence on the rates
of breakage of thin condoms versus regular
condoms, but rest assured that both types of
condoms are approved by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration as effective prophylac-
tics. Use whichever type of condom provides
the most satisfaction and safety for everyone
involved.

Condom breakage is almost always caused
by user error and very rarely by the condom
itself. Remember to use water- and not oil-
based lubricants for the condom, and always
beware of the condom’s expiration date.
Also, be careful of exposing condoms to
extreme temperatures which may cause them
to more easily tear. One of the most common
reasons for condoms to fail is not leaving
enough room at the tip of the condom for the
male’s ejaculate. Finally, one must be sure to
hold the rim of the condom by the base. of the
penis when withdrawing to ensure no ejacu-
late is released accidentally.

Titillatingly,
Dr.. Secksgawd.
