Davidson may be more
capable of competing for top
talent in the multi-million
dollar entertainment — busi
ness through its membership
in the relatively young Na
tional Entertainment Confer-
ence (NEC), according to
Social Council Chairman
Charlie Cameron.

NEC was started in 1960

in North Carolina by a group

Davidson's. Five-Year Plan
Committee met again this
week in an attempt to de
cide how to present its find-
ings most effectively.

The committee, sanction-
ed by the SGA Senate, is at-
tempting to formulate a plan
for aiding potentially bright
students who are hampered
by cultural deficiencies.

According to George Rob-
inson, chairman of the com-
mittee, the group intends to
present its report to the new
ly-formed Spencer Commis-
sion on Extra-Campus Re-
sponsibilities. However, Rob
inson said that a meeting
date for such a presentation
was still uncertain.

“We are’ attempting to
develop means for widely
publicizing the report, par
ticularly since we would like
to hold a student referendum

ed to 50 percent of all sche
duled programs.

In addition, the panel sug-
gested that a committee con
sisting of two senators, two
members of the Union board,
two students at large, the
college chaplain, and a
faculty member, be formed
“to actively solicit quality
speakers and plan and co
ordinate the overall assembly
program.”

These recommendations, if
passed, would go’ into effect

Robinson said.

One possibility mentioned

faculty and students to

tioch and Dartmouth.

in the spring quarter of this
year.

One of the main considera
tions that influenced the com
mittee in its recommenda.
tion on the number of assem-
blies "to be held was the
financial one.

Presently, speakers receive
a $100 honorarium plus travel
expenses as a part of their
pay. By reducing the number
of outside speakers to four
per quarter, the honorarium
could be raised to $250

Another possibility intro
duced by the reduction in the
number of outside speaker's
would be that the
speaker funds could then be
combined with funds. avail-

However, it was felt that
requiring attendance at four
out of the eight scheduled
meetings would guarantee
the speaker a good chance of

cerned about the rising cost
of entertainment and -the
problems schools faced in
presenting talent on campus

From eight schools, includ
ing Davdson, and five book
ing agents in 1962, NEC has
now grown to over 125 schools
and 55 agents.

The 12 board members of
the NEC include C. Shaw
Smith, director of the College
Union, one of the original
planners of the conference,
and Ed Embree, presiden:
of the Union Board.

The most crucial problem
Davidson faces is that of
skyrocketing prices for enter
tainment, Cameron said.
“In six months, the Cham-
bers Brothers’ price went
from $2,000 to $10,000.

“The Fifth Dimension,
after two hits and an album,
went from $1,500 to $5,000
per performance.” Since

Davidson in. 1966, he said,
