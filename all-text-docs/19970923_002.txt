Vamonos Van:

money-maker
or money pit?

By JENNY HapGoop

Picture this: Friday night has
arrived and you and your friends
feel the time has come to venture
off campus. Unfortunately, you
lack a means of transportation. Just
when you think all is lost and the
night is ruined, you remember the
SGA’s transportation service.

With anew program and anew
outlook, the Vamonos Van will take
you and fourteen others anywhere
between Huntersville and
Mooresville for $1.00.

This year, there is no estab-
lished route the van must follow.
Consequently, students won’t find
themselves shuttled to destinations
other than their own. Drivers will
also communicate via a passenger
log to make their one- hour shifts
more efficient for both-themselves
and the passengers. In the future,
drivers may carry cellular phones
or beepers, but this is currently not
feasible for the transportation bud-
get.

The Vamonos Van will also

transport students to and from off--

campus parties. This is an impor-
tant aspect of the program, and the
SGA hopes students will utilize the
yan as opposed to drinking and driv-
ing. “We’re going to do everything
we can to make sure people don’t
drink and drive,” said Chris Tuttle,
chair of the Rides Committee.

Currently, the Vamonos Van is
rented from Davidson for $39.00 a
night. On Friday, Sept. 13, the Van
carried between 30 and 40 people.
The profit has not been substantial,
and as of now, the SGA is taking a
noticeable hit to their budget. With
an accommodating route, increased
advertising, and positive feedback
from devoted passengers, the
Vamonos Van will ostensibly draw
more customers.

Chauffeurs undergo a brief
training course that consists of
watching a video and driving the
van for 15 minutes with Ray
LaGortey.

After certification, drivers can
spend as little as one hour a week
helping other students choose safe
transportation

New Union on drawing board

_. TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 1 997

@ According to preliminary administrative plans and this artistic representation, the

new Union will incorporate what is now Johnston Gym.

Vagt providing necessary impetus for building

With the Life Science Building
well under way, one of the College’s
next big projects will be the con-
struction of a new Student Union
around the Johinston Gym area.

College president Bobby Vagt

. has made it clear he wants the new

Union complete in the next few
years.

The College is currently look-
ing at 14 different architectural firms
that could design and build the new
Union. The Buildings and Grounds

Elections raise concerns
Low voter turnout worrisome

NARESH NAGELLA
News Editor

The elections held Tuesday are
classified as “Category Two.” They
involved
elections
for inde-
pendent
senators,
freshman
class senators, and sophomore, jun-
ior, and senior honor council mem-
bers.

But voter turnout rates indicate
that the student body did not highly
prioritize the election very much at
all.

In total, about 56 percent of the
on-campus student body voted.

That number is slightly height-
ened by the 72.5 percent of the
freshman class that voted.

224 sophomores, 111 juniors,
and 168 seniors voted.

The low junior numbers can be
explained by the large number of
students from that class studying
abroad this year.

Still, the aggregate totals indi-
cate that half the campus has de-
cided not to participate in the sys-
tem that decides who campus lead-
ers will be.

Half of the student body
chooses not to have its voice heard
regarding who will sit on Honor
Council trials or represent them’in
student government.

There are many reasons to ex-

plain the low voter turnout.

One is that ballots can only be
found in Chambers and in the Com-
mons. This could easily exclude
students who do not eat at the Com-

mons and only have
classes in the Visual
Arts Center or the
Cunningham Fine Arts
‘ building or Dana and
Martin Science build-
ings on that day.

Solutions to this problem, like
e-mail voting or more ballot areas,
have been suggested but have yet to
be implemented.

By-laws or SGA guidelines
might have to be changed for them
to occur.

Another explanation forthe low
turnout could be a perceived weak-

nesses in the SGA’s power to take”

decisive action to help the student
body and a belief that the character
of Honor Council representatives
will not really change the enforce-
ment or the Honor Code.

Another reason may be that the
campaigns are just not engaging
enough.

Some candidates were upset
with the way some people ran their
campaigns.

One freshman senator was
elected after sending out a mass e-
mail distribution to his class — a
practice prohibited by the Computer
Service Center.

“T did not address that directly
since I did not have the ability to do

so,” said Paul Dryden, Elections
Council Chairperson.

“The by-laws do not directly
address it. (People) might consider
adding such an amendment to the
by-laws calling it an unfair advan-
tage.”

Finally, many people wondered
why there was not a run-off elec-
tion. Thirty-one freshmen were run-
ning for the six available senator
spaces, and many of the other races
were contested as strongly. There
was a fear that some candidates
could be elected with only 10-15
votes.

But there is only a run-off elec-
tion if the winning candidates do
not get 50 percent
of the votes.

In the election,

ees will decide on the actual firm.
Anartist’s representation was done
by Little and Associates of Char-
lotte.

Dean of Students Tom
Shandley is hesitant to put an exact
date on the Union’s completion.

“We can not break ground un-
til the money is raised for the
project,” he said. “The college (has
guidelines): stating that construc-
tion on a new project cannot begin
until half the money needed to com-
plete it is raised.”

The.cost for the new Union is
expected to be in the millions of
dollars. There was some concern

the emphasis on the new Union
would take away from the complete
revamping of the track, although
“the projects are different and work
independently of.each other,”
Shandley said.

The new track should be com-
pleted soon and will cost $500,000.

“The track, if you want to call
it that, is sort of disgraceful to the
school,” said senior Dave Jackson,
who hopes both projects are com-
pleted soon.

“The new Union will probably
be necessary for the increasing stu-

“dent enrollment we have seen the

past couple of years.”

all the winners did
receive sucha com-

there were no run-
offs.

Overall,
Dryden is happy
with the way the
élections were
handled, but hints at
the possibility of
better results.

“The elections
went extraordinar-
ily well, but we can
shoot for higher in
the future. There is
always room forim-
provement.”
