In pursuit of

Spratt, Arbuckle Draw Up
Letter To Faculty Group

BY RON SNOW

In a move to spur action on the part of the Student
Faculty Conference Committee,
a five-point letter to be sent to
Dean Richard C. Burts. Arbuckle said that the purpose of
this move was to try to put student body responsibility in
areas where it could serve the student better. than a

Arbuckle have drawn up

faculty committee could.

The five main points of the
letter are:

They feel that the Student
Body President and the Honor
Court President should be con-
sulted in case of student disci-
pline relating to conduct.

They feel that the Honor
Court should have priority in all
cases except those handled by
the Executive Committee.

A student who is campus-
sed should not be made to serve
an additional sentence for a
minor violation, but should
serve his 30 days straight and be
through with it.

Overcutting chapel or ves-
pers should result in- a reduc-
fun, by one-half, of the number
of cut’ allowed for that student
the next semester. Overcutting
.a second time should result in
campussing.

They feel that social pro-
bation should be a disciplinary
penalty rather than campussing.
A student on social probation
should not be allowed to parti-
cipate or attend any fraternity
function other than meals.

The Student Council and
Arbuckle discussed these points
and questioned the merit of a
few of them. The second point
sseemed a little strong. it was
noted. while the fourth contained
an easy loophole. The fifth
point wouldn't hinder an Inde-
pendent at all.

Spratt mentioned to the coun-
cil that Dean Burts says the
Student Faculty Conference
Committee is constantly rethink-
ing its stand on the Campus
Code. Noticing that nothing is
said about it at meetings of the
committee, Spratt said, “If the
Student Faculty Conference
Committee is thinking about the
Campus Code, they must be do-
ing it individually and mighty
secretly.”

Consulting with head cheer-
leader Danny King, the Student
Council decided that a new
policy for electing cheerleaders
was necessary before the up-
coming elections. King felt that
only cheerleaders could choose
cheerleaders, because they knew
what was needed. If the stud-
ents were to elect them it would
be largely a matter of popular
ity, he said. ‘Popular guys just
aren't always the best cheer-

leaders,”’ said King.

After considerable discussion
of ideas on the best method of
choice, King supplied the even-
tual answer. King wished that
there be no more than 10 cheer-
leaders in all. This number was
Jater raised to 11, and includes
three girl chieerleaders.

Those interested in being a
cheerleader must sign a list in
the head cheerleader’s room.
The out-going senior cheerlead-
ers will choose from this list a
slate of nominees totalling twice
the number needed. The Student
Body wil! then vote on the slate
of nominees. The head cheer-
leader will be elected by the new
cheerleaders, and will have
authority over the group which
will include power of dismissal.

Arbuckle presented to the

council a new method of elect-
ing the Honor Court chairman,
announcing that the Honor
Court had met and approved
the plan. The chairman would
be elected by the incumbent
court with recently “ elected
members excluded from the
voting.

The Honor Court recorder
shall be elected by both old and
new court members. Only those
members with previous exper-
lence shall be eligible for the
office. The positions shall be
filed during the time of the
regular spring election period as
soon as the new court is elected.

Tom Frist and Tommy Staf-
ford reported to the council the
results of the freshman poll con.
cerning Freshman Regulations.
The most notable result of the
poll was the overwhelming
favor for a short and strict en-
forcement period of the regula-
tions. Stafford. Spratt and Frist
met this afternoon to decide

the coming year.

on the Curriculum Committee,
told the council of his talk with
Dr. Frontis Johnston. Johnston
had told him that he didn't want
a student voting in the commit-
tee, and that. he thinks some-
times students should not be
present at the meetings. Spratt
wants to try to get a student on
the committee with some es-
tablished regularity.

about civil rights and race rela-
tlons will be given. Joe Howell,
student leader in organizing
Davidson participation in the
demonstration, and Dr. E. F.
Patterson, Davidson professor of
economics, will be included a-
mong the speakers.

The students at the rally—
Howell estimates 750—will
then march double-file along
the sidewalk from Johnson C.
Smith to the main post office
in Charlotte. The march will
begin. between 3:30 and 3:45.
The marchers will carry signs
stating that they are in favor
of strong civil rights legisla-
tion.

At the post office, a delegation
from each school will be chosen
to mail petitions addressed to
President Lyndon B. ‘Johnson. A
sample of the petition, urging
the President to support the civil
rights legislation, appeared two
weeks ago in THE DAVIDSON-
IAN.

The students will then march
back to Johnson C. Smith, again
double-file along the sidewalk.
The march to the post office and
back has been approved by the
Charlotte Police Dept., and pro-
tection will be provided along
the entire route to the marchers.

On return to the Negro cam-
pus. the marchers will be served
food. and will remain until the
early evening for some type of
entertainment. ‘“‘We don‘t know
just yet what the entertainment
will be,’ said Howell. “It will
probably a  hootenanny type
thing. We just want to have a
little time for the students from
the various schools to socialize.”

President Martin in a letter
to Dr. Max E. Polley, a Bible
professor, last Friday suggest-
ed an alternate plan for the
demonstration. The proposal
from Martin called for the
students to send a small dele-
petion to the post office to mall
the petition after the rally st

Johnson €. Smith, rather than

having a targe march with

several hundred participants.

Two paragraphs from the let-

fer read:

“It seems to me that almost THEREFORE, (@,

risk of violence that is always

present in demonstrations of
this sort."
Martin said that he could

promise press coverage because
he had talked with Mayor Stan
R. Brookshire of Charlotte be-
fore presenting his plan to the
committee and that the mayor
had both approved the plan as

Davidson students would dem-
onstrate.

March Rule

Faculty Regulations on stud-
ent conduct state, “Student
parades must be limited to the
campus and athletic field.”

President D. G. Martin in-
ferpreted the rule today: “The
parade in Charlotte is not an
official student parade. It is
a parade of individuals. The
Civil Rights Committee is not
a college organization, as t
understand it, but one of the
entire community. The rule
was intended for other situa-
tions than the one in Char-
lotte.’”

Martin, however, said that
at a later date the Faculty
or the Executive Committee
could make a different inter-
pretation. He said that in the
case of a different interpreta-
tion by elther body, punilive
action could be taken against
the students involved.

tin's proposal had been made
earlier, it might have been ac
ceptable. “Two weeks. ago. 1
did not expect a reaction against
the march. I felt like it was a
minor demonstration--in fact. 1
prefer the words ‘rally’ and
‘walk.’ Perhaps had we antici-
pated that so many people in
Charlotte would express such
concern, we might have planned
only a rally at Johnson C.
Smith.”

Polley stressed the fact that
he did not feel that Martin ha@
placed any pressure on the civil
rights group or that he had tried
to place pressure on it for the
officials in Charlotte. "The ad-
ministration could have been no
better in this,"’ he said. “I found
the president to be very reason-
able throughout all my contacts
with him."

Polley said that the major
