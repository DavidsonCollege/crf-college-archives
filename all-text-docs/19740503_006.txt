Hattie’s has changed more
in four years than Davidson
ever will. Unlike Grim's and
the Main Street collection, no
one has dared write about Hat-
tie's because it means so
many different things depen-
ding on who you are.

I remember freshman year
spring and French 137
meeting in the back corner
booth. the pinball machine
with arthritic flippers,
breaking a hundred thousand
on it, and raising my grade
from a C toa C-plus.

The year before that, after
the basketball team had
beaten South Carolina, the
whole school had_ spon-
taneously flocked to Hattie’s
to be jubilant together. When

Railway the next morning.

This vear, the whole interior
has been changed to a more
hoity toity decor. Still
recognizable under the veneer
are the same booths that once
made people sit stiffly straight
in the old Wildcat Den. A new
line of sandwiches and pizzas
was also installed, and these
provide the excuse for this
column.

The sandwiches, while not
‘the best of New York
delicetessentia’’, are certainly
the best in the area. Even Ron
Scott eats there occasionally.

Since I am broke (hey,
Mom?), I was unable to sam-

Karoly Makk’s ‘‘Love’’ (a Hungarian
film made in 1971 and released in this
country in 1973) establishes its main
mood in a beautifully edited opening
segment.

An old lady, who is later identified on-
ly as ‘‘Mama."’ lies in her bed. conver-
ses , and moves to a seat before the win-
dow where she watches the rain outside
and falls asleep. Interspersed with this
are flittering glimpses of her stream of
consciousness-memories from the past.
a book of poetry (Goethe?) romantic
visions of her son in a turn-of-the-
century-ish New York. and very briefly
a nightmare image of her son in a
political prison. which is where he
really is

The spirit of Lila Darvas’ beautiful
performance as “‘Mama’’ pervades the
entire film. Although ‘‘Mama’’ disap-
pears about midway through the film,
we continually hope to see her again
and do not learn that she has died until
the end.

Grumblingly, I'll admit that the
Oscars have done me a favor for once.

They have called to my attention a wor-
thwhile film which I had overlooked,
and by giving it an award they have got-
ten it some new bookings and given me
another chance to see it.

Originally, I ignored John G. Avild-
sen's “Save the Tiger’’ because his last,
two, “Guess What We Learned in
School Today’’ and ‘‘Cry Uncle,’’ were
absolute dogs and because Jack Lem-
mon hadn’t given a good performance
in years.

“Save the Tiger’ is something of a
comeback for both Avildsen and Lem-
mon. Avildsen’s direction is greasy-
slick as always, but he had gotten
major performances from Jack Lem-
mon and Jack Gilford (as he did from
Peter Byle in ‘‘Joe’’) plus several fine
performances from his supporting cast.

‘Love’

Gyorgy Sivo’s precise editing
delicately interlaces the film with its
characters’ thoughts and sometimes
with the actions of the son who is being
talked about but lives in a different set-
ting for most of the movie.

Adapted by Tibor Dery from two of
his own novellas, “‘Love”’ is about three
good people, three people whom their
creators seem to respect. They are not
goody-goody people - they have their
problems and weaknesses - but they
also have an ennobling quality. their
love for one another.

Makk's direction, like that of most
Hungarian film makers. is more
academic and intelligent than talented
and instinctual.

However, he uses his intelligence to
bend the form of his film into the ser-
vice of the content, and his content is
very strong. Everything in the film
seems to have been done in exactly the
right way.

‘‘Mama’ tells the story of how at the

age of nine she prayed to God that it
would stop raining the next day so sne
could wear her new dress to a picnic.
The rain did not stop until the day after
that, and she stopped going to church
because she was not interested in a God
who was not of practical use. I thought.
‘How similar this is to the religious
history of so many of us!”

The director and his writers and ac-
tors create the illusion of letting us wat-
ch “real” lives as they are in the
process of being lived.

Some things in the movie I did not un-
derstand at all. but I know that the
director did and that he was telling me
about them.

“Love” is full of what Wordsworth
might recognize as the still. quiet music
of humanity. Sadness, however. is not
among its moods. In some ways. the
film is almost too refined for its own
good.

‘Save The Tiger’

Gilford is especially successful It takes
place late at night in a deserted office
building. and both men are drunk and
talking about shattered illusions.
Gilford’s performance is at its best and
Lemmons is in and out of its best.

For the trenchant success of its en-
semble acting, this scene reminds me
of “‘I’ll Cry Tomorrow”’ which reminds
me of ‘‘Diabolique’’ which reminds me
of “Day of Wrath.”’ I mean this fourth
level comparison with the Dreyer film
as a very strong complement.

Of course, the Oscars cannot do
anything totally right. Although they
managed to nominate both Lemmon
and Gilford, they gave an award to
Lemmon and not one to Gilford, which
is exactly the opposite of what they
should have done considering the com-
petition.

An advertisement for the film con-
tains an excellent plot summary.

‘Juggle the books. Set fire to the fac-
tory. Supply women to the clients.
Harry Stoner will do anything to get one
more season."’

_ However, this does not quite do
justice to the full range of the screen-
play’s cliched boldness of the film.

The film also has a confrontation
scene between the establishment and
the Hippies, the former being represen-
ted by Stoner and the latter by a token
Hippie fantasy figure poorly played by
Laurie Heineman. Perhaps the Oscars
were attracted to Shager's screenplay
by its pretentiousness.

With this screenplay, ‘Save the
Tiger’ could easily become harshly of-
fensive, but the film manages to get
some energy out of its vulgarity and a
great deal of sympathy from its per-
formances.

however, that the cheese is
soft and gooey, blending
nicely with the crust, unlike
the Village Inn where the
whole top peels off like a big
scab.

The only fair way to
describe the character of the
place is to give you a few snat-
ches of overheard con-
versations from the premises:

Noah, Grizzard, Van,
Spacey, and her sister tried to
compose an ‘‘Ode to Hat-
tie’s’’: ‘There's no place like
it, alright? There’s nothing
like it in Charlotte. There's no
place to dance in Davidson.
There's the night the Easter
Bunny came here and had to
be carried out.” And so it
went.

(After exams) ‘I thought
we would go down to Colum-
bus to see her folks and then
go to Florida for a couple of
days. and then come back by
Six Flags, Stone Mountain and
Carowinds...."’

“Everybody thinks just
because you put a new front
end on it and have the wheel
way out there that it’s a chop.
That ain't a chop. You gotta
have molding and everything
else. Now. mine ain't a full
chop yet.”

C.A. and Y.B. come here a
lot. So do Katy and Mary. Boy,
Thursday nights here are
wild: no one has Friday
classes.

Johnson City ain't shit.
There's one road there with
just three or four bars and
that's all.

*‘Hey, did you see Houchen’s
article? I swear, it’s the best
thing that's ever been written
in that paper.”’

“Johnson City’s a lot like
Gastonia (?), and it’s the only
place in the mountains that's
not dry."

“Isn't the new library over
there ugly?"

What all this comes down to
is that everybody thinks they
know everything there is
about Hattie’s, but no one
really does. As a Davidson in-
Stitution, seniors should take
their parents there during
commencement weekend
rather than trucking them off
to Charlotte for a semi-
cosmopolitan steak
