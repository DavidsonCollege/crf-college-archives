professor for a longer period in effect
contradicts your need for him. The
problem is the costs involved.’’

College President Samuel R. Spen-
cer Jr. explained the need for a more
formal faculty development program.
‘We are now entering a period of
steady-state growth for faculties all
over the country. The mobility and
expansion of faculties during the
sixties is past now.

“In such a steady-state situation
we must provide even more programs

for the faculty to enrich their.
thinking.

“In the past, whenever we have
introduced new programs, such as the
humanities program, we have always
given faculty members grants to
study these programs; or in the case
of something like the computors,
we've provided funds to study these
new facilities.”

On the training program proposed
for new professors, Spencer stressed
that such a program would have to be
voluntary. Johnston concurred in this
opinion and said he felt that there are
“very narrow’ improvements that
could come from such a program,
although he noted that a ‘‘faculty
member can learn a lot’’ from his
peers.

Spencer also felt that a sort of

ty development programs

“Watson - Fellowship for Faculty
Members”’ should be created so that a

professor could persue a project
tangential to his field and thereby
expand his intellectual horizons.

“IT would also like to see the chances
for all faculty members to study
abroad increase a great deal. We are
obviously more and more becoming a
one-world community, and we need to
stop being provincial. We need to see
ourselves in the perspectives of other
cultures.”

Faculty Executive Committee
member John Kelton is particularly
unimpressed with the idea of using ©
video-tape equipment to record a
faculty member’s presentation. Ins-
tead he would like to see the college
hire a full-time consultant to run a
“learning resource center.’’

“This person would know more
than just the traditional methods for
running a class and presenting mate-
rials, such as lecturing and running
discussion groups,”’ said Kelton.

He would know and be able to
suggest to faculty members various
new ways to present illustrations to a
class. Also he would suggest methods
for researching and preparing for
classes.

“T think such a person would draw
interest from new and older faculty
members alike,” said Kelton.

For now the Executive Committee orm

is reviewing the
