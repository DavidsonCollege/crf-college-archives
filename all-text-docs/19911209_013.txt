Spanish Department
Launches Summer
Program In Mexico

By Frances Morton

The Spanish Department is
sponsoring the first summer pro-'
gram in Mexico. The trip will be
led by head of the department,
Professor Hernandez, and the par-
ticipants will experience the sights
and sounds of Guadalajara, Mex-
ico from May 18 to July 3.
Guadalajara is a city of 4.5 million
people -- the second largest city in
the country. Students participat-
ing inthe program can choose from
awide variety of classes: Mexican
Art and Contemporary Mexican
Culture are offered for the more
advanced students on the trip and
Intensive Intermediate Spanish is
intended for those who have only -
finished their second semester of
Spanish. Therefore, there is some-
thing for every Spanish student on -
this trip, no matter what his or her
level.

Students who participate in the
program will live with Mexican
families and will travel during
several weekends all throughout

Mexico to such places as
Guanajuato,Tequila, and San
Miguel Allende, The trip will end

up with a week in Mexico City and ~

neighboring areas. While in
Guadalajara, the group will attend
many cultural events such as the
“Ballet Foloclérico de
Guadalajara,” the “Ballet
Folclérico de México,” and sev-
eral others theater productions and
concerts, —

' The structure of the summer
program will be very similar to the
semester long excursions abroad
that the Spanish department has

_ taken in the past.

Usually, the pro rotates
between Spain and Mexico every
other year, but Dr. Hernandez
decided to experiment this year
with a program that might appeal
to students whocould not or would
not take the time to spend an entire
semester away. This program will
offer more versatility to the study
abroad options that Davidson of-
fers its students.

Basa sat on the perch in her

cage and clicked her beak while: .

she shook her body, her way of
asking to be let out into the room.
Meanwhile, Ryan remained calm

birds of prey who live on the third
floor of Dana Science Building in
the Behavioral Studies room.

*» Ifyou are wondering why two:

birds are kept caged on the dreary,
windowless third floor of Dana,

- it’s not a secret, sadistic ploy of

those mad biologists. Actually,
Ryan, the Red-tailed Hawk, and
Basa, Great-Horned Owl, both
have permanent injuries and can-
not be released into the wild.
According to Dr. Verna Case,

each bird is missing a wing. “One: .

by acar,”’ she said. “These injuries

birds.

As a work study job, Deepak
Vijayathilakan takes care of the
birds. His interest in raptors (birds
of prey) developed during his
summer internship at the Raptor
Center in Huntersville. Deepak’s
work consists of feeding the birds
daily with either three mice or half
arat each. I questioned him about
the half of a rat--he just pointed to
an axe lying on the floor. Later he
informed me that the rodents are
frozen, not live.

When it is warm enough;
Deepak takes the birds outside once
a week. However, he takes them
out of their cages daily to sit on
perches in the room.

“At the Raptor Center, I was
able to work with many types of
birds including falcons, owls, and
hawks,” Deepak told me. “I learned
the importance of the various birds

of prey and how they effect ecol-
ogy. The birds we have here are

used for educational purposes,

teaching people the impact birds
of prey have.”

Deepak wants to start using
the birds for instructional purposes
since they have not been used for
education for a few years. Actu-
ally, Basa has lived here since 1980,
while Ryan has only been around
for about six years. Both birds are
relative newcomers to captivity
since, according to Deepak, wild

* birds can live for up to 25 years in

captivity.
If you have an interest in birds
of prey or are just interested in

‘seeing the beautiful captives, be-

come acquainted with Deepak and
have him take you tosee them. Not
only will you be impressed with
the birds, but Deepak’s vastknowl-
edge of raptors will amaze you.

Beware the Evi ils of Diet Coke & Vivarin During Exams

Liz and Dair say...

Our topic this week is caffeine.
We know a lot about this topic
from personal experience. Unfor-
tunately, we had to learn the hard
way not to abuse Vivarin or coffee
or Diet Coke,

Everyone should reduce their
caffeine intake toaslow anamount
as possible. Do not try to stay up by
popping Vivarins. Though caffeine
does keep you awake--itisastimu-
lant--it does so at the expense of
your health. Caffeine is horrible

for ulcers or any other stomach *.

problems, prolonged use can cause
painful headaches, studies link it
tocancer, and caffeine is addictive

ad ine sense that you build up a.

resistance to it. The one cup of
coffee itused to take to wake up in
the morning will no longer do the
job after a while because the body
develops a tolerance for the drug.
This is why it is not uncommon to
see office workers drinking five or

_ six cups of coffee a day.

Caffeine can also make you
tired. Although the drug initially
makes tlié user feel more alert, he
or she will feel tired after a period.
Thus, drinking coffee in the morn-
ing will likely make youmore tired
than usual in the evening. This is
not good if you are driving home
on the freeway or preparing for an

evening out. Students who use
caffeine to pull all-nighters are
exhausted by classtime. They could
perform more poorly on bie asa
result.

While caffeine should in gen-
eral be avoided, nearly all of us at
some point need to use it to stay
awake. If you must, remember
these tips:

‘1. Do Not Take Vivarin. This has

-got to be the world’s stupidest drug.
The dosage of caffeine is concen-

trated--more so than in coffee or
Coke--and itis notaliquid, so your
body will feel the effect longer,
rather than naturally getting rid of
the drug. If youarenotaccustomed

tocaffeine, this drug is particularly
bad. You will be bouncing off the
walls. If you try to take this drug to
stay awake studying, you will dis-
cover that you can’t concentrate at
all. Your hands will start to shake,
your heart will race, and you won’t
be able to sit still for longer than a
couple of minutes. When the drug
finally begins to wear off,you’ll
get a horrible headache. Then, by
morning, you'll be drained--the
worst condition for taking a test.

2. Acup of coffee or one Coke will
suffice, This amount of caffeine
will help you feel alert without
feeling hyper, and you will not be

tired in the long run. Do not drink

two or three cups of coffee or Cokes
in arow with the idea that you will
be “really awake.” This will have
the same effects as Vivarin. If, an
hourorso after you drink the initial
cup, then itis okay to go ahead and
drink more. Butif you’re not féel-
ing tired, stop!
3. Do not take other drugs with
caffeine. If you are on medication,
ask your doctor about how. caf-
feine reacts with your medication.
This is common sense, but many
overlook it and get sick as aresult.
That’s aboutit. Try to get your
work done ahead of time, if you
can. If you are going to stay up late,
itshould be partying, not studying.
