by Kryl’s band, which proved to be a
popular success,

The next concert to be given will be

Miss Lield is one of the outstanding
young sopranos of the last season, hay-
ing made a very successful debut in New
york City. Since that time she has re-
ceived much favorable criticism from the
music critics of the nation,

and

The Siberian Singers, a group of ten
male voices under the direction of Nich-
olas Vasilietf, will be the highlight of the
series, Kach of these ten members is a
soloist of unusual ability, yet together
they attain a vocal blend as beautiful and
sonorous as the tones of an organ. They
received their training in the famous
Kussian Choir, and. for the past few
years they have been touring the United
States, On their first concert of this tour
they created a sensation with the spirit
and intensity of emotion in their song.
their phenomenal range is perhaps un-
equaled by any other male ensemble in
the world.

Their . broadcast over the National
Broadcasting Company network so pro-
foundly impressed the radio audience that
letters of praise and commendation for
their beautiful voices, and the artistic
presentation of their programs, were re-
ceived from every section of the nation,

Nicholas Vasilieff will bring this group
here on February 25, 1936,

Thane McDonald, one of the most
promising young organists of the coun-
try, will appear here in a recital some
time in March, 1936. His playing is
marked by a brilliance and keen musical
understanding which when added to the
tones of the fine Skinner Organ in the
Chambers Auditorium should constitute
a very delightful program.

This series is not designed to bring
remunerative profit to the College, nor
to any person or Organization, but its
purpose is to present advantages for en-
joyment of music—long needed and now
demanded,

ments Before Crowd

The football and band displays, lo-
cated in the show windows of a local
business house, attracted considerable at-
tention from alumni, students, and friends
during the Home-coming week-end.

At the base of both display cases were
miniature football fields upon which
were placed cardboard figures represent-
ing the members of the band and foot-
ball team. The football men were ar-
ranged in kick-off formation and the
band in the letters, D. C. 5

Suitable photographs and pictures were
arranged on the red background, In the
back of the band window were pictures
of the glee club, the concert band, the
R.O.T.C. band, the drum majors, and
the band conductors. Also, near the base,
were copies of “O Davidson” and “Dear
Old Duke,” and a cardboard microphone
announcing the new broadcast hour.

At the right was a series of photo-
graphs, including pictures of the salon
orchestra, the Skinner organ, former Da-
vidson bands, and Brock, drum major in
‘33. In the middle of the entire display,
resting on the base of the show case,
was the cup won in the Independence Day
Parade, held in Charlotte May 20,
1935.

In the football window, two footballs
were displayed in prominent
The first of these was that used when
Davidson beat Duke by twenty points,
and the other that which Thad Brock
carried 105 yards without scoring. In the
background were photographs of the
present team, its coaches, its captains,
its line, its backfield, and also former
Davidson teams. In this group were the
‘04 team, the '07 team, and the '26 team,
state champions.
