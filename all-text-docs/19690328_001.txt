Faculty To Vote Today

On Voluntary ROTC

By FRANKLIN ANDERSON
Editor-in-Chief

The faculty is scheduled
to vote this afternoon on a
resolution for voluntary RO-
TC termed by its faculty
sponsors ‘‘the minimal rep-
resentation of both faculty
and student desires.”

In ¢ letter circuiated to the
faculty yesterday. five fac-
ulty members proposed that
the faculty reaffirm its stand

in favor of voluntary ROTC.
which it took in approving
the Blue Sky recommenda-
tions in November, 1967.

The resolution is apparent.
ly coming directly to the floor
in the faculty because pre-
vious proposals, including one
by the. student Senate. had
not been reported out from
the faculty’s Educational Pol.
icy Committee.

Proposed by Charles FE.

Ratliff. Randall Kincaid,
Alexander J. McKelway. Wil-
liam E. Jackson and W.
Brown Patterson. the resolu-
tion reads:

“That the Davidson College
faculty reaffirm its convic-
tion that participation in the
ROTC program at Davidson
must be on a voluntary basis.
and that each entering stu:

ATO’s, Kappa Sigs Weigh
Benefits Of Local Status

By GEORGE ALLEN
Associate Editor

At least two Davidson frat-
ernites. the Alpha Tau
Omega and the. Kappa
Sigma, have studied the ques-
tion of leaving their national
fraternities and have discov
ered the advantages and dis-
advantages involved in their
becoming local chapters.

According to Martin Brac-
kett, former president of
Kappa Sigma. and Jim. Cool
ey, ATO pledge trainer, both
fraternities have organized
committees to study the
local-national problem and
expect these committees to
report their findings in the
near future. As soon as the
committees report. both
fraternities will vote on the
proposals presented to them.
said Brackett and Cooley.

The major objection the
KS's have to remaining a
national fraternity involves
the large amount of. money
which they send to the na-
tional headquarters each year
in initiation fees. Brackett
said that many of the mem-
bers of Kappa Sigma feel
that this is a waste of money
which could be better used
by the local chapter.

Jim Cooley said that the
ATO interest in becoming a
local chapter centers around
the objection to sending mon-
ey to national. and the desire
for local autonomy.

‘‘We have sent $7,000 to our
national fraternity in the last
two years without receiving
any benefits we can really
put our fingers on."’ said

Local Man
To Reopen
Lefty’s Den

Staff Writer

William S. Murphy of Dav-
idson has leased the Wildcat
Den frem ex-Davidson bas-
‘ketball coach Lefty Driesell.

Murphy. director of the
Union food service from
1953 to 1957 and presently
manager of Ivey's cafeteria
in Charlotte, that he and his
son will run the restaurant.

He also foresaw some chan-
ges in the present operation.
“We will feature instant ser
vice on our orders,’ he said.
and ~°“anticipate serving
draught beer with orders in
the near future.”

“We plan to upgrade ser-
vice all around, because we
believe this is the sort of
thing that a college town like
Davidson needs,’’ he aded.

Murphey added that much
of his help will come from
college boys themselves,
stating that he had ‘had
good experiences with the
college before.”

The restaurant is scheduled
to open Tuesday and will be
open during lunch time on a
trial basis.

Cooley.

The largest objection to na-
tional affiliation at the ATO
house, however, seems to be
their interest. in local auto
nomy.

“Right now.”’ said Cooley.
“we have to follow the. poli-
cies of our national fratern-
ity. We think that we should
nave local authority on our
selection processes. which
would involve an. alteration
of the black-ball system. We
would also like to rewrite
our ritual, bringing it up to
date and making it signfi-
cant to us,”’ Cooley continu-
ed.

As advantages of remain-
ing national Brackett said
that the Kappa Sigma na-
tional has been very
liberal with the Davidson
chapter in its selection and
bidding procedures. Brackett
added that the national of-
fers several undergraduate
‘scholarships for Kappa Sig-

mas and that much of their
financial support comes from
the chapter's alumni, who
favor a national tradition
for Kappa Sigma at David-
son.

Cooley reported that ATO
considers financial stablity
and the prestige of being a
national fraternity the major
advantages of staying with
the national organiéation.

Brackett was unsure of
the prospects of Kappa Sigma
going local this year.

“I really don't know wheth-
er we will go local or not."’
sand Brackett.. “There are,-
certain members of the house’
on both sides of the question.
The proposal to become a
local chapter will be voted on
in the next few weeks or so."’
he said.

Brackett said that ‘two
thirds of the active member-
ship of Kappa Sigma here
must approve before they
will go local.

cerning such participation
after adequate orientation to
Military Science.”

The letter cited two main
ways in which ‘“‘the present
arrangement jis  unsatisfac-
tory."' .

“The parents are given a
choice but the student is not.
and he (the student) is’ our
concern,’ said the letter.

Also criticized was the
timing of the decision, which
is before the student ‘‘ar-
rives on campus and has any
real basis to make judg
ment.”

The faculty resolution is
part of a long series of efforts
to make ROTC rvoluntary.

Yearly demoristrations at
Federal Inspection had long
produced occasiotially tense
and often amusing incidents.
but the anti-ROTC sentiment
seemed to consolidate when

struction.

“No question before us
caused greater concein a
mong us," said the commit-
tee report,.*’but we are united
in our conclusion that Military’
Science. as a subject matter
in the curriculum, is not com
patible with the ideal of the
libera} arts and ought not to
be required of anyone.”

But the Blue Sky Commit
tee's proposal for voluntary
basic ROTC was lost. when
the trustees decided to revise
the program only slightly and
allow a freshman to drop
military training if he had
his parents’ permission and
if he did so before he en
rolled in the fall.

Since then, the demonstra.

‘People believed this dur
ing World War II about. the
Germans and the Japanese,”
Gilligan said. “but people
now are finally beginning to
protest against this idea.”

Gilligan was one of the ad
vocates of the ‘‘peace plank”
introduced beldre she Plat-
form Committee of the Dem-
ocratic National Convention
last August! When question-
ed about the hearings. he an-
swered that the effort was
not really a failure at all.

“We offered a three-point

program ior peace,’ Gilli
gan sad, “and two of those
three points are now a part

of the Nixon plan for Viet-
nam."
In commenting tou: party

poliics Gilligan was reluct
ant to name a possible Dem-
ocratic candidate for the
presidency in 1972, but said
he wo:ld lean toward Sena-
tor Edward Kennedy.

Touching on the current.
administration's recent “‘get
tough’. policy on student
demonstrations, Gilligan call-
ed Nixon's stand a “‘cheap
play for applause,’’ equating
it with the popular cry for
law and order.

ment.

“The blacks find them
selves in an alien society:
they are forced to: act white.”
Martin said. ‘‘They lose their
identity and are subjected
to continual, subtle discrim-
inations.

“The Black Separatist mo
vement is an attempt by
black students to establish
an identity.” he said ‘The
movement is forcing the col
leges 10 reexamine them
selves after they find out
that merely integrating a
few black people into a racist
structure is no way to solve
‘racial problems.

Davidson College is acquir
quiring a black community
at a time when much chan.
ge seems imminent in pat
terns and attitudes on cam-
pus. A new college president,
who has had to face the Code
of Responsibility and the
mechanics of the Blue Sky
Curriculum, will soon have
to face the coming of the
Negro.

President Samuel_R. Spen-
cer Jr. admitted that he
would not try to predict the
rmpact of greater Negro en-
rollment. “It would) be im
possible to say.” he said.
“Relationships are in flux,
nationally and locally.”

Spencer listed advantages
and disadvantages for the
Negro student at Davidson.

“Davidson can offer, as a
small college, relative ease
in establishing personal rela-
tionships and identities. We-
are, of course. going to give
everyone the best education
we can.-Negro students have
much to contribute.”

There are disadvantages
which are not inconsiderable.
“This school.’ said Spencer.
“in a small, southern town,
and with a college social life
that is. highly stylized and-
‘traditional, will offer special
problems to black students,
or any new diversity in the.
student body. It appears that
we are going to have to face
these problems soon."

One of the presidential
commissions, the Social Pat.
terns Commission, has been
studying the social problems
of Negro students at David-
son. Committee chairman ,
C.. Shaw Smith said, ““We've
not been able to reach any
definite recommendations

that. it's hard to say where

looking forward to a larger

blems of black students as a
group have been ignored here

419-To-110 Vote
Ends Squabbling

By JOE SMITH
Staff Writer

Recent action by various
facets of the SGA has result-
ed in apparent settlement of
Davidson's constitutional cri.
sis and has set-in motion a
proposal which would allow
scholarship students to have
cars on campus.

The constitutional issue was
settled by a vote of the stu-
dent body, thus bringing to
a close dispute which has
continued over _ several
months.

By vote of 419 to 110, the
students approved a group of
amendments which remov-
ed the entire student judicial

system from the constitution,
both the Honor Court and the
highly contested Court of
Appeals being removed.
This action was favored by
SGA President Peter Hobbie.
maintained that the
Court of Appeals is not neces-
sary under the present con-
stitutional situation.

The amendments also
provided for the return of the
old system of constitutional
amendment.

The Senate meeting last
Tuesday approved a report
which recommends _ that
scholarship students be al-
lowed to keep cars on cam-
pus.
