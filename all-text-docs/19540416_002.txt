Complacency Is Reverse Side Ot
Cynicism, Both Extremes Bad

Last week in this column we spoke of Davidson cynicism,
this week let us briefly examine the other side of the coin.
By this we mean the attitude of complacency that has appeared
from time to time here at Davidson among students and also
amoung faculty and administration.

Perhaps the cynicism among the upperclassmen is partly
the product of disillusionment about the Davidson so perfectly
painted by alumni, faculty, friends and some students of the
college. Some of us remember that as freshmen we received
the impression that Davidson College had definitely “arrived”
in the broadest sense of the word. This indoctrinated feeling
of security in our situation led in many cases to the same
sort of complacency about the past, present and future stand-
ing of this college that seemed to be held by many of those
connected with it. Davidson appeared to be more of a standard
to conform to than a college in which we ourselves had the
opportunity of continuously shaping and of improving. We
sometimes forgot, and continue to forget, that this college
regardless of its noble tradition and heritage, is not better
at any given moment, than its student body, faculty and ad-
ministration at that moment. Tradition is wonderful, we agree,
but left to stand alone it is less than nothing.

Davidson is part of a state, an area, and a nation in a state
of flux. While holding to the things we deem essential, the
college must also adopt itself to a changing society in preparing
its students for life. Davidson has been a relatively successful
college, not because it is Davidson, but because it is doing a
job, and doing it well.

While students are often critical of many aspects of the
college about which we have grown cynical, we are uncon-
cernedly complacent or indifferent about the kind of educa-
tion we are getting. We point to past records and affirm that
Davidson is a fine school academically, but complain that
too little thought is taken of the students’ present well-being.

Perhaps now is tke time to think a little less of our
present comfort and direct our concern toward our prepara-
tion for the future and toward the future of the college. We
need to be less conscious of ourselves as students and Jess
complacent about the more fundamental question of future
citizenship.

Present student cynicism is due partially to too much
complacency in low places and high, but an informed and
concerned student attitude can help moderate both extremes.
Let us hear no more of Davidson’s being a “land of milk and
honey,” which it is not. Students should be made to feel they
are parts of an institution in the process of constant change
and improvement, but with many short-comings—not that
they are in the best of all possible schools to which they
must absolutely conform.

Chorus Not Without Honor,
Except On Davidson Campus

Even as a prophet is not without honor except in his own
country, so also the Davidson College Male Chorus is not with-
out honor except on its own campus.

For a long time we have felt, along with many others,
that the Male Chorus, and the Concert Band for that matter,
are a good bit above the run-of-the-mill in so far as collegiate
musical organizations are concerned. But we have pretty much
taken them for granted, and other than at vespers and occa-
sionally in chapel have never taken the time to hear them at
work.

Last week the Chorus, after having returned from a suc-
cessful northern tour, gave a concert in Chambers Auditorium
They had a small but receptive audience, less than half of
whom were students. This writer, like the vast majority of
students, was absent. It seems to be a sort of tradition that we
do not attend chorus and band concerts by the local groups.

Despite the fact that most of the student body evidently
does not appreciate the quality of the chorus enough to volun-
tarily attend its concerts, there are some who do. In the
Thursday morning edition of the Charlotte Observer appeared
the critic’s review of the Davidson Male Chorus concert. The
Observer writer praised the chorus literally to the skies,
comparing it more than favorably with similar groups from
Princeton and Dartmouth, and obviously inferring its
superiority.

Reprinted on Page 4 is the Observer's review of the re-
cent concert. If it is an accurate representation, most of the

student body missed an opportunity to hear one of the finest
college choral groups in America.

To Testify Against Themselves?

The several amendments to the
Student Body Constitution pro-
posed last Friday came at a time
when feeling was running high on
the recent case involving the ex-
pulsion of five students from
school for drinking on campus,
and I do not doubt that the stu-
dents who drew up the proposed
changes did so with the belief that
a tightened-up constitution would
result in a much better student
government.

Nevertheless there are several
questions which arise upon the
consideration of the proposed
amendments, only part of which
were read to the student body at
their presentation by Bob Crutch-
field last Friday in chapel.

The main question which I would
raise, and the one I believe to be
the most fundamental in the light
of the recent drinking case: is
whether an accused student should
be made to testify against himself.
This was one of the big issues in
the recent case before the coun-
cil, and one which the fifth pro-
posed amendment would: seek to
make explicit. This is the text of
the proposed amendment:

“Every student called as 0
witness before the Student
Government shall give full
testimony in answer to all
relevent questions. Every stu-
dent who fails to comply with
this provision shall be required
to withdraw from college.”

As interpreted to this writer by
author Crutchfield, this is meant
to include testimony against him-
self by the accused.

The arguments usually presented
in favor of this procedure, which
would be contrary to one of the
most fundamental principles of
American justice, usually proceed
along either or both of two lines:
A student should be “honor-bound”
to testify against himself where he
is the defendant in the case, be:

By BICK ROPER

cause our system of student gov-
ernment, and the fact that students
are supposed to be Christian gentle-
men, make this mandatory. The
other is that an accused should be
required to testify against himself
since attendance here is a privil-
ege enjoyed at the sufferance of
the college.

The first argument—concerning
persona] honor—would be a valid
one if honor were the only basis
upon which alleged violations of
the honor code and student body
regulations were tried. If it is to
be assumed that all accused stu-
dents will on the basis of honor
tell the truth when questioned
about an alleged offense, then
there is no use for a court except
to question the accused. ©

As it is, however, every para-
graph of the student body consti-
tution concerning trials (Article
IX, Section 5) indicates that al-
leged offenses are to be conducted
along the lines of a regular court
trial, in which both material
evidence and testimony of wit-
nesses are to be used against the
accused.

One of the most fundamen-
tal principles of the United
States Constitution—and one
which is very much in the
news today in connection with
Senator McCarthy's tactics—
is thet part of the Fifth
Amendment which states that
“No person... shall be com-
pelled in eny criminal cate to
be « witness against him-
self...”

The similarity to our own situa-
tion is clear. We follow standard
court procedure as far as presenta-
tion of evidence against the ac-
cused, and trial and judgment by
his peers are concerned, but when
we get to the point where the ac-
cused is conceded a right, We deny
it. 1 do not call this justice in
any sense of the word.

Letter to Editor:

Red Cross Thanks D. C.
For Blood Contributed

Dear Davidsonian Editor:
It is always a pleasure and

instigated at Davidson in 1950,
contributions have totaled 2,967
pints, including 277 collected on
April ist and 2nd, Although former
visits have produced greater
amounts of blood than this recent
one, we feel that the result of
this visit was good due to the fact
that typhoid shots had been given
which rendered many donors in-
eligible, and that emphasis has
shifted from the military to the
civilian program which is not as
vital to young men of college age.

The 277 pints donated by David-
son students and faculty the first
of April will help immeasurably in
alleviating suffering in our local
hospitals as well as providing

blood for the Defense Department
for fractionation into serum albu-
men and gamma globulin. Members
of Scabbard and Blade and ODK
deserve special recognition for the
splendid job they did on interpre-
tation and recruitment § which
brought in the donors. Having a
person such as Colonel Davis co-
ordinate the program and plans is
always most helpful, so we were
very sorry to hear that this may
be his last year at the college. We
hope that his successor will have
as much enthusiasm for and in-
terest in the Blood Program as
Colonel Davis has displayed.

We thank you for the privilege
of bringing thé Bloodmobile to Da-
vidson and would like, through you,
to express appreciation to your
donors there for>their splendid
response and participation.

JOHN L. STEWART, Chairman
Mobile Units Division
Blood Donor Recruitment

It should thus be obvious that
to require the accused to testify
against himself and at the same
time conduct his trial according to
the basic rules of a criminal court
trial is both inconsistent and un-
just.

I maintain that the requirement
of testimony against himself by
the accused is fine as long as the
personal honor of the accused him-
self is the only basis upon which
a judgment jis to be made. That is,
a witness should be called before
the council and asked point-blank
whether he is guilty of the charge,
and the judgment made according
to his answer.

But if the accused is to be prose-
cuted and have material evidence
and testimony of other witnesses
presented against him, then he cer.
tainly should not be required to
testify against himself. If it is as-
sumed that the accused will tell
the truth as to whether or not he
is guilty, then there is no need
to have evidence and witnesses;
if it is not assumed he will give
a truthful answer, then the proce-
dure followed should be one pro-
vided for in the present Student

OFF-MOORINGS:

FRIDAY, APRIL 16, 1964

Writer Sees No Cure All
In Crutchfield Amendments

With emotionalism and innuendo,
with great anti-faculty and anti-
administration feeling, with false-
etto phrases and vague generali-
ties—with all this were the pro-
posed amendments to the Student
Body Constitution presented in
last Friday’s chapel.

Not only are Bob Crutchfield’s
amendments to the Constitution
full of legal, logical, and func-
tional holes but also and most im-
portantly one of them is illegal.

I mean illegal in the sense that
it goes against the laws of the
State of North Carolina. This I will
shortly prove.

Like Harter

The group which Crutchfield
represents is much like a similar
group that was on the campvfs two
years ago and which had as its
spokesman Lee Harter.

Then the issue was the lack of
genuine politics here. Harter’s sin-
cere desire to make the elections
a more vital part of student life
led him to advocate, and to win,
mandatory chapel speeches by the
principal candidates.

Today, as then, the proposals of-
fered oversimplify greatly the prob-
lems involved and attempt to find
a solution through the pet ideas
of too restricted and unrepresenta-
tive a group as has brought them
forth.

The fact that Harter’s proposals
were adopted, or even that the
current ones might be adopted,
does not of itself prove that the
problem is solved.

All that it does show is that a
disciplined, highly organized, and
energetic group can overthrew the
rational will of the whole when
they use all the tools of
emotional attack, organizational
weakness, and general apathy to
serve their own ends.

The Problem

Few students or faculty men will
deny that there is a growing aware
ness of the need for a stronger,
more definite, and more workable
interpretation of the Honor Sys-
tem at Davidson.

There are some who think the
present set-up can be strengthened
of itself through the recognition
on the part of the elected repre-
sentatives of their role in admin-
istering the Honor System.

One man put it this way: “The
Student Council just hasn’t had the
guts to enforce its own rules.”
This may well be.

By the means of the panacea
answer that is proposed, it is sup-
posed that through giving another
name to a special jygiciary group
and through relegating the trial
of honor violations to this group,
then honor will be restored to the
campus and all cases will be de-

cided with equity, with speed, and| It says:

without bothering any wiser or
more experienced heads.

The assumption is false on two
major counts. (1) Because all these
judges are elected positions, you
will not get another “type of stu-
dent," ds it has been phrased, in
those offices. Thus the same sort
of thinking that has prevailed in
the Student Council in the past
would continue in the Honor Coun-
cil—only then with more force and
less reason. (2) Merely by the ex-
pedite of changing a name and
restricting a function, you will not
thus change the actions of the
men in the group, when the char-
acter of the men has not changed.

It bas been asserted that stu-
dents have lost or will in the
future lose faith in the Honor
System. The men who advocate
the changes do not themselves say
they have lost faith in honor at
Davidson. They seem to say they
are speaking for other students
and for the future of Davidson.

Yet I have it on the best
authority that no one—student or
otherwise—in the last three years
has said to any member of the
Student Council he was losing his
trust in our Honor System.

Do the facts back up the as-
sertion of lost faith? I have seen no
wholesale cheating going on in any
of the classes I attend. The atti-
tudes of students I know does not
seem to be one of a turning away
from honor.

We might look to the Student
Council record itself. There has
been no noticeable change in the].
past few years, nor in
months, in the number of cases
being tried under the Honor Sys-
tem.

There is little validity in the
charge itself when it is reviewed
in the light of the actual facts.
There is some fear for the future,
and in the past there has been
some great passing of the buck
where final judgment is concerned.

The Need

There is a definite need for a
full investigation, analysis and
possibly some changes made in the
Honor System.

At this time there is no need
for the adoption of a halfway
action which does not solve the
problems, which would serve only
to jam the logical channels of the
administration of justice,

student government.

Ilegal
Earlier I said that one of the
Proposed changes is illegal and
this can easily be verified.
The first amendment is the one
that openly violates the state law.
