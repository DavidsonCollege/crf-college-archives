Honor Court Names Four Preps Leafer And Marshall

Rowe As Recorder Fc Concert Fill Out IFC Posts

The Interfraternity Coun-
cil, with newly-elected mem-
bers voting for the first time
Monday night, elected Kap-
pa Sig Johnny Rogers as
next year’s president to suc-
ceed Beta Bob Waugh.

Phi Gam Larry Leafer was
the only other person nominated
for president by the council, and
in a secret ballot vote Rogers
came out the winner. The IFC
president is the official repre-
sentative for the council in its
dealings with all outsiders.

Leafer was the winner in the
election for secretary, defeating
ATO Frank Stafford and. Phi
Delt Bob Marshall. Leafer takes
over his post from Wyche Fow-
ler, a position that is, on the
IFC, a combination of vice-presi-
dent and secretary. The IFC
secretary presides in the ab-
sence of the president, keeps
records of all meetings, and
handles the file of all records
and reports.

Marshall and Stafford were
the nominees for treasurer,
with Marshall being elected as

| successor to Clay Atkins.

him. “Sometimes I shiver when

Birch CoordinatorBlasts
Governmental Controls

BY BILL RUTH
Davidsonian Assistant Editor
Last Monday, the “Thunder

on the Right” placed its bronze
cannon on the Davidson campus
in the person of Arthur Lyons,
North Carolina Coordinator of
The John Birch Society.

In his chapel talk, Lyons drew
supporting comments from the
Bible and the oft quoted lines
of Patrick Henry, “Give me lib-
erty or give me death.” He
praised the “ideals and ordeals”
of JBS members and their
“dedication to Christian prin-
ciples.” He called for “less gov-
ernment at all levels, thus a
better world.”

EISENHOWER - TRAITOR

At the coffee hour several
more Birchers appeared, nestl-
ed close to the directive right
wing of Coordinator Iyons. As
questioning began, Lyons was

called upon to qualify his state.

sition on such grounds is like
saying: “My mind is made up.
Now don’t confuse me with the
facts.”

On March 22, 1961, L. Mendel
Rivers, Congressman from South
Carolina and recent speaker at
Davidson, rose in defense of
the John Birch Society on the
floor of the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives. Congressman Riv-
ers was on campus early this
year to express his views on
conservative issues.

ment that Former-President Ei-
senhower was a traitor to his
country. He proceded to define
traitor as one who either delib-
erately or unknowingly gives aid
and comfort to the enemy.

As for the origin of the name
of the Society, Lyons explained
that John Birch was a young
Christian missionary to China
who as a result of 400 bayonet
wounds in the head, died a
martyr to the cause against the
spread of Communism — the
first American casualty in a
third world war.”

SOCIETY ATTACKED

The Birch Society has been at-
tacked by such prominent pub-
lications as Time magazine for
its very radical views and ap-
proaches to the issue of Com
munist infiltration in American
schools and church organiza-
tions. Robert Welch, founder of
the Society, suggests that oppo-

In Rivers’ Congressional Dis-
trict of Charleston, South .Caro-
lina, the News and Courier
printed the following: “Com-
munism' has few admitted
friends in America. But none
of its enemies are more dogged,
determined, or down-right hos-
tile than are the members of the
John Birch Society.” Such was
Lyon's roar.

SINGING THE BLUES’ favorite tune is Arthur Lyons, N.C.
Coordinator for the John Birch Society. After a talk in assembly
Monday, the Birch official faced a large squad of student and
faculty questioners, who drew forth the statement about Dwight
Eisenhower, “a traitor to his country.” And the walves a
