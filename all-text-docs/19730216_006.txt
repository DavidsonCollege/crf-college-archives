Take two years off

this Summer.

With the Army ROTC Two-Year Program.

Army ROTC usually takes four years of college. But
you can do it 1n two.

If, for example, you couldn’t take Army ROTC
during your first two years of college.

Or if you just didn’t want to take Army ROTC before.
But now you recognize the benefits.

You start the Two-Year Program by going to our
six-week Basic Camp the summer following your sophomore year.

Camp —a little classroom work; some challenging
physical training—replaces the Basic Course you would have
taken during your first two years of college. You’re well-paid for
this six-week catch-up.

Then, after camp, you complete your Advanced
Course during your junior and senior years.

Maybe you'll decide that the chance to get real
management experience earlier than most people will be worth
a lot later on.

Maybe you can use the $100 per month subsistence
allowance you will get for up to 10 months of each school year.

Maybe qualifying for two careers simultaneously —
military or civilian—is insurance against job uncertainties. “
