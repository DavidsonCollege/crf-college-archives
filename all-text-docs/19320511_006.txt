is highly recommended: It is a complete, con-
Icise, compact dictionary of synonyms and an-
itonymse’which will furnish that searched-tor
|word at the right time and with very little
| trouble.

There have been many such dictionaries pub-
lished, but they have been, as a rule, so large
and unwieldy as to make them of no real value.
3ut this new publication of Noble and Noble
is the last word in conciseness, and proves of
invaluable aid to those who desire a larger and
more varied vocabulary.

In addition to the likes and opposites, there
are special sections devoted to automobile and
radio terms not found in the ordinary diction-
ary.

For anyone who does any amount of writing
such a book is an absolute necessity, and there
have been none published which can equal the
completeness and compactness of this work by
Mr. Adams. And the cost is very low for such
an effective aid to good writing ‘and correct
speech. It costs only $1.25.
