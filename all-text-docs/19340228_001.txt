DAVIDSON COLLEGE, DAVIDSON, N. C., FEBRUARY 28, 1934

No. 19

Davidson Trustees Hold
Semi-Annual Meeting Feb. 21

Treasurer Reports That College
Has Weathered Depression
Without Deficit

R. O. T. C. IS MODIFIED

Committee Appropriates $25,000
to Repair Dormitories

The trustees of Davidson College, in
their semi-annual meeting here. on
February 21, made several important
decisions, chief among them being the
modification of the compulsory fea-
ture of R. O. T. C. Thirty-four trus-
tees, from the states of North Caro-
lina, Florida, South Carodina, and New
York, were present for the session.

The abolition of compulsory military
training has settled a question which
has long been a source of discussion.
Henceforth, students will be excused
from military training if written re-
quests are received from their parents.
These requests should be in the hands
of the registrar prior to the opening
of college, and in no case shall they
be made more than ten days after the
opening of college. However, the rul-
ing passed by the trustees states that
“when a student enters the course of
military training he is obliged to take
the course for two years unless he is
excused for physical reasons or by the
Military Department of the United
States.” This modification was rec-
ommended to the trustees by Dr. Wal-
ter L. Lingle, president of Davidson
College. 4

The faculty committee on grounds
and buildings was authorized to spend
$25,000 for repairing and refinishing
dormitories, and for the construction
of walks. Plans for the refinishing of
the dormitories include painting of the
walls, the reflooring of one dormitory
and general repairs where necessary.
No definite plans have been released
as yet by the faculty.

The trustees met Wednesday morn-
ing at 10 o'clock, at which time reports
from the president and treasurer were
heard. Mr. F. L. Jackson’s report in-
dicated that the college has passed
through the years of the depression
without a deficit and that the present
year, ending April 30, will also be com-

Quips And Cranks
Progressing Rapidly

List of Individual Senior Activi-
ties Being Compiled

The editorial staff of “Quips and
Cranks,” the Davidson College year
book, if now trying to obtain as ac-
curate a list of individual senior activi-
ties as possible. Editor Jack Williams
therefore urges all seniors who have
not done so to turn in their activities
slips to Bob Smith at the first oppor-
tunity.

These slips, uniformly printed, were
distributed in chapel last week and in-
clude: the college course taken; any
clubs or organizations (such as fra-
ternities) of which the man might be
a member; the various committees, so-
cial or otherwise, on which he has
served during his four years here; any
class honors he might have won; all
athletic or other extra - currcula
achievements.

When asked if Junior
would be included as is sometimes
done, Editor Williams said: “Inas-
much as Junior Activities are not com-
plete as a rule, it has been decided
not to insclude them this year, the
space they would have occupied being
used to make room for larger pictures.’
Williams also stated that no space
would be given to individual mottoes
for seniors.

Bob Smith is in charge of compil-
ing the senior activities, and the im-
portance of getting all lists handed in
promptly is emphasized by both him
and the editor.

The Annual staff is also occupied
with the making up of the pages for
the various social and honorary fra-
ternities and honorary clubs. This
work, according to Williams, is pro-
gressing as rapidly as may be expected.

Williams stated, however, that sev-
eral clubs and societies have not defi-
nitely decided the amount of space
they want to have in the Annual, and
urges that these clubs decide at their
next meeting exactly how much space
they will want this year.

Pfohl Makes Good
As Head of Music

His Work Here Attracts Public
Recognition

His ability in organizing and con-
ducting the various musical organiza-
tions of the campus has brought to
Prof. James C. Pfohl, Davidson musical
head, public recognition, as attested by
recent articles appearing in the Char-
lotte Observer and the Charlotte News.

Many interesting facts as to Profes-
sor Pfohl’s | musical career were
brought out, among them his inher-
itance of a pronounced musical talent
from a very musical family, his envir-
onment, and the personality of the
man himself. His father, Bishop J. K.
Pfohl of the Home Moravian Church
in Winston-Salem, is a talented musi-
cian, as are his mother, two sisters,
and two brothers. The environment
of a home and church where music is
so greatly stressed has undoubtedly
left its influence upon the man, and
the opportunity afforded by a_ well-
rounded musical education (Pfohl hav-
ing studied music at Salem, U. N. C.,,
and the University of Michigan School
of Music) has been used to the best
advantage—so say the newspapers and
those who have been associated with
the college’s music.

Large Number Enter
Gymnastic Contest

The annual gymnastic tournament at
Davidson is now in its final stages with
some forty men competing for the ath-
letic trophies which are given every
year to the individuals making the
highest number of points in the pre-
scribed events The contest ‘started
Wednesday, February 19, and will con-
tinue through Saturday, March 3.

This year there are _ forty-two
events in which students may compete.
Each of these events is under one of
five big heads, namely: the parallel
bar, the horse, tumbling, condition, and
the horizontal bar. Points are award-
ed to the student displaying the best
form and completing the ©greatest
number of events.

The men placing among the first
will each be awarded an athletic med-
al instead of a cup as was given last
year. Leaders in the contest so far
are -L. O. McPhail, J. L. Shirey, C. G.
Smith, R. T. Banks, L. E. Quarterman,
and H. A. Wilson.

The tournament is sponsored each
year as a part of intramural sports and
the trophies are awarded from a fund
allotted for that particular purpose.
This year the contests are under the
direction of Lacy Adcox, who, in the
tournament held last year, won the
trophy for having the best record in
the gymnastic events.

More men have enrolled in the tour-
nament this year: than did in the 1933
competition, particularly among the
freshmen, but Adcox hopes to see even
more before the contest ends. Even if
the students do not expect to win the
trophy, they should come out, as this
will aid their respective classes in their
record of points for intramural sports.

Yow! Will Appear
About April First

Number of Year

At a recent meeting of the “ Yow!"
staff, it was announced that the next
issue would appear around the first
of April. This will be the last issue
this year, but will contain forty-six
pages, instead of the usual thirty-two.

This issue will be in the nature of
a Graduation number and will be fea-
tured by a poll of the Senior class.
The poll will consist of twenty ques-
tions concerning phases of campus life
and preferences of the .graduates-to-
be. The questionnaire contains such
questions as: “What have you gained
from your four years at Davidson?”
and “Which is the easiest course on
the Hill?” The seniors are asked to
state their favorites as to sports, or-
chestras, etc.

The “ Yow!" will have its usual fea-
tures and also short stories and one-
act plays. The increased size of the
magazine will provide room for more
literary work. Sigma Upsilon, honor-
ary literary fraternity, has been co-
operating in the line of literary en-
deavor.

“Skip” Brown will draw the cover
for the next issue, which will probably
have to do with graduation, and Tom
Wood is at work at clever caricatures
of student leaders.

The “ Yowl” has been under a finan-
cial handicap this year due to the loss
of color charges from cigarette adver-
tisers when they adopted the national
advertising system, Despite this, the
magazine has kept up its usual qual-
ty. All contributions should be in the
hands of the editor or one of the man-
aging editors by the 20th of March.

been definitely selected.

In order that the “ Davidsonian”
readers may have before them exactly
what was said concerning compulsory
military training at Davidson College
at the meeting of the trustees here
last Wednesday, this paper carries be-
low that part of President W. L.
Lingle’s annual report to the trustees
which relates to the R. O. T. C.

The report recommends that in the
future administration of R. QO. T.,C.
at Davidson those students be excused
from military training whose parents
or guardians so request, and also gives
the president’s reasons for the recom-
mendation, which was approved by the
trustees.

The entire report is:

Freshman Smoker

According to E. L. Powell, sen-
ior Counsellor of Freshmen, a
freshman smoker will be held
Friday night of this week in the
banquet hall of Chambers.

At this time Professor J. P.
Williams, dean of freshmen, as-
sisted by some member of the
Senior class, will talk to the
freshmen on discipline and class
affairs.

son will be present at this meet-
ing to discuss matters of impor-
tance with the group.

A program is expected to be
inaugurated at this time in which
the several classes will work in
more perfect harmony. There is
also probability that a date will
be set for the removal of fresh-
man caps.
