THE DAVIDSONIAN

Dugan ready to go

By MIcuakt J. KRUSE

Quarterback Tommy Dugan
finally has the green light.

After two seasons of starting
most of the time, but not all of the
time, the redshirt junior — a tre-
mendous athlete who has had
marked flashes of brilliance in his
up-and-down Davidson career —
heads into Saturday’s season opener
against Maryville at Richatdson

three games in 1996, the 6-foot-3,
195-pound Gaithersburg, Md., na-
tive compiled 897 yards of total
offense, including 623 through the
air on 41-of-78 passing efficiency.

Not coincidentally, all three

contests were Davidson wins, as '

the Wildcats posted their first win-
ning season since 1993 and gained
momentum heading into this, the
school’s 100th’ year of intercolle-
giate football.

“A lot of people look at it that

Field as coach Tim Landis’ defini-
tive No. 1.

“Tom’s the starter,” the fifth-
year coach said last month during

training camp. “He deserves to
come into camp as the starter.”

Matt Strader and Shaun
Tyrance represent more-than-ca-
pable relief if needed, but, for now
at least, the Wildcat quarterbacking
duties are Dugan’s to lose.

“This is the first year he
(Landis) has ever given that to me,”
Dugan said this week. “This year,
he’s let me know from the begin-
ning that I was No. 1, and I think
‘that’s helped me a lot.”

As did his stretch-run perfor-
mance last season. Over the final

“The line
was
blocking right, the defenses were
keyed in on the running backs, and
they just let me run.”

Andrun he did, picking up 274
yards on just 40 carries — good for
a hefty 6.8 yards an attempt.

Overall, Dugan led the squad
in total offense last season with
1,791 yards, 1,456 of which came
via the pass. With that performance
and 2,391 career yards passing, he
now stands as the 10th-most pro-
lific passer in Davidson history.

With Dugan at the helm, the
Wildcats’ offense is talented, expe-
rienced — a crucial entity the team
has often lacked in the past few
years — and ready to pick up where
it left off last November.

“We did not play as well as I
had hoped, but there were some
bright spots,” said head coach Lisa
Marston ina press release. “We had
alot of unforced errors, but they are
things that we can work on and
improve.”

That improvement will be
needed soon, as the Wildcats begin
conference play at Furman Wednes-
day. The Paladins finished third, in
the league last sd&son.
