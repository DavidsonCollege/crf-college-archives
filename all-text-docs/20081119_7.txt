Speed 3: Terrorists
Hijack Keanu
Reeves’s Career

HOLLY WOOD - Keanu Reeves
has disarmed a bus. He has dis-
armed a cruise ship. Now he must
disarm himself. Two weeks ago,
terrorists kidnapped the LA actor
and strapped a bomb in his pants,
wired to explode if he makes fewer
than three movies a year.

Sicne then Reeves has been
tormented by maniacal ex-actor
Dennis Hopper, who calls nightly
with the same perverse pop-quiz:
“There’s a bomb in your pants,
Keanu. What do you do?”

tie Z 5
In Speed H!: Reeves Control, the
actor will blow up if he makes
fewer than three movies per vear.

Now, in a deadly game of cat-
and-mouse between two former
co-stars, the future of Hollywood
is on the line. Will Keanu put the
pedal to the metal and churn out six
more Matrix movies? Will he take
a detour through indie cinema? Or
will he slam things into reverse and
backtrack to the days of Bill and
Ted’s Bogus Journey?

The stunts, including Keanu
leaping from B-movie to B-movie
while trying to disarm the bomb in
his pants, are out of this world. This
out-of-control star vehicle is the
runaway hit of the holiday season.
Get ready for rush hour.

Obama to Bail Out Failing
Detroit Football Industry

Due to financial cutbacks, Detroit Lions wide receiver Roy Williams was
one of eleven players forced to play Sunday's game without a helmet.

For many, the now 0-10 Detroit,
Lions are the glue that holds this
nation’s prized football industry
together. If Detroit fails, the entire
NFL will be affected by what could
be the worst athletic spillover crisis
since Shaq came out of his spandex
in the 1997 conference semifinals.

“The entire NFL would
be affected by the worst
athletic spillover crisis
since Shaq came out of
his spandex in the 1997
conference semifinals.”

President-elect Obama _ sees
opportunity in Detroit’s incredible
ability to appear as though they
haven’t seen or touched a football

in their 74-year history. “Can we
watch them drop every pass and
constantly miss tackles? Yes we
can. Can we observe them throw-
ing interceptions and having field
goal attempts fall 30-yards short?
Yes we can. And although, to be
perfectly honest, this is not the sort
of change we can really believe in,
you have to feel bad for anyone who
is that awful at something,” Obama
commented at a rally Tuesday.

Many worry that with the col-
lapse of Detroit, the entire football
industry would fold, leaving thou-
sands without employment.

The Detroit Lions also received
a $10 giftcard to Sports Authority
from former Detroit Mayor Kwame
Kilpatrick, who commented, “Yeah,
1 screwed up, but holy &*%$ do
they suck at their job.”

English Professor
Learning to Write

After publishing 23 articles in

JSTOR and other scholarly jour-
nals, Professor of English David
McDermott decided it was time
he learned to write a coherent sen-
tence. “I’ve been meaning to learn
since grad school,” he said. “Just
never really got around to it.”

“I'd been meaning
to learn since grad
school, and just nev-
er got around to it.”

The author of such articles as
“Liminality and the Hegelian Dia-
lectic in the Post-Colonial Lens”
and “Deconstructing Structuralist
Semiotics,” McDermott is auditing
two 101 W courses. “Diagramming
sentences is really hard,” said the
professor who earned a doctorate
in Psuedo-Transgendered Studies
from Columbia University.

“We're being taught how to
avoid our articles being written in
the passive voice,” he said. “An-
other fundamental lesson has been
to not loquaciously write long-
winded sentences saturated with so
many adjectives that the meaning is
obscured, dangling or ambiguous
modifiers being bad as well.”

McDermott says the Writing
Center, supervised by senior Eng-
lish majors, has been an “invalu-
able resource.” “They’ ve taught me
to avoid clichés and just write from
the heart. With my first novel I re-
ally do think I’m finding myself.”
