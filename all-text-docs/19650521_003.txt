TEARS AND CHEERS

Another year passes, and now is the time to
look back with tearful eyes and nostalgia on the
glories that were.

I can’t force myself to do it . . . guess I’m just
too choked up with emotion.

Instead of trying to summon up sparkling phras-
es from my golden pen to immortalize this past year
of Davidson sports, I choose the easy way out, sta-
tistics.

Figures show the best won-lost percentage of
the year to be Coach Whittle’s tracksters, with a
5-0 dual meet record. However, few will contend
they represent the bright spot of the season. Lefty’s
basketballers stand alone in that respect, even dwarf-
ing Coach Fogleman’s Southern Conference tennis
champions.

In ten intercollegiate sports this. year Davidson
varsity teams have compiled a 92-57-2 mark. Only
three sports chalked up losing records.

-Enough’s said—see for yourself.

No math major, I still figure that comes to a
.617 won-lost percentage, which is not so bad in any

league.
Spring sports

have just finished. With one ex-

ception (to prevent being spiked to death or clubbed
with a bat, I won’t mention which one it is) spring
was a pretty successful season, sports-wise.

Wednesday. commenting on (most of) the s ring
records Coach Whittle remarked, “This is pro ably
one of the best (spring records) we’ve had.

Nearby Coach Fogleman smiled, “Just good

leadership.”

Anything else this year would be anti-climatic.

Teamwise, Furman took first
place in the meet, compiling a
total of 67 points. West Virginia
came in second, running up 57
points. VMI placed third with
38 team points.

Of individual events, Davidson
Track Coach Heath Whittle
seemed to be well pleased. ‘‘We
had several boys who turned in
fine performances. Turner,
Tommy Heffner, Ronnie Reese
and a few others all really did
a good job for us.”

Turner competed in four
events, two individual sprints
and two relays with his David-
son teammates. He took first in
both sprints. the 100-yard dash
(9-8) and the 220-yard dash
(22.0). Turner was the individ-
ual high scorer of the meet,
with a total of 11% points. His
sizzling 22.0 seconds in the 220
broke the previous conference
record of 22.2 held by Al Sher-
man of William and Mary.

Heffner turned in the best
time of his career in the mile
with a 4:22, taking fourth place
in that event.

In a preliminary heat on Fri-
day, Reese broke the old school
record in the 880. He finished in
1:55.6, which shattered the old
Davidson mark of 1:57.2, but
still failed to qualify for the fi-
nals.

The SAEs, Pikas and Phi

softball, volleyball, and tennis,
as they dominated the play in
IMAC action this week. The
only other fraternity with a
chance for one of these crowns
is the Phi Gams, who held on to
a position in the volleyball tour-

In softball, the SAE’s clinched
the title with a tear-jerking 6-4

Fogleman Views His Career

By TOM COOK

Davidsonian Sports Writer

Harry Fogleman is a man
with tennis on his mind. Since
graduation from Duke. tennis
has been a way of life for him.
His contributions to tennis in
general and to tennis at David-
son in particular have earned
him the respect of the nation as
a leading tennis authority.

Coach Fogleman began his
long association with tennis at
Duke where he stayed after
graduation for seven years,
coaching tennis and soccer and
teaching physical education. He

assisted in the supervision of
Air Force physical training dur-
ing his World War II service of
42 months..,

Resuming his teaching career
at the University of Florida
where he earned a MA in phys-
ical education, he coached the
‘Gator tennis team for three
years. One of his teams was
ranked fifth in the nation and
won the Southeastern Confer-
ence championship.

The lure of a great opportun-
ity led Coach Fogleman to re-
turn to Cincinnati to enter busi-
ness for himself as a manufac-

Top Pick:

David Moser Signs

Davidson's hopes for another fantastic freshman bas-
ketball quintet brightened even more as Coach “Lefty”
Driesell enlisted Hoosier star David Moser to his serv-

ices.

Moser. a 6-0, 165 pound back-
court star for Northside High
School, signed a grant-in-aid last
Monday to play at Davidson.

Coach Driesell, in describing
his prize catch, said, “He's a
good ball handler, a great feed-
er and has a good outside shot.
He’s ranked No. 2 in Indiana,
so that proves he’s tough.”

To back up Coach Driesell’s
praise, Moser has compiled
quite an -eye-catching record.
He was all-city and all-section-
al for two years, and last year
was voted all-state and Player

area. He averaged 16.5 points a
game with a 52.4 percentage

When the opportunity presented
itself, Fogleman. assumed the

versity of Cincinnati where he
won two Missouri Valley Con-
ference titles in six years.

DAVIDSON

Desiring to return to North
Carolina, Coach Fogleman ar-
rived on the Davidson campus
in the fall of 1961.

Besides the Davidson coach-
ing duties in tennis and soccer
and in physical education, Coach
Fogleman is a member of the
technical staff of A.G. Spalding
and Bros. sporting goods enter-
prise. His duties include mer-
chandising and testing of Spald-
ing’s top rackets which he helps
design.

During his association with
Spalding. the guinea pig of
Spalding has been the Davidson
tennis team, testing new types
of rackets, shoes and tennis gut.
Fogleman has also written sev-
eral books on tennis.

Asked why Davidson plays 25
matches instead of the usual
number of 15 played by most
schools, Coach Fogleman ex-
plained a bit of his tennis philos-
ophy.

“My feeling is that the boys
get tired of playing each other.
So many coaches do nothing but
just throw the balls onto the
court, that practice turns into
drudgery. 25 matches is 25 op-
portunities to pit yourself up
against other players and meet
people in the process. I have

rdmored to play for fun, met
up with an even more unfortu-
nate team, the once powerful
Kappa Sigs. on Monday. The
Betas feared a terrible beating,
but alas, the Sigs could not even
field a complete team.

Fred Hetzel’s pitching arm
was not up to scratch and Gross
Compton couldn't handle the
whole left side of the infield by
himself. Even Phil Hightower’s
late arrival was not enough to
spark the Sigs and the Betas,
led by Ed Haselden, who went
zero for five, won it 18-17 in the
bottom of the seventh. But vic-
tory was too bitter and the
Betas dropped a close one 6-2,
to the SPE’s yesterday.

In volleyball action this week,
the big news was the failure of
the Kappa _ Sigs’ subsidized
squad, which everyone picked as

always played a big schedule:
the difference in cost between
playing a match and having
practice is oniy two dozen balls.
The boys enjoy playing matches,
and our schedule is as attractive
as anybody's."

SUBSIDIZED TENNIS.

On the philosophy of subsi-
dized tennis, Coach Fogleman
makes it clear he is not opposed
to scholarship programs, but he
adds,
rather have the best facilities
and a good budget than scholar-
ships. I think it is unfair to
have your number one man on
scholarship and your number
six man not. After all, each one
can only get. you one point. $16,-
000 a year for an adequate pro-
gram of tennis scholarships
would not reap $16,000 worth of
good for Davidson College."

Each summer for the past 20

years Coach Fogleman has fol-
lowed the tournament tour,

checking the development of
young tennis players. He is so

widely traveled, he conserva-
tively guesses that he knows
about 90 percent of all the junior
players in the United States.

Coach Fogleman summarizes,
“Tennis has been good to me.
I have been able to do the
things I like to do, helping to
develop young players. It has
given me a chance to travel and
meet people. When any sport
has given me the pleasure ten-
nis has, and offers the liveli-
hood ‘it has, it definitely has a
place in education.” |

Laxton’s comment, ‘We just

Meanwhile the Pikas advanc- + :

finals of the winners’ bracket of y*
the double elimination tourna-
ment. They lost in three games, wy
too.

In tennis, the Phi Delt team
of Steve Davidson and Buzzy
Parker were favored. They lived
up to expectations as they cruis-
ed all the way to the finals.
Their latest victims were Rick
Reed and John Hurst of the

ed to the Josers’ bracket. Their
opponents were Chris Hawk and
Bob O'’Kelley of the Pikas who
had won four matches in a row
since a first round lost to the
Sigma Chis.

Said O’Kelley, “The match
was close all the way (2-6, 6-2,
6-4) and I guess we just got
more breaks.’ One break may
have been that Hurst was un-
able to play. He was replaced
by Bill Wideman. The Phi Delts
and Pikas played this afternoon
for the championship.
