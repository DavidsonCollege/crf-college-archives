Presbyterian Educator Speaks On
Companionship In Sun-
day Service

Dr. Henry H. Sweets of Louisville,

LRY- addressed the Y. -M. C. A, Vesper
“service last Sunday night.

Dr. Sweets

is Executive Secretary of the / embly’s
committee on Christian Education and
Ministerial Relief. :

The service was in charge of Don
Bailey, who read from the scripture in
the fourteenth chapter of John, verses
one to seventeen. Carleton Chapman
opened the service with an organ pre-
lude, and Warren Babcock furnished the
special music, playing Schubert's Ave
Maria‘as a cello solo, Bob Coit led the
meeting in prayer.

Dr. Sweets took the phrase “the Com-
munion of the Holy Ghost”, found in IT
Corinthians XIT:14, as the subject of
his talk, The nearest equivalent to the
word communion in our everyday speech,
according to the speaker, is partnership.
We may examine this phrase for years
and not come to know its full meaning,

The more experience we have with this

communion, the more it will come to
mean to us.
“In these modern times of social,

political, and moral upheaval,” said Dr.
Sweets, “youth does not want to en-
shrine a force or a master in its heart,
it needs instead a friend and com-
panion.” If we will enter into communion
with God, He will become our partner,
silent but active.

In the business world there are many
jobs which an individtial cannot perform,
but which can be handled very well by
a partnership. So it is with the prob-
lems_of life. God is infinite in power.
With Him as partner we may share in
His omnipotence. We may fail in many
things, but by looking to Him and rely-
ing on His help we will succeed in the
end.

The Bible is God’s method of making
Himself known to us. He made the
3ible and He can best reveal to us the
meaning of its pages. If we will open
our hearts and study this Book we will
come to feel Him always at our side
ready to help in any problem.

‘What the power of God can accomplish
in partnership with man is well exem-
plified by the life and work of Dwight
L. Moody. Moody spent his life going
throughout all the countries of the
world, and with God’s help he establish-
ed many churches, seminaries, libraries,
and schools which stand as a
monument to his life of service. God
wants everybody to give themselves to
Him in that way.

Tf we will accept God as our partner,
He will remove all fear from our lives.
We will he able to go through every day
knowing that we have an infinite power
on which we can rely.

At the of his talk Dr.
Sweets dismissed the meeting with the
benediction.

_Dr. G. B. Watts Speaks

At Book Club Meeting

At a meeting of the Bessie Dewey Book
Club of Charlotte held October 19th at
the home of Mrs. W. L. Burroughs on
Brandon Road, Dr. George B, Watts
of the Davidson faculty was the speaker.
His subject was “The Beginnings of
French Literature.” ~

Dr. Watts gave an interesting resume
of the early French works and stated
that the early French plays were given
in the churches by the priests. His lec-
ture included “The Song of Roland”,
“The Aucassin and Nicolette’ and a
short sketch of the life of Francois Vil-
Ion. Mrs. Watts was also a guest of the
club.

East Dormitory Comes
To Fore In Orderliness

“East Dormitory ranks at. the top in
orderliness,” was the statement of Mrs.
N. T. Smith, supervisor of dormitories
and friend of Davidson's great body of
roomers.

For some time there was a prevalent
opinion among the students and among
the parents of the students that old East
was an undesirable place to room. In
other years several unfortunate circum-
stances occurred which placed East in a
bad light. Although these unhappy events
were in each case given an immediate
remedy a pall continued to hang over the
dormitory’s name. Mrs. Smith's  state-
ment enables East to take a position of
honor on the Davidson campus. «Mrs.
Smith added that as usual Davidson has
a fine group of boys and that so far there
has been very little trouble.

sixteen, although a few of these men
were not able to work at the time they

Nevertheless the greater majority of
these men have already felt the aid of

the maximum of one thousand and ninty-
