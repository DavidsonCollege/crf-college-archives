short order from a guard play.
Wake Forest began playing a close
guarding game, when Roberts fol-
lowed with another neat shot. About
the middle of the half as Roberts
was in mid-air shooting from under
the basket, a sharp rush by tivo
Wake Forest men sent him head-
long into the wall, rendering him
unconscious. After a few minutes’
of restoration he continued the
game, but was out of it as far as
scoring was concerned. Crawford.
replaced Hall, who received a terri-
ble blow on the jaw, forcing him to
retire. Led by Freezor, wha shot
three goals in the second half, Wake
Forest ran the score up 24 fo 12.

Carolina Game.
Putting up the best and fastest

with thrilling plays. The game was
clean, neither side playing a rough
game and the play was open at all
times. Invincible passing by both
sides featured, with Carmical, crafty
forward, leading the scoring with 11
points. Roberts, for Davidson, fol-
owed with eight points.

The first half was nip and tuck
throughout. Roberts opened up
with a foul goal. Carolina reversed
the tables and scored a couple of
field goals by neat passing. The
Wildcats came from behind, aided
by the clever work of Romefelt at
guard, and succeeded in keeping the
race neck and neck. The first half
found Carolina leading by a two
point margin, the score being 13 to
it

Elon Game.

Showing a complete reversal of
the previous night’s playing, the
Wildcats fell an easy prey to Elon.
The team failed to exhibit any real
basketball and made a miserable
showing. On the other hand the
light and fast Elon quint, headed by
Sides and Johnson, played rings
around their opponents.

The first half was played in an in-
different manner, and Elon came out
with the long end of a 11-to 9 score.
In the second half Elon sent sub-
stitutes in but Davidson was unable
to stop the tide and the final score
ended 24 to 18 in Elon's favor. The
shooting of Sides and Johnson, each
tossing in four goals, featured for
Elon, while the only notable playing
on Davidson's team was the splen-
did fight put up by Romefelt.

BASKETBALL GLEANINGS.

Clemson is reported this year as
having a team not up to her usual
standard. Clemson has lost to both
Wofford and the University of
South Carolina by narrow margins.
Her Southern trip through Alabama
and Georgia resulted rather disas-
trously also. Ina more recent game
she administered a defeat to Fur-
man. Against Davidson Saturday
night Clemson will probably line-up
with Black and Schenck, at for-
wards; Colbert, at center, and Coles
and Going, at guards.

Aubnrn lost to V. M. I. 49 to 19,
and to Washington and Lee, 34 to

The Audit Board Is at Work. |

The audit board is now at work
on the finances of the various col-
lege organizations. This is a board
appointed by the president of the
student body to meet each term and
check up the books of the two liter-
ary societies, the three college pub-
lications, the Y. M.'C. A. board, the
Y. M. C. A., the commissary, and
other organizations. ‘The men on
this year’s board are S. H. Askew, J.
C. McCaskill, and J). R. Boulware.

Thus far, the only books which
have been turned in in a satisfactory
condition are those of the two Y. M.
C. A.’s and the Eumenean Society.

fact that it has already spent some
$2,000, which is almost an unheard
of sum for that organization. It is
expected that The Davidsonian

as great.
