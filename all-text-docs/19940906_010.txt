Men's soccer streaks to 2-0, faces UNCC T hursday

By Will Cobb
The first challenge for the 1994
men’s soccer team was answered
when the Wildcats edged South
Alabama 1-0 last Saturday. Sopho-
‘more Robert Clarke broke a score-
less game in the second half when

he took a pass from junior Ryan

Northington and blasted the ball
past a helpless keeper. Saturday’s
victory gives the Wildcats their
first season opening victory in sev-
eral years.

“T got a good hit, and luckily,
the shot went in. The win was big,
and hopefully it will propel us into
the rest of the season,” said Clarke.

South Alabama entered the
contest ranked #10 in the southern
region by Soccer America, mak-
ing the victory that much sweeter.
Alex Deegan played in goal for the
first time since injuring his knee

last September and came up big.
After getting himself into trouble
when he tackled a player on a fast
break, Deegan turned around and
made an outstanding save, secur-
ing the shutout.

The Wildcats went without the
luxury of a scrimmage or exhibi-
tion, and as a result started a little
slow. Facing an opponent other
than themselves forced the Wild-
cats to make some adjustments as
the game progressed.

“We had a hard time figuring

out our strengths and weaknesses, .

but in the second half we took it to
them. South Alabama was a qual-
ity opponent with a lot of returning
starters. That was a tough game to
win,” said senior Tommy Suter.
Starting the season. with a
strong victory gives the young team
needed confidence. Sophomore

Isaac Stewart anchors the defense
at sweeper and made an outstand-
ing debut at the varsity level, win-
ning almost every ball in the air.
The season opener also featured
the return of John Sampers to the
midfield. His confidence and lead-
ership abilities have made an im-
mediate impact on individual and
team performances.

A shutout was a rarity last
season, but a deep and healthy de-
fense looks to repeat Saturday’s
result more often this season. Other
strong individual efforts came from
reserves John Eckman and Phil
Julyan. The Wildcats can go 18 to
19 players deep this season, an
advantage and luxury coach
Charlie Slagle has not enjoyed very
often since arriving at Davidson.
Strong team efforts will be seen
throughout the season. With many

Volleyball drops 4 matches in home tourney

By Traci Cliett

The women’s volleyball team
had a rough weekend, losing three
matches as host of the two-day
Comfort Inn Volleyball Invita-
tional.

Friday night at Baker Sports
Complex, the Wildcats lost toeven-
tual champion Georgia Tech.
Davidson also had a rough Satur-
day, falling to Tennessee Tech in
the morning, before an afternoon

defeat to William and-Mary and.

another defeat to Georgia Tech.

The Wildcats are a young
team, as Lorie Logan is the only
senior on a squad with eight fresh-
man, two sophomores, and one
junior.Despite that, coach Carolyn
Blake is confident that the team is
good enough to play this season’s
tough schedule.

“We had no idea what to ex-
pect this weekend. But we got
some exposure to some toughcom-
petition, and we know that our

freshmen will not play like fresh-
men by the end of September, said
Blake.

Logan said “the team im-
proved with each match” this week-
end. She also said that with some
effort, the team will have a good
season, andeach team member will
get plenty of playing time.

Blake said despite the scores,
she was pleased to see her team
display ‘anew level of skill across
the board.”

Ravens. Howell also intercepted a
pass in the team’s opener, a 52-6
win at home against the Triangle
Cardinals August 20.

Fassett is the punter for the
squad, which is comprised mostly
of ex-small college players andisa
part of the Mason-Dixon Football

League.

Howell, who was the Wild-
cats’ starting quarterback for four
years, and Fassett both graduated
this spring.

The Blast is run by Dick

Sports fans count on the NFL

By Matt Pitzer

The hot summer months have
passed us. Soon, the leaves on
trees will begin changing colors
and falling delicately to the ground.

Allright, enough cliches. We
all know it's time for football to
crank up and rule the sporting
world until January. Sure, that stuff
about cooler weather is nice, but
it’s really just secondary in impor-
tance. to the sport.

Football should dominate just
about everything when it comes to
sports for the next few months,
After all, there isn’t a pennant race
or World Series to follow.

So let’s get right down to the
dirty stuff. Everybody wants pre-
dictions, so we’ll give them to
you. We’ ll just talk about the NFL,
leaving the college game for an-
other time and another place.

There really aren’t any sur-
prises here. The NFC champion-
ship will determine the Super Bowl
champion once again, and that
winner will likely be either San
Francisco or Dallas. The 49ers look
to be tough based on several off-
season pick-ups, basically retool-
ing the defense and providing some
extra firepower to Steve Young,
one of the league’s best quarter-
backs.

Perhaps the best under center
in the NFL,- however, is the Cow-
boys’ Troy Aikman. But they also
have. some problems, which may
undermine their potential to be the
next dynasty in the league. Owner
Jerry Jones is at the head of that
list, which also includes losing
some underrated but key players.

It was Jones, however, who
drove off Jimmy Johnson, who
was quickly becoming one of the
NFL’s best coaches, with his big,
fat ego and who later brought on
board old friend and college coach
Barry Switzer.

At Oklahoma, you’ ll remem-
ber, all Switzer did was win. But
he couldn’t keep control of his
program, leading to his oust. Al-
ready, there have been some de-
rogatory comments from players

about Jones and Switzer, most...

notably from star receiver Michael
Irvin. Naturally, Switzer must win
a lot to quiet comparisons to
Johnson.

But there were some indica-
tions of trouble ahead Sunday
against Pittsburgh. You might have
noticed that the Cowboys’ offense
was alittle more conservative, with
less of the high-powered passing
to Irvin and Alvin Harper. The
offense also stuttered close to the
goal line several times.

The bet here is that the 49ers
will hold off the Cowboys; take the
Super Bowl,-and save coach
George Seifert, who is outstand-
ing. There might be some other |
contenders, but none too serious.
Minnesota will improve but doesn’t
realistically have a chance. The
second tier will include teams like
New Orleans, Green Bay, and-just
maybe-Arizona.

Over in the basically pathetic
AFC, Buffalo seems to be the class
again, although they will continue
to make baseball’s Braves look
like a good, clutch playoff team.
The Bills have slowly overhauled
their team over: the past couple
years, but they have kept the key
components, such as Jim Kelly,
Thurman Thomas, and Bruce
Smith. Look for them to be play-
ing in Miami come late January.

Other tough teams will be the
consistently just-not-quite-good-
enough Kansas City Chiefs, the
much improved L.A. Raiders, per-
haps Miami. The Steelers could
surprise a few people, especially if
their defense comes into its own
and performs like it is capable. ~

Who’s going to be at the bot-
tom of the heap? Tampa Bay, of
course. The Redskins, Rams, and
Cincinnati will give them com-
pany.

This season should be great
with the several rule changes, most
notably the two-point conversion.
But the results will the same old,
same old: San Francisco will re-
take the crown after a few years
away, and the NFC will dominate

the AFC forthe 769th straight year.
