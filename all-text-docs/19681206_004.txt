Davidson Receives

Control Of TV Time

By JULE YOUNG
Staff Writer

Plans are being made by
several students for the
establishment of a monthly
television series on David.
son. Stimulated by the offer
of a Charlotte television sta-
tion to air such a program.
the students hope to begin the
the series Feb. 20.

According to Roger Powell.
currently in charge of the
series. “The program offers
great potential for David.
son College if we can arouse
enough interest to make it
effective. It would allow not
only for publicity. but would
also be an outlet for the ex.
pression of student opinion
and the demonstration of
campus talent.”

Under present. pians, the
show would be varying in
format. with interviews. dis-
cussion and _ entertainment
periodically offered. Plans
are being considered for the
first show: however. con-
crete format has not been
established at present.

Powell, working with the
Union Publicity Committee,
noted that. “There are sev-
eral major problems remain-
ing in the filming of the pro-
gram.’ The principal! difficul.
ty remaining seems to be a
financial one.

Handicapped by the lack
of funds, the group has been
unable to secure financial
assistance from the college's
Office of Public Information.

If the program is carried
out in Charlotte television
studios, the program could
be produced at. relatively

low cost. However, Powell
stressed that the difficulty
in such an arrangement is
that visiting lecturers and
entertainment groups. possi
ble subjectS of the show,
would be unwilling to appear

if the program were in Char
lotte.

Powell said, “Each of
these problems can probably
be solved if the college com-
munity feels that such a pro
gram would be worthwhile.”'

Open House Opportunities
Are Used More This Year

“There is no need for divi-
sion in communication be-
tween faculty and students
here at Davidson."’ says Dan
Graham.

The Open House Program
which Graham manages is
apparently successful this
year in improving communi-
cation between these groups.

Graham's program, revital-
ized by Don Hoyt and operat.
ed under the auspices of the
YMCA, has arranged for 28
open houses in the last two
months.

Faculty members invite
the members of the student
body into their homes on
Sunday nights under this
program.

Speaking of the import-
ance of the Open House pro-
gram at Davidson, Graham
said. “I think one of the
strongest things about David-
son is the possibility of close
student-faculty relationships,
it gives us a chance to know
each other as human beings
instead of just on a profess-
ional student -. professional
teacher basis.”

Class Enrollments Vary

Registrar J. H. Ostwalt
said Tuesday that course en.
rollments are averaging
about the same as last year
in size, although the range
runs from 63 to three.

‘Most introductory cour-
ses are fairly full,” he said.
“There are two redsons
classes may seem larger."

courses,’’ said the registrar.
Average teaching load is
two courses, he said, while
average student course load
is three.

Ostwalt suggested that
some courses that attract
only two or three students
may be offered only in alter-
nate years in the future.
