Students Wish To Evaluate Faculty _%
_A recent survey at the University of Minnesota in- _,
dicated that a majority of students would like to
evaluate instructors work before they are offered
promotions or raises. Ninety-nine percent of the
students polled felt that evaluating a faculty mem-
ber’s teaching is very important when considering
him for a raise or promotion. A majority of the
students would prefer voting membership for stu-

dents on evaluating committees.

Students also were asked what kind of job security
the faculty should have. Fifty-three percent recom-
mended limited job security, in the form of one or
two-year contracts. Twenty-seven percent chose con-
tracts of several years duration, and nine percent
chose permanent job security with no firing except
for cause.

Vermont Offers Special Interest Halls

The University of Vermont in Burlington has begun
to offer special interest residence halls for its stu-
dents. One hall is an environmental hall for those
students interested in environmental concerns, re-
gardless of their major or year in college. Another
hall is the French Hall in that only French is spoken

within the hall.
The

of these special interest halls is to

“build first a feeling of community and then become a
structure to facilitate interaction between students
on both an academic and social development plane.’’
The residence hall staffs, solely control-personnel in
the past, now act as counselors to establish new

programs on halls.

Greece, Rome ‘Come Alive’
For Spring Classics Students

By STEVE JOHNSON
Staff Writer

Greek temples were not
always pure white stone.
Odysseus was not purely a fic-
tional character. Lions never
made meals of Christians in the
Colosseum.

These statements may or
may not interest you. They
concern aspects of ancient
Greece and Rome that ‘come
alive’ for selected Davidson
students each year, through
participation in the Spring
Classics Seminar Abroad.

The program coramences in
Athens, Greece, where ap-
proximately one week is spent
assimilating essentials of Greek
art, literature, history, and
culture. From here the group
travels to several important
sites, gaining an understanding
of ancient Greek life through
varied examples.

After five weeks in Greece,
the seminar moves to Italy for a
gradual absorption of the
totally different Roman culture.
The major stops there are
Naples, Rome, and Florence.

Eventually the students reach
Southern France for ter-
mination of the 10 week
program.

The peculiarities of this
academic venture make it a
novel ity for anyone
familiar only with Davidson
classes.

The on-the-spot learning
situation, coupled with the spon-
taneous variation of the day to
day travel, works to stimulate a
sensitive awareness of each
foreign area observed, and a
motivation to define its unique
domain.

The requirements for the
three courses provide the

student with a very com-
prehensive grasp of Greek and
Roman cultures, but the
modern setting and the course
outlay encourage him to draw
contemporary parallels.

Students are exposed to ex-
cellent travel opportunities
during and after the program.

Usually a free-travel period is
alloted to each _ student
sometime early in the term.

The nature of the course, as
formulated by
Classics George Labban, en-
courages an assertion of in-
dependence by each student.
One thus learns to live and com-
municate on an individual basis
with foreign people in their own
lands.

During the course of study,
each student conducts a
seminar on some aspect of the
Greek and Roman worlds.

Al the group is utilized
as an effective means for
general discussion and in-
terchange, individual criticism
and assessment of art and
literature is reinforced as the
most direct method for lear-

ning. 4

The course does not profess to
cover all characteristics of
these ancient peoples, but it
does help to define their basic
concepts and provide a core of
understanding from which the
interested student may expand
his knowledge.

It is open primarily for
students not concentrating on
Classical studies at Davidson.

Every year many potential
applicants fail to take notice of
the opportunities offered by the
program. Besides providing an
excellent temporary alter-
native to Davidson, it exposes
one to the strange, but elegant

Instruction is top-notch; Lab-

four straight years, and is well

weeks to introduce freshmen
to the Patterson Court social
system.

Most freshmen felt that the
members of the individual
houses made real efforts to
make the class of '77 feel wan-
ted and needed. The freshmen
responded to this spirit by tur-
ning out in large numbers.

Dean of Students Will Terry
feels that the self-selection
system is working well.

“I think that students ap-
preciate the kind of flexibility
that it gives them, and yet at the
same time gives them a sense of
belonging to a place. They ap-
preciate the fluidness of the
system that allows them to
change their minds,” he said.

“The system proves itself by
its fluctuation,” Terry com-
mented. ‘‘When an eating club
goes down in size, the members
work harder to rebuild their
membership which makes an
even balance.”’

“For instance, the PIKA’s
one year had only three fresh-
men sign up, and the next year,
there were 50,” Terry ex-

YMCA Depot Generates

By MATTHEW COVINGTON
Staff Writer

The Davidson YM/YWCA is
perhaps the greatest vehicle of
Christian outreach to the David-
son Community. Last year over
200 students participated in its
ministry.

This year, with expanded
facilities, more people will be
involved than ever before.

The most notable and exciting
addition is that of a new
recreational center, the
renovated depot. Although the
Depot was used some last
spring, this year is its first with
detailed plans for an entire
year.

Director of the Depot, Mark
Deaton, sums up the new ex-
citement: ‘Davidson's Y has
not yet been able to serve
through the Depot. This year we
have definite plans, but are still
open for suggestions.”

However, money is needed. A
$5000 debt was created by the
renovation of the depot. This
year, a contribution of $8, in-
stead of the customary $5, was
asked of each student. Ac-

get money, we may have to
scrap many ideas,” he repor-
ted.

Some of the activities planned
for the Depot are the Whistle-
Stop programs which teach
children of the community arts

Olympics later,” said Deaton.

“We also plan week-end
athletics, movies, dances, and
coffee houses during the year.”

A number of the YM/YWCA-
sponsored trips are planned.
One such trip for children is to
Williamsburg.

Another proposed trip is. for

organization, suggested that

plained.

Steve Canterbury, president
of ATO remarked, ‘‘I think this
system is the best possible.
Everyone is working together to
make it successful, and the
freshmen seem to be respon-
ding to it quite well.”’.

Whereas many freshmen
seemed impressed by Emanon
and ATO, houses which they
felt recognized and encouraged
individuality, others cited the
casual, relaxed atmosphere of
the SAE house as having great
appeal.

“The Phi Delts were as
graphic in explaining the merits
of their intramural successes as
the PIKA’s were in describing
the quality of their food,’’ one
freshman observed.

“I’m impressed with what
you get for your money at the
KA house,’’ another mentioned.

Many freshmen indicated
that Random House, with no
social fee, held a special finan-
cial appeal for them.

“‘] will guarantee you that I'll
be eating with Slater again next
year,”’ another decided.

Excitement

added.

“The Church of the Pilgrims,
located in Washington, is
presenting a seminar on
Christianity Today that the
students might be interested
in,” he said.

Many new programs are
planned for this year, making
1973-74 the biggest year in the
Davidson YM/YWCA history.

‘“‘We are having no trouble
figuring out how to spend
money,” said Connette.

Another planned program for
this year is ‘‘Adopt-A-Granny,”
headed by Barbara Brothers
and Brad Tipler. The program
seeks to create one-to-one
relationships between students
and elderly town citizens from
which both will benefit.

“Although most of the
YM/YWCA sponsored activities
are for the community as far as
recreation is concerned, the
students of Davidson are
allowed the opportunity to
minister to their comnunity.
This is the main service the Y
performs for the college.’ said
Otey.
