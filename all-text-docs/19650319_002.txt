Confronting The Problem

A week has passed since the re-
lease of the report of the Fraternity
Evaluation Committee. And, as we

suspected, debate has failed to focus
on the real problems.

Extended harangues have been di-
rected at the makeup of the commit-
tee itself: but regardless of the com-
plexion of the committee, the propos-
als must be considered on their own
merit. Long-winded monologues on
the impact of the proposals on “our”
fraternity are likewise irrelevant: not
because the recommendations would
have little impact on anyone current-
ly at Davidson but because “our” fra-
ternity is not the question.

The question is the influence that
the fraternity, and the fraternity sys-
tem have on the life of the Davidson
student who is the inner-most part of
Davidson College. What is the impact
of the fraternity and the fraternity
system on the non-member? And on
the member?

The entire social structure at Da-
vidson must be examined in light of
these problems:

Most noticeable, of course, to the
man not in a fraternity is his distinct
lack of an adequate social outlet.
More subtle but also more important
is the idea of rejection. Whether Inde-
pendent by choice or by lack of choice,
the non-fraternity man carries the
stigma of not being in a fraternity,
literally of not being “in.”

However, the problem of the great-
est magnitude is also the one that is
most frequently overlooked—the de-
trimental effect of the fraternity on
the fraternity men themselves.

In that they are selective, frater-
nities set certain standards, and in or-
der to obtain membership in the all-
important fraternity, the entering stu-
dent realizes that he must conform
to the standards or meet only a closed
door. But once inside the door the
student learns that the standards still
exist, sometimes in the form of rules.

more frequently in the form of pre-
vailing attitudes.

Anticipating initiation, the pledge
quickly learns what the group expects
and responds accordingly. And, while
the pressure of the group lessens
somewhat after this initial confronta-
tion, so too does the individual's abil-
ity and desire to express his individ-
uality diminish.

In our conversations with mem-
bers of the community over the past
few months, and especially during the
past week, we find surprisingly few
people willing to face these problems.
Indeed, only a small number will con-
cede the existence of such problems.

The fraternity system at Davidson
is “strong” in the best sense of the
word. And, if we felt that the frater-
nity system could be modified so that
these problems were effectively eradi-
cated. then we would support modifi-
cation of the fraternity system. But
such is not the case. Modification at
best would lessen the impact of these
problems. Modification of the present
system would be only a strike at the
outward signs rather than the origin
of the problems.

Neither of the minority reports
originating in the Fraternity Evalua-
tion Committee provides an answer to
either the problem of the fraternity
member or the non-fraternity mem-

er

On the other hand, we find within
the committee report a solution that
squarely confronts the existing prob-
lems and successfully deals with them
while maintaining the distinct advan-
tages of the small group social life
found within the existing fraternities.

We suggest that both students and
faculty look once again at the pro-
posals originating from the commit-
tee. But we urge that the members of
this community conduct this re-exam.
ination always asking, ‘What are the
problems? Will this proposal maintain
the virtues of the present system
while eliminating the problems?”

‘The Editorial Voice’

Student Body presidential candi-
date David Meschan in a snide refer-
ence to THE DAVIDSONIAN in his
chapel speech Tuesday questioned the
conception of this newspaper as “The
News and Editorial Voice of the Da-
vidson College Student Body.”

We doubt that Mr. Meschan serious-
ly questions the news function of THE
DAVIDSONIAN; rather his charge fo-
cuses on the editorial function of the
student newspaper.

It is important that we first empha-
size that any student who demonstrat-
es his ability and desire to work can
aspire to the editorship of this paper.

But, even if the -student elects to
avoid this time-consuming and ener-

-draining position, he, nevertheless,
Fas a voice in selecting the person
who will fill the editorial position. In
that each student pays a small sum
towards the budget of THE DAVID-
SONIAN, each student likewise has a
right to vote for the editor-in-chief.

What then is the editor's responsi-
bility to the electorate? It is not mere-
ly to reflect the views of the majority
of the students on this issue or that
issue, even if the majority viewpoint
can be determined on all issues. Rath-
er the editor has the responsibility, af-
ter examining all sides, of making his
own decision guided only by his con-
science and his ability to reason This
has been the role that we have tried to
fill: an editor, elected by the Student
Body, but free to form and express
his own opinions.

Obviously, under such a system, the
editor will never please everyone and,

at times, will side opposite the major-
ity. Nevertheless, those who disagree
have the option of expressing their
disagreement in the “Letters to the
Editor” column. It is here—in that
every student may express his opinion
in writing—that we consider THE DA-
VIDSONIAN the “News and Editorial

Voice of the Davidson College Student
Body.”

We do not promise to publish every
letter: the laws of libel and standards
of propriety forbid such a sweeping
guarantee. Nevertheless, we hasten’
to point out that in our four years on
THE DAVIDSONIAN staff we have
never seen a signed letter submitted
for publication fail to be printed. At
the worst, letters have been held back
for a week for lack of space in the
paper.

We share Mr. Meschan’s disappoint-
ment that pro-fraternity viewpoints
have been few in the columns of THE
DAVIDSONIAN. However, our disap-
pointment is nurtured not by sympa-
thy for the fraternity system; rather
we are sorry that representatives of
all sides in this controversy have
failed to exhibit initiative and have
failed to come forth with their views.

We are sorry to report that, since
the beginning of this controversy last
November, we have received surpris-
ingly few letters. But we note with
interest that, although fraternity men
outnumber Independents by a three-
to-one margin, most of our letters
have originated with Independents.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR .

Carter Calls For Realism
In Approaching Problems

Dear Editor:

It seems to me that in the
Fraternity Evaluation Commit-
tee report a tremendous amount
of responsibility has been plac-
ed on the student body, while
virtually none has been asked
of the administration This re-
port states that a large major-
ity of the students must sacri-
fice a great deal, but that the
“school"’ itself must sacrifice
nothing.

Davidson College. though de-
luding itself into believing that
it is a liberal institution by such
measures as occasionally having
a liberal speaker and by offi-
cially advocating non-discrimi-
nation, is obviously one of the
most conservative colleges in the
South.

A campus-wide rule forbidding
the use and possession of alco-
hol (with one slight exception)
and the rules against having

girls in the dormitory at any.

time, while not completely ar-
chaic in the South, are regard-
ed as absurd anachronisms in
exactly those same Northern
schools which Davidson is so
desperately trying to mimic.

And even in the South such
customs as required chapel and
vespers have given Davidson the
justly deserved reputation of be
ing a ‘“‘glorified-prep-school."

To escape from this unrealis-
tic and suppressive environment
in which he has ensnared him
self, the average Davidson man
turns to activities outside the
school, such as dating and ‘‘par
tying.”

This is. difficult because of
both natural and administrative
obstacles, but through a sort of
“union”’ the student has banded
together with others so that he
can date (even though the near-
est socially alive community is
20 miles away and he does not
have or is not allowed to have
a car), and can party with his
friends in an atmosphere which,
unlike that of campus “parties”,
does not reek of the Junior-Sen-
ior in the gym of his old high
school. This union is the frater-
nity system,

This then is the conflict—the
staid, stolid position of the
church school which does noth-
ing to better its frigid social cli-
mate, and the social outlet which
the students are forced to set up
for themselves. In this structure
a number of students are left
out. The school takes compas-
sion on these few and orders
the rest to throw open their pri-
vate organizations to accommo-
date this small group.

The school, by its nature as
a conservative, church-centered
institution, has forced its stu-
denis to provide an outlet for
their ‘‘social energies” and now
it suddenly wants this outlet
abolished, for all practical pur-
poses, saying that it has become
too important to the student. But
at the same time, it is doing
nothing to erase those same fac-
tors which have caused frater-
nities to become so central at
Davidson.

drastic changes such as those

He Did A Good Job:
Will THEY Miss Him?

Dear Editor:
Well, he’s leaving Monday.

I wonder if THEY will miss
him. THEY? THEY were the
ones who never cheered. THEY
were the ones who didn't try to
help him with his recruiting.
THEY were the ones who ‘‘could
not’ give him the number of
scholarships he needed to do his
job. THEY were those who took
much in money and time, and
gave what they had “‘left-over.”

THEY were the ones so quick
to criticize, yet so loathe to help.
THEY were the players who
could have won, and they, them-
selves, don't know why they
didn’t. THEY were the ones who
preached that it was not win-

ning that mattered at Davidson, .

and yet fired him for not win-
ning. THEY were tte ones who
quite asininely punned the page
in the yearbook, lowering them-
selves and the book.

1 wonder who else THEY were
—faculty, administration, alum
ni, students? I was.

Whether he was a great coach
is quite beside the point now.
Would the lack of the THEYs
have made any difference? I'm
sure he joins with many others
in hoping Coach Smith never has
to wonder.

What does matter now is the
man. Like I said, he’s leaving
Monday. I've had many people
tell me how much respect they
have for him, how much they
like him. I doubt many have
told him—it’s just not done that
way around here.

But, for the boy who was
promised his scholarship on his
return from funking out — in
case he wasn't here, and for my
own case—my Father had a

heart attack. my Mother, not
knowing who to call, got in
touch with him and out of sheer
panic left what to do up to him.

He got Coach Shoe to drive
me to High Point to the hospital
that night, after which Coach
Shoe had to turn right around
and come back to DC. He han-
dled all my class problems until
I could be sure things were ok
at home. How about the boys
who have been hurt? He usually
visited them several times a
week.

He usually picked them up
from the hospital. I could go on
and on with at least half a doz-
en similar cases—and there are
probably many, many more
about which I don't know.

I don’t want this to sound in
any way like a pathetic appeal:
Shat's just not his cup of tea.
All it is.is a passing thought.
I owe the man quite a bit—so do
others. I guess the best way to
eid this would be to say, as he
would say it, “he’s a hell of a
nice guy.”
Ane. he’s leaving Monday.

advocated by the Fraternity
Evaluation Committee are put
into effect, the administration
take a long look at its policies
in regard to contemporary so-
cial mores and conduct.

The, situation as it is now is
one which the school has cre-
ated by its ultra-conservative,
Victorian atmosphere. The stu-
dents must have somewhere to
turn if they don't wish to lead
completely monastic lives—and
they have turned to fraternities.

If the administration would
first be more realistic in its
drinking and social policies and
other areas mentioned above,
and if it would enact changes al-
lowing the students more social
freedom, the fraternities would
cease to play such a major part
in campus life and proposals
such as those recently brought
forth would be much more read-
ily accepted.

Once More

Feeling

By TIM KIMREY
Davidsonian Associate Editor
Wake Forest College, that school that the Bap-
tists run with the fervor that makes our Presby-
terian school-masters seem like anarchists, noted a
wondrous break in tradition last week-end. It seems
that there was a rather vocal group of students there

who felt that Wake Forest was pi

lly isolated from

the world and all its doings (sound familiar?), and
they decided to do something about it. The result
was a forum on Civil Rights called “Challenge '65.
From all reports, the forum was a grand suc-
cess The list of speaking participants was impres-

sive,

including Senator Thomas Dodd, Russell Kirk,

James Farmer, and Joan Baez, who donated_her

well-known voice in a splendid concert.

Both

conservative and liberal spokesmen had their say,
and virtually every related topic was covered in the

three-day conference.

The amazing note of this whole thing is that
“Challenge '65” was conceived, nurtured and pre-
sented by students—students who were interested
enough to spend considerable time in talking, plan-
ning, and raising quite a sum of money from many
sources to put the whole thing across. We commend
those students at Wake Forest for their obvious con-
cern and for making that concern real through
“Challenge ’65."” And we would suggest that there is
one way in which proud Davidson could learn a les-

son from Wake Forest.

A platform suggestion made in Thursday's
YMCA chapel made good sense, and we would like
to see it carried through. Buck Lawrimore called for
an inter-denominational ecumenically-minded fel-
lowship group on this campus, to replace the pres-
ently competing Presbyterian, Methodist and Baptist
groups. Aside from the obvious area of social con-
cern and action, the “renewal” church is heading in

the direction of ecumenicism, and such a non-denom-
inational fellowship could provide local impetus for

this exciting movement.

Speaking of excitement, it strikes me every time
I read the newspaper reports about sick Selma and
LBJ’s voting bill that this decade is a most exciting
one to be living in. A revolution is sweeping the
country under the title of “The Movement.”

The President of the United States has deliv-
ered what amounts to an ultimatum to racists and
states’ righters in the form of the Civil Right to Vote
bill, which will end formal prejudice at the polls.
And on the ecclesiastical scene, Roman Catholic and
Protestant spokesmen alike are seriously conversing
about such things as unity, renewal, and a real peace.

Something tells me that the next ten years will
find this country undergoing a metamorphasis in
the areas of religion and race, the process and end
results of which will stir the imagination and thrill
the soul of even the most stagnant conservatives.

TULANE PROFESSOR SPEAKS

Doing Away With Greeks?
Try A New Rathskeller

The establishment of a rathskeller at Tulane would be a first step towards a
more university oriented social life for the student, believes Dr. Henry L. Mason,
head of the A&S Political Science Department. .

“The university has only one—

function, and that is to work on
people's minds, for the purpose
of greater knowledge of the sci-
entific, scholarly and moral
truths of this world,”’ said Dr.
Mason.

“If at all possible, the stu-
dents’ basic community at the
university should relate itself to
these purposes and should se-
lect its members on a basis re-
lated to these purposes.”

The present social structure at
Tulane does not group the stu-
dents along lines consistent with
the ideals of the university.

“The fraternities seem to se-
lect their members basically
along the lines by which mem-
bers of a country club are se-
lected, which may be fine for
country clubs, but it is bad for
a university,” commented the
instructor in international rela-
tions.

“The result is that the stu-
dents’ basic social community,
if he is a fraternity member,
does not reflect the university,
and, if he is not a fraternity
member, he has no basic social
group available under the Tu-
lane system.

“The ‘rathskeller, therefore,
would be a first step in the di-
rection of an alternative to the
fraternity group system, and it
should be combined with other
far reaching reforms in the dor-
mitories, along the lines of Ox-
ford or Yale houses,"’ continued
Dr. Mason

A small group is provided for
the student in universities under
the house system, a popular con-
cept in parts of Europe.

The house is oriented along
academic goal lines, and the so-
cial life of the student is provid-
ed for because everyone has a
small group into which he can
fit.

“I grant that the fraternities
fulfill the necessary role in pro-
viding a small group atmos-
phere for the student, but I feel
that fraternities choose their
members for the wrong rea-
sons,’ argued Dr. Mason.

These reasons are based on
life outside the sphere and scope
of the university, rather than
reasons based on the ideals and
purposes of the university.

All students need a small
group, according to Dr. Mason,
but at present they think they
get it only by joining a frater-
nity.

“The rathskeller would be just
one way by which the university
would acknowledge responsibil-
ity in the social life of the stu-
dent. By drinking beer, sym-
bolically, at least, one part of
the students’ social life is ful-
filed by the university, rather
than leaving that part of the stu-
dents life to fraternities or to
neighborhood establishments,”
remarked the political science
professor. yo,

“One tremendous atea of in-
fluence of the univers{ty should

be at the level of the students
life outside the classroom.

“At the outside classroom
level we have left the field much
too much to the fraternities,”
Stated Dr. Mason.

However, Dr. Mason warns
that by providing an alternative
to the fraternities, the university
has not solved all problems
towards making Tulane more of
a university and less a collection
of classrooms.

“The rathskeller does not as
such provide for this small com-
muna} living which is essential
to the student. My opinion is
that this university will have to
do considerably more in the fu-
ture éo provide an intellectual
and social atmosphere which
properly relates itself to the pur-
poses of the university."

There have been attempts to
create “‘houses’’ in the dormi-
tories which would lead to the
formation of small fraternity-
like’ groups, but such attempts
have not succeeded to any great
extent,

An important condition which
the rathskeller must have before
it cap fulfil its social function
is the right to serve alcoholic
beverages, believes Dr. Mason.
"If this condition is not filled,
the money may be wasted, be-
cause the students do not need
another place to buy cokes . .
they do not need another soda
fountain.”
