Town And Gown:
A Study In Unity

“The thing that gives me the most satisfaction is
that whenever conflicts do arise, the townspeople and
ord college are willing to sit down and work them

That was the response of Dr. Daniel D. Rhodes,
Committee on Community Relations, when asked
about the relationship between Davidson College and

the town of Davidson.

Rhodes said that there were times when the college

two things: Davidson's bas-
ketball program and the ac-
ceptance of a student from
the Congo,

The basketball program, he
said, has allowed the people
in the surrounding areas to
identify with the college more
than they had ever been able
to before.

The acceptance of George
Nzongola, the first Negro ad
mitted to Davidson, prompt
ed the creation of the mayor's
committee in an effort to
face and attempt to solve
problems arising from the
admission of Negroes to Da
vidson. This helped unify the
community with the college,
Rhodes said

Mayor F L. Jackson
agreed with Rhodes He cited
such things as the widening
of Concord Road. several
years ago and the college's
representation on the town
planning board as evidence
of the cooperation existing
between the town and gown.

C. Shaw Smith, director of
the College Union, saw the
problem in a different light:
the college would like to be
a larger part of the com
munity than it is now, he
said

The problem
cause there is hardly enough
space and barely _ enough
people to take care of the
students’ needs, much less
those of the townspeople.

As an example, Smith cit-
ed the Union. There are
signs at every door which
say that the union is open
only to members of the Col-
lege and those on official
business.

“We would like to be able
to say that everyone is wel
come,’ Smith said, “‘but we
have had problems with
fights and disturbances
caused by people other than
students. It looks as if we
don't care about the town,
but given the space and the
people that we have, it is
too difficult to work it out.”

Smith also pointed out that

“| don't |
equate research with publi

professor's output of publi-
lished work is not an index
of how up to date he is in
his field.

Agreeing that publication
is not a good measure of
professor's teaching, several

It has long been standard
for political figures to ac

cept positions in the field
of higher education upon
retirement from _ political

life. Reeently Davidson pro-
fessors have reversed this
pattern.

Today many college pro
fessors prefer to. participate
in politics on the local and
state level instead of enter
ing political life in the na
tional realm. This way they
can take an active part. in
the workings of government
and maintain their status in
the field of education.

The political involvement
of several members of the
Davidson faculty reflects
this trend. One is economics
professor Charles E, Rat
liff, who serves as vice
chairman of the’ Democratic
Party in Deweese Precinct
number one

Another is Registrar and
Associate Dean of Faculty

calling faculty research and
publication “‘an index of a

“This is the most compe

sent Davidson faculty, Wil

of curriculum changes and

ommittee Work:

‘Like A Full-Time Job’

By JOHN WILLIAMS
Associate Editor

Dr. David Kaylor is as-
sociate professor of religion
at Davidson College. He is
teaching two courses this
term.

Kaylor is also a member
of the. Student Life Commit
tee, the Committee on the
College Union, Fraternities
and Clubs, and chairman of
the Davidson College Regu-
lations Court. In addition to
these committees, he play-
ed a major role in the pass-
age of the new Code of Re
sponsibility as a member of
the Committee on Rules and
Punishments and served last
year on the old Student Dis
cipline Committee.

Last year, says Kaylor, he
spent 10 to 15 hours in’ com
mittee work every week.
This year he estimates he is
spending only four or five
hours a week.

How does he feel about all
all this committee work?
“Sometimes it seems like a
full-time job,"’ said Kayler,
laughing. “During this per
iod of re-evaluation and
change at Davidson, though,
the committee load for every
one is especially heavy

“There are strengths and
weaknesses to the commit
tee system,”’ he said. ‘The
faculty is concerned with the
total climate of student life

with students on these. com

‘I sometimes feel that

[-don't think this is good,
Also, | am sure the scholar
ly output of the faculty could
be increased if some of this
load were removed and
given to the administration,
as at some other schools.”

Kaylor’s views are typical
of a large majority of facul
ty members at Davidson

The duties were delineated
so that a few committees

If a professor serves on
some elective committes
now, he is ineligible for
others. Length of service at
Davidson is an important
criterion for appointing the
committee members, though
most professors serve on at
least one committee.

Appointive committees are
open to anyone, though, and
there are some faculty mem.

given these jobs. They have
proved their ability by doing
a good job on several com
mittees and are rewarded
by being given more respon
sibility.

These special committees
include the President's com-
mifsions, the Committee on
Rules and Punishments and
the faculty advisory com
mittee which assisted the
trustees in selecting a new
president. “If too many of
these ad hoc committees are
formed,” said McGavock,
“there is a danger of de

mittees and simply accept
the responsibility as part of
their jobs. They are anxious
to have some say-so in run-
ning the college because
they want to apply the ex-
perience they have had with
the educational process.

The recent addition of stu-
dents to most faculty com-
mittes has met with general
approval on the part of most
professors. ‘In general it is
very good to have students
serving on committees,”
said Dr. W. G. Workman,
professor of psychology. ‘‘It
lets students know that their
views are indeed represent
