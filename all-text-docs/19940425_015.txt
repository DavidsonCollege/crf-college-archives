THE DAVIDSONIAN

ARTS & LIVING MONDAY, APRIL 25, 1994

Davidson College will host
internationally recognized Irish
poet Seamus Heaney for a special
reading on Friday, April 29, at
7:30 p.m. in the 900 Room.

Born in 1939 on a farm in
County Derry, Northern Ireland,
Mr. Heaney taught at Queens Uni-
versity, Belfast, until 1972. Since
then he has divided his time be-
tween Dublin and Cambridge,

Mass., where he teaches at Har-
vard University. In addition, he
has been elected a professor of
poetry at Oxford University.

Mr. Heaney has been selected
as a member of the Irish Academy
of Letters and for the past ten years
he has been nominated as a candi-
date for the Nobel Prize in Litera-
ture. Although he has published
collections of essays, The Govern-

Thespians bemuse audiences

through loving or through hurting.
Jerry manages to uncover the im-
potence of Peter’s marriage and
lifestyle, and he coerces Peter into
showing some real feeling as the
play progresses. Finally, Jerry
pushes Peter off the bench and
goads him into fighting for it. Jerry
succeeds in making a connection
with Peter, by impaling himself on
the knife in Peter’s hand—an act
of hurting which, for Jerry, is as
significant as a show of love. The
play closes as Peter runs away
screaming, his life hopelessly dis-
rupted by the strange man he leaves
bleeding to death onthe park bench.
Ramsay succeeds in making Jerry
a character the audience can both
laugh atand sympathize with, while
Jernigan captures the emotional
changes which Peter goes through
in the play. Director Scott Lenhart
espécially deserves recognition for
carrying off the shocking effect of
the suicide scene. He manages to
preserve both the humorous and
unsettling aspects of the script.
Lanford Wilson’s Ikke Ikke
Nye Nye Nye and Harry Kondolen’s
Self Torture and Strenuous Exer-
cise aim more at simply drawing
laughter from the audience, with
varying levels of success. Ikke
Ikke is set in the apartment of a
telephone operator named Edith
who seems to be trying her best to
seduce Graham, a nervous mail
boy who has asked her out.. Edith’s
relentless teasing only makes Gra-
ham more uncomfortable, and his
reactions to her are clearly incom-
petent—at least, until he gets her
where he wants her. Apparently,
Graham has an insatiable fetish for
obscene phone calls. As soonas he

her up and seduces her over the
phone, reducing her to a whimper-
ing toy. Meg Miller and Josh
Buchanan make their characters
truly funny at points, but the play
itself seems to lack depth. By the
end of the play, Graham has com-
pletely switched roles with Edith
in the seduction, but the characters
are so bizarre and unapproachable
that the audience doesn'treally care.

Kondolen’s play has even less
ofa point but manages to draw alot
more ‘laughs. The events in Self
Torture are intentionally absurd,
and the plot exists only to set up
hilariousinterplay between the four
characters: Carl, a manipulative

novelist; Adel, his paranoid, sui- -

cidal wife; Beth, a flighty poet who
is having an affair with Carl; and
Alvin, her husband, a philosophiz-
ing cook who always thinks the
best ofeveryone and remains com-
pletely oblivious to everything.
The dialogue is packed with
pseudo-“deep” statements like
“Love is torture.” Adam Knapp
almost steals the show with his
brilliant display of Alvin’s idiocy,
but Todd Bowman and Gina
Carlotti also get the most possible
humor out of their characters.
Katherine Laidlaw brings much
energy to the lunatic character of
Adel, although at moments she
seems to try too hard, and the jokes
get lost. However, the play suc-

ceeds as the lightest and funniest

of the one-act plays so far, and the
action moves fast enough to sus-
tain the comedy throughout. With
such strong crowd response for
both Self Torture and The Zoo
Story, perhaps some of these plays
should return for an encore perfor-
mance. Selling the tickets cer-
tainly wouldn’t be a problem.

ment Tongue and The Cure at Troy,
and an adaptation of Sophocles’
Philoctetes, it is for his original
poetry that he is most celebrated.
In such works as Statin Island
(1985), The Haw Lantern (1987),
and Selected Poems: 1966-1987,

one may witness a mastery of lan- .
guage and imagery nearly unparal-

leled today. In his poetry, he tells
of love and loss, of family and the
past, of Irish tradition and the vio-
lent present. And he does so with
such sincerity and emotional can-

Esteemed Irish poet, Seamus Heaney to speak Friday

dor that it feels not so much like he
is depicting a foreign world com-
pletely detached from the indi-
vidual reader’s own experience,
but as if he were opening the door
to his own world and inviting the
reader to take a look inside.
