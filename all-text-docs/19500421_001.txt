Finding Actresses in ‘Boys’ Town’ Is
Least a Play Director's Headaches |

A play director’s lot at Davidson is not a happy one and Nan-
cy Copeland, currently directing the Red and Black ‘Masquers’
Spring finale, ‘‘The Man Who Came to Dinner,’’ will attest to
that fact. ‘‘The problems involved would put a semester exam

in Freshman math to shame,
matter of selecting a cast. Sure there
are plenty of potential male leads
about, but a play like “The Man”
calls for at least seven feminine
parts and in ‘-boy’s town” that’s
quite an order. Nancy filled it on-
ly after an exhaustive search
through household, secretarial, and
high school ranks,

The results were quire success-
ful however, for only two of the
seven will be app<aring for the first
time. The others ate ‘repeat per-
formers’.

It takes a lot of practice to knit
a cast of two dozen or se into 2
competent group czepable of satisfy-
ing an onening night audience and
finding a place to practice every
night his also furnished a problem
for Nancy,

She has partially solved it by
utilizing the old gym for work on
individual acts, and weing the audi-
torium for full length rehearsals
when it is avaiiable. ‘

Then, there’; always that old
bugaboo «é propriety. Deciding
what is apropos to the Davidson
stage is always a ticklish problem
and has caused considerable trou-
bie in the past. However, only a
minimum of lines from this play
will be deleted, and the lines of the
worldly-minded Mr. Whitesides
will be presented almost intact.

“We've ironed cut most of the
rough spots now,” said Nancy,
“and this play should be one of
the best we've put on, rivaling
‘John Loves Mary’ for entertain-
ment.”

Rather than dividing their time
between a local performance and
one away from the campus, the
Masquers will concentrate on Da-
vidson, giving two shows on suc-
cessive nights, May 4 and 5.

The play will climax the obser-
vance of Arts Festival Week here,
and is being planned in accordance
with the committee on Fine Arts.

“The Man Who Came to ‘Din-
ner,” since its introduction on
Broadway in 1936, has been one of ||
the most popular plays with col-
lege and Little Theatre groups. It
embodies a large cast, racy lines,
and a sophisticated wit, very ap:

Sports and Dancing
Fill Frolics Weekend

By JOE DUDLEY

Spring Frolics will come into full
swing today with one day of frolick-
ing finished: Yesterday, many went
to see the Freshman baseball team
play Belmont Abbey. In the eve-
ning, Chambers Auditorium was
choked with laughter invoked by
the scintillating wit of the “D"”
Club Foolies. Last night the first,
dance was held under the baton
of Billy Knauff, and was chalked up
as a success by those in a position
to know. After the dance, most of
the Davidson revelers came in ear-
ly so as to conserve their vigor for
the wild soirees that will be in order
tonight,

At 2:30 this afternoon our varsity
tennis team will go down to the
courts to engage a strong opponent
—University of North Carolina.
The Freshman tennis team will be
down there also to meet Duke Uni-
versity’s star-studded frosh team——
one of the strongest in the South-
em Conference. In addition, the
freshman baseball team will play
Oak Ridge in Richardson field at
3:00. Visitors will not lack enter-
tainment with so many athletic
meets.

Tonight the orchestra will start
pleying at 8:00 to begin the formal
dance. There the Beauty Queen of
Spring Frolics, who was chosen
from. a great number of photo-
graphs by *three aged, senile pro-
fessors, will be announced and
crowned by student body president
Whit Cobb. The winner will be
awarded an orchid, and later wined
(oot) and dined at the Chez Mon-
tet in Charlotte.

At intermission, the Pan-Hellenic
Council will present a figure to in-
troduce their members and the fra-
ternity presidents. The huge num-
eral 50 will be formed in honor
of the senior class. The dance will
then proceed until its end at mid-

night.

Dr. Little Stresses
God's Need Of The

nimportant Person

The Rev. Ganse Little, D. D,
of Columbus, Ohio, spoke at Ves-
pers last Sunday night on the im-
portance of the individual and his
responsibility to God in his day-to-
day undertakings.

Dr. Little drew his topic from
the scripture reading, the opening
of the Gc&pel according to St.
John: -‘In the beginning was the

Word, and the Word was with God,|

and the Word was God.” And from
the sixth through the cighth ‘verses
of the first chapter: “There was a
man sent from God, whose name
was John. The same came for a
witness, to bear witness of the
Light, that all men through him
might believe. He was not that
Light, but was sent to bear witness
of that Light.”

Dr. Little procceded to point ont
that John was not a “big” or “im-
portant” man; he was distinctly
just an ordinary citizen. His only
distinction was his willingness to
obey the will of God and to follow
His purpose. He became great on-
ly in his zeal to bear witness for
God.

It is not the great men, Dr. Lit-
tle stated, that make history, but
the sum of all the little men. What
significance, in other words, has
the great “one,” without a multi-
tude of zeroes, meaningless in them-
selves, to multiply its power by tens
and hundreds?

Having pointed out the great
significance of the individual in
history, Dr. Little hastened to add
that the importance of the individ-
ual, so emphasized in American so-
ciety today, is only contemplated
in the Bible where a man has dedi-
cated himself with God. Man as

an individual is not important un-
less he be willing to bear witness
for God.

All the sciences and all the arts
have no importance without the
small people who are able to trans-
late them into terms of everyday
life, Dr. Little argued. Medical re-
search is useless without the small
country doctor going his weary
rounds from day to day. What bet-
ter use can music have than that

a mother should play a simple
melody to her children after a tire-
some day?

It is the call of God to all of us,
Dr. Little concluded, to bear wit-
ness to Him in smali ways through-
out our lives, in all of our small,
personal relationships with our fel-
low men. “There was a man sent
from God," he said, “whose name

was... yours.”

Frats Put Damper
On Campus Politics;
Survey Reveals

urvey Ind. — (LP.) — A
recent’ survey of 44 colleges and
universities on student govern-
mental setups by the reorganization
committee at DePauw University
reveals the following highlights:

1. Of all the colleges and univer-
sities surveyed an average of 55
per cent of all students voted in stu-
dent elections. In schools without
fraternities or sororities the average
vote was 79 per cent.

2. Thirteen schools used the sen-
ate system and 20 elected members
of the governing group at large.

3. The average size of the govern-
ing group was 18.5 members, aver-
aging by classes 1.6 freshmen, 32
sophomores, 5 juniors and 7.2 sen-
iors.

4. Results indicated that the high-
er the percentage of Greek letter
organization, the less politically or-
ganized the vote seemed to be.
Political parties were not in exis-
tence on 28 campuses and only 12
of the 44 schools answered yes to
the question of the existence of or-
ganized parties. Among those
schools with more than two-thirds
of the campus organized, only one
school had fixed parties.

Climaxing an ingenious publicity campaign, the “‘D’”’ club
presented its annual challenge to the theater world, the ‘‘Fool-
in Chambers Auditorium Friday night. Students and their
dates howled at the antics of such comedy acts as that put on
by Howard Proctor and Vance Mizelle. One of the highlights of
i the talent-packed revue was an out-

landish can-can performed by
Stricklin, McNeely, Henderson,
Walker, Craven, and Kiser. Their

J innate grace seemed to add a vi-

brancy to this otherwise overwork-
ed dance as yet unwitnessed by Da-
yidsonians. Jinks Jervey lent an
air of true romance by means of an-
other of his priceless negro ser-
mons. Harry James himself would
have no doubt blinked had he been
able to hear Grier Williams and his
fiery trumpet. A serious note was
added to the program by Rob Pal-

terpretation of “Old Man River’.

the form of a 30-man all-member
glee club which gave their own
versions of old favorites (until
then) such as “Embraceable You”
and “Magic is the Moonlight.” Led
by Auburn Lambeth, a group of |
black-faced end men nearly caused a
riot among those present with their
zany capers.

For the past four years the “D”
Club “Foolies” has been the enter-
tainment extravaganza looked for-
ward to by every student as Spring
rolled around. This year, as in the
past, the “D"” Club hasn't let us
down. President Jake Wade was
quoted prior to the premier as say-
ing, “It will be a whale of a lot of
entertainment .for 50c.” President
Jake was so very right.

Plans have been made to arrange
the “Foolies” for the Spring Dance
week end for next year. The increas-

ed crowds attending Friday night
led to such plans.

WHITESIDES ELECTED,
MALE CHORUS PRESIDENT

At its regular rehearsal on Mon-

1950-1951 season: President— Bill

Hill, S. C., Secretary-Treasurer;
Don Crosby, Pensacola, Fla.

Two main events remain on the
chorus’s calendar for this year; the
annual Arts Festival the first week
in May at which it is hoped that
some of the American numbers will
be performed with orchestration;
and the graduation exercises early
in June. These performances will
close out this year which Mr. Berg
