Homer
Faces

Trial

Lewis Homer. a Davidson
junior, will face trial April
25 on charges of disorderly
conduct in connection with
an incident which occurred
in front of Johnson's Barber
Shop last Saturday night.

Mecklenburg County Police
made the arrest and charg-
ed Homer with disorderly
conduct. Bond was set at
$250.

A crowd of about 15, in-
cluding students and towns-
People, was present when
the arrest occurred. The
group had been discussing
the recent boycott of his bar-
ber shop with Johnson

Six county policemen and
two town policemen arrived,
arrested Homer and dispers-
ed the crowd.

one of the leaders of the boy-
cott. The Student Gov-
ernment Association Senate
approved a resolution back-
ing the boycott.

The boycott and picketing
of the barber shop began
April 2, when Johnson re-
fused service to two Negroes.

Lane said that the picket-
ing would probably be re-
sumed Tuesday morning aft-
er the expiration of the Mon-
day night deadline set by the
students backing the action,
but also noted that the final
decision would. not be made
until Monday night.

Were Davidson to adopt
the public accommodations
ordinance, it would be the
first town in the United
States to do so, said Dr. Tony
Abbott, secretary of the Com-
munity Relations Committee.

Abbott explained that
Davidson would probably
wait for Charlotte to adopt
the ordinance, and then fol-
low suit. ‘There is a huge
legal problem involved,"’ he
said, and “a town like
Davidson could not afford the
court challenges" which
would result.

Lane, however, suggested
that the town would have ‘‘no
trouble getting legal aid from
NAACP, ACLU, and so on.”

Abbott expressed doubt
about the direct value of the

Senate Backs Boycott, 7-2,
Appoints Ravenel And Doe

The newly-inaugurated stu-
dent Senate voted to endorse
the boycott of Ralph John-
son’s barber shop Tuesday
night by a vote of 7-2, and
then passed, 6-2, a ‘‘resolu-
tion of intent’'.for the stu-
dent body to underwrite any
resulting losses by Johnson
over the next several years.

Members of the Residence
Hall Council, Experimental
College Board. a_ chapel
speakers committee, and a
committee to set up a radio
station were elected by the
student Senate last night.

In addition, Will Ravenel
was elected Senate secretary
and Ernie Doe SGA treasur-
er. Both were unopposed.

In the resolution to en-
dorse the boycott, all Senate
members except freshman
Gary Cash and junior John
Passmore voted in favor.
Covey Carter was absent, but
indicated he would have yot-
ed against both resolutions.
Rick Howard abstained on
the resolution of intent.

Passmore, acting secre-
tary, explained the | resolu-
tion of intent as “‘our intent
for making a commitment to
Johnson for making a com-
mitment to us.°°

mental College Board were

roque sound before the usual
sparse audience Tuesday
night.

Goggn and Solley call their
music “Baroque Folk" be
cause they use a_harpsi-
chord and Goggin's counter-
tenor voice to produce ef-
fects not unlike the 16th and
17th century baroque music.

Goggin, whose thick blond
hair and inch-and-a half of
blond beard frame his face,
says that there are only five
counter-tenors in the world.

“It’s counter-tenor, not
counterpoint or whatever it
was that one guy who intro-
duced us called it, and it’s
like a second soprano with a
lower register,"’ Goggin said.
He has a three-octave range,
reaching very high notes and
rather low ones.

“You know. though, I am
not really singing as high as
the audience thinks I am,"
Goggin added. “More coun-
ter-tenors could probably be
found, but people are kind of
afraid to sing that way."

Though Solley does most
of the talking on stage, it is
Goggin who is the more talk-
ative off-stage. Goggin is .a
rather gentle person with an
enormous fund of musical
knowledge. He is the harpsi-
chordist and sings the har-
mony to Solley’s baritone.

Despite the fact that both
Goggin and Solley are rath-
er small, their voices are
rich and powerful. Goggin
says that he has no prob.
lems in maintaining his pitch
at either end of his range,
and his performance bears

& Committee Emphasizes

New Rules Philosophy

By JOHN WILLIAMS
Associate Editor

.A new philosophy for rules
of student conduct. which
would allow drinking on cam-
pus and open dorms, is the
major thrust of the Commit
tee on Rules and Punish-
ments report released today.

The entire code is based
upon the assumption of re-
sponsibility and maturity on
the part of the student. It
“emphasizes the responsible
use of freedom, as opposed
to license."

The consumption of alco-
holic beverages is permitted.
according to the sixth sec-
tion. in “‘private houses, fra
ternity houses, dormitory fa
cilities or other areas desig-
nated by the college adminis |
tration.” Drinking would
not be allowed outside these
areas. and ‘‘public drunken.
ness or irresponsible conduct
encouraged by the use of al-
cohol” are strictly prohibit-
ed.

drugs and firearms on the

Saxons because baroque mu-
sic was characteristic of
England, where the Anglo-
Saxons had lived. We could
hardly call ourselves ‘The
Anglos’, you know.”

“If we'd been smart, we
would have called ourselves
‘The Baroque Folk’, Gog-
gin added, “but we didn’t
think of it in time.”

campus is prohibited. The
admission of female visitors
to the dormitories will be
permitted during certain
hours on the weekends.

The code will be enforced
through a philosophy of dis-
cipline which will allow the
courts ‘‘to consider each in-
fraction individually and
make its decisions according
to the seriousness of the of
fense.””

A joint. student faculty

regulations court would be
established, consisting of six
students and six faculty
members. The. Honor Court
and honor regulations would
remain virtually intact.

Additional residence hall
house committees would be
set up under the new Resi-
dence Hall Association con-
sitution to deal with minor
violations of its rules.

Students Plan
To Seek Funds

Plans for a student campaign to raise $5,000
to match offers of $100 by two Davidson profes-
sors for Negro scholarships to Davidson are “‘com-
ing along very well,” according to Larry Slade,
spokesman for a group of students organizing the

drive.

Psychology professor W. G. Workman had
offered to match $2,400 from students with $100
to provide for a Negro scholarship, and was joined
this week by mathematics professor William Mc-
Gavock in an identical offer.

The Senior Class voted Thursday morning to
contribute to this fund as the senior class gift to
the school. The amount has not been set.

McGavock’s offer, however, was conditional
upon students first qualifying for Workman's of-
fer, which came in response to an editorial in THE
DAVIDSONIAN of March 21.

“ Slade said that students would be asked to
contribute to the scholarship fund Tuesday and

Wednesday.

Accompanying the scholarship, which would
be administered by the admissions office, would
be a concentrated student effort at recruiting

Plans also include an effort to get founda-

» tions to offer an equivalent amount of money
- each year for the next 10 years. Slade indicated
* that a substantial showing of student interest

would make this funding a possibility.

Bylaws Create New Office,
Permit Political Parties

By HUGH MARR
Staff Writer

New bylaws which include
a new office of chancellor
and provisions for political
parties on campus were rec-
ommended to the Senate by
the Constitutional Revision
Committee Monday. The
committee then dissolved it-
self.

The bylaws also suggest
the establishment of boards,
councils and legislative com-

mittees as agencies of the
Student Government Associa-

_tion, a treasurer appointed
by the Senate. and a filing -

fee of one dollar per candi-
date in elections.

Both the chancellor and
the treasurer are ‘‘to be on
the order of civil servants,"
according to Mike Bates,
committee chairman. The
bylaws provide that the
chancellor be appointed by
the SGA president and re-
sponsible to him, and that
the treasurer have had an
accounting course.

The provisions on political
parties limit the spending of
the party to $10 per office
for which it nominates candi-
dates, and require the nomi-
nation of all candidates in a
convention of all members of
the party,

Also recommended is re-
vision of the present bylaws
to allow candidates to spend
up to $10 in campaigning.

Legislative commit t ee s,
which include committees on
finance, the union and so-
cial life, the constitution. by-
laws and judiciary, eduoa-
tional affairs, residence halls,
and general affairs, are di-
rectly responsible to the Sen-
ate.

They function in the same
way as congressional com-
mittees, receiving bills and
recommending action on
them to the Senate.

Boards, which would be
autonomous, would be the

publications board, activities
grant board, YMCA board,
experimental college board,
elections board. and public
speakers.

Councils, classified as
‘semi-autonomous’ by the
bylaws, are the Social Coun-
cil, the Union Council, the
Freshman Council, and the
IMAC.

No Sale Made
By Bootlegger

A bootlegger visited
Davidson College Wed-
nesday in hopes of mak-
ing a safe to one of the
many liquor-starved stu-
dents here.

According to campus
security officer E. N.
Linker, several  stu-
-dents were approached
by a man in an old car
on the road behind the
college union. Although
there were no actual
sales made, it was evi.
dent, said the students,
that the man was carry-
ing liquor for sale.

The town police were
contacted and searched
the campus for the car,
but they were unable to
find it.
