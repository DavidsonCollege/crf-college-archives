\VIDSONIAN ANSWERS
TTACK OF QUEENS

“The Queens Blues,” a publication which
usually praisés seems to praise Davidson to

the stars, recently had a change of heart and

printed the following survey :

For example, let. the Queens French |

. Does this mean that Queens wishes to
break the friendly ties that have until late
seemed to exist? Is this.a true survey of
Queens opinion. We are indeed thankful
that two of the Queeits girls register some
recognition of their (ex?) brother college.

As one Queens lass has so aptly ex-
pressed it, “There aren’t many of us girls
over here at Queens, but the ones we have
are good, big and strong girls.”

CONDITIONS AT QUEENS
A couple of weeks ago I happened to get
hold of a college newspaper called the
Queens Blues. | wasn’t much interested
until | happened to notice that the qeustion
of the week in the “Galloping Poll’ was,
in effect, “How can relations, be improved

* between Davidson and Queens?”

At once interested, I eagerly perused the
column to find out what others think of
us. 1 was severly cut, for most of the
comments were of a very unflattering na-
ture.

and finally: ws informed

>~miles away, in Charlotte.

tance staring me in the

Accordingly b arrived-at the said institute
carly one Saturday evening and the—first

that-she-was one-of the gov-
ernesses at Queens,

1 discovered

“Would it be possible tor me to get a date
onight?” I asked. “No trouble at all!”
replied Miss B——, with a peculiar gleam
in her eye. She then consulted a noter
book and told me that 189 girls were free
that night and that I could have any one, or
more, that I preferred.

t

Casting aside any personal desires and
remembering that I was only studying
conditions, | said, “Well, I’d sort of like to
date’ a typical student. Who wottd-you
recommend ?”

“What a

coincidence!” ejaculated Miss

——~. “Miss Typical Queens was elected
only last week. He name is Cornflower
Maize. All the girls are crazy about her.”

“Fine,” I Said, and shortly Cornflower was
produced.

Miss Typical Queens

\lthough some might be prone to mini-
nuze Cornflower’s possbilities, yet all must
admit that she is certainly a person. She
came lumbering into the Date Mausoleum,
attractively bundled in a’ collegiate sweater
extending to’the knees, sleeves half rolled
up. Her chubby face, smeared with freckles,
had rosy cheeks that were indeed cheeks.
Her hair was fashionably -straight, extend-
carelessly to hér shoulders. Caustic
people might call it stringy, but I believe
it was definitely the most attractive thing
abeout-her,

“Hello, Cornflower,” I said .forcibly.
“Don't bé so /formal, Slimey,’” she said,
“just call me Coérny.” Obviously we were
already close friends, and I congratulated
myself on my progress.

ing

Corny has definitely been around and was
certainly not at a loss -as to what to do.
She immediately grabbed my hand and
jerked-me-up-to the steps-of the main hall,
where we'sat down.

Personality

“Don't it beat all what college’ll do
for you,” she began, “here I am getting
culture and having an elegant time both
together. I’m just crazy about Davidson
dances. I bet you cut a mean stomp.”

“Go-wan,” | mumbled, embarrassed.

“We oughta get together sometime, me
and you,” At this she moved closer,
squeezed my hand, and started whispering
sweet nothings in my, ear. “You and: me
oughta get together more, me and you.”
She sighed. Then softly, confidingly, in-
timately. “Gee it'd be elegant to go to Mid-
Winters:!”

Aloud bell. “What's that?” I said, jump-
up. Corny scowled. ‘Nine o’clock. Some-
hody else’s turn to date you. When boys
are here we switch every thirty minutes.”

Parting
Whereupon Corny looked at me coyly;
saying, “Pleased t’ve metcha. I’ll be seeing
you in February. Tee hee. Tee hee hee
hee.’ :
“Fee hee,” T muttered, and scurried out
the door. before anyone else came.
sack at Davidson I reflected on the events
of the evening, and particularly on Miss
Typical Queens, the lovely Cornflower
Maize. Certainly she wasn’t the niost at-
tractive girl I’d ever seen.

But she had one quality that is to be
highly acclaimed in anybody—thoughtful-
ness. She was really thoughtful. I got a
letter from her almost immediately with
a stamp enctosed. Very few people would
have been so thoughtful.
