Sunday School at Cowan's in
Flourishing Condition.

Among the thriving Sunday
schools conducted by the students
in the nearby school houses is one
conducted at Cowan’s. This cen-
ter of learning is about three miles
down the Concord road, midway be-
tween Shearers chapel and New
Hope Baptist Church.

Five days in the weck the boys
and girls of the community gather
in the school house for
knowledge and on the Sabbath they
congregate for instruction in right-
eousness. The instructors who go
out are C. N. Morrison, superintend-
ent, and T. A. Lacy, T. A. Freeman
and F, L. Brown, teachers.

Despite the fact that Cowan’s is
$0 near the other two religious cen-
ters and that no services are held
in the summer, the attendance has
been good this fall and much inter-
est, has been shown, both by the
pupils and those who go out as
teachers. C. N. Morrison is super-
intendent of this school.

Talk a V Impressive One—
Many Helpful gestions
Thrown Out

At the “Y” service last Sunday
night Dr. Harding endeavored to
show the stdents how to convince
themselves of the reality of God.
He first pointed out fallacies in
many commen modes of reasoning,
showing that a firm conviction
could not be based on mere com-
monly accepted doctrines, or the ex-
istence of a church, or reports of
supernatural occurrences. He also
showed that mere reasoning is dan-
gerous because it does not reckon
with the infinite.

He next said that God could be
approached either thru the ible or
thru everyday experiences. The
Biblical proofs rest largely on his-
torical evidence, fulfillment of
prophecy, and the writings of Paul.
Then there are so many evidences
of God in nature and everyday life
that every observant person is re-
peatedly confronted by the extreme
probability of a God. “And moral
certainty,” says the doctor, “arises
from balanced and cumulative prob-
ability.” He cautioned the — stu-
dents, however, that they should
make their tests in an open-minded
manner and that they should not al-
low the presence of difficulties to
stop them in their search.

He closed with the striking state-
ment that a man has everything to
gain and nothing to lose by belicf
in God, for if there were a God they

Bible Classes.

That’s the stuff! Every dormitory
on the hill showed an increase in
the number at the Bible classes Sun-
day morning. There’s only three
more Sundays before the holidays,
so this good record should be con-
tinued. There’s plenty of room for
the rest of the fellows who were
not there Sunday.

Harrell chose as his book “Vic-
tory Through Surrender,” by B. F.
Mills. In giving the message of this
book he said: A full life comes only
through a full and definite surren-
der of that life to God. Once this
surrender is made, have the faith to
count. this result accomplished, and
it will be accomplished. Your faith
will be tried, but wait on God, and

When an agent signs a contract with the Southern Life and Trust
Company, we don’t pat him on the back, turn him loose and tell him to
“go to it.” We give him a preliminary correspondence course, and then
a course in our Training School at the Home Office, and then keep in
touch with him and help him overcome his weak points and strengthen
his strong points. As a result, our Training School men are making good.
Drop us a line and ask us to give you full particulars.
