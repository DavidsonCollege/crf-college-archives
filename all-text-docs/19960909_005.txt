Once again Davidson made
its mark; this time it was with Olym-
pic style and flair. As Atlanta
showcased itself during the Olym-
pics, so did Davidson, its staff, and
its students.

Edand Marlys Daugherty, co-
directors of Davidson outdoors
played an integral role in the Olym-
pic white water slalom event at the
Ocoee River in Tennessee. The
Daughertys had positions spotting
on the venue announcing team
where they updated the announc-
ers on positions, biographies, and
the times of the paddlers.

According to Ed, “Tt was re-
ally exciting to be part of an event
that size.” What impressed the
Daughertys most was the appre-
ciation that the fans gave all the
athletes, not just the Americans.

Freshmen experience an all new Odyssey

By Jonn DuNwoopy

More incoming freshmen than
ever were able to fun-duck through
rapids named “Jaws” and “Death”,
hike the Appalachian Trail despite
blisters and backbreaking back-
packs, and dig holes in the ground
as makeshift toilets this summer
when Davidson’s Odyssey pro-
gram celebrated its 10th anniver-
sary.

As far back asthe fall of 1986,
13 students embarked upona week-
end experience, marking the first
Odyssey Session.

The following year, 1987, the
first summer session led 54 stu-
dents in five crews.

This summer a total of 115
incoming freshmen were able to
participate in the program, which
used a lottery system to select par-
ticipants when applicants outnum-
bered available openings in past
years.

In the past, the Odyssey has
always been held during the week
prior to Freshmen Orientation.

_ This year Davidson Outdoors
tried a different approach to run-
ning the Odyssey, by offering five
Odyssey sessions throughout the

some of the variables.

A press release sent out by U.
S. News last Thursday confirms
that the methodology used to rank
schools this year differs from last
year. The release states, this year’s
“rankings are not directly compa-
rable to last year’s.”

Kelton says, “I don’t think the rat-
ings tell you much about the qual-
ity of an education ... I’m confi-
dent that this is not a good way to
pick a college.”

John Kuykendall says of
Davidson’s much improved fin-
ish, “It is nice to be included in
such good company.”

summer.

“The experience for all par-
ticipants was greatly improved
from the previous years. All the
sessions were essentially the same,
but each individual trip had its own
special events and memories,” says
Ed Daugherty, Co-Chair of
Davidson Outdoors.

With an increase in the size of
the program the total cost for the
Odyssey went up. The Dean of
Student Office helped out in the
area of financial aid by offering
full and partial Odyssey Scholar-
ships.

Because of this aid, eight stu-
dents who otherwise would not
have been able to participate were
awarded money for the program.

Another big change was the
decision to pay trip leaders. Previ-
ously, students led Odyssey trips
and participated in the program’s
logistical operations on a volun-
teer basis.

“Tt was a lot of work organiz-
ing 5 sessions, but the trip leaders
were so organized and systematic
that the preparation for each ses-
sion became fairly predictable and
easy,” says Ed Daugherty.

Odyssey trip leader Katie —

Lannon, a sophomore, says, “It

was much more professional hav-.

ing trained leaders.”

Leaders were housed in
Lingle Manor throughout the sum-
mer and were personally trained

by Ed and Marlys Daugherty.

Ed believes such unbiased support

is “truly the Olympic experience.”
Many Davidson students were

also key factors at the Olympics.

Freshman Jennie Hillmann
was an Olympic torch bearer in
Wake Forrest, North Carolina.
Nominated and chosen by a na-
tional board, Jennie says, “It was a
lot of fun. The whole town was
watching, and I never have felt so
important in my life.”

Kate Stevens, a junior, was in
Atlanta this summer as a produc-
tion intern for the Olympic’ s open-
ing and closing ceremonies. Her
job included rehearsal operations
and field marking. ;

“It was amazing,” Stevens
says. “At one point I was down on
my knees spelling out Atlanta with
markers, and then I was filming it
spelled out by actual people. It
was neat knowing that I had a part

“Being a part of the Olympics
was an awesome experience,”
agrees freshman Angela Fisher,
who worked in the Olympic Vil-
lage as a front desk supervisor.
“Everyone I worked with was re- ‘
ally cool. They were from all over
the world, and because of this, I
learned a lot from them.”

Along with its student body,
Davidson College was also able to
showcase its new facilities. Both
the Canadian and German volley-
ball teams trained at the Baker
Sports Complex before traveling
to Atlanta.

Lee Sargent, Davidson’s
Game Management Director, co-
ordinated this event and was also
able to travel to Atlanta to see one
of the games.

He was most impressed by the
spirit that everyone involved
showed for the Olympic experi-
ence.
