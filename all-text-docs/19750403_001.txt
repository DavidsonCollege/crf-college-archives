Moving toward a full week service

College to expand counseling program

Bv MATTHEW COVINGTON
News Editor

College President Samuel R.
Spencer Jr. approved a plan for
four full days per week of
psychological counseling for the
1975-76 academic year and com-
mitted $2000 toward contracting
for a fifth day of service.

College Psychologist Amelia
Dockery will counsel two days
each week next year as opposed
to her present one day of ser-
vice. Dr. W. Gatewood Work-
man and Dr. Meredith Hall will
continue to work one day per
week. College administrators
are hopeful that a contract for a
fifth day of counseling will be
signed soon.

Students are usig_ the
psychologists more this year
than they have in the past. This
fact has made the expafsion of
service from 4 to 5 days a week
a neccessity.

“From September to Decem-
ber of 1973, Holl. @ Workman--
we didn’t have Dockery at this
time--conducted 100 hours of
counseling for students. This
represents meeting with 55
students. During the same
period in 1974, 156 students used
the same service’’, said Dean of
Students Will H. Terry.

Traditionally, spring term is
the heaviest term for the coun-
selors. People’s problems tend
to»build up to a pitch in the
spring. We need the extra coun-
selor for this time’’, said Terry.

The present system. has Hall
working for the college two
days a week, Workman and
Dockery each having one day.
Hall has expressed that in
January, February and Oc-
tober, people were having to ait
ober a week for an ap-
pointment. The study and
resulting xpansion of services
will elleviate the problem.

The study that is being made
will be a total evaluation of the

Davidson. Part of this study is a
look at the problems that seem
to re-occur with students.

‘“‘We are studying the paterns
of epetitive problems which is a
list of probles students have
over and over. Each of the
problems we are looking at has
been confirmed by the
psychologists as having oc-
curred at least twice.

“The problems that seem to
re-occur are problems with

academic pressure, social
pressure, racial bias, sexual
problems, and drinking

problems. The psychologists
have checked each of these
problems at least twice , of
course it may be the same per-
son each time.

“The fact that these problems
re-occur does not really mean.

problems that are. bothering the
students. A student com-
plaining about pressure may
really just be saying that he is
not satisfied with his lifestyle.
He may have more deep-seated
problems that don’t come out
until after 3 or 4 hours of coun-
seling,,’said Terry.

The study of psychological
counseling will reveal a number
of other troubles with the
present system of counseling.

“The problem is much more
complex than whether or not to
hire someone for an extra day.
We need a long and hard
evaluation to see how much we
need to change. Coupled with
these concerns is how much we
can aford. I would. agree that we
need to provide a full-time coun-
selor--that is*the equivalent of
one counselor 5 times a week.”’

Gatewood Workman, Dr.
Meredith Hall, and Dr. Amelia
Dockery at last Tuesday’s
meeting.

“We regard our primary fun-

ction here as meeting the stu-

dents who get unhappy, dis-
turbed, anxious or distressed.

We are not primarily here for
vocational guidance, or to help
students decide on their
major,’’ Workman stated.

Workman added that all three
counselors at Davidson ap-
proach the matter from a diff-
erent point.

Dockery has been working at
Davidson since last September,
one day a week.

She spoke about the situation
in which she usually sees
people. She said that people who
came in to see her were in an
unfair situation usually, and her
job was to balance this out.

Hall, who has spoken to the
Senate before, stressed the
point that he did not see himself
as a therapist or a counselor; he
tried to develop personal con-
tact.

In response to a question of
whether present coverage is
adequate, Workman stated, ‘If
we had six psychologists they
would be overworked, for the
work will grow to fill the time
available.

“I would like“to0 see more
available than there is now,” he
added.

“I don’t think the time would
be wasted, you have to draw a

“All funds will be ap-
propriated through the college.
The Senate will not appropriate
any funds for counseling. ae

“Between the students and
the college here will be a fifth
day of counseling a week with a
total cost to the program of
$16,000’’, said Munce.

According to Munce, the
evaluation of psychological
counseling must proceed in wo
ways.:

“We are working this spring
first to find out what in-
struments; by instruments I
mean information we need to
get from the counselors them-
selves without violating the con-
fidence their patients have for
them, we need to evaluate the.
program. Secondly, we are get-

‘ting advice and help rom

knowledgeable people outside

line, but I would say at David-
son the line is drawn too low,”’
Hall responded.

Dockery added, ‘‘I feel that I
could spend more time if I had
it.”” She maintained that even if
the covereage increased , the
population covered might not
necessarily increase.

Senator Dana English presen-
ted a resolution supporting the
college’s hiring of three dif-
ferent counselors for four af-
ternoons a week. Senator Mar-
tin Eakes amended _ the
resolution to ask the college to
hire counselors for five af-
ternoons a week.

Eakes’ amendment also
directed the Senate to return
$2,000 College President Samuel
R. Spencer Jr. offered them to
provide for a fifth day of coun-

the community. If we stayed in-
side the college we might get in-
side bias’’, said Munce.

The Senate has not voted on
its recommendation to the
college as to who to hire for the
extra day.

“I think it will be the recom-
mendation of the Senate that
there be 1 day a‘week of Dr.
Workman, paid for by the
college, 2 days for Mrs.
Dockery, and 2 days for Dr.
Hall.

Counseling is a definite need
within the Davidson community
and is is a community respon-
sibility. The Senate recognizes
this and: also that the college
has a committment of a
significant nature to the com-
munity. The Senate doesn’t
want to interfere with this com-
mittment.

Workman

Psychologists identify campus roles

seling. The Senate would also
give the college a $1,000 gift
given to them to improve coun-
seling.

‘‘We should give it back to the
college, since this would sim-
plify the contract. It is also not
the role of the Senate. Our con-
cern now is to get out of the con-
tracting and give it back to
them (the college),’’ Eakes
stated.

It was added that a fifth day
of counseling would cost $5,000
under the original proposal.
This would necessitate the
Senate financing the remaining
$2,000 through its own sources.

The resolution was _ tabled
waiting further consultation
with Spencer.

There were no Senators ab-
sent from the meeting. .
