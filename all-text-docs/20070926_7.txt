Getting acquainted with Brando ?

By MIKE WELLMAN
Arts & Living Editor

Marlon Brando may be one of the most
influential actors ever to have graced the
screens of Hollywood. Nominated seven
times for Best Actor by the Academy and
winning twice, Brando was world-renowned
for his raw screen presence, his antics in the
backlot and his influence on American cul-
ture over his almost half-century long career.

Brando made headlines when, as a means
of protesting the depiction of Native

Americans in film, he became the second -

actor to refuse to accept an Oscar after he
won Best Actor for his performance in “The
Godfather.”

Brando crusaded for the civil rights move-
ment, the rights of Native Americans and the
Jewish Zionist movement. If you’re in the
mood for powerful drama and great acting,
then these Marlon Brando movies may be
perfect for you.

A Streetcar Named Desire ~ One of
Brando’s earlier movies, “Streetcar” was his
breakout performance. In this adaptation of
Tennessee Williams famed play, “Streetcar”
tells the story of Blanche Dubois, a fragile
and desperate woman who arrives on her sis-
ter’s doorstep in a state of panic after losing

her family’s plantation. The frenzied emo-
tions of a woman attempting to escape her
past and the brutish, conniving nature of
Brando’s Stanley Kowalski create tension at
every turn. Stanley’s interactions with
Blanche and his anguish-filled cries of
“Stella” are what old Hollywood is made of.

On the Waterfront — Another film direct-
ed by Elia Kazan, Waterfront tells the story
of a simpleton ex-boxer who moves from the
ring to working as a small-time crook for the
corrupt boss of a dockers’ union. Terry
Malloy (Marlon Brando) falls in love with
the sister of a man he unwittingly helped kill,
and the conflicting senses of morality and
justice move him to reconsider his life and
fight back. With the drama of an unfolding
underworld of corruption and Brando’s pen-
sive, charming nature, I consider this
Brando’s best performance.

Apocalypse Now — Directed by Francis |
Ford Coppola (“The Godfather”),
“Apocalypse” retells the story of “Heart of
Darkness” in the context of the Vietnam War.
Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) is sent on a
mission to eliminate a renegade military out-
post led by. the lauded Captain Kurtz
(Brando), and travels through a jungle where
the darkness of the human soul overtakes
men. Though Brando primarily viewed
among shadows, does not receive much air-
time in the film, does convey well the
depravity that Kurtz is driven to during war.
The redux version of the film is also avail-
able and makes the already epic film sub-
stantially longer, but the material is worth
seeing.
