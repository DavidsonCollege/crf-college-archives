STRIKING ANALOGY

Said That Science and Religion Cor-
respond and That Neither One
Refutes Other

In his first appearance before the local
Y.M.C. A. on last Sunday night, Dr. Fraser
Hood made a very interesting talk, using as
his general theme an analogy between the
Tree of Life and a human life.

He took three texts, one from the first
book of the Bible, one from the last book,
and the main text from Psalms 1:3. All
references, Genesis 2:9: “The tree of life
also in the midst of the garden;” Revelations
22:2: “In the midst of the street of it, and
on either side of the river, was thére a tree
of life,” and the main text: “And he shall
be like a tree,” had as their central thought
The Tree of Life.

In developing his theme Doctor
in its entirety had found life.
which man is like a tree were shown in a
striking manner,

For a tree to flourish it must have its roots
deep within the earth to receive nourishment
from the soil. It must reach out into the
surrounding atmosphere to receive carbon
dioxide, so necessary for its existence. These
two sources, the earth. and the atmosphere,
furnish the raw materials needed by the tree.

The source from which the tree obtains
power is from the sun. It is the sunlight |=
that causes the photosynthesis by coming into
contact with the products from the soil and
carbon dioxide from the air. The most pow-
erful agency in the life of the tree is from
an external source, the sun.

In drawing the parallelism between the
life of the tree and the life of man, the
speaker first brought to the attention of the
students the fact that man must have an
economic foundation his livelihood. It
is the Christian's duty to provide a living
for his family, and to provide more than a
bare sustenance. The teaching of Paul that

The first opportunity for the students of
Davidson to sce the wrestling team in action
will be next Saturday night, January 10th,
when the Wildcat grapplers meet the team
from Concord “Y” in a return meet. These
teams met at Concord on December 12th and
the Davidson aggregation emerged as con-
querors, 30-0.

The meet next Saturday promises to be
better than the previous one. In ‘the last
meet Concord was handicapped by the ab-

sence of several of their best men. They are

expecting to put up a better fight next Sat- |

A etieeeneriteecnin tt trip for the ‘tennis team
in the spring, as tentatively announced by
M. S. Beall, manager of the Davidson tennis
squad, has caused quite a stir of interest in
the ranks of tennis enthusiasts during the '
past week. The tentative schedule, showing
matches with the leading teams in North
Carolina, Virginia and Maryland, is said to
|be the most extravagant ever drawn up for
local netmen.

The trip will start on April 13th, at Win-
| ston-Salem, with a match at the Winston- ,
Salem Country Club, and will end with the
contest at Washington and Lee, April
25th. With the exception of two pending
matches, the ‘schedule is complete, and in

singles championship, captain of the Wildcat
team, and one eof Davidson's most brilliant
players; M. S. Beall, manager of the team

Black’s most spectacular netmen; Tom

in South—Signs of Great
University
Fulfilling the one condition of Mr, Duke's
bequest of $6,000,000 to the school, the trus-
tees of Trinity College last week agreed that
the name should be changed to Duke Uni-
versity. The institution should be congratu-
lated that it was broad-minded enough to
make this slight change in order to receive
the benefits of the generous donation of Mr.

Duke.

The new institution will remain under the
same powe but will be built into
a huge university that will in time rival Yale
and Harvard and other great universities of
the North. This part of the South will soon
rival any section of the country along educa-
tional lines.

The whole array of buildings will
harmonize with the surroundings, and when
the proposed building program is carried out,
this place will rival any in the United States
or abroad. It will worked out much
along the lines that Princeton has used to
make the latter one of the
campuses anywhere,

This institution bids fair to become the
most influential in the entire South, With
the great endowment and the steady approp
riation or allotment that will come in regu
larly each year, there will be no lack of funds
with which to maintain it. It is expected
that more students will be attracted to Duke
University, which will soon rival the Uni
versity in size and prestige.
