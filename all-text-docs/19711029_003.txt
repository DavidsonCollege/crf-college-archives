Davidson College reached one-half of its annual goal of 400
pints in the Red Cross Blood Drive held Wednesday in Chambers
Banquet Hall. Capt. Theodore Severn of the ROTC Department,
who coordinated the drive, expressed the hope that the addition-
al 200 pints would be collected in the spring.

All Students Allowed Use
Of Honors College Building

So now that the Carolina Inn
looks like a palace on the in-
side and a restored building on
the outside, who uses it? Who
is allowed to use it?

“The building is intended for
the use of the honors college
student,” said Dean of the Hon- vites application from any ©

Debate Team Reveals Ability
To Argue On Current Issues

By THOM NICOLL
Staff Writer

One varsity team at David-
son grants no_ scholarships,
practices in Eu Hall, and main-
tains a healthy record against
schools from all over the South
and East.

And though the alumni are
somewhat less excited about it
than football and_ basketball,
the Davidson debate team
seems to be on something of
an upswing.

Marshalling all of their rea-
son and rhetorical prowess on
one question during the first
quarter, the debaters have come
out of two matches with an 8-6
record and will enter two im-
portant events within the next
two weeks.

The national debate topic,
chosen by the American Foren-
sic Association is ‘Resolved:
that greater controls should be
imposed on the gathering and
utilization of information about
U. S. citizens by governmental
agencies.”

According to the team's new
coach, Mrs. Jean Cornell, the
team never knows until the
moment of the debate whether
it will speak for the affirmative
or negative: thus the debaters
must be prepared with well-
researched material for either
supporting or refuting the argu-
ment.

The debaters’ first engage-
ment of the vear was a N. C.
Debate Conference held at Le-
noir Rhyne. Davidson took five
of the six debates entered, com-
peting against such schools as
Wake Forest, Pembroke, and
Appalachian.

Johnston remarked that din--

the kitchen were. still not in

caping in the rear of the buiid-
ing everything else was com-
plete.

Some outside groups have al-
ready used the facilities. Over

less, they must be cleared ahead
of time on the calendar.

“Of course,” Johnston added,
‘We will have honors college
sessions ourselves when we get
settled, but we have no more
elaborate facilities in mind for
the present.”

Johnston commented that if
anyone adopted the building for
his personal study, he certainly
would not evict them because
they were not a part of the
honors college. He added that

The Davidson students who
spoke at Lenoir Rhyne included
Rich Damewood, Bil! Eskridge,

Les Phillips, Paul Mitchell,
John Douglas, and Thomas
Kent.

Last weekend, Eskridge and
Douglas won three of the eight
debates they entered in a match
at Chapel Hill. The opposing
entrees included Maryland, An-
napolis, John Hopkins, and oth-
ers.

On Nov. 5-7, Eskridge, Phil-
lips, Douglas, and Kent will
participate in one of the most
famous debating events in the
country, the ‘Peachtree De-
bate” at Emory.

Generally, all of the debates
consist of eight to 10 rounds,
each lasting about an_ hour,
their final and octo-finals. All
of the speakers are judged and
given critiques on their argu-
ments and delivery. Some ev-
ents also include contests in
oral interpretation of literature
and ex temporaneous speaking.

This year, after some time
without a debate coach, the col-
lege gave Mrs. Cornell that
position, besides her speech
teaching duties.

Junior Bill Eskridge, a third
year debater, provided in ring-
ing tones a demonstration of
the effects of so much debating.

‘First of all, the essential
purpose of debating at Davidson
College is to foster the ability

—

of a student to argue coherently
a subject which he has re-
searched.

“In addition, the values are
as follows:

“One, debating aids one’s
ability to reason. It teaches one
to see both sides of an issue.

“Second, it aids one in de-
veloping the skills of organiza-
tion in speaking and in writing.

“Third, debating enables one
to develop his speaking ability.
For instance, all but the first
affirmative speech are to a
certain degree ex temporane-
ous.

‘Fourth, debating aids one in
leraning research techniques,
which is essential for many
areas of graduate work.”

Eskridge pointed to the team’s
winning record, and stated, ‘I
feel certain that this year we
will end our season with a bet
ter record than the football

team.”
