To Start Or Not?

With almost 6,000 season ti¢kets already sold or
accounted for, it appears that’ quite a few people are
expecting spectacular results out of. the 1958-69 Da-
vidson basketball team. For the team’s sake, I hope
that old business cliche, “The customer is always
right,” is relevent here.

With the exception of Rodney Knowles, who is
now up for sale by the Phoenix club, and Tom Young-
dale, who is rumored to be in the Charlotte vicinity,
last year’s team is still intact. (We also lost Bob Pickens
but subs don’t count). Many observers believe that the
starting team this year will be the same as last year’s.
I’m not so sure.

| won‘t go as far as to agree with Lefty’s pre-
season statement to the team that “all starting posi-
tions are open.” But I will agree with him that there
could be one or two changes this year. Lefty told us
that he wanted two good rebounders, two good de-
fensive players, and one good all-around player for his
starting five and it appears he has yet to make his
final decision.

Still some things never change. Unless something
happens to Maloy physically, he will definitely start.
With a fair jump shot he developed this summer and
a wing-span between six and seven feet for blocking
shots, Mike’s a sure bet. Anyway, Sports Hlustrated
would probably sue Lefty if he didn't.

Moser’s another sure thing. Dave has the two years
experience it takes to figure out Lefty’s offense at the
point position. After several defensive performances
Dave contributed last year against fine players like
West Virginia’s Ron Williams, he'll make the starting
five as Lefty’s all-around player.

It seems that the remaining three starting posi-
tions are a toss-up between five players. Cook, Kirley,
Kroll, O'Neill, and Huckel all have a good shot at it.

Cook and Kirley have the size and muscle to play
underneath with Maloy, but lately Lefty has been
using Steve at the wing position. Steve has a fine out-
side shot from the corner but he still hasn’t learned
that he’s supposed to go around or over screens in-
stead of through them. Doug said he likes having Steve
in the game because “No one starts anything.” Not too
many players started anything with Doug last year as
1 remember.

The real battle this year is at the. wing or the
forward poistion. Besides the possibility of Kirley,
Kroll and Huckel are back from last year’s starting
team and Mike O'Neill is trying and playing harder.
than he did in the last three seasons put together.

Jerry had a problem with tendons or ligaments in
his foot earlier this season but now he’s back hustling
more than ever. Huckel had his much-publicized ulcer
and could only watch for several weeks but now he’s
hitting the floor with regularity. He could be back in
his old position opening night if he doesn’t have a
relapse from Lefty's yelling.

O'Neill figures that since it is his senior year, it’s
now or never for a chance to be a starter. Maybe he
didn’t like the guys on the bench last season or he
remembers his sophomore year when he did start.
Either way he’s proving he should get a chance. Al-
though he doesn’t have Kirley’s size, Mike tries to go
through screens on defense like Steve.

Lefty’s problem is making or finding a team from
all the individuals running around on the court.

After last Saturday’s scrimmage with Tennessee,
we find, as Lefty says, “that we’re not as good as we
think we are.’ We didn’t do well at all in the morning
scrimmage and although we won the afternoon re-
match, two of their starting players were injured.
Tennessee isn't nearly as good as half the teams on our
schedule this year:

Our skin team (substitutes) rolled over Tennessee’s
subs in continuing our undefeated skin scrimmage
record for three years. Two years ago we beat N. C.
State’s subs, last year we took Georgia’s subs, and this
year it was the Vols. The subs always scrimmage for
a half after the starters finish with their full game.

We have a week left until we play our first game
against VMI in Johnston Gym. Without the students
here because of Thanksgiving recess, the atmosphere
will be different, but we should win with whoever

starts. We had better.

Kappa Sigs Capture
IMAC Wrestling

By BILL BERRY
Asst. Sports Editor
Strength in the heavier
weight classes enabled the
Kappa Sigs to pull away from
the field and capture the
IMAC wrestling tournament
held on Monday and Tuesday

nights.

The Sigs scored 120 points.
largely a result of victories
by Hal Young in the 160-
pound class, Dave Troxler
in the 177-pound class. and
Brian Pittman in the 191-
pound class.

The sigs were trailed by the
Phi Delts with 107 points and
the Pikas with 100.* The Sig-
ma Nus were a distant fourth
with 66.25 points.

The tournament was one of
the most competitive of re-
cent years. In every weight-
class except the 123-pound
division, the wrestler who
won the championship had to
defeat at least three men
to do so. The large number
of entries resulted in top.
quality competition in all
the championship matches.

None of the final matches
were runaways. but prob
ably the most exciting were
the championships in the 130.
137, 145 and 177-pound weight
classes.

In the 130-pound champion
ship Sig Ep Randy Carter
edged Phi Delt Jack Cald-
well, 3-1, with a reversal in
the last minute.

Pika Pat Bray pulled a
similar feat in the 137 pound
division as he scored a take.

down on Kappa Sig Tate Hol-
brook in the final seconds to
win, 4-2.

In the 145 pound class Bart
Walker of the Betas staged
a tremendous comeback to
defeat Independent Bill Shutt.
Walker was down, 6-0. but
rallied to win, 8-6.

The match which brought
the biggest crowd résponse
was the 177-pound champion-
ship between Troxler and
Phi Delt Pierce Irby. Trox-
ler won by a fall, but the

match was still extremely
close.
Champions in the other

divisions were Pika John
Benbow in the 123-pound
class, Phi Delt Al Jasper in
the 152-pound class, Indepen-
dent Dave. Dilley in the 160
pound class, and SAE Stuart
Shelton in the heavyweight
division.

Sparse participation’ ham-
pered the freshman competi-
tion. East-1 won more _in-
dividual championships. but
Cannon-2 was able to amass
more points because they
had more men entered. Al
most everyone who entered
was assured of at least
second place just by enter.
ing. and even one champion
ship was decided by forfeit.

Individual winners were
Greg Anderson of Watts-3 in
the 137 pound class, Hugh
Gaither of Cannon-! in the
145 pound class. Robert And.
erson of East-1 in the 152-
pound class, Whit Ayres of
East-I in the 160-pound class,

earned his share of the glory
in last Friday's game with

Sockwell had the pleasure
of intercepting the Baby
Paladins’ two point conver.
sion attempt which actually
saved a 21-20 win for David

“I didn't realize what had
happened until I got back to

comment on the clutch in-
terception.

Nevertheless, the inter.
ception denied Furman a
victory in the closing mo

Freshman Coach Gene Mc-

to see the interception. yet
he could not understand how
Sockwell got there to make
the catch. .

McEver commended the
defensive unit for their ex

to be the deciding factor in
the game.

The victory gave the fresh.

year, and McEver felt that
“the boys came along with a

But you could never teil
from the way Virginia Tech
played here Saturday.

What happened? -How can
a team reportedly as weak
as Davidson College score an
unbelievable 9-7 upset over
a team as talented and as
powerful as Tech?

Was it Johnny Watkins de
cision to run a punt out of the
Tech end zone that resulted
in the winning safety?

Was it a holding penalty
on a 71-yard = screen pass
from Elmer Reed to Ron
Hawkins that called back
what could have been the
winning touchdown?

Was it several passes drop-
ped in the open by Tech re.
ceivers?

Was it an injury to Warren
Price that prevented the dar.
ing little Tech quarterback
from seeing any action?

Was it the Davidson de
fense that consisted of seven
formations and moved with
the snap of the ball?

Was it the Wildcat’s basic
game offense that had been
narrowed to some 10 running
plays?

No, it wasn’t any one single
event that caused the upset.
You could hardly blame Wat-
kins’ mental lapse. Nor
could you say anything to
the Tech player who held on
the screen. And the absence
of Price shouldn’t have made
any difference.

The Gobblers should have
had it wrapped up in the
first quarter. Price or no

Lack Of Big Scoring Threat

fonso Carillo, took as many
shots himself as the whole
team took in some games

By DON PARMAN
Sports Writer
Soccer coach Harry Fogle.
man summed up the frustra-

tions of the Wildcat team
in one sentence, “This was
to have been the year, but
we just couldn't score.”

Lack of scoring punch was
the big weakness as the
Wildcats dropped to their
second losing season under
Fogieman in his eight years
as head coach. The record
was 4-6-1.

“Potentially we had a real
good team this year,” Fogle-
man said. ‘We had good per-
somnel, as good as I've ever
had at Davidson.”

“The biggest problem was
lack of punch and lack of
shots," according to Fogle-
man. In games that the team
lost they were taking 14 to
19 shots while shooting 36
and 38 times in winning ef-
forts.

Fogleman refused to put
the blame on individuals and
pointed to the absence of a
player to take the shots. Last

this year. “With Alfonso I
think we wouldn't have lost
a game this year," Fogle.
man stated flatly.

Lack of the big scorer in
the center of the line is evi-
denced by wing Bill Horton's
team leading 5 goals, the
first time a wing has led the
team in scoring.

The team got off to a slow
start as a result of poor
conditioning. The first mat-
ches pitted the Wildcats
against teams which had al.
ready been in two or three
contests.

Fogleman believes he has
corrected this problem by
dropping the two earliest
matches next year so that
the team can be in shape for
the opener.

A major obstacle in prac-
tice was the absence of at
least one member of the
team for each practice due
to afternoon classes and labs.

As a result the team lacked
some of the teamwork and
unity necessary for a good
offense.

The season had its bright
spot too. Captain Cliff Patter-
son is a strong possibility
for all-South honors and the
two wings, Horton and Roger
Peterson, are also under
consideration.

The team has a strong
nucleus returning for next
year with Patterson, Peter-
son, Randy Carter and Hor-
ton in the line: Rich Cowart,
Mike Taylor and Dick Alli.
son at fullback and Frank
Heiner and Steve Culbers-
ton at goalie.

Fogleman sees Peterson
and Patterson as all-Ameri-
can candidates on a winning
team next year. Patterson
who was elected captain for
the second consecutive year
was expected to score more.
but was ‘‘so great on defense
that he concentrated on that
and was timid about trying
to shoot,"’ according to Fog-
leman.

Fogleman thinks Peterson,
who is completely recovered
from a knee injury, could be
the best wing ever to play at
Davidson. He led the team
with six assists this year.

Heiner and Culberston are
also held in high regard by
Fogleman, who says that in
time they may be the best
two goalies ever to play for
the Wildcats.

scheduled, they were deter
mined to do their best.

Upset it was. However, one
can do nothing but: praise the
Wildcats for the manner in
which they recorded the vic-
tory.

it wasn’t decided on any
fluke play. It was the result
of 60 minutes of ovtstanding
play by the entize Davidson
squad that cympletely do
minated the action.

“They were a heck of a
ball club out there today,"’
commented Coach Frank
Moseley as he sat quietly in
the Tech dressing room.

“It was a 1 to 1,000 long
shot," said Dole amiid the
bedlam that erupted in the
Davidson quarters. *'It is like
winning the Kentucky Derby.
‘We had hoped to make a
good game of it but I'll have
to admit that this is even
greater than I had hoped."

back, was typical of the real-
istic Wildcats.

“We aren't footing our-
selves,’ Morton said. ‘‘We
know we have no business

beating them. We aren’‘t in
their class. But when we
came up here yesterday we
all made up our minds to do
our best so that we wouldn’t
go home embarrassed.”

Morton said the offense had
been narrowed to 10 running
plays ‘so we could get our
blocking down and make as
few mistakes as possible.”
Davidson also planned to use

the full 25 seconds to get-

off each play and to throw
few passes in a move to con.
trol the ball.

A pair of sophomores: -
center Joe Ansley and full
back Carl Hunt - were given
the duties of calling the
Davidson defenses. ‘We
planned to move on the ball.”
Dole explained, ‘‘tbhat way we
wouldn't give them what we
lined up in.”

But despite the moving de.
fense and limited, delaying
offense, the Wildcats still had
no! business winning.

Morton said he knew an up-
set was possible but certain-
ly not probable. “We knew
they (Tech) weren't worried
about us." the quarterback
explained. “‘And we didn't
think they would be playing
their best. We did the same

There was really ‘nothing
Moseley and his players
could say. It was quite evi.
dent that they had been the
victim of probably the bigg-
est. upset of the week and
the biggest of the decade in
the Southern Conference.

Several Gobblers got a
little rough on a Davidson
running play during the final
moments. A Tech lineman
drew a 15-yard roughness
penalty.

“Hey, you big $S%T@*bT”’
yelled one Wildcat player
from the sidelines. ’’Can‘t
you take a licking from little
Davidson.”

“Don't say anything to

“He's feeling bad enough as

Truer words were never

Smith Dislikes Records,

Imagine ° yourself as the
head football coach of a
team that has just beaten a
rival Wofford -squad by an
impressive 24-9 margin as
three of your star players
from the offense broke a
total of six school and five

Smith said, reflecting back.

tunes thus far this season.
“Our primary purpose is
naturally to win.”’

Winning, unfortunately, is
something that Davidson has
had trouble doing. Despite
the impressive statistics that
the Wildcats carry, David-

in just three of their eight
