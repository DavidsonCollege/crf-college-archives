The Aircraft Shenandosh |
Pays Hill Midnight Visit

Pride of the Navy Skips Charlotte |
to Fly Over Old Davidson

And the students of Davidson College did
get to see the hig cigar that floated silently |
over here last Tuesday night while the in-!
habitants of Charlotte and Gastonia waited |
in vain for the pride of Uncle Sam's Navy.
Ample information had been received some
time in advance by means of radio and other
means of intelligence. When the Shenan-
doah came and after a big whoop from Red
Smith, who was perched on top of the tank,
the boys, new and old, came scurrying like
rats from their rooms. The big dirigibhk
slithered directly over their heads, the five
motors sending a boom that the
ozone around about.

The Shenandoah was on the first lege of
her 9,000 mile trial trip, which is the longest
that a craft of this kind has ever taken.
The giant balloon started from Washington
at 4:00 o'clock, and it reached Davidson at
high midnight. The moonlight and all othe-
natural accessories were exactly right for
glimpsing her high above, and the boys took
full advantage of the magnificent sight. Of
course, one or two got scared and ran in th:
buildings for fear that she would fall on
them. One Fresh said that he heard some-
body talking when the ship passed, but upon
reflection, thought perhaps that it was him-
self hollering.

She came, she went and with very little
time attached thereto. Shorty Love, from
the heights of the water tower, asked for a
ride to Charlotte, but was turned down on
account of lack of room. Those who missed
the sight are awaiting the return trip of the
craft, which will be made over the same
route.

A Psychological
Test of Freshie
Makes New Mark

The annual Psychological test for the pres
cnt Freshman class was held about a week
ago, and many of the new boys are breath
ing casier, for the name of the test had many
of them frightened beyond measure,

The highest score made was 214 out of a
possible 220.) This was the highest score
that has ever been made at Davidson. This
is also the highest score that has been made
on a similar test in the United States, and
when a student at the University of Wash-
ington, at Seattle, made the same score, a
news item was made of the feat and publisi-
ed all over the country. The lowest
made by any man in the class was 53.

score

The median this year was 153, which is an
exceptionally good average. This indicates
that 50 per cent made a grade higher than
this, and 50 per cent made a grade lower
than 153. The normal median is 148, which
has been made by the three upper classes.
The high grade of the present Freshmen

‘class would indicate that the class as a whole

is somewhat better than the average Fresh-
man class.

One per cent of the class made 211 or bet-
ter, the upper 25 per cent made 178 or better,
aid the lower 25 per cent made 120 or lower.
The score of 153 shows that the present class
has more high score men in it than any other
class. The class is the largest that has becn
examined, 261 taking the The test
shows that the men around 17 years of age
make the highest those older
younger making less. * This would indicate
that 17 is the best age to enter college.

Davidson College boasts of an unprecedent

cluding in their membership only those who
have attained prominent success in one or
more lines of activity. The purpese of these
organizations “is to iuspire, mi -these whe

It is not remarkable to note that the men

who comprise the membership of these hon-

is not usual that a man who shifts neglect-

takes a new lease on life and makes such a
notable success in the activity or activities,
