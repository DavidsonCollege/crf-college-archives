Davidson falls to

Losses drop Wildcats to 0-6 —

By BRUCE NEWSOME

In the past two weeks, the Cats
lost to Wofford 32-15 and
Guilford 21-14. Both losses were
disappointments since at the be-
ginning of the year coach Vic
Gatto felt that his team -could
match up evenly with both teams.

Also, the Cats beat Wofford in
Spartanburg at the Terrier home-
coming last year 10-0, and the
Guilford Quakers came into the
game with just one victory this
season.

In the Wofford game, the Cats’
offense came out of its comatose
state that it had been in for the
previous two games. It erupted for
334 yards total offense.

However, once again turnovers
plagued the Cats. On the opening
drive, Peter Hughes. was stripped
of the ball at the Wofford 14. On
Davidson’s second possession,
Terry Hines fumbled at the Cats’
10-yard line and two plays later

the Terriers scored. Finally, mid-
way through the forth quarter with
Davidson down by 11. points,
Hughes’ pass was picked off and
the Terriers scored 5 plays later to
finish out the scoring 32-15.

After playing well in the two
previous games against Fordham
and Dartmouth, the Davidson
defense was unable to stop the
Wofford wishbone attack.

The Terrier quarterback killed
the Wildcats. He ran for 85 yards
and two touchdowns.

Most of these yards came off
the option play where he would
either outrun the Davidson out-
side linebackers and defensive
backs to the corner or cutback
against the grain and run like a
fullback through the secondary.

The specialty teams also con-
tinued their woes as kicker Brian
Jacob missed two field goals in
the first half that could have given
Davidson the lead.

as saying, “I was disgusted with
the way we played.”

In the Guilford game, Davidson

Guilford scored a touchdown in
the first quarter and two in the
second quarter to take a 21-0 lead
at the half. -

Davidson had one possible
scoring drive stopped by a fumble

fumble is a continuation of a dis-

Cross country team copes well with inexperience

By LEE CANIPE

“Our team is very young. The freshmen
have sort of been thrown into the fire,” says
senior Bob Cornish, captain of the men’s
cross country team. If Davidson’s program
has a single nemesis it could very well be
this inexperience.

Of the nine runners ongcoach Gary An-
drew’s men’s team, six are freshmen while
none of the five Wildcat women have had
any previous collegiate cross country expe-
rience. But, despite their lack of seasoning,
the Davidson runners have been able to
hold their own this year, earning respect-

able finishes while putting valuable experi-
ence under their belts.

At the North Carolina collegiate state
meet October 13, the men placed sixth out
of eight teams and the women were eighth
out of the nine squads that competed.

“It was the hardest meet we’ve run this
season, but the freshmen weren’t over-
whelmed by running against Carolina,
Duke, and teams like that. We held our
own.” says Cornish.

While the two second division finishes
were in themselves disappointing, Andrew
points out that the field last Thursday at

Wildcats return to
winning ways

By WHIT WILKS

After a few difficult weeks
which saw the team decimated by
injuries, Davidson’s soccer team
has played very well of late.
Davidson has won four of its last
five games in improving to 7-8-2,
heading into an important road
trip to Liberty and James Madison
this weekend.

Sunday the Cats faced Georgia

Long, and Ukrop were the goal
scorers for Davidson. This was
Ukrop’s 7th goal in the last four
games.

Davidson has done an impres-
sive job in dealing with an un-
usual amount of injuries this sea-
son. Players such as Tracy Hank-

ins and Bruce Nofsinger were

expected to play major roles but
have not been able to do so.

Coach Charlie Slagle has had to
go with younger, inexperienced
players who naturally have made
some mistakes.

UNC-Wilmington was “one of NCAA
championship caliber.” Joining the Wild-
cats at UNC-W were UNC-Chapel Hill,
N.C. State, Duke, Campbell, East Caro-
lina, St. Augustine, Methodist, and Bre-
vard.

A bright spot for Andrew was the fact
that out of the 14 Davidson men and
women that started the relatively flat
course at Wilmington, 12 of them came
back with personal best times. “I was very
pleased with the overall effort that we gave.
Some people improved their times by a
minute or even more.”

Leading the men’s team was freshman
Chris Otrok, who finished the 8K course in
27:10. Otrok has been at the head of the
pack-for Andrew in all five races so far this
year but has been closely followed by Ted
Richardson, Joe Parvis, Will Farr, Cornish,
and Jay Clugston.

“One of our strengths lately has been’
pack running,” says Andrew. Last Thurs-
day, the Davidson top five grouping was
just a little over a minute apart.

Beach, who began the season in the
top position for Davidson, has been
sidelined for the last three meets with a
stress fracture in her foot: Andrew
hopes to have her back before the next
meet at home on October 29.

Andrew notes the “potential for fu-
ture top performances” out of both
teams, glimpses of which he might
have seen at the West Georgia Invita-
tional on October 1. Against a field of
teams from comparably sized schools,
the Davidson men took second place
out of 12 and the women were fourth in
a race featuring eight teams.

Cornish singles out that meet as a
turning point of the season. “At the
West Georgia meet, the team got to-
gether as a team and started running

‘like a team,” he says.

Both teams have been steadily mak-
ing improvementas they gear up for the
home stretch. “We have been progtess-
ing the way we would like and hope to
’ finish strong at Furman,” says Andrew,
