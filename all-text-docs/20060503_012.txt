‘fi Day Without Seniors’ protests graduation

This Tuesday, the class of 2006
collectively planned to boycott all
academic and athletic activities in
what has been called “A Day
Without Seniors.” .

Seniors, upset over
the college’s policy
that they graduate
and move on to fur-
ther schooling or
some form of gainful
employment, turned
out in droves to
protest what many of
them feel is an unfair
dismissal of their
services.

Many of the sen-
iors, who feel that
their contributions to
the school are being
overlooked, ask for a
loosening of gradua-
tion restrictions. Most
demand, at the very
least, greater leniency
for moving out of
campus housing,
retention of old e-mail addresses
and a generally more accepting
attitude towards recent graduates
from current students and faculty.

Graduating SGA President Ryan
McPhee ’06 is credited with organ-
izing the protest.

McPhee was moved to action
upon learning that he and his fel-
low seniors will be forced to evacu-
ate student housing and barred
from registering for Fall 2006
courses following graduation.

“For four years, we have toiled
for this college in your classrooms,
on your sports fields and at low-
wage work-study jobs, only to be

Senior protesters gathered all over campus to voice their
anger over being forced to leave Davidson after graduation

discarded simply because we accu-
mulated too many credits,” said
McPhee. “Trust me, once you see
what it’s like when we're gone,
you'll be begging us to stay on
campus.”

Brody Smith ’06, president of
the Young Democrats and captain
of the club water polo team, agrees
with McPhee.

“We do the jobs that the under-
classmen are either unprepared or
unwilling to accept,” said Smith.

“We organize events and run many
of the organizations on campus;
this college would not be able to
function without our help.”

The protesters
gathered at various
locations around
campus, from the
Union to the sopho-
more apartments, up
the hill, down the
hill, and everywhere
in between.

Not surprisingly,
Martin Court turned
out the highest num-
ber of senior protest-
ers.

Over 300 mem-
bers of the class of
2006 turned out for
the event, holding up
signs that read, “We
fill up your upper -
level courses” and
“We keep Career
Services employed.”

Dean of Student
Life Tom Rogers was pleased with
how peacefully most of the seniors
demonstrated.

“This was not an out-of-control
mob,” said Dean Rogers. “This was
simply a group of seniors who
want to keep basic student rights,
like an e-mail address and free
laundry service.”

Not every almost-graduate
agrees with the demands of their
classmates. Amanda Putterton ’06
thinks that if her fellow seniors

want to continue to stay on cam-
pus, then they should do it the
legal way.

“There are plenty of jobs as
Davidson fellows in various
departments still available to
young alumni,” said Putterton. “If
these kids want to stick around on
campus, they should pull their own
weight and get jobs like the rest of
us.

Seniors make up approximately
25 percent of the student body,
and the intensity of the debates
may continue to escalate as gradu-
ation nears.

McPhee said that he is not
opposed to additional protests, if
necessary, and is encouraged by
the success of the first-event.

“Trust me, once
you see what it’s
like when we’re

gone, you'll be beg-
ging us to stay on
campus.”

“This is not just for our benefit,
but the future seniors that will
come after us,” said McPhee. “This
college has a history of discrimina-
tion towards recent graduates, and
intend to stop this mistreatment as
soon as possible.”

Yowl|-bituaries: Remembering a hatmaker

Last December, The Yow! interviewed Davidson hatmaker Vladimir Radovitchsky for our Townies article, which highlights local personalities. Mr.
Radovitchsky tragically passed away last week after he was attacked by a legion of squirrels that he was hunting to make his hats.

Mr. Vladimir Ruskie
Radovitchsky was a_ simple
Russian hatmaker trying to find a
better life for himself in America.

He opened a hat store in down-
town Davidson called “Hats, Hats,
Hats.”

His favorite thing about America
was the clothing; he was particu-
larly fond of jeans and sweaters.

Radovitchsky had only three
loves in life: hats, vodka, and hats.
He used to make his hats out of the
fur from squirrels that he would
hunt around the Davidson College
campus.

Radovitchsky’s hats came in two
sizes: Hat Ears Up and Hat Ears
Down.

Mr. Radovitchsky is survived by

a wife, Mrs. Svetlana
Radovitchsky, and a son, Mr. Ivan
Radovitchsky.

Both live in Russia, but Ivan
plans to move to Davidson with his
mother so that he can continue the
business that his father started
over three years ago.

“From what I understand so
much, my father’s business it was-
n’t much of a success,” said Ivan

Radovitchsky. “He would make the
hats, but no one would buy them
because of poor marketing. You
see, my father’s idea of marketing
was to drink eight or nine shots of
vodka before noon and swear at
passersby until the police would
chase him away.”

Ivan plans to expand the hat-
making business to
one that includes

the making of socks,
underwear and
toothbrushes.

In keeping with
his father’s tradi-
tion, all of his prod-
ucts will continue to
be manufactured of
only squirrel fur.

“To .make my
products from any-
thing but squirrel
fur would be a dis-
service to my
father,” said the liv-
ing Radovitchsky.
“He always said that
he felt his relation-
ship with the, squir-
rels was one of give

and take. He used to say, ‘The
squirrels giveth, and the squirrels
taketh away.’ He was very wise.”

Mrs. Radovitchsky says that she
looks forward to seeing the area
where Vladimir lived and worked
for close to four years.

She said no matter how slow
business was, Vladimir would

always send home as much vodka
and squirrel hats as he possibly
could afford.

“Vladimir was a good man,” said
Mrs. Radovitchsky. “My son may
forgive the squirrels for what they
did to my husband, but I cannot
forgive. Those squirrels are dead to
