Quips and Cranks Dope

Everyone will be glad to learn that
the 1919 volume of “Quips atid Cranks”
thas been practically completed and has
gone to. press, Nevertheless ‘Amo™
wishes to announce, also to urge. that if
there is anyone who has any contribu-
tions. to hand them in as soon as possi-
ble.

At a recent meeting of the student
hody it was moved and adopted that the
Magazine money should be equally di-
vided between the Annual and The Da-
tidsonian, ‘The Mapazine will not be
published on account of the lack — of
proper material.

In the issue of February 26, a letter
trom Mr. Jackson appeared in which he
stated that the government refuses to
pay last fall's blanket fee. on the ground
that it included student publications
which were not necessary,

This will make the Annual and The
Davidsonian a little short on money.
However, they intend to collect the
deficit from the student body. It is only
reasonable that the S, A. T. C. students
who received their paper free last fall
should pay their share of the blanket fee.

1919 Baseball Schedule
Announced In Part

A Northern Trip Pending. Squad
Rounding Into Shape.

Despite the inclement weather during
the past week, baseball practice his not
been lacking except on one or two days
when it was impossible to use either the
infield or outfield. Prospects are be-
coming brighter each week for even a
more successful year than the previous
one, and from a report given out — by
Manager Cunningham it is evident that
the full schedule will be submitted with-
in the next two weeks.

Clark and Currie, of the last year’s
pitcher's staff. are in fine shape and the
new material is shoaving rapid progress.
The infield practice during the week was
marked with lots of snap and accuracy
in handling the “pill.” Every advant-
age is heing given to the men to improve
in using the “stick” also, and the scrubs
are making it difficult for the old men to
score a great number of hits. A num-
ber of new men are doing good work in
the field and are going to give the old
squad some stiff practice, if the interest
doesn't wane.

Now that a new class schedule has
been arranged. putting the military drill
in the forenoon, more time can be de-
voted to practice and before many weeks
Davidson will be able to meet her first
engagements with brightest hopes.

The short stories of Edgar Allen Poe
were discussed at the last meeting of the
Sigma Upsilon Fraternity on last Wed-
nesday night. J. J. Love was in charge
of the program, which proved to. be very
interesting. At the close of the meeting.
light refreshments were served. W. G.
Humphrey, '18, was reinstated at this
meeting, L. M. Thomas, '18. was a
visitor. On next Wednesday night.
Hawthorne’s works will be studied for
a short time.

The Junior Oratorical Exercises. be-
ginning Friday evening and closing Sat-
urday night proved a very successtul oc-
casion. ‘The orations were uniformrly
good and many ef them were of high or-
der. All were delivered well and show-

ed careful preparation.—For a time it
seemed that the -«fcient tradition of
Junior Speaking lore would topple from
its pedestal; but at the last moment
Jupiter Plavius awoke, probably aroused
by the eloquent outbursts of vocal ad-
juration of the great and near-great ora-
tors, but he was unable to cast any no-
ticeable damper on the festivities.

Whew the first subject was annanneced
as Bolshevism the audience began to be
a little uneasy but their fears quickly
subsided when the speaker showed that
he was master of the situation, Gas in
Modern Warfare closely followed. this,
and it was then that the visitors began
to quake, having neglected to bring along
and gas masks. ‘Phe far-seeing faculty,
however, had anticipated this need and
had thoughtfully installed a splendid
new system of ventilators which prevent-
ed any evil effects. “The effectiveness of
these ventilators and their currents of
pure, fresh air apparently inspired an-
other speaker to wax eloquent on ‘The
Selective Draft.

‘Khe Triumph of Democracy Over
Autocracy was assured when General
Pershing was brought to the front. An-
other speaker had for a subject My
Twenty Years in Davidson. and when
he took us over those 20 years in some
four minutes, we realized that Time.

esied,

While one speaker tried to inculcate
into our minds the evils of the Almighty
Dollar, another stoutly defended and -ad
vocated the value of The Pennies.

‘The Freedom of the Seas was pre-

sented in such a forceful and compelling:

way that one of the speakers was tempt-
ed to Launch Out Into the Deep—with
out any serious results, however,

But the speaker who best: expressed
the teelings of the Juniors had for his
subject “Vhe Crisis, which, thanks to the
presence of the Ideal Physician, was
finally safely passed. .

Glee Club Concert,

On last Saturday night the Glee Club
rendered the first program of the season.
The splendid program piven) surpassed

Chorus, after which’ a character sketch
was given by Shields. ‘Vhe program was
closed by “O! Susie Behave” by the en
tire Club.

As space does not permit enumeration

dividual praise let it suffice to say that
the features of the evening were the solo

by Love in the song “El Sav She Does.”

Tennis Given Impetus

By “D” Being ‘Awarded

Tournament to Begin March 24th. In-
teresting Contests Expected.

A question long debated at Davidson
was decided at a recent: meeting of the
Athletic Association whea it was finally
agreed upon that the coveted “D" would
hereafter be awarded in tennis, “This
custom -has been in vogue for several
sears at the larger colleges with a high
degree of success, and the decision of the
Athletic Association to do likewise will
he favorably received by all,

It has not yet been decided as to what
kind of letter will be given, but in all
probability this will be a five inch block

There will be only one letter awarded
this year, this going tu the champion in
singles. but the chances are that letters
will also be given in doubles later on.

Now that the skill and efforts. of the
tennis players is to be rewarded in a suit-
able manner, interest in this yzame should
he greatly increased. R. B. Cunningham,
manager of tennis, when interviewed last
week, stated that the tennis tournament
would be held beginning March 24. He
desires all players wishing to enter this
tournament to hand in their oames be-
fore the 22nd, accompanied by a 50-cent
entrance fee for singles and a 25-cent fee
each for doubles. “The money obtained
in this way will be used in getting other
college teams on the Hill if possible. He
also stated that the balls would be fur-
nished by the individual players.

He is making every effort to insure
the success of this tournament, and with
the co-operation of the students there
should be many close contests.

“Why, no.”
