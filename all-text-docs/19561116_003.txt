PH! DELTS UNAPPROACHED RUNNER-UPS

On the strength of three first
place champions and five runner-

Few varsity contests, much less any other of the inter-
fraternity sports, could match the excitement, shouting, and
commotion that was predominate at the interfraternity
wrestling matches on Tuesday and Wednesday of this week.

There was little doubt as to who the crowd's favorite
was on the first night. Avid anticipation spread through the
stands as the time for the heavyweight bouts drew near.

Suddenly into the excited gymnasium stepped the
Masked Avenger who dispersed all questions of *'s ath-
letic prowess when he removed the immaculate robe
and revealed his physique. There was none—no ability,
no physique.

To the fans’ great surprise and delight (and just maybe
because of the sympathy of the bemused opponent) the
Avenger lasted through the first round. The rest period was
long enough for the lad to take a drag from a cigar and sip
from a questionable bottle.

On the more serious side of the tournament, one very
dangerous practice was permitted by the referees

throughout both nights.

Many boys, wrestling without experience and ignorant

of the araateur rules, consistently attempted to lift their op-

ponents and slam them to the mat. Collegiate wrestling rules}
ban a man who does not have at least one knee on the mat}

from lifting and throwing his foe.

When falling after this illegal maneuver the thrown
man usually lands on his head, neck or shoulders. The
danger of such an impact to the vertebrae or head is
obvious. It was this type of throw that knocked one
wrestler unconscious Tuesday night.

The fault lies primarily in the large number of con-
testants who are unaware of many rules making their strict
enforcement impossible. However with a practice as po-
tentially a crippler as this procedure, participants in the
future should be made aware of the rule and should be
penalized for its violation.

ups, the Kappa Sigs grappled their
way to the interfraternity wrest-
ling championship.

Although the second place Phi
Delts also had three men to take
first places, they only produced
one second place winner.

Led by Tom Ridenhour, the Phi
Gams grabbed third place. After
almost four minutes of even wrest-
ling with Brown Hamer, Riden-
hour finally pinned him for the
heavyweight championship.

Flickerball All-Star

The 1956 All-Campus flickerball squad was announced
this week by Coach Heath Whittle, director of intramural
sports. The selection was made by the starting seven men of
each team which participated in the action. this season.

In particular for his outstanding
soccer play against Washington
and Lee last week and for his
contributions throughout the year,
Ross Smyth has earned the athletic
honors of the week.

Smyth has been the starting
center forward in every match this
season, and his spirit and aggres-
siveness have been a binding force
among the team members. After
a disabling injury to Captain Dan-
ny Crates in the Duke match, Ross
was elected acting Captain for
the remainder of the season.

In scoring one of Davidson's
two goals last week against W&L,
Smyth put on an exhibition of
persistence and aggressiveness.
Having his shots blocked twice,
he continued to drive in with the
ball until he finally broke through
the defensive fullback and made
his attempt good. This almost
singlehanded scoring effort was
regarded as one of the outstand-
ing plays of the match.

Last year Ross along with sev-
eral other upperclassmen spent a

| great deal of time helping fresh-

men organize a soccer team, some-
thing new in Davidson athletics,
the forerunner of the year’s var-

Quips and Cranks, and a member
of the Beaver Club. He maintains

sity unit.
In addition to his work with

soccer, Ross is active in other|a high scholastic average as a

Davidson’s red-and-black

cross country men repeated

their performance of last year with a third place in the North
Carolina State Meet at Raleigh Monday.

Angus McBryde once more ran
an outstanding race, finishing 6th
against strong opposition.

UNC and Jim Beatty entirely
swept the day, Beatty by running
a new course record time and beat-
ing State’s Shea by a whole min-
ute, and the UNC squad by cap-
turing Ist, 3rd, 5th, 9th and 10th
for a low score of 28 points.

STATE SECOND

State, taking second, ended up
with a total of 71. Davidson just
barely beat Wake Forest, 87 to 88,
while Duke finished last and fifth

with 95 points

McBryde's time on the fast four-|
mile course was 22:15, compared to|
Beatty’s record breaking 20:06.5.'
Among the rest of the Davidson |
runners Al Elder captured 14th
place, with Henry Brown in the
number 20 spot. Ray Antley (21st) |
and Graham George (26th) round-}
ed out the scoring Davidson five. |

SOUTHERN CONFERENCE NEXT

A nine-man squad will travel
to Lexington, Va., for the South-
ern Conference meet Monday 19th.
With Pete Asheraft, the injured

Cat captain, out of the picture, it

is up to McBryde to defend the
Wildcat traditions. He could place
among the top 3. As for the team
chances, third place behind Wil-
liam and Mary and VMI should
be within reach.

Warren Wilson, 2-0

A greatly improved Davidson
soccer team, scoring once in each
of the first two quarters, won its
first: match of the season last Sat-
urday by defeating Warren Wil-
, son College on the local field.

Early in the first quarter

Gordon Neville climaxed a

Wildcat offensive drive by

drilling home Davidson's first

score.

In the second quarter with Da-

vidson still controlling most of
|the play, Ross Smythe fought
through the defense and drove

the ball past the out-stretched fin-
gers of the Warren Wilson goalie
