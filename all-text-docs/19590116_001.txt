If so, the move may be made at the next meeting
of the Athletic Council on January 19.

SHORTENED PERIOD

Kuykendall Foresees

Few Election Changes

By ED ARMFIELD

Davidsonian Managing Editor

“I foresee minor changes of a mechanical nature/and was president of the pub-| Presbyterian Hospital in Char-
rather than radical ones in our election system,” Stu-|lications board. He is a mem-
dent Body President John Kuykendall told the DAVID-
SONIAN in an interview Wednesday morning. “I can
also predict that students will have more opportunity to
meet the candidates and become more familiar with the

issues.

“We hope that our present
system of forums can be ex-
panded. There has been the
suggestion that we have forums
in chapel right after the vari-
ous candidates present their
speeches; in this way the Stu-
dent Body would already be to-
gether. We think that if the
students know more about the
candidates, their past records
and the issues, there will be
better turnouts for voting.”

Some of the other questions
asked by members of the staff
along with the answers by
Kuykendall appear below:

Question: When will this
year’s elections start?

Answer: “They will begin
about three weeks after the be-
ginning of second semester, at
least the nominations will start

then. That means that between
now and then we will have to
bring before the Student Body
any changes we want to make.”

Question: What would
some of these changes be?

Answer: “One of the big
weaknesses of our present sys:
tem is that the elections string
out over a period of many
weeks. We will propose a com-,
bination of elections that will;
not conflict.

“Another improvement could
be made through closer screen-
ing of members of the Elections
Committee. I plan to personally;
contact the fraternity presi-
dents this week to find out
just who has an active interest

in student government affairs. .-

Ecoforum Sef For
Second Semester

Beginning second semes-
ter there is to be a non-
credit seminar in con-
temporary economic’ devel-
opments and. problems,
which will meet for one
hour each week. The Eco-

forum should be of particu- :

lar interest to those stu-
dents majoring in econom-
ics or business administra-
tion.

This seminar will give the
student a better knowledge of
these developments and will al-
so give him a means by which
much of his theoretical learn-,

ing in economics can be ap- 4

plied to particular situations.
The Ecoforum, which will be
held Thursday from 4 to 5
o’clock in the faculty lounge.
of the College Union, will be
of the round-table discussion
type with faculty members of
the Departments of Economics
and Business Administration
participating. The first session
will be on the first Thursday
of the second semester, Feb-
ruary 5th. All interested stu-
dents are invited to attend.

walter discuss tentative plans for the new dormitory scheduled for initial construction in

1959.

NEW DORMITORY

Mrs. Moore Expresses
Satisfaction With Plans

After taking a look at the preliminary sketch for the proposed new dormitory,
John Trask, 1958 graduate of| Mrs. J. B. Moore, supervisor of dormitories stated, “The architects apparently have

the prospect of a much needed dorm.”

This preliminary sketch was
received by the college recent-
ly from the firm of Lashmit,

Prof. Thompson
Has Operation

Professor Bradley D. Thomp-
son underwent a major opera-
tion last Friday, January 9, at

lotte. According to Dean John-
ston, he is resting comfortably
and is expected to return to
convalesence at home in a week
or ten days. He will not be able
to return to his history classes
any earlier than a month or
six weeks from now.

Dr. Thompson first entered
Presbyterian on December 31.
Since classes resumed after the
holidays, his work has been di-
vided among the members of
the History Depertment, with
Dr. Johnston taking History 31,
11B, and the Honors students;
and Dr.
Marrotte History 111.

Members of the History De-
partment will administer and
gtade examinations of all class-

: es; semester grades will be de-
_ termined by the department,
* considering

scores on the
examination and previous tests
given by Professor Thompson.

Arrangements for second
semester will be made at a la:
ter date. No arrangements have
yet been made for the forei;,’n
students to whom he is faculty
advisor.

James, Brown, and Pollock of
Winston-Salem, architects for
the job. The plans have been
circulated among the admini-
stration and will go before the
Faculty Building and Grounds
Committee shortly for approval
by them.

Very few changes are expect-
ed unless the cost of building
exceeds expectations. Estimat-
ed cost is in the neighborhood
of $375,000.

BEHIND BELK

The red brick structure is
expected to be behind Belk
Dormitory and face in a north-
west direction on the road lead-
ing to the new fraternity court.
This position will allow most
of the trees in the block to re-
main.

The new dormitory as pro-
posed now will have a total of
four floors plus a basement.
There will be sixteen rooms on
each floor with the exception
of the first which will have on-
ly fourteen. This is due to a
large lounge proposed for this
floor at the front entrance.

The basement at present will
house no students, but can be
easily converted for such if the
,need arises. There will be two
students to each room, making
.a total of 124 capacity.

! On each floor there will be
|two rest rooms with toilets and
j showers, one at each end of
the floor. There will also be a
luggage room at each end and

we had hoped and asked for. I am highly pleased with

at least one telephone booth
per floor.
LARGER ROOMS

As seen now each’ room will
have a lavatory with tiled re-
eess and a medicine cabinet
with mirror aboye.
this on the other side of the
room will be a dirty clothes
bin with a shelf above for a
record ployer or radio. The pro-
posed rooms will be approxi-
mately four feet longer and
somewhat wider than those in
Belk Dormitory.

Besides these single features, '

there will be a cabinet type
wardrobe which will include a
clothes closet with sliding
doors, four clothes drawers
with a storage bin above, and

also another bin near the ceil-'

ing. The door to the lower stor-
age bin will probably have a
large mirror on it. Also on each

side there will be a bed run-'

ning lengthwise with a lamp
and large bulletin board above.
There will be an eight inch
deep shelf above the bulletin
board and the bed can be dou-
bled as a lounge in the day
time. Completing each side of
the room will be a semi-private,
built in desk with lamp, cork
paneling, and shelves above.
Plans are that the new dormi-

tory will be started by late Rue

spring of this year. Bids will
be let as soon as definite plans
can be drawn. The new build-
ing should be ready for occu-
pancy at the beginning of the
1960 school term.

The Billy May Orchestra, featuring Frankie Lester,
and the Four Freshmen vocal group will provide the

The double attraction, unique
this year, was made possible by
a special contract providing for
such a “package deal.” IFC
President Vernon Anderson, in
releasing the announcement
this week, said that “if the
dances and concert don't ap-
peal to the Davidson students
this Midwinters, I just don’t
know what we could possibly
give them.”

The Billy May Orchestra Is
composed of some eighteen
pieces and the vocalist-lead-
er Frankie Lester. May him-
self is under contract with
the Milton Berle show and
does not travel with his band,
but it plays his arrangements,
and the music itself will be
of exactly the quality heard
in the Billy Mey atbums.

The vocalist of the band
Frankie Lester, is considered
by some to be a main attraction
of the band. His singing style
is very close to that of Frank
Sinatra, whose place, in fact,

Lester took with the Tommy
Dorsey band. He has sung with
such groups as Hal McIntyre
and Buddy Morrow.

The Four Freshmen, a
familiar group to everyone, will
sing the concert Saturday after-
noon, and will make appear-
ances at the Saturday night
dance. Their popular songs in-
clude “Day by Day,” “Char- .
maine,” “Stormy Weather,” and
“Julie Is Her Name.”

Their method of presente
tion is e unique one, in that
they provide their own in
strumental accompaniment.
Collectively, the Freshmen
play trombone, bass, guitar,
drums, end trumpet.

They have won the “Best Vo-
cal Group” category in the
Metronome Magazine poll the
last three years, and the Down-
beat poll the last four years.

lucky to get such a good deal.
I just hope that it will be as
big a success as I think it will.”
