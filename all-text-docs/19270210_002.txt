with the future generals holding the

The inauguration of boxing at Davidson
a sport prohibited with other colleges,
is a great step forward. Although this
the men who turn out enjoy slugging
each other. Last year several exhibition
matches were held among the members
of the team and were enjoyed by the

students. There are several men in

school who would make a_ creditable been working out daily under the direc- ===

showing against other college teams if
this was permitted. Too much
cannot be given Captain Elkins for the
interest and time he is giving this sport,
for it is through his efforts that the in-
terest in boxing does not die.

Much good material has been turning
out for spring practice and prospects are
good for next year’s team. John Mel-
ton who was a star lineman year before
last is back, and looks good for next fall.
Coach Tex is making good use of those |
freshmen’ who made up the first-year |
team. A number of them are being used, |
and will undoubtedly find a place on the
squad. -Several men have been injured
slightly in the scrimmages but are almost
over their knocks and bruises and are
getting in trim once more.

Word has come to our ears that the |
tennis team is negotiating with several
teams in the North for matches on their
spring trip. Victories over Colgate, the
University of Pittsburgh, and others
would sound mighty good to Davidson-
ians and with the abundant supply of
good material such is not improbable.
This schedule is not complete nor are
any contracts signed as yet, but. when
all these colleges are fishing for engage-
ments with Davidsonian, some will cer-
tainly be closed. : Captain McCutchen,

“At present there are no definite

; arrangements and plans that have been|

ling on the progress of the team and the
Hieneat shown by the student body.”

Due to faculty ruling there will be no

there should at least be twenty or more
men out.

As the sport grows and the interest
reaches the proper height the faculty will
give permission for matches with other

team and Captain Elkins urges all men

Both Carolina and State have good box-
ing teams and it is only natural that the
sport should grow at Davidson. They
would furnish opposition for the team and
provide an amusement not formerly
found here at Davidson. | Nearly every
sport recognized in the southern college
world is represented by a team at .Da-
vidson and there is no reason why the
sport should not grow and flouish here.
