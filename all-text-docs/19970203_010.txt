RIS & LIVING

MONDAY, FEBRUARY 3, 1997

Last week, the phrase “‘sold
out” slowly became the core of my
frustration as it was passed around
in various and sundry forms refer-
ring to one thing only: Star Wars.
The hot spot of the week was Caro-
lina Pavilion 22, an airport-sized

movie theater that boasted THX
sound, stadium seating, and tickets
in advance if you had a credit card
— but who doesn’t? Consequently,
several Davidson students were
spotted strutting around with the
confidence. of knowing they had
tickets to one of the most coveted
movie experiences since the film’s
initial release.

Those slow on the draw were
content in the knowledge that Mov-
ies at the Lake wasn’t selling tickets
until Friday, though the fear of miss-
ing another chance proved too much

’ forsome. Doug Meislahn arrived at

the box office at 9 0’ clock on Friday
morning, remained the only person
in line for about three and a half
hours, and didn’t touch his tickets
for another two. But he took his
responsibility seriously, and though
the ticket vendor raised his eye-
brows when Doug asked for 27
student tickets, presenting one ID
as proof, the Force must have been
on his side.

The movie itself seemed to
meet everyone’s demands. If Ju-
rassic Park made you believe ge-
netic science actually could clone
dinosaurs, the Star Wars Special
Edition will definitely amaze you.
Simply seeing the movie in the the-
aters was enough for me. My eyes

* darted from one corner of the screen
to the other as they tried to take in
the complete glory of 35mm film,
most of which is lost in the video
translation. The revamped sound
also made a distinct impact. Every
time the Millennium Falcon shot
past the camera or an Imperial Star
Destroyer drifted by, the audience
felt the movement in addition to
hearing it. The theater experience
was nothing short of amazing, and
considering that a large part of our
generation never got to see it on the
big screen, the excitement was in-
herently doubled.

Around four and a half minutes
were added to the original stock,

ficiuding the famed Jabba scene
and a short interchange between
Luke and his friend Biggs. Though
everyone I’ve talked to loved the
additions, I still can’t be entirely
impressed with all of them. I wor-
ship Star Wars as much as the next
guy (probably more), but most of
the added special effects glowed as
digital technology is wont to do —
not helped by the fact that Tatooine
offers a very drab backdrop to 90s
computer generated graphics. Also,
the human body exhibits’ move-
ments so complex that it should
come as no surprise that not even
the most advanced computers can
duplicate them with much authen-
ticity. The Special Edition tried.
One place that I thought the
new effects worked perfectly was

the space battles. The quick action, ,

heightened explosions, and brisk
editing made them all the more ex-
citing. Maybe it’s a question of

Peklo fights fire with dedication

Art has limitless vectors of ex-
pression. This week’s interview
focuses on a more practical artist.
Senior Josh Peklo was recently the
first Davidson student to be ap-

pointed Captain of the Davidson

Volunteer Fire Department. Not
only is Josh the first student to be
appointed to a leadership role, but

he is also the youngest captain ever
in the town’s history.

Josh, how did you get interested in
fire fighting?

I grew upinasmall town, West
Friendship, Maryland, and my fam-
ily always had involvement with
the local fire department as far as
going to the fund-raisers and open
house events. We also had to callin
their services once or twice. When
I was at one of the open house

events, I found out that once I turned
16 I could become a volunteer, and
this was something that I had al-
ways been interested in. I can re-
member the siren going off while I
was in school, and I can remember
thinking that people who were vol-
unteers were going to take care of
whatever the emergency was. So,
I thought I would try it out as an
activity and got involved with it.
What was it like. when you first
became a full fledged volunteer?
First I had to take a training
class, 120 hours. It met a couple
times a week and took about six
months. So, after I took that, I was
actually allowed to go on calls. At
first, it was acombination of excite-
ment and fear. It was a little bit
scary at first knowing that you are
16 years old, you have this training,
and you know how to doit. Ifyou
are one of the first to arrive, whether
it’s a minor call or a big fire, then
whomever called you expects you
to know what to do. There was
certainly excitement, but obligation
to the community is a serious fac-

tor, and you always want to make
sure you do a good job. As the
excitement fades, you really begin
to trust your training and the appre-
hension begins to go away. They
tell you in training that when you
drive up to a burning building, most
people are running out of the build-
ing, but you are going in—try not to
think that you are crazy. It was a
good training program. It taught
you faith in your equipment and
inspired confidence towards the
people you worked with. The older
members really help you feel more
secure.
How did you get involved with the
Davidson Fire Department?
When I was looking at col-
leges, one of the things I always
looked for was whether or not it had
avolunteer fire department. I wasn’t
going to let that be a deciding factor
in where I went, but it definitely
helped. When I came to Davidson
as a freshman, I stopped by the fire
department and talked to the chief
and got an application and joined
the department. I’ve been doing it

organic versus inorganic subjects.
To me, the computer generated ani-
mals and people didn’t look nearly
as convincing as the angular planes
of the starships as they rocketed ©
past grand space-scapes.

With the re-release of the Star
Wars Trilogy, who can help but
wonder at what’s on George Lucas’s
horizon? Reports say that the
storyline for the Prequils is finished,
the first script written, and that film-
ing begins this fall.

With his new ideas about film-
making, Lucas is apparently set to
revolutionize the industry (again)
using blue screens as backdropsand .
creating digital sets after the fact.
Industrial Light and Magic, doubt-
less, will establish another step to-
ward intensely real special effects
and THX sound can do nothing but
meet the challenge with their own
bag of tricks. What more need be
said?

my four years here.
How does it feel to be the first
Davidson student to be appointed
an officer of the Davidson Fire De-
partment?
Iconsiderit a tremendous honor
that I was chosen. I’ve learned a lot
here in Davidson, but I guess my
training back in Maryland really
prepared me fora leadership role. It
was a real surprise when the chief
first came to me since there has
never been a student officer.

. What is your favorite kind of emer-

gency call?

My favorite kind of call is the
stereotypical cat-stuck-in-a-tree
call. We actually do get those from
time to time, and it really is a lot of
fun because there is not a lot of
pressure. When you do go up and
get the cat out of the tree, it really
pleases whomever the cat belongs
to. I’ve been involved in a couple
cat rescues. It was something that I
thought was a myth when I joined
the department, but people do call.
