2001:

2001: A Space Odyssey. Produc-
ed and directed by Stanley Kub-
rick. Screenplay by Stanley Kub-
rick and Arthur C. Clarke. Based
on the novel by Arthur C. Clarke.
Cinematography by Geoffrey Un-
sworth and John Alcott. Starring
Kier Dullea, William Sylvester,
and Gary Lockwood.

To describe Stanley Kubrick's
2001: A Space Odyssey as any-
thing other than a masterpiece is to
do it a grave injustice. It is per-
meated by genius on all levels and
is one of the best films of the last
twenty years.

Perhaps the most unusual
thing about 2001 — considering
it was made in the 1960s — is that
it is essentially a silent film. There

is, of course, dialogue, but not
much. Kubrick resorts to speaking
parts only when there is an impor-
tant piece of plot information that
is best communicated verbally.
This lack of dialogue is, for those
of us used to dialogue-based
films, strange. However, it gives

emotional rapport with the charac-
ters in the film. All the actors de-
liver their lines, few as they may
be, bluntly, but with no emotion.
Thus, the viewer is in no way

silence give the viewer a better
feeling for the vacuum of space.

The average director tells his
actors something like this: “Do
your best to understand your char-
acter so that you can properly ex-
press his emotional condition.” In
2001, Kubrick has done the oppo-

any real emotions at all. Con-

rule,-and the reason why such un-

twenty years, become famous —
or perhaps infamous, depending
on your perspective. All attempts
to describe it must fail because it
demands to be experienced visual-
ly, not verbally. One thing that it
is important to watch for is the ex-
pression on David Bowman’ face
as he arrives in the rather bizarre
room in which the movie ends.
With his head bent down and his
eyes peering upward, he wears the
same expression as all of Kub-
rick’s madmen: Malcolm

Orange, Jack Nicholson in The
Shining, and, more recently, Geo-

ket. This is Kubrick’s standard de-
vice for expressing insanity.

Kubrick’s masterpiece builds a powerful image

On a purely technical level,
the film is a marvel. Remember,
while you are watching it, that
2001 was made ten years before
the special effects bonanza that
began with Star_Wars. Also re-
member thaf it was released just
one year before the first man
landed on the moon. The-
cinematography by George Un-
sworth and John Alcott is excel-
lent throughout the film. With the
death of Alcott last year the film
world lost a consummate artist.

Ultimately you will each make
your own decision as to the theme
of the film, but remember that

Afro-American festival
celebrates unity and freedom

By MUADI MUKENGE

Frantic drum beats echoed

throughout the campus Friday
evening as a dancer’s arms undu-
lated rhythmically, her shadow
exaggerated to gigantic propor-
tions against the Union wall. The
essence of her dance was brought
to attention as she shouted
“ahuru,” which means “freedom”
in Yoruba (a Nigerian language).

Freedom of expression was
the essence of Umogha — an
Afro-American cultural festival,
held Sept. 18 on the Union patio.
“Umogha” means “unity” in
Swahili. For three hours, profes-
sional artists shared their interpre-
tation of the African and Afro-
American experience through
music, song, dance and poetry to
the appreciative crowd of about
250 persons.

“It was fantastic,” exclaimed
Brenda Tapia, ‘assistant chaplain

It was a dynamite combination
which thrilled and more impor-
tantly, educated, the audience

Culture Bearers and the steel

Davidson campus. Both. were

Festival; the Culture Bearers will .
return Oct. 3.

The evening began with the
Culture Bearers, which is mainly
comprised of family members.
Two women, sisters Hadasha and
Noni, began by singing a series of
chants in Yoruba — a chant to the
ancestors, asking for blessings on
the gathering and a chant to the
father deity, Obayala. The women
accompanied themselves on small
wooden hand pianos from Ghana
called Twangas.

Noni then danced to

The Afro-American festival
was the result of an idea which had
long been forming in the minds of
Miller and Tapia. Tapia’s initial
plan had been to hold a large-scale
festival actively involving the stu-

space was made available on the

calendar for mid-Sept., stated

Miller, they decided in the interest
of time to hold a minifestival now

ized those of the sea — at first .
slow and languid before changing
to a fast, pulsating rhythm.

Next on the program was
Olympic High School student
Rafael Candalerio, M1. The young
poet recited several of his original
works which cynically and blat-
antly stated thoughts on love (or
the lack of it), suicide, hell, and
peace (or the lack of it).

Music returned to the stage as
jazz flutist Michael Porter per-
formed on a standard C-flute, a
bamboo flute, and the piano. The
36-year-old musician effectively
combined music and history as he
talked about the origin and de-
velopment of Afro-American
‘music, then played a selection for—
each example.

As the festival came toa close,

I thought to myself what a great
and worthwhile program the festi-
val turned out to be. I am an- |
ticipating the campus/community
festival planned for spring.
