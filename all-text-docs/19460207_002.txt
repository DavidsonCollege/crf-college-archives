and is a medium of student and facutly opinion...

As such it welcomes contributions or com:
munication to it, provided such does not contain

Read not to contradict and confute, nor to believe
and take for. granted, nor to find talk and dis-
course; but to weigh and consider.

and we commend you for the willingness
of which you went about it. Further, we
wish to express a welcome to the new in-
structors, who are beginning their work
with us for the first time.

There are at present approximately 455
students enrolled at Davidson, of which
number 175 are new students. It is signi-
ficant to note that ninety per cetn of the
new enrollees are returned veterans, and
seventy-five per cent of those were for-
merly Davidson students. Approximately
twenty are now married men, and We ex-
tend a very special welcome to their wives.

At this point we stop to pay high tri-
bute to the 142 former Davidson students
who lost their. lives in World War II.
Forty-seven of this number entered the
service directly from the classroom, and
were they alive today, would in all pro-
bability be among us today. It is through
the giving up of their lives that we are able
to be in school today, and to live in a free
and democratic country. In their names,
and tor their sakes, we must again re-
establish and achieve our high purpose.

And so we find ourselves at the begin-
ning of a new semester, which can be, will
be, and must be, a very prosporous and
yet a very extraordinary semester.

A New &ra...

The beginning of a new semester reveals
a new era in the lite of Davidson College.
Never ,before in the history of the college
has, in one sense of the word, such an
extraordinary semester opened.

Davidson College is definitely on the up-
ward trend, for with the return of such
a large number of students, our enrollment
has greatly increased. To the group of
veterans who have just recently returned
to college or who have enterd for their
first time, we extend a hearty welcome,
hoping that you may find your work here a
happy and prosperous one.

During the past several years the David-
son College student body has greatly di-
minished. Naturally there have arisen
many problems and headaches, which at
times we thought could never be solved.
Of that small number of students a vast
majority were underclassmen, who knew
nothing of the ideals and principals upon
which Davidson was founded, and of the
many valued traditions of which-are so
closely associated with Davidson.

There have been only a handful of up-
per-classnen at Davidson. during the fast
few years, and it has been a difficult job
for them to keep alive the many intangable
things which have made Davidson what it
is. Their efforts have not been wasted even
though at times it appeared as if the “ole
Davidson spirit” had been lost. Once again
however, we see our college gradually re-
turning to its former patterns of life, about
which we are all very pleased.

We welcome the veterans who have re-
turned to Davidson, for, in them, we see a
new determination to carry on and make
Davidson what it used to be. Through you,
there will return again those many valued
traditions; there will arise a new Davidson
spirit shaped after the pattern of the old,
and we’ must join together in again re-af-
firming our ideals and pursuing our high
purpose. It will be a difficult and tedious
job, but it is our desire and determination to
carry on to the finish that really matters.

We _ welcome back to Davidson those
professors and instructors who have re-
turned, and: we look’ forward to still an-
other group who expect to return to the
campus during the summer. It has been
necessary for many of them to undertake
work elsewhere, to teach in other colleges,
to enter the armed services of our country,
or to engage in chemical research. You

FRIDAY NIGHT MADNESS

Eight o’clock: A _few managing editors
wandering around the office. Almost all
of the articles turned in. The headlines
are the only thing left. Maybe we can
finish up early tonight:for a change.

Eight-thirty : Hunter dashes in with
his articles; doesn’t like one of the fea-
tures; sits down and rewrites it, and leaves.
Oh, Well! Guess that was all he was sup-
posed to do.

Nine o'clock: The reporters proofread
most of the articles; some few have to be
rewritten. Gunn finally brings in some
overdue pictures, and the front page has
to be done over to make reom for them.

Nine-thirty: We don’t seem to be get-
ting along as well as we should. Maybe
we'll finish by midnight. Here comes Gam-
brell with a handful of advertisements
which have to be made up, and put in the
paper.

Ten o'clock: = ‘Turner comes in; says he’s
been in the library studying Organic all
afternoon and evening. He slaps down his
article on registration and hurriedly leaves.
Says he's got to get to bed early tonight.

Ten-thirty ;.. Barr brings in the fea
tures; complains that ‘Meat Ball’ hasen’t
written the S A E gossip for Among The
Greeks. But we'll have all the features in
before midnight,’ he admits.

Eleven o’clock:' Williamson and Murray
decide to come up and help a little. They
make up the headlines and finish the front
page. Well, one page is ready for the press.

Twelve o’clock: Finally, Edwards shows
up with the sport news, but hasen’t finished
‘Cat Tales yet. Now, what did he do with

that picture of the Davidson-Furman
game?
One o'clock: “Better- late- than-never”

page disgustedly. so he commences to re-
write the main headline, and rearranges
the whole front page.

Two o'clock or after: Well, the paper’s
all finished and ready to go to press, May-
be next week it won't take as long to
finish it up. Now for a good night’s sleep.

To those who were at Davidson

when there was a nérmal student
body, the lights in four’ dormitories
look mighty good. In fact, it seems
nice to have so many men here
after many of us saw the student
body when the number of men did
dred and fifty.

There should be a word of wel-
come for the wives of the Davidson
students. This is one thing on the
campus that seems. strange even
to the men who remember pre-war
Davidson. Little did the editors of
the Davidsonian realize there would
ever be a woman living in Duke
Dermintory when they published
the headlines in the April Fool Issue
(April 1, 1945) saying, “Davidson be-
comes Co-Educational”,

Many changes have taken place
since the great evacuation in 1943.
Probably the most noticable is that
Morrison Hall is no longer, stand-
ing. Last summer the college began
its program of campus improvement.
The biggest eyesore, the delapidated
building formerly used as the Y.-
M.C.A., was the first to go.

The next most noticable improve-
ment might be the absence of the
“barracks”. North and South were
removed last year so that the area
between dormitory row and Cham-
bers~Building could be landscaped.

These aren't the only changes by
any means. Dancing has come to
Davidson in recent years. In 1944,
the Spring Frolics were held in
the Davidson High School Gymna-
sium. Then, in 1945, the Midwinter
Dances were held in the Davidson
College Gymnasium. In spite of the
poor facilities for having the dances,
they were a big success. The gym-
nasium was made into a first class
ballroom.-Since that time, all school
danees—have been scheduled to be
held on the campus.

It will be interesting to see how
the next set of dances’ will'turn out.
These are to be the first set of
dances to be held’ on the campus
since the student body returned
to a fairly normal size. From what
I hear from the members of the
Pan-Hellenic Council, everybody
should have a wonderful time. The
band,
ments, is across between.James and
Dorsey andthe vocalist is a com-

bination of all the movie actresses.

That is an excellent record.

All the students have been yell-
ing for more and better walks. on
the campus since the “rains” came.
The most pressing need is a walk
from dormitory to the side
door of Chambers Building. If you
have waded through the mud from
West Dormitory to Chambers, you
no doubt realize the situation which
must be If you are not
forced to trudge through that mud
you surely must walk from Phi
Hall to dormitory row on the walk

across the walk. Can't something be

In looking through some old
Davidsonians the other day, I ran
across an article on exams. I
thought this might be an appro-
priate time to relate my findings.
The average student cramming for
exams loses two pounds in weight.
That means that 650-Ibs. of flesh
vanished from the Davidson campus
during the last exam period. It is
also a fact that 90 per cent of the
college students in the nation cram
for examinations. Davidsoi~ helps
keep the per centage up. I know of
very few persons on the campus
who did not cram.

Nor the first time in many moons
the students moan’ when they see
mail in their-P. O. box. The reason
is simple. Grades for the last semes-
ter are being mailed to the ‘students
by Mr. Hengevald. Don’t worry fel-
lows, you only have to stay away
one semester before “you can re-
enter. There seem to be quite a few
planning on it.

Look forward to next issue! f’ll
