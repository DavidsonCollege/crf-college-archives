THE DAVIDSONIAN, OCTOBER 5, 1932

Wofford Terriers Bring
Strong Grid Eleven to
Battle Wildcats Friday

Visitors Come to Davidson With Two
Victories for 1932 Season

Friday, Wofford brings its best team in re-
cent years to Davidson to battle the Wild-
cats. Reports from that institution point out
that this year’s grid edition is indeed strong,
possessing a weighty and experienced for-
ward wall coupled with a shifty backfield,
and plenty of reserve power.

Regardless of these rather glaring reports,
‘the Wildcats reign the pre-game favorites,
aJthough the margin of favoritism is very
slight. The last Davidson-Wofford encounter
occurred in 1930, im which encounter the
Cats emerged the victors by a 7-0 tally.
However, since .this date Wofford football
has improved materially and a very close
battle is expected.

The gatnhe was ‘originally scheduled-to be
played on Saturday, but wag pushed back a
day in view of the fact that Wake Forest is
engaging the South Carolina Gamecocks on
that date. This move enables the fans of
the district hereabouts to witness both con-
tests. :

The Wildcat coaching staff stated that
they expectto. start the same lineup used}
against Washington and Lee last Saturday.

The probability is that practically the same
array that began Saturday's game for Wof-|
ford against High Point College will start
against the ‘Cats Friday, the seventh. In!
last Saturday's game with High Point the)!
Terriers rolled up an amazing score of 34-0:|
At no point of the game was a rather strong |
High Point team able to threaten. against |
a bristling Wofford defense. |

In Lon Bouknight and Jack Monroe the
Terriers present a pair of touchdown twins
that will be hard to stop. Bouknight does
the Wofford passing and—punting besides
running the ball nicely. Monroe nicely takes |
care of the line plunging phase of Wofford’s |
attack. Reports also indicate that Monroe!
blocks with terrific force and is the nucleus |

Possession on the Davidson 48-yard line.

Dewey Hutchins, Johnny Mackorell and
George Wingfield, all Sophamores, led the
offensive play for the Wildeats, although
‘they were given much assistance by Pearce
and Peabody, both veterans of several cam-
paigns. Joe Morris at right end and Jack
Wagner at left tackle were outstanding in
the Wildcat line. Wagner sustained a broken

ability as ball carriers, but failed to produce

ed. Captain Bolen, until he was injured,
Boland, Ruffner, and Hanley were stalwarts
in the forward wall. The Generals suffered
in the second quarter when Captain Bolen,
who had played’ a strong game at right
guard, broke his leg, trying to stave off one
of the Wildcat rushes.

Jimmy DeHart-coached team performed on

—and raw tobaccos
have no place in cigarettes

They are not present in Luckies
... the mildest cigarette
you ever smoked

E buy the finest, the very

finest tobaccos in all the
world—but that does not
explain why folks every-
where regard Lucky Strike as
the mildest cigarette. The fact
is, we never overlook the
truth that ‘‘Nature in the
Raw is:Seldom Mild’’—so

“If a man write a better book, preach a better sermon, or make a better mouse-tvap than bis neighbor, tho be
build bis house in the woods, the world will make a beaten path to bis door.’’—RALPH WALDO EMERSON.
Does not this explain the world-wide acceptance and approval of Lucky Strike?

THE FALL OF
CONSTANTINOPLE

"Nature in the Raw’’—as por-
trayed by Thomas Webb... in-
spired by the savage slaughter
of 5000 Christian defenders—
at the hands of the vengeful,
barbaric horde of 250,000
men under the ruthless
Mohammed II—1453!

these fine tobaccos, after
proper aging and mellowing,
are then given the benefit of
that Lucky Strike purifying
process, described by the
words—‘‘It’s toasted”. That’s
why folks in every city, town
and hamlet say that Luckies
are such mild cigarettes.
