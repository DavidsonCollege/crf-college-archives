He even encouraged him to come

“Hf i had my pick of all the

MeGregor is a top student

and a respected leader. One of his teachers said McGre-

ful integration of his high school.

“This boy would be a credkt to Davidson.” Drtesell
said, “even if he didn't plav basketball.”

Another top prospect is Larry Keener, a 6-5 cager
from Marietta. Ga. Last season Keener ran up 24 points
and 25 rebounds a game, and this year he is slightly above

that mark.

Keener is also one of the finest baseball players in

the state. His contacts from

outnumber his cage offers. As a piteher. he has hurted

pro baseball scouts almost

no-hitters in the school’s only two games so far this sva-}

s0n.

Several scouts have advised Keener not to commit
himself to s college basketball team until the next pro

haseball drafts.

Also visiting the campus will be Van Oliver, 8-7

athlete from Cincinnati, Ohio. Oliver is a center who
could be used as a wing man, Holland said. And from
