mister?’’ before you
were sure the big
Buick was really stop-
ping. You follawed in
the back seat.

Yow pleasant-faced
and fifty-ish driver
shifted his cigar into
offensive formation
and kicked off the
conversation. ° ‘Well,

ape By BILL WHITE" you bays will
your first game behind you, won't you? What kind of team you
think you'll have this year?’

Again beaten to the drawl, vou listened while the vearling
ran back the reply. ‘‘This is going to be a lot better year than
last year. You know, they didn’t win but two games last year.
But this year should be lots better. New coach, new formation
—and I’ve never seen such spirit before. And the captain this
year, Auburn Lambeth, 1 guess you've heard of him, well, he’s
about the best passer I ever saw. He has always been real good,
but I'll bet this is his best vear yet, because he’s a senior this year
and has had lots of experience.

You leaned back on your airfonm backseat beneh and
figured the frosh would carry the ball this second quarter, too.
The man. who had, given the boy the ball shifted his cigar to a
defensive position and also figured the red-capped one would
carry on. He did.

‘Coach Little has really got the team in great shape.
too. And that line! Brother! Jasonek and Moates and those fel-
lows may be good, but vou oughta see little ole Henry Wilson
and C. L. Runyan back up that line and those rocks, Jimmy
Fasul and Jerry Kiser, and Bill (MeNeely, and Jack Branch.
and Reynolds, ’n Freeman, ‘n those boys. Man, those freshman
couldn’t move against them. And we've got some good fresh-
men. We're really getting some good boys in there now. They’ve
got a Wildeat Club formed, that’s a highly organized and pretty
powerful booster club that is really bringing the material in.”

Well, not vet quite in the league with Uncle Sam, you cyn-
ically mused, but they are growing. But look ahere. The hoy’s
got a new play. .

“T think we can beat Furman. Shoot, they were supposed
to be so hot. Presbyterian and Washington and Lee sure showed
’em different, and if Furman is better, so are we. I can just
see it now, Lambeth passing; Runyan and Wade hitting those
holes; Guiton, 'n White, ‘n Gregg, ‘n Leach, Stuart slipping
around on those options. Boy, they’re going to give somebody
some trouble from this Little-T.

“I'm glad I eame to Davidson this year, because things
are really looking up. That Wildeat Club should be a pretty
good organization. Just so they give us money and get us
players, they’re tops in my estimation.”

Although he ‘was running the wrong way, the kid had been
covering ground. But now he fumbled. ‘‘ You ever heard of the
Wildcat Club? It is kinda new.’

And his opponent recovered. ‘Yes, I’m a member of the
Wildeat Club.” It was a new ball game.

“I’m glad to see vou so enthusiastic about the new season.
We are enthusiastic, too, but we aren't, and you can’t expect
too much in the way of miracles from Crowell this vear. The
Wildcat Club just got started this summer, and its first trickle
of recruits came in with your freshman class this year. So they
won't even be playing this year. Then, this thing «will grow,
Davidson athletic standards will rise, boys will respond to in-
vitations to the campus, and our days of one-deep line-ups may
be on the way out.” He had scored, and the two front-seaters
changed the conversation to high school basketball, and you
still sat silent, happy over the driver’s win, and weighing the
words of both.

Lambeth will be better this ‘year. The T-formation should
see to that. And in addition to his improvement, Jack Ruth and
Dave Peeler have shown up surprising well as top-flight replace-
ments—almost alternates. But what about our receivers? All
more or less untested. And if Fasul, Kiser, Rogers, Davis, Talbert
& Co. are improved up front, how deep are those reserves?
Injuries could ruin us up the middle.

And Furman. Did Mr. 53 ever have that club pegged wrong,
as some Southern Conference grid scholar may have already
detected. Twice beaten, but still big, fast, and favored. That’s
our foe. The first of nine this fall, all of which could set the
Cats down in order.

Campus Interviews on Cigarette Tests
Number 1... THE PUFFIN BIRD

“What's all the huffin’ and puffin’ about?
I’ve been a Puffin all my life!”

You may think this “bird” is funny — but he’s no

odder than many of the cigarette tests you’re asked to make these days.

One puff of this brand — one sniff of that. A quick inhale —a fast exhale —

and you're supposed to know what cigarette to smoke from then on. The sensible

test doesn’t have to rely on tricks and short cuts. It’s a day-after-
day, pack-after-pack tryout — for 30 days. That's the
test Camel asks you to make! Smoke Camels regularly for
30 days. Your “T-Zone” (T for Throat, T for Taste)
is the best possible proving ground for any cigarette.
After you’ve made the Camel 30-Day Mildness Test,

we believe you'll know why...

More People Smoke Camels
than any other cigarefie!
