Certain major life adjustments con-

in college. They must decide what
they are going to do about vovation,
girls, religion, the church, education,

ficulties involved.

That is just what Blue Ridge is pre-
pared to do this coming summer with
adequate provision for personal con-
ference, forum and group discussion,
inspiring presentations and ample time
for quiet: meditation in the seclusion
of the mountains,and almost unparall-

best skilled leadership to be found is
being drawn from colleges and uni-
versities both North and South.

Running through the Conference
will be a number of smaller interest
groups delving into such questions as
students themselves may choose for
discussion in relation to the applica-

munity. The latter half of the Con-

Wofford Terriers
Defeat Wildcats

The Davidson Wildcats lost a hard
fought game to the Wofford Terriers
here last Wednesday. McInnis and
Hall engaged in a pitcher’s duel for
an extra inning affair.

The Terriers scored in the first
bracket on a home run. The ‘Cats’
were held scoreless until the sixth in-
ning when Armfield was safe on first
after having forced Miller at second,
a sacrifice by Littlejohn and a hit by
MeInnis thus scoring Armfield. The
score remained knotted until the tenth

inning and the Terriers scored two
runs off two hits a sacrifice and an
error. In the ‘Cats’ half of this in-

ning they pushed a marker across but

were unable to tie the score.

“Irish” Melnnis pitched a good
game and did his part at the plate
while “Fritz” Littlejohn played an ex-
ceptionally good game at field robbing
the Terriers of hits. Hall
was the star for Wofford by piteh-
ing an exceptionally good game.
