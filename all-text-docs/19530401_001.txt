Publications Libel Suit

Playboy Michael Gohegan
Myers was arrested March 24
on his return from a very ex-
elusive tour of east coast
Florida. The warrant was pre-
sented and the arrest made by
Chief Honeycutt of this city.

Myers, being sued for libel for
the recent article in Slime Mage-
zine concerning Editors Hanshaw
and Patton, was released by Judge
John Marshall of the Mecklenburg
County Court of Inquisition on
$50,000 bond. Notorious local at-
torney Fred S. Morton will handle
the case for the defendant, while
the well known law firm of Gold-
berg, Feinstein, and O’Mallory will
bring suit for the plaintiffs. The
ease is docketed for June 31.

In an interview with Mr. Myers
he stated frankly and we quote,
“] ain’t got nothin’ to say! Mor-
ton’s my mouthpiece.”

Editors Patton and Hanshaw, in-
vestigating Myers accusations in
Slime Magezine and his recent
conduct and expenditures in Flor-
ida, have released the following
statement:

Since Mr. Myers has violated all
ethics of the publications profes-
sion by publishing erroneous state-
ments which defamed our char-
acter and endanger our fine repu-
tations and good standing in the
eyes of the student body, faculty,
and patrons of Davidson College,
we have no other course of action
but to sue him for libel. We here-
by publically deny his libelous re-
marks concerning the disposition
of Quips and Cranks funds, the
alleged framing of the freshmen
feeding controversy, and other de-
rogatory remarks. We feel that
we should bring to light certain
facts known to us concerning his
many shady dealings particularly
in his recent trip to Florida. Judg-
ing from the disparaging content
of the most recent attempt to pro-
duce a magazine, we can see why
it was wise to leave town five days
before Slime was issued to the
student body. There was something
much more dearer than friendship
to Dave Robinson, business man-
ager of the Quips and Pranks, who
accompanied Myers on his 12 day
extravaganza in Florida. He found
as was expected that the incidental
expenditures credited to Editor
Patton were but a mere pittance
compared with what he saw Myers
squander on his trip. Mr. Robin-
son’s confidential report listed the
following as Myers expenditures at
Daytona: $8400 for Buick Skylork,

* $553.82 lost in poker game with
Johannes under fishing pier,
$2301.12 bet on motorcycle race,
$600.03 for three nights at the
Sharaton Plaza. Expenditures else-
where: $1200 for initiation fee at
Bath and Tennis Club, Palm Beach,
$312.15 for set-ups at Red Barn in
Miami, $1200 for overnight trip to
Nassau, $1010 for bets at Hileah
(no returns), $738.63 for hounds
tooth suit, green suade shoes and
hand painted tie at Bardine’s.

Now from whence did all this
money come? We have absolute
proof that it came from a student
publication. It’s a well known fact
that Quips end Cranks hasn’t had
any money since last Spring, and,
that Hanshaw is holding every
penny that he can to tide him
over during Shaw Smith's proposed

THE FREE LANCE:

Iconoclasts Beware!
Tradition to Triumph

By JUAN

The recent action of the David-
son administration in advocating
the abolition of compulsory Chapel
is undoubtedly the most dastard-
ly display of unbridled totalitar-
janism which our dastardly and

totalitarian administration has
ever had the audacity to promul-
gate.

If the brass in the South end of
Chambers get any asinine ideas
about flushing Chapel down fhe
drain without vivient protest on
the part of the mature, metropoli-
tan, Davidson student body, they
are in for a sad disappointment.

We cannot sit idly by while
these anarchic bureaucrats destroy
the moral fibre which binds our
little community together. Now is
the time to act: we must put our
noses to the grindstone, our
shoulders to the wheel, our hearts
to the task at hand, as we grit
our teeth, take our stance, and
press resolutely onward, throwirg,
caution to the wind and flinging
out the bloody banner in defense
of our cherished traditions.

Do the moguls of the Davidson
hierarchy think they can force this
bitter pill down the throats of us
Davidson gentlemen without
threat of regurgitation? Do they
imagine that their fiendish scheme
for submerging our highest ideals
in a morass of unrestrained licent-
jousness will succeed? It is our
duty and our privilege to resist
this atrocity to the death.

The student committee which
recently appeared before Dr. Cun-
SRR nth aaa

campus-wide boycott of the David-
sonten. So it all adds up! The stu-
dent body deserves an explanatidn!
Myers will be held accountable in
court for his actions and will cer-
tainly receive no less than 20 years
for conduct unbecoming a “David-
son Gentleman.”

Editors Absence Explained

Frank Hanshaw, Editor of The Davidsonian, is currently
in New York consulting with his attorneys in connection with
the legal action which he and Mitchell Patton, Quips and Cranks
Editor, have recently instigated against Michael G. Myers, erst-
while editor of Slime Magazine. Myers, a filth sifting egomaniac

of a journalistic age which we

(ugh!) had believed dead, last

week slandered Messrs. Hanshaw and Patton with bold frontal
attacks launched on the pages of his aforementioned scum sheet.

Howard Proctor, Monk McGill, and Shady Eller have ac-
companied our editor to New York in the hope that they may
be able to lend testimony to the case which will lay open the
doors of justice. All three were recently slandered in personal at-
tacks printed furtively on these pages by Myers. It would be
pressing journalistic prerogative to call Myers what he truly is,
but suffice it to say that this perverted evil-genius will be round-
ly punished for his crimes against humanity.

This edition, in the absence of our editor, was not edited by
anyone. However, as is true with all great institutions, the David-
sonian being a great institution, the powerful journalistic excel-
lence which is seen on these pages sprang forth under its own in-
itiative from the well-spring of creativity, which spring has long
been fed by droplets of brilliance falling from these pages. Slime
slides slowly by, but the Davidsonian drags on forever.

SOTLEY

ningham has presented the fol-
lowing ten-point protest, which de-
mands the attention of cvery
Davidson student:

sary to develop that class spirit
which is so essential to a proper
feeling for the college as a whole.

Kappa Beta Phi
Favors Campus

With Chapter

On March 13 and 14 a chapter
of Kappa Beta Phi, national, hon-
orary, Bacchian fraternity, was
extablished here at Davidson.
Johnny Walker, national Grand
Toaster, and P. M. Smirnoff, the
Old Grand-Dad of Kappa Beta Phi,
journeyed from Lodi, California
for the purpose of initiating the
new chapter officers. The individ-
ual names of the new officers have
been withheld for security rea-
sons. Several members of the
faculty were also initiated into
honory membership, one of which
later stated: “I am gratified that
such a national organization feels
Davidson worthy of the establish-
ment of a chapter of Kappa Beta
Phi This fraternity will add a
real spirit which needs to be nur-
tured on this campus. It is, there-

fore, with a peculiar pleasure that} ‘
I welcome Kappa Beta Phi.”

O' [Holidays Spent

By Greek God
In Home Country

Lawrentius Erwin, King of the
Greeks, returned to his native Ath-
ens during the recent vacation
period. The purpose of his trip
was to introduce to the educators
and students of his land a program
called Freak Week, of which the
Almighty Erwin has become a na-
tionally recognized leader here at
home. Being the only red-headed
Greek in existence, Erwin was
well qualified for his mission. His
plans included an undisclosed haz-
ing program and road trips to
Istanbul.

While at home, Greece's Gift to
D.C. enjoyed an eventful celebra-
tion in his honor. He took part in
the chariot races, and was award-
ed the “Spirit of Snarta” trophy
for winning his heat in a photo
finish. The next day he conferred
the world-famous honorary Degre
of E on three of his loyal subjects
who had successfully oluwn up
the Athens Union Building (Erwin-
disclosed the reason (or this de-
struction, but merely s'ated. “Lis
Aiden Sun Adelphos”, or “Boys
will be boys.”).

Having introduced to this coun-
try the game of Pythias’ Pill
(known in this country as “golf”),
which he learned as a boy in
Greece, Erwin took the Athens
Open, and was thereby accorded
the title of “Pride of Athens”.

While in Greece, he was able
to sign with Ralphos Flanagius for
the annual Mid-Exam Frolics in
May. “Anything for the boys,”
stated Erwin, who is known far
and wide as “the student’s friend.”

Two of Erwin’s immigrant cen-
turians, Laertes Vanee and Orant-
as Darius Kelley, accompanied His
Majesty on the trip.

NOTICE

Governor James F. Byrnes
of South Carolina has request-
ed that Davidson students who
plan to attend the Camden
Races this year make their
hotel reservations early as his
car will not be available for
their sleeping convenience.

The Dean's Office has an-

nounced that owing to admin- °

istrative difficulties no cut
cards will be sent out for the
remainder of the year. He has
asked that students observe
the basic tenets of good taste
and morality in connection
with this matter.

INTERFRATERNITY UNION

Plott, Male Chorus
Grab Loyola Offer

DAVIDSON Donald Plott,
former director of the Davidspn
Male Chorus, sent notice here yes-
terday that he has consented to
stay on at Loyola University in
New Orleans to become Director
of Musical Activities there. After
much debate, the entire Male
Chorus decided to follow Plott,
and transcripts of their records
are to be mailed today in order
that they may enroll for the com-
ing quarter at Loyola.

The big decision was reached
while the chorus was on tour in
New Orleans, but the news has
been withheld pending final ar-
rangements. During a half-hour in-
terview this morning Mr. Plott re-
fused to discuss the question of
salaries, but it was reliably re-
ported that the New Orleans
Catholic school has offered at
least twice the pay which Plott
has received at Davidson.

“I realize this is a big jump,”
Plott stated, “but those people
down there -are terribly nice. I’ve
been hamstrung at Davidson by
academic standards and_ rules
about subsidization. Last year our
first-string tenor flunked out just
as our big spring tour was get-
ting under way. We had to re-
shuffle the whole bass section at
the last minute, and our contra-
puntal attack was all fouled up.

I’ve been assured that adequate
scholarships will be available at

DAVIS SUES FOR PEACE

The air was tense this past 10
Tuesday at 13:46 as the Big Two
met on a neutral ground to dis-
cuss a possible cease-fire program.
The previous moments leading up
to this complete reversal of stand-
ard R.O.T.C. policy clearly showed
the true genius of the People’s
Echelon Of Non-deferreds. A day
that had started out as routine
maneuvers for the military turned
out to be a soldier boy’s night-
mare.

HILL 206 OCCUPIED
With Col. Davis in the lead, the
R.O.T.C. began their weekly un-

| original (regulation quick-time)
march to assume positions for re-
viewing imaginary Mexican Am-
bassadors. But rounding : Duke
Dorm Turn, Davis saw that Hill
206 was in the hands of the hostile
PEONs, Quickly falling to the rear
and leaving flunky Bob Henry to
lead the troops, Col. Davis began
mapping his strategy.

The troops quickly infiltrated
to within the safe confines of a
concrete and wood fortress. The
PEONs. Quickly falling to the rear
giving the orders, surrounded the
fort, began marching around it

THE PEON ARM

wh

and blowing on their trumpets on
the theory that on the fortieth
lap the structure would fall. Davis
knew immediate action would have
to be taken as the fatal lap ap-
proached. So playing the true sold-
ier, he shook hands with all his
aids, turned command over to Capt.
Martin and advanced shakily to
the PEON camp, clothed only in
a white flag.

Gregg, who had cleverly dis-
guised his men as Mexican Am-
bassadors, intervened and saved
the life of Davis just as Private
Eller was about to run the colonel
through with his foil.

THE TERMS

Unofficial UP reports say the
conference which followed went
something like this:

DAVIS: “Ah, come on fellers.
Leave us alone.”

GREGG: “Give us a private ‘to
play with or it’s no dice.”

DAVIS: “We'll be through in a
couple of hours and you can have
the whole fort to yourselves.”

GREGG: “My men grow impat-
ient. They have itchy trigger fing-
ers. Come, come .. . a private or
nothing.”

DAVIS: “But we don’t have any
spare privates. Will a seargent
do?”

GREGG: “We want a private
even if you have to bust a cap-
tain.”

At last report private Martin
was seen going to the PEON’s bill
base with the gleeful Non-defer-

reds.

Loyola, and that we'll be able to
use the four-part harmony system,
regardless of the recent change
in national rules.” —

Asked when the Chorus was
planning to leave, Herb Russell re-
ported, “As soon as possible; the
boys are already getting their stuff
together, and we should be there
by Saturday.

First tenor Vance Mizelle pro-
bably expressed the sentiments of
the entire chorus when he said,
idly fingering a rosary, “Where
Don goes I go.”

FRATERNITIES PURCHASE
COLI EGE PLEASURE PALACE

Smith Remains

As Interfrat

‘House Mother

It was announced today by
the administration of David-
son College that a combine
of fraternities, referred to in
the communique as “The Col-
lectivist Society of Greek Let-
ter Orders” has agreed to pur-
chase the newly compieted Plea-
sure Palace, located across the
street from Richardson Field on
the Davidson College Campus. Fi-
nal negotiations are under way and
transfer of title will be consum-
mated this afternoon at a special
meeting of the Board of Trustees,
Administration, Fraternity Repre-
sentatives, and Officers of the
Wildcat Club. C. Shaw Smith,
former coordinator of student ac-
tivities and director of the Col-
lege Union will remain as house-
mother to the  interfraternity
group.

In a terse communique releas-
ed to a select group of newsmen
in his luxurious offices this morn-
ing Dr. J. R. Cunningham stated:
“It is a very real gratification to
the Administration of Davidson
College that we are able to an-
nounce the sale of the newly com-
pleted Pleasure Palace to The Col-
lectivist Society of Greek Letter
Orders.” When asked if the new
group would have representation
on the Board of Trustees, his re-
ply was a crisp “no comment, gen-
tlemen.”

In a subsequent interview with
members of the internal commit-
tee of the CSGLO it was learned
that the Interfraternity Union
building will be open twenty-four
hours a day and will be strongly
fortified. Any faculty members
caught on the premises will be
interned in the ingenious “Finish-
ing Room” on the second floor,
designed with a French Curve
instead of a T-Square, where they
will suffer the ultimate in brain-
washing techniques. It was also
revealed that Mother Smith's sal-
ary will be determined on a slid-
ing scale based jointly on the
daily fluctuations of the New York
Stock Exchange and proceeds real-
ized from the hourly contributions
of the Wildcat Club. In a short
interview, Mother Smith expressed
deep appreciation to the CSGLO.
Referring to the students, he smil-
ed. “They're all my boys.”
