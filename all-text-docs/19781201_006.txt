_ Denver, Brian Jackson looks
_ like anyone but an aspirant to a
posh dental practice. Dark-
blonde hair halfway down his
back, ;faded jeans in need of
repair, Brian spends much of
his time on campus petitioning
for causes ranging from nuclear
disarmament to solar power.
But in his pocket is an

and he’s confident about get-
ting a place, if not there, at any
of several other medical schools.
Of course, before he interviews,

the long hair and beard will —

have to go, and he fully expects
giving up his causes for the
four-year grind of med school. |

It will all be worth it, though,
says. Brian. “I’m in it for the
money,’’ .he baldly admits.
“And when I’m out, you better
believe I’m looking to practice

where I can make the most

money.’’ Then when enough
cash is in the bank, Brian says
he'll finally “‘be able to do what
I want with my life.’’

It wouldn’t be fair to say
Brian is a typical med student.
Yet it’s hard to argue that
values similar to Brian’s are
typical of the medical system,
and indicative of many medical
school graduates. Every day,
consumers complain more stri-
dently about the exorbitant cost
of medical care, the scarcity of
doctors in rural areas and low
income neighborhoods, and
even about doctors’ ‘‘lack of
concern” toward the patient.

Thus far, the medical profes-
sion as a whole hasn’t actively
responded to the outcry, and so
people are complaining to the
government. The government,
in turn, is going back to one of
the few places it can enact
change, and that is the medical
schools.

HEW proposals
Last month, U.S.- Depart-

ment of Health, Education and >

Welfare (HEW) secretary Jo-
seph Califano handed a long list
of proposed reform to the
American Association of Medi-
cal Colleges (AAMC), to which
all 119 U.S. medical schools
belong. Califano told AAMC
that the nation’s health care
system is characterized by an
“‘oversupply’’ of doctors, too

many of whom are specialists
practicing in affluent areas.

Med schools, said Califano, |

should help resolve these pro-
blems by cutting enrollments,
influencing more students to
study primary care, and urging
them to practice in under-
served areas.

The government, under Cali-
fano’ 8 proposals, would provide

“incentives” like financial re-
wards for reduced enrollment,
recruitment of minorities, or
students from rural areas, and
of students likely | to ‘enter
genetal practice.

to Congress next year. Never-
theless, controversy has already
begun over the effect -- and the

_ effectiveness -- of the proposed

measures.

Most controversial is the
issue of the ‘‘oversupply’’ of

doctors. HEW is calling for the
restricting enrollment because,
Califano estimates, :“‘the coun-
try will have as many as
150,000 excess doctors by the
1990’s.’’ And, according to
Califano, the more doctors there
are, the more services will be
performed, without -the prices
coming down.

Laws of supply and demand,
in short, don’t work in medi-
cine, ‘Califano says. “‘Excess’”’
doctors only contribute to the
“extravagant’”’ health care prac-
tices that have brought the
country’s health bill to $180,000
billion this year. By the year
2000, he added, Americans can
expect to pay $1 trillion -- 12
percent of the gross national
product -- for health care.

Yet some would dispute the
accuracy of a doctor oversupply
given the low doctor-patient
ratio. In Mississippi, for ex-
ample, there are only 82 doctors
for every 100,000 people. A
doctor surplus, some observers
say, could be the only way to

squeeze doctors. out of the-

moneyed areas, and bring about
lower health fees.

Whatever strategy the. medi-
cal schools adopt, the task of
getting more medical students
into under-served areas is pre-

dicted to be difficult at best. In -

the past, government programs
designed to attract medical
graduates into these areas have
not been very successful. _

A study by the U.S. Govern-
ment Accounting Office found
that during the years 1972
through 1977, the federal go-
vernment offered $430 million in
scholarships and forgiven loans
to medical students who pro-
mised te practice in an under-
served area. But 90. percent of

‘the gradutes still decided to

practice in metro areas, where
75 percent of the population
lives.

While the report casts doubt
federal and state governments
continue to offer more’ incen-
tives. The National Health Ser-
vice Corps‘Scholarship program
recently received a 50° percent
increase in its budget for this

year: Nearly $600 million of the |

budget is for 5,000 scholarships

that give med students tuition, ©

fees, atid $6750 for every year
they promise to spend in an
under-served'area. - ~

“The stakes may have to be

higher, though, for students to —

take advantage of such aid.
Brian could have attended the
University of Colorado Medical

center and had 87 percent of his
tuition and fees forgiven if he ©
promised to practice for the ©

same number of years in a rural

orm eis oe

But Brian decided he
wouldal’t enter programs like
that. ‘‘When I graduate, I’ll
still have undergraduate and
medical school loan payments
hanging over my hear,” he said.
“T want to find a better paying
practice so I can pay off those
loans and my equipment as
soon as possible.”’

Perhaps an even bigger head-
‘ache for the government is the
problem of directing medical
students into primary care a-
reas. The need for change is
apparent. Since 1968, the num-
ber of general practitioners has
steadily declined while the num-

' ber of specialized doctors has

climbed. Now, 72 percent of the
doctors in the U.S. limit their
practices to a specialty.

The latest set of statistics
indicates that the trend is likely
to continue. Of the total medical
student population of 1976-77,
only 36 percent said they inten-
ded to go into primary, or
general practice.

Obviously, ‘medical students
would balk at overt attempts to
regulate their field choices, so
Califano’s proposed - remedies
run more on the line of ‘‘expo-
sure” to the need for primary
care. He suggests medical edu-
cators develop courses and cli-
nical experiences in regional
community health problems.

Califano emphasized more
contact with older people, with
a goal of providing more geri-
atric care to the nation’s 24
million people over age 65.
“Thousands of medical stu-
dents are graduated without
ever having entered a nursing
home or taken courses in. the
special health problems of the
elderly,” he complained.

The reason doctors tend to
stay away from geriatric medi-
cine is probably best summed
by Dr. Bill Bevan of Minneapo-
lis: ‘Everyone likes a practice
with lots of young people in it.
You’re dealing with young,
healthy, active people. Their
problems are always acute,
rarely chronic. Your patients
don’t waste away or die on-you.
No matter what people say,
doctors don’t like to watch

‘ disease, either.’’

Educators’ influence”

Yet, Califano maintains that
educators at teaching hospitals
can influence the type of prac-
tice medical graduates choose
by apportioning hospital resi-
dencies according to the needs
of patients rather than the pee:
ferences of doctors.

The most potent impediment

'HEW faces, however, is the

marked salary difference be-
tween the general practitioners

ee

NV seeks change i in med schools, health care

and specialists. While the M.D.
collects an average $53 ,000,
anesthesiologists take home an
average $87,000, while radiolo-
gists can command salaries of
$124,000.

Moving a cemetary

HEW’s new health policy is
thus guaranteed to encounter
more than a few tangles, and
Califano acknowledges this. To
change medical school curricula
as much as they need to be
changed, says Califano, will be
as difficult as ‘‘moving a ceme-
tery.”

Yet, the government still
holds the trump card. About 85
percent of medical schools’ bud-
gets come from federal and
state funds. And Congress ap- -
parently is ready to act on that
tack. ‘‘Congress has always
predicated support of medical
education on the belief that

~medical schools were national

resources prepared to meet na-
tional needs,” said Congress-
man Paul Rogers (D-FI.). “At
no time has support of medical

. education been viewed by Con-

gress as entitlement, but in-

stead has always been tied to
specific requirements designed
to respond to national pro-
blems.”’

DC students discuss medical
- school plans and ambitions

Brian Wilson's story is not
typical of those of ‘several
Davidson students who have
been accepted into medical
schools for next fall.

According to Woody Woodall

Vanderbilt and Duke, it is

one wants to or not,” although
he says this had no influence on
his decision to be a doctor.

Peggy Noel "79, who will .
attend UNC-CH medical school
next fall, finds it “disturbing”
that many people “feel that a
good part of medicine is mon-
ey.” She even feels that one

enjoyable. ”

UNC-CH, the “joy of medicine

lie Cochran ‘79, accepted
at Vanderbilt and the Medical
College of Georgia, and Woodall
plan to practice in rural areas.
They are both interested in the
National Health Service Corps.
The Corps will help finance a
student’s medical education la-
ter in return for service in a
prison, rural area, inner city, or
Indian reservation.

Woodall insists that “there is
not an over-supply of specialists
but an under-supply of primary
care.”

He went on to state, however,
that he could see the problem in

encouraging doctors to practice

in rural areas. He pointed out
that ‘most doctors attended

medical school in an urban area
offering good facilities plus
cultural and educational oppor-
tunities:

“Most incentives to stay are
in the urban area,” notes Wood-
all, ‘‘so you have to offer
counter-incentives.””

Noel offers an interesting
interpretation of the ‘‘over-ab-
undance’’ of specialists. She
suggests that most medical
school students come from com-
petitive backgrounds. where
they were used to bging “‘on
top” of everything. These stu-
dents tend to specialize rather
than become general practition-
ers.

Therefore she feels that psy-
chological reasons often play a
large part in the type of service
