The Wildeat grid- Va

ders approach the
mid-season mark with
a game average’ of
.000 with the two sure
losers gone by. With
the tough William
and Mary and State
games out of the way,
the Cats stand a very
good chance barring
further injuries, of
coming out of the see-
son with but two
losses. Four of the
coming frays will be
close and hard to pre-
dict as. wins, but the .
’Cats can take them. ae Val EN :
The Homecoming advantage over V.M.L. gives them an edge
over the Kaydets. The Richmond and Washington and Lee
frays will both be played on Old Dominion soil, but the Red
and Black is laying for both teams beeatse of last season ‘de-
feats.

Hardest game yet to be won is the last of the season,
with Furman. A Turkey day homecoming affair for the
Furman team, the odds would seem to stand with Fur-
man by virtue of season records so far. Furman’s near
upset of Georgia in their opener still stands out as one
of the biggest surprises of the year, in spite of Georgia’s
loss to Carolina, and the latter’s two outstanding de-
feats.

Len Chewning, a last vear Navy great, will be Hampden-
Sydney’s only standout against Davidson tomorrow, How-
ever, the former Middie tailback will be a menace to Red and
Black vietory motions if le vets away for many broken field
jaunts. He turned in some fine running behind Navy blocking
last Fall, and, though he will no doubt miss the heavy block-
ing, he may still have some sparks of the big-league five.

Coach Story’s boys are suffering their usual mid-
season injury troubles. Bill Boyd, who lost lots of last
season with a broken leg, may miss two games on ac-
count of a busted-up knee ligament. Red and Black sup-
porters will miss Bill's big grin bounding in and out of
the game. Doug Rice is having ankle trouble again, an '
injury. that cost him a first-string birth last fall.

Wet lime on the Memorial Staditun Field last Saturday
has many of the “Cats suffering with raw knees, skins and
elbows. It looks like the gridiron keepers could strike a happy
medium. Mack Erwin is back*in top form. His helper in the
fullback slot, Carl Pahl, will be ready to go by Homecoming
along with Boyd and maybe Doug Rice. Bill Iverson showed
a lot of drive and ability to add fire to the ‘Cat drive Satur-
day against Wofford.

Congratulations to\ ae Whittle's Cross-Country
team. In spite of a gruefling early season pace to get in
top form, the squad has lost only one hopeful, and he a
transfer to football.

The daily dozen begins with-a round-of- calestenies de-
signed, under Pete’s eye, to help the wind and work on the
leg and stomach running muscles>Atter-thirty to forty-five
minutes of this, the boy’s warm up by taking several 220-
sprints on the track before heading for the cake course.

The indomitable Gunder Grey looks like a sure
number one man. He sets a fast pace and comes into
the final half-mile stretch with energy to burn. A few
of the others who are showing up well are Blake Brad-
ley, a freshman with mighty nice form; Bob Grube, Ed
Montgomery, and Murdock McKeithan, to mention a
few. The boys are really getting set for the Homecom-
ing meet with W. and L. which is scheduled to have its
finale during the half of the Homecoming game.

We are hearing a lot of beefs from the J-Vee line-up ,
about the game with CC-UNC the Saturday night of Home-
coming. It is the only night game and the only game not
played on Thursday or Friday. dn short, it looks almost as if
the game was designed to keep the boys from going to Home-
coming.

Of course, this is not the case, but many people are
wondering why the game cannot be played Thursday
or Friday afternoon. Last year the J. V.’s were hauled
off down to Maxton to play P. J. C. Homecoming week-
end. It looks like the schedule-makers coiitd keep an
eye out for the social events, especially one so obvious
as Homecoming.

In-conjunctionwith Ernie Strictlin’s recent chapel talk,
with which we'heartily agree, we have been wondering if the
the Independents could not have a larger.part in intramural
competition. We realize that it is entirely too late to do any-
thing in connection with the current football loop, but one
five-man basketball team, for instance, does not represent
the large number of independents very well,

The large turnout for the basketball squad shows
that there is a lot of interest in basketball, among fra-
ternity men as well as among independents. All of these
men cannot hope to make the squad. We would suggest
that several independent teams be entered in the bas-
ketball and other tournaments.

We realize that one majéy argument against this is the
difficulty in getting one good independent team in many
sports, but we feel that more than one team to support wauld
increase independent interest and activity, Perhaps, the
dormitories could be divided up with, say Duke and East pro-
ducing one team, West and (Georgia another and so forth. We
definitely feel that such a system would increase interest in
intramurals and provide more sports outlets for independents.

Cats Prep For

Hampden-Sydney

With his entire first string line
out with lime burns, Coach Bill
Story got down to work this week

to. find a combination to stop
Hampton - Sydney's ‘T- formation
and former. Navy halfback [em
Chewning.

The Cats are hardest hit at guard
where Bill Boyd has a bad knee
though he may see action this week.
Buddy Chandler and Bob Sharpe,
last. week's starters, are out with
the lime burns, however. This
leaves Red Wilson and Fred Pryor
to handle the main assignments
along with Bob Strickland who's
bad ankle is coming along. At cen-

ter it is doubtful—_if——Johnny
Richards will see much action this
week. Milton Bailey escaped the
lime burns, but he had a bad leg
already. He may have the whole
job this week.

Tackles Ernie Stricklin and Fd

Rhodes are suffering from the white
rash so this job will be left to
Sandy Carnegie and Carl Eborn.
Carnegie still has a bum-knee—and
Eborn is favoring an ankle twisted
last week, but both have worked
out some this week. Frank Strait

will probably get plenty of work
behind these two.

Hal Mapes, Buddy Cheek, Dick
Blanks, Mike Williams and Bill

Johnson are all set at the flanks,
though Mapes still has marks of
burns from the State contest. The
backfield seems to be at full
strength once again, though Mack
Erwin and Carl Pahl are,still not
in top shape for the spinners back
post. Jake Wade and Cliff Turner,
féserve tailbacks, were ailing at the
first of the week but are set to go
now. \

The Wildcats will enter the game
as heavy favorites by virtue of their
victory over Wofford, a team
which rolled over the Virginians
with ease. However, the odds must

fall because of the injury jinx
which has hit the Red and Black
camp.
