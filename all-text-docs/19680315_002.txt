Trustees’ Rule: Asking
For A Second-Stringer?

Dr. Carleton Chapman, dean of Dart-
mouth Medical School, remarked dur-
ing his visit to Davidson last week that
he could think of only a very few men
whom he would consider to be great
college presidents in the United States
today.

In presenting its curriculum plan,
the Blue Sky Committee noted the
tremendous difficulties facing the
liberal arts college today, a situation
that ould seem to demand great lead-
ership at schools like Davidson just to
make them relevant to the modern
world.

Yet, despite this great need at Da-
vidson and despite the small number
of men who might be able to satisfy
that need. the Board of Trustees seems
determined to maintain its rule that
the new president must be a Presby-
terian.

There is really no reason to believe
that there are no qualified candidates
who are Presbyterian. At the same
time there is even stronger evidence
that a person need not be a Presbyter-
ian in order to be an excellent college
president.

No reason can be identified for the
Presbyterian rule other than the old

one of public relations with the Pres-
byterian Church. Naming a Presby
terian can hardly be said to be a way
to pre-determine greatness for the col-
lege.

On the contrary, by limiting fur-
ther the already limited number of de-
sirable candidates, the trustees would
seem to be condemning Davidson to
mediocrity.

We would not be so concerned if
the trustees had indicated some will-
ingness to remove the Presbyterian
restriction, They seem, however. to
be determined to retain the qualifica-
tion.

. Questions about the restriction were
raised by the student advisory com-
mittee, but they have met only with
the answer that this seems to be an
inappropriate time to initiate a re-
moval of the rule.

Ridiculous. No time is more appro-
priate than the present. It is reason-
able to expect the college to be stuck
with its new president for: at least
several years. It will be stuck indeed
if it takes a second-string man simply
in order to fulfill the Presbyterian
restriction.

Reading The NBC Poll

In assessing the results of the New
Hampshire primary Tuesday night,
NBC newsman Frank McGee made
much of an NBC poll taken shortly be-
fore the balloting which indicated the
voters had little real knowledge of
Sen. Eugene McCarthy’s position on
Vietnam.

He implied that the much higher
than expected turnout for McCarthy
was not really a reaction to the war
but was instead an expression of gen-
eral dissatisfaction with President
Johnson.

Jf ‘t was accurate, the poll provided
a verv disheartening comment on
democratic government by indicating
a large percentage of the voters simply

had almost no idea about McCarthv’s

views on. national issue. Supposedly
the senator’s support at the polls was
not really supporting him, but just a
protest vote against the President.
Does this mean then that the vote

had no relevance to the war question? .

Sunday Robert J. Donovan of the
Washington Post-Los Angeles Times
News Service sketched the ways in
which Vietnam has changed Johnson.

According to Donovan. the Presi-
dent is becoming an embittered man
with some feeling that he is being
persecuted, Complaints about the ills
of American society are taken by him
as pnfair personal attacks upon him-
self.

It seems fair to say, then. that Viet-
nam has come to hinder the President
in the preformance of his duty because
it is having intense effects on his per-
sonality. Certainly the war has contri-
buted to his public image as a less
than straightforward individual.

The New Hampshire voters who
were against Johnston may not have

Long-eared

_ Candidates running for elective of-
fices have often been known for be-
having like donkeys. Candidates at
Davidson are no exception.

While it is gratifying that several
contestants in recent and current elec.
tions have been willing to take a
definite stand against what they feel
is wrong, it is upsetting to see that
they have in several instances been
running against the wrong people.

It seems almost unbelievable that
some candidates have identified the
faculty as the source of villiany- at
Davidson. No view could be any less
perceptive.

With few expections, Davidson fac-
ulty members are eminently qualified
to be excellent professors. This much
we hope will be readily admitted by
even the most obtuse of candidates.

What is at stake then would seem
to be the idea that it is the faculty
that prevents change from occuring
at Davidson. Although the charge may
have been valid in the past, it simply
does not hold up today.

Anyone who has had very extensive
dealings with the faculty would have
to realize that its members are far
more aware of and dedicated to the
need for improvement at Davidson
than are most students.

Is it proper to blame the faculty fér
not having changed its archaic rules
governing student life? We think not.
The reason is that, if students are con-
tent with those rules, then why should

realized it, but they were in a mean-
ingful sense voting against the war.

And one more thing. In light of the
publicity that has been given to Mc-
Carthy as a peace candidate, it seems
beyond belief that there could be a
large percentage of voters, ignorant
of his views, who were at the same
time aware of Johnson’s stated posi-
ion.

The NBC poll casts no doubt on one
candidate that does not fall on the
other. It does, however, shake one’s
faith in popular elections.

.

Gi

A Promise '

To Keep?

President Johnson and Secre-
tary of State Dean Rusk have, in
recent weeks, made much of the
need for the United States to keep
its word by staying in the fruit-
less Vietnam slaughter, Fine, it
is great to be trustworthy.

But we wonder how well off
the U.S. would be today if John-
son had kept his promises of the
late 1940’s and early 1950's to
oppose civil rights legislation. It
was an unwise position then, and
its maintenance would not even
be supported by Johnson today.

It seems to us that a reason-
able reassessment of an unwise
promise is much more respecta-
ble and certainly more right than
blind refusal to admit error.

Candidates

the faculty think the rules are unrea-
listic?

Now you say, “How in the world
can they think we are content with
those rules when we gripe about them
all of the time?” Except for a few very
Scattered student government resolu-
tions and some shouting to the wind
by THE DAVIDSONIAN, very little
discontent with the rules has been
shown by students. Gripes over the
meal table and covert breaking of the
Tules are not ways to show why the
rules should be changed.

In order for the Board of Trustees
to approve any policy changes, it is
necessary for them to feel that the
changes are really desired. If the
faculty were to initiate changes in
Student life, what reason would the
trustees have to believe that students
really wanted the changes?

In dealing with fraternity issues,
one of the reasons the trustees have
been so slow to act is that they have
not wanted to accept faculty recom-
mendations that might not be support-
ed by students. At the same time, one
of the reasons the trustees did accept
the Blue Sky curriculum was that stu-

dents had demonstrated their support .

of the program.

_Everybody is sick of hearing the old
Cliches about student apathy. But until
studehkts show whaf they want, student
politicians had better find a more vul-
perable target than the faculty to at-

ck.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Williams Attacks
McMillin Position

To The Editor:

While reading the letter of
Prof. Ray McMillin which
has appeared in the last two
issues of THE DAVIDSON.
IAN, I was disturbed not so
much by the specific charges
he made against students, as
by the general picture of
students that he tried to cre-
ate.

tn painting them as irre-
sponsible and immature, he
was quite unjustified, at

feast in my opinion.

He accused students of be-
ing ultimately responsible for
the locked fire extinguisher
box in Little Dormitory dur-
ing the recent fire and of
trying to shift the blame to
the administration. Yet it
seems to me he is trying to
shift the blame entirely back
to the students which is what
he accused us of doing—in-
stead of letting it rest equally
with both groups.

Bentley Urges
Computer Dean

To The Editor:

Sitting in economics the
other day while the professor
was talking about the effect
of substitute goods on a par
ticular product's market, |
was struck with a revolution
ary idea on how the college
could save some money.

As budget minded and
computerized (e.g., grade re-
ports, registration, etc.) as
Davidson is becoming, why
not go whole-hog and have a
computerized dean of stu-
dents, thus saving a salary
that could be used to expand
the faculty?

All the Executive Com-
mittee would have to do
would be to feed the rules
into the computer, a stu-
dent’s problem could be
programmed into it, and s
yes-no answer would be
readily available without
the possibility of human
error.

Whatever personal and
academic counseling would be
necessary could be the re-
sponsibility of the Student
Counseling and the Chap-
lain’s offices which are es-
pecially trained in counsel-
ing.

Of course the computer
would not take the initiative
whenever a change should
be needed. Nor could a com
puter call itself anything:
but perhaps students would
refer to it aS being an ‘in:

stitution’’ machine or ‘pro
gram-tied."

Along this same line, !
would make certain that
the following statement be
dropped from the 1967 Wild-
cat Handbook, quoting Dr.
Harold Taylor, philosophy
professor and a past presi-
dent of the Board of Trus-
fees of Sarah Lawrence, in
a Saturday Review article:

“At its best, education is a
series of private conversa-
tions in which all sham, pre-
tense and intellectual hypoc-
risy or name-dropping is
stripped away and the stu-
dent is free to respond with
honesty to the intellectual
and -personal situation in
which he finds himself.

“This is why it is so im-
portant to keep the stu-
dent’s situation as free of
educational formalities as
possible, to insist upon
some version of the tutor-
lal system, to resist all ef-
forts to build an imperson-
al administrative communil-
ty, to assure that the stu-
dent and the teacher are
known to each other and
that the student may thus
benefit from the fact that
his individuality is known,
recognized and respected.”

And the whit: of machin-
ery just might add a little
dynamic quality to the office
of the dean of students.

Joe Bentley ‘68
Davidson College

If Prof. McMillin had read
further in the same issue, he
would have noticed that the
Student Council immediately
initiated a Campus Safety
Committee to work with
Grover Meetze's office toward
preventing in the future such
disasters as the fire and the
injuries due to slick walks in
January.

As for examinations, !
don’t see how in the world
Prof. McMillin can claim
flexibility for the present
policy. How about the poor
student who misses two or
three examinations due to
sickness?

Is it fair to make him miss
most of his spring vacation
just because he got sick at
the wrong time, when he
could take them at the pro-
fessor’'s convenience under
the honor system? Surely
Prof. McMillin will admit
that the memorizing neces-
sary for any exam is much
more difficult after two
months.

Besides, if the purpose of
an examination is to make
the student draw together
the material in the course in
some sort of logical continui-
ty, it is obvious that he can
do this much better while the
material is fresh in his mind.

tn a couple of weeks, the
CRAP Committee is going
to present a report based
on concept that a college
should try to develop re-
sponsible citizens and that
this responsibility can best
be learned through free-
dom.

The committee is trying
specifically to separate the
important issues, such as
drinking, from the small
ones, such as not closing the
door to Phi Hall. Hopefully
Prof. McMillin was not ser-
fous about some of what he
said.

Without drawing this letter
out to great leneth (like some
of us), I only hope that those
who read the CRAP Commit-
tee’s report will do so with
a more open mind and will
carefully examine the ma-
turity of the students.

Political Parallels

The watchword for the past few days in both na
tional and campus life has been politics. In New Hamp-
shire, the candidacy of Eugene McCarthy has, I hope,
shown to the administration what is evident to every-
body else — that the war in Vietnam is far from being
a national crusade in the minds of the American elec-
torate. .
On the other side of the ledger, the Republican
party has indicated that it prefers to follow its death
wish and nominate Richard Nixon, one of the few
Republicans who could conceivably lose to Johnson.
Apparently, a majority of Republicans in New Hamp-
shire were convinced that this is indeed a new Nixon
and were sufficiently assured that he now knows how
to avoid five o'clock shadow on television. __

The results of the elections currently being con-
ducted on the Davidson campus exhibits a certain
parallel to events in New Hampshire. ;

Hopefully, the success of Joe Murphy’s candidacy,
like the success of McCarthy’s has pointed out to the
administration dissatisfaction with the way things are
done, in this case with regard to the present structure
of rules and regulations at Davidson. Certainly, Mur-
phy’s election has proved, like Nixon’s, that slickness
is not an essential for election to office.

tt would be misleading to carry the parallel too
far. For one thing, there is a chance of concrete re-
sults from the campus elections. McCarthy has a long
way to go, I fear, before he will be considered enough
of a threat by the national administration to make it
change its ways.

For another thing, not a whole lot of people really
ive a damn what Davidson does with its drinking rule,
or example; what happens in Vietnam, on the other

hand, could conceivably make some difference twenty
years from now.

Local Poll

1 took an informal poll yesterday of the important
people around Davidson, to measure public opinion
concerning the general state of things in America and
at Davidson. The first person I talked to was the grim
baker. (I started the polling fairly late at night.)

He seems to favor a return to small-town living
and middle-class virtues. He also expressed a desire
that the Negro race might return to their proper sta-
tion in the great chain of being. He further favofs
Strong anti-trust laws against North Carolina bread
manufacturers. |

Hattie Morgan echoed the grim baker’s views
about the role of black people in American society,
apparently believing the Southern redneck to be the
backbone of American society.

She also came up with an original proposal to en-
hance the quality of American life, suggesting that an
injunction be brought against the Southern Railroad
to constrain the line from running trains on the Thurs-
day night before Spring Frolics. She also seemed quite
adamant in her opposition to any form of beer sales
within the town of Davidson.

1 also attempted to poll the phantom caller, whom
I ran into at the Hub during Humanities period. How-
ever, he was too engrossed in his Marvel comic book to
answer any questions.

Students Favor More Changes

The loser in a student body

election has one consolation:
the time he spent campaign-
ing could certainly have been
spent in a less profitable
way. .
In fact. I think I learned
more about the student body
in one week than I have in a
whole year of reporting Stu-
dent Council meetings.

Most students seem very
enthused about the elections
this year. Almost everybody,
especially freshmen, were
eager to devote a half hour
to discussing what Davidson
needs most.

Maybe the new constitution
has awakened some interest.
Maybe it was the large num-
ber of candidates for presi-
dent. Maybe it was Tom

Earnhardt. Or Joe Murphy.
But whatever it was, I hope

it will continue throughout

the year.

Most students seem aware
that next year will be a big
year for Davidson. They are

also aware that students now
have an increasingly import-
ant roie to play in campus af-
fairs. So the logical conclu-
sion is that they might as
well satisfy as many gripes
at once as they can.

Pass-Fail Has No Effect

By Intercoliegiate Press
Association

If you're an ‘A’ student,
you find it hard to change
your study habits to earn
only a '°C’’ grade—even when
that’s all that is necessary
and all you want to achieve.

This seems to be the result
of an experimental ‘'pass-
fail’ option adopted by the
University of Michigan Col-
lege of Literature, Science.
and the Arts.

Beginning last winter, sen-
iors were permitted to take
one course outside their ma-
jor field of study on a pass-
fail basis, with the credits to
count toward graduation but
not toward their [ind] grade-
point average. This year the

.

faculty has extended the -

privilege to juniors too. In
general, students have wel-

comed the innovation as giv-
ing them a chance for aca-
demic exploration.

But compilation of grades
achieved by 178 of the 203
students who took advantage
of the option in its first year
indicates that-the “good stu-
dents’’ did their usual level
of work in the pass-fail
course. The pass-fail students
were in the same classes as
students taking the course
under the traditional grading
and credit system.

The level of performance
of the pass-fail students in
the courses was similar to
their general grade ‘point av-
erage for all work taken in
the university.

Charles Pascal, a research
associate who conducted the
study for the Center for Re-
search on Learning and
Teaching, said ‘“‘We were sur-
prised that students were not

more adept at playing this
new academic game.”

He said that even though
the students sought only to
achieve a passing level their
previous years of ‘academic
conditioning’’ made it diffi-
cult if not impossible to do
so. The students themselves
were surprised, he says. One
pass-fall student expressed it
this way:

“I'm trying hard not to
work and I still made a B-
plus on the midterm exam.
I find myself trying to do the
minimum amount of work to
get a C. Otherwise I am frus-
trated that I am wasting
time in the (pass-fail) course
that I could be spending on
the other courses (in which
grades are recorded).”

Pascal recommends ‘pass-
fail sections, in which all stu-
dents are enrolled on the
pass-fail system.

Students have some good
ideas and suggestions, too.
They are especially conscious
of the living conditions, since
this is what they feel affects
them the most. They are
rather undecided about the
new curriculum, for the most
part, but they do know that
the dormitories are pretty
terrible. :

They are tired of the col-
lege’s hypocrisy about the
drinking rule, which they only
pretend to enforce and which
thev know students constant-
ly disobey. They are tired of
the administration's support-
ing an outworn in loco paren-
tis attitude toward the stu.
dents. They want to prove
they are budding young gen-
juses outside the classroom
as well as inside.

Of course, they don’t go
around shouting it all over
God’s heaven. They are will.
ing to leave the work to their
student government represen-
tatives. But they do want to
see the changes, and they
want to see them soon. After
all, college is for the students,
isn't it?

They are thinking in other
areas too. They have opin-
ions about chapel, the Union
food, lounges in the dorms,
open dorms, the cut system,
examination policy, sympos-
iums and Lingle Manor. The
opinions are not uniform, but
the important thing is that
they are thinking.

words in length.

Fasting At Smith
Profests Vietnam

By Collegiate Press Service

More than half the students
at. Smith College have just
completed a three-day fast
against ‘the war in Vietnam.

The 1,285 girls, all wearing
green armbands, were allow-
ed liquids such as fruit juices
and bullion during the three-
day period, but not solid food
or milk.

A number of faculty mem-
bers and townspeople were
also fasting.

According to one of the or
ganizers, Kathy Green. the
fast was partly intended ‘to
dispel the public's image of
the typical college dissenter
as merely a_ draft-dodger
concerned with the safety of
his own skin.”
