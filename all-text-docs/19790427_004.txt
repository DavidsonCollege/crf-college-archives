it was a mistake. in protocol. Of course there was no
maliciousness involved. It simply illustrates a certain
haste'and carelessness in preparation. The entire incident
evolved from a simple misunderstanding.

It is @asy to see how such
an incident would occur. In @
an institution such as David-

“son, where dealings on an
informal basis are the gener-
al rule, it bécomes difficult
to estimate how they will be

_ feceived. In this case, infor-
‘mal Southern hospitality did
not translate. Naturally, the
college treated Carr as any %
other speaker. But to one
who is particularly attuned

to: racial and national. dif- :3%
ferences it appeared as a &
slight. Again we cannot
estimate the importance placed by an. African on. the
meal. From the cultural perspective; symbolism obvious-
ly was very important. It is understandable that our lack of
sensitivity to his upbringing and viewpoints could be
mistaken for disinterest.

Several implications have suggested that Carr, in the
face of growing displeasure from the Kenyan govern-
ment, used Davidson. Allegations assert’ that Carr
fabricated an incident to improve his image in Kenya.
Details of Carr's abbrebiated visit appeared last Friday in
Kenyan newspapers. But the College, knowing his
background, was aware that Carr was a controversial
man. As were other lecturers to Davidson ranging from
William F. Buckley and James K. Kilpatrick to former
energy czar, Frank Zarb, Carr was invited to raise the
consciousness of the college community. Can we,
therefore, question the motives of someone who
apparently acts on his complex convictions?

Unfortunately, owing to his hasty departure, Carr’s
intentions and message have been horribly confused. In a
conversation Wednesday evening, Carr explained the
lesson he hoped his action would provide: “1 hope that
Davidson College will re-examine the opportunities and
the advantages that it enjoys by having international
Students. By having people from other countries, you
offer the opportunity for broadening yourselves and
sharpening your sensitivities. Consequently one would
hope to be better equipped to be world citizens; to deal
with the world on the world’s terms.”

By leaving so abruptly, Carr failed to illustrate the
impact that culture, or insensitivity to culture, has in
political and church.relations with African nations. Of
course the old adage, actions speak louder than words
could be applicable. But in this incident, the personal
turmoil surrounding Carr worked against his intentions.
His message has since been misconstued. We did» not
know enough; we, not being as racially and politically
aware, were not sensitive to the cultural differences
which prompted his objection.

In light of this controversy, we should re-examine our
policy towards international students. Ideally, their
presence should provide a situation of mutual benefit and
awareness. Yet obviously this has not been the case.

Honor Code

To the Editor:

The current upheaval over
the Honor Code and Code of
Behavior has me confused. I
have never really felt the honest
presence of these two guidelines
for as long as I’ve been here, in
spite of the fact that as an
eighteen-year-old I apreed to
abide by them.

Recently. two people were
excused from this ‘‘fragile
society,’’ one for behaving im-
properly according to the Code
of Behavior’s program, the
other for taking what was not
his. ;

I was astounded initially,
that any group of people felt
they had the right to expel
someone whom they felt didn’t
mold to their demands. That is
beside the point, since both
codes are firmly established
components of the institution
called Davidson College.

The other day, in a presenta-
tion to the class, one of my
classmates freely admitted
having stolen a book from

another college. The classmate

justified taking it by remarking
that it was needed to research
an obscure topic. This was in
the presence of the professor
and he, along with my class-
mates, snickered at the
“‘prank.’’ Yet, had the book
been pilfered off a Davidson
shelf, the student, once discov-
ered, would presumably be pun-
ished. Somehow our ideas of
right and wrong have been
perverted. It is wrong to steal

from within Davidson, but it is
an honest intellectual effort to
steal from another college.The

professor even suggested she
donate it to the Davidson
library.

A friend of mine was told
during his pre-admission inter-
view that Davidson attempts to
educate the student ~ by
removing him from the corrup-
tive world, and by creating a
sense of purity in him so that
when he returns, he may better
the world with this. newly:
learned Davidson purity. Who
wicare tw sdies: eect, ‘the

booted out by a disapproving
group? Something is very
wrong. Honesty can’t be propa-
gated that way.

-Open-mindedness
To the Editor:

Davidson seems to be going
for a record these days. The
latest example of the insensiti-
vity that is rampant on campus
is the disregard of the feelings
of both a visiting dignitary and
the college’s own African ex-
change student. As a well-edu-
cated and respected member of
the African continent, Jean-
nette should have been much
more involved in the activities
surrounding Canon Burgess
Carr’s visit. Yet she was not.
Whether through ignorance or
incompetence, the significance
>of the role Jeannette could have
“played was overlooked.

It is doubtful that the intent
was malicious. Individuals res-
ponsible for this most recent
event have publicly apologized.
Unfortunately, however, this
will not make up for the distress
felt by Jeannette or the tears
shed by Carr after he admirably
maintained his diplomacy
throughout the meal.

The most Davidson can do to
make amends for this particular
mistake is to pay Carr for his
lectures and extend the invit-
ation for him to return. The
man is not bitter, nor did he
“use’’Davidson College. Canon
Burgess Carr merely expressed
his honest and heartfelt reaction
to a terrible blunder. In the
process he has hopefully opened
up a bit of the narrow minded-
ness present at this school and
from here we can move onward,

“Christian” soldiers.
