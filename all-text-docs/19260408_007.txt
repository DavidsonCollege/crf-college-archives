THE DAVIDSONIAN, APRIL 8, 1926

Fraternities Give _
Victrola to “Y”

The new “Y” room has been materially
improved by the addition of a new Orothor-
phonic Victrola, a gift of all the fraternities.
This machine was recently purchased in
Mooresville and was installed in the “Y”
room in time for the Easter festivities.
Numerous records were also contributed by
the various fraternities.

By the addition of the new Victrola the
equipment of the “Y” is almost complete and
it is becoming a popular reading and recrea-
tion room. It fills a long felt need at Da-
vidson. Up until this time non-fraternity
men have not had any place at which they
might gather for their, social life. The new
“Y” room amply answers this need. ‘|

The members of the Pan-Hellenic Council
felt that this move would improve the feeling
between the fraternity and non-fraternity
men at Davidson. The three local fraterni-
ties co-operated in the gift. This was the
only feature which the “Y” room lacked to
make it a complete social center. Albert
Hill house, who is secretary of the Y. M. C.
A., has requested that the boys make them-
selves at home in the room and feel free tb
come there at any time.

A Chinese Glee Club under the direction
of Cheng Me Sun has been organized at
Ohio College.

Harry Vance is Awarded,
Norris Athletic Trophy

All-Around Athlete Vi Wins Over Con-
testants in Final Ballot

On last Wednesday evening at the
Athletic night sponsored by the “Db” Club,
Harry Vance was presented the Norris!
Athletic trophy for being adjudged by |
his fellow students as the best all-around
athlete in Davidson College. The trophy,
a large silver loving cup,was presented by ,

the Norris Candy Company of Atlanta,
Ga. It becomes the permanent posses-

sion of the one fortunate enough to win
it. A recent ruling prevented Flake Laird,
who won one such cup in his sophomore
year, from being eligible for competition
for the cup. This rule provided that no
man who had won the cup once should be
elibible to enter into the voting again.

In being awarded this cup, Vance won
over Anderson and Harrison. These
three men had been chosen on the first
ballot by the students for this honor and
the final ballot decided in favor of Vance.
For three years Harry has been playing

on the Wildcat football team and has
made his letter in wrestling for three
vears. He has made only two letters in

baseball but is playing on the varsity
niné now and has been doing excellent
work with the stick and in the field.

The following are the rules governing
the award of this trophy:

1. The Norris Athletic
mittee, made up of the
leties, the chairman of the faculty ath-
letic committee, the graduate manager
of athletics, the president of the student
body, and the with Mr.
Frank KEK. Lowenstein, of Atlanta,
ex-officio chairman, shall have charge
of the details of awarding the trophy.
In the absence ofthe ex-officio chairman,
the director of athletics shall preside at
all of the committee. The
alumni secretary shall act as secretary to
the committee, and shall keep a record of
all proceedings.

4. The three men receiving the highest
