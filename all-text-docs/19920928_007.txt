THE DAVIDSONIAN OPINION S

In Black and White: Deidra Montague
and Scott Windham

We're back, to the delight of
some and the distress of others.
We say this because we have re-
ceived overwhelmingly positive
feedback not only from family and
such, whoare required to be nice to
us, but also from students.and fac-
ulty. Which means one of two
things: either everyone loves us, or
those who hate us aren’t saying so.
To those who like us, thanks; to
those who don’t, tell us why (be
nice). Remember: communication
is one of the keys to our goal. To
paraphrase our friend and current
SGA head guy Anthony Foxx, as
long'as everyone knows what ev-
eryone else is thinking, we can
begin to accept each other’s ideas.

What follows is a theoretical
conversation:
Scott: You know, Deidra, you and
I were talking about “appearances”
and the way white and black people
view each other. I remember one
party at the BSC last semester
where I was one of two white
people, with about sixty black stu-
dents. I said to you, “This is the
first time I’ve been a minority.” I
don’thave some sort of weird aver-
sion to black people (I wouldn’t go
tothe BSC if that were the case); in
fact, it was kind of an eye-opener
forme. What did bother me, how-
ever, was that some people were
giving me The Look. Most people
were friendly, but it was like some
black people felt I was out of place:
that wasn’t my kind of music,
wasn’tmy house, wasn’ tmy crowd.
Like they were superior to me, like

I was uncool because I’m white.

Deidra: I don’t think the people at
the party were trying to make you
feel uncomfortable; in fact, you
probably knew alotofthem. How-
ever— and this is a complete as-
sumption on my part, because I
can’t read the minds of other
people— the people who didn’t
know you may have been curious
as to why you were there; they may

‘ have assumed you wouldn’t like

the kind of music they were play-
ing. This is the type of assumption
that we’re trying to make people
question: it’s unfair to base your
expectations about a person’s be-
havior on his or her color. This is
also the type of assumption that
white people occasionally direct
towards me. There have been times
when I’ve been at parties on the
Courtand felt very uncomfortable,
because I was the only black per-
son there and I noticed that people
were looking at me. Of course it
eases the situation when I’m with
friends, because I only get The
Look: from strangers. It really
makés me wonder what they are
thinking and how I appear to them:
maybe they are looking at me be-
cause I am the only black person at
the party, or maybe they’re look-
ing at me because they recognize
me from a class.

Scott: So the feeling I had at the
BSC is the feeling you have from
time to.time in other situations.
Deidra: Yes. I do know, on the
other hand, that some people think
you should only hang around
people of your own race or ethnic

group simply because they assume
you are not supposed to have any-
thing in common with other racial
groups. If they have friends who
share this viewpoint they feel pres-
sure to conform to the group feel-
ing. People like this think that if
you’re at the BSC or I’m at one of
the fraternities, we’re in the Wrong

place.

Scott: Yes, that’s true for blacks
and whites. But for the most part,
Ithink Davidson students justmake
the mistake of making false as-
sumptions. Like when you were
surprised to find out that I like
Public Enemy and when I was sur-
prised to find out that another black
friend of mine doesn’t.

Deidra: Most of the time, I don’t
care about The Look because I am
going to hang with the people I
want. It’s who I want to be with
and who I like and the people I
have something in common with.
The majority of my friends are
black butnotall of them; my friends
are my friends and that’s the way
it’s always going to be.

We think it’s important .to
emphasize that racism isn’t just
directed by whites towards blacks.
It can also be directed by blacks
towards whites, or it can be “intra-
racial” pressure: whites pressuring
whites or blacks pressuring blacks.
To place expectations on anyone
based on color is common to most
individuals, including the two of
us, but it is also something we
should try.to avoid. Think aboutit.
Act upon it. See you next time.

Deep Thoughts: Kirby Shealy
Join Up With Davidson Together

In the wake of the so-called
end of the Cold War, for which our
esteemed President has somehow
taken the credit, we, as a nation,
must now turn to more pressing
issues at home. No longer can we
cringe in fear or focus our efforts
or devote our taxes to one giant
monolithic enemy abroad. Instead

we must now look inward at the

enemies that threaten our strength,
our productivity, and our economic
well-being.

These enemies bearno resem-
blance to the seedy, evil, vodka-
soaked Russians that our genera-
tionand those preceeding it learned
to hate’ years ago. In fact, they
aren’t even people at all. Our en-
emies are the domestic problems
which have been festering while
everyone’s attention was else-
where.

Low standards of education,
rising health care costs, govern-
ment corruption and stagnation,
and intolerance of others all be-
came acute problems while we
spent umpteen billion dollars and
the last forty years building a “de-
fensive” battery of nuclear and
high-tech conventional weapons.

Perhaps a shifting of our eco-
nomic resources willalleviate some

of these problems. However, in
order for our ever-so-swift gov-
ernment to even begin such an
endeavor, wecitizens must undergo
a change in attitude so our leaders
will want to fight these problems
to have any hope of reelection.

I believe this process has al-
ready begun. The outcome of this
year’s Presidential election will
prove how far. We haveachoice to
vote for change or to retain our
“Admiral” who mutters his mantra
“stay the course” even as the ship
of state runs aground and the crew
considers mutiny.”

Despite appearances (and the
deadly, biting sarcasm), the above
paragraph is not my point. Chang-
ing attitudes involves more than

. just changing presidents. Let me

give you an example. Over the last
couple of years, this campus has
reflected in microcosm the rising
feelings of intolerance that have
plagued the entire nation in the
same period. However, much to
our good fortune, Davidson boasts
several groups whose purpose is to
combat these feelings. Davidson
Together is one of these. (Now you
begin to understand that what lam
writing is not so much a political
opinion but something far worse—

+

an advertisement.) John Patton,
Sam Adams, and others formed
this group a couple of years ago
upon the realization that the rail-
road tracks effectively divide this
town in two. A large number of
people on both sides of this “bound-
ary” work with the College in some
capacity, but after work, everyone
returns home to their “own” com-
munity.

Why such passive segregation
continues in the 1990’s I won’t
venture to guess, although I will
say that Davidson Together serves
to combat the cultural misunder-
standings and fears that often ac-
company it. The group meets ir-
regularly and informally with an
emphasis on getting to know those
in the community.

On behalf of John Rowe, and
those who have supported us be-
fore, I would like to invite and
encourage all students, faculty,
staff, and members of the commu-
nity to attend our next meeting.
You'll see flyers for dates and
times. If you have any ideas or
would like more information, feel
free to contact me at -6801 or John
Rowe at -6338. Merci beaucoup.

Frampton Rules:

"The Other

Side of the Story"

When I was about thirteen
years old I began puberty. That is
probably a little late, a fact that
would explain why I can grow a
full stubble on the bottom of my
chin in a week. Anyway, I think

this girl, if you all have things in
common, and you may learn that
you really don’t want to date her.
That is the best pick-up line in the
world.

ae course, itnever works. Try

what that wasall about. Tobe sure,
it still takes guts to call some girl
and ask her to homecoming, but
now the process has changed. Guys
want to know everything about a
girl from whether she throws or
not to whether she hooks up or not.
So, inorder to help you guys figure
it out, here is a cluc, taught to me
by a wise post-grad, that always
worked for him. (To be honest I
haven’t been able to try it out, but
you might.)

Walk up to said girl, face
slightly tilted to the left (or right),
and introduce yourself. ‘Then be-
gin talking to her, asking questions
that will, hopefully, lead to a better
conversation. (i.c. Where are you
from? Are you enjoying school so
far? etc.) You may begin to date

Of course, alright to -

girl who doesn’t wantto even touch
you. Every guy has tried to kiss a
girl only to have her do “the Iean,”
a slow movement away from your
face that looks like acatapult being
pulled backward. Can you say
embarrassment?

Then again, that could be bet-
ter than being slapped, or, worse,
having all of her fricnds Icarn later
in the night that you are a “huge
cheese.” Of course, you know
that’s not true, you’re just inter-
ested. (Don’t forget, they are too
or we wouldn’t have babies.) So
here is a quick up. If you get
rejected, apologize profusely. At
the least you will be pardoned, and
atthe best you will geta guilt hook.
