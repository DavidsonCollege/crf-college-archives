Wres tling Wildcats split double-header

By JOHN RoE
Sports writer

Finally getting a chance to
wrestle athome Saturday, the Wild-
cats didn’t want to disappoint all
the fans who came out to support
them.

WRESTLING

In two exciting matches, fans
saw an inspired team that, accord-
ing to coach Tom Oddo, “found a
way to win.”

Davidson avenged an earlier
loss to Longwood by the score of
24-22 in the first match, while fall-
ing to The Citadel 25-19 after sev-
eral strong performances.

Against Longwood, it was Bo

Bartholemew that came up with a
clutch showing in the heavyweight
match. Trailing by four points,
Bartholemew was the last hope for
Davidson. For the team to win, he
not only had to win, he had to pin
his opponent.

In less than three minutes, he
did just that, throwing his oppo-
nent to the mat and sending the
Wildcats to the victory.

Earlier, Davidson jumped out
to a 9-6 advantage. Andy Sterling
then wrestled a match that went
into the last minute. Sterling even-
tually lost, but his effort sparked
the team’s intensity. After that,
George Escaravage, Miller Cary
and Derek Spencer put three
straight wins together and gave the
Wildcats the 18-12 lead.

In an equally exciting match
against The Citadel, Sean Harvey
provided the spark for the team.

With the score tied 4-4 in the third
period of his match, Harvey turned
his opponent to his back with an
inside cradle and held on to win 6-
4.

Sterling followed with a vic-
tory, and, in one of the most excit-
ing matches of the day, Jesse
Kenner took down Bobby Stewart
in overtime fora6-4 win. Davidson
eventually came up short, but the
team wrestled as well as it has all
year.

“These were the most excit-

ing matches of the season,” Oddo {

said. “The spirit and intensity of
the team was the best I’ve ever
seen it.” The Wildcats hope to
maintain the intensity against Ap-
palachian State and Tennessee-
Chattanooga this week and then
carry the effort into the conference
tournament in Asheville in the fi-
nal stretch of the season.

ported the pack during most scrum
downs. Acting team president Tom
Shelbourne was a driving force
behind the spectacular defense that
held Southwest to only one try.
Shelbourne also had some nice
assists to Priestly and Potter that
resulted in impressive scores.

Southwest Virginia managed
to score late in the game after a
long run up the middle of the field.
That last-minute surge was not
enough, however, and they were
forced to channel their energy to
the after-game festivities.

Priestly dodges two opponents.

inbounding the ball and had to
burn ASU’s last timeout to avoid a
five-second violation.

Then, Cook had trouble get-
ting the ball inbound again and
attempted to throw the ball off
Anderson’s legs so that it would
bounce out of bounds and go back
to ASU. But, somehow, the ball
took a strange bounce and hit Cook
on its path over the sideline, turn-
ing the ball over the Wildcats.

After one more Davidson
timeout, Williams inbounded the
ball to Ray Minlend, who, accord-
ing to the plancoach Bob McKillop
drew up, had three options. The
first choice was to find Williams

again if he was open. The second
was for Harwood, and Minlend
was to drive the lane if neither was
open. Luckily, he found Harwood
open on the right wing. Harwood
calmly drained the Wildcats’ sec-
ond three-pointer of the game to
set off a wild celebration.

“Lately, toward the end of
games this year,” Harwood said,
“things have kind of fallen apart on
us. Things haven’t really gone our
way. I think it was time for things
to go our way. It was good to see
things go our way.” “I told the
guys that winning by 15 or 20
points would have been great,”
McKillop said, “but this is just
fantastic.”

The victory followed a loss
earlier in the week to Tennessee-
Chattanooga.

When you lose three in a row
and you haven’t done that for two
years. . . boy, this is a big win,”
McKillop said.

Williams rebounded from a
scoreless performance against
UTC, the first time since his fresh-
man year that he had not scored in
a game, to drain in 20 points, as did
Harwood.

“We were so close to breaking
this game open so many times,”
McKillop said: “The guys just
wanted to win so bad.”

In fact, the Wildcats hadn’t
won in Boone for several years.
But with the three-game losing
streak to snap, that situation wasn’t
the team’s biggest concern. "We
just wanted to go in there and win,”
Harwood said. “We had lost three
in.arow. We just wanted to win.”
