DR. BYERS LEADS SUNDAY
NIGHT “Y” SERVICE

The All-Sufficient Christ is Subject
of His Talk.

Dr. FE. A. Byers, professor of

|cient martyrs, the founders of our
I faith.

The futility of material or scien-
tific success in bringing peace has
‘heen shown by the late [European
war. It is “Christ alone that can es-
tablish a brotherhood of man.”

| His last point was our duty as true

ance. Only those who are here and

do not come out hurt their hall’s
record. What will be the report
next Sunday? That depends on you.

The discussion of Buddhism will
be continued in next Sunday’s
classes.

for gain, and still others for knowl-

ed to be futile, and that Christ alone
can satisfy. .

Not only our bodily needs, but
those of the soul are fulfilled by the
Spirit of Christ.

Dr. Byers stated that the exist-:

ance of God cannot be
philosophy or science. “God must
be believed with the heart, not com-
prehended with the mind.”

Our Christian lives should be
based on stern conviction that can
withstand hardships. In bringing
out this thought, he pointed out the

resonable temperature with an

article, the cost and scarcity of

sidered in any system of heating.
The air draught comes up under the
coal pit and makes it very easy to
get a good fire started in a short
time.

Many of these advantages could

these are the most economical and
endurable that will serve the pur-
‘pose and last indefinitely, if proper
care is taken of them.
