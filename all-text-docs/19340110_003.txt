Williams Attends
Philadelpha Meet

Business Professor Goes to Eco-
nomic Convention

Prof. John P. Williams, ‘of the busi-
ness department and dean of the fresh-
men, attended the convention of the
American Economic Association, held
in Philadelphia from December 27 to
29. Also meeting with the Economic
Association was the American Polit-

—ieal Science Association,

Around five thousand members at-
tended the meeting which was held to
discuss current political and economic
problems.

Due to the widespread interest in
the subjects discussed, Professor Wil-
liams says that the meeting was quite
long and controversial. Perhaps the
most debated question, says Professor
Williams, was that concerning cur-
rency and the gold standard. He states
that the meeting proved interesting
and helpful to those attending.

On his return, Professor Williams
stopped in Washington and Richmond,
where he visited points of interest.

“Uncle Jule” Recalls
Davidson of the Past

One day- recently this réporter spent
one of the most enjoyable afternoons
since coming to school, merely sitting
on one of “Uncle Jule’s hack-blocks”
down in the school workshop, and. lis-
tening. Occasionally encouraged by 1
question or a suggestion, Davidson's
“grand old man of the campus,” Julius
Everett pushed back the
veil of the years and pausing here and
there to chuckle reminiscentl}¥, drew
from his memory many incidents con-
nected with the Davidson campu§ of
yesteryear. a

Torrence,

Grey and slightly stooped, Mr. Tor-
tence for the past twenty-six years
has watched the college “grow up”
from the door of his little workshop
down beside the Students’ Store. Not
only has he watched it grow from in-
fancy but, furthermore, his steady and
meticulous work in the shop through-
out the years has contributed no small
amount to its growth.

Born in Iredell County, April 6,
1807, he is now sixty-six years old and
still working as hard as he did twenty

years ago,

His only venture out of the State
was a trip down to Rock Hill, S. C,
“The trip
was swell, but home looked mighty
good” when he got back. He distinct-
ly remembers Dr. Henry Louis Smith,
Dr. Martin, Dr. Ben Lacy, and Wil-
liam Sayd, who is now a noted physi-
cian in Florida. He kept the residence
of Dr. J. B. Shearer repaired when
he lived in the old building known as
Louisiana. :

to visit one of his sons.

Turning to the humorous side of the
college, he recounted tale after tale

ing was hazing.” One incident that
he particularly remembers was the
night that a few pleasure-seeking up-
perclassmen divested a bunch of fresh-
men of their garments and then ap-
plied a thick coating of black, oozy
tar. The poor little “freshies’ came
running by his door, entirely, in the
nude, and headed for the pond that lay
alongside the old gulley road, where
they stayed the remainder of the night.

Another anecdote was of Dr. Hard-
ing’s buggy which was stolen by some
students and hung by the shafts high
on the bannisters above the second
floor of the old Chambers Building.

These and many other tales were
told by the old man who has mended,
and built this college to which he is
so attached.

Commenting on the student body as
a whole, he said that “the college and
the boys themselves are the finest
there is” and added seriously “and I
like Roosevelt just fine.”

Prof. Currie Speaks to
Debaters on Forensics

Prof. Archibald Currie, Professor of
Political Science, addressed Alpha Phi
Epsilon, national honorary debating
fraternity, at its second meeting of the
year held on December 13.

The meeting was well attended by
faculty members as well as students,
including old members as well as new-
ly-elected students, who will be ini-
tiated at the next meeting,

The society chose as its aim “The
Promotion of Forensics on the David-
son Campus.” It expects to sponsor
oratorical contests from time to time.
A program committee was chosen, con-
sisting of R. W. Pratt-Thomas, R. H.
Smith, and R. A. Banks,

Professor Currie spoke on the place
of forensics in the world of today,
taking various phases of modern life
and showing the increasing need of
speaking ability. He outlined the dif-
ferent types of speeches, presenting
the use of each. es

The society plans to promote ex-
temporaneous speaking during the
year,

A new system of debating at Georgia
Tech, that of open forum discussions,
has heightened interest in debating and
increased attendance at debates.

Eu Society Addressed
By Mexican Authority

“Art and Crafts of Mexico” was
the subject of a talk presented at the
Eumenean Literary Society Tuesday
night by Hervey Ross, formerly an
American inhabitant of Mexico, Com-
pleting the program, Ed Hodge spoke
on a phase of science and R. T. Banks
read a humorous paper.

Ross dicussed the peculiarities of
each province and illustrated his lec-
ture with several native examples of
his own, “The gentle craft of shoot-
ing presidents,” said Ross, “is perhaps
the most polished art that Mexico can
boast of.”

of several rare gases and particularly
the work of Sir William Ramsey, Lord
Raleigh and William Travers in that
line,

An original work, “My Rambling
Recreations,” was presented by Rich-
ard Banks.

the-minute study of Germany that we
have.”

Ettinghofer, is said to be a more ef-
fective war novel even than “All
Quiet.” The thought of the title is:
“The Uniform Creates Dividends.”

seit dem Weltkriege is an anthology
of some of the most significant prose
Written since the World War.

Fallada, is a“ depression” novel which
became a best seller over night in
America, Professor Vowles has a let-
ter from the author, written in re-
sponse to an inquiry about the name
Fallada, in which a curious and inter-
esting fact comes to light. Hans Fal-
lada writes that thirteen years ago he
assumed the pen name Fallada to pre-
vent his father, a government official,
opposed to his son’s* “ scribbling,” from
knowing that he was writing. How-
ever, his father. found out about it
within three months. The author as-
sumed the name, as he says, of a faith-
ful white horse in one of his favorite
fairy tales, the “Goose Girl” by the
Grimm brothers, In the story the
name is spelled Falada. The accent is
on the first syllable.
