Y’s
CORNER

By SHAW SMITH

There is certainly enough, to oc-
cupy one’s mind these days, Besides
the unfortunate JAPS to corner. our

minds, we find reviews, Christmas

program next Sunday, Red and
Black Masques production next
Tuesday, the regular scheduled

athletic events along with the in-
evitable numerous extra-curricular
activities of a campus, and maybe
a bit of studying squeezed in—if we
can afford to’ cut the radio down.
The nearing Christmas vacation cre-
ates activity like this. Yes, Christ-
mas and all the fuss and brother
—yet satisfaction of gift giving.
And incidently, we celebrate Christ's
Birthday with it. But this will be
a different Christmas for all.
No one needs to be reminded that
war is death—and we are at war.
The-real-significance-of Christmas
will be inescapable for us who are
at all thoughtful. that
