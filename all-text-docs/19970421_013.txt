Will’s World
Asking nicely

By WILL BRADSHAW
Sports Editor

In this week’s opinion page, I
published a response to two articles
written last week by Wes Roach and
David Kaul. In that article, I alluded
to many thought-provoking conver-
sations I have had this week about
the purpose of this sports section.

If Roach and Kaul were hoping
to change the way sports were cov-
ered by the Davidsonian, then they

have failed, because their anger kept |’

me from considering their views. But
they weren’t the only voices { heard
in the past week, and these other, less
angry and more thoughtful comments
have gotten me thinking.

What I have heard from many
people is that a college paper should
favor its athletic programs, and that
Davidsonian coverage has been un-
duly negative in the past.

Maybe the sports section has
swung too far towards the style of
major sports papers. We are not the
Chicago Tribune or the New York
Times, and while striving for that
excellence in the other sections, writ-
ing with that indifference may be
damaging to sports coverage here.

We are a small college paper.
Our sports page contains the only
coverage our athletes will receive in
many cases, and the most compre-
hensive coverage in all cases. And,
by virtue of our peer relationship to
the athletes, we do have to take some
responsibility for their feelings.

These conversations have re-
convinced me that the Davidsonian
sports page needs to strike a balance
between indifferent reporting and
serving as sensationalist propaganda
for our sports teams.

But why did it take me five
separate conversations to come to
this conclusion when I should have
been able to read the enlightening
pieces written by Roach and Kaul
and reach the same conclusion last
Monday?

It is a lesson in approach,

Kaul and Roach buried what-
ever points they were making in their
anger. In our anger we missed those
points entirely.

‘In an unrelated event, Tripp
Franklin left me and Mike a voice
mail, informing us that the track meet
at Duke two weekends ago was not
scored. We had reported that
Davidson did not score a point, some-
thing that was true, but no other team
scored a point either.

In that voice mail, Franklin
didn’t attack us personally or make
disparaging remarks about our page.
He simply told us that we had been
misinformed, and asked us to be more
careful in the future.

The tone of his call invited us to
listen and elicited the correction in
this week’s issue. We were not im-
mediately on the defensive, and we
were not meeting anger with anger in
responding to his voice mail.

Franklin was more effective in
a thirty-second voice mail than Kaul
and Roach were in writing two ar-
ticles last week because he calmly
informed us about something we
needed to know. We promptly cor-
rected our mistake.

Next year, the new sports edi-
tors will have little orno Davidsonian
experience. They are going to make
mistakes, and even if they don’t,
something will be said that upsets
someone. If you are that someone,
then I suggest learning from the ap-
proach that Franklin took (and has
taken in the past) in dealing with us.

You just might be amazed with

the results.

Men’s tennis finishes secon

One point, controversial call keep Wildcats from title

By Jay CANTRELL
Staff Writer

The Covington Tennis Courts
were rocking this weekend as
Davidson College hosted the most
exciting Southern Conference
men’s tennis tournament in years.
When the dust settled, the Wildcats
finished in a tie for second place
with East Tennessee St., just one
point behind Furman University.

The three teams were knotted
at 60 with only two doubles matches
left on the court. Both went into
tiebreakers, with Furman’s No. 1
doubles team of Sam.Schroerlucke
and Adam Abney defeating ETSU
9-8 (7-4) just minutes before
Davidson’s top team of Ted Kaplan
and Judson Sutherland lost 9-8 (7-
5) to Tennessee-Chattanooga.

Earlier in the day, Schroerlucke
upset Davidson’s Jon Pastel 3-6, 6-
4, 6-3 to win the first flight singles
championship. Pastel, co-captain
and last year’s Southern Confer-
ence Player of the Year, had trouble
handling Schroerlucke’s big serve
and slice backhands. It was his first
league loss in over two years.

Pastel had beaten him 7-5, 6-3
earlier in the season. “I don’t think
he really changed anything,” Pastel
said. “Maybe I was a little overcon-
fident.

“T've got to give him some
credit. His slices stayed low and in
the third set he really didn’t miss.”

“Sam played a great match,”
said Davidson coach Jeff Frank.
“He was absolutely relentless. I
think he played as well as he is
capable of playing.”

Schoerlucke’s win, coupled
with the doubles championship,
earned him the Most Outstanding
Player Award and gave the Pala-
dins their first championship since
1993. ;

That left the home team disap-
pointed despite an incredible sea-
son. Aftera3-8 start, the men served
up 11 straight victories on their way
toa 7-0 conference record that gave
them the regular season champion-
ship.

Co-captains Jon Pastel and Jeff
Tonidandel helped the turnaround
by calling a team meeting follow-
ing a tough loss March 20 at

Pastel lunges for a volley this weekend at the conference tourney. He finished second in No. 1 singles
and won the No. 2 doubles title with Scott Briggs to help the Wildcats to second overall.

Winthrop.

“After that,” Pastel said, “Ev-
eryone started practicing a little
harder. It was like we started a whole
new season.”

“T never thought we could do
what we did this year,” said Frank.
“If ever a team overachieved, it’s
probably this team. We had three
guys who weren’teven inthe lineup
last year.”

That trio included sophomore
Eric Bourn and freshmen Brett
Talacci and Alex Okulski. Bourn
moved up to the No. 5 slot this

season and finished fifth in the tour-

nament. Meanwhile, Ialacci and
Okulski were busy winning South-
ern Conference crowns at the three
and six seeds, respectively.

Davidson also won two cham-
pionships in doubles. Pastel and
Scott Briggs won the second flight
with an 8-6 victory over
Chattanooga’s Genius Chidzikwe
and Jordan Goetzman.

In the third flight, Tyler Epp
and Tonidandel teamed up to beat
ETSU’s Ignacio Perez and Matt
Keeter 8-3.

The Wildcats’ No. 1 doubles
team of Kaplan and Sutherland suf-
fered from a questionable call in
their semifinal match and had to
settle for fourth place after a loss to
Chattanooga in Sunday’s final bout.

Kaplan and Sutherland ap-
peared to have won the match when
Furman’s Schroerlucke hit an er-
rant second serve. Both Davidson
players called the ball out and ap-
proached the net to shake hands, but '
Furman made an appeal to a roam-

. ing umpire who corrected the call

from the other side of the court.
“Everyone who saw it thought
it was two or three inches out,” said
Pastel. “It’s just a bad call. Thos:
things happen.” :
The Paladins went on to win
that-game and the next two to take
the match 9-7 and earn the crucial

two points awarded for semifinal
victories.

“Tf that line call goes our way,”
said Frank, “we have three doubles
teams in the finals.” And doubles is
where the Wildcats have thrived all
year.

They won the doubles point in
each oftheir 1 1 straight wins, mean-
ing they took at least two out of the
three matches in each contest.

Going into the final round of
doubles on Sunday, Davidson
needed all three doubles wins to
ensure at least a tie for the title.
Instead, Furman won all three of its
battles, including head-to-head vic-
tories over Davidson and ETSU to
leapfrog into first.

The Wildcats may have lost
the team championship, but they
earned four individual titles, more
than any other school. Also, Frank
was awarded conference Coach of

Women’s tennis claims

By JAY CANTRELL

The women’s tennis team fin-
ished fourth in the Southern Con-
ference tournament this weekend in
Greenville, S.C.

The Wildcats were led by all-
conference selection Dana Casner
and the sixth singles flight cham-
pion Lynne Shore.

Casner, last year’s league
Freshman of the Year, won her third-
place match 6-3, 7-5 over Courtney
Hague of Marshall in the No. 1
flight. She was selected to the All-
Conference team for the second year
in a row.

Shore won a dramatic finale
against Erin Russell of Marshall 6-
1, 2-6, 7-6 (8-6). The junior co-
captain from Charlotte upset Jenni-
fer Connell of Furman University
6-1, 6-0 in the semifinal on Satur-
day.

Last year’s number six singles
champion, Claire Cheatwood, fin-
ished third this year in the fifth
flight. The sophomore from
Fayetteville defeated Angie Bailey
of East Tennessee St. 6-4, 6-2 on
Sunday. ~
In the number three flight,
Ashley Maner capped off her
Davidson career with a fourth-place
finish and was awarded the Sports-

fourth in conference

manship Award for the second time.
She also won the award, which is
voted on by the coaches, in her
sophomore year.

Maner and her partner, Creecy
Chandler, finished sixth at No. 3
doubles.

In the second doubles flight,
Cheatwood teamed up with sopho- *
more Clara Marks to finish in fifth
place with an 8-2 victory over Geor-
gia Southern’s team of Vivian
Scarborough and Melissa Brown.

Marks also finished fourth in
the number four flight following a
6-3, 6-2 loss to Beth Henry of UTC. °

The number one doubles team

of Casner and Amber Bradford came

in third with an 8-6 win over
Marshall’s Hague and Alyssa
Bengel. Bradford, the Wildcats’ No.
2 singles player, had to settle for
fourth place in her flight after a 7-6,
6-7, 7-5 loss to Ashley Phillips of
Furman.

Head coach Caroline Price, last
year’s conference Coach of the
Year, will return all but one starter
for next season, when the Wildcats
hope to improve‘ on this year’s
fourth-place finish.

Editor’s note: The Davidsonian
was unable to reach Coach Price or
any members of the women’s tennis
team. Expanded coverage will fol-
low next week.
