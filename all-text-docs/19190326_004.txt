With Our Alumni

Sam Keesler Awarded

D. S. C. Posthumously

Story of His Last Flight.

Upon the recommendation of Capt.
Harry ‘TV. ‘Todd, commanding headquar-
ters 24th aero squadron, first army ob-
servation group, a Distinguished Service
Cross will be posthumously awarded
Lieut. Sam R. Keesler, °17, of Green-
woud, Miss., who fell ina fierce air con-
test mortally wounded within the Ger-
min lines, October 8, 1918.

‘The story of Lieutenant Keesler’s grit-
ty fight after he had been wounded sev-
eral times through his body, and of his
later tragic death, is related in a letter to
Gen. S. R. Keesler, his father, by Ut. HL.
W. Riley, who accompanied: him in the
ight when they encountered the Ger-
man planes:

“In the late afternoon of the 8th of
October, 1918, Licutenant Keesler and
myself were on a mission east of Verdun.
Shortly after we crossed the tines and
just before we had covered the assigned
territory, four Fokkers came from the
French side of the line and attacked us.
loam certain Lieutenant Faison shot
down the leader as he attacked first, and
1 saw him go down ina deep nose drive.
The other three E. A. opened fire im-
mediately and crippled one aileron, shot
away my cudder controls and part of my
elevators. Lieutenant Keesler fired: all
the way down and after we crashed, al-
though he had been shot three — times
through the chest and three — times
through the abdomen. ‘The three Huns
lungs over usait a low altitude and kept
firing at us after we were clear of the
wreck, Lieutenant Keesler was hit in
the hip before we could get, under cover.
From 5215 until 12 o'clock that night,
when we reached a dressing — station,
Lieutenant Keesler received no medical
attention and although he nust have sul-
fered terribly, he showed wonderful sel f-
control and won the admiration of all
the German soldiers who came to look at
him. Lieutenant Keesler died the fol-
lowing noon.”

This wonderful heroism ts not to his
Davidson admirers a surprise. We who
have witaessed Sam on the athletic field,
in the dormitories, and in the class room,
look upon this as a thing that could only
be natural with him, arid a thing that we
have .rather expected to hear when the
more complete news of his death should
come in. “The courage that is displayed
under trying Circumstances is but a reve-
lation of the true man at all times, And,
for this reason, Davidson friends are
proud indeed to hear of this honor to one
whom they have always known as a
hero, one whose memory is a point of
pride. :

INTERESTING LETTER
FROM W. C, NEEL, EX-'19

The following letter has been received
from W. C. Neel, ex-'r9, telling of some
of the points of historic interest — in
France which he has recently visited :

Aix-les-Bains, France,
January 19, 1919.
Here is a place that I never heard

AS SPRING APPROACHES.
I wish T was a little rack
A sittin’ on a hill
A doing nothing all day long
But just a sittin’ still.
T wouldn’t eat, 1 wouldn't sleep,
I woulda’t even wash;
But sit and sit a thousand years
And rest myself, by gosh.

first quota fram our division came here
on a seven-day leave of absence. But 1
have found out a geod deal about the
place within the last three days, enough
that [| shall not forget it soon. “The
place is evidently a favorite summer
resort fur tourists, “There are about 75
hotels, some of them quite magnificent.

other time was at the Hotel McAlpine,
in New York City. .

‘the-Y. ML. C. A. is occupying the
finest building in) town, the Casino.
‘Yhere is some sort of entertainment go-
ing on here: throughout the day and un-
til midnight. “The army chaplain’ sta-
tioned here preached an excellent sermon
this morning. But there is such a dif-
ference in the crowd that attends relig-
ious services and the one that turns gut
for movies and vaudeville. ‘Phat made
the sixth time that 1 have been present
at the theater and every other time the
house was packed. “There are three bal-
conies and this morning at the service
the ground Moor was just about — half
filled.

‘There are several trips to places of
interest in or near the town, to which
“Y" mena lead parti¢s. | have caken two
such trips. “Phe first was about two
miles out over old Roman roads to an
old castle, designated as the “haunted
castle.” “‘Vhence we proceeded a mile
farther on to the “Gorges.” “This gorge
is 100 feet and 300 yards long. “Phere
is also an old saw mill located there.

The next trip was to the historic
points of the old city of Aix here in the
town. We first visited an old Gothic
stairway built in the sixteenth century.
‘Then nearby is the old temple erected to
Diana in 123 B.C. The museum is in
this building and contains some very
rood paintings together with quite a
collection of stores dug up in excavations
about the city. Nearby stands an old
Roman arch built 200 years after the
temple. the arch is of stone and appa-
rently has not budged an inch. Thea
we were taken to the old Roman public
baths built in 125 B.C. This is a pe-
culiar looking bath house and contains
a pool which is the oldest one that there
is any record of. Originally there were
seven streams of warm water issuing
from the foot of the mountains, In
1865 some Etalian engineers decided to
try and locate the source of these streams.
They tunnelled about 300 feet under-
ground and located the source. Now
there is a well or basin from which issues
one stream which is conveyed to the
present public bath building and sep-
arated into sulphur and alum waters.
‘This water is, of course, claimed to have
great curative value. I took a bath in
the water just as it comes from the
mountain. Wilton C. Neel,
