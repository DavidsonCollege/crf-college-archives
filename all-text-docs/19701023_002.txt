Spencer responded;
trustees have the responsibil-
ity to decide future arrange-
ments for students to come.”

Lyman Parrigin warned
about moving too fast: “If
you do away with fraternities
now, it will be very difficult
to establish them later if it
turns out that they are worth-
while, The reason the system
has not_worked is that there
has been no acceptable al
ternative to being a frater-
nity member.”

Parrigin expressed his
feeling that the student gov-
ernment was not represent-
ative of student opinion and
the group agreed wholeheart-
edly. He added that elections
were based on trival ‘mat.
ters rather than issues which
provoke significant opinion
or debate.

The medical records pro-
blem at the, Davidson College
infirmary was resolved, to
the apparent satisfaction of
all concerned, in a meeting
held on Oct. 14, between Pre-
sident Samuel R. Spencer Jr.,
Dean of Students Richard C.
Burts, and Dr. William C.
Davis Jr. e

THE DAVIDSONIAN has
received a statement from
the office of Dean Burts on
the outcome of this_meeting.

According to. this state-
ment, Burt& has directed
that, in the future, the daily
records of the infirmary be
typed “by a secretary out-
side the Dean’s office and
returned directly to the in-
firmary.”

“On a_ weekly basis, or
more frequently if emergency
conditions prevail,’ Burts
Said in’ the statement, ‘‘the
college physician will give an
impersonal statistical report
analyzing the types of ser-
vices which the infirmary has
rendered.”

their lives and want to know
why, he said.

The majority of visits are
made by upperclassmen, be-
cause ‘‘upperclassmen feel
more accutely the pressure
of being individuals. They
are preparing to enter grad-
uate school or to start a job.
Same seem to have trouble
finding the security they need
within themselves.”

Hall said he can recognize

a definite trend towards
“‘more involvement” among
younger people. The college

campus in general is more

concerned with social and

political issues.”

He feels this is reflected
on the individual level. Stu-
dents are examining their
own lives and when they find
something wrong they often
need professional help to
cope with it.

said in an interview, will not
include names of. students
treated. The Dean’s office
will also receive a daily at-
tendance report from the in-
firmary, but this report will
not include records of treat-
ment.

In the past, there has been
some concern over the hand-
ling of the records. Davis had
said that the traditional
method of handling the réc-
ords was- inconsistent with
medical ethics. Now, said
Davis, the ethiéal conflict
has been completely elimin-
ated. :

Davis had also expressed
concern that’ students with
touchy medical problems,
such as drugs might be
afraid to come to the infirm-
ary for fear of having their
records exposed.

Burts called such fears on
the part of students ground-
less. ‘‘In no case,” said Burts’
statement, ‘“‘have medical
records been used for dis-
ciplinary purposes.” Davis
agreed that such fears were
unfounded.

Burts and Davis also
agreed in saying that it is
necessary for the dean of:
students to have some: sort
of report on medical pro-
blems on campus.

Burts said that under the
new system his response to
medical problems, in. the
form of visiting sick students
or being aware of epidemics,
will be less convenient. But,
he said, he does not think
his function as dean will be
significantly harmed.

He said he felt the conces-
sion worthwhile in order io
relieve students of whatever
fears they might have.

... Celebration Experience

style lighting. And the results,
to say the very least, were
interesting.

The audience, which came
essentially to be entertained,
was fully. involved in spite
of itself and the traditional

Davidson apathy. It is a rare_-

sight indeed to see David-
son students and faculty
members dancing about the
Morrison Room, clapping
their hands and singing, in
essence, celebrating for ‘the
sake of celebration.

Yet there still existed a
void in the enthusiasm. Some-
thing necessary to a true re-
ligious experience was ob-
viously missing. By Ward-
law’s own definition, the ex-
perience was not worship,
for a lot of people did not
find it to be ‘“‘meaningful.”

For all the enthusiasm, all
the soulftil shouts of joy and
all the ebullient smiles and
greetings, the element of
sharing was not there. Joy
is fullfilling only inasmuch
as it is shared with another,
and no provision, was made
in the service for such give-
and-take experiences. —

The individual enthusiasm
was simply that, individual,
wa'elease of energy directed

cause it introduced many in
the ‘community to the new
forms. and experiments in
the worship experience. Al-
so, it gave the normally
staid member of the academ-
is community an excellent
chance to “let his -hair
down.”

And, in the final analysis,
it was ‘a very commendable

attempt ‘at making the
religious experience more
meaningful. Very few who

experienced the celebration
will ever be satisfied ‘again
with the typical church ser-
vice,
