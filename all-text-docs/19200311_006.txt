SPENCE AND McCLURE READ
EXCELLENT PAPERS
BEFORE, POLITY CLUB

Despite the fact that Jupiter Plu-
vius was again a prominent visitor
on the campus as the time of the

ed and a very interesting literary
program, consisting of book reviews,
was carried out. The following re-
views were enjoyed: “The Build-
ers,” by L. G. Calhoun; “Anthon
Hope,” by S. H. Askew, and a boo
review of “Mare Nostrum” by A. D.
McArn. The work that has been
done on the Annual was discussed,
also the work for the remainder of
the year.

but little argument advanced by
either side. The best speech was
made by the first gentleman on the
affirmative. His was very oratorical,
but showed lack of brain power.
Tis runiored that this was his last
speech for it smacked strongly of
the “finis.”

The extemporaenous debate was
between W. C. Smith and J L. Mc-
Keithan on the subject: ‘ “Resolved,
That Davidson should have a com-
mon mess hall.” It is hard to de-
cide which one made the most
“messy” speech, but the negative
side seemed to impress the judges.

T. H. Spence next delivered his
arewell address. His subject was,
“The Davidsonian, et al,” The critic
announced it to be interesting. The
house thought it to be amusing. All
in all this oration was calculated to
bring his speaking career to a glori-
ous conclusion.

Foscue was ushered to the chair
and sworn in by ex-President Cal-
houn. Ina few words he stated his
platform. His main plans were hard-
er work, less bushes, and more earn-
est endeavor by all parties. All the
outgoing officers made a report of
their work while in office, and socie-
ty adjourned.

Eu. Society.

The debate at the Eumenean So-
ciety Saturday night was rather
lively, though the audience was
more guilty of “life” than the speak-
ers. There was little argument pre-
sented by either side, but most of
the speakers used to the full the
many opportunities for witticisms
afforded by the question, “Resolved,
That policemen, firemen, and other
city employes be prohibited by law
from striking.”

The first speaker for the affrm-
ative, Harrell, presented the history
of the question according to all the
rules of “archieology,” but in his re-
buttal, brought down the house by
his witty attack on the negative.
McCutchen and Winter, the next
two speakers on the affirmative, de-
veloped the dangers and losses to
the public which would attend such
a strike and were both heartily ap-
plauded at the long pauses they af-

ected. King, the last speaker of the

amusing.

R. E. McClure made an illustrated
talk on the “Port of Fiume,” in
which he presented the Italian view
in regard to this port. Italy’s main
reasons for wanting this port as
pointed out by the speaker were (1)
that the mountain ranges extending
around Fiume form a natural bar-
rier for Italy; (2) that Fiume is not
the only port which the Jugo-Slavs
could use, and (3) that the majority
of the population of Fiume express-
ed the wish to become a part of
Italy. As this question is right now
before the public eye the audience
was intensely interested in Mr. Mc-
Clure’s discussion,

The program as arranged for
March 9 is as follows: “Turkey,”
A. F. Fricker; “The Political Situ-
ation in Egypt,” J. E. Cassell; and
“Digest of Events,” S. H. Askew.

McKEITHEN WINS
PHI. FRESH-SOPH ‘
DECLAIMER’S MEDAL

The medal, which is given each
year by the Philanthropic literary
Society to the best declaimer in the
Freshman or Sophomore class, was
awarded to J. H. McKeithen. The
contest was very close as was evi-
denced by the fact that the judges
had to cast a second ballot. Mc-
Keithen gave the declamation “Not
Guilty,” which was very interesting
and delivered in true McKeithen
style.

This contest brought to light as
never before the wealth of material
among the newer Phi members. Fol-
lowing is a list of the speakers and
their subjects:

D. W. Lowrance, “Lest We For-
get.”

W. M. McLeod, “The Unknown
Speaker.”

J. F. Clark, “Centralization in the
United States.”

H. R. Poole, “Duty of the South to
the Boy.”

Loyd J. Bray, “Touissant L’Au-
verture.”
