A MERRY DRAMA

In Many Acts and Numberless
Scenes

Act the Seventh

Introducing “The Freshman,” or to speak
campus wise “Fresh,” a verdant member of
'26, who constantly craves information. It
is our resolution that he shall be informed.

Characters: “Mack” Lennox, a rather
prominent senior; he prides\ himself on the
nobbiness of his wardrobe; it is his private
opinion that he is a veritable lady-killer,

“Bill” Carroll, his room-mate and no less
prominent junior; in matter of dress, his
taste is more conservative and substantial;
in regard to his love affairs the old ‘adage,
“Still water runs deep,” is applicable.
