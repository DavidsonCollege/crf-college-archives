College Dormitory Lighting
System Wins Much Comment

New Study Lamps Make Davidson
Best Lighted American
College

GETS WIDE PUBLICITY

Among the countless improvements
made on the Davidson campus and in
the dormitories during the summer, prob-
ably the most outstanding one is the en-
tirely new lighting system which has
been installed throughout the dormitory
rooms and in the administration offices.

There has been placed in every room
one study lamp for the convenience and
aid of all students. The lamps were
constructéd on the indirect lighting prin-
ciple and were procured at great expense
to the college.

The lamps were manufactured by the
Illinois Enginers Society about four
months ago and a patent was secured by
that company. Many companies have
produced these lamps since this time but
they must adhere to the specitications
laid down by the Jilinois Kngineers So-
ciety.

When Davidson College placed order
for these lamps toward the last of July,
the Southern Public Utilities Magazine
published an article naming Davidson as
“the best-lighted American college.”

Grier Martin, alumni then
wrote a story concerning this matter

secretary,

which was accepted by the Associated
Press and appeared in the leading south-
ern newspapers. ;
The National Better Light-Better
Sight Bureau of New York City asked
for pictures of the college buildings and
lest week's issue carried these pictures to-
gether with a complimentary story about
the college. This article states that
“Davidson College, small cultural
school, has set an example to the larger
universities of our country.”

a

“The Electrical Dealers” magazine, a
periodical put into the hands of all the

electrical dealers in. the country, and
published in Chicago, has also asked per-
mission to carry these pictures and

stories in their next issue.

This is indeed an honor that David-
son's action on the important matter of
well-proclaimed

lighting has been

Radios In Dormitories
Are Put On Probation

The Davidson College’ Student Body
met in*regular session today in an at-
tempt to adopt some sort of policy in re-

gard to the keeping and playing of radios
in the dormitories.

At the request of the Faculty that
some definite decision be reached on this
matter, G. H. Brown, President of the
Student Body, called the meeting in an
effort to reach a decision as to how the
playing of radios could bést be prevented
from becoming an annoyance to. stu-
dents wishing to study or have quiet for
other reasons. The Faculty has agreed
to permit the playing of radios for a
probation period of two weeks, the Stu-
dent Council being responsible for keep-
ing the situation under control during
this period, the date of which will be
announced later.

Should the Faculty approve of the
way in which the matter is handled dur-
ing this period, students will probably
be allowed to continue playing radios
under the same regulations as are en-
forced during that period. Should no
satisfactory solution of the problem be
obtained, Faculty action will be taken,

“College life is a period for develop-

“College has verious effects on people.

“Why is it that men associate with the
vagabonds of literature when they may

“A man reaches his full physical de-
velopment at the age of 25,” said Lingle,
“his full mental development at the age
of approximately 45 and his spiritual
development at 60 or more. By making
full use of his environment, such as that
afforded hy a Christian college, he can
more thoroughly develop, himself.”

on the fifth, but Mr. Edmonson, county
superintendent, expressed a desire that
all of Mecklenburg County
should open on the twelfth. The high
school is very fortunate in being able to
add another course to its curriculum. The
course will be physics on even years and
chemistry on odd years. Due to the
lack of sufficient equipment the classes

will be allowed to make use of college

son, Davidson graduate of 1933, has been
secured as instructor in physies and hi-
ology.

The regular forty-five minute periods
current in the high sehool during past
years have been increased to tifty-tive
minutes each, thus making five periods
per day, instead of six. This system will
almost entirely eliminate conflicts with
