Overtime goal gives ’Cats
season opening ma

Davidson opened the season at
Alumni Stadium on Saturday night
when they hosted USC-Upstate (0-
2). At the onset of the match, USC-
Upstate quickly displayed their of-
fensive talent when they scored at
the 1:02 mark of the first half. Nick
Buxton headed the ball off a free
kick into the top left corner of the
goal to give USC-Upstate an early
1-0 advantage.

Alex Caskey ’11 nearly tied the
game at the 27:11 mark on a free
kick that missed just above the post.
However, Caskey continued David-
son’s offensive attacks. At around
the 36 minute mark, he received a
free kick in the box from Charlie
Reiter ’10. Caskey’s initial header
was saved, but he was left with a
simple two yard tap-in to tie the
game at I-1. Despite many close
shots and an aggressive offensive
attack, Davidson and USC-Upstate
went into the half even at 1-1.

After one player received his
second yellow card at the 43:06
mark of the second half, Davidson
gained a 11-10 man advantage, giv-
ing them an opportunity for a pow-
erful offensive attack. With less
than twenty minutes left in the sec-
ond half, Peter Paras ’13 scored a
goal to put Davidson up 2-1. Yan-
nick Pilgrim ’11 sent a drop pass to
Paras who fired the ball into the left
corner of the goal. Paras netted his
first career goal at Davidson and
Pilgrim registered his first assist on
the year.

Another USC-Upstate player
was ejected when he received a red
card at the 79th minute mark, af-
ter taking down Pilgrim in the box
when he was breaking away for an
open shot.

When the match had only a
minute left, it looked like Davidson
would pick up their first match of
the season with a 2-1 win; however,
USC-Upstate would not give up.
USC-Upstate’s Buxton scored his
second goal of the evening, head-
ing-in a free kick. The game ex-
tended into two overtime periods.

During the overtimes, Davidson
kept USC-Upstate’s offense locked
down. Davidson had seven shots
and held Upstate to zero attempts
after regulation. After 105 minutes
of intense play, Davidson sealed the
deal as Mark Millard ’12 kicked a

shot on goal that was blocked.
Clinton Smith ’10 retrieved the re-
bound and passed the ball across
the goal box to an open Reiter who
easily scored to end the match.

The team stressed that the
crowd at Alumni Stadium was cru-
cial to Davidson’s success.

“The crowd was unbelievable”
said Josh Zipin ’11. “The number
of people there and their involve-
ment in the match created one of
the best atmospheres I have been
apart of since I have been here”.
“The team is feeling great and is
ready to move toward more wins,”
Reiter said. “We have great team
chemistry this season that will help
us through the year like it did last
night”.

Davidson improves to 1-0 on
the season and will face off in
the Adidas Classic against UNC-
Asheville at 7 p.m. on Friday.
