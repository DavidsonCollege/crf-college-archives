CATS HIT WIN COLUMN

After six weeks 6f fruitless campaigning, the Cats. finally
hit the victory trail last week against The Citadel, a team that
has likewise had a meager year, and a team that is in David-
son’s class. Against stronger rivals the Wildcats have shown
flashes and have showed plenty of fight, but it remained for
a rainy, cold day to bring out their latent abilities against
the Cadets. Presenting a team that clicked at intervals to score
two six-pointers, the Charleston boys were beaten by a David-
son team that showed its power and ability against an evenly
matched opponent. , The line had those holes open, and Sharpe
ran better than he has done all season. Jay Bolin, too, showed
power through the line, as did the other backs, who showed
that they could go if given half a chance.

This- week-end. brings..the present season well _to-
ward the end, with Carolina, Erskine, and Wake Forest
booked. Football followers already predict two losses
there, as Davidson meets the high-flying Tar Heels and
Wake Forest’s powerful: offense. Erskine should be a-Dav-
idson day again this year. Carolina will present such bril-

liant stars as Stirnweiss and Lalanne, who have led the
way to an undefeated season thus far, and a last minute
stand against Tulane that brought a tie. The Tar Heels

‘are, and have been, looking forward to Nov:-18,-when-they—

meet the Duke Blue Devils in the decisive Conference

game, and will enter the field Saturday as a dress rehearsal
for this bout. However, last year the Tar Heels were
good, too, and it took them a mighty long time to get colt
as Davidson monopolized play during the first half, Then
reserve power turned the tables, as it has done before, and
U. N. C. forged ahead. This week the Cats know what
they are up against, and are out again to play against a
heavier, larger squad, a team that ranks as one of the
powers in the South, and a team that has yet to be beaten.
A wild dreamer would hardly say that Davidson will beat
the Heels, but fans can expect the usual variety of fight
_and hard play right up to the finish at Winston-Salem,

nd while Carolina is expected to win, they will have to
Play ball to do so, and can not be content to sit on her
laurels of the past, if they want to beat the Wildcats, who
will shoot the works all the way.

INTRAMURAL BASKETBALL STARTS

Touch football came to an end last week after an interesting
and tightly contested season, Some complaints were heard
about the rapidity with which-the round-robin affair was_run
ofl, as many teams played as many as four games in a row on
successive days. However we believe: that this will be oftset
by the fact that the dormitory and fraternity basketball games
will-be-played-in-the atternoons, and that there’will be plenty
of time tor the games tobe run off, at least up until the very
end’ot the season, Last year, and in previous years, there has
been a grand mix-up as intramural teams played at night after
the varsity and frosh stopped practice. Handicapped by lack of
adequate floor space in the small gym, the winter intramural
program has always been a weak point. This year however,
most of the games will be played during the remainder of the
football season When the court will be relatively vacant, Be-
cause of this, interest in basketball as an intramural sport
should be heightened, and more benetit should be derived from
it’ by all contestants.

But this still leaves a question as to:what sort of intra-
mural activities will go on during the dead of winter,
when outdoor games are necessarily few and far between,
and when the basketball teams will be using the gym regu-
larly. Batminton and wrestling offer only temporary re-
spite. After they are over, or until they are run off, what
will be offered to the students? Coach Whittle has done a
fine job with the meager facilities available, but the main
need is still a new gym. both for the varsity, freshmen, and
intramural teams. Building funds are always slow to ma-
terialize, but it is our hope that before many years a new
and larger gymnasium will take the place of the present
outdated and cramped one.
