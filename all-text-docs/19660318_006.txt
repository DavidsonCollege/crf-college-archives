Should the powers that be here at Davidson
ever decide that a few horticulture courses are
needed to boost the curriculum, the right man for
the job would be none other than Dean Frontis
Johnston.

While outwardly assuming the role of dean of
the faculty, Johnston has been surreptitiously
transforming himself into a botanist of no mean
talent. Whether this is to train himself for a pro-
fessorship in the aforementioned horticulture de-
partment, or to have something to fall back on
when he retires is not known.

At any rate, as soon as THE DAVIDSONIAN
learned of Dean Johnston’s sub rosa activities, it
immediately demanded an interview with the dean
on this earthy subject. ;

The dean claims that he first became inter-
ested in growing boxwoods and azaleas about five
or six years ago and camellias about three years
ago. Since then he has.rooted so many plants that
both his green-houses are overflowing. He esti-
mates his total worth in greenery at about 1,500-
2,000 plants with many varieties. ;

Johnston built his first greenhouse entirely
by himself. About 300 square feet, it soon proved
inadequate for his needs, and he was forced to
branch out into another larger greenhouse which
he built from pre-fabricated sections. .

With all of this equipment he was in a posi-
tion to really experiment with his plants. Having

Dean Johnston Moves
Into Horticulture Field

THE DAVIDSONIAN

taught himself the basics of rooting and culture,
he attacked the thornier problems of grafting and
improving his blooms.

This latter he does, at times, by adding to
his blooms giberilic acid, a relatively new chemi-
cal which sometimes greatly increases the size of
a bloom or plant (what do you think changed the
Jolly Green Giant from an asparagus to a herba-
ceous Paul Bunyan? By this method he has pro-
duced such interesting results as camellia blooms
seven inches in diameter.

Now that Johnston has mastered the art of
horticulture he finds himself with an overflow
of blooms of all types—mainly camellias. As a
result, he is all too happy to give away all anyone
may want; in fact, he would be relieved if some-
one would take some off his hands.

This presents a perfect opportunity for house-
mothers to install a little beauty in the houses dur-
ing these dreary days, and for students to impress
their dates with a beautiful, but free, camellia
corsage.

Johnston has no certain plans for his green-
house ventures in‘the future, but he may enter
a show or two this spring. THE DAVIDSONIAN
wishes him good luck in his future horticultural
activities but hopes it is a long time before he
leaves his post in the administration department
for greener pastures.

A series of vocational guid

be administered Tuesday at 4
p.m, in the basement of Cham-

The tests are whe same as
| those which in past years have
' been given only to seniors, ac-
cording to Dr. W. B. Hight, di-
rector of the Student Counseling
Service.

| Those sophomores who desire
.to take the tests must sign up
in Hight's office. There will be
‘no charge for the tests, which
‘would cost around $200 if taken
commercially.

The total of seven tests in-

to be self-administered, one each

tests include three interest tests
and two personality tests.

This battery of tests began as
a guide for student placement,
but-the program enlarged—when
seniors who were not going
through placement asked to take
the tests.

Last year Hight tested sev-
eral sophomores to see if the
testing program would be worth-
while. The results proved suc-
cessful, so this year the tests
will be made available to all
sophomores.

Full Financial Picture

Expenditures for weekends
and for events sponsored joint-

‘lly with the College Union have

accounted for the major part of
approximately $19,300 spent so

% | far this year by the Social Coun-

cil.

Figures released by Irv Well-
ing, treasurer of the Social Coun-
cil, showed $16,256 spent on
weekends and $2,256 spent on
events sponsored jointly with
the Union.

Welling told THE DAVIDSON.
IAN that he believes ‘“‘the money
has been well spent.” “It is
hard to realize all the problems

‘fand all the details involved in

putting on a year's social ac-

. tivities,” Welling continued.

As examples of other expen-
ditures necessary during the
year, Welling listed administra-
tive expenses (stationery, post-
age, etc.), $50; telephone, $193;
printing, $165; Quips and Cranks.
$90: and expenses of members
of the Social Council attending
the area booking convention,
$177.

“Davidson books entertain-
ment at. rock-battom prices,
lower than the prices for the
same entertainment at other
area schools due to the influ-
ence of C. Shaw Smith, director
of the Student Union,” Welling
said.

“Mr. Smith knows many
agents and is able to get about
‘he best. available deals,’’ Well-
ing continued. °

In the category of major
weekends, the Social Council
spent $3,608 on Homecoming ac-
tivities and $4,373 on Midwin-
ters.

Concert weekends, with such

entertainment as the Four Preps
and Peter Nero, accounted for
approximately $6,000 of the So-
cial Council's expenditures.

An additional $2,557 was spent
on minor weekends of combo
parties, refreshments, etc.

Behind the actual entertain-
ment for each weekend are
many other expenses such as
labor (running spotlights, set-
ting up stages, etc.), refresh-
ments, security police and pub-
licity.

The Social Council's financial
standing for the remainder of
the year 4s excellent, according
to Welling.
