Inadequate Evaluation Of
Appears As Flaw In Tenure System

By PHILLIP BISHOP
Contributing Editor

porated into the tenure system
at Davidson?

Often none at all, answered
several professors in interviews
this week.

**Personally, I feel there was
very little effort to evaluate me
when I became eligible for ten-
ure,” said one professor.

Another admitted, *‘For years
at Davidson, as long as a pro-
fessor kept quiet and went to
church, he would be awarded
tenure.”

A third added, ‘‘Until recently,
a professor had to be outstand-
ingly bad not to achieve tenure.”

Why has Davidson, which
claims faculty
streng point, so neglected the
need to evaluate its professors?

The answer seems to lie in
conflict between faculty and ad-
ministration.

Major responsibility for fac-
ulty evaluation at Davidson lies
with the administration, and the
academic vice president has tra-
ditionally determined the meth-
ods and criteria determining
tenure qualification.

Thus, although the faculty
may take part in the evaluation
process, the mature of the pro-
cedure is controlled by the ad-
ministration; and any effort to
toughen the criteria may meet
with faculty opposition.

The typical faculty attitude
seems to be that of one profes-
sor who said he ‘‘would feel op-
pressed if someone constantly
questioned my work” and he was
wary of systematizing faculty
evaluation.

quality as a

will be that of the Agnes Sen-
telle Brown Award, given to
some upperclassman selected
for his outstanding promise bas-
ed on character, personality, in-
tellectual ability and scholar-
ship.

President of the College Sam-
uel R. Spencer Jr. will also an-
nounce the selections of Omicron
Delta Kappa after the above
awards have been given out.

Other professors, however, feel
an urgent need ‘‘to better artic-
ulate the evaluation process,”
as German Professor Hansford
Epes Jr., said.

“It’s in the self-interest of the
faculty to develop a scheme of
appraising our own competence
and educational interests,” re-
marked Philosophy Professor
Earl MacCormac.

The current “‘scheme of ap-
praisal,”’ as described by Vice
President for Academic Affairs
John M. Bevan, involves a sig-
nificant faculty contribution but
still centers in Bevan’s office.

Bevan said he receives each
spring a report from the depart-
ment chairman on his profes-
sors, including am assessment of
the man’s teaching ability and
a report on his scholarship in
the past year.

In any consideration of con-
tract renewal or tenure, Bevan
includes this report, his own per-
sonal opinion of the new profes-
sor and also any student opinion
he may “hear about,’ Bevan
related.

If the professor is eligible for
tenure, he appears before the
Educational Policy Committee
of the Board of Trustees for a
brief interview, said Bevan.

Tenure is officially awarded
on the administration’s recom-
mendation.

Obviously, such an informal
system has serious drawbacks;
one is what MacCormac called
“‘the enormous power of the ac-
ademic vice president in per-

Speaking specifically of the
conferring of degrees, Spencer
said, “The Convocation offers
an opportunity for all of us to
honor such a man as Walter
Lingle who has meant so much
to Davidson through the years.”

Remarks at the convocation
will be made by degree recip-
ient Lingle. Following this there
will be a luncheon in Chambers
basement at 12:30 p.m.

sonal matters” combined with a
lack of formal intiafaculty eval-
uation,

The present system depends
heavily upon the academic vice
president’s fairness and energy
in assessing faculty perform-
ance, and the failure of past
faculty deans is evident in fac-
ulty criticism of Davidson’s sys-
tem.

The present administration has
improved the evaluation process
by increasing faculty input and
encouraging professional devel-
opment.

“The Hcmors College, the
Woods Hole project and grant
money for individual projects
are just a few of the opportuni-
ties for faculty to broaden their
professional interests,” added
Bevan.

Yet administration influence
in requiting a professor’s con-
tinued development after tenure
is limited. Bevan admitted that
“to gain evidence of academic
incompetence would require the
full cooperation of the faculty.”

Because, as Epes remarked,
“faculty members are in the
best position to evaluate their
colleagues,” the faculty also
must bear a formal responsibil-
ity in the apraisal process.

The lack of such a formal role
has often led tenused professors
“to withdraw into their own iv-
ory towers and never come
out,” according to MacCormac.

Another shortcoming of the
present evaluation ‘system is
