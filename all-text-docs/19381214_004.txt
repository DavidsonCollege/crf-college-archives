I guess most of you have heard the bad or should I say sad news
of Colonel Fred Smith's departusg from Davidson's publicity depart-
ment. Fred really has put Davidson on the map the football team,
even with a none too ressive season, got plenty of publicity through
the time and effort Colonel Fred put forth. Davidson will certainly miss

Intra-mural wrestling tournament drew much interest last week,
but those of you who missed the affair certainly missed a treat.
The highlight of the annual tourney was a bout between two brothers
—Jay and Bill Bolin—-Neither of the two boys conceded the other
a thing and they went at it with one aim in mind—to pin the other.
It seems as Jay (the youngest of the two) had the best of things at
the beginning of the match after he laid Big Brother Bill low with
a neat (almost flying) tackle. Bill, like all other big brothers couldn't
be humiliated by his younger frater and soon things began to sizzle
Bill finally won but only by the slightest of margins. Bring on
more bouts like this one ! ! !
Well it looks like Davidson's varsity
