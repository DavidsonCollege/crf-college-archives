Tuesday, December 13, 1988 THE DAVIDSONIAN

January Chill Chasers _
blow into town next month

Registration for community workshops
will be December 13 from 2-4 p.m. at the
Union ticket office. January Chill Chasers
will begin Monday, January 16 and are
open to Davidson students, faculty and
staff and the greater Lake Norman commu-
nity. From photography to breadbaking,
the workshops provide a good mingling of
town and gown with instructors from both
on- and off-campus. All workshops are free
except where a fee is necessary to cover the
cost of materials. Registration is $1. For
more information call the Union.

The idea for the winter workshop series
originated at the Davidson College Visitors
Center, which is under new management
with coordinator Amy Burkesmith. This
year the Visitors Center has become more
involved than ever in town activities.

The only student-instructed workshop in
the series will be senior Jay Barron’s
Ladspeak: Intro to College Lingo, but 1988
graduate Charles Tambiah will teach ses-
sions on Nature/Wildlife Photography.
Several faculty/staff members are offering
their services. Director of athletics Kit
Morris will teach Beginning Harmonica,
and College Relations news editor Bill
Giduz will sponsor a session on Beginning

Juggling.

John Cunningham, director of Wills and
Trusts, will offer tips on Bike Repair; psy-
chology professor Ed Palmer will give a
Car Haters’ Survival Guide on Basic Car
Maintenance; and Gerald Hutchinson, di-
rector of Davidson Outdoors, will teach
the hands-on course, Massage: Theory
and Practice.

Budding gardeners may learn about the
Principles of Horticulture from grounds
superintendent Irvin Brawley. Music pro-
fessor Yvonne Kendall will teach New
Music with an Eastern Flavor, while
Union program coordinator Ruth Pittard
will cook for her Basic Breadbaking class.
Patty Levering, assistant director of the
Love of Learning program, will talk about
Listening to God from a Quaker’s per-
spective. Bonnie McAlister, coordinator
of the leadership and academic enrich-
ment program and theater/speech lec-
turer, will instruct a class on Conflict
Resolution.

Other workshops include a foot-stomp-
ing clogging class, Missy Kuykendall’s
tips on assertive communication, a story-
telling session and the ‘‘professional’’
opinion on avoiding panic by planning.

Go ona mission from God this weekend in the 900 Room and see The Blues
Brothers, starring John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd and Carrie Fisher. This film
graced our campus as recently as last year, and we ran a really good review
then, but don’t have space this week to do it again. But Tim thought it was
great. Grab them dark sunglasses and be there at 8 p.m. Saturday.
