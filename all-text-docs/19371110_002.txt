Armistice Day...

Tomorrow, Thursday, November LL, boys
and girls, men and women will gather in
schools, colleges, and city auditoriums all
overt our United States to commemorate
thar day. when warring ceased and peace
rested onee more on the earth's torn and
trodden soit.

And bow ironical it all is. The youth of to-
day will have a greater spirit of peace in-
jected into its veins and our chests will
swell with pride as we fairly shout the
glones and blessings of peace.

Then terhaps war will come, and if it
does youth will forget all their causes and
plunge iadiong into a mad orgy o/ what
i8 erroneously termed “patriotisin.”

“A day sueh as Armistice should call for a
greater interest and understanding of the
problems of today, in order that youth may
betier attack and deal with these probleins
tomorrow. The very polieies of our own
United States toward (astern neighbors, as
manifested by President Roosevelt. may
mean tie embroilment of our land in inter-
national conilict. All depends upon the in-
terpretation of that policy.

At any rate, the youth of today should
THINK as it never thought before. It iaees
problems such as have never been faeed be-
fore. The average American boy and girl,
man and woman will (et Armistice Day pass
as just another day, without the least
thought as to its significanee. Shall we be
so blind?

Leader For China...

It has always been a matter of speculation
just what the Chinese peopie. the greatest in
number ‘on the earth’s surfaee, could do
with an cflicient and competent organiza-
tion, China has the resourees, she has all
the potentialities. _—

China needs a leader, a capable, efiicient,
shrewd leader. Chine has had is leaders.
A Spanish triend and great traveler once
told us: “China will never attain the degree
OI organization necessary to establish it as
a deiimite power and threat with a military

. leader. China needs a religious leader. If
China had a man that would appeal to the
country as a whole because of his religious
beliets, that man couid organize China into
the greatest power in the world.”

The statement, whether true or nol, is
most thought provoking. A leader in China

must be able to cast off the cloak of super--

stition and this seems to indicate a man who
will in some way affect the religious ideas
and ideals of the Chinese.

But will this ever come about? Perhaps i in
the far-off future. The Japanese invasiog
in all probability will do more than any
other factor in bringing to the Chinese
people a need for a greater unity.

Lost Laundry...

All too often, announcements of this sort
are read in chapel: “Owner of laundry No.
864 call by room 53 West.’ There must be
something wrong when this occurs repeat-
edly and consistently every week,

So we made a trip to the laundry in an
attempt’ to see just where the fault lay. Mr.
Hamrick proudly displayed the neat wooden
trames, with their numbered sections, in
which laundry is placed when ready for stu-
dents. We teak one look and decided that
the laundry had just about as efficient a
system as we had seen in some time,

Which means only one thing. The fault
lies with the freshmen. How. however,
could any individual be so stupid as to pick ,
up the wrong laundry when filed efficiently
and obviously. Perhaps freshmen just don't
develop a memory tor this sort of ‘thing.
Perhaps they just don’t care enough to take
a second look and make sure the number is
correct. It seems to us that since it is the
ireshman’s lot and one of the few duties im-
posed on the iirst year men to carry laun-
dry, that he try lo show some intelligence in
| the matter and do his job decently. His care-
“lessvess doesitt imerease his stock to any
extent, but only causes a disagrecable in-
convenienee for the upperclassmen whose
i laundry is tnvelved.

i e a
| U. S. ‘Uneducation’. . .
Americans have somehow gained a repu-
tation for wit and “smooth”: handling of
complex topics in a superficial way. As a
group we have been accused of doing much
talking with few taets to support our state-
ments, And today Americans are faced with
many practical problems of seemingty over-
whelming proportions, .
Now Dr. Robert M. Mlutchins, president oi
the University of Chieago, feels he has dis-
covered the reason. Although we have the
inost extensive edueational system in the |
world. President Lluiehins betteves we have
not been taught to chink.
President Hutchins is not alone in his ”
opinion of “uneducated Americans.” but his
. view appears somewhat exaggerated. Aiter
all, there are people who talk, write, and
speak with both knowledge and authority
in the tizid of their special interest.
The pleasant occupation of branding
Ameneans as too ilippaaé in manner, too
casual with their ideas is as unjust as it is
attractive. ir has been notieed that Ameri-
|, cans are constantly inveating new machines
i and bringing forth new suggestions for the |
political, economie, and social benefit of
mankind. There must be a litle thinking
| going on. Even oar fine system of unedu-
cation is valuable if it succeeds in produe-
; ing citigens with critical minds.

liomecoming the greates: week end of
all the year for people. at Davidson —has
come and gone once more. The peace of
the cloistered campus has been restored
again, now that the throng of alummi has
returned to the city.
Everywhere was evidence that the fam-
ons Wildeat spirit is something that gets
, into the blood of every Davidson student.
| Groups of alunii gathered here and there
after the game Saturday aiternoon to sum-
moa up memories of Davidson's victory over
the Tar Hecls irom Chapel [THU back tin
1930 or was it SI? It seems that we just
keep iighting and fighting and hoping that
a time will come again when we will down
Carolina and Duke.

More power to the Davidson Wildcats]
{ We're all right there behind whem, yelling
and righting our own little battle up in the
, Stands as they battle against seemingly un-
surmountable odds out on the tield

' One alumnus told me something Satur-
| day: that gave me an entirely different
slant on the situation. He said, “These
moral victories sound fairly well to you
when you are one of the students, but when
you come bazk to sce a game the one thing
that you're interested in is the score.”

So perhaps the thing that we should dos
ig to plan our Homecoming game for next
year with a team not quite so invincible as
Carolina or Duke. How about Wake Forest ?
The_Demon Deacons have long been the
traditiona} rivals of our Wildcats,.and the
clement of chance for a Davidson victory
would be greatly increased.

“After all, our football players may be
“Men of Might” and “Iron Men,” but there
are a few things that might and iron can-
not overcome.

Letters to the Editor

CONCERNING WORDS
TO “THE RED AND BLACK” ..
Dear sEditor:

May I state, in regard to the two
stanzas entitled “The Red = and
Black,” printed without my prev-
ious knowledge in the last issue of
The Davidsonian, that Mrs. W. P.
Cumming had yothi ing to do With
its composition.” | have requested,
and repeat the request, that my
name be omitted in connection with
its use. Mrs. Cumming and I were
co-authors of the “Centennial Ode,”
which was published last spring.

Kenneth Scott's music is excellent
tor Alma Mater song and supplies
a definite need. 1 do not think that
anything will or should replace the
spirited air of “O Davidson” on the
athletic field; we have all heard
it Sung at umes, however, when the
words and music were incongruous
for"the occasion.

1 hope. that someone will write
words for Scott's imusie which pos-
sess samething more whan the us-
val rather meaningless gencral at-
mosphere of lachrymose nostalgia
which seems to characterize Alma
Maters,

Yours sincerely,
W. P. CUMMING.

AN ANSWER TO
LAST WEEK’S ATTACK
ON ROOSEVELT...
Dear Dick :——

It is evident that the author of
the letter in the last issue of The
Davidsonian which attacked Roost?

| velt’s neutrality pokey had some

doubts as to the solidity oi
ground upon which ke srood.

He scolds President Roosevelt se-
vercly for not putting into force
the 1937 Neutrality Act, and the
aaly reason he can find is that the
President “wishes” to break the
law, and rule by his own whim and
fancy. But may Lgive °'39" a lit-
tle aid in his reasoning.

Admitted that it is a slight ex-
cuse for I, D.-R’s caution that of-
ficially war has not been declared

ithe

by cither Japan or China. But
there is a better«reason for the
President's hesitancy. When the

ij Act was framed, no one suspected

hostilities in East Asia, for we only
had apprehensions as to the future
of Kurope. The Act would have
undoubtedly worked in support of
Great Britain and France against
Germany or Italy, That: was what
