Wildcats Face Hungry Furman Team

By GORDON WIDENHOUSE
Sports Editor

When the Davidson Wildcats
travel to Furman tomorrow for
their encounter with the
Paladins, they will be facing a
team hungry for victory.

In their last two contests, the
Paladins took close defeats at
the hands of two Southern Con-
ference powerhouses, East
Carolina and Richmond.

Against the former, Furman
was able to hold the explosive
running attack of the Pirates in
low gear and allowed the of-
fense two touchdowns for a 14-3
loss.

Last week against the
Spiders, the Paladins ended a
three-game shuteut streak for
their opponents and came
within a hair of upsetting them,
dropping by a score of 20-17.

Needless to say, the Cats did
not fair nearly as well as the
common opponents that they
and the Paladins have en-
countered.

The Furman squad bested
Appalachian by 17-4 and Wof-
ford by 21-19 in addition to the
two previously mentioned
games. Davidson, however lost
to ECU (45-0), Richmond (42-0),
the Mountaineers (24-8) and the
Terriers (23-0).

‘Furman has a really strong
ball club,"’ commented David-
son head coach Dave Fagg.
“They will really be tough on
their home field.”

The Paladins have been suc-
cessful with their offense thus
far this season in compiling a 3-
2 overall won-lost record.

They have put together a
balanced offensive attack
which will be a true test of the
Cats’ defensive ability.

After giving up 492 yards total
offense to ECU last week, in-
cluding over 300 on the ground,
the Davidson squad will be
faced with the necessity to
bounce back before making
trips to William and Mary and
the Air Force Academy in the
two suceeding weeks.

‘Our defense will have to stop
the run better than we did

against ECU,” Fagg stated.

“They just ran all over us.

The Paladins, though, have
gotten 834 net Fards by the rush.
They have a solid backfield
which gives them great ver-
satility on the running plays.

Passing is another strong
point for the Furman club. They
have amassed 602 more yards
through the air. As a team they
are also completing just over 61
percent of their pass attempts.

Defensively they will also
prove to be a problem for the
Cats. The Paladins have been
rather weak on the rush, the
same area in which the Cats
have had their problems of-
fensively.

Against the pass, the Furman
boys have limited their five op-
ponents to only 362 yards for an
average of about 72 yards per
game.

The game will be a must for
the Cats who have dropped thei:
last two contests and four of
their five games. This is the
beginning of a tough five-game
road trip which will end the
season for Davidson.

In last year’s meeting the
Cats were able to prevail over
the Paladins on Richardson
Field”

Fagg Seeks Beginning Of ‘New’ Season

(Ed Note: Recently sports
editor Gordon Widenhouse
talked to head footbali coach
Dave Fagg about the football
team in general and what he
hopes can te accomplished
during the remaining five con-
tests the Wildcats have to play.
Here is his analysis.)

Davidson football is in a bind.
First, it lacks money to
recruit and build a strong major
college program.

Second, the physical size of
the Cats in relation to their op-
ponents puts them at a definite
disadvantage.

Third, the team, limited in

number by administration

policy, suffers greatly from any
injuries it sustains.

Fourth, the team has been
plagued by execution in-
consistency under game cir-
cumstances.

Dave Fagg. head coach of the
Wildcats, is not a man who is
going to give up, even under the
previous circumstances. Some
may call him crazy for this
position, but that would not faze
him to any great extent.

At any rate, Fagg and his
staff are taking the present
situation, which includes a 1-4
record with three tough teams
still on the schedule, into their
own hands with the idea of
playing a five-game season,
beginning with Furman
tomorrow night.

‘‘We have simply had some
mental breakdowns when it
came down to executing the
proper plays under actual game
circumstances,’ explained
Fagg. ‘‘People just failed to
concentrate enough and as a
result the execution just
failed.”’

Upon being asked what he
planned to do to attempt to
correct the situation, Fagg
stated that he would try to

‘simplify the offensive
scheme”’ in hopes of gaining
better performance in the
coming five games.

‘‘We have just lacked the of-
fensive consistency that is
essential to playing winning
football,’’ Fagg said. ‘‘Against
ECU even our defense fell
through under the great
pressure that was placed upon
them.

But the thrust of the problem
the Cats face seems to be the of-

Where the good
things are!

fense. Plagued by a lack of con-
sistency to mount any sort of a
drive, the Cats have given the
ball up and handed their op-
position excellent field position.

‘‘We have not had the
stability to complete a 70-yard
drive,’ Fagg said.

He did have praise for quar-
terback Dave Harper.

‘“T think Harper has done a
good job leading the team,”
Fagg remarked. ‘‘He just has
not gotten the protection he
needed in too many instances.”

But Fagg wants to win and he
is not to be very easily
discouraged into giving up the
rest of the season.

‘‘We want to win and we know
what we have to do,” Fagg
stated. ‘‘We have to come up
with some near-perfect
execution on offense and defen-
se.

Where many would be easily
incited to give up at this point,
Fagg is far from reaching that
status. He summed up the
situation, as far as_ in-
consistency goes by saying that,
‘Sometimes the individual has
to come through. He has to rise
and meet the challenge.”’

When the ‘‘new”’ season star-
ts tomorrow night in Greenville,
the opportunity to rise up will
have arrived.
