Spirit of Blue Ridge
Echoed at Y Service

Price, Patterson and McLeod Give
Impressions of Y. M. C. A.
Summer Conference.

The spirit of Blue Ridge, as it was
expressed in the speeches of McLeod,
Patterson, and Price, seemed to pervade
the atmosphere of the “Y” meeting last
Stnday night.

After opening the meeting by some
songs, a reading of the scriptures, and
prayers by Wooten and Baker, Murdock
McLeod spoke on the thoughts which
were expressed by the lecturers at the
conference. Taking up first the lec-
tures of Dr. Sherwood Eddy, he told
how Dr. Edd} had spoken on the beggar
outside of the beautiful gate of the tem-
ple, drawing a comparison between the
beggar and the college man outside of
God’s gifts. He also lectured on the
Psychology of Sin, using Esau and the
mess of pottage as his example. Mur-
dock then took up Dean Brown, who
lectured on “The Choice of a Life Work,”
and told of his lecture, in which he
brought out the importance of choosing
the right life work and the factors that
should ‘be considered in the choice.
Lastly he told what Brother Mark said
about the opportunities of Davidson
men; the need they could fill and how
few of them were seeing and responding
to that need. He closed with a quota-
tion expressing the spirit of Blue Ridge
“Jesus Christ, the same yesterday,
today, and forever.”

asi

T. H. Patterson next spoke on the
“y. M. C. A.” as a world organization.
“Pat” first showed how the “Y” was
functioning in this country bltelling us
of the difficulties and the achievements
of the “Y” in aiding the steel workers;
its position as an arbiter in several, dis-
putes between the workers and _ their
employers. He then told the inspiring
story of the Chinese “Y,” how it had
grown to a self-supporting organization;
recognized as a great power for good
in China and how the governments of
practically all of the provinces were
backing it to the limit. But he also
showed how, in spite of its rapid prog-
ress, it still needed secretaries, and of
the responsibility in this line that rested
on the men here.

The last speaker was J. P. Price. After |
drawing a forcefut picture of the differ-|
ent religious positions of the mass of |
people in the world he drove home the}
fact that we should lead a Christian life.
He also clearly showed that a Christian
life does not mean to merely go through
the forms of ristian worship, but to
really live close to Christ and to help
others to live close to Him.

After the speeches Dwight Chalmers
mentioned the plans of the conference
next summer, and he and Murdock Mc- |
Leod, accompanied by J. P. Price, taught |
the men present the Blue Ridge song. |
The meeting was closed by a prayer by}
Dwight. |

Davidson Scrubs Tie High

School Eleven at Monroe

Boggs and Ballard Star in Backfield.
Monroe Passes Good.

In a game featured on the one part by
an aerial attack and on the other by line
plays, the Davidson Scrubs tied the Mon-
roe High eleven 19-19. From the open-
ing play to the last minute of the game
the High lads pulled their passes with
the regularity of clock-work. Two out
of every three plays went through the
air, A total of 22 passes were completed
out of an attempted 32, The uncanny
ability of the Monroe lads to hook the
spirals in any position, was remarkable.
The majority of these passes were natur-
ally short ones, but three of them each
netted 30 yards. The Scrubs in the air
were no good, but ‘on terra firma, line
plays never ceased to go. Boggs and
Ballard, through the line, always made
substantial gains and Overton and Rak-
er, skirting the ends, were also good
ground gainers,

In the first quarter Monroe received
and in three completed passes and one
line play went for a touchdown. They
failed at goal. Monroe again received
and on the first play fumbled; Phillips
recovered and scored a touchdown. Phil-
Davidson received and
lost ball on a fumble; Monroe recovered
but was held for downs. Davidson was
penalized 15 yards for holding and punt-
ed. By passes Monroe advanced to Da-
vidson’s goal, but an incomplete pass ‘be-
hind the line gave ball to Davidson.
Raker on the first play ran the ends for
25 yards, the longest run of the game.

In the second quarter Monroe advanc-
ed from the middle of the field to Da-
vidson’s two-yard line on five successive
completed forward passes. They bucked
the line three times for a touchdown.
Kicked goal. Davidson received and lost
ball on a fumble. Monroe lost ball on
a fumble, and Davidson again fumbled.
Monroe passed to Davidson’s 20-yard
tine but was forced to punt. Half.

In the third quarter Davidson receivy-
ed and by line bucks got within 10 yards
of the goal and lost ball on a fumble.
Overton intercepted pass but his pass
was in turn intercepted. Monroe passed
to middle of field, where Davidson inter-
cepted their pass, but had their own pass
intercepted again. Monroe passed to Da-
vidson’s 20-yard line, where a pass is
blocked, but Monroe recovered and ran
for a touchdown. They: failed at goal.
Davidson received and on straight line
bucks took the ball to the goal. Raker
pushed it over. Phillips failed at goal.

The tennis tournament which is now
being played off is one of the most sue-
cessful that has ever taken place at Da-
vidson, The lovers of the raquet game
have shown fine spirit, by complying
with the desires of the promoters.

Probably the best match that has been
played off so far is that between June-
bug Price and Henry Myers. Both men
were playing their best game and seem-
ed to be putting all that they had into
the match,

Another good match was that between
Henry Morris and Louis Wilkinson. The
men were evenly matched as shown by
the score—4-6; 6-3; 6-2.

The outcome of the first round was as
follows:

Cunningham defeated Dunlap, 6-4; 6-1.

Kretchmar defeated Ives, 7-5; 10-8.

Price defeated Bradford, 6-4; 6-3.

Coach Grey’s Wildkittens
Down Shelby High 27 to 6

High School Lads Put Up Game
Fight With College Men.

A mighty conflict was staged in the
little town of Shelby on Saturday last,
in which the lads from Shelby High were
subdued, conquered, and sent beneath
the well known yoke, by the terrible
Davidson “Wildkittens,” bit only after
the aforementioned warriors made
name for themselves which will do jus-
tice to any high school of the state

Imbued with the “Wildcat” spirit and
inspired by the presence of Coach La-
Kar, the Scrubs entered the fray with a
wholehearted — determination
“scrap.”

The first half found the Davidsonians
at their best, with the line holding fast
and the backs running wild, This period
ended with the 20-0, Davidson
holding the long end. The second period

forged across the last white line one
time for a counter, Austell carrying the
ball. The college lads also scored again
in this frame.

Davidson decidedly outplayed — the
home team, gaining considerably more
ground and landing 12 first downs, while
Shelby made 5.

Brown gained most ground for Da-
vidson, Moore and Crawford coming in
for their share of the honors. McLaugh-
lin and Richards showed up in stellar
form in the line.

The “Hi” boys have been under the
able tutelage of Coach Gurley, the
mighty back who made his fame with
the North Carolina Engineers, and they
show great promise for a good season.

Opponents.

Last Saturday in Atlanta, Georgia Tech
easily defeated) Davidson, piling up a
70-0 score. The Wildcats were outweigh-
ed and outclassed, being on the defensive
throughout the game. Davidson did not
make a single first down and never car-

ried the ball into Tech's territory.

The drive of the Tornado backs was
the feature the game.
Only on four oceasions€lid a Tech run-
ner fail to gain when called upon. How-
ever, only two of their touchdowns were
the result of this driving style of atack.
The first touchdown was made on the
fourth play of the game on a pass from
Barron to A. Staton, netting 56 yards.
Four of the Georgian’s scores were the
