i WILDCAT FOOTBALL

Davidson defense made it happen

Wildcats record first shutout of the decade

By Micuaet J. Kruse
Editor in Chief

On paper, Saturday’s football game
at Richardson Field looked like any-
thing but a 43-0 drubbing.

Considering the lopsided score, a
quick glance at the stat sheet proved a
tad puzzling.

*As pitiful as Hampden-Sydney
was — and the Tigers, now 0-8, were
just that, and probably more — the
Wildcats only won the battle of total
offense by 18 yards — 193-175.

The Tigers earned the advantage
in first downs, collecting 16 to
Davidson’s 14. *

*Both teams’ passing attacks were
equally woeful, as Hampden-Sydney
collected 98 yards through the air and
the Wildcats, who used four quarter-
backs — Tommy Dugan, Shaun
Tyrance, Matt Strader, and John
Gaither — managed only 80.

eAnd while Hampden-Sydney’s
ground game mustered a mere 77 yards,
the Wildcats’ wasn’t exactly prolific
either, countering with 113.

The difference in this contest? The
Wildcat defense.

Defensive coordinator Tripp

Merritt’s corps forced seven turnovers,
five of which led to Davidson touch-
downs.

“That (forcing turnovers) is some-
thing the defensive staff has preached
the past two weeks, and the kids really
responded today,” coach Tim Landis
explained. “We didn’t have a lot of
yardage, but we did get the football in
great situations.”

Indeed, thanks to the Wildcats’
swarming “D,” Davidson’s offense
didn’t have to rack up much yardage at
all on its way to scores.

Four of the Wildcats’ five touch-
down drives — the sixth came on an
interception return by Clif Henry with
under a minute left in the first half —
were less than 32 yards and ate no more
than 2:16 off the clock.

And the one that didn’t wasn’t
exactly methodical either, as the Wild-
cats used just seven plays and 3:16to go
58 yards for their fifth touchdown.

“That’s as fine a defensive effort
as we've had in the-past five years,”
Landis said. “It speaks a lot of our guys
on the defensive side of the football.”

“Coach Merritt has been really
working hard. He spent some extra
time watching films,” said stellar rookie

lineman Bo Henderson, who led the
Wildcats with 11 tackles, including three
for a loss, recovered two fumbles, and
had two sacks.

“We didn’t really make any ad-
justments. We just had really hard
practices this week. Everybody worked
really hard.”

So much so that even the offense
took note. :

“The defense played one of the
best games I’ve seen them play,” said
tailback Nate Hagerman, who scored
the Wildcats’ second touchdown of the
day. “They played great team defense.

‘Freeman (Belser) and Bo played great,

and the defensive back played really
solid for the first time since the first
couple of weeks.”

Belser had nine takedowns to go
with an interception, while Shreve
Ariail added seven and Ben Spivey and
Chris Hess each pitched in six apiece.
Spivey had a sack, and Hess and Ariail
each had one tackle for a loss. Chris
Frederick also had six tackles and re-
covered a fumble. ;

Passing glory
Hagerman, who was a star quar-
terback in high school for Bishop Verot

in Fort Myers, Fla., attempted his first
collegiate pass Saturday against
Hampden-Sydney.

His halfback option bomb, which
came on a third-and-goal play from the
35yard line early in the fourth quarter,
was actually caught in the end zone by
Corey Crawford. But a penalty ne-
gated his bid for atouchdown pass to go
with a second quarter scoring run.

“That was frustrating because it
was the first time I was able to.toss it in
a (college) game,” Hagerman said. “I

_ was so happy, but then I saw the flag. It

was still nice, even though it didn’t
count.”

“On third-and-goal from the 35, as
an offensive coach, I don’t really have
a play for that situtation,” Landis
quipped. “That’s the only one I could
think of. So we went with Nate, who
played © quarterback in ~~ high
school.”...Jamel Wynn, a6-foot-1,232-
pound offensive lineman from Greens-
boro, Ga., suffered a second-degree me-
dial collateral ligament tear Wednes-
day in practice and is out for the season.
The Wildcats compensated for the loss
on Saturday by playingfreshman Matt
Berry at center and shifting regular
center Chip Stewart to tackle.
