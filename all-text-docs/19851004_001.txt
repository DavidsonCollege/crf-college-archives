Davidson looks at itself

Self-study outlines ‘constuctive changes’

By ANDREA DIEDRICH

The Davidson College Self-
Study Report for the Southern As-
sociation of Colleges and Schools
was released this Tuesday approx-
imately two years after the process
began. The Visiting Committee
from the Southern Association
will be in Davidson from Nov. 3
through Nov. 6 according to psy-
chology Profesor John Kelton,
who is Chairman of the Steering
Committee for the Self Study and
Associate Dean of the Faculty.

The Visiting Committee,
chaired by Denton Coker, Provost
at Stetson University, — will
examine Davidson in terms of the
Criteria for Accreditation (De-
cember 1983 edition) and decide
whether or not to reaffirm David-
son’s initial accreditation of 1963-
64. The Committee is expected to
meet with selected faculty and
staff, Kelton said.

A positive aspect of the self-
study aside from reaffirmation of
accreditation that Kelton em-
phasized is the benefits that can
arise from “self-examination.”
Kelton hopes the study will lead to
constructive change at Davidson.
He also pointed out that since
every member of last year’s facul-
ty participated in the self-study,
most of the current faculty has had
the opportunity to examine some
aspect of the College in detail.

As Associate Dean of the Fac-
ulty, Kelton explained he is re-
sponsible for making sure the rec-
ommendations aren’t just dropped
or ignored. “If the self-study is to
be worth the effort, time and
money, we must build on it and
use it as a springboard,” he said.

Although the emphasis is on
problems with Davidson, the In-
troduction to the Self-Study says,
“The consensus of this report is
that things are going well at
Davidson College. People are

doing a good job and the College
is confident about its mission.”

The Introduction also explains
that preparation for the self-study
began in the late fall of 1983 when
the Steering Committee was
elected by the faculty. In the
spring of 1984, committee chairs
were chosen by the Steering Com-
mittee. Then every resident facul-
ty member was assigned to a com-
mittee. Consideration was given
to the committee preference indi-
cated by faculty members in a poll
conducted by the Steering Com-
mittee.

Each committee covered a dif-
ferent aspect of the College. Ex-
amples of those committees are
History and Purpose, Under-
graduate Program, Faculty, Ath-
letics, and Institutional Research
and Planning.

The Student Government As-
sociation also appointed a com-
mittee of students to survey a por-
tion of the student body about
three aspects of student life: ser-
vices, activities and government/
academic concerns. Those sur-
veys were used by several of the
self-study committees.

The Introduction also explains
that each academic department
conducted its own self-study. Kel-
ton said these reports are integrat-
ed in the Self-Study as well as
available for reference as separate
entities.

The final report represents the
work of each committee after the
Steering Committee reviewed and
edited each individual report. The
final chapter is a report written by
the Steering Committee that tries
to emphasize those aspects of the
complete report that require the
most attention.

There are six priority recom-
mendations in‘ the Steering Com-
mittee’s report. One recommen-
dation involves the adaptation of a

mission statement to supplement
the Statement of Purpose. The
mission statement would express
“the purposes of the institution in
terms of contemporary issues and
concerns” in contemporary lan-
guage.

Another priority recommen-
dation is “that a task force repre-
senting the Trustees, faculty, ad-
ministration, staff, students, and
alumni be established to deter-
mine the best philosophy and pol-
icy for athletics at Davidson,” The
Athletic Committee, chaired by
English Professor Gil Holland,
recommended “that the college
seriously consider joining Divi-
sion III of the NCAA and compet-
ing in that division in all sports,
both male and female.”

Kelton said he does not know
when, if ever, the Steering Com-

mittee’s priority —recommenda-
tions will be acted upon, but he
emphasized that there has already
been a strong interest in the report
expressed by groups including the
Strategic Planning Task Force. He
said the report has been distri-
buted to the faculty, administra-
tion offices, Trustees, Visiting
Committee, student government
leaders, and student government
offices.

Following are some examples
of recommendations made by the
committees. The Self-Study is 351
pages long, so these examples
represent only a very small por-
tion of the whole Self-Study.

The Undergraduate Program
Committee, chaired by psycholo-
gy Professor Edward Palmer, rec-
ommended “that the College con-
sider establishing a college-ad-

ministered merit scholarship pro-
gram open to all students without
qualifications of ethnicity, sex or
religion, with a view towards es-
tablishing equality with compet-
ing institutions in enrolling the ex-
ceptionally gifted student.” They
also recommended “that the plus
and minus grading option be
added to all standard grade
categories except F,” and “that up
to the beginning of the tenth week ,
students who have performed
above C level in a Pass-Fail course
have the opportunity for letter-
grade conversion upon request.”

The Library Committee,
chaired by history Professor
David Shi, suggested “that the li-
brary staff undertake a com-
prehensive user survey and cost
analysis to determine the feasibil-
ity of opening the library on Satur-
day evenings and/or Sunday
mornings.

The Computer and Instruc-
tional Support Committee,
chaired by political science Pro-
fessor Thomas Kazee,
mended “that the combined
number of terminals and personal
computers available to students
[be] increased to approximate the
faculty/student ratio.

The Student
Committee, chaired by biology
Professor David Grant,
mended “that locking systems be
installed in all dormitories and
that scheduled hours for closing
be established.”
