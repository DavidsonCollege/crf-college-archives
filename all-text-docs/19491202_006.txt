TESTING SERVICE SCHEDULES
GRADUATE ENTRANTS TESTS

Princeton, N. J.-~Tests of the
Graduate Record Examination, re-
quired of applicants for admission
to a number of graduate schools,
will be administered at examination
centers throughout the country
four times in the coming year, Edu
cational Testing Service has an-
nounced. During 1948-1949 nearly
15,000 students took the GRE in
partial fulfillment of admission re-
quirements of graduate schools
which prescribed it.

This fall, candidates might have
taken the GRE on Friday and Sat-.
urday, October 28 and 29; in 1950,
the dates are February 3 and 4,
May 5 and 6, and August 4 and 5.
Since the GRE is not required by
all graduate schools, ETS advises
each student to inquire of his pros-
pective school whether or not he
is expected to take the test and,
if so, on which dates.

The GRE tests offered in these
nationwide programs include a test
of general scholastic ability, tests
of general achievement in six broad
fields of undergraduate study, and
advanced level tests of achievernenit
in-various subject matter fields. Ac-
cording to ETS, candidates are
permitted several options among
these tests.

Application forms and a Bulletin
of Information, which provides de-
tails of registration and adminis-
tration, as well as sample questions,
may be obtained from advisers or
directly from Educational Testing
Service, Box 592, Princeton, N. J.,
or Box 2416, Terminal Annex, Los
Angeles 54, California. A complet-
ed application must reach the ETS
office at least two weeks before
the date of the administration for
which the candidate is applying,

influence on the tradition and the
system of the universities, its stu-
dents, and its teachers.

We all know that the past war,
its destruction and evils, did not
pass these streets. It brought to
them sorrow and pain — trouble
and hardship, Student life is not
the same as it was 20 years ago,
when our fathers studied there. But
I hope and am to some extent sure,
that this will not la-t all of the ‘ime
and when peace eventually comes
back to Germany, it will come first
to those places ‘known and loved
by all the world. Then they will
be as they were before, not deny-
ing the progress of the world but
also not sacrificing the old customs
and traditions ‘that have been
brought down through all the past
centuries of history.

COLLEGE NAGS...

Colgate musicians were returning
from the Colgate-Northwestern
game, The attack was made at the
Syracuse railroad station by nearly
one hundred students. Most of the
band escaped with police help, but
about twenty were taken to the
Syracuse campus and given hair-

cuts in the shape of a large “S.”

Duke Chronicle published an edi-
toriai giving three reasons why stu-
dents would be wise to refrain
from being seen with a paint and
brush before the Duke-Carolina
game: 1,. Anyone caught will be
subject to expulsion. 2. Extra police
will be on duty to take care of any-
one carrying paint without reason.
3. The odds for getting a broken
nose from a hometown committee
are pretty good.

The editorial continued, “We
have a good team, let them play
the game.”

Coach Evashevski says about No-
tre Dame: “They’re just nasty,” he
explained. “So rugged and aggres-
sive that their clean play is rough-

Since everyone has to get into

donc, Cop and the “Bulls” got the

fully maneuvered the horse out. of
Hinson and Hollister Haven,
through the coal bin, and up to
ground level to make West Dormi-
tory “once more free for studying
and all-night brawls.’ What was
done to the undeserving horse is
still unknown, However, the next
time you eat some jello or use
some P. O. glue, see if it doesn’t
slightly flavor old tennis shoes, a
sponge chair mat or a black and,
red floor rug — all of which were
once in “D” West,

“Two years in the saddle is worth

SOCIAL FUNCTIONS...
(Continued From Page Two)
make it necessary to serve only
light refreshments rather 3 more

hearty repast.

Aside from the limited facilities
for on campus functions the prob-
lem of ‘transportation to and from
Charlotte is always present. While
this would remain a problem if we
could have more functions in Char-
lotte, it would not, I think be so
great. We would not have to wor-
ry so much about transportation
for our dates.

There are I think at least three
reasons why the faculty should not
impose such ruling on the stu-

dent body. First, we are old enough

to regulate our own time, and how
we will spend it. I do not think
that more functions would be de-
trimental to ¢ students studies. The
faculty encourages self discipline
by the fact that they do not im-
pose dormitory restrictions on the
students, even during the weck. We
are free to go where we please,
when we please, their only require-
ment being that we keep up our
work, This is the best attitude and
I do not see why it will not work
with fraternities as well as individ-
vals, It seems to me that it would
be ‘much better for the students to
remain around the campus for a
Saturday night affair than to be
running off every week end and I
think more off campus functions
would provide such an_ incentive.
Somehow, although just as good,
an on campus function doesn't
have the appeal that a fraternity
sponsored dance in Charlotte would.
I do think the fraternities would
use discretion in planning: their so-
cial affairs, therefore it should be
left up to the individual fraterni-
ties as to how many “off campus”
tunctions they wish to have,

Secondly, this wotld afford the
members of each fraternity and
their dates more opportunities to
get together. At Davidson the
boarding house brings the group
together three times a day, since we
do not live in our fraternity houses.
However, many opportunities for
closer friendship are lost because
so many of the brothers go off the
campus on week ends. If we could
have more dances in Charlotte in
the name of the, fraternity, the
group would be brought closer to-
gether. If a small group desires to
go to Charlotte for an evening, they
go and the college says nothing,
why inhibit an entire group going
under the name of the fraternity.

Third, this would afford an op-
portunity for more varied and en-
joyable activities. Most of the time
the fraternities wish to use their
one time a semester for a formal
function, one right before Christ-
mas and one :n the Spring. This
leaves out such activities as hay-
rides, parties at Lakes, picnics,
square dances, etc. These all have
to be done off campus for such a
large group, and at present are clim-
inated by the faculty ruting.

IT think the faculty ruling should
be amended and the number of off
campus functions left up to the
individual fraternity. I do not see
the reason why we must be ruled
in this by the faculty. At least they
should give it a try and see how
it works. Davidson students are
suppcsed to be gentlemen and
capatie of acting as such, It seems
to me that in this matter we are be-
ing sreated as high school students
who are not able to discipline them-
selves.—R.L.T.

This is true because the United

States is far less prepared to take

over the role of being the dominant

power in the world than Great

Britain was. Indeed, Britain sought

the position, while it was thrust up-

on America, We are expected to set
an example of behavior to every na-
tion that has a republican form of
government. Yet our own President
seeks to lead us down the road of
welfarism, and our Congress’ makes

a political football out of every is-

sue of the day, no matter how im-

portant it may be. We are expect-

ed to champion thé rights of free
peoples everywhere. Yet our arm-
ed services are inextricably tied up
in wrangling and red tape that re-
duces their potency to nearly noth-
ing. We are expected to stand as
the ideal system of free enterprise,
as opposed to Marxism. Yet we are
rapidly becoming a nation of peo-
ple who expect everything for noth-
ing, who want the Government to
give us homes, bonuses, education,
health services, price and wage sup-
ports, and everything clse. our
hearts may desire, and who naively
expect to give nothing in return.
We are éxpected to prop up friend-
ly feeble governments and to save
them from economic disorder or
collapse. Yet we are wildly spend-
ing ourselves into bankruptcy with
all sorts of uncalled-for appropri: -

tions. .

In shortt, we as a nation are not
prepared for the job that has sud-
denly and unexpectedly been thrust
upon ws. We have not matured
enough to accept the responsibili-
ty that is ours; we are not experi-
enced cnough to find solutions to
the problems that will dog us con-
tinually from now on. Having now
reached the top, we have only two
courses open to us: we can stay

er nation in history has been able
to do for very long; or we can fall
again to mediocrity or even to ig-
nominy, which will surely be our
fate, if we continue on the present
tack.

I, No one would go out on a limb
and make a prediction this early in
the yedr, particularly in view of
the fact that Davidson has so many
new faces in the line-up, but you
can bet your boots that we, along
with many other died-in-the-wool
Davidson supporters, will be watch-
ing these first few games with a
definite air of expectancy and op-
timism.

Arrived in France, I was very

world, to her he was just her hus-
band—a man to be humored in his
bad moments and loved genuinely
in all of them.

Nancy Copeland was very good
as Lilly Herbish, giving us a per-
formance not only excellent from
the standpoint of this play, but far
superior to any she has ever given
in past years. The conclusion as re-
gards Nancy is obvious—she plays
a character part far better than
she does a straight, and it is to be
hoped that future productions will
see Nancy in more such parts
where she can shine as she did in
this one .

Mac Bulgin’s Harwood Biddle
was a sinall part but, as he did it,
tremendously effective. He should
prove valuable to the Masquers.

Bill Tromtan as Senator McKin-
ley was, and there is no other word,
terrific. His rather extensive past
experience promised great things
and Bill more than lived up to our
expectations.! His portrayal of the
cynical but human Senator was
easily the best acting in the whole

play. We hope to see more, a great,

deal more of Bill Trotman.

From an overall standpoint, the
play ran very smoothly and it ‘is
evident that Bob Gay's directing
played no small part in this, The
Masquer’s new director is evidently |-
one who does not abuse his ca-
pity and much praise is due him
for his part in John Loves Mary.

So the season is opened and with
a good play well done. In cop-
clusion, this critic can only ‘say
that he awaits eagerly the next
production of the Masquers.

‘Y' States Aims

The Davidson College YMCA
believes thatyone of the most es-
sential phases of a wide-awake, con-
tributing, dynamic “Y" program at
Davidson is a likewise lively and
conscientious “Y" publicity and
publications department.

The function of such a depart-
ment is to keep the student body
and the general public regularly
well-informed on’ all matters of
YMCA service and College activi-
ties which are of interest to the
students and to people everywhere,

Accordingly, the plans of the Da-
vidson YMCA publicity and Pub-
lications department include the
following categories:

Pictures, feature stories, special
articles, notices, etc., appearing in
the DAVIDSONIAN, local Ga-
zette, and city newspapers;

Publication of the WILDCAT
HANDBOOK;

Publication of special pamphlets
Vesper bulletins, and entertain-
ment programs (such as those for
Salem-Davidson Day);

The advertisement of special
events, such as Fall and Spring ser-
vices, female-Davidson Days, spe-
cial chapel programms, intercollegiate
meetings, etc.;

The advertisement and promo-
tion of the Christmas Gift Fund;

The production of posters, hand-
bills, and Placards;
