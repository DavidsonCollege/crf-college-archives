‘that it is a fine liberal arts
college, large enough to offer a
diversified curriculum and

of community.”

She has already formed
opinions concerning some
issues On campus.

The idea of freshmen halls
has often been criticized be-
tause some think it does not
give freshmen a chance to
broaden their .ftiendships. be-
Yond their hall: Ross, who has
met with this. year’s ‘hall

ience in dealing with freshman
halis, feels that freshman halls

Dr security.

, * Freshman year is such a
trucia) transition year that it
is.impurtant to have someone
who is responsible and con-
zerret,’’ she said. She does
not approve of large freshman
dor. nitories because they inhi-
bit the assimilation of fresh-
men into the student body.

' One of her major concerns is
the sophomore year. ‘‘Sudden-
ly there’s no one particular to
cdre and sometimes you need
is6meone to go and talk to
besides a close friend.’’She

ss often visited the cam-

pus when she was an under-
Weaduate at Queens. ‘I think
its wonderful that girls are at
sJ@vidson. It’s a lot nicer and
healthier.’’ Ross believes that
women, like everyone else,
should have an equal chance,
though she does not classify
herself as a women’s libber.
She sees a problem with
Davidson's current male/fe-
male ratio. ‘‘Sometimes the
boys think that all the girls are

committed’ and say there’s no
use in trying to get a date. But
there often are a lot of girls not
committed and not dating.”’

Another problem with the
ratio, she says,is that girls mix
often get a false sense of their
own worth since six or seven
guys may be after them.
“That is not how it is in the
real world,”’ she said.

“The main thing is for men
ng women to be friends so
éhat there can by” respect
between the’ tw6.” She there-
f$re-sees.a need for a more
gyen-ratio.

‘rushing’ (if allowed), tor
self-selection, and for ‘‘pledge-
training’’ (if needed).
3) Establishing rules for terms
of membership on Patterson
Court; establishing procedures
for termination of a house’s
lease due to financial misman-
agement, loss of membership,
or violation of regulations;
establishing an instrument in
the Patterson Court Council to
initially handle violations of
regulations.

The Rules Subcommittee
will report to the Council on
Campus and Religious Life by
late fall, and the Council will
decide what regulations to
recommend to the President.

Carroll emphasizes that the

Subcommittee welcomes ideas
and comments from any stu-
dent or campus organization,
and asks that all suggestions
be made in writing through
the Dean of Students Offfice,
preferably by September 19.

Ross was hired after last
spring’s Christian Tenure con-
troversy and said that the
issue did not affect her deci-
sion in coming here. She had
mixed feelings-when she first
read of the controversy in the
national papers and said that
she has not as yet had the
chance to hear all sides of the
story.

She said she was surprised
by the fact that Davidson even
had such a policy. However,
she was encouraged by the
way the students, faculty,
administrators and trustees
handled the situation.

Ross has a variety of extra-
curricular interests. She is
extremely active in. water
sports, especially swimming
nd boating. She is also very
interested in the theatre. She
does some photography, rides
horses and plays guitar. She
has travelled through the
United States and twice to
Europe.

Although only three stu-
dents are using the facility at
present, the building has
space to accomodate eight to
ten students. These students
will have full time access to
the building.

Use of the building is not _
limited to art majors, Jackson
said, but students may not use
toxic or flammable materials.
He supplies studios on the
basis of need and said stu-
dents who do not use the
facilities will lose the privilege.

Until last spring the Black
Student Coalition used two
rooms in the lower part of
Lingle Manor but now occupy
a house on Jackson Court,
freeing the entire house for use
by the art department.

‘‘As (the art department)
grew we needed more space
and (the Black Student Coali-
tion), was never happy there,”
said Jackson.

During winter term Profes-
sor of Art Doug Houchens
teaches basic studio in the
building, and in the spring
Jackson uses Lingle for an
advanced painting class. The
classes taught there create the
only disadvantage Jackson
sees in using Lingle Manor for
studios.
