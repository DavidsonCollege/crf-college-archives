“One Way"---What Next?

The first sign of progress in any small town is the
abundance of traffic lights. The next step, we see, 1S
the “one-way” street.

Will the final step be to include Davidson on the list
of the “ten most likely cities to be hit with H-Bombs”?

Small College?

The latest Davidson College Bulletin states that “Da-
vidson is a particular kind of college . . . liberal-arts . . .
independent of state control . . . church-related . . . and
a SMALL COLLEGE, PRIDING ITSELF ON THE PER-
SONAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN STUDENTS AND
FACULTY, STUDENTS AND THEIR FELLOWS.”

Two years ago, the Trustees voted to make Davidson

a bigger college. This year. we see the first evidence of | 7

a bigger Davidson.

The facts are not all so rosy as we would like them
to be. But the Trustees have given the word.

Many classes are filled to the limit. Many have 40.
50, or close to 60 men in one class. In fact, some rooms
are so crowded that the desks must be packed edge to
edge.

“You have to come early to get a seat” is no longer
a laughing matter. A great majority of boys came to Da-
vidson because it is a small school. We would like to
keep it that way.

At least we're glad to see that the auditorium stage
will still seat all of the faculty. We haven't yet passed the
point of no return.

Don't Be Just
Another Body

Begirining Monday night, each freshman will begin
the round of parties that will introduce him to Davidson’s
fraternities.

He will be beset by eager rushers. He will be made
‘to feel quite important by all the ostensible fan-fare. But
at the end of the week—when all the niceties are over
—each freshman will be left to decide for himself with
which fraternity he will be most happy.

The best advice, so it is said, is no advice. So we
are not going to tell the freshmen how to pick a fraterni-
ty, or a fraternity how to pick a pledge.

But what we do say is this. Fraternities don’t end
with the closing of Rush Week. The real work should
be just beginning. The fraternities should make every
effort to avoid the frustrations of so-called “Flush Week.”

It is indeed unfortunate that so many fraternity men
think that their jobs is over when they’ve helped to bag
a good group of pledges. ,

On the other hand. the freshmen ought to realize
that the same characteristics and personality factors that
won them a bid are the same traits that will continue to

FRESHMEN |?
PUSHED BACK

The new freshmen class held
their -first riot of the season
this past Sunday night.

Battling with yells and pans
of water, the new members of
the Davidson community were

successfully thrown back by a
small group of upper classmen.

The raging freshmen, many
in bathing suits, stormed the|
front of Belk Dormitory. A few
entered the building, but most
kept a safe distance on the lawn
in front.

This was the first real demon | Bg,

by saying that Sunday night was
the last “free” night they
would have.

GEORGE RAMSEY

Dear folks,

The rat race is herewith begun. We of the Davidson
elite have now settied somewhat uncomfortably into new
dorms, new classes, and gaze hopefully down behind
Mr. Stacks’ stomping grounds to the new fraternity
court.

The Class of 1961 is now very oriented, very polite,
and very allergic to grass. They are also bigger and
rowdler than any of their immediate predecessors. At
least they think so.

There are rumors that Bill Dole, our football! coach,
is running over with talent, but the cliche “a ship with-
out a captain” is being resurrected, as the team has lost
its two experienced quarterbacks.

Sophomore Charlie Benson, who throws from the
wrong side, is pretty much the key to the Davidson for-
tunes. At least, that’s the impression you get around
here. Stated concisely, the Wildcats reminds us of Jayne
Mansfield—big up front and a backfield that should at-
tract a lot of rave notices.

Other topics around the dome include the expanded
soccer schedule, the promising freshman basketball pro- -
spects, the adventures of the pea pickers, and Orval
Faubus.

Your loving son,
GEORGE

With a look made of some-
thing other than “sweet ac-
cord” Davidson's finest have
again returned to the fold. Now
that registration is complete;
the old friendships (‘So you
have a new car?”) are being re-
newed, and the saddened faces
are beginning to smile (“Where
to this weekend. Mac?”).

The many red beanies signal

that a host of gay young blades
have aiso blessed the campus

make them attractive members of the group. In other] with their presence. This year’s

words, don't put up a front (unless you think you can
_keep it for four years!)

So it all adds up to a little advice. If you join a fra-
ternity join it with the idea that you will contribute
something to the group. Above all, give it your complete
loyalty. Show interest in the group. Don’t be afraid to
do a little work.

As some one once said, “don’t be another body”—
that is, “dead wood.”

Every fraternity at Davidson is a good fraternity.
Each chapter has something to offer its members. You
will have to decide which one is best for you.

Whatever one it be, join with the thought of becom-
ing an active member and not just a name on a roll.

erop is no more staid than in
past years—one ridt even dur-
ing Orientation.

Statistically, the newest class
on campus presents some in-
teresting points. The geographi-
cal background of the fresh.
man class is more concentrated
than in years past. Five states,
North Carolina, South Carolina.
Virginia, Florida, and Georgia
—sent 90% of the Class of ‘61.

In the “future plans” depart:

ment the class is more diversi-
fied than their predecessors,
with the largest definite group
again being the Pre-Meds with
42. The two most noticeable

shifts have been in the En.
gineering field, which rose to
28. and in the Pre-Ministerial

contingent, which fell from last
year’s 35 to 14.

As always, the majority of
the freshmen are undecided.

The overall upperclass pic-
ture will not be available until
the Registrar's office digs out
from undef the “Now do I have

to have a sjxth period?” ava-
lanche.

To Upperclassmen

Upon your return to the campus this week, you
found the Class of 1961 engaged in the final period of
orientation. You found these men being schooled in the
‘traditions and ideals of Davidson, the administration of
College policy, and the physical makeup of the school,
just as you were when your classes arrived on the Hill
for the first time.

I have been closely associated with the Class of
1961 for more than a week now and, if I may, I would
like to express a personal opinion. The men of the Fresh-
man Class have amply exhibited the quality and potential
which is expected of Davidson men. I feel sure that upon
graduation the Class of 1961 will give to the nation an-
other outstanding group of leaders, fully aware of their
responsibilities and obligations to society—Bill Fraley.
