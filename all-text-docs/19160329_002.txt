EDITORIAL.

OUR AIMS.

There is but one way to achieve suc-
cess, and that is to strive toward a high
ideal. This is true in the case of news-
papers as well as other things. “He
Davipsonian is about to celebrate its
third birthday. It has passed into the
hands of a new staff, to be surrounded
by new thought and ideas, And tho the

new staff may be unable to fill the shoes}

of the old staff, it has the same high
ideals for the paper.

THe DaAvivsontian is meant primar-
ily to represent the Student Body as a
whole in thought and action. It is a
paper for the students and by the stu-
dents. Its sincere endeavor is to be gov-
erned by neither fear nor love nor any
organization or party. As far as possi-
ble everything that enters its pages is
authoritative. Signed papers by anyone
are not only welcomed but courted.
Criticisms and suggestions are of great
use to the editors.

Then THe Davinsonian is intended
to be a thing of real service to the
alumni, to give to them a true picture of
all departments of college life and to
keep them in touch with each other.
Davidson's rapid development during
the last few years has been due largely
to the alumni, and if the paper could be
a means of binding the association to-
gether, a means of communication, it
would not be purposeless.

Tre Davinsontan has ideals of
growth: growth in quality, each year
finding it better organized and more
readable; growth in lines of thought
and breadth of topics: growth in size.
fondly looking forward to the time when
a six or eight page issue will greet its
readers; growth in circulation, a copy in
the hands of every student and alumnus
and friend of the college.

So this is what the editors of THe
DavipsontiaN are working toward.
They will need support.

WEEKLY MEETINGS.

The regular debate of the Eumenean
Society last week was unusually good.
All the speakers showed that they had
spent a great deal of time and thought,
and expressed themselves in strong,
effective words. The subject, “Resolved,
that the Keating Child Labor Bill
should be passed,” was defeated. The
affirmative was upheld by J. ‘I. Wil-
liams, Allen and Bellingrath, whose
chief arguments were based on the fact
that such a law was needed by the work-
ing children, and that only a national
law would be properly enforced. On the
negative, J. H. Miller, Hoyt and Mul-

len dwelt on the fact that it was uncon-|W. G. MORRISON

stitutional, and that it was a direct blow
at the industries of the South,

The strongest speech of the evening
was delivered by L. A. Mullen, of the
negative, who answered a great part of
his opponents’ argiments. G. C. Bel-
lingrath, of the affirmative, gave a very
good debate.

The regular meetings of the societies
Monday morning were not held on ac-
count of the student body meeting: di-
rectly after breakfast.

‘The debate in the Phi was probably
the best of the year. Every man showed
that he had given more time to prepara-
tion than usual, “Vhe rejoinders were
spirited and showed that each man was
getting at the heart of the question.
Those debating on the affirmative side
were: J. L. Fowle, Reese, H. B. Craig.
and Clary. Some of the arguments of-
fered by them were that child labor was
having a ruinous effect, that Congress
had a right to better the conditions from
the “welfare” clause of the constitution.
The negative side was composed of C.
Hunter, Nesbit, “‘F. N. Morton, Witt
and Sparrow. They recognized the need
of caring for the children; but showed
that the bill was an improvement over
our own North Carolina law only in
making the age limit thirteen instead of
fourteen. “Then several decisions of the
Supreme Court were read to show that
the bill was unconstitutional.

The decision rendered by the judges
was in favor of the negative. Fowle
probably brought the most forceful argu-
ment for the affirmative, and Witt and
Sparrow for the negative.

“MOVIES” SATURDAY NIGHT.
The “Movies” in Shearer Hall, Sat-
urday night, were attended by a very
large and attentive audience of both
students and people of the town.

The pictures were given under the
auspices of the Civic League. D. W.
Lane and L. A. Crawford operated the
machine. ;

Because of insurance regulations it is
impossible to have pictures regularly in
Shearer Hall. It is reported, however.
that there are to be one or two more
“movie” attractions this spring.
