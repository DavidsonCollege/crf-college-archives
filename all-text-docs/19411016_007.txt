several students on the matter.
Bill Summers, Senidr :

To the question as to what the

students should do with the days
allotted to them in chapel, I would
say that it would be a good op-
portunity for the Red and Black

Masquers to expand somewhat their
program on the campus. In the past
this organization has been able to

ques- |

riling |

Here are the opinions of

present only about one or two pro-|

ductions a year for very obvious

reasons. So it seems to me. this

would give them the opportunity to |
work up some one-act plays, short |

‘ ' |
skits, etc. and present them without
too much trouble and loss of time. |
This would -give the club a chance

to vary a deal

would

great its activities

and give more students

an

opportunity to try out their drama-|

tic ability. But, most of all, I think

it would give the students some en

tertainment théy would enjoy. Why
not turn one chapel period a month

over to the Red and ~~ ‘Blaek
Masquers®

There is another organization on
the campus which could also use a
little more publicity. This is the
Forensic Council. To the average

student this means little or nothing.
Possibly he hears it mentioned in
the” fall the tryouts
are announced and again in the
spring when the debate teams re-
turn from their trips.

when debate

But outside
of that he knows very little of the
Forensic Council. and the part it
plays in the general program of the
school. The thought has occurred
to me that it might, be a good thing
if this organization were allowed to
schedule ‘at least two or three de-
bates in the spring with well known
schools for the student chapel peri-
ods, Each spring such schools as
Carnegie Tech, Haverford, Univer-
sity of Penn,, ete. visit the campus

and leave without very. many of
the students knowing’ it. Why not
let the student: body in on some
of the debating activities?
Herb Rainey, Junior:

I think that the Tuesday and
Thursday chapel ‘programs, or sat

least one of them, should be de=

these boys entertain the student
body with popular songs and swing
music? The school band has only

been heard at football games lately;

they put on some good outdoor pro-

grams last spring, why not start]
these performances indoor — this
winter?
Dick Rankin, Senior:

programs such as musicals, in the}

form of swing one time, and popu-

It is already known that several of

our studemts in the band have a

great talent for swing.
