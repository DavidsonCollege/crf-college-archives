THE DAVIDSONIAN, APRIL 10, 1930

Monk’s Baseball Team
Makes Successful Trip

Wildcats Lose to Wake Firest in Off
Form Style

Coach “Monk's” diamond charges showed
up very well as a whole on their first State
trip of the season, and except for a bow to
the old Wake Forest jinx, would have had
a perfect record. After displaying excellent
ball to down fighting teams at Elon and
N. C. State, 9-6 and 5-4, respectively, the
Wildcats slumped badly and, playing miser-
able ball, lost to Wake Forest, 13-2. Poor
hitting and worse fielding combined to make
this a disastrous day.

Playing in miserably cold weather, more
conducive to football than to baseball, the
Wildcats were able to bunch their hits and
defeat Elon for the first time in four years.
Davidson made four miscues, while Elon
was credited with seven, and the
bunched their hits in the second and third
to gain a safe lead. Armfield, Goodson, and
McInnis hit best, collecting eight safe blows
between them. The pitching of McInnis and
Lefty Briggs was about even.

On the followin day at Raleigh, N. C.
State was downed, 5-4. After a bad first in-
ning, when the Techmen scored three times
on two triples, a double and a single, Kugler
settled down and only allowed two hits for
the rest of the afternoon. .In the seventh,
the ’Cats scored three times to tie the score,
and in the eighth made two more to clinch
the game. McInnis continued his good hitting
by garnering a home run, and for the second
consecutive day, Parrish hit a triple. Turner
and Hargrave hit best for State, while Aver-
ette allowed the same number of hits as |
did Kugler.

Wildcat Golfers to
= ‘Meet Wake Forest

Wake Forest will furnish the opposition
for the Davidson golf team in the first inter-
collegiate match of the year on Saturday,
April 12, at the Charlotte Country Club.
The rest of the tentative schedule, although

with the following: Concord Country Club
at Concord, April 14; Wake’ Forest at Ra-
leigh, April 17; North Carolina State at
Raleigh, April 18; and Carolina at Sedge-
field, April 25. This month of play will be
ended when the Wildcat golfers enter the
State Tournament at Sedgefield, April 26.

On May 3, North Carolina State will be
played at Charlotte. A trip which will prob-
ably be made in the middle of May is being
planned by the team captain, Jack Pepper,
and a journey which will include three
South Carolina colleges, Clemson, Presby-
terian College and Furman.

The team at present is composed of two
upperclassmen and two freshmen, Other
members besides Captain Pepper are Jack
Wagner, John Thompson, and W. Lewis
Hart. The position of the latter named is
yet in doubt, as it is open to challenge by
the rest of the candidates for the team. The
competition for the fourth place will be
terminated by the end of this week, and the
winner will be given a permanent position
on the team, Captain Pepper divulged.

The team playing the University of“North
Carolina at the tournament will be composed

Davidson Trackmen
Overwhelm Furman

Captain Heath Whittle is High
Point Man of Meet

The Wildcat trackmen won their second
dual meet of the season Saturday by defeat-
ing Furman, 90 to 35. The time of most of
the events was exceptionally good, two
equalling the college record and another al-
most as good as the record. In three of the
matches Davidson took all three places, and
in five of the events they took first and
second to show their superiority over the
visiting team.

Captain Heath Whittle, Wildcat captain,
led the Wildcats to victory with 15 points,
and was high point man of the meet. In
the two hurdle events Whittle tied the col-
lege records which he holds. Lafferty, in the
mile run, came within six-tenths of a second
of the record.

The Wildcats are in readiness for the
Georgia Tech relays and are fairly strong
in all events. In several of the events they
are expecting to place.

Following is a summary of the meet:

100-yard dash—Whittle, D., Deery,
Brohard, D. Time, 10 seconds.

Mascot of Senior

Class Is Selected

At a recent meeting of the Senior Class,
pretty little Miss Betty Pritchet was select-
ed as ‘the mascot of the Class of ’30. Betty
is three years old, and is the daughter of
Captain and Mrs. N. G. Pritchet. Her father
is the head of the Physical Education De-
partment of the college.

Betty was the unanimous choice of the
class because of her great attractiveness and
charm, and the members of the Senior Class
boast that she is one of the most attractive
mascots in recent years.

Motorist: “Is it very far to the next
town?”

Native: “Well, it seems farthe’n it is,
but it ain’t.”

He: “So you think it would be foolish
for me to marry a girl who is my mental
inferior?”

She: “No, impossible.”

“Is she a wonderful girl?”
“Yes, figuratively speaking.”

With numerous errors aiding the Dea-
cons and with the worst hitting of the sea-
son for the Davidson nine, Wake Forest |
tromped on a tame Wildcat, 13-2, Seemingly
tired at the end of their three-game trip,
the ’Cats looked in no way like the nine |
that had downed Elon and N. C. State.

how it tastes.

And words can’t tell. you much about
Chesterfield’s taste. Tobacco ‘quality, mild fra-

you've tried Chesterfield; after that, three

words say it all:
