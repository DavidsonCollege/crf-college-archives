Automobile Industry Is Subject
Of Three Pictures Shown
To Students

The students of the Physics and
Chemistry Departments witnessed the
showing of three two-reel movies in the
Chemistry Laboratory at 7 o'clock last
Friday evening.

These pictures were made for the
General Motors Co., and were loaned
to the local science departments through
the courtesy of the National Y.°M. C. A.

Each of the pictures dealt with a differ- |,

ent phase of the automobile industry.

The first of the group was entitled
“Men and Motors.” In the form of
a dialogue between a company official
-and two young visitors this picture ex-
plained many of the features of the Gen-
eral Motors plant, emphasized the im-
portance of skilled labor in the manu-
facture of the various parts of their
cars.

The second, “What Makes a New
‘Car?” showed something of the work
of the company’s testing laboratories,
calling particular attention to the im-
provements in body finishes, fan belts,
and brake bands. This picture also con-
tains a discussion of the efforts made
by their scientists to lower the amount
of gasoline consumption.

The third and last of the series was
named “The Fourth Essential.” It opened
with a view of the early “benzine-bug-
gies” from which our modern vehicles
have evolved. The driver of this “speed-
chariot” prophesied the great future of
the commerce. which will grow out of
the horseless carriage. His talk was
accompanied by pictures illustrating the
performance of modern autos and the
showrooms, roads, filling stations, and
other results of its low cost and wide
distribution.

Throughout the year it has been the
policy of the Chemistry and Physics De-
partments to offer sound films of scien-
tific interest to their students. This set
will probably conclude the series for the
year.

I am made only of the choice center leaves. The top leaves are

bitter, biting. The bottom leaves are gritty, tough and unpal-
atable. My fragrant, expensive center leaves—so mellow and
rich—give you the mildest, best-tasting smoke. I do not irritate

your throat. To anxiety I bring relief. I’m your best friend.
