Cat Nips
Cowboy fans

on college
football

By Mike Wang
& Dave Dwyer

. Although we intend to address
the fortunes of America’s team at
some point in this article, in the
interests of the various Davidso-
nian editors we have decided to
broaden the scope of this column
in order to review a wider spec-
tacle of the world of sports. This
week we will focus on the college
football action for Saturday, Sep-
tember 24. Highlights: Michigan
vs. Colorado, Miami vs. Washing-
ton, Notre Dame vs. Purdue, North
Carolina vs. FSU, and Duke vs.
Georgia Tech.

. The Michigan-Colorado game
yesterday will probably go down
as one of the ‘94 season’s top five
games. It’s likely you didn’t see
the game, but you might have seen
the highlights — Colorado threw
a hail mary with a few seconds left
and pulled off the miracle, stealing
a 27-26 win from a Michigan team
who has already beaten Notre
Dame this season. The game was
reminiscent of the pass Doug Flutie
threw as Boston College stunned
Miami during in 1984. And speak-
ing of Miami, they got stomped
Saturday on their own field —

. something that hasn’t happened in
nine years. Washington scored 22
points in a five minute span during
the third quarter and blew open a
close game en route to an eighteen
point win. Finally, FSU beat Caro-
lina in a game where the Heels had
several chances to win, but failed
to capitalize and lost 31-18.

But let’s be truthful here —
the only purpose college footbal
serves is to provide the Cowboys
with even more talent than they
already have. We realize, how-
ever, that last Monday night’s
embarassing loss to Detroit de-
serves commentary. Defeats are
part of a season; often they make a
team hungrier in its quest for a
championship. Think back ten
games to Dallas’ Thanksgiving
Day loss to Miami. The Cowboys
blew that one but surged to win
their next ten games (excluding

preseason), including Super Bowl

XXVIII. Only once in NFL his-
tory has a team gone through sea-
son undefeated (the “72 Dolphins),
so we didn’t expect the Cowboys
not to lose at some point.

Now looking ahead, the “Boys
face the ‘Skins at RFK this Sunday
in the best rivialy in the NFL. In
the 68 games that the Cowboys
have faced the Redskins, Dallas

has been victorious in 37 of them. -

The biggest question this week is
whether Norval will feed Heath to
the devouring pass rushers of the
Dallas line. Look for turnovers
and time of posession to be key
factors in this matchup, and look
for-a- Dallas victory,.24-17.

Now to our weekly feature: Last
week’s answer: 1984, in the 12th
Round.

This week’s question: What two
teams have the Cowboys never
lost to?

IMAC Update: flickerball and 3-on-3

Connor leads women's flickerball, Sig Ep's Woodward leads men's

By Jonathan Whitcomb
Fall at Davidson means time

foranother IMAC season. For those
fresmen whohaven’t learned about

IMAC yet, the games sometimes
reflect the real sports world. The
true desire to play is frequently
tested when your hall conselor
pounds on the door at 12:45 fora 1
p.m. game, for example. But the
games also have even tougher mo-
ments like kicking a chair across
the sidelines after picking up your
fourth foul in the first three min-
utes of the championship basket-
ball game. In IMAC, there’s trash-
talking, side bets by hall counse-
lors and flickerball coaches, whin-

ing, fighting, and questionable of-
ficiating.

In the fall there are two major
sports: flickerball and three-on-
three basketball. Flickerball, as
most know, is Davidson’s very own
special version of football, and
three-on-three is just like street
ball, but the arena is the air-condi-
tioned Baker Sports Complex.

In women’s flickerball,
Connor is off to a strong start. In
the first week of play, they beat
Rusk 7-0 and squeaked by the tough
freshmen team of 4th Cannon in
OT. Kristen Kidd, a member of the
squad, complained about the lack

of upperclassmen competition, fig-
uring that most fresmen are just
playing to earn a PE credit.

In guy’s flickerball, there was
a semi-rematch between a couple
of teams in the freshman champi-
onship froma year ago. Four Kappa
Sig members of last year’s second-
place 3rd East hall took on a team
dominated by Sig Eps, led by QB
Brian Woodward of last year’s
Basement Belk team. Once again,
the Woodward team defeated the
3rd Easters to start their season off
with a win. ~

Finally in men’s three-on-
three, the team of David Wick,

Thomas Daniel, Chuck Grant, and
Walt G stands out from the rest.
They won their first game 21-14.
When asked about the game, 6’7”
Grant said that 40 minutes of var-
sity practice put him in the best
shape of his life. Grant, one of the
better players in the league, said,
“if we come to play we’ll beat

_ anyone.” A team led by Justin Pas-

chal and Ken May could provide
them with serious competition.

IMAC sports are a fun activity
for many Davidson students, and
they help bring many people from
across campus together, providing
good times for all involved.
