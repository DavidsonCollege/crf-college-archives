More Hypocrisy

The Student Council (we suppose
we have to wait until after elections
are held to call it a Senate) and Bill
Watson in particular performed a sig-
nificant service for a few students by
arranging Wednesday night’s open
meeting with trustee William A.
White, Dean of the Faculty Frontis
W. Johnston, and Dean of Students
Richard C. Burts.

More students could have benefited
from this bull session with represen-
tatives of two of the institutions that
are supposedly suppressing students,
but the vast majority of students evi-
dently decided to express their in-
volvement with the school by listening
to the basketball game with St.
Joseph’s University. Perhaps a few
were even studying.

As could be expected, however, all
was not sweetness and light. Senior
Rick Harrell, emphasizing several
times, that he was a ‘“‘reasonable” and
“rational” student, asked Burts some
very pointed questions about the cur-
fews that limit the hours during which
girls are allowed to be in the frater-
nity houses.

The justification cited for the cur-
fews has to be to one of the greatest
exmaples of hypocrisy that one could
find at this school.

Essentially the justification for the
curfew is that for the purposes of the
college's public relations we need to
be able to say that there is a rule in
existence designed to keep the stu-
dents from running around getting in-
to devilment all night long.

By setting the curfew at 5 a.m. Sat-
urday and 3 a.m. Sunday it is claimed
that the rule does not interfere with
the activities of the student. By that
time, the justification claims, the

student is ready to get rid of his date
for, a well-deserved rest in his own
ed.

Of more importance’ to us is the
hypocrisy involved in claiming one
thing about the reason for a rule’s
existence, and writing the rule so that
it is not intended to do what it is pur-
ported to do.

Certainly a regulation should be
written in such a manner as to make
allowances for extenuating circum-
stances; absolute maxims are notably
ineffective and unjust. However, when
a rule is not even meant to have the
effect claimed for it, it becomes not
a merciful regulation, but just a
hypocritical lie.

To be fair to the college it should
be noted that same attempt was also
made to justfiy the curfews in terms
of the in loco parentis doctrine. The

primary reason given for. the rule, .

however, was the one of public rela-
tions.

The curfew rule is itself not our
concern at the moment because it ap-
pears likely that it will be changed
soon. But it was educational for the
students attending the open discussion
to see such a blatent representation
of the college’s hypocrisy. _

Later, in discussing another issue
White made the point that a remark-
able difference exists between the
attitudes of a person while he is a
student and those he holds after he
graduates. ,

If this is so, then we hope we will
be excused as wild-eyed students for
desiring honesty on the part of a col-
lege that claims a Christian commit-
ment. After we graduate, it will pro-
bably be fun to look back at this edi-'
torial and laugh at such silliness.

A Brave Stand

Fulfillment and fright are two of the feelings that accompany the event
of seeing the actualization of an old myth.
For years, activists of all breeds have been satirizing the status quo boys
by saying they offer nothing more than a defense of apple pie and mother-
00

Finally we have seen it in print. “The Christian Science Monitor” yes-
terday carried a column in which the writer took the forthright position that

mothers are essential.

We would like ice cream on our pie, please.

Legitimate Concern

Both Dean of the Faculty Frontis
W. Johnston and trustee William A.
White made disturbing statements
Wednesday about what they consider-
ed to be the proper division of respon-
sibility in college policy making.

At the Student Council's open dis-
cussion, both said they feel there are
certain closed roles for students, fac-
ulty, and trustees. They said each .of
the three should listen to reasonable
advice from the other two, but they
should not have a vote on each other's
committees.

Dean Johnston noted that there are
exceptions to this general rule, speci-
fically that it is conceivable that stu-
dents have a direct voice on faculty
committees dealing with student af-
fairs, but seemed to concur, however,
that as a general rule, students do not
deserve voting privileges on faculty
or trustee committees simply because
the students are students.

Two assumptions seem to undergird
the position taken by White and John-
ston. The first is that there are col-
lege issues ‘that do not concern stu-
dents. Secondly, the men seem to be
saying that the contribution a student
makes to policy-making should depend
more on the reasonableness of his
argument than on the fact that he is
a sutdent. Neither assumption can be
accepted.

Education of students would seem
to be the entire function of this col-
lege. That the old “publish or perish”
issue has been of little importance
here reflects the college’s policy of
wanting its professors to be educators
instead of academicians. In its policy
sattement at least, education is broad-
ly interpreted by the college to mean
many things, ranging from the mem-
orization of chemical formulae to
mora! development. By any standard
of definition, however, education
would seem to include a concern for
students.

If the entire purpose of the college
is education, then anything it does
concerns students. This includes not
just the selection of texts, but also
the way the college pays its bills and
the professional merits of its faculty.

The second assumption underlying
the position taken by White and John-
ston can no more be accepted than
could the first. Students should make
a particular contribution to policy
formulation simply because they are
students.

_ It would be extremely difficult to
find anyone who would notice or un-
derstand student concerns better than
a student. It would be ridiculous to
maintain that there is anything re-
sembling a united student concern
that could be enunciated by a spokes-
man representing all. However, the
understanding a student gets of even
opposite student views, simply by vir-
tue of constant association, surpasses
that gained by trustees, or members
of the faculty and administration.

It has been argued that these views
Should not be given the honor of a
vote unless they are not only real but
also reasonable. However, it should be
noted that the validity or importance
of a factor does not depend upon its
reasonable statement. It is extremely
difficult to give a reasonable presen-
tation of any moral argument, but we
would hope that moral issues are not
therefore to be ignored.

Faults in the decision-making pro-
cess at Davidson would seem to stem
from the fact that an attempt is made
to over-compartmentalize the respon-
sibility. A merging of student, trustee,
and faculty committees would seem to
be more in order than an attemot to
justify limiting their membership.

And Again

We have said it before so we do not
want to belabor the point.

But in light of the faculty advisory
committee’s specifications for Presi-
dent Martin’s replacement, we need
to bring it up again.

Unless the Presbyterians have a
lot more pull up in heaven than we
think, they are not going to be able
to find a man who can carry out all of
the responsibility that has tradition-
ally been given to the president of the
college.

In other words, and once again, a
dual system of leadership is needed in
which one has primary responsibility
for, the academic leaders ip of the
college and the other, primary respon-
sibility for non-academic matters.

The two areas cannot and should
not be totally separated; the two men
will have to work closely with each
other. Sharing the job of running the
college, however, will make it possible
for both areas to be more effectively
administered than if one poor soul
gets stuck with it all.

EXAM FEEDBACK?

Dean Rusk Compared To Student

EO. NOTE: On Feb.
3, Welter Grant of CPS,
Gordon Yale of the Cofora.
do Dally, Dennis Wilen of
the Dally Pennsylvanian
and Dan Okrent of the
Michigan Daliy had oe
special Interview with Sec.
retary of State Dean Rusk.
Following is Walter Grant’s
account of the Interview.

By WALTER GRANT
Coliege Press Service

When Secretary of State
Dean Rusk talks about the
war in Vietnam, he sounds
like a college student who
has memorized his profes-
sor's notes for feedback on
an exam.

Rusk reiterates the words
professor, Lyndon
Johnson, and he offers noth-
ing new. If he is asked a
question for which he either
does not know the answer, or
does not want to give it, he
again plays the game of the
student; he beats around the
bush and answers something
else.

But Rusk has something
going for him which the
average student does not. He
gets to edit his exam after
the 50 minutes are up.

Rusk. in an interview last
week with CPS and three col-
lege editors, discussed the
war in Vietnam, the role of
the United States in interna-
tional affairs, the current
conflict between the U. S.
and North Korea, and how
anti-war protests at home
give encouragement to the
enemy.

He said nothing he has not
said hundreds of times be-
fore. It was impussible to pin
him down when he didn't
answer a question directlv.
and if a question which he
had ignored was repeated.
he merely reiterated the
same old cliches which mem
bers of the Johnson Admin‘s-
tration have been repea‘in«
for several years to ‘us'ify
the war.

Even so, Rusk reserved che
right to censor the to~t cf
the interview before it was

HEAVENS, NO!

released to the public. He did
edit his remarks, striking
out the strongest statement
he made.

The State Department took
extreme precautions during
the interview. A handful of
department officials sat in
the Secretary’s office, seem-
ingly admiring every sen.
tence he spoke. And the State
Department, of course. re-
corded the interview. refus-
ing to let other tape record-
ers in the room.

When the interview was
over, Rusk's aides comment-
ed that it was wonderful.
“He's an old pro,"’ one said.
“He sure knows how to
handle himself.'' Another
asked, ‘Isn't he just mar-
velous?"

Rusk is articulate and dedi.
cated, as he would have to
be to hold the office of Sec-
retary of State for seven
years. Completely sold on the
present U. S. policies in Viet-
nam and elsewhere, which he
certainly was instrumental

been a real dog...”

in developing, Rusk seems to.

enjoy defending policies, but
only as long as the questions
are not too pointed.

And despite the fact that
the United States is still
bombing North Vietnam.
Rusk insists that the John-
son Administration has done
all it can to encourage nego-
tiations to end the war.

“We're willing to negotiate,
without any conditions what-
ever. We'll sit down with
them, at sundown today, to
talk about peace, without
anybody doing anything, ex-
cept sit down at the table and
talk. Now they've rejected
that,”” he said.

“Now. the point is that
Hanoi has raised a major
condition for negotiations,”
Rusk said. ‘They say there
will be no talks until we stop
the bombing—they usually
say permanently and uncon.
ditionally." He emphasizes
that the United States did not
originally propose any condi-
tions, but since Hanoi did,
the U. S. found it necessary
to propose a counter condi-
tion—that North Vietnam not
take advantage of the bomb-
ing pause.

In response to the sugges-
tion that the United States
stop the bombing without any
conditions to test Hanoi’s
sincerity, Rusk said, “It’s
wholly irrational." He said
stopping the bombing without
conditions could endanger
the lives of thousands of
American soldiers.

In the interview, Rusk
commiented further on the
“{rrational’’ suggestion, but
these remarks were deleted
from the text, and the re-
porters, who had agreed to
abide by the edited trans.
cript, were unable to use it.

The Secretary offers little
hope that the United States
will initiate more moves
toward peace. “Now, if
everybody assumes that when
Hanoi says no, that’s the end
of the matter, therefore the
United States must- move
again, that we must some-
how take some new position,

Abolish The Council?

By JOHN WILLIAMS
Statt Writer

Who thinks the Student
Council ought to be abolish,
ed? Stand up and be recog-
nized. It is rumored that
there may be one candidate
for Student Government As-
sociation president who will
run on such a platform.

Who thinks the Student
Council is not
doing enough
for students?
Please, don't
every body
stand. at
once. It
seems to be
a majority.

W: Who does-
WILLIAMS n't really

care one way or the other?
Ah, I see there are a few of.
you also. I guess that's in-
evitable.

This year there has been
the usual criticism of the
council from several corners.
The members have not done
enough. What they have done
doesn't really affect the stu-
dents. What they have done
is wrong.

If we are to approach the
question logically, we must
step back from the immed-
fate issues and view the prob-
lem in a larger context.
How much power is really
inherent in a student gov-
ernment, especially the one
at Davidson? Why should stu-
dents care about what the
student government does?

Although some argue that

“=

students have gained a little
power through placement of
students on crucial commit.
tees, the council itself as a
governing body still has very
Httle power to affect student
life. For this reason, students
have never generated too
much enthusiasm about what
it does.

Perhaps the council hes
faited to consider such issues
es better exam schedules and
chapel policy, which it could
perhaps effect, but it could
provided the students with
such other small things as
an extra holiday and more

» vending machines.

It is not within the power
of the council to effect any
of these things by itself. In
each case, some member or
committee of the administra-
tion had to be contacted be.
fore any final action could
be taken.

So actually, aside from a
possible lack of communica-
tion between the council and

the students, the real fault

with the council is inherent
in its structure. It is essen-
tially a coordinating medium
through which things can be
channeled to various’ places
and committees.

But the gripes do not end
here. Some students claim
that things which are financ-
ed from she counell budget,
like the Student Exchange
trip to Haverford and fo the
IMAPCT symposium at Van-
derbilt, will do the students
no good.

Agteed, perhaps the stu-

dents who go should try to
put to work at Davidson what
they learn, but the role of the
council fs again as a coordin-
ating medium. Its responsibi-
lity is simply to provide the
opportunity and the money
for students to make such
trips.

Other students say the
council leaves many issues
untouched and does not stir
up the flames about those it
does consider. This is a valid
criticism, but it is one which
unfortunately results from
the apathetic atmosphere
which engulfs the campus.

Shoutd we abolish the coun.
cll beceuse it doesn’t do
enough? Heavens, Nol

There is a definite need
for the coordinating function
provided by the council. It
gives valuable experience to
council members, although
some fill their schedules with
so many other activities that
they have little time left for
council work.

tt also furnishes opportuni.
tles to students off the coun.
cil to serve on committees
and take advantage of things
such as iMPACT.

Will the new constitution
help? That remains to be
seen. But it is certain that
the situation will not change
anytime soon unless students
are willing to devote time
and responsibility to work-
ing with what they are inter-
ested in or are willing to take
elt gripes to council mem-

rs.

the end of that trail is simply
that we abandon South Viet-
nam. We're not going to do
that.”

Rusk indicated that the
role of the United States in
“protecting’’ other cpyuntsies
could be almast: unlimited.
“We have formal alliances
with more than 40 countries,”
he said. “I would say that,
if we are needed for the de-
fense of those countries,
we're available, and we'll
make good on our commit-
ments to those countries."
But he added, “We're not
the world’s policemen.”

Asked if the Vietnam sit-
uation will be a pattern for
U. S. involvement in other
countries, Rusk said, *‘You'll
have to ask the Communist
world, various parts of it,
whether they're going to
launch this kind of attack
against those with whom
we're allies. If they do, I
would think the answer is
yes, we will. If they don't,
then we'll have peace, but
the answer to that lies with
somebody else, not with us.”

Rusk referred to the North
Korean seizure of the Pueblo
as “an outrageous violation
of standard international
practice." Even if the ves-
sel had not been in interna-
tional waters—and Rusk in.
sisted that it was.— North
Korea did not have the right
to seize it, he said. (Two days
after the interview Rusk and
Secretary of Defense Robert

— [ooking

Packward

“HELL”

McNamara admitted that the
Administration could not be
sure whether or not the Pue-
blo violated North Korea's
waters.)

The Secretary said that
the Administration does not
see “direct indications that
the North Koreans have in
mind a large-scale invasion
of South Korea.”

On the question of dissent
at home against the John.
son Administration's policies.
Rusk says he has “‘no prob
lem" with free speech and
free assembly, but he em
phasizes that the “form of
dissent which tries to silence
other people is something to
which I object very strongly
indeed."’

Rusk also emphasizes that
Hanoi watches the debate in
the United States very close-
ly, and “there is no doubt
that they are’ encouraged by
the dissent in this country—
no doubt about it. Now. that
doesn’t mean that you forget
the First Amendment and
that you try to stop dissent.
but those who are expressing
dissent ought to be aware of
that."

He said he wishes anti-war
protesters ‘‘would at least try
to make it clear what it is
they want Hanoi to do to
make peace. If they will say
that we want Washington to
do the following, and we want
Hanoi to do the following,
that might help.”

AT

Not So Slick As Darby

‘al

As a result of that most peculiar institution known

as “rush - week,” about 90 percent of the freshman
class can now join their elders in the opportunities
afforded members of Davidson’s fraternity system.
These freshmen can now receive the national magazines
for the rest of their lives, go down to “the house” and
watch basketball games and flicks on the tube, and
most importantly, scoff up on the peanut butter and
jelly sandwiches set out after supper.

This was the first time I had seen rush from the
fraternity membe?’s side, inasmuch as my capitulation
to the system did not occur until last fall. Although my
position as a social affiliate means that I’m not in on
the mystic goodies, I did participate in the rush meet-
ings and parties. (I use the term “parties” in the loosest
sense possible.)

These rush meetings are, to say the least, interest-
ing. After careful observation, I have concluded that
there are three main qualifications which a prospective
pledge must meet in order to receive a bid. First, he
must be “a good guy” as evidenced by his avid interest
in the fraternity and in his ability to converse with ease
and grace. In addition to being a good conversation-
alist, he must “have a serious side.” Finally, and most
importantly, he must be a re-incarnation of somebody
already in the fraternity.

Actually, the system does seem to be lessening in
its excluseness. The large percentage of freshmen
pledging fraternities indicates among other things
i at the fraternities are bidding more people than they

ave in the past. This has its discouraging implications
