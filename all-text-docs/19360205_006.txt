Every Mid-Winters seems to
leave some characteristic tune. |
Last year it was “Blue Moon.”
Year before then, remember,
“The Easter Parade?” And this
time, “Lights Out.” We prefer
lights out. Who doesn’t? From
now on the big dances should
be dated BFM or AFM, before
or after Freddy Martin. The
figure is simple and effective,
but the decorations! Reminds us
of a window with the curtains
off. Each fraternity applauding
its own men. Cokey’s girl's
graceful walk. Ab Price walk-
ing very fast. Hindu, the peo-
ple’s choice.

crats instead of advisers,” and the

subsequent discussion brought out
a smouldering resentment against
existing forms of faculty control
and a wide demand for more free-

many directions
