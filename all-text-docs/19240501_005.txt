Fifteen Men Initiated
By Polity Club Friday

Ten Juniors and Five Sophomores

Selected Under New Membership
Plan

Fifteen new members were initiated
at the meeting of the International Re-
lations Club last Friday night. These
men were chosen from 29 who submit-
ted papers on subjects of international
interest. The 15 best papers were
chosen, regardless of the authors, the
judges not knowing who the authors
were. This new plan of electing mem-
bers was adopted this year, and does
away with the old system of election by
popular vote, thus making sure that
only men who are interested in interna-
tional affairs are chosen.

The papers submitted were all on sub-
jects which are before the public today,
and on which the future prosperity of
the world depends. Some of the sub-
jects were: The Labor Government in Great
Britain, The League of Nations, The Little

Entente, and several on Lenine and Tis
Policies.
Dr. J. M. McConnell spoke on the

World Court, outlining its organization
and activities.

At the next meeting of the club the
officers for next year will be chosen and
the matter of the Davidson Club becom-
ing a member of the Southern Associa-
tion on International Relations will be
acted upon. This is merely a matter of
form, as the club was represented at
ihe organization of the association, held
at Furman University in Greenville, S.C.

The men elected to membership last
Friday night were as follows:

Juniors—John D, Laws, T. A. Guiton,
T. S. McSwain, G. D, Rogers, P. M.
Patterson, C. S. Furches, J. H. Hols-
houser, R. T. Kimsey, M. W. Trawick, J.
R. Gudger.

Sophomores—A. H. Hollingsworth, R.
B. Parker, A, B. Williford,

Corporation would give the screen the!

entire series of Wright’s books, movie
fans anxiously awaited the first of the
series, and the opportunity to witness the
film adaption of it.

“When a Man’s a Man” was the story
chosen by the producers as the first to
be given everlasting life in celluloid
form. This gripping story of the great
Arizona ranch country is said by those
whose pleasure it has been to witness
private showings, to be one of the big
outstanding features of the year.

John Bowers, Marguerite de la Motte,
Robert Frazer, and a host of other cele-
brated screen artists will be seen in the

many portrayals of “When a Man’s a,

Man.” The production is in feature
fength, and is said to closely follow the
original story.

“When a Man’s a Man” is one of the
most popular of all Harold Bell Wright
stories. Its circulation is said to reach
over two million copies and a conserva-
tive estimate of those who have read the
story can be placed in the neighborhood
of the five million mark,

The story deals with the determina-
tion of a Cleveland “son of the rich” who
goes West to make a man of himself
after having been spurned by the girl
he planned to wed. The situations that
surround his entry into the desert and
cattle land, how he overcomes pride and
pitches in as a ranch hand, and after he
finally succeeds in gaifiing his goal, lead
to make up one of the most intense and
mteresting stories that
from the pen of that

With him he carried $25, a sum gained
from the sale of a hog, a calf and three
chickens, the whole of his possessions.

A few days later he arrived at Berea, |
Ky., and applied for entrance at Berea)

| College. At first the chance of entering
here seemed slight, but the dean of the
college, a kindly man, took a personal in-
terest in him, and found a place for him

in the fourth grade. The story from then,

on was one of sturdy application to his
work, and the consequent rise to his
| present position.

Graduated at Berea and Louisville The-
ological Seminary, Franklin returned to
his mountain section to work among his
own people. He has been instrumental in
the upbuilding of Crossnore School, with
which he is now connected, and in which
place he is doing a wonderful work with
the mountain boys and girls, assisting
those who first helped him to a higher
outlook on education, Dr. and Mrs.
, Sloop.

Briefly he described their school. It
\is supported mainly through the sale of
fold clothes to the mountain people.

Friends of the school send up boxes and
bales of old clothes and other second
hand articles, and these in turn are sold

to the mountain people, the proceeds go-!

ing to the upkeep of the school.

Closing with plea that everyone should
see the abilities lying dormant in these
some four million mountain people, he

asked that they be given a chance, and)

eral of the men who were at Blue Ridge last
summer are planning to return this June.

In the Intercollegiate contests during past
conferences Davidson has always rated right
at the top. Especially in tennis and baseball
the Wildcats have taken off the honors.

Every member of next year’s cabinet is
hoping to attend, and several of this year’s
are making plans to be there. About 25 men
are expected to go from Davidson. The dis-
cussion of campus problems and student work
will be invaluable to any man in school, es-

HENRY CAVENDISH
1731-1810
English chemist and physicist,
of whom Biot said, ‘‘He was
the richest of the learned and
the most learned of the rich.
Hislast great achievement was
his famous experiment to de-
termine the density of the earth.

In this age of electricity
the General Electric
Company has blazed
the trail of electrical pro-
gress. You will find its
monogram on the giant
generators used by
lighting com panies;
and even on the lamps
and little motors that
mean so much in the
home. It is a symbol)
of useful service.

water from gases

Henry Cavendish, an eccentric millionaire
recluse, who devoted his life to research,
was the discoverer of the H and the O in
H.O. In fact he first told the Royal Society
of the existence of hydrogen.

He found what water

was by making it

himself, and so became one of the first of

the synthetic chemists.

Cavendish concluded that the atmosphere

contained elements then unknown.

His

conclusion has been verified by the dis-
covery of argon and other gases.

The Research Laboratories of the General
Electric Company have found a use for
argon in developing lamps hundreds of
times brighter than the guttering candles
which lighted Cavendish’s laboratory.
