Chance at .500 season

Booters win two straight

It’s been a busy, but satisfy-
ing week for Davidson soccer.

The Wildcats started a tough
three-game home stand against
The Citadel last Friday. Al-
though the team lost a well
played game, 2-0, they gained
some important insights.

“The Citadel game was an
example to the kids,’’ said
coach Karl Kremser. ““They saw
how The Citadel players kept
after the ball, how intensely
they played the entire game.”

The lesson was well learned

as the Cats showed against
Baptist Saturday. The team
played their best soccer of the
year.
“Tt was an hour and a half of
pure ecstasy. Especially the
overtime,” smiles Kremser. ‘I
wish I had it on film.”

Through time Baptist
was able to hold Davidson to a
tie, forcing two ten minute

overtime periods.

'They probably wished they
hadn’t. Davidson exploded for
three more goals and an impres-
sive victory.

Coming off the win the team
was psyched up for arch-rivals
UNCC Tuesday. The game was
very physical with one ejection
(against UNCC) and three yel-
low cards (two to UNCC, one to
Davidson). ;

Senior Captain Joel Shirk
scored Davidson’s first goal at
42 minutes, 11 seconds into the
first half.

Freakishly, the.team’s second
goal came at 42 minutes, 11
seconds into the second half off
the foot of Doug Schuessler.

While the team did not play

as well as they did against

Baptist, they now know what it
takes to win and are willing to
make the effort.

“This could be the turning
point, not only of the season but
of soccer at Davidson,’’ empha-

sized Kremser.

“I’m sure we’ll have relapses;
but I can’t see anything but
good ahead of us,’’ added
Kremser.

Shirk agrees. ‘‘A week ago
the team was falling apart. We
beat Catawba but we still got
yelled at (by Kremser).

With these last three games
things have turned around com-
pletely. ‘It’s fun to play ag-
ain,”’ remarks Shirk.

Shirk has special reasons for
happiness: “I’ve never been on
a Davidson soccer team that’s
won two games in a row, much
less five in a season. Now we
have a chance to be .500.. It’s
great—all I can do is smile.”

Davidson carries its 5-6-1
record-te Atlanta this weekend
to play Emory and Georgia
State.

John Hoots rocketed into
stardom last weekend and the
prospects for: Davidson’s Har-
riers are suddenly a great deal
more cheerful.

The Wildcats placed 9th out
of 13 teams in the annual State
Cross Country Championships
in Raleigh, N.C., close behind
Southern Conference rivals
Western Carolina and Appala-
chian State. Hoots’ coming of
age was the essential ingredient
in the team’s~best-showing-—of
the year.

FRESHMAN JOHN Hoots displays his regained form on the

cross-country course. Hoots lead a strong showing by Davidson
runners against a fine field in Saturday's N. C. State meet.

Hoots, a 5'11” freshman from
Winston-Salem, was one of the
finest high school runners in
North Carolina and came to
Davidson accompanied by a
host of brilliant credentials.
Until Saturday, Hoots had run
solidly, but was often unable to
maintain his ambitious initial
pace; usually he had clung to
the leaders for the first few
miles but then found himself
dropping back in the field.

In the State Meet, however,
Hoots took off in 4:57 for the
first mile,came-through two
miles in 10:03, and managed to

retain his position splendidly
for the remainder of NC State’s
10,000 meter course, finishing
34th in a remarkable 33:16.

Hoots’ arrival at the forefront
gives Davidson what may be its
strongest top five in history,
and the team is justifiably
optimistic about its chances in
the Southern Conference
Championships November 4 in
Charleston.

Doug Horn was three places
behind Hoots in 33:23, Bart
Landess finished 46th and Greg
Burnard set a personal best to
finish 54th. John Davis (56th)
and John Rees (71st) completed
Davidson’s contingent. A pain-
ful Achilles heal tormented
Terry Morrow during the race,
and the sophomore was unable
to finish.

The Wildcats hope to surprise
Western Carolina, the Citadel,
and possibly even Appalachian
State in the conference Race,
and if everyone continues to
improve, Davidson could con-
ceivably move up a few notches.
