Masquers Present .

Comic, “Real Mr. Q”

Second Production of Year
Staged in Shearer

Playing before an audience of some

thirty or forty students, last Monday
night in Shearer Hall, The Red and
Black Masquers presented the second

of their one-act plays, “The Real Mr. Q.”

The cast consisted of three students,
two sophomores and one freshman:
Lemuel Williams, Jack Mathews and John
D. McConnell, named in their respective
order. “The Real Mr. Q" is a good
comic mystery in which the three roles
are, a thief bent on robbing a doctor's
office, a psuedo-detective who has the
same evil ends in view, and a man who
poses as the doctor who owns the office
but who is shown at the end to be the
real Mr, Q; Williams took the part of
Mr. Q; Mathews was the thief; and Mc-
Connell’s role was that of the detective.

At one or two places in the performance
one of the actors gave evidence by a slight
forgetfulness, or a lack of preparation;
but it is understood that he was acting
as substitute for the regular man for
the part who had been detained at home,
so that the understudy had only a very
short while in which to learn his lines.

The performance required some twenty
or twenty-five minutes for production.

J. Z. Preston, who was elected’ this
fall as the head of the organization, an-
nounces that in the future the Red and
Black Masquers are planning to put on
one or two performances which may at-
test the fact that there is some histrionic
ability in the school.

LYON SPEAKS
ON EVOLUTION

Ministerial Band Hears Evolution
Characterized as Dogma

The speaker at the ministerial band
meeting last Sunday was Dr. S. C. Lyon,
well known member of the faculty. Dr.
Lyon gave a very interesting and helpful
talk on “The Dogma of Evolution.”

In his talk he pointed out that diffi-
culties will arise in the relation of science
and religion. Most religion is dogmatic,
but a part is based on evidence of the
Resurrection. He also spoke of the rela-
tion of the dogma of evolution to biology
and religion. Paul realized the danger
of this thing and made mention of it in
the third chapter of the second epistle to
Timothy. He answers the query, what
is the theory of evolution? by referring
to the first four words of the Book of
Genesus, Science cannot go behind the
beginning. The theory of evolution is a
dogma, amore nearly an hypothesis. It
gives more truble in psychology and phil-
osophy. It is a mistake that man is des-
cended from the apes, they both have a
common ancestry. In relation to biology
it is a working hypothesis which has never
been proved. Many scientists do not be-
lieve it but recognize its value. A theory
is not science but is useful in its power
of suggestion. Theories change. Its re-
lation to religion is the same as the atomic
theory. -Religion and science are both
hased on faith. Time and space cannot be
defined but are based on faith.

Testimony is more certain than a word
that expresses a concept. The testimony
of the Life of Christ is as certain his-
torically as any other history. It has
often been attacked but never shaken.

Cling closely to the faith that comes
through this testimony and be not led as-
tray by the actions of science, so called.

R. O. T. C: STUDENTS

(Continued from page 1)

Dr. John Melton, PhD, assistant to Dr.
Frazer Hood in the Department of Psy-
chology was called on by the defense ’as
an expert on Somnambulism. He was
accepted as such by the court. He said
that such a.case as Mr. Flythe’s was en-
tirely posible and gave examples of like
cases. He said that often in a trance
akin to hypnosis a person gives expres-
sion to a suppressed desire. He is un-
conscious of this in his conscious mind
and cannot be held responsible for his
action while asleep under the influence
of this desire. The fact that Mr. Flythe
is very fond of guns seems to point to
this theory.

The accused chose to make a full state-
ment under oath. He verified his room-
mate’s statements and said he had no
knowledge of his alleged act.

The defense counsel stated that he rest-
ed his case on the temporary irresponsi-
bility of the accused and cited a similar
ase in the British court where the accused
was. acquitted. The trial judge advocate
rested his case on the U. S. common law
which holds a sane man responsible for
acts which he has been proved to have
committed. The assistant trial judge ad-
vocate asked the court to consider that
the defense had given no. explanation
for the use of a flash light by the accused.

The court adjourned to make its de-
cision. When the court had fild back into
the room, Cadet Major King first ex-
plained for the sake of the serious mind-
ed that Mr. Flythe/had really stolen no
gun, then’ he rendered the decision of the
court. “Not guilty’, said Cadet Major
King.

Spain Will Be Mecca
~ Of Student Tourists

Student globe trotters have a new ex-
perience to look forward to in 1929—an
experience at once pleasurable and profit-
able. Spain, land of sunshine and flowers,
castles and color, legend and romance;
Spain, once Queen of the Seas and su-
preme among nations; Spain whose gal-
leons and gold, grandeur and pomp once
were the envy of the civilized world is
making a new bid for leadership in arts,
industry and commerce. All roads will
lead to Spain in 1929,

The world which has heard little re-
cently of the land of Castile and Ara-
gon will again visit her Mediterranean
shores, enjoy her hospitality, her blue
skies and her Latin beauty. In the gay
and lovely city of Sevilla, and in Barce-
lona, industrial and commercial capital of
Spain, will be staged two great Interna-
tional Exhibitions of Art, Athletics, In-
dustry and Commerce under the auspices
of H. M. the King, Don Alfonso XIIT.
In the wide halls and golden galleries of
splendid palaces of marble and colored
tile—legacy of the Arabs and the Moors—
will be displayel the artistic effort and
scientific genius of world peoples.

In significance and magnitude the Ex-
hibitions represent the most important
economic events staged since the World
War. Nearly seventy-five million dollars
has ben set aside bythe Government and
by Spain’s leading industrialists to the
success of the venture for which plans
have been under way ten years. Seviila
will particularly emphasize arts, while
Barcelona—city of merchants will stress
the Industrial. In the great Industrial
zone, business men from all over the
world will display their products, Ameri-
ca being an important contributor. Con-
siderable emphasis will be given to the
application of science to industrial ends.

Sports of the world will be featured
in international contents in the immense
Exhibition Stadium, while everything re-
lating to the educational, technical and
commercial aspects of the Sporting World
will be gathered together in the Sports
Pavilion in Barcelona.

A Greek. Theater built
with pure classic art in a quarry of great
antiquity, cut from stone of fiery colors
will dramas another day.
Spanish festivals will be celebrated in
Sevilla with all the gorgeous pageantry
and colorful splendor which is Spain, A
luminous Fountain, more than
the famous fountain of Versailles, will
rain a glittering shower of stars in the
Plaza Espanol.

Two events of international significance
will enliven the Exhibition calendars—
the -First International Light Fair, at
which light and its importance in all as-
pects of human activity will be featured,
and the International Press Congress to be
attended by the world’s leading’ publishers,
journalists and publicists.

Artists and architects, students and
teachers, philosophers and economists, the
industrialists and the trader, the manufac-
turer and the merchant from the Old
World and the New will meet/next year
in Barcelona and Sevilla. Bducational in
purpose, international in scope and univer-
sal in appeal, Spain’s two great Exhibi-
tions will be the goal next year of people
in every fieldsof endeavor and interest—

vites the youth of America to New Spain,
whose shadows of a glorious past rise her

eager, ambitious, successful New Spain.

Doctor Gives Report

On Results Ot “Flu”

Mecklenburg Medical Society
Hears Dr. Laughinghouse
; Report

Dr. Charles Laughinghouse, secre-
tary of the N, C, Board of Health at-
tended the recent conference of Public
Health officials at Washington, where
health officers from all sections of the
U. S. met to study with the Surgeon
General, the recent epidemic of influ-
enza.

Dr. Laughinghouse made a repost to
the Mecklenburg Medical Sacicty on
January 14th and gave the following
“esume of the meeting.

Ist. The present epidemic exceeds
any since 1918, and is in every part
of the U. S., but least of all in the
New England section. It was at its
worst in the far west and in the middie
west.

2nd. It has now past its peak and
there seems little danger of a second
ary wave, but the crest of the pneu-
monia wave comes. two wecks after
the peak of the influenza,

3rd. The death rate the past two
wks in the U. S. has been about
double that of the normal.

4th. The absolute cause of in-
fluenza is unknown; that is, the in-
fecting organism has not been isolated:

5th. Vaccination has not proven to
be of benefit, though Dr. Rosenau, of
the Mayos, takes the opposite view and
claims that it of benefit, though not
absolutely a preventative.

6th. The best treatment so far jis
rest in bed during the attack, and rest
during a long period of convalescence.

The Treasury Repartment has been
asked for an appropriation to carry on
the research work in this line.
