Krawciw Discusses
Ukraine 's History

By Ted Richardson

Retired U.S. Army Major
General Nicholas Krawciw visited
the Davidson campus ‘this past
weekend. He spoke to faculty and
students at the Carolina Inn on
Thursday evening and was the
Guest of Honor at the ROTC Mili-
tary Ball Friday night. General
Krawciw is presently serving as a
consultant to the new independent
Ukrainian Republic. Krawciw
himself is a native of the Ukraine,
though his family moved from thete
when he was only four years old.

A majority of the General’s
talk Thursday centered on the
tumultuous history of the Ukraine,
a region which has continually
striven for its independence from
the Soviet Union. Besides a brief
period of independence following
the First World War, the Ukraine
has been forcibly annexed to Rus-
sia for over three hundred years.
This, however, changed dramati-
cally with the August 24 coup

against Soviet occupation of the

Ukraine.

The Ukrainian coup coincided
with a general meltdown of the
Soviet Union in Eastern Europe, a
series of momentous events which
General Krawciw sces as “estab-
lishing a brand new geo-political
reality,” What will become of this
newreality according toKrawciw,
is quite uncertain. The Ukraine,
no less than any of.the other liber-
ated republics in Eastern Europe,

Krawciw posed the question
to his audience Thursday, “Will
there be a new Marshall Plan?”
Krawciw assured that “You can
expect Ukrainia to lean West” in
its plea for monetary aid. The
possibility that the Ukraine might
sell its military hardware to raise
money concerns Krawciw, espe-
cially the thought of an open sale
of nuclear arms. However, the
General believes strongly that the

Towns in North
Mecklenburg Debate

Over Public Libraries

By Susan Sheffield

Cornelius, Huntersville and
Davidson are concerned over the
fate of their branch libraries,

The Public Library Board of
Mecklenburg County proposed a
new regional library be built in
order to provide better services

id easier accessibility for the
entire North Mecklenburg Area.

"The location would be next to the
mall that is being built beside the
Northeross community between
Comelius.and Huntersville on Sam
Furr Road. The land is a donation
by Crosland-Erwin Associates, de-
velopers of Northcross. ;

On January 16, a public meet-
ing was held to calm some of the
outrage that has been generated.
Every group inthecommunity was
represented, eens schoolchil-

dren, who spoke on behalf of their
library.

The main concern was that the
collections in all the branches
would be reduced to virtually noth-

ing, which would render them ~

useless to their patrons and proba-
bly result in the discontinuing of
the branch facilities. Forexample,
the Davidson library is the most
‘used branch in the county per cap-
ita, but with relocation of the books,
daycares, the elderly and school-
children would notbe within walk-
ing distance as they are now.
The Library’ Board has met to
assess the community opinion and
has’ come up with some recom-
mendations for the County Coun-
cil. One is that the collections’
