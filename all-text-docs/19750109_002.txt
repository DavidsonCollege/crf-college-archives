Aid With Personal Problems

By CHARLIE SHEPHERD
Staff Writer

Within a few months, David-
son students may be able to
telephone or go to an in-
formation center on campus
where they can find up-to-date
materials on sex, drugs, and
possibly legal help.

The proposed center will be
equipped with first aid

working on the idea of the in-
formation-referral center, in-
cluding Dean of Students Will
Terry, Counselor Meredith
Hall, sophomore Karl
Goodhouse, and SGA President
John Munce. Members of the
Faculty Counseling and
Guidance Committee also are
involved with the project.

As the center is now planned,
a student will be in the office
from about 10 p.m. till one or
two each night. The student
will take calls and will be
available in case anyone needs
information or just wants to
comeandtalk. _

“I would hope that we could
get people to man these things
who are very sensitive to people

‘who are uptight,’ explained

Terry.

However. Terry cautioned
against the idea that the
student-manager will be
providing psychological sér-
vices.

“We don,t want a lot of amateur
psychologists over there

‘Munce hopes that the student
operators can be given some
basic training in first aid and in
talking with other students
about problems, but believes

that the center should be
predominantly a, referral and
information center, Munce also
hopes that students working at
the center can receive pay.

By ANNE PELFREY

Locking Chambers during the
night is a possibility being
debated by several members of

to Director of the Physical

option of closing Chambers, but
have not yet made any definite
plans to do so,”’ said Meetze.

college President Samuel R.

question of closing Chambers
by stating the library was built
to seat half the student body and
that should be adequate seating

Fields Foretells WDAV News
Before Storming White House

By STEVE JOHNSON
Asst. Features Editor

The man who rammed his car
through a gate on the White
House grounds Christmas Day,
Marshall L. Fields, had
declared a week earlier in a let-
ter to the WDAV Newsroom
that he would ‘denounce’ his
U.S. citizenship and seek
political asylum in a Near East
country, according to WDAV
News Director Rob Shearer.

D.C.) dropout. did not suggest

in the letter that he intended to’

crash through the White House
gate and demand a meeting
with Pakistan’s ambassador to
this country. aos

Shearer laid the letter aside
as a prank by one of his friends,
at first, but he realized its
significance as he was browsing
through the “Atlanta Con-
stitution’’ the morning after
Christmas.

An article concerning an in-
truder on the grounds of the
White House on Christmas Day
caught Shearer’s eye, as the in-

’ truder bore the same name as

the author of the “prank let-
ter."

Shearer indicated that he was
“‘stunned and puzzled’ as to
why Fields had chosen to
forewarn WDAV in particular.
The article mentioned only two
other organizations across the

~. nation that had received such

letters.

Later that day, Shearer
telephoned the Atlanta Secret
Service to report that he had
received a letter from Fields
expressing his intentions. That
bureau requested that he notify
Secret Service in Charlotte,
when he returned to Davidson,
where the letter of intent had
remained during the Holidays.

At printing, Shearer had not
informed the Charlotte bureau
that he received the letter from
Fields.

Special Agent in charge of the
Secret Service in Charlotte
Talmadge W. Bailey, explained

that it is a common practice by :

someone planning sucn a con-
frontation to contact various
phases of the media to promote
and solicit support for his
cause.

Concerning the question of
why Fields chose to notify
Davidson College, Shearer
suggested that ‘the was trying
to get the message across _ to
college students.’’ Fields
forewarned numerous
organizations, including a chain
of South African newspapers
and Washington area reporters.

The letter, termed by
Shearer, ‘‘disjointed,’’ was ac-
companied by photographs,
news clippings, and documents
of the Agency of International
Development. |

Fields, an applicant for
membership in the Islamic par-
ty in North America, the official
term for the Black Muslims,
declared in the letter, ‘I have
returned to break crosses and to
kill swine, I have returned as
promised. To the Western
world, I am the messiah to
those who wish to believe....”’

Fields’ father had served as
an advisor on educational and
industrial areas in Iraq, Libya,
and Sudan--all predominantly
Moslem and Arabic-speaking
countries, Upon his death last
spring he was deputy chief of
education for Southeast Africa
in the Agency for Interhational
Development,
