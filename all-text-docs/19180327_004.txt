STUDENT BODY DIVIDED
INTO NINE GROUPS

The new plan which Dr. Martin pro-
posed, seeking the co-operation of the
student body in bringing up the quota of
new students for Davidson next fall, will
work splendidly if every student does his
part. The student body was divided into
geographical groups, each under faculty
leadership, which, thru personal corre-
spondence, will try to interest prospect-
ive students in Davidson, The students
from North Carolina were divided into
three groups, Eastern, Western and Cen-
tral; students from South Carolina into
two groups; students from Tennessee
and Mississippi, compose one group:
Georgia, one; Virginia, one; and stu-
dents from all other States not previously
mentioned compose a ninth group. Each
group has elected a steering committee,
which works with the faculty leader.

Each student is requested to prepare
a list of prospective college students,
whom he knows and to whom he will
write a personal letter. This list of
names with addresses will be furnished
the faculty leader thru the steering com-
mittee. All information attained in re-
plies to the letters will also be furnished

the faculty leader. Mach student is also
requested, when he goes home, to ‘‘fol-
low up” his letter by speaking to the boys
to whom he has written.

DR. CLARK SPEAKS ON ,
“THE DUAL SELF"

Dr. B. O. Clark, of Salisbury, N. C.,
addressed the Y. M. C. A. mecting last
Thursday night, his subject being “’Vhe
Dual Self.” “The keynote of his address
was Romans 7:19: ‘“Vhe good that |
would, | do not: bur the evil which 1
would not, that Edo.” The speaker ad-
vanced five propositions: first, that man’s
greatest cnciny is himself; secondly, the
worst thing that can happen to a man is
to be left to himself; thirdly, man’s
greatest duty is to fight himself; fourth:
ly, the greatest boon a man can have is

it deliverance from himself; and fifthly,

a man’s greatest investment is the invest-
ment of himself. Dr. Clark then show-
ed how Christ delivers a man from him-
self and teaches hiny to invest himself.
VThruout his discourse, Dr. Clark ex-
plained his thot with many illustrations.
The meeting was thoroly enjoyed by all
present, for the helpfulness and original:
ity of the talk was refreshing.

The new Y. M. C. A. Cabinet has
been announced and consists of the fol-
lowing men: J. He Miller, Jr. Ar
tendance: W. M. Currie, Bible Study;
R. BF. McClure, Christian Activities;
Ir, A. Woods, Devotional; J. W. Mce-
Alister, Fresh Reception; C. W. Worth,
Mission Study; S. M. Gilbert, Mission

President; C. W. Worth, Vice-Presi-
dent; D. M. Chalmers, Secretary, and
