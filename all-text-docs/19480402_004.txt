“FUN AND FANCY FREE”

Walt Disney has done it again.
That is he has done the Américan
public again. Mr, Disney says that
he found the ethical justification
for his misdeed in the time honored
golden rule of “Do others before
they have a chance to do you.”

But if Mr. Disney has swindled
the public in “the ‘content 6f his
animated drama, he can certainly
not be accused of defrauding if one
looks at his cartoon from the stand
point of “title value.” The value of
the name-can hardly be calculated.
Following .the time honored cus-
tom established by the clergy, I
shall try to bring out three points
which prove the worth of the head-
ing under which this film is pre-
sented to the world.

To begin: Fun—the producers
must certainly have had fun enough
while. producing this movie. They
should have even had some left
over for their old age. Attacking
this point from another angle: It
iscertainly funny that a man would
use his timre to produce or that
adult American audiences would
spend their money to see such a
picture.

Secondly: Fancy—the production
is certainly fanciful. In fact there
are few things more fanciful than
Charlie McCarthy and “Jack and
The Bean Stalk” combined in one
story.

The two parts of the title pre-
viously discussed were certainly ap-
propriate, but. the word “free” is

J even more so. It is significant be-

cause this is exactly the price that
should be charged for admission to
the showing of this cinematic pro-
duction, — r

“RIFE RAFE”

For those un-initiated in geo-
graphical lore, Riff Raff is a sort
of ubangi kayak. The members of
this noble African tribe use these
nautical wonders for hunting pur-
poses as much as their northern
cousins use their ships of skin and
bones. In faet, their quarry is very
similar to that sought by the Eski-
mo. These sable-skinned hunters
paddle their riff-raffs up and down
the famous river Stynx in search of
the wary koroseal, Aside from its
elastically delicious flesh, the koro-
seal is also ’ especially valuable be-
cause of... its beautiful hide. All
Ubangi tribes keep themselves well
supplied with tobacco, snuff, nose
rings and neon signs by selling the
pelts in wholesale lots to B. F.
