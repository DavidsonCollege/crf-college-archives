ming and diving team (5-7) proved that
they are in top form as they look to

drowned out Georgia Tech by 36 points,
while both. the men’s and women’s
squads routed the College of Charles-

ton by 45 and 51 points respectively.

Wildcats fall to Georgia Southern...miss “golden opportunity”

By MIKE ANDERSON
Sports Editor

Davidson students would be well-
advised to avoid wearing any Georgia
Southern sweatshirts in the vicinity of
the women’s basketball office this week.

The Southern Conference rival
continued to serve the role of the pro-
verbial thorn in the side of John Filar,
knocking off his Lady Wildcats last
night by a score of 67-63.

Georgia Southern 67

Davidson College

““Tn my opinion, Georgia South-
ern isthe mostathletically talentedteam
in the conference,” commented Coach
Filar. “This was a golden opportunity
for us tonight, with them missing a
dominant player (junior forward
Tondra Warren, the team’s second-
leading scorer), and we couldn’t take
advantage of that.”With the victory,
Georgia Southern shattered the Wild-
cats’ nine-game home winning streak.
Ina sort of cruel irony, it happened less
than three weeks after the Lady Eagles
broke Davidson’s running seven-game
win streak back on January 6. Georgia

Debbie Leonard, FoxSports:

“It’s not easy to build
an athletic program at
the SAT capital of the
world, but John Filar
has done just that at
Davidson.”

Southern has now won six consecutive
at Belk Arena, and 11 out of 14 against
Davidson in the 1990s.

Powered by a 12-0 run in the sec-
ond half, the Lady Eagles overcame a
two point half-time deficit to procure
their eighth conference victory of the
season. “‘We held Georgia Southern,
one of the top team’s in the conference,
to 39% from the floor and we still lost
the game,” lamented Filar. They had
ten more shot attempts than we had, and
that’s a result of our 27 turnovers.”

The game was knotted 63-63 with
eleven seconds to play, but ended in
precisely the same fashion as the team’s
previous contest; with Georgia South-
ern scoring the game’s final six points.

Jen O’Brien picked up a clutch
defensive rebound off a Lady Eagle
missed lay-up with twenty seconds to
play. The league’s assist-leader drove
down-court and into the lane before
dishing off as pass to a slashing Jessica
Montrella, who sank a lay-up for an
apparent two point lead.

But, with a whistle that brought
the Belk Arena crowd to a standing
fury, the referee slapped O’Brien with
an offensive foul after the release of the

For the first time in more
thana decade, two NCAA tour-
nament teams will meet in the
following season’s SoCon ac-

Charleston enters
game with a perfect SoCon

for the year, to the line with two shots.
Perry hit the first of two free throws,
and her teammate Tori Durrett se-
cured the offensive rebound before be-
ing fouled by O’Brien.

Davidson failed to regain posses-
sion of the basketball while Georgia
Southern knocked down three more free
throws in the closing seconds for the
four point victory.

“Comes down to 27 turnovers,”
said Filar. ““That’s where we lost the
game. Of those 27 turnovers, I'll bet
you 24 of them were unforced. That’s
27 possessions that we got nothing out
of, and you can’t win a game that way.”
Georgia Southern head coach Rusty
Cram was without the services of
Tondra Warren, his team’s second-
leading scorer. The junior forward will
miss.at least three weeks due toa stress
fracture in her right foot.

Adding to the anguish of the loss
was the knowledge that a victory over
Georgia Southern last night could have
lifted Davidson into second place in the
Southern Conference, within as little as
asingle game from league-leading UNC
Greeensboro. :

Instead John Filar and his Wild-

cats fall to 6-5 in the conference (11-7
overall), and their hopes of ascending
into the upper tiers of the standings in
time for tournament seedings now re-
main primarily in the team’s ability to
win on the road. That’s not the most
promising of predicaments, Consider-
ing that the Lady Wildcats have yet to
prove themselves on the road this sea-
son. Though they knocked off Wake
Forest at the Joel Coliseum early in the
season, Davidson has won only one
conference game on the road thus far.
Their next three games, and five of their
last seven, will be played outside the
friendly confines of Belk Arena. David-
son travels to East Tennessee State on
Saturday before hosting conference-
newcomer College of Charleston this
Monday night at 7 PM.
