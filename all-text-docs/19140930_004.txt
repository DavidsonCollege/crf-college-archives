men whomWilliams brings with him will
put up a mighty tussle to win, pur—will
thes? We must wait and sce. Ir will
be a game that will go down in the an-
nals of the toat ball history as a mighty,
terrific conflict. When the whistle blows,
ir will be worse than Germany vs. the
‘Alhes. ‘his game will mark the real
revival ot “that old time pep.”

_
OFFICIALS FOR SATURDAY.
The officials for the Clemson David-

son game will be fF. V. Samson. of Roa-

noke, Va., referee, Samson refereed the

North Carolina and Wake Forest games

With absolute satisfaction last Fall, He

is one of the best officials in the South.

H. H. Varner, former University 0

Virginia star, will most probably umpire.

SCRUBS TO ‘TAKE TRIPS.

The Faculty has passed a ruling al-
lowing the second team half, as many
davs off the Hill as the Varsity. “Phis
will give them at least two or three
good trips. ‘The schedule will be an-
nounced in a few days. “This team: cer-
tainly deserves consideration, for it ts
the sacrificing of this team, that prepares
the Varsity tu. win games. Tt is nothing
but right that ther should have some
good ‘trips, and Manager Kluttz says
that they will be sure to have several
before the end of the season. “The best
trip will come near the end of the season
as a reward to the faithful.

THE FIRST GAME.

The Piedmont tedm was a great dis-
appointment to everyone in view of the
fact that it was so weak. ‘The final score
was 115 too. The Varsity started it
off, then the Scrubs, and finally — the
Squirts played. Every man in uniform
was used, and all showed ap well, the
Davidson men scoring at will.

“THE OLD PEP” REVIVES.

Each afternoon at the field while the
Sauad is hard at work the vell leaders.
Johnson and Copeland, are leading the
team in vells to wet ready for Clemson
Saturday. “he “pep” and spirit of the
student body at Clemson last Fall was!
great—bur the Davideon student body
can beat jt. Davidson should show the
Clemson “Team what the “old Davidson
pen” really means: they have heard of
the. spirit, with which the student: body
here backs up the teams; now they are
here to see it—its up te every loval stu-
dent. to do his part. A big, real “pep”
meeting will be held in’ Shearer Hall
Fridav night, just after supper. Fvery-
one ought to be there.

BRIGHT POSPECTS FOR
BASKET BALL ‘TEAM.

At a meeting of the Athletus Assocta-
tion last Thursday morning, J. C. Me-
Donald was elected manager of the team
for the ensuing vear. He has arranged
for several games, but no definite sched-
ule has yet been made. At least three
or four good games will be played on
the Hill. Heretofore this has. been al-
most impossible on account of the ‘in-
sufficiency. of the court in the “gym.”
This difficulty is being removed and a
pood basket ball court will soon be in
shape.

Coach Fetzer is verv much interested
in all branches of athletics, and has had
much experience in the coaching — of
basket ball teams, and with the material
here, and the remodeled court, there is
every reason to be assured that David-
son will this vear be a strong competitor
for State championship. Trinity, Caro-
lina, A. & M.. and Wake Forest have
for years been stressing this branch of
athletics. Basket ball is a callege major
sport and Davidson will simply be at-
taining to the place this vear where she
is due to be.

Dr. Sentell spent the week-end at his
home in Tennessee.

WEATHERFORD SPEAKS
TO STUDENT BODY.

(Concluded from page 1)
tory, ‘science, or as a great repository of
truth alone, but should look on the Bible
as the experience book of humanity in
the laboratory of God. It is a book with
iu message of reality, genuineness and
courage:

Immediately after the night service
the Bible Study Committee canvassed
the student body in the interest of Vol-
untary Bible Study on Sunday mornings.
As a result 202 men have enrolled so
far. Last Sunday morning the classes
organized, and next Sunday they hold
their first study at 9:45.

Dr. Weatherford while here met the
Association committees, laid many new
plans before them, and jnstilled his con
tagious enthusiasm. At a meeting of the

{| Cabinet he made the following proposi-

tion, which probably will be accepted in
the near future: He said that if David-
son would raise $15,000 he would raise
$25,000 for a new Y. M. C. A. build-
ing. ‘This is one of the greatest needs of
Davidson at the present time, and such
a proposal ought to find a ready response
very soon. Nothing definite can be an-
nounced as yet, however.

Next week several Davidson men will
attend the North Carolina Student Con-
ference at Elon College.

Next Thursday night Prof. A. Currie
will speak to the Association in Shearer
Hall. He never fails to give an inspir-
ing and helpful address, and no man
should fail to hear him.

Dr. W. R. Dobyns, of St. Joseph,
Mo., is expected to be -here from Oc-
tober 14-20. He is a man of wonderful
magnetism and power among young men.

BIDS FOR QUIPS AND CRANKS
ENGRAVING WORK.

Mr. A. Pryibil, a representative of
the Electric City Engraving Company,
of Buffalo, N. Y., was on the Hill
‘Thursday, the 14th, negotiating a con-
tract for the engraving for Quips and
Cranks. Several weeks ago Foote &
Davies, of Atlanta, also had a represen-
tative here on the saine business. Dur-
ing the next two cor three weeks the
manager expects to get bids from several
other firms so that he will be able to
have the work done to the best advant-
age.
