The faculty, acting upon a proposal made by the
Trustees last week and in conjunction with the report

' of the Religious Life Committee, suspended compulsory

Vesper services for the nexl two academic years,

During the meeting Tuesday
afternoon, the Roligieus Life
Committee's report was acoepl-
od, and a resolution which the
Teport recommended was passed

the Trustees’ proposal.

The resolution in its fal
form declared; “That compul-
gory religous services on Suti-
dry be auspended at the end
of this adademic year for two
yoars and that a comprehensive

COMMITMENT

In order to maintuin
son's commitment the
went on to make three
mendations, First, the report
enlled for the continunnce and
inyprovement of weekly chapel

The second recommendation.
requested the administration to
establish a new system for
carrying out Davidson's  raeti-

Thirdly the repart suggested
that voluntary religious exee-
clses be implemented in place

RECOMMENDATIONS

The commmitie advised that two
committees be created to put
