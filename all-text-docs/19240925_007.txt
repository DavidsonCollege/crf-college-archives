raneous program at the Philanthropic
Society last Thursday night, little activ- |

were just preliminary to their second
meeting, at which time each society will
initiate its new members.

The principal work of the old members
of these societies so far this year has
been to get a line on prospective mem-
from the Freshman to
get them interested in their respective
societies.
