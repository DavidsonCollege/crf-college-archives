Solidarity goals

More letters

Dear Editors:

Divest from South Africa

An open letter to all Davidson student:

We would like you to know about
us. We, the Solidarity Committee, are
committed to bettering the Davidson
College environment for all students,
regardless of their race, nationality, or
creed. We are working for you; we are
working with you.

The pages of The Davidsonian have
been full of articles on racism on our
campus. Many black and international
students feel isolated at Davidson. We
can all see that there are problems
which need to be addressed because
they are everyone's problems.

The Student Government has
called the Solidarity Committee to work
for solutions to racism and isolation and
all that separates the Davidson commu-
nity. We will be working on a grass-
roots level to combat the subtle, and
sometimes not-so-subtle, expressions
of racism. Ignorance i is one of the main
reasons for racism on our campus.

Many students believe there is no prob-
lem of feeling welcome here, perhaps
because they “fit in” to campus life im-
mediately. However, some minorities
face many problems. We willseek solu-
tions through various activities and
forums that will enable students to
participate and to learn from one an-
other. Our goal is to achieve what our
name _ represents—Solidarity. And
when the quality of life improves for all
Davidson students, then perhaps the
Solidarity Committee will no longer be
needed. :

We believe Davidson has the capac-
ity tochange. Please enable us to help
you bea part of that change. Our meet-
ings are open, and we welcome your
ideas. The next meeting will be at 7:00
on Monday, November 20, in the Lilly
Conference Room of the Library.

Since graduation in 1988, I have
looked back fondly upon my memories
of Davidson College. Outside of the
safe harbor of Davidson people aren’t
as friendly or as willing to offer a smile;
nobody doesmy laundry ormy cooking
for me; and I can find no place to get free
beer.

Davidson certainly is a unique
place, a Paradise onearth. Toobad such
a wonderful college has to earn its keep
from its investments in oppression and
slavery. By retaining its vested interests
in companies dealing in South Africa,
Davidson is giving its tacit consent to
genocide.

I love my alma mater, but I cannot
support such an institution which fos-
ters so much affectionamongstits white

middle and upper class student body
and cares so little for the ted
masses of blacks in South Africa. There-
fore, | am sending my token contribu-
tion of $25 to the annual fund.

However, the moment Davidson
divests from South Africal willincrease
my contribution to at least $150 per
year. My small contribution will not
change the minds of Davidson’s trus-
tees, but should more graduates take
the same notion, the trustees would.
have a sound financial reason for get-
ting off the pot and giving F.W. de Clerc
asound vote of noconfidence by divest-
ing.

“They are Davidsonians who will

make a difference in their communi-
ties.”
