In Good Health

By MARK PUCKETT

Several weeks ago I may
have misstepped in my
sardonic castigation of all
unfit people. However, I
would ‘rather have you
angry with meand exercis-
ing as a possible result of
my vehemence, arrogance,
etc., thanlying sedentary in
analley witha physics text-
book.

Again, I am not a Shake-
spearean artistry figure
who intentionally alters
the flux of your existence. I
cannot make you exercise.
But, I can be a voice--an
annoying reminder--that
kicks your butt into gear. I
am not your conscience,
though. Just a voice. The

Angry and healthy

Her: “Mark, you just write
that article to let everybody
know that you exercise a lot
and are proud of your

body.”
Me: “Right.”
Her: “Jerk.”

Yeah, I write because lam
proud of my gains, and I
write to pump sunshine into
my ears in hopes that it will
reach my brain. I want you
to exercise. I want you to
know what substances enter
your body. Itis nota particu-
larly onerous task. It takes
some prudence and some
time and some common

sense. Don’t be stubborn-- _

exercise and eat well.

third overtime this season

By PAUL PRITCHETT

Davidson men’s soccer team
endured two difficult losses a
few weeks ago toa pair of intra-
state rivals.

Amidst the rubble of Hurri-
cane Hugo Sunday the 24th,
the ‘Cats suffered a_hard-
fought defeat in overtime to
UNC-Charlotte, 2-3. Wednes-
day they lost to Division II
powerhouse UNC-Greens-
boro, 5-3.

The two setbacks dropped
Davidson’s record to 2-7 in the
season, and their as yet most
difficult schedule continues.

Leading scorer Tracy Hank-
ins found the net twice against
UNCC in a valiant comeback
attempt. It took.a 49er goal in
OT off of a free-kick to finally

beat the Wildcats.

“We played well in the
game,” stated coach Charlie
Slagle. “After coming out ten-
tatively and dropping behind
2-0, we came back and fought
hard. It was tough losing our
third overtime match.”

Wednesday against the Spar-
tans, Davidsonalso had to play
catch-up soccer, with Rob
Ukrop, Hankins and Phelps
Sprinkle scoring goals. But
UNC-G, led by a hatrick from
Jason Hault, proved to be too
much for the Wildcats.

The team’s schedule has pit-
ted the ‘Cats against some of
the premier soccer competition
in the South. Matches have
been close and exciting but
Davidson cannot seem to get

many breaks.

| According to Slagle, “We’re
getting better and better and
I’m generally pleased with our
play so far, just not with the re-
sults.”

“We need to get ona roll to
get the players’ confidence lev-
els up again,” he added.

As far as objectives for the
rest of 1989, Slagle said, “Our
goal now is to come back and
get above .500, which with our
schedule, will still put us
among the top teams in the
region. We can play with any-
one and with continued hard
play and a few breaks, the big
wins will come.”

The team has the talent to win
and witha few breaks, should
enjoy future success.

You may say that you
simply have no penchant
for exercise. Fine. But the
fact is that if you exercise
and eat well, you will feel
better and live longer. This
information is not hooey. It
is precept. And you are ig-
norant if you disregard it.
A few days after last

then, remember: 1) exercise
aerobically three times a
week for atleast 20 minutes ~

and swimming are good
choices; and 2) cut down on
fatty meats and oily foods
and eat more fruits, vege-

and cereals. Cut down on
sodium, cholesterol and.
