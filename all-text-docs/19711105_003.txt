Woodmansee Deals

With ‘Whole Person’

By GRAY WILSON
Managing Editor

**My job,”’ says College Chap-
lain Scott Woodmansee, ‘‘is to
work with and not to preach at
students who need help.”

After five years at Davidson,
Woodmansee defines his role as
chaplain in this manner. He
sits in his office in coat and
tie (a thin tie), props his arms
on the chair, and beams with a
cherubic face, large dark brown
eyes, and the smile of a chip-
munk,

“‘My work is with people who
are in a very specific situation
in higher education. | don‘t re-
strict myself to the religious
aspect, but to the whole per-
son, whoever he may be. And
you have to be flexible in this
campus position because  stu-
dent attitudes change quickly.”

Woodmansee, 34, kids about
the bald spot on the back of his
head which is slowly becoming
a reality. A Davidson graduate,
he completed his ministerial
training at Union Theological
Seminary in 1962. He then took
charge of a Presbyterian church
in Memphis, Tenn. until he was
hired at Davidson in 1967.

“Lt think it worried me more
when I came here that I could
nol get to knuw everyone. Also,
there was to job desc: iption; I
had to set up my own program
in addition to adju.iing to the
obueal sheet oct ae sdents
do when they first get here.”

ing students, and his own ap-
pioach to student guidance.

“T never had any specific
training .in campus ministerial
work per se, but a lot of the
pastorial counseling you learn
at the seminary is applicable.
I try to keep up with continu-
ing education, particularly in
theology and psychology.”

Woodmansee conducts sessions
on a casual basis, rarely by ap-
pointment. But with two clinical
psychologists and other coun-
seling services in other areas
(such as vocational), what can
a chaplain offer to students that
is different?

‘‘Much of the methodology in
pastoral and clinical counseling
is the same, a_ non-directive
approach. But in my counseling
I try to look at the whole per-
son within the context that God
cares about us and can in fact
change us for the better.

“The humanistic psychologist
seeks answers within the per-
son himself, but there is a
source of power beyond us, I
believe, which should be con-
sidered, whether you are. talk-
ing about a girlfriend, parents,
inner tensions, or a choice of
career.” ,

Woodmansee utilizes the
YMCA as much as possible as
his main formal connection with
the students and community.
“‘Whenever I want to program

a

something, I go to the YMCA
cabinet.”

The YMCA is helpful in sched-
uling meetings and discussion
groups of all kinds as well as
promoting service projects over
the entire community. Wood-
mansee remarked that he _ is
encouraged by the fact that this
past summer there were twice
as many people involved in
service jobs as ever before.

He says he is interested in
making a “bridge between
church on campus and the
churches in the community.” In
additior to his regular duties,
he now preaches at a different
church each Sunday somewhere
within a 100 mile radius.

The most recent worship
services with which Woodman-
see has been working are the
communion meetings during the
early part of the week. He ex-
plained that these are liturgic-
al in structure, and are thus
more formal than other meet-
ings.

“I think that when chapel
was required along with more
hours in religion courses, it
stifled religious feeling in a
sense. But now, without these
strictures, people feel freer to
express their religious faith or
quest for one through formal
and informal programs.”

sees Davidson
as a place in which students
can express themselves’ as
Christians in a variety of ave-
nues. The so-called “Jesus
freaks” represent just one of
these avenues, he said.

Woodmansee

The most demanding and con-
troversial area, however, in
wh.ch he works is that of pro-
grams outside of the normal
tealm of the minister of yester-
year. Woodmansee is involved
with speakers on campus,
luncheons for students and fa-
culty to get to know one an-
other, hall discussion groups,
encounter groups, Vista, the
Peace Corp, summer jobs, and
politically oriented groups such
as the Peace Coalition.

He justifies his position this
way: “I am willing to join
group on different issues ac-
cording to my own conscience
and convictions, although I am
not formally associated with
any of them. I believe that a
Christian cannot compartmen-
talize his religion separate from
his politics. A Christian must
take a part in politics to fight
such evils as war, poverty, pol-
lution, and racism.”

Woodmansee commented that
he is aware that theré is label-
ing among the students because
of his affiliation with partisan
groups, but said, ‘‘It is impos-
sible to reach 1,000 students at
Davidson. I don’t want to just
run around slapping everyone
on the back. I’m not out to win
a popularity contest. I’m here
to help and want to get directly
involved.”

Yet some students who would
otherwise seek counseling from
the chaplain are turned off by
his involvement, and they would
rather have someone to look to
who remained aloof of such is-
sues.

Other students feel that Wood-

mansee’s realm centers around
the College Union, and that his
rapport with Patterson Court is
poor and at best vague. Some
view him as a counselor for the
socially castrated independent
who has no place to go.

One student complained that
Woodmansee failed to partici-
pate as actively in the local
presbytery, thus keeping events
sponsored by the Campus Chris-
tian Life committee of the Pres-
byterian Church from ever
reaching the students.

So it isn’t all roses, not even
with the college chaplain, but
somewhere among the web of
students, administration, facul-
ty, townspeople, and God, Scott
Woodmansee can be found spin-
ning threads to join them all
together.

Buried among the main or-
ganizations in which Davidson
holds membership, there is one
which affects most students far
more than they realize, the
Piedmont University Center.

With its headquarters in Win-
ston-Salem, the Center is a co-
operative effort between twenty
mostly small colleges spread
across the state from Mars Hill
to Laurinburg.

It could be said that the Cen-
ter serves as a collecting and
distributing agency for the
schools who are affiliated with
it. Their services include a film
library, summer and graduate
Study grants, and an academic
lecture program. Support for
the Center comes from private
foundations and membership
fees from the schools in it.

Davidson borrowed the film.

All of Davidson’s Piedmont
lecturers are supplied by the
Center also. Davidson’s repre-
sentative to the lecture, or visit-

and then the Center arranges
for the speakers to make a

the schools.

Most of the Piedmont lec-

side of their field, but are ex-
perts in the field in which they
are involved. Davidson has ten
Piedmont lecturers this year,
that number having grown con-
siderably in the past few years.
