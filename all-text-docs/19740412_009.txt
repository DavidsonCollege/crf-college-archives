Off The Record

A REVIEW
By DAVID RICHARDSON

Traffic, that well-known
musical enigma, has recently
produced another chapter in
the story of its own live-rock
development.

The youthful public, deter-
mined to accept nothing short
of perfection, may well con-
demn this artistic effort as
insufficiently motivated and
awkward. However, I implore
all concerned music listeners
to give the controversial
album a fair chance on their
gilt-edged Japanese stereo
component systems.

Alone.”

took place in Germany during
Trafic’. European tour of
1973.

In all truthfulness, a com-
petent appraisal of the record
an be formed only if the
listener has heard the afore-
mentioned tunes on the
original albums.

The first cut, ‘Low Spark of
High Heeled Boys,” is a poor
replica of an outstanding
studio-recorded tune. ‘‘On the
Road” depicts this melody in a
lackluster, anemic mode. The
live recording iacks depth,
vivacity, and total instrument

tunes. They are:

‘‘Low Spark of High Heeled
Boys,” ‘Shoot Out at the Fan-
tasy Factory,’’ ‘‘(Sometimes I
Uninspired,’’ and

Feel So)

Martin Ritt’s ‘‘Conrack”’ is nearly a
good movie, but a lot of it is
dissatisfying. Adapted by Irving Ravet-
ch and Harriet Frank Jr. from Pat
Conroy’s autobiographical novel ‘‘The

Water is Wide’’, the film is about a.

Caucasion who attempts to teach an all-
Negro class on an underdeveloped
island off the coast of South Carolina.

The facts of the matter seem to be
fascinating, but a lot has been lost in the
transition from life to novel to film.
Potentially, there are some interesting
characters in this film, but the writing
has reduced them to caricatures. Only
a few provocative details remain, such
as the habit of a Negro schoolmaster of
calling her students “‘babies’’ and the
island ‘‘overseas’’.

Hal Ashby’s first two films, “The
Landlord” and ‘‘Harold and Maude,”
are charming, nicely-acted comedies.
His third film, ‘“‘The Last Detail,” is an
attempt at something serious.

It is about two sailors (Jack
Nicholson and Otis Young) who are
taking a third (Randy Quaid) to prison.
Meadows, the prisoner, is a_ shy.
misbegotten lump of humanity.

‘Conrack’

Ritt is not a director who would be
capable of filling in the local color his
writers have lost, but he has managed
to recover a lot of ground through his
direction of his actors.

Jon Voight makes a charming ex-
trovert, Hume Cronyn is a whimsical
right-winger, Tina Andrews is touching
as Mary, and Ruth Attaway is an im-
pressive Edna. Also, several other per-
formers whose names I do not know are
effective in brief appearances.

Ritt’s main virtue as a director is an
ability to awaken the viewer's
emotions; his main fault is a tendency
toward oversimplification and over-
statement. He is able to involve us in
the lives of his characters and make us

‘The Last Detail’

He was caught stealing $40 from
a polio donation box and sentenced
to eight years in prison--because polio
is the old man’s old lady’s favorite
charity.

The two older sailors feel sorry for
the younger one, and they decide to
show him a good time during his last
week of freedom.

The fine screenplay was adapted by
Robert Towne from a novel by Darryl

care for them.

In ‘‘Sounder’’, where he showed them
paying social calls, visiting relatives,
and doing the things of which great art
is made, his weaknesses became unim-
portant and he made a full-blooded
movie.

Perhaps one reason that ‘‘Conrack”’ is
a lesser tum is that it is more straight-
forward in its narrative, moving like a
battering ram to a foreseeable ending.
The film is at its best when it has least
to do with the screenplay and the
progression of its action.

In scenes like the one in which Voight
plays records for his school children
and they have various reactions to the
various records, the film is wonderful
and fulfilling.

Ponicson. Ashby more than does the
screenplay justice by filling it out with
beautiful evocations of mood and place
with some very fine direction of his.ac-
tors.

Although ‘‘The Last Detail " is a
serious film, Ashby directs as though he
were still making a comedy. This gives
the film liveliness of spirit without
cheapening the content, which wasn’t
very expensive to begin with.

‘Uninspired’ Traffic Shows
Low-Sparked Instrumentals

That incessant Traffic
rhythm still lives, but as akind
of bovine god separated from
its melodic attendants.

In contrast to its fine
original recording, this ‘“‘Low
Spark"’ is indeed a low-
sparked reproduction em-
balmed with a stifling absence
of rudimentary instrumental
cooperation.

The second cut, ‘Shoot Out
at the Fantasy Factory,” is
the album’s first introduction
to the inconsistent guitar jam-
ming abilities of Steve Win-
wood. Unfortunately the lead
guitar stands out as a harsh,
clumsy instrument with
relatively poor back-up. The
Reebop-Hawkins-Capaldi per-
cussion is there, but again it
can extend itself only so far.

With the addition of a few
strains of Barry Beckett’s
organ and Chris Wood's subtle
flute, ‘‘Shoot Out’’ de-
generates into just another
mundane Traffic jam.

With a flip of the record, the
listener is aroused to a new
live sound and a glimmer of
the dynamic past that
rocketed Traffic to stardom.

The third cut, ‘(Sometimes I
Feel So) Uninspired,”’ is a
rewarding tune and in no way
provides the listener with an.
uninspired rendition. On the
contrary, it develops into an
emotive and stimulating tour.

Winwood performs
amazingly, first in a soft vein
with a delicate vocals-piano
combination, then in a power-
ful guitar-led drive, soaring
through the background of ex-
cellent percussion, bass
guitar, sax, and congruous
piano.

It is the transition points
between these different Win-
wood approaches __ that
illustrate the delicate balance
of movement Traffic can
achieve when it finally
amasses its musical wealth of
talent.

‘“‘Uninspired’’ does indeed
flow in a superb way; but it
climbs to tremendous heights
as well on the wailing notes of
the now-well-placed and con-
sistent guitar lead.

In my opinion, this won-
derfully alive jam is dynamic
enough to transcend the poor
boundaries of performance
established by the two
previous songs and elevate the
listening pleasure of the album
toa remarkable level.

The last cut, “Light Up or
Leave Me Alone,” is a living
sterling example of Jim
Capaldi’s fast-paced vocals
and group control--again
drawing the tune’s vivacity
from that complex, driving
rhythm and percussion.

.. Winwood displays more of
his lead guitar abilities; but it
is Beckett’s organ and Chris

Wood’s saxophone that
provide the quick highlights of
“Light Up.”

“‘Uninspired,”’ ‘“‘Light Up”’
provides ample musical flow.
to capture the heart of any at-
‘tentive listener.
