Opinion

Rev. Seeker drops mask

By MIKE DAISLEY
Staff Writer

Rev. Hyden Seeker, author of seve-
ral Davidsonian columns during the
school year, reacted stoicly to the
decision made last week that he would
not be granted tenure.

; Appearing a bit more solemn than
usual, Seeker dropped by Lafferty

‘ House—North yesterday for a David-
sonian interview to reminisce about his
written commentaries on the Davidson
scene.

‘‘Of course, I’m disappointed at
having to leave,”’ remarked the nine-
month-old pen-name, ‘‘but it certainly
has been a fun year.”

‘What amazes me is how the time
has gone. It sounds incredibly trite,
but it really seems like last week that I
tapped out my first column,’’ said
Seeker.

In that reporting debut, Seeker
interviewed the Chamber Maids, Lux
and Orta, about their opinions on
freshmen in general and the Class of '81
in particular. Subsequent columns
dealt with such controversial subjects
as the self-selection of Homecoming
Queens, the Davidson Sun-Team, and
the Second Annual Spring Convocation
Boycott and Speakers’ Festival.

Seeker shrugged off the charge that
his reporting lacked complete accuracy
and credible sources.

‘‘Facts, smacts! My job was to
report the stories as I saw them—the
way they really should have occurred.
So what if I didn’t always confirm my
sources? Nobody else for The Davidso-
nian did either,’’ explained Seeker.

At one time or another during the
year, Seeker allegedly slandered nu-
merous school institutions such as
ARA Slater, Update, the laundry, the
SAE fraternity, and the Union, as well
as a host of individuals, including E.H.
Little, Ed Farrell, President Spencer,
Dr. Devon, Dr. Hight, Dave Pritchett,
Price Zimmermann, Thom Young, and
all the girls that will live in Grey House
next year, just to mention 4 few.

Despite his apparent inadequacy as a
reporter, Seeker doubted that was the
primary reason for. his not receiving
tenure. ‘There are a lot of inadequate
people around with tenure,”’ he said.

‘‘No, the problem is simply inherent
in being a pen-name. You see, a writer
will choose a pen-name even though he
doesn’t always know why or exactly
what he’s going to do with it. A
pen-name is only as respected as the

atmosphere

The following letter was written by
Dr. Carl Cohen, Professor of Philoso-
phy at the University of Michigan to
Professor of English Frank Bliss. Dr.
Cohen, a Reynolds Lecturer, was on
campus two weeks ago.

Dear Frank,

Cordial greetings. Your warm and
gracious note was heartening to re-
ceive. Believe me when I say that I
got—from students and faculty at
Davidson—more than I gave. It was a
very satisfying visit on every count,
and I take the opportunity to express
to you—and through you to the
students— my appreciation of the intel-
lectual and personal spirit shown me
during those days.

I send you, and all friends at
Davidson, every good wish.

Very truly yours,
Carl Cohen

writer behind it. Its main purpose is to
get readers past the personality of. the
by-line and into the content of the
column. —

“At any rate, there comes a time
when a pen-name can no longer help the
writer, and thus it becomes unnecessa-
ry. Even though the writer may still
use it and cherish the security it once
gave, the pen-name has in effect lost its
original purpose. Time has forced the
real writer to come out from behind the
pen-name and he evaluated. Thus, that
special relationship between the two is
terminated, and though the writer will
always carry the pen-name with him, it
can never quite mean the same.

It’s funny,’’ Seeker mused as he was
leaving, ‘‘but a pen-name is a lot like a
college. I just wish some writers would
have recognized that earlier.”

Letter to the Editor

U4? i Se

(David Litaker)

Smith charges subjective journalism

To the Editor:

I was disturbed to read last week’s
article entitled ‘‘Davidson students
protest nuclear plant.’’ Without draw-
ing any value judgements as to the
protest itself,’ 1 feel The Davidsonian's
coverage of the Barnwell activity was
less than objective and not as news-
worthy as its two thousand words or so
would indicate.

From the beginning, I will admit
that an activity including as many
Davidson students as this ‘seems to
have involved is germane material for
The Davidsonian. | will not grant,
however, that the most minute details
of the entire weekend were front page
news.

/ \though the kicker headline implied .

that Davidson studer ts were ‘‘arrested
for civil disobedience,’’ the article itself
finally got around to their names some

500 words later. The reader first had to
wade through such muck as ‘“‘In high
spirits the demonstrators returned to
the campsite for the rally that eve-
ning,’’ and ‘‘The feelings of the
marchers were a combination of deter-
mination, excitement, and uncertainty.

Normally, one could question the
writers’ ability to know the precise
feelings of the marchers. This obstacle
was neatly hurdled, however, by the
fact that all three (objective?) writers
participated in the march itself.

The disturbing point is that the
reader was not told this was to be a
subjective, opinionated essay —the
front page position and third person
point-of-view instead implied that the
article was, in fact, ‘‘straight news’”’ (if
such a creature actually exists). The
clincher came when two of, the writers

ees [David Litaker]

were so anxious to present their
personal point-of-view that they inter-
viewed themselves. Neat, huh?

The last half of the article described

the booking and bail process. True, the
information perhaps was ‘‘a worth-

while, valuable learning experience’’ —
but was it particularly relevant? Could-
n’t the law officers’ ‘‘courteous”’ treat-
ment during that time have been
covered in one sentence (or’even a
phrase)? Did .we have to know the
marchers every step—their every
thought, word, and emotional peak?

If so, perhaps other Davidson stu-
dents would like equally the opportuni-
ty to write of their own weekends this
spring. Maybe we could just have
show-and-tell in Love Auditorium du-
ring the old ten-o’clock Chapel hour
instead.

Come on, Davidsonian! Let’s have
some objective (and concise) reporting.
If you really don’t have anything to
say, have_another page of Inside Art
and quit wasting the readers’ time.

Stephen J. Smith '78
Davidson College
Dear Mr. Smith:

It would have been more appropriate
to have had a reporter interview the
participants of the Barnwell protest
and write a news article. But frankly,
we had no other reporters: available. As
this was the case, we had involved
people write a news-feature article, one
that conveyed a sense of the event as
well as cold, hard facts.

We do feel this was front page
material for three reasons. Many
students have expressed interest in the
events at Barnwell. The protest receiv-
ed front page coverage in many
newspapers. And most importantly,
the reason for the protest, nuclear
energy, is an important national issue,
one that will affect many people's lives.

When Davidson students finally do
emerge from their microcosm and
display enthusiasm over a national
issue, it deserves major coverage.
