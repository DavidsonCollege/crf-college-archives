But even at Davidson we
have some organizations that need badly to justify
their existence. We refer to the so-called “hon-
orary fraternities” which keep a greater part of
our student body running from meeting to meet-
ing.

We doubt not that all of these groups are
founded on high and worthy ideals and that time
properly devoted to membership in any one of
them would Be wall worthwhile. Vet how many
of them fulfill these ideals, are really active? How
many hold the interest of, their members suffi-
ciently to insure attendance at meetings? How
many make any worthwhile contribution

Is membership in an honorary society coveted
because it means something to the individual and
the campus? or does it mean merely another key
for the watch-chain? Do members attend meet-
ings because they gain thereby? or because they
stek to impress the faculty members by their at-
tendance? Do we want self-improvement or a
few more Greek letters after our name in the
annual ?

Some of these organizations ee
justify their existence, making real contributions
‘to student leadership and student thought. Others
have to prove themselves. As pointed out-else-
where in these columns, even the venerable Phi
Beta Kappa, supposedly chosen from the best
heads of the campus, does little apparent work be-
sides reading bids and offering an occasional ban-
quet. It is high time for either a revival or spring
house cleaning. If the fraternity can not be made
of real value, we can find better uses for our
time and money.

behind many Southern colleges
students invaluable training and experience.

There.is little necessity of enumerating the vir-
tues of public speaking. Almost invariably it de-
velops and vitalizes the poise and expressive per-
sonality of a man. Perhaps its greatest gift is the
feeling of confidence and accomplishment that it
imparts to one who masters its art. Nor does the
power of forensic ability rest alone in public poise,
but it enriches individual contacts by the clarity,
precision, and persuasion which it adds to the per-
sonality. Modern leaders in every field of activity
extol the talent of speaking forcefully and per-
suasively to others.

At present, public speaking enjoys an almost
esoteric status on our campus. Only nine varsity
debaters can profess to receive adequate training
in forensics. Literary societies provide a,limited
outlet for such ability,
and insufficient. Thus we are confronted with
the problem of devising a plan whereby the aver-
age Davidson man will be able to develop a skill in
public speaking. The plan which we propose has
this purpose as its key objective. We feel certain
that the college could inaugurate and successfully
maintain a course in public speaking. This would
not be a text-book course; a capable man ap-
pointed by the Faculty Committee would instruct
and advise as to the essentials of effective public
speaking and the class itself would devote part
of its time to active criticism. Vital experience in
actual speaking would be gained by students,
speaking before that body from time to time on
various subjects. The fundamental aim is to pro-
vide a course, open to all students, which would
allow every Davidson man an equal opportunity
to develop that poise and confidence which re-
sults from speaking before men.

We, therefore, recommend that the Faculty
Committee on Courses take action toward pro-
viding such a course. The possibility of assigning
a part-time professor to fill this position should
he considered. It would be absolutely. essential
that the person selected to serve in this capacity
be a man with the personality and-talent requisite

but at best this is occasional

for such instruction.
The foregoing plan was advocated and unani-
mously endorsed by a: Phi Epsilon at a re-

cent meeting.

Campus Comments

Since the last two issues of Campus Comments
have contained naught but peace and quiet, I
rather ‘feel it behooves me to stir slightly the die-
ing embers of protest before they sizzle out en-
tirely.

Protest number one is aimed at the week-end
on the campus. Outsiders cannot understand why
our students desert the campus so often on week-
ends; the wonder to me is that more of them do
not desert it. Although it may rain all the rest
of the week, Sunday almost invariably turns out
to be a clear, sunshiny day. Yet six hundred-
odd energetic, lively boys are supposed to read—
but not study — stroll, or sleep. Is it any wonder
that the students “take off,” usually doing them-
selves no good and certainly placing an added
burden, financially, on the elders back home?
Would it not be much better for all concerned to
lower the bars and permit usage of the tennis
courts and golf course, say between the hours
of one and five Sunday afternoons? Not even
the most ardent opponent could call this harmless
recreation a disturbance of the peace.

Number two concerns the desire of the powers
that be to prevent the student body or groups
representing the college from traveling on Sun-
day. The football team must leave Raleigh or
Greenville-immediately after the game in order
not to travel on Sunday, although we all know
it will be Sunday before they reach Davidson;
our holidays must invariably begin in the middle
of a week to avoid this bugaboo. Yet by the un-
interesting prospect of a week-end on the cam-
pus (see above), the very purpose of the measure
is defeated, for Mr. Average Student leaves, then
travels Sunday afternoon to return in time for
Vespers.

Far be it from me to desire Davidson to be just
another college, but when much is gained and
little lost by change, then to remain static is’to
stagnate.

Company, to write the next Campus Comments.

honorary fraternities on this campus, and it
takes top place in national rating. Yet the
“brains of the campus” do not take an active
part in sponsoring movements at Davidson.
This venerable scholastic fraternity could
encourage freshman scholarship, or some oth-
er activity, instead of meeting twice a year for
a banquet. Honor and usefulness would
then be united. ;

OPEN FORUM

Dear _Editor:

I think some professors take sa-
distic pleasure in parceling out seats
in their classrooms in some conven-
tional order. I wonder how many
of the sages who assign seats real-
ize what unnecessary cruelty they
inflict on the unfortunates who are
placed right under the professorial
nose or behind hulking six-footers.

It seems that there is a group of
professors who do not wish to call
the roll; they put their students in
regimented places, which was all
right back in junior high school, but
doesn’t look quite sensible at col-
lege.

In the back we doze off or go
through all sorts of contortions in
order to see through some of the
rather ample shoulders in front. Up
front we get stiff necks looking up
all the time; in fact I doubt if many
are satisfied with seats which are
alotted indiscriminately.

There should be some protest
from the common herd. There are
worthies who would like the oppor-
‘tunity for illicit sleep, letterwriting,
and tic-tac-too in the rear of the
rooms. There are those who pre-
fer being noticed or who like to see
what is written on the blackboards.

I suggest that we be given the
opportunity to sit where we wish.
I always function better beside
friends of mine while some fellows

She had no lover true,
To call on her and warble,
“T love no one but you!” ,

So on the fence she squatted
And told the moon her wish,

A little china dish.

You take a tip from tabby,
And boast your enterprise.
Just tell the world you've got it

It pays to advertise. —

Gong...

Every student has at one time
or other wished there was a gong,
a hook or some other means—of
stopping an assembly speaker. Last
week at Bluffton College some
brave student was audacious enough
to put his thoughts into action, Dr.
A. C. Weind, a distinguished, but
true product of the “Windy City,”
was addressing the student body.
As the end of the first hour neared
and the speaker appeared to be just
warming up, a bell began to ring.
The bell was more persistent than
Dr. Weind and so the assembly ad-
-journed. The bell, found later,
turned out to be an alarm clock con-
cealed behind the. chapel organ.
Since no one would confess, the
administration is having the student
body finger-printed to discover the
culprit.

We've heard of the power of the
press, but never saw it, so vividly
demonstrated as this week. In last
week's Nutshell some aspersions
were cast at Old Man Winter, to
the effect that he had not done
right by his reputation on the Dav-
idson campus this year. It seems
that the week-end has reversed all
that, for we’ve had one of the heav-
iest snows in years. So here let us
make a public apology. Incidentally,
I wish the guy who wrote “I’ve
Got My Love to Keep Me Warm,”
could have ridden here from Char-
lotte in a rumble seat Saturday
night. Would he have felt like a
fool!

A reliable source reveals that the
identity of the late lamented Ima
Heart-healer is inseparably linked
with that of one Frances Gunn
(which makes this crack irresist-
able: Frances Gunns are always
getting her in dutch with Germany).
Sorry to spoil your secret, Frances,
but I really think you ought to
take the blame for your own mis-
takes; also whatever credit may be
coming to you. Don’t start Gunning
for me, though — I’m only: fooling.

The new Constitution carried by
a goodly majority yesterday, it
would seem. Funny what an effect
national politics can exert on a
school’s governmental life. David-
son has turned her back on the
horse-and-buggy days now, and if
present indications are correct, as
goes Davidson so goes the nation
on this matter. Bet we know a,na-
tional executive who would give a
lot to be able to scrap the consti-
tution that gets in his hair as eas-
ily as our old one was laid aside.

The Charlotte Observer reports
that Woodrow Wilson was fined
20c during his freshman year at
Davidson for disorderly conduct in
the halls. How times have chang-
ed! Either Woodrow picked a bar-
gain day for his fling, or else the
price level! has seen a decided rise.
Nowadays the cheapest fine on the
books is $1. And just think, for
that amount Wilson. and his. class-
mates could have been disorderly
five times. Myomy!

Stuff: *Have you seen the new
Davidson Catalog? It is by far the
slickest catalog (on the outside)
that we have yet encountered. Built
somewhat on the lines of a cross
between Coronet and Readers Di-
gest. But beauty is only skin deep,
and inside it’s the same old Math
and English. Examination of the
new catalog mentioned above re-
veals that next year’s Christmas
holiday begins on the fiteenth and
lasts until the fourth, a gain of
some five days ... This year’s crop
of radio programs from the campus
has it all over those broadcasts last
year ... Congratulations to the new
Phi Betas.

Our heads still buzzing from ex-
aminations and mid-winters, we
find ourselves already in the midst
of the first review period of the
second semester. If you've studied
enough so far to know what color
your books are, you're the excep-
tion and not the rule, and you've
got my envy. If somebody told
me my astronomy book was: print-
ed in pink ink, I wouldn’t doubt
him at all. (Of course I’m not tak-
ing astronomy—think I'd ask for
a flunk?)

The French department took a
step in the right direction when it
brought a French moving picture

certain other drawbacks, it is in-

acts. Here’s hoping the other lang-
uage departments will follow suit.
