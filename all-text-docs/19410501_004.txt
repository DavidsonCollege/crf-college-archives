With the failure of a training table plan tried three years ago
lue to boarding-house protests still fresh in his mind, Coach
Gene McEver, after considering all the angles, has contrived a
new plan to provide help for needy and deserving athletes.
THE NEW PLAN.

In a meeting of fraternity presidents and. boarding-house
managers held Monday night the coach proposed a slightly
changed version of his original proposition which had been for
each fraternity boarding house to draw the name of an athlete
from a hat and provide meals for him at their dining room, This
idea found little favor among the fraternity groups, and it was
thought that a system by which each fraternity might pay (not
necessarily feeding him at their own house) for the board of
one man, Estimates were made and a rough figure showed
that, 65¢ added to the board of each man during each month
would provide for the nine men.

This money to be paid to Coach McEver who would
immediately turn over $25 to the various boarding houses where
the boys happened to he eating, perhaps fraternity boarding
houses, perhaps non-frat. To this plan, , there are many
drawbacks, to have no answer, but most

of the whole. Certainly, evervor ill be put out to a certain
extent, but it seems that the end deserves a little inconvenience
and expense

Chief among the objections mentioned are that it is not-the

are the class which derives the most pleasure from a winning
team. Another argument is that each fraternity has some boys
whom they would like to help if they help anyone} this’ is

another well-taken point; but. afcer the plan begins to work
the boys whom the frats would want to help now, and are not
doing it, will be the ones receiving aid. In other words, a few

toes.-may be tromped on and a few noses broken at first) but the

plan must begin sometimes and the harm would be over inva

vear. ;
Others say that one fraternity may profit by pledging a

larger number of the-nine than others, but this situation will

undoubtedly even up during a number of years, and, the other
frats may achieve the samé results by pledging up any board-

ing house customer :
There is much to be said, also, in favor of the plan. Primarily,
it would bring eight or nine athletes to Davidson who would

otherwise, The competition in securing athletes
which we have comes from schools which, although they are
often the boy’s second choice, cost so much less to attend, that
he is tempted to go to them without any induction—The annual
amount of their board bill would be enough to turn the scales
toward Davidson in a number of cases. Coach McEver has a list
of fifteen boys, most of them fraternity material, all of them
with passable grades, who are considering Davidson seriously
as a.place to goto school. With eight or nine board scholarships
and a little luck, the Coaches might get enough from.this list
to use these opportunities:

Fhe payment of this weekly l5e, would probably foster the
rebirth of that Wildcat spirit which seems to be dying out at
Davidson. Each student would have somewhat of a personal
interest, not in merely an individual, but in the whole squad,
for no one knows which man his 65e¢ is feeding. The whole idea
is that of a pool, everybody is sharing equally and receiving
equal benefits. Re

It may be considered as a habit former for future alumni, who

never get here

they start contributing while in college, will continue the
practice after graduating. This’ is the case in several other
schools, not endowed by the state or backed heavily by private

enterprise. It might also be added, not as an argument to adopt
the scheme, but as an endorsment ‘of it, that at Carolina each
fraternity is responsible for two boys, and some three
GENERAL DOPE.

Monday night, press night for today’s paper proved a happy
one for Davidson athletics. The nine won their first victory of
the vear defeating Wofford 7-5, and Coach Spearman's frosh
trackmen romped on Boyden High of Salisbury 79 1-2 to 37 1-2,

while the varsity men gloated over a crushing victory over The
Citadel

In the frosh meet Dill Lacy went on a point grabbing spree,
scoring only 7 1-2 points less than the entire Salisbury team

with the amazing total of 30 points, which should be some sort
of a record. Entered in six events the speedster took top honors
in each division with remarkably good times for his number of
entrys.

Monday’s dailies bring the news that Tennessee’s Coach Bob
Neyland has received his orders to report to a military concen-
tration point. for avyear’s service beginning May 26. Rumor
around the sports world has it that Coach Mclver may be
offered the post have been floating wildly with no foundation
in fact, as yet.
