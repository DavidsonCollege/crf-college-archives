out the season, Davidson found
itself up against a bigger, stronger
club. Though the Buccaneers en-
tered the contest with a 2-5 record,
they had competed against a pair
of Division II teams and East Ten-
nessee State,a Division I-AA mem-
ber. “I told our guys the field was
going to tilt when they came on,”
head coach Dave Fagg quipped.
The ‘Cats opened up the scor-
ing in the first quarter when Alden

Smith returned a Robert Turner:

punt 58 yards for a touchdown.
Near the end of the first: quarter,
the teams exchanged fumbles in
Davidson territory. With 1:13 re-
maining in the period, Leroy
Alexander eluded the ‘Cats’ de-
fense for a 36-yard touchdown
jaunt which evened the score at
seven.

Six minutes later, Davidson
was back in front. Howell spotted
Ward Davis in the right corner of
the end zone on fourth down and
seven from the visitors’ 22, and the

seven-play, 48-yard drive put ©

Davidson up again. The Bucs
scored two touchdowns within a
minute late in the half, the second
ona49-yard interception return by
Wesley Watts; at the half, Charles-
ton Southern led 21-14. :

“Things were getting frustrat-
ing in the first half,” Howell admit-
ted, “but we knew we all had to
take care of our own jobs in the
second half.”

Howell’s assessment proved
to be accurate nearly five minutes
into the third quarter, when he took
a pitch from Bannister and fired a
strike to Lamar, who outraced two
Buc defenders fora 68-yard touch-
down. Drew Fassett’s extra point
sailed wide left, though, and
Davidson remained a point behind.

Davidson surged into the lead
on the first play of the final stanza;
Howell found Isaac Bailey from
two yards out for the score. The
11-play drive began after John
Dalton’s interception of Brad
Johnson at the Charleston South-
em 49. Howell’s two-point con-
version pass to Davis fell incom-
plete, and the “Cats held a 26-21
advantage.

After holding the Bucs and

regaining possession, the ‘Cats lost -

. theball when Bannister fumbled at

the Davidson 35. Two and-a-half
minutes later, D’ Angelo Dereef put
Charleston Southern in front with
a five-yard touchdown run. The
two-point conversion try failed,
leaving Davidson behind 27-26
with seven minutes left.

The “Cats held the ball for the
next six minutes, mixing up rushes
and passes to move from their 33 to
the Bucs’ three with a minute and-
a-half remaining. On third and goal
from the one, Bannister pounded
through the defensive line for the
game-winning tally.

Davidson’s nemesis through-
out the contest was Johnson, who
picked up 201 yards on 22 carries
from an option formation. Howell
benefitted from some of the best
protection he has seen all season in
the second half, and he finished the
contest with 255 passing yards and
three touchdowns.

“This was almost better than
winning a50-point game,” Howell
said. “We-kept our heads up even
though they had a lot of big guys.
We’ve been struggling a lot, and
this was a great win.”

Over fall break, the defense
dominated Methodist in a27-6 tri-
umph in Fayetteville. Chris Leak
and Smith each picked off two
passes, and the ‘Cats recovered
three fumbles.

Bannister led Davidsonon the
ground, picking up 73 yards.and
the first touchdown, a six-yard
carry which put Davidson up 7-0.
Howell, who completed 10 of 18
passes for 145 yards, threw for a
pair of nine-yard touchdowns to
Lamar in the third quarter. Meth-
odist avoided a shutout early in the
fourth period, but Holzworth led
Davidson to the afternoon’s final
score when he crossed the goal line
froma yard out with under a minute
to play.

Davidson only outgained the
Monarchs by 17 yards, 273-256,
but the ‘Cats forced five intercep-
tions and recovered three fumbles,
compared to only one and two for
Methodist’ s defense. The ‘Cats also
dominated in the time of posses-
sion category, holding the ball for
over 12 minutes longer than their
foes.

Davidsonreturns home forthe
final time this season when Centre
College visits Richardson Field at
1:30 Saturday.

Gabriel Pursues Olympic Dream

By Steve Krause

About a month ago, Davidson :

student Bill Gabriel competed at
the . Collegiate Olympic
Weightlifting Championships at
the University of Indiana. With a
snatch of 105 kilograms and aclean
and jerk of 140 kilograms, he won
the bronze medal in the 82.5 kilo-
gram weight class. For Gabriel,
these accomplishments represent
the first step in the fulfillment of
his Olympic dream.

Gabriel is a sophomore psy-
chology. major from Costa Mesa,
Ca. He began weightlifting while
training as a freshman in high
school for his first love, football.
During football off-season, he com-

peted for two seasons on the var-
sity wrestling team and another
two seasons on the track. team.
During his senior year, anew track
coach introduced him to Olympic-
style weightlifting.

Gabriel devotes considerable .

time to weightlifting in the hopes
of earning a spot on the United
States Olympic: Team. He spent
last summer in Colorado Springs,
Co., training at the Olympic Train-
ing Center with the U.S.
Weightlifting team. One of the
highlights of hissummer was mak-
ing the trip to Barcelona to watch
the weightlifting portion of the
1992 Summer Games.

Currently, Gabriel works out

one and-a-half to two hours twice
a day during the week and once on
the weekend. Weightlifting is his

- outlet from the rigors of academic

life. “Weightlifting is a form of
meditation. Iam both mentally and
physically focused on the weight,”
he said. Gabriel asserts that
weightlifting is “just as valid as
any of the other Olympic sports.”
A world class weightlifter must
physically train between eight and
ten hours a day and possess good
athletic ability. He insists that,
though there is limited support for
weightlifting in this country, he
won’t let that handicap get in the
way of his Olympic dream.
