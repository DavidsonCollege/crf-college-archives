ninth, when a rally was started. bt was
short lived, however, and the lead made
by the visitors in the sixth could not be
overcome.

Vhe visitors scored all of their eight
runs in the sixth, when three hits and a
bunch of errors sent the locals up in the

Again in the sixth Carolina scored two

The features of the game were the
playing of the entire Carolina team and

DAVIDSON IS VICTORIOUS

patniotic Americans to receive these im-
migrants. .

(he debaters were then given five min-
utes cach for rejoinders, the order being
reversed so that Clenison led off and
Davidson closed. “The rebuttals were
full of fire and = spirit. ‘“Vhe Clemson
debaters, however, showed — themselves
unable to meet the strongest: arguments
of the affirmative, while Alexander and
Rowan had tittle difheulty in findins
flaws inthe contentions of the negativ:.

The decisions of the judges were then
handed to Dr. Johnson in’ sealed en-
velopes, while the audience awaited an-
xiously to hear the result, which wis
four to one in favor of Davidson.

The crowning event of a victurieus
day was the informal reception given by
the Winthrop girls in the halls of the
main building immediately after the ide-
bate. ‘The three literary societies, Win-
throp. Wade, and Curry, united their
efforts to give the visitors a cordial wel-
come, and truly a more cordial welcome
could not have been given. ‘The girls
were out in full) force, and they were
most charming hostesses indeed. As
sisting them in entertaining were the fac-
ulty and marshalls in their regalia. of
garnet, purple. and gold, the colors, of
the three societies. When the good-night
gong sounded the hour of departure it
was with real regret that the Davidson
men forced themselves to leave, and they
are eagerly awaiting an opportunity. to
again pay a visit to Rock Hill and Win-
throp.

The entire Davidson student body
wishes to tender their sincere thanks to
the girls of Winthrop for an enjoyable
day and a delightful reception, and te
Dr. Johnson for his interest and splen-
did co-operation, especially in the staging
of the debate. and also in’ the other
events of Davidson Day at Rock Hill.
