FRIDAY, MARCH §, 1965

END OF AN ERA

1 remember the summer before my freshman year.
People at home would ask where I was going to school
and Id tell them Davidson.

Reactions varied from, “Now where is that?” to “Go-

ing to be a preacher, eh?” to “Must have pretty good
grades to be going there” to “oh.”

It was a little different going home this year. Little
kids 10 years old down at the drug store could give the
height and scoring average of every Wildcat. Everybody
knows where Davidson is now.

Pride is nice to have. It’s always been easy to be
proud of going to Davidson when around people who
know about and appreciate Davidson’s academic stand-
ards.

But it’s nice to have pride too when the filling sta-
tion attendant, the kids at the drug store, the summer
friends from Maine or Oregon know you're from David-
son.

It’s nice to have pride when you read about David-
son in Sports Illustrated, in the preseason basketball mag-
azines, in the wire service stories.

It’s nice to fee! school spirit, trite as it sounds, and
this unifying spirit is almost nonexistent apart from bas-
ketball.

This new pride and spirit was made possible when
Lefty Driesell recruited in the winter of 1961 five men
who have formed a nucleus for Davidson's 3-year era of
basketball greatness. Maybe other teams will reach sim-
ilar heights, but theirs will be a new era.

Others deserve credit for Davidson’s success, but
the spotlight now is on those whose departure marks the
end of an era.

Fred Hetzel will be goné, the All-Everything whose
honors have come so fast and furiously this year that no
one really knows all of them. The NBA's, UPI’s, Sporitng
News, and AP’s All-America first teams, undoubtedly
Player-of-the-Year in the Southern Conference for the
third straight year, school record holder in total points
scored, highest scoring average, most rebounds, and
practically every record in the college’s books. Always
giving credit to his teammates, Hetzel has done for more
Davidson while still an undergraduate than anyone in the
college’s history.

Barry Teague, “the little general” of the Wildcats, |
leaves with Hetzel. Sometimes marked by opposing teams
as the weak link of the ’Cats’ scoring, his outside shoot-
ing on collapsing defenses proved otherwise. His phe-
nominal play-making and clutch free throws made the
difference in many games. But Teague’s value was not
in his scoring, but in Davidson's desire and determina-
tion he seemed to personify in his rugged defensive play,
his agile ball handling, and his floor leadership.

Don Davidson never failed to provide the excitement
and action that made him the most interesting player. His
brand of twisting, fighting, driving, grabbing basketball
justified the countless roars of approval he drew from
dazzled fans. More than once a I
drive, or steal turned the tide of defeats to victory and
victories to runaways.

Charlie Mercon, number-six man for two years, step-
ped into a starting role with hardly a noticeable bump.
His high arching jumping shot, his sudden “stop and
shoot”; his unbelievable jumping ability made him an
ever-present threat to opponents as a scorer and rebound-
er. Excited by success, his scoring often came fast and
in intermittant bursts or 6 or 8 points.

Paul Briggs, who advanced from tenth man on the
team his more year to Lefty's top substitute this
year, provided the reserve strength without which the
‘Cats’ 23-game win streak could hardly have lasted. In the
Charlotte Invitational and against NYU while Don David-
son was out, against Furman when Hetzel fouled out, or
whenever a starter had too many fouls too early, his abil-
ity to fill in when needed often made the difference. If
it were not for his broken foot, perhaps he could have
been the difference last week.

Hetzel, Teague, Davidson, Mercon, Briggs — these
champions in their last three years here have provided
Davidson with innumreable thrills, and excitement. But
more than that they have given us a pride and a spirit
that all the library books and high college board and
graduate record scores could ever produce. ; ;

t generally don’t go in much for writing this senti-
mental-type crap, but these guys deserve more than my
cynicism. I have to go along with Lefty—they’re still

champs. .

Rifle Squad Faces ZZ

$. C. Tournament

Davidson's rifle team carries
a 6-7 season record to'Fort Lee,
Va. tomorrow for the Southern
Conference meet.

Commented Sgt. Henry D.
Eaves, rifle team coach, ‘We've
done well so far this season. es-
pecially since we have a team
composed of five sophomores out
of six riflemen. Our record is
fair but I expect that VPI, West
Virginia, VMI, and Citadel will
be the dominating teams in the
event.”

Following the conference con-
test, the shooters will fire in the
March 13 N. C, State Invitation-
al Tournament, which includes
teams (generally Air Force,
Army, or Navy-ROTC teams)
from N. C. State, UNC, Wake
Forest, N. C. A & T College, and
Davidson.

“Davidson might stand a
chance of winning that meet,"
said Eaves, “but: we'll have to
work pretty hard to do it."

Eaves singled out Davidson's
Jim Kopp. a junior, as a con-

team and mentioned sophomores
Wes Bailey, James Clark, Wal-

ter Eastes. Ed Maxwell, and &

Will Norman, all of whom will
be making the trip to Fort Lee,
as valuable marksmen.

END OF AN ERA
“From Culls To Kings in Three Years”

W.Va. Kills ‘Cats Hopes,
But Memories Survive

By BILL BRIGGS
Assistant Sports Editor

A bevy of obnoxious fans, a blaring bugle, a bushy-faced “mountaineer,” a hand-
ful of sharp cheerleaders, and an inexplainable enthusiasm reflected by loud confi-
dence armed West Virginia for their unbelievable, deadly coup.

With 10:33 left in the game,
the Mountaineers had opened

up a 60-47 lead, shooting like
they were throwing peas into a
washbucket. West Virginia
scored every time it touched
the ball in the first seven
minutes of the second half.

But a revitalized defense, led
by junior Dick Snyder's master-
guarding of “Boney’’ Bob
Camp, and a newly poised of-
fense leaning heaviiy on All-
American Fred Hetzel fought
back like the team that had
won 23 straight ball games
and was ranked fifth in the
nation. The impossible come
back was made: the score was
tied 68-68 with 47 seconds left.

The rest is 400 well known.
The handwriting had been
written on the wall then, and
since then it has been written
in the minds of every follower
of Davidson basketball.

Tuesday, December 2, it all
started. Slowly Wake Forest
fell 95-88. The season had be-
gun amid high hope and ex-
citement, usually strangers to
Davidson athletics.

The momentum that the Wake
game had started was abruptly
halted, the next Saturday at
Philadelphia's Palestra. St.
Joe's jolted the nation, pro-
vided Sports (lustreted with its
“Upset of the Week’, and over-
ran a squad of seniors that
played surprisingly like shaky
sophomores. ‘

St. Joe hurt, but after the
varbs of defeat had been pull-
ed out of the ‘Cats’ padded
paws, the shakiness left and
Davidson found itself.

For 23 straight games a
handful of Davidson gentlemen
made the nation sit up and
take notice by being something
less than gentle. They were not
always overpowering, but ¢hey
won. And Ohio State, Virginia.
Alabama, Ohio and NYU can

‘Cats 4th In SC Meet

set last year with a mark of
4:53.5 in the 400-yard individual
medley.

By SAM BOYTE
Davidsonian Sports Writer

Davidson's swim team
built up a total of 13 points
to take fourth position in
the three-day Southern Con-
ference Swimming Meet af-
ter the first round of events
yesterday in Williamsburg.

Virginia Military Institute
leads the competition with a
44-point mark. VMI swimmers
have won the meet which car-
ries with it the conference
championship in eight of-the last
eleven years.

Virginia Polytechnical Institute,

who won the meet last year, is
second with 23 points. The meet
host, William and Mary, is third
with 18 points.

Trailing Davidson are The
Citadel with ten points and West
Virginia with no points.

Only one conference record
has been set thus far. Peter
MacIntosh of William and Mary
broke his own record of 4:54.7

John Alexander scored three
points for the Wetcats by plac-
ing fourth in the 50-yard free-
style with a time of 23.8. William
and Mary's Ron Good won the
event in 22.2. His qualifying
time of 22.0 tied the conference
mark for this event which he
set last year.

Randy Hughes swam the 400-
yard individual medly. in 5:09.6
and took fifth place for David-
son worth two points. In qualify-
ing he broke the old school
record with a 5:00.8 time,

Jim Stokes, John Alexander,
Lloyd Davidson, and John Helm
won third place in the 400-yard
medley réelay. Their total time
of 4:03.8 was a school record.

This important event which
carries a 14-point plum for the
winner was taken by VMI with a
time of 3:58.3.

West Virginia was unable to

compete here because their
backstroke swimmer was de-
clared ineligible last Tuesday by
conference commissioner Lloyd

well attest that they did win,
so can West Virginia—twice,
by 9 and 23 points.

As the streak increased the
typical Davidson man began
to take winning for granted.
He casually yawned off the
times the ‘Cats stumbled—like
at Furman, at VMI, against the
Citadel—because they still won.

But any yawning. that came
from the followers of Davidson
basketball was only surface
boredom. Not many of the
yawners would have traded the
pride that winning brought for
the excitement of losing a few.

A season should not be judg-
ed by one game, and not many
wlll look back on Davidson’s
1964-65 basketballers as any-
thing less than Southern Con-
ference champions. Maybe they
were not the post-season tour-
nament winner, but few will
deny they were the champions.

This season held a_ specia)
significance for Davidson fans.
The men who had brought big-
time dasketball to the sleepy
little town of Davidson would
be gone after this. ,

Now they are gone, ‘this’
season has passed. The locker
rooms are quiet; the gym is
empty, and the white jerseys,
with black and red numerals
have been hung up again.

But this team will never be
forgotten. Its seniors, Fred
Hetzel, Barry Teague, Don
Davidson, Charlie Marcon, and
Paul Briggs, the men who
have led basketball's alliance
with “The Libera] Education”
have won places in the minds
and hearts of every fan who
has followed them.

As long as future Davidson
men congregate, as Jong as one
Davidson alumnus is around,
whenever the conversation
drags, somebody's voice will
be heard...

“I remember them. There
was a basketball team. At
times the best ever, the, very
best. They were great. It’s just
a damn shame. . .”

Long after the colored news-
print picture of Hetzel and
Driesell comes down from the
wall behind Hattie’s bar. peo-
ple will remember and talk
basketball as it was then.

Next year Davidson will be

idson like this one has. None

After one day of practice,
Coach Tom Stevens enthusias-
tically previewed the coming
season by bluntly stating, ‘‘We
are hurting.” He poimed to a
late start, bad weather, the ina-
bility of the basketball players
to practice, and the loss of ca-
pable players at key positions.

The hardballers take on strong

their 30-game schedule, which
includes Clemson, UNC, West

Stevens hopes this year's
squad can equal or better the
impressive record set by last
year's team, which placed third
in the conference with a 9-5 rec-
ord and finished the season with
a 9-game winning streak against
both conference and non-confer-
ence foes. This was especially
significant since Davidson does
not subsidize baseball.

Although the outfield and sec-
ond-base positions are strong,
the infield was weakened by

Cagers Close Season

By TUCKER LAXTON
Davidsonian Sports Writer

. A last-ditch effort to get Davidson an at-large
bid to play in the NCAA Midwest Regionals was

thwarted as the berth

went to Notre Dame

(14-11) leaving the ‘Cats out of the post-season tour-

naments again this year.

Davidson could have easily received a bid to
play in the National Invitational Tournament in New
York, but there was little hope of going since the
Southern Conference had refused to let the Wildcats

go last year.

Athletic Director Tom Scott took an informal
poll of some of the members of the Executive Com-
mittee and found the sentiment was still against al-
lowing them to go. He decided to pursue the venture

no further.

Dean Frontis Johnston, who formerly served on
the Executive Committee, said that as far as last
year’s decision was concerned, Davidson wasn’t al-
lowed to go because tt would hurt the Conference

in the eyes of the NCAA.

Ronald Green, sports editor of The Charlotte
News, called the NIT “a tournament of also-rans,”
implying that Davidson didn’t need to go to it in the

least, since the Wildcats

have already made their

mark on the country, and no prestige would be
gained by going to the NIT.

just sit there all the time.”

On his greatest thrills while at
Davidson, Hetzel recalied the
Charlotte Coliseum victory over
Duke in 1962, but noted, “From
a selfish viewpoint. being chosen
to the All-American teams has
been my greatest thrill because
I had always dreamed of mak-
ing All-American.”

Looking back, Hetzel summed
up. “If I had to do it again, I
would definitely go to Davidson
College. To me there is no bet-
ter place to play basketball in
North Carolina than at Davidson
and at Charlotte. Lefty accom-
plished almost everything he
said he would when I came here.

“Fred Hetzel is the best big
