Seigler Offers Complete Bidding Plan

To The Editor:

Each year at this time
some senior decides to make
some reflections upon his
four years at Davidson. Rath-
er than reminisce about
great experiences and friend.
ships, I would like to discuss
the need and prospectus for
continued change and prog-
ress,

We have come a long way
in the past four years. Re-
strictions are slowly being
lifted. There is more concern
for fellow students, which
can be seen in the philosophy
behind the extended rush
program.

As a senior, I hope the stu-
dents here will continue to
examine other avenues for
expressing greater concern
for their fellow students, col
lege and community. I would
like to see Davidson become
bolder in its outlook, showing
greater leadership in adopt-
ing policies to promote an
impreved academic and so-
cial atmosphere. American
colleges and universities des-
perately need such leader-
ship. .

As students, it is often eas.
ier to coraplain and demand

changes than it {fs for us to.

make gambles ourselves
about which we are unsure
and which may cause hard-
ships.

But if we are to be called
leaders, if we want respon-
sibility, then we must. dare
to make changes if they are
needed. We must continually
look for ways to improve the
life at Davidson for all the
students.

One change which might
be beneficial) for Davidson
students would be the insti-
tion of 100 per cent bidding
during rush. Though frater-
nity members often are
aghast at the suggestion, this
alternative to the present
system would show student
initiative, concern and per-
haps imagination in working
to solve an old problem at
Davidson. ;

The arguments on both
sides must be weighed care
fully. Other schools which
have taken the lead and tried
such proposals should be
consulted and visited.

While there is not enough
room ‘to discuss the argu-
ments in full detail, I would
like to point out some con.
siderations needing discus-
sion.

One argument against 100
per cent bidding would be
that it endangers the status
quo in a system that works
well for most students. Also
fraternities might expect to
experience trouble with ‘‘na.
tional," perhaps ending in
the revocation of some char
ters.

One should also consider
the effect of 100 per cent bid-
ding on the mystic aura of
brotherhood if a student is
invited to a house where he
might have been blackballed
otherwise.

The crucial question is:
How important is the black
ball to brotherhood? Finally,
there might arise the prob-
lem of having enough room
for additionalmembers,
which conceivably could lead
to another house.

Further consideration to
these problems should be

Richardson Scholars Ask
School To Change Program

To The Editor:

With the year rapidly draw-
ing to a close, we under.
signed Richardson Scholars
would like to express our
thanks to the Davidson Col-
lege community and the Rich-
ardson Foundation for mak-
ing our stay possible and re-
warding.

Since the Richardson Foun-
dation is withdrawing its
support from the foreign stu-
dent program, we think that
this is the time to re-evalu-
ate the program and make
some constructive sugges-
tions for its improvement.

The program has generally
two aims. One is the benefit
incurred from a cultural ex-
change. The other is purely
academic. Since this is only
a one-year program, it seems
that the first aim ‘should be
Stressed.

Experience shows this not
to be the case. Ideally the
two aims should be combin-
ed. But to do this the foreign
student cannot be looked up-
on as a regular Davidson
student. For various reasons
this is true.

There are among us basic:
ally two groups—those who
come to Davidson primarily
for the cultural benefit and
those who come primarily
for the academic benefit. The
former are vastly in the ma-
jority, but the position of the
latter must not. be slighted.
If a foreign student wants to
concentrate: on his studies,
he should be able to.

But if he seeks knowledge
about the American way of

life. provision should’ be.

made. As the program now
stands, the foreign student is
forced to put acadeiniics first.
Some Richardson Scholars
have blatantly refused to do
this. .

We think that:

(1) applicants should be no-
tified of what precisély will
be expected of them in the
classroom (we were not): (2)
those who control the foreign
student program should
clearly redefine it in such a
way that they recognize the

fact that most foreign stu-
dents do not come to the
Unietd States: to concentrate
on studies simply because
they will receive no credit
for their pains unless they
plan to continue at another
American university;

(3) there should be a
chance for supervised inde.
pendent work, ‘in which a
foreign student could study
those things which are com-
mon knowledge to Davidson
students—e.g., the racial sit-
uation, the poverty problem,
or the systems of elections
and government; and finally.

(4) there should be a great-
er opportunity for the vari-
ous foreign students to use
their cultures to diversify the
academic environment.

We think. that. the goals of
such a cultural exchange as
this one are not being ef-
fected mainly because the
present program does not
recognize that most of the
foreign students do not come
to Davidson for the same
reasons that the rest of the
student body does.

We invite those of you who
are responsible for making
the policies affecting foreign
students, the Richardson
Scholars who disagree with
this statement and anyone
else who is interested to a

cuss informally the issues
which we have tried to raise.

given. Indeed the status quo
would be endangered if with
such an experiment, no one
can bé sure of the results.

Under this year s improved
extended rush program, 80-
85 per cent of the freshmen
will receive bids. But this
still leaves.15-20 per cent who
will not have the opportun-
ity to experience fraternity
life. What would the change
mean to them?

The question of brother.
hood is central. Would the
presence of perhaps three
more students a year at each
house ruin the brotherhood?
Is the fraternity’s goal unan
imity or friendship toward
the members of the house?
What is the responsibility of
the ‘‘system’’ toward each
student at Davidson College?

There are obvious advan.
tages to 100. per cent bidding.
The system would become a
source of pride for all the
students. Each would be of
fered its advantages (and at

. Davidson these advantages

are needed). None would feel
its rejection.

The life of the Independent
would also become a more
viable possibility. Each stu
dent would have open to him
this way of campus life be.
cause of his own choice, not
because of the necessity.
caused by rejection.

Such a system could be im-
plemented with relative ease.
Perhaps it would be best that
each student could be as
sured at least two bids. giv
ing the student the final
choice. This is not as drastic
as it might seem in that it
would not affect a large num-
ber of students and yet
would increase student initia.
tive in choosing the frater.
nity.

The bids to all the fresh-
men could be sent, out at the
same time. Each freshman
could list his preferences
concerning fraternities, so
fraternity presidents could
know more about thosé not
receiving bids and work: to
match those students with
the houses that would re
ceive them best and that the
studént himself preferred.

Of course the above does
not even pretend to answer
all the questions or problems

concerning 100 per cent bid.

ding: But I do hope that .it
might create some open de-
bate and discussion about
this alternative to the pres
ent system.

The students would also
have to decide for themselves
the importance of ‘‘national.”
Is it the student or the name
that makes the fraternity?
Would the fraternity men be
willing to sacrifice the latter
for the sake of fellow stu-
dents?

Admittedly the adoption of
such a system would require
some sacrifices on the part
of students. especially of

those in the more selective
fraternities. And it would
require the acceptance, open.
ly and with friendship. ‘of
some students who otherwise
would not receive bids.

Of some students, this will
be asking a lot. It will re-
quire maturity and judg-
ment on the part of both the
freshmen and _ upperclass-
men. But if Davidson College
is to be a leader, its stu-
dents should take the lead.
The possibility of 100 per
cent bidding needs further
discussion.

Fraternities Alter Attitudes
Toward Extended Rushing

After an. initial dislike of
the extended rush program
because “it was something
the faculty had crammed
down our throat.”” fraterni-
ties reversed’ their attitude,
according ‘to IFC President
Bobby Vagt. .

Vagt said the program is
now viewed '‘as a really goud
deal alt around,’ and term
ed the number of extended
rushees receiving bids as
“remarkable.” Eleven out of
the 33 in extended rushees

have received bids and one
has become a social affili-
ate. ‘

The extended rush program
was instituted this year after:
national offices: turned down
a program of social affilia-
tion for all students going
through, rush and not receiv-
ing bids. *

Of the 33 who participated
in the program the first quar-
ter after rush, seven dropped
out before the second quaf-
ter, and 14 continued. The

Guy Owen Cites Strength
Of Southern

By DICK ANDERSON
Asst. Managing Editor

Guy, Owen, English profes-
sor and author of “‘The Flim-
Flam Man," spoke on South
ern writing in the Blow-Up
‘68 series Tuesday night at
the Sigma Alpha Epsilon
house.

Owen, who is also editor
of several Southern poetry
reviews, said that during the
late twenties and thirties a
great renaissance had oc-
curred in the literature of
the South, which H. L. Merte-
ken had once likened to a
“Sahara of the beaux arts.”

According to Owen, this
renaissance was due to ad.
vantages common to all
Southern writers. ‘‘For one
thing, Southern writers have

“There is nothing automat-
ic about promotions at David-
son,”’ Johnston said. “They
are based partly on depart.
ment recommendations and
partly on length of time at
Davidson, but the main fac-
‘or is the ability of the pro-
fessor.’

He Said there is no formal
committee which deals with
promotions. The final deci-
sion rests with the dean of
the faculty.

A person who has taught
seven years at an institution
of higher learning, at least
four of which were at David-
son, usually receives tenure
after this period.

There is no specific re-
quirement of a certain de-
gree to get tenure, Johnston
said, but the person must be
a member of a Christian
church and in basic agree-
ment with the purpose of the
college.

“Promotions are often held
back a year or two because
of a tight budget."’ he said,
“or because there are al-
ready too many feople at a
certain level in a particular
department.”

Students are not usually
consulted in making the pro-
motions, he added.

a tremendous number of lo-
cal dialects which they can
draw on,"’ Owen said. *‘Mark
Twain, for example, boasted
in ‘Huckleberry Finn’ that
he had used not one but sev-
en different dialects.”

Another advantage was that
Suotherners have developed
the “art of anecdotes.”
which Owen said enabled
Southern writers to draw on
a large fund of stories and.
jokes for the material of
their knowledge.

‘Also. having spent their
lives in one locality due to
the old Jack of mobility in
Southern life, Southern. writ.
ers were able to rely on a
strong.sense of place to set
their characters in concrete
situations.

Owen illustrated thesd ad
vantages by reading a selec-
tion from ‘’The Flim Fiam
Man,"’ which had all three
of these elements.

Told in a Catawba region
dialect, the selection was
taken from a_ story Owen
once overheard about a
moonshiner who became. a
crusading minister in the
area. It was set in Owen's
own home region, with char-
acters drawn from the peo-
ple of his boyhood.

On the other hand, Owen
pointed out that all Southern

Dobbs Gets Grant
For Radio Station

Ed Dobbs, chairman of the
student committee for a
school radio station, reported
Wednesday that the commit-
tee had received an Activi-.
ties Grant of $1.000 for the
installation of the station
next fall.

Dobbs presented an itemiz-
ed report to the Union Board
early this week stating that
he needed the grant for such
things as research on other
school radio stations, a trans-
mitter, installation costs, and
the publication of a monthly
broadcast brochure.

Next year the station will
depend on college funds for
its support, Dobbs said. The
committee is seeking foun-
dations to support the sta-
tion in the future, he added.

writers have certain inherent
disadvantages.

‘Southerners are general
ly timid and shy and tend to
be very conservative,’ Owen
said, ‘‘and they are not the
ones to make breakthroughs
in communicating expcrieuc
es."

As evidence Owen pointed
out that long after New ng-
landers had quit imitating
the English, the Southern
writers were still writing
what Owen termed ‘‘shallow
and superficial’’ imitations
cf English literature.

Owen also feels that South
ern authors write under the
shadow of the -great South-
ern novelists of the thirties,
such as William: Faulkner.
Owen likened the shadow to
that under which the drama-
tist of post-Shakespeare Eng-
land had to write, ‘‘with the
great figure of Shakespeare
looming over his shoulder.”*

According to Owen, this
difficulty is due to the fact
that many believe present
day Southern duthors are
writing at the end of the
Southern renaissance.

Under the new schedule,
rush parties will be held
Thursday and Friday nights
and Saturday and Sunday af
ternaons during the [irst week
of the second term, with bids
to be . mailed out Sunday
night and returned Monday
morning.

Assistant Dean of Students
Jim Terry reported that aca.
demic averages of four fra-
lernities averaged over 1.9
and indicated that the facul-
ty was pleased.

Terry also réported an un.
usual number of parking tick-
ets for cars on the fraternity
court, and also asked for ac-
tion on complaints of cars
parking on the grass in front
of fraternity houses.

The new rush schedule was
instituted as a result of com-
plaints about the week of
study lost in rush: Rush par-
ties have taken three hours
per night Monday through
Thursday under the present
system, with fraternity meet:
ings afterwards, which often
continue until 3 or 4 a.m.

SGA Committee Organizes
New Recruiting Program

By GEORGE ALLEN
News Editor

An SGA committee has
been organized to encourage
more student participation
in high school recruiting, ac.
cording to Gary Henschen, a
member of the Student Re-
cruiting Committee.

Henschen said that stu-
dents involved in the pro-
gram will visit the high
schools near their homes
during vacation periods.

“We are going to concen-
trate on high schools where
the fewest number of David-
son students are from’,’ said
Henschen. ‘'Primarily Negro
and low income schools,”’ he
added.

The recruiting program
will consist of three stages.
The student will first hold a
group meeting with those
high school students who ap.
pear qualified for Davidson.

The recruiter will then hold

individual conferences with
those students who are real-
ly interested in Davidson.
Finally, the committee will
try to send recruiters to all
the college days in the high
schools in North Carolina.

Those students interested
in singing up for the recruit.
ing program are encouraged
to contact Henschen, Gary
Cash or Steve Engstrom.
There will be an orientation
session for those who volun-
teer for the program.

The student recruiting pro-
gram was begun by former
Student Body President Tom
Earnhardt, while he was
secohd vice-president. but
ran into difficulties in the
past year when Earnhardt
was unable to continue per.
sonal direction of the pro-
gram.
