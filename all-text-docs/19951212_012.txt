Turkey

would be the wild turkey.

It was probably a tradition for
the men of the family to go into the
woods and hunt the bird, but, even-
tually, that tradition was lost. The
wild turkey was so abundant and
“American” that some proposed it
be the national bird, but due. to
habitat loss, the wild turkey
dwindled in number so much that
it existed in only the most remote
areas.

A tradition was nearly lost,
but, more importantly, a magnifi-
cent bird was almost lost. Thanks
to extensive relocating efforts of
Fish and Game departments across
the country in conjunction with the
National Wild Turkey Federation,
we once again can see the wild
turkey out in the open.

Hunters from all over are
catching the bug much like I did
that autumn morning, and now. I
am an avid turkey hunter. Although
most turkey seasons are in the
spring, many states are opening
fall seasons as -wild turkey num-
bers continue to rise.

The rewards of hunting wild
turkeys are many. Not only is the
turkey cunning and hard to outwit,
but when you finally outsmart one,
you will quickly realize that its
table fare is much greater than that
of the its farm-raised cousin.

Just seeing one of these stately
birds in the wild paints a picture in
my head of Thanksgivings past,
reviving the warm thoughts of be-
ing with family and giving thanks
for the bounty which nature offers.

B-ball

from page 10

Earlier in the week on Tues-
day night, the Wildcats suffered
their first loss of the season, losing
on the road to UNC-Wilmington
73-56.

After a first half in which both
teams shot horrendously, the
Seahawks solved their shooting
woes in the second half, coming
back from a 24-22 deficit to rattle
off 51 points. Conversely,
Davidson’s problems continued

-and UNC-Wilmington won con-

vincingly.
The Wildcats converted just
31 percent from the floor, but the
Seahawks shot 47 percent.
Davidson next faces Farleigh-
Dickinson on Saturday at 3:30 p.m.
in Belk Arena.
