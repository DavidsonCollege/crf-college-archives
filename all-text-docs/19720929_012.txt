Kresge Gives Grant

Davidson College will receive
a $300,000 grant from the
Kresge Foundation of Bir-
mingham, Mich., for its new E.
H. Little Library if the
remaining funds for’ the
building are raised within one
year.

‘With this most recent gift
from Kresge, we now have a
total of $3 million in cash and
pledges for our $4.2 million
library,"’ said Donald Winston,
director of development at
Davidson. ‘‘Their requirement
that we raise the remaining $1.2
million by June 15, 1973, one
year before the building's com-
pletion, is a challenge for all of
us.

“The fact that a contract for
the building has been let and
construction has begun in-
dicates our confidence that we

can meet these goals with the
continuing help and loyal sup-
port of everyone interested in
Davidson.”

The library will be named for
E. H. Little of New York City,
who grew up near Davidson and
became board chairman and
chief executive officer of the
Colgate Palmolive Company.
Little is a former chairman of
Davidson's Board of Visitors
and an honorary alumnus as an
Ll. D. recipient. He has given
Davidson $1 million for its
library on the condition that it
raise the remaining funds
before the building is com-
pleted.

The Kresge Foundation, since
its incorporation in 1924, has
given some $110 million to
educational, cultural, and
health-care institutions.
