Early last summer David-
son received notice from the
Ford Foundation that it had
been selected as a recipient
of a $7.7 million challenge
grant. If Davidson could
raise $5.5 million in the
nevt three years, the Foun-
= would give $2.2 mil-

on.

The special program under
which Davidson was selected
was begun four years ago by
Ford to help the leading inde
pendent liberal arts colleges of
the country realize their full
potential.

Of the many colleges and uni-
versities receiving major Ford
challenge grants Davidson is
only the fifth Southern school
to qualify.

Earlier grants include those
to Austin College in Texas, Stet
son University in Florida, Su
wanee in Tennessee, and South
western at Memphis.

On what basis then, was
grant made? In _ short it is
based on past performances: the
ability to produce graduates cap
able in their fields and in com-
munity leadership, the ability to
earn financial support, and the
desire to become a truly national
college through an ambitious
program of qualitative advance

space and more books are need-
ed to implement the primary
object of the proposed expan-
sion of the honors, independent
studies, and seminar programs.

At present a study is being
conducted on the problems and
needs of the libraries of col-
leges comparable to Davidson.

As the basis for the “brains,
not bricks” decision, the overall
goals of the college had to be
considered. Would Davidson be-

developing eventually perhaps
into a small university, or would
it continue in its present course
to becoming the best small lib
eral arts college in the South?
The latter was chosen and the
implications were far-reaching.

In this basic decision can be
seen the other decisions to in-
crease faculty salaries and study
opportunities, to expand the
seminar programs, to create
programs of artists in residence,
foreign study, team teaching,
visiting professorships, and con-
tinuing education.

Yet within the limits of a 1000 |

man residential college, there —-

are still possibilities for educat- —
ing more men through the Jun- ©

ior Year Abroad program, the
expansion of the Advanced
Placement program, and the
encouragement of year-round
college study in order to gradu
ate in three years.

These are the goals and a few
of their implications. The Ford

Foundation challenge grant will :

make possible the realization of
many of these prospects.

Grant Also Provides
Physical Improvements

By JAMIE BRYANT
Davidsonian Feature Writer

Although the accrued
benefits of the funds raised
during the current drive to
match the Ford grant will
be “brains not bricks”.
there will be some physical
improvements in the David-
son College plant.

The plant itself will not be af-
fected directly by the money
raised, since it will go into
the endowment, but income
from this increase will be used

pand existing facilities,

New science facilities are
planned for the period ten years
extending through 1975. Recent
discoveries in the physical
sciences are requiring more
complex and more diversified

| equipment at the undergraduate

level.

The library which will re-
ceive prime consideration, still

has room for about 50,000 addi-

tional volumes, but the need
for more room still exists. More
earrels for study, and facili-

ties for the proposed expan-
sion of honors work will be

added.

There is a possibility for a
general expansion of the library
itself. or even a new library,
bui this is not definite at this
early date.

Another item that will be of

be the plans for air-conditioning
several of the newer dorms.
This would probably include
Richardson and Belk dorms
since Richardson is already
wired for this

This would put added em-
phasis on the summer programs
for advanced students who
might wish to graduate in three
years. It would also include
educational programs for
alumni business, and industrial
executives, as well as work-
shops for pre-college students.

There would be modernization
of the classroom and offices of
Chambers which would involve
air-conditioning, lighting, and
general improvements. Work in
Chambers would also include
Chambers Auditoriums where
new seating and accoustical
treatment would be added.

Another possible use of funds
would be in the line of addition-
al housing for faculty and staff.
The most critical need is for
apartments and houses that
could be used by professors
during their first year at David-
son,

Improvements in the physical
education department are also
included in the future plans.

The intramural program also
calls for additional gymnasium
space as well as expanded play-
ing fields. Additions at the Lake
Campus may also include facili
ties for open air lectures, thea-
ter, and concerts.

A new Guest House is needed
that would be a facility equal
to the demands of visiting par-
ents and alumni, as well as
housing for visiting professors,
visiting lecturers, and visiting
artists who will be coming to
Davidson under the expanded
educational program. This is
most acute because Davidson
has no motel facilities nearby to
take care of this need.

Any plans whatsoever on build-
ing an adjacent girls’ school are
wholly in the most preliminary
of discussion stages. To carry
this plan out would cost from
$35-40 million above and beyond
the projected $25.3 million ten-
year goal.

In the light of these funda-
mental improvements, the edu
cational program of the college
will be remodeled. These pro
posals include:

*Increased seminar and tutor
ial instruction for upper level
students. The increased liter-
ary resources of the new
library facilities will make
a greater emphasis on these
and expanded comprehen-
sive examination criteria
possible. Independent study
projects for students are also
being considered.

“Special work for gifted stu-
dents in cooperation with
graduate schools in the area.
It is possible that such stu-
dents could earn credit to-
ward their M.A. degree
while enrolled at Davidson.
Such a program is now in
progress for a Davidson stu-
dent in physics in coopera-
tion with UNC.

Many of these vital improve
ments in the academic com
position of Davidson College
have already taken form

For example Spain has been
added to France and Germany
in the Junior Year Abroad Pro-
gram, with Hawaii also being
considered, and in recent years
Drs. Lobanov and Adinaryan
have visited the campus and
presently Dr. Hayes is with the
Socialogy Department.

The possibility of Eugene Or-
mandy conducting seminars in
the Cunningham Fine Arts
Building, an Institute for Soviet
Studies being housed in the
present Library structure, or
Davidson professors being al-
lowed a sabbatical year for
every three years which they
teach at Davidson may seem
remote to most of us.

Nevertheless, the power of
the dollar should not be under-
estimated. The Ford Founda.
tion Challenge Grant and the
overall ten-year, twenty-five
mililon dollar campaign could
transform such dreams into real-
ity, and add meaning to the
phrase, “‘Davidson, the pace-

maker for higher education in
the South.”
