been girls’ athletic director, head girls’ basketball coach, head volleyball

teams at Latin racked up a 67-19 mark, appeared in the state final four
three years in a row and won the 1991 state title, His overall record in 12
years as girls’ basketball coach at Latin and Kentucky Country Day
School is 217-89. In six seasons coaching volleyball, Filar compiled a
114-44 record, and led Latin to the 1989 state championship.

Tom Quinn: Quinn’s arrival at Davidson marks a reunion with his
former coach Dave Fagg. Quinn was a three-year letterman at Arizona,
where Fagg served as associate head coach before returning to Davidson.
While at Arizona, Quinn played in the 1986 and 1990 Aloha Bowls and

year received his master’s degree there. At Davidson, Quinn will coach

Women's Basketball to Return?

By Holt Hathaway
Davidson’ s return to the South-

__ | ernConference may also mean the
~ | return of a women’s varsity bas-

ketball team.
Several Davidson women have

: : )| kept the sport alive here as a club
‘| team which played in a women’s

league in Charlotte. This year will
be a sort of trial season to deter-
mine if there is enough interestand
support to bring the team back: to
varstiy status. ©

One key element of ateam isa

| coach. Wenow have thatrolefilled _

by new head coach John Filar.
Filar has twelve successful years
of coaching women’s basketball
onthe high school level and seems
well-prepared for and excited about
coaching on the college level.
Filar’s first nine years of coaching
were spent at Kentucky Country
Day School, and the past three
years he coached at Charlotte Latin.

Inhis twelve seasons of coach-
ing, Filar has come out with seven
twenty-win seasons! At Latin, he
took his team to the final four of
state competition all three years.

The first year they lost by one
point. But last year he paid back
that debt with a one-point victory
to take the state finals! Also, last
season, he achieved his 200th win!

The task at hand is a challeng-
ing. one, but Filar is “super-ex-
cited” to have the opportunity to
begin the program from the ground
up.

For anyone interested in trying
out for the team, an organizational
meeting will be held on September
11, at Baker Underground. -
