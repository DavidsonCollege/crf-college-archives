Valentine's & Davidson romance

By Katy Moore

Another year has passed and
Valentine's Day has inevitably ar-
rived. Some look forward toa day
dedicated to romance and others
dread being surrounded by pink
and red hearts. As couples across
the country exchange cards and
candy, the question arises; How
many people here will be receiv-
ing roses from their Davidson val-
entines?

There seems to be growing
campus concern about the dating
situation at Davidson. Letters writ-
ten to The Davidsonian on the
subject express the concern that
dating at Davidson is virtually non-
existent and male/female relations
have been reduced to drunken,
and often anonymous, one-night
stands.

In her letter to the editor
printed on January 31, senior Katey
Hines outlined what she has
learned about Davidson's dating
situation through an "informal
survey." She attributed Davidson's
"weird social habits" to miscom-
munication. She argued that both
men and women oncampus would

like to date, but no one is willing to
take the initiative. Essentially,
Hines suggested that women hang
up the "stale tradition" of waiting
for the phone to ring and start ask-
ing men out.

In another letter printed last
semester, Fred Campagne pinned

Dating at

Davidson

The first in a series

the problem on the age-old double
standard: girls who hook up a lot
are "sluts," guys who hook up are
"studs" or, if it's really bad,
"scammers." Her insight raises
new questions: Why would
Davidson men take the time and
effort to get to know the women
they take home from parties when
there will always be another party,
another girl? Are Davidson women
asking too much from men who
enjoy spontaneous, no strings at-
tached hooks?

But are we making generali-

zations that only guys enjoy these
one night stands?

Whether the problem lies in
miscommunication or in one sex's
denial that there even is a problem
is difficult to tell. Dr. Dewitt
Crosby of the counseling center,
however, says that many students
and professors have approached
her and expressed their discontent
with Davidson's dating scene. The
center has even gone so far as to
organize a Dating Forum this week
to talk about dating and hooking
up.

Why the need for a forum?
"There is something uniquely odd
about dating at Davidson," says
Crosby. The forum will give men
and women a chance to share their
perspectives.

Is the dating scene on thiscam-
pus really "unique"? Is Davidson
really "notorious for its weird so-
cial habits," as Katey Hines indi-
cates in her letter? If so, is the
problem a recent one, and what is
its source? The questions are end-
less and the answers vague, but
there is certainly room for argu-
ment and speculation.

Students will let down their

- guard and confront issues with the

help of a screen, a mechanized
voice distorter, and a secret selec-
tion process at a discussion spon-
sored by Counseling Services in
the 900 Room on Wednesday, Feb-
tuary 16 at 8 p.m.

Dr. David Staton, Director of
the Davidson Counseling Center,
and his colleagues recognized that
the feelings which students express
in a confidential setting only could
be beneficial toothers. Students in
counseling sessions have repeat-
edly expressed the concerns that
there is not a good vehicle for
dating, that sexual inactivity in
males is considered unmasculine,
and that there is no balance be-
tween casual and serious dating at
Davidson.

The Counseling Center staff
believes that increased dialogue
on these and other dating issues
could improve understanding be-
tween thesexes. The panel intends
to facilitate this dialogue, and an
effort has been made to create a
low-risk setting, allowing students
to speak without fear of ridicule.

Panel to address campus dating

their thoughts. Then the audience
will address the panel either ver-
bally or anonymously on question
sheets. After the question and an-
swer period, Don and Meg Kimmel
will mediate an open discussion.

Three male and three female
students will serve as an anony-
mous panel. Counseling services
selected the panel through inter-
views with students known by the
counseling staff or recommended
by other students.

According to Staton, the stu-
dents were selected for the panel
because they are “articulate and
inclined to talk,” and because they
reflect the various points of view-
- datingseriously andcasually, dat-
ing on-campus and off-campus, or
not dating at all.

Dr. Staton is the only one who
knows the identity of the panel
members. Anonymity will be re-
tained after Wednesday by the
members who have pledged not to
identify themselves.

Staton says, “The panel could
be really interesting or it could be
aturkey- that dependson howmuch
students are willing to open up, but
we’ve decided to invest our time to

Panel members will express _ try to pull it off.”
