Council, was well satisfied with the
results of rush week in that all fra-
ternities adherred to the new rules
pretty rigidly.

Competition was greater this
year, due to the presence of a
tenth fraternity on the Davidson
campus. The Delta’ Kappa’s, a

local fraternity, are petitioning the
National Chapter Sigma Chi.
Handicapped last year by not hav-
ing a fraternity house, they took
their place in fraternity court this
fall and are now occupying l’ro-
fessor Conner's old home.

The rush parties usually started
at seven each evening and lasted
until ten, Each fraternity was al-
lowed one late night on which
their party lasted until twelve, Sev-
eral of the fraternities highlighted
“their parties by inviting girls from
Queens and the surrounding towns
to visit with them. Saturday the
formal bids were sent out and at
2:30 the rushees went to the fra-
ternity house of his choice.

This year one hundred-and sixty-
five men accepted bids from fra-
ternities. | The following men
