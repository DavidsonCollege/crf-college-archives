NUMBER NINETEEN

Fraternity Committee Makes Two Preliminary Proposals

The Fraternity Evaluation
Committee presented two
proposals in its official “Pre-
liminary Report” which
Chairman Will Jackson pre-
sented at the Student Coun-
cil meetingMonday night.

The report made the following
recommendations: ‘‘ (1) that a
campus-wide social committee
be set up to plan and carry out
all major social functions for

the entire student body, and (2)
that a fixed social fee be charg-

ed to all students, and that the
funds from this fee be allocated
to the campus-wide social com-
mittee and the College Union for
the financing of social activities
and entertainment.

“Such an arrangement would
provide better campus social
functions for all students of the
College . . . Increased funds
would be available-for social ac-
tivities, and an expanded pro-
gram... would be possible.

This change also serves to
lessen the dichotomy which has
existed on campus between the
advantages for the fraternity
man and those for the Independ-
ent”

Although Jackson: emphasized
that these were '‘two concrete
proposals,” he went on to say
that any recommendations were,
as such, tentative. Once passed
through the Student Council, any
proposals would then be referred
to the IFC, faculty, or adminis-
tration.

a fixed social fee would have to

Council Gets Report,
Waits For Final Draft

Staff Writer

the Fraternity Evaluation Committee on Monday but

turned “thumbs-down” on
future reports.

With all council members pres-
ent, President Will Jackson
briefly explained his commit-
tee’s report, concluding with the
“hope” that the final report
would come within two or three
weeks.

He emphasized, ‘‘We are close
to some answers on this matter,
but I would rather not be forced
to set a certain date.”

The ensuing discussion con-
cerned a motion by Johnny Gres-
ham that “‘a committee report
be made on March 22.” Pointing
out that the new Student Coun-
cil members will take office on
April 5, he said, “I feel that
the present council should have
a part in the final decision.”

TIME ELEMENT

Supporting the Gresham mo-
tion, David Walker asked, ‘Will
the committee be finished before
the new officers take over?”

Jackson's tentative deadline of
“two or three weeks” left the
question in doubt, especially
since the present council has
only three more scheduled meet-
ings before its term expires.

Fred Sackett explained.
“Should the committee delay its
final report until after April 5,
the new president of the Student
Body would have to assume the
chairmanship.”

After Jackson's reminder that
he and two other seniors wouid
still advise the new council, he
added that a set deadline “would
slow down the progress of the
committee.”

Tom Frist agreed: ‘There's
no sense making a haphazard
report.”

MOTION DEFEATED

Finally the council defeated
Gresham's motion by a vote of
6-7. Any future council action
will thus depend on the com-
pletion of the committee's re-
port. Even then the final power
to act on any recommendations
will rest with the “people in
power''—the faculty after study
by Faculty Committee on Fra-

setting a deadline for any

main on the squad without re-
election.

In order to replace the four!

graduating seniors, the rising
senior, junior, and sophomore
classes would elect four new
squad members in the ratio of
two to one to one. Powell says
“this system would give more
continuity and opportunity’; it
would encourage more partici-
pation in these elections.

Trustees," Jackson said.

In a DAVIDSONIAN article
last week Jackson said that he
did not expect the report to
contain any recommendations.
When questioned as to why the
report did include two definite
proposals, he explained, “The
committee worked much faster
than I had expected. It agreed

on these recommendations and
wanted to Include them in its re-
port.”

Jackson added, ‘‘There prob-
ably will not be a general Stu-
dent Body election on these or
future proposals.’’ Unable to set
a certain date for the commit-
tee's final decision, he would

only say, ‘I hope that we may

through this interim report to
answer briefly the basic ques-
tion,. ‘Are the fraternities serv-

there specific steps that might
be taken to better serve these

The 12-man evaluation team

The faculty vow, another of
the big issues on campus, was
only briefly touched upon at the
meeting with the annnouncement
by President D. Grier Martin
that the Education Committee
of the Trustees will meet Tues-
day, March 9.
NEW vow

This committee, which is
working closely with Martin, is
in the process of drawing up a
substitute that would be satis-
factory to both the trustees and
the faculty. Two previous vows
adopted by the trustees have
drawn considerable opposition
from various faculty members.

President Martin described
the hour-long faculty meeting
as “mostly routine,” with var-
dous reports and announcements
made. Dr. Adinarayan, David-
son's visiting professor of psy-
chology from India, and David-

weakness, and personnel chan-

After these’ preliminary de-
partmental studies were con-
cluded, the faculty was divided
into eight topical committees:
Organization and Administra-
tion, Educational Program, Fi-
nancial Resources, Faculty, Li-
brary, Student Personnel, Physi-
cal Plant, and Research.

At the present time, the Steer-
ing Committee, headed by Dean
of Faculty Frontis Johnston. is
in the process of going over
these first reports with each
committee and offering recom-;
mendations toward finishing the
final drafts. The individual com-
mittee results are expected to
be concluded by the end of the
semester, after which the Steer-
ing Committee will review, con-:
solidate, and integrate them
into a final unified presentation

to be printed over the summer.

ern Association is scheduled to
inspect the campus for. several
days this November analyze the
self-study, and offer suggestions |
and criticisms concerning it.

The self study is expected to
be of permanent value in help-
ing to make Davidson a “better”
college. In preparing the re-
ports, the faculty and adminis-
tration have worked long and
hard, often as much as three
hours a week throughout the
two years.

For instance, the Educational
Program Committee has confer-
red with visiting authorities in
different fields, evaluated David-
son's program, and compared
their findings with similar self-

studies of such schools as Am-
herst, Williams, Reed, and
Carleton.

Of special interest to students
is the Student Affairs Commit-
tee, which has been investigating
such diverse aspects of student
life as fraternities, dormitory
life, social life, athletics, aca-
demics, and cultural activities.

Pietenpol stated that, as a re-
sult of the study, many changes
of both short and long-range
significance will be made. He
especially cited alterations in
course offerings and, perhaps,
minor changes in requirements
for graduation.

The loss of Doris Davis, who
was killed Sunday evening, was
mentioned by Martin. He com-
mented that she had “worked
in the Union for Slater Food
Service for eight years, and will

community.”

A brief and informal report on
his recent European tour was
given to the faculty by Martin.
In his remarks he expressed his
enthusiasm for the two David-
son Abroad programs which he
visited in France and Germany.
He commented that the vast,
majority of the boys in both
groups seemed to be getting
quite a lot out of the experience
and that the benefits of such a
program are not limited to a
purely academic realm.

Martin found that most of
the boys here were quite en-
thusiastic with their programs.

American cities.

The play is a study in satire
of Eng‘ish conventions, person-

ages, and institutions. Produc:

tion -is cast around a frame-
work of 23 short: scenes; each
on a different topical subject.
The actors demonstrate their
dexterity on a se. composed
of columns, arches, and. plat-.
forms, making possible rapid .
transition from scene to scene
with lttle set changing.

Von Unwerth mulled, ‘I have
been extremely disappointed in
student reaction to Beyond the
Fringe. It’s curious and unfor-
tunate that a departure, a truly
worthwhile departure, from the
norm should receive student
criticism.

“Beyond the Fringe will un-
doubtedly appeal to the un-
usual Davidson sense of humor.
It's strongly satiric, entertain-
ing. and on occasion, off-color.
T'm simply afraid that some
people will miss it because of
a basic environmental prejudice
against the theatre.”’ ;

ternity will enjoy parties fol-
