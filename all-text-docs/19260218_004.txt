Viter the few years of a man’s college life
come the adventanto a world that las start-

linely changed since childhood days. To
seme itis as the tinding of a new land by a
Mariner; others find it more or less familiar,

but none whe has ever experienced the jays
and vicissitudes of college life discovers
quite the same conditions that he left upon
his graduation from-ligh school,

Vnd when amin steps out of college with
a diploma in his hand he has to blaze his
pathway, in the direetion which he has
chosen to follow. Many will tind their way
made casier by the efforts af others, but it
remains for the majority to suifer alone in
the strugeles that certainly come. To what
extent aman is accorded commendation and
merited rewards depends largely upon the
effeet that he m: use S Upon pe ople with Whom

JAZZED HISTORY

A recent editorial by Rupert Hughes,
widely known novelist, in the Red Book,
has aroused a tidal wave of hostile critisism
throughout the length and breadth of the
United States. Treating as it does of George
Washington, a popular hero if there ever
was one, this piece of writing attacks the
character of one whom we have come to
regard as a sort of patron saint of our coun-
try. Certainly the editorial has met with

“HESS.

_

no favor in the regard of the masses of the
country,

Mr. Hughes, who is somewhat iconoclas-
tic in his writings, chooses to refer to Wash-
ington as a swashbuckling man of the times,
who swore and drank prodigously; a red-
haired ignoramtss who was a_ social lion
among the dark-eyed ladies of his time. The
writer throws aside all the little traditions
that we have come to regard as a part of the

history of our country as expressed in its
first President.
Mr. Hughes will get nowhere with this

kind of editorial comment because such a
character as George Washington is impreg-
nable to the attacks of minds who seck to
destroy images and ideals. \Washington’s
memory has de fied the test of time because
his character was of a firm foundation. No
man who experienced such hardships and

reverses as he, and kept a clear mind
through it all, can be accused of shallow-

Washington was loval and devoted in

“times of distress and grand in time of vic-

tory. [lis manner was that of a chivalrous
knight and he was never over-bearinge.
Lafavette, when he visited this country a
number of years after the Revolution, spoke
of Washington as a man among men. Jef-
ferson and Adams were of the same opinion.
Their judgment, with that of several million &
sensible \inericans who him twice
for the presidency and wished him to con-

chose

tinue in that. office, should count for some
thing more than any latter-day historian
who besmirks his work with suggestions

and glosses the weaknesses and foibles that
area part of every human lite, :

Wirshington had his faults as has every
one But we have discerned the tower-
ing manhood in the figure that dominated
\merica during the carly days of the for-
mation of the new country, Nad on his
Mirthday we should stop to consider the
traits of character and the humanness of
spirit that has made the name of
Washington renown and loved in
American home.

OUR DRAMATIC ISOLATION

One of the leading problems that face the
student

body today is our attitude toward

people of North Carolina. During the past

Phe objections to Davidson's entry inte
state-wide dramaties seem to be two-fold
lack of money and inadvisability of an ad-

ditional college activity,

that the Moving a troupe ot plavers

opinion that this objection could be re-
moved, one way or another, if the matter

The second objection is one that invelves
great possibility of difference of opinion
of honest and sincere opinion, There are
members of the Davidson faculty and mem
bers of the student body who say that Da-

whelmed by “student activities The en-
largement of the program of the dramatic
club would necessitate the opening of a

advisable is a matter that should be careful-

end it will be the students who will be most
aceutely injured or benefited by the out-

OUR ADVERTISERS

Co-operation is necessary to the success of any
line of endeavor. It is no less true in newspaper
lines than in any other business enterprise. The
important role played by business firms in the
life of newspapers cannot be over estimated be-

the financial phase is guaranteed.
