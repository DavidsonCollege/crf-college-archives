MEET V. M. I. HERE

“The old order giveth way to the new.”
New blood. Young blood. New systems and
new methods. These are the things one sees
in the new Davidson athletic reorganization.
: But. one has only to reflect upon the scien-
tific effects of blood transfusions to conclude
a practical result.

Doc Newtorand Gene McEver have come
to Davidson bringing with them the prin-
ciples installed by Coach Neyland of Ten-
nessee, principles of football which brought
only two defeats to the University of Tennes-
see in six years, Newton was associated with
Major Neyland last year and seems to be
absolutely sold on the Neyland system, while
McEver, the Wild Bull of the gridiron, has
had. direct contact with the system, having
played on three of the highly successful
Tennessee teams.

The two new coaches will not find things
around here similiar to those at Tennessee.
They will not find candidates sufficient for
six or seven teams—and then some for re-
serves. They will not discover ALL-Ameri-
cans hanging ‘around. Neither will they ob-
serve any man-mountain types obscuring the
horizon.

They will find, on the other hand, able and
willing men who will fight to the last ditch,
men who give all they can and then keep
giving. Perhaps they will find enough men
to make up three or four teams. Now and
then they may discover some outstanding
man with more than the usual ability—such
as Thad Brock, Dick Grey, Joe McCall and
others. But in the long run, Doe and Gene
will be dealing with just ordinary fellows.

Davidson students and alumni will do well
not to expect anything spectacular from the
teams Newton and McEver put out in the
beginning. Considerable confusion will
doubtless be in evidence because of the
change in systems. Once the systems are
grounded, however, with an average amount
of material, everything should be jake.

Having witnessed the first session of the
spring practice under the guidance of the
new coaches, this writer was impressed with
the way McEver and Newton stepped right
in and started things going, Only® a’ small
number of players was in evidence, the ma-
jority of regulars being engaged in other
activities, but despite this fact, both coaches
started in teaching the essentials in a way
which showed they knew their business. A
word of commendation for those doing their
work well, constructive criticism for the un-
certain, laconic comments for the grand-
standers—these marked the first practice.

Doc Newton: Apparently nonchalant, but
sees everything. He'll get what he wants
done the way he want it done or we'll know
the reason why. Those little cracks of his go
in a mile deep.

Gene McEver:

knows his business

Ambitious and earnest.

the tutelage of “Red” Laird cut loose and had
their opponents 22-11 when the half period
ended.

Mathis, Wildcat forward, led the scoring of
both teams with 13 points.

Final Rally Fails to
Win for Wildkittens

Despite a spirited final quarter rally, the Da-
vidson Wildkittens fell before the Lincolnton
Athletic Club five at Davidson Monday night.
The final score was 17 to 16.

During the first half the lead switched hands
several times, being a deadlock no less than
three times. The visitors pulled ahead and were
leading at half time, 10-6. In the last stages of
the game the Wildkittens renewed their hopes,
only to fall short of victory.

The playing of Carl Pritchett and Jim Proc-
tor, both former Davidson stars, was outstand-
ing for the Pritchett eight
points to tie for individual] scoring honors with

Newton and McEver Well Pleased
With Wildcat Gridiron Prospects

“Doc” Newton and Gene McEver, Davidson's
new coaches, were well pleased by the response
of the Wildcat gridiron candidates in their first
workout last Monday, held under the new lead-
ers.

McEver, especially, was impressed by the
showing several backfield candidates who
displayed speed and blocking abilities. Newton
was satisfied with the large number out for
line berths, but stated that size seemed to be
the thing lacking in the forward wall. He real-
ized that several others were not out for spring
practice because of basketball and wrestling.

of

The new leaders have already put the candi-
dates to work on perfecting plays which are to
be used next fall, Fundamental plays were given
the candidates Monday and others will be prac-
ticed and perfected during the spring session.
Drills in blocking, tackling, and other funda-
mentals will also be taken up.

Newton and McEver hope to start regular
scrimmages Friday. Their spring program will
include a game each Saturday afternoon during
the session between two evenly divided squads.

Davidson's system of attack will be changed
altogether. Newton and Melk ver, will introduce
the style of play used at the University of |
Tennessee to supplant the style which the Wild-
cat teams have used for the past ten years un-
der “Monk” Younger and “Tex” Tilson.

The faces of Captain Pritchett and “Tex”
Tilson will also be seen on the Wildcat grid-
iron for the next few weeks, until the new lead-
ers become fully acquainted with the candidates.
Younger will also render his services to spring
practices when not busy with the Freshman
basketball team.

Both Newton and Melver expressed a_ belief
that they would like Davidson. They were im-
pressed with the spirit here and stated that they
believed they could continue in the suecess of
“Monk” atid “Tex” with the full co-operation of
the student body and especially those out for
the varsity.
