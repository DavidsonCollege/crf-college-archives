Three
laptops
stolen from
library

By ANN Cup

Staff Writer

Students can study in Cham-
bers any time of the day or night
because the building stays open.
Book bags are often left to be
picked up by their owner later.
No one pockets the extra change
in the copier. Yet, Davidson is
still vulnerable. Signs in the
library read; “Due to recent thefts,
do not leave computers and other
equipment unattended.”

Senior Lauren Ellis’ com-
puter and CD player was stolen
from a second floor library car-
rel when she took a break for
lunch.

“It frustrates me because we
all trust the honor code so much
and it’s all going to hurt us when
we leave,” said Ellis. “You leave
doors unlocked and bags laying
around and you don’t think some-
one will steal something.”

In the month of November,
three laptops were stolen from
the library. Bikes and book bags
are continually reported as miss-
ing also.

Theft is not new to
Davidson, but the rash of occur-
rences has left many people wary.

Brian Campbell ‘99 says, “I
think it’s unfortunate that we
have to lock up our things. Al-
though Davidson isn’t the ‘real
world,’ the virtual world is no
better.”

Until a better answer is
found, signs will continue to be
posted which warn of real world
problems.

Residence life to conduct internal survey of operations
Students can express grievances and concerns in RLO in-house examination

By Kirsten RECKNAGEL

Davidson’s Residence Life
Office is “ready and willing to hear
what [students] have to say” about
on-campus housing, says RLO
Director Kurt Holmes.

As coordinator of all on-cam-
pus student housing, no student
leaves Davidson without coming
into contact with the Residence
Life Office.

RLO is currently under scru-
tiny by a 12 member committee
formed to conduct an in-house self
evaluation of the department.

Students Lucy Sherman and
David Derrick sit on the review
committee, as do several profes-
sors, the Associate Dean of Stu-
dents Leslie Marsicano, and staff
from Physical Plant, the
Controller’s Office, the Admis-
sions Office, and Health Services.

However, no representatives
of RLO are included in committee
membership.

“T sit in on [some] committee
meetings to answer questions,”
says Holmes.

He Says he gave the commit-
tee “carte blanche” to take their
review in any direction.

Ringle worries about
drug use on campus

By Kirsten: RECKNAGEL
News Editor

Although the on-campus use
of alcohol and marijuana is widely
recognized among students and
staff, Health Educator Georgia
Ringle worries about evidence of
harder drugs such as cocaine and
LSD on campus.

"I think we have reason to be
concerned," she says. Rohypnol, a
downer 20 times stronger than
Valium, has been "implicated in
date rape cases".

She says, "I have heard re-

ports of "roofies" in Charlotte
nighclubs As far as I'm concerned,
that's close enough. There's no
reason in the world that they may
not appear on campus."

“Roofies, a street name for
Rohypnol, is the second most com-
monly declared drug coming over

the Texas-Mexico border,” ac-
cording to a September 3 article in
the Charlotte Observer.

The scary thing about illegal
drugs is that they are not regulated,
says Ringle. "Most drug dealers
are going to cut their drug with
something."

"Cocaine in itself can be ex-
tremely powerful," she says, "but
combined with other substances it
can be an even more dangerous
drugs .... We have had some word
that it is present on this campus.."

"Very few people know the

source of their drug” and” on this
campus, very few people even re-
alize what they are experimenting
with,” Ringle says.

The campus _ police depart-
ment has also seen recent cases of
illegal drugs on campus. On De-
cember Sth, officers found an “un-
ruly white male” on Fourth Belk

Clark Ross, professor of eco-
nomics, serves as committee co-
chair.

He explains, “The aim is to
see if [RLO’s] mission is appropri-
ate ... and how well it is being
carried out.”

As part of the department’s
self-evaluation, this week the com-
mittee will distribute 700 seven-
page surveys to students living on
campus.

The surveys, which Holmes
says should take at most 15 min-
utes to complete, ask for students’
“honest and candid responses” on
such issues as co-ed housing, sub-

stance free housing, and TV cable
access.

Students comprise just one of _
several focus groups contacted by
the committee in the past weeks.

The group has also inter-
viewed RLO staff, zone mainte-
nance staff, and campus security.

Ross says the committee’s
evaluation efforts will “continue
into next semester with the aim of
finishing up in February.”

Following the current in-house
examination; RLO will be subject
to “an external review by experts,”
says Holmes.

"Students can come and talk

keep such discussions confiden-
tial.
