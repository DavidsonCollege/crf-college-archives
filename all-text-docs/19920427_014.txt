Track Teams Tackle the Southern Conference
Spears Takes
400m Hurdles Title

By Peter Hurtado

The men’s track and field team
ended its outdoor season this past
weekend at the Southern Confer-
ence Championships at Marshall
University with several historic
performances. The men placed
seventh out of eight teams with

eleven points.
Sophomore sensation Duncan
“Dunkin’” Spears became

Davidson’s first individual South-
ern Conference champion since the
late 1970's with his first place fin-
ish in the 400m hurdles at 54.93.
Duncan’s time of 54.26 two wecks
carlicr at the Duke Invitational
makes him Davidson’s second
fastest ever. A
Senior Ted “Otis” Richardson

ended his spectacular career witha
stellar 5000m performance of
15:17.5. Ted finishes as
Davidson’s fourth-best in the
5000m, and is certainly one of the
school’s finest mid-distance run-
ners ever. Senior Chris “Rock”
Otrok also closed out his outstand-
ing and steady career with fine per-
formances in the 1500m and 5000m
runs.

The 1500mcorpsof Pete “ICE”
Hurtado (4:03.4), Erik “E-Man”
McMichacl (4:08.7), and senior
John “Cutting Edge” Alsobrook
(4:15.7) ended their seasons with
personal best performances. Hur-

Golf Team Closes Season
at District II] Tournament

By Bruce Balestier

A year ago, the Davidson golf
team put together its finest season
in recent memory, a breakthrough
season that included a tournament
win at the Ferrum College Invita-
tional. So despite the loss to gradu-
ation of consistent senior Mike
Maggart, Davidson Coach Gordon
Miewz entertained.expectations of
a repeat performance. But, per-
haps owing to the youthful nature
of the team (almost entirely fresh-
men and sophomores), the scores
simply have not come this year.
Davidson closed out a rather dis-
appointing season with a seventh-
place finish at the Big South Con-
ference Championship and a last-
place showing among 23 teams at
the NCAA District II Tournament.

At the Big South Tournament,
held April 6-7 at the Colonial
Charters Golf Club in North Myrtle
Beach, S.C., the results went ac-

cording to form. As had happened
in previous tournaments, Davidson
finished well ahead of UNC-
Asheville but significantly behind
the other conference schools.
Davidson’s 326-322-331=979
gave them seventh .place over
UNCA by aslim 93 stroke margin.

As he has all year, sophomore
Will McDaniel-led the Wildcats,
shooting 81-80-79=240 to finish
22nd. Marc Raberalso played well,
shooting rounds of 80 and 78 in the
first and third rounds, but illness
forced him outof the secondround.
Freshman Hal Fogleman carded
the low Davidson score of the
tournament with a 76 that Mietz
saw asa breakthrough round. “[Hal
has] had very good nine-hole
rounds before, but this is the first
time he’s put two nine-hole scores
together,” Mietz said.

Women's Team Places Sixth

By Peter Hurtado

The Davidson women’s track
and field squad ended its season
last weekend with several outstand-
ing performances at the Southern
Conference Championships’ at
Marshall University. The women
placed sixth overall with fourteen
points.

Senior Kathy ‘“‘Teach” Beach
endedher historic career with some
stellar efforts. At the conference
championships, Beach placed sec-
ond in the 1500m and then fifth in

the 5000m later the same after-

noon. Two weeks earlier, she re-
corded a school-record time of
4:40.3 at the Duke Invitational.
Beach, truly Davidson’s finest
woman distance runner ever, fin-
ishes with school records in the
women’s indoor and outdoor

1500m, 3000m, and 5000m.
Freshman Maria “Mar-I-ya”
Whitehead finshed her sensational
season with a fifth-place finish at
67.6 in the 400m hurdles at the
conference meet. She also placed
eighth in the triple jump with a

jump of 33'3". Whitehead set the _

school record a week earlier witha
leap of 34' 4".

Heather “Zip” Tarpley placed
fifth in the discus with a hurl of
119’11". Tarpley hopes to eclipse
the outdoor record next season.

Jean “Jeez Louise” DeMoss
closed her season out with a per-
sonal best time of 5:08.6 in the

1500m. She will return next fall as

captain of the cross country team.

Freshman Carolyn “Muppet”
Meadows showed promise with
excellent performances in the

3000m (11:22) and 5000m (19:30)
at the Duke Mect. Meadows
showed her toughness at the con-
ference. meet, -gritting out the
10,000m run in 41:58 toplace 11th.

Lisa “Sit-ke” Sitek recorded
fine times in the 3000m and the
5000m to end her season. Sitek
looks to be a mainstay for the cross-
country squad next fall.

Coaches Andrew and Manson
were quite pleased with the squad’s
performances. Both bid a warm
farewell to senior captain Kathy
Beach, and are excited about the
promise shown by the underclass-
men.

Women's Lacrosse Finishes
7-2 Campaign in First Season

By Bruce Balestier

With wins over the club teams
from N.C. State and Duke over the
last three weeks, the Davidson
women’ lacrosse team completed
its initial season at the club level
witha7-2 record. Both lossescame
to the club team from North Caro-
lina.

The Wildcats claimed a 15-10
win over State April 5 in Raleigh in
what coach Betsy Brown frankly
called “a pretty easy game.” There
was plenty of playing time for
everyone, including some unex-
pected time in goal for freshman
Cat Grimmell. Grimmell, who had
never before played goalie, spent
the first half in goal when starter
Kelly Perry was late arriving for
the game.

_The Davidson attack domi-

nated the game; Claire Hall, Maria
Tucker, Nancy Hilles and Jennifer
Plowright combined for all the
scoring. Brown quipped that the
biggest obstacle for her team to
overcome was the noise from a
live band on an adjacent field.
Davidson closed out the sea-
son April 14 witha 15-12 win over
Duke in Durham. The ‘Cats opened
up a close game with a couple of
goals in the final quarter, and then
wentintoastall, keeping the ballin
their end for five minutes to pre-
serve the lead. Megan Snyder’s
seven goals powered the Davidson
attack; Hall, Plowright, Tuckerand
Hilles also scored. Brown gave
special credit to junior Jane Mount

‘for her“‘exceptional” performance

in goal.
Theteam’s success this season

is having an unforeseen effect on
next year’s schedule. Itis Brown’s
intention to schedule a number of
Division III schools from the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
next year, but the team’s win over
Division III Guilford may make
such schools wary of scheduling
Davidson. Teams may feel that
they have little to gain in playing a
club team that likely will beatthem.

Regardless of the schedule, the
team stands to be wildly success- }
ful again next year (their last as a
club team), since it loses only two
seniors, Tuckerand Liz Bruins Slot.
“T think that we’ll be really com-
petitive with the ODAC schools,”
Brown said. “I think it’s just a
matter of them giving usachance.”

“They (Davidson students) are more conformist--intellectual conformists. They sometimes lack that
edge, they lack that intellectual curiosity, or desire to find out something new.... At Harvard, Williams

stimulating than many Davidson students...”
