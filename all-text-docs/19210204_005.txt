The Peanut Parcher goes on record as
being opposed to any distinctive attire
for the Seniors. Any person with only

J. M. Barr (getting home for Christ-
mas holidays): “Wilkinson won't be
here until tomorrow. He had to take a
‘Bug’ examination.”

Barr’s little brother:
many on him?”

Yea, Verily.

First Junior: “I'm just naturally
busted! I’ve been living on faith for
the last month.”

Second Junior: “I’m worse off than
that. Nothing but hope has kept me
going.” ‘

Fresh: “Huh! I’ve got you all skin-
ned. I haven’t worried at all, and I'm
still living high on charity.” ‘

He's a Bird!

Henry Patterson tells the English V
class that he intends to write his short
story about civil war times. “A young
Confederate officer,” said Henry, “is to

Chas. Tuller to Bascom Sorrells:
“When you play that trombone you look

Two noble representatives of the Soph
