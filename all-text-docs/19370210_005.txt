HEAR DEPUTATIONS
SUNDAY AFTERNOON

The “Y”.sent two deputations last
Sunday, one to the Queens-Chicora
Evening League meeting and the
other to two boys groups at the
Charlotte Y. M. C. A.

On the vesper program at the
Girls’ school, Bill Brown, Bob King
and E. M. Yow spoke on “Reasons
for Praying,” and Yow sang ac-
companied by Rob Roy Purdy. The
girls showed their appreciation of
the program by plying the speakers
with refreshments in the Hut af-
terward.

At the Y. M. C. A. Sunday after-
noon Locke White addressed the
older group of boys on the subject
of Honor. Among illustrations of
the customs in which codes of Hon-
or-play a part he brought from his
experiences on the tennis courts the
custom of a player in a match to
throw away a point to his opponent
when the referee calls a ballSirthis
favor and is wrong.

Marcus McConnell spoke to the
younger group on standing up for
Christ against heavy odds. He illus-
trated with the story of the forty

Christian wrestlers in the Roman
army who were killed for their
faith.

WATCH POST OFC
FORAD-YEAR MARKS

All students in school this year
probably know by this time that a
new system of sending out grades
was followed at the end of the sem-
ester. In past years the individual
professors have posted the grades
in their respective courses on the
bulletin board in the lobby of
Chambers. This year, however,
after having several requests from
students to stop the professors from
posting grades, the
mittee took up the matter. It has
decided that, at the end of the first
semester, each student will be sent
an identical copy of the report sent
This makes the
sending out of grades a more pri-
vate matter and will doubtless save
many students from embarrassment.

This plan will continue to be
used until any further action by the
executive committee may change it.
The mid-semester grades for the
second semester this year, will as
usual be put on the book in the
Registrar's office, where students
may secure them. At the end of

‘NEW INFIRMARY PLANNED FOR DAVIDSON

by the trustees as a part of the centennial program of expansion of college facilities.

The need for an adequate infirmary is listed by Dr. Lingle and those in charge of raising funds as the first building that should be
constructed. The present infirmary is very inadequate, and in case of an emergency would be totally insufficient, The proposed building
would be designed to take care of the ordinary amount of sickness, and any rieeded expansion.

The Davidson Alpha Chapter al-
ways has been one of the very
strongest chapters of the fraternity.
It has always been active and co-
operative. | Since the beginning in
1921 until the present day the Dav-
idson Chapter has stuck to its orig-
inal aim which was placed in the
constitution, “The objects of the
fraternity shall be to serve as a
means of awarding distinction to
those of high scholarship in physics,
to promote interest in the advanced
study of the subject, to stimulate
and to encourage a spirit of co-
operation and friendship among
those who have displayed marked
ability in this study.”
