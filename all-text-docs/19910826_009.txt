The Importance
of Davidson's Past

By Marc Overcash

Have you ever, whether by
purpose orchance, wandered about
the second floor of Little Library?
There, towards the side that faces
Duke dwell the cloistered carrels

of professors, a big green sign -

warding off potential trespassers
[thou shalt not study heré!], the
office of the Archivist, and pic-
tures--pictures that echo back the
past.

No, these cryogenic gazes do
not implore you to seize the day,
but rather to remember the past.
We come here in hope, among
other things, to earn a degree that
bears the name Davidson College.
However, so few of us know the
past traditions that make this name
so valuable that we spend over
sixty thousand of our dollars and
four years of our lives. So few of

us, besides those in the chorus,
know the present Alma Mater song
or even the original. Do we not
care? Is Davidson just a means to
an end, not the community of fel-
lowship we say it to be?
Sorry, I was not trying to write
a David Thompson opinion, but
rather an introduction, or perhapsa
justification, to a series of articles
I plan to write. I realize that these
stories will not yoke the present to
the past, nor will they serve to stir
our sense of tradition. After all,
these are just words. But for those
who choose to read, I offer these
stories, notas a lesson in Davidson
lore, but as a piece of history that
we all share.
I offer writing that weaves
these different strands of Davidson
together instead of stretching them

apart.
