The Davidsoniart

Students Mobilize For Cam paigning

By BRUCE MALOY
Staff Writer

The Davidson College campus
is displaying a wide spectrum
of political campaigns this
spring. There are representa-
tives of mational, state and local
candidates amecng the student
body.

The general drift of the cam-
paigns is to acquaint the stu-
dents with the candidates’
names and to hold off on the
issues and platform until after
the primaries and conventions.

Students are participating in
presidential campaigns for Dem-
ocrats McGovern and Sanford
and Jenness of the Socialist
Workers Party.

Erwin Barron. student coordi-
nator for McGovern. described
his efforts as. ‘‘an attempt to
contact interested students and
to get them to work in the Mc-
Govern office in Charlotte.”

The supporters of Terry San-
ford have rented an office in
the College Union from which
one of the mos: actiie cam-
paigns on campus is being run.

District coordinator of the
youth organization for Sanford.
Danny Clodfelter stated. “Our
goals are to canvass voters. set
up vouth organizations in col-
leges anc high schools, and to
Spread Mr. Sanford's name.”

The only Presidential candi-
date to have spoken at David-
son thus far in the campaign is
Linda Jenness of the Socialist
Workers Party.

According to Steve Cross of
the Young Socialist Alliance.
Miss Jenness addressed a group
of about fifty or sixty students
when she came to Davidson in
November.

Cross went on to outline the
activities which he has been
carrying on in her behalf.
“We've had meetings with
building and grounds employees.
secretaries and administrative
personnel. and cafeteria em-
ployees in order to encourage
them to register to vote and to
present the SWP platform.”

The two factions of the Young
Republicans on campus are
planning intensive activities
once the primaries and _ con-
ventions are over.

Dan Thorne. president of the
Davidson College Young Re-
publicans, stated, “We will
probably support the candidates

Its
the real
thing

that win the nominations. I don’t
feel that we should endorse any
candidate now.”

Another group of Republicans
on campus is led by George
Kaneklides. Kaneklides, as well
as being the president of the
Davidson College Young Repu-
blicans Club, is the Vice Chair-
man of the N.C. Federation of
College Republicans and Plat-
form Committee Chairman.

In state elections of particular
interest to some students, Nick
Galifanakis is opposing B.
Everett Jordan for U.S. Senate.

Galifanakis. who spoke at
Davidson about a month ago. is

McKinnon echoed the words
of many other campus cam-
paigners referring to their own
candidate when he said, ‘‘The
majority of the pcople I’ve
talked to have said they are
going to vote for him, but there
doesn’t seem to be a lot of in-
terest in working.”

Jordan’s campaign representa-
tive for Davidson is Bill Alex-
ander.

“This is not as developed a
campaign as Sanford's, but 1
hope to get the support of as
many students for Jordan as
