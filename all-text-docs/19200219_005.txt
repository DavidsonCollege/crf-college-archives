Statesville, N. C. It was the first time since he joined

the R. O. T.C., that he would admit
that he was really terrified. He
thought of his friends: of the boys
with whom he had lived: but for
their sakes he would not do it: he
called to mind the girls—that one
girl; but for her sake he would not
do it: he thought of the faculty, ah,
for their sake he WOULD do it. So
he piled out of bed and went to
chapel last Monday morning.

There may be other girls in the

If I flunk philosophy because I

Lots of folks send valentines
To almost any one
But if you ain’t my valentine
I don’t want none.

Thompson and Alabama Long had
been discussing Junior chemistry.
Long was reading a paragraph
which, to say the least, was exprest
(S.8.) in very technical terms. When
he concluded Fresh Whiteside in-
quired :

“say fellows, is that Latin?”

Fresh Redding, gazing in fire:
“Just think its 80 more weeks till
we go home.”

Hunter, '23 also: “You poor simp

“FLU” CAUSES CLOSE OF
ANOTHER BOARDING HOUSE

“Smiley” has been doing a rush-
ing business since three hoarding
houses were forced to close down
temporarily on account of flu. Mrs.
Barnes was the first to close down,
and she was followed soon by Mrs.
White and Mrs. Manning. The fel-
lows had to act quickly to find a
place to eat. Several of them went;
to other boarding houses and filled
places made vacant by boys going:
home to wait for the epidemic to
blow over. The rest of them are
eating at “Smiley’s.” As yet, no
one has suffered any hardship on
j; account of the change, but an early:
recovery of the sick ones, in the
respective boarding houses, is desir-

,ed by all.
