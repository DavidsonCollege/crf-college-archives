LAST SPRING the Drama department presented ‘The Madwoman of
Chaillot’’. When asked why he presented so many comedies he

commented,

Managing Editor

The Drama Department is presen-

ting Shakespeare's As You Like It as
the Fall major production. The play
opens October 20, will run through
‘the 22nd and’will be presented as a

matinee October 27.

Professor of Drama Rupert T. Bar-
ber Jr. is directing the play, while
Professor of Drama Joseph Gardner
is designing the set.

In the cast of 23, Jake Darby will
play the part of Rosalind, and Chuck
Still will be Orlanda. Paul Schleiffer
has been cast as Touchstone, and
Andrea Murphy as Celia. Brad Chris-
ty will play Jacques.

‘(The set) willbe a fairly simple
setting like the Elizabethan theatres
were, although we are not doing the
set as an Elizabethan theatre,”
Barber said.

The costumes will be ‘‘Shakes-

curred, adding that the
gram, because of its inter-
iplinary nature, functions

more effectively within the
Center for Special Studies
than it would as a more
structured major department.

Program participants will
benefit from a broad selection
of courses presented in a
flexible format. The Center
will offer speciatseminars, and
the Drama Department has
used a portion of the pro-
gram's funds to create a new
two-term course in theatre
history.

In addition, students can
study various aspects of play
production independently or in
labs. Drama-related courses
from the various language
departments will be offered as
electives, with the writing of a
senior thesis concluding the
program.

The staff members’ enthu-
siasm for the Dramatic Litera-
ture and, Theatre program is
shared by the student partici-
pants. Five seniors and one

junior are currently enrolled,
making it one of the larger
programs: offered by the Cen-
ter.

Brad Christie, a junior, is
especially pleased that he can
pursue.as an academic field-his
interest in writing plays. Ellen
Schlaefer's program will em-
dramatic literature,
but she will also experiment

with play directing.

Paul Schliefer wants to
touch on as mah¥ facets of the
theatre production as possible,
though he, too, is interested in
drama as literature. All three
said they were considering
postgraduate training in dra-
ma and theatre.’

What does the future hold
for Davidson's newest pro-
gram? ‘It’s set up on a
three-year pilot basis,'’ Avin-
ger said. ‘The programe cane cue

not Elizabethan according to him.

Students are involved in the pro-
duction in many more ways than
acting, running everything from
lights to makeup.

‘We believe in the productions
being as much student oriented as

Gardner and Barber split these
students into different committees
headed by upperclassmen experienced
in that area. Page Miller will be
heading the lighting committee, Ran-
dy Sherrill will be responsible for
sound and Paul Schlieffer is directing
the make-up.

“The chairmen of these committees
meet every Monday afternoon with
Mr: Gardner and me,’’ he said, to
straighten out any problems and
coordinate all the committees’ activi-
ties,

Barber feels that working back-
stage gives students a feel for drama
they could not get otherwise, and
admits ‘‘most.of the people we work
with are not going to consider and
should not consider working with

theatre.”

Students have complained the Dra-
ma Department has not produced
any tragedies. Barber explained: ‘'!
place serious plays differently than
tragedy. We have done serious plays.
The student /actor can handle the
audience better in a less than tragic
play.

“And the etudent.loarns-as much or

audience.”

Barber also feels the parts in
tragedies are not as demanding on the
actor as those in comedies.

“T do not think in terms of tragedy
versus comedy,’’ he said, “‘but. what
will stretch the actor.”

Davidson presents only two major
productions a year, but Barber hopes
to produce three as soon as possible.

“Ideally we would be doing three
major productions a year. We have
found we simply do not have space for
three and the student productions
which Mr. Gardner and I feel are
important. As soon as we feel space is
feasible we will be moving back to
three major productions yearly,’’ he
said.

The student productions, or work-
shops, are produced during winter
terms, with students responsible fora
parts of production including direc-
tion. Barber expects as many as eight
workshops this winter, severely limi-
ting practice space both in Hodson
and across campus.

Barber is very satisfied with the
number of students who participate in
the Drama program at Davidson.
Last year, 18 per cent of the student
body participated in some facet of
drama, while the national average is
only two per cent.

He is also pleased with the women's
rise in interest, and says he is getting
about the same number of women as
men at tryouts, making competition
for female roles much tougher than in
previous years.

Barber faces a problem with the
increased women’s interest in the
drama. nracram because most.playvs
have many more male roles than
female.
