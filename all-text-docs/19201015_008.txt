BUSINESS MANAGER RECEIVES
PLEASANT SHOCK

(Continued from page 1)
amazement when on the next train
came a letter asking for $112.00
worth of advertising space—that’s
what I call “pep.”

Mr. Wingo is not a college man
but is a progressive business man
who is interested in young men and
their doings—especially the college
man. Long years ago he lived in
Davidson. When a boy, he was
popularly known here as Stuart
Wingo. Later he went to Charlotte
and was affiliated with the Wed-
dington Hardware Co. For a num-
her of years he has been in Spartan-
burg as a wholesale dealer of auto
and hardware supplies. He is taking
ten inches advertising space each
week in the Davidsonian, which is a
big spark in “The Livest Wire on
the Hill.”

The Davidsonian appreciates such
loyal support and wishes to call to
the attention of all Davidson men
the services of an uninterested busi-
ness man—uninterested as an alum-
ni, but a deeply interested business
man in the dévelopment of the
young man of today.
