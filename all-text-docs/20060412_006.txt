Do you know where your bling bling has been?

By PAIGE TAYLOR
Staff Writer

Artists rap about it. MTV and BET feature
it daily. You can find it on,the streets, in
record stores and at concerts. Welcome to the
world of bling.

Behind all the glamour and shine of the
bling phenomenon, however, is a dark side.
Many students got a chance to see this sinis-
ter underbelly in the documentary film
“Bling Bling: Consequences and
Repercussions,” which was screened this
past Monday night in the 900 room.

Davidson’s International Association and
Davidson’s African Students Association
sponsored the showing of the film, which
focuses on the mining of “conflict dia-
monds.”

According to Kareem Eduoard, the film’s
director and producer, conflict diamonds
“originate from areas controlled by forces or
factions opposed to legitimate and interna-
tionally recognized governments, and are
used to fund military action in opposition to
those governments.”

The film covers the coasts of America and
Africa, portraying the convoluted industry
that intentionally connects costly jewelry
with terrorism. It also spotlights the blatant
misunderstandings and tragic ignorance of
that link.

In making his documentary, Eduoard
focused specifically on the territorial, terrify-
ing conflict in the African nation of Sierra
Leone, where the Revolutionary United
Front, a coup army that started in 1991 as a
group of 100 militants, cut off peoples’ arms
and destroyed everything in their paths in

order to take over the impoverished coun-
try’s diamond trade. Under “Operation No
Living Thing,” the RUF rebels slaughtered
6,000 people in the capital city of Freetown
in just two days.

The diamond company De Beers, which
currently controls 70 to,
80 percent of the world’s ~
diamond market, gained
full access to Sierra
Leone’s diamond
share in the early
1900s. At that time,
the African nation was still
an English colony. Sierra
Leone was, and remains today,
the most productive diamond
mining territory on the globe.

In 1961, the country gained
independence, but the dia-
mond trade did not dwin-
dle. Instead, it
increased in
unchecked
“crippling,” as
film’s narrator and rap
legend Chuck D.
described, “the
already
economy.”

means is up to the viewer. Eduoard puts forth
a crystal clear opinion on how Americans
should react toward such corruption and the
mishandling of a country’s resources, refer-
ring more to the terrible consequences faced
by a nation’s people rather than the mining
of shiny material objects. res

In the film, well-dressed Americans smile
in embarrassment upon real-
izing that they have no idea
what a conflict diamond is
or where the country of
Sierra Leone is located.

crosses the océan to look more closely at
Sierra Leone,’ where he captures horrific
images of the devastation brought about in
part by America’s diamond obsession.

He depicts the gravity of the conflict in
scenes of men heaving tears over the bloody
corpses of their daughters and wives, of a
twelve-year old boy with a bloody, bandaged
stump for an arm, of teenage soldiers pop-
ping bullets into the kneeling bodies of civil-
ians.

One scene shows soldiers standing over a
prostrated body, shooting until the convuls-
ing, bullet-ridden frame finally rolls into a
bush.

As Miami jeweler Marvin Newman said,
“unfortunately, it comes down to greed.”
Eduaord seems intent on showing this asa
common thread between rappers and mem-
bers of the RUF, who have their respective
domains by the neck and the diamond indus-
try on a leash.

Jewelers may not know where their dia-
monds come from, since bling changes
hands fast enough to avoid leaving a visible
trace.

Even Newman knows that some of his
own diamond sales probably came through
Sierra Leone’s “great market.”

With at least forty-eight thousand carats of
conflict diamonds shipped from the nation
per year, this seems like a reasonable
assumption.

On the airwaves and on campus: Spotlight on WALT

By ALI KARAMI RUIZ

Are you “feeling sinister”? Looking for a
little “night music” or just the “flavor of the
week”? Whether you want to hear some
“subversive verses” or a little “pillow talk,”
WALT, Davidson’s student-run radio station,
has you covered.

The station’s weekly schedule is packed
with 50 hour-long shows, hosted by a total of
66 different djs. With broadcasts like Steve
Gaultney’s ‘07 “Radio Theater: Art On Air,”
Will Bryan’s ’08 and Blake Poole’s ’08
“Davidson Sports Network” and Robbie
Squibb’s ’09 “I Should Have Been A
Cowboy,” students should have no trouble
finding something to suit their interests.

WALT’s offers a successful mobile DJ service.

Catching a favorite show is now even eas-
ier since WALT picked up the capability to
podcast last semester.

“We had been interested in expanding our
broadcasts beyond the AM radio waves for a
while. While intranet [the Davidson network
only] streaming was fairly easy to accom-
plish last year, internet. streaming would
have required somewhere around $3,000
worth of new equipment,” said WALT’s sta-
tion manager Taylor Ansley ’07.

Enter podcasting. “Alex Wales ’08
deserves most of the credit for podcasting —
he took it from an idea we tossed around at
Executive Board meetings to a reality within
just a few weeks at the beginning of the last
semester,” said Ansley.

Podcasting, available on WALT’s website,

works very simply. Listeners pick a show
from the website, click on the “Pod” link and
follow a couple of instructions, which allows
them to automatically receive a broadcast
each time it is published.

“Last semester we got the podcast up and
running smoothly at the beginning of
October. Between then and the end of last
semester, we served almost 2,500 hours to an
estimated 4,500 unique listeners,” said Wales
08.

Shows are now available at the listener’s
convenience, which many Davidson students
are likely to appreciate given their full
schedules.

Podcasting also allows students to expand
their musical horizons, since they can sample
broadcasts of shows that feature innovative
bands and genres often underappreciated by
the mainstream media.

“I no longer have to listen to my repetitive
iTunes library. All the miscellaneous music
that I’ve found on the WALT website keeps
me from getting bored,” said Jay McNair
09.

WALT does more than just broadcast
music, however. The station’s executive
board has been working particularly hard
this year to sponsor a variety of events.

“We’ve worked at raising our profile on
campus through events like Battle of the
Bands” said Wales ’08. ;

“This third annual WALT Battle of the
Bands represented the best group of artists
we've seen. Battle of the Bands has grown
into a consistently well-attended event and
we've seen fhe quality of performances go
through the roof in three short years,” said
Ansley.

“This year included great performances by

crew—The Snacks, and Tom Foolery and the _

Shenanigans. I was really pleased to see a .
full-house crowd and to see that the majority
stayed through the entire event,” he added.

WALT has also started a few traditions in
the past few years that Ansley claimed he
and the other board members would like to
continue.

The Freestyle Rap Battle, which takes
place during fall semester, is one such event.
The board also plans to produce another
