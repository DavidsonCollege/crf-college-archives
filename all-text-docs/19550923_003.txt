Gone are the days when the students of Davidson ven-
tured forth to an athletic event, knowing that it would produce
another in a long line of defeats. Our material for this year and
for one or two more seasons at least is capable of a fine record |
in all sports. The difference between mediocrity and an out-|
standing year lies with the members of the Davidson family
and their attitude. Smith Barrier, sports editor of the Greens- |
boro Daily News, has expressed this so well that I wish to re-|
print his article of September 16 in part:

“It was 4 p.m. on my favorite Presbyterian campus, and
a couple hundred red-capped freshmen ‘lined up for Pete
Whitile’s annual cake race. On hand were Tom Scott, the new
athletic director, an old friend, and Dr. Frontis Johnston, the
faculty chairman of athletics, along with his two charming
daughters.

“It was a display of the real Davidson spirit you've read
about, back from the days of the “thin red line” and the Thad
Brock era and the Teeny Lafferty regime and all that.

“] don’t know who won the cake race, an annual stunt
over a couple cross country miles for which local housewives
baked 45 cakes today. There were only 44 prizes so they had to
split the 45th cake a thousand ways.

“When Coach Bill Dole’s football Wildcats take the field
at nearby Charlotte Memorial Stadium tomorrow night against
Catawba (kickoff time 8 p.m.) that same spirit must prevail to
launch a Davidson season that could become the finest in
school history. It doesn’t depend, if I may insert a personal
note, on the football squad and coaching staff as a working
unit. It depends on the student body . . .

“But Davidson, doing an excellent job on its present level,
backs up from nobody when it comes to fielding a representa-
tive football team. It never has, even in the years when it,
possibly foolishly, played the David role against the weekly
Goliaths.

« It could be, mind you, could be the best year in
Davidson history. I guess that old Davidson spirit, from the
top faculty office on down to the lowest red cap, will make
the difference.”

DICK BELTON

Belton Is

Named

Wildcat of Week

By JOHN

For his brilliant performance in
the- Catawba game, quarterback
Dick Belton has earned the title of
Wildeat of the Week. The bullet
passes of the 160-pound junior
consistently hit their mark with
near-perfection accuracy, he
completed six out of seven tosses
for a total of 132 yards, the highest
individual Cat yardage in several
years. His 53-yard completion to
halfback Don Comer was David-
son's longest pass since the 1953
Harvard game.

Belton, a Kappa Sig, comes from
Mount Airy, N. C., where he made
All-Conference playing end and
tailback. When he arrived at David-
son, Dick was unfamiliar with the
quarterback job; but, after his
smart playing last Friday, there is
little doubt that he has mastered
the position. Although he has been
an under-study of Dyke Little for
the past two years, he started in the
Catawba game. Strangely enough,
Dick has yet to throw for a Wild-

just one game gone.

Cat,” Charlotte reporter

said,

Airy did some pitching that would
make Stengel back-
flips.” Grady also lauded Dick's
calmness on the playing field.

The Davidsonian office received
word that the 1955 Jayvee team
opened its home season with a
26 to 6 vicory over the App. Jay-
cees Thursday afternoon at Rich
ardson Stadium.

Coaches Jim Fasul and Ollie Har- |
ris have done a fine job in pre- |
paring the club, mostly freshman
prospects, for this affair. Despite |
the drawback of being in the midst |
of rush week, the Kittens did a |
fine job.

Next week's edition will carry a |

complete report on the game. Re- |
ports indicate that several new |
men were outstanding.
