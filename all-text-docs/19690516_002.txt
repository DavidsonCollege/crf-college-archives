Rewards Of Time

The overused and overrated cliche
of the “credibility gap” this week
received three big pushes out of the
conversation of Davidson students
and facuity. largely due to the efforts
of three different individuals or
groups.

That “gap.” created bv persons
charging inefficiency and lack of ac-
tion on both sides of the academic
fence, has now been at least partially
destroyed.

Step number one in the gap des-
truction was taken by- the Committee
on Admissions and Financial Aid.
when it finalized its report on cars
and scholarships with a very liberal
and acceptable proposal.

Although the report as presented
is a bit complicated. perhaps necessi-
tating a new position of Dean of Cars
to iron out all the details, it is still
most ‘satisfactory, and certainly it is
better than anyone would have expect-
ed several weeks before.

The time needed for the committee
was greater than anticipated, but the
final report made the extra time worth
enduring.

The second bridge this week was
built by junior Dave Sweatt, in the
creation of his Symposium on Environ-
mental Problems.

Sweatt accomplished with a mere
$20 dollars one of the best programs

the school has witnessed in recent
years. and he did it by tapping the
wealth and resources of the college,
the faculty members themselves.

The results of Sweatt’s efforts to
organize the symposium were seen in
the sizeable crowds in attendance. in
the dialogne between disagreeing pro-
fessors and in the open exchange of
ideas on the pollution vroblem bv
evervone present during the three-day
session.

The final step in aiding the credi-
bility of students and faciiltv was ta-
ken this week bv the IFC Judicial
Board. when it issued its statement
on hazing.

_Jn ‘ruth, the board was working
on some violations prior to the Stu-
dent Life Committee’s resolution..on
fraternity hazing several weeks ago.
But this week's report represents the
result of a full week of hearings and
investigations into alleged Greek
Week activities. and shows a willing-
ness to cooperate on the boar.i’s part,

The final statement may not be ac-
ceptable to all parties involved, but
it has brightened the IFC’s complexion
as far as number of faculty members
are concerned.

In all three cases the rewards of a
long, tedious period of study and prep-
aration have been realized to a large
degree, and the efforts deserve con-
siderable applause.

Better Late Than Never?

The campus delivery system is get-
ting so unreliable that one is scared
to use it anymore.

Letters from the president's office
have arrived as much as a week after
deposit in the system. A letter from
the dean of faculty notifying students
of a meeting this week arrived after
the meeting.

Such service is inexcusable. If a
mail system is worth having, it should
be reliable.

But on the other hand, the system
is itself a good idea. For that reason,

we would like to suggest twice-daily
pickups and deliveries to all dorms
and campus buildings. Also, when
the dorms are remodeled this sum-
mer, one addition could be pigeon
holes on each hall for delivery of
campus mail and notes, which now
get left on the floor by the door,
where a janitor may sweep them into
the trash or where the wind may
blow them away.

The system is a good idea and
needs extension. But until it is reli-
able, it is worthless.

Home Rule

In the process of discussing possible
changes at Davidson, two ideas have
come up concerning college govern-
ment which we think deserve serious
consideration if not outright adop-
tion. One is a revised composition
for the Board of Trustees, the other
a suggestion for a college council.

The board presently consists of 37
churchmen elected by the presbyter-
jes of North Carolina and Florida and

14 alumni chosen by the Alumni As- |

sociation.

It would seem more logical for the
governing body of an educational in-
Stitution to consist also of educators
and of recent graduates who have
more of a feel for the institution. in
addition to the alumni and church-
men who now make up the board.

Furthermore the churchmen should
be chosen by synods rather than pres.
byteries, and by synods of both the
Southern Presbyterians and United
Presbyterians, to add diversity and
ecumenicity. (For a definite illustra-
tion, see box.)

The college council is also needed to
make the governing of the day-to-day
affairs more representative of the
community and to assure a voice for
all parts of the college. ;

Accordingly, it should consist of
students, faculty, administrators and
trustees. Students should be chosen
bv residence halls, since this has prov-
ed during the past year to be the
most direct and meaningful mode of
representation on the student Senate.

Faculty members should be elected
both by divisions and at large, so that
all segments of the faculty would re-
ceive representation. And for liaison
with the trustees, several trustees
should be on the council. (See box.)

In authority, the college council
would govern the college subject only
to the trustees, with perhaps one or
two areas reserved for the faculty
or students.

The college council would carry
with it several inyportant advantages.
First, it would centralize authority.
One would know where to go. to get
action and who had authority to act.
Untold hours are now wasted in an
administrative run-around that is in-
excusable. It is far too difficult to
obtain change and reform. Students
and faculty are here for education,

. not for committee meetings. There-
fore, the administrative decisions
should be easy to obtain, and reform
not unduly hard to effect, so that at-
tention stays where it should, on ed-
ucation.

Another advantage would be the
permanent opening of channels.
Thanks to the national situation on
college campuses, and an unusual
chain of events beginning with the
Self-Study Reports and student‘efforts,

PRESENT:

1) 33 trustees, elected by presby-
teries of North Carolina:

from dorms, one from off-cam-

2) 4 administrators (two deans.

4 at large):

4) 5 trustees, at least one from each
division: and

5) President of the college, chair-
man.

this institution is now less rigid
than most, and somewhat open to
change.

So, before things return to a situa-
tion where it is necessary to have
another mass movement every time
one wants to make a small change,
the structure should be opened so
that change can flow easily through
channels. A college council of the
nature outlined would have such an
effect.

Finally, the college council con-
cept would formalize what students
have been told about Davidson for
years: that it is one communitv with
& common goal and interest. If this
is so, it should have a common govern-
ment and a common legislature, re-
sponsive and responsible to the en-
tire community.

It is time for the structure to
change so that reform may continue.
If the college ceases to change, if
the structure is unresponsive to the
times and to the community, Davidson
will either explode with the pent-up
emotion of a Columbia or stagnate
like trapped water. The old fas serv-
ed its time. Davidson is ready for
the new. :

Cary Hits ‘Discriminatory’

Subsidization Of Athletics

To the Editor:

At the risk of being exiled
to the basement of Lingle
Manor for the rest of my col-
lege career, I would like to
register a strong protest
against subsidized athletics
as. presently practiced on the
Davidson campus.

There are two major rea-
sons why the present pro-
gram of scholarships in re-
lation to subsidized athletics
should be revised.

1. It is blantantly discrim-
inatory.

2. It is not the proper use
of the money involved.

First let me ‘deal with the
problem of discrimination. At
Davidson a student who is
a superior athlete in foot-
ball and/or basketball can
get a considerable financial
scholarship based on merit,
while students who show su-
perior performance in other
areas, ‘such as music (on
this subject I obviously am
biased) cannot get- such a
scholarship based on merit.

This latter group must rely
on the ‘need’ provision
(which includes honorary
scholarships) irrespective of
merit.

The discrimination is ob-
vious. The college is in fact
making a value judgment
here and saying that the
superior athlete is more
worthy than the musician or
the superior actor or the
superior scholar.

Defense of the present sys
tem because of this rute and
that from a higher committce
does not eliminate this es-
sential judgement. Is_ this
distinction valid? I think nof.

Davidson should do one of
two things:

1. Extend merit scholar-
ships to all areas of campus
life, with specifications oun
the number and stipend that
may be given in each area.

2. Do away with the idea
of scholarship on merit en-
tirely, and base all scholar-
ships on need alone. *

I tend to favor the latter
alternative because of the
second reason for interven-
tion—improper use of the
money. I believe THE
DAVIDSONIAN gave a figure
of somewhere in the neigh-
borhood of $200,000 as the
cost of subsidized athletics.
Consider what even a small
portion of this money could
do for the ‘‘other side of the
tracks" here.

What could it do for an
African, an Asian, or a Black
Studies program? Many other
uses come to mind immedi-
ately.

Remember, gentle-
men, that this is an educa-
tional insti:ution. While ath-

is a farce. It needs correc-

now.

Admissions Advice

To the Editor:

Last April after I received
notice that my application
for admission to Davidson
College had been granted, I
and the other prospective
freshmen admitted on March
15 were invited to spend
the first weekend in Apirl
on campus.

This weekend was design-
ed to further acquaint us
with the school, the people
here, and what it has to of-
fer, thereby affording us
more information with which
to make a very important de-
cision.

The weekend was very well
organized through the ef-
forts of Mr. Regen. Reserva-
tions in the Guest House and
transportation to and from
the campus were handled by
the Admissions Office.

The Richardson Fellows
acted as student guides, each
assigned to a few specific
visitors.

A very good program of
tours had been set up so the
student could see as much
of the school as he wanted.
The tours were very infor-
mal, strickly pick and choose
the ones that: interested you.

Otherwise the student was
more-or-less on his own. If
he needed help or informa-
tion he had the names of sev-
eral people whom he could
ask.

So far this spring there has
been no such program. Per-

haps this could be reinstitut-
ed next spring for prospec:
tive freshmen.

The bulk of the admissions
are sent out by March 15, a
month before the Ivy League.

With a month to think
about it and an_ excellent
chance to see the school,
more of the undecided
seniors might decide that
Davidson is the place for
them.

A Dull Scene

To the Editor:

Far be it from us to de-
fend THE DAVIDSONIAN:
however, there is a point
which has solicited much con-
cern from THE DAVID-
SONIAN's far and near read-
ers.

These wonderful perceptive
readers have come. to the
realization that THE DAVID-
SONIAN seldom contains fac-
tual reports and furthermore
is a biased “‘crusading op-
inion.”’

“Why doesn't, THE DAVID-
SONIAN inform us _ about
What's Shaking on Campus?"
inquire the dear interested
readers.

Since we're here as stu-
dents. the question is near
and dear to our hearts. And
from our observations we
have come to the realization
of which we are going to
make a factual report.

There is absolutely no-
thing ‘shaking’ on the
Davidson campus. THE
DAVIDSONIAN  has__ been
forced to pour out thrashings
and rehashings of the same
old issues week after week
to fill up the paper.

This is.the only alternative
left to THE DAVIDSONIAN
staff because if THE DAVID-
SONIAN were limited to fac-
tual reporting, the only edi-
tion would come out at gradu-
ation.

Tucker Defends

To The Editor:

If I've interpreted Mrs.
Wallace’s response to Brown,
Parks et al. correctly, she
seems to say that the black
situation in Davidson (read
America) is just one facet
of the human condition.

In this, I think, there is
more than a grain of truth,
but her claim becomes a
patent denial of the blacks’
awareness of their singular
position within American
(read Davidson) society.

Be this a result of a failure
to understand or an unwil-
lingness to listen, 1 couldnt
say; as a white student, I
can only contend that both
rationally and viscerally I
share somewhat the black
students’ bitterness.

- I doubt that Brown, Parks,
and Williams think their
blackness a sanctuary.

America has for 360. years
revered white, reviled black,
and I hardly think that
Davidson's black contingent
need apologize for escaping
the fulsome white syndrome.

If there. is anything at all
common to the philosophies

of Ellison, Baldwin, Fanon,
Jones, or Cleaver, it is their
disavowal of the effete
whiteness of the social sy-
stem.

Nor is there anything fic-
tional about the blacks’
enemies, be they persons or
institutions. There is certain-
ly nothing illusory or ‘‘creat-
ed” about the insidious rac.
ism (attitude as well as be-
havioral) which pervades this
campus.

In this regard, I find Les
Brown's favorite word to be
particularly appropriate.

The Politics Of Illusion

In the realm of politics we can distinguish be-
tween symbolic acts and gains and those acts which
represerit actual gains. Both are legitimate. In com-
bination they lead eventually to solutions of problems. .

There is another form of political activity, how-

. ever, of which concerned citizens should be aware.

At the risk of sounding like all the other “The Poli-
tics of . .. .” inventors, it seems justifiable to call
this form “the politics of illusion.”

This form prevails when all evidence, al) stfate-
ments, all reporting in the press, leads us to con-
clude incorrectly that, in fact, actual and symbolic
progress has been made in a certain area.

The success of this tactic is often guaranteed
by the skillfulness of public men who have become
expert illusionists and by the desire of citizens te ,
think that things are really being done. —

Liberal-minded individuals are especially suscep-
tible to such illusions in the area of poverty and hun-
ger. The point here is not that these concerns are
false. or corrupt, or serving only to gratify the in-
dividual’s personal psyche.

The point is that honest concerns are played
upon and sometimes later traded upon with mere
illusion. .

1 think that one such great illusion was foisted on
many concerned individuals of the nation recently and
serves well here to illustrate the politics of illusion,

The case is that of Senator Ernest F. Hollings’
(D-S.C.) expose-type treatment of poverty and hunger
in Beaufort and Jasper counties.

The two counties on South Carolina’s southern
tip certainly do have severe problems of poverty and
hunger. But there, as elsewhere, the politics of illu-
sion has failed to get to the heart of the problems.

Hollings’ “investigation” trip, the “hearing” and,
finally, the action taken appear now to have been more
illusory than real:

The trip to investigate the problems appears now
to have been a press pleaser but little else. Only cer-
tain people were contacted and others conspicuously
forgotten. Dr. H. Parker Jones, county health officer,
director of all public health programs there, was never
even questioned.

Public health nurses filling a much understaffed
need for nurses in the field were not asked what
they could contribute to the study. The Dr. Gatch
whose remarks were given great weight in the press
isa re of questionable motivation.

The hearings could have been a real chance to
develop new Prespectives on the basis of which bet-
ter programs could be designed. Instead, the burea-
cratic set-up (often failing here as well as elsewhere,
even when staffed by conscientious people, because
of confused authority and bureaucratic bottlenecks)
was left largely uninvestigated. Poverty level people
were brought to testify.

Some who went before national television cam-
eras were able to bend the truth to fit the needs for
sensational press — cases like that of the woman who
claimed she had never been visited by health. depart-
ment workers when their records later sho:.a1 that
she had been visited five times.

The action taken gave the illusion of « :-. solu-
tion, of “cutting the red tape”, of ‘doing ssraething
right now.”

But behind the scenes it was a different matter:
the food for the food supplement was on the train
bound for Beaufort before the local officials in Beau-
fort were told they were to administer it, or who was
to administer it, or how it was to be administered —
the people in Washington forgetting at this stage, as
well as in the first two, that somebody somewhere
has to try to make such high-sounding ideas and
rhetoric actually work.

Somehow the great leaders forgot too that the
food had to be stored somewhere. They forgot that
many of those who would receive the food wouldn't
know how to prepare it — it includes dried choco-
late milk and scrambled egg mix.

They also forgot to say how a mother with three
children could lug home, possibly miles away from the
distribution center, the 140 pounds of food to which
she is entitled under the plan.

It appears that the investigation tour was in-
vestigative in only the most illusional way, that the
presentation of the hearing as an attempt to get real
answers was an illusion, and that the implied value
of the remedial action was illusional.

_ There may be certain realms within which the
nation can tolerate illusion. This is not one of them.
Hunger, starvation, disedse and pain are not
illusions. Do we think we can correct them with illu-
sions?

Black Students

ferred to:

_ You state: “The Admis-
sions Office had made no
arrangements for the hous-
ing of these prospective stu-
dents. . ."’ Fact: At our re-
quest, Cecil Burney had de-
finitely made arrangements
for the prospective freshmen.

In one case that I know
about, the room was locked
late Friday afternoon when
the student arrived, and I
had to make alternate ar-
rangements. Students on the
hall made the first gesture
to help and I responded ac-
cordingly.

You state: “A third pros-
pective freshman was given
the impression that the Ad-
missions Office would find
him a ride to the arport
Saturday."

Although normally the Ad-
missions Office cannot pro-
vide rides for prospective
freshmen to or from Char-
lotte. I did go to the Char-
lotte airport during my lunch
hour on Friday to meet the
student and bring him to
Davidson. I told him I had
not been able to find him a

ride back to Charlotte for
his Saturday afternoon fight.

I suggested that he ride
the bus, and he indicated
that this was satisfactory
with him.

You state: “In the mean-
time the admission officer
left, reportedly to help show
around some basketball pros-
pects." Facts: There were
no basketball propects on
campus that weekend.

You state: “The Admis-
sions Office can't understand
why less than the desired
number are making their
tuition deposits for next
year.”

Fact: We want a smaller
class, have accepted 45 less
than we had at the same time
last year, and I think it fs
understandable that the num-
ber of deposits is lower.

As a matter of information,
it should be pointed out that
that the prospective students
you mentioned have sent
their deposits for admission
in next year's freshman
class.
