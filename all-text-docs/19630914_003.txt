FOOTBALL ...

Someone said no news is good news, and if that’s
so this page probably contains the best news in the paper;
except for the flash that rush week is over. And by the
time this ‘‘no” news is read it will probably be old news
or older news.

Tonight as this paper is being delivered to the dorms,
the only real sports news of the week is being made in
Greenville, §. C. Davidson’s football team, picked by the
experts to finish ninth, eighth, seventh, or even as high
as sixth in the Southern Conference, opens their nine-
game schedule against Furman.

Being no expert, I decline the honor of making any

final finish predictions, but quite a crowd will be in
Greenville tonight. Many of us expect the experts to be
fooled, and that’s a bright new tune in a dull old song
around here—expecting something.

HORSES...

Blasco Ibanez had his Four Horsemen of the Apocaly-
pse, Grantland Rice, his four horsemen of Notre Dame,
and Furman its lone white stud and mounted Paladin;
but tonight’s game could very well be settled by some
real two-legged horses and four horsemen who ride at
every football game.

Furman, last year’s fifth place Southern Conference
entry, fashions the bulk of its attack around the Southern
Conference’s two leading ground  gainers—fullback
Elliott Keller and halfback John Cook. One year ago it
was the rushes of Keller combined with the power sweeps
of Cook that wrecked Davidson. Along with these two
excellent runners, Furman boasts 5’9”’ quarterback Danny
Donovan, known as the “Irish Gambler.” Donovan, a fine
runner, is famed for his rollout pass-run option series.
These are Furman’s horses.

Davidson's attack is led by an interesting array of

hosses or perhaps baby elephants. Spearheading the run- |

ning attack will be junior halfback Pat Fisher. Teamed
up with Fisher will be senior halfback Jim Fuller and
sophomore halfback and game co-captain Pack Hindsley.

Should it become necessary, junior fullback Dave Hen- .

dricks proved he could fill in for Fisher by his perform-
ance in last Saturday’s game scrimmage. If Hendricks
(215 lbs.), Fuller (222 lbs.), and Hindsley (205 lbs.) play
together watch for the field to list. For in this “tilt back-

field” (backs bigger than the line) Hindsley will be the ee fst

runt of the litter.
Along with the three deep backs, Davidson welcomes

back senior letterman Earl Cole and senior Benny Coxton -
at quarterback. These two seniors round out Davidson’s

stable of horses.
These aren’t the only horses that will be in Green-

ville tonight. There are four other horsemen who ride for |:

every football game played anywhere. Tonight, when
Furman’s white stallion passes around the field, these
four warriors will spur their mounts and gallop through

the skies. If you look close you may see them some time’
during the evening. The first horseman is injury. He’
snaps bones and teams with the same swift stroke of his
hammer. Beside him rides old man weather. He numbs,

fingers with his frosty breath or saps the strength from

players with his fiery glare. The third rider, on closer in-)
spection, is not a horseman but a woman—dame chance.
As she smirks the football bounces—up, down, sideways,
or not at all. And finally, the lead horseman appears ||

dressed in black with his face enshrouded in mist. This
is apathy—wrecker of teams; unquestioned leader of
these four fables as they gallop to and fro seeking an op-
portunity to swoop from the skies and mix with the
mortals below. For after all is said and done it is often
these four who decide the outcome of the game.

WHO WILL WIN?

Two years ago at Furman, Ben Coxton was injured.
He has not played since. Two years ago at Furman, Jim
Fuller played his finest collegiate game, rushing for
nearly 100 yards. One year ago Furman stamped
ends to beat Davidson. One year ago Davidson’s freshmen
beat the Furman freshmen for the first time in many

ears.

. If Coxton stays well, if Fuller re
sweeps of Furman (said to look like a herd of cattle com-
ing at you) can be contained, if the sophomores remember
who they beat last year, and, oh yes, if the whole David-

son team keeps those particular four horsemen away)

from their bench, Davidson will win. 2S
That’s a long list of ifs but a good team will remove

all of these ifs. Davidson has a good team.

A RUBBER ISLAND ee
From football to baseball in less than a line is quite
a jump, but down where the football team practices is a
ditch—it used to be the Davidson infield. _
The only thing now remaining as a reminder of this
is a column of dirt topped majestically by home plate;
left strictly through oversight when the rest of the infield

was plowed up.
4 the baseball team expressed a desire to
improve baseball facilities. Since that time, led by
Rick Smyre,
Stevens and President Martin, they have set to work. —
This summer the whole infield was dug out gratis,
through the donation of labor and equipment by Mr.
Sm of Gastonia. Later, Earle and Rick Smyre
along with Alonzo hauled sand onto the field and mixed it
with the top soil. By doing this they hope to insure
against the Infield drying out and becoming as hard as
it has been in the past. é
At the nt time, the infield is awaiting the ar-
rival of a ton of cinders which will be laid under the top
soil to allow for r drainage.
After the aaa bas been delivered, the whole base-
ball team has volunteered its services to dump the
vel and fill the rest of the infield. The team then in-
at to spread the topsoil and grade the finished pro-
duct. :
The baseball field needed. improving. It will need
even more t. I think if the present willingness

Highland Games Provide
Wins For Turner And Mills

BY BOB STRAUSER
Assistant Davidsonian Sports Editor

On July 13 five members of the 1962-63 Wildcat track squad participated in the
| colorful “gathering of the clans in the valley’ at Grandfather Mountain. This eighth
annual display of Carolina heritage featured such attractions as track and field, danc-
ing, wrestling, and bagpipe competition. 5

to win his heat in the 100-vard
dash, he came back to win the
event over a strong field. Tur-
ner concluded a fine afternoon
by taking another first in the
60-yard dash and a second place
finish in the 220.

i Veteran pole vaulter Billy
“~ Mills distinguished himself with
a second place in that event. In
another area, the versatile Mills
won his division in the. highly
competitive Highland wrestling
event. Steve Gill, a member of
last year’s freshman cross coun-
try team, finished second in the
440-yard dash. Denny Phillips
and Chester Davis failed to
place in the cross country.

“Davidson Hopes To End
Famine Tonight

“This team has progressed further in two weeks of practice than any other team
I have coached at Davidson,” commented Coach Bill Dole as this year’s Davidson foot-
ball team closed fall practice last week in preparation for Furman (a team they have

The depth problem which has

| plagued Davidson teams in the

past is not so serious this year.
There are capable reserves at
every position. However, the
depth at. guard and tackle con
sists mainly of sophomores who
lack game experience

Much of Coach Dole’s confi-
dence about this year's team is
based on last Saturday's game
| scrimmage which Davidson won
27-0. The coaches were well
pleased with the team’s overall
performance. They played con-

servative football, with empha
sis on the fundamentals

A highlight of the game was
a touchdown scored by senior
tackle Dick Fulp, who recovered

a kick blocked by Pack Hindsley
in the end zone. A second touch-
down was the result of a 66 yard
pass and run play from QB
Benny Coxton to end Steve Dav-
| idson. Fullback Dave Hendricks,
back after a year’s absence from
the team, scored another on a
| short plunge. And the final
touchdown was made when half:
back Jim Fuller made a short
dive from the five yard line.
Benny Coxton, now fully re-
covered from an old shoulder
injury, did an excellent job at
quarterback, as did veteran Earl
Cole. Pack Hindsley, a sopho-

were outstanding in a line that
blocked and tackled well all day

Major surprise of early prac-
tice ‘has been the shift of Jim
Fuller to left half. Fuller, a
fullback his last two years, is
big (220), and very fast for his
size. In uniform he runs the 50
yard. dash in under 6 seconds
Coach Dole extremely pleased
with Fuller's performance at his
new position, summed up his
feelings about the shift with the

observation that, “He looked
like a run-away freight train
Saturday.”

The scrimmage victory was
marred by an injury to Lyle Bla
lock. The junior fullback is side
lined at. least until the VMI
game, October 5, with a. dis
located shoulder

must be overcome before Fur

also a problem last year when
the ‘Cats finished last in the
conference in this category with
a 30.0 average. The answer
seems to be either in Jim Full-
er or Bill Joyner both of whom
have been punting well in prac-
tice. One of them will probably
handle kicking situations ° to-

and Sam Pickens is the best in
the conference. Last year Keller
and Cook were first and second
in the conference in total rush-
ing yards with 724 and 661 yards
respectively. Cook averaged 6.6
yards a carry; Keller, 5.4.

Last year’s freshman team
was the first Davidson football

team, varsity or freshman, to
defeat Furman in the last 15
years. Two of the standouts

from that team, Pack Hindsley

Fuller and Hindsley at halfback
and Fisher at fullback. The line
consists of ends Steve Heckard

Wallis and Morris Williams, tack-
les Dick Fulp and Bill Dole, with
Britt Smith at center

Athletic Staff Adds
Three New Faces

This September saw not
only the appearance of two
hundred. and some odd new
freshman faces, but also the
arrival of three new addi-
tions to the Davidson athle-
tic staff.

The basketball coaching staff
has been expanded by the addi-
tion of Perry Holland. Holland,
from Sanford, N. C., is a grad-
uate of Campbell College where
he played basketball. He will
coach the freshman basketball!
team, replacing Coach Joe Hunt
who will become assistant var-
sity coach, a job which he prev-
iously handled in addition to
