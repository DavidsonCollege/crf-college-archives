It seems that we are developing quite a number of golf stars on our
course. At least, this would appear the case if the results of the Salis-
bury match last week mean anything. Go to it, golfers, we want to see
you win every time this spring.

Junior Speaking will be here in two weeks and this year, the juniors
are striving to make the occasion one of the most successful in the his-
tory of the institution. Let’s all be here to help put it across and
enjoy the fun, 5

A little music at the picture shows every Saturday night certainly
does add to the enjoyment of the show. As long as we had an or-
chestra then, even though composed of only a few men, everyone al-
ways looked forward to hearing them. ‘Their absence recently has been
most marked, and all have been disappointed because they were not
on hand. -Can’t some of our many musicians be prevailed upon to make
up a temporary orchestra from now on?

D
The janitors in their new outfit are a very novel sight around the
dormitories. Between keeping their white coats clean, and keeping all
the rooms clean, they should soon become very efficient workers.
D

Radio receiving sets are in evidence around the campus these days
very decidedly. Aerials, strung from top to top of the dormitories, are
bringing enjoyable concerts, it seems, to the eyes of Davidson students
from all over the country. The men who founded Davidson and placed
it in quite an isolated community, would certainly be astonished to
know that famous singers, speakers, and orchestras from all the large
cities in the United States, were being heard here.

D

Last Sunday, the Seniors instituted a practice which should lead
to better fellowship and school spirit. That is gathering together at
regular times to sing the school songs. Come out, Seniors, and take
part.

D

Why aren’t we ALL, interested in seeing that the proper men are
elected to the student offices. At the election already held only 350
men voted, out of a possible 500, when no effort beyond signing a ballot
already made out and at hand, was required. Let’s all vote next Monday.

D.

A BETTER SPIRIT

For some time in the past, we have been allowing ourselves to be
a little noisy at the moving picture shows. Usually, however, this was
not bad enough to reflect discredit upon a student body. But on last
Saturday night, the rowdy element seemed to predominate, and many
shouts and comments could be heard which should never have been
made and especially not made at a public entertainment where all the
townspeople, ladies and children included, were present.

The management has rendered excellent service for us this year,
and has secured many attractive, new pictures. We should try to co-
operate with them in every way possible, and especially should we cut
out this practice of shouting at certain parts of ihe pictures, or making
unwanted remarks, If the small boys near the front continue to cause
such disturbance, they should be put out. We don’t want to have any-
thing detract from the shows that are put on here.

CHURCH SEATS

The. new and very attractive addition to the Presbyterian Church

is p.actically completed, and soon there will be room to allow everyone

. curfortable seats, instead of the crowded ones of the past year or two.
This will fill a long felt need, and will insure an added attraction to the
‘gétvices, which cramped quarters rendered almost impossible at times.
‘Benches which have been moved close together, can now be moved
t their proper distance, and the necessary space made between them.
For some years, there has also been a movement to let seniors
id church either in the morning or evening as they wished. This
tt into practice last fall, more from necessity than otherwise.
the new part of the church finished, this necessity will be re-

Stop—Think—Act.

The time is here for us to choose

the men to lead the various activities
on the campus. You may not be sat-
isfied. with the present, officers,
whether that is true or not is of lit-
tle concern but what is important is
the question of who will we have next
year.
First of all it is of prime import-
ance that every man in the student
body should vote in these elections.
It is a poor man who hasn’t enough
interest in his school and in himself
to cast a ballot for the man that he
thinks is the best for the important
positions of leadership on the campus.
It is your duty as well as your privi-
lege to exercise your vote. Only 341
men voted in the race for Editor-in-
Chief of the Davidsonian. ‘That’s a
disgrace.

This year is somewhat’ of a crisis
in the history of student government
at Davidson. ‘The school has grown
amazingly in the last four years.
Large additions have been made to
the faculty as well as to the student
body. Many changes and innovations
have been effected. The Honor Sys-
tem and the student government have
if anything been slipping backward
and losing authority and prestige.
This ought not to be and must be al-
lowed to remain the case if Davidson
is to grow and prosper. ‘The man
that is to be the head of the student
government for next year will have
a big opportunity to getting things
going right on the campus. He has
a big job and the office calls for a
big man. Think over the men of the
Junior Class and pick out a man who
has the necessary ability to handle the
situation and one that will devote him-
self to this great work of building up
old Davidson.

Whatever you do, if you haven’t
got enough energy to sign your name
to a ballot, ask someone sitting next
to you to do it for you.

Yours for a better Davidson.

LET YOUR MOTTO BE:

God make me a man;
Give me strength to stand for
right,

When other folks have left the fight.
Give me the courage of the man
Who knows that if he wills, he can.

Help me to see in every face
The good, the kind, and not the base.
Make me sincere in word and
deed;
Blot out from me all shame and
greed; :
Help me to guard my troubled
soul
By constant, active self-control.
Clean up my thoughts, my speech,
my play
And keep me brave from day to day;
O, make me a man.—Exchange.

LAUGH
Build for yourself a strong box,
Fashion each part with care,
Fit it with harp and padlock,
Put all your trouble there.
Hide therein all your failures
And each bitter cup you quaff,
Lock all your heartaches in it, -
Then sit on the lid and laugh.

Tell no one of its. contents,
Never its secrets share;

Drop in your cares and worries,
Keep them forever there.

Hide them from sight completely,
The world will never dream half;

Fasten the top down securely.
Then-sit on the lid and laugh.

HOW IT WAS DONE

(His Version)

I had not the least intention
To do the thing I mention,
I had shaken hands and started
for the door,
But our glances seemed to mingle,
And I felt my pulse tingle
With a bliss ecstatic which I’d
never felt before,
And she surely did not chide me;
As she stood quite close beside me;
And if she whispered “No” ’twas
very low.
So, as we stood so nearly
It was just a trifle, merely,
To bend and kiss her while the
lights were dim and low.

(Her Version)

I knew, of course, I shouldn't, |
But. then, you see I couldn’t
Resist him when he put it to
| me so,
|I know he really shouldn’t,
| But, then, you see I couldn’t
Turn from him with a stern “Sir,
you must go!”
And so, although I shouldn’t |
Just because he really wouldn’t
Desist when first I said to him
“No 1" *
Why, so all in a minute
There wasn’t much sin in it,
| He—well, he kissed me while the
| lights were dim and low.
—Orange and Blue.

THE FLAPPER REPLIES

If e’er my hair was somewhat
mussed,
When from a ride I came,
Recall it might have been a gust
Of wind which was to blame;
And anyway, is my response,
Honi soit qui mal y’ pense.

You find me off alone with Jim,
With all the lights turned out,

I might just want to talk to him
With no one else about;

And anyway, is my response,
Honi soit qui may y pense.

I don’t get home till half-past three,
(The party stopped at two),
We might have had a blow-out see?
And had to change a shoe;
And anyway, is my response,

Honi soit qui may y pense.

If blue was red,

’N red was blue,

’N you loved me,

’N I loved you,

’N all alone were just us two—
’N I liked kisses

’N you did, too,

Gee—I would, would you?—Ex.

He (poetically)—I could hang on
your very words,
She—Is my line as strong as that?

Men may go with charming flap-
pers, :
College widows and all such.
But for me the greasy pigskin
Is the skin I love to touch.
—Punch Bowl.

Frank Wildman recently attempt-
ed to relate to the Pandeinic Liter-
ary Society some items of current
interest. Among other things was
the fact that the Dixie Flyer had
been wrecked near Calhoun, Ga.
At least the audience learned this
afterwards. Frank expressed it as
lfollows: “Ihe Dixie Flyer running
lat the rate of sixty miles per hour
ran into a windstorm near Calhoun,
Ga., drawn by two engines and was
wrecked.”

‘lhe professor was discussing trig-
onometry, and said “Now Mr. Mc-
Falls, if we have forty-four degrees
and add one, how many will we
have?”
McFalls, awakening from slum-
ber—‘“Fifty-three, doctor.”
he professor repeated the ques-
tion, adding “I don’t see why you
don’t see that Mr. McFalls.”
McFalls—“Oh, I see now.
would be 104 degrees!”

The infirmary still seems to be
popular with many of the students.
Those who were fortunate or un-
fortunate, as the case may be, duting
the past week as to spend a few
days there were, G. Rodgers, A. L.
Patterson, W. R. Hough, Jas. Moore,
H. L. Currie, Glenn Houck, E. L.
Cox, and. Payne Brown.

Was it strategy on the part of
Bob McLeod in appointing Red

The many friends of Herbie
Knight, ’22 were indeed pleased with
his sister. Miss Isabel Knight, co-
star with Miss Christian, who play-
ed in the Operetta “Martha.” Miss
Knight’s singing was above par and
was thoroughly enjoyed.

Quite a number of the students
insist on letting everyone know
they’re from the country by patting
their feet during the playing of a
musical number, or the singing of a
hymn in chapel.

Fresh Faggart thought the direct-
ress of the Operetta was the cheer-
leader. He says she is some cheer
leader!
