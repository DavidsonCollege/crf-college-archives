Panel Planning
3-Term Free U.

By DAVID HANIG
Staff Writer

The two members of last
year’s Free _ University
committee left for Junior
Year Abroad without instruct-
ing their successors how to
organize the program. As a
result, this year’s Free Uni-
versity committee is a lit-
tle short on experience.

Nonetheless, the Free Uni-
versity program this year
will offer courses in all
three terms for the first
time.

Ear] Robinson, senior mem-
ber of the committee, hopes
to avoid such confusion in
the future. “‘This year,” he
said, ‘I'd like to spread re-
sponsibility to prevent this
sort of thing.”

The astronomy course is
now given for credit by the
physics department. Courses
which have been popular iff

Oct. 17
Planned

By ROBERT TOUCHTON
Staff Writer

As October 17 and David-
son's: traditional Homecom-
ing weekend draw near, the
College Union Board is work-
ing to schedule the final
events of the major fall term
social event.

Heading the list of ‘‘name”’
entertainers planned for
Homcoming 1970 are Kenny
Rogers and the First Edi-
tion,’ currently one of the
most popular rgoups on the
college curcuit.

As part of Davidson's Art-
ist Series of fine performers,
the New York Electric String
Ensemble, a group of five
Julliard-educated men who
perform ‘‘Bach ‘to Rock” on
electrical instruments, will
perform on Friday n-ght.

Following the Saturday
night concert with Kenny
Rogers. and the First Edi-
tion, Freeway will play for

a dance from 10 p.m. to 2
a.m.
Freeway, formerly known

as Freedom 70, was.to have
performed at last Saturday's
“mixer, with Salem College
freshmen, but was postpon-
ed because of illness in the
group.

On both Friday and Satur-
day nights, the movie “The
Sterile Cuckoo,”’ which stars
Liza Minelli, will be shown.
Henry Nillson’s song ‘Come
Saturday (Morning’’ is the
movie's theme.

A major part of Homecom-
ing for students and alumni
alike is the Saturday after-
noon football game, which
this year pits the Wildcat
varsity against the Paladins
of Southern Conference foe
Furman University from
Greenyille, S. C. The game
will ‘be played at 2 p.m.

According to Stuart Shel-
don, a student coordinator
of Union - sponsored events
this year, ‘Surrounding ac-
tivities will be announced
later: which will build upon
the resources in the David-
son community suth as the
‘Hungry d.’”

Although these events have
not been firmly scheduled,
Shelton promises a full week-
end of events, which will in-
clude traditional happenings
as the Sunday breakfast fol-
lowing Saturday night's
dance. and activities.

’

ception, bridge, auto me-
chanics, ‘guitar, chess and
astronomy.

This year, the Free Uni-
versity committee is writ-
ing a questionaire to send
to students to give them an
opportunity to express their
course preferences and to
give their ideas for new
courses.

“One of the problems is
just getting students to give
suggestions,” Robinson said.
High turnover of the com-
mittee due to the difficulty

of the basic organizational
work, ‘‘We_ should have
enough people this year,”

Baron Manufactures Semi-Sweet Songs
With Landscape Lyrics At “Hungry d’

A REVIEW
By Paul Rowland

Chocolate often proves a
useful guide to the under-
Standing, or at least the de-
scription, of music.

Tom Jones, for example,
is like devils food cake. He's
very white on the outside,
but has a very black voice.
“The publicity garbage put
out‘on Steve Baron describes
his work as ‘‘a strange com-
bination of folk, rock, and

jazz."
To be sure, Baron and
buddy, bass-player Jeff

Lowell, have the appearance
of rock performers with hair
and apparel.

And they have a folkish
sound—due primarily to Ba-
ron's acoustic quitar- and a
few numbers where the ly-
rics are talked more than
sung.

But jazz just isn't there.

Nor does it need to be.

Hershey sells several sorts
of chocolate. There's the
very rich milk chocolate;
there're crunchy varieties
with almonds, peanuts, or
puffed rice; and then there
is semi-sweet.

Baron's ballads are semi-
sweet. They are definitely
not the sickeningly sweet
ditties so often heard on
WAYS (e.g. bubble gum).
Nor are they the sonorously
sour songs variously perpe-
trated by artists from Dylan
to Joplin. Nor are they in
between; they are simply
semi-sweet.

=

Reeling through the roller-
coaster rush of ‘Don't You
Hate the- Feeling’’ Baron
spits out the words. and
Lowell's harmony vaguely
reminds you of something
between Simon and Garfun-
kel and the Everly Brothers,
but without the drippy,
teeny-bopper business.

Then singing something
softer Baron's baritone de-
lievrs his lyrics with occas-
ional vibrato reminiscent of
Donovan (remember Lalan-
ya?) but again without the
teeny-bopper milk  choco-
late.

Avoiding the artocious ad-
diction to alliteration once
displayed by Crosby, Stills
and Nash (before Young),
Baron's lyrics paint land-
scapes and often let you fill
in the foreground.

The total effect is on the
plane between giddiness and
dispair, between happy and
sad; in short, savory melan-
choly.

The Fall Fever decor of
this hungry d (described by
Baron as “‘like giant, black
baggies) may not be worth
having your retinas fried by
the black lights, but Baron
is well worth fifty cents and
a study break or a cheap
date. im

Reviewers are fond of tak-
ing all or more than they've
said; this is one of those
cases where the artist does-
n't do much but what he does
he does very well.

10 New Foreign Scholars
Lend Cosmopolitan Flavor

By WINDY MARCH
Staff Writer

Several of the 10 foreign
students attending Davidson
this year expressed definite
opinions on politics, the race
problem, and the school in
recent interviews. Nine of
the students are Richardson
scholars.

The other, Nadeem Faizi,
is here on his own. A native
of Communist - controlled
Mongolia, Faizi left his home
over a year ago. He travell-
ed through the Middle East
and Europe, and then, with
the help of friends, came
here to school.

Questioned about the stu-
dent radical movement ‘n
America, he said he found
America students generally
more consevative than those

in other countries. But, he

said, political and economic
conditions here are less con-
ducive to student rebellion.

Two Richardson scholars
from Wést Germany, Rai‘ni-
er Langenberg and Peter
Hans, agreed that students
here are more conservative.
They did not consider them-
selves members of the ‘‘ra-
dical minority’’ of German
students.

Still, they said, they had
not expected to see such ce-
remonies as the convocation
on Monday. In Germany,

‘they said, such ceremonies

were sure to be disrupted by
students.

Ken Ozeki, Richardson
scholar from Tokyo, said
that America held few sur-
prises for him due to the
familiarity with America in

Japan. In Ken's words, “I

experienced no culture
shock."
He did say, however, that

he had expected racial pre-
judice to be more obvious,
especially in the south than
he has found it to be.
Tesfaye Demmelash, of
Eth-opia, echoed this senti-
ment when asked what he

thought of the
blem in America.

Other Richardson scholars
for this year are: Rene Cast-
elein, from the Netherlands;
Sten Jacobsen, from Den
mark; Gudmundur Karlsson,
from Iceland; Satoshi Kon-
ishi, from Japan; -and Mo-
bashir Salahuddin, frony Pa-
kistan.

“Task Force’ Stressing Involvement

By JIM HANNA
Staff Writer

The Davidson YMCA chap-
ter's activities this year will
be “pretty much the same
programs as before, but with
a few new wrinkles,”’ ac
cording to College’ Chaplain

Scott Woodmansee, the
group's faculty advisor.
All the. programs — stress

“helping the Davidson stu
dent become involved’ in
problems both on and off the
campus,~said Woodmansee.

In addition to regular ser-
vices sponsored by the
YMCA, which range from
the ‘Stimulus’ discussion
groups on campus to lead-
ing Boy Scout troops in the

Davidson area, two new ma-
jor activities are slated to
begin this year.

These are an ecumenical
worship service, to be held
every Wednesday morning
at 10:00 a.m. in the Lingle
Chapel, and a group of ‘‘task
forces’’ set up by:the YMCA
Cabinet to study social prob:
lems such as poverty, urban
ills, and educational reform
in the Davidson-Cornelius
area.

Programs continued from
the past include the STEP
program, where college stu-
dents tutor elementary stu-
dents in the Davidson and
Cornelius schools, Hall Dis-
cussion Groups, and the In-

Hinson Expands
Films Program

The Union's Fine Films
program this year will be the
largest to be’ seen at David-
son in recent years.

Senior Dick Hinson is re-
sponsible for organizing the
program, including selecting
the films which appear.

“T tried to arrange a pro-
gram which had some varie-
ty this year,"’ Himson said.

““My basic idea is that it
is time for motion pictures
to take a central position on
this campus. Films are the
most relevant art form of our
time. The camera itself — is
the result of modern tech-
nological advancements.”’

H:nson added that in the
future he would like to see

Computer System Fails
To Produce Class Rolls

By STEVE EARP
Staff Writer

The class rolls for this
year finally emerged from
the depths of the new com-
puter system in time for
Tuesday classes.

Jerry A. Roberts, asso-
ciate professor of mathema-
tics, and Ken Carmack, sys-
tems analyst, finally suc-
ceeded in producing the lists
after a frenzied summer of
preparation and four days
of classes in which profes-
sors had no class rolls.

“The new computer didn't
arrive until the first of Au-
gust, and we just did not
have: enough time to set up

programs, test them, and
run them through the sys-
tem,"’ Roberts said. ‘‘It is

normal for an operation of
this type to. take several
months."’

The work. began in earnest
in June, when Roberts and
Carmack started writing
programs to feed into the
computer. ‘“‘The scheduling

system alone took more than
thirty’ different programs,
and each program takes a
full day to set’ up,’’ Roberts
commented.

‘When that’s finished, we
need to test each program
by itself and again in con-
junction with the others. All
this testing was just impos-
sible to do in such a_ short
time. zd

‘‘We couldn't anticipate all
the problems, though,’ Rob-
erts said. “‘One student used
the drop-add option, but he
signed up for the same three
courses again. The computer
turned a flip over that one.”

The two men still managed
to come close to the dead-
line, though. “One weekend
Ken came in on Saturday
morning and didn't leave
until Monday night. I work-
ed straight through on three

different nights,” Roberts
stated.
Now that the immediate

crisis has passed, Roberts

will return to his normal
teaching job, while Carmack
will take over the computer
office completely. The next
big project for the system
will be the students’ grades
for the first term, which go
out in December.

“There is plenty of time
for that, though, so there
shouldn't be any real prob-
lem there,’’ Roberts said.
“I think we'll have a very
flexible, useful system—once
we get the problems ironed
out.’’

a movement toward ‘‘thema-

tic groupings in the fine films ;

series or perhaps director-
ial groupings."

‘Hinson himself made the
final selections for this year’s
films. ‘I talked with sever-
al professors, Holland, Ab?
bott, Bliss and Cornwell,
just to get some ideas and
some names to work from.

“Then I did ' reading in
some books on the cinema to
decide which of the sugges-
tions that I wanted to in-
clude in this year's series.’
- Only four of the films are
products of the last decade.
Hinson said that the decision
to show the earlier films
was made on two counts.

“The more recent
are more expensive. For ex-
ample ‘‘La Guerre’ Est
Finie,’’ produced in 1966 was
by far the most expensive.

“And then, too, there are
so many great films from
the 1920's and 1930's, like
Charlie Chaplin's ‘Gold
Rush,’ that people aren't

films

-aware Ol.

Hinson put the twst of the
series at roughly $1500. He
added that he hopes that
ticket sales will--meet the
cost. Season tickets for all
15 shows cost five dollars.
Single admission is one dol-
lar.

As in the past there will
be discussions after each
film which will be led by
professors or interested stu-
dents over coffee.

To Elect.

Senate

By DOUG BROWN
Staff Writer

Thursday, Oct. 1 is the
deadline for candidates to
qualify for election as RHC
members, SGA senators, and
freshman class cheerleader.
The election will be held on
Oct. 8.

Allen Peterson in 211 East
is currently registering oan.
didates for office. ‘I guar-
antee there will be a run-
off,’’ he said, although the
date for the runoff has not
yet been fixed.

Each dormitory will elect
one RHC representative and
one SGA senator. However,
since freshmen are on the
third and fourth floors of
Watts and the first floor of
Belk, it is probable that
these floors will vote as a
unit.

Each class will elect three
senators at large, and the
individual who receives the
most votes will become the
president of his class. The
off-campus students will also
elect a senator,
