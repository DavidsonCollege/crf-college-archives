WHENEVER the horse stopped (which it did very
often), he fell off in front; and, whenever it went on
again (which it generally did rather suddenly), he fell
off behind. Otherwise he kept on pretty well, except
that-he had a habit of now and then falling off side-
ways;, and, as he generally did this on the side on
which Alice was walking, she soon found that it was
the best plan not to walk quite close to the horse.

Upchurch On Women’s Lib

My experience as a parti-
cipant in the Queens Symp-
sium on ‘‘the woman ques-
tion” revealed to me the need
for a clear understanding of
the issue among men,. while
leaving me curiously taiked-
out on the subject.

This being the case, I am
happy to yield to the less be-
fuddled intellect of senior
Jim Upchurch, whose views
on the implications of fem-
inism follow.

‘Kate Millett nas bali’
The firs: quick glance at the

Lean’s Directing Salvages
‘Ryan’s Daughter’ Script

A REVIEW
By SCOTT DAVIDSON

Arriving in Charlotte this
week is one of.the strongest
examples of directorial in-
fluence today, ‘Ryan's
' Daughter."’ . David Lean,
responsible for such films as
“Bridge on the River Kwai,”
*(Lawrence. of Arabia,’’ and
“Doctor Zhivago,” is one of
Hollywood's greatest mast
ers of technique.

In a Lean film you can
count on several elements.
A rather simple story is en-
tangled in the mesh of its
political background, one of
the key. characters is either
physically or mentally dis-
torted, and any majof ilove
story-is predestined to doom
(so forget about happy end-
ings).

Lean incorporates a strong
use of symbolim. Long shots
of the pounding surf and
closeups of the quivering
leaves. And in case you
don't catch all of this, Lean
is again teamed with com-
poser Maurice Jarre, who
provides the swelling, gush-
ing strains that preclude
any possible doubts. °

- Lean handles his actors
well. Sarah Miles, as Rosy
‘Ryan, is direct without be-
ing overpowering and sensu-
al without being sexy. Ro-
bert Mitchum as her impot-
ent schoolteacher husband

is extremely effective as is .

Trevor Howard as the vil-
lage priest.who knows all.
John Mills Is triumphant
as Michael, the town idiot,
who presence you can ail-
ways count on to foresha-
dow ‘diaster for our lovers.
Christopher Jones is the
British officer Rosey falls
for. He is stolid and wooden.
but Lean recognizes this too,
and doesn’t give him too

much to say.

The big disappointment of
‘Ryan's Daughter’’ is the
screenplay by Robert Bolt.
He has written a nice roman-
tic story, but it isn’t enough
to encompass the scope and
grandeur ‘‘Ryan's Daughter’’
purports to inctude.

It seems a shame that the
fine performances are team-
ed with Bolt’s screenplay,
Tt is: a_ tribute to. Lean’s

mastery that ‘Ryan's
Daughter” is the production
it is.

That Bott's screenplay is
not a stronger statement is
a disappointment in light of
his previous efforts.

‘Ryan's Daughter’ is a
visual treat, but sadly lack-
ing in substance. Lean has
made it into a mastery of
technique, and for this alone
we can be grateful.”

sponse, for the time being,
was the contemptibly inevit-
able ad hominem (ad femi-
nam?) argument of libelous
ridicule. The remark drew
dutiful laughter from his
equally uncomfortable bud-

‘dies; they retreated quicky

to the refreshment table,
which stolidly supported a
punch-and-cookie offering ar-
ranged in the finest Ameri-
can Hostess tradition.

I suppose most Davidson
gentlemen © half. expected
Millett to be a screamer, a
radiclib Valkyrie whose hys-
terical irrationalities would
leave our smugness unscath-
ed, even reinferced.

But the woman refused to
submit to our expectations.
She read, in a warmly pro-
fessorial style, from a pre-
pared text. Her disgressions
never fell below the high
tone of her recitations. She
has been a teacher of Eng-
lish, and so we pounced with
pedantic savagery on her.er-
rors in diction and. gram-
mar (‘building .on this su-
perstructure’’ ; “irre-
gardiess~.-. .'') Intellectual-
ly unrespectable. But when
she was finished I think
many of us had glimpsed
the basic truth that under-
lies her occasionally insup-
portable assertions.

‘Ms. (Millett is one of those
fortunates who have such a
firm hold on the essential
truth of the situation that
most criticism begins to
seem like quibbling. She re-
duces biological differences
between the sexes to incon-
sequential matters of struc-
ture, in which she is proba-
bly mistaken; I find it hard

Computer Ballots Invented

, By GRAY WILSON
Managing Editor

Regordless of your poiiti-
oal perspective, one good
thing has come out of the
student elections this term.

Assistant Professor of
Mathematics Jerry -Roberts
has verified with the ‘com-
puter an invention all his
own - - - the student ballots
which people marked in the
past few weeks.

The ballots are nothing

more than sheets with sim-

ple grids on them, but in
the computer room. they
serve as forms for the scan-
ner unit. And they work.

Roberts said he was “‘sur-,

prised that no one had
thought of it before,” but
the Optical Gcanning: Com-
pany, which supplies the pa-
per materials and forms
for the college computer is
now interested, very inter-
ested.

This company produces
standard forms in large vol-
umes for colleges, such as
multiple-choice sheets, grade
report forms, and registra-
tion sheets, but it had nev-
er encountered the problem

of the small volume use of
forms. :

‘Roberts’ experiment dem-
onstrated that’ small-volume
production of computer
forms is practical and ‘econ-
omical. He said that getting
such a small order from the
company was too costly, so
last summer he began kick-
ing around a few money-
saving ideas.

The elections offered him
an excellent opportunity to
test his experiment with
some sample ballots, and
despite minor tears (which
is normal abuse for a scan-
ner) the forms worked per-
fectly.

“They say necessity is the
mother of. invention,’’ Rob-
erts said, ‘‘and I could just
see that there were a lot of
forms,. too expensive to pur-
chase, that we needed. What
these forms do is essentially

‘to provide for us a means

for getting more out of the
machine.”

With these new forms,
elections results am other
small . questionnaire’ materi
als can be evaluated in se-
veral minutes. The only
thing that has to be done be-
forehand 4s to print the ma-

terial onto the forms and
adda few grid marks for
lining up‘the sheets with the

scanner.

b

Many colleges today, ac-
cording to Roberts, are turn-
ing to the “computer as a
thme saver in cumbersome
administrative situ ations
where such things as grade
reports must be evaluated
in a few days for thousands
of students.

The Optical Scanning
Company plans to begin
stocking smaH-volume forms
now in addition to their re-
gular bulk supply of other
standard forms.

But ‘does Roberts want to
copyright this discovery,
does he want to turn over
a few coins, make a little
jack? No.

“The college is not in a
profit-making position,’ he
stated, ‘‘and I have no need
for. anything of that sort.
But if anyone else is inte-
rested, more power to
them.”’

\

He made this last remark
with an upward gesture of
both arms, almost grinning.

He really didn’t care. He ©

really didn’t.

- our society

to believe that menstruation,
pregnancy, gestation and
childbirth» in themselves
have no more effect on a
person's personality and
character than a_ haircut
But such differences, if they
exist, do not justify the way
is stacked a-
gainst independent and crea-

tive women.

She reduces marriage to
an economic exchange (hot
kisses and housekeeping for
bread), which does not
square with my own obser-
vation; but that Marxist
element is. in there some-
where, and maybe responsi-
ble for the creation of those
self - effacingly dependent,

, neurotic bovines that too

many housewives become.

I think Ms.-Millett hai,
been accurate in the general
outlines of her historical
perspective, locating us on
the crest of a second wave
of feminism, the first break-
er having crashed and dis-
solved with the end of the
suffrage movement,

So: give Kate Millett and
her movement, what do we
do?

There seems to be little

point in reiterating what
Irving Howe calls the
“transparently  just’’  de-

mands. of - the ‘movement:
equal employment = and
wages, day-care centers for
working mothers, an end to
discrimination in higher edu-
cation, and the like.

What interests me are the
ethical and psychological de-
mands that this revolution
is making on men, those sug-
gestions about. discarding
our artificial social roles
and the patronizing attitudes
we have toward women.
Treat women as equals? Re-
peat the phrase; draw the
idea out to its fullest con-
sequences; now notice the
reflexive attempt to with-
draw your testicles from
their vulnerable position.

Can we learn to listen to
women “with our whole
selves’’ instead of just the
un-preoccupied part? Can
we learn to take their opin-
fons seriously, to recognize
when we are mistaken with-
out feeling unmanned? Can
we allow women to seek ful-
fitment in something beyond
attending to our comforts?
Can we acknowledge their
human _ identity, which in-
cludes but is more than
their’ sexual identity?-

A few months ago I had
Satisfied. myself that I was
up to these things, at least
in theory. But what of the
realife situation? Imagine
yourself, a prosperous doc-
tor or lawyer, who has libe-
rated himself and his wife
enough to be happy that she
has found additional fulfill-
ment outside the home.
Now, 0 archetypal white -li-
beral, imagine the day when
she is offered a better job
at higher pay—in another
city. If you assume that she
will, make the sacrifice . in-
stead of you...

Think about it.
