Board of Visitors Chair-
man L. Richardson Preyer
won election to Congress
Tuesday, triumphing over
Republican William Osteen
in North Carolina's 6th Dis-
trict.

Preyer, a former federal
judge, resigned his judgeship
in 1964 to run for the N.C.
Democratic gubernatorial
nomination. After losing he
joined the North Carolina
National Bank in Greensboro.

The new congressman was
among those mentioned as
possibilities for the Davidson
presidency last year after the
resignation of President D.
Grier Martin. However,
Preyer denied that he had
ever received any kind of
nomination for the job.

The Board of Visitors is
drawn from eminent busi-
nessmen, academicians and
public officials. Among the
present members are Secre-
tary of State Dean Rusk, for-
mer N. C. Governor Terry
Sanford and Dr. William
Friday, president of the Uni-
versity of North Carolina.

of the grant.

“The grant.from the Kenan
Trustees is especially import-
ant to Davidson at this time.”
Spencer said. “It represents
a recognition of academic
quality and performance
which helps to establish the
college further as a very de-
sirable choice for both pros-
pective students and faculty,
and it provides resources
which will enable us to add
to the faculty another pro-
fessor of highest calibre.”

The Kenan name is well
known in North Carolina,
Kénan was born in Wilming
ton, and one of the largest
trust grants has gone to the
University of North Carolina
for professorships.

Besides UNC and Davidson.
13 other colleges and univer-
sities, all of national prom-
inence. have been given
grants for Kenan professor-
ships.

In making the grant, the
Kenan Trustees did not
specify that the recipient
should be in any particular
academic field, Spencer said.
But they did express their
hope that the Kenan Profes-
sor would have a ‘‘special

Senate Tuesday adopted a
resolution calling for a volun-
tary ROTC program at Da-

The Senate also appointed
a committee made up of
senators Covey Carter, Steve

Roger Mills to study the col-
lege's chapel program.

The resolution dealing with

The resolution went on to
say that the Senate favored
the continuation of the ROTC
program if it can justify it-
self on a voluntary basis.
A committee was appoint
ed by the Senate to study
the exact procedures involved
in implementing the volun-
tary program.

The resolution was passed
only after a rather lengthy
debate that saw several sena.
tors concerned about the pos-
sible extinction of the total
program if it were put on a
voluntary basis.

Gary Cash cited figures
from the ROTC Department
which said that generally
only 10 percent of the fresh-

take the course if it were
voluntary, but on the other
hand an average of 60 per-
cent of the sophomores gen-
erally enroll ,in advanced

chapel programs and -hall

said he hoped the voluntary
program would induce the
ROTC Department to convert
to a saleable product.

2 Dorms Open
Saturday Night

Five residence halls will hold open dorms
tomorrow, according to Peter Hobbie, president

of the RHA.

The time of the open house will vary for
each dorm, depending on the time set by each
dorm’s house committee, he said.

Open dorms will be conducted under two
main guidlines, said Hobbie.

The first states that “doors should be left
open,” while the second says that “students should

be fully dressed.”

Separate bathroom facilities will be provided
for women guests, Hobbie said. and someone will
inform the residents when five minutes remain
before the end of the open period, and also when
the open period has ended.

The schedule of dorms that will be open is

as follows: Belk, 1-2 p.m. and 4-6 p.m;
6-8 p.m. and 10-11 p.m.;

Duke,
Little. 4-6 p.m. and 10-

11 p.m.; Richardson, 4-6 p.m.; and Watts, 4-6

p.m. and 1011 p.m.

Cannon and East dormitories will not have

open house.

Senate Backs Commission

Studying Five Year Plan

By JULE YOUNG
Staff Writer

Seven Davidson students
concerned with the college's
commitment to the present
social situation are conduct-
ing a study of Davidson's
policy toward low-income
and minority group students.

Tuesday night the SGA
Senate sanctioned the group
as the research commission
on the five-year plan.

The committee. presently
chaired by George Robinson,
is concerned that many po-
tentially able students from
ghetto backgrounds are never
able to achieve educational-
ly because of the problems
of their enviroment.

According to Robinson and
Robert Pyeatt. another com-
mittee member, ‘‘These stu-

dents are bright but some-
how fail to score well be-
cause of cultural deficiencies,
background, and_ environ-
ment.”

The group is considering
the possibility of recommend-
ing a five year program for
such students. According to
Robinson, such a program
would enable those who are
bright but culturally and
economically deprived to
pursue a less concentrated
five year period of study.

“We haven't firmly form.
ulated the details of our pro.
posal,’’ Robinson comment-
ed, “but such a five year
plan would provide a lighter
load for the students, allow-
ing increased opportunity for
adjustment, development of
motivation, and remedial

academics."

Both Pyeatt and Robinson
seem to feel that such a
program would do much
more than improve equal
educational opportunity.

“Of particular import-
ance,’’ said Pyeatt, ‘‘is the
fact that such a program
would bring an increased
variety of backgrounds to
Davidson, promoting a more
realistic cross section of to-
day's society and its prob-
lems."

According to Robinson,
many colleges and univer.
sities are beginning to deal
with these problems by
establishing programs that
give special attention to able
underprivileged.

He listed Harvard, Califor.
nia at Berkeley, Dartmouth,

Corneil, CCNY and Antioch
as centers of efforts to en-
roll and assist these students.

In programs at these
schools, overall personal
Strength, emotional tough-

ness, and creative promise
were substituted for grade
and test performances as re-
quirements for admission.
Pyeatt pointed out that
“Cornell sees no direct cor-
relation between SAT scores
and the academic perfor.
mance of people in the cul-
turally deprived category."
In keeping with this philo-
sophy, the committee rests
its -hopes on the possibility
that, given a realistic chance,
the bright poor can not only
survive, but can also help
create a better educational
experience at Davidson.

government at Davidson.

“I'm satisfied with the
work of the Senate itself,”
Hobbie said. “I think it is
stronger than the old Student
Council because people this
year are generally more will.
ing to work.

“However, student govern
ment is not based solely on
the Senate, and there is con
flict and contention among
such student organizations as
the Union Board, the IFC and
the RHA.

“Student movements and
activities could really be ef
fective if they all came un-
der the control of the Senate.
but in the past the areas of
control have been divided up
among various organizations.
Student government must be
unified.

“Right now, student gov-
ernment is hurting. Too many
people think of the Senate
as a debating club when in
reality it should represent all
student power and give con-
trol and direction to student
movements.

“The Senate wonders just
how far its authority goes.
but ! do think the new Con-
stitution will eventually reme-
dy the present disunity.”

Hobbie cited the improve-
ment and enlargement of
social life on campus as the
major issue facing student
government in the immed-
ijate future.

“Phe building of social life
on campus has been neglect-
ed,”’ he said. “I'm referring
to the lower areas of enter-
tainment such as Union acti-
vities and individual social
life, not concerts. This is the
purpose of the RHA~—to bring
social life to the individual
on this campus."

Hobbie. a member of the
presidential Commission on
Social Patterns, expressed the
view that there is an immed-
iate need for more enter-
tainment on the campus.

PETER NHOBBIE
+ + government is disjointed

“It's great to plan for a new
College Union for 1974 but
what about now? The Senate’
can help by bringing pres-
sure: on the administration
now to get changes and spend
more money.

“The Union has neatly
overlooked the freshmen and
independents by referring to
fraternities. The increased’
social life I am talking about
is not just for independents
but would benefit all stu-
dents."

Hobbie said that it is up to.
the student government to
create the sense that social
life can be found on the cam-
pus through the RHA.

Relating to the RHA in
particular. Hobbie said that
there is a basic conflict be-
tween the administration's
idea about the RHA and his
own. “The administration
thinks of the RHA as a cor-
porate organization which is
not realistic. There can be
no unity in a dorm except
perhaps in a freshman dorm.

“The. RHA Constitution is
negative in outlook and was
written with the objective of
cutting down on dorm dam-
age. It’s a deal whereby the
administration says they'll
give us open dorms if we'll
keep them up. However, the
idea of rules is contrary to
the spirit of the Code of' Re-
sponsibility.”’
