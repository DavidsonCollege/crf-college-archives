On Debating...

For many years Davidson has been rec-

a leader in debating, and Other

ognized as
foremste activity.; but at the last debate.

dents gave evidence that Davidson stu-
dents are no longer interested in public-

Debating is, tu every sense of the word,

t is unique in that it is a sport that
one can participate inalt his tite, and in the

fact that it is of lasting social and economic
profit. To the spectator debating offers a
strong challenge, and more chance to par-

ticipate in the conflict than any other, com-

petitive sport, for ft continually challenges

the intellectual powers of the audience as
much as the ability of the debaters them-

Educational System...

Faults can be found in every educational
system,-but many things in the American
system impress us with their stupidity and
lack of trué educational value. It is a pity
that a man’s education must be measured by
a narrow scale of values. :

Recently, C. B. Driscoll wrote in his col-
umn of a young fellow, Dennis McEvoy,
who ran into the inflexible and impossible
college attitude,

McEvoy had done two years work at the
University of Chicago, and had studied at
the Sorbonne in Paris: He had attended sec-
ondary schools in Japan, Germany, England,
and Switzerland; spoke four languages flu-
ently. When McEvoy was contemplating
attending Columbia University, that august
institution demanded his high school di-
ploma. He didn’t have any. So he couldn't
get into Columbia. C. B. Driscoll added
with a note of sarcasm, “That's how smart
a college can be.”

If a true education, according to the
leading institutions, consists of a flimsy cer-
tificate, proving beyond a doubt that John
Dugan has taken his required subjects and

a few miscellaneous electives, what’s the
use of trying to be educated.

For a nominal sum you too can be a Doc-
tor of Philosophy or a Litt.D. You can
3ut anybody with
a printing press can make a diploma. And
it takes more than a pocket book to get a
true education. It isn’t hard to fool most

people, according to Barnum, but you can’t

‘prove it by the diploma.

fool yourself.

even the authorities in the field seem to
have a misplaced set of educational values.
But the dictionary says education is “know-
ledge and ability gained through a syste-
matic course of training.” May educators in
the future place the emphasis more upon the
knowledge rather than put an over-emphasis
upon the system.

on the other hand, to keep one man
from getting more work than he
can handle, and incidentally more
work than he wants. And the distri-
bution of honors, which naturally
follows, would absolutely not result
in giving offices to “weak sisters”
or men unfit for them. As evidence,
take a look at the lists of nominees
in the elections recently held; I
don't believe there is any sensible
student who will deny that almost
every man on those lists, regardless
of whether or not he was elected,
was suited for and capable of hand-
ling the position for which he was
nominated.

Finally, the statement that point
systems are silly and “high-school-
ish” serves only to demonstrate
how little the writer of the letter
knows about affairs on other cam-
puses. If he will take a look
around, I'm sure he will find that
far more colleges than high schools
have point systems and_ benefit
from them.
