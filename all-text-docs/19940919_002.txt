Literary Mlarathon

Zoran Kuzmanovich takes Joyce seminar on 26-hour reading odyssey

By Matthew Eirich

: While most upperclassmen
were enjoying the rush of fresh-
men arriving at Patterson Court,
Dr. Zoran Kuzmanovich’s 12 per-
son English seminar spent the
weekend in a different manner—
reading James Joyce’s novel
Ulysses.

This “Joyce-a-thon,” as it has
come to be called, was held in the
Davidson Day Care center and
lasted 26 hours, from midnight
Saturday until 2 a.m. Sunday. Stu-
dents took turns reading aloud, with
one student reading for a half-hour
while the others listened and fol-
lowed along. Joining the seminar
were Assistant Professor of Ger-
man Scott Denham, Sean O'Neill,
English instructor at Charlotte
Country Day school, and many
Davidson students not enrolled in
the seminar.

Senior English major Charles

Raynal explains that Joyce at-
tempted to write Ulysses as his
concept of the ideal work of art.
This concept manifests itself in the
variety of literary styles used in the
novel. One chapter is written as a
play, while another is written as a

stream of consciousness with no

Kimmel encour-
ages gratitude to
donors

By Randy Hartwell

As many times as our moms
have urged us to say “Thank you,”
we often forget. Stewardship Co-

_ ordinator Meg Kimmel wishes
we’d start remembering.

Kimmel acts as a liaison be-
tween scholarship donors and re-
cipients and itis her job to person-
alize the scholarship process.
Many donors are themselves
Davidson alumni, “so there’s a lot
of sentiment attached to the school
as well as to the idea of the gift of
education,” she says.

She iterates the need to let
donors know who their scholar-
ships are going to and to show
them “how grateful we are.”
Kimmel wants students on schol-
arship to begin and to maintain
contact with their donors.

She asks those who have not
seen her to come by her office in
the Development Offices, or call
her at -2642 to begin correspon-
dence with their donors.

punctuation marks. For emphasis,
Joyce intended the novel to be read
out loud-an idea members of the
seminar excitedly and ambitiously
embraced.

The “Joyce-a-thon” was also
intended, as Raynal stated, “to
prove it can be read.”Ulysses is
around 650 pages long and, given
its experimental nature, proves
quite a challenge. It is described

by many as “the Mount Everest of
modernist fiction.” Kuzmanovich
hoped it would prove to be a true
“intellectual bonding experience”
for the seminar. Following the
reading, the class begins a three
week, in-depth study of the work.

The “Joyce-a-thon” was
broadcast over a small, homemade
adio station and taped for
posterity’s sake.

Saturday afternoon
coffeehouse jam sessions

By Casey Rogers

Every Saturday for.the last
two weeks, the Union Outpost has
been a home for the aspiring musi-
cians of Davidson College. Gui-
tarists, bassists, drummers,
accordian players, and any other
kind of musicians are invited to sit
in on weekly jam sessions held
during the Outpost’s Coffeehouse
on Saturday from 2 - 6:00pm. No
cover songs are allowed, only
straight jams, and anyone is wel-
come to play.

The weekly event has been
organized in order to provide an
outlet for students to release their
inner Santana, relax, and even to
practice.

Senior Will Dearborn has
spearheaded the project with the
assistance of Max Hyde. Max ex-
plains, “we feel it is necessary to
provide a forum for Davidson’s
community of closet musicians.”
Musicians are encouraged to bring
their own instruments, although
there will be others available to
play. The sound equipment—
mikes, amps, and cables—are all
provided.

According to Max, next
week’s sessionis tentative because —
of homecoming, but jamming will
definitly resume the following Sat-
urday. So,tune up your six string,
four string, or 88 key, and head on
down to the Outpost.
