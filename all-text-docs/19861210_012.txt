The returning players

Wednesday, December 10, 1986 THE DAVIDSONIAN*

By MIKE ADAMS
' Seniors
Chris Heineman

Heineman is a scrapper. He
plays to win and will hustle all day
to do it. He’s the type of player
who probably would have enjoyed
being screamed at by Bobby
Knight.

Heineman has started. 62
games over the last three seasons
for the Cats, while averaging 6.5
points per game. Last season he
averaged nine points a game and

was second to Derek Rucker in as-

sist totals.

Heineman’s career scoring
high came last season against Fur-
‘man. The Paladins did not contest
his jumper and Heineman scored
25 points to lead bal Cats to vic-
tory. :

Heineman plays. mainly off-
guard, but he is capable of taking
over the point duties if opponents
concentrate. too heavily on
Rucker.. He spent a significant
amount of time at that position in
his freshman season, when he was
selected to the Southern Confer-
ence all-Freshman team.

The — Davidson’
selected Heineman as last year’s
top defensive player.

Coach Bobby Hussey says,
“There’s no doubt,: he will be a
major factor on this year’s team.”
Anthony (Ace). Tanner

“Ace! Ace! Ace!” This is a cry
often heard in Johnston Gym as
the Soud-led fanatics shout in
homage to one of Tanner’s leap-
ing dunks, great steals or miracul-
ous passes. z

Tanner is the most exciting

coaches-

player on the Davidson team. He
may not play as consistently as
others on the team, but his great
leaping ability and quick hands
allow him to make plays that no
one else can match.

Tanner is a six-seven forward.

~ He can score from the outside with

a soft jumper or from the inside
with his leaping ability. He is also
a defensive intimidator. Oppo-
nents often get so frustrated at his
quick hands and feet that they
practically hand him the ball.

Tanner started 16 games for
the Cats last year. He averaged al-
most eight points per game and
was second on the team in total re-
bounds with 126. His career high
came against East Tennessee State
in the first round of the 1986
Southern Conference tournament
when he scored 17. Tanner was
named to the all-tournament team
for the winning Cats.

Hussey will look.to Tanner for
increased scoring and rebounding
this season. He will have to pick
up some of the slack created by the
loss. of Gerry Born and Jim
McConkey.

Juniors-

Dean Keener

Picture this. Heineman is, sick
with the flu and cannot play.in an
important conference game
against UTC. Keener must fill in
for him. UTC allows Keener to
take his shot uncontested; he hits

_ four three-pointers and scores |

points. to lead the Cats to vict6ry.
It could happen. om

Keener is a fine shooter and
solid ball-handler. He has not had
much playing time in the past, but

who knows the game.”

*

the new three-point shot and
steady improvement in his overall
game should make him one of the
first men off the bench this sea-
son,

Keener is a real asset to the
Davidson team in his ability to fill
in at either the point or the off
guard position.

Of Keener, Hussey . says,
“Dean is like a coach on the floor
Derek Rucker ce

Rucker can beat you in a vari-
ety of ways. Play him loose and
he’ll bury a jumper. Play him tight
and he’Il drive by and sink a layup
or a dunk. Double-team him and
hell hit the open man for an easy
two,

‘ Rucker had a fine sophomore
season. He was an honorable-
mention All-American in The
Sporting News. He was first-team
All-Southern Conference. He led
the team in scoring, assists, steals
and minutes played and finished
the season with the tenth best free-
throw percentage in the nation.

Rucker is a great combination
of point-guard and scorer. He has
excellent range on his jumper and
handles the ball extremely well.
He has averaged in double figures
both of his first two seasons and
barring unforeseen circumstances
he should become Davidson’s
first 1,000 point scorer since
Kenny Wilson sometime around
the first of the year.

Hussey says, “Obviously,
Derek has been a major factor in
bringing national recognition to
our program. He -has excellent

basketball skills, a sharp under-—
- $tanding of the game and plays

with a tremendous amount ‘of
savvy and confidence.”
Jeff Himes

Himes stands 6-4 and weighs
205. And about 201 of that is mus-
cle. His biceps look like they were
carved out of a very large piece of
very hard granite. Himes’ great
strength helps him get his shots in-
side against taller opponents.

Himes has started 47 games in
the last two years for the Cats. He
averaged eight points a game as a
freshman and 10.2 as a sopho-
more. In his freshman season he
was selected to the Southern Con-
ference All-Freshman team and
received the Robert McLeod
award for the team’s top defender.

Himes does his best work in
the paint. He will be the Cats’
main scorer from the insidé and he
has been one of the best reboun-
ders on the team the last two sea-
sons. A prolific points year should
move him over the 1,000 mark
near the end of the season. As the
Cats main offensive force inside,
he. could easily be the top scorer

' for the team.

“Jeff is the type of player who,
quite simply, finds a way to get it
done. He-is an excellent team
player, an extremely quick learn-
er, has good quickness and is
loaded with court savvy,” Hussey
said. -

5 Todd Scott

The-new three-point shot must
look awful good to Scott. He has
the touch to hit it consistently and
the size to shoot over most
perimeter defenders. The three-
point chip shot makes him a real

offensive threat. meee

At 6-5, Scott is a very versatil
player. He has the ball-handling
skills and the quickness to play the
off-guard spot. He also has the
size and rebounding ability to
move inside to the small forward
position.

Scott averaged 3.4 points per
game while appearing in 30 con-
tests for the Cats last season. Last
year was his first for the Cats; he
transfered from the University of
Evansville in 1984 and had to sit
out.a year because of NCAA
rules.

‘Hussey says, “I can put him at
small forward or big guard and he
can score from both spots.”

Mike Gynn

Gynn is one of the biggest men
on the Davidson team. He put on
17 pounds over the off-season to
weigh in a 6-8, 220 this year. His
size and added strength could help
make him a force inside for the
Cats this season.

Gynn has seen little playing
time in his first two_seasons. He

played in only 21 games in his

freshman and sophomore years as
he waited for the graduation of
people like Gerry Born, Jim
McConkey and Ken Neibuhr.

This year should be different.
The Cats will need his size and re-
bounding talents inside. His de-
fense will also play an important
role in Davidson’s success this
season.

Of Gynn, Hussey says, “Mike
has an excellent chance to be a
major factor for this year’s

‘ Wildcats.”

Dave Fitzgerald - ’

Fitzgerald, a 6-7, 205 pound. -
forward, gives the Cats some.ex- -

perience at the big forward posi-
tion.

Fitzgerald has seen limited ac-
tion in his first two seasons, but he
should see much more playing
time this year after the graduation
of last year’s seniors.

Fitzgerald has a good shooting
touch from the inside and outside.

He is also a very aggressive defen-

der who does not shy away from
the physical game on the inside. In
addition to his basketball skills,
Fitzgerald has shown talent on the
baseball field for the Cats, where
he has been a successful starting
pitcher.

Says Hussey, “Dave is a very
versatile player who can give us
help inside.”

Sophomore
Bill Sellers 2
Sellers is a big man. He stands
6-11 and weighs upwards of 240
pounds. The first time I saw him
was last year in the 900 Room. He
was downstairs on the dance

floor. I was in the balcony. We

were eye to eye.

Sellers did not see much ac-
tion last season. He was hampered
by mononucleosis and saw action
in only nine games. He did score
eight points in a Davidson victory
against Catholic. —

Sellers could be-a very impor-
tant part of the Davidson team this
season. His size and strength

make him a strong candidate for

the vacated post position.
According to Hussey, Sellers

runs the court very well for a big

man. “Also, he is a very intelli-
gent person with good athletic
ability and could be the answer to
our inside game in 1986-87.”

Robert Nesbit
