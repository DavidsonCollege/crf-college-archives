NEW MEMBERS RECEIVED BY
SIGMA UPSILON.

The wearers of the flaring blue
ribbons have at last secured a more
modest badge—the scarab of Sigma
Upsilon. After the arduous tasks
of goatdom, they are now true mem-
bers of the beetles. Those who at-
tended the first lyceum will remem-
ber the two coy maidens who sat
on the front bench making eyes
with Mr. Bingham, and the stylish
young gentleman who escorted
them, Those three, J. M. Gaston,
C. J. Matthews, and C. G. Long,
were officially initiated into the
Blue Pencil Chapter on last Wed-
nesday night. After the initiation
ceremony the whole chapter enjoy-
eda feed prepared to resuscitate the
rather worn out neophytes.

Most of the members then took
z midnight auto ride to Mooresville.

DAVIDSON AND RANDOLPH-
MACON TO DEBATE
DECEMBER SEVENTH

Davidson meets Randoplh-Macon
in, Shearer Hall on December 7, in
the first inter-collegiate debate of
the season. .

The query has been agreed upon.
lt is, Resolved: That the Federal
Government should for a period of
20 vears prohibit the immigration
of Japanese laborers into the U.S.
or any of its possessions.

The Debating Council has elected
that Davidson uphold the affirma-
live.

The first, preliminaries are sched-
uled for October 27. At that time
a team composed of three men and
an alternate will be chosen form
each society. These two teams will
meet on November 6 for the second
discussion of the question. At that
time will be chosen the team, com-
posed of two men and an alternate,
which will meet Randolph-Macon.

Davidson's debating teams were
not successful last vear in either of
the two major debates. This year it
is up to the two societies to produce
a team that will “romp all over” the
visitors. It is planned to debate
several colleges in the spring. As
yet nothing definite has been de-

cided regarding the proposed de-
1

hates.

SCENE.

The Ministerial and Volunteer

otte last Saturday night. Hearing

he given at the Keith Auditorium,
most of the members went there.

the able assistance of R.R. Mc-
Iwaine. The front scat, vulgarly
called the “baldhead row” had been
reserved for this distinguished
group of ‘gentlemen by an ardent
admirer. R. J. Knight. Others oc-
cupying this section with the afore-
said gentlemen were, Ih. 0. Me-
Gukin. L. CL. Wilkinson, EF. HH. Tufts.
T M. Lowry, and M. W. Doggett.
They were so enthused with the
character and life of the eminent
Jewish statesman that they im-
mediately decided to form a To-
bleetsky Club. C. J. Matthews was
elected the first president. Their
motto is, “Tobleetsky says.” All
men wishing to join will please hand
their names in to the president at the
earliest opportunity as the member-
ship is to be limited to fifty.
