defense, as “most teams in the SoCon are giv-
ing up 70-80 [points] on those same teams,”
Watts said. “Our young team is beginning to
understand the importance of changing up
defenses and the value of boxing out.”

Thompson exhibited her fair share of
boxing out, snagging 12 boards to double up
her 10 points in the stat book. Laune contin-
ued her good offensive streak with 15 points,
and Paquette notched 11 to round out the of-
fensive highlights.

As both wins and losses suggest, balance
remains the Davidson advantage this season.
The squad boasts a solid bench, unprecedent-
ed depth and well-distributed talent. “In fact,
we have had seven different starting line-ups
due to the depth of our bench,” Watts said.
“We have the ability to start three bigs — So-
phia, Kristen & Julia or we can start ‘speedi-
est’ - Barbara, Alex, Chloe & Katrin.”

Facing threats both inside the key and out,
the Wildcats’ “opponents are forced to adjust
to our players, or run the chance of being
totally outsized or being a step behind us,”
Watts said. As this year’s squad solidifies
team. presence, it poses a challenge to even
the best individual players in the Southern

Conference.

With just over a month in the regular
season left, Davidson sits in a three-way tie
for second place with Samford and College
of Charleston. As Chattanooga holds the top
spot, the competition simmers for some blaz-
ing hot rematches in the coming weeks.
