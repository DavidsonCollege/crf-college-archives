population.

2. An opportunity to reside in
Atlanta, a prominent urban center
for African-American intellectual,
social, and cultural history.

3. An opportunity to explore
curricular options in the social sci-
ences and humanities that are not
readily available at Davidson.

4. An occasion to live and
study in an environment where
African-Americans are inkey civic
and academic leadership positions.

Conversely, the program will
also “create an opportunity for
Morehouse College to provide
some of its students with access to
diverse cultural and ethnic views.”

Eaves believes that students

from both schools will find the

program to be greatly beneficial,
as well as challenging, as being in
such anew environment “will prob-
ably be very overwhelming at first.”
Although the effort to estab-

lish this exchange program began
before the rise in racial tensions
surfaced at Davidson last year,
Eaves says that the presence of
those problems helped motivate
him and his team. They saw the
exchange program as “providing
Davidson students with an envi-
ronment where they can be sensi-
tized to some of the racial issues
that exist today”, hopefully allevi-
ating misunderstandings and con-
flicts that often arise in racial dis-

putes... a cccuaeeaices

To Eaves, one of the crucial

aspects of creating this kind of
learning environment was ensur-
ing that the visiting students from
each school would be guaranteed
on-campus housing. Eaves felt
that this was very important. in
giving Davidson students “the full

experience of living at
Morehouse.”
Because Morehouse is an all-

male school, only male Davidson
students will be eligible for the
program. However, Eaves’ next
goal is to establish a similar ex-
change program with Spelman
College, Morehouse’s sister
school, also located in Atlanta.
Applicants for the Morehouse ex-
change program must have a mini-
mum GPA of 2.0, as well as a
desire “to represent Davidson
well.” Students will be eligible to
participate in the program during
the second semester of their sopho-
more year, as well as in their junior
year, and may choose to attend
Morehouse either for a semester or
for a full year.

The application process for
the program will begin in the spring
of this year, with the.first student
exchange taking place next fall.
The cost of the program for
Davidson students will equal that
of attending Davidson, and the stu-
dents will receive course credits
equal to those that they would re-
ceive from Davidson. Eaves hopes
to start the program with the ex-

changeofoneortwostudentsfrom_ |

each school, possibly later increas-
ing this number.

Students interested in any in-
formation about the program
should. contact John Eaves.in the
Dean of Students Office.

particular attention to the rigor of
the high school curriculums, the
achievement of the students in the

“courses of study, the quality of

essays on the applications, the qual-
ity of the students’ character por-
trayed through personal and aca-
demic references, and the standard-
ized test scores.”

The admissions officers are
actively seeking minority students
as well as international applicants.
However, Wells said that most im-
portantly, “We will accept the
strongest academically and per-
sonally to Davidson.” Douthit said
that they are looking for “those
students who can benefit from the
type of education at Davidson.”

Several new Merit scholar-
ships, like the Comwell Writing
Scholarship, will be available for
this upcoming class of ‘97. Ac-
cording to Wells, the counselors in
Admissions are “really excited”
about the new opportunities for
perspective students and think that
they “will really help admissions a
lot.”

With a goal of 410 to 420
freshman in the class of ‘97, Wells
said, “The admission picture looks
quite strong.”

Stasack will also perform two
works which have been written
during her residency at Davidson.
Herhusband, poet Tom Saya, wrote
the texts for these two composi-
tions. The Concert Choir will per-
form one piece.

The program is dedicated to
the memory of Winkler.
