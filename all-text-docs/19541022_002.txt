Race Amalgamation Is Real Problem
In Segregation (Question

The following is the first attempt fo
clarify some of the problems on segre-
gation as presented in last week's poll.
College newspapers throughout the
Seuth are discussing the issue heaterly
pre and con, the discussions usually
centering about the question of whether
er net Colored students should be ad-
mitted to the colleges. Student opinion
at Davidson on this issue is requested.

Articles may take the form of letters to .

“the editor or of reguler columns.

The recent poll of student opinion
regarding the decision of the Supreme
Court on segregation brought many argu-
ments and not a few losses of friendship,
but when the poll was complete the results
showed that the Davidson student body
comes very close to being divided straight
down the middle on the matter. With 52
percent of the student body giving opin-
ions it was found that 44.8 percent favor-
ed the decision, that 44.6 percent were
opposed to it. It becomes evident that if
the entire student body' had been polled
the weight of opinion could well have
gone either way.

With this thought in mind we would
like first to make some generalizations
about the poll and then go into some speci-
fics which the separate students often do
not take into mind when considering ques-
tions of this sort.

First let it be said that those who
were in favor of the recent decision were
usually too vague in their reasons, appeal-

- ing to some sort of nebular idea based up-
on Biblical or constitutional grounds and
grinding out an eternal circle around the
words democracy and equality. On the
other hand, those who were opposed to
the decision too often appealed to noth-
ing more than some on-the-spot old south
motto tinetured with abit of Anglo-Saxon
wording. One side got tangled up in the
irrefutable but not too convincing argu-
ments about “universal truth” or “natur-
al.law,” while the other side stayed too
close to the earth and revealed itself as
appealing to neither God nor reason.

There can be no doubt that all these
patent arguments are grossly effective in
dormroom battles where the student’s
msin purpose is to bolster his ego at the
cost of his opponent, but in coming face

to face with the practical issues of
segregation neither platitudes nor slan-
guage will do the trick. We must seek out
the results of both segregation and deség-
regation, find what they will mean to us
and to our country; then we can apply
what platitudes we may—if they still seem
to fit.

Looking into the side of those who
are in favor of the court ruling we must
face the issue of what will be the result of
integration in the schools. No one can
question the fact that desegregation of
the schools will lead to the same else-
where. Churches, of course, will eventual-
ly follow as will church colleges follow in
the wake of state universities. With white
and colored children growing up togeth-
er, color lines are bound to become less
meaningful than they now are, and inter-
marriage will be the result. The issue of
segregation doesn’t revolve about the
good Samaritan: it revolves about how he
became a Samaritan in the first place, for
he too was of an intermingled race. It is
not a question of public schooling. It is
much deeper. If you would not wince at
the thought of amalgamation of the races,
then you might well have said ‘yes’ last
week.

But what of those who oppose inte-
gration? What do they propose as a by-
pass of it. “Separate but ”" is dead—
and the Negroes won't be faked any long-
er by the argument for it. Two hundred
years out of Africa or not, the Negroes
are nearing the level of American whites,
who aren’t so far out of the bushes them-
selves, and as such they are demanding
equal opportunities. And they will be
heard. The Negro is:a humble person, but
once he gets a spark of desire he will have
his way. If we oppose the ruling because
we feel the inevitability of race amalga-
mation, what are we to offer as a solu-
tion to the Negroes’ demands? One can
sit on the lid of a boiling cauldron only
so long before the pressure blows the lid
sky high and destroys the sitter along
with it. ‘

The problem of segregation is not a
problem to argue about. It is not a philoso-
phical abstract that changes itself once in
a hundred years. It is upon us and must
be answered now.,Not with yes or no, but
with a solution.

A Creampuff College?

You say Davidson is tough?

In a recent talk with one of the mem-
bers of the faculty we ran across a few
facts which added onto multiples of oth-
er facts seem to refute an affirmative an-
swer to the above question. Davidson,
which finds one of its chief sources of
appeal the hardness of its course, is
in reality a row boat behind the various
academic men-of-war in modern Ameri-

Take for instance the freshman his-
tory course at Harvard. Would it be em-
barrassing to find that until recent years
Harvard used in its freshman history
course the text used in Davidson’s ad-

vanced medieval history course. Not ov-
erly embarrassing, you say. But what is
your reply when you find that the Har-
vard freshmen who used this book used
it only one semester as against our two,
covering the whole thing at the rate of a
chapter a day and going on in two addi-
tional books during the second semester.
Recently, we find, Harvard changed this
plan for a more modern, comprehensive
one.

Lest we become overburdened with
our schlastic prowess let us look at these
and more facts like them, eat our humble
pie and go about our way without com-
plaint.

Tolling For Thee?

An occasional dip into little matters
fs refreshing and necessary. The dip this
issue-is'in regard to is the Chambers bell.
Two questions need to be asked someone
in regard to this loud clarion of classtime,
and.if anyone knows the -answers many
students would like to have them.

First, why does Chambers bell ring
thirty or more times every time it rings,
when everyone in the college and the sur-
rounding township can hear the bells

from first to last and are thereby notified
thirty times as much as they should be
of the hour?

Second, why does Chambers bell
shatter the repose of sleepers twice be-
fore 8:00 each morning, making it im-
possible for those who wish to sleep to
do so, and making getting up in the morn-
ing that much more‘ unpleasant for those
who much prefer the hushable pande-
monium of an alarm clock to the incessant
clamor of Davidson's iron gong?

Student Discontent Clouds
Values Of Davidson Education

BY MALCOLM WILLIAMSON

In times within the memory of
all but the freshmen, the David-
eontan and particularly this edi-
torial page have had the deserved
reputation of being a gripe sheet
for the expression of student dis-
content. And this publication was
Hot unsupported by student opin-
jon in these views. One of the hal-
lowed traditions of Davidson Col-
lege seems to be the continual ex-
pression of student discontent with
the motives and policies of the in-
stitution. 1 feel certain that my
generation of students has sincere
doubts as to the velue of e David-
son education.

This summer, it was my privi-
lege to attend a University that is
basically different from Davidson
College. Beyond the coincidence
that both institutions offer class-
es in academic subjects, there is
Nttle similarity. I feel that this ex-
perience has given me a perspec-
tive which I could never have had
so long as my entire educational
experience was confined to David-
son. Six weeks in summer school
does not make me an expert on
undergraduate educational institu-
tions, but it does make me more
conscious of Davidson’s peculiari-
tles.

Valuable Peculiarities
The most valuable peculiarity of
Davidson (and a few other schools
of the same general type) is the
part which campus fellowship
plays in the educational process.

This valuable contact between and
within the groups of students, fac-
ulty, and administration is not
available on the large campuses or
on the campuses that operate on
the philosophy that the completion
of so many academic hours makes
an educated man.

Here at Davidson there are nu-
merous tangible things worthy of
preservation that make this col-
lege more than just a place to pass
courses. They are the things that
unite the students in common in-
terests and experiences and pro-
vide the opportunities to know pro-
fessors as men instead of just lec-
turers. Football, played on an ama-
teur basis by boys who enjoy the
sport, is one of these assets. Chapel
and vespers are others.

These activities develop the
Davidson student in et least two
ways which are unconcerned
with religion. First, he is expos-
ed to the thoughts held by men
both brilllent and otherwise on
a myried of subjects. Second, the
eriticiem of these compulsory
activities will eventually force
him to give seme though? to
whole subject of education and
its objectives. Such stimuli are
not obvious in many institutions.

Social Fraternities

Social fraternities play an im-
portant role in the extra-classroom
education. Education is rarely
utilized fully in a man who is bas-
ically unable to get along with his
fellows. An educational institution
is incomplete that does not in‘some

way encourage social intercourse
among its students. An acquain-
tance with the ideas and customs
of our civilization must be acquir-
ed in a formal situation, but a deep
understanding of their significance
can often best be acquired through
the social relationships encouraged
by fraternities.

One of the most valuable types
of fellowship which is available at
Davidson is the opportunity to
know faculty members as men. I
feel that it is often by personal
contact and example that an ap-
preciation for the place of educa-
tion in a life is best gained. And it
is this area that Davidson is most
successful as a college. Our. facul-
ty may not be the most brilliant of
‘any in the world, but I feel that
they are more suctessful than the
faculties at most institutions in
leading us to realize that an un-
derstanding of our world will
prove more valuable to our lives
than will the speedy mastery of
some remunerative. skill.

The purpose of this article is
merely to suggest a few of the rea-
sons why Davidson men usually do
pretty well in life despite the fact
that they attended a college where
they were “regimented and told
what to do.” My purpose is not to
shout a frenzied “ne ultra,” but
to say that there are mighty few
colleges that offer the individual
so many opportunities for his
growth and development within
four short years.

Little Mencken

Laundry Compared
To Old Inquisition

BY HIRAM CATON

Several days ago I was startled,
bewildered and embarrassed by
the loud and unbridled cursing of
a student down the hall. I could
not conceive anything being so bad
as to provoke such a flagrant dia-
tribe. Hence, for curiosity’s sake I
cautiously crept down the hall to
investigate.

When I arrived at his room door
he had been cursing continuously
for three minutes, and he had not
repeated himself once! I had to
concede that it was a remarkable
demonstration of self-expression,
even though it was executed in a
banal manner. For fear of injury
or life, I did not enter his room im-
mediately; I waited for the ocean
of wrath to subside. But minutes
passed, and there were no signs of
abatement. Finally my curiosity ov-
erwhelmed me, and against my bet-
ter judgment I poked an apologetic
head inside the door.

A Pre-Ministerial Student

Although he did not see me, I
immediately recognized the frus-
trated soul as a pre-ministerial
student. My first reaction was that
of pity; I knew that if his Presby-
tery heard of this infany he would
never have a chance in the church.
At last I gathered courage enough
to interrupt his diabolic reverie,
and I asked him what had happen-
ed. Still’cursing, he said, in words
that I can not repeat, that he had
just gotten his laundry back. I said,
“O,” ‘and left him to his sorrow,
for then I understood.

I know that many students have
had experiences similar to the one
recorded above, and therefore, in
the best interests of those concern-
ed, and in hope that the faculty,
our benefactors, will take steps to
amend the situation, I hereby un-
dertake to record, for all who will
read, the lamentable plight of Da-
vidson students with regard to the
laundry.

I have asked, at random, many
students what they thought of
the laundry service. Some of the
answers are too horrible to men-
tion here. Suffice it to say that
there were several cases of spon-
taneous epileptsy, one cate of
raving madness, and one case of
tunacy.

Having asked a freshman what
he thought of the situation, big
tears began to seep from his eyes,
and he replied, “Why didn't they
tell us about this in the catalog?
My parents don’t have much
money—none to throw away—and
here they have gone and ruined
nearly all my clothes! I don’t know
what I’m going to do.” With that,
he could not hold his sorrow, and
our conversation short but mean-
ingful, was ended. I blew my nose
and went on about my business.

The next student | interview-
ed also related 0 sad tale, but in
vigorous and lurid terms. He

told me that once he had « shirt
returned to him, that, instead of
being the original white, was
red on one half and e pale
orange on the other. He said
that it was amazing thet the
dyeing job was so even.

A year or two ago, the laundry
instituted a “let's be friends” cam-
paign, during which they replaced
the buttons that they tore off
shirts. A certain student complains
that, although he appreciated their
thoughtfulness, they consistantly
sewed buttons at places where
there were no button holes.

Another policy of our taundry
is to “inspect” the outgoing laun-
dry from time to time. Just the
other day my roommate found
that they had returned only one
sleeve of a very good shirt, and
on top of the shred was « cute
little note proclaiming that
number three had inspected his
laundry. That naturally set us
speculating about what “number
three” is. We finally concluded
that it is probably e sadistic
gorilla, or @ worn out cement
mixer. Maybe the purpose of the
inspection is to make sure noth-
ing slips through without dam-
age.

Armored Vests

Another abominable item is the
starching technique, as many stu-
dents testify. They starch such
things as sheets, pajamas, night
shirts, underwear, handkerchiefs,
and occasionally, neck ties. And
then sometimes they grossly over-
starch. Some of the shirts that
come back from our laundry are
being tested by Army Ordinance to
see if they will replace their ef-
fective armored vests.

But even with all this abuse-
ment, let us not pity ourselves or
langour because of our misfortune.
Remember, somewhere, someone
has more troubles than we.

Lefter To The Editor:
The Churches Part?

Dear Editor:

Would God have cared if one
room had been omitted from our
Davidson College Presbyterian
Church, and the money been used
to better the living conditions of
the families not two hundred yards
from its doors?

Sincerely,
Jack Bolen

Next Week.

Leighton McCutchen, President
of ODK and well] known campus
figure, will sttempt to define
both a “Holy Joe” and an “Un-
holy Joe” along with ea discus-
sion of the motives behind most
of our personal condemnation.

IS $61,000 TOO CHEAP FOR HOMECOMING?

BY GILBERT GRAGG

1 am getting as excited as every-
body else about the approaching
Homecoming festivities. During
my three years here I have been
happy to see each year’s annual
celebration in honor of the alumni
(who have achieved enough success
by modern-day standards to drive
back to view the old school in at
least an Oldsmobile or Buick if not
a Cadillac itself worth its price in
prestige alone) grow bigger and
better from all respects. And this
year there is a definite possibility
that the Wildcats may throw in a
victory over much heralded West
Virginia Tech to make the joyous
occasion perfect.

The week end will find many old
grads excitedly greeting classmates
with fond handshakes whom they
hardly knew in the old days except
to snub occasionally when passing;
perhaps some of them will meet
their old laundry boys if they are
lucky.

“Real Gone Kids”

At any rate we are all glad to
see these enthusiastic alumni who
form the backbone of the college's
support, and nobody begrudges
them the pleasure (a dubious one)
of acting like “real gone” college
kids once again. After all, every-
body but present students in col-
lege admit-readily that the days at
the dear old institution of close
friendships, bull sessions full of
gripes and groans, random hours of
studying, and weeks of carefree
leisure free of the responsibility
of making a living, etc, are the
best of anyone's life.

One thing I admire in the alum-

ni is the way they don’t mind
spending money. Indications are
that around 500 Davidsonians of
yesteryear wil) be here with their
brood (swelling the total to 1100).
The average distance they will
have to travel both ways is esti-
mated at around 120 miles at 7
cents a mile which means $4,200.

Then they will all attend the de-
licious barbecue at $1.50 a head
($1650) and pay $2.50 a head
($2,750) to see the Wildcats first
homecoming win since . . .? In
addition they will part with $2.00
each to hear Ogden Nash ($2,200),
and it is impossible:to predict what
fabulous totals will be registered
in the “Queen City” Saturday night
at various night spots (movies of
course) by the influx of Presby-
terian gentleman to the vicinity.

THE ALUMNI THEN WILL
PART WITH AN ESTIMATED $10,-
800. Unfortunately this will leave
them little to contribute to the
sagging Vesper offering.

The school should be a little
embarrassed that it is being so
conservative in spending only
about half as much as the memory-
conscious alumni. We are grateful
for whatever is being spent for
Ogden Nash (figures not available)
to come offer some of his magnifi-
cent and meaningful witticisms for
our entertainment in order to get
us in the proper mood for dreamy
dancing and riotous partying till
we collapse from fatigue.

Then the $4,500 which is an es-
timate of the total costs of the
football game (pay W. Va. Tech,
band, programs, etc.) and the
$500 being spent by the adminis-

tration on publicity and miscel-
laneous entertainment for us, such
as a movie in the union after Sat-
urday night’s dance, which swells
the total to at least $5,000.

Dior, “Personna non grate”

Congratulations are due to the
lovely young “flowers of inno-
cence” who will drift in about five-
hundred strong over the joy-pack-
ed “lost-week-end” for spending
the most money. Indeed, ‘“mama’s
little darlings” couldn't come to a
big Davidson dance without a new
dance ensemble of about $50 a
piece (this is average estimate—
some will have to wear last
spring's clothes but others, es-
pecially the “Virginia Smart Set”
and the ritzy Episcopalian finish.
ing schools, will pay around $100
for their wardrobe for the week
end, which means a $25,000 lift to
the fashion world. Let’s hope that
the girls have the good taste not
to wear Christian Dior fashions.

Then the buxom beaties will
pay $10 average for traveling ex-
penses and $3 apiece for their lux-
urious dormitory rooms which
means $6,500, bringing the total
amount (get out your adding ma-
chines) that 500 unfortunate fath-
ers will invest in the '54 Davidson
Homecoming Week End to the im-
pressive total of $31,500.

I for one am pretty embarrassed
at the ridiculously small amount
we students are investing in two
days of ecstatic pleasures in light
of these financial facts. We gripe
about putting out $6.00 for dance
tickets and then complain about
not getting a bigger band — after

all we can't expect to have the
real conductor for just $3,700 but
should be content to settle for a
snappy sax playor substituting be-
hind the baton.

Some students thought it would
be a good idea to gét an orches-
tra for half this price (charging
the same for tickets) and send the
difference to some of the teeming
masses in the Orient who'll be
dying of starvation while we glee-
fully listen to “Honey Love.”
What rubbish! How could we ever
get a girl to date us without a real-
ly topnotch band to attract her?
Surely we don’t think she is com-
ing just to see us! It isn’t as if we
were spending $10,000 as Carolina
or other more secular schools do,
who have two different orchestras
for the really big dances or even
$5000 as we did for Ray Anthony!

Counting the dance ticket $6.00
the average “Davidson man in the
know spends $1.50 on his date’s
football ticket, $2.00 on her food
at the boarding houses, $1.00 for
her Ogden Nash ticket, $1.00 on
hair cuts the day before, $5.00 on
Charlotte frolicking (more for stu-
dent council members — “Honor
Squad” — who can't go to after-
dance parties because strangely
enough they believe in the Student
Constitution!), $6.00 for fraternity
assessments, and finally $1.50 for
the chrysanthemums making a to-
tal of $24.00 (total with 500 dating,
$12,000.

What, Ne Orchids!

As to the chrysanthemums we
see again the Scotch vein in us in
not giving orchids; we did you

know up until 8 years ago when
the wave of veterans returned with
their unusual ideas of economizing.
But now that money is flowing
more freely among young people
anyhow I suggest we surprise our
dates with lovely orchids!

An expense which many stu-
dents are not aware of is the
money we lose by no classes Satur-
day. With an average of 2 classes
for 850 students at a dollar apiece
(check college fees) we lose $1,700
which makes a grand total students
spend of $13,700.

I would like to recommend that
we be given two free days before
Homecoming since we are too ex:
cited to study dead languages and
antiquated facts anyhow and then
two more afterwards to wake up
to the nightmare of classes again
more slowly. After all with a grand
total of $61,000 (add it) being
Spent in just two days by every-
body it does seem reasonable to
suggest an extensidn of the festivi-
ties so we can spend more and en-
Joy ourselves to a greater extent.

I must stop now and write my
date (a lovely blonde from West
Virginia) about plans for the week
end, who the orchestra will be,
ete. How can I ever tell her about
the cheap band? Oh well, Tl just
say nobly that Davidson is a Chris-
tian school after all, and we have
to sacrifice now so we can give
generously to the Christmas Gift
Fund — since only $61,000 is be-
ing spent on homecomitig perhaps
we can raise $5,000 for it, although
this is a bit optimistic. What do
you think?
