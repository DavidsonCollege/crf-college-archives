Community Work

By DICK MOREHEAD

What are our obligations, re-| concern to the community. What
sponsibilities, and opportunities of| this evolves to is the desire for a
service toward our neighbors as| working relationship between the
we live in this temporary four-| student YMCA and the church or- .
year society of college life? As| ganizations of the area. had several purposes in going to

Christians, what can we do about
the serious and salient problems
that exist within our community?
These ore the pertinent questions
which the Community Work Com-
mittee seeks to answer as it serves
the neighboring area through the
voluntary efforts of the student
body under the Christian leader-
ship of the Y.

The work of this post is directed
toward the Negro community of
Davidson, especially among older
young people and the adults, Two
of the major aims which have been
set for this year are: one, to at-
tempt to develop a better attitude
within the student body toward
the Negroes, to promote a better
undersanding of their problems,
and in every possible way, to raise
their social standing; and two, to
aid them in growing toward a
keener social, a more informed
and spiritually sound community.

Although these aims seem
gigantic in proportion, much has
already been done toward their
fulfillment. In accomplishing these
goals, Community Work is divided
into the relative groups of function
and study. The former deals with
the carrying out of these things
which seem practical and within
the means of the interested Da-
vidson students. Equally as im-
portant, however, is the need of
the committee and those interested
to study and evaluate the Negro
problem as it exists in our town.
The problem of approach seems to
be foremost, since response from
those served may vary with the
ways in which the work is carried
out.

According to Mike York, chair-
man of the committee, “The air
of ‘doing good’ has little value in
itself; therefore, consideration as
to what can practically be accom-
plished is a major part of our
post’s work. It seems to be the
chairman's job to lead a study of
the situation and to find openings
of service for those students in-
terested in inter-racial work.” Right
now investigations of inter-col-
legiate conferences on these and
related subjects are in effect.

Some form of general publicity
to be put before the Davidson
white community and the college
students is being carefully con-
sidered and planned, as it is very
probable that the social need right
here within five hundred yards of
the campus lies unknown to the
majority of the people.

Of particular concern is the
“eommunity center” building lo-
cated a few blocks down from the
PO, near the Negro grade school
of Davidson. This building belongs
to the Y and is used for social
functions and gatherings. Much
of the committee’s work is cen-
tered around this building and the
school auditorium.

This Sunday night a fellowship
meeting will be held at the Negro
Presbyterian Church in an attempt
to utilize materials and talents
available through the Y for the
betterment of the programs of the
church. It is hoped that on occasion,
students can attend and lead dis-
cussions here on various topics of

Fifty members have signed up
to work with this important func-
tion of the Y. If any who hav
not registered with the committee
desire to do so, they are urged to

arouse among fellow students the
interest and concern of the stu-
dents in the role of the U. N. Some
of the questions the delegates tried
to keep in mind during the con-

Nations? How does it function? Is

it accomplishing its aims and mak-

How can the American people
help to further its cause?

The delegates to this conference

‘Y” GIFT FUND GOAL |Y.M.CA. NEGRO HUT|PRESENT IN

UP $400 FROM 1952 PROJECT DESCRIBED

By CHUCK WRIGHT

The YMCA kicked the lid off
their 1953 Christmas Gift Fund last
night. The goal for this year is set
at $5,000, an increase of $400 over
the amount raised last year.

The $4400 raised last year was
used in hospitals in Korea, for the
use of Korean civilian amputees
in the war.

This year the project is closer
home, in Davidson to be exact. The
plans are now to move the present
YMCA hut, because they don't own
the land it is on now. The idea is
to fix up the hut, by means of
roofing, fixing the windows, heat-
ing, and plumbing. The cost of
this will be approximately $2,200,
said Profesosr Bevan in an address
to the student hody yesterday
morning.

He went on to say that play-
ground and shop equipment are
needed. They also want to put
a television set in the remodeled
building. Supervisors are needed
for the project, along with a
nursery to keep the children off
the streets. A place for dancing
is needed also.

In his addross, Professor Bevan

On December 17, the freshman and

- The freshman team this year has
been working hard along with the
varsity and should develop into
some of the top wrestlers in fu-
ture years with a couple of year’s
experience. Leading candidates for
the freshman team are: Sonny Kin-
cey in the 157 class, David Brown,
Johnny Grey and Joe ‘Whitesell.

told of two similar projects that
he knows of that worked remark-
ably well, with even less to work
with than our student body.

Luckily the juvenile delinquency
problem is not bad, due to the ef-
forts of such men as ex-mayor
Beaty and the present mayor, Mr.
Jackson. But that doesn’t mean
that it can not become bad.

The YMCA is concerned mostly
with the children as they are our
future citizens. A worthier cause
couldn’t have been chosen. It is
natural to be a little resentful at
being asked to contribute to some-
thing else, as we are always being
asked to give to this and that. But
most of our past giving were most
probably intangible, used for proj-
ects that we never saw, or never
will see. But this one is real. It is
right at our back door, so to speak.

Let's make it a great success.

Having signed his name until
his hand was weary, Laughton sum-
moned his “Imperial Scarf-Ar-

been called, and boomingly
ordered, “Get me out of here,” so

Laughton departed from David-

The Y.M.C.A. Negro Recreation
Hut, which was chosen by the stu-
dent body as the project for this
year’s annual Gift Fund, was built
back in the days prior to World
War II by the Davidson College
Y.M.C.A. Its original purpose was
specified as a recreational center
for the Negro population of the
community.

Before the war, interest among
the Negro citizens ran high and
Mr. Lester Hunsucker was dele-
gated by the W.P.A. to direct a
planned recreational program for
the local colored groups.

Just when it appeared that the
Hut was beginning to fulfill its
real objective in the community,
the war descended, bringing with
it to Davidson the overcrowded
schools and impaired educational
facilities which were typical of the
country in general.

As the war progressed, the local
Negro school found itself in dire
need of additional cafeteria and
classroom space. The Y.M.C.A. rec-
ognized this need and granted the
school permission to use the Hut.
In serving this objective, however,
the original purpose of the Hut was
lost.

Soon after the war’s conclusion,
a new Negro school was con-
structed and the “Y” Hut was no
longer needed as classroom space.
The Y.M.C.A. then endeavored to
reestablish it as a center of recrea-
tion, but as would be expected, the
years of hard use, both before and
during the war had taken their toll
on the little frame building.

At present, the Hut is used by
Negro clubs, lodges and various
other organizations. Its operation
is supervised by a committee of
Negro citizens, but this group is
sorely handicapped by its lack of
funds necessary for the desperate-
ly needed improvements.

Now, Mecklenburg County has
requested that the Hut be removed
from the county-owned school
grounds in the immediate future.
As yet, no suitable location has
been secured and it now appears
that a temporary lot will necessari-
ly be purchased until a permanent
site can be obtained.

lowers as well. The defeatest attitude toward athletics which
naturally pervades the student body reaches into every phase
of student activity on the campus, makes cynics of those who
will no longer torture themselves with any vain hope, and
makes the mere mention of the word school spirit, as the
typical student thinks of it, a hollow mockery indeed. David-
son and defeat have become synonymous.

It may make littlé difference to some of the students
and-faculty whether we never win another major sport victory,
or whether we even compete with other schools. But to the
majority of college students intellectual life and development
alone offer barren prospects indeed. Most of us look on inter-
collegiate athletics as an indispensable part of college life,
regardless of what they may think about them at Oxford or

the University of Chicago.

We do not ask championship teams, we no longer even
ask for an even break. We just want to win enough to be able
to go to our home towns, hold up our heads, tell people we
are from Davidson, and not feel like crawling under the table.
We know that a school’s record on the field of play is no in-
dication of the job it is doing, and bears a secondary relation
to its ultimate aims, but do we have to prove this by setting
up conditions so that we make the most dismal of athletic

showings before the public.

There is no easy way out for Davidson. No matter what
steps are taken some people will be dissatisfied. At present,
however, everyone who is remotedly interested must be dis-
gruntied. We want to see our full intercollegiate’ program
maintained at Davidson, but we fear that it will die on the
vine, and that right early, unless leadership asserts itself
from some quarter and positive steps are taken.

place. But about the only time
when fraternity groups can be as-
sembled is on Thursday nights,
and outdoor lighting at night is in-
ferior even with the best equip-
ment. Besides, it would take a
month of Thursdays to shoot all
the groups if equipment had to be
moved from house to house. The
only logical place to shoot the
groups is in the Union ballroom,
where equipment may be set up
permanently and groups moved in

and out rapidly.

Last, and most important of all
for Quips, is the loss of time and
money involved. It would consume
a considerable amount of both to
modify certain agreements which
were made earlier in the semester
with the yearbook engraver and
photographer.

tactics.

But whether or not the reader
agrees with me in my contention
that McCarthy and his methods
represent a grave danger to Ameri-
ca today, the imporant thing is that
we should all at least try to analyze
this issue and what it means to us
as college students today and in-
fluential citizens tomorrow.

With this cooperation, we can
