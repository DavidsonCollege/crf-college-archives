the cast of the production. The David-

Heefner Is Chosen As
Varsity Cheer Leader

New Leader to Take up Duties of
Myers at First Baseball Game
At a meeting of the student body on

Wednesday morning, March 13th, FE. S

Heefner was elected cheer-leader for the

coming year. In this election he defeated

FE. L. Roberson,

ant cheer-leader for this year.

Heefner came to Davidson from Win-
ston-Salem, N. C., and entered the class
of 1930, being now a Junior. He is a
member of the Phi Gamma Delta Social
Fraternity, and is also a member of the
Reporters Club. He was recently taken
into the Delta Pi Kappa Fraternity of
Journalism in which line of work he has
proven himself most efficient.

During the fall of this year Heefner
was elected assistant cheer-leader, as was
Roberson who ran against him in the
recent election. Through his competent
work he has shown his abilities in this
field, and it is expected that he will prove
an able successor to Myers, who held
the office of cheer-leader for this year.

The new cheer-leader will, as usual,
take charge at the first baseball game
which will be played on Friday, March
22. At this time the Sophomores will be-
gin to try out for cheer-leader positions.
They will continue with the competition
through the baseball season and the first
football game next year.’ At this- time
two will be chosen as assistant cheer-lead-
ers.

WADE SMITH GIVES
ILLUSTRATED TALK

Minister’s Lecture on “The
Cross” Made Realistic by
“Little Jets”

Thursday night, March 14, Wade Smith
gave a lecture in Shearer Hall. As he
talked, he illustrated his lecture by means
of drawing pictures on large sheets of
paper.. This added to the interest of the
talk and made it realistic. This lecture
was one of the most inspiring that has
been given this year. Mr. Smith in the
earlier stages of his talk discussed imagi-
nation and its wonderful qualities. Im-
agination, he explained, takes one away
from the troubles of life. God created
man ini bold strokes, and left it up to
him to fill in his life. Imagination is a
great help in this respect.

The main part of the lecture consisted
of an account of the birth of Isaac and
his early life. Rev. Smith carried his
audience from the praying of Abraham
and Sarah for a child to Isaac’s deliv-
erance from the ‘altar onthe mountain
top. He related the story so clearly as
to make it seem as if the scenes which
he was describing were being enacted over
again in the presence of the audience. In
the midst of his account Rev.’ Smith an-

—Baseball Game and State
High Track Meet—“Taming
of the Shrew” in Shearer To-
Night.”

Plans for the Junior Speaking week-
end which begins today call for a varied
and interesting program. Due to com-
plications, the Junior oratorical contest,
about which the week-end originally cen-
tered, has been postponed until Tuesday.
As planned, it was to have been held last
night, but has been put off by the class
officers until Tuesday night.

The outstanding feature of the week-
end will be the “Rainbow Revue,” which
is to be presented by the Junior Class to-
morrow night at 7:30 in Shearer Hall.
This is the attraction which was to be
given last December, and which was post-
poned because of the closing of school
just before Christmas. The ‘Rainbow
Revue” is a snappy and colorful enter-
tainment, with a cast made up of mem-
hers of the Junior Class and twelve of
Statesville’s fairest ladies. The David-
son Jazz Orchestra will also play at that
time. The admission will be fifty cents.

Another entertainment planned by the
Junior Class will be held tomorrow after-
noon, It will be in the form of a picture,
“The Lady of the Pavements,” presented
at the Davidson Theatre at 4:30 o'clock,
The Juniors are giving this as a class
treat, free to all Davidson students and
their girls. A special section of the thea-
tre will be reserved for those with girls.
The film to be shown stars Lupe Velez,
