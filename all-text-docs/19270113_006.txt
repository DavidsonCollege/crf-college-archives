“Y” Column

Literary Societies

At the beginning of this year the “Y”|

| wishes to make for itself a resolution, to be-
| come in every way 4 greater and more help- |
| ful part of the campus life of Davidson. To
do this the “Y” officers wish to invite and
ask the aid and co-operation of the entire
student body, in order to make the coming
months the most successful that the “Y” has
| ever enjoyed. A most commendable and
| profitable phase of work was carried on in
the -vesper services during the fall and early
winter months, and a great part of the suc-
cess of the meetings was due to the wise
selection of speakers and leaders. Carrying
on with these vespers, the “Y” is now trying

Philanthropic

Meeting number 6001 of the Philanthropic |
Thursday |

| Literary Society was held tast
evening, January 6th, in Phi Hall. Crinkley
| opened the meeting with devotionals, after

| which First Critic Davis announced the five |
two of

| following extemporaneous debates,
which to be chosen for the evening.

“Resolved, That married men make better
husbands than single men.” ‘Resolved, That
the three literary societies on the Hill should
be formed into two.” “Resolved, That mar-
riages are causes for all divorces.” ‘‘Resolv-
ed, That dancing is more beneficial than skat-
ing,” and “Resolved, That Santa Claus comes
down the chimney.” The latter two were

to bring some of the best-known speakers in
the state and the South, to lead during the |
spring months. Among those who will prob- |
ably be here are Josephus Daniels, Mrs. Dan-
iels; Bishop Mikell, of Atlanta; Hon. Max |
O., Gardner and Hon. Clyde R. Hoey, both of
Shelby, N. C.; Judge T. B. Finley, and oth-
ers. In view of such excellent leaders the
|“Y” €an expect a most enjoyable spring cam-

| | paign.

Y—

The “Y” plans to have a check tournament,
| preceding and during exams, the winner of
| which will be given a prize consisting of a
| certain number of free admissions to the
pve movies. The games will all be played
jin the “Y” rooms, which provide a “very
comfortable place for such contests.

Y
Next Sunday Union Theological Seminary
will have charge of the “Y” service, bringing
no doubt a special quartet and other features
that will make a worth-while program. Any-
body who wishes to have interviews may see
any member of the group.

An exhibit of Union is now being shown
at the “Y”, including pictures of the buildings
and faculty of the institution.

YY.
Harry Goodykoontz went as Davidson's
representative to the Student National Con-
ference, held: at Milwaukee, from December
28th to January Ist. Harry reports a won-
derful and inspiring conference from which
many new and helpful ideas were to be
gained.

\\ snc
In the early spring the “Y” hopes to put
on what will be an entirely new thing in the
South. This will be a Vocational Guidance
(Institute, at which leaders in particular pro-
fesions will address and advise men about
choosing their profession, giving expert ad-
vice to the real facts about their own. Da-
vidson “Y” hopes to set a precedent that will
be a beneficial one, and one that will thrive in
other years.

“THEY SHALL NOT PASS”

(Continued from page 4)

And then there is the other side of the
question to be considered—the bill itself.
Members of the council readily admit |
that there is a feeling of hostility toward |
them in the student body. The student |
body is assured, at the present time, how-
ever, that in the final analysis the power
is theirs if occasion shall so demand its
employment,

no such

feeling. Regardless of the
opinion of the student body conéerning
a matter, they as a student body will have
nothing to say concerning the question.
Nothing can go further than the senior

| court,
| :
that there has been an error in the de-

Under the proposed plan there will be |

| accepted by the society.

Crinkley upheld the affirmative of the

as to whether they will admit it to the
student body.

But that is far from the question. When
one appeals a case it is with the thought
that the higher court is a more capable
but it is through the contention

cision of the first court. Thinking that
there was an error it would be absurd to
ask the same court to find or admit that
error, so the accused man must appeal to
another and higher court.

At Davidson that court has for years
been the student body. For years sopho-
mores, juniors, and seniors have voted,
with the addition of the freshmen after
their January elections. . For years the
members of these classes have all been

considered competent to act as a final}

court,

My opinion is that such should remain |

the case at Davidson, and, if the faculty

demands that we meet at night; then let}

us meet at night rather than yield to this
encroachment upon the rights of the stu-
dent body.

The Pandeinic Literary Society held its
| first regular meeting after the holidays on
Thursday night, January 6th, in. their hall,
with a very good attendance. After the
meeting was called to order Bailey conducted
| the devotional exercises, offering prayer and
reading Proverbs 4. New business was then
entered into, during which it was decided to
| have a feed the first meeting after examina-

was then-taken up with the election of offi-
cers to Serve the second semester. Nominees
and elect are as follows:
