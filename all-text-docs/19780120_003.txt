The Patterson Court Coun-
cil has met and made plans for
self-selection 1978, but the
Advisory Council on Campus
and Religious Life (CCRL) has
yet to make its recommenda-
tion. x

The CCRL Subcommittee
on Patterson Court spent
some time last term examining
suggested changes in the self-
selection system. Professor of
Chemistry Felix A. Carroll,
who is chairman of the sub-
committee, presented propo-
sals at two different meetings
of the CCRL.

At isSue were a computer-
based system that would have
allowed students to rank their
house preferences and a dual
system distinguishing
between fraternity and eating
clubs. All proposals were re-

jected by the CCRL, and
Carroll said he could not
justify spending more time on
the subject.

Since that time, CCRL
chairmain Will H. Terry
planned to work out a compro-
mise proposal during Christ-
mas break, but his efforts were
delayed by illness. A proposal
will be presented Monday,|
January 23 to the CCRL.

The PCC which met Janu-
ary 11 adopted a plan similar
to last year. The council,
which is composed of repre-
sentatives from the Patterson
Court houses, set February 16
as self-selection night. With
up to six people in a row, each
row will be called by lottery to
leave Love Auditorium. In the

first-come basis.

The PCC will try to correct
last year’s problem of calling

Contribution worth $1 million

Davidson receives

By LYNN PEACE
Staff Writer

Davidson College President
Samuel R. Spencer announced
this week that the college has
been given an 860-acre tract
near Raleigh. The land is
valued at more than $1 million
and is the largest “deferred
gift’’ in the College’s history.

The contribution was made.
by Patrick Dowd Gray and his
sister Mary Alice Gray. Nei-
ther had any previous ties
with Davidson.

Part of the gift will be
restricted to providing the
Grays with a fixed income for
the rest of their lives. After all
costs are met, the college
expects to net more than half a
million dollars.

Director of special resources
Julius Melton said that Da-

vidson and several other pri- -
vate North Carolina~ cuileges «

were given the opportunity to

discuss the possible gift with
the Grays’ attorneys.

Melton explained to the
Grays the ‘detailed particular
philanthropic opportunities in
Davidson's 1987 Program
(which aims to raise $35
million by our 150th anniver-
sary.(’’ The Grays decided,
after careful consideration to
donate the land to Davidson,
and will select some aspect of
the 1987 Program to memoral-
ize their ancestors.

The Grays wrote, ‘It will be
a great satisfaction for us to
feekthat we had a little part in
helping Davidson College pro-
vide facilities to allow more
students to receive a higher
education.’

Melton's experience and
professional approach to de-
ferred giving are credited as
the-ckey.reasons for the Gray's

The issue of waiting lists
and whether upperclalssmen
will have preference over
freshmen has still to be deter-
mined:

According to PCC presi-
dent, Kathryn Bridges, self-
selection is ‘“‘simply a matter
of luck. They know that it’s
nof the best system; it really i¢
not going to work here.”

She does not believe major
criticism will come until after
the process is completed.

Bridges’ advice to freshmen
about fraternities is, “If you
aren't welcome, don’t try join-
ing.”

She hopes that unfortunate
situations can be avoidéd if
individuals will be sensitive to
how they are received in the
houses.

concluded.

Spencer estimated that,
considering the market, the
land will take between two and
five years to sell. ‘‘When it is
sold and what we have at the
time for projects in progress”
will likely dictate how the
money is used, he explained.

need to purchase the necessary
equipment and Executive Di-
rector of WDAV, Don Lovell,
said, ‘‘We’re assuming we'll
have raised it all by May 1,”
indicating that fund raising
efforts will continue indefi-
nitely.

kovell stated that the facili-
ties need substantial improve-
ments, but the studio is
‘adequate for broadcasting.”

He added that automated
equipment for broadcasting
during summer and holidays is
an option for the future.

WDAV Station Manager
Carrington Thompson was op-
timistic about the financial
outlook basing his optimism
on past experience. He pointed
out that, the College gave the
go-ahead on the construction
of Richardson Dorm and the
library before that money was
entirely raised.

“Orice you've got that much
money raised, you @an be
pretty sure you're goint to get
the rest of it,’’ he remarked.

Spencer added, ‘‘We do a lot
of things of faith. You must
make a judgement somewhere
along the line as to when you
take that leap of faith.”’

He says that the College
feels it has enough money now
to take that leap.

The College has raised a-
bout half of the money needed
to renovate the Marting Sci-
ence Building, which Spencer
likened to the WDAV situa-
tion. Repairs of the building
will begin in the spring.

Costs were cut immensely
by the donation of an antenna
by radio station WLDS.

Transco Oil.Company had
given WDAV a tower earlier.

WDAV'’s construction per-
mit granted by the FCC gives
the station permission to in-
crease to 18,540 watts, but ex-
pires on May 1 unless ade-
quate progress is shown by
that time. Lovell stated, ‘‘We
have made sufficient pro-

If the station does not raise
all of the capital cost of
$70,000 by the May 1 target
date, it can ask for an exten-
sion. There were no indica-
tions that the College would
assume any of the capital
costs in the event that the

DAV

station does not raise the
$70,000 by May 1.

The College will, however,
pay an annual operating cost
of $25,000.

Thompson hopes that the
higher powered station will
bring in more contributions to
the College, but no one is sure
if WDAV. will be able to sup-
port itself. Spencer said the
impact of the station will be
“very hard to measure.”

Lovell agrees that the reac-
tion will be ‘‘virtually non-
measurable.’’He believes that
the service WDAV is provi-
ding is the most important
aspect of the station.

“We're serving a double
purpose,’’ he explained.
taking Davidson to the com-
munity at large and providing
a service; there is no classical
music station in the area.”

Lovell says there will be
enough support for the~sta-
tion, citing Charlotte’s cultu-
ral growth.

Thompson concurred,
“There’s a definite void in
radio programming in the
area. As of right now, the only
classical music you can get is
the UNC station, which signs
on at 3 pm. For jazz, you have
to stay up to 2 am and listen to
WROQ to get it.”

The programming at pre-
sent is about 58 per cent
contemporary music, 31 per
cent classical music, 10 per
cent jazz, as well as folk
music, children’s, and talk

shows. When the station
begins high-power broadcas-
ting, approximately 30 hours
of contemporary programming
will be shifted to educational
and public affairs.

WDAV has_ exclusive
broadcasts of the Metropoli-
tan Opera, the Cleveland Or-
chestra, the Cleveland Pops,
the Boston Symphony, the
Philadelphia Orchesta, the

Chicago Lyric Opera, and the
Chicago Symphony.

Thompson commented,
‘Getting the Metropolitan
Opera id just amazing. Usu-
ally they don’t consider
(granting broadcasting
contracts) until the first of the
season. They took us on in the
middle of the season."’
