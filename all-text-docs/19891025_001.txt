Evaluating Davidson’s semester system:
Does longer really mean better ?

By BETH BROWN

Davidson students are at -

school longer than their peers
at comparable institutions be-
cause of the 15-week semester.
This is only the second year
since the adoption of the new
semester calendar, but many
students and faculty are ready
to see changes made in the
length of the semester.

Randy Nelson, Secretary
of the Executive committee,
explains that the decision to
have a 15-week semester, in-
stead of possibly a 13- or 14-
week one, is the result of “a
bargain not to lose class time,
so that two 15-week semesters
equals three ten-week semes-

ters under the old system.”

This bargain seems to be
too much of a compromise for
some. Charlie Ratliff, professor
of economics, points out that
the number of class meetings
and the number of courses
required for graduation has
been reduced to accommodate
this new calendar. He speaks
fondly of the days when classes
met five days a week, and Sat-
urday mornings were reserved
for seminars.

“Professors had more.

flexibility and more contact
with students under the old
system. My main criticism of
thenew semester systemis that
there is not enough percolation

time.”

Ratliff is not bothered by
the fact that most other schools
have a shorter semester. “I
would think that many parents
at other schools might get up-
set with the amount of money
they spend oncollege forsucha
short semester. I know I’m old
fashioned, but I favor. the
longer semester,” he said.

Professor of political sci-
ence Tom Kazee agrees with
Ratliffin thathe wantsas much
contact time as possible with
students, but he believes that
maximizing contact time must
notbe the only criteria in estab-
lishing a calendar. He said,
“The main goal should be to

Here’s how Davidson’s semester
calendar compares with other
liberal arts schools

The following information was compiled by the SGA from college catalogs:

create an academic environ-
ment conducive to learning,
and | think Davidson would
benefit by reducing the calen-
dar. Obviously, I would like as
much time in class as possible,
but I am sensitive to student
burnout and fatigue at the end
of the semester.”

Although Kazee does not
believe that the length of the
semester is a crucial issue at
this time, he does think thatitis
an appropriate time to analyze
the calendar to determine if a
shorter calendar might help in
accomplishing Davidson's
main goal—establishing. the
best learning environment.

__ Speaking on behalf of the
student body, SGA President
Tripp Helms said, “There is no
doubt in my mind that
Davidson students would like
a’ shorter. semester.” . Helms
says that there are plenty of

problems with the new calen-
dar: “One of the main draw-
backs is that there is not
enough reading time at the end
of the semester. Most schools
have two or three days, or even
a reading week, between the
last day of classes and exams,
but Davidson students are only
given one day.”

The SGA was only con-
sulted formally in determining
the length of the new calendar,
but a committee of senators is
currently working on a pro-
posal to submit to the educa-
tion policy committee.

They are looking at alter-
native calendars of 13, 13 1/2
and 14 wecks. .

Recently, the faculty did
make one change toshorten the
calendar. The 1991-1992 calen-

Governor of West Virginia Gaston Caperton challenged
seniors to “be the hands” and take action when he
spoke at convocation last Saturday. The phrase was a
reference to the advice of a minister to the people in his
small town when they could not find the hands to the
statue, of Jesuswhich they were rebuilding.
