The science major would have
no trouble taking the humani-

but would not be able to take
six hours of humanities, a lan-
guage, two science courses and
ROTC during either semester of
his sophomore year. The only
alternative seems to be to put
off the humanities until the jun.
ior year.

COMMITTEE WON'T SAY

“The Curriculum Committee
was unwilling to say anything
about putting off the second
part of the program until the
junior year,” Johnston said.
“There are a good many details
that we haven't ironed out yet
and this is one of them.”

Johnston, dean of faculty and
chairman of the Curriculum
Committee, said that the pro-
gram would be open to 80-90
freshmen in the fall of 1962.
The course is voluntary for both
students and instructors. Fur-
thermore, a student may drop
out of the program after the
first year and probably still re-
tain the full 12 hours credit.

SIX-MAN TEAM

Six professors wil conduct the
program. These six will likely
be selected from a sizeable
group of volunteers next week.
During the summer they will
make an intensive eight-weeks
Study in the areas included in
the program: chiefly philosophy,
religion, history. and the arts.

The course will meet every
day — sometimes in full lecture
group, other times in informal
discussion greups of about 15
students each. Each of the six
professors wil have his own
small group with which he will
work for the entire year.

prenticeship of the Wall Street |

of this year’s Scripts ‘n Pranks |
staff as well as Sigma Upsilon
and Eumenean Literary Society.

Jackson. Jackson won over Bill
Pruitt by a vote of 233 to 142.

Abernethy has been activities
editor on the annual and has al-

ORAL PRESENTATION

Johnston also said that they
would emphasize oral presenta-
tion in the small groups. The
student may or may not have
time to prepare what he is go-
ing to say. “We anticipate a
good bit of student participa-
tion,” he commented. “We hope
that the lectures can tie toge-
ther what is discussed in the
small groups.”

The integrated humanities
program has been under consid-
eration by Davidson College pro-
fessors for nearly two years.

“This is not a new idea in col-
lege education,” Johnston said.
“We first became interested in

More To Davidson
Than Meets The Eye

Davidson is not only a place of books, students, and
a road to Charlotte, but it also contains a population
(2500 resident) and a fertilizer plant (also resident). As-
suming that there was more to Davidson than meets the
eye, THE DAVIDSONIAN questioned Mayor F. L. (Cash)
Jackson about his town and also about the relations of
the college to the community.

“If you speak of the rela- shingles and siding and/sells
tion between the college and the _ its products in Canada and the
town, they are one,” quipped United States.
