DAVIDSON TENNIS TEAM IN
MEET AT GREENSBORO

The Tennis Team, composed of Staley,
Price, Beall and Trotter left Tuesday,
for Greensboro, where they will engage
in the State tournament. In the tourna-
ment there last year, the Wildcats came
off with flying colors. Bradley, last
year’s captain, won the singles cham-
pionship. The doubles team reached the
finals but was defeated by Carolina.

The prospects for repeating that per-
formance are not so bright but the
members of the team are determined to
win. The team will be away for the
next week, meeting Trinity and Caro-
lina during their trip.

Covington Pulls Two Double Plays
as Laird Loses to Wheelerton
Friday

Ater having beaten the strong Tar
Heel team Easter Monday at Gastonia,
the Wildcats were taken from their
pedestal by the Atlantic Christian Col-
lege nine in a slow game played here
Friday afternoon. The Davidson men
were unable to connect with the pill
when hits were most needed. As a re-
sult 11 men were left on bases.

Two chances for victory were lost by.
the Wildcats. In each case the bases
were loaded. But Wheelerton, A. C. C.
twirler, held Davidson scoreless both
times, taking the measure of the
man up for the third out. Only once did
the Wildcats get the score evened with
the Christians—in the fourth, A. C. C.
again took the lead in the fifth and kept
it throughout the remainder of the game.
| Ted Covington made two double plays
} unassisted in one of which he doubled
the runner off first. Reel, for the visitors,
| fot three hits out of four times up. One
;of Davidson's tallies was brought in by
| Sion Alford’s three-bagger.

only two games will remain on the Fresh-
man schedule, the \first with Statesville
High School on May 5th, and the second
with M, P. C. I. on May 6th. Both of
these games will be played on the home
diamond. The game with the M. P. C. I.

tributed his bit toward holding up his
part of Alabama’s reputation. Marion
came here with a two-fold ambition and
as his record will show, he attained great
success in both of his aspirations.

In athletics alone Brice made a record
that would cause him to stand out. On
his arrival here, he immediately took an
interest in football, making the company
team and thereby showing the ability
that is his. Plugging at it he went to
the varsity scrubs his next year and the

gin the last lap of their race for state
