AN APPRECIATION

“Are you musical?”

“No; I neither play nor sing.”

Your answer shows a complete mis-
understanding of the case. Because you
neither play nor sing, it by no means
follows that you are unmusical. If you love
music and appreciate it, you may be more
musical than many pianists or singers;
and certainly you may become so.

—Gustav Kobbe.
_Inability to play or sing is no indica-
tion of being unmusical. If all the great
music in the past had been written mere-
ly for those playing instruments, it is
questionable whether it would have come
down to us today. Certainly that is true
in the case of symphonic music. For it is
safe to say that large group of
musicians would assemble frequently to
hear themselves play. And few composers,
if any, would continue producing just for
musicians and themselves

For whom, then, do they
those who appreciate and
ment follows appreciation,

compose? For
enjoy! Enjoy-
; and apprecia-
tion is the “capacity to understand.” Can
anybody be made to appreciate music, you
ask? Anyone who is not tohe-deat (for
there are tone-deaf people as well as
color-blind) and who is willing to exert
a little patience to learn.

Music cannot be learned all at onée.
And an appreciation of it will not come
from reading books. In general life the
best way to learn is to do, and in music
the best way to learn is to hear. True
books and explanatory notes will greatly
help to elucidate the meaning of a.cer-
tain symphony or opera, as intended by
the composer, but actual appreciation of
the music will come only by hearing it.
Before going further, you interpose, is
it worth while to spend all that time and
patience on something which will not in-
directly increase one’s income in after
life, unless undertaken professionally ?
‘Very much so, is the answer. Men who
are planning to become lawyers, doctors
dentists, teachers, ministers, or figae
whose professions will decide their social
environment, cannot expect to be ac-
cepted in circles where art and literature
are patronized unless they acquaint them-
selves with art and literature. A teacher's
life is among cultured people; a minister
1s expected to show an appreciation of
the aesthetic; doctors, dentists, and law-
yers must have contact with all classes of
people, and it is doubtful that they can
long remain, uncultured themselves and
retain a clientele among the cultured.

But learning music for convenience and
advancement of one’s profession is too
superficial, too unavailing, too distant
, from the purpose of music. And the sight
of @ professional man painfully enduring
a musical to keep up appearances among
a cultured clientele would indeed make a
pathetic picture.

As we have already mentioned, the first
thing for the novice to learn is that music
cannot all be grasped at first hearing, for
which, incidentally,  music-lovers are
thankful. Even trained critics admit be-
wilderment at the first hearing of an un-
familiar piece. Beginners should not be
discouraged, therefore, if first impressions
are not overpowering. For it is the very
fact that music is not so slight as to be
fully comprehended all at once that leaves
so much for subsequent hearings, when
its hidden qualities at length reveal them-
selves.

No doubt many a well-intentioned as-
Pirant, with a perfectly good sense of ap-
preciation, has listened for a few moments
to an involved classic and then exclaimed

.in despair, “The trouble with classical
music is that there is no melody to it!”
What he means to say, however, is that
he doesn’t hear it. Now he may be per-
fectly honest in not being able to detect
the melody, but he should not be so dog-
matic as to assert that there is none, just
because he doesn’t grasp it.

And then this despairing soul will look
for solace in jazz. He is beguiled; for the
quick, syncopated rhythm “catches” him,

Big Five Colleges
Back Student Plan

A movement is under way, sponsered by
the student governments of the so-called
“Big Five” Colleges of the state, Davidson,
N. C. State, North Carolina, Duke and Wake
Forest to bring about the passage of a reso-
lution to the effect that all students of these
colleges be admitted free to athletic con-
tests played between the teams of these in-
stitutions. The plan had its origin only a
few weeks ago, and nothing of a definite
nature has been accomplished as yet. A con-
vention was called to meet at Duke Univer-
sity the latter part of this month to con-
sider the matter, but very little definite in-
formation is available as to any action taken,

ABILITY OF GLASGOW

has a great work to do here and that he
will do it.”

Zeb Long, who has been associated with
Doctor Glasgow during the past two sum-
mers in his summer conference work on the
Davidson Campus gives the following state-
ment: "

“For the past two summers I have heard
Dr. Samuel Glasgow entrance the young peo-
ple at the Davidson Conferences with the
greatness of his understanding, the power
of his sermons, and the inspiration of his
personality, I have heard few men with so
eloquent an appeal to the young man, few
men with such consecration to their work,
few men with so great a heart to work for
the Master. His coming to Davidson will be
a great event for the college—a great event
for the advancement of a vital religious spirit
among the students. Every man who hears
him will go away convinced that something
worthwhile and uplifting awaits him through
contact with Doctor Glasgow.”

the melody is attractive, and the selection
is short. Woe to jazz music if its selec-
tions were as long as classical! If they
were, how long do you suppose people
would be fascinated? Indeed George
Gerschwin wrote his “Rhapsody in Blue”
of symphonic length, but he was obliged
to employ what is referred to as “classi-
cal jazz.”

Mind, we do not seek to disparage jazz
and its purpose, for we believe it has its
place as well as classical (for who can
deny the efficacy of the Sunnyland Sere-
naders?); but we are trying to show that
people can derive more pleasure from
classical than from jazz music, if they
will investigate each fairly.

The trouble with the aforementioned
despairing soul is not his lack of capacity
to receive classical music unto himself,
but an apparent inability to sit for a long
period of time and use his mind intellect-
ually. This identical soul avoids all art as
he does music. But if he would control his
patience ahd resolves to give music (and
art) a fair chance to speak for itself, he
could soon be brought to alter his opinions.

One who is brought up in a family
where there is music is fortunate indeed,
for he is imbued with an appreciation of
it. On the other hand, he who has not had
the advantages of musical training, must
awaken and develop his taste. Attending
concerts, will, of course, help him to do
this; but better and more convenient,
victrola records are worthy |instructors,
for they can be repeated as often as de-
sired, and the music will therefore leave
a sharper impress on his mind.

He should begin with the simpler and
less-involved compositions. In due time he
will’ realize that longer and intricate
works are not jejune, as he at first though,
but. expressive and purposeful. Having
reached this stage, he ison the right road,

and needs but to hear more music.

town? The girls would have to walk to
the college through inclies of mud and
slush, with which the streets of Davidson
are well equipped. If we must have co-
education let it be when the school
moved to a larger town. Davidson College
needs co-education, Let us
build up the school and then speak on
such matters.” That another had realized
early the great truth—that it takes money

Up to the library and am elated at the
discovery of a name for the “cold stone”
on that pedestal in the hall. It isa bust of
Dante and was presented to the College
by Dr. Martin, who procured it while
touring in Italy.

Satan’s domains seem always to flash
before my mind at the slightest oppor-
tunity. I like Dante’s Inferno and prefer
Milton’s sketch of the Devil to anything
in literature. Of course it is irrelevant but
when I see that in 1925 the seniors chose
blue blazers for their garb .
you blame me?

And so while on the subjegt of fire I
might mention another one back in 1925
(a hot year it would seem!) when a serv-
ant house in the rear of the library belched
up smoke. Of course the army jumped to
the rescue and made a name for itself.
One modest Admiral put finishing touches
on the incident by dragging out a 1i’l
choclit drop almost as black as himself.

Am minded to leave you with the fol-
lowing extract:

“Tf you've anything good to say of a man,
Don't wait till he’s laid to rest,
For the eulogy spoken when hearts are
broken
Is an empty thing at best.”

It is a trite little thought but always
seems to be good for a quiescent lecture.
There are so many men who only know
the good in themselves after they have
read it on the tombstone. Don’t be like
the son-in-law of Rhompsinitus and give
each fellow a rancid bone. Give him a
large, rare bit of kindness and watch the
miracle evolve.

Down to Eumanean Hall and am over-
whelmed by the idea that only once in a
century is a crowd gathered there with-
out speech making. In 1916 Woodrow Wil-
son came to the college and was con-
ducted around the campus. He went to
the hall and upon being asked to make a
speech refused, saying, “I was just con-
fessing to Dr. Martin that this is one
place in which I cannot make a talk. I
have tried here before.”

Back home only to be reminded again
of Wilson and his career. In the fall term
his average at Davidson was 87.67; in the
spring it was 93.42, Such an*increase in
grades may not be prophetic but to me
it signifies his whole life; ever and stead-
ily increasing in power. He ended well
each job that he undertook. Let that be
said of any man and he will need no high-
er tribute,

Thinking of an old song: “Where has
my old gang gone?” and am minded to
paraphrase it; “Where have the old days
gone?” In March, 1890, the college de-
creed that the Saturday before Easter
would be observed as a holiday and bear

the name of Maxwell Chambers’ Day.

.. Well, can,

more than likely be glad to lend her aid if
the movement gains impetus enough to get
the students aroused. It seems unlikely that
definite action can be taken this fall. Most
of the efforts now will be devoted to the
creation of favorable sentiment in athletic
councils of the various colleges, since it is
these bodies which must take final action.
The students will probably back any such
movement to the limit.
