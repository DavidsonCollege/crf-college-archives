“Tempus fugit,” said Cicero. (?)
“The lost weekend,” said Coach Scott.

Both profundities describe the Cat-Furman melee in
Greenville last Saturday night.

Furman, holding a narrow lead, went into a deep

freeze with seven minutes left, but a few surprisingly
short moments later the score board clock showed 2:47
remaining in the game.

The announcer stopped play and questioned the
time. (One of the two clocks, resembling those in the
Charlotte Coliseum, had conked out early in the sec-
ond half.)

A long controversy ensued. The’ timer, a local pro-

duct, said he hadn’t noticed anything peculiar.

The Furman coach, Lyles Alley, naturally had de-
tected no defect.

And surprisingly enough, the announcer, good Bap-
tist that he was, suddenly changed his mind. So the
time on the board stood as official.

Several persons including a Furman official com-.
mented later that the clock had jumped about three
minutes. This seemed to be the general opinion of the
fans.

Mechanical difficulties were not over, however, de-
spite the bevy of electricians that had been scurrying
around all night long.

The referee finally decided that the ball game would
be over when the remaining working clock read 19:00.
But when the clock reached 19:01 it skipped to 17:00.

The Furman players decided that was it and
walked off the court quite happy with a 68-64 win.

Technically, by Davidson logic anyway, the game is
not over. It would take 18 minutes for the clock to get
back to 19:00.

Back to Greenville!

The Interfraternity basketball league, if interest
means anything, is the best intramural sporting event of
the year.

The evenness of the teams this year has increased
the interest to a higher pitch than usual.

However, without adequate refereeing, because
of the race horse tactics employed, the league will
turn into a free-for-all.

As usual there have been some excellently called
ball games, but some have gotten completly out of hand.
The referees, not being strict enough at the beginning
of the game, appear afraid to start calling the increas-
ing number of fouls that come as the game degenerates.

Davidson Wrestlers Mee
Citadel On Home Mat

Tomorrow afternoon in John-
ston Gymnasium, the Wildcat
grapplers will be seeking their
second win of the season when
they entertain the Citadel team.
Coach Parker will probably
stick his usual lineup Carrol
Pitts, Dave Irvin, Waller Tay-
lor, Milton Gee, John Poindex-
ter, “Westy” Westervelt, Jim
Alien, and Alex Porter into ac-
tion against the Bulldogs.

After an impressive opening
against Pfeiffer, in which the
Wildcats took seven out of, eight
matches, Davidson dropped its
last two encounters against
two Atlantic Coast Conference
opponents.

In the last match before the
Christmas holidays, the Caro-

“WESTY” STALLED

In what was perhaps, the fea-
ture match of the evening, un-
defeated “Westy” Westervelt
was succes<fully stalled by his
opponent’s defense in a con-
test which finally ended in a
draw. As time ran out, Wester-
velt was goin all out in an cf-
fort to take h.s opponent down,
but was eluded until the buz-
zer sounded.

Experience, or lack of it,
seems to have been a deciding
factor in both the State and
Carolina matches, The local
team fared a little better
against Carolina as Gee, West-
ervelt, and Porter won their
respective classes.

CITADEL MATCH

The Citadel encounter will
be the final one of the semester
as exams call a halt to athletic
activities until classes resume
again. The next match will be
on Feb. 3 when the team will
travel to Misenheimer for a

return encounter with Pfeiffer.
Five more matches will follow
before the journey to Charles-
ton, S. C., for the conference
meet on March 6, 7.
