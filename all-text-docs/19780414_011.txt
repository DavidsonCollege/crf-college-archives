Big Little Bash i is enormous SuCCess

By BILL BARNETT
Senior Editor

Many people have played very
important roles in the developement of
Davidson College without recieving
any recognition from its students,
much less a five course dinner with
wine and champagne. John Belk has
never had a dinner in his honor.

Maxwell Chambers had a building
named in his honor, but he was never
given a dinner. Will Terry, Davidson’s
only living legend, has” never been
given a dinner.

E.H. Little, though, has been given
a dinner, and what a dinner it was. Not
a person in the audience would have
guessed it had been prepared by
A.R.A. Slater if Ron Scott had not
been seen pouring Mr. Little’s wine.

The dinner honoring Little was the
culmination of a day long birthday
party given for him by the students of
Davidson.Tim Goodell and Lee Raney

were the two chairmen, but they were
very ably assisted by a whole host of
others. : *
The birthday celebration began at
1:45 Monday afternoon. Little was
driven over the Richardson Plaza where
he was given a standing ovation by a
large crowd of both faculty and
students. The Davidson Pep Band

played several appropriate songs dur-
ing Mr. Little’s drive to the stage,
lending a festive air to the event.

Little was assisted to the stage by
Miss Raney. He was seated between
Bruce Brown, the new SGA President,
and Samuel R. Spencer, the president
of the college.

David Barnard introduced Little,
who gave a short speech thanking all
the students for helping him celebrate
his birthday. After the speeches Brown
and Spencer also gave short speeches.
The Pep Band released a big bunch of
gaily colored balloons. Mr. Little then
took a short ride around the Plaza in a
horse and buggy to commemorate his
beginnings as a soap salesman in
Mecklenburg County .

Following his buggy ride, Little
stood in the foyer of the library and
shook hands with everyone who came

by. The reception line’ streamed past a

reputed to be the largest of its kind in
history.

Little, amazingly vigorous for a man
of his age, spent the afternoon sight-

change inside so he would be able to
leave a tip.

The Little Women then led off a
procession of student “‘talent’’ includ-
ing the Lamplighters, the comedy
team of Tom Bessellieu and John
Monroe, and a skit featuring Dr.
Leland Park and Cranston Snord, a
local library rat. Just as the audience
was about to doze off, Shirk recaptured
the mike and gave everyone a much-
needed two minute stretch.

Finally, Little got up to say a few
words. His short speech proved to be
the highlight of the night. Little told
several jokes which had the audience

laughing with glee.

He related one story about a time in
his youth when he made a half-blind
Presbyterian minister leap-frog almost
one and a half miles to his uncle’s house
by telling him there were gulleys in the
road every quarter mile or so. Little’s
father had promptly worn him out with
a switch when he heard of this practical
joke.

After Little’s speech and one last
rendition of ‘‘Happy Birthday,” the
party broke up. There is no doubt,
though, that Little and everyone else in
attendance will remember it for a long
time.
