Dr. Oren Moore Talks of
Service in His Address
at Sunday Vesper Service

Dr. Oren Moore, prominent Charlotte
physician, delivered a stirring address last
Sunday evening at the “Y” vesper servi¢e on
the subject of Service. Dr. Moore is an
alumnus of Davidson and expressed his ap-
preciation for the opportunity of speaking te
the students.

He began with the story of a traveller,
who stopped at a wayside inn and was so
pleased with his surroundings that he forgot
his journey and remained at the inn. A cer-
tain one came to him, saying, “Thou, oh
man, hast forgotten thy objective; thy jour-
ney was not to the inn, but through the inn.”

Dr. Moore stated that we are on our
journey and at this stage of it we are trying
to. get an education. All outside activities
are! merely inns, where we may stop for a
while. The real objective is to get an edu-
cation for a particular thing, and that par-
ticular thing is service. “The main issue of

life,” said the speaker, “is service ; service for
men individually and in groups; service to|
humanity and to God.” |

He continued by asking if there is a need |
for service in the world. Every day the cry
comes to us that the world needs something, |
“The need of the world,” he said, “is for |
Christlike service. Christlike service is that |
which is unselfish, unmindful of reward and |
graciously given.’

Speaking from the viewpoint of his pro-|
fession, Dr. Moore said he had better hold a!
diagnostic clinic of the world in order to|
find its disease, then the cure could be pre-|
scribed. Among the ills in the world he said |
that in the post-war period our moral and |
spiritual fibre has been disrupted and we are |
suffering from the spiritual ills that accom- |
pany post-war periods, |

Another ill he compared to the African |
sleeping sickness, this being the man who is
ignorant; who takes no part in community
life and who has for his slogan “What was |
good enough for my father sis good enough
for me.” |

The third ill he likened to a cancer, which
starts on the inside and once started the
patient goes quickly. This type of ill in the
world is the lust for power and the greed so
predominant in political life today. |

“With these few instances, Dr.

The nineteen-twenty-five Quips and Cranks
is fast rounding into shape, and from all in-
dications it will be a big success, even great-
er than those of past years, both from
financial and from a literary standpoint.

All through the examinations the work of
securing ads for the book has been going
forward, and the results have been most’ en-|
couraging. Manager Milhous is enti |
every effort to bring this year’s annual to|
the point where it will pay for itself, and
leave it to his successor free of debt.

This year’s annual contains many new
features. The first to attract the attention
is a new cover design. The proof for this
has come back and it offers a big improve-
ment over the one of previous years. The
annual is to be divided into four books, the
first to be devoted to the Administration, the,
second to Classes, the third to Beauty, and
the fourth to Activities.

The administration section is to include the

Wildcat Baseball

Team Goes Against
Best of the State

The 1925 baseball schedule has just been
completed with a total of 16 games. Six
North Carolina colleges are included in this
schodule, the University of North Carolina,
North Carolina State College, Duke Uni-
versity, Wake Forest, Guilford College, and
Elon College.

The Wildcats will not invade South Caro-
lina as they did last season but will take a
seven-day trip into Virginia, playing Roan-
oke College, V. M. I., V. P. I, and Wash-
ington and Lee. Six of- the 16 games will
be played at Davidson and two at Gastonia,
so that the students will be able to see cight
games or half of those scheduled.

Two games with Oak Ridge Institute on
the 27th and 28th of March will usher in the
season, These games have always been
hotly contested and last year resulted in one
victory for Davidson and a tie. Following
these games N, C. State and Elon will invade
Richardson field on May Ist and 3rd re-
spectively. Games with N. C. State at
Wake Forest at Wake Forest,
University of N. C. at Gastonia, and Duke
lat Greensboro will come between the next
home contest, which will be with Guilford,

Both teams will be three
regular debaters each, and something unusual
is to be tried in the way of preliminaries,
in an effort to pick the six best speakers in
the student body, With this end in view, the
preliminaries will be held on the night of

However, even this would be preferable to
other than the best six men being chosen to
represent the college in these two contests.

It is to be understood that anw man can
study up on either of the queries, and make
his preliminary speech on whichever one he
chooses, and the six men who show up best
on the 3rd will compose the two teams. All
men thinking of going out are asked to hand
