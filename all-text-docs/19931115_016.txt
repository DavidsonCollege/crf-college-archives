“There are a lot of growing
pains in that,” Blake said, “but its

San Diego (13-6) good to see that improvement to

finish off the year.”

UCLA (18-2) A few weeks ago, Blake insti-

tuted a large shift in the team’s

Fresno State (12-4-3) “We were relying on one or

ball more evenly. And I’ve been

Santa Clara (14-22) pleased with how we’ ve adjusted.”

Kukoc, then Jamal Mashburn of
the Dallas Mavericks.

The Charlotte Hornets have
looked as good as they were pre-.
dicted, sometimes. They still need
to win the close ones versus the
best teams. It looks like the year of
