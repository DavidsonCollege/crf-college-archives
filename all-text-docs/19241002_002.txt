Head Men

Track practice has gotten under way and
an enthusiastic bunch of 25 or 30 men are

nary workouts. Bad weather is detaining the
progress of the squad and nothing definite
can be said as to their strength. The gym-
nasium is being used for indoor practice and
the boys will all be in form when the weath-
er opens up so that they can hit the cinders.

There are only four letter men back this
year but a goodly number of upper-classmen
are out to help fill in the gaps. There are
many aspirant Freshmen out who are show-
ing up well in the dashes, high jumps,
hurdles, javelin throws, etc. A better idea
of their ability will be determined as fall
practice goes on,

Gudger, Webb, McConnell and Williford
are strong contenders gforthe cross-country
teams. Others are showing that they have
something to say about it and it is unknown
who will represent Davidson at Chapel Hill
or Raleigh this fall.

Arrangements are being made for meets
next spring by Manager Jim Patton, who is
dickering with Trinity, Wake Forest, Roan-
oke, V. P. I. and University of South Caro-
lina for meets. This will give the team
plenty to work for, having five meets be-
sides the state meet.

Line-up Against Monroe Highs for
Initial Contest of Heavy Schedule
—Prospect Pleasing

Coach Clarence Rawson will send his
Freshman team against the strong Monroe
High School team tomorrow for the initial
contest of the Davidson Yearling schedule
for 1924. After about four weeks of prac-
tice the Freshman squad is gradually taking
the form of a first-class fighting machine.
The schedule for 1924 is almost identically
the same as that of the past season, except
that a game here with Furman has been sub-
stituted for the game with the University of
South Carolina first year men, The Furman
rats are the only yearlings that will invade
Davidson this autumn, Other games sched-
uled for the Davidson Wildkittens are:  P.
C, Freshmen, at Rock Hill, S. C.; N. C.
State Freshmen, at Pinehurst; Clemson
Freshmen, at Greenville, S. C.; and a game
Armistice Day with the Oak Ridge
team, at Statesville.

Last year the Fresh.squad opened the sea-
son with a 7-0 victory over Charlotte Highs,
who later became state champions. Satur-
day the Monroe aggregation was defeated by
the Charlotte boys 13-0. The game will be
played in Monroe, Friday. Monroe will no
doubt be greatly improved by then and the
Freshmen will have a good fight for an
opener of their hard schedule.

The Freshmen are to date divided into
two squads, Coach Rawson having charge of
the first of about 22 men, while Van Sant,
former North Carolina State player,
coaching the second squad of about 35 men.

The material is slightly better than that
of last season and much heavier. Several
all-state ‘men of the different Southern States
are among the bunch, Due to the scarcity
of dry land during the past week the squad
has been unable to do much effective work
and a “line” on the team is a fairly indefinite
matter. Melton and Richie on the line along
with Grey, Wilson, Nesbit, McMillan and
Harrison in the backfield are showing the
greatest Porm. :

Following is the probable line-up of the
two teams that will meet Friday. Davidson
names are followed bytheir former homes.
