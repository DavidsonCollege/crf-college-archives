Wednesday, the Deering-Milliken
Company of Greenville, S. C., will
hold a group interview at 8:45
a. m., in Room 108, Chambers, Dil

on openings, available with that
firm,

and field work, and underwriting
Thursday. No group interview will
be held.

A four-point program to revise
the electoral system was the re-
port which the appointed committee
on election revision brought. to the
student body this. morning at its
closed meeting.

The ~ revisions’ include these
points: (1) All nominations are to
come from the floor; (2) a fee of
two dollars will be charged for all
nominations; (3) after the first bal-
lot, the five men who receive the
highest number of votes will make
platform speeches; (4) there will
be no signing of the ballots,

' The committee is composed of
the nine members of ODK, Lee
Harter and Bob Crutchfield.

It was announced by Mac Mc.
‘Lean, president of the student
body, that an open meeting of this
committee will. be held Monday
night, Feb. 25, in the Science Audi-
torium.

While Pete Kalogridis spoke as
the general voice of the committee,
Lee Harter gave some of his. per-
sonal views on the needs of the
electoral system.

*. * *

The points of differentation be-
tween the views of Kalogridis and
those held by Harter are ones of
both a philosophical and practical
nature. Kalogridis, expressing the
views of most-of the other mem-
bers of the committee, is not in
favor of a drastic change and looks
for a gradual solution if changes
are to be: made. Harter stands for
a more immediate and comprehen-
sive change in the electoral system
and tends toward the liberal,

On the first point, that of having’
all the nominations come from the
floor, Kalogridis emphasized the
fact that using this method would
eliminate the nominating commit-
tee. He said that this action would
do away with the psychological ad-
vantage that a man got from being
nominated by the committee and
would put all candidates on a more
equal footing. This was general
view of the committee,

At a YMCA retreat held at

chapel to discuss the opinion of
the students in the matter.

The retreat was opened by Presi-
dent Allan Strand, who led a wor-
ship service. Individual reports by
the cabinet members followed in
which each member reviewed the
work done by his committee in light

Tell Trustees
Church Ready
By Graduation

Dedication of Davidson College's
new church is now definitely sched-
uled for the commencement exer-
cises in June, trustees were told at
their meeting here this week.

The baccalaureate sermon will
be on the first of June and will
naturally be attended by a large
number of both parents and alumni,
thus the dedication will be one’
of twofold significance.

At the present time the walls
of the main sanctuary are in
the process of being painted,
while the chapel has been. com-
pleted and most of the educa-
tional building has seen the last
of the painter's brush,

The interior color scheme of the
building calls for a gray-green in
the sanctuary and different colors
in the rooms of the educational
building.

The scheduled contract calls
for completion of the building
itself by the first of March
with the laying of the tiled
flooring to begin immediately.
The organ for the sanctuary has

been completed and Mr. Schlicker
of the Schlicker Organ Company
will come down to personally aid
in the installation, which will prob-
ably take about six wecks.

Furnishings for the entire struc-
ture are now being considered and
a definite selection will be made

in the near future.

Middle East
Is Topic For
Essay Contest

In connection with Dorothy
Thompson's lecture here in March,
the Committee on Public Lectures,
headed by Prof. James Causey, is

‘|. sponsoring a Palestine-Middle East

essay contest,

Entries must be at least 1500
words long, typewritten, and in the
hands of the committee by Wed-
nesday, March 12,

The winner will receive $15.00
or 8 Modern Library Giants,
whichever he prefers,

The essay, of course, must be on
some aspect of the Palestine. Middle
East problem.

Miss Thompson, “the most fa
mous woman journalist in Ameri-
ca,” has recently returned from
a trip to England and the Middle
East to view the situation there.

A similar trip to Germany in
the early ‘30's. brought about
her permanent expulsion by
Hitler.

The Sunshine State will play host

to the Davidson College Male
Chorus for a week, starting next
Wednesday, February 27. The
thirty-voice group, which began as
an amateur octette some fifty years
ago, departs on its annual spring
tour after several weeks of highly
concentrated work in an effort to
polish up the difficult and varied
repertory it will present in concert
form,

The chorus has enjoyed enthusi-
astic acclaim from concerts
throughout the Southeast and East
and from a number of radio per-
formances, including coast to coast
broadcasts over both the NBC and
CBS networks, :

Seldom Happens

It has performed in principal
cities from New York to Florida;
a concert on a recent southern tour
prompted the Florida Times-
Union to comment, “Seldom does
an audience have the privilege of
hearing as magnificent a concert
as the one given last evening.”

“The voices of the chorus were
mature and resonant, excellent in
ensemble, with fortes brilliant and
pianissimos solidly fragile and vi-
brantly effective.”

A native of Jefferson, Maryland,
Plott came to Davidson from the
directorship of music in the Ann
Arbor,. Michigan, and Owosso,
Michigan, high schools.

_ He ‘holds a master’s degree in
music from the famed University of
Michigan's School of Music, where
he was also soloist and student di-
rector of the men's glee club and
assistant director of the Michigan
choir for two years.

Ex-Sailor

He served in the United States
Navy for thirty-cight months, re-
ceiving his discharge in December

The itinerary for the singers has
been set and seven concerts are at
present scheduled. On the firet day
they journey nearly four hundred
miles, the biggest single jump in
their tour, to present an evening
concert in the First Presbyterian
Church of Waycross, Georgia.

On February 28th, they will be
heard. in the City Auditorium at
Ocala, Florida; at the First Pres-
byterian Church in Tampa on the

Mostly Sacred Numbers

With the exception of the con-
certs at Ocala, Fla., and Williston,
S. C., the chorus will present a
program composed entirely of
sacred music; this program will be
approximately the same in each
instance.

It opens with the magnificence of
the Ninety-sixth Psalm set to
music by Croce in his “Cantate
Domino"—"O sing unto the Lord
a new song; sing unto the Lord,
all the earth.” Other standouts in
the Latin portion of the program
are “Adoramus Te” by Clement,
one of the most beloved Latin
texts: “Sicut Locutus Est,” from
Bach's Magnificat and a motet for
two choirs by Jacob Handl,
“Repleti Sunt.”

Numbers on the program perhaps
more familiar to Davidson. listeners
will be, “Lo, How a Rose E’er
Blooming,” a perennial favorite by
Praetorius; “Salvation Belongeth to
our God,” a hymn of the Russian
people by Paul Tchesnokov; and a
song from the original Genevan
Psalter, “Turn Back, O Man,” by
Gustav Holst.

The secular programs vary all the
way from the simplicity and poig-
nancy of English ballads such as

“The Banks of Allan Water,” and.

“The Turtle Dove,” to the ridicu-
lous confusion of a corrupted Latin

Because of the present situation,
the court has been the subject: of

The fraternity tfeasurers agreed
that for the amount of house rent

anything is thought too high, some
further services or improvements
should be rendered.

At the meeting the group

shrubs, the construction of
walkways and parking space,
