This Committee.

IS IT SUCCESSFUL? Yes, it is, in a majority of the cases,
The National Interfraternity Conference.

The National Headquarters of every fraternity we have been
The Undergraduate Conference of Interfraternity Council
Fraternity men all over the country.

The Davidson Administration.
The Davidson Faculty Committee on Fraternities.

E. Is it more in keeping with the aims of fraternities in general

than the old-fashioned Hell Week?

To our minds ... yes. At the University of North Carolina, their
Interfraternity Council called Hell Week .. . “a direct violation of the
campus code, adolescent and a waste of time.” The Carolina fraternity
presidents voted unanimously to do away with it. This action at UNC
is illustrtalive of general trends. More than 100 colleges already have
Greek Weeks and the number will grow impressively this year. Hell
Week is immature and out of step with the times. Fraternities originally

made no room for Hell Week .. .

it crept in. Now fraternities are

anxious to do away with it. This Committee heartily endorses their

feeling..

F. WOULD IT BE BENEFICIAL AT DAVIDSON?: There
would be no point in submitting this report if we did not feel that Greek

Week would be beneficial.

Il. RECOMMENDATIONS

A. GENERAL:

(1) That the Davidson fraternities agree on a week in which to

give the Greek Help Week suggested below a trial, preferably
to be the second full week of the second semester, February

That no pressure whatsoever be put on any individual frater-

nity as to when or in what manner it handles its individual
initiation, Participation in Greek Help Week would not neces-
sarily keep a chapter from pre-initiation practices of its own,
though it is hoped and urged that childish and harmful prac-

11-16.
(2)

tices will be curtailed.
B. SPECIPIC:

We suggest and recommend that the following Greek Help Week
be instituted and carried out by the Davidson fraternities during a week
agreed upon by them, preferably February 11-16.

Monday Afternoon—An all‘pledge community project to make the
Davidson business district sanitary, to attempt to beautify it as
much as possible, and to paint the colored school building.

Monday Night Supper-——Half of the pledges of each fraternity will be
the guests of another pledge class, with the other half of the class
remaining at their own boarding house to help entertain their visitors.
Lots will be drawn to determine which house each pledge group

will visit.

Tuesday Night—That a program to be called the Greek Week Varieties
be presented. This will consist of twelve skits, one by each pledge
class and appropriate awards will be made to the winning groups.

Wednesday Afternoon—That the pledge groups on the campus unite
themselves into one medicine ball team and engage in friendly com-
bat with the medicine ball against another team to be composed of
brothers from each fraternity, and that a suitable prize be awarded

the winning team.

Wednesday Night—That the second pledge interchange dinners be held,
enabling those pledges who stayed at home Monday night to visit
another boarding house for supper. Same procedure as for Monday

night supper.

Thursday Night—That ali of the presidents eat at one house and then
have a joint meeting to discuss problems common to all of them;
that the same procedure be carried out by the boarding house
managers, the sports managers, the rush chairmen, the scholarship
chairmen, the pledge chairmen, the treasurers, and the presidents
of each pledge class; that these meetings take the place of fraternity
meetings for this night; and that the eating place of each group

be decided by lot.

Say Play Down
Grid Emphasis

Definitely aiming to de-emphasize inter-collegiate football
in the Southern Conference, a Davidson delegation is in Rich-
mond, Va., tonight meeting with officials of all conference schools.

The Davidson policy is in line
with the desires of at least two
major institutions, Duke and Caro-
lina, according to delegate chief Dr.
J. R. Cunningham.

Eight points up for discussion are
recommendations made by the as-
sembled presidents of the confer-
ence colleges at a preliminary meet-
ing September 28 at UNC.

The solons, including Dr.
Cunningham, voted to try to
utilize four specific resolutions
made by the National Associa-
tion of Collegiste Commis-
sioners and four of their own.
The four NACC suggestions are:
(1) To recognize the need for

a sane balance in the students’ life
and to reaffirm that he is a student
primarily and an athlete incidental-
ly,

(2) To restrict or eliminate
outcof-season practice sessions
especially in football and bas-
ketball.

(3) To curtail schedules so as
to prevent overlapping seasons.

(4) To preserve institution-
al control over athletics free
from outside pressure such as
that of alumni groupe.

The remaining four points to be
ander fire were raised by the presi-
dents themselves at the September
preliminary meeting. They are as
follows:

(1) No freshman will par-
ticipate in conference varsity
competition after next Septem-
ber.

(2) No post-season contests
will be permitted with or with-
out permission, effective this
season.

(3) No transfer will be per-
mitted to play the sport in which
he engaged at the former institu-
tion and no other sports until one
year of residenze has been accom-
plished.

(4) College admission standards
should be of a standard caliber to
all prospective entrants.

Y Gift Fund
May Fail Goal

For First Time

For the first time since its incep-
tion, the YMCA Christmas Gift
Fund may fall short of its goal.

That was the word from drive
chairman Bryan Robinson this aft-
ernoon. Robinson, while declining
to release the amount reported to
date, said: “There is a good possi-
bility that we may not reach our
goal of $6,000. I'm afraid some of
the freshmen don’t realize that this
is an annual gift which we have
never failed to back to success.

“We have tried to conduct the
drive without outside appeal this
year, hoping that this will be a pure-
ly within the student body gift.
Pledges can be made now, and paid
after Christmas.”

The fund total, which would re-
quire an average contribution of
$7.50 from each man in the student
body, will be announced Monday
in chapel,

Field Day Sees
Eager Frosh Bow
To Strong Sophs

The freshman’s chance to doff
their dinks permanently and be re-
lieved of freshmen regulations was
erased Tuesday afternoon when
they lost the touch football game
and relay of the annual “Freshman-
Sophomore Day.”

The sophomore’s football team
clearly outclassed the frosh all the
way, pulling through by a score of
24 to 12. From the very first the
sophomores showed their superior
strength and teamwork by runnin:
up a lead cof 18 points in the first
half.

During the second half the
freshmen ran up two tallies
while the sophomores eased up
a bite and did not cross the
goal but once more.

Corky Johnson and Max DeVane
led the sophomores to victory. Max
was especially outstanding as pas-
ser for the team. Two freshmen
who showed up well were Watt
Moore and Ronnie Whittson.

The high spot of the day
from a freehman's view-point
was the “tug of war.” Here
they took advantage of superior
weight to win the first two
pulls and take the event.

From the start of the relay, the
sophomores forged ahead and were
never in danger of losing. This
event was won hands down from
the freshmen.

Judge Guiton thought that the
freshmen showed excellent spirit;
the best which has been shown for
a long while.

Although the frosh put their
hearts into it, they were defeated,
and red hats will still be visible
for a while yet, and neopliyte reg-
ulations abided by.

27 Donors Boost
Red Cross Total

A group of 23 students voluntari-
ly went to Charlotte Tuesday aft-
ernoon to add their blood donations
to the total of 446 gathered at Da-
vidson in the Blood Drive 10 days
ago.

The group made the round-trip

in a bus which was graciously

donated by the Queen City

Coach Company of Charlotte.

A county policeman moved

ahead of the bus to speed the

At the Blood Center the students
were joined by four others, so that
a total of 27 donations were made.

The donors were comprised
largely of members of the bas-
ketball team and of the wrest-

ling team whose schedules did

not permit donations at the

regular time. The athletes were
joined by a number of other

students. .

Colonel Ballard, chairman of the
Drive, wishes to express apprecia-
tion to the entire group of 27 for
generously giving both of their time
and blood.

Common faults in the Charlotte-Davidson Stretch of Highway 21
are brought out in four of the pictures above. Top left photo shows
clearly an example of crumbling of the side of the road, where both
macadam and the concrete base are giving way to wear. Top center

A_DAVIDSONIAN EDITORIAL:

Highway 21 Continues Its Toll
While Awaiting Overdue Repairs

Despite a $200,000,000 road bond
issue which has enabled the North
Carolina farmer to come to town,
the vast expenditure still has failed
to fix it so that the college boy
can go to town—safely.

The path which leads over the
hills to Charlotte has stood for
years as the gap rather than bridge
between Davidson and the Queen
City, has a good chance to stand a
bit longer in its present state, ac-
cording to a. comment by Dr.
Ernest Beaty, Mecklenburg Coun-
ty Commissioner,

“We've been after the state for
years to repair tlie Charlotte road,”
Beaty declared, “but it seems to
be a year or two off at best. The
folks in Raleigh teti me that they’re
due to work on our road (North
21) as soon as work is complcted

on 49 and 29. But how long can
we wait?

“Bus drivers who come through
here now tell me—probably not
without sonie exaggeration, but
still with a good deal of meaning—
that this highway is the worst
stretch they travel from Detroit to
Miami.”

The average Charlotte- Davidson
traveler draws his own opinion of
the point's exaggeration. Badly in
need. of -resurfacing, the 20-mile
stretch is seriously a safety meén-
ace. The crumbling edges of the
pavement serve as bevels to smooth
a tire’s slip from the narrow way
onto the soft shoulders at the side,
at some points no more than five
feer wide. After the brief five feet
slide? Outside of Cornelius tele-
phone poles border the shoulder,

ness of the road, particularly in the long stretch outside Cornelius.
Lower left pictures a drop-off to the shoulder, custom built for.

pictures are illustrative of improvements which have been made.
The shoulder improvement with pavement and the reflector sticks

and as. they move out to a safer
distance, a snaring ditch moves in
to take their place.

“Slippery When Wet" applies to
the macadam strip along the entire
route until it terminates in the con-
crete this side of Charlotte, Repair
strips make the road a hodge podge
of scattered tar “banana peels” in
the lightest rain.

The legendary “wrong-way”
banked curves, the blind hills and
curves, and the narrowness of the
few straight aways mark the high-
way an engineer's as well as mo-
torists’ nightmare. Passing has be-
come a feat only the brave (or
reckless?) dare try.

While truckers and busses are
bound to the road by schedules,
the businessman forsakes what
would be the most dircct Sartery

from Charlotte to West Virginia
and farther north to swing by way
of Newton or around by Concord.
Unfortunately, it is the only way
open between Charlotte and Da-
vidson.

To describe the road’s condition
is at best woefully ineffective. One
must drive it to know that Ameri-
ca‘’s millionth accident well could
come on Highway 21! It could
well be a Davidson student. ;

But that millionth traffic death is
due THIS MONTH, not two or
three years hence, Highway 21
needs immediate attention. The
Davidson student has the opportun-
ity during Christmas to put the
word to. his representative to the
state legislature. Four words will
suffice: “It’s action or accidents.”

Makes First 100
On Paris Island
Marine Ed. Test

Leroy Carlton, who recently
withdrew from Davidson in his third
year, has established a new record
at the Paris Island Marine Station.

He is the first recruit from
North Carolina ever to make a
perfect score on the test given
all new men to determine their
educational qualifications. The
test is administered by all serv-
ices,

Capt. C. E. Brandon, head of Ma-
tine recruiting for the state, said
that the test has been given thou-
sands of enlistees since 1948 and
Carsiton was the first ever to answer
every question. .

Carlton received preparatory,
training at Fishburne Military
School where he led his class
and twice was presented Schol-
astic medals.

He is the son of Mr. and Mrs.
Leroy Cariton of Greensboro.

Red-Faced Adams
Pleads IFC Title

A red-faced Bill Adams this week pleaded successfully for
changing the name of Davidson's intra-fraternity board from Pan-
Hellenic Council to Inter-Fraternity Council.

Custom has it ‘that Pan-Hellenic
is a name applied to inter-sorority
councils and IFC to fraternity men.

This was emphasized when
Adams arrived at a national
IFC meeting and found himself
billeted with a girl.

to Adam's trip.

A review of principles of
Greek Week was the chief pur-
pose of this meeting of repre-
sentatives from the fraternities
and sororities all over the na-
tion.

Meeting af Old Point Comfort,
Virginia, the delegates studied pro-
grams from various universities and
fraternities who have instituted
Greek Week programs.

Especially needed are warm
clothes such as sweaters,
jackets, gloves, coats, scarves,
and caps. These clothes after
processing will be rushed to
Europe.

Students are requested to bring
clothes back from the holidays and
these too will be included in the
drive. “Let's start living the Christ-
mas spirit,” exhorted President Bob
Henry.

High Figures Show
Accident Total Up
In Past Two Years

According to county police rec-
ords, there will be more traffic ac-
cidents this year on the Davidson-
Charlotte highway than ever be-
fore. With 52 accidents, including
three fatalities, already reported in
1951 and the bad-weather month
of December still to go, the num-
ber of accidents seems certain to
pass last year’s total of 54.

Accidents on the Davidson-Char-
lotte route have risen from a level
of 39 and 38 in 1947 and 1948 to
43 in 1949 and thence to last year’s
high of 54.

The largest single cause in traf-
fic accidents in America accord-
ing to a survey made by the Penn-
sylvania Safety Commission is
speeding.

Ten more accidents were listed
on a 10-mile stretch of the Char-
lotte-Salisbury highway than on the
less traveled Davidson route, but
the Salisbury road recorded 543
speeding arrests as to 133 on the
Davidson highway.

Thus, though it has only one-

In Past Years

By HUNTER STRADER

Christmas will come to the Da-
vidson campus Monday night in all
the true meaning of the word.

Barium Springs night is one
looked forward to by the students
for more reasons than one, Not only
do several score of children receive
Christmas presents and get « trip
that promisés entertainment and 3
break from regular routine, but sev-
eral hundred boys get a “shot in
the arm” so to speak.

Many a Davidson student can
truthfully say that the real
spirit of Christmas first struck
him ae he watched these chil-
dren enjoying themselves—saw
the expressions on their faces
when Santa walked into the
room—or sang Christmas carols
with some six-year-old on his
knee.

Rev. McClure, Superintendent of
the Orphanage, has informed the
YMCA officials that the children
will arrive at 7:15 p.m., Monday
night in several busses.

There they will be met by repre-
sentatives of the various groups and
escorted to the houses where the
festivities will take place.

There will be approximately

160 of various ages, ranging

from six to 14. Each of the 12

groups will be composed of both

boys and girls if possible.

During the two-hour visit the
children will be playing various
games under the direction of the
boys, will be fed, and finally each
will receive a gift.

Each group will be visited by
Santa Claus. All students should
wait until after the guests have
seen St. Nick before voicing their
own requests.

When the sound of voices,
both young and old, can be
heard on fraternity court and
in Eu Hall singing those Christ-
mas carols, which have become
dear to their hearts, everyone
will know that Christmas is
here—that it is an active. living
thing that brings joy and glad-
ness to all who participate.

And when those same voices are
saying “Good-night” and “Thank
you,” every Davidson student will
have something‘ inside him to carry
through the holidays and make this
truly a season of “peace on earth,
good will toward men.”

Christmas Caro
Is Vesper Theme
Of Yule Program

The annual Christmas Vesper
service. will be held Sunday eve-
ning, at 7:30 o'clock, in Chambers
Auditorium. A traditional feature of
the evening is the antiphonal play-
ing by brass ‘choirs of Christmas
carols before and after the service.

Norma Heyde, soprano soloist
for the Christmas Vesper program,
is a voice instructor with the Uni-
versity of Michigan Music Depart-
ment. She received her Master's
Degree in music at the University
of Michigan where she took leading
roles in many concert and opera
productions. This lovely lyric singer
appeared as soloist in “The Blessed
Damozel,” by Debussy, on the 1950
Brevard Music Festival, and was
soloist again on the 1951 Brevard
Music Festival's production of
Mendelssohn's “Elijah.” This will
be Miss Heyde’'s first visit to the
Davidson campus. Special numbers
on the program will include “I
Wonder as I Wander,” solo by Miss
Heyde, accompanied by the David-
son Male Chorus, and “Come Unto
Him,” from Handel's .“Messiah.”

The Davidson Male Chorus and
Chapel Choir will sing traditional
Christmas carols, These two organ-
izations are under the direction of
Donald Plott, who joined the staff
of the Davidson College Music De-
partment in September of this year
as vocal instructor. Harold Frantz
will be at. the organ.

The Davidson Little Symphony,
conducted by James Christian Pfohl,
will play during the service.
