Compulsory Fee: Bring Us

AN ANALYSIS

Just when most students are
finding out that summer was
almost over, they also found
letters in their mail informing
them rather tersely that a com-
pulsory board would go into
effect one year hence (1972-73).

The letter stated that such
things as tuition, fees, laundry,
room reni, college board, and
orientation and social funds
would be lumped into one pack-
age deal for every student, with
few exceptions.

“By implementing the con-
cept of a comprehensive fee,”
the letter continues, “‘the col-
lege believes the portion of the
cost of education which students
pay will be more equitably dis-
tributed for all students.

“‘We must employ faculty and
staff and open facilities for an
entire school year. Students who
pay unly part of the tuition and
fees place a greater financial
burden on other students.

“Implicit in the concept of a

residential college is residence
within a pattern of living that
provides for the meeting and
mixing of all members of the
academic community. Having
Students room and board on
campus provides the atmosphere
for such a pattern of living.”

The letter concludes by list-
ing schools like Amhers:, Wof-
ford, Florida Presbyterian, Yale
and Manchester which already
have a comprehensive fee, whai-
ever that has to do with David-
son.

Sophomore Todd Eades pre-
sented an excellent study of
comprehensive tuition to the
student Senate this week in
what was the first student re-
sponse to another nebulous ad-
ministrative change. And until
this report was submitted, the
students were as ignorant about
the change as the college trus-
tees.

First looking at the non-fin-
ancial advantages, Eades pre-
dicted that a compulsory tui-
tion would advance educational
planning considerably.

The fee would ‘make pay-
ment for academic services
more equitable, and reduce the

YSA Heads Seek
Chapter, Speakers

By JOHN KEPCHAR

The Young Socialist Alliance
c(YSA) hopes to establish a lo-
ca) chapter on the Davidson
campus this vear.

The YSA is currently headed
by Steve Cross and John Brax-
ton, and if a local is established
they hope to bring Lynda Jen-
ness or Andrew Pulley, the So-
cialist candidates for president
and vice-president, to speak on
campus.

The YSA takes the stand that
capitalism is too unstable a gov-
ernment for the United States,
and feels that socialism has
much to offer.

They feel that many problems
such as pollution and inflation
could be much more easily con-
trolled by the socialistic system.

For example, the individual
citizens who own the businesses
that do the polluting will not be
likely to spend the money nec-
essary to control their wastes,
as it cuts into their profit, but
a socialist government would.

They are also.in favor of a-
thirty hour work-week with no
increase in pay, which would
cure unemployment, and they
are in favor of women’s libera-
tion.

They believe Britain has a
good system, though the work-
ers are not allowed a large
enough voice in the running of
industry, Cross said.

The YSA is in favor of na-
tionalizing communication, tran-
sportation, manufacturing and
financial enterprises.

They will also be in favor of
the coming moratorium on the
Vietnam War, though they did
not advocate stopping the gov-
ernment on May Day, Cross
said.

Workers Party and the YSA

planning of the academic budg-
et to an easier task.”

The fee would also give stu-
dents a greater opportunity to
take extra courses without hav-
ing to pay extra, as is the pre-
sent case.

The financial advantages are
basically those of simplifica-
tion of a process. Accounting
procedures would be easier with
all of the money in a common
polo.

Bookkeeping would be reduc-
ed with the stabilization of the
money flow and the college will
be able to figure out quickly
how much money it is working
with in any special area with a
great deal more detail.

Eades commented: ‘It costs
so much to run the school as
it is. and the college feels ev-
erybody should pay the same
for the same services.”

There are several serious
drawbacks to the comprehen-
sive fee. however, which Eades
believes are more dangerous
than the positive weight of the
advantages.

The primary problem rests
with board. Eades said that
while he recommended that the
senate accept the compulsory
fee as far as the academic
budget was concerned. he did
not fee) that the required board
would be financially or moral-
Iv advantageous for this school.

The most significant effect
that the compulsory board would
have would be to effectively
prevent most students from
saving money by eating in their
reoms instead of at their eat-
ing house.

While the college will be will-
ing to give partial refunds to
those who can demonstrate a
legitimate reason for doing so
(for example, students working

would be forced to eat several
meals a week there), eating in
one’s room is not presently con-
sidered accepiable.

Therefore, students will be
d:scouraged from being thrifty
and independent.

Eades added that the college
will have to collect eating club
money as income, and that this
method will only swamp the
business office as far as book-
keeping is concerned.

The original idea was a base-
board fee, with the college set-
ting up a $300 fee per student
per house and then coilecting
and handling the bills. This
would help frateinity treasurers
who have been having trouble
getting their fees paid.

But with the comprehensive
board fee, the college business
office will have to keep a rec-
ord for each student, including
his house. the indiv:dual cost
of the house per meal. and the
number of meals eaten ai the
house per term (such as a half-
board set-up).

Another disturbing effect that
this plan most likely will have
will be increased competition to
obtain permission to go off cam-
pus.

Off-campus clearances are
numbered, and financially they.
could turn into gold, going to
the highest bidder.

For example, some students
can eat off campus much cheap-
er than they would paying $500
on campus for meals. Thus by
paying around $100 for a posi-
uon on the off-campus list, a
ihrifty student might still save
a little money or at least break

‘egether?

even in the Jong run.

Many students may be un-
willing to stomach this new
idea, especially with regard to
board, and hence desire to es-
cape to off-campus housing.

What this would effectively do
would be to pit the students
against the administration on
vet another issue.

However, there appears to be
no alarm on first Chambers as
to the possible repercussions of
their actions except in the busi-
ness office where it is felt that
bookkeeping will become far
more complicated.

College Treasurer Robert A.
Currie will indeed have his
hands full. For not only will the
collegé collect the set fee of
$500 per house, but will also
iake in any additional fee that
an individual house might de-
cide to levy.

The business office is gen-
erally perplexed by the com-
pulsory fee in which it had lit-
tle voice and wary of an aval-
anche of red tape which may:
soon be thrust upon its limited
staff. ;

The top brass in the ‘adminis-
‘ration have scrupulously main-
tained a public silence as well
about the motives or imechan-
ism behind the fee, vaguely be-
moaning the plight of the col-
lege “in a time of financial
stringency.”

Something must be done wo
rectify the whole comprehen-
sive fee controversy. bly
the most satisfactory thing that
could be done would be to drop
the board fee from the: lump
sum. :
