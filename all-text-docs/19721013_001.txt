C. Smith financially sound, but
he has also done an incredible

job with the United Negro~

College Fund."’

Newsom is the former
president of Barber Scotia
College and Johnson C. Smith
University. He is currently
president of Central State
University in Ohio.

Several faculty members in-
formally introduced this week a
proposal which would delete the
stipulation in the Trustee
Bylaws that any faculty mem-
ber given tenure must be an ac-
tive member of a Christian
church.

In a letter to the faculty.
Associate Professor of Religion
Alexander McKelway — ex-
pressed the need for *‘an open
and unlimited search for truth”
and proposed a resolution
asking the Board of Trustees to
remove ‘a religious test for ap-
pointment to the faculty.”

“I want to give the faculty
some chance to discuss this
question among themselves
prior to an actual vote.’ ex-
plained McKelway.

A special meeting of the
faculty will be necessary if the
matter is to brought before the
board's October meeting.

relations under five Presidents.

Bowles is also a_ prolific
writer, having written 11 books
about various foreign problems
and topics related to his years
as a public servant.

Bowles will receive his
degree in absentia as he is
unable to attend due to his af-
fliction with Parkinson's
disease.

His Excellency L. K. Jha is
also one of the distinguished
guests of the college during the
Convocation. “The topic of his
speech should prove very in-
teresting, giving one the
present state of relations with
India,” Bruce said. “His ap-
pearance might also expedite
the formation of the exchange
program between Davidson
and India.

“though there has been some
negative response."

approval to the resolution along

with McKelway are Vice

They intend to submit the
resolution to the entire faculty
as soon as a special meeting can
be called, McKelway said.

If it is adopted, they will
request that College President
Samuel R. Spencer Jr. transmit
the proposal to the Board of
Trustees, requesting that copies
of it be placed in the hands of
each board member before the
fall meeting.

College Slows Student Voting

By TOM BRUCE
Contributing Editor

Following repeated requests
from out-of-state students, Mrs.
Joyce Fleagle, Assistant to the
Comptroller and official notary,
continued to refuse to notarize
student absentee ballot request
forms this week.

Many states require that
students wishing to vote by ab-
sentee ballot file a special form
signed by the college registrar
verifying that they are college
students. The requests are not
valid unless stamped with a
notary public's seal.

The registrar's office has
directed some students to Mrs.
Fleagle’s office to have the
form notarized. When Mrs.
Fleagle refused to comply. the

students had to locate someone
else to notarize the forms.

Robert J. Stephenson, direc-
tor of personnel is the only other
notary public on campus. He
used his seal to validate a num-
ber of student's forms.

Otherwise, applicants were
forced to seek help from Pied-
mont Bank and Trust in David-
son and at area law offices.

“We have processed quite a
number of the forms.”’ an of-
ficial at Piedmont Bank stated.
“We are happy to help the
students in this way."’ The bank
charges 50 cents to stamp the
forms in order to defray the fee
for the stamps and to com-
pensate for the time of bank
personnel.

The fee which Mrs. Fleagle
pays to maintain her standing
as a notary public is paid for by

Davidson College, according to
Mrs. Fleagle.

“Even though the stamping
itself might take only a few
seconds, the interruptions keep
me from getting my work
done," Mrs. Fleagle said. ‘‘The
college provides the seal for me
to do notes and deeds of trust.

“I certainly don't feel that it’s
the responsibility of the college
to offer this service. If it were
me and I wanted to vote bad
enough, I'd go out and pay,”
Mrs. Fleagle added.

Mrs. Fleagle's actions came
on the heels of President
Samuel R. Spencer's Sept. 25
state of the college address in
which he urged students to,
“make a sincere effort to vote
in the November elections, by
either going home or voting by
absentee ballot.”

McKelway Presents Faculty With Proposal

To Drop Religious Tenure Requirement

‘Since this is a college which has a special respon-
sibility to encourage teaching and scholarship within
a Christian climate, the President and other officers
of the college should make every effort to see that
there are effective proponents of the Christian faith

on the teaching faculty

of the college. In order,

however, to preserve a healthy and vigorous in-
tellectual life on the campus, no attempt should be
made to restrict temporary or permanent ap-
pointments to the faculty to those professing a par-

ticular religious point of view.”

McKelway

“I would think that the
restrictions in the bylaws will
be changed.’ McKelway said.

“If the faculty will express it-
self strongly it will be a help; I
rather suspect this will be the
case."

In any event, the board will
not be able to take definite ac-
tion on the question this Oc-
tober, McKelway noted, as a
number of separate readings
are required for a propesed
resolution.

“I would assume that the
stipulation cannot be changed
for some months, but the ad-
ministration may be able to get
some initial indications,’ he
suggested, adding that ‘‘The at-
titude of the Administration will
make a big difference."

McKelway said his objection
was primarily theoretical. ‘‘The
only way to create an en-
vironment responsive to the

Jha Speaks '

Christian faith is to have the
faculty, Administration and
Trustees work at it constantly.
“This may be difficult, but
it’s more possible than the in-
valid assumption that a legal
requirement will create such an
environment," he said.

The faculty met with the
Trustee Education Committee
Wednesday according to Pat-
terson, who is also president of
the Davidson chapter of the
American Association of
University Professors..

Before the meeting, Pat-
terson said, ‘‘It's an informal
open meeting which we called
to arrive at a fuller un-
derstanding of the principles of
tenure we're now working with.

“Inevitably the subject of the
religious requirement will come

up, and I personally would like
to have a discussion of it.”
