NO ADVANTAGE GAINED IN
MARRIAGE

“Marriage is a book of which the
first chapter is written in poetry and the
remaining chapters in prose,” says Bever-
ly Nichols, young English writer, in the
March College Humor. ‘Modern mar-
riage is a book of which the first chap-
ter is usually written in free verse and
the remaining chapters in journalese. Al-
ways my question is ‘What will happen
when the poetry gives way to prose ?’
Frankly, I don’t know. Nor do you.

“What, I ask myself, could a wife do
for me? She could not write any of my
books, though she might stop ame from
writing some of them. She might do
my typing, but that is an indignity t
which I would not subject her. I prefer
to pay my.typist’s bills. What else could
a wife do for me? She could run my
house. - Yes. Of all the foolish legends
with which this world is befogged the
legend that women know anything about
To
see them as they attempt to tackle a su-
premely. simple operation such as spring
cleaning is as embarrassing as to watch
an incompetent subaltern getting tied
up with his-platoon during army maneu-
vers.

“Nor have women, with the exception
of rare geniuses, any conception of deco-
ration. If women really had their way
they would turn every room into a jumble
sale. If they are given a picture, up it
must go, whether it is appropriate or
not. If they have a cushion, it must be
pushed in somehow or other. What else
could a wife do for me? She could be
a companion. Ah! You are ‘evoking the
phantom which is the haunting fear of
all bachelors—loneliness. But may there
not be a welcome in the very loneliness
after the fretting contacts of the day?
And are there not more books in the
world to read than I shall ever know,
and am I not far more capable than any-
body else of pouring out my own whiskey
and soda?

“Suppose I have been to an amusing
party. I may want the party to go on.
I may want to bring dozens of people
home with me—Jane who sings, and John
who plays the piano, and Oliver who
mimics people so brilliantly. If I am mar-
ried, how am I going to-do that, unless I
marry an angel of tact and forbearance?

“T rejoice in my freedom. If I chonse,
I can get on board a steamer tomorrow
and sail to Hawaii and start a trade in
illicit drugs. I can grow a beard and
screech anarchy in Hyde Park. I can
stay in bed and eat. macaroons. I can
fill the house with monkeys. .I can keep
goldfish in the bath. In other words, I
can ‘be myself,’ as the Americans say.

Failing Linguists

Sanford University, Cal—(CNA) —
The frequent lament of foreign lan-
guage teachers that so many of their
students fail because so many dull pu-
pils take up foreign languages has
been weighed scientifically. One thou-
sand boys and girls in Spanish lang-
uage classes in high school and Junior
high schools have been given an in-
telligence test. The language students
were found to be above average in
mental ability, Walter Kaulfers, of
Stanford University has reported to
School and Society.

“When as many as 19 per cent of
the students of foreien language fail
in the high schools and junior high
schools, and whea the general intel-
ligence of the studenis of these classes,
and even of the failing groups, is above
that of pupils in general, the suspicion
becomes strong that a high ‘rate of
mortality may be due rather to faults
in the teaching and organization of
the courses than to deficiencies in the
students themselves,” he stated.

Too Much Alarm

New Haven—(CNA)—A_ band was on
the stage during a theatrical perform-

ago and in recent years students of
the college have been clamoring for a

Thanksgiving time the stands have
been ignited for the last three years.

DR. BROWN
SPEAKS ON
FREIGHT RATES

“North Carolina's industrial progress
today is decidedly hampered by the high
and exhorbitant freight rates imposed
hy the railroads, which situaton s due
to a lack of an east-towest railway thru
North Carolna to the mid-west,” declared
Dr. C. K. Brown, professor of economes
at Davidson, in speaking here Thursday
night before the Quadranglers Club, a
faculty organization.

Dr. Brown recently completed his post-
graduate work in the field of economics,
and has made an exhaustive study of the
freight rates through North Carolina.
His recent book, “A State Movement in
Railroad Development,” dealt wth this
particular® phase of economics, and has
received state-wide attention and publi-
city.

The speaker gave a historical illustrat-
ed discussion ,in which he told of the
efforts between 1848 and 1880 to construct
an east-to-west railroad through North
Carolina, which attempt was thwarted
when the state sold the Western North
Carolina railroad. Another contributing
factor responsible the failure, he
said, occurred jin 1871 when the railroad
operating between Goldsboro and Char-
lotte sold.

No critiefsms of these actons was of-
fered by Dr, Brown, for extenuating cir-
cumstances lead to these sales. On the
other hand, he lauded the state for its va-
liant and desperate struggles, whch, if
they had materialized, would give North
Carolina freight rates today which would
he on a parity with those of other states.

Dr. Brown thoroughly explained the
North Carolna freight ates, which ‘are
determined by taking the rates extended
to Norfolk and intermediary points from
the mid-west, and then adding an extra

for

was

fee for North Carolina cities, even
though some of them might he located
close to the mid-western points than

Virginia destinations. “A direct through
line,” he maintained, “would insure North
Carolina cheaper rates, and would enable
them to enter into competition. At present
a Richmond dealer can sell good in North
Carolina territory, which rightly should
helong to Carolina merchants.

“The only hope that I can see for a
decrease in the freight rates to North
Carolina,” he declared, “is through the
action of the Interstate Commerce Com-
mission. A rapidly expanding railroad
traffic, with a subsequent prosperity for
the railroads in the South, will probably
lead to an ultimate revision of the rates,
based more nearly on the principal of
distance, Until then, there seems to be
no relief.”

New Haven, Conn.—(CNA)—Sturdies

Four Classes Aid in
Purchasing Uniforms

W. B. McQueen, though he has by
graduation at the first term severed
his official relations with the college,
will continue to act as the editor of the

Chameleon. There will be but one
more edition published this year, and
this will be some time in April, prob-

ably toward the first of the month.

All of the material for the next and
final issue of the Davidson College
Magazine is being collected by Frank
Hall, who is actively in charge of the

publication in the absence of McQueen.

As to the contents, much the same
general policy with regard .to contents
will be followed. The Book Review
department which was an addition in
the last issue is to be continued. All
students wishing to contribute to the
final issue should either submit their
material to Frank Hall or get in touch
with him at an early date. Despite the
rather scathing review of the last issue
of the Magazine, there has been quite
a good deal of material submitted for
publication, so that all contributors or
would-be contributors had best make
haste according to editors, if they de-
sire their creations to see the lightcun-
der the auspices of the Chameleon.

SAME EDITOR FOR
LAST CHAMELEON

At the suggestion of Capt. Elkins,
the classes held meetings and adopted
plans for raising funds for the new
band uniforms. All of the proceeds
have not yet beeg turned in but so far
they have been very satisfactory.

Final plans for the actual purchasing
of the uniforms have not yet been
completed, but will be when the rest
of the money is turned in sometiine
during the next few days. At this
time the capes, caps and trousers wil!
be ordered.

It will be impossible to order the
complete equipments at once but the
second installment of them will be pur-
chased as soon as sufficient funds are
raised.

The Incal chapter of the American
Legion recently sent a check for $25
to help buy “the new uniforms. An
officer in the Reserve O.ticers’ Corps
at Charlotte also sent a check. ‘This
man was a former Davidson student.
