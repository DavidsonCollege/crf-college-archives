Elections ’96 BY RACHEL ANDERSON

Is Clinton just blowing smoke?

“With this historic action we are taking today, Joe Camel and the Marlboro Man will be out of our children’s
reach forever.” - President Bill Clinton

President Clinton discusses the tobacco issue in terms of a moral struggle: big business versus America’s
youth, yet critics claim that Clinton’s concern is primarily related to his fight for re-election. His regulations,
based on the FDA’s classification of tobacco products as delivery devices for the drug nicotine, would heavily
restrict tobacco advertisements aimed at youth and prohibit the sale of tobacco products to minors. If
successful, the measures could improve public health and reduce medical expenditures on smoking related
illness. Republicans charge that the announcement was intended to draw attention away from Clinton’s failure
in the war-on-drugs and establish his pro-family reputation.

We asked several Davidson students for their reaction to Clinton’s proposed crack-down on tobacco.

“It was a gutsy move on his part. It’s ashame governors such as Jim Hunt can’t follow Clinton’s brave actions.

They’ re not the only ones who need to be re-elected. It’s unfortunate that politics have to get in the way of

what should be a non-partisan effort to curb the effects of one of the most harmful trends in our country.”
Elizabeth Field (‘98)

“Most people feel smoking’s not good for you, but people should be able to smoke if they want to.”
Brice Ivy (‘97)

“I’m tired of seeing my friends begin to chain smoke and then let it lead to other drugs.”
Rosemary Schmidt (‘00)

Last Tuesday the U. S. launched a missile strike against Iraq which,
according to reports, killed five people and injured 19. President Clinton
ordered the attack in retaliation for Iraqi President Saddam Hussein’ s military
assault on Kurdish rebels last weekend, Hussein’s offensive against the Kurds
occurred in an area of Iraq recognized as a safe-area by the United Nations.

Terrified inhabitants of the state of Uttar Pradesh in India face the first
threat of man-eating wolves in over 100 years. Since April, 33 small children
have been killed and eaten by wolves, which recently began to enter the state’s
impoverished villages. An estimated 20 children have been mauled by the
creatures, which until recently, maintained little contact with humans.

In 1878 there were 624 reported human killings by man-eating wolves.

Last Sunday, Russia sent a rescue team to Norway, where 141 passengers
aboard a Vnukovo Airlines jetliner were killed when the plane crashed into a
mountain a week and a half ago. The plane had departed from Moscow
carrying vacationing coal miners from Russia and Ukraine. It crashed into
Opera Mountain just six miles from the Norwegian airport at which it was
schedule to arrive.

Tuesday marked the first day of school for Washington D. C.’s nearly
80,000 school-age children. However, six schools were shut down last month
by D. C.’s Superior Court because they failed to meet safety standards. Until
fire and other regulations are met, the six schools’ 3,000 students are being
bussed to nearby schools and churches for temporary classes. Due to budget
cuts, last spring the D. C. school district laid off 426 teachers.

Over $2 million and 500 years after Leonardo da Vinci was commis-
sioned by the Duke of Milan to create the world’s largest equestrian statue,
Leonardo’s project may soon stand in Milan. During his life, Leonardo spent
20 years on the project, and was finally interrupted by France’s occupation of

_| Milan in 1499. Now, at the Tallix Foundry in Beacon, N.Y., Americans have

constructed a three-story horse in an attempt to revive Leonardo’s dream. If
funds are secured, Il Cavallo will be sent to Milan in time for the 500 year
anniversary of France’s occupation of the city.
