Davidson Begins

Air Observer Post

Davidson community is in the
process of establishing a Ground
Observer Post to provide air de-
fense for this section of Mecklen-
burg County. The post will be a
part of the Charlotte Area Air De-
fense Program.

Phi Mu Alpha Group
To Present Concert

The local chapter of Phi Mu Al-
pha, national honorary music fra-
ternity, will present a concert by
its members in the College Union.
On Wednesday, February 25, at
6:15 P. M.

It is the first purpose of the
fraternity “to advance the cause
of music in America,” and the pur-
suit of this aim is partially realized
by the fraternity’s annual presen-
tation of concerts entirely devoted
to the presentation of music by
American composers.

As its part in this national con-
certed effort to present the best
in native music to the American
public, Gamma Kappa chapter is
planning a varied and interesting
program ranging in scope from a
performance of a work by the em-
inent composer-critic Deems Tay-
lor to a composition for piano by
Charles M. Roper, a graduate of.
Davidson in the class of '52 and
last year’s president of Phi Mu
Alpha.

All interested members of the
student body, faculty, and admin-
istration are cordially invited to
attend. There will be no admission

Initiete Ten

The music fraternity recently in-
itiated ten new brothers into mem-
bership. The new initiates are
George Brinkley, Thorny Frick,
Courtney Hill, Owen Leland, Jack
MacQueen, Charles McElveen,
Budd Montgomery, Richard Mor-
row, David Pfaff, and Grier Robin-

son.

‘

Science classes, the post will go
into operation February 14 and 15,
1953, when military aircraft will
conduct a simulated strafing and
bombing attack on Davidson.

On Monday, February 9, the
third year Military Science classes
will attend a meeting as guests of
the Charlotte Filter Center, at
which time the Chief Supervisor
of that Center will explain to the
Davidson volunteer’ group the
workings of the Ground Observer
Corps on a nation wide basis.

Tom Ligon of the Junior Class
is the Chief Observer for the ca-
dets. The Chief Observer for the
townspeople has yet to be chosen.
Chief Supervisors are Captain
Hatch and Master Sergeant Sowell.

Anny Sets New
Deferment Policy

Colonel Davis of the Military De-
partment has announced a new de-
ferment policy which will enable
Government deferments in ROTC
to be given only to men who plan
to go through basic and advanced
courses in Military Science at
Davidson with a plan of entering
the U. S. Army with a commission
following graduation.

Davis has stated that there are
now two basic requirements which
all men must meet in order to be
eligible for an ROTC deferment.

First, students will be grant-
ed a deferment only if they
maintain s satisfactory overall
course average. Second, stud-
ents will be granted defer-
ments only on the understand-
ing thet they will continue in

Militery Science through gred-

uation, with plans to enter the

Army as ea commissioned of-

Ficer.

Causes for this change in de-
ferment policy have been gen
laxities in the deferment system
which have enabled students to
obtain military deferments without

the deferment period ends.

ANNA RUSSELL AND HER "MAD NIGHT"

COME TO CHAMBERS

By TOM WARLICK

Anna Russell, famed internation-
al concert commedienne, will pre-
sent one of her “mad recitals”
here tonight at 8:15 P. M. in Cham-
bers Auditorium.

This brilliant satirist, who has
just completed a whirlwind trans-
continental tour, is currently ap-
pearing as a guest star on the Fred
Waring Television show.

Her “mad aight af the
opera” pregrem opens with ad-
view on song selection for con-
cert singers. For loud singers
with no brains she suggests
“~h Lover,” from the operet-
ta, “The Prince of Philadel-
phie.”

For singers with tremendous art-
istry but no voice: “Je n’ai pas la
Plume de ma Tante.” Con tempor-
ary music for tone-deaf singers:
“My Heart is Red.”

Fer the untrained singer: “1!
Gave My Love a Cherry.” For
the dramatic soprano: “Schre-
echenrauf.”

only those indispensable to the
liberal education of a free man to-
day were chosen.”

as well as constructive discussions should be of interest

The Week gets its official start
on Tuesday afternoon right after
drill, when the pledges of all fra
ternities will canvass the town and
campus for magazines and books
for use in the Mecklenburg Coun-
ty Home. It was learned that the
aged and infirmed of this home
have no library and very few popu-
lar books to help pass the long
hours.

In connection with this,
students ere requested to
round up all their old books
in the dorms that could pos-
sibly be used. This could in-
clude anything except math,
chemistry, physics, or highly
scientific and deep books.
Pledges will call at every
room for the books or maga-
zines.

Wednesday afternoon will find
the separate pledge classes work-
ing on projects of help to both the
college and community as well as
various places in Charlotte. The
Juvenile Delinquency School at
Charlotte will get some ping-pong
tables as well as a basketball back-
board, the Charlotte Mission will
be completely renovated by a
group, the fence painted up town,
and the land behind the business
district cleaned up.

On both Tuesday and Wednes-
day nights, there will be the usual
“exchange suppers” in which
pledge classes switch about to dine
with other fraternities and then
spend about thirty minutes after
the meal in the hosts house. This
will begin after the meal and last
until seven o'clock, thus placing
all suppers at six.

On Wednesday evening at
7:30, there will be held three
discussion groups at various
fraternity houses. At the Kap-
pa Sig house, boarding house
financing will be discussed as
s timely and significant pro-
biem: pledge training and
scholarship will be sired at
the SAE house; end slumni
relations will be the docket at
the Phi Gam house. It is ex-
pected that one member from
each fraternity be et each of
these groups and further sug-
gested that the member be

By FRANK

HANSHAW

An atmosphere of tension hung over tne smoked-filled
conference room at the’ College Union last Monday night as
Dr. W. G. McGavock presented the Faculty Fraternity Commit-
tee recommendation that next year’s freshman class be re-
quired to eat in the union cafeteria to forty fraternity repre-
sentatives. (The entire report is presented in the editorial

column on page two).

Drs. McGavock, Spencer, David-
son and Mr. Martin talked with
the fraternity representatives, who
included chapter presidents, IFC
members and boarding house man-
agers, for about two and a half
hours. The arguments grew more
heated as the seriousness of this
matter was clearly seen. All elev-
en national fraternities represent-
ed locally and the campus club
have consented to present their
feelings on the matter in consid-
eration of the Faculty Fraternity
Committee’s recommendation. Ex-
cerpts from letters written by fra-
ternity presidents to the David-
sonian are presented on page two.

Tuesday afternoon a_ student
committee ‘composed of Ernest
Barry, Frank Hanshaw and Law-
rence Erwin conferred with
Dr. J. R. Cunningham to ‘ob-
tain his views on the ques-
tion. Dr. Cunningham brought out
the fact that this move was not
meant to disrupt or de-emphasize
the fraternity system at Davidson.
He stated that the college was very
much in favor of fraternity life,
and aware of the important part
it plays in offering the student a
well-rounded education, and in ac-
complishing much good. He added,
however, that a great financial con-
sideration was involved because of
the necessity that the College
Union be self-supporting. In addi-
tion, Dr. Cunningham deplored the
lack of esprit de corps among
the four classes, the ill affects of
which continue after graduation.

Another point upon which Dr.
Cunningham laid emphasis had to
do with the freshman who does
not get a bid to a fraternity, or
for one reason or another does
not accept one. The idea was ad-
vanced that a student thus de-
prived of the opportunities of fra-
ternity life may be hindered ser-
iously in his adjustment to college,
and that the recommended change
would to an extent remove that
disadvantage by giving non-fra-
ternity men the opportunity of
close fellowship with their class-
mates. According to Dr. Cunning-
ham this should allow the fresh-
man to become better adjusted
than would otherwise be the case.

Dr. Cunningham concluded that
he had not. definitely made up his
own mind on the matter, since as

Books For Union
Sought By Group

Members of the faculty and
members of social fraternities and
the Campus Club are being asked
to contribute either books or
money to the College Union Lib-
rary,

The College Union Library is to
provide the best available leisure
reading and looking (pictorial al-
bums) at the disposal of a limited
budget.

Members of the faculty were
asked, in a letter dated February
2, to give either a book from their
respective fields which has ac-
curate information and yet popu-
lar appeal or seventy-five percent
of its list price in cash.

The social fraternities were ask-
ed, also in a letter dated February
2, to contribute five dollars to-
wards the purchase of books and
magazines for the Union. The goal
of these contributions, both facul-

ity and student, will be a fairly

complete, varied, and primarily en-
tertaining library in the College
Union.

In the case of both faculty con-
tributions of books or books
bought with cash contributions and
books bought with contributions
from the social fraternities, the
name of the donor will be inscrib-
ed on the bookplates of those vol-
umes purchased with the contribu-
tions.

Members of the College Union
Library Committee are: Larry Dag-
enhart, Alden Williams, Mac Bul-
gin, Rich Steck, Paul Alexander,
George Bason, Chuch Millard,
Mike Myers, Bob Mitchell, and
Tom Abel.

LAST CHANCE

If you have not taken advantage
of the chest X-ray unit, you may
do so on Saturday, February 7.

The mobile unit will be station-
ed all day in front of the bank and
will be available to all students,
as well as to all the townspeople of
Davidson.

A word to the Davidson student
is sufficient — only occasionally.

Let's improve the average.
