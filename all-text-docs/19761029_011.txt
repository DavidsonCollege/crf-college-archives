A HAGGARD ED ANDERSON sstarts to overtake an

opponent in the late stages of a cross country race.

Nag’s Nymphs blast Killer Watts 12-0:

By THE
BODACIOUS TA-TA’S

After a refreshing weekend
jaunt to the Congo, we are
sufficiently revitalized to pen
this week’s collection of mo-
mentous memorabilia.

Richardson II suffered a
biting case of night blindness
and was beaten into submis-
sion by Nocturnal Emission,
59-12. Led by Eddie ‘“‘Swish”’
Nicholson and Larry ‘‘The
Mort”’ Morton, the nightriders
were strongly offensive:

“THE MORT” avoided mo-
lesting defenseless cherry
trees long enough to catch
long pass after long pass from
the townie twosome of John
Ratliff and John Stroud, thus
quelling Richardson II’s feeble
efforts.

Porky Pig took a crip course
in EMBO 101. Expecting to
breeze through the course with
nary a blemish, the saucy
Porkers were astounded when
EMBOstar Peter ‘Pumpkin
Eater’ Green ‘caught the only
pass of his career in guiding
his team to an early TD.
Despite this early setback, the
swarthy swine aced the
course, 44-6.

Jealous of all the attention
ATO is getting, PDT #3 and
Fiji #8 did their best to lose to
each other. Despite their ef-
forts, at the end of regulation
time neither team had sub-
dued the other, and the fracas
led to a required overtime.

Fiji #8, to the mortification
of PDT #3, cranked up their
potent offense to produce the
narrow victory. One of our
field correspondents ascer-
tained that the combination of
the two teams might have lost
to the ATO’s.

The normally exuberant
Bongs appeared to have a
gnawing case of the blet as
they were decomposed by
PDT #1, 32-6. An anonymous
Bong was heard to complain,
‘The only reason we lost is
because our ship didn’t come
in.” :

Without: their pre-game sti-
muli, the Bongs were unchar-.
acteristically obnoxious in

their attempts to sway the
referees. Maybe they should
try reffing. They seemed to
know more than the refs.

The schmucks of Cannon II
proved to be easy prey for
SPE #2, as the SPE’s reduced
the frail freshman team to
twelve twerps a-twitching.

The final score: SPE #2 40-
twerps 6.

Kathy ‘‘Willin’’’ Wilson
scored both touchdowns as
Nag’s Nymphs short-circuited
Killer Watts, 12-0.

The win was attributed to
the peerless playing of ‘’Pre-
tentious’’Pat,— -‘‘Catchall’’

Cats finish 11th

By BRUCE HOLLIDAY
Sports Editor

Davidson’s cross country
squad traveled to Raleigh last
Saturday for the North Caro-
lina State meet and placed
eleventh in a strong field of
twelve teams.

Running without the ser-
vices of Jeff Morrow ord
Anderson the Wildcats had
little hope of a strong race.
Anderson was forced out of
the competition by a virus and
Mo;row sustained a knee in-
jury earlier in the year at
Appalachian State that kept
him out of the race.

Doug Horn once again fin-
ished first for the Davidson
squad with a time of 27:07
over the five-mile course. His
time, however, was only good

Kathy, “Voluptuous” Vicky,
“Vivacious” Virginia, ‘‘Sen-
sational’’ Susan, ‘‘More,
more’’Mariellen, ‘‘Resplen-
dent’’ Ruth, ‘‘Amorous’Ann
Gray, and ‘‘Nympho’”’ Nan.

In the trivia column, Ist
Watts and M&M’s tied 0-0 in
a meaningless muddling of
mobile metatarsals. The wail-
ing wimpettes refused to play
overtime. However, the ref-
eree team of Hay and Roberts
did a superb job, thanks to the
absence of their ref coach,
Graeme Thomson.

for an overall finish of 54th.

Zack Murrell, George Stro-
bel, and Tom Scott were the
next three finishers for the
Wildcats and placed in the
78rd, 76th, and 89th positions
respectively.

The meet was for any team
from North Carolina and
Coach Sterling Martin was
pleased with the squad’s per-
formance considering the com-
petition.

“It was far superior to last
year’s meet in terms of the
quality of competition. We
only finished eleventh which
was a disappointment for us,
but under the circumstances
we didn’t have much of a
chance,”’ said Martin.

Martin also noted that the
pace of race was surprisingly
fast. ‘‘A lot of people were

cunning 30 and 40 seconds
faster but finishing five or ten
places lower than last year.”

This year’s cross country
team is very young being
comprised of freshmen and
sophomores only. Martin feels
that his team needs the exper-
ience of this season’s difficult
schedule to develop into mat-
ure runners.

“Experience is very, very
important in races like this.
You've got to know what kind
of pace you can hold, when to
make a move, when not to
make a move and whether or
not to go out fast or hold back.
This sort of knowledge only
comes from a lot of racing.”
