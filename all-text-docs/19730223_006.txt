Duke Considers Gas Co-Op

Associated Students of Duke University (ASDU) is
considering a plan to provide cheap gasoline for Duke
students by establishing a gas co-op on campus. “The
Durham gas stations are rip-offs.’ Henry Beck,
ASDU vice-president, said in an interview. The cost of
regular gas has risen as_ high as 36 cents per gallon.

The Boyle family discuss the will with the la wver Bentham.

Last week I was part of the
hilarity of the World Premiere
in Charlotte of Johnny Cash's
film “The Gospel Road.” a
documentary on the life of
Christ. Amid the clamoring
throng my friends and I waited
for what turned out to be a full
fledged tarce if there ever was
one.

I admit I went as a joke
hoping to witness some of the
hysteria associated with those
fanfares of the 30's. but what
followed was beyond my wildest

fantasy. The marquee
displayed a_ collosal Johnny
Cash cut-out’ on the moun-
tainside while a_ local high

school band blurted the ‘Battle
Hymn of the Republic.”

A chorus’ appropriately
berobed in black injected
several appropriate gospel
hymns at the appropriate in-
tervals. Everyone was an-
ticipating the arrival of Cash
and coterie which pulled up
shortly with a police escort, the
siren blaring - the whole bit.

After shaking hands, Cash
mounted a make-shift platform
and addressed the mob a la

trom beneath her full length
swans down a la Marlene
Dietrich “I vish you love’).

Others who emerged trom the
limosine must have included
Cash's sister. the director
Robert Elfstrom. and Cash's
promotional manager. All had
parts in the tilm—and why not?

Inside. the president of Gard-
ner-Webb which sponsored the
gala affair preached a sermon.
It seems he and Cash were
predestined to present this film.

Cash addressed the audience
again, berating Hollywood tor
“all the filth it’s been turning
out’ and remarking how proud
he was of “that ‘G* on the sign
outside.”

At last the moment that all
had awaited arrived.

The words “Gospel Road”
flashed across the screen.

Cash, the narrator, had the
only speaking part with one
notable exception. There was
very little acting expected in
this homemade production, shot
on location in Israel. The
scenery in the latter may be
the one redeeming artistic
quality to be found.

speaking part.

The notable exception to Cash
is June Carter who as Marvy
Magdalene is an em-
barrassment.

She is allowed to belt out one
song “Follow Me.” in contrast
to 20 or so delivered by her
husband

The technical assistants must
have been imported trom Nash-
ville for surely Miss Carter's
make-up and the remnants of a
bouftant could not have been in-
spired trom Biblical passages

The extras complete the at-
mosphere. the men with their
side ourns and duck tails and
the women with their gum and
beehives

how it would end. However my
triends reported a grizly scene
when Eltstrom was nailed in-
discreetly to a cross. Blood was

taste) was spared

and subsidiary of ASDU. Whatever money ASDU
would make from the co-op would go to the Student
Academic Loan Fund. Establishment of the co-op
would require a $10,000 initial investment by ASDU in
its ‘73-74 budget. Beck said, ‘The co-op would quickly
return the $10,000 to students through cheaper gas and

more financial aid.”

New Meal Plans Adopted

The University of Montana recently adopted a com-
bination of optional meal plans for the current
academic year. The optional plans were recom-

mended by

a_ student-administrative

committee

assigned to investigate possible variations on the 20-
meal plan previously offered.

The new food service options, available to all
students residing in the residence halls on campus, in-
clude: (1) a 20-meal plan which includes all meals ex-
cept Sunday evening meal, (2) a 15-meal plan which

includes breakfast.

lunch,

and dinner (Monday

through Friday only), and (3) a 10-meal plan which
includes lunch and dinner ‘Monday through Friday

only).

The respective costs of the three meal plans and
double-room occupancy in residence halls during the
fall quarter are $353.11 for the 20-meal plan, $327.50
for the 15-meal plan, and $307.16 for the 10-meal plan.
