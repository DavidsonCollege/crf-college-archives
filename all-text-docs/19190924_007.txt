Caleb Richmond Harding was born at
Charlotte, N. C., in 1861. He entered
Davidson in 1876, graduating in 1880
with the degree of A. B. From 188t to
1887, he spent his time teaching. and
doing post-graduate work at Johns Hop-
kins Universityy. He was professor of
Greek at Hampden-Sidney College for
a part of this time. In 1887 he receiv-
ed the Ph.D. degree from Johns Hop-
kins University and in 1889 he was
elected professor of Greek and German
at Davidson. He has thus served the
college longer than any other present
member of the faculty, this being the
thirteenth consecutive year of his faith-
ful and conscienttous work for the col-
lege.

Not only in the classroom has Dr.
Harding served the college, but as chair-
man of the press committee of the fac-
ulty he has rendered a service that is
quite unique. Only those who know the
arduous character of press work can
appreciate the difficulty of maintaining,
as he has, the interest necessary for suc-
cess. We all see frequently the results
of his work, but few of the students
have realized that the whole burden of
that work rests on the shoulders of Dr.
Harding. ;

For his long service, his untiring ef-
forts in all lines, and his interest in his
students, Dr. Harding is recognized as
filling a position of singular usefulness
in the life of the college.

Dr. Harding ranks high among the
alumni of Davidson, who have devoted
their lives to the cause of Christian ed-
ucation,

It will be of interest to alumni to
learn that Dr. J. W. MacConnell. for-
mer professor of Biology and college phy-
sician,at Davidson, has returned to Da-
vidson on sick leave from U. S. General
Hospital No. 2, at Fort McHenry, Md.
He has been undergoing treatment there
for injuries received at Camp Jackson
heforafhe went across. It is hoped that
he will soon recover entirely and receive
his discharge from the army, in order
that he may again resume his work at
Davidson.
