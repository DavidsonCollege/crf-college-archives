Plans for College day care
currently being considered

Teach for America reps

Bright Horizons to discuss logistics of venture

By RACHEL EGAN

Faculty members are getting excited about
the possible creation of a daycare center on
Davidson’s campus in the near future.

Amaris Surmacz, director of client services
for Bright Horizons Family Solutions Inc., an
employer-sponsored child care company, will
come to Davidson on Nov. 17 to get feedback
from the school and the community about the
need for a site in town.

Her visit may clear up the present questions
about the length of the construction process and
the cost of the project.

According to their webiste, Bright Horizons
Family Solutions is “the partner of choice for
more than 400 clients, in-
cluding 84 of the Fortune
500.” Bright Horizons cur-
rently operates 14 sites in
North Carolina, three of
which are in Charlotte.

The administration
looked at a proposal to build
a center on campus about
10 years ago, but this time,
says President Bobby Vagt,
“We're serious about this.”

The reason the proposal
to build a daycare center on
campus has been taken up
again by the administration
centers around the need for
more programs. The
Davidson-Cornelius daycare
center has now reached capacity, ‘after only
being in operation for a decade. Building a
center on campus would have created competi-
tion back then, but now there is a real need for
additional childcare options.

While the Davidson-Cornelius center serves
children ages two years and older, the growing

number of faculty with infants develops a need
for a more comprehensive daycare center.

Bright Horizons Daycare would provide for
this need. “We have working parents among our

faculty— they want access to daycare,” said
Vagt.

Assistant Professor of Sociology Gayle
Kaufman, who has two children, ages 3-years-
old and 7-weeks, was thrilled with the possibil-

ity. “Having a daycare center on campus would

be great,” she said. “Daycare is definitely an

issue for a lot of the faculty.”
Assistant Professor of Anthropology Helen
Cho has 5-month old twin girls, and her hus-

band is currently staying at home to take care of
them. They are facing the imminent problem of

finding a local daycare center without a waiting

list.

Cho agreed with Professor Kaufman that the
on-campus aspect of the daycare center would
be ideal not only for flexibility and visiting
reasons, but also for peace of mind. “I would
have more trust in a college-affiliated daycare
than elsewhere.”

finish fall application drive

About two.weeks ago, Davidson’s fall
_application drive for, Teach for America
finished.

The campaign coordinators, Elizabeth
Devlin ’04 and Mary Carpenter ’04, said 20
seniors applied. Teach for America, a
national non-profit organization, strives to
end educational inequity in the United
States.

“T’ve had different experiences working
with children of all socioeconomic
statuses,” Carpenter said.

“It’s amazing—the difference between
their education.”

To further their goal of eliminating such
problems, the group hires recent college
graduates to teach for two years in low-
income urban or rural settings.

Teach for America locates students
willing to run campaigns on their college
campuses to generate interest and
knowledge of its program.

At Davidson, Devlin and Carpenter

organized a booth at the career fair, an.

information session and much advertising
throughout the campus.

To prepare for the next deadline in
February, the coordinators explained they
will have an “alumni blitz week” and plan
to have three or four Davidson and Teach
for America alumni speak to interested
students.

Nationwide, 3000 current members teach
at about 100 schools, according to Devlin.

“Right now they have about 20 sites, and
they’re expanding. If you’re interested,
you can pretty much go wherever you
want,” Carpenter said.

According to Carpenter, while most
people who enter the program do not want
to go into education, Teach for America
lends many opportunities to alumni.

“A lot of grad schools and law schools
and med schools know what Teach for
America is. It has acompetitive application
process. [Schools and employers] know
you had to have something great about you
to be selected for Teach for America,”
Carpenter said.

Teach for America applicants can request
where, which grade and what subject they
want to teach. Within four weeks of
submitting the written application,
candidates know whether the program
accepted them.
