he’s working on the railroad track,
The boy that sat next to me put,
‘No’ on every other sentence and
then filled the rest up with ‘Yes.’
He got a swell mark. T read so slow
I only got four done before the
time was up. I get so tired bein’
hurried all the time! Look at ’at—
a tree, a fish, a cake’ of ice. At
first it was so funny I tore out the
page and kept it. See, three pictures
I'll read what it tells you to do:
}—a tree, a fish, and a cake of ice.
\‘John is ten years old and his sis-
ter is eight. If John is not Mary’s
i brother draw a line from the fish
to the cake of ice. If Mary and
| John are twins, write your middle
}name under the tree; and, if you
have no middle name, put zero
there, If they are not twins, print
your last name on the tree. If
Mary is younger than John, write
the Roman number eight in the
lupper left-hand of the paper; but,
if John is older than Mary, draw
a cat in the lower right-hand cor-
}ner, If they both go to school, write
your full name at the bottom of
the paper.’ I'm never sure just how

to spell my name, so I didnt even
try this one.

they always seem to fit the wrong
questions. Anyway, everything's
changin’ all the time! So, what's
the use of learnin’ a lotta things
today when, maybe, they won't be
true by tomorrow? I know a heap
of things Miss Brown don't know

—like where: to. find birds’ nests
and how to fix a leaky pipe and
what the baseball scores are. She
