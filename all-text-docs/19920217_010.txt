Davidson Players to Perform
Unique Rendition of Antigone

By Mary McNeil
and Jeff Terrell

Although one may think of
solemn, stoic acting without much
variation in a production of Greek
tragedy, this could not
be further. from the
truth when describing
the theatre depart-
ment’s upcoming ver-
sion of the Greck trag-
edy of Sophocles’ An-
tigone. The play’s
director, Alex Pink-
ston, has actually
compiled his own
adaptation of the play
and has incorporated
much interpretive,
modern dance per-
formed chiefly by the
chorus. In addition,
music from actual
ancient Greek songs
has been added. Ac-
tors perform the music through
singing as well as through the use
of instruments such as drums,
strings, flute, and recorder played

by Frank Jernigan, David Tweedie,
Valerie Whitlock, Tim Ogden, and
Carey Morton.

Especially interesting aspects
of the production include occa-
sional use of masks, unique cos-
tuming, and the use of flashbacks.
The costumes are based on a tradi-
tional Greek idea which is to clothe
the body so that the outline of male
and female body forms may be
visible to the audience. Pinkston
achieves this affect through much
use of spandex and flowing, sheer
scarves. Players wear spandex

whichare left open, revealing their
bodies. In addition, the actors
perform with bare feet. Flash-
backs have been incorporated into

SOPHOCLES’

this production so as to dramatize
certain pertinentactions and to help
the audience with the history.
Examples of flashbacks include
Oedipus killing his father Laius
and Eteocles and Polynices fight-
ing each other for Thebes.

The stage itself has been al-
tered in order to expand the play-
ing space and to improve the audi-
ence’s sight lines. The stage has
been extended into the audience,
and there is also the rare use of a
raked or slanted stage. In addition,
lighting effects are unique and
detailed with the use of rear pro-
jections and patterned lighting
designs. The scene designer who
has collaborated with Pinkston on

these as well as other interesting
aspects of stage design is Ronnie
Higdon. Belinda Hidgon is the
props/costume designer who has
designed the masks as wellas vari-
ous combat proper-
ties. Jeff Terrell, a
junior theatre major,
is the stage manager;
theatre 101 students
are helping in many
offstage facets of the
production.

The title role is
performed by Sarah
Robinson, a senior
who may be remem-
bered best for her per-
formance in the title
tole ofHedda Gabler.
Buck Reese, a senior
theatre major, carries
the role of King
Creon. Other actors
include Carey Mor-
ton as Ismene, Ed Cunningham as
the Sentinal, Laius, and other roles,
David Tweedie as Haemon, Teire-
sias, and other roles, Christina
Lopez-Ibanéz ‘as“Eurydicé and a
chorus member, Frank Jernigan as
the chorus leader and player of the
percussion instruments, and Tim
Ogden as the Page and a chorus
member. The other chorus mem-
bers are Scott Lanhart, Valerie
Whitlock, Constanza Jaramillo,
Katharina Altpeter, Colleen
Camaione, Becky Hunter, Tate
Gardner, and Elizabeth
Thornberry. Worth noting is the
fact that the chorus members play

Rush Grimly Portrays Drug Underworld

By Will Montgomery
“Rush” chronicles the descent
of a veteran agent and his rookie
partner into the narcotics under-
ground of Houston, Texas in the
mid 1970’s. The main story cen-
ters upon the partnership between
a sexy rookie and the gritty vet-
eran. Jason Patrick refreshingly
delivers a complex performance
without too much Hollywood grit.
Jennifer Jason Leigh is the sexy
rookie, but has been toacting school
since “Fast Times at Ridgemont
High” and delivers a tense, confi-
dent performance.
Patrick’s job requires him to
buy drugs from heroin, cocaine,
methamphetamine, and marijuana
dealers. During deals, Patrick must
often cross the line of legality and
‘sample the product to prove that he
is not a cop. Patrick’s character
admits to his new rookie that
sampling the drugs is dangerous,
but preferable to getting killed ina
bad deal.

What follows is a mesmeris-
ing spiral downward as Leigh’s
innocent eyes widen to the horrors
of the drug culture. At first Leigh
keeps her distance, but soon she
must prove herself in the field. She
quickly learns the rituals of shoot-
ing up or snorting coke and before
long they are skirting a fine line
between undercover work and
addiction.

The clear strength of this movie
lies in the love relationship be-
tween Leigh and Patrick and the
friendship they build with their
main drug connection. The careful
line they must walk between at-
traction/loyalty and aversion/be-
trayal creates a hellish tension
deftly exploited through the body
of the film.

There were problems in the
film. In the first twenty minutes
during the establishment of the
relationships the dialogue was
horrible. The film formula of
“buddy cops + jaded stud meets

Bambi=hotsex by the first third of
the movie” seemed so predictable
that for a while the film peered
over the brink of a sad void of
cliched sex, drugs, handguns, sex,
and drugs.

Yet the freakish pantheon of
slimy but intriguing dealers kept
the narrative interesting. In fact,
there is very little graphic sex in
the movie, but instead a horrifying
subversion of sexual tension within
the dealer exchanges. Their blood-
shot eyes often stare at Leigh,
hinting that she is a gunshot away
from having a dead parmer and
being violently raped. The psy-

’ chological tension of “Rush” was

so well developed at times that it
almost became unbearable.
The movie is worth seeing for

its view into this underworld. It is

depressing and sick, but human as
well. The beginning drags and the
end seems hastily done, but the
body of the film is an accomplish-
ment.

Matt Bumstead

~ Well, last week we looked at

the top ten women in country
music; this week, we’ll tackle the
guys. Garth Brooks will not be
eligible for this ranking, however
(that would be boring). The com-
petition among males is, how-
ever, very tough. Last week, [left
out (on some people’s top ten)
K.T. Oslin; I seriously doubt you
will all agree with this list. The
rankings do take, several factors,
intoconsideration, butoneof those
is my personal opinion. . .

1. George Strait - - What a
career he has had. Eleven years in
the business, several Male Vocal-
ist of the Year trophies, and En-
tertainer of the Year awards in
1989 and 1990, heisan incredible
force in the industry. His live
show is absolutely dynamite, and
his thoroughly entertaining rec-
ords hit the top with astounding
consistency. He has even been
named one of People’s “50 Most
Beautiful People”... Whata guy.

2. (Tie) Vince Gilland Alan
Jackson - - Two performers of
remarkable versatility, and two of
the very finest singer songwriters
around, its just too hard to choose
between them. Gill also one of
Nashville’s finest instrumental-
ists, has won many awards in the
last two years, including a
Grammy and the CMA’s Male
Vocalist, Single and Song of the
Year. Jackson, however, has the
greater amount of number one
songs to hiscredit, and isastronger
radio’ presence. So, take your
pick.

4, Ricky Van Shelton - - His
beautiful baritone voice can light
up the fast songs and fill ballads
with pathos. He has been the
fans’ choice for Male Vocalist of
the Year for three years in a row,
and forEntertainer of the Year for
the last two years. His last three
songs have been number ones;
and the man from Grit, Virginia is
looking to gain more attention for
himself nationally and challenge

for the top spot.

Good Ole Boys

5. Clint Black - - This is gen-
erous, as far as the present is con-
cerned. Two years ago, he was on
top. Suddenly, he has all but dis-
appearéd from the airwaves, He
is an immensely talented writer
and performer; but unless he does
something soon, the Houston boy

will become old news way before

his prime.

: Randy Trayis ; - He still
it the hit songs, and-he still
packs them in at concert halls. |
But Randy is no longer Nash-
ville’s big man. I doubt he’s too
hurt by, the whole thing; he’s still
raking in plenty of money and
will be considered one of coun-
try’s biggest acts for many years
to come.

7. Travis Tritt - - This rank-
ing may be too low for Tritt, but
watch for him to keep climbing.
His gritty delivery and clever
songwriting have earned him a
large following, and deservedly
so. He was last year’s Horizon
(Best New Artist) Award winner,
and his songs keep getting bigger.
His music is solid and entertain-
ing.

8. Doug Stone - - His last
three singles have hit the top in-

cluding his most recent, “Juke-

box With A Country Song”. He
hasarich voice and can growland
swing with the best of them, but it
is the sad song or the ballad where
Doug Stoneisa produceone
of the most powerful effects any-
where in music. He sounds great
live but is a little awkward in his
appearance when he performs.
Doug Stone has built a very solid
foundation with which he can
insure his place in country for
some time.

9. Joe Diffie - - Once we get
tothis level, itbecomes extremely

difficult to determine who should

fill these last two spots. The
amount of strong new talent, so
many of them with at least one
