been confined in the Infirmary during the
past week,

Thomas Laffery, of the Fresh class, is
very much improved in the eye, ear, nose and
throat hospital in Charlotte. Laffery had a
very serious accident to his eye. It was
thought for a while that he would lose sight
in that eye, but it seems now that medical
skill is going to be able to save it.

That, at the Davidson-Carolina game in
1909, there were only 15 visiting young ladies

on the Hill.

That, during the same year, class football
was the rage and rivalry between the classes
ran high, a cup being given to the champion-
ship team.

That, in 1910, with the addition of 150
“Standard Songs,” a large choir with piano
and cornet accompanists, the exercises at
chapel were vastly improved,

That, in 1910 the college opened with 329
students, the Senior class having 59, from
which came the largest graduating class in
the history of college at that date. There

were among the students a Scotehman, any
+ Englishman, two married men, a man from
Brazil, Japan, and Persia, and last but not

That Davidson evidently used to be a
“wild and woolly” place back in 1888, as a
clipping from the college magazine of that |
year reads: “Ladies should no longer fear
wild beasts and robbers when coming out of
jchureh at night, for 15 or 20 of our most
valiant boys have volunteered their services
to see that no one is hurt. The company
forms immediately after the benediction.”

That, during the same year, Dr, Shearer,
former president of Davidson, gave a reeep-
tion for the Freshmen, and cach Freshman
was required to bring a girl.

That, in 1898, Commodore Dewey's report
of his overwhelming victory at Manila Bay

order of the night. The Davidson Reserves,
acting as escort, led the student body all over
town, visiting the houses of the professors,
all of whom responded to the call with war-
like and enthusiastic speeches,
