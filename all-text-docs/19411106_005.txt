Question ot 3

The Week

With the Homecoming Set

a member of the large group of suc

now

cessful Davidson Dancés, and show-|

ing a neat profit in the bank, every-
one has been speculating as to who
will provide the music for the Mid- |

Winters. Therefore the question of }

t SPONSORS

the week is: Who or what type}
of band do you want for Mid-
Winters.

Charles Brockmann, Sophomore: |

It would be fine if the Pan-Hel-
lenic Council cleared enough on the
Homecoming Dances to get a real
“name band” for Mid-Winters. One
the of Spivak
should appeal to those who like rhy-

on order Charlie
thm as well as the devotees of the

soft and sweet.

Ralph Dunn, Sophomore : ‘

I should like to see either Sunny
Dunham or Vaughn Monroe. Both
of these bands are “tops’ because
they are able to play both sweet
and smooth with a little swing
mixed Durham played an en-
gagement at the Meadowbrook and
made a big hit, and Monroe: has
made some “swell” records.

John McGee, Junior:

It seems to me that another band
like Charlie Spivak's suit
the student body very well. That
type of orchestra has enough fast
music to satisfy the jitterbug, and

enough of sweet too for
rest of us.

-Vaughn Monroe.
Dick Kelly, Senior:

Due to the fact that the price of
orchestras has risen this year, and
it seems both impossible and im-
practical for the Pan-Hellenic Coun-
cil to get a band like Tommy Dor-
sey’s for Mid-Winters, I would like
to have Charlie Spivak back for
that set. He went over in a big}
way at Spring Frolics last year and
gave us one of the best dances in
years. He plays the type of music
that we like at Davidson.

Glenn Terrell, Senior:

The widely-toured Briarhoppers,
with their guitar and jews harp en-
semble and their harmonica™~ har-

mony, would be more than appro-
priate for a Davidson dance. There
is only one reason why it would be
impractical to secure this group of
_harmonizing “hep-cats”, namely,
that the Pan-Hell. Council would-
n't clear over thousand dol-
lars. However, I deem it time for

this Council to make some sacrifices
to the ‘“floor-polishers” and give us
a big name band.

Ned Pollick, Junior:

In my opinion, Sunny Dunham
would be an excellent choice for a
Mid-winters band. One jof his ar-
dangers was formerly \connected
with Jimmy Lunsford, and his style
typifies this breat band. He
definitely-an-the-up-grade;-and.the
council could easily meet his price,
as in the case of Bob Chester the
years before last.

Morton Church, Junior : |

Jim Chapman, Junior:

Personally I would like to see us
get Eddy Duchin with T. Dorsey as
a second choice. At the 1940 Caro-
lina Finals Duchin was liked better |
at the dance than was a Mr. Glenn|
Miller. He features the sweet and}
slow type dance music which has
become more prevalent here. So
let’s see the good Pan-Hell get the
Piano master for the Winter Set. |

Bill Faison, Senior:

I would like to see Davidson. step |

out and really throw a big dance set |
with a band such as Tommy Dor- |
sey’s oroGlenn Miller. We have al- |
ways had swell bands, but never the |
biggest name bands due to lack
of funds and competition of some
other big schools. I would like to
have the students pledge to the Pan
Hellenic Council their support, no
