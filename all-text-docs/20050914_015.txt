’°Cats split games at Wildcat Classic

By JAMES WILL
Staff Writer

The women’s soccer team,
now off to a 2-4 start on the
season, spent last weekend at
Northwestern University in
Evanston, IL, playing in the
Wildcat Classic.

Though Davidson began
well on Friday, winning the
first of two games by shutting
out Kent State 3-0, they fol-
lowed with a loss to host
Northwestern on Sunday.

Led by co-captain Kara
Koehrn ’06, who scored two
early goals against Kent State,
and goalkeeper Bevin English
’08, the team put together'two
well played halves of soccer,
leading to their second win of
the season. Jenny Soldano ’06
added a Davidson’s third goal
at the end of the first half to
put the score at 3-0 going into
the locker room.

Neither team would score
for the remainder of the game.
With a career high 10 saves,
the shutout would be
English’s first as a Wildcat.

The consistency between
halves that the team showed
versus Kent State is exactly what coweh Greg
Ashton wants to see.

“We need to work on getting two consis-
tent halves per game if we want to win. It is
very tough to win if you lack consistency,”
he said.

It was the first match-up ever for Davidson

Kara Koehrn ’06, shown here in a game on Aug. 28th vs. Wake
Forest, had two of the ’Cats three goals in a 3-0 win at Kent State.

and Kent State.

The second game of the weekend for
Davidson pitted them against tournament
host Northwestern on Sunday afternoon.
Northwestern, a member of the Big 10 con-
ference, came into the game with a 4-1
record and a lot of talent.

Play was evenly balanced
between the two teams in the
first half, and Davidson
“extremely well and tough,”
said Ashton.

Though the score was tied
entering the second half, the
*Cats were unable to dupli-
cate the strong first half and
fell 3-0 to Northwestern,
who outshot the ’Cats 15-9.
Two of the three goals for
NU came from the outside,
while a third resulted from a
penalty kick halfway
through the second period.

The lack of consistency, as
well as missing key opportu-
nities to finish, ultimately
doomed the Wildcats in this
game.

“We didn’t deserve to lose
by three the way we played,
but Northwestern took
advantage of a few key
opportunities while we did
not. They are a very good
team, though, and we battled

them to the very end,”
Ashton said.
“The Davidson soccer

team is constantly improv-
ing,” said Koehrn. “I think
we realize now that, although we came out of
the weekend a bit of a surprising 1-1, we
could have definitely been 2-0 in the tourna-

* ment. The team is pretty excited about hav-

ing a home game after two weekends away.”

This weekend, Davidson will host a pair of
games against UNC-Wilmington on Friday
and Colorado College on Sunday.

stood at 2-0.

When the ‘Cats retumed to the pitch, they
continued to batter the Campbell keeper with
shots. Mac Wilkie ’07 came close to scoring
in the box, but he could not finish. Finally,
co-captain David Sartorio ’06 made his way
through the defense to assist Robby Hoak,
who scored his third goal this year.

Allen almost added another a few minutes
later, but the ball was recovered by a Camel
defender. The ’Cats would not get another
chance for the remainder of the game.
Davidson will travel to yet another away
match to play UCF on Friday and will return
