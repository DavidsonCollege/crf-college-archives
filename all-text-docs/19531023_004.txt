THE DAVIDSONIAN

MAKING YEAR’S PLANS [BROWNELL AGENTS | Uphold Machiavelli

Davidson's military minded
juntors and seniors, those who com-
prise the local chapter of Scabbard
and Blade, have big plans which
should give them another success-
ful year. They should make appre-
clable progress toward their pro-
fessed goal—‘to place Scabbard
and Blade in its rightful rank
(among other Davidson extra-cur-
ricular societies) on campus and
develop better working coordina-
tion between the military and other
related college activities.” First
Sargeant Hasty has great con-
fidence in the organization.

This year Capt. Lamon, chief of-
ficer of the society, will attend the
national convention of Scabbard &
Blade. This is a blue feather in
the society's cap as well as Capt.
Lamon’s.

Tuesday, November 3, at the
drill exercises, the annual tapping
ceremony will take place. Those
advanced ROTC students having
maintained an overall B average
in ROTC and a C-plus average in
their other studies, and who show
military leadership, will be
honored that day.

This year’s officers include Bud-
dy Lamon as captain; Tom Ligon,
first Heutenant and program chair-
man; Bill Morris is second lieu-
tenant, and Charlie Hasty, the re-
cording secretary is first sargeant.

The Scabbard and Blade has
serious plans this year. They are

giving a scholarship award to the
most outstanding student in the
society and also plan to organize
a rifle team. As in years gone by,
the local Red Cross blood drive
will be sponsored by Scabbard and
Blade this spring. On their agenda
for the remaining fall term are
the following: .

October 27—Talk by Lt. Lamar
on the mission of the 7th Army in
Germany.

November 10 — A film on “The
Effects of Atomic Explosions.”

November 24—Initiation of new
members.

December 8—Reports from na-
tional convention; a fiim on “Tur-
key.”

January 12—Talk by Prof. Wil-
son on “The Part of the Scottish
Soldier Played in the Development
of the British Empire.

The Brownell Travel. Bureau of
Birmingham, Ala., has announced
the appointment of Mr. Grier Mar-
tin and Dr. Samuel R. Spencer,
Jr., as representatives at David-
son for the Brownell Tours, oldest
private tour service in America.

A motor coach tour of eight
European countries will be offered
next summer and will be directed
by Mr. and Mrs. Martin. It is
planned that a similar tour will be
offered the following summer by
Dr. and Mrs. Spencer. Ten places
on the 1954 tour have been re-
served for Davidson College stu-
dents, the other 15 places to be
filled by girls and boys from other
colleges,

The tour, leaving New York on
June 4 and returning on July 28,
is one of the most economical
European tours offered by any
service, Its cost of $8995.00 includes
all expenses except shipboard tips
and purely personal expenses. The
trip across the Atlantic is made
on the Italia, (formerly the Kungs-
holm), and travel in Europe is
largely by motor coach, providing
a better opportunity for seéing na-
tive homes, farms, villages, and
out of the way places on the way
to and from great cities.

Experienced English speaking
guides are furnished for sight-
seeing in England, Holland, Bel-
gium, Germany, Switzerland, Italy
and France. Four days will be spent

Professor B. D. Thompson, as-
sisted by Dr. E. O. Guerrant, will
lead an after-vesper discussion on
the topic “Power, Morality, and
Foreign Policy” this Sunday night
in the Student Lounge of the Col-
lege Church. The discussion is de-
signed as preparation for the com-
ing YMCA Fall Forum. Prof.
Thompson will advocate ghe mod-
ern Machiavellian position implicit
in much of the present day inter-
national politics. Students are chal-
lenged to articulate their own con-
victions, but are warned that in-
tellectual excommunication and/or

decapitation are possible conse-|-

quences of the careless statement
or the baseless prejudice. Dr. Guer-
rant, no Savonarola himself, will
act as Thompson's second in their
presentation of “Realpolitik” for
the Davidson man. Coffee and do-
nuts will be served to all irrespec-
tive of personal political or moral

conviction.
_

in London, four days in Paris, and
three days each in Rome, Florence,
and Lucerne. .

Students interested in consider-
ing this tour or any of the many
others offered by Brownell may
secure additional information from
Mr. Martin or Dr. Spencer.

When asked for a statement from
the editor, Bill Hood scratched his
head, put on his best intellectual
face, and uttered: “Since the first
Quips and Cranks published in
1897 the annual has improved
down through the years. It has
progressed from a collection of tin-
types to the modern photoengraved
production that it now is. I hope
this year's annual will continue
this stream of progress and will
be the best of the serfes.”

a new concept for Harvard—more
emphasis would be placed on gen-
eral education.

All students at Harvard now are
required to take three elementary
courses chosen from these three
areas: humanities, social sciences
and natural sciences.

The Columbia University plan,
embodied in a report published in
1946, “Columbia Program in Ac-
tion,” also limited the freedom of
choice available to freshmen and
sophomores. The college prescribed
courses in the humanities, sciences
and social studies. This is a plan
with a triangular base, consisting
of a contemporary civilization
course, humanities and _ science.
Every freshman is required to take
this two-year sequence. The ob-
jectives of the program is to pro-
vide each student with a broad
foundation in the chief fields of
knowledge.

In. the changes adopted at Har-
vard, Princeton and Columbia, as
well as many other institutions,
runs one significant:thread. The
unlimited, free elective system of
a quarter of a century ago has
been modified and in some in-
stances virtually eliminated. What
is sometimes described as the
“cafeteria” system of education —
in which one takes an educational
dish here and another at the far
end of the counter—appears to be
on the way out. The late Nicholas
Murray Butler af Columbia des-
cribed the free elective system as a
“rabbit” program in which the stu-
dent hopped about the educational
garden, nibbling a carrot, samp-
ling a turnip or stopping at a
head of cabbage. When it was all
over, would the student come up
with a well-balanced menu or
would he get indigestion or suf-
fer from malnutrition? -

Another thing which endeared
Charlie to the Homecoming crowd
was his remark at the opening of
the Saturday concert after the
heartbreaking loss to P.C. earlier,
that “I don't think you want to be
talked to much this afternoon, so
we'll just get on with the show.”
But it didn't take long for Charlie,
his trumpet, and “Small Paul”
O'Connor with his “Don't Roll
Those Bloodshot Eyes at Me,” and
“when the Saints Go Marching In,”
to bring the crowd around.
