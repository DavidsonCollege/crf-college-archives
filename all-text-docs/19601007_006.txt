that there would be a tendency
to spend too much time prepar-
ing for the comprehensives .. .
rather than trying to under-
stand the. interdependence and
interrelatedness of economics.”

Or. Lilly, head of the Eng
Nsh department, stated, “I
think thet comprehensive ex-
aminations are a good thing
provided they are well con-
ducted. In order to have them
well conducted, the teachers
must hold up a high standard

and require mature work.”
He also felt that it would be

ers.

ship, has issued a challenge to

any student who feels strong- |

ly enough about pacifism to de-
fend it.

An informal debate has been
planned as a program for the
latter part of November, at
which time a student and a
faculty member or outsider will
defend each side. The question
to be considered will be “Can
a Christian Kill?”

“Rather than approach some-
one who has his doubts, but
still has not made up his mind
on this issue,” said Arnold, “I
would like to find a student who
has considered the question
and feels strongly enough to
defend it.

“There may not be such a
student on this campus. but
1 hope that if there is one, he
will not hesitate to speak up.

Correspendence is being car-
ried on with a faculty member
and ah outsider, both outstand-
ing persons, who will also be
defending each side. Any stud-
ent interested in making a de-
fense of either side should con:

the end of the junior year, ad-
administered by the Graduate
Record Examinations. He felt
that from theJresults of these
exams, that tbe student could
tell where hé-/needed to con-
cenrate in his senior year.

Dr. Abernethy, of the philo-
sophy department, declined to
voice his opinion of compre-
hensives at this time. He said
that he was planning to visit
five colleges in the midwest in
late October and that he would
make a statement after he re-
turned.

Phi Elects Officers,
Plans Programs

“The Philanthropic Society's
programs this semester will be
based on controversial topics,”
stated Allen Wells, newly-elect-
ed president of the society.

For the first program of the
semester this past Monday
night. Wells delivered’ a talk
about Communist literature.
This was the first program of
a two part series concerning
education. The second part of
the series will be a talk by Joe
Markee entitled. ‘The Sterile
Value of Education.”

Wells said that other pro-

n-|8tams for the semester include

a review of: Phillip Wylie's

cause the caliber of our stu-
dents isn’t that high.”

Henry McFayden, second
highest academically, felt that
comprehensives could make a
real contribution if they were
based on all four years of study.
He said that he thought it would
be better if the professors make

up the tests:

Henry Shue, president of the |

Gavin Stirs Criticism

By Chapel

Statement

Robert Gavin's visit to Davidson last week and the
remarks the Republican gubernatorial candidate made
in an answer to a question following his chapel address
caused a great deal of comment in newspapers through-

out the state.

The issue which has caused
the comment is Gavin's denial
of endorsing the educational
program espoused by the Unit-
ed Forces for Education.

Charles Rose asked Gavin

why he denied endorsing the
UFE’s program when he had
endorsed an identical program
set forth by the North Carolina
Education Association. .

Gavin replied thet the UFE
statement conteined a defi-
nite time limit for meeting
the proposals and thet the
NCEA program made no ref-
erence to @ specific time lim-
it. ¢
Gavin's statement was printed

in the Charlotte Observer the
following morning. Wednesday
afternoon the headquarters of
Terry Sanford, Gavin's oppon-
ent in the election. issued a
statement asking if Gavin was
just confused or if he even
knew what the UFE stood for.
The Sanford statement. also
said that Gavin had mislead
the Davidson students by say-
ing he hadn't endorsed the
UFE program.

In a, news article appearing
in the October 5, Charlotte Ob-
server, there is the statement:
“Gavin in April had fully en-
dorsed a program outlined in
a questionaire sent him by the
North Carolina Education As-
sociation Journal. The question-
naire was the UFE program
verbatim, NCEA authorities
said, although it did not carry
the label.

Rose revealed to THE DAV-
IDSONIAN late this week
that he hed been contacted
by a close friend of Sanford’s
on the day before Gavin
spoke here. The “friend”

porters in the student body

ask Gavin about his statement

referring to the state Demo-
cratic machine as being fike

Castro’s government. He also

suggested the question about

the UFE education program.

Rose said, “Just because
people in North Carolina are
displeased with the way the Na-
tional Democratic Party is
treating them is no reason to
throw out of office the able
Democratic state government
we have now and replace it
with an inexperienced Repub-
liean ticket.

“I think Gavin is an extreme-
ly personable sort of fella but
his many contradictory state-
ments show that he doesn’t
fully understand the complex
job of state government in
North Carolina.”

in the afternoon, Ruth—

ers and puts them on the
tables.

Ruth watches three men at
a nearby table. One well-known
talker roars in laughter, and
Ruth grins. “Lawsy me," she
says.

She’s a singing Ruth at times,
but usually looks around lazily,
popping her chewing gum—ex-
cept for an occasional burst of
eloquence:

“lm going to break my
back this day. Veah, | am.
Too hard on me, Can't find

mess!”

Ruth carries the tray into
the kitchen, “Where’s the tfa-
dio, somebody? Let’s have some
music.

Coming back to the front, she
calls through the window as
sweetly as she can, “Charlie,
you g0ing to scrub for me?”
Charlie says no.

“Can't find nobody to do no-
thing for me,” says Ruth as she
goes after a mop.

Ruth was going to get mar-
ried. She didn‘t.

But Ruth shows her greatest
charms when she waits:on an
elderly tady.

One thing is sure ebout un-
predictable Ruth these days.
She is going to stay on the
ball. She likes it better et
the counter where she makes
milkshakes instead of in the
kitchen making salads.

Ruth is frank about religion.
One student was getting supper
one Friday night. Two meats

were served. He chose the fish.
“You're a Jew,’ she said.

A sophomore bolted into
the Union and enthusiastical-
ly called, “Hey, Ruth!” Ruth
who was leaning against the
counter with arms folded,
casually lifted a hand and
said nonchalantly, “Hiyah.
What you have?’ Typical.

Wes Roberts’ story is not unique in the Bell

is growing fast--and men are needed who can

grow just as fast.

Wes can tell you: “We get good training.
But no one nurses you along. We hire managers

ceiling for a self-starter in this business,”
