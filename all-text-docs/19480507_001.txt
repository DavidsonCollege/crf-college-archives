FORENSIC COUNCIL COMPLETES GOOD YEAR

Last Monday night a joint meet-
ing of the Eumanean and Philan-
thropic literary societies was held
in the latter’s hall with Phi Presi-
dent Sam Maloney in charge.

The program consisted of eight
impromptu speeches given al-
ternately by members .of each
society. A popular rating made by
those present chose the Phi team
as the best; and four purposely
marked rating slips, tvo of which
were distributed’ in society
with the other slips, also’ turned
the hi team as the winner.

While the votes wer¢ being
counted Prof. Gordon Wood drew
howling laughter from the student
men of letters with his witty
criticisms of the speeches given and
motions displayed.

Maloney, who was assisted 10
presiding by John Thatcher, Eu's
president, opened the meeting with
the reading of scripture from

each

Dick Richards of Eu humorously
led off with “The Art of Judging an
Impromptu Talk’? and was fol-
lowed by Jay Pence of Phi who
spoke on “The Art of Impromptu
Speaking,” after which Dave Gam-
brell of Eu argued against the
semester system as opposed to the
quarter system for Davidson.

Heywood Brinegar (Phi) showed
his Ability for impromptu speaking
in the fourth talk in which he came
out in favor of the present system
of closed election at Davidson as
opposed to open campaigning.

tertained with “Do's and Don'ts

jing on the leading churchmen to
remedy the situation,

The main points of the “program
for peace” are as follows:

| 1. Our people should not tolerate
}any complacency about war, War

| would engulf .all in misery and
would bring other consequences
{quite the opposite of our inten-
tions. ‘
2

Our people should combat a
mood of hysteria of blind hatred.

| 3. Our people stould’ reject
fatalism about war. War is not
inevitable. If it should come, it

would be because of conditions that
men could have changed.

4. Our people should) not. rely
primarily on military strategy to
meet the Communist aggression,

Such reliance is more apt to bring
war than prevent it. There
should be greater concentration on
of an economic,

6. Our -people- ought, each one
of them, to contribute to a change
of mood so as to. increase the
chance of averting war without
feompromise of basic convictions.
| 7. Our churches ought to testify
}with renewed vigor to God’s
{righteous love for all men and the
| reality of the Christian world fel-
| lowship,
| This program pointed more to-
lwards publié than executive action,
j and brought favorable comment
from the Vresident, although he
refused to be quoted on anything
but a general approval of the
points mentioned,

Mresident Truman indicated that
| this nation’s foreign policy was
j without question geared to peace
land not to war. He stated that
when the war was over he asked

| Congress to allow him to keep one

million men in Europe, The
lparents and Congress brought such
| pressure to bear that the country
tind to yield to early demobiliza-
jtion of it’s forces. He believes that

| }we are seeing the consequences of

| that particularly in Berlin today.

The European Recovery Pro-
leram is certainly a major con-
| sideration in World Peace. “It is

so important that if the American

people allow it to fail, we may ex-
pect the!worst,” said Mr, Truman.
Dr. Cunningham stated again that
