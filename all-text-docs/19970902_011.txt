and my life nearly changed.

In the beginning there was the
pizza bar. Then, for a while, there
was nothing.

This past week, however,
marked another innovation in Vail
Commons that may just usher in an
era of sweeping reform and un-
heard of upheaval. Seldom do I
actually look at what Lam getting to
eat inthe Commons because, after a
while, it all looks the same.

The one exception, other than
ice cream, is the breakfast cereal. In
general, the selection presented in
the Commons is quite good, with all
nfanner of crunchy, sugary cereals
that are greatly to my liking: This
past Saturday, though, something
was amiss. I could

What unpleasant madness was
this, I thought, where is the prom-
ised cocoa taste?!? Where is the
sugar and chocolate rush foretold in
the Book of Tony? Who stole the
“Grrrreat!” part, reducing this to a
cereal about which one could only
say “They’re?” Perhaps, I decided,
there was a delay, and I needed only
for the milk to work its magic and
release the demoniacal flavor hid-
ing within, taunting me.

I waited. .

this point, was stone cold. I fully

being desperate
enough to snort the
colorful powdery remains, I cast
about for an alternative.

That was when I happened upon
them. At first I thought there had
been some bizzare accident that had
mutated the Golden Grahams into
flakes. Thinking that too farfetched,
I considered the possibility that the
highly publicized, utterly diverse
class of 2001 had demanded darker
cornflakes to maintain racial equal-
ity (a possibility that I have not yet
entirely dismissed).

It was not until I saw the label
taped to the bin that I actually be-
lieved it. These were Cocoa Frosted
Flakes. I was taken aback. Was it
not only days prior that I had seen
the first commercials, heralding
their arrival? Could it be that
Davidson had secured one of. the
very first shipments? Was this fi-
nally one of the long-promised im-
provements I’d heard 'murmurs of
from President Haselden?

My heart pounding, I reached
for the scoop to put some into my
bowl. At this moment, however, I
paused. This seemed entirely too
good to be true.

When I returned
my attention to the
bowl, I was surprised to find that the
milk had turned brown. Undoubt-
edly this was the sign I had been
waiting for! As I tenatively low-

incredible. The milk had aquired a

Drained of any flavor they
might have had, the remaining few

I took the

I let the smooth, creamy whiteness
flow over the rough brown flakes.

I then rushed to find a table, not
wanting to miss a single phase of
the inevitable crunchy-to-mushy
