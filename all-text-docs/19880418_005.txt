Charlotte’s theaters: Some rank high, others are just rank

By BRUCE PLOURDE

Going to the theater has a cer-
tain mystique about it, a certain
quality that makes it special. One
can always turn on the tube and
watch a made-for-television
. movie, or pop a flick into the VCR
while house members mud
wrestle in the backgroun, but see-
ing a movie in that fashion lacks
the atmosphere of the theater.

The theater offers more than
just the movie. Standing in line is
like the college version of cruis-
ing: it offers the opportunity to see
Charlotteans from all social
classes first-hand. Also, the video
stores don’t sell buttered popcorn
or that candy in the luxury-size
box. Finally, sitting in a big room
amidst a crowd of strangers with
the lights off, one can never tell
what might happen. Going to the
theater'gives a person a chance to
escape from campus fora while, to
absorb some of the city lights, and
to forget about school books and
professors’ dirty looks.

But some theaters have a more —

congenial atmosphere than oth-
ers. If a person pays her money,
she should get all that’s coming to
her, and that includes the most
,comfortable and enjoyable at-
mosphere possible. Instead of

reviewing a movie this week,

Charlotte Flix will review the |

theaters instead. One can see a
movie in Charlotte in any of over
eight places. To the connoisseur,
some cinemas definitely rank

better than others, while some just .

rank.

The General Cinemas, by and
large, rank. This chain of theaters’
most important consideration is
not film in itself but profit. Gen-
eral Cinemas have the most popu-
lar films, the safest bets for captur-
ing the most viable audience to-
day, the teen market. This group
shows a lot of action pictures,
sappy romances, and so on. Usu-
ally the plot plays upon the
hormones somehow. But going to
these cinemas does not mean
throwing away five perfectly
good dollars. The audience does
see the movie. In addition, the
viewer gets to see that sickening
red screen before the movie starts,
plus a bunch of previews of up-
coming acne-causing hit films.

In fegards to atmosphere, how-
ever, there is none. The attendants
and managers are friendly but not
in an endearing sense. Whenever I
go to review a movie, I always
forget paper and a pen and have to
ask the ticket taker if he or she can

give them to me. Only at General
Cinemas do the employees give
me grief, ultimately consenting to
find a fragment of pencil without
an eraser and a scrap of paper, but
only after every employee in the
theater, and some others called in
from home, have approached me
and asked me just why I needed a
pen and paper so desperately.
When I make the same request
at the Manor or Park 51, the
manager bends over backwards to
assure herself that I have all I
need. On my last visit to the
Manor, when I reviewed The Last
Emperor, the manager was de-
lighted that I had come to review
the film, and shared with me some
of the reviews she had already
heard. Then she supplied me with
a clipboard, paper and pen, and
sent me into the viewing salon,
saying that if I let. her know in
advance, she will let me see the
films in an advanced showing.
Needless to say, the Manor and
Park 51 theaters have more con-
sideration of their patrons. They
welcome people into their thea-
ters, which are rather old-fash-
ioned, rather worn in places, and
purveying a sense of a home set-
ting, perhaps more cultured than
some homes are accustomed.

Furthermore, these theaters do not
show the common lot of films that
spew out of Touchstone or Lori-
mar Pictures.

One can always count on the
best films from around the world
to show, at some time or another,
at these theaters. The Last Em-
peror, winner of nine Academy
Awards, played at only one thea-
ter in Charlotte, the Manor. The
Manor also showed: The Dead,
the video version of James Joyce’s
short story, Manon of the Spring,
a superb film from France, Living
on Tokyo Time, a too light but
nonetheless international film,
and the list goes on and on. An
evening at one in this group is like
an afternoon spent punting down
the Thames: entertaining and
thought-provocative. »

University Place plays pretty
much the same movies that the
General Cinemas do, except that
no theater can beat its collegiate
atmosphere. Students from
UNCC, not adults with nothing
better to do, work there taking
tickets, selling snacks and clean-
ing up after the movie. Right from
the starta Davidson student seizes
upon the novelty of fellow stu-
dents in control, a situation which
means that nobody in the audience

will get kicked out, no matter what
she does, but which also often
tempers the unquiet soul of rowdy
academicians out on the town.

The student control does not
occupy a major part of the theater
experience at University Place; it
merely rests subtlely, reassur-
ingly in the background. But
nonetheless the students in charge
somehow offer a mild freedom
which can’t be found in another
theater.

From those who know, I’ve
heard that Cinema and Draft is
fun. To me Cinema and Draft
sounds like watching TV from the
dinner table with my own and
several other Obnoxious and gut-
tural families.

For excellence in ambience I
list my choices as follows:

Category # 1: The “date movie”
Winner: Tower Place 8, South
Park Road.

Category # 2: The “profound
experience” Winner: The Manor,
Providence Road.

Category # 3: The “Boys/Girls
night out” Winner: University
Place, Harrison Boulevard.

My heartfelt congratulations to
all the winners.

College theater must be both a business and a workshop
This Spring, Davidson’s "Good" walks the line

By MICHELLE MILLER

College theater departments are regu-

Jarly. faced with the question of how to
satisfy their particular audience and at the
same time do new and exciting theater.
“Good,” by C. P. Taylor, is this spring’s
answer to that tricky question for the
Davidson College Theatre Department.

“Good” involves the right amount of
theatrical experimentation without placing
studentactors in impossible situations, says
Associate Professor of Theatre Joe Gard-
ner, directing the production. The audi-
ence, on the other hand, will be challenged
to struggle with a provocative question: At
what point does our moral obligation to
society override personal issues of family,
home and security?

“Good,” a musical comedy set in the late
*30s and early ’40s in Nazi Germany, tells
the story of how a ‘good’ man gets caught
up in the nightmare of the Third Reich. The
play premiered on Broadway in 1982, per-
formed by the Royal Shakespeare Com-
pany.

Gardner has toned down offensive lan-
guage in the original script for the Davidson
audience, but he emphasizes that the lan-
guage in “Good” serves an important pur-
pose. Profanity represents the violence of

the time and the desperation of the people
involved on both sides of the “Jewish ques-
tion.”

“This play has been in the back of my
mind ever since I saw itin New York,” says
Gardner. “When I choose a play, I ask
myself, ‘DoI play it safe ordol take arisk?’
All decisions like that are founded on the
ultimate goal of creating an approachable
theater experience. ‘Good’ takesrisks with-
out alienating the audience.”

The playwright, C. P. Taylor, is an Eng-
lish Jew who experienced World War II in
London. He writes, however, from the point
of view of a character named “Halder,” a
German Aryan who, in his desire to live a
normal life in the aberration of Nazi Ger-

many, is sucked into the atrocities of the |

Third Reich. Halder, as a decent kind of
German character, represents the gradual
extermination of the German moral con-
sciousness.

“Although we do not condone Halder’ ’s
response to the situation .
he has been placed in,
we can better under-
stand the kind of condi-
tions that led to a na-
tional acquiescence to
the atrocities Hitler

propagated,” Gardner says. “We wonder
what we would have done in the same situ-
ation.”

Taylor uses music to highlight the irra-
tionality of Halder’s situation. The music
allows us to see into the thoughts of Halder,
providing emphasis or counterpoint to the
action. The final musical emphasis comes
when Halder visits a Nazi concentration
campand Jewish prisoners are made to play
Schubert for him.

Gardner describes “Good” as a post-
modern work, a conscious derivative of

- Bertold Brecht, in that the play never pre-
sumes to imitate life. A reaction to modern
theater which tried to directly imitate life,
post-modern theater makes the audience
aware of theatrical conventions and re-
minds them that they are watching a play
whose characters and structure are created
to put forth an idea.

Most of the characters remain on stage
_ throughout the play, adding to the open

theatricality of the performance. “The
group of characters go through the action
aware that people are watching them all the
time,” says Gardner. “In Nazi Germany, no
one felt that they had any real privacy. The
form that Taylor has chosen emphasizes
this lack of privacy.”

Gardner’s purpose in producing this kind
of play is to get people to talk. “Even if we
reject the play or the issue that it addresses,
‘Good’ gives us issues worth grappling
with,” Gardner says. “The play will engage
audiences, and its use of the cabaret breaks
up the stark seriousness of the subject
matter. This is nota play for everybody, but
it is a play that everybody should see.”

Performances of “Good” are scheduled
for April 22-23 and 28-30 in Hodson Hall.
Shows are at 7:30 p.m. on the 28th and at 8
p.m. on the other nights. General admission

‘ is $5; students and senior citizens pay $3.
