Union, Housing Office Burglarized_

By ANDREA GROSS

Police Security Chief Jackie
Hughes reported that a burglar(s)
entered the Union Office early
Sept. 18th in the latest of a series
of campus larcenies.

In other thefts, the Housing
Office was robbed on Sept. 9th,
money was stolen from Grey
House during the football game of
Sept. 7th, and soccer and football
players arriving on campus before
classes began had ‘things taken
from their dorm rooms.

According to the police report
of the Union theft, Glenda Erwin,
employee of the Dining Service,
arrived at the cafe Wednesday
morning to find that the lock had
been cut off of a strong box in the
Union Office and that the three
metal money boxes it contained
were missing. The thief evidently
had a key to the Union office, as
the door lock was not forced and

the employees found the office
locked when they arrived.

Taken was one 7”x 8” box
containing money from the 900

‘Room, two 4”x 5” boxes holding

money to pay the work shifts, and
a set of freezer keys which were
also kept in the strong box. The

“precise amount of money stolen

was not disclosed. Hughes said all
Union money is now being kept in
a safe.

He added that he has no leads
in the case.

An arrest has already been
made in the housing office theft.
Wendell McCain has been ar-
rested and charged with taking an
undisclosed sum of money from
an envelope in a Housing Office
drawer.

Russell Bitter reported to the
police that McCain arrived in the
Housing Office in order to be paid
for moving refrigerators for the

college. Bitter went into another
room to get cash to pay McCain,

leaving him in the room where the
money was kept for about two mi-
rites. When Bitter returned, the
money was missing. Hughes said
that since the arrest, a portion of
the money has been recovered.

Other thefts reported include
sums of money stolen from Grey
House. Seniors Charles Jenkins
and David Stout filed police re-
ports indicating that the money,
which they had left in Grey
House, disappeared while the two
attended a football game. The
house was unlocked.

Hughes also said that some
soccer and football players’ dorm
rooms were robbed before classes
began. He said he feels that the re-
cent thefts are the work of outsid-
ers, not Davidson students, men-
tioning that he arrested three tres-
passers last week.

Director To Be Named Today

By DAVID WILLIAMS

Vice President for Develop-
ment John Griffith is expected to
name a new Director of the Office
of College Relations and Publica-
tions today. According to Profes-
sor Randy Nelson, the Search
Committee for the Director has
been interviewing candidates for
the past three weeks and was
scheduled to make a final recom-
mendation to Griffith by yester-
day.

The seat of the Director of
Communications has remained
vacant ever since former Director
John Slater resigned approxi-
mately one year ago. Bill Giduz
and Beverly Harris acted as Co-
Directors of the office during the
1984-1985 year.

In May 1985, the Ad Hoc
Committee To Evaluate the
Davidson College Communica-
tions Office, chaired by Joe Gard-
ner and Jerry Stockdale, was es-
tablished to determine the future
course of the office. The commit-
tee determined that the name of

the office would be changed to
College Relations and Publica-
tions. In its report, the Committee
stated: “Inthe past the (Communi-
cations) Office has functioned ina
passive service role, reacting to

demands upon it and producing

publications as requested or as
necessary, and some staff mem-
bers have felt that they were per-

ceived as and expected to be

merely ‘functionaries.’ We envi-
sion instead an office that is crea-
tive, pro-active and well-man-
aged.”

In July a Search Committee,
chaired by Nelson, was estab-
lished and an announcement was
placed in the Chronicle of Higher
Education. According to Nelson,
nearly three hundred people from
around the country applied for the
job. After working steadily for the
past three weeks, the Committee
narrowed the list of applicants to
four candidates. During the past
week, the candidates have visited
Davidson and have been intervie-
wed by various College officials

as well as the Search Committee.
All four candidates have chosen to
keep their names confidential.

The Director’s responsibilities
will include providing creative
leadership for the College in its
communications efforts, manag-
ing the office of College Relations
and Publications, serving as
senior editor for all College publi-
cations, and directing College
media relations.

Nelson is confident that the ot -
fice under new leadership will
take larger steps to effect a solid
image of Davidson College. “The
Ad Hoc Committee Report lays
out an ambitious program. My
hope is that we live up to the report
with the understanding that the
college has limited resources. As
one applicant put it, ‘The real
Chief Communications Officer of
the College is President Kuyken-
dall,’ and this fact could limit the
new Director to some extent. But
we would like to see the role of the
office expand.”
