Hunter Monroe Wins
Rhodes Scholarship

By LISA THOMAS

Senior Hunter Monroe received what
he termed “the greatest honor of his life”
Dec. 17 when he became Davidson’s
21st recipient of the Rhodes Scholarship.

Monroe’s selection was based on an
application and two interviews. Of the 32
nationwide recipients, Monroe was one
of two from the six-state southeastern
district and the only winner from North
Carolina.

When asked about the interviews,
Monroe said that many questions were
directed to his interest in economic aid.
“That’s the one thing I might do as a care-
er,” he said.

The interviews emphasized a com-
puter program which Monroe developed
in conjunction with Chairman of the
Economic Department Clark Ross. The
program suggests solutions and strate-
gies for reducing food deficts in eight
West African countries.

The project which was commis-
sioned through Ross who is an economic
consultant on Africa for the U.S. govern-
ment, came from a request from the Or-
ganization of Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) in Paris. The
U.S. government will provide the pro-
gram as a planning tool to the developing
countries.

Questions also centered on Monroe’s
time spent doing mission work in Zaire
and his participation in Davidson’s Cam-
bridge Program.

Mathematics professor Lunsford
King attributes much of Monroe’s suc-
cess to his varied interests and positive
attitude. He said that Monroe’s “en-

thusiasm for mathematics carries into
other areas, and he has lots of energy.”

Monroe also said “most of the other
students I was competing with were on
semester systems and were right in the
middle of exams. I think that was an im-
portant edge for me — that we are on
trimesters.”

The scholarship pays for all fees and
tuition for a two- to three-year stay at Ox-
ford University in England and provides
for living expenses as well. Monroe
wants to enter Oxford’s Balliol College
for a bachelor’s degree in Philosophy of
Politics and Economy.

Monroe’s selection puts Davidson in
a fifth place tie with Bowdoin College for
the number of Rhodes Scholarship reci-
pients among liberal arts colleges.

However, Monroe does not feel that
this will affect future selection decisions.
“They don’t consider things like that.
They like to choose the best candidates,
contrary to what most people think. A lot
of people think they choose at least one
native and at least one male from each
state.”

As winner of Virginia
Polytechnic Institute Regional
Mathematics contest, Monroe is also en-
titled to a graduate fellowship at that in-
stitution, although he does not plan to
take it within the next two years.

Last year Elizabeth Kiss became
Davidson’s first female Rhodes Scholar.
She is currently studying at Balliol Col-
lege, Oxford.

The Rhodes Scholarship

The Rhodes Scholarship was begun

by British financier Cecil Rhodes, who

delineated in his will the type of scholar
he wanted to receive these awards.
Rhodes earned his fortune by mining
gold and diamonds in South Africa.

Rhodes criteria for selection include:
“literary and scholastic achievements,
truthfulness, courage, devotion to duty,
sympathy for and protection of the weak,
kindliness, unselfishness and fellow-
ship, exhibition of moral force of charac-
ter and of instincts to lead and to take an
interest in one’s contemporaries, phys-
ical vigor as shown by fondness for and
success in sports.”

The selection process begins after the
aspirants fill out an application. Students
may apply in their home state or the state
of their college or university.

Twelve applicants are invited to state
interviews and two are chosen as state
finalists. Finally a committee composed
of past Rhodes scholars chooses the 32
recipients, four from each of eight dis-
tricts.

Bio Prof
Grant Dies

By ALLISON WILLS

Associate professor of Biology
Cynthia Thomas Grant died early last
Thursday morming of undetermined
causes.

Grant, 46, joined the faculty in 1972
and earned tenure in 1980. She taught
immunology, introductory biology, and
biochemistry.

“I always felt Cindy was very con-
cerned about the kind of place Davidson
was,” Dean of Students Will Terry said.
“She really wanted to see its best tradi-
tions upheld, and she was a very suppor-
tive member of the college community in
upholding those traditions.”

A native of Burlington, Vt., Grant re-
ceived her bachelor’s degree from Wel-
lesley College and completed a year of
graduate study at Boston University. She
received her PhD from Yale University

in 1965.
She was awarded a post-doctorate

fellowship at Woods Hole Oceanog-
raphic Institution
in Massachusetts
for 1964-65 and
was employed as
a research assis-
tant there before.

Physics pro-

friend and colleague, described Grant as
having a “good analytical mind.” “Cindy
ws a good researcher. One thing she en-
joyed most was being in the lab,” he said.

Trustee Adair Accompanies Jackson

By DAVID McGEE

For Davidson Trustee Thelma Adair,
the past holiday season was not a vaca-
tion, although she did take a trip. She
went to Syria as a member of presidential

she said.

‘We had three goals: to see Lt. Good-
man, meet with religious leaders there to
find out what can be done to further
peace in that part of the world, and speak
with the Syrian government about Ut

* which obtained the release of Navy pilot
Lt. Robert O. Goodman on Jan. 3.

Goodman was taken prisoner when
Syrian forces downed his plane over
Lebanon Dec. 4.

The only woman of the delegation’s
seven primary members, Adair was
asked to go because of her past experi-
ence with peace efforts in the Middle
East. She said in a telephone interview
with The Davidsonian that her trip to
Syria served as a mission of mercy to
seek new options for peace there.

“Before we left we discussed the fact
that our mission — because it was one of
peace and mercy — has its limitations,”

She said the ‘members of the delega-
tion were “‘more than delighted” with the
results of their trip and are thankful for
how well the Syrian government treated
them. Though she declined to comment
on the Reagan Administration’s current
Middle East policies, Adair feels addi-
tional initiatives like Jackson's delega-
tion are necessary for a solution td the
problems in the Middle East.

In response to criticism that
Jackson’s trip was politically motivated,
she said, “I can’t see how it could not af-
fect his candidacy. Jesse himself has said
that all political actions have moral im-
plications and all moral actions have

political implications.

“But many people don’t know that he
[Jackson] at first did not plan to go. Our
group was made up of persons, both
black and white and from different de-
nominations, who are interested in pur-
acronis so aw
the world. As men and women of faith,
we have a responsibility to seek peace
throughout the world we live in.”

Adair is currently a Professor of Edu-
cation at Queens College of the Univer-
sity of the City of New York. She at-
tended Barber-Scotia and Bennett Col-
leges in North Carolina. She has served
as Moderator of the United Presbyterian
Church, the second woman to hold that
office in the church’s history. Adair is
also president of Church Women United,
an ecumenical movement of Christian
women, and serves on the Student, Re-
ligious, and Campus Life committees of
the Davidson Board of Trustees.
