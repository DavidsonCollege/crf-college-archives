February 24, 1978 The Davidsonian nr

communion

sunday morning:

the streets are breathing lightly again,
scudding the cars along the church.
between breaths

we hear the distance

created by bells.

the love long dried

on our bellies and thighs,

now we are looking for breakfast,
a table by the sidewalk.

the old proprieter,

a stomach with sprawling legs
and a pencil,

doing the books

in the corner.

we have fruit and cheese danishes
and coffee.

the negro’s deferring

autumnal face

sweeps the floor around us.

we do not speak

but listen to the graceful air:

and | also love a lord,
the lord of my own doing
and undoing—

the bells weaving in
and out
of the air.
