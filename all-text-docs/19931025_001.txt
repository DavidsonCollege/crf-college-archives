College celebrates homecomin

By Katherine Hash

Davidson alumni from the
classes of 1910-1993 “came home”
this weekend to join their class-
mates and current Davidson stu-
dents in the 1993 Homecoming
festivities. From Friday afternoon
through Saturday night, alumni and
students enjoyed numerous pre-
and post-game activities sponsored
by various campus organizations.

John Cook, assistant to the
director of Alumni Affairs, was
expecting over 500 alumni to re-
turn to Davidson and to participate
in the activities sponsored by
Alumni Affairs which included
those for the class of ’88, holding
its fifth year reunion, and the Avant
Garde, the classes of ’10-’43 who
have already had their 50th re-
unions.

Alumni and students gathered
on the back terrace of Vail Com-
mons on Saturday before the foot-
ball game from 11:30 to 1:00 fora
cookout sponsored by Alumni Af-
fairs.

At 1:00 the Wildcat Parade,
headed by the North Mecklenburg
High School Band, marched
through Patterson Court and led
the crowds to Richardson field.

Spectators were entertainedby
a skydiving exposition sponsored
by the Wildcat Club as well as by
music from the North Mecklen-
burg band and Davidson’s own
pep band.

The Davidson Wildcats took
on a formidable foe, Randolph-
Macon (4-2-1). The Yellow Jack-
ets beat Davidson 21-16 with two
last minute touchdowns.

Friendly
neighbors

By Court McBryde

Off-campus students and their
neighbors are working oma "Good
Neighbor Policy" designed to im-
prove relations. They met to dis-
cuss their problems at the last
Davidson town meeting.

Davidson’s Community Re-
lations Committee drafted a letter
that was sent to all off-campus
students. The letter included what
the community expected of stu-
dents living in the town. The com-
mittee asked the students to sug-
gest changes and sign the letter,
agrecing that they are.in.compli-
ance with the policy. Town Ad-
ministrator Leamon Brice com-
ments that “the policy is not one to
be enforced, it is more a list of
expectations.”

Brice explains how this policy
originated last year when prob-
lemsbegan to evolve with the noise
and behavior generated from off-
campus parties. He believes the
town hasborne the brunt of chang-
ing party policies on campus. The
strict alcohol policy in. effect last
year caused more students to go
off campus for parties.

About 15 students attended
the town meeting. Brice says the
students were unaware of the type
of things that bothered the neigh-
bors. Off-campus student Rhen
Otts says that the community in-
vited them to the meeting to “lay
down the law of how we have tobe
responsible and how the police are
going to crack down on us.”

The off-campus students de-

cided to write a letterin response to
the situation. Their intentions are
to inform all Davidson students
who attend off-campus parties of
what is expected from the town.
They want students to know that
off-campus parties are not equiva-
lent to Patterson Court parties.

RLO director Richard Terry
has been working closely with this
matterand is currently helping off-
campus students to draft the letter.
When completed, it will be distrib-
uted to all on campus students and
the Davidson community. Brice
feels that both letters should make
all students aware of the
community’s expectations and so-
licit help from students. He says,
“Nonegative comments have been
made about the policy from stu-
dents, neighbors, ortown officials.”

Sobering events highlight alcohol awareness

By Mary Clare Jalonick &
Jeff Fuller

Alcohol Awareness Week,
sponsored by the counseling cen-
ter, Residence Life, Patterson
Court Council, Vail Commons, and
the Union Board, was a week long
event, October 10-14, designed to
make the campus aware of the dan-
gers of alcohol.

The week started on Sunday,
with a workshop for the seven bar-
tenders who work inthe 900room.
Led by
Kurt
Holmes,
assistant
director
of Resi-
dence
Life, the
work-
shop
taught
the bartenders how to intervene if
aperson has had too muchtodrink.

On Monday, the “alcohol
awareness banner” was signed and
15 different halls participated in
the bulletin board contest. The
bulletin boards, which were de-
signed by RAs, hall counselors,
and students on the halls, presented
different alcohol themes. 2nd Knox
and 3rd Watts won.

Tuesday brought the human

Victim

resource fair, the awareness poster _

showing, and the “putt-putt for

MADD." The fair, held outside
the Union Cafe, consisted of people

from different agencies around the

area who have experience dealing
with alcohol rehabilitation.

The poster showing was a na-
tional competition sponsored by
Anheuser-Busch. Davidson only
had one entry, submitted by Brad
Johnson.

“Putt-putt for MADD” was
held along dorm row. There were
nine holes set up, designed by dif-
ferent students. Over 100 people
started the course but only 27 made
it through, due to holes that were
12 to 15 par.

‘Wednesday started out with
“red carnation day” in Vail Com-
mons. Students who ate there were
given the flowers to remind them
of the dangers of alcohol.

Wednesday night there was
an all campus picnic sponsored by
the Union, Vail, and the houses of
Patterson Court. Several houses
participated in a mock-tail contest.
The non-alcoholic drinks were
judged by students. Six houses
participated in the contest.

SAE served Strawberry Ba-
nana Daiquiris with a Twist of
Lime. Warner Hall made Tequila

Sunrise Without the Hangover. ~

Connor and Rusk both had drinks
entitled Safe Sex on the Beach.
Phi Delta Theta made Unfuzzy

_Navels and Sigma Phi Epsilon

called their drink Banana P. The
winner of the contest was Rusk
who received $100.

The highlight of the picnic
was the mock accident. The acci-
dent was held in front of the Unior
Outpost. Four emergency medical
units came to “rescue” the victims
of a supposed drunk driving acci-
dent.

There was a car run up on to
the sidewalk, and Jill Bennett,
president of Rusk, acted as victim,
laying on the ground in front. The
demonstration ended when the
paramedics laid a sheet over her.

Allin all, the week went well.
Kurt Holmes, who organized the
week in conjunction with Art Flagg
of the counseling center, was very
confident. “ I think it went well.
This was the first time that this
many groups were involved, and I
hope tocontinue that kind of thing.”
