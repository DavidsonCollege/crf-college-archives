The quartet, composed of Calhoun, Foster,
Wilson, and Lockhart, gave several selec-

seemed to be thoroughly enjoyed. Among
“Dear One,
the World Is Waiting For the Sunrise,”
“Collegiate,” and “Knee Deep in Daisies.”

The club will journey over to Charlotte,

Queens College, on Saturday night, Decem-

the club should be in much better shape for
the performance at Queens and should make
a name for themselves,
