Stronger | cross-country team is
off and running this season

By LEE CANIPE

Ted Richardson, Davidson’s
most valuable men’s cross
country runner last season,
hopes to improve on, the
team’s 1988 finish in the bot-
tom division of the tough
NCAA. Southeast regional
meet. »

“I think we definitely can
improve on last season,” he
said. “We've got more depth
and a strong grouping.”

Richardson~and-the Wild-
cats took a major step in that

' direction last Saturday at the’

Panther Creek Invitational in
Jefferson City, Tennessee. The
Wildcat women, led by indi-
vidual winner Kathy Beach,
took second place in the meet
while the men finished third in
a seven-team field.

Beach, a team co-captain

who saw limited action in 1988
due to a stress fracture, was
one of three Davidson women
in the top four places Saturday.
Heather Tarpley and freshman

Becky Hunter and were third .
and fourth, respectively. Bre- |
_ vard, a strong team, won the

team championship.
Sophomore Chris Otrok
paced the men with a top 20
finish and was followed by
freshmen Peter Hurtado and
Ian Stewart. Senior David
Murray and freshman David
Kerns rounded out
Davidson’s top five seeds.
Otrok, winner of the
Davidson Alumni race earlier
in the season, has emerged as
the team’s leading runner, but
the team asa whole is talented.
“We're much more solid this
year than we were last sea-

son,” said Richardson. “We
might not have any real stand-
outs, but we are strong all the
way from our first man to our

seventh. We have a good |

group of freshmen too.”

Coach Gary Andrew’s Wild- |
cats travel to Winthrop next
weekend and will be at home —

for the Davidson Invitational
on October 20.

By then Davidson should be
entering the last stages of

preparation for the regional '

meet in early November.

“Coach Andrew’s training
schedule is so that his runners
will beat their peak by regional
time,” said Richardson.

If things keep progressing
according to this schedule, the
Wildcats should enjoy a more
pleasant trip to Greenville in
1989.

against the Dayton Flyers as they fell
with a thud 49-7, .

And they fell quickly.

On the first play from scrimmage for
Dayton, a well-defensed halfback op-
tion pass found its way past safety
Mike Noonan for a 52-yard touch-
down. Head coach Vic Gatto was quick
to point out that Noonan was not to

“We had the defense we wanted and

iow far Saturday —

the defensive player we wanted cover-
ing the receiver,” he said. “The ball was
just thrown right where it had to be
thrown.” _
The Flyers never looked back. »
' Before the quarter was over it was
21-0 Dayton, and the Wildcats had lost

their second starting tailback in two

weeks. Bryn Robinson went out with

aninjury to the same knee that kept him’

out of action last season.

From then on the numbers tell the
entire story as the Wildcats were out-
blocked, out-tackled and out-coached.
Thirteen different players amassed 309
yards on the ground and five touch-

downs for the Flyers. Their quarter-
backs combined on 14 of 19 passes for
205 yards and two scores.

The Flyer defense gave up only 167

yards of total offense. Davidson run-—

ningbacks could average only 2.6 yards
per carry and quarterbacks Matt
Matheny and Mark Wainwright com-

" pleted more passes to Dayton defend-

ers (4) than to Wildcat receivers (3).

- OnDavidson’s one scoring drive, the
big plays were turned in by Matt
Matheny, who converted a fourth and
four'situation in the third quarter for a
five yard gain, and Mike Carney, who

. gained 25 yards ona reverse. The drive
was capped by freshman Travis Hin-

son’s 7-yard run. ~

After the game there were no ex-
cuses. Having to fly in to Dayton that
morning certainly was a contributing

_ factor. The lack of players on the squad

doesn’t allow for the offense or defense

_In boxing it is called a feeling-out
period. The two fighters are cautious
for the first few rounds, waiting to size
up their opponent. In a word, the trick
to the first few rounds is patience.
__Last week it was the Wildcat men's
soccer team which benefited most from
this feeling-out period as they defeated
UNC Ashville 3-1.

already looking to next week’s game

as Gatto reminded them, Wagner is
every bit as good as Dayton, if not
better.
