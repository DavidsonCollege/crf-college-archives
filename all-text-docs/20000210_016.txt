Davidson tops Wake 1 in OT, avenges 20 years of futility

Sports Editor

Some people say history repeats itself.
Well, they’re going to have to wait.

Going into last Wednesday’s game
against Wake Forest, Davidson had lost its
last nineteen meetings with the Demon Dea-
cons, including a
heartbreaking
one-point loss in
Winston-Salem
last year. The
Wildcats had also dropped their two most
recent games—two important Southern Con-
ference contests that had slipped away in the
closing minutes.

The perennial ACC contender could only
add to the Wildcats’ woes, skeptics said.

Instead, Davidson defied its recent his-
tory of last-minute defeat and two-decade
long history of futility against Wake by thrill-
ing the raucous Belk Arena crowd with a 54-
49 overtime win over the Demon Deacons.

“T think we learned from the last two
years,” said Stephen Marshall. “We really
pulled through in the end today because we
kept our poise and stayed confident.”

Staying poised was the only way to sur-
vive this defensive battle that saw 15 lead
changes in 45 minutes and no double-digit
advantages for either team.

“This was a defensive struggle. It was
like a chess game from the opening tip to the
end,” said head coach Bob McKillop.

The Wildcats and Demon Deacons com-
bined for only 39 first-half points after get-
ting off to arocky start. The Wildcats’ missed
an easy layup and turned over the ball twice
within the first three minutes.

The Demon Deacons could do no better,
missing their first four shots, including two
free throws.

But even after each team started finding
the basket, the first-half didn’t exactly turn
intoabarnburner. The half would have ended
on an | 1-19 Wake advantage had not David-
son gone on an 8-1 run during the last five
minutes of the period.

“The defense that Wake Forest put on in
the first 20 minutes was sensational,” said
McKillop. “But we got some easy layups as
the half wound down and started to figure out
what to do.”

Thank goodness for those layups, though,
because Davidson’s perimeter shots just
weren’t connecting. The open looks were
there, but only one of Davidon’s seven first-
half three-point attempts dropped through
the net. The other six went in-and-out, glanced
off the rim, or missed completely.

But what the Wildcats lacked in offen-
sive firepower they made up for with a superb
defensive effort—especially in the second
half—that ultimately won the game for them.
And down the stretch, the team’s poise de-
fined its stellar defensive performance.

By watching the Wildcats’ second-half
performance, you’d never know this team’s
nagging problem has been becoming un-
glued just when the game demanded a con-
centrated, sharply focused attack.

“Keeping our poise has been a trouble

for us,” admitted Marshall. “In the UNC
Greensboro game, we were up by eleven and
relaxed and they came back and won. To-
night we let it all hang out. We were playing
with great confidence.”

Much of that confidence came from
Marshall’s 11-point effort over the first six
minutes of the second half, a performance
that kept the Wildcats on pace with the De-
mon Deacons during those first minutes.

Landry Kosmalski led the second-half
defensive charge, pulling down 8 boards over

the last 45 minutes and keeping the game
from getting overloaded with second-chance
Demon Deacon points.

By 5:35, the game was knotted in its
twelfth tie, 41-41, and the scored didn’t
change until Darius Songalia made a free
throw at the 1:20 mark.

Wayne Bernard scored a layup and
Kosmaski and Wake’ s Robert O’ Kelly traded
threes before a Josh Howard foul sent
Kosmalski to the line for a one-and-one at-
tempt with Davidson ahead, 46-45.

reminder of the UNC Greensboro game

The ball returned to Wake’s end for
Broderick Hicks to shoot two from the line.

The Belk Arena crowd that had rocked
al) a erupted in cheers when Hicks missed

his first attempt but then quieted as the sopho-
more guard’s second shot found the basket
with 21 seconds remaining, tying the score at
46.

To safeguard their opportunity for an
overtime win, the Wildcats dribbled away the
final seconds to the applause and cheers of the
Wildcat faithful.

The next five minutes was more than
overtime for Kosmalski—it was sweet re-
demption. After missing the front end of a
one-and-one attempt that could have won the
game in regulation, Kosmalski hit 6-of-8
«clutch free throws in the final period to seal
the win.

“T got a chance to redeem myself after
missing the one-and-one in regulation and
missing the one-and-one against Greensboro,”
said Kosmalski. “I was fortunate enough to
come through and we got the win.

“Even though I missed those free throws
against UNC Greensboro, I still wanted the
ball at the end. I felt confident. Whenever it
comes down to that situation and you're
feeling good, you want to take the shot.”

Wake took an early lead in ovgytime on
an Atwan Scott jumper and Josh Howard free
throw, but those were to only the last three
points of the night for the Demon Deacons.

Michael Bree hit a short jumper and
Kosmalski made his first two free throws to
put the Wildcats ahead for good, 50-49.
Vidaurreta and O’ Kelley both went to the line
for the Demon Deacons with a chance to
reclaim the lead but couldn’t connect on their
free throws.

“If we had made those free throws the
game would have been over,” said an agitated
O’Kelley. “It was pretty bad. It-seems like
when one person misses free throws it be-
comes contagious and the whole team gets
it.”

The Wildcat defense safeguarded the
lead for the next two minutes as Wake chaoti-
cally attempted several shots that would have
saved the game for them.

“We felt that if the game was tight and
close, they might struggle with some of their
shots,” said McKillop. “When they missed
the foul shots and jumpers, you could see the
tentative nature of their shots.” ;

‘ Four more Kosmalski free throws in the
last 40 seconds put the game out of reach for
the Demon Deacons and sent the crowd into
frenzy. At the buzzer, the Wildcat faithful
rushed the court, smothering the team that
had scored Davidson’ first victory over an
ACC team since 1994.

“The crowd for the last three games has
been sensational,” said McKillop during his
post-game interview, “and I’m thrilled that
we can reward them with the this victory.”

“This is a great confidence booster for us
right now at this point in the season, espe-
cially after the last two losses,” said Marshall.
“We were feeling kind of down and youcan’t

ask for a better pick-me-up than this.”
