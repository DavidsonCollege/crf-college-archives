NUMBER 13

Alert Students Chase Thieves

By Sean Lind

Last Thursday, January 17, at
11:30 P.M. Barry Grow 91 and
Sam Adams ’93 noticed two non-
Davidsonians walking around the
second floor of E. H. Little Li-
brary. They didn’t think much of
the two until, approximately five
minutes later, Emily Hines ’92 told
them she was missing forty-odd
dollars from her backpack, and
asked if they had seen .anyone
suspicious.

Grow and Adams; suspecting
the two strangers, immediately
attempted to locate them in the
library.

They confronted the young
men on the first floor, and asked
what they were doing in the li-
brary.-The twosuspects claimed to
be North Mecklenberg high school
students waiting to meet a tutor.
Upon further questioning, how-
ever, their alibi became flimsy.

Grow and Adams succeeded

in detaining the young men while

Helen Bell ’91 contacted the cam-

pus police on the library phone. -
Grow and Adams also got the

students to empty their pockets,

but found. 96 Obviously stolen

property. ‘Their wallets, however,

were “loaded” with money.

Update: Davidson Alumni

The two young men were de-
tained for as long as possible,
approximately ten minutes, but
eventually they were able to find
an excuse to leave the library. The
Davidson patrolman had still not
arrived on the scene.

Once outside the library, the
suspects began sprinting towards
Jackson Court. Now fairly sure
they had the right men, Grow and
Adams gave pursuit, but arrived
too late to stop the suspects from
speeding offin a black Mazda truck.
Adams was, however, able to take
down part of the license number
before the thieves turned off their
lights.

Eventually, Officer Davis ar-
rived on the scene, and took down
a description of the two suspects.

Notsatisfied,Grow and Adams
drove around the neighborhood,
searching for the truck. They fi-
nally located it, engine still warm,
behind Davidson Elementary
School On Kaffey Street. On Sat-
urday, Adams relayed these find-
ings to the police.

According to Assistant Direc-
tor of Public Safety Rick Moore,

: oonehas yet been charged for the

“thefts. The ‘campus police do,
however, have definite suspects,

and the investigation is continu-
ing.

One of the main problems,
however, is that the college police
only have jurisdiction on the cam-
pus itself. They cannot investi-
gate off-campus sites.

When asked if the incidence
of theft on campus is becoming a
frequent problem, Director Moore
said “It’s not increasing. It’s a
continuous problem.” Sporadic
incidents have been reported in
the library, Chambers, and the
Union.

Since the incident, campus
police have stepped up security in
the library. An officer periodi-
cally patrols the building, hoping
to prevent any further thefts.

Although the increased secu-
rity may help, one of the best ways
to prevent crime, said Moore, is
for students to realize that there is
a problem. “Do not leave valu-
ables in backpacks or coats unat-
tended,” he said. While Davidson
students are bound by the Honor
Code, other visitors on campus are
not.

If anyone has information
concerning these or other inci-
denis, please contact the campus
police at x2178

Caught In Desert Storm

By John Wilson

As Operation Desert Storm
escalates so does the involvement
of many Davidson graduates.
There are several alumnae partici-
pating tosome degree in the Middle
East.

Chaplain J.B. McCoy III, 63
, Serves in the 82nd Airborne with
over sixteen years of military ex-
perience, Mrs, McCoy com-
ments on her husband’s actions:
“My husband cannot fight but is
there to provide any religious
assistance...He tells me that along
with the increase in attendance at
chapel, morale is high.”

Conceming the issue of pro-
tests against the war Mrs. McCoy
said, “The purpose of us fighting is
for the freedom to protest. .. . The
protesting is different from the

Vietnam era. Then the protesting
was against the war and the sol-
diers, now itonly revolves around
the war.”

-Mrs. Norwood, whioss: hus-
band, Thomas, grauduated in 1970,
stated that once the war began: “I
was relieved... butthenIcouldn’t
seem to justify my emotions. As
the war went on and as I saw the
destruction from the bombing, it
hitme. I turned off the T.V...To be
honest I try not to deal or philoso-
phize with any of the issues any~
more. Itis aluxury I cannot afford
to deal with at this time.”

Captain M. Thomas Norwood
flies in the 77th Air Refueling
Squadron. Mrs. Norwood ex-

plained what her husband told her .

on the first night of fighting: “He
was far enough that he could see

the effects of the fighting on the
ground and still feel safe.”

Mrs. Norwood also said, “I
grew up in a liberal family, so
when the war started it seemed to
give my perception more color.”

One aspect that appears to
color this war is its dependence
upon advanced technology. Mrs.
H.C. Patterson said, “My husband
and I talk frequently considering
he is close tc the front.” Her
husband, H.C. Patterson, M.D. , is
the Medical Reserves. “He works
in a hospital in Saudi Arabia.

“T have found that when one
enters the reserves and then is sent
over, the family has to sacrifice
socially and financially...In the
future the interest to sign up in the

Speech Recalls Gantt Campaign

By Terry Hines

Melvin Watt, a Charlotte law-
yer and former campaign manager
for Harvey Gantt, closed out cere-
monies commemorating Dr. Mas-
tin Luther King, Jr., with a speech
during Tuesday’s 11th Hour serv-
ice.
Watt reflected on his weekly
visits to Davidson as a child i the
50°s, when he served as a shoe
shine boy in his uncle Norton’s

barbershop. He disclosed to the
small crowd gathered in Lingle
Chapel that he remembered three
things about those visits: he
couldn’t get shoe polish on the
white socks of Davidson students;
his auntalways made him eat spin-
ach; and his uncle had to pull down
the blinds and lock the door of the

barbershop in order to give him a

haircut.
“Looking back,” Watt surmised,

“don’t know which of the three
Ihated the worst. Ihad nocontext
against which I could view the
third recollection.”

That was then. Today Watt
sees his anecdote as an indication
of how far the nation has come in
dealing with racerelations andhow
much further we have, as a coun-

NCAA Changes May
Affect Davidson

By Kristi Kessler, Lisa LeNard,
J.B. Stroud in assoc. with CPS

Reformers carried the day at the
National Collegiate Athletic Asso-
ciation (NCAA) convention in
Memphis, Tenn., forcing througha
raft of changes that critics say may
or may not ease some of the prob-
lems afflicting big time college

sports. Several of these reforms —
‘could havea profound impactupon

the future of Division I athletics
here at Davidson.

Among other reforms, represen-
tatives voted overwhelmingly to:

*Force schools to cut the
number of coaches on staff.

*Slash the number of scholar-
ships by 10 percent in each sport -

*Try to ease the isolation of
athletes by eliminating athlete only
dorms.

*Require academic counseling
forall athletes recruited at Division
Ischools.

*Shorten practice time and
playing seasons so athletes will
have more time for their studies.

spend more on women’s sports
and men’s sports other than foot-

-ball and basketball.

Due to the NCAA convention,
the college community has ex-
pressed much concern regarding
Davidson’s maintaining Division
I status. At this time, no decisions
have been made and it does not
appear that the results of the con-
vention will require Davidson to
leave Division I.

The following legislative acts
seem to have the greatest potential
for affecting Davidson:

*100 percent of all contests
must fulfill Division I sponsorship
requirements, and at least 50 per-
cent of all contests must be against
Division I opponents. Currently,
baseball, basketball, men’s soc-
cer,men’sand women’s tennis and
volleyball meet this requirement.
We will have to add more Division
I schools to the schedules of three
additional men’s teams and all of
the women’s teams to meet this
