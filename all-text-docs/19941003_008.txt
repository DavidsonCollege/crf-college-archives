I unfortunately find myself in
the position of defending my opin-
ions (ahem) after Walt Barron took
offence to my article from the Sep-
tember 19 issue of The
Davidsonian, “Pro sports: a na-
tional fetish.” He will probably be
surprised to read this, but my piece
withheld many of my personal feel-
ings so as not to dwell on more
oblique reasoning. Further adding
to Mr. Barron’s confusion, my ar-
ticle contained a heavy undercur-
rent of sarcasm to lighten up what
I knew a very specific group of
people would object to. Appar-
ently Mr. Barron misconstrued my
tone as “bitter” and “caustic” and
as a personal attack. It was not.

If Mr. Barron objected to and/
or missed the intention of my tone,
T-should point out that his piece
was far more bombastic and opin-
ionated than mine, but with a more

sinister purpose. Mr, Barron’s re-
sponse evidences a certain lack of
self-control in his eagerness to per-
sonally deface me. It is very pre-
sumptuous of a total stranger to
refer to one in this forum by Chris-
tian name (six times) and “you”
(12 times). So, Mr. Barron, who-
ever you are (that’s a joke), I
refuse to discuss the finer points
(oops, there I go again—that’s
called s-a-r-c-a-s-m) of your argu-
ment, notably the “Willard Scott”
and “Bob in Yahoo county” nas-
sages, which I feel go beyond hu-
mor to a personal attack. -

Mr. Barron embodies the
original, unspoken motivation to
write my article that I will make
clearhere: professional sports have
been force-fed somehow into the
male consciousness. I am of the
opinion (ahem) that it is question-
able for a supposedly neutral and

. universal—institution_such_as_the

evening news (and the society it
represents and reflects) to presume

that las aconcerned member of the
human race need to know more
about an already over-hyped en-
tertainment gold mine. It was this
dissatisfaction with unfair media
representation that led me to stress
the expansion of avenues that al-
ready exist for what people want,
i.e. ESPN and The Weather Chan-
nel, as Mr. Barron recognized.
agree with Mr. Barron’ s state-
ment, “All sports are forms of en-
tertainment, just as music and
painting. But they are all also
forms of art.’”” However, I cannot
compare the utter gravity with
which pro sports are received with
that of other forms of entertain-
ment. Yes, Jerry Garcia is rich as
hell, but I doubt very many take
him with the utter sincerity they do
some professional athletes. It is
my opinion (ahem) that pro sports
should receive a more realistic rep-
resentation in the media that led to
my half-serious suggestion that it
would be in networks’ interest to

have their own sports news show.

In my opinion (ahem) the real
reason Mr. Barron was so moved
by my statements is that I chose the
path of most resistance: to betray
my own sex. When Mr. Barron
was wee, he found heroes in “pro
sports idol[s]” and beauty in their
feats. But I was dissatisfied with
what was expected of me as a male
and found beauty and my heroes
elsewhere. I may have sacrificed
the buddy-buddy, ball cap wearin’,
ESPN watchin’ male camaraderie,
but frankly, I don’t care.

Again, please allow me to
emphasize that I do not believe pro
sports are bad simply because I opt
not to watch them. However, I do
disagree with the unending cycle
of disproportionate representation
of pro sports and the societal ex-
pectations upon males. Mr. Barron
is under no obligation to share my
opinion and has every right to ob-
ject. But to insult my character,
upbringing, and masculinity is un-
called for. As Jason Keller, a friend
of mine, phrased it so well, “I am
athletic, but not brainwashed.”

Why did I decide to write for
The Davidsonian? For far too long
on this campus, I have felt that
there was a reluctance on the part
of the students to discuss racial
issues in a frank and straightfor-
ward manner, and I wanted to do
something about that.

My articles are written from
an African-American viewpoint—
for obvious reasons—and this may
seem offensive to some. I don’t
write to persuade or convince.
Rather, I write to open a line of
communication that has been
closed for ‘too long. I write to
express a viewpoint that most stu-
dents on this campus have not been
exposed to. I don’t write to ex-
press views that you want to hear;
rather I write to express views that
you need to hear and think about,

Consider the motivation, and

think deeper.

considering the fact that there are
several future leaders on this cam-
pus. You don’t have to agree with
what I say in order to get thé under-
lying meaning. You need to know
who we are! :

Davidson students (yes, I am
stereotyping here) seem reluctant
to ask African-Americans about

their beliefs and feelings. I see a
major reluctance from white stu-
dents to participate in BSC-spon-
sored events, or even to show up at
a BSC party. Why is it important
to write in such a frank manner?
Because it allows others to speak
with the same openness, and with
the same honesty. I want so des-

perately for you to realize that dif-
ferences should make this campus,
and the entire country, stronger.
All they do now is make us weaker.

I don’t write articles to make
enemies, nor do I write them to
make friends. So, if you really

The state of the Union today

Wer, it is an election year and
with everyone one of those, people
can start to wonder about the kind
of world we live in. Last week,
Marion “‘I-hope-that’ s-not-baking-
soda” Barry won the Washington,
D.C. mayoral primary by an over-,
whelming margin, despite the fact
that just three years ago he was
booted from office after being
caught on videotape for buying
and smoking crack cocaine. He, of

course, went to jail.

In an ideal world, a drug-us-
ing ex-con would usually not be
able to win the mayorship of our
nation’s capital. But, in our world
he can. I must ask: what type of
people actually live in a place like
that!? As you’ll learn, it is people
like you and I.

Next, we turn to Chicago,
home of Dan “‘just-kick-back-and-
relax” Rostenkowski. Now this is
a guy who paid a man $20,000 to
painthis home and said he was part

of his Congressional staff. This is
also the most powerful man in
Congress. A few months back, he
also won his primary. Afterwards,
he was indicted on a gazillion
counts by a Democrat district at-
torney. He has since been removed
from chairing the Ways and Means
Committee.

The buck does not stop here.

Life as an Internet junkie

A: age ten, I had the world at my hand. My
Vic 20, hooked up to a 1977 RCA 9-inch
television with a cracked screen, had the capa-
bility for programming (I could flash ‘Tony’
across the screen), could run cool games (Hang-
man and Pong), but most importantly, when
attached to my 200 baud Hayes modem, my
computer put me in touch with the world, or

- more importantly, Becky Taylor, my complies
bulletin board sweetheart.

The beauty of our torrid romance was the
fact that since I only dealt with her through the
computer screen, I didn’t have to worry about
my bad penmanship, my ever changing voice,
or my mud soaked Reeboks. And I could make
stuff up (lie). But eventually her fifteen year
old suspicious mind had me figured out:

BECKY: How old are you again?

ME: Eighteen. _

BECKY: You said you were sixteen.

ME: You're not so vain as to take age into
consideration, are you?

BECKY: Yeah, you’re right. What did
you say you looked like again?

ME: - Spiderman.

BECKY: Oh boy.

The neighborhood bulletin boards on which

my trusty Commodore and I romanced pale in’
comparison to the mighty Internet, or the web
of networks that make up what we call E-mail.
The brilliant minds behind E-mail probably
designed E-mail to be used as a clever network
that linked businesses, organizations, and col-
leges throughout the world.

Of course, nobody actually uses E-mail for
anything constructive (unless procrastination.
has suddenly been considered constructive),
except for my friend John, who used it to find
himself a Homecoming date (Through the WOE:
Women Of E-mail).

John, of course is the exception, not the
rule. People primarily use E-mail as an inex-
pensive way to keep in touch with friends at
other schools, because writing to people through
E-mail is fun and easy. All you need is an
address.

A network address looks like this:

example, if you’re trying to reach Edward
Yardumian at Bovine Technical Institute
you would get to the MAIL> and type , To:
in%Edyardumian@ Dung.BTech.justoutsideof
Camden,Nebraska. pop.74.edu.

Of course, you also need something to say.

If you’ re strapped for words, or just don’t have
the time, the people who frequently use E-mail
have developed these clever little symbols to
accentuate their feelings. Here are a few ex-
amples, with their respective meanings.

This character :) represents a ‘‘smile”, ie
“T’mso darn happy, I’m smiling.” This charac-
ter ;) represents a “wink”, “I’m so darn happy,
I’m winking.” This :( represents a“frown”, or
ie.“T’m so darn unhappy because you owe me
fifty dollars you buster and if you don’t pay me
by next Tuesday I’ll break your kneecaps with
a sledgehammer, :) .“

And for those fortunate few who find love
on the Internet, this @>—’-,— represents a
“rose”, ie. “I give you this rose, because I love
you and want you to bear my 17 children.” Use
with caution.

The problem with E-mail is that it con-

address s like this: sumes valuable time. The five minute break to
USER@NODE.LOCATION.DOMAIN. For

check mail becomes a two hour discussion
about the pro’s and con’s of cashmere sweater

’ lint. Somedays you don’t want to be trapped in

the maze of the computer center corresponding
to all you’re Internet pals. That’s why there’s
one other important character that every E-mail
user needs to know: ctrl-Z ie. EXIT.

Whose Homecoming?

Sometiines I feel like I’m not
really a Davidson College student.
You know, that left-out, all-alone
kind of feeling. Sure, most of the
time I’m right in the thick of things
with everybody else. Like during
class, studying in the library, or
eating at the Commons. But not
times like Homecoming weekend.
Those are the times when I feel like
I’d rather not be here.

I guess it’s my own fault for
not joining a fraternity. It’seemed
like everybody who’s a member of
a social house was having fun dur-
ing all: the festivities: putting on
their best duds, pre-game parties,
dinner, and dances. Yet somehow
I felt lost in the shuffle. With no
place to party or socialize or dance,
I guess I kind of felt embarrassed
to ask someone for a date. I mean
really, who wants to go to Home-
coming with a date that can’t even
take them toa party. And it wasn’t
just me. It was a sad site to see all
the lonely souls in the T. V. lounges
that Saturday night.

I sincerely believe that it is
weekends like Homecoming that
do the most damage to the highly
prized and much discussed “cam-
pus unity.” Most of the time, frat
parties are open to everyone, but

I sincerly
believe that it is
weekends like
Homecoming
that do the most
damage to the
highly prized
and much dis-.
cussed "campus
unity."

on these special weekends, only
members can attend. But what
about the large portion of the stu-
dent body that doesn’t belong to
houses? What about the 50% of all
sophomore males that are inde-
pendent? What about all the girls
that weren’t asked by all those
ostracized guys? Sure, there’s the
Union-sponsored dance, but let’s
not fool ourselves. Who wants to
go to that when they can be at a
fraternity party? Hence, the ex-

tremely weak support of Union

activities.

There’s got to be some logical
solution that caters to the needs of
all: students and not just those in
social organizations. Maybe we
could have an honest to God real
dance that the whole student body
wouldattend. Each fraternity could
have their own parties before and
after the dance, but everybody
could come together for a brief two
hours, so that everyone could feel
like they were a part of the fun.
Everybody could dance, and party,
and socialize together. Homecom-
ing and other big events could truly
be unified campus events. How
about it? [know it’s sort of radical,
but it might just be worth a try.
And then maybe I could feel like a
Davidson student again.
