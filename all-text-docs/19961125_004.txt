community for their support of the Greek system. Today, Davidon’s Omicron Gamma chapter is one of over
300 in the country.

‘Question

By ALLIson DoLPH
Staff Writer

Sometimes a visit to Belk
computer lab is like a trip to the
sauna.

People hover over computer
screens with flushed faces and un-
buttoned collars. Why are the com-
puter labs so hot?

Currently, one air condition-
ing unit is supplying both the base-
ment computer lab and the first
floor dormitory above. The mas-
sive amount of BTUs released by.
the computers and student-users

, require a lot of air conditioning to

compensate.

The current sharing arrange-
ment is not working.

The problem was first noticed
when the heat was turned on in
Belk dormitory. Physical Plant
studied the problem for a couple of
days, trying to determine the best
route to take. According to Phillip
Cashion, Associate Director of
Operations and Maintenance, a
separate unit has been ordered and
will soon be installed in the Belk
lab.

Why are the
computer labs so hot?

Lydia Lorenzin, Coordinator
of Academic Facilities and Ser-
vices, says the extreme heat makes
her more concerned for the people
than for the computers.  Short-
term high temperatures should not
have a detrimental effect on the
computers, but the lab is an un-
pleasant work environment for both
computer staff and students. More-
over, leaving the door open to let in
cool air also lets in dust and humid-
ity, both of which may harm the
computers.

Lorenzin says that Physical
Plant has been “very helpful” in
dealing with this problem.

There is some uncertainty now
about when the new unit will be
installed.

Preferably, the unit will be put
in when there are no students using
the lab, since the noise and plaster

‘may be bothersome.

However, if the unit does not
get installed over Thanksgiving,
students may have to bear the heat
until Christmas. Physical Plant
will also be looking into tempera-
ture problems in the basement
Chambers computer lab.
