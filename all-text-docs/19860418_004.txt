Woodrow Wilson Fellows help resettle Bikini Atoll

By MICHAEL D. SCHILL
Malcolm D. and Goldie W.
Rivkin, this year’s Woodrow Wil-
son Visiting Fellows, spoke this
week in the Union on a variety of

social and environmental issues.
The Rivkins were on campus
Monday through Thursday to
speak about experiences they have
had due to their company, Rivkin
Associates. What could be called
their keynote address was given
Wednesday evening at 7:00 on the
“Resettlement of Bikini Atoll.”
Rivkin Associates, which among

we

Malcolm D. Rivkin

other things is involved in land use
studies, was hired by the govern-
ment to work with the people of
Bikini Atoll on resettlement prob-
lems.

The people of Bikini were
evacuated from their atoll in 1946
so that the U.S. could test its hy-
drogen bomb there. Since then,
their population has increased by
nearly 900 percent, they are ex-
periencing overpopulation, and
many of them want to returm to the
still-irradiated Bikini. The Riv-
kins are trying to help the Biki-

elation

nians find places where they can
and want to live independently.

To those who missed it, this
lecture was another interesting
chapter in the still-occurring af-
tereffects of the second World
War.

Other topics the Fellows ad-
dressed during the week at various
open luncheons included such so-
cial and ethical problems as envi-
ronment versus land develop-
ment, and urban problems
worldwide. The Rivkins were also
available for informal conversa-
tions every morning at 10 a.m. in
the Union's Conversation Pit.

The annual Davidson visit of
Woodrow Wilson Visiting Fel-
lows is sponsored by the Wood-
row Wilson National Fellowship
Foundation established in 1945.
The National Foundation, located
in Princeton, N.J., is funded by
grants from corporations and
foundations.

According to the National
Foundation, the purpose in estab-
lishing the Visiting Fellows Pro-
gram is to bring non-academic
“successful representatives of the
various professions” to college
campuses, in order to “help stu-
dents relate their educations to the

» world outside the college.”

son included, to whom they would
send Fellows for three years at no
cost. The original coordinator at

Davidson was Dr. Randall Kin-
caid of the Economics Depart-
ment, and after several years he
was succeeded by Dr. Frank W.
Bliss, Chairman of the English
Department, who has coordinated
the program ever since.

The goal in having the Visi-
ting Fellows stay a week, accord-
ing to Bliss, is to have the Fellows
available for “different formats”
of lectures and discussions.

Fellows who have visited
Davidson in the past have in-
cluded former Senator Dick
Clark, Ambassador to Kenya Wil-
liam Attwood, and William Dyal,
Jr., President of AFS_ Interna-
tional.

“This is so they don’t come for
one lecture and then leave.”
explained Bliss. The format
seems to be working well. Of the
programs that bring visitors to
Davidson, Dr. Bliss said that “the
people who run the college regard
the Visiting Fellows Program as
