High in the Himalayas

Studies in Tibet open eyes, mind, and intestines.

By Renu Bhatt
Imagine being just a two hour
hike away from the waist-deep
snow of the Himalayas or being
blessed by His Holiness, the Dalai
Lama. For junior Brad Orr, last
semester "was a really amazing
experience” of travel, exploration,
learning, and discovery.
Asanescape from typical, mo-
notonous college life, Orr em-
barked on a Tibetan studies pro-
- gram which focused on learning
the Tibetan language. He said that
he wanted to go to either Nepal or
India, and with his program, he
was able to go to both as well as to
China.

. Sponsored by the School for °

International Training, the Tibetan
studies program is a series of lan-
guage, anthropology and lecture
classes which also includes a four
week independent study project.
Orr, a religion major with a
strong interest in philosophy, chose
to "analyze the Tibetan govern-
ment-in-exiles' foreign policy and
preparedness for twenty-first cen-

tury politics” for his independent
study.

Aside from learning the Ti-
betan language, Orr became well-
versed in Tibetan politics, art, and
religion. He spent most of his time
abroad in India; he stayed in Mcleos
Ganj, Dhaamsala, where the Dalai
Lama currently resides. Though
he was taught by two advisors, the
lectures were given by people from
the Tibetan community.

After five weeks of class work,
Orr and his group of 22 other stu-
dents set out to Katmandu, Nepal,
the nation’s capital, where he at-
tended lectures about the Tibetan
community in Nepal. Katmandu
“is a very interesting place,” Orr
says, It is like a “piece of New
York in the middle of Asia.”

After about a week in
Katmandu, Orr and two female
companions from his group re-
turned to India on a horrendous
three day train ride. He says they
sleptin train stations and had many
"extremely unpleasant, but great
experiences.” For‘example, men

on the trains offered him money
for his female friends, in search of
new wives, while.others harassed
the party in other ways!

Orr admits that his experiences:
abroad brought on some major
culture shock at first, but after be-
ing in southeast Asia for a semes-
ter, children begging in the streets,
lepers hobbling down the roads,
and people using the sidewalk for
a lavatory became common, nor-
mal and less shocking sights for
him. In fact, once he was home,
Orr says it seemed strange to him
that he was not being bothered in
the street, being cheated, or con-
stantly being stared at. Also, after
having enjoyed the Tibetan food
so much, he missed a lot of the
culture he had become so accus-
tomed to.

Though Orr did not have the
opportunity to visit many remote
villages, he did explore a few. He
went to one where they had never
seen white skin before. Still, he
assured me that the native people
in all three countries were always
very warm and welcoming.

Orr stayed with a host family
for the first five weeks that he was
in India. Though his host mother
spoke English fairly well, his host
father spoke Tibetan and very bro-
ken English; most of the time Brad
talked to them in English. Orr’s
host family was perhaps the
wealthiest family in town, with
seven small children in the ex-
tended household. He said they

, were wonderful and very loving

and fun.

’ After a few more weeks in
India and a pit stop of a few days in
Katmandu, Orr flew to Lhasa,
China, the capital of former Tibet
before it was taken over by the

Chinese. He spent three nights in
Lhasa, during which time he toured

Potala, the Dalai: Lama’s old pal- :

ace, and eighteen monasteries. Orr
then returned once again to
Katmandu on a bus, where he
stayed for three days before flying
back home to South Carolina.

So what did Brad Orr do for
fun? He told this interviewer that
bar hopping was basically the only
thing to do. He remarked that
though the countries are very strict
with their own citizens and en-
force things such as drinking laws
and curfews, there is "total free-
dom for tourists.”

Otherwise, he seems to have
spent plenty of time bonding with
his host father by engaging in their
favorite father-son pastime. He
also traveled a bit. Orr described
India, Nepal and China as "beauti-
ful.” He went on hikes, saw Mt.
Everest and "the. bluest, bluest
lakes.” Once, he and some friends
camped out on a riverbed, but he
emphasized with a smile that he
never at any point "roughed it.”

Overall, Orr’s experiences~
taught him a lot about the foreign
cultures in which he lived. When
asked to compare the United States
with India, Nepal and China, Orr
said that there are "so many differ-
ences that you can’t say one is
more major than the others. Their
concept of family is different.”

"Tibetans have had much
harder lives than Americans can
ever dream of.” There has been
tremendous persecution of Tibet-
ans who stayed in the Chinese oc-
cupied territories and did not flee
with the Dalai Lama. There has
been a constant movement to end
the persecution since China took it
over. Orr, however, was able to
meet “authentic” Tibetan people
and make friends with them.

Orr said that he would like to
go back and that he would suggest
that everyone go abroad. He nos-
talgically.added that he has put last
semester’s awesome experience
“on a pedestal” in his mind. “I like
living there. It’s a lot more free,
not as many rules.”

Dear Terry Buffington,

"Someone who cares"

Dear Terry,

We live in the new five, per-
son apartments, and though we
are enjoying the facility im-
mensely, we dohave one annoy-
ance. One of our group refuses
todo his share of the housekeep-
ing. He insists that washing his
own dishes should be enough,
and steers clear of mops vacu-
ums and all other cleaning de-
vices. He owns the TV and a
bunch of greatCD’s, so wedon’t
want to have to throw him out.
| What do you suggest?
Sincerely,

_Perturbed, Annoyed,
Pissed-Off and Dirty

Dear Perturbed, Annoyed,
Pissed-Off and Dirty,

This is touchy, because you
really don’t want to have one
roommate feel like the others
are teaming up against him. I
| can suggest several strategies:

Make him a deal. Some-
thing like “If we find dirty dishes
of yours, we get to put them in
your bed. You don’t have to
vacuum, but you can’t walk on
the floors. No cleaning the bath-

most certainly do even less.

rooms for you, but you have to go
next door to answer nature’ s call"
This approach does not force him
todoanything, but it should make
him realize the true cost of his
laziness.

Devise a Plan. Create a list
of different domestic jobs like
vacuuming, washing dishes,
cleaning toilets, etc.
that everyone in the apartment
complete a couple of jobs a week
in one of these areas. You can
record your work by putting your
initials next to the respective cat-
egory. With this idea everyone is
included inthe new cleaning plan.
You don’t want to make him feel
singled out. If you do this, he will

Beat him

If neither of the above op-
tions work, beat him. Come on
guys, there are four of you. Un-
less this guy is as thick as a stump
you should be able to take him.

I hope.at least some of these
suggestions can clean up your
little mess.

Love,

Terry
