Pass/fail deadline
extended three weeks

By MarcareT Brooks

Staff Writer

The faculty recently extended the
pass/fail deadline by three weeks,
effective this semester.

This change allows students to
wait until the Friday of the ninth week
of the semester, as opposed to the
previous six-week mark to submit
requests to take a credit-bearing
course for a pass or fail rather than a
grade.

For the 2004-2005 academic year,
those dates fall on October 22 and
March 18.

The SGA made it an initiative to
push back the pass/ fail deadline pri-
marily as response to numerous stu-
dent complaints about not having
received any grades by the original
deadline.

SGA _ President Katherine
Hubbard‘05 said, “We thought giv-
ing the three week extension would
give students more of achance to get

more of a feel for how they are doing
in the class.”

However, the pass/ fail option was
“never intended when it was first cre-
ated as an insurance policy, but as an
encouragement to students to venture
into unfamiliar territory,” according
to Registrar Hansford Epes.

“Most students use it now for
courses within the core requirement
that they do not want to take or are
nota part of their major requirement.
It gives them the freedom to concen-
trate on other classes that are of more

Police photography
causing some concern

Walker says photos from parties only used to
document ‘gross and negligent violations’

By Liz Barry
Staff Writer

The practice of police taking pho-
tographs at Martin Court parties has
sparked confusion and concern
among many students.

To address the issue, several PCC
presidents met with Chief of Police
Fountain Walker last Thursday to
discuss the purpose and necessity of
the photographs. -

Walker said the photographs
mainly serve as a means for docu-
menting crowd situations in which
“gross and negligent violations” of
Martin Court policy, suchas the con-
sumption of alcoholic beverages in
stairwells and open courtyards, are

present. He said the police do not use
them to single out students.

“Taking pictures enables me to
show my bosses the scene we’re
dealing with,” Walker said.

Casey Cox ’05, President of Rusk
Eating House, said that many stu-
dents were concerned with the prac-
tice because they believed the police
were using the pictures taken at a
recent Martin Court party to issue
alcohol citations to underage stu-
dents.

“The problem was that people
were not informed with why the po-
lice were taking pictures,” Cox said.
“If more students understood why
exactly they are used, I feel they

Students discuss Pre-O effects

Other school’s open-
ing minority pro-
grams to all students

Davidson’s programs for minority
students, including Students To-
gether Reaching for Individual De-
velopment in Education Program
(STRIDE), and specifically its Pre-
Orientation component (Pre-O),
have recently generated more pub-
lic discussion among Davidson stu-
dents, faculty, and administrators.

Incoming ethnic minority students
are invited to participate in the Pre-
O retreat, which takes place for four
days before the larger Freshman Ori-
entation. Several first year students
reported having lengthy discussions

groups during regular Freshman Ori-
entation. ;
Students from many different
backgrounds feel the separation of
minority students fosters segregation

~ on campus, having an overall nega-

tive effect on student life.

Others of various backgrounds
believe the impact overall is positive
in that it helps achieves Davidson’s
goal of creating a diverse student
body.

“I don’t think we find people seg-
regating more because of this pro-
gram,” said President Bobby Vagt.

Vagt added that “before this pro-
gram, retention and graduation rates
for minorities were less than average.
Currently, graduation and retention
rates are the same or higher than
average.”

According to Assistant Dean of

STRIDE mentor Shannon Bradshaw ’07 and two first
years discuss minority issues during Pre-Orientation.

Students Ernest Jeffries, Pre-O
“works on building that family kind
of environment that students can
draw on when things get tough.”

Janell Crayton 06, ablack student
on the basketball team, said she came
to Davidson already used to living in
an environment where she was a
minority. Crayton expressed a need
to ease minority students into think-
ing about their ethnicity in the con-
text of Davidson.

“Some minorities coming in are
going to have extraordinary culture
shock,” she said.

Crayton participated in STRIDE
during her freshmen year.

“T didn’t need it, but I loved it.”
Crayton said. “My old connections
are good, and they don’t limit me.”

Becky Nolin ’06, a white student
from California, has a number of
friends who participated in the pro-
gram.

“Practically, it’s excellent, it’s kept
people here, it makes students happy.
But principally, it concerns me
some...I dislike arguments in support
of their being a group assigned by

race,” she said

“Most students are glad minorities
are here but don’t understand what
[STRIDE] really does,” said Nolin.

STRIDE has evolved structurally
over the course of its charter and
currently has five components.

After Pre-O, STRIDE continues
throughout the year with the Peer
Mentor Program, Monthly Enrich-
ment Series, Mid-Year “Check Up,”
and End of the Year Recognition,
which will serve as a graduation from
the program.

Hanako Kawabata ’06 grew up in
Japan as a minority. She participated
in STRIDE and was a mentor her
sophomore year.

Kawabata said she often has con-
flicting feelings about the program,
noting that the minority population
at Davidson is not exclusive to race.

Kawabata stressed the importance
of building a “bigger bridge of mi-
norities as opposed to [dividing into]
specific groups.”

“You really have a minority expe-
rience if you don’t fit the majority [at
