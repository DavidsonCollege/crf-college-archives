Over Two Hundred Davidson Alumni

Attend Enthusiastic Associations

and Received Cordial Response

RICHMOND LARGEST

Philadelphia Decides to Organize—

Officers Are Selected at Other
Points

Dr. Walter |.. Lingle, president of David-

son, and Ernest Milton, alumni secretary,
completed on Tuesday night, March 18, one
of the most comprehensive alumni itineraries
ever planned and carried to completion by the
alumni office. Starting close hy, at Greens-
boro on March 10, these two Davidson re-
presentatives went as far north as Boston,
and attended several meetings in cities on
“their return from the furthermost point.
Slightly over 200 Davidson men attended the
sessions. .

Dinner-meetings were held at Greensboro,
Richmond, Washington, Baltimore, Philadel-
phia, New York and Boston. Smaller groups
af alumni are located at Princeton and New
Haven, and the schedule was so arranged
that a stop could be made at these points
for luncheon engagements and an informal
discussion of Davidson and her interests.

At every city Doctor Lingle spoke to an
interested group of men, and the reception
accorded him and his remarks was most
cordial. He outlined the physical tife of the:
campus, cited a number of changes which
had been wade in the curriculum, spoke of
the needs of the campus, and discussed some
of the problems confronting the institution.
In the open forums conducted after his ad-
dress, many of these items were elaborated
upon, and at his urgent solicitation the alum-
ni offered suggestions for the betterment of
the college.

The Richmond chapter had the largest
representation of any group. the number ap-
proaching sixty men. Slightly over 50 alum-
ni met in New York. With the exception of
New Haven and Princeton the alumni ranged
between twenty and twenty-five in attend-
nace. At New Haven there were nine men,
and at Princeton five.

Davidson alunini in Philadelphia, who have
been having annual meetings for the last
three years, decided to perféet an organiza-
tion. and accordingly they’ elected officers.
Boston, New Haven and Princeton did not
organize because of the transiency of the
alumni, but all other associations elected
officers. Elsewhere on this page is a list of
the new leaders. Other information regarding
this extensive trip can also be obtained from
several columns on this page.

Odds and Ends

(Pe tt Rn ne ee Det et nee Bt rt et eres OY

Davidson has five alumni studying at
Princeton in the graduate school and theo:
logical seminary, and every one of them at-
tended the luncheon, there on Thursday,
March 13. to have a 100 per cent attendance.
Ten Davidson men are located at New
Haven. Conn, and nine of these were at the
luncheon, giving them a percentage of 90.
It ts believed that the Princeton group has

made a record.
®

The class of 1928 had the largest number
of representatives at the nine alunimi meett-
ings. Thirty two ‘28ers attended. The class
of 1929 was second with 22 men, followed
by the class of 1927 with 17, and the. class
of 1926 with 15, In other words, 86 of the
total of over two hundred were irom the
last four classes which graduated at David-
son. This is indicative of two things: First,
that recent graduates have gone north ii
large numbers, and second, that the interest
of our younger alumni is very keen.

A guest at the New York alumni meeting
was 8. D. Pelham, of: New York, who said
that he had in his possession an adee which
was used i the construction of the first
Chamhers bniidiwe hack in the '60’s. He said
that it had been handed down in bis family,
and that 1 Davidsen had a museum that he
would give, it to the college. Doctor Lingle
graciously accepted it. Mr. Pelham is gome
to send it to Doctor Lingle, and will give
data regarding its history.

Bob Kirkpatrick assumed the role of cheer

great job of it. Another feature of that din
ner was a quartet composed of Jim Calizan,
Stud Cray, Tom Hamilton and John Cun-
ningham, the latter a graduate of Hlampden-
Sydney.

Exactly 41 changes of address have been
made on the alumni records as a result of
ofthe recent tnp. This is not anvthing out of
the extraordinary, for cach year this has been

done. Alumnt have not been educated to the

idea of sending in to the alumni ovfice a
notice of their change of address. Alumni
meetings always are a source of information.

The approaching engagements of several
of the alumni came to light in conversations
with. individuals, but no deginite announee-
ment has been made, and the names of the
men are being withheld until a “release date’
is obtained.

Alumni in Washington and Philadelphia
discussed the ieasibility of meeting together
oftener, and took definite action regarding
this. They wanted a dinner or luncheon at
which Davidson would be the principal dis-
cussion. Executive committees at hoth places
were cmpowered to act.

Such a trip as was recently made always
gives the alumni secretary an opportunity
to be of service to individual alumni. Several
requests were made of him during the tour,
and he has been busy fulfilling them since

What We Told The Alumni

By Dr. Walter L. Lingle

When we visited the nine Alumni Associa-
tions, extending from Greensboro, N. C., to
Boston, Mass., and they asked us to talk,
we generally gave them a broadside about
Davidson. Perhaps, a summary of what we
said may be interesting to our students and
to other alumni.

1. Faculty—Davidson now has 45 men in
her faculty. They have all done graduate
work at great universities, and the large
majority of them hold high degrees from the
best universities of America and Europe.

dents “Have registered at Davidson. The

Impressions
By Dr. Walter L. Lingle

oe

Our journey took us to the annual meet
ings of nine different Davidson College Al-
umni Associations, ranging. all the way from
Greenshoro, North Carolina, to Boston, Mass.
Mr. Ernest Milton, our efficient Afumni
Secretary, has written concerning the details
of these meetings. 1 have been zequested to
give my impressions.

First of all. fet-me say, that it is a great
inspiration to the President of an institu-
lion to know that there are Giue groups of
Alumni in so many important eities and
centers, who have an ever increasing love

J and loyalty for the old*College. At cach place

| felt that the group at the next could not
possibly be sa fine or- so: enthusiastic. But
they ‘were.

! appreciate with all my heart the cordial
ani courteous way in which we were re-
cetved at every place. The Alumni groups in
the dillereat places seem to vie with each
other in theie corcliatily and hespitality, They
warqyed our hearts.

It was worth a’great deal to us lo visit
institunons. like Johns Hopkins. Princeton,
Vale and Harvard. Wahile those are great
universities, one can gather trour them a
grea. inany suggestions for the smaller col
lege. In all of those university centers we
ound Davidson graduate students taking
high stands. Sometimes people have inti
mated that Davidson is not sending a suffi
cient number of her graduates to the great
universities to do graduate work. Maybe so,
hut 1 wonder ii they realize how many we
are sending. | am sure that L never realized
beiore how many former students we have in
universities doing graduate work.

In every place our Alumni showed the

_Keenest interest in everything that is going

on al Davidson. They asked about the var
ious members of the faeatty. staff workers,
students and janitors. They also asked about
new binidings, new courses of study, and
su forth,

Our Alumni at the University centers
also had many suggestions to make when

the tacctings were thrawn open tor SUR BES -

lions. No time was spent in reminiseing and
rehearsing college boy pranks and faculty

registration last year was 611. Of the 617
students with (us this year. 347 are trom

‘North Carolina, and the other 270 are trom

25 other states and countries. Our stndents
are preparing tor the following professions:
Business. 96: Medicine, 93: Ministry, 79:
Law. G3: Teaching. 35: Wmgineering. 29:
cighteen other professions, 53: and 157 are
widecided.

3. Finances The endowinent of Davidson
in round numbers is $900,000. The buildings
and grounds are worth more than $1,500,000.
Thus, the total asscts of the College amount
to about $2,500,000. Our annual budgct of
expenditures is about $300,000. Of_this
amount we receive about $53,000 as income
from endowment, and about $70,000 from the
Duke Foundation. Practically all the re-
mainder of the budget has to come from stu-
dent fives. The income of the Duke Endow-
ment is largely dependeiit upon the success
of the industrial incorporations in which
the endowment is invested. It is, therciore,
impossible for the endowment to guarantee any
fixed annual amount. It can only pay what
it makes. Davidson College, along with other
institutions, is deeply indebted to Mr. Duke.
It is sometimes supposed that Davidson is
rich and tacks nothing. The expansion of
the college has heen so great in recent
years that the annual budget of. expenses
is already equal to the income and sometimes
greater. Before there can be any further
expansion there will have to be a larger
income. '

4. New Chambers has been completed and
will be dedicated at the next Commencement.
The total cost was approximately $625,000.
{t is almost perfect in every way. There is
only one serious defect. The acoustics of
the banquet hall are very bad. Experts have
estimated that it ean be cured for $3,150.00.
We wish that we had that. amount. There is
still a debt on the New Chambers Building
of about $70,000. There are about $70,000

eccentricities. After we had made short talks,
the remainder of the time at cach place was
spent in asking amd answering questions and
in making suggestions which might be help-
ful to the faenity. We all felt that these mect-
ings should de used for inspirational and
constructive purpose.

There was something d:stinetive about cach
Alunni group. At Johns Hopkins one in-
stinctively felt that he was in an academic
atinosphere. lu New York we felt that we
were in a business atmosphere. By the way,
a_business man who has been in New York
ior many years and has many business con-
tacts and attends many business meetings
said that the mecting of the Davidson Alum-
niin New York is composed of the finest
group of men that he ever meets in that great
city.

I greatly enjoyed the close fellowship with
Ernest Milton, our Alumni Secretary. For
those ten days, we traveled together, roomed
together, ate together, talked together, and
had all things in common. As a result, 1
know him better and like him even better
than-ever. Re knows the Alumni. At Greens-
boro each alumnus introduced the man on
his right. At the close of the introductions
a trustee laid a half dollar on the table and
said that he had put it there for the man
who would arise and call every man present
by his name. At my request Ernest Milton
arose and named every man. He could have
dbne the same thing at all nine of our meet-
ings.

| do not know how Alummni..feel about it,

itinerary among our Alumni was well worth
all the time and labor that we put into it.
We can visualize the Davidson Alumni out
in the world at their life work as we could
not do hefore. Not only so, but we brought
back many valuable suggestiois which will
be helpful for years to come.
