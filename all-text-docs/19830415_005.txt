Circa 1860 Davidson College commissioned JW. Orr, a New York engraver, to make a
woodcut of the first Chambers building. Although Orrâ€™s original has-been Jost, a few
pieces of stationery on which the woodcut adorned the letterhead have been preserved.
This facsimile of the Orr letterhead was made from a letter written by J.M. Potts on 1
August 1863. Louis Orr, a descendent of J.W. Orr, made the contemporary series of
etchings of North Carolina scenes that hang on the main floor of the E.H. Little Library.
