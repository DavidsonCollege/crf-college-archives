As we come to the
end of the year, we
look back at the
things‘ done during
this time. One of the
outstanding things
is sports.

Let us first look
at football. Under
the coaching of
Hudson and Shep-
ard, the team did
pretty good consid-
ering the material.
Because most of the
squad were inexper-
. ienced, the team was

forced to play as a freshmen -team. Games were ar-

ranged with prep and high schools. The first game was

played with Woodbury, whtch had a very heavy and on a

whole pretty fair team. This game ended ina 6-6 tic.

The Cats loqied pretty good, being as it was-their first
- game. The season went on, and more games wére played.

By FRITZ KEESLER

The Cats beat Darlington prep in Rome, Ga. 13-7. The

game was close from the beginning. The Cats scored
first, but soon found the fast little prep boys in the lead
7-6. In the last quarter the Cats scored on a pass.and won
the game.
the season with. Next year Coach Shepard says he has
some good players in the line. It is not certain whether
or not it will be a freshmen or a varsity team. It all de-
pends on the material. Everyone knows that Coach Shep-
ard will do his part and do it well.

.

From this years team there are several coming back.
Big Bob Strickland willbe on hand. Bob played tackle this
year. However, since he has shown such spced in track,
he may possibly be converted to fullback. Whatever he
plays, h really ought to be good next year. John Sherrill
arid Dave Neill will also be on hand. They played second
string this’ year, and ought to turn out good next year.

In basketball the: team did very well,
part of the season Jim J-owry was around, and-he was the
nucleus of the team. ‘The tcam was inexperienced for a
college team, but they really did good. At the end of the
Semester, several of gite Tirst string Icft, but there were
others to step into tMft~ptaces. The team won about 9
games and lost an equal number, which is not so bad,
realizing the teams that were played. Seven men rcccived
letters: Wall, Berry, O’Briant, Neill, Blackburn, Scar-
borough, and Etheridec.
be back next year,
rill, who played a bit, but not enough to get a letter.
next year should shape up pretty well. °

The baseball team looked good at times, but at
other times it looked rather sorry. Coach Shepard (Con-
nic.Mack) was unable to find many small coflege teams
to play: therefore, not many games were played. It is too
soon now to say anything about the baseball team for next
‘vear. .

The boys really took a’ big interest in Intramural
Sports. In football the Kappa: Sigs-Kappa Alpha team
proved itself superior. In basketball the Betas, Spe’s and
Independents tied. They were pretty good, but the other

Also coming back will be John Sher-
The

teams looked as good. The Tournament: was really close

and interesting. In softball the Independents seemed to
have won. There weren't as many games played as the
Boys had hoped, but if was a Tot of ftin anyway. This year
there was’an Intramural track meet. The Independants
aiso won that. It wasa good meet and it brought out many
good track men. The 100 and 220 were. very g ood.
Every ycar the team participating in intramural
sports that gets the most points, receives the big trophy.
«For ihe last two years the Kappa Sigs have had possession
of it. This year the Independents have won it. The

trophy is kept by the fraternity winning it for a year, and

- then it-goes to the one who wins'it the next year.

During the spring everyone_seems to have gotten
spring fever. Even Coachés*dog, Skipper, doesn’t run
around as much, and when no one is looking he drinks
