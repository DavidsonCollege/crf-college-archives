OUR DERATERS.

Can you recall the first time you spoke
in Literary Society, when you found
yourself scrutinized by scores of critical
eyes? Somehow the floor seemed to re-
cede, and the room rocked in a danger-
ous manner. Your temples burned, and
you were conscious of your nose grad-
wally turning a delicate lobster _ red.
And all the while your empty. mind was
searching for the opening words of you
speech.

Remembering this. can it fail to excite
you to admiration when from out of our
midst there rise two who have the cour-
age to face a thousand Winthropites, and
not only that. but who can argue so
forcefully and convincingly that an op-
posing, tho able team, is defeated by the
unanimous vate of the judges? ‘Those
who attended the debate report that
there flowed from the representatives of
Davidson, rivers of eloquence rarely sur-
passed in those old halls. And truly,
men who have, unnoticed, spent the
greater part of six weeks in strenuous
preparation, and bv a final effort have
extended Davidson's influence and pres-
tige, are worthy of praise and esteem
from the men on the campus.

Next week another Davidson debating
team will meet Emory, which has the
record of never having lost a series of
debates, and their defeat by Davidson
last year was the first in eight years.
Why not give our debaters some of the
praise and help due them before they go.
and cheer them on to victory.

THE MAGAZINE REFORM.

Tue Davinsontan is by no means
antagonistic to the Davidson College
Magazine. So we can truthfully sav
that we are glad that plans are being
adopted looking toward a renewed in-
terest and a new lease on life for the
Magazine. A revision of the Constitu-

.|is in you,

tion was adopted in the Eumenean So-
ciety last Monday morning and is to be
voted on in the Philanthropic Society,
which provides that the editorial board
will be cut down from twelve associate
editors to four. These editors will have
direct control of the Magazine's policy.
and will oversee the literary work rather
than do it themselves, They will inject
as much competition as possible into the
work and will plan for novel produc-
tions and departments.

The fact that very little interest is
now taken in the Magazine is a lament-
able one. This is one of the most at-
tractive fields in all college work. And
who knows but what some literary gen-
ius is budding unseen around here. Who
knows but what an O. Henry is shel-
tered (in a way) by Rumple, or Cham-
bers, or even Georgia. It is your duty
to bring out the best literary talent that
