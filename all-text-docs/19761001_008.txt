Students taste States at Davidson

By MARIELLE SAWADA
Staff Writer

Getting a taste of the American
experience through Davidson College
while contributing to the life at
Davidson are this year’s international
students. These students come to
Davidson from all parts of the world.
They are here, not so much to fill
degree requirements (since most are
receiving no credit for their work), but
to become ‘‘enlightened’’ on the
American way of life.

“Oh, we are very excited about this
group,” said Louise Thompson of the
Office of International Education.

improvements in the program is the

Sports interests are many and
varied,.but his favority is tennis. He
has just become a member of the
Davidson tennis team.

A little uncertainty makes him
hesitate before committing himself as

a pre-med major. ‘It is very hard (to {

get into medical school) in the

Netherlands, as it is here in the jute

United States.’

Jasjit Singh Bhattal of India has
had a rough beginning at Davidson.
‘“T’ve never been sick a day in my
life,’’ said Bhattal as he lay in the
infirmary ward. Bhattal spent close to
a week with a fever and a virus. ‘‘Yes,

each student’s ‘‘host family’’ are
trying to make each student’s stay
worthwhile and enjoyable.

“*T’m feeling a part of life here,’’
said Manifred Bock of Germany. ‘I
_ came because I wanted to experience
life in America. I am an English
major and I want to be a high school
teacher in Germany, so it ail made
sense.”

Bock has found the Davidson
system of education to be somewhat
different from what he is accustomed
to. Though there is as much studying
to be done, the German student is
more on his own.

The youngest international student
is Allard Castelein of the Nether-
lands. Because his brother was an
international student at Davidson
five years ago, Allard knew much
about the school before arriving.

“I think that my expectations of
college life are being met. My brother

Bhattal hopes to go into inter-
national relations...‘‘maybe at Flet-
chers in Massachusetts.’’ Beyond
that he plans perhaps to stay in the
United States or to get a government
job in India.

“I study here,” says Mireille Pont
of France, ‘‘but in France, Idon’t. We
go to lectures, with sometimes as
many as six hundred other students,
take a few notes, read some books and
take examinations in June. And
sometimes we pass and sometimes
fail.’’

Though Pont feels a part of the

Davidson community, she said that

she is not planning to get involved in
student activities. ‘“‘I feel that-I-need
to be free to go places when I want to.
Plus I need to be available to help the
French students here.’’

It’s a gift, especially for you, the
Davidson College student; compli-
ments of the Union: one ton of clay.
And it is only one of many possible
art opportunities found in the Union’s
Arts and Crafts Room.

Said room, dedicated to the student
who is interested in creative art, is
through the TV Lounge, up one flight
of stairs, the first door on the left.
Inside are a kiln, two potter’s wheels,
various tools and glazes, and 2,000
pounds of fresh clay. These facilities
are open to all Davidson students.

If a student is interested in making
ceramic pots, vases, or even a
symbolic image of a beloved profes-
sor, he should contact Ruth Brown
"17, the coordinator of the Union art
activities, or John Trout ’79. After
learning the rules and responsibilities
for use of the art room, the student’s
name will be registered at the Union
desk. He can then obtain the key and
work at his convenience.

For the student who has had no
previous experience in ceramics, the
Union offers classes, taught by Trout.
These informal sessions presently
meet from 8 to 10 pm on Tuesdays,
and if enough interest is generated,
will also be held on Thursday even-
ings and Saturday mornings. Once
there, students learn the techniques
for molding clay (either by hand or
wheel) and applying the glazes. In
addition to ordinary glazes, Trout
hopes to use an ancient Japanese
glazing technique called Raku. Trout

Arts and Crafts offers
pounds of fresh clay

also plans an exhibit of ceramic wares

‘made by students to be held in the
Union on a Saturday morning near
the end of each term.

The costs for the ceramics are 16
cents per pound of clay plus nominal
charges for the glazes, depending
upon which colors and combinations
are chosen.

In addition to recreation, these
activities can have other benefits, i.e.
credit. This is arranged through a
professor in the art department,
usually as an extended study ona
contract basis.

Ceramics is not the only art activity
offered by the Union. The budget sets
aside $750 annually for various art
activities, and future possibilities
include classes in sculpture (to be
taught by a Davidson art major), silk
screening, copper sculpture, and
stained glass.

A community arts and crafts
exhibit and sale is planned for
October 23, and there is a possibility
that the Union art facilities will be
opened for use by the YM/YWCA
STEP tutors and their kids.

Any student with experience or
interest in these or any other creative
art is encouraged to contact Brown
for details. In addition, she is looking
for someone who is interested in
helping her coordinate these Union
programs.

It’s all there for the taking. So the
next time you get tired of memorizing
formulas and wading through philo-
sophical arguments, show your auth-
ority. Release those frustrations on a
wet, hunk of clay.

“INTERNATIONAL students becoming “enligh-
tened” on the American way of life hopefully ye
will enlighten Davidson.

telephones in the dorm rooms has
surprised Pont, along with the fact
that the campus is so noisy at night.
At 10 pm, ‘‘everything seems to wake
up.”

“I feel a part of the Davidson
community but then it was easier for
me since I speak English,’’ said
Andrew Doig of England. His inter-
ests range from photography to
sailing to hot-air ballooning. He has
traveled all over Europe and has even

spent several weeks in the Soviet
Union.

Though coming from a small
school, Doig has found Davidson to
be very different-for him. “There is so
much more pressure here. All of the
students spend so much time work-
ing.”

Hiroshi Nishimura of Japan came
to the United States with his parents’
fears that his English would be a
problem and with his friends’ worries
that there would be no Orientals in
the southern part of the United
States. To help him become more
proficient in English, Nishimura
spent three weeks prior to the
beginning of classes at Belmont,
studying English. Although that has
helped him, he still has difficulty
understanding his professors because
they speak so fast.

Nishimura is of the Buddhist
religion. He explained that Buddhism
is not as strong as it once was in
Japan. Now most of the Japanese
have no religion.

Nishimura laughs at the thought of
water fights and sighs when he looks
at his physics textbook.

“T would like to travel every-
where,’’ exclaimed Francoise Gilson
of France. ‘‘It is very hard because of
money —the U.S. is so immense. It is
easier to get around France.”

Gilson loves music and dancing.
She studied piano for many years, but
there came a point when she decided
that she could no longer spend eight
hours a day at the piano. Now she
aspires to be an English teacher.

-Vance Polley

Andres Perez comes to Davidson
from a university in Madrid, Spain.
He has already found the atmosphere
at Davidson much more conducive to
study. In Madrid, he explained, there
are police and guns around.

Although he has been in Davidson
for less than a-week, Perez already
has a busy schedule. He tutors
Spanish students, works with an
independent student, takes two
classes, and plays on the soccer team.
Perez is a language major, but he is
having a little difficulty with his
English. However, this is more than
understandable since he has had
approximately five months’ study of
English-

Two of the eleven:international
students are four-year students at
Davidson. Both are from Hong Kong
and are in their second year here.

Richard Tong, a pre-med major,
with a four-course load, is aware of
the problems that face a non-citizen
when trying to get into medical
school. Because of that, he is keeping
his options open to other graduate
studies.

The other student is Fai Wong. Fai
is a teacher on campus as well as a
student. She teaches two students
beginning Chinese. Unsure of any
future plans, she continues to be
involved in her many studies.

One other international student,
Emmanuel Bango of Zaire, is having
trouble leaving his country and has
not arrived at Davidson yet.

What do people in other countries
think of the United States?

“The people that I know are those
that are fond of the United States. Of
course there are different factions.’’

“People in my country think that
Americans are very wasteful.”

“Students don’t think well of the
United States.”

“We think of Americans in terms of
business.’’

“People think that Americans are
rich, chew gum, and are immature,
but well advanced in certaip areas like
psychology and nuclear science.’
