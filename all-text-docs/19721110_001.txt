Student-Faculty Relations Declining

AN ANALYSIS
By ALAN FORD
Staff Writer
(Ed. Note: This is the firstina
series of two articles
concerning faculty-student
relations. This week we

examine the problems; next
week we look at the solutions. )

The student-faculty
relationship. What is it? How
does it relate to me? How do I
relate to it?

These questions are being
asked by both students and
faculty. Davidson College is a
place where this relationship
between students and faculty
members is supposed to be
‘“‘good,’’ whatever that term
means.

It seems, however, that a
good relationship does not exist,
at least not for some students.

Many people feel that
relationships between students
and faculty tend to be purely
academic, or slanted in that
direction. Malcolm Partin,
professor of history, points out
that there is almost no social
relationship between students
and faculty.

Partin, as well as other
faculty members and students,
feels that this results in an
inability of students to see
faculty members as ‘‘real”’
people.

Mike Collins and Steve Suflas,
seniors, and Lanny Vincent, a
junior, see this avoidance of
social relationships with faculty
members as a carry-over from
high school.

Suflas says this student-

=

faculty stigma affects both
professors and _ students, but
not to the same degree.

According to Collins, this
feeling toward professors
begins in the freshman _ year.
Freshmen see upperclassmen
putting faculty members on an
intellectual pedestal.

Jim McNair, a junior, echoes
French Professor Hallam
Walker's statement that some
students are wary of
approaching professors
because they do not want to be
labeled ‘‘brown-nosers."’

Vincent feels that Davidson is
tov academically oriented for

social contacts between
students and faculty to be
fostered. He says that Davidson
students have a tendency to
become ‘‘social nurds’’ after
four years here.

Charlie Davis, a senior, feels
that one of the reasons that the
student-faculty relationship is
not as good as it could be is that
students are too conscious of
putting their best foot forward
to really relax and enjoy
knowing a professor.

Several professors note that
one difficulty in improving
student-faculty relations is that
too many students refuse to
take any of the initiative.

The old policy of faculty open
house died out with student
disinterest as one of the main
causes of its demise. Dean of
Students Will Terry adds that
students ‘‘have been careless to
the point of being rude’’ in
relationships with faculty.

Students also feel that
students should supply a large
part of the initiative. McNair
observes that in all the student
faculty relationships that he has
seen where a student put

out some effort, he was
rewarded by a good
relationship.

Other students agreeing with
this observation are Suflas,

he

Davis, SGA President Ralph
Peeples, Vincent, Collins and
Bruce Becker.

Malcolm Lester, professor of
history, voices the opinion that
the initiative should come from
both the student and the faculty
member.

Terry agrees and says that
faculty members should make
themselves available and that
students should take advantage
of the opportunity.

The disparity in ages between
faculty and students is also
cited as a reason for difficulty
in getting a student faculty
relationship started.

year » Graduate Study
Committee questionnaire
distributed to members of the
Class of 1972.

A substantial number of those
seniors ‘thought that Davidson
hadn't lived up to its reputation
in the area of advising,
especially in terms of graduate
schools,” explained Peeples.

Senator Todd Eades, who
devised the questions for the
Senate survey, claims that the
poll is simply ‘‘to get
information, to see if there is a
problem in this area, where the
problems are, and how to
correct them.”

Both Peeples and Eades
made it clear however, that
the poll was not designed to
establish any specific blame on
any one department.

The questionnaire divides the
general area of advising into
specific groups, concentrating
on freshman and graduate
school counseling.

Not only are the freshmen
asked their feelings on the
quality of advice they have
received from faculty advisors,
but faculty members are also
asked to voice their opinions on
how the system could work
better.

Both constituencies are also
asked about the current state of
social relations between faculty
and students. Opportunities to
list improvement suggestions
are also included in the survey.

Another aspect of the
questionnaire includes asking
students whether or not they
feel they are receive ing enough

Terry Announces 1973 Recess

By JIM PAULSEN
Staff Writer

After experiencing a two-day
program of freshman
conferences, plans now call for
working towards a College
Conference Recess for next
year, according to Dean of
Students Will Terry.

“It seeems to me _ that
Freshman Conference Days
would work better if it was a
college-wide opportunity to
enable more students to have
time to sit down with faculty
advisors and consider. course
selection, vocational and career
choices.” said Terry

Freshman Conference Days
began on Monday with General
Knowledge Inventory Tests.
These tests covered the areas of
Humanities, Social Science and
Natural Science and lasted for
the entire morning.

After a break for lunch,
freshmen met in small groups
to discuss the extended studies
program. Much of the rest of
the conference involved faculty-
student meetings in which
students tried to plan ahead for
all four years, instead of just
the next term.

“IT learned that) many
freshmen used the time very
well to do some serious thinking

and planning for four years
here at Davidson,” said Terry.
“Others did not, but were
generally cooperative. Some
refused to cooperate and they
will be contacted."’ he said.
There were 55 students who
did not take the General
Knowledge Inventory Tests.
“There will be a time set
aside in which those freshmen
who ignored the test and did not
cooperate will take it. They will
be receiving additional word
from me about that,’ Terry
said.
General freshman reactions

pesonal attention by their
advisors, and whether the latter
are readily available fo:
counseling. Both Peeples are
Eades hope the survey will
highlight any weaknesses that
may exist in pre-med, pre-law,
and general graduate school
advising.

One of the more interesting
aspects of the survey,
according to Eades, will be the

interest expressed in a plan
allowing students to declare a
major in their sophomore year
in order that they may more
adequately plan their schedule
in conjunction with their major
advisor.

Questions designed to see if
the student knows where to seek
the right help if he needs it are
also included.

Fogleman Submits
Soccer Resignation

By JOE EARLE
Sports Editor

Harry Fogleman, coach for
the Davidson soccer and tennis
teams, has officially requested
that he be relieved of his fall
coaching position.

Fogleman submitted a letter
of resignation to Tom Scott,
director of athletics, and John
M. Bevan, vice president for
academic affairs, Wednesday
in which he asked to be replaced
as head coach for the soccer
team.

Fogleman said he intends to
continue as coach for the tennis
team, but felt that someone else
was needed to coach the soccer
team. ’

He said that he was forced to
resign because the time needed
to coach the booters was
keeping him from being an
effective coach for either the
soccer or tennis teams.

He pointed out all the time
needed to handle the details of a
sport, such as setting up
schedules, taking care of road
trips, and said that he was
putting in between one and two
hours a day on the team outside
of regular practice time.

Fogleman also stated that
other pressures, including the
administration's desire to start
a girl’s tennis team, were part
of his decision.

Scott said that he had
received the letter, but that he
and Bevan had not had time to
confer on the situation and that
he had no idea of what decision
would be made.

Fogleman submitted his
resignation from the same
coaching position last year, but
was asked to take the job back

when no substitute could be
found.

At that time, the job was
offered to Peter Sterling, who
was serving as the team’s
assistant coach, but he had to
turn it down due_ to
commitments to the College
Union.

Scott said he felt that the job
would have to be handled by
someone from within the
college administration, and that
no new coaches would be hired
from outside the college.

He further indicated that he
had no idea who would be able
to handle the job.

Scott denied that the position
could be filled by Chip Stone,
the present head of the physical
education program, because he
felt his job took up too much
time.

“He holds a full time job,”
Scott said, ‘‘and wouldn't have
time for coaching. Also, if we let
him coach soccer, the football,
basketball, and track coaches
would all want him to help.”’

Stone played all those sports
while a student at UNC, and is
presently a qualified soccer
referee.

Fogleman informed the
soccer team of his decision
after their loss Tuesday to
Appalachian.

Team members said he told
them that he planned to resign

and congratulated them on
their season.
Both Bevan and_ Scott

indicated that they would try to
consider possible replacements
for Foglimman by the end of the
week.

“We will try to do what ever is
best for Coach Fogleman.”
Bevan said.
