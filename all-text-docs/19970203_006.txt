Diplomatic Relations will not change despite
“widespread” human rights abuses in China

The State department an-
nounced its critical report of “wide-
spread and well documented” hu-
man rights abuses in China last
week. But most officials will say
the policy of Most Favored Nation
trading status and high level visits
and talks with China shall remain
unchanged.

The reports cites China for
holding thousands of political and
religious prisoners and said that
“all public dissent was effectively
silenced.”

Chinese officials called the
U.S. actions “interference” in its
personal affairs.

New Secretary of State

Madeline Albright plans to keep
her trip to Beijing and indicates that
she will not ignore the issue of hu-
man rights.

In 1992 President Clinton cam-
paigned against the current U.S.
policy in China and hinted that he
would revoke the trading status.
However, under pressure from U.S.
businesses in China, he did not take
any action.

The administration now looks
as if it will engage China through
trade and diplomacy instead of pro-
tectionism and approbation.

China is undergoing an emer-
gence after years of keeping its
economy in check to fight off infla-

tion and to control growth. It also
could be in the midst of a change in
power. The new regime could be
more conducive to civil liberties or
might not even continue to pursue
market reforms.

The handling of Hong Kong’s
return to China this year will defi-
nitely signal to the U.S. the Chinese
commitment to fair trade and toler-
ance for basic human rights.

Until then, the Clinton admin-
istration looks as if it will continue
its wait-and- see approach to what
has now become known as the dif-
ficult issue of “China.”

Congress tackles balanced budget amendment

The Framers never wanted the
Constitution to be easily changed.
As the difficulty in passing the bal-
anced budget amendment indicates,
their designs have worked well to
achieve that purpose.

After the Senate Republicans
achieved a 55-45 majority during
the last elections, most policy ana-
lysts thought a balanced budget
would easily pass. It failed by only
one vote in the last session, as Re-
publican Mark Hatfield of Oregon
joined 33 Democrats to kill the
amendment.

However, this year, all Repub-
licans support the bill and only need
12 Democrats to pass it.

The House is ready to pass the
amendment at any time and is only
waiting for Senate action first. It

does not look as if it will receive any
trouble there.:

Last week, the Senate Judiciary
Committee passed the bill on a 13-
5 vote. But the bill looks like it will
have trouble clearing the Senate
due to two Democrats in particular
and a squabble over the budget cal-
culating formula.

The Senate Republicans can
only rely on the votes of 10 Demo-
cratic Senators. Senator Joe Biden
(Dem. - Del.) and Senator Robert
Torricelli (Dem. New Mexico)
might also vote for the bill, but are
demanding big concessions.

They want the bill to possibly
exclude Social Security and capital
investments (roads, bridges, etc.)
from the provisions of a balanced
budget. Republican sponsors say

that would be too big a loophole and
really just make the bill ineffectual.
President Clinton does not sup-
port the amendment, but he has no
formal voting power in stopping it.
After a two-thirds approval in
Congress, the possible amendment
will go to state legislatures. A rati-
fication of the amendment by two-
thirds of all states will also be re-
quired for the official inclusion of
the amendment into the Constitu-
tion.
Here the bill looks as if it will
find little trouble as long as the
economy does well and public mood

(70% want the amendment) stays

constant.

French move closer to privatizing their social security

A bill to introduce private pension funds cleared one of its last hurdles
on the way to becoming law. But,.the Socialist Party has vowed to
repeal it if it gains power in 1998. Most opponents of the bill say it is
too risky to trust the retirement of the country’s workers to the ups and
downs of the market. However, some countries, like Chile, have
already done this move with similar programs and say it is more
efficient and eventually better for taxpayers than state run systems.
