AN ANALYSIS
By GRAY WILSON
Managing Editor

Most of the students and a
few faculty, are generailly
hacked at the administration
over the overnight rush to
register. \

College Registrar Richard
C. Burts Jr. explained that
with the new system ‘‘stu-
dents can know right away
what courses they are in ias
opposed ‘to earlier registra-
tion where students request-
ed courses through their
advisors and found out in the
summer what they could not
take.

“We can have a much
tighter schedule by taking
registration term by term
rather than for ithe whole
year.”’

Burts ‘added that students
registering for the fall term
now would register for the

year in February.

“The reason for the push
this time,"’ he said, “was
mainly that the course of in-
struction booklet we had
counted on getting and on
which registration largely
depends was dellayed."’

This booklet was due at the
college last Friday. It’ has
not yet finished publication
however. In its place the
registrar's office .ran off a
Substitute shorter booklet.

‘Burts said that he hoped

next time to have a minimum
of two weeks advance notice

‘ for students before registra-

tion, ‘and thiat the foul-up this
time was only procedural.
SGA President Danny Clod-

felter believes that ‘‘in prin-
ciple the system is better
than the one before, Dut the

simple fact is that it is not
an effective working system
yet.

“It is ridiculous to miail out
these registration forms two
days before you declare a
major and without a course
booklet to look iat. The good

thing about the system is
that it will give the professor
a chance to wave the Ceiling
on a particular course, in-
stead of ithe registrar's of-
fice."

Raculty reaction to the new
registration was. far from
complacent. Several profes-
sors were distnessed that
they would have to keep such
long hours while students
wandered around booking for
prospective advisors.

‘We've been setting the.
ceiling before on class sizes,
but the good purpose of ‘the
system now is that the pro-
fessor can make exceptions
whereas it was eft up to the
registrar before."

But maybe not.

It depends on your sign. Because Taurus has a powerful mean streak.

There's a helluva fire in the Bull.

So check your stars. They'll tell you straight if you're the kind of
person who can meet Schlitz Malt Liquor head-on.

Nobody makes malt liquor like Schlitz. Nobody.
