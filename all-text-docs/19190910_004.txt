Dr. Shearer, Noted Chris-
tian Educator Passes
Away.

End Came Quietly During Past
Summer at His Home in
Davidson.

The many friends and acquaintances
of Dr, J. B. Shearer were grieved to
learn of his death on the 14th of last
June. Dr. Shearer lacked only a month
and five days of being 87 years old. His
death came after a lingering illness of
several months. ‘Ihe funeral services
were conducted in the Davidson College
Church by Dr. C. M. Richards and Dr.
Wilson McKay. Remarks were made
by Dr. W. J. Martin and Dr. C. R.
Harding.

The importance of Dr. Shearer's
work in behalf of Christian education
can hardly he over-estimated, As _presi-
dent of Stewart College in Clarkesville,
Tenn., Dr. Shearer succeeded in putting
that institution on the , firm financial
footing which has enabled it to do such
good work as Southwestern Presbyterian
University. Leaving Southwestern he
came to take up the duties of President
of Davidson College at a time when it
had reached its lowest ebb of popular-
itv. During -his thirteen years of ser-
vice in this capacity he not only dou-
bled the number of students attending
the college but laid the foundaticn for
all ‘of its subsequent growth, In addi-
tion to this work. he has given buildings
on the campuses of Davidson, College,
Mitchell College. and Southwestern
Presbyterian University, as well as
thousand of dollars to other schools,
churches, and hospitals.

Perhaps Dr. Shearer's greatest work,
however, was as the founder of the chair
of English Bible in the Christian schools
and colleges of the country. He him-
self was a Bible teacher, whom few ever
equalled, and his teaching as well as his
saintly fife was an inspiration to hun-
dreds of students. In addition to his
work as teacher, Dr. Shearer wrote a
number of books on Bible study, in de-
fense of the Christian religion, and in
behalf of Christian education.

Dr. Shearer has for so many long
years been an outstanding figure in the
Southern Assembly and has been so
prominently connected with the Church’s
work, notably in its educational depart-
ments that the main facts of his life are
on record in many publications. They
have appeared in print so often as to call
for only the briefest mention here.

These facts are given at some length
and in appreciative form in a biographi-
cal sketch prepared by the late Rev. Dr.
J. Rumple. of Salisbury, for the Bio-
graphical History of North Carolina,
Vol. VILL (Ashe, Weeks, VanNoppen).

John Bunyan Shearer was born in
Appomattox County, Va., July 19, 1832.
He was the oldest son of the seven chil-
dren of John Akers Shearer and_ his
wife, Ruth Akers Webber. The Akers
were Welsh stock, the Webbers Dutch,
the Shearers English Puritan, so that
the subject of this sketch was a compo-
site of three nationalities in equal pro-
portion.

He was educated at Hampden-Sidney
College (A.B., A.M... ‘49-’51) and at
the University of Virginia (A.M., ’51-
’54). His record at both institutions
were prophetic of the distinction that
was to mark all of his subsequent life.
After teaching a year, he entered Union
Theological Seminary, Virginia, from
which institution he was graduated in
57. He acted as stated supply for sev-
eral churches in Virginia prior to being
called to the pastorate at Chapel Hill,
where he remained from '58 to ‘62.

L

From '62 to '70 he was stated supply at
Spring Hill and Mt. Carmel churches,
Halifax County, Va. While here he
established and conducted the Cluster
Springs High School, an institution that
still lives and continues under other
managements to testify to his wisdom in
its founding.

In '70 he was called to the presidency
of Stewart College, and thence to occu-
py the same position at Davidson in ’88.

Dr. Shearer was honored with the
degree of D.D. by, Hamuden-Sidney
College, and with the degree of LL.D.
by the Southwestern Presbyterian Uni-
versity.

No sketch of Dr, Shearer's life would
be complete at all or meet with any ap-
proval from him—could his voice be
heard or his thought expressed—that did
not make mention of his beloved wife,
Lizzie Gessner, who was of foreign
birth. He married her in 1854, before
he finished his education. He loved and
cherished her with a devotion and a ten-
derness that was beautiful, touching and
exemplary beyond words. He always
said that under God ste was his inspi-
ration and his strength.

Mrs. Shearer died in January, 1903.
As a memorial to her Dr. Shearer re-
modelled or one may say rebuilt the
“Old Chapel,” now known on the Da-
vidson campus as the Shearer Biblical
Hall. He also edited “Prayer Meeting
Papers,” prepared by Mrs, Shearer, in-
tending the book which contains a sketch
of her life as a memory volume.

Mr. James W. Osborne,
Noted Alumnus, Dies
in New York.

Death Quite a Surprise to His
Family and Friends.

Davidson was saddened on Monday
last to learn of the death of one of its
best known alumni, Mr. James W, Os-
borne, '79, whose death occurred in
Sherman Square Hotel, New York,
Saturday night. Mr. Osborne was for-
mer Assistant District Attorney of New
York City, and a widely known crim-
inal lawyer. He was found dead in his
apartments in the hotel on Sunday
morning by his son, who had spent the
night with relatives, while Mrs. Os-
borne was visiting her father. The
cause of his death was given as angina
pectoris.

Mr. Osborne was sixty-one years old
and was born in Charlotte, N. C: He
came to New York when he was twen-
ty-five years old, and five years later
entered the District Attorney's office.
He served under different district at-
ttorneys for fourteen years, later enter-
ing private practice. He helped New
York prosecute Harry K. ‘Thaw.

While Assistant District Attorney,
Mr. Osborne gained fame by success-
fully prosecuting Albert T. Palmer, the
murderer of the aged millionaire, Wil-
liam Marsh Rice.

Particulars of his death have ‘not been
learned, but it is supposed that it came
suddenly, as his friends and relatives
had heard nothing of his illness. His
brother, who resides in Charlotte, left
immediately for New York. Funeral
services will be held taday.

lumbia regret that her marriage will
take her elsewhere to live.

lumbia, having graduated from the Co-
lumbia ‘Theological Seminary last spring
and since that time has been in charge
of a group of churches in Barnwell
county—Barnwell, Denmark, Bamberg

in Soochow, China, where his father has
for many years been a missionary of the
Presbyterian church. “The son expects
to go to the same field, leaving probably
early in 1920.— The Columbia Record.

The above announcement of the en-
gagement of Pierre DuBose, '14, will
be read with interest by every alumnus
who had the pleasure of being associated
with and knowing him while in college.
Mr. DuBose was very popular in col-
lege, both among the students and
among the faculty, and the best wishes
of all go with him as he leaves for his
new field of work.

ALUMNI PARAGRAPHS.
By Robert M. Miller, Ire

After the most faithful and efficient
work on the part of the “Staff,” it is
most gratifying to know that the ‘Da-
vidsoniap”™ is now on its feet-—good and

solid. Let us sce that it is again not
“crippled.”
¢ * *
Without attempting any invidious

comparison, much credit is due to Mr.
Carl Matthews, business manager, for
his earnest and energetic work and this
success is due largely to his persistent
and well directed efforts.

* * *

Hence, patrons of the College always
feel that their boys are ‘safe’ at Da-
vidsen.

The athletic friends of the College re-
gret the loss of Coach Fetzer, but all
feel that it has secured an able, loyal
and experienced successor in Major
Crayton, and that athletics has received
thereby a distinct forward move rather
than a backset.

Let’s Get Busy at Once on
Orchestra and Glee Club

Several Old Men Back; Fresh Class
Should Furnish Good Material.

Tt is customary cach year for David-.
son to put out a Glee Club and Orches-
tra, With ten or twelve of last year's
members back, prospects seem rather
bright for a good club. A lack of talent
and material last season made it impos-
sible to have an orchestra, but with the
help of any and all men in the new
freshman class, and also the return of
Freeman, who was out of college last
year, it is hoped that a splendid orches-
tra may be developed. All men who
play or attempt to play any kind of an
orchestral instrument are requested to be
on hand when the first practice is an-
nounced.

A Glee Club and Orchestra concert is
one of the main features of Junior and
Senior speaking, and every effort will be
made to gét up a program better than
anv of the past entertainments,

The club takes numerous trips in
North and South Carolina during the
fall and spring sessions of college, but
no club will be taken on these trips that
will not come up to the standard that
Davidson Glee Clubs have made in the
past. So every follower of the musical
world, either instrumental or vocal, will
be given a chance to show what is in
them some time in the near future.
