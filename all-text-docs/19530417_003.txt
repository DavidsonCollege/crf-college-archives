FRIDAY, APRIL 17, 1953

As this writer takes
over the position of the
editor of the sports
- page we feel it only fit-
ting and proper to con-
gratulate the retiring
editor, Dick Roper, on
a job well done. Dick
' brought Davidson
. Sports fans a fine cov-
erage of Wildoat sports
events, as well as many
extras and opinions of
interest to the reader.

We are well aware
. that because of the

length and nature of

this column that it is
not the most popular part of the page, but we will attempt
to bring you discussions and views which will point out to the
fan areas of the Wildcat sports life not contained in the news
stories. This is exactly what we feel has been done in the past
year by Dick and speaking on behalf of a lot of your readers
we would like to say—Thanks Dick.

SPRINGTIME IS FOR SPORTS

This is truly the sports season here at Davidson. With
four varsity sports in season and one other winter varsity
sports in their spring training periods the sports life on the
campus will reach its peak during the coming few weeks.

The phenomenal thing as far as the usual Wildcat sports
outlook is concerned is that three of the four teams now in
intercollegiate competition are sporting records of .500 or
better.

Coach “Pete” Whittle’s track team has a 2-1 record with
two decisive wins and another of those old Davidson moral
victories. “Pete’s” boys wallopped Roanoke and Mereer, but
Wednesday the field events gave them a fit as Clemson took
a heart breaker 66-65. The cinder pounders will hit what is
possibly the toughest competition they will meet this season
as they face loaded South Carolina both today and next Satur-
day. °

Out on the tennis courts the Cats are doing just as well.
The flashy netters have won 8 while losing only four. Coach
McKee’s charges will hit North Carolina’s defending Southern
Conference Champs next weekend in one of the toughest and
most looked-forward-to matches of the season. North Carolina
is favored again to take the Southern Conference Tournament
which gets under way on the local courts on the 14-15-16 of
May. Tennis fans are looking forward to the meeting of the
two teams because it just might be indicative of the May meet-
ing of the conference. With men like Del Silvia and Herb
Brown on the opposition the Cats will have their work cut out
for them.

FEATHERS WILL FLY SAY GOLFERS

The other winning team in the Wildcat “hope” chest is
Coach Elgin White’s Linkmen with a 5-5 record. Though
losing badly to South Carolina this week the Cats are really
gunning for the Gamecocks in their Tuesday meeting. All
the rest of their regular season matches this year will be
played on the Charlotte Country Club course.

The only dismal scene on the Cat horizon at present is
over on Coach Chuck Clements baseball diamond. In his first
year as head baseball coach here at Davidson the amiable Cle-
ments is working on a building program which should reap
some diamond victories for the Cats in future seasons. This
sounds like the same old “building season” excuse that so
many coaches hide behind when things don’t go as well as
they had hoped as far as winning goes. However, this time
it’s a fact. Just look at the lineup. Only three or four seniors
figure prominently with the regulars including pitchers.

THEY’RE INEXPERIENCED, BUT IMPROVING

At times the infield has been protected by three fresh-
men and only one senior and by other combinations including
two juniors. One of the freshmen, Buzzy Hope is one of the
teams leading hitters and all three excell in fielding ability.
In the outfield there are two juniors one of whom is Fred
Stowe, last season's leading hitter. On the pitching staff there
is only one steady senior, a junior, two sophomores, and three
freshmen who have shown promise. When they gain some
much needed experience and a little confidence—watch ‘em.

Yet another sport is laboring in spring practice sessions.
Coach Charlie Parker’s wrestlers worked out early in the
week (getting ready for Spring Frolies), but adjourned activ-
ities last Wednesday because of the dance weekend. Some
eight men are taking part in the spring drills as the Cat groan-
ers look forward to some wins on next year’s slate.

Phi Delts Become New
Volleyball Champions;
Lead In Tennis Tourney

By DON PILKENTON
The Phi Delta Theta Fraternity opened strong and fin-
ished the volleyball season going away with an 11-0 record.
The loss of the previously unbeaten SPEs to the Phi Delts
last Monday fairly well decided the championship. Thereupon,
the SPEs went on to lose one of their remaining two games and

wound up in third place behind the KAs.

The champion Phi Delt team was
built around Scott Reams, 1952 All-
Fraternity Volleyball player. Al-
though the Lynchburg Virginian
had no former experience in the
game before entering Davidson,
Scott’s natural abilities were
brought forth last year and have
continued to show themselves
throughout this 1953 season. Scott’s
role on the All-Fraternity Volley-
ball team is likely to re-occur this
year,

Nelson Captain

Captain Bill Nelson, a Robbins
N. C. Junior, who also served as
coach, aided the success of the
team in the careful placing of his
players to ensure a well-balanced
group, on both offense and de-
fense.

In offensive play, Nelson, Gene
Craven, and John Alexander were
the play-makers, while tall boys
Scott Reams, Buddy Brown, and
Tom Poindexter sent the ball over
the net.

The powers of the Phi Delt de-
fense who helped save many a
point were Dan Leach, George
Whisman, and Pete Ormsby.

Two Third Games

Evidence of the team’s sparkling
play may be seen in the fact that,
of the eleven contests they played,
during the season, in only two was
a third game required to determine
the winner, the Phi Delts having
won the first two games. The spirit
and confidence, built up through
the season by a continual stream
of victories, gave to the team an
added punch which proved them
champions in the tight spots.

Although the Phi Delts possessed
two or three stand-out players, the
ball fell also into the capable hands
of teammates who contributed no
small portion of the talent which
brought their team through a per-
fect season.

The one or two remaining volley-
ball games which were postponed
will not affect the standings of
the first three teams.

Baseballers Seek
Season's First Win
At Durham Tomorrow

By JIM HOLSHOUSER

Davidson’s Wildcats travel to
Duke tomorrow where they will
meet the current leaders of the
Southern Division of the Southern
Conference. The Cats, with a line-
up sprinkled with freshmen and
sophomores, are still seeking their
first win.

The Davidson nine played host
to the Blue Devils in the opening
contest of the season and came
out on the short end of an 11-2
score.

Smith Goes Monday

Johnny Smith, mainstay of the
Wildcat mound staff, will start the
game against the league-leaders.
Monday afternoon, Davidson will
play the McCrary Eagles, one of
the strongest semi-pro teams in
North Carolina. The pitching
chores will fall on Roger Little or
Jimmy Smith.

Following the game with Mc.
Crary, the team hits the road for
a series of Southern Conference
contests. They will meet North
Carolina, N. C. State, The Citadel,
and South Carolina on the trip.

Busy Week

In the past week’s competition,
the Cat nine met Furman, North
Carolina, and Clemson, with the
latter being. a double-header. Al-
though the team lost the two games
at Clemson, hopes for the future
were stirred by the out-standing
pitching performance of Johnny
Smith. Against the strong Tiger
club, which has lost only three
games, Smith struck out sixteen
men!

During this second game, sever-
al outfield flies were lost in the
sun, letting unearned runs cross
the plate for Clemson. The result
was a close 64 loss for the Cats.

The hitting of the team has been
poor in these last few games, with
only eleven runs being scored in
four contests. Arnold Whisnant,
Fred Stowe, and Buzz Hope have
been the leading hitters, with Jim
Teeter, who left the Furman game
with a badly twisted ankle, also
looking good at the plate.

weeks of scheduled play, the Phi
Delts are leading. However, their
8-0 record is being challenged by
the Kappa Sigs with a 40 record
and the Campus Club, with two
wins and no losses.

Due to postponed games between
the Phi Gams and the Campus
Club, Pi Kapps and Betas, Phi
Gams and SPEs, Campus Club and
ATOs, and the Kappa Sigs and
the Betas, this week’s tennis stand-
ings are incomplete.

Cats Meet Gamecocks Today

WILDCAT LINKSTERS
'TEE-OFF’ TUESDAY
WITH GAMECOCKS

Next Tuesday Coach Elgin
White’s red and black golfers will
meet a powerful South Carolina
Gamecock crew on the Charlotte
Country Club links. The Cats will
be out for revenge for the 20%
to 6% pounding they took at the
hands of the South Carolinians this
week.

With Graeme Keith back in the
Wildcat lineup after an excursion
to the Greenville Open the Link-
sters are out to turn the tables on
the Gamécocks. The match will be-
gin at the usual 9:30 a. m. in Char-
lotte.

Split Even

The day before the South Caro-
lina loss the Cats took the mea-
sure of the four man Furman out-
fit by a 1342 to 4% count. Joe
Jenkins and Larry Parrott led the
Cat win as they both shot 76s. Low

\man for Davidson in the Gamecock

match was captain Lew Barnes
who shot a 76.

The season record for the golf
team now stands at 5-5 with but
three matches left in the regular
season. The two matches left after
South Carolina Tuesday are with
Clemson on the 25th and Wofford
on the 27th.

On the 14-15-16 of May the Cat
golfers will travel to Winston-
Salem to take part in the Southern
Conference Tournament to wind
up the golf activity for this season.

Wildcat of the Week:

Johnny Smith Struck Out 16 Tigers;
Still Couldn't Shake Off Cat Jinx

Last Friday was just another in
a stream of dark days for Chuck
Clements’ still winless Wildcat base-
ball team, as they bowed 63 to
Clemson mm me second half of a
doubleheader. But for the guy la-
boring for Davidson on the mound
it was one of the biggest days of
his baseball career.

That afternoon saw an easy-
going, drawling Davidson junior
named Johnny Smith strike out
sixteen Clemson batters while giv-
ing up eight hits in the course of
the game. But, to his chagrin,
Johnny still lost the game as his

teammates were unable to bunch
enough of their cight hits in one
innings to eke out a victory.

Smith’s performance against
Clemson was all the more outstand-
ing since that school has one of
the most highly subsidized — and
therefore one of the best — teams
in the South. The Tigers report
14 freshmen on scholarship, and
a traveling squad of nearly 30
players.

Smith, from Lillington, North
Carolina, is strictly a one-sport man

Ctomson Loss Heart Breaker

The Cat cindermen lost a real
heart breaker last Wednesday after-
noon at Clemson as the Tigers
edged them out 66-65 in as excit-
ing a meet as is possible in the
cinder sport.

Clemson took first and third in
the 220 low hurdles to clinch their
victory. The Cat cindermen made
almost a complete sweep of the
running events while the Clemso-
nians did the same in the field
events.

The Tigers grabbed cight firsts
to the Cats seven; seven seconds
to the Cats eight; and seven thirds
to the Cats five. It was really nip
and tuck down to the 220 low
hurdles. The Cats undefeated mile
relay team took that final event
with a 3:32.1 time to pull the Cats
back to within one point.

Shipley, Henry Undefeated

Davidson’s two top contenders
remained in the ranks of the un-
beaten as Bill Shipley ran his best
time in the 440 yard dash with a
:51.2 and Captain Bob Henry again
took the 880 yard run with a 2:02.6
time.

competition by trouncing N. C.

Saturday afternoon the Wildcat
hetters will invade the land of the
Gamecocks to match racquets with
the University of South Carolina
team.

Cats Seak Revenge

The big test. however, will come
next week when the Cats again
tangle with a strong P.C. combo.
The Wildcats will be out for re-
venge, having suffered their worst
defeat (7-2) at the hands of the
Blue Hose.

The Wildcats have been steadily
improving over the course of the
season and present a threat to any
team which they tangle with on
the courts.

The P.C. netters are one of the
strongest teams the Wildcats will
meet this season, but if Johnny
Bremer’s sprained ankle has heal-
ed, Johnny and Lacy Keesler,
Davidson’s top men on the courts,
could very possibly lead the Wild-
cats to an upset victory.

Keesler Tops

Keesler has been the steadiest
of the Cat performers to date and
Coach McKee hopes to see his
sophomore ace go all the way in
the Southern Conference Tourna-
ment which gets under way on the
local courts on the 14th of next
month.

Bremer has been greatly ham-
pered by his weak ankle which he
sprained during the first of the
two Harvard matches. He saw limit-
ed action for over a week, but the
weak ankle is now back to its nor-
mal playing strength and he should
hit his regular No. 2-man game
agaihst the Gamecocks tomorrow.
