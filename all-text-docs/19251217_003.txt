| A wise man knows he is acting folish
if he falls in love this close to Christmas.

Fresh McQueen thinks N.-C. C. W. is
the name of a railroad, somebody please
tell him better—we haven't the heart.

Many a girl looks sweet on the outside
—so does a sugar coated pill.

A doctor in Charlotte was once asked
it he had ever made a mistake. He re-

| plied by saying he once cured a million-

aire in three visits.

Red McAlpine is being good until after

| Christmas as he wants Santa to be sure

to visit him. He has even quit*smoking
5 cent cigars until the first of the year.

A. H. Hollingsworth (at Trough) —
“Come here, butter, everybody knows you
are old enough to walk.”

“But if I kiss you this time, no one will
be the wis¢r.”

“Oh yes they will.”

“Who?”

“You will next time.

| madam?”

Customer—“How dare you tempt me to

“Is there an art is kissing?”
“The only are is, ‘art thou willing’?

No, Celia, a girl and a traffic cop are

' not alike, for a cop means STOP when

he says it.

“Tom go fetch the old horse.”

“Why the old one, father?”

“Wear out the old ones first,’ that’s my
motto.”

“Well, then, father, you fetch the

| horse.”

“Hello, central. Ish thish Informa-
tion?”
“Yes.”

“Well, I wish you would pleash tell me

TO CHRISTMAS
We will all now rise and sing verse 16
of the “Good Old Ship of Zion,” entitled,
“We'll all get drunk and happy when she
comes.”

WHY IS IT
That even though you won't get home
for the holidays until the 23rd or the

| 24th, that between the time the con-

ductor calls out your home town station
and the time for Santa to come you will
meet every flame that you ever made love
to; But worse than that, there will be
one of those ‘I'm expecting a gift from
you’. look in her eyes. I ask you again,
Why is it?

JANUARY 5TH
Gather your kisses while you may—
Time bring only sorrow.
You'll be having a date with your girl
today,

And answering, “present” tomorrow.

MORE TRUTH THAN BULL
Prof.— ‘Love is blind.’ Mr. Patterson,
what kind of love is that?”
Seedy—“That’s puppy love, sir.”

“Please! Just one more kiss before I
leave.”

“AL right, but you'll have to hurry,

Father will be home in about an hour.” |

“Is your Packard friend coming to-
night?”
“No, this is Willys-Knight.”

“What are you goingto get for Christ-
mas?”

“Have you ever seen a buckskin bill-
folder full of twenty dollar bills?”

“Yeah,”

“Well, 1 MAY get a folder.”

Dreamy music,

Chilly air,

Teasing cyes,

Wavy hair,

Just built for two;
Cherry lips;

What else could I do?
