Overdone ‘Anger Management’
only manages to anger moviegoers

299

“Anger Management’”’s teaming of the
great Jack Nicholson and the consistently
funny Adam Sandler should have made ideal
conditions for a great comedy, the type con-
stantly quoted by the public and imitated by
future filmmakers. Well, good news and bad
news. While the film includes some funny
moments, hilarious performances by actors
John Turturro and Woody Harrelson, and
some great cameos (by basketball coach
Bobby Knight among others), this over the
top screwball comedy becomes inconsistent
and annoying.

Dave Buznik (Sandler) has always been
pushed around and demeaned by others, and
his self-esteem has suffered the consequences.
Whether confronted by the neighborhood
bully as a child (in one of the funniest scenes
of the film) or his demanding boss, Dave
Buznik never fought back ... until now. While
on a plane to St. Louis, Buznik’s innocent
attempts to get the attention of the flight
attendant spiral out of control, landing him in
court and in anger management classes run
by Dr. Buddy Rydell (Nicholson). However,
Buddy’s abnormal techniques fuel Dave’s
anger rather than curing it. This premise
could have produced a classic, but the result
is a disappointment.

While the performances of Sandler and
Nicholson are as good as the material allows,
the supporting cast steals the film. Attending
his first session of anger management classes
with Dr. Buddy Rydell, Dave meets and odd
assortment of characters including Chuck,
played by John Turturro. Turturro’s perfor-
mance as the confrontational madman witha
heart is, in a word, hysterical. Any word or
movement can propel Chuck into fits of rage.
As the movie progresses, the audience waits
to see what will set Chuck off next and the
comedy that results. But for a movie that
includes the skillful Sandler and Nicholson
and the incredible performance of Turturro,
“Anger Management” becomes too outra-
geous and suffers as a result.

With one moment of over the top comedy
seemingly trying to exceed the last, “Anger

Management” attempts to resolve the con-
flicts established during the film in a senti-
mental ending. The ending tries to justify Dr.
Buddy Rydell’s antics and the destruction of
Dave Buznik’s once calm lifestyle, an ending
that annoyed and arigered this reviewer. While
“Anger Management” offers a poor chance

-for the teaming of star Adam Sandler and
legend Jack Nicholson, this first pairing will
hopefully not be their last.

Joseph Francis and the rest of his “Girls
Gone Wild” crew kicked off their “Smart
Girls Gone Wild” college tour at Davidson
College this weekend. Many Spring Frolickers
were shocked to discover Francis & Co. lug-
ging around camera equipment and snagging
video clips of Davidson girls acting as they
never before have. “Ohmigosh!” says one
female student, “It’s, like, so crazy that this is
happening! I’ve, like, never done anything
like this before! I can’t believe that I let them
see my swimsuit top! I’m so wild!”

The “Girls Gone Wild!” crew was flanked
by yet another celebrity. Jason Biggs, the
“American Pie” actor who achieved fame
through quite embarrassing antics, joined the
“Girls Gone Wild!” bus tour. “I think that
‘Ivy League’ students are under represented
in the college party scene. Even though
[Davidson girls] are smart doesn’t mean that
they can’t flash a video camera and squeal.”
Biggs was spotted squatting near the cotton
candy booth during most of the afternoon.

Francis admitted to enjoying Spring Frol-
ics, “I think that this is a good location to start
our new college tour. This is a great mix of
innocence and naughtiness. It puts a nice spin
on my videos.” Francis spent most of his day
near a plastic pool filled with questionable-
looking water, “I mean, why aren’ t these girls
having a chicken fight or something? Does

; invade campus

anyone want to have a wet-T-shirt contest or
anything?” : :

Most video clips were taken near the carni-
val area where cameramen instigated a cam-
pus-wide mud fight. One of the cameras was
ruined when a beginner cameraman attempted
to videotape students while hopping around
on the cowboy moon bounce: Another cam-
eraman, accompanied by a handful of stu-
dents, was found inside of a fraternity refrig-
erator, “Dude. This is some crazy [stuff],
man.”

Some Davidson students, however, were
disoriented and angered by the voyeuristic
presence. “It’s just plain tacky,” states a
Davidson junior, “Davidson has an image to
maintain and [Francis & Co.] are exploiting
our cherubic nature as well as the girls that
they’ ve captured on video. It’s just an asshole
thing to do. This is a Presbyterian institution,
we really should uphold those foundations.”
Campus officials declined to comment.

Girls who participated in Francis’ video
clips received a polyester-cotton blend tank
top that yielded the’ “Girls Gone Wild!” logo.
Francis told Davidsonian reporters that this
T-shirt quality was better than those that he
gives to “Girls Gone Wild!” spring breakers.

Francis and his team left the Davidson
College campus early Sunday morning.
