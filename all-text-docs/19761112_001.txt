WITHOUT A vice-president in
charge of finances, the college
budget is now controlled primarily

by President Spencer.

President heads hierarchy
controlling purse strings

By AMANDA HALL
Sports Editor

A hierarchy of administra-
tive offices controls the budget
of Davidson College. Heading
those who direct the money
flow is the Office of: the
President. This system oper-
ates in a method contrary to
the Self-Study Report of 1974.

Although different adminis-
trators and the Advisory
Council for Finance, Personnel
and Development, composed
of six faculty members and
three students advise Spencer,
“the vote on the budget, in all
bluntness, is the President,’
according to Academic Vice-
President, Frontis Johnston.

According to the Davidson
College Self-Study Report for
the Southern Association of
Colleges and Schools, in Octo-
ber, 1974, the Adademic Vice

Senate cements procedure
outlining board selection

By LYMAN COLLINS
Asst. News Editor

This week the SGA Senate
adopted its procedure for sel-
ecting student representatives
for the media board.

A committee, co-chaired by
sophomores. Percy Badham
and Hans Watford, presented
their proposals to the Senate
last week.

The Media Board, ‘to be
composed of students, faculty,
administrators, and members
of the college community, will
oversee all student media,
including The Davidsonian,
Quips and Cranks, The Mis-
cellany, The Wildcat Hand-
book, and WDAV.

The SGA will have at least
three representatives chosen
by the Senate on the board.

Representatives from the
media will select one student
member to be the media
representative. The other two
will be chosen by the Senate
from a list of eight names that
have gone through a screening
process.

The SGA President will
appoint a five-member screen-
ing committee, one member of
which will be an editor-in-
chief, or the equivalent. This
committee will solicit nom-
inations from the media, the

, administration, and the stu-
dent body for students to
serve on the Media Board.

From this pool of names the
committee will select eight to
be presented to the Senate,

lication with this issue for the

which will then select two.
“This screening committee
will be the real workhorse of
this whole operation,’’ com-
mented Co-chairman Watford.
Under normal conditions
two representatives from each
medium, including each edit-
or-in-chief or the equivalent,
shall meet to select the media
representative on the board.
No editor-in-chief or the
equivalent, will be allowed to
serve on the Media Board
because of possible conflict of
interest. If a media board
member should be elected he

would be required to give up
his seat on the board.

For the first Media Board,
however, Matthew Covington,
editor of The Davidsonian,
will be the media representa-
tive.

“This first Media Board will
be exceedingly important in
that it will set up the Media
Board By-Laws,’’ explained
Watford. ‘‘The Davidsonian
will probably be the publica-
tion. most. effected by the
board, and it was felt that

Zoning ordinance
amended, passed

By DAVE KELLER
“Executive Editor

Davidson’s Town Council
has officially adopted an am-
ended version of the zoning
code outlined in the October 22
issue of The Davidsonian.

The code, drawn up by a
separate planning commis-
sion, divides the town into
residential, industrial, and
commercial segments.

Of the amendments inclu-
ded in the final draft, two
pertained directly to the col-
lege. The first states that
college residence halls must be
within 200 feet of College A
land (college-owned land con-
taining administration build-
ings, classrooms, and faculty
living quarters); the other
rules that buildings on College
B land (campus areas with
housing and operational struc-
tures) cannot be closer than
100 feet from the nearest

adjoining property line.

Another amendment states
that mobile homes can only be
on R-7 land,.property which
exists in theory but not on the
map. According to Dr. Anna-
marie Burts, planning com-
mission member, ‘For all
practical purposes, mobile
homes are out in Davidson.”
She cited the upkeep required
by mobile homes as the main
reason for this ordinance.

Other amendments to the
code include one which per-
mits apartments above busi-
ness establishments and ano-
ther which requires parks and
other such recreational facili-
ties and buildings to have a
special-use permit.

Copies of the code plus an
attached sheet of amendments
are available in E.H. Little
Library, the Public Library,
and Town Hall. An edition of
the code as amended and
passed will be available soon,
according to Burts.

President and the VPFD (Vice
President for Finance and
Development) control the ac-
tual formulation of the budget
to be presented to the Presi-
dent, thus serving as a bridge
between the rest of the College
personnel and the President.

Davidson no longer has a
VPFD; there is no one in
charge of finance. The Collegé
has only a Vice-President for
Development.

The four officers of finance
formerly directly under the
VPFD, the Comptroller, Busi-
ness Manager, Director of the
Physical Plant, and Director
of Personnel and Administra-
tive Services now report di-
rectly to the President.

“The Southern Associ-
ation Report, the committee
that was here, recommended
someone to head up these four
offices,’’ said Johnston. ‘‘Dr.
Spencer does not want to
bring one:in—it would be hard
to pick one of these four, and
Dr. Spencer does not feel it is
necessary to bring in someone
from the outside.”’

Under the’ present system
the four finance officers are
“‘also active in thecbudget
making process,’’ accroding to
Johnsten.

The Academic Vice Presi-
dent controls the finances for
faculty salaries, departmental
budgets, the library, the regis-
trar’s office, the athletic de-
partment, the laboratories,
audio-visuals, and other budg-
ets,

‘‘Most of these make up
tentative budgets and send
them through me,” said John-
ston.

UNDER THE new zoning code,

Although the Academic
Vice President is theoretically
responsible for the Dean of
Students and Admissions of-
fices, these report directly to
the President, according to
Johnston.

“Departmental budgets are
not generally large,’’ said
Johnston, but the budget is
determined by the needs of the
department. Science budgets
include finances for laborator-
ies, and so are considerably
larger than others.

The budget has remained
relatively constant in the last
several years; only the appro-
priation for the library and
faculty salaries have been
raised to any degree, accord-
ing to Johnston.

‘“‘We do not ever do the
salaries until the rest of the
budget is set,’’ he said. Sal-
aries have been raised about
six percent each year in the
past two years, but “this was
not an _ across-the-board
thing,” he said.

Budget formulation invol-
ves an eight-step process ac-
cording to the Self-Study Re-
port.

Forms showing the previous
year’s expenditure and the
current year’s budget are pre-
pared by the Comptroller and
given.to the Academic Vice
President and the four finance
officers. These administrators
review the statements and
distribute them to the de-
partmental chairmen.

The chairmen take budget
requests, after being given a
maximum expansion factor.
