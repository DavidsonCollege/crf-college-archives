Escort Service Contributes To Campus Safety And Security

By Laura Blair

As many of you may have no-
ticed while walking to the bath-
room, or any other public place on
campus, Davidson’s Public Safety
Department offers an escort serv-
ice so students “don’t walk alone.”
Since the beginning of the year, the
service has averaged 240 rides a
month for female students. Assis-
tant Director of Public Safety Rick
Moore could only recall one time
that a male desired the service.
However he was in the company of
two other females.

This is the first school year the
escort service has been frequently
uulized. Although the service has
been offered in the past, 1990 was
the first year it was publicized.

Moore explained that the basic
purpose of the program is to offer
females an escort by a Public Safety

officer, so they will not be atrisk of —

being attacked while walking alone
at night. Both Moore and Director
of Public Safety Ray Thrower
stressed that the service was de-
signed with females in mind.

To research this article, I en-
gaged an escort for a ride from the
computer center to my dorm. The
ride went off without a hitch.
(However, the officer was not

thrilled to discover he was on

Candid Camera.) Atthe time of my
call, the officer on duty, Officer
Davis, was on another escort call,
yet it took less than five minutes
for him to arrive.

The conditions inside the Cush-
man are certainly not spacious by
any means, but I can honestly say
that it was warmer and safer than
walking by myself. (My camera-
man, Chris Lee, was waiting for us
at the dorm.)

As Matt Wanzenberg men-

tioned in last week’s paper, one
“bummer” of living off-campus is
the temptation for off-campus stu-
dents to drive home after drinking
at Patterson Court parties.

Moore and Thrower both said
taking drunk students to off-cam-
pus housing is not part of the escort
policy. They felt the responsibility
should rest in the hands of the
student and the party’s sober
monitor.

On the other hand, if you find
yourself drunkenly wandering
around campus, Public Safety will
find a way for you to get home. As
Officer Davis said, “I wouldn’t
take a drunk student to Bacon and
Eggs, but if I can, I will take them
home.”

So all you females, the next
time you are getting ready to leave
alone, and the night looks dark and
scary, call your fearless escort

Edward Scissorhand Fails To
Grasp Fairy-Tale Imagery

By Johnathon Harris

Edward Scissorhand
Directed by Timothy Burton
Paramount Pictures

The movie takes place in a
suburban setting, full of — with
brightly colored square houses,
light posts and giant hedges. On
the edge of this paradise looms
something horrifying, a shadowed

actual hands could be attached.
Unfortunately for Edward the sci-
entist died leaving only the conso-
lation of hedge sculpting and ice
carving for hisluckless experiment.
Edward’s isolated life changes
forever when the Avon lady comes
to the castle soliciting eye-makeup
and ends up gaining a new family
member.

The best scene of the movie
comes after Edward has been in

hill, an ancient caste atop a shad- ©

owed hill.

“Grandma, why does it
snow?,” quips a young grandchild
lying in her bed neath layers of
blanketry. “Well, I suppose it all
started with scissors,” opines: the
grandmother, and the story begins.
Suddenly we are transported back
through the grandmother’sremem-
brances to a square of suburbiana
where the story spins out. These
first few scenes are meant to give
the movie a fairy-tale feel, a fan-

tastic foo la la, an aura of things .

past--but the movie comes up short
on its promise, and by the end,
there has been so much crude mod-
ernity ranging froma middleaged
woman’s attempt to have sex with
the most magical character in the
movie to actual violence, that any
fairy-tale pretense is lost.

Edward is the name of an un-
fortunate experiment, created to
look, actand feellikeaman. The
whole reason for calling Edward
Edward Scissorhands is the fault
of the man who created him. The
final features needed to make
Edward a complete replica of a
man were human hands, for which
the kindly scientist had substituted
two pairs of shiny scissors until

intention within. This sequence is

utterly fantastic and makes the

movie worth seeing, but from here
on the message is unclear, Edward
is driven up into his castle on the
hill where he gives into frustration
and uses those scissorhands for
what people always thought he was
using them for anyway: violence.
The end of the movie attempts to
bring happiness back to the filmic
experience with a synthesized

turned every hedge into a Disney
playtime pal, every dog into a
mincing muffy muttand every head
of hair in town into a tickertape
bouffant parade. The movie’ spoint
and the three dollar climax loom
close. Edward dives in front of a
truck to save a boy and because he

open and shut over the boys body
trying to see if he is all right. He
accidentally cuts the boy and
people start to mob around.
Eventually Edward is forced
to run, his heroic action misunder-
stood. This is the movie’s strong-
est moment, when the viewer
empathizes with Edward’s inabil-
ity to communicate his intentions
to others who can see only his
abnormality. This idea is easily
applicable to ourselves, trapped in
Situations where others judge us
without the benefit of knowing the

replay of choral melodies and a
return to the grandmother and her
love to dance in the snow. But, no
number of synthesizers can over-
turn the fact that Edward is now
high separated from love and un-
able to regain it--left high in a
castle to cut ice instead. Separa-
tion 1s not a solution to communi-

cation problems. At least I could -

say but it’s a beautiful story any-
way except that it’s impossible
given the number of non-beautiful
incidents that occur.

It could have been an almost
mythical story, but director Timo-
thy Burton throws in so many dis-
crepantly modern touches and
violence that the movie becomes a
vacuous feel-good gourd. Go see
this movie for a dollar, it has fun
moments and ideas, but the blank
empathy we feel for Edward and
real life social problems depicted
is worthless.

And for all of you off-campus-
ers, don’ tdrive drunk. Ray Thrower
said if they catch you, you will be
arrested, which in my opinion

would make having your car towed
look like a day in the park. Do the
best you can to find your own ride,
but when all else fails, call an es-

First of all, let me promise you
that re-acclimating yourself to
American life is not the culture
shock you might imagine it to be,
especially if you’ve been in Lon-
don for a semester. Let’s face it,
Ihaven’t been rummaging around
in South American jungles for
four months. The Americans’
cultural heritage is one that the
British had no small part in start-
ing, so things ina general sense
really aren’t that different. There
are little things, though, that I
missed while in London.

everything. McDonald’s ‘is: the
definite exception to this. Lon-

Some things the British do are:
definitely better than our feeble

TV Ads. British ad-ver-tis-

American counterparts. Since
I’ve gotten back I’ ve noticed that
American ads try tomake me feel
good about stuff like wallpaper
and car insurance. British ads
generally did a good job of mak-

Decent sports sections. I don’t
care how much you love cricket,
itisa damn boring game to watch
and even worse to read about.
Rugby runs along the same lines,
although it is definitely an excit-

about star rugbyers when you
don’t know who they are. Some-
times I just like to turn my brain
off and. read about basketball and
stuff.
