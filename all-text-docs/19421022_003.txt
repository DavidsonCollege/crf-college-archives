Game Jottings
lerably more to the game in Atlanta Sat
urday: from the abe cee point of view than was evidenced
in the One-Sided newspaper writeups of the game, in spite of the
impressive number of points amassed by the Engineers. It is
tu pass when the home state papers fail to give
credit toa team that fights like the Wildeats did in that game.
Atlanta papers and the citizens of that city were
generous in their praise of the ’Cats. Papers of neigh-
boring cities have been equally generous in the past,
but Davidsonians were downright disgusted when
North Carolina papers, possibly tired of using the term
“fighting Wildcats”. omitted any reference to such
spirit at a time when, of all times, it was most appro-
priate. Davidson was up against one of the foremost
teams of the nation, but the spirit was there (more
than has kgen seen before this season), and the ’Cats
fought them on almost even terms for the first half
before yielding to the insurmountable odds. The Wild-
cat spirit is not dead, in spite of the fact that our neigh-
boring sports scribes no longer see fit to mention it.

Vhere was consis

a sad come

Pech was indeed an impressive opponent as their 40-man
squad, attired in newly adopted blue,and white, uniforms, took
the field. They didn’t look too big but they were in superb
condition and fast as the proverbial “greased lightning”. They
were much like Carolina teams of the recent past. Long famed
jor their razZle-dazzle and speed, the Engineers definitely have
it again this year. They are certainly one of the best teams in
the country, and will be hard to stop. Prokop was the big gun
the Yellow Jackets’ backfield, while Eldridge came in for
a good share “of the honors. Clint Castleberry, the freshman
fireball, was stopped cold by the charging Wildcat forwards.
But back to that Davidson spirit, which was so

much in evidence. Wildcat tackling was the most

vicious seen so far this year, their blocking was good

at times, and the passing attack which clicked through-

out the first half, was a constant menace. All this

resulted from a determination to play good ball. The

possibilities have been there all along.

Sideline Comments

\ sizeable crowd of 11,000 Gwhich is large

for a Davidson
Was a representa

tive cross-section of the student body to cheer the ‘Cats on...
\ noble gesture of sportsmanship was offered when the Tech
cheerleaders led the Davidson rooters in a Wildeat yell. “O

Davidson” was expertly rendere: Tby the Yellow Jacket band...

Former Davidsonians seen at the game were “Rosy” Boykin,
I.t. Ned Pollock, Vernon Youngblood, 1G pres Allcott, and Joe
Nelson... It was hot as blazes, and that factor was important
in wearing down the undermanned ‘Cats. Numerous minor

injuries also plagued the team throughout the game
Incidentally Coach Melver plans to shitt “Ripper” Hunt to the
center position after he played in that spot against the Techs
when both regular centers were’injured ... With-a full extra
week to rest up the whole squad should be back in-good shape
for the V.M.I. game én the 31st.

Frosh Yield :

The freshmen played typical Davidson football in
their game with Carolina last week. They scrapped
their larger opponents every foot of the way, held them
throughout the first half, and came very close to
scoring themselves, It was not until the second half
that the superior manpower of the Carolina yearlings
wore them down. The Kittens showed a greatly im-
proved unity in their play, and should exhibit further
improvement as they learn through the hard school of
experience. McArn, Parrish and Walker were stand-
outs in the line, while Paylor and Fletcher led the
way in the backfield. It is feared that Buck Troutman,
sensational broken field runner, will be lost to the team
for the remainder of the season due to avback injury.

Odds and Ends
Plans for a full Winter sports schedule are going ahead,
but these plans are at best very indefinite. Main headache
the moment the lack coach for the wrestling team,
with workouts scheduled to start soon and several stiff matches
already scheduled» Tf no coach is obtained the matches may
have to be cancelled, but it is hoped that they will be able to
get along with student. coaching the team has
always done.
Transportation _is_another big question mark.

If nation-wide rationing of these facilities comes, all
inter-collegiate contests may have to be cancelled.
Particularly with respect to basketball, Davidsonians
are hoping that this will not happen. Prospects in that
sport are the brightest in several years. With most of
last year’s squad returning and a wealth of sophomore
material joining-the varsity, the possibility of Davidson
gaining a berth in the Southern Conference Tourna-
ment develops into a probability.
