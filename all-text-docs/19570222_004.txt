FLIGHT TO FREEDOM

Tears Of Joy Complete
Family’s Long Journey

By ISTVAN HOCSAK

AS TOLD TO LAURENS WALKER
(Last of a Series)

With the Russian return to

Budapest came an order from

the government to return to work. We went back, but only
to begin a “sit down” strike which was to last for weeks.

Before the Revolution. I had
worked. from time to time. in a)
smali town only seven miles from
the border. I decided that a “busi-
ness trip” to the factory in that
town would pive me an excellent
opportunity to check the possibili-
ties for an eseape across the bor-
der into Austria.

I left on a Monday for the small
city, taking some twelve helpers
with me. My boss was overjoyed
because he thought that at last
we were going to begin to work.

I returned Friday. convinced
that, though dangerous. escape
was possible. In the meantime.
I had stolen a rubber stamp from
my factory. This was to become
the key to my flight to freedom.

I began to forge documents and
papers which we needed in secur
ing train tickets and permits for
the trip to the border town. Each
of them was authenticated with
the rubber stamp of the factory.

TRAIN JOURNEY

The train trip to the border
town was successfully completed
despite passing through several
Russian check points. . .
-After leaving the train. we got
out of the town as quickly as
possible and began to walk paral-
lel to the border until we arrived
at a small farming village. It was|
dark, and it was impossible to
tell friend from enemy.

Finally, we were able to find
a boy who was going to serve
as a guide for a group ready to
make a dash for the border. He
took us to the house where the
group -had assembled.

As this was a large group, my
family and friends decided to
wait until after they had tried be-:
fore we made our break. We later
heard that this whole group had
blundered into a Russian ‘check-
point near the border and been
wiped out.

By 11:30 the clouds had covered
the moon and we decided that it
was time to begin the seven mile
walk. The weather was cold, I al-
most froze despite the fact that
I was wearing nearly every piece
of clothing that I owned. I carried
Stevie most. of the way. praying
that he wouldn’t wake up and ery
or call out. Any noise could have
been’ fatal.

FIVE HOUR WALK

We walked for five hours, every
step through mud. Of particular’
difficulty were the seemingly end-

less freshly plowed fields that we de

had to cross. Every step seemed
to be more and more hard to take.

Just after five o'clock we
stepped across the border into
Austria and, eventually,
life.

The Oresteia’ To
Be Shown Friday

We were happy beyond

produced at Randolph-Macon
Woman’s College by Capitat Film
Laboratories, Inc.

This is a significant cultural in-
novation in that this 2,400 year
old classic has been produced in
a modern medium with colorful
costuming and modern dancing.
All the music of “The Oresteia”
is original, although the chants
follow the standard four Greek
modes.

words, and yet not a few tears
were shed because each of us
realized that probably we had
seen our native country for the
last time.

This is the story of a Revolution
and of one family in flight to free-
dom and a new world. I write
this in hopes that in this small
way I can do my part to preserve
the memory of those heroes who
gave their lives for Hungary and
for freedom. I know that God was
with me and my family during
the Revolt and our escape and I
only pray that he will also be with
the people of Hungary as they
continue their struggle against
Communist oppression.

endeavor.

STUDENT STATEMENTS

Gordon Bondurant, President of
the YMCA:

Davidson is losing a man whose
vision has been of immeasurable
value to the school. His patience
and strong devotion to God and
his dedication to Davidson College
have been an inspiration to every-
one of us.

Bunny Perkinson, President of
the Senior Class and President of
the Interfraternity Council:

I was both surprised and sad-
dened to fearn of Dr. Cunning-
ham's resignation. Beyond doubt
the service he has rendered the
College during his tenure in of-
fice has been most outstanding. I
know the College will miss him
and wish him the best success in
anv future undertaking.

Dan LaFar, President of the
Student Body:

Dr. Cunningham has given the
student's welfare utmost

To Speak in Vespers

The Reverend James C. Hughes,
pastor of the. Home Moravian
Church in Winston-Salem, will
speak at the Vespers service Sun-
day night.

Rev. Hughes graduated from
Moravian College and Seminary in
Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and
came to Winston-Salem as associ-
ate pastor in 1947. He became
pastor in 1954.

The Home Moravian Church
was founded in 1771 by settlers
from Europe who came to the
Piedmont section to found a new
community. The annual Easter
service has gained world-wide
recognition for the church which
now has over 2,000 members.

Next month Rev. Hughes will
be guest speaker on “Church of

the Air” presented by the Colum-
bia Broadcasting System.

Trustees Consider
Ten-Year Expansion

The Board of Trustees, during
their Wednesday meeting,
listened, to a plan for ten years
of progress at Davidson.

Though overshadowed by the
resignation of President Cunning-
ham, actions were taken by the
Board which both affect the fu-
ture of the College and mark its
progress to date.

The most important matter dis-
cussed was the Ten Year Expan-
sion Program. This recommended
program, including such items as
the construction of seven major
buildings and increased faculty
committee for further study be-
fore being presented to the Board
for possible final adoption in May.

Members of the Board pointed
out the plan’s flexibility and far-
sightedness. They generally agreed
that the planners had done an ex-
cellent job in plotting the future
of the College. ‘

In connection with the Cunning-
1am resignation, a committee was
appointed to find some way of ex-

pressing the College's apprecia-..

tion to Dr. Cunningham for his
service.

The proposed fraternity court
was discussed at length, but no

| definite action was taken.

Dr. Cunningham announced to
the Board the successful com-
pletion of an 18 month drive to
increase the College's financial re-
sources by $1,500,000.

Dr. Cunningham also presented
his regular report as President of
the College.

Players Stress Comic
Elements In ‘Henry IV’

By JIM KUIST
On Tuesday evening, Players Inc. presented the first
part of Shakespeare’s Henry IV to a quiet audience in Cham-

ers Auditorium. The student

body had anticipated the per-

formance with an unusual whisper of enthusiasm, “no doubt

remembering the play from an English course.
It was rather evident that the| promoting the strong comic ele-

IV primarily for its comic oppor-
tunities. Perhaps this was their
motive for inverting the order of
the opening scenes. The prodi-
gious Falistaff thus opened the
evening, and his prominence in the
succeeding scenes underlined the
emphasis of the director.
Shakespeare began with an in-
terview at court in which King
Henry rejoiced over the current

opposition. His speeches also estab-
lished his frustration by Prince
Hal's frivolity and his anger at
Hotspur’s apparent defiance. In
this way, Shakespeare constructed
the historical setting, and he de-
veloped the elements of his drama
in the next two scenes, in revelry
around Falstaff and in Hotspur’s
heated interview with the King.

By disobeying this ‘arrangement,
the Players also destroyed Shake-
speare’s co-ordination of the plot.
They were committed to an ex-
ploitation of Falstaff's personali-
ty. He became their central char-
acter. Hal's development was ob-
scure. The entire cast played to
Falstaff. For example, when King
Henry left the scene in which he
proposed conditions of war to
Worcester, he returned Falstaff's
funny salute with a smile of sym-
pathetic amusement. Shakespeare
did not plan this recognition..

44 Scholarship Finalists
Invited For Consideration

The Davidson College Scholar-
ship Committee this week an-
nounced the finalists in the com-
petition for atl major scholarships
at the college.

The 44 finalists. who were se-
lected on the basis of results in
their College Board Examinations,
their demonstrate? leadership
ability, character, personality, and
interest in extra-curricular activi-
ties, constitute the largest number
of high school and preparatory
school seniors ever to be invited
to the Davidson campus for final
scholarship selection.

The finalists are divided into
two groups which have been in-
vited to Davidson next week. The
‘first group is composed of 23 con-
testants from North Carolina and
South Carolina and wil! be on the
campus February 27—March 1.
These are: Frank Ballance, Win-
ston-Salem; John Baxley, Blacks-
ville, S. C.; Andy Blake, Anderson,
S. C.; and Charles Cornwell, Lat-
timore.

but it was the most clumsy and
disappointing section of the play.

The Players had abbreviated
and reconstructed the fighting
sequence as much as possible, but
the short battle between Hotspur
and Hal was unavoidable, and it
was embarrassing. When Hal
thrust his sword through his fierce
opponent, the audience chuckled.
The Players had employed mood
music during the play with suc-

poor selection to enhance this
combat.

What a MATHEMATICIAN
can do at IBM

Mothematics is an ancient but ever-advancing science that contains many
forms. #1 shouldn’t surprise you then that it took some time before John
Jackson discovered the one brand of mathematics that seemed custom-
tailored to his ability and temperament. John is an Applied Science Repre-
sentative, working out of the IBM office at 122 East 42nd Street, N. Y. C.

does a fellow like John Jackson do
all day? In his own words, “I keep
in touch with the executives of many
different companies—advising them
on the use of their IBM electronic
data processing computers. I person-
ally consult with these customers,
and analyze their scientific and tech-
nical problems for solution by IBM.
Occasionally, I’m asked to write
papers, and give talks and demon-
strations on electronic computing.
All in all, it’s pretty fascinating . . .
something new pops up every day.”
In other words, John is a full-fledged
computing expert, a consultant .. .
and a very important person in this

P
a

coming age of automation through
electronics.

Since the IBM laboratories are
always devising easier and faster waya
to solve the problems of science, gov-
ernment, and industry, an Applied
Science Representative can never say
he’s learned his job and that's the
end of it. At least once every two
months, he attends seminars to be
updated on the latest developments in
engineering and operations research.

introduces new methods

During the two years that John
has spent with IBM in Applied Sci-
ence, he has guided innumerable IBM
customers to new and better ways of
doing things electronically. For ex-
ample: about 9 year ago, a leading
aircraft manufacturer wanted to ex-
periment with a radically different
design for a nuclear reactor. Although
the basic format had been established,
the project still required many months
of toil with mathematical equations.

Calling on o customer

The aircraft people decided that they
couldn’t afford to wait that long, so
they called in IBM. After discussion
with top executives, John helped to
map out a computer program that
saved the organization over 100 days

metic. Later, for this same company,
Jobn organized the establishment of
computer systems for aircraft per-
formance predictions . . . for data
reduction of wind tunnel testa... and
for wing streas analysis. At the same
time, he worked with this company’s
own employees, training them in the
use of IBM equipment. John still '
drops around to see that everything
is running smoothly.

Another service that John performs
is the constant reappraisal of each
customer’s IBM operation. Occasion-
ally, a customer may tie himself in
knots over a procedural “stickler.””
Periodically, in fact, John brings
IBM customers together . . . just to
talk over what's happening in each
other’s business—how everybody else
handled that old bugaboo in any
industry ... details.

New field for Mathematicians

John is exercising his mathematical
know-how in a field that was prac-
tically unheard of ten years ago. Even
now, this kind of work may be news
to you. It was to John Jackson a few
years back when he was an under-
graduate at the University of Colo-
rado. At that time, he waa considering
actuarial work or mathematical re-
search. But John liked the excitement
and diversification of science and in-
dustry and he wanted to use his

mathematical background in both of
those areas. It was not until he was
interviewed by IBM that field com-
puting whetted his scientific appetite.
A few montha later, John launched
his own IBM career as an Applied
Science trainee.

Promotionwise, John has come a
long way since that time. He’s now
an Applied Science Representative in

one of the busiest, most responsible
offices in the IBM organization ...
mid-town Manhattan.

With his wife, Katherine, and

daughter. Lisa, 20 months, and John,

knows a few vital statistics about
IBM ... such as the fact that the
Applied Science Division has quad-
rupied during the past three years,
and that in 1956 alone, over 70 pro-
motions were conferred. If ever a
future held promise, here is one.
