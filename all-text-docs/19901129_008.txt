Residew Plays (And Talks) To You

By ANDY HACKETT

AsI walked to the Kappa Alpha
house to interview Davidson’sown
Residew (evidently derived from
their old moniker, Mountain Dew),
I could make out the notes of the
“Barney Miller” theme song, cer-
tainly one of television’s funkier
tunes, played with the wit of an
Abe Vigoda wisecrack. I thought,
“Who are these guys...slapstick

goofballs or neurotic geniuses?” It”

turns out that they are neither-
simply, the dudes in Residew area
group of musicians who are driv-
ing the magic bus of classic rock
and ask you to hop a ride.

Guitarist vocalist Tom
Edmunds, °90, explained the
group’s beginnings. “We got to-
gether last year, around Christmas.
We played twice at SAE and at
Clemson. This year we came back
and everybody was pretty serious
about it. Two guys from Hit At-
tractions (aCharlotte management
agency) saw us and were im-
pressed; now, they get us gigs all
over, but they get acul.”

Brad Reddick, ’92, owner of
the town’sonly psychedelic pickup
(as if there might be more than
one), handles most of the vocal and
lead guitar work. He and Tom
comprise the band’s harmonious
dual-guitar sound, reminiscient of
the legendary Duane Allman/
Dickey Betts duo in the Allman
Brothers Band.

“We play all classic rock cov-
ers,” Brad stated, “but we have
some original songs on the way.”

“‘We change up songs,” added
Joe Binns, 791, drummer and
Davidsonian music columnist. “It’s
great to play covers, but if we
played them exactly as they were
written, you might as well stay
home and listen to the radio.”

“Exactly,” affirmed Tom.
“When youchange it up, you getto
put yourself into it, and we defi-
nitely have a certain style.”

When asked about big influ-
ences, bassist Chip Petree, ’93,
responded, “‘my biggest influence
would be Geddy Lee from Rush
and Mike Mills from REM. I’m
starting to be influenced by Fleaof
the Red Hot Chili Peppers, but that
doesn’t show itself in the music we

play.”

“I’m influenced by the Mis-

sissippi Delta bluesmen,” claimed
keyboardist Will Percy, ’92, “like
B.B. King.” “I don’t really have
one influence,” said Brad. “When
you listen to any kind of music, it
influences you in some way.”
“Brad has been an influence
for me,” said Tom. “He’s such a
conglomerate of different styles
that it helps my own style.”
Concerning the Davidson
music scene, Brad responded:
“There isa plethora of individ-
ual musicians on campus who are
really good, but only a small
number of bands,” said Brad. “
The scene has a lot of potential but
it’s definitely not tapped into yet.
Within the core group of musi-
cians, alotof people play together.”
Beyond the campus, the band
mentioned their upcoming shows
scheduled at UVA, Swanee, and
Charlotte Country Day. ~

“Hopefully, we’ ll finish out the.

year, get better and try to play in
clubs this summer,” said Tom.

As for any musical aspirations,
the band members are skeptical.
Tom stated that “nobody here says,
‘I want to be a rock and roll star’.
There is so much competition out
there.”

“From what I gather,” offered
Brad,”a musician’s life isn’t all
that fun, as far as always being on
the road, getting little sleep, long
hours...My. goal is just to make
music, and hopefully people will
get something from that. That’s
my honest aspiration. Hopefully
people will enjoy it and it will
make them happy-that’s what is
important.”

With an array of classic favor-
ites from Bristish ‘supergroups to
Texas blues/rock to Bay-area psy-
chedelic, there is no doubt that
Residew will do just that. Look out
for Residew bringin’ the house

Exercise & Diet
During the Holidays

If you gained a few pounds
during the holidays, you aren’t
alone. Make a resolution to lose
weight and start TODAY!

Avoid crash dieting as this
often leads to diet failure and
greater weight gain later. Very
low calorie diets and high protein/
low carbohydrate diets produce
large water weight losses. Water
weight is quickly regained when
normal eating habits resume.

Consumption of less than 1200
calories daily can lead to muscle
protein loss, lowering your calorie
(energy) requirements further.
Inadequate nutrient intake and fa-
tigue are other consequences.

Generally a weight loss plan
should provide 10 calories per

Regular aerobic exercise is

and smokes his cigarette. On his
face reads an invisible. sign, “No
Trespassing”. Despite a few over-
used concepts, Reversal of For-
tune is a well-developed drama
confronting the issue of American
social class structure and its rela-
tionship to man’s right toreceivea
fair trial. Irons adds another feather
in his cap as one of Hollywood's
most unique and talented actors
while Close maintains a firm grasp
on her amazing versitality. Rever-__

sure things.
