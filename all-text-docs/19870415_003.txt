Breakdowns plague telephone system _

By NELLE MCCORKLE -

. Telephone overcrowding may
force expansion of the college’s
existing switchboard system.

Three additional trunk lines
installed Monday night may tem-
porarily alleviate the problem, Di-
rector of Personnel and Adminis-
trative Services Bob Stephenson
said.

“We’ve outgrown our tele-
phone system,” Stephenson said.
Currently the college utilizes 400
extensions, the present American
Telephone and Telegraph Dimer-
sion 400 system’s capacity.

The three new lines increase
the number of trunk lines to 21: 12
lines handle incoming calls and
nine lines handle outgoing calls.

Recent efforts to unburden the
college switchboard caused mista-
ken call transfers, Stephenson

said, including phone calls di-
rected to the College Union which
ended up at the library. Southern
Bell attempted to transform tele-
phone lines last month to permit
two-way operation; during the
change, the system’s trunk rotary

_and_break-rotary switch missent

incoming calls. The difficulty
caused Southern Bell to return all
college lines to one-way opera-
tion,

Three problem areas emerge
under the present system accord-
ing to Stephenson. He noted ina-
bility to add further extensions;
difficulty of reaching the central
switchboard; and lack of addi-
tional cable ‘pairs connecting
Chambers Building to Cunnin-
gham fine Arts building and
Johnston gymnasium.

Switchboard Operator Vivian
Davis also called the current sys-
tem insufficient for the college’s

needs. “The system is lousy and
could stand a great
change . . . It’s just not able to
carry the load that we have,” -she
said. Weekday peak usage occurs
between 12:30 p.m. and 1:30
p.m., Davis said; the Union han-
dies calls between 6:00 p.m. and
8:00 a.m. :

Installed in late 1977, tele-
phone system accomodated col-
lege needs until recently,
Stephenson said. “It has just got-
ten increasingly worse this last
school year,” he said. “Obviously
we just have more people trying to
contact the college.”

Potential solutions include re-
placement of the AT&T Dimen-
sion 400 system with a larger
leased or purchased switchboard.
Such a system could connect col-
lege telephones to Davidson’s
PRIME COmputer or to student
telephones, Stephenson said.

Another possible solution in-
volves installation of mini-tele-
phone systems connecting the ath-
letic and fine arts departments to
Chambers, reducing the number
of necessary cable pairs, Stephen-
son said.

Davis suggested eliminating
selected departments’ calls. “My
solution would be to give the most
frequently called offices their own
telephone numbers,” she said.
Davis cited Admissions and
Alumni/Annual fund offices, the
athletic department, and the
Union.

A new switchboard could be
operating during the 1988-89
academic year, Stephenson said.
“I see this next year as being one
of just king of holding things to-

gether the best way we can in

order to stay afloat until a new sys-
tem is installed,” he stated.
“Replacing the existing system

will cost approximately $500,000
Stephenson said. Incorporating
student telephone lines into the
main system could reduce the col-
lege’s cost while decreasing stu-
dent telephone bills, Stephenson
said.

Cost of a new switchboard
constitutes a captial expense to be
paid by a specific | grant or a capti- _
own tal funds campaign, Vice Presi-
dent for Business and Finance
Robert S. Sutton said. An inde- .
pendent telephone consultant is
now examining the college’s
needs. Director of Computer Ser-
vices Center John Casey and
Stephenson will review this con-
sultant’s report and may recom-
mend a particular system to Presi-
dent John Kuykendall, Vice Presi-
dent for Academic Affairs Robert
Williams, and Sutton. The Board
of Trustees must then approve any
proposed major capital expense.

liberal arts in a civilized society?

Williams: I think the liberal
arts’ give us perspective and
breadth. They let us understand a
lot of complex areas of life, and I
think they enable us to weigh an
.act on the basis of a barrage of in-
formation that comes at us daily.
They enable us to be selective and
to make judgments. Also, to some
degree there is an ethic of service
about the liberal arts. The liberal
arts ideal is not merely just to be
educated, but to be educated for
some purpose. I think it is true that
the liberal arts enable us to ap-
proach new problems that we have
never seen before and to grapple
with them. By being exposed to a
whole range of approaches to
knowledge and to life in general,
you have balance, you have
breadth, and you have the capac-
ity to respond to situations and to
renew yourself.

_Davidsonian: Some people
make the criticism that Davidson
_ ds plated from the “real world,”
that students are studying subjects
that have no direct relevance to
modern society, and that the at-
mosphere of the college is simply
unrealistic. How would you re-
spond to this criticism?

Williams: I think partly, it’s
‘not true. Certainly there are areas,
having to do with technology or
international studies, | where
clearly what’s being studied here
is directly related to what’s going
on in the world around us. I think
the sad commentary is on the real
world, not on Davidson. Right at
the heart of Davidson are ques-
tions of ethics and value that ought
to be part of the real world. All
you have to do is to look at
Washington these days to see
what is missing. What is missing
is any sense of ethics. At David-
son there is a moral sensibility,
which is partly due to the church
relationship but is also partly due
to the liberal arts. As far as the no-
tion of value — that not every-

thing can be quantified, but that
some things are of value and that
you can get at those.things through
literature, through the arts —
some of that seems to me to be
terribly important in the real
world. And its absence in the real

world is less a negative comment
on Davidson than on the feal
world.

Davidsonian: The trustees
and the administration seem now
to have a strong commitment to
furthering the “national reputa-
tion” of Davidson. What changes
do you see necessary for the
achievement of this goal?

Williams: Davidson already
has, in a sense, a national reputa-
tion. But that reputation is one of
being the best liberal arts college
in the Southeast. I would like to
see us being thought of as one of
the best liberal arts colleges in the
country. That is not to reject our
regional base, because I think the
regional inheritance is vital to
what Davidson is. It would be
criminal to give up the traditional
strengths and the inheritance of

Davidson in some grasp for im-°

agined national stature.

On the other hand, I do aspire
to recruiting, retaining, and de-
veloping the best possible faculty
that we can, and that means facul-
ty who are teachers, scholars, and
good citizens. I keep trying to tell
the faculty that I see research and
professional activity as a crucial
ingredient in good teaching,
rather than a diversion from it. I
think that unless you have the
quality of mind and the drive to
test your ideas against those of
your peers through publication,
through scholarship, through

creative activity, then ina way we__

don’t have any quality control
over what gets taught in the class-
room and how it gets taught.

So I think national reputation
is not an end, but it’s a conse-
quence of doing something right. I
think what we really need to be
concerned about more is the qual-
ity of education at Davidson. That
means getting the best possible
faculty we can. The quality of the
students and the quality of the fac-
ulty will determine the quality of
the institution.

Davidsonian: In terms of the
quality of students, do you believe
that the admissions ratio (60 per-
cent male, 40 percent female),
which the trustees have set, limits
Davidson’ s ability to achieve the
highest calibre student body?

Williams: I am_ against

quotas. I was surprised to discover
this ratio when I came to David-
son. It seems to me that we are
perhaps unwisely excluding some
very talented women. My own
preference is that I would like to
see us add modestly to the popula-
tion of the college over the next

few years, and I think the addition ©

of more women students at David-
son would be a good thing.

Davidsonian: You. have im-
plemented new procedures for
evaluating the credentials of fac-
ulty members for deciding on
whether or not to grant tenure.
How are these additional new
procedures an improvement over
the older procedures?

Williams: Davidson is the
only institution I know of where,.
in the past, when you wanted to
promote a faculty member, you
didn’t ask people in the world
beyond Davidson -what they
thought of their work. It was in-
credible to me that this wasn’t
being done. So all I have basically
done is to announce that I am
going to get five letters from out-
side of Davidson for the evalua-
tion of each faculty member who
is up for tenure review. In other
words, if you are looking at an
economist, then you want letters
from other economists, who can
make a judgment on their abilities
as an economist, rather than as a
teacher of economics. My argu-
ment is that unless you’re a good
economist, you’re not going to be
a good teacher of economics.

So this indicates that we are
going to be more complete in our
review process and that we are
going to try to get all the evidence,
and I:think frankly that it’s a fuller
and fairer evaluation. Unless you
do this, you are excluding infor-
mation which in most cases can be
very favorable.

Davidsonian: What aspects of
your position at Davidson have
you enjoyed the most so far?

Williams: Basically we are
delighted to be at Davidson. I
couldn’t be happier with this posi-
tion at this time. There are days
when it’s not easy. My office is
known collectively as the hot seat.
It’s the place where some hard

choices and decisions have to be -

made. But in terms of the ability to

play a leadership role in helping
the faculty make some things hap-
pen — that’s the exciting, : posi-
tive part of it. I am also certainly
delighted with the people I have
known, both the students and the
faculty. There is a lot less abra-
siveness that one can often find in
a academic institution. On bal-
ance this is a very positive, think-
ing faculty.

Davidsonian: And yet there
must be some aspects of your job
which frustrate you sometimes.

Williams: The “down” side of
my position is the frugality side.
There never appear to be enough
resources to do what I want to do.
Before coming to Davidson, I
never really had to watch every
penny I spent. I am not a profli-
gate spender, but there are some

desperate needs on this campus. _

that are not being met. My great
hope is that this capital campaign
can create a new excitement about
Davidson.

Also, there is an astounding
administrative workload which I
cannot delegate because I have
one secretary and 110 faculty, and
which takes me away from schol-
arship and teaching. I really miss
the classroom this year, because I
am a born teacher. I hate not to be
teaching, but next year I will be
teaching a seminar in Russian in-
tellectual history.

Davidsonian: You have spent

a major part of your time in recent
months in attempting to forge a
consensus among the faculty on
the proposed calendar and cur-
riculum changes, which include
the implementation of the early
Semester system. What will be the
end result of these changes, once
implemented?

Williams: | think the end re-
sult is going to be a much better
learning environment for David-
son, where the faculty and stu-
dents will have much more time

for learning that will be more sig-
nificant and more autonomous. 1

think we now have a system that
focuses on in-class learning. Any’

person that has directed a thesis or
done a term paper realizes that ten
weeks is very short to get into a
subject, understand what you
want.to do, do the research, and
write it up. Soa lot of this is about
time, changing the temporal con-
text of learning.

Davidsonian: How would you
summarize your overall perspec-
tive on the college and its future?

Williams: Davidson is a great
community. I hope that we can
make it even better than it is. It
isn’t a criticism of Davidson to
have aspirations to make it even

“better. At the same time, I think
it’s very important not to lose
sight of the values and heritage
that have made Davidson the
school it is.
