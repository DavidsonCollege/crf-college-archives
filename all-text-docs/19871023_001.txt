Volume LXXVIII, Number 6

By BILL SCOUTEN
and MARGARET CARROLL

On October 8, 1987, at its sec-
ond meeting of the term, the Pat-
terson Court Council reached a
unanimous decision that trays
would not be used as a means of
distributing alcohol at parties on
Patterson Court.

According to Ginger Broad-
dus, president of the PCC, the
purpose of the Patterson Court al-
cohol policy is to educate the stu-
dent community of Davidson Col-
lege in the-“responsible service
and consumption of alcoholic

- beverages on Patterson Court.”

The unanimous decision of the

PCC to outlaw trays, therefore, is

aimed to discourage what Broad- -

dus termed “general distribution
of alcohol” and to promote a
healthy attitude of responsibility
and fun.

The problem of drinking on
the Davidson campus is not a new
one. However, with the advent of
the twenty-one year old drinking
age, the drinking situation fell into
disarray. Accordingly, the admin-
istration of Davidson College for-
mulated an alcohol policy which
would adhere to state law while
also stressing the involvement of
students in its execution.

Patterson Court is responsible
for regulating its own parties.
Comprised of representatives (the
president and treasurer) from each
house on Patterson Court, the
PCC monitors the alcohol service
and distribution of “any party, so-
cial function, or event sponsored
by a Patterson Court house on or

~ off campus.” This policy requires «

much student cooperation.

The alcohol policy of David-
son “does not include provisions
for a dry campus.” However, “dry
campuses do exist at other
schools, where fraternities and

-~ sororities have not been able to de- -

vise an effective means of educat-
ing their members, and instilling
responsibility,” said Broaddus.
“Responsiblity” is the key
word in the use of alcohol. In-
deed, it was recently suggested by
_ the trustee Committee on Student
Life that Davidson students . are

drinking irresponsibly. The trus-
tee committee is not blind to the
consumption of alcohol on college
campuses nationwide. Will Terry,

Dean of Students, advised that the .

trustees have a good feel for the
student body and with what’ goes
on. Consequently, the committee
is concerned with the legal and
personal Welfare of the students
and of the college, in that order.

~ Despite the increased concern
of the trustees, Broaddus com-
mented that the changes in the Pat-
terson Court alcohol policy were
imminent and had nothing to do
with the fall trustee meeting. She
added further that trays should
have been outlawed earlier.

The policy concerning the dis-
tribution of alcohol originally
read: “individuals removing al-
coholic beverages.from the desig-
nated service area will do so with
the understanding that they are re-
sponsible if the beverage is given
to an under-age individual for
consumption.” (section I, article
7) The regulation was never qual-
ified by a maximum number of
beverages that could be brought

up: thus, the tray came into use.

Broaddus, with the backing of
the PCC, believes that use of the
tray as a means of distributing al-
cohol defeats the purpose of the
alcohol policy and actually endan-
gers the student.

First of all, the use of the tray
encourages “general. distribution
of alcohol.” The PCC was formed
to educate the campus about re-
sponsible drinking. Broaddus ex-
pressed the PCC’s view saying
that the decision to curtail this

‘type of distribution came not as

much from the legal standpoint,
but rather from the | personal
standpoint. ‘

As explained by Broaddus,
“the premise behind the Patterson
court alcohol policy, and behind

-our recent decision, is that we’re

adult enough, mature enough, and
responsible enough to handle situ-
ations involving alcoholic bever-
ages.” And, of course, as SGA
president Conrad Doenges points
‘out, it “puts a great deal of respon-
sibility on the students to make
this policy workable.”

Faculty tenure committee requested

By FRANK FOLGER and
WALT REYNOLDS

President Kuykendall has re-
quested that Dean of Faculty
Robert Williams and the Profes-
sional Affairs Committee consid-
er the establishment of a Faculty
Tenure Committee. This request
was made during a September fac-
ulty meeting, but is not expected
to reach the proposal status until
this winter or spring.

‘Under the current tenure re-
view system, the President and the
Dean of Faculty are the sole advis-
ers to the Board of Trustees con-
cerning tenure renewal of faculty.
Kuykendall indicated that most
colleges and universities he knew
of maintained committees for peer
judgement and tenure promotion
recommendations. we

Kuykendall has made clear the
fact that he has had “strong con-
victions” from the beginning
about adding a committee of peers

Davidson.

During his interview for the
position of President of the col-
lege, Kuykendall had been asked
his opinions on tenure review:
“The best way to approach this is
through a recommendation from a
committee of one’s peers,” was

_—

his response. Since then, Kuyken-
dall said, he has had a desire for a
change in the system regarding
tenure review.

The approach taken, if any, is
still uncertain. As the projected
proposal is- still in developmental
stages, the possible role of a new
faculty tenure committe remains
in question as well.

One possible approach would
be for the committee to review the
material that is provided in an in-
dividual’s folder pending a tenure
decision and issue a recommenda-
tion to the Administration. The
committee’s recommendation
would be considered a relevant
part of the subsequent recommen-
dation to the Board of Trustees
concerning the ultimate decision.

_ Whatever the case, Kuyken-
dall has expressed without a doubt

that he would like to see a system .

with more peer input into the deci-
sion process. “In the final analy-
sis, one’s peers probably know

___to..the .tenure_review. process _at__better_than_anyone _else exactly

what the promise and potential of
the individual teacher is going to
be.”

He cites several resources to
judge the effectiveness and qual-
ity of professors, such as students’
opinions, various administrators
through their contacts and the out-

i

side commuhity of scholarship,
but said the real focus should be
the people ‘standing beside these
people in the teaching faculty.

This is not the first time in re-
cent school history that a faculty
tenure committee has been pro-
posed. Shortly before Kuykendall
was offered the position of presi-
dent, a proposal for a similar com-
mittee was voted down.

This fact may explain
Kuykendall’s rationale for not im-
mediately suggesting thé idea
once he became president. If and
when a proposal is made to the
faculty, it will then be some time
before it may be implemented.
Implications of a proposal on the
faculty bylaws and on the college

- constitution would require a

thorough deliberation and vote by
both the faculty and the Board of
Trustees.

The topic is now under study .
by the Professional Affairs Com-
mittee and the Vice President of

_Academic Affairs. Since the pro-_

cess of reviewing candidates for
tenure for this year will soon
begin, proposed changes would
not be in effect for this year’s can-
didates. If approved, the change
would be made effective for the
1988-89, school year at the ear-
liest, he said.
