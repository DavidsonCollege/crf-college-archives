The following letter was sent to
Laughing Face Harry in answer to
the above:

Dear Laughing Face Harry:

In answer to your recent letter I
am listing all the nicknames of our
“boys” and the corresponding real
names. This should aid you in keep-
ing up with our activities in this
column and “sizing” us up. Most
of the boys nicknames have come
about through various and devious
activities which I will not take the
time to describe here. I think it will
be ‘better this way.

Beginning at the top with our No.
1 boy of-the gang is “Lover Boy”
Harden who is noted for his activi-
ties with women throughout the
country. His advisers on economic,
political, and religious matters are
respectively “Jocko, the Hack” Haz-
ard and “Geek” or “Eli Howard
Ferguson; Fred “The red-headed
politician” Schmelly; and finally the
gangs chaplain “Jack S” John S.
Lyles.’ The watch-outs for the mob
are “Heals Beals, Half-man” Wiik-
er D. Macaulay who gets into small
places, Dave “No dose” Johnsen
who can never— sleep, and finally
“Dit-eye, Radar, Seal beam” Har
vey McConnel who constantly keeps
us “clued” on police activities and
files the “clues” in the” “Round
head,” Joe Richards? The sky\ pa
trol is “Flyboy” Doxl Watt an is
credited with the story that wlitle
he was flying through a hangar one
day someone decided to close the
hangar doors forcing him to turn
around, The “hocus-focusers”
photographers of each “job” are
“The Chest” Jack Payne; “AM”
Arthuro Lindsay, “El Blako”. Brad-
ley, and “Hypo” Jack King. The
socialites who are always in on ev-
erything are “Spider” Bob Roberts,

or

“Dumb Duck” Ralph Dickson,
“Horrible, Barfly’ Harl  Barlit,
“Pecker-head” Tommy Ward,

“Quincy” Adams, and “Champagne,
Social” Sam McDaniel. The gang
are “Shoulders” John Roddey, Gene
“The Body” Regen who claims that
after taking the Atlas course he de-
veloped from a 98 pound “weakling”
to a 99 pound “superman,” “Reefer”
Jerry Cox, “Li'l Abner” Hal Haynes,
Bill “Bull” Alexander, and ‘Pecos
Pete” Keith O’Kelley. The shoot
ing expert is “Shot, the Obnoxious”
Manly McWilliams, The “Trailers”
for the “Boys” are “Greyhound”
Bill Barron and “Trailways” Bax
ter. In case children are involved
we have a child expert — “pre
adolscent” Jimmy Patterson. Be-
tween deals we are serenaded by
“Petrillo Poofle’S” boys, Jimmy
Larkin, Flyn Long. Chuck Kirby
and Roger Cornell. Noted for theit
fast getaways after “jobs” are
“Swish” Carter and “Choo-Cchoo”
Bill Bird. But faster than these two
when money is involved is H. P,
King. Our “plain clothes men”
are Fred Preyer, Jack Stevenson,
“Dolphus’ Randy Kabrich, Alec
Summers, Jack Hunter, Bob Gil
mer, Harry Bachman, Doug Hix
and Talmadge West.

The above names will give you
idea of what our gang like
on the whole. In other words, we
are plenty good! :

KAPPA ALPHA

The numerousness of the Home-
coming events has taken its toll on
the brothers and pledges of Sigma
Chapter the way of
sleep, The wideness and variation
in the events of this eventful week-
end make it impossible to give a
play-by-play description of all of
them. Despite the lack of @eep on
everyone's part the dances were a
grand success. One of the sober-
chapter regarding dancing, “Dane-
ing,” he says “is nothing but neck-
ing set to music, and I hate music.”
Also he states that “the best part
of the dance is the intermission.”
Another view held is that “dancing
is just like dragging a wet sack of
cement around,” On the whole,
though, the girls present were prob-
ably the best,cxop of feminity that
Sigma Chapter has ever had at a
dance, Brother X remarks that “if
Lee had the breastworks of those
girls, Grant would have never taken
Richmond.” How true!

in precious

The “I am going steady crowd"
consisted of Art Lindsay, Doug
Hix, Bill Adams, Paul Richardson,
Bill Bird, Chuck Kirby, Jimmy
Larkin, Robert Jinright, Wilkes
Macaulay, Henry King, and Charles
Mitchell. The more or less hap-
hazard Aaters were Hazard, Schoen-
berger and Buckey with gals from
J-ville, Bryan Robinson, Watt Jef-
fries, Fred Preyer, Sam McDaniel,
Tim Harden, Harl Barlit, Manly
McWilliams, Jack Hunter, Jack
Stevenson, and Randy Kabrich.

Following the Friday night dance
was a_ breakfast at the Piccadilly
Grill. This breakfast proved the
fact that Sigma has a monopoly on
the most dis-ablest speakers on the
campus.

The main event of Saturday was
the winning of the cup for the best
Homecoming decorations. Those
who participated in this undertak
ing are too numerous. to mention,
but Dick Baxter deserves some lau-
rels for the excellent .idea,

The main event for the coming
week-end is the barbecue being held
at Ervin Lodge for the alumni. This
should definitely prove to be a gala
affair, Also, Henry King and Harry
3achman are journeying to Bristol
this coming: week. They plan on
having a “bridge” party in some
country surrounding Bristol.

PI KAPPA PHI

The big question of the week is
“Just how wet can the little town
of Davidson get?” We all know the
answer to that one. There is ppac
tically no doubt about it. Saturday,
Nov. 6,, was definitely an all-time
low blow by the weather man
Speaking of the weather man, it is
understood that the one who gave
‘Slick John” the bum ‘steer last
week just did get on that “Slow
Boat to China” with Tom Dewey
and Elmo Roper, Pledge Metero-
ligist Trew Gurley and Bill Cargent
got a twenty-five year suspended
sentence.

All dampness aside we wish te
congratulate Pan-Man Barringer and
his assistants, “Plans” Gowan,
“Bonecrusher Gus” Edwards, and
“Giggly Higgie,” for the fine job
they did. Hats off also to “How
High” Lander and his boys for e
Wharp decoration. Honorable men-
tion is certainly better than no men-
tion atall, Catch this last boquet of
roses, Smoe. You done good,

Enough of that in this column. If

I'm going to be a slander man, I
have to keep my record unclean. It
put the squeeze on us to cover all
the after dance activities of the gay
ones Saturday night, but we have
learned that “Sugar Daddy” Hun
ter and our own “Hairless Herb"
did get their daughters home safe
and sound,

Multitudes of the amourous ones
stuck out for the all night session
at the farm, “Perilous” Parks held
forth for the crowd. Notables not-
ed at the festive fete were; ‘Cess-
Pool” Brannon, “Bengy” Morris,
“Daniel Boone’ McSwain, ‘“Licen-
tious” Luke, “The Voyager” Tay-
lor, “Terrible” Tolbert, “Hysteri-
cal” Higginbotham, “Nightly” Nall,
“Red” Rush, “Casanova” Cassels,
“Weepy” Hardin, ‘Zoot’ Campbell,
“Curious” Coble, “Squeal” Neil and
various lovelies.

“Do wr die for Pi Kappa Phi”
Cline held his usual on the ninth
at the Charlotte, “Raw” and bud-
dies, Alumni Brothers, Hipp, Wal
ton, and Higginbctham (Big Hig
gie) entertained a small but distin-
guished group of the noble ones and
their onts and only’s. Seen but not
heard were “Boom” Barger, Don
Neal, “Long Gone’ Helton, Heard
hut not seen were “Rho” Deal, Reg
EE, Nall, and Carl Los.

The poem this week is condensed
for lack of space and for lack of
poem:

Ode To Homecoming
All is gone, but not forgotten;

What ain’t been got, must be
rotten.

Davidson's Richardson Athletic

Field was constructed «by the

Richardson brothers, Mr. H. Smith
Richardson, of the class of 1906, and
Mr. Lunsford Richardson, Jr., of
the class of 1914, as a memorial to
their father, Mr. Lunsford Richard-
