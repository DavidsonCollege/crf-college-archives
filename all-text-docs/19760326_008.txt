A Review

Winners of many internationally
famous competitions, the Branko
Krsmanovich Chorus will perform in
Love Auditorium on Monday, March
29 at 8:15 p.m. One of Europe’s oldest
chorus, they are a continuation of the
reknown Obilich Choir, founded in
1884, in their homeland of Yugo-
slavia.

Eighty singers between the ages of
eighteen and thirty will sing con-
ducted by Bogdan Babich. When not

Slavic chorus to sing

on tour, these singers are students in
both graduate and undergraduate
programs at Belgrade University.
The Branko Krsmanovich Chorus
offers a richly contrasting program.
The first part of the concert will
consist of classics such as ‘‘Exultate
Deo”’ by Scarlatti, Tchaikovsky’s
‘“‘Alleluia,’’ and ‘‘Ein Hennlein
Weiss”’ by Scandelli. After the Inter-
mission, the chorus will appear in the

costumes of the six republics of

Yugoslavia: Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia-
Herzegovina, Macedonia, and Mon-
tenegro.

Ancient music revived -

By ANNE FICKLEN

Ars Antigua de Paris performed
Friday night to a less-than-capacity
audience in Love Auditorium, prov-
ing once more that culture can come
to Davidson, but the Davidson stu-
dent won't always come to culture.

Ars Antigua de Paris plays only
music written before the 1700’s, and
uses only the instruments of the
period, many of which are the
prototypes of modern-day orchestral
instruments. One of the most unique
of these was the krumm horn {Ger-
man), a member of the wind family
which sounds surprisingly like the
modern kazoo. Another unusual in-
strument the group used was the
tavor, a forerunner of the bass and
timpani drums which was used for
marching songs in the crusades: The
many stringed instruments used were
primarily plucked, being some of the
first orchestratinal instruments (as
they were supposed to mimic the
human voice).

The concert itself began slowly, and
the audience seemed unprepared for
the muted level of sound which the
instruments produced: In fact, many
students were seen leaving before the

‘first break, although they did leave

quietly.

Greater audience rapport was ach-

ieved, however, when the musicians.
began to talk about their instruments
and to explain the historical context
of their songs. Joseph Sage, the
group’s counter-tenor, was _ particu-
larly witty, anticipating the question,
“Are you a castrati?”’ by proclaiming,
“T have a wife and children, and my
children look like me.”’
_ Joseph Sage’s performance was
definitely the most unusual aspect of
the concert. His transition from
falsetto (so called because the tech-
nique employs a man’s two false vocal
chords) to his regular tenor voice was
amazingly smooth. In fact; in his first
song, Sage could have been mistaken
for an instrument himself.

Sage’s control over his vocal dyn-
amics was superb—his pianissimos
were barely audible and his fortes,
though rare, were piercing. Sage’s
constant awareness of each instru-
ment’s unique qualities allowed him
to achieve a constant balance, never
overpowering or being overpowered.

For those who did stay throughout
the entire performance, the evening
became spicier, especially when trans-
lations of Ars de Aantigua’s encores
were provided.

Wallace attempts gutsy comeback

By ROBERT HUTCHINSON
Staff Writer

Probably the most controversial
presidential candidate this year is
George C. Wallace. You either love
him or hate him-- there’s no middle
ground. S
~ So many stories circulate about
him, it is hard to separate the fact
from the legend. Doris Nunn, his
Charlotte campaign manager, calls
him the ‘‘most upright man in
American politics today.” (I give her
credit for making the pun uninten-
tional.)

She speaks of his standing on the
steps of the University of Alabama to
prevent two blacks from entering
(back in ’63) as an action for state’s
rights, not a personal bias against the
prospective students. Recent inter-
views with the two tend to support
this idea.

The man is a legend in his own
time, but he is also a candidate for the
President ofthe United States. Is
there something more than legend
that has given him strong and
respectable finishes in the Massachu-
setts, Florida, and North Carolina
primaries?

George Wallace was born August
25, 1919, at Clio, Alabama. As a farm
boy, he learned early the lessons of
hard work and economy by doing
manual chores to help his family
financially.

When he arrived onthe University
of Alabama campus in 1937, his total
assets consisted of the suit he wore, a
few dollars in‘his pocket and some
odds and ends jin ‘his cardboard
suitcase. His‘father died that year
and he had to work himself through
school with various odd jobs.

Despite his having to earn money
to finance his education, he still had
time to be captain of the Freshman
Baseball team, Freshman Class
President and Captain of the Varsity
Boxing team. (Makes you wish you
were at Alabama with all that time,

doesn’t it?)

After graduating in 1942 he
volunteered forthe U.S. Air Corps
and served for three years with dis-
tinction. In 1947, at the age of 27, he
was elected to the Alabama Legis-
lature. In 1958, he ran in the Alabama
gubernatorial primary and finished
second in a crowded field of fourteen.

Four years later, he was elected to
the office by the :tangest vote ever
given a gubernatorial candidate in the
history of the state up until that time.
He was re-elected in 1970 and 1974.

In 1968, Wallace ran for President
as a Third Party candidate, ‘receiving
an amazing and highly repsectable
ten million votes.

He ran again :in 1972 and was
picking up momemtum towards the
Democratic nomination when he was
gunned down at Laurel, Maryland.
The 1976 campaign marks his third
major drive for the Presidency, and,
though few political speculators
expect him to win the-nomination, he
is regarded as a potential spoiler for

#

‘Set pe

the convention’s frontrunners.
George Wallace’s campaign slogan

- is ‘‘Trust the People!’’ In explaining

his motivation, he writes: ‘‘I run for
President because I care about
America. I love this land, our people,
our traditions, our values. Like you, I
am deeply concerned about the
direction of our country. My only
thought is to help bring about
changes that will heal what is
troubling America so we can move on
the great victories which freedom
offers.”’

His:style is gutsy, straight-forward
and wnapolegetically pro-middle
class. ‘I trust the people,’’ he says.
“They are right more times than the
politicians. We must remove the cloak
of secrecy ‘that shuts out the people.”’
He takes a hard-line stand against the
communists; no recognition of
Castro’s Cuba, no foreign aid to
Communist countries or those
countries who aid Communists,
superior offensive and defensive
military capability to put America in

a strong position to negotiate with her
enemies.

Wallace advocates a change in the
tax structure to shift the burden to
the ultra-rich. He wants a ‘‘reason-
able welfare program and a curtail-
ment of payments to able-bodied
individuals which motivate them not
to work.

He supports a constitutional am-
endment to protect the lives of unborn
children and to nullify the Supreme
Court decision on abortions.

He opposes the Equal Rights
Amendment on the grounds that it
takes away many rights women now
enjoy, but he wants full rights for
every woman.

The Governor is opposed to gun
control laws because they ‘‘take guns
away from the law-abiding citizens
and the criminals will have them
anyway.” He advocates a first prior-
ity energy program to make the
United States self-sufficient; Not
surprisingly, he wants to see an end
to forced busing and a return to the
freedom of choice and the neighbor-
hood school concepts.

Wallace’s campaign brochure char-
acterizes him as ‘‘a man who speaks
for rank and file citizens.’’ He’s a
strong conservative with most of his
support coming from labor and the
rest of middle-class America.

But the critics say his biggest
drawback is that he is too far removed
from mainstream American politics.

George Wallace may or may not be
the best choice for the next President
of the United States. If he fails to
receive the nomination this time,
Mrs. Nunn tells me that 1976 will be
his last try for the Presidency.

Irregardless of the outcome in New
York this summer, his gutsy and
courageous comeback attempt for the
1976 Democratic nomination will
remain an indelible monument to an
indelible man—both in legend and
reality.
