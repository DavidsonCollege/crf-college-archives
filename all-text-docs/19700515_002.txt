~The Sixth Time Around

We certainly hope that with the
conclusion of the fraternity analysis
series one striking point has come
home to all readers: for the results
obtained, this is probably the most
over-sttuidied, over-talked problem at
Davidson. Rehashed over the past dec-
ade, this situation has continued vir-
tually without change.

No other policy area of the col-
lege has seen more committee or com-
mission meetings with more faculty
and student time apparently wasted.
Indeed with five major study reports
in as many years, it seems odd that
one can ‘find people yet discussing
the situation.’

It is not that an inadequate number
of avenues for change were explored
— certainly not. Many worthwhile
suggestions have been studied and
then reported out of committee. Some
of these required large capital out-
lays, but many required just direc-
tion by the college.

Repeatedly it has been determin-
ed that the present fraternity system
requires immediate and © marked
change. We, too, believe that the sys-
tem is harmful and inadequate and
must not continue as presently struc-
tured. What we really deplore is the
complete dominance of the fraternities
over social life.

Quite a few suggestions have been
made for eliminating this dominance,
one of the most impressive of which
is de-emphasis of fraternities through
a more dorm-oriented social life with
added Union activities. We consider
this to be the best alternative avail-
able. Moreover, we think that many
of the changes which would be:as-
sociated with this new direction should
be made immediately — next year
that is.

Surprisingly, despite the seeming
momentum . created by the various
studies, some mysterious -restraining
force has kept many people, apparent-
ly dedicated, from taking any posi-
tive, major step. What this force
could be cannot possibly be imagined
unless it is*hidden somewhere in the
tail end of the faculty and administra-
tion or in the heads of the trustees.

While it is clear that small groups
have certain developmental and ed-
ucational values, two points are ex-
tremely clear: 1) “that fraternities
dominate the social life here to the
detriment of all’ and 2) ‘‘consider-
able damage is done to members of,
and to the persons rejected by,” the

fraternities.

Yet though this is admitted by near-
ly all concerned faculty members and
freshmen and many fraternity men,
we have been blatantly flippant about
the problem and remarkably able to
completely forget such experiences
as Rush and Greek Week except when
they are immediately upon us.

Amazingly enough, though admitt
ing much damage done to: themselves
and others by our present social
structure and admitting no real
brotherhood other than that found
in any small group, upperclassmen
still justify propagating the system
by their presence solely on the
grounds of convenience alone. We
ask, ““What about the others?”

As has been pointed out very clear-
ly in the present analysis, change in
the present social system is unlikely
from within — meaning from» the
students. And if capital improvements
must be made first, it is impossible
for such changes to come from the
transients. Therefore, we look to the
continuing college community for
direction.

We do not. doubt their competence
to give adequate study to the prob-
lem or to make some carefully studied
recommendations. After ten years
and five reports, however, their lead-
ership is obviously in question.

Nearly. a year now since. the issu-
ance of the commission reports to
President’ Spencer, it is just about
time the President, administration,
and faculty take some stand and make
some definite plans for next year
and the next five. No further study
could possibly be necessary or even
productive.

During this spring and next fall
we have a new chance. The Student
Life Committee is presently evaluat-
ing the Social Patterns Commission
report and making its own recom-
mendations which will be presented
to the trustees in thé fall. President
Spencer is planning to make’a state-
ment concerning his feelings on the
matter.

We hope that the sixth time around
we may have a chance. We urge that
the Student Life Committee make
specific recommendations ant4in-
clude a’ reasonable timetable for
their implementation — reasonable
considering time already lost over
past discussions and reasonable con-
sidering the urgent need for a solu-
tion to the problem.

Campaign For Peace

The ROTC sit-in, the peace vigil,
the march in Charlotte, and last
weekend’s massive nationwide pro.
tests of expansion of the war in
Southeast Asia were all fine and good.

They registered the substantial
disagreement which exists with Presi-
dent Nixon’s policies. Such immediate
reactions to the widened war were
called for. .

But where do we go frorn here?

Nixon has promised to tone his
administration’s repressive rhetoric.
The local antiiROTC movement has
turned its attention to the worthy
cause of increasing Davidson’s black
student population. And the Kent
State victims have been buried.

But the United States is still very
much involved in Southeast Asia. We
still have troops in Cambodia. We’re
still messing around in Laos... And
our chief import from Vietnam is
still U. S. servicemen in coffins.

Will the young lapse into apathy?
Will they rise to revolution?

Assuming the American democratic
system is really viable we hope not.

With that assumptien- we- have two
proposals for changing ihe country’s
directions both domestic and foreign.

First, we propose that members of
the college; community open up the
debate of present policies.

Students and faculty alike will have

B.c

excellent opportunities this summer
to make public their views on Ameri-
can militarism and involvement in
Southeast Asia: Speaking engagements
in churches and civic clubs could do
much to spread concerned views to
the electorate that*will eventually
force a change in policies. Many in-
fluential members of the “silent ma-
jority” simply have not listened to the
young because they have mistaken
concern for what is to them unpala-
table radicalism. Sober expressions
of opininon-in-the—very—bastions—of
this “majority” might have.a real ef-
fect on the elections next fall.

Secondly, we propose that Davidson
College take steps to rearrange its
academic calendar so that members
of the college community can devote
at least a week before the Novem-
ber elections to political campaigning
for peace candidates. .

We appeal to the college that in-
dividuals be freed temporarily from
academic responsibilities so that they
might work ‘to change the country.

We hope that Davidson will see fit
to follow the lead of Princeton and
Duke Universities and make the re-
quested schedule»changes, and we
encourage those disturbed about the
war to do something constructive to
end it.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Thornton Attacks Pyeatt,
Views Present Dilemma

To the Editor:

The spacé allowed me in
this good paper is too pre
cious to squander blowing
up Robert Pyeatt’s intem-
perate criticism of me into
an issue.

Neither he nor | are that
important — when dead we
will soon be forgotten. Ideas
do not die so easily.
“Many young people (and
some, like David Dellinger,
not so young) shout ‘‘Oink"’
and throw bags of«.excre-
ment at those who are sup
porting a constitutional re-
public within a framework
of law and order.

Let them stray away from
the championship of a mob,
and just one time get mug-
ged and robbed, and they
will change their mindless
“Oink” to a fervent cry of
supplication... “Help!
Help! Police!”

So Robert has thrown his
bag of excrement at me,
not knowing me at all.s<Now

out an imprecation, and see
this:

As was expected, — stu-

throughout the nation after
President Nixon's decision
to send troops into Cam-
bodia last week. Most of the
demonstrations and marches
were peaceful; some weren't
so--peaceful,—-

Davidson College was no
exception. Within hours, de-
monstrations and other
forms of protest were or-
ganized. Fortunately, most
of these were well planned,
and proper permits were
obtained to carry them out.

The 58 hour demonstra-
tion across from the Post
Office was well planned and
properly executed. It is too
bad that every form of
protest in this country can’t
be like this one.

SESE,

A Virgin Sacrifice

TRIAS SE,

By,
ROBERT
PYEATT -

“This war will be legitimate when David Eisen-
hower is sent to Cambodia and Tricia Nixon is offered

up as a virgin sacrifice.”

The Nixon Administration seems to be vacillating
between a “Death to Bums” campaign and another
round of Bring Us Together, that old television game
show where the winner gets a used car, a date with
Tricia’ Nixon and a feeling of reassurance.

And the Peace Movement is on

the edge of extinction and over-
whelming support at the same time.
Its members want very much to be-
lieve Nixon, to accept troop with-
drawals and draft reform, and go

their own ways.

Nixon, a scaly, reptilian sort of
fellow, is directed by some tenuous
thought processes twisting through
the art-nouveau curves of his tor-
tured psyche that no one will ever

know, except possibly John Mitchell;
Mitchell is either his alter ego or his superego.

The current crisis has certain predictable facets
of the kind one would expect from the politico-mili-
tary clique which seems to be running the country.

But the~
is against

position, the Peace Movement, or whoever
e’ President and the Generals (President-

General?) continues to be unpredictable.

The long-haired yet clean-cut white liberals and
radicals are difficult to figure out. For the most part
they have ignored making obvious comparisons be-
tween the killing of the Kent State four and the
Orangeburg Massacre two years ago, yet it is an im-

. portant and enlightening comparison. The heights of

the civil rights movement of five years ago seem a
century away now. Except for a modicum of concern
over whether the Panthers get a fair trial, or-a trial
at all, the black minority gets nothing but some use-

less sympathy from white liberalism.

The trial by co-opting of issues began when Nixon
announced that he stood four-square for a clean en-
vironment and. all we enlightened honkies had to do
was rally around him and solve the ecology problem.
As the ecology movement gathered support Peace
declined—ecology is so much easier, and you don't

have to go to jail about it.

The ecology people didn’t notice or didn’t mind
when Nixon’s Clean Rivers Bill, which he boasted was
a great step for mankind, appropriated less federal
funds for pollution control than Johnsoh’s Clean Rivers
Bill of 1965 had. And all of Nixon’s big industrialist
friends and contributors are getting on the band-

wagon: too.

Then the announcements of troop withdrawals,

‘that insipid November television speech, and the draft

lottery seemed to take the drive out of the Peace

Movement.

It came alive after Cambodia, but the weekend
in Washington — everyone expected ‘violence’? —
what happened? Either the police have been more at
fault in these demonstrations than we thought, and
somebody finally told them to cool it, or maybe no-
body was so angry about Cambodia after ll.
__. The majority of students at Davidson who are
into Peace want something with beautiful sunny after-
noons, lots of folk songs, little children playing, sort
of an overgrown Presbyterian Youth Fellowship. Or
they want Peter Hobbie to get up and be chairman
of lots of meetings and tell them how it’s going to be.
_ But. folk songs don’t sell very well in Southeast
Asia and they don’t fit Kent State. It’s not something —
you can do on the crest of a big emotional wave and

expect it to keep going.

Council Proposes Ways
To End Campus Tensions

The American Counci! on
Education’s Special Commit-
Tensions
believes that’ campus unrest
can be reduced ‘or ended if

~ all members of the academ-

ic community are allowed
to participate in the admin-
istration of the institution.

In its report, ‘‘Campus
Tensions: Analysis and Rec-
ommendations,” the eight-
month-old committee re-
dicted that this year wojld
reach new heights in cam-
pus activism.

2 Sol M. Linowitz, former
ambassador to the Organi-
zation of American States,
headed the ‘committee as
chairman, The membership
was composed of students,

faculty members, adminis-
trators, trustees, and lay-
men.

The committee emphasiz-
ed the need for balance in

the powers of .the different
groups on campus and the
responsibility that must ac-
company the decisions made
by those involved.

An improvement in com-
munications channels appear-
ed ‘to be imperative, and
the committee suggested that
guidelines be offered to fa-
miliarize those who would
have new powers with ad-
ministrative procedures.

The development. of new
techniques to allow for great-
er changes to take! place in
higher education was alsg
stressed.

The report concluded: ‘'The
survival .of our system of
long-term contribution to so-
ciety depends upon rational-
ity and civility, shared con-
cern, and mutual respect
among the members of the
academic, community. Stu-
dents, faculty, administra-
tors, trustees—all must* rec-

ognize their necessary inter-
dependence.”

To support their findings,
the committee submitted 41
recommendations for cam-
pus leaders to offer “sugges-
tions for fostering the recon-
ciliation, trust, and condi-
tions, favorable to construc-
tive change on campus.”

Mr. Linowitz questioned
what he considered to be in-
flammatory actions taken by
such political figures as
Vice-President Agnew and
California Gov. Ronald Rea-
gan.

On the other hand, the
committee deplored the dis-
regard of some students for
peaceful and tesponsible dis-
sent: “Campus — violence
threatens some colleges and
universities with repressive
forces that could cripple
their freedom for * many
years to come.”
