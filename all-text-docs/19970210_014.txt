DAVIDSON, Feb. 3 - Two
games. Two heartbreaking losses.
That was the case Monday for
the women’s basketball team,
which ae its second contest in
, Tegan] three days to
Furman, 63-
On Feb. 1, the Lady Paladins
upended the Wildcats in overtime
in Greenville, S.C. Monday’s loss
pushed Davidson’s losing streak
to five games while Furman bol-
stered its league-leading confer-
ence record to 7-2.

“We haven’t given up,” said
coach John Filar. ““We just have to
find a way to eliminate some of the
defensive letdowns and key turn-
overs.”

The game was typical of many
defeats throughout the recent skid,
marked by those same letdowns
and crucial errors.

The team got off to a sluggish
start, shooting 34% from the floor

in the first half as the Paladins built
a 13-point advantage.

Davidson then made its trade-
mark rally. Led by. an improved
offensive attack and a ball-hawk-
ing defense (Furman shot just 26%
in the second half), the Wildcats
were able to cut into Furman’s
lead. A layup by freshman Jen
O’Brien with 4:49 to play gave
Davidson the lead.

But after a Katy Kamp layup,

which put Davidson up by three,
Furman went on a 14-2 run to
close the game. Davidson com-
mitted three crucial turnovers dur-
ing the stretch and the Paladins
shot 10-of-13 from the foul line.

The contest was. the fourth
straight against one of the league
leaders for the Wildcats.

“As competitive as the con-
ference is, it’s tough to play four
games against the top 3 teams,”
said Filar. “We haven’t evencome.
close to playing our best basket-
ball yet. We still have a long way
to go.”

prolific scorer
ever by the end
of the season.
Kirsch In the
App. St. game, Kirsch hurdled Sa-
rah Womack into the second slot on
Davidson’s all-time scoring chart.
Womack, coincidentally, was in-
ducted into the Athletic Hall of Fame
during halftime of the men’s game
Saturday afternoon in Belk. —

Kirsch currently has 1,258 ca-
reer points, leaving her just 42 points
shy of breaking Frankhouser’s stan-
dard of 1,299.

“T knew if I played consistently,
I'd probably break some records,”
Kirsch said earlier this week. “I
don’t really think about it that much,
but if it happens, it happens. It
would be really neat to be the all-
time leading scorer at Davidson Col-
lege.”

she did this weekend vs. the Moun-

reach the landmark away from home.

matchup with East Tenn. St.

No place like home

Saturday’s game was played
in front of 1,202 fans, the largest
crowd to see a women’s basketball
home outing this season.

With the victory, the Wildcats ‘

upped their conference record to 4-
5. They are now just one game
behind, Ga. Southern for that elu-
sive fourth-place spot in the league.
The top four teams host tourna-
ment quarterfinal contests Feb. 26.

“Our goal now,” said coach
John Filar, “is to battle for that
home court game.”

Twin killing

Considering their injury-prone
histories, seeing second-year twins
Jamie Brown and Kerry Brown
in uniform and on the court at the
same time has been a rarity for
Wildcat fans over the past two sea-

sons.
The Appalachian game was
therefore a long time coming.
Together, the duo hit 15-of-23
shots, recording 35 points, 10 re-
bounds, and eight assists in 55 min-
utes.

To swoosh or not to swoosh

The Nike-Reebok corporate
sponsorship battle manifested itself
this week among the women’s
hoopsters.

The team, having professed
allegiance to Planet Reebok all sea-
son, opted instead for Kingdom
Swoosh Monday night and donned
Nikes against Furman.

“T think we just complained
too much about the Reeboks,” ex-
plained Kirsch. “Ithink they finally ~
said, fine, we’ll get you the Nikes.
They just showed up in front of our
lockers before the Furman game.

“I didn’t even have to break
them in. I just wore them and it felt
like I had been wearing them for a
couple months.”
