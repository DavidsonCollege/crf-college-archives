' 16 gift committee meets,
cuts Suggestion list to five

By ANDREW LAMAS
Staff Writer

Members of the Senior.Class
Gift Committee met Monday
night to trim the large list of
gift suggestions.

‘“‘We narrowed the list from
forty suggestions down to
five.

“The suggestions are:fram-
ing college artwork, const-
ructing an outdoor classroom
and study facilities, purcha-
sing a microfilm printer for the
library, contributing to a low-
cost Davidson community
housing project, and estab-
lishing a gift fund to recognize
outstanding work by hourly-
paid employees on the David-
son college staff,’’ explained
Committee Chairman Martin
Eakes.

In hopes of selecting that
gift idea which is most prefer-
red by the senior class, mem-
bers of the gift committee will
attempt to contact every
member of the senior class
sometime this week.

“We plan to ask each senior
to select the three gift sug-
gestions he or she would most
like to see chosen as the senior
class gift for 1976,’’ remarked
Fakes.

Then, on Monday, February.
16, the Gift Committee will
meet to select, from among the
five suggestions, the senior
class gift. ;

“The preference of seniors
will be the major factor in
determining the selection of
the gift by our committee.

“‘Any senior who is not
contacted by a member of the
committee and who would like
to express a preference for one
of the gift suggestions, should
contact me at 892-3188 before
supper on Monday, February
16,” said Eakes.

The Committee Chairman
provides in the following para-
graphs some background in-
formation on each of the gifts.

College artwork: ‘‘Framing
part of the college’s now
unframed artwork would pre-
pare these pieces for future
display in the Fine Arts
Buiding and on other display
facilities if they become avail-
able. Also, it is important to
frame this artwork to protect
it from deterioration.’’

Outdoor classroom and
study facilities: ‘‘These facili-
ties would give student and
professors the opportunity to
conduct classes on beautiful,
sunny afternoons. This out-
door classroom would consist
of benches. and tables to
accomodate about thirty stu-
dents.”’

Microfilm printer: “Rang-
$2300 to $3000 in
prince, this microfilm printer
would allow members of the
l community to make

lege
printed copies of materials

ing from

col

from the college's microfilm
collection. The strength of this
idea rests in its direct useful-
ness to many students, pro-
fessors and others using the
library.”’

Munce discusses
dwindling housing

enrollment next September
will be approximately 1300.

Former SGA President
John W. Munce commented
on the decisions facing the
Board of Trustees at their
February meeting.

“As I see it, there are three
basic issues to be dealt with at
the February meeting. First,
the Trustees must decide if
they are going to freeze enroll-
ment for next year or not.

“Second, if they decide to
freeze enrollment, they must

decide at what level they want .

to freeze it.
“Finally, if they decide to
freeze enrollment, they must

decide what ratio of men to.

women they want,’’ said
Munce.
“Current Trustee policy dic-
tates that there be a minimum
of 1000 men enrolled at David-
son. Four full classes of wo-
_men is approximately 375,’’ he
said.
. “Tf the Trustees set an
enrollment ceiling at a point
below 1375, Davidson cannot
j have both 1000 men and four
full classes of women.
Depending on the enroll-
ment.ceiling set; the enroll-
ment of either men or women

will have to be cut.”’

Munce continued by saying
that the precedent for having
less than 1000 men was set
this year.

Nichols said tht there is
space for 1,041: students in the
furnished rooms of the seven
regular dorms plus the Carne-
gie Building, Grey. House,
‘Henderson House, Martin
Manor and North main
House, :

White commented that in
meetings \/ith College Busi-
ness Manager Robert A. Cur-
rie, the subject of student
housing had been discussed.

“Mr. Currie indicated to me
that there was some additional
college-owned housing that he
was planning to convert into
housing tor students,’’ said
White.

Residence hall Council
(RHC) President. Steven P.
Cuffe summarized the feelings
of the RHC on th issues of
enrollment and housing.

‘‘Since raising the enroll-
ment to 1300 or over would
effectively force people off-
campus who normally would
not want to be, we strongly

_ recommend that the Trustees

stabilize enrollment at ‘the
present level of 1250,’’ said
Cuffe.

Community housing pro-
ject: ‘‘This suggestion would
involve contributing money to
help .buy a plot of land,
provide building materials and
possibly volunteer labor to
help with the actual construct-
ion of a low-cost house for a
family in Davidson. The ap-
peal of this idea is that it
addresses a real need in the
Davidson community and may
enable students, faculty, and
the community to work toge-
ther on a common goal outside
of the academic setting.”’

Gift fund for hourly-paid
staff: ‘‘This fund would be
used to provide recognition
and a monetary expression. of
appreciation to those members
of the Davidson college staff
who deserve it but selfdom
receive it.”

Members of the Senior class
Gift Committee are: Martin
Eakes, Dave Francis, Dave
mayberry, Don Benson, John
Taylor, Bill Reed, Rick Roy-
lance, Bobby Mendenhall,
Hadley Wilson, and Cosby
Swanson.

Speakers present Title IX

By AMANDA HALL
Asst. Sports Editor

Jean Cany, a,lawyer with
Legal Aid in charlotte, and
Pat Edmundson, Professor of
Political science at Queens
College discussed Title IX of
the Education Amendments of
1972 with students in an Open
End Tuesday night.

The statute provides ‘‘no
person in the United States
shall, on the basis of sex, be
excluded from participation
in, be denied the benefits of, or
be subjected-to discrimination
under any education program
or activity receiving federal
financial assistance.” It is the
only all-encompassing federal
law that prohibits sex discri-
mination against students. -

Secondary schools. and ‘in-
stitutions of higher learning
have until 1978 to comply with
the regulations, while ele-
mentary schools must regu-
late their policies within the
year. ios ae

Che regulations for Title IX
can be categorized into five
general areas; general matters
concerning discrimination, ad-
missions, treatment of stu-
ents, employment, and pro-
cedures.

The general provisions set
up procedures institutions
must follow to comply with
the statute. The schools must
evaluate their policies to see if
they do discriminate and take
whatever steps are needed to
end this. An investigatory
officer must be hired by the
school to evaluate the discri-
mination, , arenas

These steps must be kept on

Scholarship monies must be
pooled and students must be
selected for financial aid in a
non-discriminatory way. Sin-
gle-sex scholarships (Rhodes
Scholarships) may be kept
if equal monies and similar
opportunities are provided
for the other sex. Athle-
tic scholarships may be given
if both sexes are given reason-
able opportunities for scholar-

’ ships.

Both sexes must be given be
given comparable housing
facilities and courses. Discri-
minatory dress or conduct
regulations cannot be made.

In athletics both sexes must

—unities in both team participa-

tion and monies. Separate
teams are allowed in contact,
sports, and ability is used as
the determinate for non-con-
tact teams.:

Employment must not be

recruitment, advertising or
actual hiring,

Violations of Title IX are to
be reported to the Department

- of Health, Education and Wel-

 fare.:

Cary and Edmundson found
three “‘mushy”’ areas. in Title
IX; the employment of an
investigatory officer, the term
‘comparable’ in the athletic
regulation, and the enforce-
ment procedures. }

According to Edmondson, a
school chooses its investiga-
tory officer, and so can hire
someone who will overlook
discriminatory policies and
practices. :

“Comparable” has. not been
defined by the courts, so a
complaint based on the athle-
tic provision could prove too
weak to be rectified in the
courts,
