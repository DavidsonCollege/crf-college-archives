CHRISTOPHER RYAN SCHMADER
| CLASS OF 2004

So the years spin by and |
_now the boy is twenty,

Though his dreams have

lost some grandeur coming true.

They'll be new dreams,

maybe better dreams and plenty

Before the last revolving

year is through.
“The Circle Game”- Joni Mitchell

We love you Chris,
and are always pround
of the boy you were
and the man you have become.
