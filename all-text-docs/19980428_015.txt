A4-3 conference record was good
enough for a #3 seed for the women’s
tennis team going into the conference
tournament. Though one place behind
Chattanooga in the conference stand-
ings,
tohte
8] Wild-
cats re-
ceived
the #3
seed
and
avoided
a first-
round meeting with conference -leader
Georgia Southern..

This paired the ‘Cats up against
#6 UNC-Greensboro. The Spartans,
who finished .500 in conference play

Furman
lldcats

in the regular season, upset Davidson 6-
3 in March. The team went into the
tournament knowing that the first round

would be more than a formality.

They were right. The teams played
a nine point format, with one point
given to the winner of each doubles

match. The ‘Cats jumped out to an
early lead with singles victories from

Dana Casner, Kristen Koenig, and

Amber Bradford.

The Spartans were not out yet.
They took the last two of the last three
singles spots to make the score 4-2.

UNCG proceeded to give the ‘Cats

a good scare by winning the #2 and #3

doubles matches to even the score at
four a piece. The match and the right to
move onto the semifinals hinged on the
#1 singles match.

Casner and Koenig, who finished
the regular season 7-8 in doubles play,
fought the Spartans’ doubles team in a

tense match and went on to
win the match 86. This gave
Davidson the win and the
right to play the winner of
Furman and Wofford. SINGLES

finishing 5-7, 7-6,
6-4. Koenig’s was
much shorter. After a 1-6 loss in the
first set, she was totally in control,
giving up a combined four games in
the last two sets.

Casner lost the first set of her match
in three tie-breakers, and was not able
to rebound. Her match finished 7-5,
6-1 in favor of Furman’s Meredith
Moore, who went on to be named
SoCon Freshman-of-the-Year in ad-
dition to earning All-Conference team
honors.

In addition to their win at #1, the
Paladins swept the last three singles
spots to give them four points in the
match. That clinched a victory for
Furman, and the doubles matches were
not completed.

The surprise of the tournament was
UT-Chattanooga, who defeated #1
seed Georgia Southern 5-2 in the semi-
finals. Georgia Southern had fin-
ished the regular season with a per-
fect conference mark and had won all
but two matches by at least three
points. ©

Furman went on to the finals to de-
feat Cinderella-story UT-Chattanooga
by a score of 4-1. Furman’s Moore
was named to the All-Conference
team, while her: teammate Emelie
Isaksson earned Tournament MVP
honors. Despite their semifinal loss,
two players made the All-Conference
singles team, and two of the three All-
Conference doubles teams were from
Georgia Southern as well.

Dana Casner received her third All-
Conference selection in as many sea-
sons as a Wildcat. Also receiving a
