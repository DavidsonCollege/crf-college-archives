And another game ends in a scoreless tie!
We wonder if this is getting to be a habit of
the Wildcats. One more score like the last two
games and we'd be willing to resort to tag
football, setting a maximum time limit of five

minutes, and giving the decision to the team
gaining the most ground.

Just as we suspected, the flying fleet from
Erskine pulled a fast one and upset the dope
bucket—not such an upset at that, for the Se-
ceders had previously held the strong Citadel
team to a 12-6 score. The obvious conclusion
drawn from the Davidson-Erskine game would
either be that Erskine was very much under-
rated, or that the ’Cats were experiencing the
let-down frequently resulting from a previous
hard engagement, this being in the case ef Da-
vidson, the Duke game.

ee

It was a tough game, and to some extent
monotonous, because of the unusual defensive
strength of both teams and the corresponding
lack of offensive in both the ’Cat and Erskine
machines. The ‘Cats possibly had a slight edge
as regards offensive, a large part of the game
being played in Erskine territory. Four possible
chances they had to score, each time within the
Erskine 20-yard stripe, but a great Erskine line
refused to open, and the ball went over each
time, Erskine immediately punting out of dan-
ger.

This fellow Gettys, in our. opinion, is one of
the best defensive ends on any team Davidson
has encountered this year. Time and again he
smashed through to halt the Wildcat backfield
before it could even get started, frequently down-
ing the ball carrier in his tracks. He was truly
a burr in the Wildcat’s paw Saturday.

Peabody for the Wildcats handled his punts
nicely, running them back for extra yardage at,
times, but usually being halted before he could
get going. King’s 20-yard run and his catch
of a 20-yard pass furnished the only thrills of
the afternoon, although Pearce and Flinn made
several nice gains. McQueen possibly had the
edge on Gettys in their short punting duel.

His first opportunity of playing for any length

time since his recent injury, Buck Mills
played a very nice game. His forward passes
were long and accurate, and he got off several
long punts. We believe we should see more of
Buck than we have recently.

of

The Wildcat line as a whole played very
well, with especial mention going to Whitfield
and Johnson.

The Freshmen got the tables turned on them

State last Saturday and found themselyes
on the short end of a 14-7 score. Frequent
fumbling and poor tackling were largely re-
sponsible, as well as a small degree of over-
confidence. The Fresh as a whole, however,
played well, and the game was an interesting
one, filled with thrills.

by

This Saturday the ’Cats lock horns with the
Cadets of V. M. I., and if comparative scores
mean anything, Davidson will once more regain
her position as under-dog. This same Erskine
team which tied Davidson Saturday was beaten
by Citadel, «12-6, who in turn was tied by
V. M. I., 13-13. These Virginians have a strong
team, backed by a wonderful spirit, and the
Wildcats know what to look for—a good scrap.

Aesthetic Ed’s predictions for the coming Sat-
urday include:

Valparaiso over Culver.

Wilburforce over Moravian.

Mount St. Mary’s over Auguston.

Tuskegee Institute over Brigham Young.

“KITTENS

Light Kittens Hold Heavy Opponents
For One Half, But Weight Finally
Wins

In a game replete with thrills from start to
finish, the Davidson Wildkittens bowed to the
Freshmen from North Carolina State, 14-7.

The defeat was in no way ignominous. The
Kittens were outweighed approximately twelve
»ounds to the man, and their opponents pos-
sessed rare speed and stamina plus a great re-
serve strength. The State machine used a sys-
tem of hard, straight, bruising football, which
was successful due to their tremendous weight
advantage. By this terrific line attack, State
punctured through into Davidson territory sev-
eral times during the fracas, but were repulsed
by the scrappy Kitten forwards. Twice, how-
ever, the Wolf Cubs reached the “promised
land” just beyond Davidson's goal line via the

aerial route after sustained drives. The fateful |

passers were McAdams to Riddin in the second
quarter and McAdamis to Rex, who bucked the
first extra point and Ray on an end run con-
verted the second. The lone Davidson tally was
the natural consequences of a beautiful pass,
MacKorell to Morris, crashed center forthe
seventh point.

So far as figures go, the Kittens were decisive-
ly outplayed. On the offense; the Felines netted
only six first downs to State’s eighteen; > but
what can we do about that? When a State
‘ouchdown seemed an absolute certainty, those
Kittens reared up their hind legs © and
knocked it for a loop. Only on those miserable
fluke passes was State able to score,

on

On defense and in the line, Captain Potter
shone like a Madza lamp. After the first quar-
ter when State realized what a dose of venom
they were playing against in the person of
Captain Potter, the State quarterback wisely
chose to fun his plays elsewhere.

One of the most potent factors in holding
the State scoring down was the excellent punt-
‘ng of Morgan, the stellar Kitten left end. Fre-
quently his talented toe arched the spheroid
‘n beautiful spirals out of Davidson territory,
to save his cause once again. Two of his boots
covered 55 yards apiece, and another traveled
1 bit over 60.

On the whole the game was well played
throughout; few fumbles, few times out, and
two greet grid machines battling it out and with
the largér, more experienced, and luckier’team
eventually emerging the victor after a terrific
truggle.

Before the Duke game at Davidson, Jake
Wade, sports editor of The Charlotte Ob-
server, had many nice things to say about
the Wildcats, but it is summed up in these
apt words, “Davidson, in its leanest ~years,
makes it interesting for its Big Five oppo-
nents. Davidson may make it extremely in-
teresting for Duke Saturday.”

BY 14-7 SCORE

P. J.C. Added to

Freshmen Schedule

Davidson, N. C., Oct. 27—Presby-
terian Junior College at Maxton has
been added to the schedu'e of the
Davidson College freshmen, according
to an announcement made here by
Coach Laird, mentor of the Wi!dkit-
tens. The game with the e'even from
down East will be played at Davidson
on November 6th. This new contest
has been substituted for the game
with the Asheville School for Boys,
which was carded for Asheville next
Friday afternoon, but which was can-
celled at the request of authorities at
the mountain resort institution. Sche-
duling a game with Presbyterian Jun-
ior College for the local field will give
Davidson College students an opportu-
nity to see the Wildkittens in action
once again this year. According to the
fur announcement, the remaining
mee would be played on for-
eign. territory, but the cancellation
changed this. Besides the junior col-
lege eleven, others yet to be met by
the Davidson yearlings are the Duke
Freshmen and the Oak Ridge Military
Institute.

Blue Devils Lead Race

Duke's dashing Blue Devils and Captain Kid
Brewer were leaders of Big Five football teams
and leaders over the week-end, despite the bril-

Jliant showing of Carolina’s Tar Heels against

the strong Tennessee team.

Captain Kid Brewer took it upon himself to
lefeat the Wake Forest Demon Deaks last Fri-
lay and jumped far into the lead in individual
scoring with a grand total of 50 points. His
1earest opponent is Rip Slusser, of Carolina,
vho hasn't scored since the first game of the
eason—neither has Carolina.

So by the showing and standing of the pres-
ent Big Five situation, it looks like another dog
fight between Carolina’s Tar Heels and Wal-
lace Wade's first Duke team for the states title
again this year, Duke won the fight last year by
virtue of their scoreless tie with Carolina after
the Tar the
under the fight of litthe Davidson.

pponents strain every effort to win.
