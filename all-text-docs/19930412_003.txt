Phi Beta Kappa Inducts New Members from the Class of '93

By Sally Stone

The foremost academic
achievers of Davidson’s senior
class were inducted to the fore-
most honor society, Phi Beta
Kappa, Wednesday, April 7.

39 men and women from the
class of 1993 were honored for
their top academic performance in
a dinner banquet following a pri-
vate installation ceremony in Phi
Hall.

Phi Beta Kappais the premier
national collegiate honor society,
founded on December 5, 1776.
Davidson’s chapter, the gamma
order, was established on March 1,
1923. Following tradition, this
year’s members were elected on
the anniversary of Davidson’s
founding.

Davidson faculty members
who are members of their respec-
tivecolleges’ Phi Beta Kappachap-
ters also participated in the night’s
ceremonies.

Closing the evening’s banquet
was a view on life presented by
Professor Ward Churchill, a native
American teacher, writer, and

critic, He currently serves on the
faculty of University of Colorado
at Boulder. Churchill spoke on the
year 501, the period of time be-
tween Columbus’s arrival and to-
day.

Drawing from a 1973 com-
mencement address delivered at
Stanford University by Kurt
Vonnegut, Churchill reflected on
American sentiment. While
Vonnegut pessimistically predicted
a destructive future, the past three
years have turned Dr. Churchill’s
attitude toward optimism.

After suffering through the
destructive mindset prevalent in
the 1970’s and 1980’s, the 1990's
bring an “openness to new ideas”
with a “willingness to challenge,
discuss, and think.” This. means,
Churchill theorized, that “there’s
been a fundamental shift . . . in
consciousness” carrying potential,
hope, and possibility with it.

Inclosing, Dr. Churchill noted
the symbolic entry into 1993 as the
“new cycle”. following 500 years
of predatory natures and confused
mindsets.

Campus Prepares for "Day at the Lake"

By Mandy Curtis

A “Day at the Lake,” spon-
sored by the houses of Patterson
Court, the SGA, the Union Board,
and the Environmental Action
Committee, is scheduled for Fri-
day, April 16. This all-campus
party, centered around the theme
of environmental awareness, will
start at 12:30 p.m. directly after
Convocation. Free lunches, ac-
tivities, music, and celebration will
all be a part of the occasion.

The “Day at the Lake” is an
event designed by the different
organizations on campus to bring

Recreating the Crucifixion ...

On Thursday, April 8, several students independently

organized a re-enactment of the crucifixion to help
participants relate to Jesus’ predicament. The wooden cross
remained tied to the tree in front of Chambers until Easter.

“are bound to get stopped up sooner
or later.” He further said that it is
normal for pipes to get backed up
and that the only way to stop this .
from happening would be for
“people to stop using the bath-
room.”

To deter this situation, main-
tenance cleans out the pipes with a
rod-sewer machine every summer.
The machine cuts through the so-
lidified grease that is blocking pas-
sage through the pipes.

In regard to the smell, Archer
and Grounds Superintendent
George Morris explained that it is
a result of the excess of rain we
have received this spring. The
stagnant water from the rain causes
“sour soil.” Due to over-satura-
tion, the organic material in the
soil gives off a “not so pleasant
smell.” Morris stated, “This may
be what we’re smelling.”

the school together. PCC presi-
dent Julie Petty and Union Board
president Merrill Earnest came up
with idea for the all-campus party
and organized much of the plan-
ning. According to Petty, she and
Earnest wanted to plan something
for the entire campus so thatevery-
one could come together in a posi-
tive social atmosphere.

Because Friday classes after
9:30 a.m. have been canceled for
Convocation, it is a perfect time,
according to Petty. As part of the
agreement with the College to have
the event, the PCC, the SGA, and
the Union Board encourage every-
one to attend Convocation first.

According to Patterson Court
Advisor Kurt Holmes, the lake
campus party will be a day for
everyone to interact together, much
like the Lunar Luau of the fall and
Saturday of Spring Frolics. By
pooling resources together from
many different organizations on
campus, the event will be able to
provide a social opportunity for .
everyone, according to Holmes.

Petty explained that the mo-
tive behind this activity is to focus
onthe positive aspects of Davidson

as a college and community. “We
focus’on the negative so much;
now we want to dosomething posi-
tive and together for all of the
groups on campus,” stated Petty.
SGA president Alden Smith
hopes that the lake campus party
will provide a good time for every-
one oncampus. Mostimportantly,
he would like this event to “bring
back a feeling of togetherness to
the Davidson College social life.”
Smith said, “Often we are criti-
cized for not providing acommon
experience where everyone feels
welcome.” Smith hopes that the
event will help bring a sense ot
solidarity back to the campus.
Faculty are also invited to the
“Day atthe Lake.” Petty explained
that there are few opportunities for
the faculty to interact with the stu-
dents in environments other than
the classroom. Petty said that it
will be “a good opportunity for
[the faculty] to come out” and see
one of the positive sides of the
Davidson social atmosphere> In
discussing plans with President
Kuykendall, Petty commented that
