Freshmen survive onslaught of orientation activities

You get tired of Love Auditorium
after you’ve gone in there so many
times,’’ said Ed Trumbull.

But even Trumbull liked Chalmers
Davidson’s talk on college history.
“‘To sit there and listen to the guy
talk about the college and the past
and all the little stories about the
school was fascinating. That man
knows so much about this school,” he
said.

Orientation changed some fresh-
men’s views on the college. ‘‘I
expected a bunch of preppy guys
coming in talking about how much
their dads make. It wasn’t that way.
There’s a pretty good variety of
people here, about as much variety as
you could expect,’’ said James Bas-
kin.

And if orientation didn’t change
others’ views, it at least helped them
to get adjusted. ‘‘We weren’t as
intimidated by the college because
orientation made us feel important.
Instead of coming in with everybody
else and feeling that we were on the
bottom, we were the ones who got all

the attention. Th-* “slps, a let:
psychologically,” said Charles Lue-

cker.

Baskin added, ‘‘Because of orienta-
tion I feel like I know everything I
could know about the college by this
time. If I can just learn to take notes
and get some study habits down, I
think I can be confident.”

this year’s freshman class. ‘They're
more confident. At least the girls
seem more confident. I’ve only seen
them in social situations but I’ve
noticed more girls walking to parties
by themselves. It’s not the usual hall
mass,’’ she said.

Anne Stanback screed that_fresh-
man girls were confident, but added,

“After going to classes I don’t feel as
confident as I did before.”

“I do feel at home. It’s all very
familiar now. But confident? I'll have
to wait awhile before I get in the
routine. It’s just me that’s not
confident. Everything else around
here is confident end you pick it up,”’
said Nan Zimmerman. ,
