Women's Lacrosse Wins Big in Weekend Invitational

By Mandy Curtis

The women’s lacrosse team was
victorious over five different teams,
winning all seven of the games they
played this weekend in their invita-
tional tournament hosted here at
’ Davidson. After a round-robin on
Saturday with play-offs and a final
game on Sunday, the Cats swept the
tournament.

Davidson first played George
Mason University, defeating the
team by a score of 16-1. Immedi-
ately after, the Cats upset Eastern
Carolina University with a score of
11-1.

For the highlight of the after-
noon, the Wildcats met up against

Duke and beat them 14-4. Inthis
game, Megan Snyder scored five
goals, Nancy Hilles scored four,
and Jenny Plowright scored two.
Goal keeper, Jen Lake made‘ten
saves,

For the third time of the sea-
son, the Cats beat Greensboro
College 8-3. It was getting late
and the players were getting tired
when they played NC State; how-
ever, the Cats won again by a
score of 8-2.

After Saturday, the teams
were ranked, with Davidson on
top. Play-offs and finals fol-
lowed on Sunday. Because
Greensboro beat NC State, the

Cats played their fourth and final
game against Greensboro, defeat-
ing them 8-2.

This sixth win of the tourna-
mentbrought the women’s lacrosse
team to the final game against
Duke. According to Coach Betsy
Brown, Duke was obviously the
strongest of the teams invited for
the weekend, despite their club sta-
tus. For the final game, the Cats
had to learn and execute five new
plays because Duke had watched
and copied much of what Davidson
had done on Saturday. ae

Although the score was close
at the half with Davidson only up
by two goals, the Cats won the

game 9-2. Snyder scored four
goals, Plowright scored three, and
Hilles scored one. Brown said that
Duke “challenged us in both
games” and thatthe entire team did
a “great job. . . I’m so impressed
with them.”

Three key players for the Cats
this weekend were Snyder,
Plowright, and Hilles. Snyder at
first home had been out for two
weeks after giving bone marrow
but played extremely well with 18
goals and five assists. Plowright at
third home scored 12 goals with 16
assists. Hilles atattack wing scored
nine goals.

According to Brown,

Plowright, a senior and captain for
the past two years, has brought the
program where it is today having
much experience as a skillful and
supportive player and encourag-
ing many to either play or stick
with the sport.

Plowright plays center on
draws, which she most often wins,
and then moves tothird home where
she plays strong defense and of-
fense. “Plow is an incredible
player. She’s one of a kind and
will surely be missed next year.
I’ll never come across another Jen-

‘nifer Plowright,” said Brown. The

team plays Lynchburg College and
Sweetbriar away this weekend.

Men's Track
Finishing
Strong to
Prepare for
Championship
By Peter Hurtado
In their final meet before the

Southern Conference Champion-
ships, the men’s track and field team

showed that they have the ability to «

improve upon last year’s 11-point
showing, posting solid performances
at the Gamecock Invitational in Co-
lumbia, SC. fae
Seniors Dave Kerns (8:48) and
Tan Stewart (8:49) fell just shy of
breaking the ten year old 3,000m

» school record of 8:45.

Kerns and Stewart meta fierce
headwind and were forced to lead
much of the race. Look for Kerns to
capture the steeplechase school
record at the conference meet, while
Stewart chases after points in the
10,000m and 5,000m.

Duncan Spears, though falter-
ing atthe final hurdle, still managed
an excellent 400m hurdle effort of
55.5. Spears, the returning confer-
ence champion in that event, is
ranked fourth in the conference and
should make All-Conference with a
great effort.

Brandon Williams, joining the
team for the final two outings, made
‘a great impression while placing
fourth overall with a high jump of
6’6". This height would have won
last year’s conference meet. -

In the middle distance corps,
Peter Hurtado and Erik McMichael
will chase the field in the 1,500m at
the conference meet; both are ranked
around tenth or eleventh. Joe Beach
. and Mike Grant will compete in per-
haps the strongest field of any event
at the conference meet, the 800m
Tun. Inthe weight events, Rob King
threw his best Hammer distance of
the season, while Bo Bartholomew
topped his best in the shot put.

Coach Gary Andrew is confi-
dent about the team’s chances to
score and “even win a couple con-
ference championships.” The big
meet is May 1 at Appalachian State.

ATTENTION:.
The Tennis Parking Lot Must
Be Cleared Again this Weekend
for the Men's Tournament

By Chris Hood

The fact that Katie
Hammond arrived at Davidson
as a freshman two years ago
eager to play for the golf team is
not surprising. That she did so
knowing that Davidson has no
women’s team-is.

Astheonly woman oncam-
pus expressing public interest in
playing competitive golf, the
junior from Beachwood, Ohio,
began her Davidson golf career”
by attempting tomakethemen’s
team. Unable to qualify, she has
turned to playing in women’s
tournaments as an individual.

Hammond was attracted to
Davidson by her brother, Joe, a
1991 graduate, and the College’s
academic reputation. She says
the lack of a women’s golf team
was nota deterrent “because my
first priority was academics.”

She spoke with Davidson
golf coach Gordon Mietz before
her freshman year to see if she
would be permitted to try out for
the men’s team. . Because
Davidson does not have a
women’s golf team, NCAA
guidelines permit such endeav-
ors. Though she has tried to gain
support among students for a
women’s club team, the interest
is lacking.

Thus far, she has been un-
able to qualify for the men’s
team. “She’s anexcellent golfer
and a legitimate eight handicap
golfer,” Mietzexplained. “Ihave
toallay herhigherscoresat River
Run (Davidson’s home course)

to the long distance playing from
the championship tees.” Hammond
plays from the same tees as the
men in qualifying rounds, which
make the course significantly
longer than women’s courses.

Her next step, was to look into
playing in women’s tournaments,
representing Davidson as an indi-
vidual; Mietz aided in her search
for such events. She competed in
the Winthrop Individual in Febru-
ary and at the Fighting Campbell
Classic in early March. In each
event, she was the only competitor
playing withoutateam. Hammond
also played this weekend in a 54-
hole event hosted by UNC
Wilmington.

“I’ve gotten really positive
responses,” Hammond said, nam-
ing Winthrop coach Eddie Weldon

as being particularly supportive. .

“The womenall want to know what
it’s like being the only player fora
school. It works well for me, too,
because it’s more fun to compete
against women than men.”

Playing asa one-woman team
is no great adjustment for
Hammond. Her high school,
Hathaway Brown School for Girls,
did not offer a golf program;
Hammond played as an individual.
Asa senior, she placed third in the
state tournament.

Though she practices nearly
every day in nearby Mooresville
and has playing privileges at River
Run, Hammond spends the most
time on her game during the sum-
mer, when she plays in numerous
Cleveland-area tournaments. Last

summer, she captured the second
flight championship in the Ohio
Women’s Amateur, won the con-
solation championship flight of the
Cleveland Women’s Districts.and
was the Canterbury Golf Club
women’s champion.

Hammond admits that play-
ing college golf alone is particu-
larly difficult. “It’s tough not hav-
ing a team and the encouragement
of other players,” she explained,
“and now I’m not home with my

parents like I was in high school.”

Mietz remains impressed
with Hammond’s abilities and is
encouraged about her prospects
in women’s events. “She has a
very well-balanced game. Katie
is a good shotmaker and is very
long with her irons. She’s very
competitive with other women
golfers.” Hammond has the ad-
vantage of having competed indi-
vidually throughout her high
school career.

ond round of play did not go as
well for the Wildcats.

rah Heer were all upset in straight
sets. “We took some unexpected
hits in the 2nd round of singles and
hope to regroup and make up
ground in doubles,” said Coach
Price. The doubles teams of Ruth
and Grooms, and Beahm and
Wilcox both advanced to the sec-
ond round.

On Sunday, Davidson aimed
to pass ETSU for 2nd place. In

to players from Furman.

while #2 Ruth and Grooms fell to
Furman in the championship
match. Inthe closestdoubles match
of the weekend, #3 Wilcox and

by one point over ETSU. Players
and Coach Price were pleased with
the finish, as well as the successful
year Davidson had in its 1st year
back in Southern Conference play.
