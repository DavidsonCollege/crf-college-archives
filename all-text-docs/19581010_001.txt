When asked by members of
the DAVIDSONIAN staff if he
would try to characterize gen-
erally the Davidson Curriculum.
and also the curriculum with
regard to other prominent
schools such as Haverford and
Swarthmore, Dr. Johnston re-
plied. “We shouldn't ever be
satisfied with the total program

ing out of the scheduled four.
Professor G. W. Crawford, Dr.
J. M. Bevan, Dr. R. R. Bernard,
and Dr. J. H. Ostwalt are the
four faculty members.

The purpose of the board is
to recommend to the Depart-
ment of the Army branch as-
signments for each of the MS
IV cadets. Each cadet lists five
branches in the order of his
preference. He is required, if
physically able, to include three
combat arms in his list of five,
such as Infantry, Artillery, Ar-
mor.

THREE FACTORS

The board's duty is to even
out preferences as much as pes-
sible. Its recommendation is the
result of three factors. The first
factor is the cadet's preference,
and the second factor is the
eadet’s curriculum and course
of study at Davidson. For in-
stance, a man majoring in Bus!-
ness Administration would be
most suited for the Quarter-
master Corps; a language or li-

J. W. Mitchell of the ROTC De-
partment emphasized that “the
board’s recommendation is not
final by any means. The final
decision as to assignment rests
with the Department of the
Army and its need for men in
the various branches,”

INTERVIEWS

The interviews are usually
ten to fifteen minutes in length.
During this time, the board
verifies the cadet’s choices, dis-
cusses his major and minor sub-
jects, and inquires about his fu-
ture plans, The cadet is then

[asked why he listed the pref-

erences he did.

One meeting has been held.
Three more sessions are ,sched-
uled on October 10, 13, and 15.
The board's recommendations
are to be sent to the Depart-
ment of the Army by the 25th
of October. Captain Mitchell
added that ‘“‘we expect to hear
the final assignments from the
Department around the first of
February.”

After-Dance Parties
Face Serious Crisis

After-dance fraternity parties during Homecoming
this year are expected to be noticeably different from

those in former years, primarily due to the bad reputa-

tion Davidson has incurred

because of the conduct dis-

played at some of these parties Joint fraternity parties,
in particular, were voted out by the fraternity presidents

last spring.

Last spring. several commit-,
tees met io discuss this matter:
in detafl. The Board of Trus-
tees. in order to look into the|
matter more thocvughty before!
coming to any decisions, sot up!
a Faculty-Trustee Committee |
made up of three ‘trustees, Mr |
Frank Hall of Belmont, chair-
man: Mr. George King. of Bris-
tol, Tennessee: and Mr. Harold
McKeithen of Winston Salem:
four members of the faculty.
Mr. D. G. Martin, Dr. McGavock,
Dr. Pietenpol, and Dean Bailey:
and three members of the stu-
dent body, John Kuykendall,
Don Carmichacl, and Ross
Smyth.

At the same time the Fratern-
ity Presidents Laurens Walker.
Neil Padgett, Craig Wall. Dick
Hodel, Jim Yarbrough, Gene
Long, Sam Smith. Joe Cline,
Walter O'Briant, Sam Plyler,
and Roy Gilbert. under Chair-
man Manfred Emmrich. met
with the Faculty Fraternity
Committee of Chairman Dr.
McGavock, Dr. Davidson, Dr.
Goldiere, Dr. Maloney, and Dr.
Workman. The _ Presidents
gained permission from the
Committee to try to work out
a way themselves of making the
parties more acceptable and
orderly.

The trustees were then in-
formed of this. plan, and they
agreed that the Fraternities
should be given a chance to
work it out themselves. The
pledge which previously read:

“1 attended the party de- |

scribed above during the
hours indicated. To the best
of my knowledge and be-
fief, the party was con-
ductod in a manner ac-
ceptable to the standards
of gentlemanly conduct
end there was no profane
or abusive language, -inde-
cent dress or gestures, con-
duct unbecoming a lady's
escort, or any other simil-
arly gross ungentlemanly
conduct on the part of the
students present.

“My fraternity and {| un-
derstand that the signing
of this statement in no way
abrogates the faculty rule,
which states: ‘A student
will ordinarily bo suspend-
ed if he is found guilty
of drinking, possessing or
being under the influence
of alcoholic beverage while
within the town limits of
Davidson or while attend-
ing any off-campus event
sponsored entirely or in
part by Davidson College.’ ”

It was signed: by the Fra-
ternity President and two other
officers, but was then revised in
the addition of a clause stating
that there was no time during
the party when at least one of
the officers was not present.

Manfred Emmrich said con-
cerning the pledge, “We are
not’ against parties, we're for
them. This restriction we're
putting on parties is not going

alumni about the current events

represent Davidson at many
alumni meetings away from the
college.

Although Horton has been at
Davidson in his new capacity
for only a few days, he says that
he can already feel “the spirit

as a student.

He invites all students to
“visit his office and learn how
