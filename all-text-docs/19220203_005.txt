THE PEANUT PARCHER

Tally Elliott wired home last week:
“Dear Father, am on the hog; please
send me ten.”
The reply came back: |
“Dear Son, “no money; ride the hog
home.”
Speaking of Mr. Mozee reminds us
that
Bill had a bill-board
And also had a board-bill;
The board-bill bored Bill,
So he sold the bill-board,
Paid his board-bill,
And then it no longer bored Bill!

From A Faint Blue Glow

To Modern Miracles

Fae saw it first-—a mere shadow of blue light streaking across the
terminals inside an imperfect electric lamp. This “leak” of elec-
tric current, an obstacle to lamp perfection, was soon banished by
removing more air from the bulbs.

* But the ghostly light, and its mysterious disappearance in a high
vacuum remained unexplained for years.

Then J. J. Thomson established the electron theory on the trans-
mission of electricity in a partial vacuum—and the blue light was

understood.

In a very high vacuum, however, the light and appar-

ently the currents that caused it disappeared.

One.day, however, a scientist in the Research Laboratories of the
General Electric Company proved that a current could be made to pass
through the highest possible vacuum, and could be varied according to
But the phantom light had vanished.

Here was a new and definite phenomenon—a basis for further re-

fixed laws.

search.

Immediately, scientists began a series of experiments with far reach-

ing practical results. A new type of X-ray tube, known as the Coolidge
tube, soon gave a great impetus to the art of surgery. The Kenotron
and Pliotron, followed in quick succession by the Dynatron and Mag-
netron, made possible long distance radio telephony and revolutionized
radio telegraphy. And the usefulness of the “tron” family has only

begun.

The troublesome little blue glow was banished nearly forty years
ago. But for scientific research, it would have been forgotten. Yet
there is hardly a man, woman or child in the country today whose
life has not been benefited, directly or indirectly, by the results of
the scientific investigations that followed. :

Thus it is that persistent organized research gives man new tools,
makes available forces that otherwise might remain unknown for
centuries.
