THE DAVIDSONIAN

The St

By Juvia PHiLport

As the year jumps off to a fast and furious
start, that familiar air of anxiety begins to show its
* face. How many of us have felt an undefined
‘sadness that starts like a seed behind the belly
button and spreads throughout the entire body? If
you haven't, then please send in the antidote;
otherwise, you are not alone. Depression can be
one of the most common illnesses on a stressful
campus like Davidson’s, yet it is also one of the
trickier ones tocure. Therefore, I would like for us
asacampus to nip this sickness in the bud while we
still have a new year and a fresh start. To help. I
have compiled four thoughts on how to decrease
anxiety and increase joy.

@ Look at the world with the responsibility and
experience of an adult as well as the wonder and
innocence of a child.

Remember when you were littke how the
world cradled you instead of swallowing you up?
The colors were more brilliant and the emotions
were more raw. As we get older, we replace that
perspective with mature worries when we should
be holding onto to it for dear life. As humans, our
childhood wonder and need for care is everpresent

— it simply gets repressed as time goes by. Little
kids don’t ignore their instincts and neither should
adults. Don’t try to take care of everything by
yourself when there are loving people who want to
help you through hard times. On that note, it
wouldn't be a good idea for a five-year-old to
drown sorrows with twenty beers, so it is not a
good idea for students either. Try drowning your
sorrows with a huge water gun fight. It is much
more exhilarating and better for you.

® Turn dissatisfaction into positive dissatisfac-
tion.
We are all so lucky to be here at Davidson;

therefore we need to take our frustrations with a
grain of salt. Yes, there will be times where we are
not happy with the way the day treats us, but it is
important to keep negativity in perspective. As
trite as it may sound, most people do not have the
opportunity to be where we are. Think of disap-
pointment as the jumping off point for improve-
ment rather than the depths of despair.

® Take off the mask and feed your soul.

Sometimes at a school like Davidson it is
easy to lose oneself. At first glance you see a
school of high achievers with a great need to relax
and cut loose. While going out partying can be a
good way to do this- don’t feel it is your only
option. Everyone needs a close group of friends to
help cut down on that lonely feeling which some-
‘times catches us all. Sometimes the concerns that
go with partying can cause more stress when the
weekend should bring relaxation. Have anice talk
over dinner once in a while; balance is a good
thing.

My fourth and final thought is actually stolen
from the marvelous book “Don’t Sweat the Small
Stuff. ..and it’s all small stuff” by Richard Carlson,
Ph.D:

@ Remind yourself that when you die your “In
Basket” won’t be empty.
Carlson says: “Regardless of who you are or

what you do, remember that, nothing is more”

important than your own sense of happiness and
_ inner peace and that of your loved ones. If you're
obsessed with getting everything done, you'llnever
have a sense of well being! Very little in our work
lives truly falls into the emergency category. Ifyou
stay focused on your work, it will all get done in
due time.”
So with that in mind I hope everyone has a
great second week of school. Continuously re-
mind yourself to laugh more joyously, for the best

kinds of days are those filled with a love for life.

exam time or just for fun!
