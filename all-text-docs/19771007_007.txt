Past Homecomings : - times change

In the. spirit of Homecoming nos-
talgia, The Davidsonian delves into
its archives to view the college at the
Homecoming of 1951 and 1966.

1951

Homecoming ’51 marked the end of
Davidson's President John R. Cun-
ningham’s ‘‘Decade of Destiny’’.
Cunningham was honored for the
decisive role which he had played as
president during the era surrounding
WW II.

The influence of the Korean War
could be felt as students worried
about the draft and Community Chest
solicited donations to defeat Com-
munism.

Davidson forgot the gloomy world
situation for a weekend, though, as it
moved into a festive homecoming.
Jerome Hines, Metropolitan Opera
bass, kicked things off Friday night.

Then Elliott Lawrence, a popular

pianist, and his orchestra moved in
for a formal dance at the Johnston
Gym.

The traditional barbecue at 1 pm on
Saturday brought in over 1000 peo-
ple. At 2 pm, the Wildcats faced the

Blue Hose of Presbyterian College
and were soundly defeated.

Three bands—the traditional Len-
oir High School band, Presbyterian’s
ROTC band, and the football band
(forerunner of Davidson’s present Pep
Band), entertained the spectators.
Lawrence again performed Saturday
night at an informal dance that lasted
until the late hour of 12 midnight.

Life at Davidson during this period
was far from duil. The Court of
Control was waging a war against
chapel conduct offenders and fresh-

men who were going home over the
weekends and not supporting the
football team. Upperclassmen were
asked to encourage the offending
freshmen to see the érror of their
ways. ;

Big plans were being made for the
week after homecoming for the annual
Men’s Fashion Week. According to
its sponsor, the Men’s Fashion Guild
of Charlotte, ‘‘The purpose of the
campaign is to inform the male
population of the meaning of being
well-dressed. The sense of security it
gives does not require a quantity of
clothes, but quality and taste.”’
Obviously, this was another fine
educational opportunity offered by

the college:
Nat Daniel summed up the home-

coming experience in his column add-

ressed to the many girls who had
found themselves on the Davidson
campus: ‘You have visited the board-
ing houses, and have unknowingly
witnessed the metamorphosis of man-
ners—for chairs are pulled back from
the table for you, and everyone
stands for grace, and you get your tea
poured, and the biscuits are passed
instead of thrown, and the meal takes
about twenty minutes instead of the
usual nine or ten.’

1966

Vince Foster, Social Committee
Chairman, said of Homecoming ’67:
“This is the best entertainment we've
ever had at Davidson and probably
the best for years to come.”’

Dionne Warwick performed Friday
night in Love Auditorium :to a
standing-room-only crowd. Saturday
night’s concert in Johnston Gym
drew 3500 people to hear several
comedian teams and the Righteous
Brothers.

Unfortunately, the comedians were
first on the program and received
considerable hissing from the aud-
ience. So much so that the Brothers
were unnerved and cut their numbers
by half.

Director of the College Union, C.
Shaw Smith's explanation that his-
sing was ‘‘a local situation’ and
shouldn’t be taken seriously did not
allay the musicians’ fears.

At Saturday’s game, the Wildcats
scored a smashing win over. their
long-time rival, The Citadel Bulldogs.
Attendance was the highest ever With
over 3000 people at the pre-game
lunch alone.

An outdoor folk concert was held at
1:30 am Sunday on the baseball field.
Afterwards, until 4 am, a ‘““Hungry D
Supper Club Breakfast’’ was served in
the Union. Bedtimes had grown later
since the '51 homecoming.

As in '51, students were concerned
about the military draft. Since at the
time one’s draft status was based
partially on one’s class rank, there
was talk of Davidson going on a
pass-fail grading system.

The court of Control was upset
again with chapel conduct, this time
over the student bodys rudeness to a
speaker after he passed the prescribed
30-minute mark. The Grey Library’s
lack of space was causing student
unrest.

On a lighter note, Davidson men
were obsessed with the idea of 700

girls being housed in Belk and
Richardson dorms for the ‘Big Week-
end”’.

The girls expressed their opinion of
the situation in an article’in The
Winston-Salem Journal and Sentinel.
The Davidson man was, according to
them, “smart but immature’, ‘‘very
rich and well-rounded”’.

One girl had this to say: ‘If a
Davidson boy looks deeply into your
eyes, he'll probably propose a bridge

If you’re looking for someone
interesting to talk to this weekend,
track down some of the alumni
returning for homecoming.

Dr. Robert L. Murray, the oldest
alum, is planning to be on campus
weekend, graduated in 1917. He can
tell you about living in the old
Chambers Building-when they had
fireplaces in every dorm room and
college servants to lift wood up to the
fourth floor with ropes.

‘‘Chambers was really different
then,”’ he said. ‘‘We used to build
fires on the fourth floor. We didn’t
think anyone could burn it down, but
I guess we were wrong.”

Some classes were held in Cham-
bers then, but most were in the
Sentelle Building next to the old
library.

Dr. Murray visited Davidson last |
homecoming and said that, though
lots of things have changed, the
people are. still just as friendly.
‘‘Everybody speaks to everybody.
They really meke you feel at home.”

When asked about coeducation at
Davidson, Dr. Murray simply replied,

‘I _guess it's all right.”’
