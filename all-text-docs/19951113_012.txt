THE DAVIDSONIAN

—— Coffee at long last

National coffee-shop brings Cornelius caffeinated culture

By GeorbDIE SCHIMMEL
Staff Writer

A colossal inflated cup and
saucer rose like a sort of Star of
Bethlehem two weeks ago last
Thursday in Cornelius, marking
Caribou Coffee’s much-antici-
pated entrance into the college
community, an entrance come
none-too-soon.

Half-tucked away a few doors
down from Roses and beside soon-
to-be Breugger’s Bagel Bakery,
Caribou Coffee is not immediately

discernible. But it is memorable, *

with an inviting ambience, bright,
modern architecture, good music,
andattractively arranged tables and
chairs inside and on the sidewalk
outside.

And the prices are more than
reasonable. A small cup of the day
costs under a dollar, Mocha a little
over two — the lowest prices
around, even in Charlotte. The
hours are accommodating, with the
coffee shop opening at 8 a.m. and
staying open until 11 on week-
ends, 10 weekdays.

Originating in Minnesota,
Caribou Coffee is part of chain of

40 stores owned by John and Kim
Cooket. More of a neighborhood
gathering place than strictly
coffeeshop, Caribou is sensitive to
the needs of the community. Within
the month amateur musicians will
perform on the weekends, and if
the demand is great enough, poetry
readings may also commence.
Caribou Coffee promises to
be a cheerful place to spread one’s
work and relax over acup of excel-
lent, inexpensive coffee — an in-
vigorating change of pace for the
college community. One wishes
only that it had come sooner.

‘ stretching it to far to say that suf-
fering true clinical depression is a
about as close to pure pain as you
can get. I think it could be argued
that it could be equal to any suffer-
ing that one can have ina place like
Auschwitz.

When you were going
through depression or just your
life in general, did you look to

. other writers to explain the phe-
nomena of depression?

In the hospital when I thought
my mind was secure enough, |
began to read about depression as
a medical topic. I read a great deal

about the iliness from the clinical
point of view, and then still later I
began to respond to the fact that

the illness.

Buteven so there are not many
— in literature — pure descrip-
tions of depression that I know of.
We know for instance that Edgar
Allan Poe must have been de-

pressed. I did recall that Virginia

Woolf suffered horribly from de-
pression and died as aresult of it. I
read her journals. I read Sylvia
Plath. But the literature of depres-
sion is fairly limited — that is in
terms of pure description of de-
pression.

In Darkness Visibleyou state:
that more females than males have
been diagnosed with depression.
Doyou think that there is areason
for that? Do you think there is a
difference between female and
male depression?

I don’t know what the exact
consensus is. I think the theory is
that women may be somewhat

more predisposed toward the ill-
ness than men, but others theorize

“people helping people”

that ... men traditionally simply
do not admit to themselves that
they have it and are far more resis-
tant to deal with it than women ...
Maybe it’s just a combination of
the two.

You describe in Darkness
Visible how music and its con-
nection with your past gave you
the moment of clarity in your de-
pression. After this moment, you
made your first step to recovery.
In many depression cases music
is used as a type of therapy. Why
do you think music is helpful?

I think that the barometer of
my mood is often been my re-
sponse to music. When I’m feel-
ing the depressive mood, I don’t
listen to music. It’s as if that area
of my sensibilities has been
drowned, because I gothrough long
periods of down time. I don’t
mean deep clinical depression, but
just depressive periods, andI won’t
respond to music.

The barometer of my mood is

that when I’m feeling up and good,
I listen to music constantly ...
When oneis profoundly depressed,
you don’trespond to anything plea-
surable — nothing — food, nature,
anything. It’s a terminal inability
to respond to any pleasurable im-
pulse.

Do you think the growing
awareness of depression as a dis-
ease. and not as an abstract men-
tal disorder will change the per-
ception and judgment that our
society has on suicide?

I remember well within my
adult lifetime hearing people speak
of suicide as immoral. Why did he
kill himself? How cowardly he

was to do that. I heard that many,
many times: suicide is a cowardly
act. This was, of course, a number
of years ago, but I heard it over and
over again ...

So I think in answer to your
question — Yes. I think that there
is certainly a more, a much more,
widespread acceptance of the fact
[of suicide]. I don’t think it’s com-
plete by any means. I think that the
vast portion of the country and /
society is unaware of this, but most
importantly the overwhelming
majority thinks that suicide can be
prevented — because it is the re-
sult of depression and depression
can be treated.

Symphony

chestra and choir are the core of
musical activity. Now, as a repu-
table institution, we have a com-
prehensive performance forum.”

The orchestral program also
gives the students opportunities to
work with professional soloists and
musicians of the local community.
Musicians such as, Jane Hart,
Cynthia Lawing, and Jim Swisher
have been premiered in past per-
formances. Hart and Lawing per-
formed in Bach’s Brandenburg
Concerto No. 5, and Swisher in the
Piano Concerto in A Minor by
Edvard Grieg. Swisher will also
be performing in the spring con-
cert in Prior’s Piano Concerto No.
2, entitled “Phoenix Rising.”

The orchestra is comprised of
approximately 60 students,, some
of the musicians are also involved
in choir, Chamber Choir, the Wind
Ensemble and the Jazz Ensemble.

Ever wonder how they
take those pictures
of the whole campus?

Only one of the students is actually
a music major, the senior bassist,
Jonathan Pieslak. Thus the expec-
tations require a lot of flexibility in
the performance of the students.
Prior states, “Students who are
strong academically often have a
musical aptitude, and the orchestra
is an outlet for continuing the de-
velopment of these musical tal-.
ents.” The orchestra. will be a
viable tool in attracting students
and musicians in the future.

The group will be performing
additional concerts in the spring at
Davidson and in the Charlotte area,
It is imperative that the commu-
nity and the college support musi-
calendeavors suchas the Davidson
College Symphony Orchestra. It
is also of great cultural signifi-
cance for the musical activity of
the orchestra to persist in an envi-
ronment where orchestras are con-
tinually disappearing. It is indeed
unusual for a school of our size to
have an orchestra. Thus, the com-
munity and college should con-
tinue to support this venture.
