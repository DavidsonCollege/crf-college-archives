which endangers the health and
safety of others are prohibited.”
The students can either plead

guilty to the charges and have the —

Judiciary Committee deal with the
penalty, or may appeal the charges
through the Judiciary Committee
or the Honor Council.

Terry emphasized that the stu-
dents responsible for the incident
will not be punished en mass, but
“will be dealt with onan individual
basis.”

Urbino is not being charged
with any violation.

On Monday, the Dean of Stu-
dents Office distributed “Pledge/
New Member Activity Guidelines”
to every freshman. Rule No. 11 0n
the list states that, “No pledge/new
member activity may involve haz-
ing of any sort. These prohibited
activities include, but are not lim-
ited to, physical danger, alcohol
and drugs, public nudity, and men-
tal anguish.”

The Dean’s review commit-
tee, which will investigate the inci-
dent, is comprised of two students,
Patterson Court Council President
Julie Petty and KA President Rod

~ Carter; Assistant Dean of Students

John Eaves; and a Faculty Repre-
sentative, Alex Pinkston. Holmes
will help coordinate and facilitate
communication between the chap-
ter, the national and the commit-
tee.

According to Holmes, thé
Committee will attempt to deter-
mine whether theevent was achap-
ter-sponsored activity, or whether
the action was undertaken purely
by individuals.

Upon completion of its inves-
tigation, the Committee will sub-
mit its findings and recommenda-
tions to Terry and College Presi-
dent John Kuykendall.

Holmes said that one thing in
SPE’s favor has been the very help-
ful response of the National Orga-
nization to the incident. The more
the national helps to resolve the
incident with the chapter intemally,
the more lenient the college is ex-
pected to be.

“We are doing everything we
can to work with our national of-
fice and the school,” SPE Presi-
dent Scott Newnam said.

The College has received a
good deal of negative coverage in
the local media over the incident.
Reports on Charlotte’s Channel 9
andinthe Charlotte Observer have
given the “hazing” incident high
profile.

Carolina State Law defines hazing
as “to annoy any student by play-
ing abusive or ridiculous tricks
upon him, to frighten, scold, beat
or harass him, or to subject him to
personal indignity.”

Holmes said, “I don’t think
these guys did anything overtly
malicious.”

Urbino said, “I don’thave any
bad feelings; I’m not bitter.”

“Tt’s justa game that gotoutof
hand, accidentally out of hand. It’s
not as if that group of guys got
together. and said ‘Let’s hurt this
guy’... Those guys that were doing
this to me are my friends, and in the
future will continue to be my
friends... I think that what the
newspaper and TV were looking
for was to fill up some time.”

“T think we needed to learn the
lesson... I believe we have learned
a lesson.”
