REV. WOODSON
OPEAKS HERE

Speaker Takes Dwight L.
Moody’s Life as the Sub-
ject of His Sermon

The Rev. Dr. Marshall
Woodson, pastor of the First
Presbyterian Church in Salis-
bury, was the guest minister at
the Vesper Service last Sun-
day night.

The invocation was given by Dr.
Kenneth Foreman of the faculty.
Dr. Woodson read the first four
verses of the twelfth chapter of
Genesis for his text.

The pastor took the life of Dwight
L. Moody as the subject of his ser-
mon. He gave the most important
events in Moody’s life and showed
how he was always a faithful fol-
lower of God,

Dr. Woodson said that Moody's
success in life was due to five char-
The first was complete
surrender to God. He continually
sought a clearer’ knowledge of
God’s will, and tried to do it.

His love for men was one of his
outstanding traits of character. He
looked everywhere for men to save,
and asked thousands of people, “Are
you a Christian?” He enjoyed 'sav-
promising

acteristics.

ing people and left a
business career to do so.

His love for the Bible was the
third characteristic. He studied the
Bible early every morning, because
he wanted to use God’s word and
not his own invhis talks.

Next, he was a man of prayer.
Dr. Woodson said, “He lived, moved
and had his being with prayer.” He
had his prayers answered many
times during his life.

The last characteristic was one
It was his exper-
ience of the  infilling power of
God's Holy Spirit. This is the same
power that has possessed all of the
great religious leaders.

The special music for the service
was “Come. Holy Spirit,” by Bur-
dette, and was sung by four mem-
bers of the Glee Club. This quar-
tet consisted of Jim Ballard, first,
tenor; Harper Beall, second tenor;
Wilson Northcross, baritone; and
Stewart Oglesby, bass.

DR. FOREMAN TEACHES
COURSE AT. RICHMOND

Dr. Kenneth J. Foreman, of the
Davidson faculty, spent twelve days
during the month of January in
Richmond teaching a course in “The
Use of the Bible in Practical Prob-
lems” at the General Assembly
Training School. :

Each year the training school
holds three short terms during
which classes are conducted for the
benefit of church workers. It was
one of these classes which Dr. Fore-
man taught from January 16 to 27,
for a period of two hours each day.
The school gives a Master of Arts

given by God.

degree to college graduates for two]

years’ work in the institution and
these classes are allowed to count
toward the degree. Although the
training school is for women only,
both men and women are allowed
to take these courses, the only re-
quirement being that all the stu-
dents be graduates of a college or
recognized junior college. David-
son students will be interested to
know that Dr. W. L. Lingle and
Dr. W. J. Martin, former Davidson
presidents, have both been presi-

thirty, amid great formality. Formal
academic attire is required, which in
my case involves the hasty donning
of a ragged black “commoner’s”
gown. Dinner is served in the mag-
nificent college hall, around the
walls of which are the portraits of
college dignitaries since the fif-
teenth century. It is reasonably safe
to predict that the fare will consist
of gravy soup, a fish course, roast
beef, and cabbage and potatoes.
After dinner, a half hour is squan-
dered over a cup of coffee in the
Junior Commons room, or in the
rooms of a friend. It is difficult to
get down to real work before nine
o'clock.

The routine, of course, is varied
now and then. In the evenings,
when possible, I go to the movies,
most of which last term were
American movies which I had al-
ready seen, or occasionally I attend
a play or concert.

The main feature of the meeting
was the initiation of new members.
One ‘of the requirements made of
the new men was a two minute ex-
temporaneous talk on some timely
and informative subject. All of the
candidates gave excellent examples
of this type of speech. Some of the
more interesting were: “Mokey”
Faison’s talk on “Which is larger—
a bird's-eye view of a bull, or a
bull’s-eye view of a bird?” In this
most enlightening address Mr. Fai-
son built up in a very interesting
manner his opinion that a bull's-
eye view was the larger. Bill Mar-
quiss spoke on: “Does a hose burn
up or down?” Joe Calvin gave a
lecture on the proximity of the sea
to the shore. John Reisner spoke
on, “Should sit-down strikers take
setting up exercises?” Other ini-
tiates presented short talks on
amusing subjects.

Following is a list of those who
were taken into this forensic fra-
ternity: Sophomores—Bob McClel-
land, Bill Marquess, John Reisner,
J. Sherrard Rice, Joe Calvin, Locke
White, and Ken McLean; Juniors—
Bill Rader and Bill Kiesewetter;
Seniors—John Allen and A. Mw

This fraternity selects its candi-
dates from those students showing
forensic ability in the student body.
The chief’sources of selecting these
men is from the students trying out
for the debating team yearly. Work-

team and the forensic council this

DR. HOOD GIVES TALK
10 BIBLICAL STUDENTS

Dr. Frazer Hood, professor of
Psychology here, went to the Co-
lumbia Theological Seminary in De-
catur, Ga., during the examination
period. While he was there, he
delivered two lectures.

Dr. Hood took a subject that was
related to both his audience and his
own interests. This was: “Psycho-
logy Applied to the Study of the
Bible.”

The audience for Dr. Hood's talks
was composed of the members of
the student body at the Seminary
and also of many invited ministers
from that section, These lectures
were given on consecutive nights of
January 26 and 27,

On his way back to the college,
Dr. Hood stopped over in Atlanta,
Ga., for a short time, where he met
several Davidson graduates.

There is a striking relation be-
tween religion and psychology, and
it was brought out in both of these
talks which Dr. Hood made. Espe-
cially is there need for the use of
psychology in the interpretation of
dreams that, are in the Bible.

SIGMA UPSILON HEARS
TALK BY DR. CUMMING

Sigma Upsilon, honorary literary
fraternity, held its first meeting
since the Christmas holidays Mon-
day night. The meeting convened
at nine o'clock in the Phi Delta
Theta hottse. Dr. Cumming fur-
nished the outstanding talk of the
evening in a biographical sketch of
the life of Thomas Hood, the fam-
ous English poet and humorist. An-
other interesting literary discourse
was presented by J. H. “Herby”
Ross. Among the faculty members
present were Professor Lilly, Dr.
Hood and Dr. Goldiere. The ser-
ious side of the meeting adjourned
at about ten-thirty and refresh-
ments were then served.

however, when he looked off and
caught the ball on his nose.

He worked so hard after his ac-
cident that he soon gained a place
with the Philadelphia Symphony
Orchestra.

After the end of the war Garber
decided to be a professional or-
chestra leader. He organized a
string trio and became successful
with it in Washington, D. C.

Garber added to his orchestra and
won his national fame while in
Florida, during the business boom.
He stayed in Florida for five years,
fulfilling what was to be a two
weeks contract.

At the height of his success “Gen-
ial Jan” changed his style from his
original novelty entertainment and
jazz to his soft lilting dance rhythm.
Many expected failure for him af-
ter this, but when they heard him
they realized he was far better
than ever.

As one of the top dance bands
Garber has filled engagements all
over the country. He played from
