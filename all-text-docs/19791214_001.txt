By GLENN KELLUM

Staff Correspondent
Faculty compensation and
high fuel costs will be major
problems in formulating the
proposed 1980-81 College bud-
get, according to Comptroller

Robert Davidson.

A committee of top level
administrators will present the
proposed budget to the Trus-

tees in February for their final
approval.
The Davidson chapter of the

American Association of Uni-

versity Professors (AAUP)
approved a request Wednesday

‘for a 15% average increase in:

faculty. compensation.
According to a report by the

chapter’s Compensation Com: |

mittee, “This figure will do no

more than make up for the
shortfall in 1979-80, in a year in
which inflation should run to at

o. 10%.

Religion Professor David
Kaylor, also chairman of the
Davidson AAUP chapter asid
the request was a very modest
one. Kaylor noted that despite a
7% average raise last year,

When asked about the AAUP
report, Vice President for Aca-

Terry said approximately
$7500 had been raised toward
the $10,000 goal as of Wednes-

The money will go towards

Terry, who was optimistic
that the goal would be reached,

from the drama workshop pre-

in the $7500 figure.

The 1987 Program works toward a goal that is forever inflated

By JOHN SIMAN
Assistant News Editor

The $35 million contribution goal of the
11 year Davidson 1987 Program is an
obsolete figure, according to Vice President
for Development Duane Di

“We're going to have to far more
than $35 million to do what we planned to
do,” Dittman said. The 1987 Program was
begun in 1976 to help finance current
operations, endowments, and construction
up to Davidson's hundred and fiftieth
aniversary.

So far the program is ‘‘somewhere near
on schedule,”’ Dittman said. An average of
almost $3.2 million must be raised annually
to reach the $35 million mark. Giving ~
between fiscal 1977 and 1978 (inclusive)
averaged over.$2.54 million, according to
figures released by the Development Office.

The contribution goal was estimated in _

1975. Since then inflation has made. cost
projections unrealistic. “Everything costs
more’ than anyone anticipated in 1976,

Dittman said. :
Nevertheless, $35 million will en as
the program’s nominal—though not ac-

tuai—goal. “The way inflation is running
now we'd have to change our goal every
year,” Dittman said.

Dittman declined to cite a more realistic
goal. ‘‘We can’t forsee the rate of inflation
for the next eight years,” he explained.
Fundraising is ‘‘not. an exact science,’’ he
later added: *

The 1987 program is designed to streng-
then Davidson financially in three areas:
general, annual aid to the college (a $10

_mnillion: nominal goal); creation..of endow-
ments for professorships, scholarships, and
library support (a $9 million nominal goal);
’ and construction and renovation of campus

¢buildings (a $6 million nominal goal). ‘“This
is by far the broadest program Davidson
has ever had,” Dittman

Dittman said the 1987 program has
recently been criticized pe oe too much

more importance on one than another.” He - Saat ees

attributed the criticism to the publicity the

Commons and proposed new dormitories
have received lately.

The 1987 program includes seven build-
ing projects, according to data released by
the Development office. A new Fine Arts
building, the College Commons, renovation
of Martin Science Building (completed), a
math wing addition for Martin,.a sports
complex, new dormitories, and a new shop
and warehouse were proposed in 1979. -

Dittman pointed out that despite the
publicity given building projects, Davidson
has received ‘‘at least three’’ endowed

. professorships since the start of the 1987
program. Also, the College has recently .
