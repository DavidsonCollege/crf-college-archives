Sports RoundUp

By Bob MeLeod

With exams and Mid-Winters behind their backs, David-
son’s athletes settled down to the last lap of the winter sports
schedule, with both the wrestling and basketball teams taking
the road. Coach Mcléver has his prospective gridders out
starting today, intramural bowling is and inter-frat
bowling and basketball are in full swing.

The Wildcat quintet took on Duke and Carolina, co-leaders
of the conference, yesterday and the day before respectively.
Monday and Tuesday they journey to Raleigh to take on N.C.
State and Wake Forest. The ‘Cats gave the Red Terrors a
good licking here in an earlier game, but State has shown
great improvement in their last tew games and should make
it hard for the ’Cats on their home floor. Coach: Shepard’s
boys will be seeking to avenge an early season trouncing
when they meet the Demon Deacons, but they are doomed
to defeat unless they can find someone to hold down the
scoring sophomore flash, Herb Cline. To get in the conference
tournament this year, the Wildcat five will have to win both
of these games, and also conduct a highly successful tour of
South Carolina week after next. Wish we could get in the
Raleigh tourney this year to uphold the good showing the
cagers made last year in going to the semi-finals before los-
ing to the champion Clemson Tigers. Main trouble with the
team this year is the lack of Scoring punch, andthe scarcity
of experienced substitutes. The loss of Ed» Lucas through an
injury -to his hand hasn't aided in the solution to this replace-
ment problem.

Spring Practice Begins

As the gridders begin their spring drills, the main trouble
confronting Coaches Gene McEver, Chet Chapman, and Laur-
ence Spearman is the discovery of capable replacements at the
ends a good combination in the backfield. Prospects for a
successful season are the best in years with @ more representa-
tive schedule and more seasoned material to choose trom. In
all fifteen lettermen return from last year’s team. Frank
Niven and Bob Smith are the returning lettermen at end. The
coaches’ problem is to find suitable replacements for them
during spring practice. Strandwitz and King from last years
reserves and Washburn trom the freshmen are the best pros-
pects. Three lettermen, Bahnson, Knocler, and Bell team with
Hipp to-give the Wildcats a sturdy group of tackles. All,
however, are inexperienced and must gain needed polish dur-
ing the spring drills. At the guard we find four outstanding
prospects: lettermen Marsh and Johnson, Beester star Arnold,
and big Herb Rainey, who was outstanding as a freshman this
year. They also must acquire the polish for which these
spring drills are held. At center lettermen Caldwell and Bal-
sey. will be fighting for the top position with Peter Young
up from the freshman ranks to add to the opposition. . In the
backfield"the prospects are the best in years. Coach McEver
has lettermen Jay Bolin, Yoder, Spencer, Sparpe, Hackney,
and Shannon back, and in addition has triple-threaters Malanéy
and Fredricks up-from the freshman ranks. But the problem
for the coaches in spring drills is to find a suitable combina-
tion. This is something strange tor Davidson, having reserves
to choose from. This ‘item should add at least a couple of
wins to the record next year. Here’s hoping they succeed be-
cause what one of us wouldn’t enjoy seeing Davidson back on
the Winning side in football, ;
