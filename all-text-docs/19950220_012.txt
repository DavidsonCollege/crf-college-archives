COOKIN” (H0OIAN

By GeorpiE SCHIMMEL
Staff writer

They ate roasted poppy seeds
and almonds, boiled tomatoes and
parsley and yogurt gravy, ginger
and garlic, and even some chile
and onions — and that was only
the sauce. As an appetizing comple-
ment to Solidarity Week, the Col-
lege Union last Friday offered an
Indian Food Workshop in the
Alumni House. Under the knowl-
edgeable guidance of senior
Devjani Dev, the event unfolded
into a particularly enjoyable
evening.

Those attending the workshop
had the opportunity to learn about
the preparation of Indian food first-
hand. Cooking tasks were divided
among the students, who follow-
ing Devjani’s instruction and
emerged from the steaming kitchen
within an hour to assemble their
spiced labors on the table. In the
kitchen, Devjani explained where
one can find the various spices in
the U.S. and how those spices are
used in Indian cooking.

Though the table was set con-
ventionally with plates and silver-
ware, many students abandoned
convention for the more traditional
style of Indian dining. Junior Chris-
tine Roberts was one of these stu-
dents. “It was very authentic,” she
said with unconcealed enthusiasm.
“T felt like I was in another place.”
As Devjani explained, “Basically
you eat on plates but not with forks
or spoons or knives. Instead, food
is eaten with unleavened bread used

to scoop things up. Usually you
would eat on banana leaves for
special occasions like weddings
and things, but of course no-one
did that.” (Banana leaves were
unfortunately unavailable.)

The lack of banana leaves,
however, did not bother anyone.
As sophomore Jenny Everett said,
“There’s certainly something com-
munal about sharing in the prepa-
rations of a meal and savoring your
achievements together. And once
you get a feel for what extra zest
you’re looking for and what com-
binations you want in the palate,
your culinary potential is limit-
less.” Sophomore Katie Brasfield
shared her enthusiasm: “It was
great.” As for the food? “Oh,” she
exclaimed laughing, “I liked it very
much.” After further reflection,

Jenny, at a loss for words and with
her throat tight and her speech sub-
dued, could say only “It was awe-
some.” Miles Mowry, a’ junior,
enjoyed the Indian food workshop
as well.

’ As is so often typical of a
Davidson student, more was at
work in his mind than the moment
at hand: “The food was delicious,
but more important was that the
Union got people together, people
who would not normally see each
other.

I got to chat about Davidson
and I think that was more impor-
tant than learning to cook an In-
dian dinner — it was more than
providing entertainment. Events
like these are out there for people
to get together, to talk — and that’s
what its all about.”

awhile, though, everyone seemed
to show a little more finesse than
they had originally started with, or
maybe those of us watching just
got a little more sympathetic.

By 11:00, the music was “‘kick-
ing,” according to sophomore Gra-
ham Ernst, though I’d be wary
before letting him DJ your next
date function. I actually caught
him humming some scary vintage
retro-eighties only moments be-
fore he made this comment. That
might suggest that somewhere in
the dark recesses of his psyche,

great cajun rhythm reminds Gra-
ham of Andrew Ridgely’s contri-
bution to Wham! — you know,
back in the good old days, when
“Wake Me Up Before You Go-
Go” was considered catchy.

I will admit, however, that by
11:13, as “Queen Caroline” was
leading us with her stand-up bass,
things had gotten pretty lively in
the 900 Room. Maybe it was be-
cause performing cajun music had
become a spectator sport. Armed
with everything from empty Philly
Cream Cheese containers to make-
shift drum sticks, my fellow revel-
ers and I were good-naturedly add-
ing what we could to the rhythm
section. Luckily for junior Pete

Boylan, our “jam session” lasted
several uproarious minutes — giv-
ing him time to swap his triangle
(with which he was having no luck)
for a snappy marraca he could re-
ally shake.

Who knew tapping plastic
containers and shaking your car
keys could be so fun? When asked
if Monday night’s Union festivi-
ties put them in the Mardi Gras
mood, seniors Cathy Oakes and
Nicole Watson responded with an
enthusiastic cry, “We’re there!” If
anything, Ragin’ Cajun Night in
the 900 Room helped Davidson
students feel a little of the color
and life of New Orleans in their
very own backyard.

are going in today’s society and
how to bridge the communication
gap between them.

Symposium panelists include
Charlotte news anchor Bob Inman,
Davidson professors Elizabeth
Mills, Nancy J. Fairley, Peter
Krentz, and Mary C. Thornberry,
and Davidson students Sarah
Orsbon and Holt Vaughan. The
symposium will be an “Oprah
Winfrey-style event” in which, af-
ter an excerpt from the play is
shown, the floor will be open for

discussion. According to Costa,
the excerpts will serve as “jump-
ing-off points” for discussion.
Costa hopes that the conjunction
of the play and the symposium will
raise the issue of whether theater
can be used “as a way to heal
things.” She believes that by put-
ting The Heidi Chronicles and
“Tomorrow’s Women” together,
some “viable solutions” can be
addressed and perhaps a greater
understanding of where the topic
of gender issues is going in today’s
world will be gained.

The Heidi Chronicles will be
shown in Hodson Hall. It begins
on Tuesday, February 21, at 8:00
p.m. with 8:00 p.m. shows through

Saturday and a show on Sunday,
February 26, at 2 p.m. Tickets are

. $6 general admission and $4 for

students and senior citizens. The
opening night show is $3 for all
tickets. The box office is open
from 2-5 p.m. weekdays, and tick-
ets can be reserved by calling 892-
2340.

“Tomorrow’s Women” is on
Monday, February 27, at 7 p.m. in
Hodson Hall. Admission is free,
but those wishing to attend should
call 892-2361 for a reservation as
seating is limited. There will be a
reception immediately following
the symposium, hosted by
Davidson fraternity Sigma Phi
Epsilon.
