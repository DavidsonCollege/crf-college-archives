Davidson Plays Under

Lights for

Saturday night at 8 o'clock in the Greens-
boro Memorial Stadium, Davidson College
and N. C. State meet in the most impor-
tant football game of the early season, the
game which will attract more state-wide
attention than any other contest before the
middle of October. It is unusual that such
, an early season game should hold such an
important place in the eyes of the football
world, and yet the reasons are obvious.

First, it will be played at night, and will
offer the first major test of the fast growing
popular method of playing football—under
lights. Last week, the first night football
games were played, and all the comments

them intercepted passes.
Ledyard DeCamp, guard for Davidson,

caught one throw and ran 40 yards to the
two-yard line, before being brought down.
The ball was put over in two more plays.
Joe McCall repeated the feat a few moments
later when he intercepted another pass, and
traveled 70 yards for a touchdown. These
two scores represented Davidson's margin
of victory.

This year State comes back with a pow-
erful, though green, squad. Their team will
average 180 pounds, about 10 pounds more
than Davidson. -A line of five or six sopho-
mores is built around Captain Mack Stout
at guard, considered one of the best lines-
men in North Carolina circles. The back-
field will have at least two men playing
their first year of intercollegiate football.

Coach John Van Liew has whipped the
squad into a powerful defensive unit.7 They
held High Point Saturday to no first downs.
The line moved the Panthers around like
ushers at a wedding. In the meantime, Chief
Gurneau, Indian star, and Jeffery, led their
mates to six touchdowns and 16 first downs.

The Wolfpack is inclined to keep its feet
gn the ground, and not to pass the ball.
They were successful in completing ony
one toss against High Point but gained al-
most at will through the line.

In spite of their impressive total of first
downs and strong defense, we believe that
Davidson has slightly the better team. Expe-

to see how many books on this ideal list

This Carnegie fund is not to take the place
of the fund which Davidson College set
aside to be used year by year by the library,
but it is to supplement this fund. This means
that we will have about seven thousand five
