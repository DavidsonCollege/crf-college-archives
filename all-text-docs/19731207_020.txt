Do you seniors remember this bunch of freshmen when they inhabited 4th East (now Sentelle)
four years ago. Quite a crowd! Missing from the pic: the What-a-Burger girls (Lynn and Martha).

Unidentified Woman Shot

Tragedy struck the David-
son campus last Tuesday
when freshman Egbert P.
Pazzola was manicled in the
rifle range room after a
wayward shot from his
weapon struck and mortally
wounded an_ unidentified
woman in the student store
directly above.

Officer Osgood Fenworthy
led the sobbing youth to an
awaiting squad car to be held
without bail in the Davidson
Police station pending a
preliminary hearing into the
charges sometime next April,
while Charlotte homicide dec-
tective Fenton R. Tween in-
vestigated the hapless cir-

Gi rls Discuss Coeducation

For many. of the girls at
Davidson this year
coeducation has caused no
major adjustment problems.
Most of the girls attended
public high schools and thus
are familiar with a coed set-
ting.

For one group of girls,
however, coeducation is a new
experience. Several of the
transfer women students from
single-sex finishing schools
were interviewed about their
reactions to Davidson. For the
most part their comments
were favorable.

Francis Lee: ‘‘When I came
to Davidson this year I was ap-
prehensive about ‘making’
friends with members of the
opposite sex. I was not sure
this would be possible since it

is often difficult for a girl to
consider a boy just a friend
and vice versa. However, for
some reason I have no
problems in this area. I won-
der why?”

Margaret Welles: ‘‘David-
son (tee-hee) is really (tee-
hee) a lot of fun. I like it. In
general, I’m pleased to be
here. My only complaint (tee-
hee) concerns’ boarding
facilities here, but now I think
(tee-hee) I've transcended
this problem. Besides, who
wants to live on campus?”

Lee Newsom: ‘I came to
Davidson to study. Being
academically inclined, I’ve
developed a pronounced
proclivity to study 7 days a
week, 10 hours a day. If I keep
it up, I’m sure to ‘make’ a Phi

Looking forward to a great
spring season, Douglas men-
tioned another possible pur-
chase which would be an in-
valuable asset tothe team. “If
the destroyer proves socially
unacceptable, we plan to
move underground - as it
were.”

Jumping right into the spirit
of things with the usual en-
thusiasm necessary for man-

ning his office, Chip Stone
recently commented, ‘A
nuclear powered team would
be difficult to beat.’’ Stone is
referring of course to a
nuclear submarine.

Possible uses would run
along the lines of underwater
tactics. Guy lines running

Cat’s boats to a place on the
hull of the sub would power the

Betta Kappa. Confidence is all
that is needed, and I know I’m
smart. I came to Davidson
and got accepted, didn’t I?”’

Marry Miller: ‘‘A wonderful
experience thus far is what
Davidson has been for me.
Although I admit that I'm a lit-
tle shy, the relaxed en-
vironment here has been in-
valuable in helping me to
define an ideal male-female
relationship.
“I’m particularly indebted to
Bill Vaughan and Don Trask.
They're so cute. Yes it looks
like the big ‘D’ and I will get
along just groovy.”

Martha Royster: ‘‘As far as

‘I’m concerned Davidson is far

out, much too conservative
It’s a real down copping the
drugs I desire and need (LSD,
mesc, and cocaine), and most
of the dudes I’ve dated don’t
make it, man.

“I should have gone to
Chapel Hill or Berkely. But
now that I’m here, there’s not
much I can do, really. Thank
God I’m into yoga.”’

Ann Bode: ‘‘Although a lot
of people kidded me at first
about my name, Bode is
pronounced Bo-dee, not Bod!

“Although I still have to be
on guard with blind dates, for
the most part all problems are
now over. This is especially
true since I've now got a man.’

cumstances. ‘‘Near as we
can tell,’’ Tween exolled, ‘‘this
h’yar kid’s gun prematurely
fired when he sneezed on the
trigger release, the bullet
ricocheted off the floor, into
the middle pillar, went
through the third fixture from
the left, up into the padding
between the floors, nicked a
brassie 10’’x%'’ wood screw
on the upper edge, tore a hole
in the carpet by the display
case, knocked a chip out of an
official Davidson College
laminated mug, hit the victim
between the 5th and 7th Lum-
ber vertebrae, and came to
rest in the plastic book case af-
ter drilling three Rod
McKyoon pome books; yep I
think we got '‘im_ on
premeditation!”’

Student Store Manager
Peter Nicholls called it ‘‘the
most terrible thing that could
have happened here. I don’t
know if we can ever replace
those McKuen books - they’re
part of a set and almost im-
possible to obtain. I guess I'll
just have to sell them as
slightly used and absorb the
loss.”’

When asked about the
stricken women, Nicholls
looked over the counter and
shrugged, ‘‘nope, sorry I don’t
know her; anyway she disn’t
buy anything so there’s no
refund involved.”

Meanwhile, police left the
expired woman ‘in situ’ in
hopes that someone might
wander in and be able to iden-
tify the body.

Tween indicated that most
of the credit for the boy’s cap-

ture goes to campus security
guard Ray Sherrill ‘‘whose
keen forsight and quick think-
ing led to the arrest of this
despret criminal.”

“It’s just too bad he couldn’t
have nabbed him before the
kid went through with his
plan, but then we wouldn't
been able to prove notin’.”’

When asked about a motive
involved in the case, Tween

replied, ‘‘No, I don’t think
Pazzola had a getaway car
waiting.”

The officer in charge of the

shooting range, Capt. Abel
White, charged that the whole
affair was a gross misun-
derstanding and vowed to
protect any person connected
with the ROTC department
“no matter how many in-
nocent victims are involved.”’

“Anyway, don’t blame the
kid for this tactical error,”
White continued, ‘‘blame the
weapon. It’s one of those damn
RONCO rifles Colonel Foster
picked up last year.

“I'd been telling him that he
couldn't jerk the trigger or
he’d be off in his aim, that he
should squeeze the trigger.

“Besides, Pazzola couldn’t
have killed that women - I
didn’t give him any bullets.”’

Indeed, White’s words
proved true when Tween dug
the slug out of the bookcase.
After analysis by Charlotte
crime lab lieutenant Durward
B. Splinch, the supposed bullet
proved to be a piece of
“petrified radish which was
probably left caught between
the baldes of the Vegamtic
located in the barrel cham-
ber’’, Splinch said.

‘“‘When the boy sneezed, he
probably snapped the bent
blade back into position and
discharged the radish,’’ ex
plained Splinch, ‘‘which just
goes to prove the Japanese old
war saying ‘Rousy lifles don’t
read to trifles!’’’

After an allegation from the
Pazzola family lawyer that
the boy was therefore not ac-
countable for the slaying since
a radish is not recognized as a
legal murder weapon in North
Carolina, Tween nontheless
asserted that ‘‘young Egbert
is still liable for failure to
execute a correct command
from a superior officer.
defacing public property, and
littering and those can be
mighty serious! "’

In his guarded cell, Pazzola
choked on his terms as he
tried to recreated the days
shattering events.

“This probably means that I
won't even get a chance to
leave this crummy place,”
Pazzola vehemently sput-
tered.”
