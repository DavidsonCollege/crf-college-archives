Event marks the first steps in a goal to raise over $60, 00 |

Around 300 people attended the Patterson
Court Council’s Construction Gala on Oct. 19
in the Union Atrium. The event raised a little
over $2,000 dollars to help raise the $5,000 roof
of the Wildcat Habitat House. All PC houses
aided in the event, led by PC Service Chair,
Shaw Hipsher ’03.

The Generals opened the night, before Jim
Richards ’80, took the stage. Richards, who
serves on the board at Our Towns Habitat for
Humanity, introduced Etheleen Jetton, the
owner of the first Wildcat Habitat house, built in
1997. Richards later introduced Davidson

alumni Paul Leonard, President of the board of
Habitat for Humanity International. Davidson’s
flute ensemble played after these speakers while
desserts and drinks were served. The Union
Board sponsored the hypnotist act that followed
dessert.

The Gala helped push the Davidson College
Habitat for Humanity chapter further toward
their final goal of raising $60,500, the amount
necessary toconstruct the second Wildcat Habi-
tat House. The first house was built in 1997.

“We’re excited about this activity because it
brought the Davidson College community to-
gether under one roof—our student union—to
raise another roof,” said Hipsher. __
