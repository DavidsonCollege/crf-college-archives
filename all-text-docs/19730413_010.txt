Diamonders Face Great Test,

Challenge ECU In Twinbill

By JIM SITTERSON
Sports Editor

Tomorrow's doubleheader
with East Carolina marks the
critical point for this year's
baseball team, according to
Coach Jack Burris.

Last week the team defeated
North Carolina in what Burris
called, ‘‘the finest game of the
year and possibly the best
baseball game ever played by a
Davidson team.’

The win was followed by a
loss to Virginia the next day.

Frank Folger pitched four good
innings according to Burris, but
to Burris, but then he tired.

“Frank has had a sore arm
all year and it was his first start
of the year,” Burris said.

Burris felt, however, that pit-
ching was not responsible for
theloss. ‘‘Fielding hurt us, we
made three or four errors that
were very costly,’ Burris ex-
plained.

Last weekend was scheduled
as a four game road trip with
doubleheaders at Richmond
and VMI. Due to rain, only one

Cumberland Heads
Relay Participants

By BOB WETZEL
Asst. Sports Editor

The annual Davidson Relays
will be held tomorrow at
Richardson Field on the David-
son campus. Eleven teams led
by Cumberland, the defending
champs, and West Georgia, last
year’s runners-up, will par-
ticipate in the afternoon-long
competition.

The Wildcat thinclads and
Squads from Appalachian State,
Berry College, Carson-
Newman, the University of the
South, Western Carolina, Wake
Forest, High Point and
Catawba make up the remain-
der of what Coach Sterling Mar-
tin calls ‘‘one of the strongest
fields ever assembled in the
history of this meet."’

The competition will get un-
derway at 12:30 p.m. with the
six-mile run. Trials for the 100-
yard dash and the 120-yard high
hurdles will begin shortly
thereafter at 12:45, as will the
field events. Competition in the

various relays will start at
about 3. These relays will in-
clude the 440, 880, mile, and two-
mile relays, and the sprint and
distance medleys.

Martin looks for the fiercest
competition to be in the six-mile
run, the pole vault, and the high
jump. ‘“‘The high jump should
be particularly interesting,’’ he
noted. ‘‘The field includes
defending ACC champ Jerome
White of Wake Forest who has
done 6’ 11"’, as well as three
other jumpers who have
cleared 6’ 8"’.”’

Another outstanding per-
former to watch should be Jerry
Gaines of High Point in the
triple jump. ‘‘Gaines is the best
triple-jumper on the East Coast
at present,”’ Martin com-
mented. ‘‘He did better than 51'
at Furman.” Gaines is also the
favorite in the long jump.

Davidson performers to
watch in the meet include Eppa
Rixey in the high jump and
David Crumpler in the discus.

Sailors Vie For Crown

By JOHN McELVEEN
Staff Writer

The Davidson Sailing Team
will set their sails this weekend
at the Hartwell Reservoir when
they participate in the cham-
pionships for the South Atlantic
Sailing Association.

The sailors will be competing
in 420’s against seven other
qualifying teams. ‘Though
Clemson would have to be the
favorite, due to the home ad-
vantage and two good skip-
pers,’ commented Jim Hunter,
“it will be one of the tightest
and most balanced cham-
pionship regattas we've had.

“After coming in third out of
a field ot nine in the Duke
Regatta. we feel a lot more
competitive.” commented Hun-
ter. The Duke Regatta was the
longest of the year and con-
sisted of eighteen races

“We sailed in moderate to
light winds and rain, but it was
good sailing. We sailed well but
came in third. Duke beat us by
two and one half points out of
the 60,"’ noted Douglas.

Hunter added, “It was a good
tough regatta right before the
conference championships.”

Daryl Douglas plans to skip-
per in A-Division with Somer-
ville as his crew, and Hunter
will sail B-Division with Pope
Mosely as his crew.

“We've been working for this
all season: there are going to be
sixteen tight races, on a lake
famous for its light and shifting
wind,’ said Hunter. “‘We've got
to have the best effort we've
ever had.”

game with Richmond could be
played which was won 6-0 by the
Spiders. The remaining game
with Richmond and the two with
VMI were postponed.

Burris explained that the
games may not be made up and
that Davidson's chances of win-
ning the conference may be
severely hurt if the games are
not rescheduled.

The deadline for making up
conference games is May 2 and
the teams are unsure if they can
fit in all games before the
deadline.

“Right now we're 1-2 in con-
ference play and usually the
winning team can afford three
or four losses in conference
play,” Burris said.

“If we can’t reschedule the
games then we may not be able
to afford any more losses in con-
ference play,’ Burris con-
tinued.

The only question mark con-
tinues to be pitching. Marshall
Case and Frank Folger have
started in one game a piece, but
