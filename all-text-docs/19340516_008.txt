THE DAVIDSONIAN, MAY 16, 1934

Senior Auctions Will

Be Conducted Friday

Annual Sale to Be Held Before
Georgia Dormitory

Cherished lapboards, pictures and
veteran armchairs, vestiges of the van-
ishing power of the illustrious seniors,
will go under the hammer as the an-
nual senior auctions get under way in
front of Georgia Dormitory Friday
afternoon at 2:45 o'clock.

Anything from bookends to ponies
will be offered for sale and ambitious
freshmen will do well to stock up on
a miscellany of useful articles and tra-
dition, stated President F. L. Smyre
of the Senior class today. It has not
been decided whether pink lemonade
will be served, or whether a brass band
will be on hand, stated Smyre, but
every other means of promoting a hap-
py afternoon will be used.

Elections for auctioneers are now un-
der way. Brewster Grant, Mack Hol-
land, Albert Rice, Julian West and Eb
Willson were nominated at a senior
smoker last week, two of whom will
get the call. It is traditional for the
auctioneers to appear in formal attire
—with silk hat, gloves and cane.

Smyre stated that all articles will be
sold on the basis of the highest bidder.
Seniors who wish to sell articles but
wish to use them until after examina-
tions may do so if agreeable to the
buyer,

Frosh Linksmen Finish
Season With Charlotte

After a very late start, a freshman
golf team was organized this year at
Davidson for the first time in a number

of years. Coach “Doc” Newton was
responsible for its organization, and
under his supervision two. matches

were secured—one with the Salisbury
High School, state high school cham-
pions this year, and one with the Uni-
versity of North Carolina freshmen,
whe can always boast a strong team.
Another match, which will have been
played when this paper goes to press,
has been arranged with the Charlotte
High School team. This match will
probably close the season due to the
approach of the examination period.

The team of four men‘was chosen
by their performance in the 36-hole
qualifying rounds and also what they
did in the early practice rounds. The
four men who successfully qualified for
the teams were as follows: Charles
Ross, acting captain and No. 1 player,
from Charlotte; Ralph McClelland,
from Atlanta, Ga., No. 2; George Cow-
an, Charlotte, No. 3, and Carter Gen-
nett, Asheville, No. 4. All these -men
are capable of good individwal scores
in the high seventies and low eighties,
but due to the fact that they were un-
accustomed to playing together and by
reason of the fact that they played on
courses totally unfamiliar to them, they
were unable to win any of their first
matches. The frosh lost to Salisbury
by a score of 12 to 9, and suffered a
defeat at the hands of Carolina by a
score of 11 to 7. The match with the
Charlotte team will be played under
more agreeable circumstances, where
all the players are familiar with the
course; and it is believed that they will
show up well and will play the golf
of. which they are capable.

The freshman linksmen will furnish
much competition for positions on the
varsity squad next year—especially in
Ross, who has just finished a most suc
cessful week in the Carolina Amateur
Tournament in Charlotte. He fought
his way to the semi-finals in the cham-
pionship division, only to be beaten at
the hands of Cliff Perry, Duke ace.

eliminated early in the voting.

Grier Martin, representing the Alum-
ni Association, gave a talk on joining
that particular association.

The election of the permanent class
president was held, Fred Smyre and
Julian West tieing for first place. The
deciding vote of the class has not been
held as yet, but will be in the near
future. This president is to have charge
of all class meetings in future years.

As has also been the custom in past
years, the Senior class~-plays the fac-
ulty in baseball at the end of each
year. Mack Holland was elected cap-
tain of the Senior baseball team.

It was decided that *“Lead On, O
King Eternal” was to be the class song,
which will probably be sung at the last
chapel exercise. About seventy seniors
were present, and refreshments and
smokes were served after all the busi-
ness had been settled.

zier,

The ‘Cats journeyed to Blacksburg
and avenged their lone defeat by
handing Virginia Tech a 67 to 59 lick-
ing. A new high scoring mark at
Miles Stadium was set by Ras Evans,
who made 19 points with firsts'in the
220-yard dash, quarter-mile, low hur-
dies, and a tie for first in the 100-yard
dash. Pierce threw the javelin 175
feet, 4 inches for a first in that event,
while Frazier, McPhail and Cochrane
made important contributions to the
victory.

Davidson walked away with Wofford,
defeating them 107 to 19 on Richard-

son Field. The Wildcats took twelve
first places out of fourteen events and
tied for another in the high jump. In
four events the Davidson team made a
clean sweep, while in seven others they
took the first two places. High point
men were, Evans and McPhail.

After retaining a lead up until the
last event, Davidson’s strong cinder
squad was finally forced into a 63-63
deadlock with the Duke University
track team. Frazier again lowered his
record in the mile and topped off his
performance by taking a first place in
the two-mile run. John Lee also shared
in the record-breaking honors by rais-
ing his pole vault mark to 12 feet.
Evans again led the scoring with a
total of 15 points.
