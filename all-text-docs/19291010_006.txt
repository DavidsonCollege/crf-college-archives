ADDITIONAL ALUMNI DEATHS

(Continued from Page Five)
J. R. Cannon, '13

Junius Ross Cannon, ’39, died in a Char-
lotte hospital on September 8, following an
illness that extended over several years. He
was a resident of York, S. C., where he had
gone in 1914, after spending some time in
New York city. He was actively connected
with the Cannon Manufacturing Company,
of York, subsidiary of the Cannon Mills at
Concord, but was forced to retire from parti-
cipation four years ago because of ill health,
and since that he had lived in retirement at
York,

Mr. Chas. A. Cannon, '15, of. Concord, is
a brother and Davidson alumnus who is
among the survivors.

H. B. McNair, Jr., '26
Henry B. McNair, Jr., age 26, was acci-
dently killed at his home in Tarboro on July
9. First reports stated that he had com-
mitted suicide, but this was later found to
be an error. He had been talking to his
father on the front porch, his usual normal
self, and said that he intended to sleep a
while. A few minutes later the report of a
shot was heard, and Mr. McNair was found
to be dead. He had recently been employed

Norfolk, Va.

did not assume serious proportions at any
time.

Although the Davidson offensive flashed
brilliantly at times, it was not able to func-
tion smoothly throughout the game. Only in
the first and fourth quarters did the Wild-
cats place the ball in scoring position, having
to be content to keep it around midfield most
of the game, or to let their opponents have
it. They looked good in their first quarter
march but could not seem to get started after
that.

The whole Davidson backfield played a
good game. Red Parrish went in: for Mc-
Queen and matched the work of the start-
ing backs. The defensive work, especially on
passes, was greatly improved over what it
has been. Only two heaves were completed
by the Methodists. Brock continued to play
his usual excellent game at end. Bill Mason
also comes in for mention in intercepting the
pass that paved the way for the lone David-
son touchdown.

For Wofford, Inabinet at center proved to
be a power in the line, as was Carrol at end.
Jackson backed up the line in a stellar man-
ner and stopped several Davidson runs before
they could go very far.

It could easily be seen from the play of
the ’Cats was not up to the standard of the
Clemson game the’ week before. If it had
been, the score would doubtless have been
much larger in their favor.

BROWN ANALYZES

(Continued from page 1)

istic attitude would never adjust the situation.
His second point was to the effect that
capitalists of North Carolina and the South
must not boast of cheap labor and of the
docility of their workmen. The southern
states must try to convince the world that
labor conditions here are good, and capital
and labor must be seen to go hand in hand.
Thirdly, Doctor Brown saw in organized
labor “the natural and inevitable accom-
paniment of industrial growth.” He urged
the members of the Kiwanis Club not to
think of organized labor as an attempted
coalition to be fought against, but as a tan-
gible entity to be dealt with.

Finally, everyone, workers, capitalists, and
onlookers, must develop a more charitable
attitude, according to Doctor Brown. “The
trouble lies in that the people are allowing
themselves to be whipped into a frenzy.”
Both are right, and both are wrong, he
urged. Doctor Brown exemplified his mean-
ing by stating that he could see the table in
front of him as it appeared from one side,
but that to the people opposite him, its
shape appeared entirely different. Nothing is
to be gained by fiery dealings; the solution
will come only by cool-headed consideration.
Before entering upon the discussion of his

subject, Doctor Brown was careful to adduce
as his qualification for discoursing upon the
topic his position of neutrality. He mentioned
also that his remarks were nof to be inter-
preted as a detailed exposition of the situa-
tion, but merely as cursory observation of
the facts.

Other attractions at the dinner were solos
by five students from the college on their
several instruments.
