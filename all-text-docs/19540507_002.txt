A Student Problem: To Jack Up a Battered
Hulk ... Or To Build a New Constitution

The debates, talks, or whatever they
were in chapel Wednesday morning may
have done little to bring the proposed
Crutchfield amendments closer to the goal
or to the grave, but they did point up
one thing that needs broadening. The new
amendments without a doubt stem from
the highest ideals and reasoned thoughts
of their authors. Their passage would,
probably, be a needed strength to the
present hulk of student government.

But the thing that most people did not,
and still do not realize about the amend-
ments is that they would be additional
tonnage added to an old scow of a Con-
stitution that is so heavy in itself that
most students are loath to read it for fear
of losing their position in modern time.
There is scarcely an article beyond the
first that giving the name of the organiza-
tion, that is not so outdated as to be use-
less or in some cases funny.

We do not mean to appear sacreligious
in referring to the Constitution, but in
that it does not presume to be as
grounded in tradition as Marshal Ney or
George we would like to suggest that it
be martyred, that is, that it be scuttled
liked the French Navy, quickly and
quietly.

Though the proposed amendments have
the best end of the students at heart, they
are of the old school in design, trying
vainly to add a streamlined touch to an
outdated vessel that is now, after four
major patching jobs and many years of
gathering barnacles, strictly beyond re-
pair.
Should the overburdened Student
Council be aided by the relieving of its
honor responsibility by the formation of
an honor court? Perhaps. But the amend-
ments were proposed, it was said, to give
the Student Government the power to
regulate student affairs in a well organ-
ized and dependable way, with a measure
of wider student participation. Have the
amendments really done either of these
things. Six more students would take an
active part in the judgment of honor
cases, and there would be a division of
power so that, theoretically at least, the
Student Council could spend more time
on the constructive side of college affairs
than on the disciplinary.

But with the very amendments that

were to strengthen the Constitution there
was a failure, while the whole student
body seethed with interest, to go any
deeper than the surface pertaining to the
immediate problem of discipline. While
the authors complained of the inadequacy
of the Constitution and demanded that
something be done this year while things
were still hot about it, they failed to make
the slightest move toward shaving from
the Constitution some of the main things
that make it look so silly in the eyes of
all concerned with it. |

Was mention made of the outdated
point system and its impossible simplicity
in the distribution of points or of the
eighth article, which remains valid in 1954
and promises to remain in effect in 1955,
even though the Student Store has become
a figment of the imagination. Complaints
have been voiced as to the present elec-
tion system at Davidson, but not one word
was mentioned in the amendments about
changing it.

In defense the student in favor of the
proposed amendments might well say
that they were purposely limited to the
direct problem of student government as
such. But why would someone so in-
terested in seeing things get done this
year while the students are interested fail
to realize that a revivifying of the Con-
stitution itself, bringing it out of the dark
ages as a whole is vitally important to its
functioning as an effective mechanism of
Student Government. If interest will be
lost next year, why not do the whole thing
this year. If. the thing is too big to do
this year, why go off half cocked with a
few punitive measures that. will go over-
board with any reorganization of student
government that sets up a legislature for
open meetings or any other new body not
included in the present Constitution or
amendments.

It is definitely too late in the term to
go into any major revision of the Consti-
tution this year. Next year, however, the
student body should be able to start off
with a clean slate early in the fall and
draw up a constitution which, though it
may use the present one as an old-
fashioned model, will not be so riddled
with inadequacies and obsolescences as to
make it too cumbersome and ineffective
for smooth sailing.

A Study In Filth and Wastefulness

Shocked looks and muffled voices on
the part of visitors to the College Union
have not been rarities lately. Little minds
seem to have been at work again, this time
turning useful signs into billboards of
blasphemies and foul language to be put
to the gaze of everyone who enters the
Union.

The recent fad of changing the black
and white announcements into proclama-
tions which will cause red faces to those
who read them sets no new low in student
thought; however, it seeks no new level
above the common current of apathy
concerning thoughtfulness for others.

There is really no point in delivering a
sermon on the virtues of steering clear of
vile language for use where it might be
seen by the general public. No doubt the
student or students who change the Union
signs do it solely for the “benefit” of those
who will come, see the handiwork, and
drop one rung lower in respect for David-
son as a result. Some minds are built that
way. There is one point, however, in ask-
ing those who have no part in the chang-
ing of the signs to have a part in carefully
changing them back. It could well be
called as great a wrong to see the dirt and

‘not clean it up as to put it there in the
first place.

If one is not interested in hearing of the

sins of changing signs, perhaps he would
be more prone to listen to the practical

argument for letting things be. The signs
are put in the Union for announcement
purposes, not as playthings. They are
bought at the expense of the Union and
serve the students in a very important
way. The days are complicated enough
with the announcements of things to
come; when those announcements are
mutilated students easily go crazy trying
to do their daily tasks.

At seventeen cents per letter, costs
mount when day by day brutish hands
maltreat the weak composition of the
Union’s white alphabet. If the students
must destroy something which the new
Union budget will not be able to replace,
let them at least destroy something that
is not useful to them, if there is any such
thing in the Union.

Two weeks remain in the school term,
and editorializing is probably of little ef-
fect. Students should remember, how-
ever, that the last two weeks and the
commencement time will be times in
which many visitors come to the campus
and in which all students tend to wander
in a fog wondering what will happen next.

A little thought on the part of a few
could do away with a lot of trouble on

the part of many, and could gain a higher

respect for the inner workings of the |

Davidson student-from those who view
him from without the walls.

THE DAVIDSONIAN

OFF-MOORINGS :

Moore Urges Realistic
Requirements Policy

By JIM MOORE

One of the many areas of which
student observations on Davidson
are more or less left untouched
is that of the curriculum and the
course requirements.

At the mid-semester your writer
said that he would investigate Da-
vidson as a unit in our society. A
great part of our school’s contribu-
tion is the educational training
that her students receive.

A college must necessarily con-
tribute to its age and must corre-
spond its educational opportunities
to the needs of her students and
patrons. Davidson has an obliga-
tion in living up to its liberal
arts heritage and its Christian
character.

Within the framework of these
two precepts there.is adequate
room to determine current needs
and fulfillmnt of those needs. For
a great many years the education-
al goals of Davidson have been
satisfied in the same or similar
manner.

The attempt has been made
through the courses required for
graduation to broaden the student’s
interest and knowledge by making
compulsory those courses that ex-
perience has shown to be the basic
ones for a liberal arts education.

The assumption has been that
in the specified fields required,
an adequate cultural development
would be open to students so that
later upperclass major work would
be undertaken after the broader
introductory courses have been
gotten aside.

These required courses vary
with the degree being pursued, but
they basically are these: algebra
and trigonometry, Bible, history,
foreign language, ROTC, a science
course, and English.

One shortcoming of our system
is that so much time is taken up
in the first two years with these
required courses that the last two
years have courses in the major
field which are introductory
courses.

All of these required courses
can be attacked on one ground or
another and be shown to fall short
of the goal of the liberal arts de-
velopment that is desired.

Courses Required For
Graduation

The only real reason mathe-
matics is still required at David-
son is a pragmatic one. It is high-
ly useful in preparing students to
pass the deferment test for the
selective service,

ROTC is the necessity of our
times, and as once pointed out,
puts the Christian college in an
embarrassing position as to the
reasons for including it in the cur-
riculum.

As far as these first two go, one

LETTER TO THE EDITOR:

Study Urged For

Union Discussion

Dear Editor

This Sunday the students of
Davidson and the public are in-
vited to hear a discussion on the
proposed union of the Southern
(U.S.) and the Northern (U.S.A.)
branches of the Presbyterian
Church.

This discussion will be led by
Dr. C. G. McClure and Dr. Jas. A.
Jones. Dr. McClure will take the
negative view and Dr. Jones will
give his views on why we should
unite with our Northern “breth-
ren.” This discussion should be
very interesting, and I want to
urge all of the Presbyterians in
and around Davidson to attend.

The reason I am writing you this
letter, Mr. Editor, is to tell the
folks who are planning to attend
this meeting to “bone up” on just
what kind of Presbyterian Faith
that they have. (I would suggest
that they look into this plan of
union and decide on just which
side of the fence they plan to
stand.

The discussion wil) be much more
interesting if the students have
studied the plan, and they will be
better equipped to ask questions
pertaining to it.

I recently attended a discussion
held at the First Presbyterian
Church in Concord which was led
by Dr. Nelson Bell, associate edi-
tor of The Southern Presbyterian
Journal, and Colonel Miller. It was
very informative, and my only re-
gret was that I hadn’t studied the
plan more carefully.

It is with this in mind that I
urge you to learn the full sig-
nificance of the plan and to be
sure to attend this discussion.

rll see you on the front row.

Yours in fundamentalism,
DAVE LONG.

man has summed up my feeling
on the matter when he said, “If
it takes a war to justify a thing,
I'd say it’s not worth anything.”

The science course must be a
single science and cannot include
a broad introduction to science de-
signed for students not interested
in majoring in the field. It cannot
be so because no such course is
offered.

The English and history courses
are so median in nature that they
take in a good many facets of the
subject, but are so broad general-
ly and so deep specifically as to
provide little in the way of stimu-
lation to the uninitiated and often-
times direct frustration to the
genuinely interested.

The foreign language require-
ment is one that is difficult to un-
specialize, but there does seem a
great opportunity to pursue more
of the history and development of
the languages of the world than is
presently undertaken.

Bible and Religion

Bible is one subject that it is
necessary to treat separately be-
cause of its close association with
the attempt here to indoctrinate
in students the Christian approach
to life.

As long ago as 1926 there was
criticism of the Bible courses as
they were organized at that time.
In those days the two years were
required but with the difference
that three semesters were devoted
to the Old Testament and one to
the New.

Robert L. Kelly, writing in
Christian Education for May, 1926,
said, “Especial attention should be
called to what appears to be the
disproportionate amount of time
placed in Bible study of the Old
Testament.”

The aspects of compulsory Chris-
tianity have other unattractive
points for criticism in chapel, ves-

pers, and YMCA membership but
on the level of scholarship, Bible
study has slowly fallen victim to
changing attitudes and evaluations.
There are few colleges in the
country today which still require
two full years of Bible. The sur-
vey of Davidson which was made
last year by the management en-
gineering firm in one of its recom-
mendations said,“One year of Bible
should be required and a second
year offered as an alternative.”
If there is such a strong desire
for two years of Bible, there would
seem to be more avenues for stu-
dent understanding of what Chris-
tianity is and how it stands up in
comparison to other religions by

having a comparative religion
course required for the second
year, The first year would take up
the entire Bible. .

The Princeton Concept

The particular way in which Da-
vidson fails in its attempt to in-
terpret the liberal arts goal is in
its very compulsion of specified
liberal arts courses.

When the philosophy of educa-
tion at Davidson is compared to
that of Princeton, you are bound
to get differences, because of the
difference in the college and the
university.

Searching deeper for the under-
lying motives, however, one finds

in the northern college than is
found in ours.

Their concept is one of freedom
within the framework of what is

fine four areas in which certain
basic work must be completed in
the first two years of the student's
residence at Princeton. >

These four broad areas are
Natural Sciences, Social Science,
Arts and Letters, and the fourth
less general heading of History,
Philosophy and Religion.

At Davidson there is conformity
wherever one turns—in religion, in
social activities, in honorary or-
