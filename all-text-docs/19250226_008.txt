On last Friday night
Club held a meeting with Dr. C. R. Hard-
ing as’ the speaker of the occasion. Dr.
Harding who is the professor of Greek
in the college has also had quite a bit
of experience as correspondent for dif-
ferent journals and was able to give
some first-hand and practical informa-
tion. In the first place, the speaker
pointed out seevral ways in which the
reporter is benefited by the work he
contributes to the college paper. He
showed that working as a reporter was
of great good to both those who intend
to be journalists and those who do not

In speaking of reportorial work Dr.
Harding particularly stressed the im-
portance of the reporter's reading a great
deal but at the same time to be very
careful as to what he reads. He gave
to those present the very A. B. C. Cs in
reportorial work, showing how anyone
might make a success and why it was

the Reporters’

Marked success attended a series of
evangelistic services conducted last week
in the Presbyterian Church by Dr. W.
C. Black and his song leader, Mr. Burr.

Meetings were held both morning and
evening, every day last week, each meet-
ing being attended by a goodly number
of townspeople and college students.
The Methodists and Baptists shared in
the meeting.

Dr. Black is the Synodical evangelist
for North Carolina, He has been in this
kind of work for thirty-one years and
has thousands of converts to his credit
in this state. Davidson feels that
was fortunate in securing him to hold
this meeting. Because of his» inspiring
sermons he is always in demand. Those
who heard him were aware that his sub-
ject was always “The Gospel” and his ob-
ject to save souls for Christ. Some of
the subjects that Dr. Black expounded
were: “And He came to Himself ;”
“Prepare to Meet ~Thy God;” “For
What is: Your Life?” “And Lot Pitched
His Tent Toward Sodom;” “What
Shall We Do With Jesus?”

Mr. Burr, the singer, has been with Dr.
Black in this work for thirty years. He spniqn,
achieved good results both from his
special music and his leading the con-
gregation in choruses. He was assisted |
in the special music by Mrs. Daugherty, |
Mrs. Martin, Miss Finlayson, Gray and |
Franklin.

Davidson prides herself, as do many |
colleges, on college spirit and college tra- |
ditions. As to spirit, it must be admitted |
that, as a rule her teams are hard-fight-
ing, but the student body has this year |
given the teams but poor support, espe- |
cially in basketball. As to traditions these
might be counted on the fingers of one |
hand, and are not very strongly adhered |
to by quite a large group of students. |
Only a few courses in the curriculum are |
stimulating to original thought and inter - |
est, as taught. Another Davidson boast |
is that the student body is 100 per cent |
Christian, the
membership.

Saturday night the Davidson team met its |
only defeat when the Generals won 33-18 in |
their final appearance on the Lexington !
court. The Wildcats were overcome by a |
faster and more smoothly working crew and |
throughout the entire game were forced to |
trail behind a good margin. |

Captain Lake led the scoring of the Wash- |
ington and Lee team with 14 points, while |
Herdon and Wilson were runners up, Wilson |
showing up nicely at guard. |

The score at the end of the first half was |
15-8 with the Generals leading. In the final |
period the home team used a good number of
substitutes. |
