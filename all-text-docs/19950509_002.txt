Bill Gullan makes
statement about
smoking: he quits
Although noone could believe
it, Bill Gullan announced on his
weekly WALT radio town meet-
ing that he will no longer smoke.
He is committing his life to good

health and waking up early for
morning jogs.

Chad Lloyd has had a change of
heart. He has committed his life
to campaigning for the liberal
agenda in the North or maybe in
California. He says, "I might
even give up hunting.”

"There are only 6 women

women feel strongly because
they know the SGA is where all

“The SGA Olympics: A Lesson in Survival”

By Brejas Rud

On Sunday, May 7th, 33 dedi-
cated and determined Student Gov-
ernment members traveled to
Richardson field to compete in the
first annual SGA Olympics. Com-
ing off the heels of “SGA Day,”
the troops had little time to prepare
for the event. But with a renewed
responsibility towards their con-
stituents, few doubted their desire
to thrive.

A minor setback occurred be-
fore the day even began: the bus
carrying the competitors broke
down in front of Rusk House.
While most senators walked the
last tenth-mile, President Bill
Gullan, with lighter in hand and
Marlboro in mouth,. opted to wait
for the next vehicle.

As soon as Vice-President War-
ren Buford sensed a quorum on the
field, he made his move. With a
cry of, ‘“Now/’m President!” War-
ren motioned that Davidson Col-
lege move to his native Kenya. In

"Man, this thing can move.’

the closest SGA vote ever, the pro-
posal failed by seventeen votes.

The first event—the 100-yard
dash—featured five fierce sprint-
ers searching for glory. Following
a last-minute scratch from Sara
Beth Hamlin due to,a hamstring
she pulled while stretching, the
remaining five racers lined up from
left to right: Eric Rosenbach, B.J.
Rudell, Doug Neumann, Will
Cowan, and Chad Lloyd. A heavy
gust of wind lifted Doug to an easy
victory. Second-place Chad pro-
tested the race because it was gov-
ernment-funded. Will came in
third, but could have fared better
had he not stopped at the 60-meter
mark to shoot a deer. Rounding
out the group, Eric edged out B.J.—
again.

Ashley Tabb won the javelin
throw without breaking a sweat.
He later commented, “I was in-

Troiano, who served the SGA like

aspire to fill, whose spirit lives on
in me every Tuesday at 9:00pm.”
Nearby, David Derrick wept: “That
was beautiful, Ashley.” Dennis
Seavers also wept, not in remem-
brance, but in pain; although his
javelin sailed 200 yards; Dennis
forgot to let go before throwing it.
The basketball game was moved
from the Adriana Ortega Court
behind Apartment F to the old one
near the track; it appears that some
students parked their cars on the
new court in protest. More com-
plications arose when, in the spirit
of Krazy Kats, several spectators
sporting “Psycho Psenators” t-
shirts were granted preferred
courtside seating. ;
Gautam Srinivasan, not known
for kindling controversy, ignited a
public outcry with his triumph in
the shot-put. Pre-event favorite,

Student Health Center finds

cure for deadly disease

Investigative reporters

Director of the Student Health
Center Dr. David Staton announced
this week at a press conference that
researchers at the Student Health
Center have recently discovered a
cure for a dreaded disease that has
killed thousands.

“This is amajor medical break-
through,” said Staton, as he an-
nounced that the bacteria which
causes Parvo has finally been iso-
lated and a vaccine developed.

ally.

The announcement led to an
angry outcry from students. Lead-
ing the campaign was outgoing
Senior Class President B.J.
Ruddell, headed for the NBA
thanks to dll that practice he got on
the new outdoor basketball courts.
“This is an outrage,” Ruddell says.
“The Student Health Center is ex-
actly that: for students. If they
want to do veterinary research,
that’s fine. But don’t neglect the
humans.” ~*

In response, Staton said,
“Once we discovered that humans

- cannot possibly get Parvo, we put

all of our efforts into developing a
cure for it.”

“We apologize to the
Davidson College community for
our lack of knowledge about and
general neglect of humans. But we
felt that research into canine dis-
eases was morally imperative,”
Staton says.

The Student Health Center
announced two days after the press
conference that they will now turn
to research on human diseases,
becuase as Staton said, "Very few
dogs are insured, so doggie re-
search just doesn't pay. We know
that now .’Studies will begin on a
number of sexually transmitted dis-
eases in the next week. Some of
those scheduled to be analyzed in-
clude “The Clap” and gonorrhea.

College Health Educator
Georgia Ringle comments, “Now
that we are going to study humans,
we’ ve decided to start with some-
thing that affects 85% of college
students: sexually transmitted dis-
eases.”

“We have anticipated this shift
to STDs for nearly a semester,”
Ringle says. “That’s why we’ve

put up nearly 50,000 flyers trying
to scare people into thinking that
they have an STD. That way,
they’ll hopefully come in to be
tested, and we can experiment on
them and use them for case stud-
ies.”

The aim of the campaign is to
make everyone thimk they have
the clap. So far it hasbeen success-
ful. One female upperclassman
says, “After I had that movement,
I was positive I had The Clap. I
mean, those flyers are every-
where.”

After learning of their suc-
cess, the Student Health Center
plans to step up the level of propa-
ganda. New signs have slogans
like, “You have The Clap! Come
in and get tested or die,” or “If you
didn’t select the proper contracep-
tive method from the Wheel, you
are infected with The Clap! Come
in immediately for
experimentation....uh, we mean
testing.” :

President John Kuykendall
applauds these new research ini-
tiatives. “As long as they’re done
in a Christian manner and they’re

-helping people, I’m all for it.”

Tae Kwon Do was anyone’s
contest to win. Sure, Mike Farley
is the best in the country, but
Davidson is not the rest of the
country. Being the sportsman he
is, Mike intentionally broke both
of his own legs before competing.
Saad Gul, the only chicken-herder
in the contest, eased through his
tournament bracket, while Mike
maimed three senators in his. In
the thrilling finale, however, Saad
captured the gold with a triple-
axis-roundhouse-double-loop-fi-
nesse-toe lunge, screaming, “They
don’t teach that in the SGA!”

Tug-o’-War rounded out the day
in dramatic style, as the males chal-’
lenged the females in a battle for
the ages. Buster Burk, always try-
ing to be helpful, recommended
that President Gullan be anchor.
Irritated by Buster’s innocent sug-
gestion, Bill censured him at the
next SGA meeting. The females
prevailed in the end, but not with-
out a final statement from DeVere
Kutscher: “The outcome would
have been different if Connor and
Rusk had only one rep. like the rest
of us.”

Rick Onkey moved to close the
Olympics. The motion passed with
one abstention.

Police buy
fighter jet

If you have ever had concern
about safety on campus, you can
leave your fears at home-when you
return to campus next year.
Davidson’s finest are adding anew
piece of equipment to their peace-
keeping arsenal: an F-14 tomcat
fighter jet.

This new tool of justice, which
the force endearingly refers to as
the “lil’ mule” ‘will be unveiled
during orientation and ready for
action at the beginning of next
semester. Officer Laney explains
the force’s motivation for the new
aquisition:

“Well there are always seems
to be somebody bitchin about cam-
pus security. If its not lighting, its
bike thefts. Well, we do our best,
but we have—until now-- little
equipment toback us up. Sure
we’ ve got the suzukis, but some-
times they just don’t do the trick. I
mean, some of the bike thieves we
chase can really peddle, and if you
think you can geta clean shot while
you are driving one of those things
your crazy. Anyway, the lil mule
will put an end to that. Not even
those tour Dupont guys could out-
run our little baby.”

The shiny new machine of jus-
tice, will of course have more uses
than just chasing down and oblit-
erating bike theives. Seargent
Moore is particlular excited about
how it figures into the whole park-
ing ticket experience. Next year it
seems you will get a maximum of
two tickets. If a member of the
squad finds you parked illegally
again, they are going to send in the
mule with Moore at the helm. He
explains, “There ain’t gonna be no
