™ Martin Relaxes Following

Eventful Davidson Reign

By JOHN WILLIAMS

Assoclate Editor

Grier Martin is out of the
rat-race and is glad of it.
Which is not.to say he did
not enjoy being president of
Davidson College for 10
years.

The animation he uses in
talking of his years as presi-
dent and earlier as alumni
secretary and treasurer
clearly indicates that he
loved every minute of it. In
fact it becomes increasingly
obvious that Davidson Col-
lege meant more to him than
just a job—it was his life.

But as a retired president
Martin has time to do what
he has been unabdie to do for
so long—like sitting down to
watch the World Series, mak-
ing a purely vacational trip
to New York or to the beach,

or supervising the construc-
tion of his new house on
Lorimer Road.

He is also glad to be re-
lieved of the constant pres.
sure which characterizes the
modern college president's
job. “I read with a sigh of
relief,’ he said, ‘‘the recent
article in TIME about the
pressures of the college
presidency and the other
educators ,who have retired
for similar reasons.

“It is always comforting to
know there are others who
are experiencing the same
difficulties I faced and are
reacting to them in a sim-
ilar way,"’ he added.

Martin and his wife Louise
are presently residing only
two houses away from the
president’s home, at a house
which he affectionately terms

For Selling Beverages Locally

By NORWOOD POLAND
Steff Writer

Despite trustee approval of
The Code of Responsibility
today, Hattie's apparently
won't -lose its virtual mon-
opoly on alcoholic beverage
sales to students — at least
for the time being.

A ‘survey of the towns
four restaurant owners this
week found them either un-
aware of the proposed stud-
ent rule changes or with no
immediate plans to capi:al-
ize on the rule change.

Dean Howard, who leases
the Wildcat Den frorn Coach
Lefty Driesell, expressed an
interest in obtaining a beer
permit. “It would = rzally
help the pizza business,"’ he
said. ‘Driesell, however, de-
nied any plan to apply for a
permit as of now.

beer permit. so I can’t say
how the Board would react."

The owner of the Coffee
Cup Restaurant, B. S. Sig.
mon, who managed the An-
chor Grill when it sold more
beer than Hattie’s, doubted
the Council would a::ow beer
sales in town. “On the other
hand, if the College changes
its policy the town may fol-
low suit sooner or Sater,”
Sigmon said.

Although plans to allow al.
coholic beverages on campus
include the ' College Union,
state law prohibits the sale

of these beverages on thc
grounds of an educational in-
stitution.

“This would apply whether
the college itself or Slater
Food Service does the sell-
ing,"’ said C. Shaw Smith,
coordinator of student activi-
ties.

““Brown-bagging. however,
could be permitted in the
Union, provided those in-
voived are of the legal age."
he said.

Smith said the Union Berd

that we will be able to use

‘Martin's Manor.” “When I
first came here as college
treasurer." he said, ‘“‘my
brother and I fixed this house
up for our mother, and that
is when it received the nick-
name."

In addition to a house he
purchased on Lake Norman
four years ago, which has
the “‘sandiest beach in the
neighborbood."" he is also
having a house built in the
neighborhood behind the in-
firmary, once termed
“Grier's Gulch.”

Martin tells this story with
evident relish. When he came

here as treasurer, there was -

a definite housing shortage
in Davidson.

Under a special plan which
he originated, people con-
nected with the college were
permitted to construct new
houses at a substantial re-
duction by financing them
through thé college, in an
area which was then nothing
but woods, weeds and ditch-
es,

Since then, 56 houses have
been built under the plan,
mostly for professors, and
only one of the original own.
ers has sold his house.

The irony is that Martin is
building his house on the last
available lot in the neigh-
borhood. He anticipates that
i wilt be finished around
Christmas.

Martin says his immedi-
ate future is a little clndy at
the present moment.

He has already been con.
tacted ‘by a Washington
agency to serve as an'educa-
tional consultant who would
visit several South Caro‘ina
colleges, particularly Negro
colleges, to give advice on
their financial situations and
on more effective methods
of raising money. ‘I like the
idea,’ he said, ‘‘but I have
as yet made no definite com-
mitment.”

The new president of
Davidson College. Dr. Sam-
uel R. Spencer Jr., is a close
friend of Martin's. ‘‘We both
came to Davidson in 1951,"
he said, “Sam as dean of
students and I as treasurer.

“For six summers after
that we alternated years on
taking trips to Europe on a
very economical joint plan.
My wife and I still hope to
accompany Sam and his wife
on a trip to Europe.”

What is Martin proudest of
about his administration at
Davidson? “The attitude of
the students toward me, I
guess,”’ he said. ‘In light of
the difficulties at other col-
leges, I feel very proud that
there was no trouble at
Davidson.”
