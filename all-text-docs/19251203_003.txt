Stewart Gordon says he doesn’t want
to go home this Christmas because he
will not be able to go rabbit hunting. We
asked him why, and he replied that the

death trying to get the cotton out of
their tails.

Gives Practical Course
in Educational Methods

Tests Given to Local High
Students

Dr. Noble, by adding practical work to the
classroom theories of education and psy-
chology, has made his courses among the
most interesting on the campus. The mem-
bers of his classes have recently completed
a survey of the Davidson school between the
grades of three and seven, and are now com-
piling their data for a complete case study
according to the Trabue thermometer chart.
These tests are designed to give the pupils
an understanding of their capacity to learn,
and to give their instructor a chart by which
to gauge their progress. |

The department of education has been giv-
ing an eight-hour extension course in edu-
cation and child psychology to the teachers of
the nearby towns. This class meets every
Tuesday afternoon, and now has an enroll-
ment of 25. The course offered is equivalent
to a summer school’s work on the teachers’
certificate, and is made as practical as pos-
sible; special attention being given to the
study of difficult children and of  school-
