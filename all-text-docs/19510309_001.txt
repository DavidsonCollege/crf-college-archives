Union Deputation To

Include Old Grads

Davidson will be host this Sunday
and Monday to a visiting deputa-
tion team from the Union Theologi-
cal Seminary of Richmond, Virgin-
ia. Four Davidson graduates of
recent‘ years are included on the
team. They: are Curtis Harper ‘50,
Jack Payne '49, Tommy Clark ‘49,
and Frank Lemmon '49, The team
will have charge of the YMCA
Bible class on Sunday morning,
and Jack Payne will preach at the
college church during the regular
Sunday morning service. Before re-
turning to the seminary, the entire
team will take over the Monday
chapel program. The YMCA has

Saturday, March 10 has been des-
ignated Salem-Davidson Day for
1951, Under the mutual guidance
of Miss, Ann. Hobbs, Social Chair-
man at Salem College, and Tommy
Haller, Social Chairman of David-
son’s YMCA, some sixty girls will
arrive in buses at 2:30 Saturday
in front of Chambers. Chief forms
of entertainment will consist of a
wrestling match’ Saturday after.
noon and an informal dance that
evening.

Giving such “days” in honor of
nearby girls’ colleges has become
a tinte-honored practice at David-
son. As in the past, a list of girls
to come was posted and each boy
desiring a blind date was asked to
sign his name beside that of the
girl he deemed most worthy of his
attentions. It was hoped that no
horseplay would be encountered
such as that which forced Haller
to care for thirty girls at Davidson-
W.C. Day. Haller seemed to think
this stemmed largely from boys
signing other boys’ names to the
list without informing the alleged
signee of this fact.

At three o’clock in the Johnston
Gym, top-flite inter-collegiate wrest-
ling is on tap as the AAU district
tournament draws to a close. Mat-
sters from all over the state to-

gether with several service teams’

are expected to enter and a fast-
moving set of matches is predict-
ed.

Attention will again be focused
on the gym when the Scabbard

until twelve, the dance is classified
informal. Tickets will be priced at
$1.00 for stags and $1.75 for men
who escort girls to this dance.

Elizabeth Taylor Has Stolen Bust
Awarded Her By Harvard Editors

Editors of The Harvard Crimson
want to know what Elizabeth Tay-
lor is doing with their bust.

Miss Taylor, here for a Red Cross
rally, was presented with a bust of
“Fabian Fall” before she left by
air for Hollywood today. The award
was made by the editors of the
undergraduate humor magazine,
The Lampoon.

But when editors of The Crim-
son, the Harvard Daily, learned
about the presentation, they an-
nounced that “Fabian” was theirs,
The bust, they said, was taken from
a room in the Crimson offices some-
time during the night.

The trouble began last month
when The Lampoon awarded Miss
Taylor a “Roscoe” for “so galantly
persisting in her career despite a

total inability to act.”

Then, in an apparent gesture at
reconciliation, the Lanipoon  edi-
tors met her at the airport today
and presented her with the “Fab-
ian Fall Award” for being “the act-
ress who has shown the greatest
improvement as result of the pre-
vious receipt of the Roscoe.”

Miss Taylor said, “It's very sweet
of you boys.”

The Crimson said,
back.”

Fabian Fall, the editors said, was
president of The Crimson in 1909
and the bust was kept in a room
given in the youth’s memory by his
family.

“We are working to bring about
its return,” the editors said.

AFRICAN NOVEL
REVIEWED FOR
SIGMA UPSILON

Sigma Upsilon, Davidson's na-
tional literary fraternity, opened its
meetings for the month of March
last Thursday evening at nine fif-
teen. The group met in fraternity
court at the SAE house, where for
an hour and a half the program
ran the gamut from short stories
to discussions.

Don Shriver, president of the
local chapter, opened the meeting
with further discussion of last
week's decision to join the national
Sigma Upsilon organization. As was
reported in last week's Davidsonian,
the parent organization has recent.
ly been reactivated, and Davidson
has received an invitation to join

of} with it. The question raised was

that of whether Davidson would
actually benefit from such a junc.
ture.

The literary contributions to the
mecting were made by George Bas-
on and Dave Hamilton. Bason pre-
sented an original short story,
based on that age old favorite of
story writers, “young love.” It in-
volved the usual triangle: girl falls
in iove with boy who is already in
Jove with other woman. After
reading his story, Bason “cast it
to the lions,” where it provided
“meat” for further discussion,

Dave Hamilton brought the
meeting to a close, as he took his
turn at the fraternity’s project for
the year, “The Revolt of Contem-.
porary Writers Against Material.
ism.” He furthered the project with
a study of “Cry, the Beloved Coun-
try,” Alan Paton’s novel about the
racial tensions in South Africa.

Price of Tickets
Cut For Concert

Date tickets at the reduced
price of $2,00, including tax, have
been placed on sale for the concert
of the Cincinnati Symphony Or-
chestra, here, on Saturday even-
ing, March 17. The price of these
tickets represents a reduction of
$1.00 to Davidson students from
the regular general admission price
of $3.00. :

This concert by one of America’s
oldest and finest orchestras is the
last of this year’s Davidson Artist
Series concerts. Students and facul-
ty will recall the concert by the
Cincinnati Symphony here last year
as a highlight of last year’s series.
This old orchestra is conducted by
a young and brilliant figure in the
American musical scene. Holiday
magazine, in its last issue, picked
Dr. Thor Johnson as one of the top
ten conductors in America. He will
demonstrate the brilliant interpre.
tive powers, sound musicianship,
and inspiring conducting technique
which have earned for him so dis.
tinguished a position as he con-
ducts the Cincinnati Symphony _
here next Saturday evening.

The concert will be held in Cham-
bers Auditorium and will begin at
8:15 p. m. Students wishing to
take advantage of this opportunity
to purchase date tickets at the re-
duced price are urged to come by
the Music Department Offices in
Elim Row as soon as possible since
the anticipated demand for seats
for this concert is quite large.
