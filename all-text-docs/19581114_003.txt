PETE WYRICK & “B” MILLNER

Ed. Mote: While the staff is in Chicago, the man- .
agement of this page has been turned over to the
two budding sports writers, “B” Millner and Pete
Wyrick. This column is also their work.

Nov. 1 marked the opening day of practice for
winter sports, with basketball, wrestling,
teams officially beginning afternoon drills. Before at-
tention completely turns to prospects of the indoor sea-
son, perhaps we should take a receding glance at the
fall scene.

Congratulations are in order for David Gilmour who
took individual honors at the State Cross-Country Meet,
freshmen division in Raleigh last week. Gilmour finished
first to lead the Wildkittens to a second place finish be-
hind strong Carolina. Angus McBryde also turned in a
tremendous performance as he placed fifth in varsity
action.

The 'Cat soccer squad invaded Chapel Hill today,
seeking its first victory over the ACC foes. Victories in

their two final matches against Carolina and ,Warren-;

Wilson would give the soccermen a fine record of seven
wins and four losses. Bergsma continues to lead the scor-
ing and we shall be waiting to see if some of the Wild-
cats take All-Conference honors again.

An appeal for support: Two final victories against
Richmond and Furman could give the Wildcat football
team a possible tie for the Southern Conference title.
Be there!

Nomination for pun of the week: “It looks like Coach:
Dole has Ushered in a new era in field goal importance.”

ROUNDBALL NOTES—

Coach Tom Scott’s veteran Wildcats will open their
season December 2 against one of the better teams in
the ACC—Bones McKinney’s Wake Forest Deacons.

Last year the Deacons, composed mainly of sopho-
mores and juniors, came on near the end of the season |
to scare the wits out of some of the ACC powers. Much}
of their success this year will depend on how well Jerry |
Steele. a 6’ 8’, 240 pound center can move around in
the pivot. Last year’s fine pivot man, 6’ 7’ David Budd.
has moved over to forward.

Dr. Scott rates the ’58 freshman crop a shade better
‘overall than last season’s squad which ran up a very
.stiecessful record with the now defunct Jay Vee team.
The Kittens, coached by Joc Hunt, play, home and-home
games with Wake Forest, Furman, the Citadel, and Pheif-
fer, plus several contests with junior college varsity

squads. Hunt's boys are big and the speed is provided by|i™JUry:

a cat-quick guard from Indiana named Jerry Bussel.

Perhaps the Intramural Sports Council should take
another look at their ruling that athletes out for a sport
for more than twenty days are ineligible to participate in
that sport for their fraternity.

In several sports. particularly basketball, the coaches
often do not cut excess players. until after practicing a
month or more. Thus, if a boy is cut from the team after
the 20-day timit he cannot play fraternity ball. This seems
to defeat the council’s objective of participation for all
those who cannot play on a varsity team.

and swimming!
