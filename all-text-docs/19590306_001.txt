includes interviews and tests.

These men, who are staying
at the Guest House, will mect
for separate interviews with the
following members of the
scholarship committee: Dr. Mc-
Gavock, Dr. Bevan, Dr. Ratliff,
Dr. Fredericksen, Professor

Voluntary Chapel
Shows Progress

Scott Woodmansee,
Chairman: of the YMCA’s
Spiritual Life Committee,
reported early this week
that “I think the results of
the voluntary chapel pro-
gram have been encourag-
ing. I know there are a lot
of boys interested.”

The idea was conceived be-
cause of the poor worship at-
mosphere in the regular chapel
services. It is intended to pro-
vide an opportunity for faculty,
administration, and students
alike to worship under the
proper conditions.

The twenty minute service
is held every Monday and
Wednesday morning at 10:20
in Lingle Chapel. Students of
the Committee plan and con-
duct the devotionals. A dif-
ferent student leads each ser-
vice.

In the past such voluntary
programs have failed because
of lack of student participation.
This is not the case, so far, with
the 1959 version. Since the pro-
gram’s initial service in early
February several dozen of the
student body members have at-

tended its devotionals regular-

ly.

Jim Black will be in charge
next Monday and Wesley
Weeks on Wednesday.

ners varies according to fi-
nancial resources and qualifi-

Dean of Students and Secre-
tary of the Scholarship Com-

Also voted on and approved
Tuesday were two amendments
to the Student Body Constitu-
tion; the effect of which will
be to modify the plan of voting
in spring elections and to re-
move two offices from student
elections completely.

The first amendment changes
Section 4 of the By-Laws to the
Student Body Constitution to
read:

“There shall be five phases
in Student Body elections: (1)
Student Body Officers; (2)
Honor Court; (3) Class Prosi-
dents; (4) Freshman Advisor,
Y.M.C.A., and Publications;

(5) Student council Repre-
sentatives,”

The other amendment added
the following to the By-Laws as
Section 6:

“Athletic Council repre-
sentatives and Head Cheer-
leader will be appointed by
the Student Council within
fifteen (15) days of Student
Body elections.”

These amendments took ef-
fect immediately, and the re-
mainder of this elections per-
iod will be conducted accord-
ing to the new plan.

Florida Presbyterian
Welcomes New Ideas

Dabney ;

By DICK SMITH
Davidsonian Managing Editor

“The educational challenge today is not merely to provide another good school

’

but to provide one which will give an education of quality.” So stated Dr. John M.
Bevan, Dean of Faculty of Florida Presbyterian College, in a DAVIDSONIAN inter-

view last Wednesday.

Accordingly, the administra-
tion’ of the new college in St.
, Petersburg, Florida, has exam-
ined a large number of Ameri.
can colleges and universities .in
attempting to answer this chal-
lenge.

Dr. Bevan went on, “We have
found a terrific esprit-de-corps
.in all institutions trying to mo-
idernize their teaching methods.
'We are convinced that, starting
a new school as we are, we have
a decided advantage over other
colleges,

“We can plan our physical
plant around our educational
concepts, and consequently
won't have the problem of
expending a fot of energy
trying to catch up with mo-
dern methods. We have the
chance to start big.’

The new college’s curriculum
will be designed to meet the
individual’s needs, and each
man will have the chance to
plan his course of study as will
best suit his future interests.
Dr. Bevan, using the pre-med
program as an example, stated
“Our program will be nothing
like the one here at Davidson
with its one set’ pattern of
courses.

“If a man wants to go to a
particular med school, we look

pointed out, as the loser each| at that school’s curriculum and
week is eliminated with the | entrance ‘requirements. We give

week.

ithere. There will not be any

duplication of ‘med school
courses.

“This is not to say, however,
that we will not offer other
courses that this particular
student would like to take. He
could take these as electives,
but not as graduation require-
ments. So this man has his
course of pre-med study all
mapped out.

“Along comes another stu-
dent interested in another
med school. We look at its re-
quirements and courses, and
may recommend en entirely
different study curriculum.
This is a tailor-made educa-
tion, and it is the kind that
Florida Presbyterian will of-
fer.

“The new school's education-
al concepts have been planned
in accordance with three fac-
tors. First, we want to maintain
faculty dependence and _ inter-
dependence. Accordingly, we
won't have any department, as
such.
maintain curriculum depth as
well as width, and our third
will be the emphasis of inde-
pendent student study.

“The standard of faculty-
student ratio in determining
the quality of a school is com
pletely outmoded, Under this
system, Davidson has a ratio
of about ten to one. How
many classes are there with
ten students in them? You
see, that criterion breaks

down rather quickly. Besides,
the cast of maintaining such
a faculty could easily be pra-
hibitive.

“Our plan-is, with modern
teaching methods, to cut down
the size of the faculty, and by
doing so, we can afford. to pay
really good men to teach. One
of these methods is to use stu-
dents to help teach other stu-
dents. Seniors will lead
seminars, be lab instructors.
and so forth. In a sense, they
will be considered part of the
college faculty, and we may
put their name on division sta-
tionary.

He went on to say that “there
is no reason under the sun that
this system could not be tried
at Davidson.”

Each year every professor
will submit a prospectus of a
seminar course he would like
to teach in the coming year.
These folders would be avail-
able to students. A certain
number of these courses will
be required for graduation,
and each will have no more
than fifteen students.

Also required of all students
will be a course in Western
Civilization, carrying four
hours’ credit. A large lecture
class will meet four times a
week, and groups of fifteen will
meet for discussion twice a
week,
