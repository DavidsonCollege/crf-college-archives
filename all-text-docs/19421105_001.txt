plans for the week-end.' Sandifer

share of the changes.

Shift To Charlotte

Not that this year’s set will be
but the.usual order of
things has ernie undergone a
shift to meet the situation. Every
change made has two sides and the
good counteracts the bad.

For example, the decoration, con-
test among | the various fraternities,
which has been abandoned, and the
removal of the game to Charlotte
may seem unfortunate to some of us,
but on the other hand, practically
all of the students and their dates
are spending the whole_week-end in
Charlotte. This mass migration to
the Queen City will greatly reduce
the amount of travel by the elimina-
tion of the numerous trips between
Charlotte and Davidson which were
previously required. j

Better Dances”

As for the dances themselves,
my opinion they should be above
those of the past. The band for
Home-Coming has always beef of
the same caliber as the one for this
year's set, but this year there are
two orchestras instead of the usual
one. Those upperclassmen who at-
tended—last year’s -Spring Set--will
remember the solid swing which
was produced by Satterfield, and

_reports_from past performances

clearly show that Ted Ross has an
experienced crew that should be
“in the groove” every minute.

The flush notices have certainly
not been hampered by the war.
They are coming in steadily and
add a touch of the old time flavor to
the set. One unfortunate Frosh com-

Throughout the nation there ha:

leges and universities. Many girls’
colleges have complied withthe re-

in this matter for Davidson until the
called meeting of the Association of

American Colleges in Philadelphia
last week. He and the Administra-
tive Coitimittee of the College have

decided that there will be no changes
made in the original plans of David-
son, and that classes will be held
until Friday, December 18 at 12:30
P. M. The Christmas recess will
end at 8:25 Ay M. January 5. _

In commenting on this decision,
Dr. Cunningham calls attention to
the fact that the majority of stu-
dents are from North Carolina and
would--not. use the through.-trains-
for their passage to and from home.
Since the chief reason for the
lengthening of the holidays Was to
avoid congestion on the railroads,
he does not believe this considera-
tion enters so largely into the mat-
ter for Davidson.
