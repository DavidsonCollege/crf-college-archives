Sam Ragan Fine Arts Award

By JoHN DuNwoopy
Staff Writer

Tony Abbott, Professor of
English and Humanities, was
awarded the Sam Ragan Arts

Award September 19, in a cer-
emony at St. Andrews Presbyte-
rian College.

The Ragan Awards recognize
artistic excellence and dedication
to furthering the arts in North Caro-
lina.

They are named for the state’s
former Poet Laureate, who died
earlier this year. This marked the
16th year of their presentation.

St. Andrews College Presi-
dent Dr. Warren Board presented
Abbot’s award, and Stephen Smith,
editor of the St. Andrews journal,
Sandhills Review, read a selection
of Ragan’s poems atthe ceremony.

Ron Bayes, chairman of the
Ragan Awards Committe, said
Abbott is a shining example of

long-time service to the state’s ar-
tistic community.

“T can’t think of a finer ex-
ample of leadership that crosses all
the literary genres — anywhere,
not just in North Carolina,” Bayes
said. “His poetry blends sensitiv-
ity with insight and frequently with
a wonderful, mordant sense of hu-
mor.”

Abbott has served the literary

. arts as a writer, teacher and organi-

zational leader.

He joined the Davidson fac-
ulty in 1964 and served as chair of
the English department from 1989-
1996. He has served as president
of the North Carolina Writers Net-
work, chaired this summer’s meet-
ing of the N.C. Writers Confer-
ence, and served as judge and
speaker for the O. Henry Literary
Festival.

In 1989 Abbott was nomi-
nated for a Pulitzer Prize for his
first collection of poems, The Girl
in the Yellow Raincoat (St.
Andrews Press). His second col-
lection, A Small Thing Like .a
Breath, received an award from
the North Carolina Arts Council.
He has won numerous awards for
poetry published in literary maga-
zines, and has directed seven plays
forthe Davidson Community Play-
ers. Abbott received his under-
graduate degree from Princeton
University and his M.A. and Ph.D.
from Harvard.

attention on history, art history,
and literature.

schools in Costa Rica, Mexico,
and Argentina.

plied math, he wants to study eco-

service, goodwill, and truth on an
international level,” says O’Nell.

sored three awards which fourteen

bassadorial scholarship which in-
volves presenting the U.S. to an-
other country,” says McGehee.

College trustees depart
after uneventful weekend

By DANIELLE MILES
Staff Writer

Most of the. 48 members of
Davidson’s Board of Trustees were
on campus this weekend for com-
mittee meetings on Thursday, a
Trustee Dinner Thursday evening
in Chambers Gallery, and full
board meetings on Friday.

Each of the seven trustee com-
mittees, including those on Ad-
mission and Financial Aid, Ath-
letic Policy, Buildings and
Grounds, Institutional Advance-
ment, and the Council on Campus
and Religious Life, Academic and
Educational Policy, and Business
and Finance, met Thursday:

Student representatives serve
on the first five of these commit-
tees. Seniors Will Cowan, Clair
Freeman, Warren Buford, return
totheirrespective committees from
last year. Senior Nelson Chan-
dler, and sophomore Rives Moore
were selected by the Student Gov-
ernment Association two weeks
ago to fill vacant postions on the
remaining two committees.

Says Chandler, “I think the

trustees are receptive to having stu-
dents on the committees. [It] helps
promote dialogue between students
and committees.”

He adds that the student par-
ticipation also helps the trustees to
be “generally receptive to the stu-
dent body,” especially in relation
to issues like the remodeling of the
sophomore dorms and efforts to
provide all students with on-line
access from their rooms, which are
in the domain of the committee on
Building and Grounds, on which
Chandler serves. In his experience
this weekend, the trustees are,
Chandler emphasizes, “interested
to know what students feel.”

Buford also believes that com-~

munication with the trustees has
been successful. “I believe open
dialogue has occurred,” he says.
Thursday night’s Trustee Din-
ner brought students, trustees, and
some faculty together. Other stu-
dents who attended the dinner say
that the trustees went out of their
way tocommunicate with students.
As Chandler says, it was a
time to “get together ... in a more
informal setting.” Overall, he calls

the trustees’ visit “a positive expe-
rience, and hopefully a productive
one.”

Trustees made general reviews
on such issues as the alcohol policy
and the future construction of a
new college union. However, the
majority of discussion centered on
progress reports.

The recipient of this year’s
honorary degree was chosen by
the Academic and Educational
Policy committee, but committee
members are waiting to hear if the
degree will be accepted before the
‘name is released.

Members of the Physical Plant

_ who aided in the hurricane relief

were honored.

Other reports included a sta-
tistical update on the Class of 2000,
a review of the summer renova-
tions to the sophomore dorms, a
review of construction of the new
computer lab in the basement of
Belk, and current status updates
from Dr. Robert J. Manning, Vice
Chairman of the Faculty, Dr. Laurie
Dunn, President of the Alumni
Association, and Warren Buford,

SGA President.
