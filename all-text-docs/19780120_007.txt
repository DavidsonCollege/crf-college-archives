Davidson losing an
important member

To the Editor:
I was overwhelmed when I heard
' that Dr. Devon would not be return-
ing next year. That bit of information
was more frightening and depressing
than any I have heard in a long while
-- especially following in the wake of
reported discussions concerning ‘the
cessation of our foreign student
program.

Dr. Devon provides something that
Davidson desperately needs. David-
son needs to make a determined effort
to keep its horizons open. It needs the
kinds of courses-Dr. Devon provides
in her South Asian Studies depart-
ment. It needs to work in the
realization that it is part of the world
and that, in this world, there are

decisions. In the routine of operating
Davidson day by day, I fear that the
goals of an academic community are
often taking second priority to busi-
ness and public relations efficiency.
Davidson College is not a factory; its
teachers are not to be considered as
employees, its students are not
consumers, and its education not a
product to be manufactured as cheap-
ly as possible and sold at the highest
price, And the costs I'm speaking of
here are not salaries and tuitions, but

_ the Administrations’s genuine con-
cern, All we're asking is, to borrow
the phrase, an education as if people
mattered.

The Davidsonian welcomes
letters to the editor on any
subject. All letters for publica-
tion must be s¥gned. We
reserve’ the right to edit letters
over 300 words.

Mail letters to The Davidso-
nian, Box 218, Davidson, N.C.

newspaper's office in the Col-
lege Union. Letters received by
Monday night will ordinarily be

printed in that week's issue. |

many cultures which are radically
different from that of the majority of
students here.

How many Davidson students real-
ly know anything about non-Western
cultures or non-Christian religions?
Do we have any understanding of how
America is viewed by the rest of the
world? Do we even know anything
about the culture of lower-class
America? Our horizons are narrow
and they are narrowing rapidly.

We need the foreign students. We
need the Black students. We heed
fundamentalists, Zen Buddhists and
atheists; arch-conservatives and
bleeding heart liberals. We need
courses to teach us about other
cultures. We need people who are
struggling with ideas. We need to
come out of our self-absorption and
look at the rest of the world.

I do not know why Dr. Devon is
being dismissed. Perhaps there is
some reason that it is best I don't
know. Whatever the reason, I am sad
to see her go. She has added another
dimension to Davidson. She is dif-
ferent. The courses she offers are
important--but equally important is
the support she gives to the happen-
ings around campus. I attend the
great majority of “cultural events”’ on
campus and at almost every one I see
Dr. Devon somewhere in the crowd.
At concerts, plays, poetry readings,
and dinners, she is there. This is
unusual; any professor who lends this
much support stands out. But her
support’ of Davidson's extracurricular
events does not end there. She has
also brought new elements to us in the
realm of South Asian culture. Last
year she took twenty of us to a
celebration and dinner held by the
Indians of Charlotte. This year she
hosted the rudra veena player, who
provided one of the finest and most
captivating evenings I’ve had since
coming to Davidson.

What else has she done for us? I
don’t know. I haven't made a study of
it. I only know that I am sad to see
her go. Davidson is losing an impor-
tant member.
