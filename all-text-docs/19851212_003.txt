Senior class considers gift

By LAURA BATTEN

For the fourth consecutive
year, a senior class will vote
among several proposals for the
Senior Gift. The purpose of the
gift is to obtain for the college
something which is beneficial but
not necessarily exigent, according
to Senior Gift Committee Chair-
man Jennifer Gotto.

This fall the Senior Gift Com-
mittee, vice chaired by Vince De-
nnis, has been investigating gift
possibilities in several areas of the
campus. It has also taken sugges-

Locks on

By HEIDI HOOKER

A Simplex, coded lock system
was installed on the Peter Knox,
Akers, and Mary Irwin Belk dor-
mitories November 8.

Installing some kind of locks
on all dorms has been a major con-
cern of both the housing office and
security this year.

Housing Director Tom Jen-
nings hopes to have locks on all
dorms within two years, with
women’s dorms receiving prior-
ity. Jennings plans to change the
codes for each dorm’s locks at the
beginning of each term.

Jennings said he is pleased
that “Davidson is now taking this
direction in security, considering
the enlarging community around
Davidson related to the growth
and expansion of Charlotte.” He
anticipated that the lock issue

tions from the senior class. The
committee is made up of about ten
seniors, has met every other week
to consider potential gifts and has
now narrowed the choices down
to four.

One option is a summer schol-
arship for work, travel and study
abroad. The scholarship would be
awarded by the Dean Rusk Pro-
gram in International Studies,
which would provide merit-based
grants to two or three students per
year.

A second alternative is a lec-

ture series, also handled by the
Rusk Program. The series would
insure at least one speaker and
presentation every year. The type
of speaker and presentation would
be selected through the Rusk Pro-
gram.

Another idea for the gift is the
investment in two vans for student
service. The vans would be
checked out through the Union
desk by a student group or a stu-
dent service. The vans would
allow groups to drive to Charlotte
for such activities as athletic and

cultural events and rides to the air-
port.

The final alternative is the in-
stallment of handicapped facilities
(such as ramps) on campus to ease
the movement of handicapped stu-
dents. The hope would be that the
increased . number of facilities
would promote diversification of
the student body and faculty by at-
tracting more handicapped stu-
dents and professors, as well as

disabled visitors.
After Christmas Sharon

Maguire and Robert McLean will

be selecting brokers from the
senior class. The collection of
money will be carried out through
the eating houses and fraternities,
as it is believed that this is the
most efficient way to contact the
entire senior class. The brochures
describing the gift will be written
and the stationery designed. Any-
one with artistic ability and inter-
est is welcome to help with the de-
sign. The actual campaigning be-
gins early spring term.

The vote will be held Dec. 19
in Chambers.

new dorms cause mixed reactions

would be met with the resistance
of students wanting to preserve
“the tradition of the unlocked
campus under the Honor Code.”
Officer Ray Thrower believes
this security measure is significant
in the school’s recognition of the
“crime threat imposed by outsid-
ers, not the insiders, of the cam-
pus.” He said, “Jennings is really
sharp in his efforts and his concern
for student welfare” and believes
that initial displeasure with the
locks is “natural and just a matter
of people getting used to them.”

Jennings said the major draw-
back of the new lock system is that
rain or humid weather causes
doors to swell, which prevents
them from locking. One door on
Knox will not close and lock un-
less it is slammed. Jennings is cur-

rently working on this problem.

Last year the housing office
tested an electronic security sys-
tem in Knox. However it was inef-
fective because students could
deactivate it by pushing a button
in the side of the door, With the
new lock system the doors secure
themselves everytime they close
and may only be opened by the
code or a master key supplied to
police and maintenance.

Some students were positive
about the new locks. Senior Doug
Desjardins is “impressed at how
surprisingly well the locks have
been accepted.” Resident Advisor
Emily Bond said she has gotten no
complaints. Sophomore Anna
Erwin said that at the first R.A.
meeting with the dorm residents,
the lock issue “did not go over

well and created some fuss.”

Some students are very en-
thusiastic about the new dorm se-
curity. Sophomore Cathy Sloop
said, “It is a good effort to keep
strangers out of the halls.” She
said she feels much more secure at
night. Sophomore Sandra Ivey
said the system was preventing
“imports from invading the halls’
bathrooms and spreading their
suitcases all over the place though
they don't belong there.”

Though they felt there were
many complaints in general about
the locks, both students agreed
that the locks are inconvenient for
guests or visitors. Sophomore
Sally Robinson said another in-
convenience is “that the first floor
people have to let others in all the
time, which is a pain.”

Some students question the ef-
fectiveness of the locks in improv-
ing security. Sophomore Carter
Adcock said if someone really
wanted to get in they could since
the combinations have been
printed out and spread by word of
mouth. Sophomore Chuck Harris
questions “how effective security
can be when lock combinations
are posted on a list over bathroom
mirrors in Knox so that they can
be just ripped down and accessible
to others if just left around.”

Sophomores Kelley Hardman
and Walt Reynolds agreed the
locks should not be turned on all
day long but just at night. Sopho-
more Elizabeth Keenan and
Hardman both suggested that the
locks be lighted in some way for
nighttime use.
