Pinning Art To The Wall

Davidson College has at its disposal exhibition
space in Chambers Banquet Hall for the display of im-
portant works of visual art. To allow the banquet hall
to remain unused while locking up the Davidson per-
manent art collection in drawers of filing cabinets is
nothing more than poor management of our present
resources and a hindrance to bringing art into the life
of the Davidson community.

A gallery where sufficient security and space allow
major travelling exhibits as well as the Davidson per-
manent collection to be displayed is not only
desirable, but necessary if Davidson is to continue
even its present fine arts programs. The limitations of
the Cunningham Fine Arts Center not only prohibit
the exhibition of travelling shows of major works but
threaten the future of the Davidson National Print
and Drawing Competition--the largest graphics con-
test in the nation.

The practicality of the project is undeniable. At a
time when Davidson is faced with major expenses for
renovation of its chemistry and studio art facilities,
the minimal costs involved in remodelling Chambers
Banquet Hall are particularly attractive.

Since the banquet hall provides an adequate
amount-of storage space, the only needed modificat-
ions include floor and wall carpeting, adequate light-
ing and security and additional wall panelling.

Further, the availability of the new Morrison Room
and Club facility in the new union should provide am-
ple space for all activities now scheduled infrequently
in the banauet hall.

At least several alumni of Davidson have expressed
interest in making gifts to the Davidson permanent
collection if they can be assured that Davidson will
provide proper display conditions. It is folly to
alienate our alumni by refusing gifts which could sub-
stantially benefit the college community.

Through the work of Herb Jackson and the
reputation of the Davidson National, Davidson has
received immense public relations material. We in-
deed feel that if Davidson is to continue to be
promoted so ably , a commitment to the arts is
necessary now.

We urge the administration to begin plans im-
mediately for the remodelling of Chambers Banquet
Hall. For Davidson College to allow its art to remain
locked in drawers when ideal space is available for its
exhibition depicts only too well the lack of
imagination of a community without art.

EXTERNalizing

The announcement from the Office for Experiential
Programs this week indicated that Davidson students
will have the opportunity to work as interns during
Spring break in various employment situations
through the EXTERN program.

The notification came as welcome news to a cam-
pus which has often heard grumblings about the lack
of career training opportunities at Davidson.

We feel that this program offers students excellent
opportunities to gain acquaintance with particular oc-
cupational activities before committing themselves
to lengthy internships.

It appears particularly advantageous to students
making plans for internships during summers or
during a term or more of the academic year, while
also giving exploratory options to those whose plans
do not allow for such extensive internships.

We hope that as many students as possible will
begin to take advantage of educational experiences
away from the Davidson campus. We are particularly
appreciative of the work Ken Wood and-Suzie Sum-
mers have done this year in experiential programs
and placement, and we anticipate a much broader
curriculum in the liberal arts for a large number of
students through their efforts,

‘Reader’s Digest’ Stimulates
Grandpa’s Intellectual Life

A man once told mea parable

. about his father and ‘‘Reader’s

Digest.”’

His father had read the
magazine all his life, but as his
eyesight dimmed he could no
longer comfortably read the
print.

Fortunately for the family,
they discovered that, in ad-

_ dition to publishing in ninety-

seven aborigine tongues, the
magazine issued a special
large-print edition for dim eyes.

So the family settled back into
contented routine. Grandfather
chuckled again with doses of
laughter, the best medicine.
Quotable quotes flew across the
dinner table. Speech once again
became towards more pic-
turesque.

But one day Grandfather an-
nounced that he didn’t want
“Reader’s Digest’? anymore.
Despite earnest entreaties, he
persisted in his resigned whim.

He became listless, deprived
of inspiration from reprints of
Dwight Eisenhower’s Inaugural
Address. Grandfather aban-

“doned interest in all around

him.

The family desperately
sought remedies. A letter was
dispatched to the editor
pleading for an article on Joe’s
Arthritic Knuckle. No, Grand-
father said, it wasn’t the article
on Vitamin E that had

depressed him, and remained - ss

silent.
A month later Grandfather
was dead.

The story was related in a less
adorned form, and the moral
was that we (a class) should
cultivate some catalyst to
heighten our interest in life.

It might have worked, but his
unfortunate choice of reading
material persuaded me that

Grandfather was simply bored
to death with a shooting gallery
duck display of Most Un-
forgettable Characters
delivering the neighborhood
milk for forty-two years while
battling intense lactic acid
allergies.

‘“‘Reader’s Digest”’ is open for
a barrage of cheap shots. But I
won’t apologize; it’s fun.

You see, I’m the only one at
home who'll be seen looking at
any of the three gift sub-
scriptions. Home now and then,
I like to rescue them like a wet
wimpering puppy. I’d keep it,
but it’s such a stupid dog.

Two unmaskings marked the
rough beginning and end of my
adolescence. (Three cars
driving by the Fox swerve and
screech). The first was the
hasty admittal that professional
wrestling was staged. The
second was that ‘‘Reader’s
Digest’? might not encompass
the journalism of the world af-
ter all,

A friend, learning of this sput-
tering smear, told me how upset
he was when ‘“‘Reader’s Digest”’
switched the table of contents
from the back cover to the
front. Can. you imagine the
terror if hymns started reading
backwards?

A year later his mother broke
into print with a prize-winning
entry in Drama in Real Life,
‘How I Handled My Child’s
Trauma.”’

But how can you honorably
slight the impressive boxscore
touted by ‘‘Reader’s Digest’’ is
that it must reflect the tastes of
too many people too close all
around. It obviously tailors its
stuff to sell. Large print for dim
eyes, excellent. Dim subjects
for dim minds, look out. |

But as the same friend said,
‘Tf you’re gonna lean on.
‘Reader’s Digest,’ you gotta
come‘down hard.”’ So hard it is.

After all, couldn’t ‘‘Reader’s
Digest’’ do wonders with David-
son? Graduations would come
complete with fading young
leukemia victims striding
across the stage for applauded
diplomas; library shelves
reduced to seven rows of rain-
bow hued volumes.

And | newspaper | articles
would be mercifully cut to
bearable lengths by speed-
reading editors gobbling
laxatives, and the extra space
in the paper would be filled with
memorable misprints from the
past.

Pardon me, dear ‘Digest’,
but I think your slip is showing.
