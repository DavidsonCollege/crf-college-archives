Shaw Smith:
the Panther Man

Professor lives boyhood
dream to work with pro team

By Kirsten RECKNAGEL
Staff Writer

Associate Professor of Art
History and Humanities Shaw
Smith remembers his high school
days clearly. Each weekend, just
as the Sunday afternoon profes-
sional football games were getting
underway, his mother would turn
off the television and tell him that
it was time he finished his home-
work. Smith vowed that after high
school he would watchevery game
he could — and today he has the
best seat in the house.

Smith is involved with the
Carolina Panthers’ home locker
room preparation, the countless
details of which make it “an enor-
mous undertakering,” he explains.

Smith’s experience with the
Panthers began about a year and a
half ago when he wrote letters to
those affiliated with the team, ask-

When he was offered the op-
portunity to work with the ball
crew, Smith was thrilled. Mem-
bers of the ball crew are positioned
at the sidelines of the field and feed
the ball in to the referees when it
has gone out of play. Constantly
on the alert, they must anticipate
the ball’s final destination, or spot,
and in this way they play a critical
role in speeding up the game.

His positon on the ball crew
meant he had “the best seat in the
house,” Smith says. “The players
are fast, strong, and smart. They
shrink the field.” In addition, Smith
stresses that football is “not brut-
ish. The pro game is about will.
Everyoneis physical; that’sa given.
There is no question that football
at this level, inthe NFL, is the most
mental team game there is.”

Today, Smith is part of the
organizational structure which sup-
ports the Panthers behind the

SURFING

Surfers find a home (page)
on the World Wide Web

By BRIGAND GREEN
Staff Writer

By now, even the most dedicated technophobe
among us has heard tales of the Internet and, particu-
larly, the World Wide Web. This massive combina-
tion of text, graphics, and hypertext “links” has
received intensive press coverage due to its some-
times-informative, often-entertaining content and
its ease of use.

Lured by the dual promise of vast new realms of
information and social interaction, increasing num-
bers of Davidson students have taken the plunge into
the often-confusing world of the Web.

Using a networked campus computer and
Netscape, any student can point-and-click his or her
way across the World Wide Web with ease.

But what happens when a student is ready to
establish his or her own presence on the Web? Even
though the Computing Services Center doesn’t offi-
cially allow students to establish their own Web
pages, a few enterprising students have obtained
