Coffee

What started as a one week
experiment in college enter
tainment at Davidson in the
spring of 1966 with the pre
miere of the Hungry d has
now expanded to an exten
sive circuit of coffee houses
on more than 60 college and
university campuses.

C. Shaw Smith, director of
the College Union at David-
son, conceived the idea of a
campus supper club or coffee
house following conversations
with several people in the
business about the high cost
of entertainment for the cam-
pus and the lack of meaning
ful contact with these peo
ple.

He soon incorporated his
knowledge of and faith in the
entertainment field into his
coffee house experiment.
“There are too many great
show business people, not
just great performers but re
ally great people, and they
need a break which the col
leges and universities can
give them,” he said. ‘‘Many
of the greatest performers
today get as much as 90 per

cent of their income from the
college entertainment field,”
Smith continued. ‘This is a
lot of influence to wield and
we need to make more crea
tive use of it.”

Fred Smoot, a young com-
edian later to be declared
Davidson's ‘resident comed
ian’’, was the first person to
really encourage the idea and
proved its worth in the first
Hungry d.

Despite discouragements
from some of the big talent
agents that the idea of hav-
ing good new talent on the
college campus for a week's
stay at a minimum cost
would not work, Smith per
sisted.

At a block booking confer
enfce he talked with Fred
Weintraub of New York's Bit
ter End coffee house and
manager of Fredana Man
agement Co. who said that
the idea would not only work
but that he could provide

“scads"’ of young talent for

the then fledgling circuit.
Smith saw two duties that

the campus should perform

for the circuit: it would ‘‘find
new talent, fine talent that
we can live with and enjoy"
and ‘‘give them a chance to
prove themselves, to devel-
op, and then promote them.
We (the colleges and univer-
sities) have the money and
should use their influence,”
Smith said.

The idea appealed to
schools and entertainers alike
and Smith rounded up seven
other area schools including
Duke, the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill, Wake
Forest and South Carolina to
start the first circuit last
spring with about six acts.

This small circuit was a
test and a_ successful one,
from the entertainer’s view
point. Jake Holmes, a circuit
veteran, won role in David
Merrick's new Broadway
play. He also provided the
campus with good talent at a
minimal cost.

“When the students proved
the idea could work, we re
ally searted to grow,” said
Smieh.

Wayne Stark, past presi-

Milton Spann of the Mon-

said that he is “‘widely re

campuses plan their pro-

Both Stark and Spann char-

acterized Smith as a ‘mas

tertainment on the campus.”
Spann said that he has the
respect of his colleagues to
the extent that he is able to
sell an unknown act, know

‘King Colin’s’ War Record
Includes ‘Foxhole Follies’

“King Colin’ boasts a war
record very unusual for most
men. In his three years in
the USO camp shows C.
Shaw Smith travelled over
125,000 miles and entertained
over two million men.

After the Army turned him
down for combat duty, Smith
joined the USO camp shows
as a magician and master of
ceremonies, initially giving
shows here in the U.S. at
training bases.

Going to England in 1944
as a member of ‘‘The Fox-
‘hole Follies” Smith played
throughout England and Scot
land.

When he rest of his troupe
went home Smith stayed and
helped organize Arrabella’s
Show Shop which ultimately
included two trained dogs in
the act. While working with

“The big name stars vouid
come over and stay for may-
be one to six months but we
‘stayed over there with the
boys and played whenever
we could,” he said. “We

would give one or two per-
formances daily plus many
more hospital shows.”

Smith pointed out the time
when the USO flew his troupe
300 miles into the Spanish
provinces so they could give
a show for 12 servicemen or
when they gave a show to
one man who was isolated
behind a glass door in a hos
pital in India.

He is also proud of the
time when he entertained the
Sultan's family in Casablan-
ca.

“We decided in Paris at
the beginning of our tour
that it would be interesting
to have a dog in our show
since this would be almost
as much of a morale booster
as the girly.”

Smith said his camp show

House Circuit Now

After a selected letter writ-
ing program to other schools
supplemented by write-ups of
the concept in trade journals
such as Variety and _ Bill-
board, Smith and the mem
bers of last year’s circuit
held a screening of talent in
New York last spring.

“Almost 60 colleges and
universities were represent
ed at that meeting last year
by an individual and 20 or 30
more were represented as a
group,’ he said. He explain
ed that the coffee house cir.
cuit is now divided into sev
en circuits from Florida-Ala
bama to Ohio and upper New
York with 60 colleges partic
ipating.

“We have had inquiries
from 60 more schools who
want to join the circuit this
coming spring or next fall,’
Smith said. .“‘We just can't
handle any more right now,

from the Bitter End in New
York, said that Smith is ‘‘an
innovator in the whole field of
live entertainment on cam
pus."’ He said that “the ma
jor thing he (Smith) is, is a
creative thinker with the cof
fee house circuit as only one
manifestation of “this.”

Smith is described by Sen
nett as ‘one of the most re
spected college buyers of tal
ent in the country.’ One of
the reasons for this, said Sen-
nett, is that Smith has made
other colleges aware of their
importance in the field of
entertainment and has led
them to participate in it on
a professional level.

Sennett said, ‘‘He is a joy
to work with from our end.”

added.

Smith's vision does not stop
here for he sees the eventual
establishment on campuses
of full fledged supper clubs
able to buy talent in the $500
$1500 range on a weekly
schedule. ‘This will have to
come later, though, once we
get the discovery circuit, the
coffee houses, well organized
and functioning smoothly,”
he said.

The coffee house circuit is
only one manifestation of
Smith's interest in the field
of campus entertainment. He
has long felt that campuses
were paying too much for
the type of talent they were
getting. Through “‘talk, talk
and more talk,’’ Smith said,

Union Director Has Nursed

The Project Since Its Birth

C. Shaw Smith has literally
been at Davidson as long as
the College Union has been
here and has nursed it to its
present status on campus,

When. the present Union
building was completed in
1952 using the shell of the old
gym, Smith was brought to
the campus by President
John R. Cunningham to di
rect the activities of the
Union.

Since that time the college
has seen a_ tremendous
growth in the programs of-
fered by the Union. Smith
said much of the credit for
the expansion of the budget
and the program must go to
President D. Grier Martin,

who has supported the Union
since its inception, and to
Dean of Students Richard C.
Burts, who is responsible for
the overall activities of the
student body.

The Union first entered the
social life of the campus
seven years ago with the first
Christmas party. Then with
the creation of the Social
Council three years ago and
subsequent cooperation be
tween the Union and council
the social program has ex-
panded to encompass the
whole student body.

The. development of the
social life-on campus follows
the .general direction which
Smith thinks the Union should

follow. The Union, he says,
should provide leisure time
activities for the entire stu
dent body.

‘But because of the grow
ing demands of the academ
ic classroom leisure time is
more scarce,’ he said, “‘so
these leisure time activities
which the Union can offer
should be educational to ex
pose the student to things
which will allow him to de
velop the whole man.”

A part. of this development
consists of the campus-wide
social life in part achieved
through the blending of the
efforts of the Union Board
and the Social Council.
