The Davidsonian
Wants

—a victory over The Citadel.

—to know where the old fighting
spirit is.

—to congratulate Colonel Scott
on his promotion.

—to thank those who are making
suggestions for the improve-
ment of this paper.

—more respect shown for visitors
to the campus. Especially for
the young ladies.

—freshmen to remember that Da-
vidson men should be gentle-
men—even at football games.

DEMOCRATS ORGANIZE

And Davidson falls in, line: with
other colleges as an “ALSmith Club”
or its equivalent is formed, Baced
by a county, state and national or-
ganization, certain representative
men of the campus met last Monday
night, elected officers, and made
plans for an active campaign among
the student body,

The Charlotte Observer, in com-
menting on the Hoover-Curtis or-
ganization at Wake Forest College,
says that the action taken by this
club “need be no occasion for an out-
break of partisan criticism, for there
are Hoover clibs in the colleges, the
right to establish such organizations
having been. admitted as one belong-
ing to the students.”

But there will be criticism, no
doubt, from some source. There
always if. Last spring when a “straw
vote” was conducted by The David-
sonian there were several who point-
ed with a warning finger at possible
evil results. There were no bad
results, however. '

In the forming of the local
“Young People’s Democratic Club”
the instigators of. the mayément
stated that their purpose was to
“confirm those who are already sup-
porting the Democratic ticket, to
bring the lukewarm into the ranks,
and to seek out the purposes moti-
vating those who are Republicans.”

The stress seems to be on the
Democratic Party rather than upon
Governor Smith and Senator Rob-
inson. “To keep the South solid” is
a stated purpose,

It will be interesting to watch the
activities of the organization.
And now there must be.a Hoover

Club in order that we may be strictly
collegiate.

THERE ARE OTHER THINGS

Scholastic endeavor, of course, is
the primary purpose, or should be,
of the college student ; but there are
other things. The emphasis is being
placed on extra-curricular activities
altogether too much in some colleges
as they strive to bring in that which

will attract the student and make
studying more interesting.
The _ Tomahawk confirms the

statement that “Every applicant for
admission to Holy Cross College
must answer the question, ‘Do you
pledge yourself to give your time
and. ability to the extra-curricular
activities of the college?’ Continu-
ing, ‘Each and every student is ex-
pected to contribute something of his
ability to some activity on the Hill.’ ”

The Flat Hat, of William and
Mary, commends the attitude and
considers “A college career consist-
ing of study and nothing more, a
pretty dry sort of existence at best.”

“A man or woman who has never
known what it is to sing in the glee
club, or play in the college band, or
to debate, or to play baseball or some
other sport, or to be connected with
the publications, has missed a large
portion of the components of that
abstract thing known as “college
life,” the Virginia paper thinks.

Consider a college stripped of the
extra-curricular doings. What would
its enrollment be? This importance
is generally recognized by the col-
leges of the day and they are stress-
ing the importance, Some students,
however, are prone to become one-
sided and beings of one interest.
They should be awakened from their
lethargy. They do not know what
college life is.

DR. THOMPSON AND THE
MEETING

The announcement by “Y” offi-
cials that Dr. “Tolly” Thompson, of
Union Seminary, Richmond, will
conduct the student meetings begin-
ning here Sunday, is met everywhere
with favorable comment and keen
expectation.

Dr. Thompson is known to many
students as a splendid speaker, a
leader of men, the possessor of a fine
personality and a devout Christian.

The Y. M. C. A. deserves com-
mendation for securing such a man
for a work so important again this
year. Each fall and spring they
bring the very best available men
here to speak to the student body.
The Cabinet has the thanks of every
man for the opportunities which are
presented through its channels.

There is always a great degree of
enthusiasm in one of these meetings
and this should prove no exception.
There is good to be gained; there
are fine sermons to be heard; and
there are closer Christian fellow-
ships to be formed between God and
students. Great opportunities !

The uselessness of anything but dreams?

The-faintest ‘hope can be but momentary—

No more to kiss your throat, your eyes,

No more to touch you with lips that are

Last Thursday, October 11, the Lar-
sen, the last of Commander Byrd's
three ships in his South Pole expedi-
tion, sailed for the Ross Sea. The
City of New York and the freighter
Chelsea are already in New Zealand.

The intrepid Virginia explorer has
carefully prepared a library of 1,000
books for this voyage. The selection
is composed almost entirely of books
of adventure, including the books of
Kipling, Conrad, Rex Beach, and Jack
London, with a number of lighter
volumes, such as “Two Years Before
the Mast,” and others of that nature.
A professional librarian is accompany-
ing Byrd.

The eighty men of his staff, working
and resting and playing, under the
stress of uncertainty, will have plenty
of reading to quicken their courage.
And that is what the head of the ex-
pedition had in mind. There will be
dong periods of waiting, lots of drab
days and nights, lots of heartaches.
The spirit of adventure must be kept
alive.

Byrd's expedition, which will return
before July, 1930, will cost approxi-
mately $1,150,000. This money has
been raised by contributions from a
dozen or more scientific societies
which will obtain reports from Com-
mander Byrd, When the exploration
is completed, the Secretary of Navy
will receive a full official report. The
primary purpose of the trip is to make
accurate maps and procure important
meterological and other data of the
South.Pole regions.

The average man doesn't enthuse to
any appreciable extent over the farm
relief measure as he cannot under-
stand why a farmer needs any relief
from the prices he has to-pay for what
the farmer raises.

A Japanese syndicate, capitalized at
$5,000,000, has completed plans to col-
onize the Amazon Valley in the State

of Para with Japanese families. Mr.
Nachiro Fukuhara, director of the
syndicate, states that Japanese emi-

gration is to reach a total of 1,000 an-
nually, starting next April. The immi-
grants hope to become Brazilian citi-
zens after two years. However, some
of us might prophesy in spite of the
United States’ foreign policy, para-
phrasing Longfellow:
“Down to the State of Para, that had
been to their feet as a doorstep
Into a world unknown—the corner-
stone of a nation.”

With mother in politics and the law
forbidding child labor it looks as if
father will have to go to work.

“Who's Who in America” contains
the biographies of over 10,000 citizens.
But in Italy—

After three months’ nominal domina-
tion by the Nanking Government of
United China, China is facing more
widespread famines than ever before
known, Hundreds of thousands of sol-
diers are unpaid and without provi-
sions or houses; thousands of prison-
ers are now unfed, except when their
friends and relatives take food to the
prisons. The regeneration of China
now lies in the hands of the newly
chosen President, General Chiang Kai-
shek. However, not in a year or even
a decade can the transformation of a
people still largely in a medieval state
of civilization into a modern nation be
effected.

Cosmic Chaos
By J. W. McCutchan

Germans as’ well as Americans were
interested in the landing of Graf Zep-
pelin, giant dirigible. Leaving Fried-
richshafen early in the morning of
Thursday, it arrived at Lakehurst Mon-
day afternoon. It is hard on a man-
made construction to run on schedule
time, when it is completely at the
mercy of nature’s storms. It is en-
tirely probable that only a few years
will elapse, however, before a con-
venient trans-Atlantic schedule can be
maintained. Even then, certain con-
scientious souls will be perturbed at
the thought of passengers riding above
“dry” territory, sipping champagne and
drinking whiskey.

Treasurers of large organizations,
honest though they.may be, are always
watched and sefécted with the great-
est care. The sad example of Carnes
will doubtless cause many trusted men
to resign their positions voluntarily
and by request. No organization
could have suffered more, than did the
Baptist Church, by the fraud of one
of its officials. Many will be less lib-
eral in their church contributions un-
der the plea that they cannot know
when there will be a similar occurence,
The most unfortunate circumstance
connected with Carnes’ theft, was that
a large proportion of the sum which
he took was literally made up of
widows’ mites,

Many customs and superstitutions,

products of the middle ages, remain to
the present day. One reads of “love
powders” that are given to create a
deeper love, and that really cause
death. They were favorite weapons of
the Borgias; Catherine de Medici
would have gloated in them. Also the
custom of trying beasts for crimes re-
mains with us. Only the other day a
dog was tried, condemned, and put to
death for biting a small child. Twelve
men, good and true, formed its jury;
a sedate judge administered the sen-
tence.
Those “doubters” who may be found
among the students on the, Hill may
be surprised to learn that the law has
taken official notice of the evidence of
hypnotism. A girl was being tried in
Connecticut for burglary; there was
no apparent chance for acquittal. Ra-
ther suddenly, her counsel produced
proofs that she was working under
the hypnotic influence of her fiance.
As a result she was declared innocent
and the man was forced to serve her
sentence of three years. The thought
occurs: How many work under a
dominating influence that is not their
own?

Let it be said in all justice to the
Navy of the United States that it is
not the only one to have consistent
submarine disasters. .All France was
recently shocked to hear.of the loss of
forty-three men, who were on ‘board
the submarine Ondine, a vessel of the
newest and largest type. It will be re-
called that Great Britain suffered a
like loss in the last few months, How
much longer will the lives of: sailors
be sacrificed in times of peace? Drill
maneuvers must be practised, but can
not some degree of precaution be
taken?

Even though this isn’t baseball sea-
son, we have to mention a certain
shortstop, called “Ancient Mariner,”
because he stoppeth-‘‘one of three.”

Mrs,—“She has quite a large reper-
toire, hasn’t she?”

Mr.—“Oh yes, and that dress makes
it look allsthe worse.”

OPEN FORUM

THAT SPIRIT

One of Davidson’s proudest pos-
sessions has been, for: quite a while,
its fighting spirit, known wherever
Davidson is known. Winning or los-
ing, any Davidson man was a Wildcat
and was not through fighting until the
last whistle had blown.

At the two football games played
here this year, it would have been dif-
ficult for an old friend of Davidson to
recognize any fighting spirit. One
game we won, and that by such a
score that it seemed hard to back the
team as fiercely as in a more even
contest. The other we lost. And the
cheering from the stands was of the
'sdme , calber—indifferent, mediocre. It
seemed a bit like a picture show au-
dience, where some -popular vayde-
ville act is encored, and for the rest,
letting silence reign.

Perhaps it is because there have been

fewer student body pep meetings than
last year. I don’t know. Those in au-
thority that have less pep meetings
might. have a better result, through
fear of over-doing it. The cheer lead-
ers seem to have been doing their best,
but they certainly have lacked the full
support of the school this year.

At last Saturday’s game, here and
there, was all the cheering that any-
one could ask. But for the most part,
everyone seemed unwilling to disturb
his neighbor. Having girls mixed in
everywhere with the student body
was one cause. Can we in the future,
have the boys who are not with girls
sitting together so that we can show
the team that they do have any kup-
port that we may give? '

In closing, at least one member of
the student body hopes that that Wild-
cat spirit of which we are so proud—
and justly proud—is, at the present,
ill and not dead.

OUT OF THE BRIEF CASE

It looks as if celluloid collars are doomed—unless some master publicity
man convinces the public that they’re good for halitosis.

“America is slowly developing a race small in statue,” they tell us. Well,
what can you expect, considering the number who travel in upper berths
each year?

Speaking of trains and such, we’ve often wondered who Mr, Pullman
gets to name his:cars for him. Reckon he is the world’s highest salaried
nomenclator, huh?

Did. you notice that no honorary fraternity bids were turned down?
Perhaps those opposed to such organizations have suddenly changed their
minds—or else didn’t get bids.

It has been humorode that Al Smith
week. Wonder if there is any truth to that?

Herbie and Al are wasting time, seems to us. Why don’t they cut out
the .speechmaking and handshaking and swim the English Channel or fly
across the Atlantic Ocean or something? Why since this German Zeppelin
has been headed this way, you can’t find Mr. Hoover or Mr. Smith men-
tioned anywhere except in editorials—and who reads those, anyhow?

MY LAST ROOM-MATE

My last room-mate was an ideal fellow. He wore his own clothes. He
was the same size as I, had a closet full of the latest cut suits, and was not
stingy with his things. He cleaned up the room each morning, hanging my
clothes in their proper place. He made up our laundries on Monday morn-
ings and saw that they got in the hands of Lord Helper for their weekly
mangling (Editor’s note: Wonder if Lord Helper don’t make quite a wad
on the side, selling buttons?) He knew plenty of women and didn’t mind
dating his room-mate with the best. He never failed to keep failed to keep
me from sleeping through classes. He owned a toothbrush, a can of shoe
polish, a razor, and had toothpaste of his own, Could find his own bed when
coming in after lights at night. Smoked the right brand and always had a
carton on hand for us. Was deli o write papers, work problems, etc.,

Fred Waring, director ofthe famods orchestra, “Waring’s Pennsylvanians,”
failed to make the Penn State Glee Club in his collegiate days because “he
didn’t have any musical ability.” Maybe some critics are right about modern
jazz not being music, or maybe Fred didn’t own a Tux. Or maybe the di-
rector of said Glee Club didn’t size Mr. Waring up just right.

Most people write because they’re paid for writing. Some write to fill
up two columns of space each week (under this classification comes the
Feature Editor of Davidson's only morning newspaper). But whoever heard
of anybody refusing to write when offered one dollar
writing ?

Some years ago a young college professor was offered $1,500 (at least. six
months salary for him) to write a 1,500 word article for a certain newspaper.
He refused, giving as his reason that the standards of said newspaper were
not up to his standards. No amount of persuasion could make him consent to
write the desired article.

Do you think he was foolish for his stand? What would most word-
slingers do under such conditions? Frankly, we would buy a new ribbon for
this wreck and before long we'd be fifteen hundred dollars richer than we
are now. Which means we'd have fifteen hundred dollars and five cents.

By the way, we forgot to mention that this young professor was Wood-

Contemporary Thought

THE REAL ESSENCE OF
EDUCATION
(Charlotte News)

What is it all about, this thing we
call education The Nation is com-
pletely and solidly sold on it, That
is evident from the amountof’ money
it is dumping into the venture. It is
evident, too from the armies of young
men and women who annually are
trooping to the colleges and the uni-
versities. It is still evident from the
zeal and determination with which
the masses have taken hold of the idea
of free education furnished by the
State’ and are ready to pay rather
enormous taxes for the support of it.

But what is education and what the
basis of it in the ultimate analysis?

President Harlan Luther Freeman
thinks that “education at its highest
usefulness is not to produce men and

men and women whom we call grad-
uates, but who are fusing points for
the energy that elevates, these insti-
tutions are giving to civilization in-
dividuals who are its “salt” and its
“light,” and they are doing more to
save the Nation from decay than a
hundred, yea, a thousand, things for
which it spends its millions, This is
true because reverence, loyalty, and
service, which are essential to self-
government, are spiritual entities, and
come into existence and social action
by the release of spiritual energy
through the individual man or woman
who will open his life: to its incoming,

THE OFFER OF THE COLLEGE

To be at home in all lands and ages;
to count nature a familiar acquaint-
ance and art an intimate friend; to

women who can fill the warehouse,
but who can think and live like spirit-
ual beings in the temple of life.’ That’s
a sensible definition. This amounts to
something more than a place in the
columns of The American Magazine
through idosyncrasy of occupation or
success. It implies an “interpreting
mind and conscience that hearts the
divine whisper in the familiar and sees
the common bush affame with God.”
And the small colleges of this Nation,
which, with much endurance and self-
denial without the funds, to which the
character of their work and the com-
mon standards of livng give them
title, if these dynamic centers can fur-
nish year by year a small group of

gain a standard for the appreciation of
other men’s work and the criticism of
your own; to carry in your pocket the
keys of the world’s library and feel
its resources behind you in whatever
task you undertake; to make hosts of
friends among the men of your own
age who are to be leaders in all walks
of life; to lose yourself in generous
enthusiasms and co-operate with oth-
ers for common ends; to learn man-
ners from students who are gentlemen
and form character under professors
who are Christians—this is the offer
of the college for the best four years
of your life.
