In acts of strength
and balance that defy
normal human
limits, Pilobolus
dances and creates
artistic images as
impressive for their
sheer physical ability
as for their naked
beauty.

Pilobolus amazes Love Auditorium

By Carrie VAN DEEST
Guest Writer

While many refer to them only
as the company that dances “na-
ked,” Pilobolus Dance Theatre’s
superior reputation is: based on
more than thelr costuming (or lack
of it.)

Their unique variety of mod-
ern dance drew record numbers to
Love Auditorium last Wednesday
night for the third show in the
Union’s Artists Series. The six
member company performed five
unique pieces, each demonstrating
remarkable strength and creative
invention.

In the opening
piece,“Harbison Work,” the danc-
ers’ bodies became a playground.
Combining incredible muscle and
grace, they swung, ‘slid, climbed,
and somersaulted over each other.

The second piece took a Buster
Keaton tone. Dancer Mark
Santillano crossed the stage on per-
ilous rolling tubes and battled with
a park bench that ended up on his

head in a solo from a larger work,
“Empty Suitor.” In “Alraune,”
Rebecca Jung and Trebian Pollard’s
bodies became indistinguishable.
Their duet constantly challenged the
audience to determine whose arms
and legs belonged to whom. Next,
the four male dancers appeared
onstage in boxing shorts. With no
musical accompaniment, they
tumbled, flipped, lifted, carried, and
tripped over each other in a rhythm
held steady only by the pulse of their
breathing.

Pilobolus’ final piece of the
evening, “Day Two,” combined all
of the elements that made their work
so fascinating. Beginning with the
simplest of movements, the piece
evolved into a spectacle of creation.
The performers bathed in the black-
ness of the dance floor. They wor-
shiped the beams of the stage lights.
The women lifted the men. The men
carried the women on poles from
which they swung like gymnasts on
a trapeze or children in a tree. A
dancer sprawled on the floor, legs to
the ceiling, balancing his partner on
the soles of his feet. The piece

climaxed when the group crawled
under the dance floor and ripped it
open in a sudden burst of energy, as
if emerging from the depths of the
earth. .

Pilobolus also made their work
a study of the visual arts. Entwining
their bodies into a whole, the results

“became sculptures. The male danc-

ers wore only thongs and the two
female dancers wore tiny leotards
in the final piece. So amazing were
their lifts, so masterful their chore-
ography, so breathtaking their im-
ages, that the minimal costuming
mattered very little. The piece could
have been performed entirely in the
nude. In some venues, “Day Two”

-is performed exactly that way.

Interestingly, the dancers who
make up Pilobolus come from di-
verse dance backgrounds. Matt
Kentis trained in ninjutsu. Rebecca
Jung cites her movement experi-
ence in field hockey and physics
among her dance influences. Each
performer possessed his or her own
individual style that radiated
throughout the choreography.

Unfortunately, Davidson was

not able to of-
fer Pilobolus
the kind of large
performing
space that they
deserved. Love
Auditorium
confined their
movements
and caused sev-
eral lighting
problems.

Still, the
company
seemed un-
daunted by the
space  con-
straints and
technical diffi-
culties. Their
show was
highly ener-
gized,  dy-
namic, and dra-
matic.

When the dancers emerged
from “Day Two,” sweating and
panting, they still had the energy to

throw themselves into a curtain call.
The audience, having seized
Pilobolus’ contagious energy, leapt
to its feet for a standing ovation.

Charlotte Symphony Orchestra fills DCPC with Mostly Mozart

By STEVEN DUNCAN
Staff Writer

Last Tuesday, February 18,
the Charlotte Symphony presented
a concert in the ongoing Mostly
Mozart series to an audience of
students and communi members

in the DCPC sanctuary. Janna
Hymes-Bianchi, Resident Conduc-
tor of the CSO, led the orchestra
through a light-hearted program of
music in the classical and baroque
idiom Highlights of the concert be-
gan with J. S. Bach’s Brandenburg
Concerto No. 4 i in .G maj or, BWV

1049. This work is one of six
Brandenburg concerti composed at
the court of Prince Leopold of
Anhalt-Coethen, where Bach first
began to turn his attention from the
organ to the composition of instru-
mental music.

Accordingly, these pieces are
an exploration of orchestration, each
featuring a small solo group, or
concertino, which is set apart from
the orchestra and continuo. The
concertino of this particular work
consists of two flutes, played by

. Jennifer Dior and Susanna Self, and

violin, played by Sungil Lee, con-
certmaster of the CSO. Lee tore
through the virtuosic passages of
rapid arpeggios and double-stops,
while the flutes held a musical dia-

logue, trading off melodic fragments ~

to one another as they dipped their
flutes in rhythmic unison.

Stravinsky’s Pulcinella Suite
was the final and the most enjoy-
able piece of the evening. Inclu-
sion of a 20th-century work in a
Mostly Mozart program might sur-
prise concert-goers, but the free-
dom from stylistic constraints in
modern-day composition has al-
lowed experimentation with early
musical styles as well as with the
avant-garde. Many composers hear-
ken from romantic exaltation and
serial incomprehensiblity back to
the diverting grace and symmetry
of classical tonality and form.

Based on melodies by the 18th-
century composer Giovanni
Pergolesi, the Pulcinella Suite com-
bines the language of classicism
with modern-day instrumentation,
all filtered through the genius of

“Igor Stravinsky. This work con-

tains brief solo passages for almost

every instrument, and thus show-
cased the talent and skill of many
CSO perfomers Especially note-
worthy was principal hornist Frank
Portone’s playing. Portone showed
great technical prowess in handling
registral leaps, soaring gracefully
up to startling melodic heights.

“Definitely the highlight of the
evening,” emoted JC Carlson when
asked about the work’s fifth move-
ment, in which principal trombon-
ist John Bartlett so effectively con-
veyed Stravinsky’s sparkling wit in
a humorous solo filled with brash
glissandi and fortissimo playing.

Despite the $10 ticket price and
the appalling lack of.a student dis-
count, most would agree the con-
cert was well-worth attending, given
its convenient locale and the quality
of the Charlotte Symphony’s per-
formance.
