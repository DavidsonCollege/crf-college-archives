“T think it cost us two cases
of beer before we finished
writing the people hunt clues.
The only way to get help was to
hand anyone we saw a beer and
then give them a pencil,” said
Doug Horn about some of his
and’ Nancy Macconnachie’s in-
cidents as freshman advisors.

Nancy is from Anderson,
South Carolina. Having been
studying through the Center for
Special Studies, Nancy will be
graduating with a major in
‘Educational Psychology and
Sociology. She said she hopes to
continue on to graduate school

and study clinical psychology. _

“T feel that there is a big scale
change coming in education.
The system has basically re-
mained the same for 200 years.

_One of the big questions is what

is the best method of teaching?
Everyone is trying new and
different ways and I want to be
a part of the change.”’

They didn’t seriously think
about running until shortly
before the campus-wide elec-
tion.

Studentsand townspeople form Davidson Energy Group

By Davidsonian Correspondent

‘‘After months of relative
confusion, the Davidson
Energy Group is finally coming
together into a coordinated and
functional organization. As a
joint effort by students and
townspeople to deal with the
entire spectrum of problems
related to energy, it represents
a unique constituency of people
throughout the Davidson com-
munity,” said Future Energy
Sources chairman, Geof Little.

The present day Davidson
Energy Group evolved from two
smaller groups which had been
working with energy problems
since last Spring. One group
was the student research group
organized by Roger Brown
('78) which participated in the
Barnwell protest last May. The
second was a group of towns-
people which formed over the
summer and participated in the
public hearings in August con-
cerning Duke Power's appli-
cation for a license to operate
the McGuire Nuclear Station,
according to Little.

In October the two groups,
realizing their similar interest
and the need for a coordinated
effort by students and towns-
people, formed the present Dav-
idson Energy Group to deal
with all aspects of the energy
problem. Two subgroups were
then formed, the Nuclear
Action Group and a Future
Energy Sources Group.

The Nuclear Action Group,
headed by Litith Otey, rep-
resents that segment of the

overall” Group which is pri-.

marily concerned with problems
related: to nuclear. power. The

group, having studied nuclear |

power for the last nine months,
is-strongly “opposed to the
expansion of the commercial
nuclear power industry, ex-
plained Little.

This opposition is based on
various factors, he said, some of
the most notable being, “the
lack of a proven and safe means
of disposing of radioactive nuc-
lear wastes which can remain

‘dangerously radioactive for tens

of thousands of years, the
potentially disastrous results of
a major accident at a nuclear
power plant, the potentially
dangerous results of an accident
involving transport of radio-
active material, the potential
for increased proliferation of
nuclear weapons with the ex-
pansion of commercial nuclear
industries around the world,
and government underwriting
of the nuclear industry.”

The Future Energy Sources
group represents those mem-
bers of the C.E.G. who are
primarily concerned with con-
servation and alternate energy
systems, according to Little.
The group has contacts with the
N. C. Conservation Council, the
N.C. Solar Energy Association,
and the newly formed N.C.
Coalition for Renewable Energy
Resources, and, Little said, the

group hopes to draw on all these
organizations for information
and other technical resources.

Some of the aims of this
group are to promote implemen-
tation of solar and other appro-
priate technologies, to help the
college develop a comprehensive
conservation and energy policy,
to provide a research file on
conservation and energy alter-
natives for use by people within
the Davidson community, and
to develop demonstration pro-
jects to promote the use of solar

energy.

“‘Tdeologically, the Davidson
Energy Group supports efforts
for a moratorium on the expan-
sion of the nuclear power in-
dustry,” Little stated.

Yet the group realizes the
need to present a viable, econo-

mically feasible alternative to
nuclear power. Therefore its aim
is also to distribute information
and resources which will pro-
mote conservation and the use
of such decentralized energy
systems as solar hot water
heaters and wood burning
stoves. The aim is to achieve a
maximum of energy efficiency
and self-sufficiency in every
home or building in the com-
munity,” Little added.

Within two weeks, Little
said, the various research files,
bibliographies, and lists of con-
tacts in related organizations.
should be set up in the college
library. Members of the group
are working with the library to
obtain books, periodicals, and
government documents related
to energy.

Other members are working
on the aforementioned compre-
hensive conservation and
energy plan for the college.
Members of the Nuclear Action
Group are circulating a petition
in town and on campus in
opposition to a proposal to
transport radioactive waste
through Charlotte, from South
Carolina to the McGuire plant,
seven miles from Davidson.

Little said the Duke Power
Company is applying for a
license to transport and store
some 300 truck-loads of spent
fuel beginning in March. ;

The Group is also working

with NC-PIRG as an inter-
vening party in the NRC li-
censing hearings to be held in
Charlotte.
' “Tt is with such projects as
these that the Davidson Energy
Group is attempting to bring
about a new concern for and a
new direction. to the entire
community’s energy future. As
a forward-looking group in its
earliest stages, the group is-
seeking support from all parts.
of the Davidson community,”
said Little.

Every Tuesday and Thursday
Nancy goes to Morganton'N.C.
She works on a research project
there from 9 am to 3 pm and

then spends four hours working —

and being with deaf children for

which she has learned sign .

language.

“It is real rewarding to help
these children who find it hard
to believe that there are people
who come to help and visit
because they want to come.’

Nancy said she also enjoys
raquetball, volleyball, basket-
ball, swimming and reading
(when there is time).

Doug, a native of Virginia, is
majoring in Sociology. He plans
“to go out, join the real world
and start making money.”

He has been captain of both
the Cross Country and Track
teams for the past three years.
Doug is also a member of the
KA fraternity, the Review
Board and plays IMAC basket-
ball.

The decision to run for the
freshman advisorship started as
a joke between Nancy and
Doug. Both had applied to be
fall counselors.

Because neither one thought
that they would be chosen,
Doug said to Nancy, “‘it’s a
shame because they'll be
missing the two best hall coun-
selors;’’ both were chosen.

During the beginning of their
junior year, they joked about
running for the freshman advi-
sor positions since they were
‘the best candidates for the
job.”

“We both enjoyed being hall
counselors and wanted to give
some input,’’ said Nancy.
“We've tried to. get out infor-
mation to the freshmen about
the many programs that David-
son offers, the Center for Spe-
cial Studies, and the foreign

studies programs that David-
son and other schools offer. ‘One
thing we were against was the
triple rooms.’ re

“We've tried to stress very
heavily the Honor System so
that it will be the foremost
thought of the students through
out .their years at Davidson ,’
Doug added. .

They said they have also tried
to encourage students to take
_Part in campus activities.

“Being a freshman advisor,”
said Nancy, ‘‘has taught me a
lot about organization, thinking
ahead and the working of
Davidson.”

‘Doug said, ‘‘I’ve met lots of
people and had to be more
organized. It’s been rewarding
and frustrating because there is
a fine line betwen-su¢cess and
failure in many of the activities
that we have planned.’

Looking back over the year,
they said they have enjoyed
working and getting to know
the hall counselors, and they ~
were pleased with orientation.

“Of course,’’ said Nancy,
‘“‘some improvements are
needed. We hope to start a
notebook filled with helpful
hints to pass on to next year’s
advisors, Anne Eglin and John
Willingham.”

Wind Ensemble toperform Tuesday

By LINDA HOOPES
- Features Editor

If you’re a music lover, or just looking for a good time, take an
hour Tuesday night and treat yourself to the Davidson Wind
Ensemble Concert. According to Music Professor William Lawing,
the 8:15 concert should only last a little over an hour, including the
intermission, so it is the perfect length for a study break.

The concert will open with Rossini’s ‘“‘March for the Sultan
Abdul Medjid’’, which is a rather long name for a short march tune.
This will be followed by William Schuman’s ‘‘New England .
Triptych,” which Lawing termed ‘the meat of the concert.”

After this collection of three colonial folk-tunes, there will be a
short intermission. The second half begins with Mozart’s
“Diverdimento for Two Oboes, Two Horns, and Two Bassoons”.

The featured instrumentalists will be Joanna Hunt, Joan
Redding, Lisa Harbottle, George Stroebel, Charles Askins and Ed
Trumbull. Toward the end of the program, Dean of Students Will

‘Terry guest stars in P.D.Q. Bach’s ‘“‘Grand Serenade for an Awful

Lot of Winds and Percussion”. This somewhat pompous, totally
frivolous piece is highlighted by a passage called the “crasho
grosso”’ which...well, you'll have to hear it yourself.

The best pieces from Tuesday’s concert will be combined with the
best of the fall concert to make up the program for the Ensemble’s
tour over Spring break. They will head to Florida,: hitting
Disneyworld, Clearwater, New Port Richey, and a few other sunny

spots.

Lawing said he is optimistic about the tour, saying that ‘ ‘playing
the saine concert five nights in a row really pulls the band —
together. . -about halfway through, the jihteng: OF Vay eee commen

nights have gone...

‘Téesdlay: nighi’s pediotilieace je the leet tor. thet Wise bere:
Spring term brings a Jazz Ensemble concert on the 19th and 21st of
April, ‘a production of Guys and Dolls using about half of the Wind
Ensemble on April 26, 27, and 28th and May 3, 4 and 5, and,
weather permitting, an outdoor Wind Ensemble Concert on May |

6th.
