CAROLINA TAKES TRACK
CARNIVAL AS WILDCATS
WIN THIRD PLACE

_ RACASKIE NORVELL 32.

Carolina made it thirteen straight when

they bagged the recent state track
championship. Duke pushed the Tar
Heels, while Davidson and State, who
finished third and fourth, respectively,
were outclassed by the leaders.

Fleagle, Davidson captain and star sprint-
er, was troubled with several ailments, which
severely hampered his style. He placed in
both dashes, however. Evans-and Frazier
were others on the sick list.

Grid Card Annotinced
By Captain Pritchett

Captain Pritchett, Davidson's athletic di-
rector, has just made public the football
schedule for next year.

Two opponents not met in 1932 have been
added, and two have been dropped. The
teams dropped are Washington and Lee and
Clemson. During the past year Davidson
beat W. & L., 7-0, and tied Clemson, 7-7.

Elon opens the season, and appears on

Nine new varsity records were set in
this annual North Carolina track car-
nival, not to mention the mighty heave
of the discus of over 152 feet by Milan
Zori of Steubenville, Ohio, sensational
N. C. State freshman. While prepping
at Massanutten Military Academy, Zori
threw the discus over 150 feet in the
southern prep championships at Chapel
Hill last season.

The Big Five baseball race swings back
and forth with Davidson, Wake Forest, and
N C.:State as the most potential contenders
for the crown won by the Deacons last year.
Davidson dropped a contest to the Dekes
and took one from Duke’s Blue Devils to
place themselves at the top of the column.

Bruce Peabody was the hitting star of
the trip to Duke and Wake, getting two
for four in each game. Big Jim Morgan
got four out of five tries off Junie Barnes,
famous Wake Forest lefthander. Shrimp
Morris likewise got on Barnes for three
out of five.

The golf team closed its season with a
meet with South Carolina, which the David-
son golfers won. The team on this south-
ern tour was composed of Captain Tom
Caldwell, Mac Manson, Bob Gregory, and
Tom Bowles, playing in the order named.
Jack Wagner and John Thompson were not
able to make the trip.

Our best congratulations to Jack Wag-
ner anyhow. That long driving titan of
the links entered the Southeastern open,
and was tied for second at the end of
the initial 36 holes of play, and even
though he slipped on the last campaign,
he turned in a 72-hole total of 317 to
lead all amateur entries in the tourney.

With the recent victory over Wake For-
est on the local courts, the tennis team
brought a successful season to a close. They
counted five victories out of eight starts.
Jim Halverstadt, John Lafferty, Charlie My-
ers, Tee Thompson, Dudley Elvery, Bob
Morrow, and Francis Scott composed the
team. Myers was captain. Halverstadt and
Myers distinguished themselves especially in
the state tournament.

Inter-fraternity baseball is drawing to
a close. The Kappa Sigs defeated the
Phi Delta Theta nine, 10 to 2, to go into
the semi-finals, where they. will en-
counter Phi Gamma Delta for the right
to meet the Pi. K. A.’s in the finals.
The Kappa Sigs won the title last year,
beating the Pikas, 5 to 4, in the final
game.

As athletics begin to come to a close for
the year, we see the teams in retrospect, and
Davidson has shown up splendidly. This is
especially true of football, baseball, wrest-
ling, track, and tennis. Although defeated
more times than they were victorious, the
Davidson golfers and basketeers showed the
Davidson fight and the Wildcat tenacity, in
addition to clean sports, and so together with
all the other athletic teams, the student body,
through this column, offers to all of you
their sincerest thanks and congratulations.

Davidsonian Picks AIll-
Star Baseball Team.

The sports editor, along with information

gléaned from various and sundry sources,

has made public the team appearing else-
where on this page, as his selection of an

all-state baseball team. A full team, plus

four pitchers, two right-handers, and two
southpaws, make up the organization.

Wagner of Duke gets the call for catcher,
over Hicks of Wake Forest and Whitley of
Davidson, both veteran receivers. The in-
field is composed of Morris of Davidson on
the initial sack, Bunting of the Deacons
holding down second, Powell of Carolina, in
the hot corner, and Mills of Davidson at
short. It was hard to leave off such players
as Joyner, Wake Forest, and McQuage,
State, at first; Weathers of Carolina on the
keystone sack, and Mackorell of Davidson
at third, but the boys picked just showed
a little more of the stuff.

The pitchers were plentiful in this state.
but four appeared to loom above the others.
Wake Forest’s illustrious Junie Barnes, and
Charlie Pearce, Davidson ace, looked like
the state’s outstanding southpaws. Of the
orthodox hurlers, Harris of Davidson and
Griffith of Carolina get the choice. Men
like Coombs of Duke, Andrews of Carolina,
Baily of Davidson, and Seitz of State, are
splendid pitchers, but the four~ named on

the team delivered more goods.
