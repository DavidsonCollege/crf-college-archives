Should Davidson Reject National Review's Guide?

Dean Williams Takes Narrow Persepctive

Administration Should Abhor
Association With Guide

ever, provoked a more passionate
response. The criterion used in this

closed-mindedness and hostility to
differences that a college educa-
tion is supposed to overcome.

tunities for blacks in higher educa-
tion. Davidson should be proud of
these qualities, not feel a need to
defend them. The only way our
society can overcome the status
quo, acondition of continued preju-
dice, ignorance,and egocentricity,
is by the kind of education and
openness that diversity and Lead-
ership South promote.

Courses on Women and Litera-
ture or Afro-American Relations
are not as hostile to higher educa-
tion as the National Review would
have you believe. In fact, these
kinds of subjects foster apprecia-
tion for the unjust barriers many in
our society have had to struggle
with and still must confront. Sup-
porters of the National Review’s
kind of conservatism also try to
make the connection that taking
such courses compromises one’s
appreciation for his or her own
heritage. Making such a relation is
ridiculous. If someone is black he
or she should be proud. Likewise,
if someone is white, they should be
proud. What diversity of student
body and courses attempts to in-
still is that we are all human beings,
that we should embrace and be
proud together.

As representative for supposedly progressive
institution Dean Williams and all associated
with Davidson College must abhor such adher-

ence to the status quo.

This college feels a need to skirt
the issue as much as possible,
considering the number of sup-
porters of the college that probably
subscribe to the National Review’s

opinions. However, if Davidson’

wants tO progress and attract a
national student body, as the ad-
ministration has said, then the
school must reject the distinction
bestowed on it more forcefully.
The National Review’s Guide
criticizes Davidson’s “subtle, but
growing emphasis on ‘diversity’”
and it’smembership in Leadership

Davidson, her students, faculty,
andadministration, should be more
than “uneasy” about its inclusion
in the National Review’s College
Guide. Dean Williams, since you

‘ were chosen as spokesman to the

public on this issue, you must do
more than say Davidson “regret[s]”
the standards of the National Re-
view and its backward conserva-
tism.

As representative for a sup-
posedly progressive institution
you, and all associated with
Davidson College, must abhor
such adherence to the status quo.

Iraqis Should Try

In spite of your requests for
student contributions, I have been
proud of myself for resisting ‘the
temptation to write. I’ve been too
busy to open cans of worm in the
Davidsonian. Unfortunately for
me, the last issue contained two
(yes, two) topics crying out for
responses, so I gave in.

To begin with, I would like to
thank Sara Carlson for mentioning
the North Carolina Student Legis-
lature (NCSL) in her column, Asa
founding member of the current
Davidson Delegation who hasbeen
trying to build membership since
1989, I appreciate any publicity
which might increase participation.

However, I think I ought to correct
the blanket assumption that the
NCSL is “socially conscious” in
the same manner as Amnesty Inter-
national and the other groups she
mentioned.

Although the NCSL’s 54 years
have created something of a pro-
gressive history, we are a rather
diverse bunch. On the one hand, in
September we went on record as
supporting significantly increased
federally-mandated Corporate
Average Fuel Economy Standards,
and we also called for research in
the U. S. of RU-486, the so-called

Not quite, Dr. Williams.

Once again, the calm and rea-
soned columnists (that’s us) at the
“South’s Foremost College
Weekly,” are pleased to be able to
present to you, the students of
Davidson College, that rarity of
expression ‘we like to call “the
Truth.” Rare indeed is the college
administrator whose opinion of the
National Review isany higher than
the crown of Mike Dukakis’ head.
Is this, then, the reason Dr. Wil-
liams takes so dim a view of NR’s
College Guide? It certainly didn’t

education is grounded in a little
more than polemical demagogu-
ery. We spoke with Brad Miner,
literary editor for the National Re-
view, and he reiterated the criteria
upon which NR based its guide
(not a ranking). “‘Above all, we
looked for schools that, overall,
achieve academic excellence 1. by
the quality and availability of the
faculty; 2. by the quality of the
curriculum .. . that respects: the

‘tradition of the West; and 3. by the

quality of the intellectual
environment-the entire university
community.” Doesn’t seem un-
reasonable yet. In fact, Davidson
was judged to provide an excellent
academic base: “At Davidson, the
focus of the institution remains on

wards research.”

_ Asacorollary to
Davidson’ shiring practice, the Re-
view notes Davidson’s “boasts that
three of the eight professors hired
for the 1990-91 year are African-
American.” TheReview goes onto
suggest that “Given the paucity of

“minority candidates and the in-

‘tense competition among elite uni-
versities for politically correctand
credentialed black candidates, we
can only wonder to what extent
Davidson maybe willing to sacri-
fice: academic«quality fori ‘diver-
sity.’” Perhaps this isthereferénce
Dr. Williams alludes to in: his as-
sertion that the Review sees female
faculty members as decay; we can
find no other reference.

According to the “political
tract,” a study done by the Gallup
Organization revealed that 25 per
cent of America’s college seniors
could not tell the difference be-
tween the words of Stalin and
Churchill; could not distinguish
the language of Das Kapital from
the U. S. Constitution; could not
even recall that Christopher Co-
lumbus first reached the New
World before 1500.” Even worse,
a study done by the National En-
dowment for the Humanities sug-
gests that “educational programs
are sO unstructured in America’s
colleges thatitis possible to gradu-
ate from 78 per centof the nation’s
colleges and universities without
ever taking a course in the history
of Western Civilization, or from
38 per cent without taking any
course in history at all?” Funny, it
seems that Western Civilization is

view, and in turn troubled Dr.
Williams, has more to do with our
successes than with our failures.
“Davidson now appears to be
moving into the ranks of the na-
tion’s elite liberal arts colleges.”
Unfortunately, therein lies our
peril. “Professor Donald Kagan,
dean of Yale College, recently re-
marked that, although he favors
the core-curriculum idea, he will
not press to. see a program of re-
quirements return to Yale. Imag-
ine, he says, what kind of core re-
quirements the left-wing faculty
and administration . . . would in-
flict upon Yale’s students, ” Thus,
Davidson’sannouncementofanew
concentration in “ethnic studies”
seems like the harbinger for our
own initiation into-the exclusive
