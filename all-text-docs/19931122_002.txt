Davidson named model institution for "hands on" neuroscience

By Jeff Fuller

Project Kaleidoscope, a na-
tional science enrichment effort,
has chosen Davidson College as a
model institution for its neuro-
science program.

The neuroscience program
was chosen for its involvement of

students in actual neuroscience re-
search. Project Kaleidoscope will
inform other colleges and univer-
sities about Davidson’s program
with the goal of revolutionizing
undergraduate mathematics and
science education.

the surrounding land was owned
by Lake Norman Company.

The college recently took ad-
vantage of the Lake Norman
Company’s declaration of bank-
ruptcy to buy additional land at
reasonable prices. In the last year,
Davidson has purchased a nine acre
parcel of land adjacent to their
original property and an eleven
acre parcel across North-East Drive
from the other properties.

Bob Sutton, Vice President for
Business and Finance, explains the
college’s interests in the land as an
opportunity to exercise some “con-
trol over the appropriateness and
attractiveness of the entrance to
both the town and the college” as
well as “an opportunity to make a
long term investment in an en-
deavor which promises to be prof-
itable for the college endowment.”

Sutton points to the rapid
build-up in the Lake Norman/Cor-
nelius area and to the continuing
growth of Charlotte to justify his
belief that there is and will be an
increasing market for this type of
development in the Davidson area.
He hopes that this sort of foresight
and planning will enable the col-

lege to benefit from the expansion.
Mr. Sutton views the development
as a long range proposition to be
pursued as the market justifies.

The imposition of Davidson’s
Strict new watershed regulations
on October 1 of this year, however,
provided impetus for the college to
accelerate its planning schedule.
The college, in conjunction with
planner Nick O’Shaughnessy,
completed initial development
plans for the area which were ap-
proved by the Davidson Town
Planning Commission and Town
Board of Commissioners prior to
the imposition of the new regula-
tions. The plans, nevertheless, in-
clude a collection pond and a high
ratio of trees to paved areas, com-
plying to watershed restrictions.

The college will complete an
overall plan as well as market re-
search within the next two to three
years and will then begin looking
for tenants. Buildings, which will
probably include a day care center,
a high quality hotel, office space
and some retail shops with apart-
ments, will be built in accordance
with the college’s specifications,

Development of the area will
be completed over a ten year pe-
riod. :

_ The Pre-Law Society held an
organizational meeting on Tues.,
Nov. 16th in the 900 room.

At the meeting Carol Jordan,
Director of Career Service and
prelaw advisor, said the past soci-
eties have speakers and forums.

Junior Rachel Worlds called
for a more active prelaw society
and opened the floor for discus-
sion. Some suggestions included
information about when to apply
for LSATs and how much money
is involved applying tolaw school.

Pre-Law Society starts year

The other half of the meeting
was a presentation by the Meck-
lenburg Bar Association on “Per-
sonal Perspectives on Going to
Law School and Practicing Law."
Seven lawyers spoke about their
experiences. Several questions
were posed by students concern-
ing law school preparation. The
lawyers discussed the importance
of writing and analytical thought.
They also saw business and hu-
man nature classe as helpful.

closed over the Thanksgiving
break after 47 years active at
Davidson. ATO cooks Sue White
and Ann Beatty served their last
meal the week before break. White
and Beatty, who worked in the
PiKA house before switching over
to ATO, commented that the men
of ATO were “friendlier, more
understanding and easier to get
along with.”

courages a “lean laborage science
curriculum” which involves con-
centration on a few general disci-
plines. Instead of studying several
specific subjects, students would
undergo an “intensive hands-on
experience” where they would run
actual experiments.

Dr. Julio Ramirez, Davidson
professor of neuroscience in the
psychology department, also be-
lieves in using “intensive hands-
on experience” to educate his stu-
dents in neuroscience. He believes
“doing” science rather than simply
learning about it will enrich the
experience.

Students of Dr. Ramirez assist
him in his research of Alzheimer’s
disease, for which he has received
several grants including a $102,000
grant from the National Institute of
Neurological Disorders and
Strokes.

Ramirez began his research in
1977 as a graduate student, al-
though he did not intend to study
Alzheimer’s disease. He was first
studying neuroplasticity in the

portion of

the brain. In 1985, studies con-
firmed how this occurs in the brains
of Alzheimer’s patients.

Dr. Ramirez has used ‘his
grants to get students to collabo-
rate with him on his research. His
laboratory contains extremely ad-
vanced technological instruments
for a small college. Neuroscience
students use the instruments to as-
sist Dr. Ramirez in his research.

Neuroscience research is com-
prised of three different areas of
study: behavioral, physiological,
and anatomic. With behavioral
neuroscience, one studies the ef-
fects of behavior as changes in the
brain occur. Physiological studies
involve studying how neurons
communicate electrically. Ana-
tomic studies involve research into
the changes of brain structure after
injury.

.. Ramirez’s students are in-
volved in all these fields of study.
Their studies involve performing
brain surgery on rats and analysis
of the brain.

Davidson students Tim

Carrigan, Meredith McQuilkin,

and Jimmy DeVries are now in-
volved in Dr. Ramirez’s research.
Jimmy DeVries has found that his
research has “a lot of application to
people” and he hopes to “make a
significant contribution to society.”

Ramirez’s students are already
being recognized internationally.
Gordon LeGrand, one of Dr.
Ramirez’s students who graduated
last year, presented his senior the-
sis at an international conference
attended by scientists from all over
the world.

This year’s neuroscience stu-
dents will also undergo an interna-
tional experience studying at the
Medical School at the University
of Magdeburg in eastern Germany
where they willspend three weeks,
Ulf Wiegmann, a student from the
Medical School at the University
of Magdeburg is now at Davidson.

Ramirez’s reasons for creat-
ing the neuroscience concentra-
tion are to build an “informed citi-
zenry” concerning science and be-

_cause he believes that “science lit-

eracy is of critical importance to
the health of our society.”

Students led by Brett Marston and Sherry Abdelaaty started a weekly coffeehouse at the Outpost

Jumping Java Cafe serves as gathering place

By Jenny Schroeter
- Davidson students have anew
alternative for Saturday afternoons.
The Jumping Java Cafe, formerly
known as The International Coffee
House, is now open from 2-8 every
Saturday in the Union Outpost.
Junior co-chair Sherry
Abdelaaty states the cafe’s primary
purpose is to give students “a so-
cial alternative to the court.”
Students are able toinformally
gather there. In addition to various
flavors of coffee being served, fruit
juices and snacks are provided.
While eating and talking, stu-

dents can play cards and listen toa —

large CD collection. The cafe also
has Davidson. students perform

occasionally.’

Sophomore Holley Wilson,

who visited the cafe; said, “It’s a
really good forum for dabbling
musicians, and I think they should
use it as such.” ere

The atmosphere is also con-
ducive tostudying. Many students
bring a book to study. Other stu-
dents come and meet with class-
mates to discuss topics from their
courses. ;

fifth time the Cafe was open. At-
tendance has been on the rise ever
since the first opening. Around
forty students showed up last Sat-
urday.

Chairs, senior Brett Marston
and Sherry Abdelaaty, hope to fur-
ther increase the participation by

‘possibly getting a band to perform

sometime in the future.
They also hope to eventually
extend the hours of the cafe. “We

‘would like to eventually make the

Jumping Java Cafe stay open later
in order to make it a true alterna-

tive to Patterson Court,” said co-
chairman Sherry Abdelaaty.

Jumping Java Cafe is free to
Davidson students. Donations are
welcome, though. In order to help
with environmental efforts, the
chairs ask that you bring your own
coffee mug when attending.

Jane Brock, who went to the
cafe for the first time last week,
seemed to sum up the new Jump-
ing Java Cafe by stating, “It’s good
coffee, good music, and good talk.
It is definitely something that ev-
eryone should check out.”
