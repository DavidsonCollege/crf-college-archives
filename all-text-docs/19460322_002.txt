cA Great Man....

In the eves of many *in American Mr.
Winston Churchhill is the greatest living
man of today. His very manner is one of a
very determined character, as is evident in
the way he directed the [english people in
the dark days of World War 1.

or the past several weeks the American
people have been playing host to the great
British statesman, who caine to this country
to rest and not to make speeches, but when
he did consent to-do the latter, it was in
the role of a private citizen.

As a result of his world-shaking Fulton
speech, Mr. Churchill succeeded in breaking
the consistent silence of Premier Stalin, who,
heretofcve, d:dn’t know how to talk back.

Mr. Churchill's speech: in New York,
which was far more consefyvative in con-
tent, than was his Missouri address, called
for faith in the UNO to preserve world
peace, and to hold the Russians in check.

Whether Mr, Churchill meant to advance
a military alliance between Great Britian
and America in his Missouri speech is cer-
tainly not necessary or pertinent at this
time.

Americans and British know only too well
that in such an event, nothing whatever
could keep them apart. What good is a piece
of paper at this time between two countries
Whose affinity is historic, and whose fu
ture depends upon their inseparable unity ?

It is time now for us to make full use of the
UNO to the end of perpetuating the peace of
the world. America and Great Britian could
not achieve that end alone, and any separate

- alliances between the two great powers would
only interfere with the success of the organiza-
tion.

Mr. Churchill meant only to voice his
anyone else, and we have no right to doubt
his faith in the UNO. He has done: what
few others would dare to do—he has made
every government in the world look to him
with the truth about Russia,

Mr. Churchill meant only to. voice his
honest convictions as to-eurrent develop-
ments, and many Americans, who are also
concerned with the Western future, will
honor him for his wisdom and praise him
for his wisdom.

Letters To The
Editor ....

Dear Editor :-

To those veterans who have returned to
Davidson after having had their education
interrupted, there are many changes in the
old “set-up” of our campus life. The new
men and veterans who have entered college
for the first time assume that the entire
campus procedure and mode is asjt, has
been always. None of us will say that some
of the changes were not necessary with the
conung of the government training units
ind a much smaller civilian student body
mit now that everything has returned to a
semblence of nornmraley, these changes
should be righted,

The student store has been always in past
the center of campus life and the meeting
place of all when not attending chapel or class.
Its vdry location was for the most part the
finest asset and made those friendly get-to-
gethers simple indeed.

Iirst let me say a word for the location
of the “stud™ store. It would be much more
convenient to have it back behind Georgia
in the old location. When itwas there be-
fore it was possible to get milk and donuts
almost any hour of the day and not involve
t-cross Campus trek as does the present
situation, \nother thing was the schedule
Which the door was kept open at all
nours except for one half hour during the
meal periods—s8 :00 A. M. ‘til 12:00 P.M.
True, there are certain hardships to over-
‘ome in moving back to the above mention-
ed location, but it can be done—The light=
ing-in the present place is not as good as
that found in most barns,

by

Secondly, the self-service system should
be re-instated immediately thus putting our
honor system back to work as it should
be working. Seeing this system practiced
nthe “stud” is a constant reminder to all,
1 the type life that prevails on the David-
son College campus. When the new gym
is built, the plans for the Student Union
will go forward and the results will doubt-
vess be gratifying but until that time, which
is definitely uncertain, let’s move the stu-
dent store back to the old location and back
tothe self-service. system,

Thanks for the opportunity—
—MeAlister Carson, Jr.

Dear Iditor :-

Many of us who. have returned in the
last two months to Davidson feel that the
present Student Store leaves much to be
lesired in comparison to the Student Store
of bye me days.

One of the better features of the former
store was its location tn proximity to the

-dormitory row. Being situated behind and al-

most in the center of the dormitories, it ser-
ved as a gathering place for those who wished
to get a quick snack. I am sure that many stu-
dents including myself feel now that a bit to
eat is hardly worth the hike over to the pre-
sent location in the gym.

As I reeall the former store, the policy
was to remain open trom eight o'clock in
the morning until at least midnight. Now
however, with the present nranagements
“bankers? hours” that are in effect, 1
usually take a walk over to the gym, only
-tind.the store closed.

I understand why the counter system of
service was a necessity while there were sol-
diers on the campus, but now with the return
of our normal student-body, it would seem
that we could revert back to the ‘old system
of self service. It would certainly be more
convenient to the clerk on duty as well as
to the students themselves.

‘

I hope that-sometime in the near future
we may see some changes that would make
the store more as it was before the war. If
not-in-leeation, at least the -hours of busi-
ness lengthened and the self-service method
employed.

‘ Sincerely yours,

George Ennett.
