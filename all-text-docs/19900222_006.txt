“Do Lord” dramatizes lives of
American slaves

By JOHN EARLES

“Do Lord, Remember
Me” was brought to
Davidson by:‘the Artists
Series on February 13. The
play centers upon the recol-
lections of four elderly
Americans, each eager to
share his or her story with
the audience. In many
ways, the charactersare like
any elderly people. Their
memories include hopes
and fears in both good times
and bad.

In one important way,
however, the characters are
quite unusual: they were all
raised under the institution
of slavery.

The action takes place in
1936 at the Old Folks Home
for the Colored in Virginia.
Written by Jim DeJongh, the
play is based on over 2,000
actual interviews of ex-
slaves that took place in the
1930s. Because verbatim
text from these interviewsis

used, the play possesses a hor-
rific realism in its depictions of
lives enslaved.

Slaves were treated like ani-
mals: sold to the highest bid-
der, transported in cages, fed in
troughs and whipped into
submission. Moreover, slaves
were often tortured far worse
than any animal could be:
women raped on the whim of
the master, a little girl killed on
the spot after dropping her
master’s grandbaby, and men,
women and children threat-
ened with being sold away
from everyone they loved.

“Do Lord, Remember Me” is
alsoa play that reveals peoples’
ability to make the best of any
situation. With snickers and
guffaws, the characters and the
audience share the lighter
moments that come just from
being alive.

In addition, the audience
was amused with myths on the
creation of the different races.
Inonestory,God gathersall the

people of the world together.
Hecolorssome yellow, some
white and some red before
noticing that some of his fol-
lowers are missing. After
several hours, the people
arrive and explain their tar-
diness on having been
asleep. God’s anger is magni-
fied when the people rush his
throne inan effort to be given
a color. The story ends as
God's screams of “Get Back!”
are heard as “Get Black!” and
the black race is formed in an
accident of creation.

Ironically, the humor of the
story is joined by the sadness
of a race taught to be
ashamed of the color of their
skin.

“Do Lord, Remember Me”
was an enjoyable and infor-
mative performance. We
have all been taught the
importance of learning from
our elders, and in this case,
there was something to be
learned by everyone.

Student journal recalls soldiers, ghosts and despair

By MEREDITH GOODING
Meredith Gooding, ‘91, spent time in
Nicaragua during the summer of 1989.
The following is a journal entry.

As I walked across the border be-
tween Costa Rica and Nicaragua I
listened
with con-
centration
to hear the
songs of the
country.
The first
sound I[°
heard was
the rustle of
the. plastic
red and
black FSLN
flags hung
from the roof of thea wooden shelter
just inside the gate guarded by sev-
eral listless soldiers standing in the
dust.

Through the bus windows there is
the unbroken pattern of land and
people on a single palette. The twin
volcanos of Lake Nicaragua rise
majestically in the distance, framed
by verdant pastureland and small
settlements that we pass through as
we travel deeper into the country.

Children with no clothing and
protruding bellies stand in the door-
ways of their homes constructed
from wood and metal scraps, their
faces expressive yet impenetrably si-
lent--the face of Nicaragua.

On to Managua, a city of bones.

Bones and rotting carcasses of history
unable to completely disintegrate in
their parched climate. Skeletons of
buildings sustain life within their
cracked foundations. The only colors
are the walls, canvas of the people,
slashes of red black and blue graffiti that

derbrush. Hungry eyes peer out of

buildings and
bus windows
looking at our
group of grin-
gos with an
unreadable
expression.

yes in Nicaragua Libre there is life, a
panorama of change.

What is a country anyway? What
is a people anyway?
