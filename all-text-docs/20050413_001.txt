Trustees’ recent change allowing

non-Christians on the board.

Belk and Smith were two of the
five members of the board to vote
against the proposed. changes,
while 31 members supported the
changes.

“We regret [their resignations] a
great deal,” said President Vagt.
“We will miss their guidance and
counsel.”

John McCartney ’74, Chairman
of the Board of Trustees, echoed
Vagt’s sentiments about Belk, say-
ing, “John Belk and his family
have been magnificent supporters
and benefactors, and I understand
and respect his disagreement and
we continue to be appreciative of
everything he’s done.”

While both resigned in protest,
each man had a slightly different
reason.

Belk’s resignation was largely
the result of his disagreement with
the board’s decision.

“I was against the change and |
got voted down,” Belk said. “I
think Davidson ought to remain a
Christian school governed by
Christians.”

Smith’s resignation was based
mostly on his objections to the
process by which this change came
about.

“My view of the process was it

was basically someone’s personal
agenda to get this rule changed,
and the process was orchestrated to
get that end,” he said.

The specific vote included
allowing up to 20 percent of the
board to be composed of non-
Christians, revising the College’s
Statement of Purpose in order to
reinforce Davidson’s commitment
to its Reformed heritage and the
addition of an endowed chair spe-
cializing in Reformed theology.

Disagreement over the change

Belk’s resignation centered on
his fundamental belief that, as a
Christian college, Davidson should
be completely governed by
Christian individuals.

“If the trustees are not all
Christian, then it weakens the
school and takes away what makes
us unique,” he said.

Smith was not completely
opposed to allowing non-
Christians on the board, saying that
he would not be opposed to allow-
ing non-Christian alumni serve on
the board.

He was, however, opposed to the
board’s reasoning that allowing
non-Christians on the board was in
line with Davidson’s Presbyterian

Number of missing library
books reaches ten-year high

By BLEVIN SHELNUTT
Senior Staff Writer

Five hundred and eighty-four
books have been reported lost from
the E.H. Little Library according to
a memo sent by Library Director
Leland Park on March 30.

The number of missing library
books has not been this high in
over ten years. Only once since the
1995-1996 school year has the
number of missing books sur-
passed 200. °

The books were declared lost
upon the completion of an invento-
ry of over 600,000 items that began
in June.

_ The inventory covers a two-year
period; consequently, an average of
nearly 300 books was lost each

year.

“Few libraries in the country
take a complete annual inventory
as do we,” Park said. “It’s some-
thing of which we are very proud,
for it means our catalogue is cur-
rent and our stacks get back in
order.”

Though Park described the num-
ber of missing books as “amazing-
ly low,” considering between
50,000 and 60,000 items are
checked out each year, he said 584
lost books is still an unacceptable
number.

Many valuable books have not
been recovered, including 54 gen-
eral reference books, four chem-
istry reference books, and 12
videos.

The costs of these replacements

are covered by individual depart-
ments’ library accounts, conse-
quently draining the department’s
ability to purchase new items and
texts.

Generally half of the books
reported lost are returned within
the next two years.

Sixty-one books __ previously
reported as lost, some as long as 15
years ago, were found or returned,
according to this year’s inventory.

The library prides itself on its
book return system and _ history.
Many tour guides point out the lack
of book-detection devices in the
library doorways to prospective
students and describe Davidson’s
success rate in maintaining its
inventory.

Students in Dr. Cynthia Lewis’s Performing Shakespeare class

rehearse a scene from “Much Ado About Nothing.”

Something from ‘Nothing’

By Liz BARRY
News Editor

After a hearty potluck meal, the
sixteen members of English
Professor Cynthia Lewis’
Performing Shakespeare class
devoted their Saturday night to
sewing colorful Elizabethan-wear.

The late night “sewing party”
was one of countless ways the class
prepared for the production of
“Much Ado About Nothing,”
which opens at 7:30 p.m. Friday
night in the Chambers Gallery.

“There’s nothing like a sewing
circle at a professor’s house on a
Saturday night to encourage class
cohesion,” said Putnam Ivey 705,
who plays Friar Francis and
Sexton. “And I have to admit,
we’re all bona fide Shakespeare
nerds.”

The student-run play is the cul-

minating project of the intensive’
Performing Shakespeare course,
which emphasizes the study of
Shakespeare through performance.
The play runs Friday through
Tuesday and tickets cost $4.

Lewis selected “Much Ado
About Nothing” because many of
its themes resonate with college
students. Full of wit, deception and
folly, “Much Ado About Nothing”
recounts the tumultuous love
affairs of four young lovers. ,

“It is also about the way words
complicate things and deceive and ~
get in the way,” Lewis said.
“Thinking too much and not think-
ing enough both get you into trou-
ble in this play and I think that our
students can relate to that.” ’

Lewis said that Davidson stu-
dents may be able to relate to the
relationship between  Beatrige

Mock Trial places at Nationals

The Davidson College Mock Trial Team took seventh place
out of 64 teams at the American Mock Trial Association
National Championship in Des Moines last weekend.

“Given the intensity of the competition and the talent of the
other attending schools, | was extremely excited about our
seventh place finish,” said team vice-president Andrea Wood
’07. “The team really came together at the end."
