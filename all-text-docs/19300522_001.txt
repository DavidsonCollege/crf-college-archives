Bishop Penick Talks on
Whether Thomas Was an
Honest Skeptic or Not

Large Vesper Audience Shows Deep
Interest in Charlotte Bishop’s Talk

DOUBTING IS NOT SIN

Thomas Was Ernest Seeker After
the Truth

“Except I shall see in His hands the print
of the nails, and put my hands in his side,
I will not believe.” With these words as a
nucleus, Bishop E. A. Penick, of Charlotte,
presented the idea in a very clear and con-
cise manner that Thomas really was not a
skeptic.

He began by saying that although Thomas
is considered by most people to hrve been
a doubter, he was not the only one who
doubted, for the other ten disciples also were
skeptics. When the eleven heard of Christ’s
resurrection they said it was just idle tall,
crazy women, or an hallucination. The others
did not believe until they had proved it for
themselves, but according to Bishop Pen-
ick, Thonias had that English type of mind
which is anxious to believe, but cannot ac-
cept facts as facts until proven. to be true.
He said we all have that kind of mind to
some degree and it is a sign we are think-
ing, if we have honest doubts. The point
was brought out that honest doubting is no
sin, The human mind is so infinitesimal as
compared with God's and we can't be ex-
pected to grow to maturity unless we have
honest doubts to surmount. He said that
Thomas was one of the most loyal of the
disciples, which statement can be proved by
his own statement made at the time Jesus
was considering going to the side of Laz-
arus. All the other eleven apostles said it
would be deliberate suicide, but Thomas said
that the only course for the disciples to take
was. to go with Christ, if He wanted to go
to Bethany. He was not a scoffer and he
wanted to have,the truth proved to him,
because he was still in the vicinity of Jeru-
salem a week after Jesus was crucified and
he accepted the invitation of the other ten
apostles to go to the upper room with them
so they might be able to see Christ.

Bishop Penick also averred that unbelief is
not a sign of-intellectual superiority, but that
the man who says he believes everything in
his creed without reservation probably means
that he hasn't used his head much. We have
many difficulties and troubles which we
ought to meet squarely and then surmount
them. When we have grappled with a prob-
lem and then conquered it and know the
truth, then we have faith which is based on
solid rock and is unable to be overthrown.

In conclusion he said that we ought to
tolerate skeptics and invite them into our
circles in order to help them with their
problems. They are just in a period of transi-
tion and we ought’ to help them place their
faith on firm ground. He stated that life is
just a projection which Christ claims to be
true and when we have met all our prob-
lems and finally convinced ourselves that
Christ is a then

we have everlasting
life. :

Stage Curtains are
Donated By Seniors

The gift of the Class of ’30 to Davidson

For Comic Magazine

Next year there will be a magazine, which
will be published four times a year, two of
a literary nature and two comic magazines.
This was decided on by a vote of the stu-
dent body taken Wednesday morning, May
14. R. F. Jarrett, retiring editor of the Da-
vidson College magazine known as _ the
Chameleon, brought this up before the stu-
dent body and it was passed almost unani-

mously by the students.
The editor of the literary side of the
magazine will be R. E. Witt. He announced

his staff for the coming year to cOnsist of the
following men; R. S. Overman, short stories;
Norman Raies, essays; J. B. Black, dra-
matics; the poetry editor will be picked later.

Araifield Chosen to
Lead Baseball Team

Bill Poe Also Cho Chosen to Lead

Tennis Team

At recent meeting of the lettermen, cap-
tains and managers of two prominent spring
sports were elected. Nab Armfield, versatile
catcher, was chosen to lead the Wildcat nine
of next year and Marion Hunter was,elected
manager. The tennis lettermen Bill
Poe, No. 5 on thfs year’s team, to captain
them next year and’ J. L. Hall as man-
ager.

Armfield was first string catcher
year’s team, playing a’ steady game at all
times. He was not a flashy player, being
rather weak at bat, but was without peer
when it came to fielding, as his percentage
of .987 in this line will show. He boasted a
mark of only .250 in batting, which was due
more or less to his injury in the latter part of
the season resulting in blood poisoning and
causing his absence from the line-up, which
was greatly felt by his teammates, for three
or four weeks. Armfield is well known on
the campus, being a prominent member of
the “D” Club and also a member of Sigma
Alpha Epsilon social fraternity. Marion Hun-
ter, newly-elected manager, is a member of
Pi Kappa Phi social fraternity. The other
managers are Dan) LaFar, Freshman man-
ager; Allen Whitehead, John Keller, and
Jim Abernathy, Junior managers.
