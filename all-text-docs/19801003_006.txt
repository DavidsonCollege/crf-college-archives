Newtie Jolinston shares a few secrets of Davidson's pre-coed days

By JAMES BARRAT

Sandwiched p between
.M&M’s and the Duke Power
office, straight across from
Concord Road, stands a house
that stores a lifetime of photo-
graphed history and personal
memories of the town of David-
son’s past. It’s owner, however,
~keeps with her more memories
than could any building. She is
Mrs. Newtie Diel Johnston,
older than she'd like to say and,
as she told me, ‘‘Independent!”’

“We were like one big fam-
ily,’’ she says of Davidson
students of ages past, who
would come to the Johnston
home and generally raise the
roof as Newtie and her parents
banged out tunes on the piano
and guitar. ‘‘They were awfully
wild when I was a young girl.”’

And there was dancing, too.
“You could get put out of
church for that!’’ But her
parents didn’t mind, so the

living room became a dance hall.

for the Davidson gents and
their dates. ‘‘Otherwise, they’d
have to go to Charlotte.”
Women were a rarity around
the campus in those pre-coedu-
cation days, and, as she says,
our Davidson predessors were
quick to show their appreciation
if. one happened to wander
around. “You'd think the town
was on fire if a girl set foot on
the campus!’’ She also recalls
that in order to correspond with
a town girl by mail, the inter-

ested Davidson man had to first
get permission from the College
president. —

To describe Mrs. Johnston as
a “town girl” would be inaccur-

“ate. She--was educated at the

Statesville Female College and
worked as a nurse for a time
before marrying Harris A.
Johnston and moving to Ohio,
where he was an engineer for the
American Bridge Company.

“The ‘A’ stands for Alfonso, —

but he was too embarrassed to
tell anyone,” she confides.

This house was built by Newtie Johnston's father in 1908.

The two returned to David-
son in 1956 to live in the house
where she grew up, the one on
Main Street that her father,
B.C. Diel, built. In addition to
this house, Mr. Diel built many
other homes around Davidson
as well as the buildings that are
now M&M’s and the dress shop
beside it. He owned much
property in Davidson, in parti-
cular the buildings from the
Peregrine House to M&M’s.

“Wild as bucks!” says Mrs.
Johnston of the Davidson men

of yesteryear. One of their
pranks, she remembers, was the
time some Davidson ‘‘bucks”
put ‘old Doc Harding’s horse-
cart on the dome of Chambers
in the wee hours of the morning,
leaving his horse in his class-
room.

She related that a darker,
but more practical, nocturnal
practice among the students
enrolled in Davidson’s now-
extinct medical school was that
of snatching bodies for dissec-
tion. ‘‘As soon as they heard

John Huston’s The Maltese

detective stories. Lovers coldly

Spade’s grin shines with cyn-

world of modern San Francisco.
The Maltese Falcon tells of a
giant, amoral treasure hunt in
which each character reveals his
gutless egotism. Spade appears
to be the most: amoral of all
until the end. At that point
Huston shows the hollowness of
material values and the
strength of moral ones. The
Maltese Falcon becomes a par-

be far inferior to the second,” he
added.

“It’s also important to note
that there weren’t enough stud-
ents in the past going directly

. into the job market to justify a
large number of interviewers.
Before this year only 35 people
came to us looking for work.
This year over 100 have already
come in. Now that the numbers
are there, we can bring in more
recruiters.”’ ;

all Davidson people went to
grad school. We obviously have
to get out the word that things
have changed.”

A major problem in schedul-
ing recruiters is the breadth of
student interests.

“Out of the 100 forms return-
ed to us from seniors this year,
only 20 were interested in
business and finance,’’ Wood
said. '

“It’s hard to ask recruiters to
come to speak to only one or
two students in a fairly restrict-
ed field. It’s not so hard for
those with business interest but
when people are interested in
such different things, it’s diffi-
cult to take a mass approach.”

Growing student interest in
corporate job placement has
already caused changes within
the Center.

“We are committed to doub-
ling the number of recruiters

here this year,’’ Wood said, ‘‘we /

also are introducing a Mentor
program, where students will be
given the opportunity to estab-
lish alumni contacts in a given
field to obtain advice and
support. Getting hooked into
this Good Buddy system is

“important, since 85 % of all jobs.

America in The Big Sleep puts
mother against child and friend
against friend. Bogart solves
the crime in cold blood and yet
somehow manages to see that
justice is done. A line from
Thomas Pynchon summarizes
the Bogart attitude towards
life. “Be cool, but care.”’

In a universe which we did
not make and can do little to
change, what other attitude
should we hold? The Big Sleep

speak as truly as the day they

that a body had died, they’d go
there that night and dig it up,”
she told me. Surprised in the
act, two Davidson seniors had
been forced to abandon one such
corpse near the gravesite. When
they returned to school the two
recruited a third student to
retrieve it. He went on horse
back and sat the corpse in front
of him like a passenger. The
unlucky med student was cau-
ght by dawn as he rode into
Davidson, but saved himself by
repeatedly yelling ‘‘Sit up!”
and ‘‘Don’t pretend, you're
drunk!’’ to the corpse, con-
vincing the awakening town
that he was escorting an inebri-
ated pal back home.

When Mrs. Johnston return-
ed to Davidson in 1956 it was
‘like coming home to a different
town.”’ The students she had
once known were gone, but they
still come back to see her
sometimes. She used to know
every professor at Davidson,
but now there are only a few

that she’s met.
A larger student body and

the beginning of coed enroll-
ment has wrought changes.
‘‘The boys are younger than
then, more interested in the
College than in the town. I just
don’t know them anymore,” she
says. The big, old house is a lot
quieter than when music echoed
through it and there was danc-
ing in the living room. “I’ve
never lived in Davidson since I
came back,”’ she told me, ‘‘you

know what I mean.”
But despite the passage of

time, there is still a yet inex-
hausted supply of life and
vitality behind Mrs. Johnston’s
clear, bright eyes. She paints
beautifully, though she’s never
had a lesson, and her artwork,
mostly landscapes, hangs in her
sitting room and around various
portraits of her family. She’s
alone now—her husband and
two daughters are dead—but
she doesn’t lack for company
from around the town, as she
always has a ready wit and is
the most knowledgeable keeper
of the town’s past. So if you
have a minute sometime, and
want to trade it for a few years
of Davidson’s past, stop in
where the two magnolias arch
over the sidewalk, just before
M&Ms. I’m sure you'll benefit
from this singularly enjoyable
historian.
