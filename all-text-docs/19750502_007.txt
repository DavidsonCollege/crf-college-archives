“Anvthine Goes’

L.ffervescent cast

By FRANCIS TOWNSEND
Staff Writer

Last night, an effervescent
cast offered a sparkling first
night performance of Cole Por-
ter’s musical comedy,
‘Anything Goes’’.

The show, first produced in
1934, relies on the traditional
theme of mistaken identity for
its comic effect. Billy Crocker
(Steve Pharr), in order to foil
the marriage of Hope Harcourt
(Jeanie Hall), an old girlfriend
and true love, with Sir Evelyn
Oakleigh (James Freed). ac-
companies the pair on a trip (on
the S.S.American) to England
where they are to be married.

Public enemy number 1

To gain admittance to the ship
he obtains a ticket and passport
from Moonface Martin (Hal
McCoy) and Bonnie (Marian
Stanley). Little does he know
that ticket and passport belong
to public enemy number 1,
Snake-eyes Johnson.

Reno Sweeny, manager of a
group of chorus girls ‘‘the
Angels”’ helps ‘“‘Snake-eyes”’ in
his scheme, and becomes at-
tracted to Sir Evelyn Oakleigh.
As the plot unravels itself,
through the machinations of
Moonface and Reno, the
marriage between Sir Evelyn
and Hope is called off. Finally,
Billy and Hope, Reno and Sir
Evelyn are marriéd as the last
scene ends.

Surprising performances

The play offers surprises both
from the veterans and the
newcomers of the Davidson
stage. As always, Patsy Ar-
nold’s acting combines moxie
with an element of

ingeniousness, although as
Reno the ingenue is well con-
cealed.

Playing the role which Ethel
Merman originated in 1934, Pat-
sy shows in songs like ‘‘Blow,

Playing one of the lead roles
along with Patsy , Steve Pharr
although newcomer to the
Davidson stage, delivers a
skillfully resolved performance
as Billy Crocker.

In songs such as ‘“‘All Through
the Night’’, sung with Jeannie
Hall, Pharr shows himself to be
a fine singer as well as actor. In
both songs he exhibits an unan-
ticipatedly high degree of ef-
fortless control.

Two other surprises in the
show are Jim Freed and Marian
Stanley who excel as character
types in the play--as the naive
Englishman. Sir Evelyn

considerable ability as a dancer
in a number such as ‘‘Heaven

Hal McCoy who plays op-
posite her as Moonface delivers
his traditionally superbly timed
and angular performance, and
gives an equally well-done ren-
dition of ‘‘Be like the Bluebird.”’

Great scenes

. Asa whole the musical comes
off smoothly. Jim Freed and
Joseph Gardner’s versatile set
account for a lot of the
smoothness as well as Linda
Mallonee and Nancy Gar-
dener’s choreography and
staging of the musical scenes.
However at times” there
seemed to be difficulties: with
the numbers sung by the whole
chorus, which was often hardly
heard above the already

’pianissimo orchestra, or just

downright unintelligible. This is
the major fault which should be
corrected.

In some respects the success
of the musical was surprising,
while in other areas, it was an-
ticipated. Many observers have
long held that director Rupert
Barber’s talent lies in his ability
to deal effectively with the
larger units of dramatic func-
tion, primarily the scene.

Dr. Barber especially has the
capacity to abstract from a
scene its value and meaning as
a self-contained unit. Thus he
often uses visual, kinetic, and
other principles and scenes
within its own limits.

A musical success

This technique can be un-
fortunate since it sometimes
tends to observe nuances of
detail, and to fragment the
overall structure of a play.

Yet in musical comedy where
the plot structure is episodic,
and a sense of the spectacular is

. demanded, Dr. Barber’s special

qualities as director are ideal.
In ‘Anything Goes’ this is
evident.

The musical is a glittering
array of brilliantly performed

‘scenes punctuated by show-

stopping production numbers.

Yet as hinted above. for other .

reasons the show’s_ success
came as.a surprise. Because of
several considerations, the
musical may be one of the har-
dest theatrical genres.

Virtually all the performers
must be able to sing and dance
as well as act. and generally
need to be acrobatic.as well. In
a school as small as Davidson
where a student production has
such limited resources, it is

amazing that talent and en-
thusiasm was found in the
necessary amounts to» make
the production of ‘Anything
Goes’”’ possible.

For this reason alone, the
dedication and determination of
all involved should be ap-
plauded.

In addition, it came to the at-
tention of this critic that the
show was produced ‘entirely
through the resources of the
Drama department. In other
words, whether because of lack
of invitation, or lack of
willingness, no department
musical assistance was in-
volved. For whatever reason,
this is a sad thing in a show
which is essentially made of 36
singers and eleven __ in-
strumental musicians.

Cooperation

Weré it not for the kind
assistance of Mr. Michael Pit-
tard, choral director at North
Mecklenburg High School, the
show would evidently have been
without a director.

At any rate, in a college com-
munity as small as Davidson,
any ambitious artistic effort
cannot merely be for the com-
munity, but it must be the com-
munity. So, when the Drama
department undertakes to
produce a large scale musical
comedy, it seems to me. that no
one in any camp should object
to the Music department of-
fering some needed manpower.

If the chorus and wind en-
semble set aside Handel and
Mozart for a month or two in or-

‘der to indulge in a little Cole

Porter no harm could come of
it, and the experience could be
