the words with which “Amo” heralded
the arrival of the Quips and Cranks
photographer last Monday morning.

The following morning found quite
a number of three-inch collars, stiff as
a board, with a powdered face peeping
over each one waiting to get his beauty

‘Tuesday and Wednesday were con-
sumed taking the individual pietures and
the groups followed on ‘Thursday.

‘The photographs are always one of
the principal parts of the Annual. Uf
they are good, the Annual is usually at-
tractive. So this year the management
spared no expense in getting a good
photographer. Mr. Shuford. of Gas-
tonia, was the one secured, and his care
in making the exposures foretell — the
quality of the pictures. -

“Amo” is still in need of contribu.
tions of all kinds and urges everyone
who can do anything along this line to
get busy.

Dr. Myers, of Greensboro, has con-
sented to hold a series of meetings on the
Hill under the auspices of the Y. M. C.
A., giving as his preferable dates the
2yth, 25th and 26th. Mr. Miles has
writen him that these dates will be
satisfactory. Although he has not  re-
ceived a reply from Dr. Myers as yet,
it is more than probable that he will be
on the Hill on these days.

Dr. Myers is avery forceful speaker
who has something to say and says. it.
Those who have heard him will not
miss hearing him. and those who have
not should not miss hearing him. He
will bring with him a quartette compos-
ed of two ladies and two gentlemen.
Those who have heard the quartette can
testify that it will be an additional in-
fluence for the success of the meeting.

BIBLE CLASSES.

The attendance at the morning Bible
classes last, Sunday registered 125  fel-
lows, this number being divided as fol-
lows: North Wing Chambers, rs;
South Wing Chambers, 27; Georgia.
22: Watts, 28, and Rumple 36. While
Chambers led in numbers, yet. Rumple
had the best average as she had 36 men
present out of a possible 50.

This morning Bible class is not a new
thing at Davidson by any means, but it
has received a new impetus under the
leadership of Mr. Miles, who has select-
ed a competent corfs of teachers for this
work. ‘The teachers are willing to give
their time in preparing the lesson, so
why cannot the rest of us do the same?
Let's make it a point to come next Sun-
day prepared to enter fully into the dis-
cussion of these questions which are vital
to our everyday life. What about it,
fellows? Can't we do this much?
