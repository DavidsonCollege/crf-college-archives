Western creditors forced Polish price increases — ‘Solidarity’ is the outcome

Question: ‘What is proletarian
internationalism?”

Answer: “That’s when there is
no meat in Moscow—and
stikes break out in Poland.”’

But proletarian international-
ism can also loom ominously
when Poland’s ‘‘fraternal’’ So-
viet neighbor has assembled 26
divisions on the border. In the
much publicized and often con-
fusing situation today in Po-
land, however the subject of
meat shortages connotes two
aspects of the Polish crisis
which underlie the more well-
known accounts of Solidarity
strikes, government upheavals,
and patriotic fervor.

A rumor circulating in Poland
alleges that some railroad work-
ers in Lublin initiated the
earliest strikes of the summer
1980 when they happened upon
some damaged gallon cans of
paint in boxcars headed for the
Soviet Union, and found them
to contain not paint but canned
ham. Meat shortages have long
been a problem in Poland, but
in 1980 the situation became
critical when the regime simul-
taneously raised meat prices
with announcements of further
rationing. When Poles could
find meat at all, it usually
meant a two-to four-hour wait
in lins of disgruntled shoppers.

The railway workers’ re-
sponse was symbolic of the
Poles’ increasing reluctance to
continue to live ‘‘on two levels’,
a time-honored pattern typical
of Eastern Europe. As a Wes-
tern scholar who recently vi-
sited Poland notes, ‘‘There is
the official level, the ‘party
line’, the level which has go-
vernment sanction and appro-
val; and then there is the
private level, a kind of semi-
underground wherein’ the
‘truths’ of the official level are
derided with thinly-veiled, often
bitter cynicism.” Nobel laureate
poet Czeslaw Milosz has com-
pared this phenomenon to the
Islamic concept ‘‘Ketman’’, af-
ter the belief that deception of
one’s adversaries about what
one truly believes is essential to
survive. Poles have long prac-

The grade school class re-
sponded eagerly to the query
about what had happened to the
school cat. The teacher picked
out one young girl:

’ “Our cat had kittens and
they're all good communists.”

The teacher was pleased. The
following week, the little girl
raised her hand again.

“Our kittens are no longer
communists.”

“Why?"’ asked the puzzled
teacher.

' “Because they've opened
their eyes.”

The onrush of events this
past year may be viewed as a
floodtide of the disaffection and
pent-up frustration of the daily
realities of life (the private level)
spilling over the barriers of
party and government, but also
as the expression of the inner

Polish desire no longer to play

the dupe in charade socialism.
Polish workers and their or-
ganizers have challenged the
“official” explanation and go-
vernmental posturing. thus, the
strikes have emerged not mere-
ly as the realization of workers’
power, and as a forceful bar-
gaining tool in dealing with the
dual-reality lifestyle of Eastern
Europe on three fronts. Econo-
mically, the Poles have raised
the banner of true Marxist
principles—the right to strike,
the right to freely elected trade
unions, and an end to press
censorship—directly alongside

the caricatured Marxism pro-
moted by the Polish communist
party and its Soviet mentors.
They have consequently struck
at the all too apparent short-

comings of Soviet-style plan- |

ning and decided instead to
pursue their own course, seem-
ingly regardless of the costs.
This is the political front. And
thirdly, the Poles are trying to
revive earlier efforts to give a
“human face’’ to socialist eco-
nomics and politics, to elimi-
nate the debilitating dissem-
blance of life on two levels.
The repercussions of meat
shortages as catalyst for the
spontaneous strikes sweeping
Poland have also focused atten-
tion on that country’s massive

indebtedness to the West. The
The current $21 billion debt

may double in the next five
years and the circumstances
threaten not only the authority
of the ruling communist party
but also the stability of Western
financial institutions and the
future of East. West relations.

Poland turned to Western
credit markets in the early
1970’s for loans to finance
consumer sector investment
and purchases of Western tech-
nology and grains in an effort to
energize a lackluster economy
with massive outside injections
of resources. Warsaw seized on
the foreign expedient as a
substitute for economic and
political reform. The Polish
debt syndrome arose when huge
debt repayments became due at
precisely the time when an
already faltering economy stag-
nated (-2% loss in GNP in 1979)
because of the lack of necessary
internal reforms. Compounding
the problem were successive
poor harvests, and Poland des-
perately turned westward for
additional hard currency quick
fixes.

By this time, Western credit
institutions were increasingly
entrapped in their own policy.
Financiers recognized that the
time had long since passed to
cut their losses and they made
efforts to continue lending in
order to protect those loans

already on the books. An old
industry adage underscores this
paradox: ‘‘Make a small loan
and you create a debtor; make a
large loan and you have created
a partner.’’ The banks have
become unwilling to force the
choice of repayment or default
on a massive debtor like Poland
even though it may have tre-
mendous difficulty even financ-
ing that debt.

But when the Western bank-

ers gathered with Polish offic-.

ials last spring, they demanded
a quid pro quo for ‘‘rolling over”’
Polish deficits. They deter-
mined that more hard curren-
cies would become availabe for
repayment if the Polish regime
tightened up its economy. Spe-
cifically, the bankers zeroed in
on the issue of the Polish food
subsidy system, whereby the
prices of basic foodstuffs like
meat and bread had been kept
artificially low since 1970 at an
annual cost to the government
of some $6 billion. A short time
later, price increases were an-

nounced by Warsaw and the
rest is history.”

Since the onset of the crisis,
Western banks predictably
have intervened on behalf of
their debtor/partner; three spe-
cial loans arranged by syndi-
cates headed by Bank of Ameri-
ca and West Germany’s Dresd-
ner Bank have barely kept the

economy afloat. Strikes have
cost the Polish economy $1.5
billion in production and pro-
bably that much more in un-
realized trade. Therefore, de-
spite the creditors’ intentions
and directives, of perhaps be-
cause of them, Poland today is
deeper then ever in debt and
less capuble of repayment thean
before. Consumer sector auster-
ity has been reversed and the
strategy of squeezing the work-
ers in order to pay back the

. West is no longer a politically

feasible option.

The spectre of Polish default
is sufficient to bring a series of
additional Western loans and
roll-overs, for the impact of
such a development could be
catastrophic for the Western
financial system. It could set off
a chain reaction of defaults by
heavily indebted Third World
states which are in worse shape
than Poland. Finally, eventual
Soviet intervention in Poland,
should it coincide with a period
of intense hostility in U.S.-So-
viet relations, might make de-
fault more than an abstract and
unlikely future.

The question of meat prices in
Poland has international impli-
cations of which we in the West
should be more aware.

Question: ‘How many Poles
does it take to pay off a
debt...?”’

peasant’s perspective

pesino Rural. Pedro irks ekes out a mea-
ger living on a piece of land high in the
mountains. He leaves every morning to
carve out a crop of potatoes from the un-
forgiving land. When he stops to rest a
minute he looks out over the fertile lands
below him which belong to el Senor
Patron, and shakes his head. Senor
Patron cultivates parts of his land to
subsidize his export-import business.
Usually, though, his business does well
and the land lies idle.

Pedro hears now and then about the

affairs of the national government. He
knows that el Senor Patron is respected
because last year the government helped
him regain land he had lost to squatters.
This puzzled Pedro since el Senor Patron
doesn’t use the land anyway, but he
didn’t interfere. Pedro remembers all too
well the last time the peasants tried to

deal with the government. It all started
when the land owner in the next valley
expanded his farm to include the land of
several peasant families. The govern-
ment backed the land owner as usual.
Tempers were aroused and many
peasants decided to take the land back.
They were tired of moving higher up the
mountains in search of land. They found
it easy to get other peasants involved
and called a general strike. Several city
people joined in shouting ideology. For
the peasants all that mattered was get-
ting their land but they welcomed any
help. Pedro vaguely remembers the city
people’s nack for organization. They
were able to arm and teach the peasants
how to work effectively against the go
vernment. Pedro also remembers the
brutal warfare that ensued. Well-
equipped government troops moved
from town to town killing anyone sus-
pected of rebellion. Pedro never quite un-
derstood the situation. He was familiar
with the country called USA because his
village had received aid from them in a
time of famine. He had been told that
this nation favored freedom, democracy,
and capitalism. Pedro had not under-
stood what this meant so one of the

. foreigners explained that they thought

each man should be able to speak as

he wished, go where he wished, vote for a

ruler, and even work at a job of his
choice. These were hard ideas for Pedro
since he knew none of them. Pedro had
liked this country — after all, they fed his
family during the famine and they
wanted men to be free—which sounded
good.

What puzzled Pedro most about this
USA was what he learned after the terri-

. ble war. He found that the national army

had been trained and armed by the USA.
How could this country that supposed-
ly supported freedom, democracy, and
capitalism also support a repressive go-
vernment that shot peasants for speak-
ing out at the loss of land, that ruled
without asking, and cared nothing about
peasants and their jobs? Pedro grew to
hate this people that gave food to keep
people alive and arms to make them suf-
fer quietly. He dared not speak out in fa-
vor of the squatters though. The mem-
ories of the war still lingered like the
stench around the corpses.

. Pedro figure he would just continue
plowing his piece of unfertile ground. He

- was safe—nobody could use his land.

But, when Pedro looked at his four boys

and two girls, he thanked God for
blessing him with helping hands. He
also wished more and more that he could
give them fertile lands from which they
could proper. Alas, he could not; they
would work his land and the land higher
up. The ldest already talked of trying
to squat on some of the unused valley
land. Pedro warned him of the deadly

-effiecient guns that protected that land,

but his son still wanted to try. The
present misery and the illusion of owning
the rich lands drew him and others to
throw themselves into the effort of ac-
quiring the land and into the path of
USA rifles.
