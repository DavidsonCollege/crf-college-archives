This article is merely an explanation. It’s
purpose is not to praise ODK. Rather it is
an attempt briefly to give an insight into
the significance and activity,of this organi-
zation on the campus. The primary motive
for ODK’s existence is not generally known.
Contrary to common belief, membership
in this fraternity is not simply the reward
of previous achievement. It is indeed the
opening of an opportunity for service. Men
who the Circle believes will welcome a
chance to continue through an organized
program the constructive work which
they have formerly undertaken with no
othér motivating influence than their own

initiative are bid to membership. By bring-
representative in all
phases of collegiate life there is created an
organization which is able to mold the sen-
timents of the institution on questions of
local intercollegiate interest. An op-
portunity is afforded by ODK, in addition,
to bring together members of the faculty
and student body on a basis of mutual un-
derstanding and helpfulness. Therefore, it
may be seen that ODK has other aims than
merely

Because its members, imbued solely with-

be reduced and the complications lessened by

using mixed vaccine.

Students who have repeated colds should

were anxious to meet me, I decided

to write you and see when it would

I was so thrilled to know that
you wanted to meet me, especially
since I understand that you are one
of the most outstanding personali-

too, the Phi Gams have always held
a warm spot in my heart since I
always go with Phi Gams when I
go to the University of Alabama.
Billy, I do hope you will call me
at 9295 or come over some Saturday
night. Let me know if you would
like for me to come down to the
