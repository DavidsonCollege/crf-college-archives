LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

JYA’s Rejected As Hall Counselors

To the Editor:

Inspirat:on to write a letter to
the sterile institution of THE
DAVIDSONIAN comes hard, Lut
narrow -m‘uded administrators
and inflexible policies that real-
ly make a difference are enough
to rouse even the more apathet-
ic consti uents of Davidson Col-
lege (a stalwart group to which
1 must confess active member-
ship.)

The question at hand involves
the ever popular Mrs. Nicholls
and the oftcu ignored policy of
hall counseling. I sincerely hope
that Mrs. Nicholls does not feel
that she has become the brunt
of undue criticism (i.e. *'dog”
article) as no one doubts the
existence of many other topics
worthy of editorial authorship.

She is, however, responsible
for the upcoming selection of
hall counselors and will make
the decisions based on policy
guidelines which detrimentally
limit the span of competent ap-
plicants.

The most notable exemption
from the application files is that
of 1ising seniors. The decision
to exclude rising seniors from

hall counselorships was made
last year after much discuss‘on
between Mrs. Nicholls and the
hall counselors themselves.

The reazoning behind the de-.
cision was based on the thoughts
of several introspective seniors
who sincerely felt that they had
aot contrikuted as much to the
freshmen as they had their jun-
ior year.

They felt that the impetus to
counsel had stagnated and that
their interests in graduate school
and other elements of senior
concern were saprping their at-
tention.

The fact that this was the
second year for these counselors
is an impoitant aspect to under-
stand at this point. Mrs. Nich-
olls and the hall counselors be-

lieve, as do I, that ‘second
year men” are not as_ enthu-
siastic as “‘first year men,”

that this group believes that
senors in general are not of
hall counseling mettle.
Certainly debate could arise
on that arbitrary bit of reasca-
ing but it is not on that point
that I wish to base my attack.

Unrelieved Tension
Blows Out Viewer

A REVIEW
By BOB WRIGHT

Faced with the more than
dismal prospect of reviewing a
film called ‘Captain Milkshake”
(‘If you liked Billy Jack, you'll
love ‘Captain Milkshake’,” if you
barely sat through Billy Jack.
the Captain will prohably make
vou puke), I opted for bagging
that and decided to write about
a film that is get:ng a lot of
talk these days, ‘Straw Dogs.”

Sam Peckinpah, a name one
hears more and more lately.
first hit the ‘“‘big time” with a
bloody, ultraviolent film called
“The Wild Bunch.”

It was pretty much Peckin-
pah’s forte, in that it was a
western, had fairly romantic
characters, and was very real-
istic as far as violence (ie.
blood and guts) was concerned.
“The Wild Buntch” was a finan-
cial success, so afterwards Sam
Peckinpah was fairly free to do
what he wanted.

What he wanted to do was to
make a non-western with big-
name stars and plenty of vio-
lence, in other words, ‘Straw
Dogs.” It is the story of David
(Dustin Hoffman), an expatri-
ate American intellectual who
has come to a small town in
Britain to get his life, his book,
and his marriage (in roughly
that order) together.

In America. David was faced
with violence and bloodshed on-
ly “between commercials.” In
his new home, his wife’s birth-
place, there seems to be no com.
mercial to break up the town’s
palpabie enmity toward him.

His wife’s cat is the first to
go, hung from a light cord in
the bedroom closet. Soon, his
wife Amy (played almost to.
perfection by Susan George) is
brutally raped by an ex-lover
while Hoffman is led on a
snipe hunt.

The rape is probably the most
psychologically violent scene co
sereca since Hitchcock's ‘‘Psy-
cho.” Del Heeney as the rapist
is superbly malicious here as he
is all through the film.

Hoffman has managed to close
his eyes to what has gone on so
far. even under his wife's less
than subtle hints that he is be
ing made a fool of.

Faced with an untenable situ-
ation, he makes a classic Amer-
ican move by choosing to ig-
nore its existence. But while
driving home from a church *‘so-
cial” he hits the town id:ot with
his car.

This act of unintentional vio
leuce begins a chilling train of
horrors for the idiot, whom
David has taken into his home
until he can contact the doctor.
is being hunted by the gang of
men from the town.

Hoffman’s efforts to keep them
out of the house and their ef-
forts to get in make up the last

twenty minutes of the film.
Twenty minutes not for the
squeamish.

By the end you'll be complete-
ly blown out, physically and
mentally. If you’re not you have
not been watching.

Dustin Hoffman is not nearly
as flashy in ‘‘Straw Dogs” as he
was in “Midnight Cowboy.” His
performance here is more on
the level of “The Graduate.”
underplayed and brilliant.

‘His last smile sent chills up
my spine, and if he can do that
without all the histricnics of
Ratso Rizzo, he’s as good as
they say he is.

But Sam Peckinpah is the
name that shouid most quickly
be linked .zwith “Straw Dogs.”
With this film he has finally
shown himself to be the great
director he could be. Watch for
his next film: if its as good as
“Straw Dogs” it will be great,
if it's better, don’t be surprised.

The influence exerted by the
‘two upperclassmen on each
freshman hall has probably the
second greatest effect on fresh-
men that can be directly attrib-
uted to Davidson.

Grades end professors have
managed to maintain the pri-
mary sanction throughout the
years. No upperclassman, and I
suppose freshmen by this date,
can deny the influence, one way
or another, that hall counselors
have had cn their attitudes.

Because | believe this to be
true, | feet that the most serious
harm is done by the exclusion
of rising seniors who happened
to have been junior year abroad.

Students who have experienc-
ed what is possibly Davidson's
finest educational experiment
are not permiited to relate their
experiences to freshmen as hall
counselors.

The reasoning behind this pol-
icy is narrow-minded, thought-
jessly restrictive, and unfortu-
nately reflects the stagnant at-
titude characteristic of the Da-
vidson power structure.

Davidson's regulating elite has
welded the already impenetrable
walls of ‘‘Davidson Standards.”
through the past two years, with
a steady supply of feudal de-
crees enforced by blindly inflex-
ible manor lords.

The question of hall counse-
lors becomes important when
one realizes how little the ad-
ministration cares about stu-
dents who are not working
along with the best laid plans
of Davidson College.

Mrs. Nicholls dismissed the
possibility of a former junior

year abroad student becoming
a hall counselor on the grounds
that said individuals would prob-
ably be occupied with making
quite an adjustment to David-
son that would probably blow
normal senior problems out of
focus.

I am not sure when Mrs. Nich-
olls last traveled to Europe nor
am I aware of the last time she
had to make an adjustment to
Davidson life but I am positive
that in the vast expanses of cos-
mopolitan Cabarrus and Meck-
lkoburg counties a traumatic
situation cropped up not three
minutes ago.

Mes. Nicholls, let us not offer
new experiences. to our fresh-
men. Instead, we should con-
tinue to chain them inside of
Davidson’s paper bag curricu-
lum led by the “Head-Fetter,”
Richard Burts.

A paper bag that you, Mrs.
Nicholls, would have a_ hard
time squeezing out of even if
you want to or the more im-
tant condition . .. if Burts would
let you.

Take hope, Mrs. Nicholis, the
deadline for applications is soon
coming up and if Burts has
taught you well, you will be
able to say that it is too late to
do anything about it with the
utmost authority.

To the Editor:

It was with some consterna-
tion that I viewed the editorial
cartoon in last week’s DAVID-
SONIAN. To refresh your mem-
ory, it pictured a pair of ne-
farious acts being committed
while Cop Linker continued to

write a parking ticket, oblivious
to these situations.

The caption fully explained
the editorial intent of the car-
toonist. It was his purpose to
continue the discussion on cam-
pus security begun on the pre-
ceding page by pointing out that
perhaps even our present inade-
quate security force could do a
better job protecting the campus
if only it did not spend its time
writing so many parking tick-
ets. In this sentiment I whole-
heartedly agree.

I take excepton, however, to
the unmistakeable tone of the
cartocn. The cartoonist places
the blame for this preoccupa-
tion directly on Linker and his
ceaseless stream of tickets, in-
stead of placing it where it be-
longs, that is, upon the innum-
erable students who continue to
earn these citations.

The opinion so expressed is
completely antithetical to that
expressed on the preceding page
by Robert Touchton in his analy-
sis of the security problem. It
was his belief, and I concur,
that the students have a respon-
sibility to aid our skeletal se-
curity force. Part of this respon-
sibility could be fulfilled by
simply avoiding traffic  cita-
tions issued for illegal parking.

Every student knows the rules
by mow. There are more than
an ample number of legal park-
ing spaces. Why, then, must
so many students continue to
occupy the security force with
such trivia, when all are agreed
that this force has such a more
important job to do?
