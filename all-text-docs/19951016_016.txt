Baseball —
a game
restored?

By Matr Pitzer
Sports Editor

When Joey Cora and Ken
Griffey, Jr. came racing around
third base and tumbled toward
home in the 1 1th inning one week
ago to give the Seattle Mariners an
improbable first-round playoff win
over the New York Yankees, base-
ball was a game restored.

When the entire Mariners
squad charged out of the dugout
for a wild and exuberant celebra-
tion in a massive pile atop home
plate, baseball was a game restored.

When Randy Johnson picked
up three wins in less than a week
and the. Mariners capturing four
win-or-go-home games, baseball
was a game restored.

It was a game restored to its
proper place as the most thrilling
of all sports and as the one that still
holds a special place in all of our
hearts.

For too long, the game has
been boycotted by a few, defended
by some, and ridiculed by many.
The most recent cause of this out-
rage, of course, was last year’s
abysmal labor struggle that can-
celed the World Series.

But the real root of the game’s
problems really goes back further.
It goes back to Vince Coleman’s
firecracker-tossing days.. It goes
back to the days when the Darryl
Strawberrys and Dwight Goodens
came into the league, had a couple
good seasons and thoughtthey were
better than the league, better than
the game itself and better than the
worldin general. Some people even
say trouble started with free agency,
which helped prompt astronomi-
cal salaries.

None of that mattered one
week ago. None of that mattered to
Joey Cora, who executed one of
baseball’s simplest plays, the bunt,
to perfection to start the winning
rally; or to Edgar Martinez, who
drove home the winning runs and
is a representative of baseball’s
growing Latino community; or to
Yankees manager Buck Showalter,
who singlehandedly blew the game
by staying with his starting pitcher
too long.

What mattered that night was
that fans across the country sat
riveted to their televisions as the
game entered the late innings and
entered extra innings. What mat-
tered that night was baseball was
being played, and being enjoyed,
the way it was always meant to be.

As Yankees pitcher David
Cone told the media late Sunday
night: “You hear the rap people put
on the modern-day player — I, I, I
and me, me, me — well, this series
was anything but that. If this doesn’t
do a lot to diminish the greedy
ballplayer image, I don’t know
what will.”

Now, if we could just watch
more games on TV ...
