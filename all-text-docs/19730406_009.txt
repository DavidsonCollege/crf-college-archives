Stone Appointed Soccer Coach,
Team Unhappy With Decision

By JIM SITTERSON
Sports Editor

The announcement of Chip
Stone as soccer coach for next
year has already sparked
dissatisfaction among team
members

The team has been without a
coach since the late Harry
Fogleman’'s resignation at the
end of last season. The major
point of dissension raised by the
players is that the = ad-
ministration has had more than
ample time to find a full-time
qualified coach.

Stone himself. is looking for-
ward to the job next year. and is
optimistic as far as the team's
future is concerned.

“In a way you could say I
volunteered for the job.”” said

Stone.

“After I talked with Dr.
Bevan and Dr. Scott about the
situation several weeks ago, I
felt that the team had to have a
coach by the end of the year.”
Stone continued.

Stone plans to work the team
harder in practice and to run
several different drills to the
practices, but he does not en-
vision any sweeping changes in
the overall soccer program.

“IT think we'll have a lot more
game type situation drills in
practice.” Stone said.

“I saw the team practice a
few times. and watched all their

games. | even reffed a few of
them. and I noticed that there
were several times when they
waited too long for the perfect
shot.” he continued

“I think this is where the
drills could help. They'd teach
the guys to make quicker
decisions,’ Stone added.

He feels that this aspect could
make a difference for the team
next year.

“With the talent we've got.
there's no reason why they
can't score from 35 to 40 yards
out."’ Stone said.

Stone added that a more
serious attitude and several
good freshmen could turn the
team into a solid contender for
the Southern Conference cham-
pionship next year.

“The administration's delay
In Nae a seccer couch for
Next fall has seriously hindered
any improvement that the team
might have made through the
recruiting of any incoming
freshmen," Tom Tornee stated.

‘From the winter term on, no
one on the team has been sure
about any aspect of the team's
future,"’ Tornee added.

Another point of contention
raised by Tornee is Stone's
availibility as a coach next fall.
Stone is currently in charge of
the physical education
program, and admitted that he
will not be able to devote his
full time to the program.

Tew Hurls 4-1 Win,
Cats Hit 6-2 Mark

By PETE WEST

This vear’s team ts just that,
a team Were playing as a
group this vear, and it makes
all the difference in the world,”
rehef pitcher Frank Folger
said

In the past we have had the
team. but not the attitude. This
year we have both.” he con-
tinued.

The team’s record. 6-2 and 1-1
in conference play would seem
to bear out Folger's
assessment

On Monday. the Wildcats split
a double-header with con-
ference rival William and
Mary. winning the first game 4-
1 behind the strong pitching of
freshman Joel Tew, and losing
the second game 3-0 on a last in-
ning Indian rally.

In the second game, Cat star-
ter Dwight Plemmons had a
two-hitter going into the last in-
ning, when the Indians rallied
for three runs to give Plem-
mons his first loss.

Whereas pitching seemed to
be a weakness of last year's
team, it seems to be a strength
this year.

The staff is lead by freshman
Joel Tew, who has compiled a 3-
0 record thus far. He has also
come up with the big hit on
several occasions.

. Plemmons is 2-1 now, and the
third starter, Joe Duncan, is
now 1-1. When the sore arms of
pitchers Ross Manire and Mar-
shall Case become well, it will
add much depth to the staff.

The detense is also much im-
proved over that in past vears.

The infield of Dave Ingold,
Gary Pomeroy. Bobby Clayton
and Lynn Wagner have already
recorded six double plays. a

little regularity in the teams of

give much credit to assistant
Pete Celentano.

“He's one of those guys that
you can't do without. He's done
a great job on the field and off.”
Weicker commented.

Weicker went on to say that if
the team continued to play as
they are now. they would have a
good shot at the conference
title, and the District II play-
offs.

‘We'll win the conference if
we keep playing our best. The
team is loose and is really at-
tacking the ball at the plate.”

team is in a good position
right now. And if the sore arms
of Manire and Case come
around, then the Cats will be in
a great position to take the con-
ference.

* “[Tve got a pretty full
schedule right now but I feel
that I'll be able to devote three
to four hours a day to the
team.”’ Stone said

Of course there will be times
when I'm caught in a bind. but I
think the team will be able to
help me out,”’ Stone added.

Tornee feels that a part-time
coach cannot do justice to the
potential of the soccer program
at Davidson. In the last three
years the team has won two
conference championships and
narrowly missed a third. while
receiving limited coaching.

The players feel that the team
deserves a full-time coach. and
that the team cold become one
of the most popular and suc-
cessful sports at Davidson if
they had a full-time coach.

“For this reason I'm
dissatisfied with the ap-
pointment of Chip Stone as soc-
cer coach.” Tornee said.

“Chip Stone would probably
make a great soccer coach if he
had the time, I really think he
would aid the program with his
knowledge of the game. and I
only wish he could devote his
full time to the soccer team.
Then we'd be all set."’ Tornee
continued.

Tornee believes that the ad-
mimstrahion’s delay in securmy
a new coach tor the team and
the hiring of a part time coach,
is a retlechon oof the ad-
