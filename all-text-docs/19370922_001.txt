Davidsonian To Use
New Headline Type

Beginning with this issue The
Davidsonian will top its stories
with entirely new and different
type from the style type used
for the past few years by its
editors.

With the co-operation of its
printers, The Standard Printing
Company of Charlotte, the paper
has made a considerable invest-
ment in type which it is hoped
will improve its general appear-
ance. Dr. Ralph Nafziger of the
National Scholastic Press Asso-
ciation, advised the change to
meet collegiate competition.
