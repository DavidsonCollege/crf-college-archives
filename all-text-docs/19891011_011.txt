The Davidsonian
Wednesday, October 11, 1989 |

As evening falls, the evening swells and tunes.

She walks, and in her path the noises reeve
and twine until they reach her song and keen
7 in low winds and the subtle rush of leaves.
In the hot night and close silences she roves
and passes; with the soft bow of the breeze
her fingers soothe the straining folk she loves
until each person resonates and sees:
someone has outpoured and spread her subtle harmonies

and delicate insistent healing in

the empty web of spaces things must form,

and shaped on the wild, tangled strands a thin
arpeggio of basso drops to frame

our tangled lives in silver, make them sane,

and roll them with the music that she weaves

into her own small ears to know the pain

she knows and heals once more, the windy caves
again, the broken silences where even music grieves.

—Doug Gibson, “90

Full Moon Risen

Glowing sphere
of vibrant orange

peeps

over black horizon.

He smiles across ve MO
the ocean waves
creating shimmers of
light.

Subdued orange glory
on which to tread.

In desperation

I search for Venus
elegantly riding her

crest of foam but

to my dismay

I do not find her.

I take comfort

instead

in the never-ceasing
rippling waves now - a
colored by

the moon’s chosen hue.
Tentatively

my toes reach to touch
the fluid chameleon and
temptation grows.

My first steps

of childhood and

my mind races with
thoughts of where I could go.
Would that I could

walk

on orange moonlight and
the vibrance and beauty
could swallow me.
Inhale deeply

the sweet salt air.

My eyes rise to meet

the moon too quickly risen.
His glorious orange

has faded.

I shiver

with a slap of reality--

I cannot tread

on moonbeams.
