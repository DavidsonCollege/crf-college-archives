Beyond Davidson: International News

By SUZANNE CRAYMER
SOVIET UNION: In Georgia, independ-
ence protests which caused the death of at
least 18 people pose the biggest threat yet to
Mikhail Gorbachev’s reforms. On Monday
troops fired into the air to break up a general
strike in the capital of Tbilisi. The strike
closed schools, mass transit and some busi-

$150,000 Pew

nesses. Along with sending Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze to quell the
unrest, the Kremlin authorized a proposal
which did several things: impose a curfew
on Tbilisi, ban all protests, close the region
to all foreigners and made clear that “anti-
Soviet” activity remains a crime.

NAMIBIA: United Nations peacekeepers

monitored the pullout of the 1,900 national-
ist guerrillas who had crossed the border
from Angola. The eight days represents the
fiercest fighting in the 23 year war. The
operation resulted in the death of 263 rebels
and 27 security force soldiers. The guerrillas
began entering South Africa on the day of
the April 1 cease fire.

FRANCE: A passenger plane crashed into
a mountain near Valence on Monday, kill-
ing all 22 people aboard. Syrian and Druse
gunners fired rockets onto Christian
beaches as a warning to two French vessels
carrying relief shipments to Lebanon. The
Syrian-backed Moslem militia refused the
French vessels to two Christian ports.

Grant aims to reduce minority attrition

By SUZANNE CRAYMER
and GIRISH GVALANI

. Davidson College is developing
amore progressive outlook toward
its minority student population
with an ambitious program in
place this year. The project will
give deserving and needy black
students a chance to fully enjoy
opportunities which would nor-
mally not be within their reach.

Over a period of three years,
Assistant Dean of Students Stone
Bynum will supervise the distribu-
tion of a $150,000 grant from the
Pew Foundation to meet the pro-
gram’s goals.

“Davidson, like most predomi-
nately white colleges, has a very
high minority attrition rate,” said
Bynum. “The school is not pre-
pared to take care of minority
needs in a totally different envi-
ronment,” he added.

The Pew Grant will attempt to
meet these needs in a four-part
plan which will aid students emo-
tionally as well as financially. ‘

A“Fund for Educational Equal-
ity” offers 20 awards each year,
averaging $1,500 each. The
awards enable students to take
advantage of Davidson extra-cur-
ricular programs.

“Davidson is a pretty wealthy
school in terms of family income,”
said Bynum. “A lot of black family
incomes are not as high. They are
not often able to attend outside
programs like other Davidson stu-
dents. Hopefully this program will
give them these advantages.”

Some of the recipients’ plans
include accepting internships

away from home, holding posi-
tions as research assistants, attend-
ing conference seminars and trav-
eling abroad. The Dana Advisory
Committee, lead by Merlyn
Schuh, selects recipients on the
basis of both need and merit.
Bynum will be accepting applica-
tions for next year in the fall.

Bynum is currently working
toward the establishment of a pro-
gram which will involve faculty
members as mentors for minority
students. In addition, he intends to
use the current system of student
tutors to help minority students
with both academic and social
problems. Throughout next year,

Bynum will encourage minority
students to become tutors for in-
coming freshmen.

Partof the grant will also be used
to establish an A.C.E.S. group
(Academic Career Enrichment for
Students). The group will provide
both academic and social support
for student coping with a new en-

vironment.

Although only the “Fund for
Educational Equality” and the
student tutoring program exist at
the present time, Bynum soon
hopes to make other programs
available to Davidson minority
students.

Greenpeace speaker keys Environmental Week

By JAY CHAUDHURI
Christopher Childs, a represen-
tative for Greenpeace, lectured on
current environmental problems
and Greenpeace activities last
Thursday as the keynote speaker
for Environmental Week.
Childs opened by saying that
human beings do not survive by
problem-solving alone. “What lies
ahead for each of us individuals
and the planet is not fixing what is
broke but focusing on what we
need and want,” he said. Current
problems of the environment
which may be remedied, accord-
ing to Childs, include the “‘green-
house effect,” industrial pollution
of the water supply and overabun-
dance of trash and pesticides.
Childs’ personal recommenda-
tion in solving this dilemma is not
necessarily becoming a Green-
peace supporter, but rather taking
resources -around ourselves and
making it work for our lives.
Childs then presented a slide
show about past Greenpeace ac-
tivities. “Greenpeace really
started when someone damaged
the planet and someone asked him
to stop,” he said.
Greenpeace was formed in 1971
by Canadian and American activ-

ists concerned about the nuclear
arms race. That year, a group of
people from British Columbia

sailed to Amchitka Island in

Alaska to protest U.S. nuclear
weapons testing. Although the
group never reached Amichitka,
said Childs, the amount of support
they received in Vancouver was

overwhelming. Eventually,
Amchitka was converted into a
bird sanctuary.

In 1983, in 1986 and 1987,
Greenpeace volunteers protested
U.S. nuclear testing in Nevada,
provoking international criticism
which eventually resulted i
postponement of tests in 1986.

Greenpeace has also addressed
the endangered status of certain
animals. As many as 40,000 to
50,000 whales were killed by 12
nations before Greenpeace inter-
vened, said Childs. With the help
of Greenpeace, the International
Whaling Commission (IWC)
adopted an indefinite moratorium
on all commercial whaling which
began in 1986. However, three
nations—Iceland, Japan and Nor-
way—still do not adhere to this
tule. :

Another endangered species
was the pe any harp seal of Canada.

oe

In the mid-1970s, approximately
200,000 baby seals were killed.
With a forced ban by the European
Economic Community (EEC) and
Greenpeace, virtually no seals are
slaughtered today, reported
Childs.

Childs also discussed Green-

peace involvement with dolphins.
in Japan, sea turtles in the Carib-

bean, wolves in Alaska and kanga-
roos in Australia. — :
Childs concluded his lecture by
discussing the toxic pollution in
the Great Lakes. This area is of
particular importance because
more than 26 million people draw
their drinking water from the
Lakes. Pollution in this area has
also threatened the Mohawk Indi-

ans of New York.

Childs began work with Green-
peace in 1987 while employed asa
technician with a commercial
environmental testing faboratory.
His previous experience includes
volunteer environmental work
with the Massachusetts Acid Rain
Monitoring Project and the chair-
manship of the Acid Rain Task
Force for the Appalachian Moun-

_ tain Club. Childs has also toured

the United States as a performer
with a one-man show on the life of
Henry David Thoreau. In his years
as a performer, he appeared in
principal roles on. PBS’ American
Playhouse and in Henry Fonda’s
last film, the Beery movie:
Summer Solstice.

program. They have displayed
class in every respect.

“Finally, I’m especially thank-
ful and grateful to allof my current
and former players, They have
always conducted themselves in a
class manner, and in my mind, that
makes them special. Their loyalty,
effort and friendship will always
be treasured, and my door is al-
ways open to them.”

The graduation rate of Hussey’s
lettermen exceeded that of. the
student body and was close to
100%. Three members of the
1988-89 freshman class were Na-
tional Merit Scholarship finalists.
Hussey also recruited and coached
the college’s first and only. Aca-
demic All-American in Derek
Rucker, who graduated in 1988.

Hussey met the press at 11 a.m.
today in Knobloch Tennis Center.
