at the ¢hap

spoke on “The Chief End of Life.”

Pritchett’s introductory words in
his morninge address

“The Chief End of Life”

The chief end of life refers, said
the speaker, to seeking the king
dom of God, not so much to the
choice of a life work, although the
two ought to be in harmony. The
Kingdom of God to Jesus meant
the rule of the will of God in the
lives of the people. To seek first
the kingdom of God means obed
ience to hi will Jesu never
swerved from doing the will of
God

God. The ing point roti
Mott’s Tite when he heard the
words, “Seekest thou great
for thyself; seck them not
Seek ve first the kingdom of God.’

The chief end of life, in the see
ond place, is the development of
Christlike charaeter. We are grad
ually learning in these days the in
portance and necessity of charac
ter. We have educated the mind
more than the heart and are reap
