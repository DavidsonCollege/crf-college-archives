Arts Festival

Last Sunday, May 1, marked the beginning
of the second annual Arts Festival on the Col-
lege campus. Probably many of
failed to take this seriously, and have therefore
failed to attend many of the interesting pro-
grams planned. Realizing that there is a de-
ficiency in the’ Fine Arts curriculum on the
campus, the faculty has afforded each student
this opportunity to acquaint himself with the
“finer things iimlife.” The faculty committee
doubtless spent a great deal of time planning
and coordinating this extensive program to have
_-something worthwhile and interesting to ‘pre-
sent to the students. I believe we can say that
they,.were very successful.

too us have

Before going into the program itself, I
would like to dwell a moment on the question
of the value of this to the students who are
preparing for example,
or other careers that are not directly connected
with Fine Arts. an understanding of
Fine Arts, though it be incomplete, is helpful
no matter what field you go into. There will
alway be opportunities to discuss music and
paintings, etc., with others. To take part in
such a conversation it is obvious that one must

ject. The Arts Festival helps a student to ac-
quire this knowledge.

As Professor Pfohl said in chapel, to ap-
preciate something we must be familiar with it.
The more we know about a subject, the more
interested we are ‘in it. The concerts by the
Male Chorus and the Band and Symphony Or-

The Concert Band, the Glee Club and the
Symphony Orchestra deserve a great vote of
thanks for the time and effort that each mem-
ber put into the Festival to make it a success.
The programs were very good and certainly
worth the effort to those who attended them.
Also, thanks to the outsiders who came in to
play with the Little Symphony.

I think Professor Pfohl is to be commended
for his bravery in attempting to” familarize the
student body with symphony in his chapel pro-
gram. “Heartily” received by all, the program
aroused an interest in this
type of music.

Many of us were surprised to learn that
there are so many artists among us, this fact
coming to light in the number of paintings,

chosen for next year,

The naming of Jim ‘‘Slick”” Evans as treas-
urer.of the group, was a very appropriate move.
As Bill himself expressed it, one could hardly
leave out a man who polled so many votes.
Evans was runner-up to Alexander in the re-
cent election and had led the field until the
final-ballot. The election was certainly the most
spirited for any office in recent years and
showed that a large segment of the student
body was interested in some change in the
“Y?" setup. These it would appear,
sought representatives of the non-religious
emphasis rather than the pre-ministerial stu-
dents. It is argued that a good number of the
votes were in the nature of a joke, but joke

voters,

Alexander has recognized this voice and, has
taken steps already toward heeding it.. The ap-
pointment of Evans was one. A second is the
effort to move the “Y” to the old gym. Former
editor Mac Hart editotialized on that point
several weeks ago and it seems that
plan might be worked out.

The plan to make the gym into a student
union building. appears to, be a feasible one.
The only drawing which the present “Y" has
for the average student is one ping pong table
in a room not large enough for a game of tiddly
wink and one pool table which should have
been scrapped years ago. I know nothitig of
the financial status of YMCA, but there prob-
bably is some allowance for student recreation.
However, whether the “Y’’ has the’ money for
such in.its budget or not should be of little
concern. Two or three pool tables in a student
union building such as the old gym could: pay
for themselves in a short time.

Strong student support of this plan is what
is needed to put it over. Alexander reports
that Dr. Cunningham is behind it and that if
something can be worked-out, it will be, ‘Iiat
there is a need is evident. The YMC A used to
be the center of student activity, but it no
longer holds that destination. The proposed
change would place it back in that spot. Stu-
dent backing is what is needed and it should be
shown,

Congratulations again to Bill Alexander for

to place the “Y’’ back at the top as a student

center.

Political Angles

SPAIN’S NOT IN THE NEWS

By HENRY HANSEN

Often news is found not in what
some nation has done, but in what
it has not done. The sins of co-
mission which a nation may com-
mit quite often have more imme-
diate effects than the sins of omis-
sion. But the sins of omission can
be quite as devastating in their ef-
fects in spite of the longer time
they make take to become ap-
parent.

The United States at the present
time is investing billions in Europe
in the hope of winning certain na-
tions to democracy and, incidental:
ly, to a position which, in the event
of war with Russia, would find
them allied with us against the red
menace. It is not the purpose of
this article to question the wisdom
this policy even though it
oint out that our rela-

cumb to the violent wooings of our
rival suitor and run off with all our
gifts in the bargain. There is one
nation, however, which could be
"at much less cost than some
of the European nations we have
wot and are winning at such a
tremendous outplay of cash and
material. This nation is Spain. Now
it is true that Spain is a fascist
country. There is little, if any, hope
of our converting her to a democ-
racy. But there is little, if any,
for doing so. It is quite
possible to have Spain on our side
of the fence, without converting her
to“our form of government and she
be

“ours

reason

can infinitely useful to us
without renouncing her present
form of government. Therefore,

why should we continue to roll our
diplomatic eyes at the spectre of
fascism and shy violently .away
from the friendly overtures which
have been tendered us by Spain.
All of the eastern hemisphere, in-
cluding Spain will probably have to
ally itself, eventually, either with
the group of nations headed by
Russia or with the forces marshalled
by the United States. What point

NOW

is there in rejecting the inestimable
help Spain can give us in any armed
conflict which may develop between
ourselves and Russia merely be-
cause she happens to have a fascist
government? The answer, in view
of what Spain could mean to us,
is that there isn’t any point at all
in continuing to pursue our pres-
ent ridiculous and egregiously stupid
policy toward , Spain.

Now just what can Spain mean
to us? Consult any atlas and it
will immediately be apparent that
Spain can supply us with excellent
land and sea bases. Our air forces,
land based in Spain could fan out
over all of Europe and a great
part of Russia itself. Our sea force,
based in Spain could control all of
the Northern Atlantic and the wa-
ters around the hot spots of India
and China as Well. Spain would not
be an ideal base in. every way for
such air and sea operations, but, in
the event that Britain would go
down in any future conflict, she
would be of great help to whatever
nation whom she chose to favor.

And to divorce any future policy
of friendliness with Spain ° from
ulterior motives, there is no reason
actually, including her ‘fascist gov-
ernment, why we should sot be
just good friends with Spain. Her
form of government is no threat
to us for Spain is a small country,
no gigantic nation with gigantic in-
fluence as is Russia, But her af-
filiations can be of great importance
to us in any future conflict.

Let's not see Spain lost to Rus-
sia because we refuse to actépt her
in the fascist state. If we're a true
democracy, We can accept Spain's
friendship and her help in the form
of vital bases without worrying
about her form of government.

If Spain enters the news as she
almost certainly will since Russia
herself could use bases there to
play havoc with our own North
African bases, let’s have her on our
side; let's make friends with Spain
and secure some inestimably valua-
ble bases for our sea and air power

in the process.

College Rags In Brief

By ART JENKINS

When we speak of drunken
drivers we usually niean automo.
bile drivers. But a couple of stu-
dents at the University of Georgia
have expanded the term to include
tank drivers and they can testify
that one can get into just as much
trouble whether you are driving a
tank or an automobile. The other
day these two excitement hungry
students stole a tank from the
ROTC armory for a little ride in
the country, Frantic residents tele-
phoned the police that a light tank
was running wild over dirt roads
near the city limits. Police in three
unarmored prowl cars set out man-
fully to intercept the tank spear-
head. They blocked all roads and
climbed out. to surround the tank
on foot. The tank crew tried to
escapé through a wheat field but
a steep creek bank proved too
much for the 20-ton vehicle and
it toppled over. The youths jumped
out just before it caught fire.

The MERCER CLUSTER takes
an optimistic outlook on the fact
that there are so many ugly women
in this world by printing an article
on the advantages of ugly women.
According to this article, “a woman
without beauty is like a man with-

‘}out money; she just has a little

harder time getting there than
other people. One doesn’t have to
worry about making enemies when
describing ugly women, This is
largely because no woman has ever
really believed, that she was ugly.
Each one seems to think that it
was all other-.women that God
refused to bless What little

sincerity the human race still re-
tains largely centered around
non-beautiful women. When men
extend courtesies to these women,
the action comes from the heart.
But in dealing with beautiful peo-
ple, you have just got to be more
flagrant than the next guy, else
you lose out . How many
thoroughly ugly women does one

is

| find in those dens of iniquity, the

country clubs and the dance halls -
of the country? Very,’ very few.
Therefore, it must be reasonable to
assume that ugly ladies are likely
to be moral ladies, And who wants
to be beautiful when they can be
good?” unquote.

Everybody knows that pollsters
are all wet, but here are the re-
sults of a poll taken among coeds
of fifteen schools over the country
and published in the U. of Mary-
land’s DIAMONDBACK., The
girls were asked to list the at-
tributes they prefer in prospective
mates. First on the list was in-
telligence. Women still want to be
mastered,, contrary to the opinion
of most men. Equal rights are fine,
but they want a husband they can
respect, and even obey. Other
necessary tributes that were listed
were patience, understanding,
tolerance, poise, self-confidence,
sense of humor, and high moral
standards. The ideal spouse is a
Paragon-type character: _ lover,
breadwinner,’ playmate, companion,
scullery maid, doting parent, public
accountant (to keep the budget
straight), boss, and all-in-one at-
tractive package.
