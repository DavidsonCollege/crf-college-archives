Should CheerBot 5000s be allowed to perform
at football games?

Dr. Zeigfreid Pollywhipplestein,
Cold Fusion Department

CheerBot 5000s are a disgrace, plain and
simple. They have no place on the synthetic
iiber-field, and certainly not at such whole-
some events as Davidson Homecoming. I
have been teaching here for 260 years, and I
have never seen such blatant objectifying of
robot women.

It is disgraceful. The skirts are so short
you can practically see their circuitry, and I
don’t much care to see their wiring jiggle
around as they space dance. We should have
cut the blue wire years ago.

I remember when it was wholesome space
women and cyborgs cheerleading, filled with
nothing but school spirit and and Energizer
batteries. The CheerBots out there these
days are all liquored up on synthetic motor
oil and washer fluid, and that is the kind of
licentious behavior that can seriously dam-
age the Davidson reputation.

I am all for diversity, but not when it
involves robot sex in dance form. The entire
football game, I heard catcalls like “show me
your ohms!” and “I'd like to close your series
circuit!”—utterly disgraceful. All I want to
do is eat a corn dog with my grandson and

cheer on our squad. I don’t want to see
drunk FratBots grabbing their magnets and
shouting obscenities. :

I’ve never seen-such objectification of
robots, and it does nothing but perpetuate a
culture that degrades Direct Current beings
and gives Alternating Current free reign.
Davidson needs to seriously reconsider their
image, priorities, and obligations to the
greater community.

JEB WITTINGTON

This weekend was the first time I visited
our fine campus since I graduated in 1923.
The most prominent change that I noticed
around here is the addition of many new
parking lots for automobiles. You young-
sters might be thinking, “Hold your britches,
sir, what about the females we have here
now?” Well I’d say to you that we had plen-
ty of women-folk back in the good old days,
too. We were what you might now-a-days
call “players”.

No, it’s those new paved squares in which.

to park our automobiles that really gets me
excited. It’s like I always said ‘back then, we
have some of the richest folk around learnin’
here, and we need to be able:to drive our
expensive new automobiles to school.

It has made moving in far easier since y’all
don’t have to have your blasted parents

drive you up or carry your clothing in a sack
all the way from Cornelius or Mooresville.
The addition of a space to park automobiles
even attracted some of the leading scholars
from Charlotte itself!

Heck, it was like I said back in ’22, “It’s
almost imperative-that we got a parking lot
for our automobiles if we ever fancy on
becoming a competitive educational institu-
tion.”

Another thing, and I think everyone will
agree with me on this one, is that the town of
Davidson is not very stimulating for the rip-
roaring young man these days, as it wasn’t
back in those. You can only take so many
dates to the Soda Shop and Gnome Store
before it gets old. We needed to be able to
pilot our personal automobiles to exotic
places like Huntersville, where I hear they
just opened up a Waffle House breakfast-
style eatery.

Some of the faculty back then alsv
requested a designated automobile parking
area. The English professor, Dr. Hanson,
owned a Ford automobile, and two of our
other six professors were considering pur-
chasing a machine. Today, in one of them
rectangles, I even saw one of those Japanese
automobiles.

Back in ’23, the grassy field just off of
Main Street was the perfect place to park an
automobile and it even had soft grass for
kneeling while cranking up the engine. The
campus police officer, however, disallowed
the parking of automobiles there. He
claimed that area is for pitching footballs
and picnics with gals.

There were plenty of open grassy fields for
playing pick-up sports and other outside
horseplay on this campus though! And boy
doggity did history prove him wrong. I can’t
get around too well anymore, but I’m sure
there are still plenty of open grassy fields on
this campus for doing long division and
playing sports.

The chi was flowing splendidly at
Homecoming this past weekend at
Davidson. I was reminded of my days as an
undergraduate; watching football games in
the fall, exchanging pleasantries with

by counties in order to assemble the Great
Wall of Davidson. After a full year of work
moving bricks, however, Emperor Chang
abandoned the Great Wall plans and we
used the bricks to lay a number of stylish
walkways. The Wofford Mongols wreaked
havoc on the college nearly every weekend,
but those sidewalks really looked smart.

I will admit, our football team was a little
better back then. Only it wasn’t so much a
football team, as much as it was a trained
group of horse-riding swordsmen. We
would play other colleges whenever there
was a territorial dispute to be settled.
Decked out in our finest armor, with
Wildcats’ flags waving, we would demolish
nearby universities and claim their facilities
as our own. Survivors were beheaded.

Back then, Davidson College spanned
over most of North Carolina and even a fair
amount into South Carolina. Our domina-
tion was well known across the land, and our
swordsmen the finest trained. Things began
to deteriorate when the better warriors
started to attend state universities instead of
Davidson, because we could not offer as
many scholarships and demanded more
from student warriors academically.

loved meeting all of the young, ambitious
Davidson students. They seemed a lot hap-
pier than I remember my classmates and
myself being. Of course, we had to deal with
all of the intruding Wofford Mongols.

Church has replaced the college’s former ties
with The Temple of the God of Wind, but
school concerts are still disappointing and
poorly attended. Students today may have

But we do have something in common.
