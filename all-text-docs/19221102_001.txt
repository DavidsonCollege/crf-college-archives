“Y” SECRETARY. ADDRESSES
SUNDAY VESPER GATHERING

Buck Currie Speaks on Out-
standing Sins in College Life
By 4. Y. BOWIE

A message that sunk deep into the
hearts of his hearers was delivered by
Buck Currie, “Y” secretary, at the
vesper service held in Shearer Hall
Sunday evening.

Frank Johnson of the Y. M. C. A.
Cabinet, presided, while Bill Baker led
the singing. Kretchman played the
piano, and Thompson accompanied on
a cornet. White and Bradley led in
prayer after which Buck Currie took
charge of the meeting. “Outstanding
Sins” was the subject of his address.

“Besides the unpardonable — sin,
blasphemy of the Holy Ghost,” said
the speaker, “there are four outstand-
ing sins in the life of man. ‘These are
envy, love of money, slander and ser-
vility.” Scripture was quoted in ref-
erence to each of these sins.

“Christ’s coming found the world at
its lowest ebb, because the priests, who
were supposed to be the spiritual
leaders of the people, had defiled their
offices, and had dragged down the
church from its rightful place.

“Tt was at this time that the greatest
event of the world took place ; the Real
Priest came into the world, the Priest
who offered the true religion to rich
and poor alike. ‘The priests opposed
Christ because He was offering free
what they had been accustomed to look
to as a trade. When we let competi-
tion give way to selfishness we are in

SHAKESPEARIAN PLAY 10 BE
GIVEN BY DEVEREUX ACTORS

Romeo and Juliet to Be Pre-
sented on November 4th

The leading artists of Romeo and
Juliet, to be presented by the Clifford
Devereux Company, in Shearer Hall
November 4th will be Miss Zinita
Graf and Mr. Clifford Devereux.

Miss Zinta Graf for the past five
years has been the leading lady with
Mr. Devereux and-his company. She
possesses a wealth of those natural
gifts which are essential to the suc-
cess of an actress. She is endowed
with a winsome personality, a cap-
tivating stage appearance, a voice that
is musical, and a beauty of counte-
nance that is rare. In her actions she
is brilliant and distinctive; her man-
ner is scintillating and _ radiates
through the audience.

Mr. Clifford Devereux, who plays
the part of Romeo, is an actor of par
excellence. His voice has proved a
great asset in his theatrical career and
the same radiant personality, sym-
pathetic appeal, and dramatic sensi-
tiveness which once found expression
in song, are the qualities which have
established his reputation as an actor
of distinction and power.

During his college days Mr.
Devereux was a star of the football
squad. Instead of being the hero of
the squad he now plays the leading
role in each drama presented by the
repertoire company which bears his
name. That smile which characterized
him in those days of sport has lost
none ofits fascination.

EVANGELISTIC SERVICES
LED BY DOCTOR LINGLE

The evangelistic services to be con-
ducted by Dr. Walter Lingle com-
menced Wednesday night at 7:30 in
Shearer Hall.

Doctor Lingle is a graduate of Da-
vidson College and is one of her most
distinguished alumni, He is one of
the greatest preachers in the Southern
Presbyterian Church, and is at present
instructor at the Union Theological
Seminary at Richmond, Virginia. He
is loved by all that know him and it is
a certainty that he will leave many new
friends at Davidson.

Mr. Carr, an alumni, of Davidson,
is in charge of the singing. He has
had much experience in work of this
kind and it is certain that the services
along this line will be quite a success.

WILDCATS WILL ATTEMPT T0
UPSET DOPE IN STATE GAME

Defeat Administered by Trinity
Will Serve to Arouse the
Wildcat Fighting Spirit

With the State-Davidson game
taking place on this Saturday, fans are
beginning to wonder how the Wildcats
and Statesmen will come out. Ac-
cording to Davidson’s usual mode of
playing she ought to win, or at least
tie the score, for the Wildcats realize
that this is one of the games that calls
for the true Davidson type of fight.
After holding the mighty V. P. I. ag-
gregation to a 7-7 tie, then relaxing in
the Trinity game, the felines will be in
the best of spirits to go and get ’em
when they meet State.

From ’way back yonder, the Wild-
cats have been recognized dope-upset-
ters. Many a prophecy has failed to
come true as to the outcome of games
in which Davidson has been engaged.
With the public prepared to hear of a
defeat of about 70 to 0 on Grant
Field, they came back with a virtual
victory; when it was considered easy
money to spot V. P. I. two touch-
downs, the “thin Red line” put a de-
cided sag in the Gobblers’ strut. The
coming battle with the Statesmen will
probably be a battle of wits and dip-
lomacy combined with fight, for Da-
vidson, after holding State to a 3-3 tie
last year, will present a smashing of-
fense. In the past big games of the
season, with one exception, Davidson
has put the most emphasis onthe de-
fense, [ee

According to figures the dope runs
as follows: Carolina defeated State
by five points; Carolina defeated
Trinity by 12 points; Trinity defeated
Davidson by 12 points. This gives
Carolina the odds by 23 points. State
lost to Carolina by only five points,
giving State the odds over Davidson by
28 points. Figuring another way State
has the odds by 54 pojnts. Carolina
defeated Wake Forest 62-3, and Wake
Foret and Davidson tied. This gives
Carolina 59 points. Carolina defeated
State by only five points, giving State
54 points odds. ~

According to direct scores, in past
years, the relation is hard to deter-
mine. Since 1899 the victor and van-
quished have been continually chang-
ing. The exact weights of the State
team could not be gathered, but they
are a good bit heavier than the Red
and Black.

On Saturday the’ Davidson Fresh-
men play: Oak Ridge Institute on
Sprunt Field. The Freshmen have

games they have played, the last espe-
cially, but intend to turn in a victory

coached by John Schenck, one of the
best men on Davidson’s last year’s var-
sity. He has made a scrappy aggrega-
tion out of the “Ridgers’” and, al-
though they have had hard luck in
playing some of the leading high
schools in the State, they are deter-
mined to give the Freshmen the battle
of their lives.

Collegiate short’ stories for the year
*22-’23, a suitable prize to be awarded
the best of the accepted stories. In
view of the fact that there has been an
unusual amount of discussion concern-
ing the lack of writing in the State of
North Carolina, the delegates regard
this action as a timely and beneficial
one,

‘delegates representing the publications

of Meredith College, North Carolina
College for Women, Greensboro Col-
lege for Women, University of North
Carolina, North Carolina State Col-
lege, Queens College, Guilford Col-

DAVIOSONIANS BOW BEFORE
TRINITY'S BATTERING RAM

Usual Fighting Spirit of the
Wildcats Is Sadly Lacking

“By BILL MAUZE

“Wait until we get you in Char-
lotte.” Such were the parting words
of Davidson and Trinity teams in
Greensboro last Saturday night. The
Methodists came and went with every
bit of the bacon, not even leaving the
grease behind -for the Wildcats to
enjoy. The game was the first between
the two institutions on the gridiron,
and marks the highest point that the
Blue and White of Trinity has ever
reached,

The lads from Durham had a
smooth running team that clearly out-
played the Wildcats. The big surprise
of the day was the easy manner in
which Trinity gained through the Da-
vidson line, Their offense was directed
almost entirely against the line, and
they seemed able to reel off five yards
most any time.

The Wildcats were playing far
below the standard set by them in the
V. 1. I. game, The old-time spirit
and fight was lacking—sadly lacking.
Their playing may best be described
by the word “listless.” No one who
saw them fight V. P. 1. and Georgia
Tech to a standstill doubts~ their
superiority over ‘Trinity, but they
failed to show it at Cone Park.

The setting for the game was ideal.
The day was balmy but not hot, the sky
was clear as a mountain stream, and
the field was firm—as a brick, ‘The
Trinity student body was on hand full
force with their band. But the best
cheering of-all-came fronr the G. C,
W. girls who supported Trinity. A
crowd of 4,000 witnessed the game.

The Methodists had the best of the
argument in the first quarter and by
consistent line plunging they carried
the pigskin to the five-yard line before
the quarter ended. On the third play
of the second quarter they carried the
ball over. The remainder of the
quarter was featured by Brice’s work
in blocking a punt and recovering it
only to fumble the pigskin on Trinity's
20-yard line.

In the third quarter the Wildcats
came nearest scoring. Line plays and
a long gain on a pass to Faison put the
ball on the one-yard line with third
down as the quarter ended. But
Trinity held firm after a brief rest,
punted out of danger, intercepted: a
pass and scored their second touch-
down with but 30 seconds left. Hen-
drix took the next kick-off and 1nade
