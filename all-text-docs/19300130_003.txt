Side Line Shots
At the Wildcats on the Court
and Mat
By P. R. Alderman

With about two weeks rest behind
them the Wildcats are on the warpath
again. Only a month left to go but there’s
plenty to be done in that time.

Barring the losses to Furman, which
was due largely to Carl Pritchett’s injury,
and to Charlotte “Y” the season so far has
been perfect for the Cats. They've downed
some mighty good quintets too.

It’s going to be a close race between the
Fresh and Varsity to see which can come
through the sason with the least num-
ber of losses. Both are beginning to find
themselves as teams and tliat’s what
counts,

The V. M. I. matmen didn’t find Tex
Tilson’s men any too easy last Saturday,
in spite of the fact that three of the
Wildcats’ best bets were out. The score
doesn’t tell the whole tale by any means.

Alex Warren and “Pie” Conway furnished
most of the thrills against the Cadets.
They were fighting against odds, especial-
ly Conway, but came through on top in
spite of it.

Captain Johnston and his men won't be
seen in action as much as we would like.
The trip through Virginia next week and
the State trip the latter part of the month
will include most of the major games.

Judging from the records of Virginia
quintets so far this year, the Kitten and
Varsity squads are going to have about
all they can handle next week.

The odds never are hopelessly against
any Davidson team, however, as has been
proven time and time again. Unfavorable
odds call for fight and the Wildcats prac-
tically thrive on that.

With intramural contests getting into
swing, there’s enough in the realm of
athletics going on to’ give everybody a
chance to make up for any lost exercise
so far.

Surely looks good to see the gridders
don their uniforms again even if there
won’t be any games to look forward to.
Next year should be one of the best in
Wildcat history, barring unforeseen mis-
haps.

Pritchett and Johnston are giving each
other plenty of competition for high-
scoring honors. This race should get bet-
ter as the season goes on.

The varsity took a big step toward re-
venge against Carolina for the licking in
football last fall by their cage victory
over them. Wake Forest is the next in
order to be reckoned with.

The Wildkittens also have some old
scores to settle for grid defeats—espe-
cially against Duke and State first year
men. If they keep on like they’ve started
they’re pretty apt to accomplish these
tasks.

The Wildcats need and appreciate
wholehearted backing during the basket-
ball season as well as on the gridiron. We
can’t stress this too much and it’s our
duty to fight along with those in the
battle.

Dean—My boy, do you drink?

Stude—No, sir.

Dean—How unfortunate. My brother in
Scotland sent me two cases of Scotch and
since I don’t drink, I am trying to dispose
of it.

Charlotte ‘Y’ Team
Conquers ’Cat Five

A desperate rally in the waning minutes
of the game fell one point short and the
Davidson College basketball five went down
to defeat before the Charlotte “Y’ Monday
night at the Central High Gym, 39 to 38.
The final whistle sounded just as Johnson,
Wildcat Captain, was about to take a couple
of shots for a foul inflicted on him. Although
he made good with both tosses, his last failed
to knot the count by a single point.

The “Y” started off with a rush and for a
time it seemed as if the ’Cats would be en-
tirely played off their feet. However, near
the close of the first half, the defense of the
Charlotte Club faltered, and the Wildcats
left the floor leading by one point. The count
then being 17-16. Again in the second half,
the “Y" led by Henderson, McCachren, and
Craver, outdistanced the Wildcats, and the
closing rally of the Davidson quintet fell
just one point short of knotting the score.

Wildcats To Battle
N. C. State Matmen

First Big Five Meet of Year for
Davidson

The Davidson wrestling team journey to
Raleigh this week-end for a meet with North
Carolina State Saturday evening. This will
be the first encounter of the season with a
Big Five team for the Wildcats, although it
is the third match for the year.

The ’Cat exponents of the cauliflower sport
have made a very creditable showing against
opponents so far, having a match with Con-
cord Y. M. C. A. showing on the win col-
umn, and one with Virginia Military Insti-
tute appearing on the loss side. An usually
good showing was made against the latter
team, considering the fact that the ’Cats
were weakened by injuries. The work of
Conway in the unlimited class was especially
outstanding. Although outweighed 35 pounds,
Conway handled the cadet entry in fine style.
He is certain to give any man in his weight
a very interesting evening.

Captain Christenbury, Marrow, and Frank
Brown were held out of the match last Sat-
urday on account of injuries, and if they are
able to wrestle this week, the team will be
greatly strengthened. No definite announce-
ment of the men who will make the trip has
been made as yet, but in all probability the
list will include Cowan, Gorham, Russell,
Brown, Brohard, Conway, Captain Chris-
tenbury, Covington, Warren, and Marrow.

“How do you make that out?” he purred.

“A rasping voice such as yours would make life a living
hell,” she answered him. “Unbind me, change to
OLD GOLDS and maybe Ill listen to reason.”
