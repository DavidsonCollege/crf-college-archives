weeks). Articles in Time andeven Rolling Stone have come forth to sing
country music’s praises. If you didn’t believe me all year, if you still
think that country music does nothing for anybody with musical taste, .
..well, you’re sortofaclosed-minded boob, but you're still quite entitled
to your own opinion (just kidding). Pop or not pop, the true country fans

will always be there.

I wantto thank Walter Price, David Thompson, and Jim Carswell for
letting mé have this large space with which to enthrall you each week;
I also wanted you to know who you could go kick if you felt like doing
so. Well, anyway, good luck on exams, have a great summer, and thanks
to those four or five of you (was it that many?) who kept the faith and

est one to say/This is where the

Strait, from “The Cowboy Rides

Okay, okay. Enough tears.
Yes, folks, “Whistlin’ Dixie” must,
with this final issue of the
Davidsonian, come toaclose. Oh,
sure, I’ll be back now and then for
a review (Garth and Clint Black
will release new projects in Sep-
tember), a look at the CMA’s (re-
member those?), or other big news.

But for my final (huge) instal-
lation of America’s favorite light

‘fewalbums, »generally from today’s
generation of artists, that I feel are
each essential to a country collec-
tion; any one of them would make
a great place to start. I compiled a
small list and then asked a few
“local” country experts to throw in
their additional choices for their
favorite country albums.

(A few of) Matt’s Suggested
Country Delights:

Garth Brooks: Sorry, I can’t
pick one here. If you don’t buy
Garth Brooks, you miss out on
“The Dance” and perhaps his most
truly heartfelt and truly, country
release. If you miss No Fences,
you have passed over the album
that shot him and country music to
‘the fore; you also miss, among
others, one.of the all-time great
songs, “Friends in Low Places”.
Pass over Ropin’ The Wind, and
you simply skip the biggest-sell-
ing, highest ranking country al-
bum of all-time. Take your pick.

Randy Travis: Stormsof Life.
Although the layman might single
out Always and Forever, most
Travis fans agree that nothing can
match his first release.

George Strait: Greatest Hits,
Voll or VolII. Again, too tough to
choose here. I personally might
side with no.2, but youcan’tpossi-
bly go wrong either way.

Hank Williams, Jr.: Great-
est Hits, VolI. No question here.
This album is truly a classic and a
must-have.

Clint Black: Killin’ Time.
Again, this is one of the greatest
country albums ever released. No
one song stands outas the best, but
together, the tunes work to forma

beautifully solid and fluid crea-
tion. Many of my guest panelists
echoed my choice here, and would
have themselves chosen it had I
not.

Okay, so there are a few from
recent years. Now for the guest
panelists, many of whom might
have chosen one from my list,
but, atmy request, added onc extra
instead:

Walter Price: David Allen
Coe, 20 Greatest Hits

Tom Norwood: Vince Gill,

Brent Leviner: Patsy Cline,

Gantt Bumstead (okay, so my

column, and Ill do what I want,
-nyahh): Don Williams, 20Great-
' So, there are a few sugges-
tions to any of you trying to de:
cide on a great country album to
buy. Other suggestions included
the following: —

The Charlie Danicls Band, A
Decade of Hits

Alan Jackson, Don’t Rock
The Jukebox

Mark Chesnutt, Too Cold at
Home ;

Patty Loveless, Honky Tonk
Angel
I wholeheartedly, agree with all
thesechoices. Inaddition, should
note that any of the greatest hits
collections from masters like
Merle Haggard, George Jones,
Johnny Cash, or Hank Williams
would also be great investments
that would assure hours of rapture
and many yee-ha’s.

When I started writing back
in September, I never expected to
continue writing, nor did lexpect
to see country’s influence and
success in the music industry in-
crease. Well, both happened,
didn’t they? I got a lot better at
using this silly computer, and
Garth Brooks is tied now for the
