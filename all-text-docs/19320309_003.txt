In despair, we reach out to America’s Para-
dise Lost—the Lindbergh baby. This tiny bundle
of animated protoplasm seems to have pushed
the entire combined forces of the Chinese and
Japanese from the front pages of the world’s
largest newspapers. He has usurped thousands
of minutes of time via the radio. He has pushed
into the distant background America’s relief
program for countless bankrupt and near-bank-
rupt financial institutions. Truly, this little boy,
one among millions, is the most famous being
alive today.

We note from the Sunday morning papers
that Fleagle and MacMillan took second and
third places, respectively, in the 60-yard dash
for non-conference schools. Fleagle, inci-
dentally, holds the non-conference record for
this event with a time of 6.6.

Somehow or other it doesn’t seem quite fair
that only three men should be awarded letters

In our opinicn, two better captains than
Buddy Gardner and Bruce Peabody for foot-
ball and basketball couldn’t be found. Pea-
body seems to be a natural leader on the
basketball court, while Gardner’s brilliant de-
fensive game at.center should be an inspira-
tion to his teammates.

If Jack Wagner doesn’t look out, he'll find
himself a four-letter man. Football, basket-
ball, golf, and track—no mean record!

The final football scrimmage of the season
last Friday revealed two teams, one with a
strong backfield and the other with an excep-
tionally strong line. The two teams seemed so
evenly matched that neither could make any
headway. Coaches Newton and McEver appear
to have grounded the candidates in the Neyland
system exceptionally well in so short a time,
but it is evident that considerable perfecting in
plays and polishing of individual performance
will be necessary next fall to produce a win-
ning team, At times, the plays work well and
result in considerable gain, but when any player
fails to perform in the precise manner des-
ignated, the whole play is disrupted.

Bruge Peabody, of Charlotte, has been chosen

manager for next season, At the same time, the
lettermen named Robert Glasgow, Jr., Freshman
manager.

Peabody did not make his letter in basketball
until the past season, but was one of the main-
stays of the quintet. He played forward in early
season. competition but was shifted to guard
during the latter half, and largely directed the
offensive attack of Davidson. He ranked third in
scoring honors during the past season, Captain
Mathis and Grier Martin topping his total.

The lettermen also selected as Junior assist

I believe that none of the various causes as-
signed for war would be effective except in the
presence of armed, sovereign states, each ani-
mated by a desire for power and supported by
patriotic populations. I believe, therefore, that
ultimate cure for war is possible, except
hy a diminution in intentions of the emotions
and passions and loyalties which make interna-
tional anarchy possible—W. B. Curry.
