Interview with

After seven months without
a home, the Davidson athletic
program has returned to
familiar surroundings, the
Southern Conference.

Last June, Davidson an-
nounced that it would withdraw
from the conference, following
similar action by William and
Mary, East Carolina and
Virginia Military Institute. The
withdrawal was to take effect at
the end of the 1976-77 academic
year.

However, the Davidson
trustees reversed the June
decision at their January
meeting and said that the
college would remain in the
league.

Athletic Director Thomas
Cartmill cited several reasons
for the trustees’ action: ‘‘There
was a strong desire on the part
- of the conference to get us back
in ... plus the fact that we would

have continued to schedule
some of the (conference)
schools. It enables our people to
have post-season competition
which would not have been
possible if we were independent
and it makes our scheduling
easier,”’

Acting by Virginia Military
Institute, a veteran league
member, also contributed to the
Davidson decision. VMI said in
early 1976 that it also would
withdraw from the Southern
Conference.

Last month, though ; VMI’s
trustees reevaluated their
decision and announced that the
school would remain in the loop.
This action by an established
member of the conference
apparently reassured the
Davidson trustees about the
SC’s future.

Davidson’s tennis team,
easily the winningest of all
Wildcat teams in recent years,
is off to another good start;
winning all but two of their first
9 matches.

The Wildcats have an ex-
tremely young team this year,
with no seniors on the team, and
they are facing the toughest
schedule a Davidson tennis
team has ever attempted.

Coach Jeff Frank does not
expect to equal last year’s
superlative record (20-6-1
overall, 7-0 in the conference),
but he says, ‘“‘This year’s team
is a little stronger than last

Despite this, Frank says,

“Overall, we are playing better
doubles than singles right now.’

confusion between Davidson
and the league.

“There was no clear un-
derstanding. Some conference
members didn’t know where we
stood on football. We will
declare Division II and that is
agreeable with the rest of the

calm Cartmill com-
mented.
Division II status for

BS football will commence next

year. Other sports will remain

; in the Division I category.

When Davidson withdrew

| from the conference in June,

school officials advocated the

.. formation of a new league.
- “Basically, we thought there
was a possibility of creating a

new conference,’’ Cartmill
noted, ‘‘but this has not
materialized. There was a great
deal of talk, particularly in the
Virginia schools.’’

Three schools have joined
the conference since June. The
addition of Western Carolina

- University (Cullowhee, N.C.),
Marshall University (Hun-
tington, W.Va.) and _ the
University of Tennessee at
Chattanooga should com-
pensate for the recent with-
drawals of William and Mary,
East Carolina and Richmond.
Davidson, VMI, Appalachian
State, Furman and The Citadel
are the other members of the
eight-team league.

The winner of the Southern
Conference basketball tour-
nament automatically receives
a bid to the NCAA playoffs.
Cartmill, however; emphasized
that participation in the SC will
benefit non-spectator sports as
well as the basketball program.

“Naturally, it will be ad-
vantageous to both programs.
But outstanding athletes can be
recognized in all sports within
the conference. I feel basketball
is important than recognition of
outstanding athletes in soccer
or tennis, for instance.’

The athletic director also
said that recruiting is easier for
all sports if a school is in a
conference.

Davidson’s participation in

. the Southern Conference is not a

long-term commitment,
cording to Cartmill.

“I think it’s the answer for
the near-future. This approach
is the only approach that can be
taken. None of us knows what

school facing questions about
athletic scholarships. Title IX,

Shooters end with success

By TOM NIBLOCK
Staff Writer

The Davidson College rifle
team ended its regular season
at 15-5-1 with a big win over
William and Mary Saturday,
February 12, at Williamsburg.

The Wildcats broke three
team records as they solidly
defeated William and Mary by
a score of 1286 (out of a
possible 1500) to 1268.

High shooter in the match
was Davidson senior Ben
Simms posting a season high
of 268.

Sophomore Katherine Whit-
ney’s perfect target score of
100 in the prone position was a
Davidson first in recent years.

The five-man team total of
1286 was also a three-year
record high. °

Whitney shot the high knee-
ling score for the match with a
93 and Simms posted the high

standing score of 86.

Davidson’s top five included
Sims at 268, freshman John
Parham with a very commend-
able 260, Whitney at 255,
sophomore Tom Niblock at
252 and sophomore Bob
Shoulders at 251.

Junior Tom Miller also pos-
ted a 251 but was kept out of
the top five scoring due.to the
“High Standing”’ rule.

Other Davidson shooters
included freshman Rob Kir-
kendol at 244, senior Rob

Mitchell at 242 and freshman

Mike Pearson at 236. Fresh-
man Louis Williams, Berkley
Mann and Carol Robinson
posted scores of 215, 210 and
196 respectively.

This was a big win for the
Wildcats after last year’s crus-
hing defeat at the hands of the
Indians.

Commenting on the team’s

performance,team Captain
Tom Miller said, ‘‘We were all
glad that we pulled it off.
Seven hours is a long drive to
have to come back empty-han-
ded.”’

Coach Jerry Flannigan was
particularly pleased with the
strong performance of his
freshman recruits. ‘‘This year
we've been concentrating on

building a strong base for next
year. We’re still a very young
team with ten freshmen and
sophomores on the thirteen-
man roster. We are looking
ahead to a very bright future.”

The Wildcats’ next match
will be a seven-way Western
Carolina Conference tourna-
ment at Davidson, Saturday,
April 2.
