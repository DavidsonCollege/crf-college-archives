The Davidson Packers

Don't look now, out the student
Senate’s being packed. Very quietly,
concealed among 71 other nomina-
tions, the Senate Executive Commit-
tee tried to slip in three new senators
appointed to fill vacancies in repre-
sentation from Watts, Cannon and
East. And if a freshman in Watts
nadn’t caught the attempt and taken
the case to court, the SEC would now
have three pretty sure Senate votes.

It’s rare that such drastic political
tricks occur in Davidson student
government, but the amazing thing
is that the Senate accepted the nomi-
nations without a- murmur and con-
firmed them unanimously. There
were no objections.

Now we aren’t commenting on the
merits of the appointees; for now,
that question is irrelevant. What we
are concerned about is the SEC fol-
lowing in the steps of the Dean's
Council and ignoring the student
voice.- The Senate is to represent the
students, not the president of the
SGA. That was made clear by the
constitutional convention when _ it
voted down, unanimously, a proposal!
to let members of the SEC be voting
members of the Senate if they weren't
elected to it.

The appointments are apparently
unconstitutional, for the SGA Consti-
tution says in two different places
that the senators are to be elected.
But that’s not the point. What is hap-
pening is that the SEC and Senate,
in not allowing Watts, Cannon and
Richardson to elect their senators,
are saying that they know better than
those 358 students who should repre-
sent them, and that they don’t really
care what those students think, be-
cause. those students don’t really

count.

But don’t forget the message to
the faculty and administration. The
SEC is the agency of student govern-
ment specifically designated to work
with the faculty and administration.
What this move to pack the Senate
says is that the SEC is sealing off
avenues of genuine student expres-
sion so that the SEC will seem to be
the voice of the students when in fact
it is expressing its own opinion. How
can the student government on one
hand press for more student voice
on faculty committees and on the
other hand work overtime to deny
students representation in their own
government? The student government
has little enough basis of support
among students without actively un-
dermining what’s there.

And while we're at it. we might as
well go ahead and point out that the
amendment to the constitution that
students “passed” is just as much a
denial of student voice as packing
the Senate. (You remember. It was
read in assembly the day of the walk-
out, and you “voted” on it as you left.
They didn’t get enough votes, so they
walked around afterwards asking peo-
ple, “Have you voted?” If the answer
was no, the person was handed a
ballot. Tammany Hall would be
proud.)

The way the vote was handled made
any idea of referendum a farce.
Again, whether the amendent was
good or bad isn’t the issue (although
we do think it was a mistake); what’s
important is that the student govern-
ment ignored the students it’s sup-
posed to represent.

Stated simply, a 65 percent majority
doesn’t entitle a president to pack
the Senate or railroad amendments.

Disturbing Silence

In the past years The Rumor has
come to be a widely accepted tradi-
tion at Davidson, largely because it
has had the power to generate more
excitement among students than just
about anything else that has happened
on campus. A slight flurry of excite-
ment has been aroused in the past
few weeks by the rumor that the
Dean’s Council plans to do away with
hall counselors. next year.

Usually, rumors can be clarified
into fact or erased entirely by mere-
ly contacting the sourcé involved or
by questioning the subject of the ru-
mor. This time both have been proven
fruitless. The rumor can’t be verified
by its source, nor will the Dean’s
Council say if it is even considering
the change. .

However, since rumors here usually
tend to have at least some factual
basis, it is fairly safe to assume that
the idea has at least come up for dis-
cussion within the council. The sec-
recy behind the discussion is the big
mystery.

There is no doubt that the right
council has control of this matter.
This is a primary concern of the
Dean’s Council.

Profitable

In spite of the fact that its name
sounds like that of a new, baroque-
rock ensemble, the Charlotte Area
Educational Consortium may be one
of the best things that has ever hap-
pened to Davidson.

Very little notice has been made of
the consortium, which was formed
officially last week to include nine
area colleges for the purpose of free
exchange of faculty and students. But
the group has great possibilities and
deserves a good hard look on the part
of students and faculty here.

Under the set-up of the consortium,
students will be allowed to schedule

Memo To EPC

Memo to the Educational Policy
Committee concerning chapel and as-
sembly cuts:

We discovered recently that stu-
dents who live off campus or who
work in the mornings are not required
to attend chapel. and assembly. Now
we do not quarrel with the good for-
tune of these students who are able
to sleep in beds in the mornings
rather than chapel seats.

But we would like to point out to
our bretheren on the EPC the impli-
cations of this policy. If. chapel and
assembly are such an essential part
of the Davidson experience that the
average student receives only three
or four cuts a term, how can the col-
lege justify not requiring attendance
for five to 10 percent of the students?

After all, it seems a bit inconsistent.

But the secrecy is baffling. If the
change is not being considered, then
why hasn’t a simple denial been issu-
ed? If it is, why not seek out student,
or at least freshman, opinion on the
necessity of hall counselors? It seems
certain that they would have the most
enlightening viewpoints on the ef-
fectiveness of the current system and
the best suggestions for its improve-
ment.

The supposed change is aimed at
integrating the freshmen with upper-
classmen, to do away with the “sep-
arate but equal” set-up as it now ex-
ists. Under the rumored new program
freshmen and upperclassmen would
share dormitories, with a pair of coun-
selors provided on each hall during
the first term.

The point is not whether this set-up
is good or bad. That students are not
being consulted on the advantages
or disadvantages of such a change-
over is precisely the point.

We are not suggesting that the
Dean's Council open its meetings to
students, but a survey or evaluation
questionnaire now could avoid a great
deal of discontent and expressed dis-
satisfaction later.

Consorting

courses and transfer credits at other
institutions in the group. This will
be of great value to students here
who desire to complete a course not
offered at Davidson, and also to stu-
dents at the other schools in the same
situation. For example, a Davidson
history major interested in a study
of Afro-American history could enroll
in such a course at Johnson C. Smith
University.

The consortium will also allow for
a free-flowing of ideas from different
theological backgrounds through the
possible exchanges between Belmont
Abbey and Sacred Heart Academy,
both Catholic institutions, and Presby-
terian Davidson or Queens College.
Thus, through the program students
will not have to wait for the integration
of groups of other origins at David-
son. Now they can seek out a joint
program.

A second major advantage is the
plan for visiting professorships with-
in the colleges. The consortium pro-
vides one term for a professor who
specializes in a specific subject to
lecture at another school. This pro-
gram will help to develop strong pro-
grams in several fields of study,
while it will open study of unexplored
disciplines in others. This phase. oi
the consortium will thus help to sup-
plement or implement needed ele-
ments of study in a number of areas.

And, finally, the consortium will
achieve another goal toward which
the college has been working: at least
token coeducation.

Riner Explains Actions
In Conventions Disputes

To The Editor:

I am writing this to ex
plain my position for oppos-
ing the Constitutional Con
vention and for requesting
and obtaining a restraining
order barring further action
of the SEC.

At first glance my position
seems to be nothing but a
mere trifling with constitu.
tional technicalities. But
please do not wrife me off
with such a narrow-minded
stand.

My objection to the Con-
stitutional Convention is
that it is making a com-
plete farce out of parila.
mentary procedure and is
mocking the integrity of:
the Davidson student body.

The calling of a conven-
tion to amend the constitu-
tion twice within six months
cannot mean anything but a
true lack of competence of
the SEC.

Constitutions were made to
function, not to be amended.
So far our Constitution has
not had time to tést itself
against any real situations.

If-it has had no real test,
how can one judge it inopera-
tive?
We should not even have
a Constitution if it is to be
so fragrantly violated as
It‘was in the voting proce-
dure followed by the con-
vention in “adopting” the
amendment concerning the
SEC. 1! would Iike to point
out that the amendment
referendum was not even
conducted by the Elections
Board.

In the coming court case
you will no doubt hear the
argument that the vote on
the amendment showed the
will of the majority of the
student: body.

This may or may not be
true: I don't know. But I
don't think anyone could
really say, because no one
had time to think about what
the amendment stated. Ask
some of your friends. You
will find that many of them
do not know what the ‘‘vote”’
was all about.

Alumnus Knocks ROTC

(Reprinted from the NEW
YORK TIMES. The author
is assoclate editor of ‘’Christ-
lanity and Crisls.’’)

To The Editor:

There is a relatively simple
solution to the serious ques-
tions raised bv the presence
of Reserve Officers Training
Corps on university campus-
es. It ought to satisfy the
schools. the military. and
perhaps even the  over-
wrought Edward D. Decker
(letter, Feb. 9).

Remove it from the cam-
puses entirely. Offer com-
petitive commissions to stu-
dents while in college that
they can earn through inten-
sive officers’ training after
graduation. The  schools—
which quite properly have
raised questions about ROTC
—would be better off, the
military would have better

trained officers, and it would
cost less.

ROTC was and is primarily
a way to locate officers. It
can be done more effectively
outside the academic set-
ting.

In a time of considerably
less ferment I was subjected
to four years of ROTC at Da-
vidson College. N. C. It was
an unmitigated waste of time
and terrible preparation for
military service. I did spend
two years in the U.S. Army
as a reserve officer and even
received a commendation
ribbén for surviving the te-
dium of a 15-month stint in
Korea in the dull days of
1959 60. I can state categori-
cally that there was no re-
lationship between my work
as an officer and my ROTC
training in college.

do with changing a few
lines in the constitution.”

Hopefully, a _—s reasoned
examination in the Court of
Appeals will resolve the pro.
blems raised by the conven-

By ROBERT PYEATT

A Myopic Motivational Mess

One measure of the provincialism of Davidson
College is the value of the concerns that we the stu-
dents occupy ourselves with as a group.

Too often, these concerns are about as relevant
to the outside world as the Basic ROTC curriculum
to nuclear warfare. .

Starting at the lower level and working up, the
majority of the student body is concerned with the
immediate problems of its social life, its grades, pledge
training at its fraternity house and the fate of the
basketball team.

Particlarly the fate of the basketbali team.

Between questions of why Santa Clara is ranked
ahead of Davidson and who are the worst referees
in the Southern Conference, there is no room for
trivial concerns in dinner-table conversation.

Even one Charlotte minister says that the three
main existential questions bugging his congregation
are: “Will Bryan Adrian learn to play defense?” “Can
Mike Maloy pass all his courses for the rest of the
term?” “Will Lefty Driesell go to Clemson or Mary-
land?”

Needless to say, we symbol-hungry students have
refined these problems to an intimate involvement with
the lives of our team. To quote my fellow columnist,
Uncle Percival, “Ah, Hysteria, Thou flower of the Arts.
Thou art as pervasive as the Mid-Winters snow.”

But moving on to concerns that extend beyond
the end of March, there is another group of students
whose particular forte is generally conceded to be
higher on the metaphysical value scale. These are
those movers and shakers of the college community
known as the student government, or the constitution
revisionists.

These doughty souls delight in ever reforming
that instrument of student power and participation,
the S(tudent) G(overnment) A(ssociation) Constitution,
and all its irrelevant appurtenances.

Periodically they engage in vicious in-fighting,
or try to make it look vicious. In the past they have
attempted to impress .their constituencies by con-
fronting the administration, eyeball-to-eyeball as it
were, over such desperate issues as getting more soft
drink machines and PE cuts for an already satisfied
student body, that is, SGA.

But they never really did their thing until they
found the constitution.

This small but dedicated band of constitutional
fetishists probably has secret plans to go on reforming
the damn thing until sometime in the 21st century,
or as they see it, when the millenium comes for Da-
vidson College.

Now, there is nothing wrong with constitutions
or fetishes. But they can be carried to extremes. And
if the current Constitutional Convention isn’t an ex-
treme, then the Wildcat Club isn’t gung-ho.

THE DAVIDSONIAN has run out of copy paper
and I am now typing on the back of -a Wildcat Club
newsletter, which is why I mentioned it.

Some ef the structured structure, etc., is neces-
sary, but it can’t be worth over an afternoon's work
for a powerless student government to structure it-
self.

But the point, if any, of this rambling diatribe is
that the concerns that seem to motivate students on
other, supposedly more enlightened campuses are
largely lacking at Davidson.

War and rascism and poverty are the main topics
of student interest elsewhere, alas not here. But they
do exist, and barely a long jump shot away from the
gym.
The main group concerns of the student body are
forged by academic legalists and frustrated jocks.
These concerns are in the vast majority, but Davidson
will always be a Southern Conference school education-
ally until we get beyond committeeism and revising
ourselves into paralysis.

Davidson Viewed Critically
From French Perspectives

To The Editor:

During the past few months
as a Davidson student at
Montpelier, I have had the
opportunity of obser.ing
from the outside Davidson
College as reflected in THE
DAVIDSONIAN.

I have been glad, yet dis-
appointed; glad to hear about
Davidson and its apparent
progress, disappointed be-
cause THE DAVIDSONIAN,
like its home, Davidson, ap-
pears to be suffering from
lack of questioning, searching
and innovation.

1 say this knowing full
well that this year has pro-
bably marked the greatest
change at Davidson in at
least half a century and
that THE DAVIDSONIAN
has done a good job of re-
porting on the Davidson
situation.

1 congratulate both for
these efforts. To the extent
that THE DAVIDSONIAN
has accurately reported the
present situation, it has ful-
filled {ts responsibility to in-
form Davidson students about
their collgé. I question, how-
ever, whether that is the
limit of its responsibility.

Students in Paris are still
in revolt against what they
regard as an outmoded uni-
versity system, an unjust
political setup and a corrupt
society.

At Davidson, students
question the fraternity sys-
tem and ask, for ¢ better
social outlet through open

dorms and closed doors.

In a letter to THE DAVID-
SONIAN earlier this year,
Marvin Sparrow accused Da.
vidson of holding on to an
outmoded concept of educa-
tion, a concept which has
the student pay his money,
go to class, and receive
from the professor some
mystic goody called know.
ledge.

Did anyone from THE
DAVIDSONIAN put Spar-
row on the spot by asking
him ‘what was wrong with
this concept? Did THE DA.
VIDSONIAN ask him to state
what he though the proper
concept should be?

Did THE DAVIDSONIAN
even question whether this
was the prevailing concept
at Davidson? No to all
three questions!

For at least twce years
there has been an active
number of students argu-
ing for greater student di-
versity: racially, geographi
cally as well as sexually.

Has THE DAVIDSONIAN
asked why? Again No!

Students at Davidson
have been seeking a great.
er voice in the affairs of
the college.

Has THE DAVIDSONIAN
questioned this? No!

Should Davidson be run as
a triumvirate with students,
faculty, and administration
having an equal voice in the

running of its affairs?

' could continue these
questions for columns.
They would serve no addi-
tional purpose because the
answer would be the same.
They would all revolve
around two central ques-
tions: What sort of educa-
tlon should Davidson strive
to provide? What should
be Davidson's relationship
to the exterior world?

During the past year THE
DAVIDSONIAN and from
all appearances, the  stu-
dents, faculty, and admin-
istration have not looked at
the central issues, but con-
tented themselves with touch-
ing the peripheral points.

Is THE DAVIDSONIAN
more anxious to win its
annual awards for the best
college newspaper in the dis-
trict than to serve the needs
of the college community?

t would challenge THE
DAVIDSONIAN to do more
than just report the facts
and peripheral issues as it
does now so well.

I would challenge THE
DAVIDSONIAN to do some
creative penetration to and
analysis of basic issues. to
represent the various sides
of those issues. perhaps by
having persons representing
those sides write guest arti-
cles for THE DAVIDSON.
IAN, and to challenge the
Studerits and the entire com-
munity to think about them.
