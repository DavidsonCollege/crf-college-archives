ship and fair play, win or louse. ‘Lhat spirit has been much in
evidence during recent years with Davidson irequently coming
outat the short end of the hprti. Now that we have a basketball
team that to date has- been hitting the victory ealumn
pretty frequently, we are wondering what has happened to
chat spirit amoung tbe tans (it’s suil there with the teain.)

‘This subject has been hashed and re-hashed both
from the piatform and in these columns. We hope that
what we say here, in light of what “Mayor” Sandifer
said last week, will not be laying it on too thick. But
what we have seen of booing and heckling of officials
and opposing players during the current season seems
to be aetiniteiy out of line with the expected conduct of
Davidson men. Kemember too that such displays often_..

- handicap the play of our own team as weil as creating
a bad impression on the public.

—— And A Tough Week-end

Last’ week's conferenck loss, hard to take as it
was, may have been just what the team needed to get
them set for two tough conference and Big Five games
rriday and Saturday. It certainty removed any sem-

==" plance of over-conhidence the ’Cats might have acquir-.
ed in decisively whipping Carolina and State in early-
season games. Havng dropped from third place to a tie
tor fitth position in the standings, they will be anxious
to improve their conference 1.:mg and possibly gain a
seeded position in the tournament, which is not too
__tar off now. __

We are stil certain that this is the best Wildcat
basketoall team in recent years and one of the out-
- standing teams in the conference this year. A large
number of ‘Lat supporters are planning to follow them
aown east for these two games. So do y,our stutf ’Cats!

Invitational Track Meet Kw
Although basketball enjoys the entire spotlight
at Davidson now, an interesting track and field event
is in the making down Chapel Hill way for the last
day of the month. In spite of the fact that war condi-
tions necessitated cancellation of the regular confer.
ence indoor meet. the officials at UNC were not willing

to see the whole idea tossed aside. An invitational meet | _
is being planned to take the place of the regular event.

Davidson is already making plans to enter five men in

the games. Ben-Lacy willcarry the Wildcatcolors in-the dashes,+-the -$:P-Ks—trounced--the Pikas
while brother Lill is working on the hurdies, broad jump, and serving notice of their intentions to-
high jump. Dick Port in the high hurdies and “Whikzer” White | repeat last year’s uridefeated rec-
and Dick Millet in. the distance runs complete the list of David- | org,

son ‘entrants. \

The meet is expected to attract national interest,
with outstanding athletes from all over the East par-
ticipating. A number of cadets from the pre-flight
school at Chapel Hill will also be entered.
