On Disease
Of Leprosy

Biederwolf Colony Helps
Korean Lepers To Regain
Human Status

In far away Korea there are
seven hundred and thirty lep-
ers in the Biederwolf Leper
Colony and many more wait-
ing outside the Colony gates
hoping and praying that they
may be admitted some day
soon,

The first symptom of the horrible

disease is falling hair. Eyebrows
come out and brand the person as
a leper. Many of them paint eye-

brows on their foreheads in order
to keep their normal, appearance as

There
naduler,

long as possible. are two

kinds of leprosy, which is
skin leprosy, and paralysis, or an-
aesthesia, which attacks and deadens
the nerves of a person afflicted with
it. The latter type of leprosy causes
the cracking of the skin and often
gangrene sets in on the nose, feet
and hands which gradually rot off.
These lepers have no feeling in the
infected parts even though they are
left wide open. Dr. R. M. Wilson,
head of the Leper Colony, once saw
a leper afflicted with this type of
leprosy sitting by the side of the
road sewing up a very raw and
morbid looking crack in his foot
with a needfe and thread and the
man could feel no pain.

The Koreans have hardly any
ideas ds to haw to cure leprosy.
Those who contract the disease are
treated worse than animals by their
fellow man. The only way pos-
sible for them to live is by begging
passersby to give a dead dog a
mite, for that's what they’re com-
monly called, Superstitution plays a
large part in what the Koreans
think is a cure for the dreaded
disease. It is believed by some of
them that eating human flesh is a
cure and one beggar is known to
have sold her three year old child
to a group of traveling lepers who
boiled the child and ate it, Another
superstitution about the cure for
leprosy is that gold dust will cure
it if eaten every day. One prosper-

Gives Concert

Glee Club and Orchestra
Present Service In
Charlotte

The Davidson Glee Club, in
conjunction with the Davidson
Little Symphony Orchestra,
_presented last Sunday night at
the First Presbyterian Church
of Charlotte a program of reli-
gious music.

Starting the service, the orchestra
under'the direction of James Christ-
ian Pfohl played Prelude, by Gla-
zounoff. Directed by Thane Mac-
Donald, the Glee Club gave the call
to worship, singing “Bless the Lord,
O My Soul,” by Ippolitoff—Ivanoff.
Reverend A. S. Johnson, pastor of
the church, gave the invocation,
and the congregation rose with the
singing of “Holy, Holy, Holy.” Next
the Clee Club gave their rendition
of “The Old Rugged Cross,” an
ancient English hymn by Bennard:
Dr. Johnson next read the scripture
and gave the evening prayer.

For the offertory the orchestra
played Rubenstein’s “Melody In F,”
the Glee Club singing as a response,
“We Give Thee But Thine Own,”
the music of which was written by
Mr. MacDonald. “Dear Lord and
Father of Mankind” was the sec-
ond hymn, after which Dr. John-
son gave a short meditation, talk-
ing on the value of being a Christ-
ian.

The orchestra next gave “An-
dante” by Brahms, and the Glee
Club gave its fourth number, sing-
ing “The ‘Creation” by Richter.
The hymn “God of Our Fathers”
followed this, and Dr. Johnson pro-
nounced the benediction, after
which a moment of silent prayer
was held. The Glee Club sang the
choral amen, a response by Mr.
MacDonald, which concluded the
service.
