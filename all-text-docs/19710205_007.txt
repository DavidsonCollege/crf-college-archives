~’Cats To Meet

Vengeful ’Cocks

By A. W. TURNER
Asst. Sports Editor

A rough week awaits Da-
vidson’s cagers as the Wild-
cats face two teams in the
next five days who have re
venge on their minds. To-
morrow night the team tra-
vels to West Virginia to
meet the Mountaineers, and
Wednesday the ‘Cats meet
South Carolina at Charlotte.

The Wildcats’ should be
rested for their game _ to-
morrow night. After a tough
loss to Wake Forest last
Saturday night, they went to
ViM.I. Head Coach Terry
Holland's squad had no trou-
ble in running over the Key-
dets by a 70-39 count.

“V.M.I. tried to stall a
little at first,’’ Holland said,
“and it just didn't work.
Defense hag, beef our: strong
point all yéat, so. the slow
down was our kind of game.
They opened it up in the se-
cond half.’ But the ‘Cats
had no trouble in the se-
cond half either as they rol
led up an easy win.

Things won't be that’ easy

this week, The Mountaineers

are still smarting from the
earlier loss this season to
the ‘Cats, in which both
teams had off nights.

West Virginia star Will
Robinson had a_particularly
poor shooting night, and
Holland indicated he may be
out to show Davidson guard
Duncan Postma, his shadow
in the January meeting,
that he can score. ‘‘They'!]

be playing at home _ this

time, too,"’ Holland _ said,
“and that will be to their
advantage."'

‘Wednesday night, David-

son will return .to the Char-
lotte Coliseum to face the
Gamecocks before what
should be a_ sellout crowd,
Holland called South Caro
lina ‘tan overwhelming and
awesome team."

U.S.C. is still seeking re-
verge for their two straight
losses to Davidson, and par-
ticularly for last year's
beating at Columbia. ‘'The
key to last year's win for
us," Holland _ continued,
“was our rebounding. We
must outrebound them this
year, too, if we are-to win.”

In last season's upset,
Bryan Adrian provided the
scoring punch, and tke front
line of, Mike Maloy, Doug
Cook, and Jerry Kroll did
a superb job on the boards.
But the front line has grad
uated and Adrian is. still
having knee trouble.

The Valentine, a traditional
symbol.of love and affection,
once stung the recipient with
acid-tongued barbs sct to

verse.

“Penny Dreadfuls,” also
known as “Vinegar Valen-
tines” or “Rudes and Crudes,”
were popular from the 1840's
to the early 1900's.. They orig-
inated in England and were
cruel caricatures of bother-
some acquaintances. In 1870,
Charles Howard, an American
cartoonist, designed some
“Penny Dreadfuls” printed on
coarse paper and these (un-

derstandably) were usually
sent anonymously.

Many countries banned
them as crude and obscene.
Early in the 20th century, the _
Chicago Post Office refused to
handle 25,000 of the cards,
claiming they were not fit to
be carried in the mail. _

A typical quip: “'Tis all in
vain, your simpering looks;
you never can incline, with all
your bustles, stays and curls
to find a Valentine.”

One poison-pen card from
the Victorian Era wasted no
words: “You silly, bad, im-
modest flirt,” it said, “you
promenade the street —and
wink with longing, wicked eye
at every man you meet.”

Today Valentines are more
humorous. Some carry a gentle
slam — but insults really don’t
belong on a greeting card.

wishes to all the Valentines
