Indications Point to Stren- Attractive Lyceum Course

uous Game With Clem-
son On Friday

|

|

Coach Crayton Working His Men Hard
for This All-Important Struggle

|

With two scalps hanging from its
belt, the Wildcat clan is putting on.
fresh war paint in view of the Clemson
game Friday. There are more reasons
than one why the Red and Black ma-
chine is out for blood in this game.
Foremost in the minds of the old men
is the sad recollection of the outcome of
the struggle last year when Clemson
emerged from the Thanksgiving game
the winner by a 7 to o score. This was
the only instance during the abbreviated
season where Davidson was scored on.

Going into the game Friday with the
record of not having been scored on this
season as yet, and with one of the best
teams ‘the Red and Black has had in
years, Davidson will undoubtedly put
up a better game of football than in
either of the previous games.

Clemson will be one of the most for-
midable foes that Davidson will play
this year. The Tigers swamped Ers-
kine Saturday by the score of 52 to o.
This speaks remarkably well of the of-
fensive strength of the Tiger machine,
but hitting a line like Davidson and
Erskine are two entirely different miat-,
ters. The whole Clemson backfield of |
last year is back, including Banks, ca
tain and quarter; Allison and Harris, :
fullbacks, and Armstrong and Odell,
halfbacks. ‘The whole team is compos-,
ed of letter men, eighteen having re-!
turned this year.

A strange coincidence concerning the,
game next Friday is -that Hammett,
who helped score a victory over David-
son last year, will be in the game again,
but fighting in an opposite direction.
Hammett has proven a tower of strength
at left tackle this year and envious eyes
will be cast upon him by Clemson fol-
lowers when the begins the contest
against his old team mates next Friday.

The Davidson line will probably be
the same as it has been during the last
two games. Miley and Douglas, ends;
Hammett and McMaster, tackles; La-
Far and Romefelt, guards; Brady, cen-
ter. The personnel of the backfield will
probably undergo a slight change. The.
return. of Johnny Johnston, fast year’s
crack halfback, will necessitate a shake-'
up somewhere. “Johnny” was David-
san’s most consistent ground gainer last
year and he seems to be in the same
rare condition this year. Black will un-
doubtedly continue at lefe half and
Spann at quarter, Johnston will prob-
ably play right half, while Shepherd
will be at full. At any event, the
strength of the back field next Friday
will be much better than it has yet been
this season, as every regular will be in
the game in mid-season trim.-

A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNI-
TY!—A GIRL AND A TICKET |
AT ONE SHOT.

One day last week the student body
was favored with a talk by Mrs. A. A.
McGeachy, of Charlotte. Mrs. Mc-
Geachy has the unique distinction of be-
ing the first woman to appear before the:
Davidson student body at chapel. She
came to tell the students of the ap-
proaching musicales in Charlotte which
are to be given under the auspices of
the Queens College Alumni Association.
During the first part of October Char-
lotte will hear one of the most famous
of artists. Galli-Curci.

A very attractive proposition was
made to the students by Mrs. Mc-
Geachy. The first ten students to pur-
chase tickets for the four performances

Blue Pencil Club Meets for
First Time

To Reward Best Worker for Maga-
zine With Medal

The Blue Pencil Club held its first
meeting of the year last Wednesday
night. This meeting was’ merely for
organization for the year and = many
plans were discussed.
the Sigma Upsilon decided to give a
medal for work on the Davidson Col-
lege Magazine. This medal is not given
for purely literary work, but to the one
whose literary efforts are good and who
proves the greatest aid to the magazine.

With the Sigma Upsilon behind the

magazine, this year should be the best.

Among others, |

Victory Number Two was added to
the 1919 Wildcat football invasion,
when Wake Forest's colors were lower-
ed to the tune of 21 too. Steam-roller
.tactics in hitting the line enabled the
Davidson backfield to score three touch-
downs against their heavier adversaries.
These scores came in the second, third
and fourth quarters, respectively. Hand-
_icapped by the lengthy kick-off in the
which rolled behind her
own goal line, Davidson was unable to
advance the ball beyond mid-field.

Black scored all of Davidson's touch-
downs by his famous broken field run-
ning and line plunging. It was just a
case of ton strong a line for Wake For-
est, and after the first quarter, the Bap-
tists didn’t bave a chance. Although
outweighed by their opponents, the Red
and Black line continually opened up
tholes which enabled the backfield to gain
_ consistently. Also their breaking
through and blocking the punts and
drop kicks of Rabenhoist hada large
and distinct bearing on the Davidson
ivictory. Twice in the first quarter, the
‘Wake Forest stellar fullback attempted
field goals without success.

The game was marred by many fum-
bles on both sides near the close. With
the exception of this fault, the game was
_fast and both sides were full of the old
gridiron slogan—“fight.” Captain Ra-
benhoist, Blackshear, Jennette, the craf-
ty Baptist quarter, and Olive featured
for, Wake Forest, while “Jack” Black
and “Henry” Spann'’s work sere the
loutstanding assets of the Wildcat offen-
| sive, .
| The attendance included scores of vis-
‘itors from Raleigh and other nearby
‘towns, Governor Bickett, alumnus of
Wake Forest, and State Treasurer B.
R. Lacy,-who has tworsons at Davidson,
were among the enthusiastic spectators.
First Quarter.

Heckman, kicking off for Wake For-
est, kicked behind the Davidson goal
line. Black and Cassell by end runs suc-
ceeded in bringing the ball to the 4o-
_yard line, only to lose it on a fumble.
By straight football, the Baptists, going
better than at any latter stage of the
/game, advanced the ball to the 15-yard
jline. The Red and Black line stiffened
and Rabenhoist attempted a field goal.
It was blocked, a Wake Forest player
recovering the ball. Being held for
downs, the ball went over and Davidson
carried the ball to midfield. The quar-
iter ended with the ball in Davidson’s
possession on the 4o-yard line. Score:
: Davidson 0; Wake Forest o.

Second Quarter,
| Opening up the quarter with a rush,
| the Wildcats, enabled by the great work
tof the line, advanced to the five-yard
‘line. The punch was lacking. however,
land Wake Forest held them for downs,

the hall going over. Unable to gain,
Wake Forest made an unsuccessful at-
tempt to punt and Davidson recovered
the ball on the tg§-yard line. In the
last three minutes of play, Black. car-
ried the ball over for the first touch-
down. Goal was kicked. The half
ended with the ball in Wake Forest's
possession in midfield. Score: David-
son 7; Wake Forest. o,
Third Quarter,

Wake Forest received the kick-off ‘on
their five-yard line. Failure to advance
forced them to punt. Davidson fum-
bled on the 35-yard line and lost the
ball. Wake Forest in turn) fumbled,
but recovered the ball only to lose it
on another misplay. Here Davidson
began a spurt of line bucks which car-
ried the ball within the shadows of the
goal posts, Black carried the ball over
for the second touchdown. = Gual was
kicked. “The quarter ended before play
was resumed. Score: Davidson 14;
Wake Forest o.

DON'T BE A COTTON PICKING “SLACKER”

kick.’

j method for raising money for financing
:4 band, suggested that the students se
.cure the desired funds by picking cotton.
They did—pick cotton.

The Fresh were selected to begin the
Procedure. An early breakfast was pro-
ivided for them on the 26th as there was
formation a few minutes later. At the
rcammand “fall in" 172 representatives
| of the class of '23 arranged themselves
ina crescent with one horn on Dormi-
i tory Row. ‘The roll was called and ab-
sent members rounded up, The fortu-
nate ones were then divided into squads
of from 9 to 30 Fresh each, and march-
ed to Shearer Hall, where transporta-
tion awaited them-in the form of ten
wagons and eight.cars. There the pa-
irade began. “Phe leading wagan ini
itiated the sport by having one of | its
seats (boards) to fall followed by those
jwho sat thereon, One lot went to the
north but the remaining seven batches
,of Fresh were hauled or motored, as the
case was, to the south of town and the
‘majority of them came to rest, or rather
‘to work, in the neighborhood of Bethel
church.

Lunch hour was observed, and very

scrupulously, from 12:30 till 1:30. Din-
ners had been provided by local board-

ling houses for the toilers and the pick-

ers had no trouble in providing for the
dinners.

Due to the thoughtfulness of Mr.
Long, Mr. Elliott, Knox and Barnette,
‘Smiley, the Davidson Kandy Kitchen,
Col. Mueller and Mr. Hampton, iced
drinks were served to the men in the af-
ternoon, “Starving men grasping for
food” is a favorite figure of fiction but it
was absolutely left behind by the way
the hoys grabbed those dppes which
jwere offered them. Appreciated is the
‘word. Mayor Sloan contributed five
dollars to the cause to “Help with your
hand,” as he expressed it.

A reporter from the Davidsonian and
the staff photographer visited seven of
the scenes of action in the afternoon.
Everywhere the spirit was the same.
Not that there were no time-killers in
evidence but they were very much in
the minority. Every party wanted to
:know what the other had done and to
‘congratulate or console themselves as
‘the reply required.

1 At Gamble's, the first point visited,
the boys were working in the shadow
of the mountain (15 miles away). No
argument was necessary to persuade
them to quit work and indulge. At
Bumgarner’s a ten-acre field was in the
process of being de-cottoned. Ten men

. on one farm said that they were on

‘their way to unload a wagon which
upon examination was found to be al-
most empty. On still another farm half
the men were picking cotton and the
remainder seemed to be holding down
the cotton pile.
