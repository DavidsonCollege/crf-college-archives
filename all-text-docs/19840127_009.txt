Hissam Contends For Southern Conference Crown

By KERRY BROWN

The key to improvement for a college
wrestling team is experience, and with-
out experience talented young wrestling
squads (such as this year’s Davidson
Wildcats) usually have bad seasons. But
the young ‘Cats are not all toddlers. The
Wildcats have seniors Tom Hissam,
John Breidenstine, and junior Mike
Keeley returning to the squad, and this
talented trio will be joined by Tom
Cardwell, Mike Adams, John Lay, and
Rod Duffee. With the leadership pro-
vided by the senior-junior triumvirate the
‘Cats have a good change for the NAIA
District 26 Championship.

Tom Hissam, a 177-pound senior, 1s
Davidson's Hercules in wrestling shoes.
Last year Hissam was 25-4-1, had 14 re-
versals (a team high), and 11 decisions
towards his team-high record. Hissam’s
strength and experience puts him in con-
tention for the Southern Conference 177-
pound crown during the 1984 season.

While Hissam provides strength and
experience to the squad his peer John

Catawba Breidenstine easily defeated
both his opponents. Mike Keeley, a
tough competitor, saw his 1983 wrestl-
ing season ruined by a knee injury, but
Breidenstine is Mr. Finesse for the young Keeley has obviously recovered because
and victory-starved Wildcats. in the Catawba-Furman dual
Breidenstine led the team in escapes (28) Keeley massacred both his opponents.

and in pins (8) in 1983. During a dual Hissam, Breidenstine and Keeley
wrestling contest against Furman and will have to be at their best for the 1984

contest
