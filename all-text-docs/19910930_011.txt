Oma Blaise: Sexuality & Health

By Oma Blaise

It has been 150 years since
the mass production of condoms
was made possible; it has been as
long since there has been a real
breakthrough in contraceptives
for men. As Mark Cohen points
out in his article in the September
1991 issue of Gentlemen’ s Quar-
terly magazine (“In Search of
the Male Pill’’), some obstacles
in the path of research are “the re-
lentlessness of the male repro-
ductive tract,” the reluctance of
pharmaceutical companies to
pick up contraceptive research
and production, and the fact that
AIDS has made the use of con-
doms a practical necessity.

Althoughnothing marketable
has yet been developed, there
have been several promising
‘| advances toward the production
of a viable “male pill’ akin to
women’s oral contraceptives.
Two. methods are seen as par-
ticularly likely to.end up as con-
sumeritems.... ~

One method is the injection
ofluteinizing hormone-releasing
hormone (LHRH) antagonists.
LHRHantagonists block the sig-
nal to the brain that triggers the

Under Examination

“the pill,” a supplementary
hormone must be administered
with the LHRH antagonists.
Further research is focused on
finding a more acceptable
method of administering the
chemical than nightly or weekly
injections.

A second method is a de-
vice called the Shug, invented
by Dr. Lourens Zaneveld. The
Shug isasilicone plug thatactu-
ally blocks sperm from being
released into the seminal fluid.
Although surgery is required to
implant and remove the device,
the procedures are very minor.
This is admittedly a more per-
manent method of contracep-
tion, but the rate of reversibility
should be exceedingly higher
than that of a vasectomy.

Due to questions about
whether men would actually use
thenewcontraceptives, the phar-
maceutical industry has been
somewhat reluctant to lend
much needed support to the
continued research on these two
methods.

It will be at least ten years,
according to scientists, before
America will see a new mal

Tombstone Revives Forgotten Tale of Bravery

Curiosity dragged me info
Davidson’s cemetery, the one on
North Main, where I, careful where
my feet fell, wandered about and
glanced at tombstones. There, just
beyond the flourishing water oak
and the circling path lies a row of

white marble obelisks, Each obe- ,

lisk bore a seal of either-the Eume-
nean Society or the Philanthropic
Society.

One in particular found my
eye. The wind and rain had weath-
ered its words into whispers of its
former self. I sought to read the
shadow-like impressions with my
eyes and fingertips, but could only
decipher the name: David Yonan.

But the name was enough.
What time destroyed, the archives
preserved. And what the archives
preserved, I will relate.

Procrastination Plagues

By Curt Bickers

David Yonan, a son of a Per-
sian aristocrat, graduated from
Davidson in 1900. A month after
his graduation he attended a Pres-
byterian picnic at old Wither’s
place, River View. Of course, with
apicnic by ariver, there was swim-
ming. From what] gather, the river
was quite wide with depths below
30 feet.

Around 4:00, two swimmers
were suddenly overcome with ex-
haustion: Ralph Helper and Fred
Hobbs. Mr. Madison Maxwell
heard their cries for help, leapt in
the water, and started swimming.
Hobts, who graduated in Yonan’s
year, insisted that he was alright
and that Maxwell should concen-
trate on Helper. Unfortunately, as
soon as Maxwell left, Hobbs sank.

Although he was not much of

, the normal gathering of friends at

Has anyone ever approached *” her apartment for pre-court drink-

you with the topic of discussion
being the “Birds and the Bees’?
Well, you sheltered Davidson stu-
dents, animals teach us many
things. For example, the swallow
teaches us how to build. The bee
teaches us how to work. ©

An animal that is very impor-
tant to the Davidson College stu-
dent is the raven. Of course every-
one knows the raven represents

ominous doom. Therefore the ra-
ven and the tough Davidson work- _

load go hand-in-hand. One very

- interesting piece of trivia which

Dr. Holland conveyed to me about
this bird was its squawk. It says,
“Cras, cras!” ‘Cras,’ comes from
an obscure root and means “to-
morrow.” ‘Cras’ is part of the word
“procrastination.”

Procrastination means... well,
justask any Davidson student, and
he or she can tell you.

Countless scenarios come to
mind when pondering the procras-

* tinating scene at Davidson.

Scenario I: It is Friday night, the
MCAT’ sare two weeks away, and
Betty hasa big dilemma. The night
before, she had taken a practice
MCAT and had failed miserably
on the Biology part. Not only was
Biology her major, but she also felt
most secure about that section of
the MCAT. But tonight there are

‘| two court parties, not to mention

ing games. “Ah!,” she exclaims,
thinking about how she had been
studying since the summer, and
about how she can study all the
next day. So she goes out and en-
joys herself while the raven sits
above her bedroom door saying,
“Cras!”

Scenario II: Paul has two papers,
one mid-term, and One heckuva
headache. He has been up since the
crack of dawn--diving practice,
classes from morning until eve-
ning, and then work until nine at
night. He knows he has not read
the last two 300 page books for his

class with a mid-term, and he has ©

only the research done for his two
papers. What’s more, the test is
tomorrow atnoon, one paper is due
at five tomorrow afternoon, and
the other paper is due in two days
time. His head has “I need rest!”
written all over it, and his caffeine

’ highis wearing off. “I can justtake

a short nap,” he thinks as he drifts
off in the library at a quarter after
nine in the p.m. Hedistinctly thinks
he hears the sound of a raven
squawking, “‘Cras!”’ when to his
chagrin, he looks on the library
wall and notices that it is a quarter
until one in the a.m.

Seriously, procrastination af-
fects everyone at Davidson. From
papers to newspaper articles to
asking someone toa date function,

a swimmer, Yonan raced into the
water to save Hobbs. His altruism,
however, rivaled his strength, and
the would-be Persian doctor fal-
tered. From the shore Rev. A. T.
Graham, unable to swim, called
Yonan back. But Yonancontinued
to struggle towards Hobbs until
finally, the water dragged him
down.

Because of the lack of technol-
ogy, Davidson was unable to ship
his body back to Persia, and so
Yonan was buried in the Davidson
plot on July 13, 1900. The Eume-
nean Socicty erected the obelisk in
memory of David Yonan.

And after discovering his story,
the words on his gravestone seem
easier to read: “Greater love hath
no man than this, that a man lay
down his life for his friend.”

Students

all students, at one time or another,
have had some necessary but fear-
ful bit of work which they have
needlessly put off. Do we actually
think it will go away? Most of the
time, the raven of procrastination
comes back to haunt us, when we
recognize only too late, that if we
had just one more hour of time, the
task we neglected would be just a
bit better.

In talking to students, the vari-
ous ways they suggest to go about
procrastinating include everything
from playing music on the stereo,
to going to the library (social scene
central), to going ona Union break,
to watching TV, to having sex with
an acquaintance (yes, someone
actually told me this, I am not that
scandalous) or just driving around.

Why do students procrastinate?
In. many cases, students feel the -
task being put off is “overwhelm-
ing,” and is insurmountable at the
time. One student replied, “I want
the work to be perfect. If it is not, I
start over.” Another said, “I do not
necessarily want to procrastinate,
it just happens. I just like to split
my work up. I cannot study all of
the time.”

» The ominous doom of work
looms over all Davidson students.
But no Davidson student is here
that cannot handle the workload, if
enough time is given to it: So, the
next time the raven of procrastina-
tion comes knocking at your cham-
ber door, just try for once to tell it,
“Nevermore!”
