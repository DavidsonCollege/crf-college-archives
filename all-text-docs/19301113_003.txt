Give Stellar Performances

With Don McQueen leading the way and
being ably assisted in his ball-toting efforts
by Fraley and McCall, the Davidson Wild-
cats hung up their first victory in,three
starts last Saturday by taking the Wofford

Terriers into camp, 13 to 0. Davidson count-

ed in the first five minutes of play

shackled the running attack of the Terriers

So as to never cause any doubt in the minds |
of the unusually quiet crowd of the final |

outcome of the game.

Wofford threatened only once during the
entire game, and a fighting Davidson line
turned this back. A recovered fumble and
two hard drives placed the ball within the
five-yard line, but there Davidson braced and
Brock then punted out.

Except for Davidson's initial drive for a
score and their march in the third period,
the ball was punted back and forth between
the two teams. Brock, McQueen and Mills
co-operated to far outpunt the South Caro-
linians and one or two quick kicks from a
fake formation caught the Wofford safety
asleep.

Davidson passed.only three times during
the entire game, the smallest number of
aerials that the Wildcats have attempted
this year. Two of these were completed and
the third was incomplete over the goal line
to break up one of Davidson’s drives. Seven
Terrier heaves brought no completions, six
being grounded and one intercepted.

The Davidson. team, coming on the field
smarting from two consecutive defeats from
out-of-state forces, started a hard, unstop-
pable drive towards the Terriers’ goal, and
with Don McQueen, hard-plunging fullback,
and Captain Walter Fraley, ‘halfback, doing
almost all the running, the Wildcats had
pushed over their first score in exactly eleven
plays. Fraley’s placement was good for the
extra point.

After having shown what they could do,
the Wildcats slowed down, and Wofford
made its most serious threat. A Wofford
man recovered a Davidson fumble in Wild-
cat territory and the visitors started a drive
towards the Wildcat goal. Fox slid off left
tackle for a first down. Willis made another
first with two hard running plays. Three
more plays brought the ball to the five-
yard line, but here the aroused red jerseyed
line held and the ball went over. Brock
kicked well out of danger.

The most spectacular play of the day oc-
curred in the second quarter. McCall started
off on a long left end run, but soon found
himself facing a trio of Wofford tacklers.
Stopping suddenly, he completely reversed
his field and, behind hastily formed interfer-
ence, swept around right end for 28 yards,

If Davidson really plays the game of

believe that the Wildcats will slip up on
Carolina and hand them a lacing that
