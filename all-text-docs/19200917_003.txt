in Life— Largest Congregation
Ever Assembled at Davidson

Speaking ‘to one of the largest
congregations Davidson has ever
seen, Dr. Richards in his Sunday
sermon, pointed out the vital im-
portance of a Definite Purpose in
the Christian life.

The speaker took his text from
the twelfth chapter of Second
Chronicles, in which the sacred his-
torian spoke of Rehoboam as a fail-
ure “Because he prepared not his
heart to seek the Lord.” As in the
life of this king of Israel, so in
every life or undertaking confusion
is wrought by the lack of purpose.
Dr. Richards showed how foolish it
would be to begin a building with-
out a plan, to start in business with-
out an aim to build a character
without some goal higher than that

=\of morality.

“No man ever did right, who did

=(not have a definite purpose,” there-

fore he urged everyone in the con-
gregation, at the beginning of this
new college year, to set a definite
purpose that will take them to God.

Turning to the students he asked
them what was their purpose of
caming to college. 1f their aim was
just to be coming, he said that their
reports would be Sixties and Seven-
ties interspersed with re-examina-
tions. Instead of this lack of pur-
pose he appealed to them to have a
definite one so that at the end of
their college course they will be
men, four-square, well trained and
equipped to go forth worthy sons of
such a Mother.

He then pointed out that this
would be no easy task, for David-
scn is not Heaven, neither does it
rest under any millennial light.
Only men who have their hearts
fixed to go alt the way with the
risen Christ may ever hope to attain
the rewards of Eternity.

Every member of the congrega-
tion must have felt the inspiration

/0f this strong sermon for right liv-

ing, and went way fully determined
to let nothing hinder them in ac-

= |complishing the highest goal of all,
(that of seeking the Kingdom of

God and His righteousness.

MISSION STUDY CLASSES.

“Faiths of Mandkind” by Soper,
will be the text for the Mission
Study Classes this fall.

This interesting study presents
a sympathetic examination of the
man element in Hinduism, Budd-
hism, Mohammedanism, Confucian-
ism, Shintoism, Parseeism and Ju-
daism and compares their teachings
with those of the Christian faith.

Everyone who decides to take up
this course will find it at once fasci-
nating and highly rewarding.

Classes will begin Sunday morn-
ing at 10 o'clock. For the conven-
ience of those who take up this
study, there will be a class on every
flood and two in town.

Y. M. C. A. PLANS EXTENSIVE

SOCIAL SERVICE. This space reserved for

Southern Life and Trust Co.

Greensboro, N. C.

In the work of the Social Service
Committee of the “Y” this year
there is a great opportunity to be of
real service to one’s fellow men.
The work will not only fall along
the line of Sunday Schools, but
there will be playground and boy
scout work, as well as teaching in
one or two night classes.

The plan of the committee is to
have a series of stereoptican lec-
tures at the Mill Chapel in order to
arouse interest in the Sunday
School work there. The playground
work, the work among the boys,
and the night classes will gradually
grow from this beginning. The com-
mittee hopes also to do some work
among the colored people of David-
son. .

CHRISTIAN ENDEAVOR.

The Davidson Christian Endeav-
or Society held a most encouraging
and enthusiastic meeting last Sun-
day afternoon. The attendance was
splendid, and it is hoped that the
many new men present will become
regular members.

The outlook for the autumn work
is far more promising than at any
other time m the history of the
Society. The students who have
been Christian Endeavors in their
home towns will have an opportu-
nity to enter a real live-wire or-
ganization.

The various efficiency contests
and unusual social features, now be-
ing planned will make the Society
work a thing you cannot afford to
miss. Come out next Sunday and
see what an “up-to-the-minute” C.
E. looks like.
