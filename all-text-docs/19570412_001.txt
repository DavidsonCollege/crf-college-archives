Now is the time for all good Davidsonians to come
the aid of the fairer sex—and vice versa. Spring came
a few days ago; the girls arrived a few hours ago; it is
the season when all should take up their blankets and
walk.

The weekend will have much in store for those with
dates. It is the time to journey to the river, the mountains,
or any other reasonably nearby spot which whim or ex-
pediency may dictate.

_ Before we grind our ivy league buckles into the
eager and as yet tender young grass as we relax on the
campus in the afternoon to the priceless strains of Les
Brown’s music, let us pause a moment and reflect in awe
at the colossal amount of preparation that made all this
possible.

There was spring cleaning that had to come to Belk.
There were shoes to be polished—in person since the
pledges have been initiated. There were dinner jackets
that had to be cleaned from last spring. There were scores
of parents that had to be persuaded to part with the neces-
sary funds and/or transportation.

Neither an excess of fun nor a lack of funds; neither
a hot gym nor a cold date; neither wet weather nor a
dry party; neither the other fellow’s more beautiful date,
nor any other creature shall dampen our joy that Spring
Frolics has come, and with it, all that is pleasant in life—

For Gala Weekend

namely, girls.

We hasten to take this opportunity to welcome you
to our fair campus. Lest we should have appeared boast-
ful of our own efforts to make your stay here enjoyabie,
we shall give recognition to those unseen martyrs who
work behind the scenes. The maintenance department has
imported for your benefit such rare items as leaves, sun-
Shine, grass, and new shrubbery.

The janitors have performed yeoman service in tasks
above and beyond the call of duty; they have swept under
the beds in Belk. We are assured that Les Brown and
his band have practiced many extra hours to make smooth
music for the couples who will attend the dances.

Perhaps you will already have noticed the most out-
standing additions to the campus. No less than two (2)
new gravel paths have been inserted in front of Belk
(where they should have been in the first place) to replace
the unsightly old home-made paths that disgraced us
during Mid-Winters.

Perhaps, though, the most profound addition is the
; timely arrival of the four (4) hugh clocks gracing the

tower of the local cathedral, and rendering Davidson one
of the most up-to-the-minute schools in the South. This
Striking addition has been brought in at great time and
expense so that you may know how late it is getting from
any point in Mecklenburg, Cabarrus. or Iredell Counties.

DAVIDSONIAN POLL

Students Vote
For Educator

“The most important prerequisite for the new Presi-
dent of Davidson College is that he be an educator.” This
was the outstanding consensus that the Davidsonian Fea-
ture Staff polled this week from a cross section of near-
ly half of the Davidson student body.

This opinion was reflected in
the first question asked: “What
type of man do you favor for
the President of Davidson? Ed-
ucator; Minister; Business Man;
Athletic Booster; Public Rela-
tions Man; or Combination of
any two.” Of those participat-
ing 40% chose single prefer-

ences, with the selections di-

vided into:
Educator —._..___. 88%
Minister ._....... 6%
Business Man 4%
Athletic Booster _.. 5%
Public Relations Man 2%
The remaining 60% fixed

two qualifications; with Edu-
cator again far in front, appear-
ing in 88% of the combinations.
The break down being:
Educator—Bus. Man — 28°

Educator—Ath. Booster 27%
Educator—Minister 20%
Educator—Pub. Relat. 13%

The other 12% of the pair
ings divided rather evenly and
were as follows:

Bus. Man—Ath. Booster 2.7%
Bus. Man—Pub. Relat. 2.4%
Minister—Bus. Man 3.6%
Minister—Ath. Booster 1.0%
Minister—Pub. Relat. 0.5%
Ath. Booster—Pub.

Relations . .. 1.8%

The second question asked
was of the “which do you fa-
vor?” type. Over 52% indicated

that their choice was “A man

Grier Davis Will Edit
“Scripts "a Pranks”

Grier Davis won the race for editor of the ‘Scripts

‘n Pranks”, campus humor-l

on March 26.

In accepting his new post,
Davis particularly stressed the
fact that he was open to con-
structive criticism: “Although I
have a good many of my own
plans, I am interested in dis-
cussing with anyone any ideas
that they might have concern-
ing changes in the magazine
and its real purpose on cam-
pus.”
Concerning the magazine, Da-
vis commented, “It’s obviously
not serving much of a purpose
on campus now, either as a
literary outlet or as a genuine
humor magazine.” Although
definite policy for next year
has not yet been decided, Da-
vis stressed that there are at
least two things that a magazine
can do, Satire can be presented
in a constructive way, (‘There
are numerous _ incongruities
here on campus that need to be
satirized") and the magazine
should be a breeding ground
for new writers and should
stimulate potential.

There is a possibility of hav-
ing four issues next year, but
the three definite issues will
tentatively provide a study of
humor, a parody, and an issue

iterary magazine, in voting

similar to the Davidson Gentle-
man issue, with a purpose of
constructive criticism, a social
satire rather than a pompous
farce.

This year Davis, a_ rising
senior from Asheville, has been
editorial assistant on “Scripts
‘n Pranks” and has written for
it for the past two years. He
was also a feature writer for
the Davidsonian, secretary of
Sigma Chi, and vice-president

of the Male Chorus.

“We Need’
A Big Man’

“This is such a big job that
we want a big man to fill it.”
Thus spoke the chairman of the
Trustees Presidential nomina-
ting committee, Mr. D. R. LaFar
of Gastonia in a recent tele-
phone interview with the Da-
vidsonian.

LaFar stated that at the most
recent meeting of the nomi-
nating group no names had
been officially discussed. Previ-
ous to that nieeting, the com-
mittee had given the College
faculty and the Board of Trus-
tees an opportunity to express
their opinion on the matter of
selecting a new president and
to offer any names which they
felt should be considered.

DIFFICULT JOB

Chairman LaFar pointed out
that he felt that the job of
selecting a new president for
the College would be a long
and difficult one. He saw
little possibility of a nomina-
tion by May.

Plans are being made to al-
low the student body to ex-
press its opinion as to the type
man it would prefer as presi-
dent. “The committee is inter-
ested in .student opinion and
will seek to obtain it at the ap-
propriate time.”

When asked whether Mr.
Spencer Love was still a mem-
ber of the committee, Mr. La-
Far said that he was, and that
any report to the contrary was
entirely wrong.

No potential presidents have
been contacted in any way, and
probably will not be for quite
some time. When the commit-
tee makes its choice, the
nominee will be contacted be-
fore his name is presented to
the Board.

from the. Trustee Presidential
Nominating Committee in
which the Committee invited
representatives from the Stu-

dent Council to attend a meet-|.
ing Friday, April 19, at the]...

Building in Charlotte,
they will be invited to give

PANEL DISCUSSION

Fraternity Open Forum
Answers Questions

Approximately two hundred
people attended the open for-
um concerning the proposed
fraternity court which met in
the ballroom of the College
Union on Wednesday morning,
April 10.

The panel was composed of
Vernon Hunter, Dr. W. G. Me-
Gavock, and Mr. Grier Martin.

Dr. McGavock explained that
the proposed court had grown
out of the faculty and admini-
stration’s concern about the re-
lationship of the present fra-
ternity court to increased en-
rollment in the next few years.
In connection with this, he
stated that it appeared likely
that a new fraternity would be
invited to be established on
the campus next year, subject
to the approval of the Board of
Trustees at its May meeting.

OPEN FLOOR

Following a general explana-
tion of the work done by the
committee appointed to study
the fraternity -court possibility,
the floor was opened for ques-
tions. Below is an account of
the questions and answers
which were forthcoming:

Maurice Ritchie: “What will
be the rent on single houses,”

Answer: It will be $168 per
month for a single house with-
out a basement. The rent for a
single unit with a basement will
be $200. This will inevitably
raise monthly dues. The cost of
belonging to a fraternity at Da-
vidson is probably lower than
at any other ‘reputable college
in America.

Hank Davis: “Will the fra-
ternities be able to utilize their
present equipment?”

Answer: Every fraternity will
be responsible for furnishing
its own equipment and furnish-

ings.

Creighton Peden: “Can a fra-
ternity remain outside of this
court?”

Answer: The college recog-
nizes that some groups have
previous commitments which
bind them. Such commitments
were made with no knowledge
of the possibility of this pro-
posal arising. Such a group
would be required to come into
the court as soon as these obli-
gations shall have been met.

Creighton Peden: “At $200
a month rent per fraternity,
the initial cost of the court will
eventually be mét. What will
be the arrangement about rent
then?”

ENDOWMENT PROVIDES

Answer: The money for con-
structing the court will have
to come from _ endowment
funds. We have a nine million

William 5. Murphy

vides $400 per student each
year. Any money which is used
from this fund would have to
be replaced. Expenses will not
end when the construction has
been completed. There will be
a large maintenance expense.
The rent will continue as long
as the college owns the houses.
Tom Morgan: “If the fraterni-
ties raised $100,000, would this
reduce the monthly rent?”
Answer: Yes indeed, but it
requires a great deal of work
to raise this amount of money.

QUOTA QUESTION

Bill Duke: “Shouldn't there
be a membership quota?’ Isn't
it possible that the rent would
be too high for a small frae
ternity?”

Answer: For the faculty and
administration to set this would
be very objectionable, but if
the students wish to originate
such a plan, there may be merit
in it.

tion perhaps be answered by re-

hearing of his election, Chapin
expressed his appreciation for
the opportunity to be of ser-
vice to the Y and to the Col-
lege.

This year Chapin was chair-
man of the Effective Cifizen-
ship post on the Y Cabinet. His
job entailed planning a num-

shows.

Faculty Reproaches
Vespers Conduct

Conduct of the student body
at Vespers last Sunday evening
evoked much discussion at Mon-
day’s Faculty meeting.

The group adopted a resolu-
tion expressing its ‘‘disappoint-
ment that such an_ incident
should ‘occur at Vespers and
especially at a communion ser-
vice," and its “hope that it
would not happen again in the
future.”
