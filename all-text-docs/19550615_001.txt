STARS IN OUR CROWN
by Louella 0. Linker

The summer social session at the
local college is underway, and my husband
reports that the night life and afternoon
card games have been greatly enlivened
by the presence of several charming young
Coreds

A certain MISS SARAH ADAMS brings a
long line of red lights with only a few
green ones in the distance. The Gentlee
men at the College don't think she learned
her variation on the North Carolina Hop
in Mill Town, Ne Ce

Our own little tow:.ship is making
two female contributions to the academic
life, and it is hoped that this relation-
ship shall be extended to a social one.
MISS MARY BEATY is fresh from her second
year at Agnes Scott.

Then there is our local high school
graduate, MISS PATTY KIMBROUCH. Her name
and figure are familiar to local residents.
The young Gentlemen would like to see
more of Patty about the campus (for she
will be at Salem next fall) than a brief
red flash on the way to class.

MISS LYNN PALMiR is planning to go
to Saint Mary's in her new home town of
our state capitol. Her former residence
of New Orleans has endowed her with much
Storyville spice. I fear there is going
to be a lot of competition between the
State boys and our Gentlemen in the fall.

My husband tells me that there is
a very attractive Co-ed commuting from
Charlotte, MISS BECKY DEAL. She is
blissfully pinned to a former Davidsonian,
but personally I would prefer to have my
bliss a little closer than Emory Medical
School.

Well, to each his own, and I still
have my Cop.

JHBPHEHHER RHEE SE REB ER HAEH EERE

YOUR COLLEGE UNION
by Joe Collese

All of us are aware of the weekly
Wednesday interludes and the weekend movies
sponsored by the College Union, but there
are many services which you may enjoy al-
most any day of the hour or minute.

For those wih an ear for music we
have all kinds, sreeds, and sized of records
which may be checked out and taken to the
wiusic Room, In thi.s second floor "rendeaeq
vous you will fine soft couches and a High-
Fidelity phonograph.

The music Lover's cubby--hole is located
in the center of the building, and although
it has a large plat- glass window overiooke-
ing the spacious ballroom, it does not have
an air conditioning unit. Until Mr. Smith
can find one in his bag of magic we suggest
that you ask the desk attendant to turn on
the fan therein.

Available in the Union lounge is a
vast variety of periodicals, newspapers,
and books. For the time being (until we
refrain from taking them to our rooms) the
new copy of magazines must be checked out
at the desk, There is a score of art folios
by such masters as Van Gogh, Rembrandt, and
Degas which may be taken out and observed
until your aesthetic heart is content.

If you are bored, and television doesn't

bore you, we might suggest that you slip into
the Television Room.

There are many forms of entertainment
which can be created in the Union Ball Room,
You might play the "Missouri-Waltz" on that
beautiful baby grand or get up a foursome
for bridge. For a change of scenery you
could venture out orto the patio for a game
of shuffle board. ;

And, if you in~ist on paying for your
fun by the minute, you have the possibility
of billiards or ping pong.
