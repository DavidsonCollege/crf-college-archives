“IT would be much happier if
one would simply inform the
(prospective faculty member)
of what the history of. the
college is, what its basic
purposes are, what ite com-
mitments ere—and then to
ask that person whether he
can live in harmony with these
and commitments.”

Prospective faculty mem-
bers receive a packet of infor-
mation before they arrive on
campus for interviews. A copy
of the constitution is included
in this packet, so every pros-
pective will see the By-Law
that states that Davidson
welcomes Christians and non-
Christians.

Sailors hope to sweep match

Sailing is a sport that is
very accomodating to the Da-
vidson student. It is a rather
unique form of intercollegiate
competition since there are no
mandatory practices.

' The sport is run mainly by
students who spend as much
time as they think they can
afford. It is not unusual for
academics and other interests
to take priority over sailing.

Coach Hallam Walker sta-
ted that many students turn
out for the first few practices
every year but the team is
“quickly reduced to a nucleus

information? If not, who tells
a non-Christian candidate that
the President will likely be
very interested in his ‘religious
faith and practice’?”’

If a department invites a

‘non-Christian for interviews,

will the chairman of the de-
partment have to take the
condidate aside to. say:‘Look,
I know the By-laws say we
welcome everyone, but there's
this thing called the “enacting
statement,” and since you're
non-Christian, the President
will probably want to
know...’

Clearly this situation hints
of dishonesty and unprofes-
sionalism, and doubtlessly it
will lead to misunderstanding,
misinterpretation, and per-
haps another controversy
like last spring’s Linden affair.

Impact outside Davidson
Rice believes that word of
the enacting statement will

spread in the academic world,
damaging Davidson’s reputa-

‘tion and hindering the col-

lege’s ability to recruit highly
qualified faculty members.

‘I can certainly see the
difficulties put in. the way of
recruitment of faculty by dir-
ectors of graduate studies at

of about eight people."

This year's ‘‘nucleus"’ in-
cludes Captain David Love
who is a senior, juniors Alice
White and Laura Bingaman,
sophomores Jeff Harris, Ned
Grier, and Greg Londerey,
and freshman Mott Blair.

The fact that sailing is
strictly a volunteer sport may
be responsible for the team's
poor start this season.

The sailing team placed fifth
in the first of three ‘“‘point"’
regattas to be held this fall in
the Northern Division of the
South Atlantic Intercollegiate
Sailing Association (SAISA).

Other members of the divi-
sion are Duke, UNC-CH, N.C.

universities from which we like

very well discourage their

Why the enacting statement?

Why did the Trustees emas-
culate the By-Law with the
enacting clause? Could it be
that they fear a trend toward
secularization that threatens

to spoil Davidson's unique

character and enfeeble the
strength of the Christian per-
spective at the college?

Each time the Trustees
arrive on campus they witness
a Davidson much changed
since bygone days.

They see a jean-clad, coed-
ucational student body drink-
ing beer in the 900 Room,
watching ‘The Clockwork Or-
ange’ in Love Auditorium,
enjoying unlimited visiting
hours in dormitories—it is
indeed a strange world to
them.

Do they believe that these
liberalizing influences have
somehow eroded the Christian
perspective of Davidson?

“T would guess that David-
son is just as Christian now as_
it ever was,’’ submits May-
dole.

State, Univ. of Virginia,
Christopher Newport College,
and Old Dominion, who was
the winner of the first regatta
which was held at Lake Nor-
man,

The scores of the three
“point’’ regattas will decide
‘the top four teams in the
division who will go onto the
SAISA championship.

Although Davidson usually
goes on to the finals, accord-
ing to Walker, the team is
having its ‘‘ups and downs”
and willtjave to improve in
this weekend's regatta at UVa
if it hopes to participate in
post-season competition.

The regattas are standard
yacht races which are run over
a one-mile triangular course
forcing the boats to sail at
different angles to the wind.

The two-man crews attempt
to outsail their opponents by
utilizing the changing winds
to the fullest: ~

Walker encourages all who
have an interest in this exci-
ting sport to come out to one
of the practices.which are held
in the afternoons at Lake
Norman. ee,

‘Just because people were
required to go to chapel so
many times a week, and just
because people were forbidden

to drink beer on campus or ~

just because people were re-
quired to wear a coat and tie to
class—does that mean that

the college was any more

Christian than it is now?

“Are these things really the
essence of what we me*u by
Christianity? These are more,
I think, a reflection of social
conditions than they are of
Christian commitment,” said
Maydole.

Rice objects to the notior.
that hiring of non-Christians?
will lead to secularization.

Rice charges that this fear is
unwarranted. ‘‘I find it very
possible for a church-related
college tu have a pluralistic
community within its teaching
faculty and staff and not have
the pluralism threaten the
basic Christian nature of the
place.

““My own alma mater (Bos-
ton College) is a Catholic
college with a strong Jesuit
tradition. Yet within that
faculty are men and women
who are not Catholic who
function as full members of
that community and in fact
enhance the overall effective-
ness of the Jesuit mission by
their very presence.’’

Siege mentality

tlements around Davidson’s

~ odious enacting statement and
dismiss for all time this siege
mentality and invite the view-
points of non-Christians.

In Rice’s words: ‘“‘It is
important to recognize that

‘Christianity--or any belief--is

strengthened by dialogue, dis-
cussion, and confrontation...
It is a much healthier environ-
ment when beliefs are dis-
cussed, analyzed, challenged,
and reaffirmed.

Talking to ourselves

I too welcome dialogue,
discussion, and confrontation
of spiritual beliefs. And I too
believed that Davidson cham-
pioned those values. I fully
understand the Trustees’ de-
sire to preserve Davidson as a

Strong advocate fo the Chris-

tian perspective in the ongoing
exchange of spiritual dialogue.
but if the college follows its
present course, it may soon be
talking only to itself.

Teams experience
wild & woolly week

By KEVIN ROBBINS

After a week's absence due
to. an outdated shameful
sham, your Clubs Sports Spot
is back on top spitting those
sports spots to you as before.

A new Club Sport was
launched last Saturday as the
Water Polo Club dove into
competition against a strong,
experienced Appalachian
State team. Although the
Apps floated away with an
11-4 win, Davidson was no
fish out of water as they
splashed well in their first
outing.

With John Frederick and
Dave Lennox at the helm and

an offense spearheaded by
Mighty Mark Tommerdahl,
the Liquid Clubbers should
soon start sinking eee op-
position. ~

The addition of swim team
captains Jonathan Washburn
and Mike Knowles to the Club
should help liquidate the
same, if Knowles would con-
centrate on his swimming
instead of his.creative writing.
Cathy says you're all wet
anyway, Mike.

The Football Club Cats
slithered and slipped to a
liquid loss also as snow and
Western Carolina avalanched
their guests 17-14.

Life is nothing until you've
tried to play a game, even
football, in the snow on lousy
Astroturf. Rain is about all
that Davidson can handle.

A couple of tough breaks for
Western Carolina led to scores
that stood up under the awful
conditions.

The Club Gridders hope to
up their record next week
against (get this) Baptist Uni-
versity of America in Atlanta,
a newly formed varsity team.
