While most.of the festivities
for the Homecoming were cen-
tered around Richardson Field, the
rugby team was taking on Wash-

RUGBY

ington & Lee on the intramural
fields.

In sloppy weather, the Wild-
cats fell 10-6.

It was the fourth game of slip-
ping and sliding in ankle deep
puddles for the backs and rucking
over mud for the forwards. And
like the other games, the condi-
tions forced both: teams to alter
offensive strategies and rely on
tough defense.

Said defender Chris Smith:
“We had to go out there, hit hard
and wrap up any sucker who gets
the ball. For the most part, we did
that well ... I heard some bones
crack.”

It was a breakdown in the
Wildcats defense, however, that
gave the Generals their first try
shortly after the beginning of the
game. The wing slipped by
Davidson’s backs, faked a pass to

slips, falls in mud to W&L

the left and placed the ball down in
the far corner.

Their second try came ina |

similar fashion.

In the last 10 minutes of the
first half, Davidson sped up the
tempo and kept the ball on the
Generals’ side of the field. For-
wards Jonathan Sipling, Roger
Mills, and Mike Ingram seemed to
make every ruck, and backs Seth

Clippard, Garret DePiper, andBen ~

Hill ran hard toward the try zone.
.  Butit was freshman standout
Matt Burckhardt who kicked the
two penalties worth three points
each, leading to a 10-6 halftime
score.

The halftime festivities were
canceled because of the poor field
conditions. Fans stayed around,
hoping that the second half would

provide enough excitement. One: |.”

fan was overheard to say, “The
first half was great because the
players slipped and slid in and out
of puddles. It looked kind of fun.”
Neither team was able to score
in the second half, but both had
good chances. The Wildcats con-
trolled the ball in the last 15 min-
utes and had ample chances to win
the game with a five-point try.
“We played all out in the end,”
Tom Shelburne said. “We deserved
a try and a Homecoming win.”

Davidson will take its frustra-

weekend and hopes to take it out

Women’s tennis back on the court

Davidson’s women’s tennis
team is back.

WOMEN’S TENNIS

Sporting a roster that includes
nine zealous freshmen and eight
returning upperclassmen, this
year’s lineup looks fairly formi-
dable.

Coach Caroline Price has al-
ready tested the depth of her team
in two tournaments this fall: the
James Madison Invitational and
the Virginia Tech Invitational. On
both occasions, the Wildcats made
impressive appearances.

At James Madison, in the first

of three fall tennis tournaments,
freshman Clara Marks marched
through the competition at No. 6
singles, beating James Madison’s
Jamie Marlow 6-3, 6-4 in the fi-
nals.

Also, sophomore Creecy
Chandler and senior Jane Stubbs
advanced to the finals of their
singles draws and finished the tour-
nament in second place.

The last Davidson match of
the tournament was at No. 4
doubles, featuring Lindsay Cohen
and Kirstyn Leuner, who fell to
Penn State and settled for second
place.

Davidson’s more recent ex-
cursion was to Virginia Tech in a
tournament that included eight
singles and four doubles flights,
just as the James Madison tourna-
ment. Singles matches were best
two-of-three sets, while doubles

were eight game pro-sets.

Sophomore Ashley Maner
represented the Wildcats at No. 1
singles. After being knocked out
of the main draw by the eventual
winner from the Hokies, Maner
proceeded to do some knocking
out of her own, winning the conso-
lation draw 6-0, 6-2 over Marshall’s
top player. Marks ran though the
consolation draw also and finished
fifth.

Lynne Shore and freshman
Dana Casner inflicted enough dam-
age to finish third in their singles
flights. =
With her only loss coming in
the second round to Virginia Tech,
Casner won 6-4, 6-0 in her final
match. Shore, at No. 5 singles, was
beaten in the semifinals before
winning 6-3, 6-3 in her last match.

At No.7, Chandler and Cohen
were both entered in the same draw,

Golfers

By Joun RoE

Golf coach Joe Mark did not
believe his team could break the
300 mark during one of his team’s
rounds this season. In fact, he was

so confident with his prediction
that he promised to shave his head
if the golfers accomplished that
feat. Recently, the clippers were

making

brought out, and, now, Mark can
be seen around campus sporting a
hat.

The team broke 300 on the
first day of the Musgrove Hill Tour-
nament, coming in at 298.

“This was by far one of our
best tournaments, and I was very
pleased with our consistent play,”
Mark said.

The golfers wrapped up the
second day of the tournament with
a 322 for an impressive combined
two-day total of 620. Cabell Fisher
lead the team with a 152, followed
by Jason Lina and David
Alexander, who shot 156 and 157,

the cut

respectively. The team finished
10th in a very competitive field. |

On October 2 and 3, the squad
had another impressive showing at
Campbell. The Wildcats finished
at 626, placing in front of Southern
Conference foes Western Carolina
and The Citadel.

With three tournaments left
this fall, the squad has time to

“improve on their already impres-

sive season. The Wildcats head to
Radford next, then hosts a tourna-
ment at River Run Country Club
November 6-7. They wrap up the
fall season November 13-14 at
Charleston Southern.

raising the possibility of a Davidson
face-off. The possibility was real-
ized ina playoff for third and fourth
places. It was the second time in
two tournaments that the two have
run into each other, and Chandler
ran her record to 2-0.

Three freshmen, Amber
Bradford, Claire Cheatwood, and
Kirstyn Leuner, took second place
in their singles flights. Bradford
barely missed the winner’s plaque,
falling 6-2, 3-6, 6-7 to a Tennes-
see-Chattanooga player.

With three of the four doubles
teams featuring new pairings, the

competition yielded positive re-
sults in intense matches.

The. one experienced team,
Shore and Chandler, lost only seven
games in their first two matches,
before falling to James Madison in
the final.

The No. 2 team of Casner and
Bradford also lost in the finals to
James Madison, but the No. 1 and
No. 3 teams struggled some.

With this recent success, the
Wildcats are preparing and look-
ing forward to their next tourna-
ment, which will be held here on
Parents’ Weekend.
