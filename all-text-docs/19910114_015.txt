‘A talented Appalachian State
team came to Belk Arena last Tues-
day with a win over a fine UNCC
squad under its belt, perhaps ex-
pecting a blowout of the type they
delivered to the Wildcats a year
ago.

Up by just a point at the half
last year in Boone, the Mountain-
eers enacted a massive run that
spurred them toan 88-59 win. What
a difference a year can make.

In what was, without question,
the finest performance by a
Davidson team in recent memory,
the ‘Cats thoroughly dismantled
the Mountaineers in a-72-60 vic-
tory that wasn’t even that close.

Taking their initial lead at the’

13:40 mark of the first half on a
driving hoop by Detlef Musch, the
Wildcats never looked back, sprint-
ing to a 39-31 halftime edge.

’ Briefly challenged when ASU
scored the first six points of the
second half to close ‘to 39-37,
Davidson responded with an 18-4
spurt to put the game out of reach.

It was a brilliant effort on both
ends of the floor that gained the
victory, by farthe pinnacle of coach
Bob -McKillop’s tenure at

standing, coach Bob McKillop. was
justifiably pleased with his team’s
gutty effort. During the first half,
the Wildcats gave Coastal a clinic
in controlling the tempo of the
game.

Using most of the shot clock
on~nearly every possession, the
“Cats dominated the visibly shaken
Chants enroute toa 26-21 halftime
lead.

Coastal Carolina regained its
confidence in the second half; and
the shots simply would not fall for
Davidson, but McKillop’s charges
never ceased scrapping. In McKil-

lop’s words, “We grew up a lot . 5

tonight.” The ‘Cats received an-
other fine performance from Detlef
Musch. Musch was a bona fide
intimidator in the paint, scoring 10
points, gathering 8 caroms,; and
blocking 4 shots in thoroughly
outplaying the Chants’ uwayne
Cheatam.

merman poured in 25 points to |

They return to Belk Arena to face
