WRITES ARTICLE

“Christian Observer” Prints Pro-
fessors Discussion, ‘‘Pulpit
Pronunc id

Dr. “Edwin F. Shewmake, Davidson
professor of English, recently had pub-
lished in The Christian Observer an ar-
ticle on the subject of “Pulpit Pronuncia-
tion.”

Dr. Shewmake says in this article that
it is not the large points, such as wrong
accent and departures from the authori-
tative pronunciation heard in the speech
of the uneducated and careless, but the
lack of “those niceties of speech which
distinguish really beautiful oral expres-
sion from that which is merely under-
standable and not grossly inaccurate.”

Dr. Shewmake does not want an arti-
ficially precise English, as he says that
it is far from pleasing to hear a speaker
give “e”
as ‘kindness’ and ‘subject’.”

its “full value in such words

The article then discusses the effects
for good and bad of the section of the
country on a pronunciation.
The author commends many Southern
ministers on their pronunciation of “u”
such as in “duke” and “tune,” but he
censured them for their pronunciation
“bird” and “term.” He says that
these are often pronounced “boid” and
“toim.”

minister’s

of

The professor states, too, that more
objectionable than these errors is the
pronunciation of the “e” in “pen,” “ten,”
and “fen” like the “i” in “pin,” “tin,”
and “fin.”

The article also points out many errors

that are often made, such as saying

that to be very effective, the study of
phonetics should be followed by inten-

until right habits of pronunciation have
become firmly established.

mit Unfavorable Decision
To Nesbit

The sixty-sixth stated session of Kings
Mountain Presbytery .met in the Bel-
mont) Presbyterian Church Saturday,
April 20, for its regular business trans-
aftions. Among the topics discussed was
adyfsability of dancing on the Da-
vidson College campus.

the

The Presbytery went &ni record as
opposing, in any form, dancing at Da-
vidson. This decision was made in an-
swer to a letter from Dr. C. R. Nesbit,
chairman of the committee appointed by
the college board of trustees to cémider
petitions recently presented to the board
by various student groups, for an opin-
ion.

Final vote on the question was taken
after a spirjted and lengthy discussion of
@ore than an hour. Several other items
were considered, but this is the one most
concerned with student  inter-
est.

Members of the committee are at-
tempting to secure the opinion of each
of the governing this
matter. So far the decision of only two
have been made public.
