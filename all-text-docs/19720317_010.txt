number of ping-pong and pool
tables would be made available
to the student body.

Current plans for such recrea-
tion provide for only one ping-
pong table to be set up in the
Guest House.

With the passing of Corlew’s
resolution, the Senate took it up-
on itself to locate as many ping-
pong and pool tables as possible
and to set them up in the Sla-
ter houses on Patterson Court,
the basement of the gym, the
basement of Belk Dormitory
and if possible, the basement of
Richardson Dormitory.

Also this week, in a report hy
Junior Senator Bill Meier on the
campus security situation, it
was pointed out that, other than
merely encouraging the Admin-
istration to improve campus se-
curity, there is actually very
little that can be done at this
point to improve the situation
other than to alert students to
the problem and to urge the
coeds to walk in pairs at night.

Meier said that in meetings
with Administrators and with
Director of Physical Plant Gro-
ver Meetze, the few suggestions
for strengthening security, in-
cluding a larger campus force,
more extensive lighting and
even the issuance of mace to
the coeds proved to be infeas-
ible at this time. ‘It looks as
though we're just going to have

to wait until next fall before we
get any real action,” Meier said.

This week the Senate also
gave time to former SGA Pres-
ident Danny Clodfelter for a
presentation concerning a new
student lobbying organization
known as the National Student
Lobby (NSL).

Clodfelter gave a brief his-
tory of the organization which
was conceived in the California

university system, pointing out
its past effectiveness in state
governments all over the coun-
try and in Washington in lobby-
ing for allowances beneficial to
students directly.

According to Clodfelter, NSL
Was in many states instrumental
in attaining the 18-year-old vote
and often has pushed, with much
success, for such allotments of
funds as education bills provid-
ing tuition money for would-be
college students in need of the
aid,

Unlike organizations such as
National Student Association
(NSA), NSL is legally entitled

Self-Selection Delayed

As Terry Blasts Club Violation

By TOM AINSWORTH
News Editor

Despite a last-minute _ post-
ponement due to certain ‘‘viola-
ticns” in procedure, the choos-
ing of eating clubs by the Fresh-
man Class was effected Wednes-
day night.

Self-Selection, which was to
have taken place on Tuesday,
March 14, was delayed for one
day when it was discovered that
one of the Patterson Court Fra-
temities had been guilty of a
breach in the regulations.

Bruce Snyder, a spokesman
for the Student Life Committee,
although declining to name the
House involved, did enumerate
cn the offense.

Every house on the Court was
cbligated to turn in to Dean of
Students Will Terry a list of
the number of vacancies each
had for Self-selection purposes.

The House in question gave a
number of bids to members of
the Freshman Class over the
Fall and Winter terms, a num-
ber of which were accepted.

The house then proceeded to
inform ‘Terry that they had
revised their list of opehings to
match the number of freshmen
whom they had already enlist-

to lobbying privileges due to its
tax status and it exercises this
privilege through a_ full-time
staff of professional lobbyists.

The Senate was receptive to
Clodfelter’s presentation and a
possible membership to NSL
but decided to table the issue
until further information could
be heard.

Clodfelter was much impress-
ed with the concept of NSL and
urged the Senate to look into
the matter, giving it proper
consideration. ‘Student political
power can be effective if exer-
cised through the proper chan-
nels,’ he said.

ed, while encouraging the latter
to discourage any of their class-
mates in selecting the house.

This action was therefore
thought to be in vielation of the
Social System process by sev-
eral people involved in the or-
ganization.

“Even though there are no
hard and fast rules governing
Fraternity Court rushing, they
did violate the general intent
of it,” said Snyder.

Snyder went cn to say that
discrimination of this type might
endanger the house's relations
with the Student Life Commit-
tee, which gives the eating clubs
their residences on a year to
year basis.

At a meeting with the repre-
sentatives of the said house, on
Wednesday morning Terry read
a directive expressings the feel-
ings of the members of the So-
cial System Council as well as
his personal views on the mat-
ter:

“The principle upon which the
Social System is based is on
equal opportunity for every stu-
dent on Patterson Court. I be-
lieve everyone understands this,
certainly every upperclassman
understands it and the leaders
of every fraternity and eating
club do.

“The violation which was re-
ported was contrary to the letter
and the spirit of that principal
(1 strongly suspect that there
may have been other indescre-
tions but we have not been
able to ‘prove’ them.), so self

selection was postponed until
the matter could be discussed
with the offending parties in
question.

“IT am sorry for the incon-
venience caused to the other
groups, but it helps to illustrate
the necessity of cooperation
from all groups on the court
for the mutual benefit of all.

“To be a little more philo-
sophical about the matter, it is
strange how some _ individuals
must feel superior to others and
how they must, in subtle or blat-
ant ways, laud it over their fel-
lows.

**Many people feel insecure if
they are not on the inside of a
secret or a group. It plagues
Davidson from the Court to the
Hill. It is at the root of most of
our problems in building the
community.

‘Back to the incident at hand. -
It looks like this kind of prac-
tice is going to necessitate more
iron-clad rules enforced by the
Patterson Court Council.

“Perhaps the whole issue is
that the change in the Social
System was not radical enough.”

In regard to Wednesday night’s
proceedings, 211 freshmen self-
selected with most receiving
their first choice selections. Phi
Delta Theta and PAX houses
were filled up first, registering
37 and 26 freshmen respective-
ly, the Phi Delts getting the
most freshmen of all the houses.
Emmanon got the fewest with
culy nine freshmen selecting
their house.
