For many of the members of the admin-

all news items in chapel there will arise an-
other question. How will«they be able to

ing event without the usual wait of
By this statement we do not mean that it al-
ways takes a week for an article to get into
print, but that there is a necessity to wait
from one issue of THE DAVIDSONTAN to
the next. Naturally this difficulty wil] not
inconvenience all those who have news items
to release through THE DAVIDSONIAN,
but it will affect drastically those who are
not able to present their material for an issue

their announcement brought to the attention
‘of the student body before the publishing
date of the next edition, The following ex-
ample will probably serve to explain this
situation better than a detailed discussion:
Suppose that the YMCA needed a group of
men for a deputation similar to the recent
one to Greensboro. If they did not learn of
this need until THE DAVIDSONIAN for one

available before the next issue reached the
students, they would be forced to resort to
the age-old system of chapel announcement,
In spite of the fact that the YMCA has evi-
deneced a desire to conduct their publicity
am through THE DAVIDSONIAN,
they would still be forced to employ some
other means in such instances as this purely
because the paper was being printed at the
wrong time to suit theirpurposes.

prog

The problem of the college paper’s not
appearing often enough or at more Oppor-
tune times as outlined above can be solved.
The solution of this problem would entail an
increase in the amount of work that the staff
of THE DAVIDSONIAN would have to do.
All of us are aware that the staff is sorely
pressed. at times to complete the work which
it already has, and it might Sé¢m to many
that any inerease in effort necessary on the
part of staff members would be the prover-
bial ‘‘straw that broke the camel’s back.”
However, if THE DAVIDSONIAN could be-
come a livelier paper it would probably com-
mand the interest of the staff members suf-
ficiently to keep a larger group of men
working regularly instead of intermittently.
The solution which we wish to propose is
this: That TITE DAVIDSONIAN be printed
twice during each week instead of once as
at present. In a paper which appears twice
weekly many more rush items could be
carried. This facility in printing rush articles
would not only make it possible to carry
more announcements for the student body,
it would also tend to make the regular news
stories more up to date.

Naturally a change of this nature in the
number of papers a week would necessitate
a decrease in size, But this decrease in size
would be justified by the inerease in news
value of the majority of the articles printed.
In addition to giving us better news service,
a change in size of THE DAVIDSONIAN
would make it possible to retain all our

features could be earried in the earlier edi-
tion and the remaining ones in the lafer one.

features on a weekly basis,

A news service of the type we could main-
tain with a small decrease in size would be
especially desirable in the sports division.
To many of us news of athletie events is of

primary importance, but under the present

system of publication it is just as hard for
thessports editor to keep his news
alive as it is for the other members of the
editorial staff. The result is that much of the
sports news falls into the Same class with a
large part of the front page news and is
stale by the time THE, DAVIDSONIAN is
placed in the post office. With a ‘‘semi-
weekly”? paper, members of the student body
who have been unable to attend athletic
events would be able to receive reports of
them much sooner.

this proposal for a change in the publication

number of men will give a small amount of

Alenda Lux...

By BOBBY PHILLIPS

Ever since the termination of
the war and the subsequent influx
of students to our campus in num-
bers approaching the super-satura-
tion point, there have been con-
tinued arguments pro and con con-
cerning the permanent expansion
of the Davidson student body above
the established norm of six to seven
hundred persons. In bringing the
vital issue to print, this colunin
will forthwith (by request or co-
ercion from none) state a plea for
the maintenance of a small student
body, while trying nevertheless to
present both sides of the picture
fairly, Admittedly, there is an in-
herent prejudice among many of
us against change of anything in
any form; we want Davidson to be
always, with minor reservations,
the Davidson of which we were a
part and which we grew to love in
four (or more) years. But, in plead-
ing for a small Davidson, we have
much more than complacent senti-
mentality upon which to base our
arguments, ,

Some maintain that Davidson
cannot keep step with comparable
(but expanding) institutions unless

r)

we too increase permanently the size
of our student body; in other words,
uthat we must keep up, with the
crowd.” Davidson is what she is
today because of a refusal to com-
promise her ideals and her institu-
for the sake of being “in

tions
style.
Davidson College's most attrac-
assets have been and un-
doubtedly will continue to be her
“intangibles; the relationship be-
tween the student and professor,
the familiarity of each student with
fellows, the campus courtesy,
religious atmosphere, and the

cannot exist in the desired propor-
tions in a large student body.
Approaching now along the
practical lines, we must note first
that Davidson is not a rich school
and (barring discovery of gold in
‘the, “excavation for the new gym)
she fas no visible prospects of
coming opulence. To accommodate
a student body of twelve hundred
students or more the physical plant
of the college would have to under-
go stupendous expansion and modi-
fication. The science building
would become inadequate, the li-
brary would be come inadequate,
Chambers auditorium would over-
flow, and the dormitories now
standing would house comfortably
about half the student body. Every-
one concerned with Davidson Col-
lege today is aware that she must
spend enormous sums in the near
future, not for expansion, but just

for the facilities needed by her
small student body and small
faculty.

Some proponents of expansion
counter our every argument with,
‘‘We are agreed, on the point that
Davidson has something whole-
some to offer youth which they
cannot find elsewhere; is it not
then our very duty to offer that
good to more students?” It would
indeed be wonderful: if Davidson
College could expose to her in-
fluence each year twelve hundred,
or two thousand, or ten thousand,
or all college students; that we ac-
cord would be ideal, but unfor-
tunately, in expanding, Davidson
‘would surely become another part
of “elsewhere.”

There is something to be learned
from the ageless aphorism of the
Chinese fisherman: “If you run
narrow channels, build boat small,
If you build boat small, keep crew

small.”

known to have been fond of
dancing (that is until Robert con-

‘Davidson was at one time looked
upon as a crime,of no small serious-
ness, “

There are records of students
being punished for dancing. For
instance, here is an incident re-
ported in the session record of the
college church sometime in 1838,
This incident occurred less than a
year after, the college opened;

*“\ report having gained credit
about Christmas of 1838, A. O.,
one of our members (who was @
student here who later became a
minister and filled pastorates in the
southern cities) had taken
part with a company of
youths in dancing, the session held
an interview with him in which he
acknowledged the ‘crime,’ and p10-
fessed in a satisfactory manner, a
fecling of regret and repentance.
His regular standing in the church
was therefore continued.” This boy
got off CAS yy

A young lady (presumably of
Davidson and probably the daugh-
ter of a professor) was reported to
have “taken part in the exercises of
fa dancing party,” afi the session
instructed the pastor to “duly ad-
monish her. In the minutes of the
session for the next meeting there
is a note to the effect that the young
lady had passed on, so you can see
that they really “admonisked” in
those days, and that to dance was
to risk not only soul, but life on
this good earth.

Actually, there was no prohibition

there was no acknowledged dancing
at the college until this present
century.

‘were, however,
dances, the favorite dance
being the auditorium of “Old
Chambers.” .At these dances the
partners were boys if a sufficiency
of girls was not available, though
students went as far as Winthrop
College to find young ladies for
these impromptu affairs. Of course
no chaperones were ever present
since the faculty punished those
found dancing on the campus.
Naturally, these dances were jolly
affairs, =

With the advent @f the automo-
bile, students began to go to Char-
lotte to dance, and though these
dances were attended only by
Davidson students, it was not until
the 1930s that such dances were
called Davidson College dances.

The final breakdown of college
resistance to dancing was the re-
sult of a ruling of the faculty in
1938, that square dancing, being
folk dancing, was permissible on
the campus. From this to plain old
dancing was presumably a short
step for all types of dancing is per-
mitted on the campus as of 1943,

As the result of that regulation,
the first dance held (officially, that
is) at Davidson College was on
February~ 9 and 10 in the high
school gymnasium. Ervin Hinkle
and his orchestra’ provided the
music. t

cent timely graduation enabled him

conducted herself through these

Cousin George, incidentally, is re-

Paging the Professors

By Stan

——— PROF,-REID-
At present Dr. Reid of the
Geography Department, is looking

forward to the graduate examina-
tions with much anticipation and
curiosity. He expects to find in the
results an objective, tangible
measure of the work of the David-
son student and to determine
whether or not Davidson lives up
to her fine scholastic reputation.

Prof, Reid, a native of Oklahoma,
is a Davidson graduate, having ma-
jored in geography and geology. He
took his master’s degree at Colum--
bia University and his Ph, D. at
Peabody College. In addition, Prot.
Reid has done graduate work at the
University of Chicago.

During the summers, Dr. Reid
frequently teaches at Columbia Uni-
versity, as he will do this year, He
has taught previotsly at the Uni-
versity of Arkansas, and at Teach-
ers Colleges in Oklahoma and
Texas.

Always interested in  wood-
working, Prof. Reid, during the
war, found it necessary to turn

PROF. BOYD

Dr. Boyd of the Bible Depart-
ment who came to Davidson last
fall, has been most impressed with
the student traditions and the spirit
in which the traditions are kept.

Dr. Boyd came to Davidson from
| Presbyterian College where he took
his A. B, and where he taught
from 1936. His years of teaching
there were. interrupted from 1943
to 1946 while he was a_ naval
chaplain with the Marine Corps in
the Pacific.

After graduating
where he was active in tennis,
fencing, and boxing, Prof. Boyd
went to Princeton Seminary for his
Ph, B, Later he took the doctorate
in. theology at Union Seminary.
Also Prof. Boyd earned his mas-
ter’s degree in English at Prince-
ton University. ~
C In addition to being interested in
athletics, Dr. Boyd enjoys raising
plants. He is also quite active in

outside speaking.

Think It Over

INFORMATION

The fact that last year most
voters knew very few candidates,
prompted* us last week to propose
a change in the method of conduct-
ing student elections. The main idea
was to use the most effective means
available to give us, as voters, a
knowledge of the persons for whom
we could vote, their qualifications
and ideas for school improvement,

It is very possible that no
amendment to the - Constitu-
tion would be necessary to
make this change. The Consti-
tution forbids campaigning,
solicitation of votes, organized
backing, or combines. It does
not forbid the issuance of equal
amounts of INFORMATION
about candidates in printed
form. The Board of Elections
could be the watchdog to en-
force absolute equality of space
and treatment, and to supervise
the gathering of this informa-

the candidates and other
sources. The board could also
supervise their publication

(probably through this news-
Paper) during-the day between
the nominating convention and
election day. The voter must
have facts upon which to base
his judgment.

The
speech

other proposal, a_ short
in chapel for each candi-
date would also contribute to more
intelligent voting,.but not so much
as the printed pictures, informa-
tion and statements, because a pa-
rade of new names and faces often
fails to stick. If these changes ‘re-
quire an amendment, lets vote on
one. If -not the Student Council
and Board of Elections can enact
*them.
