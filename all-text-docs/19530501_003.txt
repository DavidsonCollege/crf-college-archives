FRIDAY, MAY 1, 1953

Davidson is rerog-
nized as having an out-
standing plant for phy-
Sical development and
the college uses this
and the fact that the
intercollegiate Wild-
cats are members of
overpopulated South-
ern Conference as big
publicity points.

For a college its size
old Davidson does have
a tremendous athletic
layout and has at least
fair facilities for almost
every type of athletics.
The Wildcats partici-
pate in nine intercollegiate sports and there is organized in-
terfraternity play in seven different sports.

Along with these competitive sports there are the various
required physical education classes. These include three full
quarters of many varied activities such as basketball, swim-
ming, wrestling, modified football, badminton, tennis, soft-
ball, and others. .

The college owns some fifty-five acres of Mecklenburg
land and has plenty of room to spread out in its athletic ac-
tivities. However, the land itself is not enough. The ground
has to be cleared and smoothed and leveled to make it suitable
for use in athletics.

GYM LEAVES LITTLE TO BE DESIRED INDOORS

The two football fields, the tennis courts, and the base-
ball diamond are the only really improved outside athletic
facilities available on the campus. Of course, there is nothing
to be said about the fine facilities of the new modern Johnston
Gymnasium which is truly a fine athletic plant.

Looking around in the fall and in the spring when out-
door athletics are in vogue we can hardly find a spot on the
campus where some athletic team or interfraternity squad is
not engaged in some phase of sporting activity.

To say the least, the place is really crowded with the
facilities which we have this year. Just think what the situa-
tion will be next year when a new group of freshmen move in
to return freshman intercollegiate athletics.

With freshmen on separate teams from the varsity next
year the question will arise — where can they practice and
where can they play their home games with the varsity and the
Greeks already overcrowding the present spaces.

The major difficulties arising with football and baseball.
With the freshmen practicing down on the lower practice foot-
ball field that will force the varsity. to run its drills in the
stadium. This will not only take away.one of the intermural
football fields, but will, of course, put such a strain and a
pounding on the already thin Richardson Field turf that there
won’t be much left for the home games the 1954 Football
Wildcats will play here on the campus.

SPRING SPORTS ARE THE MOST CROWDED

Then in the spring the track squad will be taking up
the stadium and that leaves two baseball teams t6 play and
practice on the same baseball diamond. If the lower football
practice field were to be pressed into service as the freshmaii
baseball field, two of the intermural softball fields would go
by the board. ,

Over on the tennis courts we find the same situation
exactly. The minimum recommendation of most colleges and
universities around the nation is to have one tennis court for
every fifty students. That means that the local courts, which,
by the way, are some of the finest in the South, are still six
short of the very minimum requirement for adequate tennis
facilities.

Even this year with the interfraternity competition in
progress along with varsity tennis practice and matches, the
courts are full and therefore inaccessable to students who
just want to play for the fun of the game, except in the morn-
ings, when they are clogged by the overcrowded Physical
Education tennis classes, and on Saturday and Sunday after-
noons.

Here again there is the space, but no money to make
the necessary improvements. .

INTERMURAL FIELDS ARE POOR

The intermural fields, especially in softball, aren't even
level and in some cases, not even cleared of knee-high weeds.
However, earth moving and leveling which would be necessary

for any such improvements is very expensive and therefore at

NicKee’s Netters
Hit Miami Today
On Local Courts

By JIM HOLSHOUSER
Davidson's tennis squad took on the strong racquet forces
of the University of Miami, (Fla.) on the local courts this
afternoon. The Miamians were favorites in the match as they
sport one of the strongest teams in the south.

Coach McKee was expected to
send his regular lineup (Keesler,
Bremer, Dudley, Clark, Sneed, and
Bivins or Green) agairat the
powerful Florida team. Also the
regular doubles combinations were
expected to face the Miamians.

McKee was forced to shuffle the
doubles combinations last Tuesday
against Duke due to the illness of
Lacy Keesler. Johnny Bremer and
Leighton Green played the No. 1
doubles instead of the normal
Bremer-Keesler combination.

The Cats now hold a 10-7 won-
lost record and with only two
matches remaining in the regular
season after this afternoon's match
they are assured of at least an
even split with the opponents over
all the matches played this year.

However, the Cats are heavily
favored to down easily the two re-
maining teams, South Carolina and
Wofford. The Cats took both these
teams earlier in the season by 9-0
counts.

The Davidson tennis team, now
striving to have a winning season,
lost two “Big Five’ matches last
week by identical 7-2 scores. At
Chapel Hill last Saturday, North
Carolina whipped the Cats, as they
won their fifteenth successive
match. Del Sylvia and Company
won all the singles matches in
straight sets, with Davidson tak-
ing two of the doubles matches.

At Davidson Tuesday, the Cats
took it on the chin from Duke’s
Blue Devils. The Duke team took
five singles matches and two
doubles matches. In the feature
match of the afternoon, Lacy Kees-
ler defeated Duke’s ace, Norm
Schellenger. Keesler had to leave
sick bed in order to play the
match, but he turned in a brilliant
performance.

The Cats took the measure of
Washington and Lee’s Generals in
a 8-0 whitewash in Lexington last
Wednesday. Only two of the
doubles matches were completed. .

Only two matches remain on the
1953 Davidson schedule. Next
Thursday, the netters meet South
Carolina at Davidson, and then
they close out the season’s play at
Wofford on Saturday. On May .14,
15, and 16, the Cats will be host
team for the Southern Conference
Tournament.

GOLFERS TO FINISH
SEASON THIS WEEK
AT CHARLOTTE CLUB

By ‘BUCK REINHARDT

The fairways will be hot Mon-
day and Tuesday afternoons at the
Charlotte Country Club as the
Wildcats will tangle with the Clem-
son and Wofford linksters.

The Wildcat golfers met defeat
at the hands of the Tigers early
this season and will be out for re-
venge. However, they took an easy
victory from Wofford.

The Tigers have one of the
strongest teams in this “neck of
the woods,” and the Cats will have
to play their finest to topple the
fine play of the Clemson combina-
tion.

“The Upset Club”

The Cat golfers however, are
becoming known for their upsets.
Last week they stopped a strong
bunch of Gamecocks from South
Carolina University, who had
trounced them earlier in the season
by 15 points.

Larry Parrot was the big noise
in Davidson’s surprise win over
the Gamecocks and Larry will be
out for a repeat performance Mon-
day to lead the Wildcats to an-
other win and even the score with
the Tigers.

Parrot ‘Plays It Cool’

Larry is one of the coolest play-
ers the Cats have been able to put
on the greens for a long while
and with Larry in top form, getting
help from capable players like
Graeme Keith, Captain Lew Barnes,
Mickey Cannon, Tom Abel, and
Joe Jenkins, the Tigers will un-
doubtedly find themselves in for
a rough match.

The Davidson squad is expected
to repeat their easy Wofford win

KAs Lead In Softball
At Half-way Point:
Delis Lead. Tennis

By DON PILKENTON

The second full week of play
in the Inter-Fraternity softball
league finds the Kappa Alphas have
taken the lead away from the Sig
Eps.

The KAs are currently batting
1000. By the time this paper goes
to press the game between the Sig
Eps and the KAs' will have been
played. This game may possibly
decide the circuit winner.

The highly favored Sig Eps were
spilled from their perch last Tues-
day when an underdog Pika team
finally came out on top of a see-
saw battle with a final winning
score of 15-13.

The battles up to this point have
been, on the whole, contests of the
sluggers. In many games, however,
errors have played an important
role in the mounting scores. The
boys are eager to play ball and, no
doubt, the fumbles will diminish
more and more as the season rides
to completion.

Over in the tennis league, the
Phi Delta Thetas are still going
strong. Buford Price, undefeated
Phi Delt racket-man, was clipped,
6-4, by also undefeated Gene With-
erspoon of the Sig Eps. In spité of
this loss, however, the league lead-
ers went on to down the SPE team
and cop another win toward an
undefeated season.

These are the standings of the
tennis and softball leagues through
Wednesday’s games:

Wildcats of the Week:
Relayers Win Saturday
As Local Record Toppled

By JOHN HANDLEY

Last Saturday afternoon three teams pounded the local
cinders in the season's first triangular track meet for David-
son’s Wildcats. South Carolina’s Gamecocks and the Citadel’s
Bulldogs had traveled to the campus to join the Cats in what

iln Inter

promised to be a tight struggle.

All three had strong teams and
all three came on the track with
the idea of walking away with the
first place honors. The result —
one of the most outstanding track
shows ever staged on the local
cinders. The score — South Caro-

‘lina 50 — Davidson 53 — Citadel

51.

It was an exciting meet overall,
but no part was as thrilling as the
final event — the mile relay. The
score entering the relay stood 56-
50-48 (South Carolina, Citadel,
Davidson).

Pressure Wes On

The pressure was all on the Wild-
cat relay team. They must win to
beat Citadel, or at least take second
over the men in blue to even tie
the Bulldogs.

The preceeding week the South
Carolinians had run away with the
relay event, beating the Cats by
some 50 yards. To add to the pres-
sure, Bill Russell, regular relay
man, was forced to withdraw from
the race due to an upset stomach
after his mile run win.

At the last minute Frank Mitch-
ener, a dash man, who had never
run in a 440 event, stepped in to
take Russel’s place. The odds look-
ed too great.

Broke Local Record

The result — The four Cats, J.
V. “Horse” Howell, Bob Henry,
Frank Mitchener, and Bill Shipley,
put on Mercury's old mythical
winged feet and took off on a mile
jaunt which shattered the relay
record for the local cinders.

The new record (3:28.5) shaved

two seconds off the old one (3:30.5)
which was set against Clemson in
another thriller last year. The
Davidson team, however, beat even
their new local record at the con-
ference meet last year when they
took off on a 3:26.5 trip around the
Raleigh track.

Three of our Wildcats of the
Week figure prominently in Satur-
day’s split with their two oppo-
nents. Bob Henry, the jovial Wild-
cat captain from the hills of West
Virginia, placed second in the 880
event. The Sumner, Miss., gift to
Davidson track fortunes, Frank
Mitchener, took first in the hun-
dred and second in the 220. Bill
Shipley, the Asheville, N. C.,,
anchorman, took a second in the
440.

“Horse” Was Sick

“Horse” Howell had an off day
as a bad chest cold hampered his
usual performance in the 440. The
Mars Hill senior failed to place
in the one-lap event.

Henry and Howell are seniors
while Shipley is a junior and
Mitchener is only a sophomore.

Coach “Pete” Whittle had high
praises for his relayers and he dis-
closed that he plans to take them
to Durham to the Southern Con-
ference meet on the 15th and 16th
of this month. :

The pressure was un them —
they had to win and they didn’t let
their excited teammates down.
Howell, Henry, Mitchener, and
Shipley — Wildcats of the Week.

sectional Clash

By ANDY TURNER

Coach “Pete” Whittle’s tracksters will meet the Purple

Generals in a triangular meet on the local track tomorrow
afternoon. The meet will begin at the usual 1:30 P. M. for
the field events and 2:00 for the remaining events.

The Cats will be heavily favored
to take the measure of the two
teams and should push their won-
lost record to a healthy 5-3 count.

A Real Thriller

Last weekend, in one of the most
exciting meets seen on the local
track, the Cats were edged by
South Carolina 59-53 in a triangular
affair, with the Citadel whose team

. |finished third with 51 points. The

Gamecocks took first and second
in the pole vault giving them the
victory.

Davidson’s mile relay team of
J. V. Howell, Bob Henry, Frank
Mitchener, and Bill Shipley set a
new school record of 3:28.5, beat-
ing the old time of 3:30.5 set by
Davidson against Clemson last year.
Mitchener, a dash man, was a last
minute replacement for the ailing
Bill Russell.

Other Davidson firsts were taken
by Russell in the mile, Mitchener
in the 100, and Sparks and Feeney
(tie) in the 2 mile.

Ruskin Took Three Firsts

Ruskin of the Citadel was high
man for the meet with first in the
discus, short put, and the javelin
throw for fifteen points. Frank
Mitchener was high for the Wild-
cats with 942 points.

Furman and Washington and Lee
will come here with rather poor
records. Both schools restarted
track this year and are not too
strong. Furman has been beaten
badly by both Clemson and P.C.
and Citadel, while the Generals
were routed by both VMI and VPI.
Furman’s strength lies in Mathos
who runs the half mile, mile, and
two-mile.

Successful Season

Davidson, thus far, is enjoying a
successful season. Whittle’s boys
hold victories over Roanoke; Mer-
cer, and the Citadel. They have
bowed twice to South Carolina, one
of the strongest teams in the con-
ference, and lost to Clemson by
one point.

The Cats will be favored to take
this one with ease and will also be
favored against N. C. State next
week when they close out the sea-
son on the local track.

If the thinclads can take both
of these meets, they will finish
with the best record of any of the
other Davidson teams this year.

The Wildcat lineup for tomor-
row’s meet is as follows:

F Hurricane of Furman University and the Washington and Lee

100 yd. dash — Mitchener,
Koonce.
220 yd. dash -~ Mitchener,
Koonce.

440 yd. run — Shipley, Howell,
Alexander.

880 yd. run — Henry, Reed,
Gooding.

Mile run — Russell,
Gooding.

2 mile run — Sparks, Feeney,
Turner.

120 high hurdles — White, Robin-
son.

220 low hurdles — Morris, White,

WILDCATS COMPLETE
‘53 DIAMOND CARD
ON NEXT SATURDAY

Davidson’s luckless baseballers
go into the final stretch of the 1953
season Tuesday afternoon when
they meet South Carolina on their
home grounds. Ish Bennett is sched-
uled to pitch for the Cats, who
dropped a 7-1 decision to the Pal-
metto. team a few: weeks ago.

Johnny Smith was slated to do
the pitching chores this afternoon
against Furman, who also pasted
the Cats earlier in the season.

Finish Season At Home

Coach Chuck Clements’ team
finishes up the current season next
weckend on the Davidson diamond.
The Cats will play N. C. State a
return game Friday afternoon, with
Jimmy Smith set to handle the
mound duties. Wofford will be the
opponent for the season finale
Saturday afternoon.

In losing to South Carolina ear-
lier in the 53 campaign, Davidson
pitchers were touched for nine hits,
but only one of these was good for
an earned run. The Cats commit-
ed eight errors that afternoon to
hand the game to the S. C. team.
