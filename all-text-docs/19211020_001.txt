Dr. E. W. Sykes Speaks
‘On Peace With England

Coker President Makes Splendid
Address to Davidson Students.

At last Sunday’s “Y” service Dr. E. W.
Sykes, President of Coker College,
Hartsville, S. C.,, gave a very: interesting
and profitable lecture on the subject,
“One Hundred Years of Friendship Be-
tween the ‘United States and England.”
The lecture was well colored by touches
of humor and wit throughout.

After a few songs, prayer by Gus Sum-
mers, and the scripture reading, Matt. 5,
by Pat Crawford, Buchanan gave a beau-
tiful selection on the violin, accom-
panied by Purdy on the piano. The lec-
ture followed.

“The welfare of civilization,” stated
the speaker, “is wrapped up in the sub-
ject which we have under consideration
tonight.” “Taking up the settling of
America by the French, Spanish, and
English, a brief history of the American
people was given up until the present
time.

The Spanish came to America for con-
quest and gold with which to wage a
war on Protestantism in Europe, the
French came for trade, and the English
came for liberty and freedom. Each got
what they sought. The question natur-
ally arose as to which should rule. Hence
the French and Indian war was fought,
the outcome in 1759 being in favor of
the English.

In England, George II was succeeded
in. 1760 by George III. Influenced byshis
mother and Blackstone, he strove to be-
come an absolute king, but the English
*people, with their love of justice, would
not stand for taxation without represen-
tation. Seeing that his policy met with
great opposition from William Pitt and
others and that a conflict must ensue,
he shrewdly transferred it to America
by agitating the colonists, hoping to
bring the English people over to his side
by such action. .The Revolutionary war
followed. Fighting ceased in 1781. Terms
of peace were signed two years later,
chiefly through the instrumentality of
Benjamin Franklin, which gave to the
United States the land east of the Mis-
sissippi river and south of Canada. The
great English nation was broken in two
parts, but the two to forever remain ds
friends.

When Napoleon with his desire to rule
the world ascended the French throne
he set his eyes on the Spanish posses-

CHIMNEYS OF CHAMBERS ARE
RECEIVING OVERHAULING

The chimneys of Chambers are being
trimmed and remodeled, mirabile dictu!
The top of the venerable old domicile is
gradually assuming a more modern ap-
pearance. Weather will tell on even a
pile of bricks like those in Chambers,
and for several years past the tops of
the chimneys have been in all stages of
decay, which not only looked disreput-
able but was a source of great discom-
fort to those residing below.

However, for the last few days work-
men have been busy tearing down the
old tops and putting up new and better
ones. The chimneys now taper up at
the top instead of having an overhang,
which makes a neater and more efficient
smoke conductor.

D.

Mr. and Mrs. Fred McGill, mission-
aries to India, are receiving congratu-
lations upon the birth of a daughter,
who bears the name of Frances. Mrs:
McGill was Miss Pearl Johnston, a co-
ed in the class of ’o4.

Position at which Wildcats held Wake Forest for six downs one foot from goal line Saturday.

Wake Forest Is Victor
_ 10-7 In Great Contest

| Red and Black Held Opponents Six
| Times on One-Yard Line.

Wearn Field in Charlotte was the
| scene of a great battle Saturday be-
tween Davidson and Wake Forest, old
rivals, in which the latter forced the
Wildcats to take the short end of a 10-7
score. Although outweighed 10 pounds
a man in the line and 14 pounds in the
backfield, the Wildcats put up a classy
exhibition of football and until the final
whistle blew the outcome 6f the game
was in doubt. With less than two min-
utes to play Davidson received the ball
on its 10-yard line and by passes and
broken field running forced the pigskin
to the 30-yard line of their opponents,

Twice it seemed that Heckman, the
big-back who-played-such-a remarkable
game for Wake Forest, was on his way
to the goal line with no opposition be-
fore him, but each time the Wildcats
caught and threw him before he could
pass that last chalk mark.

In the third quarter Wake Forest ad-

Seniors Win From Juniors

And Lose To Freshmen

Pretty Fights Put Up in Class Bas-
ketball League Contests.

In a better game than the score would
indicate, the Juniors were finally forced
to yield to the Senior five by a score of
42 to 22, The game was exciting from
the very first and at the end of the first
half it was doubtful which team would
come out the winners. But at the start
of the second half the Seniors got the
jump on the Juniors and from then on
the latter were never able to overcome
the Seniors’ big lead.

There was much interest in the game,
and time after time the rooters for
each side cheered their favorites. Cap-
tain George Mauze was easily the star
for his’ fighting Junior five, while Or-
mond starred for the Seniors. The of-
ficial line-up follows:

Subs—Juniors: Covington for Brake;
Hunter for Covington. Seniors: Cornel-
son for Neal. Field goals: Houghton 5.
Ormond 7, Doubles 4, Freeman 7, Price
2, Mauze 2, Brake 1. Foul goals: 2 out
of 7; Mauze 6 out of 11. Referee: Coach
Hengeveld. Score keeper: E. H. Mauze.

Fresh-Senior Game.

The Freshmen defeated the strong Se-
nior basketball five Friday night by the
close score of 18 to 17. The contest was
just as the result indicates, forty min-
utes of the hardest fought basketball
which has been seen on the local court
in many a moon. _The large crowd pres-
ent witnessed a classy exhibition of
lightning passing and fast floor work on
the part of both clubs, and went away
satisfied that the class league is going
to see some mighty lively times before
the final summary.

The defeat of the Seniors completely
upset the dope, as they were scheduled
te-romp away with the lowly Fresh, and

DR. DONALD RICHARDSON TO
VISIT ALMA MATER SUNDAY

The program committee of the “Y” has
been unusually fortunate in securing a
speaker for the next Sunday night “Y”
service. Dr. Donald Richardson has, ac-
cepted an invitation to come and spend
the entire day on the hill, He to
speak at both the church services and
at the “Y,”

Dr. Richardson is a Davidson alumnus.
While here he made the honor roll for
four years, having the second highest
average made since the founding of the
college. He is now professor and vice-
president at the Theological Seminary
at Nanking, China. He is in America
now on furlough. Dr. Richardson is a
young man himself and comes in con-
stant contact with the young men of
China. He will speak about the life of
a college man in China as compared with
that of one in this country. This will
be particularly interesting to Davidson
students, since Dr. Richardson's college
life in America was the same as ours.
He will tell us, too, of Davidson’s part
in the missions of China. The combina-
tion of such a gifted speaker and such
an interesting subject is rare, and an
unusually fine meeting is expected.

Wildcats Break Leashes
And Take In Queen City

Davidson Special Takes Large Num-
ber of Rooters to Town for .
Wake Forest Game.

For the first time since the Davidson
Wildcats were rounded up in September,
the bars were let down Saturday and the
bloody animals were allowed to roam
the plains in freedom. They swarmed
from their lair and in mighty packs at-
tacked the Queen City.

Strange to say, the inhabitants of the
aforementioned city were not in the
Icast alarmed at the sight of the vicious
beasts but opened up the gates of the
place to the felines and allowed them
to roam the streets at will.

The Wildcats were conveyed to Char-
lotte by means of a special train and
great was the excitement thereof. The
first signs of merriment were displayed
before the coaches pulled out of the
historic village of Davidson. A lad from
Georgia, where they raise ’em wild and
wooly, a member of the class whose

vanced the ball by line fushes to Da-
vidson's one-yard line and first down.
Four times they bucked the line in a
mighty effort to carry the pigskin over
but each time failed by less than a foot.
On the third down Spratt Moore dived
over. the line, and met Heckman in mid
air, stopping him in his tracks. A punt
by Hunter was blocked back of the goal
line and went out of bounds, Wake For-
est recovering, The ball was put in play
again on the one yard line and this time
it took the heavy Baptist backs three
tries to finally carry the ball over,

The deciding three points of the game
were made in the last five minutes of
play by Heckman. Rushing the ball to
the Wildcats’ five-yard line again, they
failed to gain. Heckman dropped back
and drop-kicked the oval between the
bars for a win.

Trinity Meets Davidson In
Tennis Matches Here

Local Racquet-Wielders Picked and
Are in Fine Condition.

Ambitions will be smashed and hopes
realized Thursday afternoon when the
Wildcats, using the team of Trinity as a
lever, pry off the lid of this fall’s inter-
collegiate tennis. The match will prob-
ably be a close one and the Davidson
racquent-wielders are bending every ef-
fort to come out of the match carrying
the Red and Black high above the Meth-
odist colors.

The local team has been picked. The
two letter men of last year, Bradley and
Cunningham, have again won berths on
the Wildcat Special that plans to go
through the season without suffering a
defeat. The other seats on the special
will be held down by Ormond and Wil-
kinson, Prospects are bright for a ban-
ner year and the team feels confident
that their highest hopes will be realized.

Besides the Trinity encounter the team
will also take on Wake Forest before
Jack Frost puts an end to the racquet
raising game. Last year’s state cham-
pions feel secure in their ability to re-
peat, but the Wildcats are an obstacle
that will have to be overcome first.

The third round of the tournament
went off according to schedule, no up-
sets marring old man Dope’s forecasts.
None of the matches went more than!
two sets.

In the semi-final round Bradley easily
defeated Wilkinson, 6-1, 6-0, 6-1. In the
upper bracket Ormond and Cunningham
played the hardest fought match of the
tournament. After losing his first two
sets in listless fashion, 0-6, 1-6, Ormond
scemed to awaken and to play an un-
beatable @rand of the court game. Al-
though the next three sets were keenly
contested, Ormond succeeded in captur-
ing them all, 6-4, 8-6, 6-4.

Davidson scored theirstouchdown in
the second quarter, on a 50-yard run
hack of an attempted drop kick of Heck-
man’s, by Moore, off tackle plays by Be-
thea and McFadden, and a cross buck in
which John Schenck carried the ball into
the end zone.

Spratt Moore was the outstanding star
for the Wildcats. Time and again he
was called on to carry the ball around
ends apd always he made a gain. His
playing in the Wake Forest game has
caused many followers of football to
