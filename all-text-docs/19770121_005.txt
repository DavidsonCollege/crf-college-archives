‘Women’s house to add diversity

By BILL BARNETT
Editorial Page Editor

The Council on Campus and Reli-
gious Life soon faces an important
decision. Two student groups have
applied to the Patterson Court Coun-
cil for permission to organize an
eating house on the Court next year.
This new house would occupy Rusk
House, which is presently being used
by ARA Slater to serve a number of
purposes.

The first group is composed en-
tirely of freshmen and is headed by
Robert Payne. The second group is
composed of women from all of the
classes and is led by Angie Wright

and Margaret Herman. Both groups
have sufficient commitments to make
the house feasible, and both are
dedicated enough to make it a reality.
However, upon careful consideration
of the matter, it is evident that the
“women’s” group is the better alter-
native.

There are several reasons why the
‘‘women’s’’ house is the best idea.
First, the women at Davidson have no
social organization which is designed
specifically to suit their needs. Males
have the option of joining either an
all-male on-campus fraternity, an
all-male off-campus fraternity (if they
receive a bid(, or a coed eating house.
As of right now, though, the only
opportunity a female has is to join a
coed eating house. It would only seem
fair that if males can join all-male
groups, then females should also have
that choice.

The argument which then occurs is
that an-all-female eating house would.
be discriminatory against males, a
violation of the Patterson Court
regulations. In reality, though, this is
not a problem at all. The house could
be chartered as a non-discriminatory
eating house, but also stating that its
intention is to cater to the female
population. Thus, any hard-headed
men who still wanted to join would be
forewarned that they were not wanted
and probably would never really
become a functioning member of the
house.

There are other reasons for an
all-female eating house. The girls
complain that the diets in coed houses
are not set up with them in mind. The
diet in an all-female house would be
arranged to suit their needs—more
salads and, fruit with less of the
starchy, fattening foods that men
tend to enjoy.

Beyond the freshman hall, girls
have few opportunities to have and
enjoy exclusively female companion-
ship. They are thrust into a situation
where they are outnumbered by males
about three to one, and many girls
lament the fact that there are no
facilities to create any unity among

their female classmates. Not all of the

girls feel this way, but the point is
that this opportunity has not been
available in the past. No women
would be forced to join the all-female
eating house, but that privilege would
at least be available.

Another of the complaints people
have about an all-female eating house
is that it would soon become a

sorority, with all of a sorority’s
undesirable aspects such as excluding
some girls from membership. No one
can predict the future, but the girls
who have organized the house, say
that it will be chartered in such a way
that it would not become a sorority.
They add that a sorority is usually a
social center which turns outward to
fraternities, etc., while their house
would turn inward upon itself for
more female interaction. _

Social scene still stinks

To the Editor:
Re: “‘Social Scene Stinks”

In response to what you said,
Chuck, I agree but I disagree. I agree
that there are some obvious and
disturbing things wrong with the
social scene at Davidson. A lot of
them leave people frustrated in a
number of different ways. But, I
think there are some important ,
factors that you may have overlooked
(though, for the most part the ones
you mentioned made sense to me).

First, I think we face some obvious
problems in reconciling the expecta-
tions that our culture has been blaring
at us and what life is really like.
Especially the expectations and mo-
dels for physical involvement. Our
whole culture, from theatre, tele-
vision, and film on down to shampoo
commercials and car ads seems some-
times to bé programming us to expect
instant, gratuitous, physical gratifi-
cation (sex if you like, on some level).
’ think in dealing with our own

frustrations and then the tensions and

weirdness of relationships here, we'll
never get very far without first
recognizing the forces and emotions
that our culture’s onslaught has
stirred up in us. One reason why the
guys are probably more frustrated is
that we’re more susceptible to this
sort of stimulus.

Secondly, you dealt with the prob-
lem of how ‘“‘small minds here...ass-
ume relationships.’’ I think this
problem is possibly tied pretty closely
to the first. Physical expression is
also communication. Different levels
of physical expression communicate
different levels of commitment and
relationship. But you can lie with any
form of communication.

You can make a false statement as
easily (perhaps more easily) with your
body as with your mouth. We need to
think about how seriously we take the
message of our physical actions.

More directly to the problem: when
people observe certain kinds of physi-
cal expression between two people,
they are going to assume that a
relationship exists. Because that’s
what those two people are saying. It’s
what their actions mean. Those
actions mean things because of who
we (human beings) are. Perhaps we
need to be a little slower in making
certain expressions without a corres-
ponding level of commitment. With-
out that people get hurt, as people
almost always do when we mislead. I
speak in confession (and what I hope
is concerned), not accusation.

Maybé this hasn’t spoken directly
to the issue you raised in your column
Chuck, but I felt prompted to write.
Anybody else got any ideas?

Chartering an all-female eating
house would benefit the college as well
as the girls who are in it. It would
help ease the strain of overcrowding
on Patterson Court, both by offering
about thirty-five new spaces to fresh-
men, and by easing the burden on
some of the coed houses already on
the court. Payne’s group would also
open up new spaces for freshmen, but
it hasn’t yet demonstrated that it
would attract anyone from already
existing houses.

The most important thing an .
all-female house would do, though, is
add a measure of diversity to Patter-
son Court, and the whole college in
general. Patterson Court would defin-
itely benefit from this new alterna-
tive. More importantly, though, is
that Davidson would benefit. The

college is still adjusting to the
changes wrought by coeducation, and
chartering an all-female house would
be a positive step in completing this
adjustment.
