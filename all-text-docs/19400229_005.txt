Julian Lokey, Senior:

I am 100 per cent in favor of the
proposed amendments, for they are
undoubtedly improvements of the

present method of voting. The use|
of locked ballot boxes would af-
ford a more systematic, accurate, |
and safer means of securing the |
ballots of the students. It will pre-.
vent absentee voting, intentional
removal of legal ballots, and care- |
less loss of ballots. The elections |
board would provide an even and |
balanced representation of student |

group interests in controlling the

of the proposed amendment, is a
good solution of the problem of

attend annual elections; but I am

up another body, independent of |

functions which the Student Coun- |
cil is expected to perform. I should |
like for us to adopt the first part |
of the proposed amendment this |
year and leave it' to be enforced by |
the Student Council. If experience |
proves that there is still a need |
for a body more representative of |

Warren. Ludlam, Senior: |

There has long been a feeling onl
our campus that steps should be |
taken to clean up the method of |
running elections. To my mind, the
two proposed amendments to the
Constitution mark the‘ first step in
the right direction. On the whole |
I think that they have been care- |
fully thought through and written |
but I would like to add one sug-

|
gestion. |

In all public elections it is cus- |
tomary to have a list of the pros-|
pective voters and to check them |
off as they cast their ballots. 1}
would suggest that each man have |
