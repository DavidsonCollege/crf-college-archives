Y Announces
Disposition Of
Student Funds

World Colleges And County
Healt Aided

Murphy Williams announced last
week that the Y.M.C.A. contributed
$600 to good causes at the begin-
ning of this semester. The money
was given by Davidson students
into a fund called the Vesper Fund
Budget which consists entirely of
the offerings of students at Ves-
pers.

Five Hundred of the six hundred
dollars was donated to the World
Student Fund which
concerned with giving students
over the world financial
Through the service fund
students are enabled to purchase
‘food, books, and supplies
while much of the money contri-
buted is used to build new build-
ings for the use of students. It is
not known exactly where the money
Davidson has given is to be sent
or used, though it is likely that
the major portion of it will go to
Europe to aid in the establishment
of Youth Hostels.

$100 For County Health

One hundred dollars was given
to the Mecklenburg County Tuber-
culosis and Health Association,

county of tuberculosis. One of
the major efforts of this  as-
sociation in its work has been
the financing and operation of
a moble X-ray unit. which fur-
nishes free chest X-rays of any

resident of Mecklenburg County, if
they so desire. Through the mobile
X-ray unit many cases of tuber-
culosis have been detected and ar-
rested in their primary stages,
thus materially reducing the rate of
infection.

Murphy also announced that
anyone who is interested in work-
ing in a summér camp next summer
should see him immediately for in-
formation on the subject.

$5,500 Collected

Joe Stukes, head of the 1946
Christmas Gift Fund, revealed that
a total of $5,447.53 has been col-
lected and placed in the bank pend-
ing payment of pledges by some
few students. Over $100 in pledges
stil! remains unpaid and Stukes
emphasised the importance of their
being paid soon, as the money can-
not be sent to Hankchow until
every cent has been collected. The
money is being sent through the
Executive Board of Foreign Mis-
sions of the Presbyterian Church
of the United States. Those stu-
dents who have not paid their
pledges are urged to do so as soon
as possible in order that the money
may be sent where it is so badly
needed.

The students who aided Stukes
in the obtaining and payment of
pledges were: Bob Flowers, George
Worth, George Gunn, Arthur Lind-
say, Whitt Cobb, Ernie Stricklin,
Hugh Hill, Pat Williams, John Yar-
borough, Zee Holler, Johnny Mil-
ler, Bill Joyner, Gene Linton, Alf
Taylor, Sam Erwin, Herb Mesa,
Charley Gibbs, Ronny Dietrick
John Fairly, Lenox Turnbull, John-
ny Walker, Jack Payne, J. P.
Whitely, Don Hatch, Charles
Powéell, and Champney McNair.

President, Dean
At Boston Forum

President John R. Cunningham
and Dean of the faculty C. Ken-
neth Brown have recently returned
to the Davidson Campus after
several days spent in Boston in
attendance to the annual meeting
of the. association of American
Colleges at the Hotel Statler.

President Cunningham reported
today that the meeting this year
was generally regarded as a very
significant occasion. He said that
two general topics were paramount
during the sessions. “The, first,” he
stated, “was the relation of re-
ligion liberal education.” The
two principal addresses were made
by Archbishop Richard J. Cushing
of the Roman Catholic Church,
Boston, and Dr. George A. But-
trick of the Madison Avenue’ Pres-
byterian Church of New York City.

A Symposium on Universal Mik-
tary training was conducted by
Lt. General J. Lawton Collins who
represented the War Department
in favor of universal military train-
ing, Président Mordecai W. John-
son’of Harvard “University (Negro),
President William J. Millor, of
the University of Detroit (Catholic)
and President Carter Davidson, of
Union College (Protestant) spoke
at length on the subject. No vote
was taken at the conference. “The
colleges will express themselves
by written ballot within the next
few weeks,” said Dr. Cunningham,
who noted that the same associa-
tion voted overwhelmingly against
universal military training in Jan-
uary, 1945, at Atlantic City.

Mildred McAfee Horton, the
president of Wellesly College, who
during the war was head of the
Waves, was elected President of

to

the Association for 1947-48....She

Of Program

Library Has New
Reserve System

It was found during the last
semester that the large number of
reserve books réad overloaded the
old card system beyond the point
of efficiency. A new and_simpli-
fied system has been adopted for
this semester. Instead of filling
out a complete circulation card as
usual for books checked out of the
building, it will be necessary only
to fill out a reserve book card;
which is provided with space. only
for the borrower's name. This
system will give much quicked and
more’ efficient service in this re-
spect.

New Cards

The new cards have space for
fifty users. When the card is filled,
it will be saved for record and the
circulation report to the president.
the American. Library Association,
and the North Carolina Library
Association will be made from these
cards. Also it will be possible for
the professors to know how much
each book on reserve is read, thus
giving them an idea of the relative
value of the reserved books and
their relative popularity with the
students.

The library has under considera-
tion a change in the outside circu-
lation system, but to recatalog some

Respigi; a Sonata by Scarlatti; the
slow. movement from the Appas-
sionata Sonata of Becthoven.a
Rondo of Mozart; two Intermezzi

Impromptu of Chopin. This was
Mrs. Pfohl’s first. appearance in
Davidson for sometime, and it is
hoped that she can be presented

Inthe business meetings pre-
ceding Monday night’s program, a
motion was passed to the effect
that a_welcome be extended to all
members of faculty and student
body to attend all future presenta-
tions of Phi Mu Alpha. An all

sented at the next regular meeting,
featuring student musicians.

A Phi Mu Alpha Bulletin Board

to the college, whereby notices of
all-musical events will be publicized,
giving an optimum number of
students opportunity to plan in
advance to attend musical. events.

said, “I know this is the commu uty
center, but that’s about all I know.
Just what, and why is this place?”

“Well.” said Miles, “back in 1939
the school kids here had no place
to go from the time the school
let out the afternoon till the
time their parents came hom. from
work, So the Davidson Y used
the 1939 gift fund to build this
house, and then put the project
under the trusteeship of the civic
club.”

“Who runs it

“It's a part of the work of the
community service department of
the Davidson Y. I have a group of
Davidson boys helping me, and
we open five days a week. We
Operate with the permission of the
civic club, and with the cooperation

of Professor Poe of the negro
school, Reverend Wells, Ralph
Johnson, Kenneth Norton, and
other members of the community
council.”

“What is your work here?.Do

you try to train the boys or coach
them any?”

“Well, often we do unpire or re-
feree their games, play with
them. Our purpose, though, is not
to coach them, but to provide a
place for them to play, and equip-
ment to play with.”

Miles gestured toward the boys
playing outside. “Basketball, as
you can see —and boxing. Foot-
ball, softball, and sometimes volley-
ball. We've got a couple of ping
pong tables now, and darts, and
a few other indoor games.

“But you see, this house has to
double as_a cafeteria for the school.
Professor Poe and the faculty have
been swell in cooperating with us,
but there is still a bit of inconven-
ience. The house closes as a
cafeteria at two thirty, and opens
as a community center about three,
which doesn't leave too much time
‘for cleaning up the place. Then
again, the building is small and
the lunch tables crowd us consider-
ably, so there's practically no room
for indoor. activities.”

“What about your playing fields?”
I asked.

“Come with me, and I'll show
you what about them,” Miles said.

“Golly!” I said “those kids si!
