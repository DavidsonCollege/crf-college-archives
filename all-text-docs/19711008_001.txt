Coeducation: A Battle Over Time

AN ANALYSIS

By RICH WILSON
Managing Editor

The students say now. The
administration savs— later.

This seems to be. the present
status of coeducation as both
enter the
battle over timing

In the next few weeks the
Senate subcommittee on cocdu
cation will wage a psychologicai
battle with the administration in
the hope that enough internal
pressure can be applied to al
low some form of coeducation
next vear.

Under the leadership of-—Reg-
gie Kennedy, the committee
has already begun its campaign
by issuing a letter to the facul-

forces coeducation

Other administrative officials
said that the proposal was short-
sighted and did not show evi-
dence of an overal! plan for co-

education.

“The problem is that the ad-
ministration has its own con-
ception ef how Davidson should

cept alternatives,’ said Student

Body President Danny Clod-
felter.

which obstructs any movement
toward coeducation at all.’" he

Said.

While the students and ad-
ministration are arguing how-
ever, a new element is jump-
ing—somewhat reluctantly —
into the fray. The faculty Edu-
cational Policy Committee
(EPC) has been charged by the
president to develop their plan
for coeducation.

So for the next few weeks the
EPC subcommittee composed of
Assistant: Professor of English
Charles Cornwell, student Jody
Turner, Assistant Professor
of Biology David Grant, and
Professor of Economics Charles
Ratliff will research the pro-
blem and submit a report on
how they think the college
should go coed.

This report will then be sub-
mitted for the faculty Budget,
Building and Grounds Commit-
tee which will determine the
financial feasibility.

It is uncertain how much af-
fect the faculty will have on the
battle of coeducation timing,
since it must be remembered

YAF Chapter Gets $250 From Senate:

Classes Not Suspended For Moratorium

By TOM BRUCE
Staff Writer

A $250 grant to the Young
Amercians for Freedom, an
eleventh hour reversal on a mo-
tion to suspend classes for the
October 13 Moratorium, and
circulation of Todd Eades’ 8
page report on the Comprehen-
sive fee dominated the Tuesday
meeting of the SGA senate.

Davidson's local Young Amer
icans for Freedom Chapter was
assembled during the last week
by Senior Robert Morey. The
seven-member group was grant-
ed $250 to bring Mike Thomp-
son to the campus on Morator-
ium Day. Thompson has pub
lished in the National Review
and has made several trips to
South Vietnam.

Although, his customary
public speaking is
to Davidson at
a reduced rate because of the
willingness of the National YAF
to absorb some of

charge for
$700, he comes

When pressed by the Senate

to State the position of Young
Americans for Freedum, Morey
said, “We support the fight

against Communism and seek
victory in Vietnam with honor.”

forcing the rule which has been
ignored for four years.

Freshman Gus Succop’s mo-
tion to move for suspension of
class activities on the Oct. 13
moratorium date was approved
early in the evening by a vote
of 10-9. ;

Arguments against the meas-
ure revolved around the fact
that students would not be giv-
en a choice about attending
classes, but would have to suf-
fer from the resulting disrup-
tion,

Succop argued that the Sen-
ate’s $500 investinent in speak-
ers warranted a suspension of
classes so that every student
could) attend the programs.
Peace Coalition representatives
then assured the Senate that
their speakers had been sched-
uled for non-class hours.

After the Senate agenda had
been exhausted and motions has
been tabled until next week,
Junior Bill Meier, who had voted
in favor of the class suspension,
moved that the question be re-
considered.

Meier stated that Ralph Pee-
ples of the Peace Coalition did
not feel that the proposal was
desirable. A vote on the new
motion reversed the original
motion by a vote of 13 to 1,
with three absentions.

Senate recommendations on
the comprehensive fee recently
instituted by the college for
next year were delayed until
next week in order to allow
senators time to read a report
on the matter compiled by
Sophomore Todd Eades,

The report recommends that
the Senate’ favor the compre-
hensive fee with several reserv-
ations. A related letter to the
SGA Senate from  Clodfelter
termed the decision to imple-
ment the fee as “‘one of the
most poorly thought—through in
recent memory.”

Other Senate ,action approved
two new voting. seats on the
body. A Grey House representa-

tive and an offcampus mem-
ber were provided for in an
amendment ratified by the
group.

Senator Doug Brown was ap-
pointed to the Educational Pol-
icy Committee, while Don Par-
man and Robert Miles were
named to the Queens-Davidson
Committee. Parman will have
voting power, and Miles will
serve as an advisor. Jim Rey-
nolds was elected to the Library
Planning Committee.

each chair the respective com-
niittees.

So unless the faculty becomes
excessively irritated this year
the final report of these com-
mittees will probably be rela-
tively similar to the present
administrative stand on the is-
sue.

Spencer said that the final re-
port will be brought to the fac-
ulty for a vote and then passed
on to the trustees who must
also approve the plan.

But the students will not be
idle during this period. Various
activities such as a coeduca-
tion week and demonstrations
are in the planning stages.

And to continue the issue
even further a bill is present-:
ly to go before the House of
Representatives which says that
an institution which is in the
process of shifting from a single
sex to a coeducational basis
will be given seven years to
make the transition before they
must not discriminate against
the sex of applicants.

This means. that no quotas
could be set. Davidson could
not for example set en a ratio
of 1,000 men to 500 women. The
college must accept all appli-
cants on the basis of ability or
else all federal funds would be
cut off.

Bevan says that this is one
reason why he rejects the Duke
Dormitory proposal, since once
the college is committed to co-
education, no restrictions can
be set if this bill should be pass-
ed.

Clodfelter says. however. he
has contacted former Davidson
professor Jon Fuller who is an
assistant to the Commissioner
of Education in Washington,
D. C., and that Fuller said
Davidson is already committed
to coeducation.

‘Fuller said that Davidson

Conoley Disregards
Spending Ceiling

Despite a vote by the Senate
to limit spending on the year-
book to $8,000 this year, Quips
and Cranks Editor Ronnie Con-
oley has requested a budget of
$10,500.

Appearing before the Activi-
ties Fee Committee, a sub-com-
mittee of the Senate, Conoley
requested that this amount be
granted to the yearbook.

When asked why he requested
$2,500 more than the Senate
limit, Conoley replied, “‘We

asked for that amount of money .

because that is what we think
we need.”

Conoley said that the SGA
limit in no way affects what
he requests.

Student Body President Dan-
ny Clodfelter said he found
Conoley’s actions difficult to un-
derstand.

“The Senate set $8,000 as a
ceiling for what could be spent
on the yearbook,’ Clodfelter
said.

, Although it is unusual for
the Senate to direct the Activi-
ties Fee Committee to limit the
budget of a group, the Senate
felt that action needed to be
taken on this issue.”

Since the Senate has the ulti-
mate control of the Student

Activities Fee, Clodfelter said
that no matter what Conoley
requests or what the Activities
Fee Committee grants, no more
than $8,0000 would be used for
the yearbook.

Conoley said that he had no’
idea how much money he would
get. “‘My hopes have gone up
and down with the Senate’s ac-
tion. First they approve $10,500
and then $8,000. I don’t know
what they'll do next.”

In limiting the yearbook to
an $8,000 budget last year, the
Senate based its decision on a
poll of the student body which
revealed that majority of the
students favored a reduction in
the money spent on the year-
book.

The Activities Fee Committee
is to meet this morning to fur-
ther consider the distribution
of student fees.

Members of the Activities Fee
Committee are Business Man-
ager of the College Robert A.
Currie, Director of the College
Union C. Shaw Smith, Profes-
sor of Mathematics Richard R.
Bernard, Senior Senator Cecil
Burney, Nick -Livengood, Rob-
ert Straub, and Sophomore Sen-
ators Bill Ralston and Doug
Brown.
