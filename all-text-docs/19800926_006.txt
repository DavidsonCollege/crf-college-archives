Sex! Sex! Sex! Brian De
Palma’s Dressed To Kill makes
you live it, breath it and feel it
for two lusty hours. His camera
creates a carnal universe as
alternatively explicit and mys-
terious, attractive and terrify-
ing as desire itself.

Students show interest in Chambers Gallery art sale

By JOHN KROTCHKO
Assitant Features Editor

Does student interest in
printed art go anywhere beyond
the comic strip? If last Thurs-
day’s American/European Ori-
ginal Graphic Arts Exhibition
and Sale was any indication, the
answer is an_ encouraging
‘‘yes!’’ Attendance at the
Chamber’s Gallery was steady
throughout the day, and as
many as twenty-five prints were
sold.

I happened upon the Gallery
exhibit quite by chance, but
soon noticed that despite al-
most no publicity, many other
students had found it also.

Immediately absorbed, I be-
gan rummaging through prints,
engravings and etchings that
included fifteenth century Bible
pages, contemporary American
art and lushly colored European
posters. The pieces were expen-
sive, but tempting.

“There was considerable in-
terest on the part of the
students.”’

According to Warren Joyce,
the suave sales representative
of Marson Galleries in Boston.
He spent much of the day
advising, and explaining the
various techniques of the gra-
phic arts to curious potential
buyers. He commented that the
students were ‘‘knowledgeable’”’
and the sale ‘‘well above aver-
age’’ compared to other schools
he has visited throughout the
Southeast.

I noticed a friend of mine at
another table, laboriously
searching for just the right
Calder print to give to his
brother for a birthday present.
Like him, Joyce explained,
most students were primarily
concerned with subject matter
and appeal, although invest-
ment was certainly a considera-
tion.

The Gallery sale was a true
test of the Davidson student’s
degree of art appreciation.

Why? Money.

Art and culture pervade ever-
y aspect of the extracurricular
scene at Davidson, but rarely is
any of it beyond the reach of a
few dollars. Fine films show for
next to nothing in Love: fine
performers are often free at
Hodson; and anyone who has
ever bought a ticket for a
Broadway show knows that $3
for a season pass to the Artists
‘Series is a downright steal.
Even graphic arts, if one is not
too paricular, can be rented
yearly for a minimal sum.

Thus, when Joyce brought
his collection to Davidson last
week, the significant phenome-
non was not just the interest
generated, but the ‘‘above aver-
age’’ sale that resulted.

Students buying was not
merely impulsive, however, ac-
cording to junior art student
Whit Wampler, who observed
that ‘‘the notable interest was
based not only on appeal, but
on an appreciation of the quali-
ty of the art...backed by hard
cash.’’ Wampler bought a print
of Noah's Ark; besides it being
a good investment, she noted,
“I liked the hell out of it.”

It’s not just that Davidson
students have money —and
they do—but it’s what they
spend it on. One would general-
ly conclude that almost the only
things for which students are
willing to fork over money are
stereo systems, cars, Jimmy
Buffet albums, topsiders, de-
signer jeans and ubiquitous

arrays of pink-and-green gator
wear. But money talks, and
many people seemed to notice
last week when it said that

Davidson students have a via-

ble interest in collectible fine
art. Wampler said the show’s
success ‘‘indicates that there is
more fine arts awareness on
campus than a lot of people
think.”’

My friend eventually decided
on a print and I, realizing that
two hours of indecision had
flown by, reached for my Mas-
ter Charge to purchase the
objects of my desire, some
illustrated pages out of an
eigthteenth century English
Naturalist’s Handbook: a green
dog, two Honey Buzzards and a
Long-Nosed Tapiir.

tended to ridicule the psychoan-
alytic attempt to rationalize
madness.

Dressed To Kill, a studied
descendant of these works,
paradies the paradies by push-
ing the sexual element of the
horror story even more to the
fore.

The highly contrived expla-
nation of the film’s transvestite
killer draws out obvious laughs,
whereas the irony of Psycho and
Lolita always left a slight fear
that the Freudian gobbldy-goop
was supposed to be taken
seriously. Dressed To Kill really
constitutes a pop version of
Psycho} the new film being
more pleasant and less subtle
than its predecessor.

DePalma’s heroine (played by
Angie Dickinson) is a housewife
who despairs because her hus-
band lacks energy in bed. (The
plot summary almost makes me
want to dust off an old cigar and
stretch out on a couch.) She
visits her local shrink (Michael
Caine) and attempts to seduce
this respected member of the
medical profession. He shakes
his head and pleads professional
ethics.

Unfulfilled, Dickinson rushes
off to the local museum where
she engages in a danse macabre
with a mysterious and sinister
sightseer. This beautiful lyric
scene introduces the film’s
recurrent motif of the pursuer
becoming the pursued. Dickin-
son drops her glove in an effort
to pick up this stranger and the
camera delightfully follows the
pair through a gallery of
strangely sexy paintings. De-
Palma hasn’t been this roman-
tic since Obsession, which also
exploited beautiful art and wo-
men.

WAVES

UPRISING
Bob Marley and the Wailers
(Island)

Reggae is probably the best
music to be widely overlooked
in the U.S, today. Regarded as
the original political music,
Reggae is a vital music of the

spirit and Bob Marley is its

most successful and articulate
spokesman.

Uprising emerges as a posi-
tive bubbling-over of human
music about the political and
religious struggles of Jamaica
and the world. And what’s
important here is not the strug-
gle so much as it is the singing
about the.struggle. In the most
moving song on the album,
‘‘Redemption Song’’, Marley
says, ‘‘All I ever had is songs of
freedom.’’/‘‘Won’t you help to
sing these songs of freedom?’”’
Listeners can at least share the
freedom of movement that

From reggae

comes so naturally with this
music and relate to its purely
human element, regardless of
our social backgrounds.

At a time when much of
contemporary music is con-
cerned with exposing the rot-
ting core of modern society (and
all too often with an attitude of
sophisticated indifference) it’s
nice to be carried off to a
simpler realm by the breezy
force of Marley’s music. For the
sake of real music and every-
thing good inside, buy this
record.

THERE AND BACK
Jeff Beck
(Epic)

This album is the latest in
pseudo-jazz/fusion by a once-
true-guitarist turned pro, Jeff
Beck. The disc’s production is
so slick it's almost offensive
(like a long black Cadillac), and
the music is harmless enough to
play at PAX: There and Back

doesn't go much of anywhere
and where it does go is in the
wrong direction.

FREEDOM OF CHOICE
Devo
(Warner Brothers)

If all you have heard by Devo
was from their first two albums,
then you don’t know the whole

. truth about these guys. The

dokters of devolution are really

the happy new dance band of |

our Brave New World.

I saw these guys play in
Florida last month and they are
fun. Freedom of Choice bounces
with that spirit of fun, but the
music leaves you with no
choice. You will feel this in-
tensely danceable, electronic,
head rock and you will move, if
you can. You will stand to
.songs entitled ‘‘Girl U Want”,
“Whipit"’, “Gates of Steel” and
‘That's Pep!’’ And if you’re
really uninhibited, maybe you'll
sprot a chess pawn hat and

to rock, it’s all energy

dance away to the Spudboy’s
beat, soma in hand.

ENTERTAINMENT!
Gang of’Four

I think I should tell you from
the start that this band’s music
is subbversive. Their lyrics are
political, the album cover is
bright red—think a moment;
where did the last ‘‘Gand of
anything”’ influence the world?
The Gang of Four is from
Britain and their insipid fight is
waged against the norms and
shams of western society. Their
music is an exercise in electric
nihilism. While the band’s en-
ergy is vital and well-harnessed,
the record’s production has the
studio sound of. the new ‘‘Radi-
cal chic.”’

No harm done, however. The
music is original and the lyrics
are much more arrogant than
those of the average beach
song. Entertainment! is sheer
Avantarchy .(sic)
