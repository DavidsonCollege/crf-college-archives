Baseball battles, but falls to Duke

ally nationally-ranked Hurricanes.

But the contest did represent a
marked improvement from the ugly
loss to N.C. State, as the Wildcats
(18-26)
pounded out
11 hits and
were never
really out of
contention.

“We
battled
well,” said
coach Dick ———————
Cooke. “We were in the ballgame
and much more ready to play (than
we were against State).”

Catcher Kurt Davis, who pla-
toons behind the plate with Dom
Talvacchio and Chris Cox, went 3-
for-4, including an RBI and two
doubles — one a towering drive to
the wall in left, the other a low liner
into the left field corner.

“Kurt struggled early this sea-
son, but he’s been swinging the bat
really well lately,” Cooke explained.
“And his play behind the plate has
been good.”

Marshall Tyler pieced together
a solid day at the plate, going 1-for-
2 with a walk, an RBI, and three
runs scored,

Jeff Coker also added two hits.

Duke, which began the season
at 15-3 and has not been as sharp
recently, was paced by leadoff hit-
ter and shortstop Vaughn Schill,
and a prolific middle of the lineup.

Schill collected three hits in -

five at-bats and the Blue Devils’ 4-
5-6-7 hitters teamed torap nine hits,
and accounted for-seven RBIs and
nine runs.

Otherwise, starter Brandon
Davis and reliever Ricky Paugh
pitched well, allowing just seven
earned runs and striking out eight in
as many innings of work.

Baseball hangs close through four,
Wolfpack bats ignite late for win

By MICHAEL KRUSE

RALEIGH — The baseball
team struck for two quick first-in-
ning runs
against ACC
power North
Carolina State
Tuesday night here at Doak Field.

And after four innings, the
Wildcats stood knotted at 4-4 with
the Wolfpack.

Then all hell broke loose.

State (32-11) scored the game’s
final 18 rans — five in both the fifth
and sixth, and eight in the seventh
— to earn a dominant 22-4 victory
over the Wildcats (18-25).

“We didn’t play particularly
well defensively,” said coach Dick
Cooke, referring to his team’s five
errors. “And there were some balls
we should have made plays on.

“Jamie (McDonald) threw
pretty well, but didn’t have his usual
command. He didn’t throw badly

though.”

Not at all. McDonald, who
started on the mound for the Wild-
cats, settled down after an iffy three-
run first and contained State’s lineup
through the next three innings.

But the potent Wolfpack —
which boasts an overall .328 bat-
ting clip and three .400 hitters, and
had produced an eye-popping 28-9
win over Maryland just two days
earlier — knocked McDonald out
of the game in the fifth and pro-
ceeded to put on a jaw-dropping
show of offensive fireworks at the
expense of the Davidson relief corps.

Fritz Porter, Derek Coombs,
and Mike DeSimone combined for
two innings pitched in which State
tallied 13 runs on 13 hits.

.Dynamic second baseman Tom
Sergio led the 22-hit parade, going

4-for-6 with a homer and six RBIs.

Chris Combs, a hulking 6-foot-
8 first baseman, also homered.
Overall, six State players finished
with two or more runs driven in.

Two freshmen claim singles titles

By JAy CANTRELL
Staff Writer

When men’s tennis coach Jeff
Frank set up the annual tryout tour-
namentbackin August, no onecould
have thought it would feature two
1997 Southern Conference Tour-
nament Champions.

“TI was just hoping I would be
anywhere on the team,” said fresh-
man Alex Okulski.

He and fellow classmate Brett
Ialacci were more than just on the
team. The newcomers won cham-
pionships in the number six and
number three singles flights, respec-
tively. Both were seeded No. 1 in
their first ever Southern Confer-
ence Tournament.

Talacci started out slowly in his
first match Friday, but held on fora
7-6 (7-4), 6-3 victory.

“I wasn’t very focused,” he
said. 2

That changed, however, dur-
ing the next two days, as he knocked
off Armen Safarian of East Tennes-
see State 6-1, 6-3 on Saturday and
followed that with a 6-1, 6-4 win
over Furman’s Erik deVries for the
championship on Sunday.

In each of those two matches,
Ialacci gave up the first three games
of the second set after winning the
first.

“(Coach Frank) told me to
move my feet, concentrate, and keep
the ball to the guy’s backhand,”
Talacci said.

That strategy worked as Ialacci
won six of the next seven games to
take the duel in straight sets.

Okulski’s road to the title in-
cluded only two matches. He re-
ceived a bye in the first round be-
cause he was the No. 1 seed.

On Saturday the freshman de-
feated Chris Duncan of The Citadel
6-2, 6-4. The following day he
clinched the championship with a
6-2, 6-2 win against Matt Keeter of
East Tennessee State.

Keeter was the sixth seed in the
flight, but his Cinderella run ended
when he faced off with Okulski in
the finals.

“T just wanted to be aggressive
and force him to make shots,” he
said.

“He goes to the net more than I
do,” Talacci said of his teammate.
“I'd rather just let the other guy ~
miss.”
