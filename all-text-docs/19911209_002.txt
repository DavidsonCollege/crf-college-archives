Klenovic keeps up with his family by telephone and by fax, and he
said that although they are safe so far, they are very frightened. He is
also able to see hourly updates on the war through the Davidson
computer system, which links. up fo international networks. Both
Yugoslav sides post news and appeals on the computer bulletin boards,
so he is able to receive much more thorough and quicker updates
through the center than through the American media.

After spending all of last year as an exchange student in Charlotte,
where he attended Garringer High School and Charlotte Country Day
School, Klenovic enrolled this year as a freshman at Davidson. He is
one of four Yugoslavian'students at Davidson, but the others are from

Serbia and Slovenia.

His call fora vigil came from apleaby Yugoslavian studentsat Yale
for demonstrations across the country. Speakers at the vigil included

in International Studies.

Throughout these past seven years Martin placed emphasis on
economic growth, on creating new jobs, on raising the level of educa-
tion, and on improving the highway system. He also spent time trying
to correct the overcrowding of prisons, trying to eliminate illegal drugs,
and trying to heighten drunken driving and alcohol abuse awareness.

Martin recently announced that he is retiring from his political
career when his second term as governor ends in 1993.

According to Charles M. Shelton of Charlotte, the campaign chair-
man, The James G. Martin Fund will honor its namesake’s “legacy of
a common sense, responsible approach to the challenges of govern-

ment.”

Interestingly enough, thisis not the first occasion in which Davidson

has chosen to honor the Martin family. Governor Martin and his three
brothers, also Davidson alumni, established The Arthur and Mary
‘Martin Scholars Program in 1983 in honor of their parents. The
program offers. merit scholarships to those students interested in
choosing the ordained Christian ministry as their life’s work.

Students Disciplined
After Being Caught With Their Pants Down

By Walter Price

In October, several Davidson
students were involved in an inci-
dent at a “haunted hayride” in
Mooresville that has led to disci-
plinary action by the Dean of Stu-
dents Office.

According to Dean of Students,
Will Terry, members of the Kappa
Alpha Order and freshmen had
gone to Carrigan’s Farm in
Mooresville fora haunted hayride,
recruited by the owner to scare
hayride participants.

“This year a group of students
have participated in some irrespon-

sible and inappropriate behavior
and Davidson has been tarred with
the brush,” Terry said.

Prompted by complaints of a
group of hayride participants from
achurch in Matthews, the Dean of
Students’ Office interviewed the
participants in the hayride. Discpli-

nary action was taken against ten:

students, one junior and nine fresh-
men. According to Terry, the stu-
dents have to work twenty hours of
community service as wellas have
social probation until February 5.

Responding to some claims
that the imposed sanctions were

Student Health Center
Moving Across From Smith House

By Casey Otis
The student health center,
currently located across from the
Union on Concord road, will be
moving to the Potts’ house at 514
N. Main Street. If the new facility
is completed on schedule, it will be
ready by the end of January.
The new health center will be
approximately three times larger
than the existing facility. The Potts’
house has been renovated and
expanded in the rear.

The larger area facility will
allow both physical and mental
health services to be based in the
Potts' house. Both-the infirmary
and the mental health counseling
center will each occupy a separate
wing in the new health center.

The infirmary wing will serve
the students with two examining
rooms, a laboratory, treatment
room, four private patient rooms,
and aroom for overflow day pa-
tients. The counseling wing will

unduly harsh, Terry said, “I under-
stand the reason they think it is,
however, my concern is the dam-
aged reputation of the college.”
According to the president of
the Kappa Alpha fraternity, Carter
Payne, two letters of apology have
been sent by the house tothe church
as well as an offer by the fraternity
to particpate in any service project
the church deemed appropriate.
“T know that those individuals
who were responsible sincerely
regret their actions, and I com-
mend them for their honesty in
coming forward,” Payne said.

contain offices for Davidson’s three
counselors, a small health library,
and a conference room. Privacy
has been a major consideration in
the renovations.

In all, eighteen people will be
on the staff in the new facility. The
new center will better serve.stu-
dents by being closer to the resi-
dence halls and by having an ac-
cess ramp for the handicapped, a
feature that the Preyer infirmary
did not have.

Tension

general” inits effort to work against
this “intolerant spirit.”

Following Kuykendall’s re-
marks, the faculty rapidly passed
their resolution. The resolution
supports the efforts of the Dean of
Student’s Office and “other groups,
including members of the student
body, faculty and administration,

. that have been active in dealing re-
sponsibly with these issues.”

Dean of Students Will Terry
listed several incidents which
contributed to campus tension.
First, at “Lunar Luau” a group of
black students claimed to have been
the victims of a water balloon at-
tack by the SAE fraternity. While
it is unclear whether the balloons
were purposely aimed, the inci-
dentncarty Syiiin e BEM, Next,

sexist fliers advertising Patterson
Court parties and sexist acts at Phi
Delta Theta’s annual “Air Band”
party offended many members of
thecommunity. Then, distasteful
fliers protesting the new campus
chapter of F.L.A.G. were anony-
mously placed in Chambers build-
ing.
Dean Terry said, “Patterson
Court houses have a special bur-
en” in this problem and stressed

. the need for houses to develop

“sensitivity” to these issues. He
said that there have been other
incidents at Patterson Court par-
ties which have also contributed to
campus tension. Dean Terry said
that the images which houses de-
velop are unhealthy because they
often result in conflict in social
Situations.

“The real tragedy is that
Davidson College is now riding a
crest of excellence,” Dean Terry

said, “but a small minority could
screw up a great future for the rest
of us.” He said the tension on
campus has resulted partly because
of deep-seated problems that are
“fundamental to Davidson, but
American society as well.” Dean
Terry said, “We need tospendalot
of time and thought on learning
how to live together in this com-
munity with an increasing amount
of diversity and with ahigh degree
of civility.”

In an open letter to the
Davidson students, Dean Terry
stressed the need for understand-
ing and criticized the recent
“meanspiritedness.” He said, “It
has become very clear to me that
the level of civility of the commu-
nity has 'seriously declined.” Fur-
thermore he said, “Every person
deserves to be treated with dignity
even if one disagrees with him or
her.”
