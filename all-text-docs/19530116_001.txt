Erwin Gives Ideas
For Greek Week

To THE STUDENT Bopy:

As we approach the beginning of our second Greek Week,
I would like for you to understasid the purpose behind it. To
present it in the clearest manner, let us consider the problem
from several aspects.

First, let us look at some specific incidences that have
occurred in the past few years. Several years ago, two University
of California students received fatal burns from some nitrate
during a fraternity initiation. At Dickinson College, a boy died
of blood poisoning after an initiation. In 1949, at Brown Uni-
versity, Hell-Week ended in a free-for-all with two students
dead and many hospitalized.. A student at the University of
Alberta was dragged along corridors, beaten severely, and held
under a cold shower. He became hopelessly insane as a result of
this hazing. This list could be supplemented by a few incidents
that have occurred on this campus.

Is this your idea of mature, well-rounded fraternity men?
Is this your idea of testing a pledge to see if he can take it, to
see if he is worthy to become a brother?

Let us consider next the affects of Hell-Week. first on the
pledge. The main purpose of Hell-Week as I see it, is to climax
his entire pledge training period—the final test before he be-
comes a brother. But in most instances what does our Hell-
Week really test: whether he can steal or not, how long he can
go without sleep, how much physical punishment he can take?
Don’t get me wrong, I think some of the things that the pledges
go through during this week are helpful and constructive, but
I am definitely opposed to those things which are detrimental
to the pledge and destructive in nature.

Next let us consider the affects of Hell-Week on the general
public. For the past several years, one of the main topics of
discussion at the National Interfraternity Conference has been
that of public relations. A survey of fraternity publicity in the
leading papers in this country showed that 80 per cent of it
was unfavorable. The majority of these stories and articles had
to do with initiations and Hell-Week. A questionnaire was sent
to 40 newspaper editors in 40 major cities and to 10 papers
located in smaller college towns. Seventy per cent replied that
fraternities in their area were not showing greater maturity or
a sense of responsibility, and 81 per cent said that fraternities
were of little importance one way or another in their commu-
nity. From these statistics you can see what sort of an opinion
the general public has about fraternities.

"What can we do to provide a more practical and more fitting
climax to pledge. training? What can we do to better the final
test of the pledge? What can we do to correct this bad impres-
sion the public has about fraternities?

The answer is very simple: Institute a Greek Week. The
idea started at the University of Indiana in February, 1949, by
the pledge master of the local ATO chapter. The new twist to
Hell-Week spread to the other fraternities on the campus and
with the help'of the merchants of Bloomington, and civic an
charity organizations, they made a tremendous success. They
did such things as paint the community house, help needy fam-
ilies, and repaired many homes. The idea spread to other Mid-
Western colleges and now evidence of its presence can be found
in almost every college and university in America.

The spirit of Greek Week shouldn’t end or begin with
any specific week, but should be continuous throughout the
year. Participation should be by the brothers as well as the

ledges.
P a ask you, as mature fraternity men, to think about this
problem, to weigh the issues carefully, and if you feel as I do,
to resolve to do everything you possibly can to make this coming
Greek” Week an overwhelming success.

Quips and Cranks

Union Committee
Goes To Meet

To Use Full Names

Following the policy of many
annuals of the past, the 1953 Quips
and Cranks staff will this year use
students’ full names, unless in-
dividual students request other-
wise.

The majn reason for using the
full name, rather than initials, is
that this has been found best for
recollection and identification of
classmates by. name in the year-
book several or more years after
graduation.

This policy also provides for uni-
formity of names throughout the
book.

The staff will be glad to
make exception for anyone
wishing to be listed in Quips
and Cranks in another form.
Students wishing to be listed by

other than their full names should
notify Managing Editor Jim Speed
in room 108 West. Such arrange-
ments foust be made by the begin-
ning of second semester.

Mr. Shaw Smith, director of the
College Union, and several mem-
bers of the David Ovens College
Union Committee attended a con-
ference at the University of Geor-
gia in Athens, Ga., last Friday and
Saturday.

At this conference were delega-
tions from UNC, N.C. State, Da-
vidson, University of Georgia, Uni-
versity of Florida, Auburn and
WCUNC.

The conference was held in order
that members from the various col-
leges would be able to exchange
ideas as to their own union opera-
tion, organization, costs, and pro-
gtams with other members. This
exchange of ideas took place on
Saturday afternoon.

The conference ended with a
dance in the University of Georgia’s
Memorial Hall Saturday night. The
Davidson delegation returned to
Davidson immediately following
the dance.

Starting next year Honorary Scholarships will be given to
{ncoming freshmen at Davidson. At a recent meeting of the
faculty it was decided that Davidson needed more scholarships

The point was made that in view
of rapidly increasing scholarship
opportunities at other institutions,
‘Davidson needs such scholarships
in order to insure the flow of .top-
quality students to the campus.

These new scholarships are sub.
ject, of course, to the approya! of
the persons donating them. In prac-
tice the scholarship funds of the
college have been pooled for in-
vestment purposes and have been
used almost exclusively for grants-
in-aid in which need rather than
merit has received the primary em-
phasis.

The program that will now go
into effect will set aside part of
these funds, a maximum of $5,220,
out of a total of $15,000, for gen-

The Davidson College rifle team,
with Capt. Walter Blanton as its
officer-in-charge, and Sgt. John
Butts as coach, took a close de-
cision from VMI Saturday in a
shoulder to shoulder match.

Highest individual scorer in the
match, which marked the ninth
shoulder to shoulder match for the
Davidson team this year, was Bob
Garrison of Davidson with a score
of 376.

Other top scorers for Davidson
were Pete Robertson with 371; Bill
Keiter, 370; Dick Hobson, 366;
and Lee Scott with 362 points. Ten
men shoot for each side in each
match, but only scores of the top
five are given.

The final score gave David-
son 1845, while VMI's total
was 1841. This was the first
time Davidson's rifle team had
defeated VMI, and it left the
team with a record of three
wins in five shoulder contests,
and 12! wins in 14 postal
matches.

Re Announces Its

Semester Program

Second semester programs and
activities of Scabbard and Blade
were announced at Tuesday’s meet-
ing by the program chairman, Pres-
ton Chaney.

Dr. Tai Wilson will be the guest
speaker at February 10th meeting,
speaking on Nazism and the at-
tempted assassinations of Hitler.

On March 10 Dr. C. A. Eber-
hardt will speak on Palestine,
Egypt, and the Middle East situa-
tion. These two talks will be open
to all ROTC students.

The spring Military Ball is ten-
tively scheduled for the first week-
end in April in conjunction with
the Salem-Davidson activities.

Col. Carl McGee G-3 of Third
Army, will visit the fraternity to
speak on the very current subject
of guerrilla and anti-guerrilla war-
fare in Korea. He is an expert in
this field and has just recently re-
turned from the battlefront.

Spring Tap Day will be held on
April 21 at a regimental parade.
At this ceremony the ROTC stu-
dents in the junior and senior
classes who have qualified them-
selves for membership will be

IPC President Lawrence Erwin
revealed on Monday that Greek
Week would be held during the
second week of February on Tues-
day, Wednesday, and Thursday, the
10th, 1th, 12th, with all eleven fra-
ternities and the Campus Club tak-
ing an active part in the program.

This is the second year that such
a program has been attempted on
the Davidson campus.

The announcement came follow-
ing the second of two important
joint meetings of the Inter-Frater-
nity Council and the pledge masters
of the respective organizations.

The plans have received the
whole-hearted approval of these
two groups who have worked
together in order to offer a bet-
ter and more instructional pro-
gram for all involved.

Erwin stated, “The IPC regrets
that the schedule of Greek Week
will conflict with the band tour,
but with the many other scheduled
college events it was impossible to
avoid some conflict.

It is hoped that the student
body will participate in this
event 100 per cent, and if any-
one has any suggestions or
criticisms, please make them
known before the Week begins
in order that they may be
judged and evaluated.”

Included in the “Week” will be
activities of interest to both brothers
and pledges. I: is hoped in this
manner to foster a more successful
program than was carried out fast
year, with emphasis being placed
not only on the will to work to-
gether, but also on the ability to
work as individual pledge classes.

Following ROTC drill on
Tuesday afternoon, the pledges
will begin a systematic collec-
tion campaign, canvassing Da-
vidson and the immediate sur-
rounding areas for books and
magazines to be contributed *to
the Mecklenburg County Home.
This combined project is felt to

he one that is worthwhile and ex-
tremely adaptable to Greek Week.
Exchange suppers will be held at
the boarding houses with pledges

Coffee During Exems

Coffee and doughnuts will be
served at the student Union from
9 to 12 p.m, throughout the ex-
amination period under the joint
sponsorship of the Union and the
Y Cabinet.

A minimum charge will be made
for the service. Earnest Barry,
member of the cabinet, urges the
student body to pay for the coffee
and doughnuts in order to make
the proposition pay for itself and
to enable its continuance.

Continuing this year’s artist

They were Dr. Frontis Johnston,
Mr. Paul K. Scott, director of

Placement Program
For Seniors Begins

Placement activities will begin
immediately for the Senior Class,
according to publicity director,
John Dillon.

Unless students have definitely
accepted a position upon gradua-
tion, they are urged to sign up for
the placement list as soon as possi-
ble in room 104, Chambers Build-

This very definitely includes

all men who are in ROTC or
have a 1-A classification. There
are only a very few companies
who will not interview a senior
because he is in the ROTC.

Between February 1 and grad-
uation there will be representatives
of approximately 35 to 40 firms
on the campus. Almost every type
of industrial and business form will
be covered, including the Colgate-
Palmolive-Peet Co., Hanover Bank,

Millikan Corporation, and Travelers
Insurance Co.

turned from Red China where he
was confined by the Communist
Government for three and a_ half
years. He recounted his many ex-
periences with the Communists and
spoke of their attitude and dealings
with him and other American and
Chinese missionaries.

He told of the tactics of mass
education and reorganization
that accompanied the new
form of government. The Red
Government had begun many
worthwhile and beneficial proj-
ects to raise the standard of
living, but had sought to de-
stroy the individual freedom
of action and thought.

He said that the Communists
had not entirely prohibited the
religious worship services and he
saw no immediate danger due to
the vast number of Chinese Chris-
tians in the country.

Born of missionary parents at
Kashing, Chekiang province, China,
he spent his boyhood there, study-
ing at home and in Chinese schools.
He came to the U.S. at’ the age of
15 where he received an A.B. at
Davidson, B.D. at Columbia Uni-
versity, and a Ph. D, at Yale Uni-
versity.

He has been a Presbyterian mis- ©
sionary to China since 1923 serving
as professor at Hangchow Chris-
tian University for two years and
at Nangking Theological Seminary
for 18 years.

In China during the war against
Japan, he was engaged in liaison
service between Chinese Govern-
ment and the AAF in China. He
served as assistant to the Chinese
delegation at the UN in 1945 at
San. Francisco.

On returning to China in 1948,
he took up the new work as a mis-
sionary secretary of the Church of
Christ in China. He is the author of
numerous books and articles, the
latest being “China: Twilight or
Dawn.”

Wilson Speaks
On Nazi Germany

There are certain elements in
the political life of the U.S. which,
if unchecked, could lead to a dic-
tatorship like that of Nazi Germany
according to Prof. Iain Wilson.
Prof. Wilson, who has had contact
with Germany as student, soldier,
and reconstructor, presented this
analogy in a talk at a recent meet-
ing of the International Relations
Club.

Prof. Wilson bases this opinion
on his impression that. in recent
years there has been a growth of.
aggressive nationalism in some
areas of American life. Nationalism
of this type was certainly a main
resource of the Nazis in their mas-
tery of Germany. Speaking on “The
Fall of Nazi Germany,” he gave
an account of the rise of Hitler and
