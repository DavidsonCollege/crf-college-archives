Union Café reacts to
disrespectful students

By SUMMERLEE WALTER
Senior Staff Writer

The Union Café late night staff
have reported an increase in
instances of abusive student behav-
ior on Wednesdays and weekends
this semester.

According to Director of
Auxiliary Services Richard Terry,
the staff has commented especially
on the increase in the number of
inebriated students causing prob-
lems on Wednesdays.

Terry said that the Café staff tol-
erates general boisterousness,
rowdy behavior and even, to a cer-
tain extent, cursing, as long as it is
not directed toward staff members.

Problems arise when students
address staff members disrespect-
fully and unleash their frustrations
concerning Café policies on

employees who have no influence
over the setting of such policies.

“The person working the register
has absolutely nothing to do with
setting prices,” Terry said. “The
person closing the doors has
absolutely nothing to do with the
Café hours, but students are taking
their frustrations out on these indi-
viduals.”

According to Director of Dining
Services Dee Phillips, Café
employees understand that students
might have questions about Café
policies and prices.

Recently, though, a simple ques-
tion has elevated to shouting, pro-
fanity and aggressiveness.

Associate Director of Dining
Cash Operations Ed Rutkowski
said that aggressive student behav-

fast dedication.”

chotherapist Lisa Robinson, a

ical effects of the disease.

College to host gay
alumni this weekend

By COLLEEN McKown
Senior Staff Writer

The Alumni Office will sponsor
a Gay Alumni Weekend this Friday
and Saturday.

Director of Alumni Relations
Matt Merrell planned the gathering
in response to requests from gay
alumni.

“Many of our gay and lesbian
alumni had a difficult time at
Davidson solely because of their
sexual orientation,” said Merrell.
“This weekend helps to remind our
alumni that the college values
them, that they are important mem-
bers of the Davidson family and
that the college remains committed
to offering support for all of its stu-
dents on campus.”

The gathering will begin with a
dinner on Friday featuring
Davidson graduate and civil rights
activist Anne Stanback ’81.

Stanback serves as director of
Love Makes a Family, an organiza-
tion founded in 1992 that supports
families that struggle with the dis-
crimination that results from sexu-
al orientation.

On Saturday morning, the alum-
ni will attend a breakfast reception
at President Bobby Vagt’s house.

For lunch, students and alumni
will gather for a roundtable discus-
sion.

According to Merrell, planning

the weekend was somewhat of a
challenge.

“The College has difficulty iden-
tifying our gay and lesbian alumni
since we do not request any infor-
mation on our surveys about sexu-
al orientation. We have, therefore,
had to identify this group through
informal means,” Merrell said.

While planning the weekend’s
events, Merrell sought input from
students in Davidson’s Gay
Straight Alliance (GSA).

GSA President Sam Hotchkiss
08 worked with the Alumni Office
and fellow GSA members to coor-
dinate planning.

Hotchkiss and other GSA mem-
bers plan to attend the dinner on
Friday night, as well as the break-
fast and the roundtable discussion
on Saturday.

According to Hotchkiss and
Merrell, Davidson has changed
dramatically in the past five years
in regards to tolerance of homosex-
uality.

“T have [felt] very comfortable at
Davidson, and not had any prob-
lems in terms in terms of harass-
ment regarding my sexual orienta-
tion. This will be a time for alumns
who had a hard time here to see
how much Davidson has changed,”
Hotchkiss said.
