Award Established
To Honor Novelist

Dr. Cumming Announces The
Vereen Bell Prize for Crea-
tive Writing

Announcement was made by Dr.
W. P. Cumming last Thursday
morning of the establishment of
the Vereen M. Bell Memorial Award
for Creative Writing. This award
will be made annually to the stu-
dent who presents the best piece of
original writing during the year.

COMMEMORATED

Yereen-M,-Bell,-a—Davidson-grad-}—

uate of the Class of 1932, was killed
in action during the Battle of the
Philippines Sea in 1944. He was
serving as Air Combat Intelligence
Officer aboard the Carrier Gambier
Bay when it was sunk in a surprise
attack by the Japanese. When he
entered the Navy in 1943, Bell was
recognized as one of: the South’s
most outstanding writers. His first
novel, “Swamp Water,” was a best

“Seller and was later adapted to the
movies. Both “Swamp Water” and
“Y'wo of a Kind,” his second novel,
were stories of his native Georgia
and depicted the outdoor life around
his home in Cairo, Ga., that he loved
so well. He had also written numer-
ous articles-and short stories for
the leading magazines in this coun-
try.

Mr. Bell was the son of Chief
Justice R. C. Bell of the Georgia
Supreme Court and Mrs. Jennie
Vereen Bell. His wife, Mrs. Florence
Daniel Bell, and two sons are now
residing in Georgia.

The award is made _ possible
through the founding of a fund by
relatives and former college friends
of the author who wish to honor
those traits of character that made
him so popular throughout the
country and to recognize his contri-
bution to the American literary
field. Mr. Grier Martin, a former
alumni secretary of Davidson and a
classmate of Bell's, was chiefly re-
sponsible for the procuring of this
creative writing fund for the col-
lege. It was through his efforts
that the idea of such an award was
carried to full realization. The
fund contains $2,000.00 of which
fifty dollars will be given annually
to the most original writer. All
manuscripts for this year’s contest
must be submitted by April 1.

Dr. Cumming said that it is the
hope. of the college and the Eng-
lish Department to eventually se-
cure money whereby nationally
known authors may be invited to
the college to speak, and to remain
a few days for consultation with
students on literary matters:

Swink Announces
Revision of Mag

By Sam Robinson

It’s here, Gents! Revised, re-
formed, rejuvenated, promising to
be the most re-read volume of
Scripts ‘n Pranks ever to hit David-
son’s campus, your own copy of the
College humor magazine will be in
the mails by Saturday, March 1.
Your harassed reporter, after chas-
ing down many fallagious rumors,
has finally - received word from
Rditor Doug Swink that the ‘minor
technicalities which prevented the
distribution of the Winter Issue at
the previously set date have been
overcome, and at last it’s on its way.

As announced before, the featur-
ed articles, “Murder At The Library
Window,” “Accidents And Crashes,”
and “Bedlam” will be presented,
along with many items of humor
and interest. Although the “Valen-
tine” cover and flavor of the maga-
zine is a bit belated, we know that
matters of the heart never grow
old.

But, folks, don’t forget, that in
this issue of Scripts ’n Pranks you
will find THE contest—the tHing
that the whole campus will be talk-
}-ing-about—filled with thrills an
excitement and interest for all. And
there will be prizes, too, for the
most able contestants among the
student body. So get ’em while
they’re hot, don’t hesitate! You'll
find your copy well worth the wait!

Pictured above is the late Vereen
Bell, in whose memory the literary
award is keing given.

Bonish Wit.
Such humor is always to be
found in what perhaps is the high-
light of every meeting—the min-
utes of the previous meeting as
written by the Chapter’s able séere-
tary, Mae Jeffries. At the present
meeting his description ofva faculty
member’s paper on his experiences
of World Was I was typical:

“The whole of his tale to re-scan
Would certainly be out of hand.
Suffice it to say,

That we slept all the way

From; Winchester Square to
Sedan.”
The papers presented on the

night’s program all centered about
army life. Ed Sutton wove a tale
of woe, in which he’was impaled by
the horns of dilemma in a typical
army SNAFU. Professor Wood
presented a paper describing a G.I.’s
experience in an army court martial,
with interesting character studies
of all those involved in the trial.
Mac Jefferies played a dual role in
the,program and also presented his
share of the war stories. Of the
three incidents from the military
experiences which he recounted to
the group, it is sufficient, to note
that the phrase, “With my carbine
at Port-Arms”, appeared all
three of the anecdotes.

Feed
The meeting was concluded with
what was normally referred to as
the “feed.” “Feed-Master” Sutton,
who decries the fact that Davidscn
offers no Home Economies course,
produced an assortment of scraps

in

d which led the secretary to write:

“It’s plain. our food’s in the rults,

And the fault is obviously Sutt’s.

Two stale bits of bread,

Some sour sandwich spread,

And, of course, there’s that hand-
ful of nuts.”

COLLEGE PLATES

The college has just announced
the arrival of a shipment of
Davidson College commemora-
tive plates. These plates, made
of Wedgewood, are manufactur-
ed in Eturia, England and are
available in four colors—Mul-
berry, Blue, Rose, and Green for
two dollars apiece. Special car-
tons are provided for mailing.
Please ask at the alumni office
for additional information.

Davidson Band

Completes Tour

On the night of Thursday, Feb-
ruary 28, the Davidson Symphonic
Band returned to the campus after
completing a four day concert tour
through South Carolina and Geor-
yvia. This was the first concert tour
of any length for any Davidson
musical organization 1942,
and judging from the reactions of

since

the audiences, the band lived up
quite ably to its advance billing as
the “best concert band in the South.”
Under the direction of James
Christian Pfohl, head of the David-
Department, the band
presented a wide variety of numb-
ers, ranging from the novelty num-
ber, “Pop Goes The Weasel,” to
classical gofférings as the
Bach-Albert “Chorale and Fugue in
G Minor.”
