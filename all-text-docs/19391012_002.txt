Rear Admiral Dewey sailed into Manila

_have been a heavy load on Ameriean hearts

Concerning Narrow Minded
People

A group of Davidson students came face _
to face with one of the finest examples of
one-sided thinking in modern history last _
week when it heard Vincenti Villamin, noted

“Philippifie lawyer and economist, plead for
continued American rule in his homeland.
Actually, a native Philippino stood before
a public gathering and denounced the leg-
islation which was so benevolently enacted
less than a decade ago to grant complete
national: freedom to his race.. The speaker ~
was not a traitor sneaking about a foreign

_country in exile; he was a man whose word

ANOTHER DENOMINATIONAE
SCHOOL

One htindred miles south of Nash-

ville, ‘Tenn., there is a Wniversity *

built upon a foundation of solid °
tock and stone. The University of

the South, founded by the Episco-.
palians, rests in a setting as serene
and tranquil as does the sun, when
it disappears behind the last moun-
tain. I had the privilege of visiting
this school several weeks ago, and
while there, the natural compari-
son between that school and my
own was evident. Two observations
were paramount: First, that all stu-
dents wore coats and ties to class-
es, and second, that Seniors always
wore their black graduation robes.
Aside from this marked difference,
the Sewanee men act as does a Da-
vidsonian; they all are true gentle-
men,
