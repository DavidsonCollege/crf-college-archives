“The Haunted House”’ Is
Presented at Davidson

By Local Dramatic Club

Red and Black Masquers Present |
Their First Three-Act Perform-
ance of the Year

PLAYERS ARE WELL CAST

Play Is a Mixture of Sustained Mys-
tery and Humor

A large and appreciative audience witnessed |

the Red and Black Masquers’
“The Haunted House’ by Owen Davis last
Friday night. in Chambers Auditorium. Every-
one was held in a state of doubt and anxiety un-

til the final curtain, By stage effects and ghast- |

ly noises a supernatural and sometimes stréined

atmosphere was effected. Only at happy. inter- |

vals was the intensity broken by roaringly good
humor. This mixture of mystery and humor sea-
soned with a bit of love made a combination
that proved a big success. This is the Dramatic
Club’s first three-act performance
and because it went over in such
was shown again last Monday
Springs, and will be shown at a
Queens-Chicora College.

The adroit selection of the cast by Prof. FE.
J. Erwin, faculty advisor, showed the work of
a master and one experienced in the art of
play producing. Most of them are old hands
and the footlights here at Davidson are by no
means new to them, This experience among the

of this year,
a big way it
at Barium
later date

characters helped to whip the play into fine |

shape and make it the hit that it was.

As to just which one of the comedians
brought down the house the most would be im-
possible for one to decide. Dave MeClain and
Gordon Wood, those two inimitable
were unsurpassed in their roles. McClain, the!
deep-thinking but shallow-brained, cocky and |
garrulous detective right hot from New York |
with his cigar and tjlted derby, proved a con-
trast to equally comical Gordon Wood,
the listless but well-meaning sheriff who col-
lapsed at every mention of blood, Jack Wil-
liams, who also played in “Bound East for
Cardiff,’ very skillfully portrayed the humor-

the

ous character, the milkman. Horace Erwin took |

the part of the novelist, a character who Was
more amusing than funny. His solution of the |
plot by psychoanalysis proved somewhat a fail- |
ure, but his plea for “Cherchez la femme!” was
* answered by a familiar stage character, Bill Mc-
Ilwinen, in a role of a woman.

Miss Mcl.emore and Jimmy Simpson, who
have worked together before in similar parts, |
were aptly cast as the bride and groom, new
residents in the haunted house, Other parts were
filled as follows: the tramp, A. Rachal; the
chauffeur, E. A. Hancock: the wife, Miss Mof-
fett, and the father, G. Womack.

Christmas Musical
To Be Held Sunday

Glee Club and Stringed Quartet Will
Furnish Music for This Very
Popular Vesper Service

Plans are forming for the “Y” Christmas
vesper service to be held in Chambers
torium, Sunday, December 20, 1931. This sacred
service will mark the close of vespers this year
and because of its beauty is always anticipated
with a great deal of interest.

It has been the custom to have such a serv- |

ice like this for some time. The students and
people of Davidson consider it one of the best
services of the entire school year.

Music will be furnished by the Glee Club, |

the stringed quartet and the organ. The stage |

will be decorated with pines, firs and hemlocks |
arranged in symmetrical order toward the front |
of the stage so that those who take part are |
hidden from view. Above all a star will hang |

and along the sides of the auditorium candles
are to be placed in the windows.

The order of the program is: first, the prelude
followed by the processional, The invocation |
will be given by one of the several students

taking ‘part. Both the prophecy and the nativi ity |

will be read as part of the exercises as well |
as the coming of the shepherds and wise men.

The service will end with a benediction. The |

programs are to be printed! and will add much
to the effectiveness of the occasion. Christmas

carols will be sung by both the audience and
the Glee Club.

Freshman Banquet

The annual Freshman banquet is to
be given Friday night, December 18,
at 9 o'clock in the banquet hall of the
Chambers Building. The banquet this
year, which is to be given in the form
of a supper-smoker, is sponsored by
the Omicron Delta Kappa fraternity.
The program of the evening, which is
usually featured by talks, is not com-
plete at present. It is expected, how-
ever, that Captain Pritchett, Mr.
Jackson, and Dean Williams, who have
made the talks for the last two years,
will. also make them this year. These
banquets are given each year for the
purpose of bringing the Freshman
class as a whole closer together and
to let them begin to feel that they
are becoming members of the student

body.
