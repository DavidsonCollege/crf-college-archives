Side Line Shots
Helping to Put the Wildcats

er
By “Felix”

Interest in the college is fast reaching
fever heat as the cage encounter with
Duke's speedy Blue Devils draws near.
Monday will see a student body united for
the common cause of “Downing Duke.”

Davidson has always given the Devils
trouble in the basketball aspirations.
Last year and year before the Cats sprung
great upsets to crash the “Money Boys”
from Durham.

The 1930 edition of Blue Devil Basket-
ball is riding far and wide. Publicity men
claim steadfastly that the Methodists are
better than the only team to defeat them,
Washington and Lee. They point to thé
victory over Navy as proof enough of
the team’s greatnéss. True enough, but
we note that several quints have taken
Navy in tow lately by sizeable scores,

In the eyes of many newspapers and
coaches, the Devils have already won the
conference title. We won't be surprised
to see them do it. One thing sure, though—
the Duke men are going to find it easier
to win a lot of those tournament games
than to beat Monk Younger’s Wildcats
next Monday night.

Apparently invincible odds make the
Wildcats wilder than ever, and we are
counting on that fact to give Duke all she
can stand, On paper it’s hard to see where
Davidson has a chance to do anything but
put up a fight, but we believe there’s a
probable win in view, and the old-time
scrap may put that very thing across.

Moving that game to Charlotte didn’t
help matters the least bit. It hurt the
chances of the Cats, for playing on their
home court, they would have been a good
deal more dangerous. Wish for the best,
though.

It’s up to the whole student body to
turn out for that clash, Boys can always
ways get to Charlotte if they try hard
enough, and’ surely Monday is the time
for all loyal sons to run to the aid of
their team. Get in there behind them.. It
may be the means to victory.

Well, if these freshmen keep on winning
games, we'll have to get a new score book
and put, it in the memorial room. Red
Laird has developed a great little team,
and the varsity next year is going to be
the gainer when the new men come out.

Wake Forest.sent a good yearling team
up to the Cat Lair. They had previously
defeated State and Carolina by good
scores and lost to Duke by a few points.
The Baptists didn’t seem to be in the
class of the young Cats, however.

The shooting and passing of Captain
Pierce leaves little to be desired. That
boy must have been raised on a court. He
is one of the best prospects to reach Dav-
idson in years. Peabody is another sterling
performer. His floorwork is fine to be-

hold.

N. C. State was rather fortunate to knot
the count on Tilson’s wrestlers last week.
That injury to Russell was a bad break
for the Cats. The chances are that he
would have been thrown. In that event,
the match would have gone to Davidson.

Davidson is piling up points now where
she lost them in past years—in the heavy
weights. The grapplers will have a Tar-
tar on hand when Carolina sends her mat-
men here next week. A win there would
boost stock considerably.

Russell Receives Severe Spinal Blow in
Match—Injury Said Not Serious

In a very close match last Saturday after-
noon the wrestling teams of Davidson and
North Carolina State fought to a draw with
each team scoring. 15 points. The match was
held in the Thompson gymnasium at Raleigh.
Two of the matches were won by the Tech-
men on falls. They also gained five more
points when Jeb Russell of Davidson was
injured and defaulted in the 145 pound class.
The Wildcats won the other five matches on
time advantages. ;

After four minutes of close fighting with
Smithwick, Russ@ll received a severe spinal
jar. In a quick rally near the center of the
mat, Smithwick secured a body hold-to throw
Russell heavily to the mat. Coming down
on his head, Russell threw the entire weight
of his body on his spine. Dr. Ray Sermon,
State trainer,
said the injury was not serious. He was im
mediately taken to the college infirmary.
