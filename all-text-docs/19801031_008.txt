Soccer edges WCU 1-0
after 2-0 loss to Winthrop

By STEVE SOUD
Staff Writer

Soccer Coach Charlie Slagle
has been rather depressed these
past few weeks, but, alas, hope
springs eternal. A glimmer of a
smile returned to his face after
his team earned a split in its last
two outings, bringing the sea-
son record to 8-6, with three
games left.

All was consistent, but not
well, as the team lost at
Winthrop last Wednesday. The
only two goals came about
midway through the first half.
The first goal stemmed from a
miscommunication between

-_ Goalie Mike Iordanou and de-

fensive fill-in Todd Beck. The
ball was intercepted and Win-

_, throp ‘scored easily.

The second goal was scored
on a penalty kick following’ a
handball call. ‘‘We didn’t play
with very good intensity,”’ said
Slagle. “With our amount of
intensity, we didn’t deserve to
win.’”’

Charlie Slagle was able to
start smirking a little Sunday,
though the team played West-
ern Carolina on their astroturf,
and many of the team’s juniors
had flashbacks to the game
when they got blown off that
same field as freshmen. The
astroturf inhibited the David-
son style of play, making short
passes out of the question.

However, all of the adversity

of being away, playing an
astroturf, and competing in
front of a Homecoming crowd
was offset by what Slagle
described as ‘‘the best intensity
of the season.”

The lone goal of the contest
came with about 16:00 left on
the first half clock. Bill Wahl
took a free kick on the left side
of the cage and booted it clear
across to the right side, where
Alex McCallie footed it in.

The real test came in the
second half, though, as the
Wildcats snuffed any offensive
spark Western Carolina dared
to ignite. ‘‘Iordanov wasn’t
even tested the last thirty
minutes of the game,” added

Slagle.

The junior goal keeper, who
made a diving save early in the.
first half, was instrumental in
the win as a team leader. Slagle
of the season.

Should the booters win their
last three games, all at home,
they would tie a Davidson
record of eleven wins in a
season. A physical Wofford
team comes to Davidson this
Saturday. ‘

- Should the team beat East
Tennessee State a week from
Saturday, that would insure
them a fourth-place Southern
Conference finish, a one-place
improvement over last year.

Hockey goes to tourney with 9-3 record

By ANNE HOCKETT
Staff Writer

Davidson went on to beat
Winthrop 6-1 last Wednesday,
bringing their regular season to
a victorious end. The record
stands at 9-3 as they head to
Duke today for the State Tourn-
ament.

Lisa Ballantyne led the squad
with 3 goals against Winthrop
followed by Craig, Heppner and
Cathy Inabnet with one goal
apiece.

Coach Dee Dee Mayes said
she was pleased with the team’s
overall performance especially
in the first half. As soon as time

Leslie Bryan and Laura Hills
entered the game in the second
half to lend their skills to the
offense. Neither of these two
players had played hockey be-

with their ‘‘continual support
and progress.”

The regular season ended
with a total of 39 goals scored.

The five of them form a
suprisingly unified group. The
unique sound they create trans-
forms some traditions;Ted a-
grees that the group doesn’t try
to recreate the exact way a
song was played when they
encountered it.

Ted’s concern for the present
allays any fears for the future.
As long as the group continues
to explore, to create, and espec-
ially to perform, he is happy.
“Music is first. We believe in
what we’re doing. People and
music—they go together.”

Heppner totalled 7, Courtney
Hall 3, Sally Craig 2, Barb
Ashley 1, and Amy Critten-
berger 1—an impressive record
for a relatively low scoring
sport.

Today the team travels to
Duke for the State Tournament.
The Cats are seeded second only
to Pfeiffer in a six team draw.
Davidson has a bye for the first
round of competition and will
play the winner of the 3rd and
5th seeds on Thursday at 3:30
(probably High Point). Pfeiffer
will play the winner of the 2nd
and 4th seeds (most likely
Catawba). Hopefully, the Cats
will advance to the finals to be
played at 1:00 on Friday.

If Davidson wins the State,
they will go on to Regional
Competition, Nov. 7-8th. If
they do not win the State, they
still have the option of going on
by placing an “‘at large bid.”
_ Six teams go to the Regionals
High Point (as the host of the
tourney), the State winners for
Virginia, North and South Car-
olina, and two ‘‘at large teams.”
With Davidson’s seasonal re-
cord, they have a good chance
at one of these positions.

' This Saturday and Sunday
the Deep South selections will
take place. If the Cats don’t win
the State they are still eligible
for individual team member
selections. Coach Mayes is conf-
ident that Davidson will be
represented in these selections.
