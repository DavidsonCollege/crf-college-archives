WHO'S WHO AND WHERE.

For several weeks short accounts of
certain Davidson men who have risen to
positions of prominence in the army have
appeared in this paper. For the benefit
of its readers The Davidsonian is pub-
lishing in this issue a full list of all
alumni who have risen in the service as
high as the position of captain. [t is to
be noted that 28 captains, 8 majors, and
2 lieutenant-colonels appear on the list.
Taking into consideration the fact that
Davidson has never at any time before
this war had a system of military train-
ing, but has been purely an academic
institution, the above figures are to be
appreciated :

Y. M. C. A. HEARS EXCEL-
LENT ADDRESS BY MR. MILES

The “Y" vesper service last Sunday
evening was the last mecting presided
over by President Lilly. ‘The attend-
ance was good and the fellows gave
earnest attention to the speakers

The meeting was opened with singing,
after which Mr. Miles took charge of the
program. He spoke on the subject,

“Preparation and Co-operation.” He
read two passages from the Bible: one
from the story of David and Goliath,
the other from the story of Gideon and
the three hundred. “David was  pre-
pared,” he said, “he had made good use
of his time and practised constantly with
his sling.” He told of other men who
prepared ; how Christy Matthewson had
practised pitching through a knot hole in
a barn door, and how Sam White, the
famous Princeton end rush, who prac-
tised picking up the ball on the run,
thereby being ready to beat Harvard
when the game seemed lost. In the same
way we must get prepared in our spirit-
ual life, which is but a synthesis of all
our activities,

Gideon's three hundred are an ex-
ample of co-operation as well as prepara-
tion. From 1903 to 1908 the Cleveland
“Naps” never won the championship in
spite of the fact that their team was com-
posed of the best players in America.
They had no co-operation. Just so the
Spirit of Christ will hold society togeth-
er. His Spirit in us will help carry on
His Kingdom.

President Lilly then made a few fare-
well remarks “The co-operation of the
cabinet and. members has been an_ in-
spiration to me,” he said. Here are
three standards by which to test our
lives, either “Be satisfied with your
standing among your neighbors (but a
hypocrite can have a good reputation)’
or “Be pure and true to yourself. Are
you satified with your own life?” or
“Do you stand right with God? You

can't be YMC. A HEARS EXCEL __|ean't be neutral, you are either for 0 you are either for or
against Him.” “Tf you satisfy the last,
you satisfy all three.”

He closed his address by urging every-
body to back up the new officers and to
co-operate swith them.

GOLF.

Unusual interest and rivalry has been
shown on the golf course during the past
week. “Phe weather being excellent af-
forded an opportunity for the golfers to
work on the handicaps before the tourna-
ment.

Several of the players are expecting to
go to Charlotte soon and see the profes-
sionals, Jim) Barnes, Mike Brady, Ed
Fue and Carl Anderson, play. If you
will recall, Carl Anderson came up to
Davidson and explained a few of the
strokes to the club last year. So it will
be well worth while to see these games at
Charlotte and observe closely the move-
ments,

Dr. Arbuckle is hoping to have two
of the professionals here to give the club
a few pointers and new strokes.

YEARNINGS OF MANY HEARTS
ABOUT TO BE SATISFIED

That long-hoped-for improvement has
almost arrived, viz: the reconstruction
of the tennis courts. “Those who have
seen-the rolls af chicken wire may have
imagined that the college was going in
for poultry farming, but the fact of the
matter is that the tennis courts are going
to be put in shape for stopping a few
more of the wild shots, instead of neces-
sitating a hundred-yard dash after each
serve. Also posts has been erected on
the courts near the post office. So all
the artists of the raquet and sphere may
take heart and anticipate an opportunity
to follow their desires of indulging in
this pastime in the days to come, without
waiting two hours to play fifteen min-
utes.
