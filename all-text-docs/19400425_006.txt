dition of both rooms is not such

helpful if some way could be de-
vised to create more interest in

the “Y"” among the student body.
Somehow the “Y"” seems a little
too saintly and not quite human
enough.
Jim McCrary, Freshman:
Believing that the primary pur-
pose of the Y. M. C. A. is to pro-

Rev. J. M. Alexander
Is Vespers Speaker

“How Big Is Your World” Is
Subject of Fayetteville
Minister’s Talk

“How Big Is Your World”
was the theme of the regular

Sunday evening vesper ad-
dress delivered by Rev. John
M. Alexander of the First

Presbyterian Church of ‘Fay-
etteville, N.

He brought out the fact that it
all depends upon the standard of
measure used by an individual. The

acceptance of all conditions, wheth- !

er big, little, good, or bad depends
upon the qualities of your.own soul.
A person’s interest and @xperience
determine the size of your world.
Influences Life

Rev. Alexander stressed the point
that the mere size of a ‘person's
world about them is not the only
factor that influences his life in re-
spect to that world. He reminded
us that there is a spiritual and mor-
al world for us. All we have to do
is to accépt it.

“There are ~many stupendous
statements in the Old Testament,”
he said. “God created man; He
breathed the breath of life into

him; He created everything under
the sun and yet He gave man—
mere man, as we are—dominion ov-
er them all. He gave us natural
laws to control the other beings
on this earth. He put these laws
here for us to put to use. We have
dominion over nature, animals, etc.,
but what about dominion over our-
selves?” He brought out that the
governing of human nature is the
most difficult thing for us to do.

Dimensional World

It is a dimensional world in which
we live, he brought out. We know
distance, time, numbers, but do we
know where they lead us? As an
example, he told of a poor moun-
taineer who suddenly became rich
at the discovery of oil on his land.

After buying an automobile, he
sought to acquire an _ education.
When asked as to how he was

progressing in this latter objective,
he replied, “I can read the number
of miles on the sign post but I
can’t tell where to.”

-In conclusion, he answered the
question of his address, “How, Big
Is Your World?” by thé response,
“as big as you are.”

Swokers are buying ‘em

“two packs at a time” because Chest-
erfields are DEFINITELY MILDER, COOLER-

Chesterfields are made from the world’s
finest cigarette tobaccos and they’re made
right. In size, in shape, in the way they burn
. . . everything ‘about Chesterfield is just

right for your smoking pleasure.
