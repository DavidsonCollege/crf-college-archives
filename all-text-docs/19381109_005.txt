Conduct Services Sunday
At Unity Church

church that is unique in
its organization and its religi-
ous and social significance will
have its biggest day of the
year Sunday, November 13. It
is Davidson Unity church, a
congregation without denomi-
national lines and an institu
tion that has proved a treasure
ground of religious and socio-
logical study for Davidson col-
lege students: for many years.

Like the college from which it
takes its name, Unity church will
have a homecoming this Sunday.
Many of the old grads, who will
gather on the nearby campus Sat-
urday for the annual homecoming
there, will remain until the next

day to attend services at the church
which they served- as students.
Beginning at 10 o'clock with
Sunday school, the program will
include the regular morning church
o'clock followed by
a big homecoming dinner. Visiting
choirs and quartets will join with
the
from one

service at 11

congregation at a song service
o'clock to 3 o'clock, and

an evening service will close the
day. Filling the pulpit Sunday
morning will be the Rev. Don
3randon of Richmond, Va., and
that evening the Rev. Albert Mc-
Clure of Lincolnton, both former
pastors of the church while stu-

dents at Davidson.

The present church had its origin
ago, when a
