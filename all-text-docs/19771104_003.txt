African Community (EAC),
the bens-Am Railroad and the
Trans-Sahara highway.

The EAC was discontinued
this year, so Metzel plans to
study it to determirie the cause
and then compare the EAC
with the other two systems.

Metzel

“There is no transportation
infra stucture in Africa, ‘‘he
said. “Essentially I’m saying
this hurts African nations
because they can not engage in
trade.”

Richter’s project is ‘“‘an in-
vestigation of the Church-
State relationships in Sweden,
West Germany and East Ger-
many.”

In both Sweden and West
Germany the state controls
the main Church, while in
East Germany the State sup-
ports the Church financially
but the socialist party dis-
courages religion.

Richter ‘‘wants to see if
there is any connection be-

“tween State control and apa-
thy concerning the Church in
West Germany and Sweden,”
and whether the discrimina-
tion church goers receive in
East Germany affects their

attitudes.

He plans to interview mem-
bers of Church hierarchy, lay-
men and just men off the
streets in each of the three
countries, to ‘‘accumulate as
much information on the topic

as possible, trying to establish .

some kinds of trends.”

mittee who choose the Watson
nominees, including Dean of
Students Will Terry, Profes-
sor of Biology Cynthia Grant,
Professor of French Frank
Jacobus, Professor of Psycho-
logy John Brockway, Profes-
sor of German Hansford Epes,
Professor of Political Science
Harris Proctor, and students
Jim Ervin, Susan Baynard,
and Dave Keller, look for
“what we think the Watsons
look for,”’ according to Terry.

Terry said the Committee
asks, ‘‘Is the project durable?
Is it worthwhile? And then
(they decide) as best as we can
determine the way this person
would stack up in national
competition.”’

The interview usually deter-
mines the last point, according
te-him.

organic chemistry labs, two
classrooms and a seminar
room.

This phase will cost an
estimated $206,000. Dittman
comments, ‘‘Because
of the.importance of other

priorities, such as dining fa-
cilities, dorms an Arts build-
ing, etc., we cannot hope to
begin this phase for a long
time.”

In the past thirty years the
Dana Foundation has given
Davidson a total of $2,228,604
in five different grants.

International students talk
candidly about Davidson life

By GEORGE MURDAUGH

EMILY PARTIN

Staff Writers
“Before I came to America I

thought that the youth here
were all Hell’s Angels mem-
bers and drug addicts.”

This was the preconceived
notion formerly held by Yous-
sef Abagui, an Egyptian in-
ternational student here. Now
he says that idea of America’s
youth has been ‘‘shattered”’
for him.

Koji pointed out that Japan
is a country of one race of
people. Meeting Americans
with different ethnic back-
grounds has been especially
interesting for him.

Most of the foreign stu-
dents have not traveled e-
nough to know what America
is really like. All agree that
Davidson is definitely not
representative of the US as a
whole.

Each foreign student has a
faculty advisor and is as-
signed two courses per term.

Although most of these

students feel that a lot of

material is packed into each
ten week course, they say that
time limitations-don’t allow
for in-depth, critical analysis
of the subject: matter, which is
usually too shallow.

Several students expressed
feelings that Davidson stu-
dents do not sufficiently ques-
tion what they are being
taught. Discussion groups
and seminars are seen to be
more useful than lecture-ori-
ented classes.

According to Joerg, the
opportunities for free acade-
mic inquiry are present but
are not being used to their
potential.

The international wadente
have encountered varying de-
grees of difficulty with the
work load at Davidson, due to
language barriers, the types of
courses they are taking, and
the broadness of the curricu-
lum here.

Solange enjoys the liberal
arts emphasis found at David-
son. “In France you specialize
in education at an earlier
age.”

The International Students
generally feel that Davidson
students are friendly, easy to

Lid.

meet, and helpful.

Several, however, note that
it is difficult to develop close
personal relationships, due to
lack of time on the Davidson
student’s part.

“In spite of the fact that I
like the people here very
much, I hate to impose on
them. I am hesitant to go
knock on their door because I
know they have to study,’’
says Omaima.*

and so are enjoying experi-
encing a college community.

Finding enough privacy is a
problem for international stu-
dents. As is true for many
Davidson students, private
times and places are hard to
come by.

A couple of students are
impressed with the amount of
school spirit as evidenced at
athletic events. They also feel
that the combination of athle-

Vijay finds this to be true,
also. ‘‘When I have time to do
things, others don’t,’’ he says.

A number of students say
they are bored with Davidson
for various reasons. Some feel
that there are not enough
organizations or clubs on cam-
pus. Many international stu-
dents, accustomed to a big
city atmosphere, find the Da-
vidson’s community lacking in
cultural activities.

“Davidson College is not a
good school for international
students to come to because

they’re not here only to find °

academic experiences, they’re
here to learn more about the
country, get involved, and
meet people,’’ says Omaima.
“Here there is nothing to be
done.”’

On the other hand, some
students find that there is
always something. to do.
‘‘There’s always something
going on,’’ says Patricia.

Koji says that while he has
not been able to find many
kinds of entertainment out-
side of campus, he does fees
that the school tries to allevi-
ate the problem by presenting
a number of cultural and
social events.

Most of the students are not
used to living on a campus,

tics and academics, stressing
both physical and mental
growth, is a valuable ap-
proach to education.

Some of the students were
repulsed by the violence of
football. ‘‘Football is a combi-
nation of boxing, wrestling,
soccer, rugby, and judo,”’ said
Patricia.

Rory thought that students
here would be ‘‘very prim,
proper, and religious.’’ Since
coming to Davidson, he has
modified his-view somewhat.

A number of those inter-
viewed feel that Davidson
students are relatively conser-
vative and tend to come from
the upper-middle class.

It was noted that a number
of students on campus have
little or no interest in political
issues. Many of the Interna--
tional Students found this
surprising as they have come
from environments in which
politics play a large part.

They perceive that students
are inclined to relate to world
wide issues because they are
so immersed in their lives at
Davidson.

The International Students
hope to be able to see more of
the United States while they
are here if financial obstacles
can be overcome.
