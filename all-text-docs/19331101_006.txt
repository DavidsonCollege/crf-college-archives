Rev. E. A. Dillard
Talks at Vespers

Charlotte Pastor Is Heard With a
Great Deal of Interest

PAUL CITED AS EXAMPLE

Mr. Dillard Emphasizes the Im-
portance of Study

An unusually large student gather-
ing was present to hear the Reverend
E. A. Dillard, pastor of the Tenth
Avenue Church of Charlotte, at the
vesper hour last Sunday. evening. W. T.
Johnson had charge of the service and
introduced Reverand Dillard. Mr. Dil-
lard was educated at the University
of South Carolina, and at Presbyterian
College, and took his theological train-
ing at Columbia Seminary. After the
reading of the scripture, taken from
First Corinthians 9:12-22 by Mr. Dil-
lard, L. S. Gamble and R. H. Smith
led in prayer. Dave McLain then
brought a message in song, accom-
panied at the piano by K. M. Scott.

In his introductory remarks, Rev-
erend Dillard stated that he proposed
to speak on the practical things of our
every-day lives, the things that are
before us at the present time. As an
introduction to his remarks, he told a
story of a preacher in Georgia who,
while trying to pass a car, that car
suddenly, without warning, swerved
cut in front of him, and as a result,
both machines were demolished. For-
tunately, neither driver was injured.
The preacher took out some of his
righteous indignation on the man for
failing to give a signal that he was
going to turn, To this the man re-
plied: “Why, I turn here every day.”
It was of our every-day turns that
Mr. Dillard spoke.

He pointed out that our lives are
constantly swinging between success
and failure, Paul-was haunted by the
thought of becoming a castaway. This
did not mean that Paul was in danger
of rejection by Christ, but that he was
constantly afraid of being no longer
useful to Christ. The old engine which
used to make the run between Augusta
and Charleston is now only a subject
for exhibition—a castaway.
always working

Paul was

for Christ even in

prison and before judgment to keep
himself from being a castoff. Esau was
a castaway because of his appetite;
Sdul because of greed, and Samson be-
cause of selfishness. He showed that
a castaway is not a damned soul, but
a useless one.

Mr. Dillard said that the way to com-
bat this state of uselessness was to
take Paul's. words when he said:
“Study to show thyself approved.” He
pointed out that the big thing in col-
lege life is not our social nor athletic
success, but the way in. which we
study. Reverend Dillard said that we
study first to be certain of the future,
second, to be able to face men, third,
to be correct, and to know the truth,
and fourth, to obtain Divine approval.

In closing he showed that this study
was our every-day turn and that, if
we were diligent in it, we would not
become castaways, but men who will
be useful in service to God and our
fellowmen,

‘CATS WITH 14-7 SCORE

(Continued from page 5)

V. M. IL, showing a determination to
win which they have lacked in former
contests, came from behind to take the
favored Cavaliers of Virginia into
camp in an exciting game by a final
score of 13 to 12.

Presbyterian College was the power
behind the defeat of the Wofford Ter-
riers in the Terriers’ home-coming
celebration, and the home-town boys
were forced to reconcile themselves to
a thorough beating to the tune of 26-6.
Wofford’s offense was at no time able
to get going, and the Presbyterians
ran through them at will.

POETS OF ENGLAND ARE
DISCUSSED BY DR. MIMS

(Continued from page 1)

The second poem,: “Happy War-
riors,” by Wordsworth, concerns itself
with the essential greatness of the
English type of hero. This poem is a
favorite of many great men and quo-
tations from it have been used often.
Roosevelt is an example of one to
whom “thought of tender happiness
could not betray.” If any man ever
had a right to ease, peace, and quiet
it was Roosevelt. He fought a mighty
struggle. Yet he did not stop here,
but went on to gain the highest posi-
tion of trust in the Uo S., and this is
just the quality that characterizes one
as a “Happy Warrior.” There is a
very decided contrast between a “ Lost
Leader” and a “Happy Warrior,” the
latter benig the fulfillment of all that
the former gave promise of being.

Dr. Mims closed his address by mak-
ing a plea to the Davidson students to
be “Happy Warriors,” saying that
there were already enough “Lost Lead-
ers” who had miserably bungled their
lives.
