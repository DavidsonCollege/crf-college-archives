Red telephones installed on dorms

By Carrie Blackburn

ID-less students frantically
looking for someone to let them in
dorms is a problem of the past.
Red telephones installed outside
the main dorms in the past two
weeks enable people without ID/
access cards to call a friend inside
to open the door.

Ray Thrower, director of se-
curity, envisioned the telephones
as a “compliment to the card ac-
cess system,” which he cam-
paigned for several years ago. The
Student Government was not, how-
ever, initially interested in the tele-
phones, according to Thrower.

Thrower saw a need for tele-
phones because visitors, pizza de-
liverers, and students cannot enter
a dorm without a card. He also
praises the phones as an avenue for
those seeking the help of campus
police during an emergency.

With card access, students
could get in the dorms, but visitors
could not. Now students and visi-
tors alike can call someone for

admittance. When students are
uncomfortable letting a stranger in
the dorm, they can ask the person
to call someone inside, instead.

The connections were in-
stalled one month ago, and the.
telephones were added within the
last two weeks. The familiar red
phones are the same ones that are
in various buildings around cam-
pus. Resident Life paid for the
lines, and the telephones were
moved from their previous loca-
tions.

A new “hands-free system”
instantly connects a victim to the
police, by only pressing a button
onanemergency box. This system
will replace the red phones in the
academicand administrative build-
ings. The boxes immediately in-
form campus security where the
call was placed, expediting help in
an emergency.

Thrower says the red tele-
phones in Chambers were prob-
lematic because people used them
for ordinary conversations, tying

them up in emergencies. Also, the
police did not know where the
emergency calls were placed.

The new security measures
have been installed in the VAC,
DCPC, Dana Science and Cham-
bers. This summer, the elevators,
Martin Science building, the li-
brary (including the 24-hour room),
and Cunningham Fine Arts build-
ing will be included in the system.

- Akers, Irwin, and Knox, which
currently have neither card access
systems nor telephones, will re-
ceive both this summer. To in-
crease safety “down the hill” in the
meantime, an emergency call box
has been added tothe IMAC fields.

According to Thrower, stu-
dent response to the phones has
been favorable, as he expected
based of his experience at Queens
College.

As former Director of Public
Safety at Queens, Thrower helped
Queens become the-first school in
North Carolina to “go completely
card access.”

Freshmen, we need you to carry on the Davidsonian tradition.

Former Davidson
professor nominated
for Furman presidency

By Jeff Oller

Former Davidson history pro-
fessor David Shi remains one of
the final candidates in Furman
University’s search for its next
president.

Atthe end of last year, after 17
years of teaching at Davidson, Shi
accepted the job of Vice-President
of Academic Affairs and Dean of
Faculty at his alma mater, Furman,
in Greenville, South Carolina.

Shi suspects that. one of the
trustees.at Furman nominated him
for the position. Since his nomi-
nation, the search committee has
narrowed the original pool of 90
nominees down to about six, in-
cluding Shi.

According to the Furman Uni-
versity student newspaper, The
Paladin, the search committee con-
sists of seven trustees, two faculty
members, one student, one admin-
istrator, the chairman of the Advi-
sory Council, and the president-

elect of the Alumni Association.
Trustee and chair of the committee
Thomas S. Hartness hopes to meet
a June 1 deadline but says that the
committee will take necessary time
to make the right decision.

Shi explains his interest in
being Furman’s tenth president:
“Furman is poised in a dramatic
new era in its institutional history.
Furman has recently divorced it-
self from the South Carolina Bap-
tist Convention and is now wres-
tling with how to assert itself as an
independent liberal arts college.
Furman is defining a new era.”

Shi says he has “a genuine
passion for the welfare of Furman
University as an alma mater.”

As he teaches American In-
tellectual History and considers his
candidacy, Shi fondly remembers
his years as a Davidson professor.
He says, “My wife andI very much
remain loyal followers of
Davidson.”

New registration procedure

Drop continued from page 1

raise ceilings or grant prerequisite
wavers during the summer.

When students return in the
fall, another schedule adjustment
process will occur before the first
day of classes. In order to avoid
lines, students wishing to make
further changes will receive a ran-
domly-assigned appointment to go
through regular drop/add. For
freshmen this process will take
place for three hours on August 26
and, for all other students, for four
hours on August 28.

Students. can continue to
change their schedules for two
weeks following the first day of
classes on August 29.

Griffin says that she and oth-
ers felt that something had to be
done to change the previous sys-
tem. She says, “The panic at drop/

oO

sh

add was so troublesome. We think
people will have more time to fo-
cus on their schedules and to make
better decisions during the sum-
mer.” Jennifer Humphrey, asenior
member of the Council on Aca-
demic Affairs, believes that the
decision-making process behind
these changes successfully in-
volved joint representation from
faculty, students, and the adminis-
tration. She adds that there isroom
for fine tuning any problems that
arise during the summer or in the
fall. S
Griffin asks anyone with ques-
tions to call the Registrar’s Office
or to speak with her in person. She
has met with the faculty and hall
counselors about the new system
and plans to talk to resident advi-
sors next week. After fall registra-
tion the administration will reevalu-
ate the process and make changes. -
