The Sports
Authority:

Left turns

By Davip MortTLock

Sports Columnist

It was 3 a.m. and I was eat-
ing an early breakfast in a
Mocksville, NC diner. Staring
at my plate of grits, I couldn’t
help overhearing the conversa-
tion of three men sitting several
seats away.

“Did you watch the race on
Sunday? That youngster sure
was something special. Made
his car run like a beauty.”

Silence.“Heck of a crash.
Saw it coming the whole time.
Bumper to bumper for a couple
of laps.”

Pause. “I’m glad so and so
won cause he’s areal good fella.
Real nice, ya know whatI mean?”

The three men, all wearing
race car shirts and bill board
mesh hats, continued to talk
about race car driving for the
next hour until finally I decided
I was tired, stood up, and left.

Staring back into the diner,
masked by the cold, dark night, I
couldn’t help notice the intense
focus on each of the three faces.
I was mystified by their love for
race car driving. A love for a
sport that has only one object:
turn left. Turn left four times a
lap for 500 laps. And if you need
new tires or more gas, just turn
left into the pit, but hurry up so
you can be the first to turn left
back onto the track. Any devia-
tion from these simple rules puts
the driver into a wall and, if he’s
not lucky, into a hospital. For a
sport that lacks intense competi-
tive moments, dramatic scoring
drives, complexity, and a per-
sonal touch, the trio represented
only the tiniest of portions of its
true following.

But what is it that drives
people out to the racetrack, to
watch races on T.V., or to listen
to them on the radio? What is it
that drives three men at 3 a.m. in
a truck stop diner in Mocksville
to spend over an hour discussing
“the race,” mesmerized by left
turns, devastating crashes, and
smooth running cars? Whatis it
about race car driving?

The answer lies not within
the sport but within the people
who watch it. Race car driving
binds the working class citizens
across this nation.
thrives on the bonds, the unique-
ness, and the “this is our’sport”
mentality which it fosters.

For these three men, all of
whom entered that diner as com-
plete strangers, race car driving
was something they could share.
These three men, whose early
. | morning encounter embodies the
relationships between millions
of Americans, sat down quite
aware that they were alone but
also quite aware that they would
stand up several hours later with
two new friends, and two new
bonds.

And this confidence repre-
sents the sport’s appeal.

Confusion surrounds construction

Student body misinterprets timing and intentions of floor-raising project

By WILL BRADSHAW
Sports Editor

Rumors have been circulating
through the campus community
about the raising of the Belk Arena
main floor and subsequent closing
of the basketball courts for student
use, but the Athletic Department
contends that this project had to be
done now due to the termination
dates on the legal settlement al-
lowing the construction to take
place.

“When the building was built,
there was a problem with the sight
lines,.and we (the architects, the
temporary seating people, the arena
structure people, and the college)
came tothe realization that the best
option (for fixing the problems)
was to raise the floor,” Assistant
Athletic Director Robert Price said.

“There have been many nego-
tiations to come up with the best
solution for all concerned, and we
are up against a time line. All the
years of negotiation would be
thrown out the window and we
would have to start again (if this
project is not done now),” he con-
tinued.

Still many students, particu-
larly those who regularly played
pick-up basketball on the auxiliary
courts in the arena, are upset with
the lack of student involvement in
making the decision and sudden-

ness of the construction.

SGA president Warren Buford
said he was not aware of the project
until the day they began to pull up
the floor. Co-chair of the SGA
Council on Athletics Josh Roberts
was also uninformed.

“My initial reaction was that I
was upset,” Roberts said. “T like to

go play ball, and I don’t have a

chance now. But after the fact I can
see it from their point of view and
I understand it better. Selfishly, I
would like to see it done in the
summer, but realistically it can’t
be done.”

Some other students are notso
sure, Wes Jones, a Belk pick-up
hoopster, said he didn’t understand
why the construction couldn’t take
place in the summer.

Other students have cited the
volleyball and basketball summer
camps as the driving force behind
the decision to start the project
now. Price discredits that claim.

“If we didn’t start (construc-
tion) then the architects were go-
ing to bolt on the settlement,” Price
said. “We would have put the
camps elsewhere or offered to buy
them out (if summer construction
had been an option). Now that we
have picked this time to do it we
want to get it done before stuff
(like camps), but we did not pick
this time because of that.”

To help accommodate stu-

dents wanting to play pick-up bas-
ketball and volleyball, the SGA
has sent a memo to Athletic Direc-
tor Jim Murphy asking for in-
creased hours in Johnston gym, a
schedule of those hours to be posted
in Baker, Johnston, Chambers, the

Union, and other places, for the -

outdoor basketball courts to be
improved, and for sand to be put in
the outdoor volleyball court be-
hind Apartment F.

“We fully intend to do the
things listed in the memo,” Murphy
said. “Next week we will be out
painting backboards, hanging nets,
posting times, and putting sand in
the courts. And we will try to make
Johnston gym as accessible as pos-
sible.”

Ron Morrow, who has been
working with the Union staff to
create aschedule for Johnston gym,
says the building will be open from
9 a.m. to 10:45 p.m. Monday
through Friday, from 1 pm to 7 pm
on Saturday, and from 2 p.m. to
10:45 p.m. on Sunday. He also
said that there would be some
scheduled activities like team prac-
tices, but one court should always
be open for student use except on
Thursdays from 7 p.m. to 8 p.m.
when the Fellowship of Christian
Athletes will be using the space.

In addition, Price said that if
construction on the main floor
moves along rapidly enough then

the auxiliary courts will open be-
fore the end of the year.

“To use a bad pun, nothing is
set in concrete,” he quipped. “If it
(the upper courts) can be opened
then we’ll do it.”

The floor itself is also being
changed. According to Price, the
old floor was state of the art when
it was putin 8 years ago, but in that
time new technology has devel- .
oped the Bio-channel floor which
is supposed to absorb more shock
and be easier on the legs of ath-
letes.

_ Women’s basketball coach
John Filar, who’s team suffered
many injuries this year like stress-
fractures and shin-splints, is ex-
cited about the new floor.

“I’m very excited to see the
reaction from the players. Every-
one I talk to says it makes a world
of difference on the players, and
any pounding we can take off play-
ers’ legs will be great,” he said.

Roberts, despite his initial feel-
ing of disenfranchisement, re-
mained positive saying this should
improve viewing of games, and
that it was going to be a good tung
in the long run.

Price stressed, “People are try-
ing to make the arena as good as
they can. Kids need to look beyond
two months and the inconvenience
of construction and look ahead to
the product and they'll love it.”

Crew gets their feet wet at Clemson Regatta

By JosH PEKLO

It took stolen oars, a crushed
shell, a lot of donuts, and dirty
cars, but two years and hundreds
of 5:30 a.m. wake up calls later,
Davidson Crew has come of age.

In April 1994, several mem-
bers of the crew club decided to
reshape the club from a recreational
organization into a competitive
team. This season has witnessed
the realization of those goals.

On March 24th, the club scrim-
maged the Catawba Yacht Club
out of Charlotte. This provided an
opportunity for the team to prac-
tice rowing against another crew
on a new body of water.

“We were able to pick up a lot
of pointers from a group of skilled
rowers,” said Derrick Miller.

The Clemson Sprints this Sat-
urday provided an opportunity for
the team members to put these
coaching tips to use.

The season will culminate on
April 27th when the team travels to
Washington, D.C. for the Capitol
Classic Regatta. This regatta in-
cludes only new or small crew
programs, making it perfect for
Wildcat rowers.

“We should fare better against

the field of competition in Wash- .

ington then we did in Clemson,”
said student coach Jay Hinton.

In addition to early morning
practices, the club hopes to con-
tinue fundraising for new equip-
ment. Right now, the:club owns

two four-man shells, but when the
eleven-person squad expands next
fall, the team will need more shells.

“Tn order to maintain the club’s
rapid growth, we need to increase
our equipment at the same rate as
our membership” said Allison
Moore.

“Competitive rowing is grow-
ing in the Southeast, and we are in
an excellent position to grow with

the region,” said Moore. “Clemson,
Duke, and Vanderbilt were in our
position several years ago and now
they are large programs.”

For the fall season, the Wild-
cats plan to compéte in Atlanta,
Baltimore, and hopefully the pres-
tigious Head of the Charles Re-
gatta in Boston. When the club
started aiming towards a competi-
tive schedule, this regatta was seen

as an ultimate goal. In the fall, the
members who initiated intercolle-
giate competition will be seniors,
and they plan to be in Boston on
October 20th.

“We have a firm idea of where
we are as a team and which things
we need to work on,” said Hinton.
“The team works well together,
and I expect only success in our
future.”

Junior Venessa Sims, the only Davidson athlete to place in the Southern Conference Indoor
Championships on Feb. 23-24 (3rd in high jump), has helped revitalize the women’s track _
program which is having one of its most successful seasons in school history (see p. 16 for story).
