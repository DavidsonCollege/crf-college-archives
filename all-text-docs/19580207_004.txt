Trakas Displays
Varied Talents

By GORDON LeGRAND
Davidsonian Feature Writer

As he is a Spanish professor, it is most appropriate
and natural that Dr. Pedro N. Trakas’ avocations center
around the dances and music of Mexico and Latin
America.

lieved the events of the last
six months were causing the re-
ligious leaders of the nation and
the world to re-think their pres-
entation of the Christian mes-
sage as one that is unbounded
by time and the accomplish-
ments of men.

“In a definitely shrinking
world, the Church must make a
stronger emphasis upon its mis-
sionary enterprise,” he com-
mented. He further noted -that
there will likely be an increas-
ing awareness of the presence

PRESIDENTIAL COMMITTEE

The former President of Da-
vidson College cited the work
of the committee for selecting
his successor. He said that he
was particularly impressed by
the devotion, wisdom, and care
with which this group was pur-
suing its task.

“We should not be discour-
aged by the length of time this
job is requiring,” he stated in
answer to a question regarding
the progress of their endeavor.

He gave no indication that he
had any definite idea as to the

Christian faith.

The Calendar Committee of
the faculty and student govern-

these two proposals at a recent
meeting. Their discussion with
regard to the first proposal in-
cluded these items: a) moving
exams up two days, thus per-
mitting a holiday on Wednes-
day and Thursday, b) having
double cuts on Friday and Sat-
urday, c) starting the semester
two days earlier or taking two
days off some regular holiday.

VOTE IN UNION

The matter of casting ballots
at the Union rather than at
Chapel period was favored by
the committee.

It recommended that in the
future all elections be voted on
there, unless the number of
votes fell off drastically,

The entire length of the elec-
tion period might be shortened
several weeks by continued vot-
ing in the Union. with five bal-
lots a week rather than three.

Thus, it was held, interest
would not decline so drastically,

He quickly pointed out. that
,he was casting no dispersions
“upon the present faculty of
which he was very proud, “but
this is an area which an in-
stitution of the nature of Da-
vidson must constantly strive to
improve.”

NEW RESPONSIBILITY

Dr. Cunningham said that his
responsibilities as Director of
jthe Foundation had largely
been what he had anticipated,’
but much more time demanding
ithan he had thought they would
be.

He pointed out that his cur-
rent ministry to the Presbyte-

‘rian Church extended from
Baltimore. Maryland to E! Paso,
Texas.

This makes it necessary for
him to carry a heavy travel
schedule, which will include
forthcoming svisits to Cleveland
