Gridders Try For Rebound,
Clash With Spiders Saturday

By BRANT BILLS |
Staff Writer

The Richmond Spiders are
going to meet a defensive unit
which is out for vengence as
they clash with the Davidson
Wildcats on Saturday in an im-
portant early season conference
game. Kick off is slated for 2
p.m. on Richardson Field.

The inexperienced defensive
alignment showed signs of sur-
prising strength against the
Wofford Terriers last weet
Only Captain Eddie Williamson
at linebacker and tackle Jack
Stultz saw regular starting ac-
tion last year, while senior end
Ross Manire has seen extensive
play in a reverse roll during the
past two seasons.

“Saturday night was one of
the finest exhibitions of defen-
sive gang tackling and pursuit I

have ever seen,” proclaimed
Fagg.

But the offensive unit will
have to improve tremendously
in order to keep their place as
the nation’s number five of-
fensive team.

The key to the offensive suc-
cess may lie in the hands of all-
American flanker Walt Walker
and quarterback David Harper.

“Walt played a tremendous
game,” praised Wildcat head
coach Dave Fagg. ‘Not onl
did he get us yards with the ball,
but his flanking and downfield
blocking were just super.

“‘We have to obtain an of-
fensive discipline and guard
against the turnover,” stated
Fagg. ‘So many times plays
were stopped by one little
mistake.”

spring showed promise of

Wofford Humbles Cats 23-0 In Opener

Davidson's 1973 football for-
tunes got off on the wrong foot
with a 23-0 loss to Wofford in

:

“Tt was real tough on Dave to
throw an interception that
early,” Fagg said. ‘‘But he
showed a lot of poise throughout
the game and did a fine job of

leading the team.

“Dave is just a young quar-
terback and our passing game
was just a step off,”” Fagg con-
tinued. ‘‘I think that Dave was
just a little nervous and that
next week he’ll throw the way
he’s able to,” Fagg added.

Offensively there were a few
bright spots for the Cats. Dave
Ingold picked up 106 yards in
the all-purpose running
category. Walt Walker, who led
the Southern Conference with 62
receptions last year (good
enough for honorable mention
in the AP All-American poll),
pulled in six tosses despite
being double covered on almost
every play, particularly in
passing situations.

‘‘When last season ended, we
thought that defense would be a
problem this year,”” Fagg said.
“But last spring we had the
most enthusiastic hitting we've
ever had. Right now it’s the best
defense Davidson has had since
I've been here.

The Cat defense did do a good
job, especially in light of the
fact that they were on the field
for three quarters of the game.

“They just did a super job of

Club Football Snares
Key Varsity Dropouts

The club football Wildcats
have had tremendous turnouts
for their first two practices on
Monday and Wednesday in
preparation for their opening
game with Duke University’s
club team on Sunday.

Kick off time is scheduled for
2 p.m. on the lower practice
field behind the stadium.

About 35 candidates have at-
tended practiceoneachevening,

at least half of these having ex-

perience on the Wildcat varsity.

“We were well pleased with
the turnout,’ stated player-
coach Rollie White. “‘I can re-
member last year playing with
12 or 15 men. And that's no fun

ing with no break.”’

ino looks extremely
strong for the coming season.
Heading up the defensive front
four are tackles Sandy Car-
nagie, Rick Houdy, and Mark
Gardner.

Linebackers include yer-
coaches White, Bob Wetzel,
Doug Aiken and Frank Mc-

Shane.

The offensive team is on the
small side but compensates for
that with quickness.

‘“‘We are going to try to keep
the offense with the basics,”’ ex-
plained White. ‘‘I think that if
we master these few plays, we
will have a potentially explosive
unit.”’

Brant Bills and John Moon
have tied down the two guard
spots while Bruce Reicheldor-
fer will handle the snapping
duties.

Frank Roder has filled one
tackle slot, while the other
remains open to Carnagie, Tony
Boon or Zack Varnedoe.

Trackster Jim Boyd has won
signal calling duties. The rest of
the backfield rounds out with
Fullback Dwight Plemmons
and halfbacks Jim Coggin and
Don Long.

Player-coach Eric “Big E”’
Sharling will fill the tight end
duties. The split end post has
not yet been filled.

hustling throughout the entire
game,” Fagg said.

Fagg cited the performances
of linebackers Eddie William-
son, Danny Ward and defensive
end Ronnie Hamilton.

The brightest star on the
defense however, was Alan

when Jim DeVille was lost for
the season.

“‘Alan played one of the best
games at tackle that I've ever
seen,” Fagg stated. ‘‘He has
taken up the slack on the defen-
sive line caused by DeVille’s
oss.

Fagg added, ‘It would be
unreal to imagine how good that
unit would be with Eddie
Womack and Jim DeVille.”

The two highly touted starters
last year, junior linebacker-

defensive back Womack and
sophomore tackle DeVille, are
both out with injuries which
are expected to keep them out

of action the entire season.

“We were just awfully disap-
pointed that we couldn't get
anything going,” Fagg said.
“‘We wanted to win that one
badly, but we’ll just have to
wait until next week.’’

Many times the line failed to
do its job, which hindered Har-

Harper did show great ability

also dropped by intended
receivers.

Richmond has been ranked
with East Carolina and William

favorites for the Southern Con-

The Spider’s biggest asset
will be two-time all-conference
