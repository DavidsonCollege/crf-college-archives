THE DAVIDSONIAN

OPINIONS

MONDAY, MARCH 17, 1997 9

We are writing because we
have reservations and concerns with
the proposed idea to bring sorori-
ties to Davidson. We are unsatis-
fied with assertions that sororities
would not disturb Davidson’s prin-
ciples of ‘self-selection.

Those who have advocated so-
rorities’ arrival have likened
Davidson life with sororities and
eating houses to Princeton Univer-
sity, a school in which both eating
houses and sororities coexist. There
are, however, some. fundamental
differences between Princeton and
Davidson. First of all, Princeton is
much larger. Princeton’s under-
graduate program has about 5000
students. In a school so large it is
understandable that students would
need to have more associations and
outlets for making friends, allow-
ing the school to seem a little less
overwhelming and large. In addi-
tion, Princeton students do not join

eating houses until the second ~

semseter of their sophomore year.
They have a year and a half in
which sororities are their only op-
tion for such an organization. .
Secondly, Princeton’s eating
houses are co-ed. Their need for
the sororities may stem from a lack
of all-female organizations, of
which, Davidson has three. When

advocates assert that bringing so-

rorities to Davidson will not com-

pete or threaten the eating houses,
citing Princeton as proof, they seem
to ignore this fundamental differ-
ence between the two.

Finally, and most importantly,
Princeton’s eating houses do not
operate on the basis of self-selec-
tion. Their eating houses have an
extensive rush and they are highly
selective organizations. It is this

choose, regardless of whether or
not that house chooses us. These
principles of self-selection are what
make our school unique, and, fur-
thermore, they make our school
wonderful. If, as a freshwoman
arriving on campus, one of us is
“encouraged” to join a particular
sorority and one of us is not, or one
of us is not accepted into the soror-

Connor as our first choice? This
comfort and open atmosphere is
something that we cherish in our
Davidson experience. Even sup-
posing that there were limits on the
proportion of girls that could be in
one sorority from the same house,
preventing the above problem, what
effect will that have on self-selec-
tion? We join Pi Beta Phi and then

principle of self-selec-
tion that we see as the
chief reason why sorori-
ties and eating houses
at Davidson, as pre-
sented, are
incompatable. When
looking at colleges, we

We would hate to see sororites
act as feeder clubs into
particular houses, or vice versa.

all were faced with the choice of
what school we wanted to attend.
Various factors play into our deci-
sions: money, location, repuation,
class sizes, faculty, etc.

Social life is also one of those
factors that a prospective student
must investigate. Implicit in the

notion of sororities, however, is the

notion of rush. We know, “rush is
not a four letter word,” but we also
know that rush can not coexist with
our current principles of self-selec-
tion for women. According to
Davidson’s policies, we will not be
pressured in any way to join a cer-
tain house. As Davidson females
we are also assured of the right to
join whatever eating house we

ity of our choice and one of us is,
then what kind of atmosphere does
that create for the freshman class?
Competition and cliques are not
what this school should be about.

In addition, what effect will
sororities have on our eating houses?
The advocates say none, but let’s be
realistic. When fall rolls around
and it is time to start hand picking
girls to join your club, do you think
that having a majority of the girls in
one sorority be in Rusk ’and the
other sorority be in Connor won’t
affect their decision over what house
to self-select?

If we were rejected from a pre-
dominantly Connor sorority, would
we feel comfortable putting down

— forournumbers. We
would hate to see sororites act as
feeder clubs into particular eating
houses, or vice versa.

When we chose to come to
Davidson, we were well aware of
the self-selection system here. We
were fully informed that there were
no sororities at Davidson. Such
factors were a large part of our deci-
sion. We applaud the principles of
self-selection because, when fol-
lowed, they help maintain an open
atmosphere on the court and through-
out the school. We understand the
advocates of sororities would like
them for many reasons. One such
reason is the connections that one
makes outside of Davidson. We
agree thatitis frustrating when some-

one has an edge over you in the job
market because they were in the
same sorority as the potential em-
ployer, however, we knew this was
not an option when we chose
Davidson. In addition, what does
that really say? Does anyone really
want to be sitting in a job interview
saying, “Oh you were a Kappa too!”
What does that mean? A sorority’s
profile differs from school to school-
-what do you really have in com-
mon with that person? Surely a
Davidson student has more going ~
for them that they can sell to a
potential employer than that.
Davidson, like it or not, is not
really a big name school. We could
have chosen to go to another school
with less quality but a bigger name
if that is what we wanted, but we
didn’t value the name, we valued
the school. We like being able to
explain to someone that we are not
in Chi-Omega because we have a
system unique to Davidson.
Some of you say that we should ~
“be able to have both. We agree. If
Davidson had a fancy reputation
without ruining its quality, that
would be ideal. Likewise, if we
could have the fancy Greek letters
without ruining the quality of our.
existing system that too would be
ideal, but we value the spirit of self-
selection too much to compromise
it for sororities.

The other day, I was talking to
a friend of mine about a mutual
acquaintance, and she said, “You
know, he’s nice.”

At the mention of that word,
_ my eyes narrowed, my lip twisted
into a sneer, and I said something
along the lines of, “God-a’ mighty, I
know. I can’t stand people who are
nice. I hope no one describes me as
being nice.”

Now, you might be thinking
I’m a damn fool for saying some-
thing like that, but let me explain
myself. Nice is such a little old
nothing of a word. It’s what you say
when you don’t have anything par-
ticularly good or bad to say about a
person, place, thing, event, or idea.

Nice is bland, boring, benign,
and blah; it’s dull, drab, dreary, and
downright depressing. It slides out
of your mouth like the yellow run-
ning out of a fried:egg’s burst yolk.
It’s a little puff of air with a sibilant
at the end hissing quietly and unob-
trusively so as not to offend
anybody’s delicate sensibilities.

If you describe someone as
sweet or cute or lovely, it’s bad
enough, but nice is even worse. It’s
definitely not negative, but it isn’t
positive either; it’s a light smudge
of gray. It means that a person
hasn’t made a big enough impres-
sion on you to think of a way to
describe what they’re really like.

You might be objecting and
saying, “But when I say ‘nice,’ it
means something else, like a

Greg Garrison

Don’t Be So Nice

person’s hot, you know?” Okay,
I’ll concede that the word can have
that meaning, but when you mean
that, you say, “Ni-ice,” drawing out
the I and almost making it into two
syllables. I’m not talking about the
two-syllable Ni-ice here, but the
single-syllable nice, which should
be printed in a tiny, mousy little
font, rather than one the same size
as the rest of the words in this sen-
tence.

The one-syllablenice is like the
one-syllable fine. “How are you
today?” someone might ask, and if
you say, “Fine,” we all know that
you aren’ t necessarily having alousy
day or a good one; you’re not sure
and just pretend to give an answer.
Just like nice, fine means some-
thing else entirely when you say,
“Fi-ine,” but that’s usually in a sen-
tence like, “She’s fi-ine.” You might
answer the question, “How are you
doing?” with, “I’m doing fi-ine,”
but only if you’re hammered out of
your gourd on a bottle of Colt 45
and are trying to be cool like the
smooth operator you are.

Another objection might be that
not everybody uses nice when they
don’t have anything genuine or sub-
stantial to say. If you’re saying this
right now, you’re right; there’s an
exception to most every rule, and in
this case, there’s a generational ex-
ception. When a kind old
grandparently person calls you a
nice -young man or woman, that
kind old grandparently person is

paying you acomplimentand thinks
you’ re okay.

Seeing as how no students here
fit into that category, at least as far
as I know, let’s just stick to the
situation at hand and think about
niceness on a collegiate level, all
right?

Now, I’ve been called a lot of
things, but as far as I know, I’ve
never been called nice, and I hope I
never am.

I keep a pretty good ear to the
grapevine, and it turns out that there
are acouple dozen interesting, con-
tradictory, and mostly false rumors
running around about me, but I’d
rather have it that way than a gen-
eral feeling and opinion that I’m a
nice guy.

I’m sometimes called a2
pothead, a scammer, a shmooze, a
homophobe; a Republican, a Demo-
crat, a fundamentalist, an atheist, a
frat-boy wanna-be, a terribly fierce
anti-fraternity ess oh be, and a sex-
ist pig. None of these names is
accurate or correct, but I’d rather
be called any of them than nice.

I’m sometimes called decent,
friendly, funny, intelligent, inter-
esting, creative, cranky, irritating,
aggravating, exasperating, paternal-
istic, megalomaniacal, egotistical,
boastful, narcissistic, self-centered,
obnoxious, silly, mean-spirited,
raw, blunt, rude, tactless, wild,
dumb, confusing, confused, reck-
less, thoughtless, brainless, heart-
less, close-minded, impolite, incon-

siderate, inconsistent, and irrespon-
sible. As far as I can tell, these
words are all fairly accurate to one
degree or another, and I prefer any
one of them to nice.

I’m sometimes called a decent
writer, okay cartoonist, close friend,
comedian, storyteller, clown,

butthead, bunghole, prick, fool, |

drunkard, redneck, white trash,
weirdo, pissant, goofball, rambler,
ay-hole, shtufhead, loudmouth, or
trouble-starter. I'can live with any
of these, seeing as how they’ re pretty

much true, but I just can’t live with
nice.

Don’t be nice. °

Hell, be a jerk or be kind or be
geeky or be cool, but be something.
Just as Mark Twain said, “One must
keep one’s character. Earn a char-
acter first if you can, and if you
can’t, then assume one.”

I know, I know - as you’re
reading this, you might be saying,
“But Greg, lam nice.” Well friend,
if you are, there’s no time to change
like right now.
