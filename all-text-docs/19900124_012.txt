STRESS, from page 14

unpercolating bombardment results from the ex-
tremely common tendency for students to do all their
work at the last minute. If students choose to procras-
tinate, that’s fine. But if you don’t do seven weeks
worth of reading until the night before the mid-term,
then it isn’t fair for you to blame the professor for
throwing too much information at you all at once or
for not giving you enough time to mull over the
concepts.

Togetback tothe main point, however, I don’t think
that having a heavy workload is a nasty, horrible, ter-
rible thing. Learning about ideas, and perhaps more
importantly, acquiring the skills that will help uskeep
learning even after graduation, will be advantages to
us for the rest of our lives. And our four years here are
certainly the best, if not the only, opportunity we will
have for that kind of education. *—

‘I don’t even like using the term “heavy workload”
because it makes the reading and the study sound like
aburden, notan opportunity. It’sso easy to get caught
up in the feeling that we are being crushed by it that we
often lose sight of how really fascinating a lot of this
stuff is.

Now, I whine and complain about the workload as

much as the rest of us. If anyone quotes any of these
smiley, glib sentences I’ve just written back at me
while I’m freaking out about a 12-page paper that I
don’thave time to finish, I will almost certainly throw
something at that person. Nevertheless, deep downin
my English-major heart, I believe reading
Shakespeare is valuable.

I don’t think stress is necessarily a nasty, horrible,
terrible thing, either. I’ve been told that many of the
problems at Davidson area result of stress and I don’t
buy it. Many of the problems at Davidson are caused
by students handling stressin unhealthy ways. If your
method of handling stressis to get completely trashed
four nights a week, then of course you're going to
have problems. If your nerves turn to banana pud-
ding every time you have an assignment due, then
you’re going to have problems, too. Yes, Davidson as
an institution should do as much as possible to help
students learn to manage stress. But individual stu-
dents should be confident that we can learn to handle
it. Sure, it’s a drag sometimes, but we have to learn to
deal withit. Stressisn’tjust going to goaway. Seventy
percent of Davidson’s seniors will goon tosome form
of graduate school next fall. Do you think law school
or med school or divinity school will mean less
sure? Do you think parenting two kids will be less
stressful than taking five classes a semester?

There’s nothing wrong with venting a few gripes to
your roommate about how much you have to doand
how little time you have to doit. Butif we seriously ask
professors to require less of us then we are cheating
ourselves of the quality of education wecamehere for _
in the first place. I don’t often ask faculty or adminis-
trators to ignore student opinions, but in this case I
think the claims that putting eight books on the sylla-
bus will permanently destroy students’ lives should
be taken withalarge grainofsalt.
Sometimes when the stress of Davidson
is just too much for me, I’ll take a
something mindlesslike polishing my nails.
my nails are painted, I’m glad that I can
book and get back to work. Tiel
