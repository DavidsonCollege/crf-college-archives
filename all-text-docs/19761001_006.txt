Benny Goodman: The Famous Carne-

gie Hall Jazz Concert, Columbia Rec-

ords, (CL 814-816), Vols. I, II, III.
Pe ea :

Barry Ulanov, in his Handbook of
Jazz (New York: Viking Press, 1959),
states that ‘‘few bands swung as
consistently as Benny Goodman's in
the late thirties.and early forties, that
few leaders did as much to find
audiences for soloists of a half-dozen
different related schools; that few did
as much to break down color lines in
jazz; that few have demonstrated so
unmistakenly the classical nature of
that refined Dixieland which is
Swing.”

On the night of January 16, 1938,
in Carnegie Hall, Benny Goodman
and his ‘Swing Orchestra”’ partici-
pated in what critics have acclaimed
as ‘‘one of the greatest triumphs ever
registered by a swing band.’’ The
concert totally lives up to the claim
made by Ulanov, and jazz buffs are
fortunately able to experience pract-
ically the entire concert, which was
relayed to CBS studios from a single
overhead mike from Carnegie Hall.

Not until the advent of 33% rpm
records did Columbia Records release
the recording, and the concert is now
available in a three-album set. The
quality is surprisingly good, consider-
ing-that recording technology was not
particularly advanced in 1938, and
that only one microphone was used.

The personnel Goodman had as-
sembled prior to the concert were
among the best available in the jazz
world at that time. And Goodman
had definite ideas on how he wanted

his band to sound. ‘‘First, I was

interested only in jazz—I wanted to

create a tight, small band quality,
and I wanted everyone of my boys to
be a soloist. The band had to have a
driving beat, a rhythmic brass sec-
tion, and a sax section that would be

smooth but with lots of punch.

“‘...I didn’t just ask for good
musicianship, I insisted upon it...No-
thing less than perfection would do: I
lived that music and expected every-
one else to live it too.” "

Goodman’s band, by 1938, con-
tained such outstanding talents as

Harry James on trumpet, Jess
Stacey on piano, and Gene Krupa on
drums; the quartet included Teddy
Wilson on piano and the incomparable
Lionel Hampton on vibraphone.
The concert kicks off with Don’t Be

trademark of rolling saxes, punching
trumpets, and lively rhythm are very
much in evidence, even though Good-

man, perhaps a bit nervous, beat off °

the tempo a trifle too slowly. The tune
lags just a little until Gene Krupa’s
raucous two and one-half measure
drum solo.

The audience goes wild, ane +he

trumpets, punctuating the sax riff
with short notes, go into mutes and
turn the volume way down before
Krupa bursts out with another drum
solo and leads the band out.

One O'Clock Jump, the great Count
Basie standard, is next on the
program, and Jess Stacey’s extended
piano solo at the outset is a tribute to
the Count, standing in the wings on
this night.

Following is a tenor sax solo by
Babe Russin, then Vernon Brown on
trombone, who swings magnificently
with Krupa backing him up. Then
Goodman takes his turn, and his solo
is one of the best of the evening. As
B.G. plays his ‘‘happy-sounding
blues’’, Stacey fills in with the
excellent background work that he
has always been noted for. Harry
James takes a brilliant stint on
trumpet, and then the famous Basie
rideout begins, rolling along easily at
first and then building in intensity
and drive. The saxes play the same
riff figure over and over, as the
trumpets and Krupa back them up.
The crowd cheers and claps when
Goodman comes in, wailing high
above the band to end the song.

Goodman features his quartet ex-
tensively throughout the concert, and
with good reason, for by 1938 they
were every bit as popular as his big
band. With Teddy Wilson on piano,
Goodman on clarinet, Lionel Hamp-
ton on vibraphone, and Krupa on
drums, they provide good contrast to
Goodman’s big band, and add an
intimate air to the packed hall.

Yet at the same time, they perform
with such spirit that it led Irving

Ice cream emporiums titilla

By DAVE KELLER
Features Editor

No one knows the exact origins of ice cream;
some have speculated, but its history seems
indelibly obscured by the years. Its popular-
ity, however, has never been questioned, and
it stands unchallenged as the classic treat
worldwide.

Perhaps nowhere can more pleasure be
found in such a small package, for ice cream
cools the mouth, titillates the tongue (both by
taste and texture), and satisfies the sweet
tooth looking for just a little something
delightful. Its only drawback is its caloric
content (but if you’re worried about that then
forget this article).

Another, less obvious asset of this frigi
confection is its ability to draw out sociability
in people— witness the transformation of a
morose, bewildered group of students into a
happy, chuckling company when outfitted
with individual ice cream cones. It is this last
property of the sweet treat which prompts this
article, which is written in the hope that when
someone utters a statement about the extreme
uneventfulness of some weekend evening, you,
after having read this, can suggest, ‘‘Let’s go
eat ice cream,’’ (or something like that).

In our locale, ice cream manifests itself in
two ways: the soft, ready-serve variety and
the hard ‘‘dip’”’ species. As this reporter
considers the former mostly for emergency:
use, I will deal at greater length with the
latter.

In addition, Henderson uses the old

West African pattern of call-and-re-

er another—rolling saxes versus crisp
brass.

Kolodin to remark in the notes
accompanying the album: ‘‘With due
respect to its many fine studio
performances, it is obvious that the
quartet has never been reproduced
with so much fidelity, color, or
musical vitality, as in this actual]
performance,” in

Benny, as always, is superb, and
Krupa drives the quartet, holds it
together by giving them a consistent,
rock-steady tempo to which soloists
can always return to. Featured on the
three records are Avalon, The Man I

' Love, I Got Rhythm, and Stompin’ at
the Savoy.

Life Goes toa Party, on Vol. II,
Side One, demonstrates why Good-
man fans look back upon the 1938
group as being the ‘‘Powerhouse’’
band of Benny’s long career. Here
they are shown in full cry in this
arrangement, written by Harry
James in tribute to a picture series in
Life magazine covering an evening
with the Goodman band.

Blue Skies, also on Vol. II, is
arranged by Fletcher Henderson,
Goodman’s principal arranger during
the early years of his band. Blue Skies
typifies the style in which Henderson
writes—simple, yet insistently swing-
ing tunes in which complete sections

Sing, Sing, Sing. Written in a minor
key and featuring Gene Krupa on
drums, it is simply the best recording
of the best song in Goodman’s books.

The crowd applauds loudly as they
recognize the familiar ‘‘jungle drum’”’
tom-tom-tomming of Krupa, and the
song, twelve minutes in its entirety,
gets under way. Another burst of
applause comes at the point where the

78 rpm commercial recording would

have ended, but Krupa keeps on

drumming and the band continues.

The real beauty of her set-up is that she allows
almost unlimited sampling before a purchase,
and a number of flavors are available in
half-gallons to take home.

Mrs. Spoon loves Davidson students (espe-
cially the guys) and will chat all night if she !s
not too busy. Her ice cream is absolutely tops,
and the quaintness of her store adds to its
appeal. To get there, drive into Charlotte on
I-77, getting off on the Coliseum exit to the
right and heading for Independence Boule-

possible return stop), drive for two blocks and

opens at 12:30 pm and 3:30 pm, respectively.

The other ‘‘homemade”’ emporium is in
Concord and is called the Cabarrus Creamery.
The Creamery’s set-up is a bit more commer-
cial than Spoon’s, but the ice cream, though
not full of Mrs. Spoon’s T.L.C.., is still made in
the back and is still quite good.

These folks have about 25 flavors of ice
cream to offer, plus a wide assortment of
banana splits, huge sundaes, and the like.
Their specialty, however, in most folks’
opinions, is their peanut butter milkshake, a
