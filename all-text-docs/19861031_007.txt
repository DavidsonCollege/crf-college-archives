Marshall outplays Davidson Football

By MIKE ADAMS

The Marshall Herd thundered
for 35 second-quarter points -
against’ a punch-drunk Davidson:
defense .en route to skinning the
Cats 63-14 last Saturday at Mar-
shall.

Marshall dominated all. as-
pects of the game. They rushed for
306 yards while holding the Cats
to a paltry four. They passed for
256 yards; Davidson had 187 pas-
sing yards. They had 28 first
downs to Davidson’s 12.

Davidson was hurt throughout
the day by sloppy offensive play.
The Cats turned the ball over six
times, losing four out of five fum-
bles and tossing two intercep-
tions.

The: Wildcats gave Marshall
good field position on their first
possession. Davidson returned the
opening kick-off to- the 21 and
proceeded to lose 11 yards on
three plays. Junior Charlie Win-
borne’s punt gave the Thundering
Herd the ball at the Wildcat 35-
yard line.

Marshall took only five plays
to score, notching the touchdown
on a 15-yard pass after a five yard
touchdown run was called back
for a holding penalty.

Defensively, the Wildcats
stiffened after the opening score.
They forced Marshall to give the
ball up on downs on its second
possession and intercepted a pass
on the third.

The Davidson field hockey
team ended their regular season
play, with an excellent effort in a 1-

Wednesday.
Davidson got off to an aggres-
sive start the first half. The desire
to play well and hustle was evi-
dent. The connections between
_ the halfbacks and the forwards
were smooth. The offense played
especially hard in their half of the
field and there were good defen-

the second quarter.

The Davidson offense was un-
able to move the ball, though. The
Cats gave the ball up twice on
punts and on the first play after

junior Jim Ruark intercepted the -

Marshall pass, freshman quarter-
back Peter Hughes had one picked
off for a 20-yard return and a Mar-
shall touchdown.

A similar sequence of events
occured in the: first two plays of
- Freshman
Chris Hardin intercepted a Mar-
shall pass at the Davidson 45-yard
line. On the Cats first play,
Hughes again threw an intercep-
tion. This one went for a 37-yard
touchdown and a 21-0 lead.

The defense got the first points
for the Wildcats. Freshman Cole’

Thomason blocked a. Marshall .

punt, scooped up the ball at the
two and took it in for a touchdown
to make the score21-7. >

The Herd quickly buried any
Wildcat hopes of getting back in
the game. Marshall scored four

touchdowns in the last 3:54 of the —

second quarter to run up a 49-7
half-time score.

Marshall scored first on a 62-
yard, nine-play drive after a
Davidson punt.

The Cats moved the ball to the
Marshall 48 on their next posses-
sion, but were again forced to
punt. Marshall then drove 75
yards on just four plays, including
a 56-yard touchdown pass.

Cross country runs well

By EDWIN PAGE

Last Saturday, the Davidson
men’s and women’s cross country
teams ran on their new home
course for the second time ever. In
a field of'four teams, the men
placed second behind Duke, and
.ahead of Wake Forest B-team and
Western Carolina, while _ the
women’s team faced only partial
squads from Wake Forest i
‘Wester Carolina.

Senior Greg Foreman led the

men, running the 8k course in -

26:47, his best time of the season
and good enough for sixth place in

the meet.
Junior Chris Fisher, the Cats

“number one runner for most of the

season, finished second for
Davidson and ninth overall with a
27:18. Senior captain Emil
Cekada ran his second consecu-
tive strong race, finishing third for
Davidson, and sophomore Bill

Hartman continued to lower his -
time each race as he placed fourth.

Freshman Jay Clugston finished

off the scoring for the men,

Although the women. faced
only partial teams and therefore
posted. no team score, the meet

its = first play from scrimmage on
their next possession with 1:24
left in the half. Three plays later,
Marshall scored on a 21-yard
pass.

On the ensuing kick-off,
freshman Andy Tysinger fumbled
at the Davidson 31-yard line with
40 seconds left. Two plays later,
Marshall scored on a 29-yard
touchdown run to.end the first half
scoring.

The Herd did not end their
scoring blitz in the first half. They
also scored on their first posses-
sion of the third quarter.

Marshall received the kick-off me

and returned it to the 35. The Herd
then drove 65 yards in eight plays
to run the score to 56-7.
Davidson’s offense finally got.
on the board midway through the

fourth quarter. After Marshall lost '

the ball on downs at its own 43,
senior quarterback Steve Bradley

directed the Cats to a 57-yard,
four-play. touchdown drive cap- ;
ped by a 29-yard scoring pass to

freshman Eric Crowley.

Marshall added a meaningless
touchdown with 28 seconds left in
the game’ after Davidson turned
the ball over on a Bradley fumble
at the five-yard line, scoring on a
four-yard run.

The Wildcats have an off-day
this Saturday. They travel to Fur-

man next week to face a. strong
Paladin squad which has tied Ap-
palachian State and. Georgia Tech.

ful.

Davidson’s offense did put to-
gether a few good runs down the
field at the beginning of the half,
but it wasn’t until later that they
truly got it together. The Cats
began to dominate offensively. As
the minutes ticked away play be-
came especially frenzied with
both teams trying desperately to
score. Unfortunately High: Point
was successful with only eleven
minutes to play, and held on to
win 1-0.

Sophomore halfOaek Eileen
Keely expressed her feelings on
the game: “The score was disap-
pointing. They scored late in the

second half. We outplayed them, _

they just outscored us.”

Senior goalie Nana Lay said:
“We played really well. We had a
lot of scoring opportunities that

we didn’t take advantage of. We —

dominated the game but they
scored an unfortunate goal.”

The team ends their regular |

season play with a 1-11-1 record.

They are optimistically looking to
next year. Sophomore Elizabeth
Franklin feels that “There were
personal improvements every
game. I’m very positive about

next year since we are such a

young team. Every one will be
more experienced and we will
have players back from abroad.”

This weekend is the Deep

Southern Conference competition
this year, so it is difficult to assess
their chances this weekend, but
coach Gary Andrew feels good
about the way his teams are look-
ing. =
*We’re running better races
late in the season,” he said. “If the
men can come up with their best
race, we can catch a few teams
and have a respectable showing.”

“We're as prepared as we can

be,” Cekada said. “The only ques-

tion is whether all our work is
enough to overcome the. ‘talent

. deficit’ between us and the other

Southern Conference schools.”

The hopes of the women’s
team depend heavily on the health
of freshman Missy Willis, who

ran very well early i in the season,
but has been bothered by allergies
and a persistant cold ever since.

Andrew called the Southern
Conference meet “the highlight of
our season.”
