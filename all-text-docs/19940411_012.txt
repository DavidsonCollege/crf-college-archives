The band Everything per-
formed Friday night to a festive
Patterson Court crowd. While
some Davidson students are al-
ready avid fans of the group, the
band undoubtedly won new ‘con-
verts as a result of their perfor-
mance.

Everything is composed of
six members and hails from
Washington, D.C. Beginning full-
time work only in 1992, the group
has toured extensively, particu-
larly in the Eastern Atlantic and
Midwest areas. The band’s cur-
rent tour finds them expanding
their range to include venues as
far west as Colorado. The band’s

album SOL*ID, which was re-
leased on an independent label,
‘has sold over five thousand cop-
ies. In addition, Everything has
recently joined with Encore Dis-
tributors, which should increase
both availability and sales of the
album. Two songs from SOL*/D
also appear on the compilation
albums TheAware CDandCMJ’s
Certain Damage. The band has
also recorded a new full-length
album which is scheduled for re-
lease sometime this summer.
Based on the strong sales of the
first album and their impressive
live performances, Everything ap-
pears poised for even greater suc-
cess and acclaim.

Thespians amuse, confound audience

Oh, yes, we have theatre here.
The two one-acts presented this
week by the Davidson Theatre De-
partment, Kaleidoscope and Dis-
tances, displayed the wide foray of
talent among Davidson students.
First and foremost, the turnout was
excellent. On Wednesday, almost
every seat was full, and on Thurs-
day, people had trouble getting in
the door.

And the big turnout was well-
deserved, The first one-act,
Kaliedoscope, written by Ray
Bradbury and directed by sopho-
more Christa Abbott, is a highly

visual production of seven astro-
nauts whose rocketship explodes
in space. They are all floating in
their own spheres (literally and
abstractly), trying to rediscover
what it is that has brought them to
where they are and how they have
all spent their lives.

It is a fairly difficult script,
with very little movement and
change, so keeping the audience
involved seemed to be achallenge.
But Abbott pulled through—the
lights speckled throughout the
black box to make it seem as if you,
too, were with the astronauts, and
the characters held flashlights un-

der their faces to give a surreal,
shadowed effect. The play worked
by its subtlety and mellow dramat-
ics; by the end, it made you ponder
your own depth and value in a
quasi-vacuum of blackness.

Whoa. The mood and tone
changed quickly after that: The
Studio Ensemble wrote and di-
rected a wide array of sketches and
- vignettes that delighted and enter-
tained.

Among the. highlights were
scenes such as “God on E-Mail”;
Danny Grosman and Kimberly
Kreiling play God and Goddette
(kind of like Smurfette, but much

more sophisticated and minus the
tacky white bow in the hair) on the
internet. Different people from all
walks of life asked them questions
like, “Who willbe Miss America?”
(answer, Miss South Dakota), and,
“What’s Ethel Ruth’s secret ingre-
dient for her apple jelly?” (answer,
vodka).

Other sketches, though they
were all worth noting included
scenes entitled “Ed’s Bar,” “First
Date,” and the gem of them all,
“Flowers in Heat.”

In this one, a wildflower is
deeply in love with a rose but is
unable to talk to her because they

don’t speak the same language.
The wildflowers (Josh Gaffga and
Danny Grossman) employ the ef-
forts of an over-worked bee (Cyndy
Marion) in trying the young rose to
pollinate with him. The mother
rose (Marianna Whitehurst) with
her parasol in hand, rejects the
idea. But the two young flowers
are united at the end by the help of
a gardener who needs them both
for a bouquet.

My words just can’t say it as
well as they did. Make sure you
see this week’s one-acts, Zoo

Story and Chamber Music, first-

Cobain: Dead

By Josh Larned

Kurt Cobain: 1967-1984

On Friday, April 8, Kurt
Cobain, singer and guitarist for the
group Nirvana was found dead,
apparently from a self-inflicted
shotgun wound.

From the beginning of his ca-
reer, Cobain set out to shock his
listeners in his own provoking
manner. His wailing voice, his
self-destructive habits on stage, his
intense and cryptic lyrics, and his
loud, carefree guitar-playing all
revealed a distinctive “I don’t give
adamn” personality that made him
a hero to some and a annoyance to
others. He was a true punk. One
couldn't help but notice him as he
flailed about on MTV and thrust
Nirvana to overnight fame.

However, there was more to
Cobain’s character than the can-
onization he will all most certainly
receive as the angry rock star of an
“angst-ridden generation.” He
didn’t hate everything; he simply
hated those who hated blindly. His
songs attacked sexists, rapists, rac-
ists, homophobes, and religious
fanatics alike. He challenged his
listeners to continually reevaluate
themselves, as they strained to de-
cipher the warbled words within
his songs.

Foremost, Cobain seemed to
have personal fun striking sounds
out of his guitar and screaming
into the ears of his startled audi-
ence. He beckoned listeners to
“Come As You Are,” in a true
rallying cry of unadulterated indi-

vidualism. For many, he becamea °
symbol of the splendor and pain of ;

their own adolescence.

Clearly Cobain was more
troubled than even his listeners
imagined. However, before he is
transformed into one of the count-

less tragic heroes of rock’s annals, -

his true person should not be for-
gotten. Cobain was a man with the
openest of minds and a heart of
pure, human flesh. So long, Kurt.
