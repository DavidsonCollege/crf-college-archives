will be a moving picture entitled “How
France Cares. for Her Soldiers,” given

by a “Scene in a French Hospital,’ pro-
duced by local talent. Proceeds go for

the benefit of Red Cross.

The report for the local chapter for
the month of February is as follows:
Attendance, 251; shipped to the head-
quarters in Charlotte the following: 190
scultetis bandages, 400 paper-back pads,
§00 gauze dressings 18x12, 76 pillows,
5 sweaters, 6 pair sox, 10 comfort bags.
7 hot water bag coyers, 50 pneumonia
braces. (These for Camp Greene).

The work room was closed one week
in February. This report shows much
diligence and speed on the part of the
workers, and it is an understood fact at
headquarters that the work from the Da-
vidson chapter is always first-grade.

DEMOCRACY OF THE RED CROSS.

Time was, tho it was never true, when
folks might say that the Red Cross rep-
resented only a certain class of the Amer-
ican public. That is, that it was repre-
sentative of the bankers and moneyed
interests and the so-called society types
of our cities and towns. But what can
be the attitude today, when twenty mil-
lion of our American people have vol-
untarily enrolled under the banner of
the American Red Cross?

This great multitude of people repre.
sents more than 20 per cent of our popu-
lation. It represents the lawyer, the
doctor and all the other professions. It
represents those in the business walks of
life. Big business? Yes, and little busi-
ness, too. It represents the mill workers,
the clerk behind the counter, the fash-
ionably dressed purchaser in sealskin
furs. And now, with this great army of
patriotic American citizens back of this
greatest of all single movements in the
world today, with a program rich in the
variety of opportunity for service which
it offers, the American Red Cross—your
Red Cross, our Red Cross—will make
advances absolutely inconceivible a short
time ago.

Let us bear in mind, there represents
a tremendous responsibility. It is a
responsibility of measuring up to the op-
portunity of playing a real part in this
World’s War. While the Red Cross,
thru its vast number of volunteer work-
ers in France and the countries of our
Allies, is truly fighting the American
fight, until our boys take their places in
the trenches; while it is actually repre-
senting the Spirit of America until that
time when our boys in khaki shall more
clearly demonstrate the American Spirit.
the great army of Red Cross members
and workers at home must keep ever
faithfully at it, in order te- clearly
demonstrate our ever willingness to sup-
port this great work. Membership is
all right in its place, but service is more
important still. Do something! There
is a part for each to play!

“Shun not the struggle.
God’s gift.”

| FORCEFUL APPEAL

MADE AT Y. M.C. A.

In an interesting and forceful appeal
to Christians to live a powerful life in
Christ’s service, Dr. W. W. Orr, pas-
tor of the A. R. P. Tabernacle, Char-
lotte, addressed the regular meeting of
the Y. M. C. A. last Thursday. His
appeal was based, as he explained, on
the fact that-only the Holy Spirit that
Christ promised to those who would
await in the upper room was able to
enable men to be truly great.

Dr. Orr said that even tho an indi-
vidual might be fully equipped in mat-
ters of education, money, social standing,
and the like, that he might never be
powerful. He deplored the fact that
the church is not taking advantage of
this reserve Power that is offered it, re-
marking that it seemed as if the state-
ment that one could rout a thousand and
two could put ten thousand to flight was
literally backwords, for it took so many.
so-called Christians to catch one' good
live sinner.

To gain real power from the Holy
Spirit, Dr. Orr said that certain things
were absolutely necessary. He pointed
out the ignorance of so many concerning
the Bible. Learn your Bible, he said,
not about it but what it is and what is
in it. Prayer was the next essential.
Luther prayed, Calvin prayed, Billy
Sunday prays, and so every man of pow-
er in God's service pravs. Power is
wrought thru prayer. But power can-
not flow thru channels that are stopped
up with sin and the next thing neces-
sary was to rid ourselves of sin, thought
sins, sins of imagination and desire.
Fourth, we must make restitution. This
is the hard thing toe do but, said the
speaker, it is an absolutely necessary
thing. Zaccheus was converted, said
Dr. Orr, between, the limb and the
ground. As evidence of this he cited
the fact he was willing to make restitu-
tion to those he had wronged. Lastly,
he said we must be willing to use the
power that is given to us.
should pull his own load.

Dr. Orr will long be remembered by
those who heard him as an impressive
speaker, full of his message of power.
