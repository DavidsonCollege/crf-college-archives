Movie Review

Assassins should be shot ©

By Ep AcLe
Movie Critc

I like action flicks. This can
be an embarrassing thing to admit
after having graduated from junior
high almost eight years ago, but
there’s no getting around it. Some-
thing about the loud explosions
and minimalist dialogue still ap-
peals to me. I don’t care if it’s
Sergio Leone’s The Man With No
Name Trilogy (the final film, The
Good, The Bad, and The Ugly,
being as close to perfection as any
film can ever be) or even that mid-
80s classic Remo Williams: The
Adventure Begins (presumably it
never ended since that was the
only film ever made with my buddy
Remo). If there’s something that
hasn’t been done before, or if the
film at least laughs at its own ab-
surdity, I can appreciate that.

Unfortunately, Assassins is
just about as tedious as they come.

What a snoozer! It’s a real
shame, because this film has an
action pedigree that any true afi-

cionado can appreciate. Sylvester
Stallone, who’s always funto laugh
at, plays an assassin who wants to
retire. Antonio Banderas, the title
character of Desperado (which I
thought was one of the summer’s
better films), is the young upstart
who wants to kill Stallone so that
he can be the best. Julianne Moore,
who was great in Short Cuts, plays
the token woman-in-peril needed
for every action film. Best of all,
however, Richard Donner directed
the film. His first two Lethal
Weapons, spectacles of fast, fre-
netic action sequences and sharp

wit, single-handedly resurrected

the buddy film.

Instead of turning out a film
up to those standards, he wastes all
his talent with this movie.

What made the Lethal Weapon
films work were their sense of hu-
mor and the likability of the two
main characters. Riggs was abso-
lutely, no-doubt-about-it insane in
the first one, but you still laughed
at his antics.

The second film only empha-

sized the bond between Danny
Glover and Mel Gibson. We cared
about them because they were two
good guys who anyone would want
to be friends with.

All the people in Assassins,
on the other hand, are creeps.
Stallone killed his best friend 15
years before. Banderas (overact-
ing to annoyance this time instead
of just merely skating on the edge
as he did in Desperado) is obnox-
ious. Moore is a wallflower — b-
o-r-i-n-g.

In order to make most action
films work, you have to have some
sense of peril, some fear that your
favorite characters aren’t going to
make it in the end.

You don’t have a sense of
danger in Assassins. All you have
is Stallone acting in another tired
action film, Moore squandering her
talents, and Banderas hoping that
one of the next zillion films of his
coming out this fall will do slightly
better.

Avoid this one like the plague.

sorts — all the while keeping in
mind that my goal was not to of-
fend the real-life counterparts of
my characters, but to compliment
them for their contributions to the
life and spirit of the college.”
Auditions were held in Sep-
tember, and rehearsal began al-
most immediately with the perfor-
mance date less thana month away.
Griffin and Costa combined their
talents to produce a wonderful

show in an extremely short time;
Griffin served as playwright and
musical director, Costa as direc-
tor.

The team (a total of 16 cast
members and countless others who
contributed much time and effort)
worked in Baker Sports Complex,
which proved to be both exciting
and challenging. They had to pro-
vide their own stage, lights, dress-
ing rooms, and sound system.
Ronnie Higdon, Gardener, and
Claudia Schinn helped in coordi-
nating these necessities.

The Great Honor Code Caper

was met with resounding appeal.
While Griffin was extremely
pleased with the success of the
show, he is quick to point out the
many that paved its way. At the
top of his list of gratitude are the
departments of English and the-
ater, where he was very active as
an undergraduate. Following (but
certainly not of any less impor-
tance) are the donors, volunteers,
and the faculty, staff and students
who worked with the Campaign
during the ‘past six years. Con-
gratulations on a successful cam-
paign and a wonderful show!
