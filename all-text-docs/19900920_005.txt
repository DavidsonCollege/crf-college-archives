Court Incapable of Holding Beer?

By RACHEL STARMER '93

Iam quite concerned,as I hope
we allare, about the alcohol policy
on this campus. I am rather dis-
turbed by Benji Ormand’s opinion
article (“Cure the Keg,” Sept. 6)
concerning the drinking problem
onthiscampus. Iagree with him in
his asscssment that the alcohol
problem is not a problem with the
alcohol, but with responsibility.

He writes that the problem isa:
“lack of responsible drinking
among Court party participants.”
ButI believe that the problem goes
beyond just irresponsible drink-
ing. Among students, among fel-
low human beings, there is a real
lack of responsibility for other
people. That is the root of the
problem. I agree, though, with
Ormand that declaring Davidsona
dry campus or banning kegs won’t
solve the problem—at least not
directly.

Tam distressed by the flippant
tone of Ormand’s article. Accord-
ing to his account of the Greck
Week disturbances, a group “drank
a little too much” and “near death
was involved.” Now, I think that if
“near death” came out from his
hiding place behind the trees—
however passive and without rea-

son as Ormand makes him out to ©

be—someone drank a good deal
more than “alittle toomuch.” This
attitude is that exact attitude the
has proved palterson Court i inca-
pable of holding its beer. ' yh

In-an age of: “complete inde-

‘sible Tact...

pendence,” people no longer feel
that they have any right to tell
others, even a friend, that what
they are doing is bad for them, or
that they don’t think they should
be doing it, i.e. drinking to excess.
I’m not saying that people should
not drink at all. Drinking in itself
is not harmful. But there is a dif-
ference, as we should all know, be-
tween social drinking and drunk-
enness. Drunkenness is not good
for you, your body or your mind.

Davidson is producing

alcoholics, if not de-
pendent on the actual
substance, than de-
pendent on the atti-
tude—denial.

The real problem at Davidson lies
in that people will not take respon-
sibility to tell someone that they
should stop drinking. Too many of

. usjuststumble overour classmates

who are incapable of finding their
own way home.

Benji Ormand seems to feel
OK, though, because he can make
ithome. He writes: “I have always
felt comfortable at a court party
knowing no matter how irrespon-
at least I can walk
home and spare others the reper-
cussions of my foolishness.” But,

_ Task him and others like him—are
youalso sparing yourself yourown ‘|

human. dignity? What if you

couldn’t make it home—will there
be people sober enough, respon-
sible enough, to take care of you—
all passed out on the floor. You
yourself may not be the type to

pass out cold, but some are. And.

even if you do make it back, week-
end after weekend, there’s some-
thing wrong with being in that
condition time after time. Would
anyone tell you? Or, will you
eventually die, if not physically,
mentally—becoming a person with
a sole direction and desire toward
the bottle?

Something necds to happen.
Wecan’tgoonlike this. Davidson
is producing alcoholics, if not
dependenton the actual substance,
than dependent on the attitude—
denial.. We make less of the fright-
ening stories by using the passive
voice, attempting to say that there
isn’t anything wrong here and that
the administration and trustees have
no justifiable reason for stepping
in.

Yes, the problem is the stu-
dents’ problem, but we don’t seem
capable of taking care of ourselves
oreach other. Yes, police and tele-
phone poles are less forgiving—
but are we to be forgiven uncondi-
tionally and without conse-
quence—like children? I don’t
claim to know how to solve this,
save a drastic attitude change in
thestudent body. I hope noone has
to die for that, as if no one has ever
died before.

Let's Be Honest

Before we get started this week,
I need to take a few lines to apolo-
gize for a mistake I made in last

week’scolumn. The titleofRobert

Fulghum’s little book is All  Re-
ally Needed to Know I Learned in
Kindergarten, not,asI wrote, Eve-
rything I Ever Needed to Know I
Learned in Kindergarten. I beg

ie lonso w h ‘

have offended with such an outra-
geous inaccuracy.

You must understand, how-
ever, that the mere mention of that

_ heart warming collection of essays

brings tears to my eyes and a lump
to my throat, and I just can’t think
through the overwhelming haze of
emotion. Anyway, I’m sorry for

Well then, we have morc press-
ing concerns to address. We all
know the swinging, hot, yowser -

Davidson’s alcohol policy. The

Male, Hairy Legs,
and What of It?

By TOSH CRYSTAL '93

OK men, I’m here to save face
for our half of the human race.
Let’s talk about how bad we ain’t.
WhenIwasajunior in highschool,
I began to notice that the feminist-
liberation movement was becom-
ing less ofa thing to read about and
more of something that affected
me. I inno way mean that I felt it
was all claptrap. There are some
things that are very much valid
about the women’s liberation
movement.

But ..I also feel that.a huge
amount of it is pure nonsense. It
strikes meas vengeful and inflam-
matory bittemmess that does noth-
ing butharmand perhaps even scts
back the women’s movement. For
starters, the first thing that ever got
on my nerves about feminism was
the title Ms.. What is Ms? It’s not
real English. _My teachers all got

madatme (this affected my grades)
when I refused to say Ms. Whom-
ever.... It’s Miss. No other lan-
guagchas devcloped a Ms. besides
ours. Scems like they know some- ~
thing we don’t. (Spanish accepted
Mrs.= Sefiora,; Miss= Sejiorita.)
There’s not even a long version of
Ms:.How would you spell it?
mizzz? mizs? get outta here, we
know it ain’t anymore a rcal word
that oh, say..”ain’t” for example.
Boarding school feminists also
chastised me for such sins as hold-
ing doors and saying “Ma’am.”
Yeah, right.

This Icvel of feminist theory
has followed me to Davidson.
(Remember Ms. Kendall’s sugges-
tion for prom kings?!? Hee hee.
Oh, hey, I’m not laughing. Hon-
est.) Meanwhile I’m reading in-
structions on how to treat what,
hairy-legged women from Cali-
