DAVIDSON COLLEGE

Davidson’s GPA
lower than peers’

By KATE GILLESPIE
Staff Writer

At last Thursday’s SGA meeting,
senators discussed SGA’s response
to research showing that GPAs at
Davidson are lower than those at
Davidson’s peer institutions.

President Tom Ross commis-
sioned Linda LeFauve, Director of
Planning and Institutional
Research, to conduct the study.
LeFauve requested that Higher
Education Data Sharing (HEDS)
schools share the mean GPAs of
their 2007 graduating classes.

The mean GPA for the 35
schools that responded was 3.28.
Davidson’s mean GPA of 3.18
placed the school 29th on the list of
35.

The respondents to LeFauve’s
request for mean GPAs included 11
of Davidson’s 19 peer institutions.
The mean GPA for this group was
3:38. Davidson’s GPA was the low-
est.

The highest GPA amongst peer
institutions was 3.5, which came
from a school in the Midwest. The
school that ranked directly above
Davidson was a Southern school
where the mean GPA was 3.27.

The research was presented to
the Educational Policy Committee
(EPC) on March 31.

Meikaela Zwieryznski °10, stu-
dent liaison to the EPC and head of

the Student Affairs Committee,
presented the findings to senators
at Thursday’s meeting.

According to Zwieryznski, fac-
ulty members on the EPC respond-
ed by saying that the research does
not indicate that Davidson is
deflating grades, but rather that
other schools are inflating them.

Senators, however, ignored this
question of semantics and dis-
cussed the effects of lower overall
grades for Davidson graduates.

“This mainly affects students
applying to law school, med school
and grad school,” Whitney White
08 said.

White also cited the importance
of GPAs for students seeking jobs
in financial institutions and on Wall
Street, both of which have “pretty
serious cut-offs” for GPAs.

Zwieryznski said that the EPC’s
discussion of this issue reached the
conclusion that, although graduates
may initially receive mediocre
jobs, ‘“‘a liberal arts education will
prepare you with the analytical
skills” for better jobs in the future.

According to Zwieryznski, fac-
ulty on the committee also said that
raising Davidson GPAs would sac-
rifice the school’s academic
integrity.

“They’re worried about lowering
the bar, lowering the standard,”

College braces for high yield

By Suzie Eck.
Editor-in-Chief

Davidson College typically aims
for an incoming freshman class
size of 460-470 students, but what
happens when one of the nation’s
top liberal arts colleges goes on a
NCAA Tournament rampage,
knocking out powerhouses like

Gonzaga, Georgetown and
Wisconsin on its way to an Elite
Eight berth?

Since mailing out acceptance let-
ters to about 930 high school sen-
iors almost two weeks ago, the
Davidson Admissions staff, as well
as the Residence Life Office and
Dean of Students, have wrestled
this question.

The Admissions Office has
awarded roughly the same number
of acceptance letters as last year.
However, because of an increase in
number of applications, only about
26 percent of applicants received
admission.

Typically, Davidson anticipates
about a 29 percent yield — the term

for the number of accepted stu-
dents who choose to enroll.

So far, the yield this month
shows no deviation from the usual,
which is some comfort to students,
faculty and staff.

While there is no sure way to
determine the exact yield ahead of
time, the basketball team’s success
has thrown the inexact science out
the window, replacing it with a
giant question mark. Admissions,
the Dean of Students and the
Residence Life Office have donat-
ed many man hours to developing a
variety of contingency plans, just
in case Davidson receives, say, 20-
100 extra students next year.

Director of Residence Life Patty
Perillo is currently working on a
variety of models based on the
number of freshmen exceeding
available beds. She will present
these models as suggestions to the
Dean of Students sometime next
week.

“It’s good practice to think
“What if?’” she said. In the past,
Davidson has usually had more

first-year students than available
first-year beds and has thus con-
verted hall lounges into dorm
rooms. However, Perillo hopes to
avoid this common practice.

“We are deeply committed to
keeping the freshman lounges,”
she said. “Common areas build
communities in halls and enrich the
cohort experience.”

In an effort to replace the beds
lost due to the renovation of fresh-_
man dormitories Watts and
Richardson this summer, Perillo,
with the combined input of both
staff and students, recently decided
to use the larger Cannon Dorm as a
freshman building while housing
upperclassmen in Little Dorm.

Still, Perillo admits that if a larg-
er-than-usual incoming freshman
class makes it necessary, lounges
might have to be converted into
rooms.

The use of the Davidson town-
homes, as well as Davidson-owned
houses in the town, is also under

Genius brings batteries to life

By Nina Mace
News Editor

On Tuesday night, acclaimed
scientist Dr. Angela Belcher visited
campus to present the 2008 Smith
Lecture.

Belcher is the Germeshausen
Professor of Materials Science and

Biological Engineering at
Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.

Her talk was entitled, “From
Nature and Back Again: Giving
New Life to Materials for Energy,
Electronics, and the Environment.”

Belcher won a MacArthur

“Genius” award in 2004, and she
was the 2006 Researcher of the
Year in Scientific American. Dr.
David Brown, Professor of
Chemistry at Davidson, described
Belcher’s work as “innovative,
interdisciplinary, cutting-edge
research.”

According to her biography on
the MIT website, “The focus of Dr.
Belcher’s research is understand- ~
ing and using the process by which
Nature makes materials in order to
design novel hybrid organic inor-
ganic electronic and ‘magnetic
materials on new length scales.”

Last night, Belcher’s lecture

focused specifically on her team’s
development of a new lithium ion
battery.

Belcher said the main questions
with which she began her research
were: “Can we give genetic infor-
mation to systems that don’t have
genetic material?” and “ Can we
pass on genetic code to a battery or
a solar cell?”

Belcher’s research works with a
new set of building materials:
viruses. Though a virus may sound
ominous to the general public,
these viruses are benign and
