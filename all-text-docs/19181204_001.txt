S. A. T. C. Mustered Out This Week

Davidson Defeated by Clemson In
Gruelling Contest on Muddy Field

Tigers Gained Single Touchdown in
: First Quarter.

The last game of the season, with old
man §. O. L. hanging around, was play-
ed at Clemson Thanksgiving in a beau-
tiful little lake.

_ It is true that we had something to
be thankful for, if we did lose; that is,
that none of our men were drowned.
As things were, Davidson played rings
around the ‘Tigers, playing on the defen-
sive only once, in the first quarter. Da-
vidson kicked to Clemson, who brought
the ball to mid-field where it stayed for
quite a while, ‘when Clemson, by full
strength, pushed it down to Davidson's

two yaed line, there they fumbled,
Crouch recovering. Clemson then start-
ed on the defensive, while Davidson was
about to run a punt formation, when the
referee's whistle blew, the result being
that he did not see the fumble, and there-
fore had to give the ball to Clemson,
who skidded over the goal line, the
touch down being made in rt minutes.

By this time the Wildcats realized that

they had to stand.on their fect. From
that minute on, Clemson played on the
defensive, being unable to get the ball in
Davidson's territory, or near it. Being
unable to hold the ball, Spann could not
launch any of his overhead attacks,
though he showed his usual good judg-
ment when he did not try as many as
the Tigers threw away.

For Davidson, Massey and Douglass
did defensive work that made many a
spectator gasp, while Spann and Johnson
‘proved to be the spced demons . and
ground gainers of the game. Crouch
came up to his usual standard, and the
line played well tho they were heavily
outweighed by the Tigers.

Frew and Swectenburg were the de-
fensive men for Clemson, gvhile Allison,

In the meeting of the. upper classes,
held Wednesday afternoon, a temporary
Student Council was elected. These will
serve until January 15, when a perma-
nent Council will be elected. This will
be done so as to give a chance for the
men who are now elsewhere in the serv-
ice, and who expect to return to Da-
vidson after Christmas. Election was as
follows: President of student body, E.
A. Woods; two vice-presidents, L. L.
McAlister and D. MM. Chalmers.

President of senior class. C. B. Rob-
son; student-councilmen, J. L. Boswell.

son: student-councilmen, W. F. Hall,
Jr.. A. L. Fosque and R. T. Allison.

President of sophomore class. L. B.
Shenck; student-couneilmen. W.  P.

R.0.T.C. to Be Estab-
lished in January

Requires Four Hours Drill A Week.
Credit as One Ticket.

On Saturday, November 30, the an-
nouncement wis made by Dr. Martin in
chapel, that Davidson would become a
reserve officers’ training corps if the stu-
dents desired it. A vote was taken
among those present who expected to re-
turn after Christmas and 120 hands were
raised in favor of the plan. As the gov-
ernment requires a minimum of only
100 it is practically certain that David-
son will be organized into an R. O. ‘TV.
C. after the holidays.

From statements concerning this or-
ganization as it existed last year we in-
fer that it will be conducted this year
somewhat as follows: Each man will
be issued a uniform and rifles with addi-
tional articles probably, such as an over-

coat, extra breeches and barracks caps.-

though this has not been definitely stated.
There will be about four hours a. week
drill and one hour of theoretical instruc-
tion. Credit for these hours will be
given, so that they will count as a ticket,
and will take the place of the gymnasium
class in the case of freshmen and sopho-
mores. ‘The commandant will be an of-
ficer who has had five years’ training at
least. and perhaps may be a West Point
graduate.

The discipline will be enforced by the
college and there will be very few  re-
strictions as there are at present. Hnlist-
ment in the R. O. T. C. will be optional,
but will be most advisable for fresh-
men and sophomores.

Some talk has been heard about juniors

and seniors receiving $9.00 a month from;

the government, provided they have had
a year’s military experience and are will-
ing to attend a summer camp of. six
weeks which is arranged for all R. O.
T. C. organizations. Of course this is
merely a presumption from the plan of
last vear and cannot be taken as a posi-
tive fact.

On the whole the establishment of an
R. O. T. C. will be a fine thing for the
students and all seem to be anxious to
enlist.

Bob Miles, Ex. ’11 Is
New “Y” Secretary

Davidson Welcomes an Old Son. Mr.

Rutland Leaves.

Along with a joyful report that all
would be mustered out on the morrow
came the gladsome news on “Tuesday aft-
ernoon that a new “Y" man from over-
seas had been seen on the Davidson cam-
pus and was to be located here perma
nently despite the disbanding of the S. A.
TC. units. ‘This seemed too goud to
be true. Ft has been said, “ht never rains
but it pours.” Certainly this has been
Davidson's good luck, for, as fortune
would have it, the “Old College” has
gotten back one of her own sons and a
beloved alumnus, Mr. Robt. W. Miles,
ex'tr, of Richmond, Va.

Mr. Miles came to Davidson in 1907,
and during his four years within. the
walls of the college worked himself into
the intimacy of everyone, professors and
students.. His warm disposition caused
him to become a universal favorite on the
campus, and he is still remembered «
“Bob” Miles. “Bob” was hailed ay an
all-round fellow when here, a, good stu-
dent, a lover of athietics, and ready to
take his part in the literary society, or
any other student activity. In the win-
ter of his sentor year, and only a short
while before graduation, he suffered a
broken hip in a class football game and
had to be taken to Johns Hopkins Hos-
pital far several months’ treatment.

This prevented his graduation and
he went on to Union Seminary where he

Martin by the committee of six delegates
to interview him on this matter, and aft-

granted by the faculty.

A MERRY CHRISTMAS AND A HAPPY NEW YEAR

Large Number Expect to Return For
Spring Term.

One never knows what is going 10
happen on the morrow, Just as the bat-
talion was reconciling itselt toa stay in
the army until nest Jane, the unexpected
happened. ‘Uhe S. ALT. C. was to be
mustered out on the. fourth.

Last Wednesday Lieutenant Deanard
called an assembly of the entire battalion
for 1 o'clock, lnstantly cach man felt
that something concerning hin was
about to be foretold. “Chis premonition
was well founded, for earlier in the fore-
noon the feutenant told Company "DD"
it would be unwise for thea to spend
any more money on uniforms ov military
accessyries, and one who was unable wo,
see that disbanding was very probable
was hopelessly dull, “Phe news: spread
like witdiire and imbued evervone with
a tense but subdued excitement. Some
thought mustering out would begin be-
fore night but these thoug!'ts were soon.
dispelled when the Lieutenant in’ very
few words informed them that muster-
ing o#t of this unit: would begin on
Wednesday, the fourth, and be rushed
to a satisfactory end as quickly, as pos-
sible.

He then cautioned the companies not
to grow lax or get the “don't care” spirit
in the few remaining days, pointing: out
the great influence .of an “excellent”
service record as well as the tremendous
advantages,

The reason for the week’s notice was
apparent. Some of the men were anx-
ious, now that the war is over, to get
back to ‘their position in’ civilian life,
where they are doubtless needed. ‘The
notice prives them tine to make their
*| plans, -

But the advantages of just two more
weeks of sta¥ at. college until the term
ends is also well worth considering. Men
in the S. A.V. C. will be given credit
