THE DAVIDSONIAN, JANUARY 20, 1927

She—'You are
have.”

Soup Campbell—“What, handsome ?”

She—"No, always broke.”

A woman's most peculiarly made up, She's
faithful, deceitful, keen-sighted and_ blind.
She's crazy, simple, she’s cruel, she's kind;

she'll lift up a man, she'll cast a man down; |
she'll call him her king and then make him |

her clown. You fancy she’s this, but you find

‘that she’s that, for she'll play like a kitten |

and bite like a cat.

She—"Oh, Roger, I heard you made the
football team at Davidson.”
Roger Hall—‘Yes, I do the aerial work.”
She—""What's that ?”
Hall—"I blow up the footballs.”
Poor Richard Again
Early to bed, and early to rise
Keeps one’s roommate from wearing one’s
ties.

Father of Date—*Young man, would you
mind calling me when you leave tonight. I’ve
got to be up early in the morning.”

Covington—"Does your new play have a
happy ending ?”

Wharton—"Yes, everybody was glad when
it was over.”

Mrs. X—"How’s your husband getting
along with golf?”

Mrs. Y—“Just fine. The children are a!-
lowed to watch him now.”

Tramp—‘Good lady, can’t you give me a
piece of cake?”

Lady—"Cake !
for you?”

Tramp—“Ordinarily, but this is my birth-
day.”

King (after quarrel with Sweetic)—“Well,
there’s just as many fish in the pond as have
been caught.”
She—"“Maybe so. But you'll never catch
any of them with that line you have.”

Professor’s Wife—‘“Dear, what
opening that can with?”

Professor—“Why, a can opener.

Professor's wife—“Well, from what I was
able to hear I thought you were opening it
with prayer.”

Preston—“Every time I kiss you I’m a bet-
ter man.” ,
She—“Oh, you little angel.”

Sims—-"Professor, isn’t there some fable |

just like the doll I used to |

Professor in Sociology—Suppose a man
| were drowning and yelled for help. His wite
{hears him and immediately runs toward thy
bank. . Now, if there is no altruism, why
| did she run to the bank?”

Crinkley—"'To get his inusrance, sir.”

Pee-Wee—"Do you keep cigars ?”
Skit—""No, we sell them.”
Pee-Wee—"Well, you can keep the one I |
| was going to buy from you.”

The Bible teacher was giving an oral re- |
view on the book of Proverbs. “Tell me the |
word,” he said, “that fits in here.” |

“Cleanliness is next to ;

Zeb Vance -scratched his head for a mo

A Scotchman’s wife went on an excursion
| with a crowd of friends. That afternoon a
| newsboy was heard to cry out, “Extra! Spe
leial Edition! Read all about the big excur- |
|sion wreck! Forty lives lost!" A- friend
| who was walking with the Scotchman, asked :
“Why, McGibbs, why don’t you buy a paper
land see if your wife is one of the victims?” |
| “Ah, Ul just wait till the final edition,” |
l replied the Scotchman, “and get the baseball |
scores, too.”

We are told that Dumb Dora who thought |
{the Hunchback was a football picture, now |
}has a sister who things the famous Nelson |
lof maritime fame has a grandson they call |
| Half.

Mrs. X—"Your son must be the idol of the |

| family.” |
Mrs. Y—‘Yes, he’s been idle for twenty- |
one years,”

Old Maid Teacher—“What tense is, ‘T am |
beautiful?” |
Little Willie—“Past, ma'am.”

Brown—‘“Look here, young fellow, this is
the third time I've had to ask you for that |
five dollars I loaned you.”

Black—“Oh, but just think how many
times I had to ask you before you'd let me

have it.”

The Bootblack—“Light or dark, sir?”
Absent-minded Prof.—"Oh, it doesn’t mat- |
ter, but please don't give me the neck.”

Which. makes us think of the absent
minded cook who boiled his watch and looked
at an egg for two minutes.

Ready for Charity

What could be more foolish than a dumb

girl turning a deaf ear on a blind date.

“Speaking of fine tobaccos

—-Have a Camel

A NICETY of blending, a friendly
cordiality of flavor, an inherent
goodness that thrills from the first
puff to the last — that’s Camels.
The warmth of golden sunlight on
autumn fields gleams in their smoke.

Camels are an expression of all

._ that is the finest.

Camel quality and Camel excel-
lence are recognized wherever
smokers gather. The best of Turk-

ish and Domestic tobaccos are

blended in this famous cigarette.
For this reason Camels have con-
sistent goodness. For this reason
they never tire the taste, no matter
how liberally you smoke them;

never leave a cigaretty after-taste.

And wherever experienced smok-
ers gather, wherever the conversa-
tion turns to tobacco — to the
world’s best — someone is sure to
say: “Speaking of fine tobaccos

. . . Have a Camel!”
