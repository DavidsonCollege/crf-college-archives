Social Security

Under the leadership of the fraternities
at Amherst College, there is growing over
the country a campaign to petition con-
gress to exempt college students from the
Social Security payments. This campaign
seems to be based on the following assump-
tions: (1) The Social Security is a tax (2)
College students should not pay any-tax un-
til they get out into life. (3) The Social
Security is meant to benefit the participants
in it, and college students will most likely
receive no benefits. (4) Regular college em-

!

ployes are exempt, and there is no differ-
ence between them and students.

Before anyone lends | support to this
campaign he would do well to look at the
other side of the question. In answer to
the above contentions the following, among
many other things, can be said:

(1) The

“ST. LOUIS BLUES"—Dorothy
Lamour, Lloyd Nolan, and Jessie
Ralph.

The plot is washed along by a
Mississippi flood. Miss Lamour
plays a blues singer who has been
masquerading on a_ barnstorming
tour as Aloma of the South Seas.
Tired of her sarong, she runs away
from her manager, joins up with a
show boat managed by Mr. Nolan.
The boat is beached on the lawn
of Tito Guizar’s plantation. But in
no time there is romance on board
as the boat, awash again,
southward.

The Mississippi River is the
Paramount's big $20,000 concrete
tank which holds 375,000 gallons of
water.

This is a chance for Nolan to get
back into big films and there’s La-
mour with and without her sarong.

Besides playing host to the an-
nual Southern Conference basket-
ball tournament, Raleigh was also
a center of gay social activity last

week-end. It was a merry place
with all the eliminated teams being
fixed up with dates and invited to
rounds of parties so that it was al-
most hard to decide whether more
fun was had by the tournament
winners or those teams eliminated
in the first round.

Johnny Tice captured the hearts
of the crowd with his brilliant floor
work, just as he has done here for
the last three years, but his con-
quest of one heart did not end with
Davidsdn’s/ elimination; he got a
date with her for Monday night by
a long distan¢e call which incident-
ly was placed by another person.

I never realized Ned Iverson had
such a gruesome puss until sev-
eral people in Rgleigh mistook this
columnist for thé Miami Swisher.
Lock Hunter also came in for his
share of tribute by being mistaken
several times for J. P. Tice.

But while basketball held the
spotlight other things were hap-
pening around-about .The Tobacco
Road appearances in Charlotte and
Statesville drew large crowds_ of
Davidsons, more for the purpose
of finding out just how much the
censors missed than for a genuine
interest in dramatics, if current re-
ports are right. Those attending
testify that the censors must have
used up a lot of pencil lead mark-
ing out the script.

One carlgad of boys ostensibly
headed for Raleigh was sidetracked
in Greensboro and ended up’ in
Lynchburg where a most enjoy-
able time was had by all. The most
interesting thing seen by them was
Colonel Liipfert displaying a bor-
rowed Phi Bete key before the eyes
of Randolph Macon femmes. This
was necessitated by the failure of
the Colonel’s key to arrive in time
to be worn.

visited the campus Friday night,
Jim Ballard and Dave King, who
have been directing lovely dovey
feclings in the direction of two
Queens girls for years now, turn-
ed their attention on Converse gals

this, because such unorthodox

orders were given to shorten all

he couldn’t come and the orders
were cancelled. It’s as simple as
that.
