SWIM OR SINK, SON!

Everyone knows the story about the young boy
whose first trip to the seashore becomes a nightmare
when his dad abruptly scoops him up, pitches him into
the water and exclaims, “Swim or sink, son!” The dad
figures that the boy will soon discover that he’d best
swim.

In many ways Lefty Driesell is very much like this
youngster. He has made his first trip to the college
basketball ranks as coach, and now the bigger guys, the
“daddys” of the conference, are hollering, “Recruit or
sink, son!” So Lefty has decided he'd best recruit.

GO GET ‘EM LEFTY

Earlier this week, Lefty took off for the Midwest—
land of wheat, friendly people, healthy hogs, and damn
good basketball players. His itinerary looked like Gen.
Sherman’s except on the other side of the fence. He
left with high spirits and an empty pocketbook (well
almost).

Lefty’s got his problems this first time out into the
dog-eat-dog world of recruiting. Although he’s got more
full scholarships (five) to dish out than any Davidson
basketball mentor before, he still has the perennial
problems his predecessors have had. He lacks travel
expenses, which are so necessary to today’s coach who
goes thousands of miles just to see one boy. He hasn’t
got the “big name” schoo] to offer to these kids. He can’t
offer an ‘all play, no work” schedule that so many
coaches can and do. And he can’t compare Hattie’s to a
supper club or a rathskeller, nor can he stack Queens
up against having women on campus.

So, our enthusiastic rookie must do some fast talking.
He’s got to talk about the importance of a good college
education, the Davidson gentlemen, the friendly atmo-
sphere, and the faculty-student relationship. He’d better
not mention Chapel, Vesper, review periods, and the
“fly” problem.

And while he’s doing all his talking, Adolph Rupp,
Frank McQuire, Everett Case, Vic Bubas, Chuck Noe,
Bones McKinney, and other well-knowns are going to be
whispering in the boy’s other ear.

UH, OH, ... COLLEGE BOARD

Even if Lefty does get a boy interested in Davidson,
he’s got domestic troubles. College board scores come out
soon, and it’s feasible that many of these kids’ scores
won’t be high as their basketball scoring average.

That’s when Lefty’s biggest headache goes into
action — the admissions board. It has been known to
keep one or two athletes out of here.

Lefty’s local adversaries also say, “There of lots of
bright young men in our own state. who can play basket-
ball.” When do you remember reading about a really out-
standing basketball product from the North Carolina
high schools? O yeah, we forgot—Walt Bellamy, Indiana’s
All-American, the Negro boy from New Bern, N. C.

But we've seen Lefty Driesell do things before we
didn’t think he could do. Count on Davidson having some
good freshmen basketball players next year.

VPI Performance
Earns Branch WOW

Our “Wildcat of the Week” is
Barry Branch, junior sprinter
for Davidson's vastly improved
swimming team. Branch _re-
wrote the record books with a
phenomenal individual perform-
ance at VPI last week. .

Besides tying his own school
record of 24.2 seconds in the
50-yard free style, Branch fell
only one-tenth of a second short
of his 100-yard free style record
of 53.4 seconds.

While doing all this, Branch
was winning three first places
and breaking the VPI pool
record in both events already
mentioned. To add icing to
the cake, he teamed with Bob
McDonald, Tom Hudgins, and
Carter Mebane to equal their
400-yard relay record of 3:43
minutes.

" Sluggers Prep For

Visit To Catawba

By GEORGE PEPPER
Davidsonian Sports Writer

Warm weather and sunny skies have blessed the
early practice sessions of the baseball team as it prepares
for the season’s opener this Wednesday. The clouters will
journey into Catawba territory with high hopes of making
up for last year's loss to the Indians.

Coach Tom Stevens - said,
“Catawba always plays good

ball.” Stevens expects a close
game.
“We're looking pretty good,

but a let will depend on the

pitching:” he added.
PROBABLE STARTERS

As a tentative line-up for the
Catawba ‘game Stevens named
Tom Harris, Nick Daves and
Jerry Shelton as probable pitch-;
ers: Harry Cline, catcher; Tom
Harris, first base: Tommy Tut-
tie, second; Harry Smith or,
Graham Showalter, shortstop:
team captain Russ Cotton, third: |
Ed Hines, left field; Tommy
Hamilton, center; and Jerry Cole
in right field.

Cole and Cotton are the only
seniors on the squad this year,
but with the twelve lettermen
returning to the team, experi-
ence is not lacking.

Ed Hines, last year's leading
hitter at’.388, and Harry Cline,
elected last year to the second
All-Conference team, should be
mainstays to the squad’s power
throughout the season.

Stevens said that he hopes
to “at least break even" this
season, and he added thaf the
team should have a better rec-
ord than the 7-13 posted last
year.

Gridders Begin
Spring Drills

By JOHN SPRATT
Davidsonian Sports Writer

Twenty-three lettermen strong, the Wildcat gridders
began a four-session-a-week spring training schedule, in
an effort Monday to remove the cobwebs from what may
prove to be a formidable football machine.

If the end of last year can be
used as a criteria, Coach Bill
Dole believes that he has reason
to expect a big season for the
pigskin game this fall.

Explains Dole, “We heve
more depth and more exper-
lence thet we've had at De-
vidson in a long time.” Nine-
teen newcomers bolstar the
already sturdy frame of
returning varsity players,

Still clinging to last fall’s de-
fensive strategy, Dole intends

to carry out the same stress in
spring practice. The defensive
unit, recruited from the best
defensive players, will again be
given foremost priority. From
the remaining a second squad
will be formed, the two units
clashing in an intra-squad game
scheduled for Saturday, April 15.

Injuries have ag yet to take
their toll among the Wildcats,
and Coach Dole accredits the
team spirit for the first sessions
as “very fine.”

On hand to greet Mintz
were the following lettermen
from last year’s team: Doug
Orr, Finley Lee, Andy Sher-
rill, and Stefan Young. Up
from last season's frosh are
Bobby Austell, Bill Backland,
and Fred Loop. Also Nick
Cooper, foreign student from
Englend, is expected to help
out.

Coach Tom Scott announced
qualifying for the golf team
will be held this coming
Monday afternoon, March 13, at
the local course in Mooresville.

Scott has only one returning

letterman from last spring’s
Southern Conference champions
— Verner Stanley, who was
medalist at the conference tour-
nament.

The ‘Cats also copeted in

firing. In team competition
Davidson managed a seventh

Tomorrow afternoon the Daj

in the Atlantic Coast Conference
indoor track meet at Chapel |
Hill. Present at the meet will be
not only the ACC teams, but also
Southern Conference teams.

Davidson and the other South-

participating in the non-con-
ference division.

This trip will be no field day
for the Wildcats; in fact, close
examination of the records
would reveal that in many cases
the competition in the Southern
conference is tougher than that
in the ACC.

When Gene Segin got his B.S. in Business Ad-
