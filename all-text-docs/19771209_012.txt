Percy Badham

My name is Percy Badham;
am a rising Senior, and I
am running for the Hearing
Committee. I do not feel that
in this particular race that I
need to try to impress you by
listing all the activities I have
been involved in or my qualif-
ications.

However, I do think that I
should say that I strongly
believe in the Honor Code and
have great pride in the fact
that it does work here at
Davidson.

Also, I feel that it is
important for a Hearing Com-
mittee member to be fair,
open-minded, and honest, ev-
en though these may be gener-
al, overused terms, I think
they are vital to the job.

So I am asking you to give
me _a chance to make my
contribution to the Honor
System and to Davidson Col-

lege. ~

Jamile Bryan

I have always been
concerned about upholding the
Honor System and would like
to become more actively invol-
ved in the workings of the
svstem through the Hearing

Committee. Another concern I
hold is the general relations of
students to other students.
Here: ags

again since the Hearing
Committee will be dealing
more and more with the Code
of Responsibility I feel I can
best uphold the code by bec-
oming a member.

Jack Griffeth

Few colleges today abide by
an honor system. Davidson is
one of these rare institutions.
Our system of self scheduled
exams, as well as the other
aspects of the honor code must
be preserved. If elected, I will
do my best to maintain and
strenghten this unique syst-
em.

Larry Jones

The Honor Code is the most
important force a Davidson
student faces everyday. It is
what sets this school apart
from any others

It is a beautiful priviledge
we enjoy because of the qual-
ity of persons found on our
campus. This priviledge must
be preserved.

The faculty and staff, as
well as fellow students, need
to be assured that the Honor
Code is the system that all

Davidsonians will willingly

uphold and support.
This might necessarily

involve a compus wide reas-
sessment of the Honor Code
and of the individual’s respon-
sibilities.

John Madden

The honor code at Davidson.

sets us apart from the great
mass of colleges and universit-
ies across the country. It gives
us, as Students, freedoms and
privileges unheard of at most
other academic institutions.

The honor code is something
we should work hard to pres-
erve and keep free from
obuse.

However, in recent years,
aspects of the Honor
system, or the way in which it
is applied and enforced, have
fallen into a state of disrepair.
Theft and vandalism on camp-
us are increasing at tremend-
ous rates.

Granted, much of this can
be attributed to persons out-
side the college community,
and external security must
be tightened, but, we can
hardly claim that all Davidson
students are quilt free.

Possible remedies for this
situation might include stric-
ter enforcement of penalties
and greater student awareness
of the problems at hand.

Each individual could then
be more of a contributing
factor in the prevention of
infractions and in the contin-
uing improvement of the Hon-
or System here at Davidson.

Bonnie Wright
Our honor system is the
most valuable institution of
Davidson College. Only as hall
counselor did the full weight of
its value appear to me, as I

_sought to instill a sense of

desire and responsibility for
the Honor Code within my hall
of freshmen.

I was faced with trying to
explain how the system allows
us to live in a community of
trust and how difficult it is to
maintain a system that places
so much responsibility and
demand for self-discipline u-
pon each of us.

As a member of the Hearing
committee, I will establish
ways of reaching upperclass-
men to reemphasize the spirit
and mechanisms of the Honor
Code. I will seek to determine
the feeling of our professors
concerning the weakness of
the system and how we can
strengthen it. I will involve
more of the student body

in discussion and activity

which will heighten sensitivity
to the necessity of maintaining
the Honor Code as an institu-
tion which is vital to the type
of community we desire to live
in.

Rising Juniors

Laura Cates

The trusting atmosphere
which surrounds the Davidson
students and the respect
which the students maintain
for one another as a result of
the Honor Code are unique
aspects of Davidson College.

The responsibility to uphold
this quality, therefore, lies
with the students. As a mem-

ber of the Hearing Committee,

I feel that I could better
participate as a student in
encouraging the continuation
of this trust, respect and
responsibility.

Elizabeth Dean

Although there is little
puplicity about the activities
of the Hearing Committee,
this group is an integral part
of the Davidson College Com-
munity. I realize tha obligat-
ions of this office and if elected

will do my best to submit only

impartial and fair decisions.
The students on the
Hearing Committee have a
reponsibility to themselves
and the Davidson Honor
Code. I will make every effort
to uphold this responsibil'ty.

Mary Gray Gilchrist

If a student walks away
from Davidson with nothing
else, at least one thing he or
she will have gained is an
understanding of the word
“honor.” We are constantly
reminded that Davidson’s
Honor System is a unique
aspect of thecollege; few
schools offer self-scheduled
exams, open stacks in the
library, and the opportunity to
leave doors unlocked with
little worry.

This is Davidson’s
stronghold;if it crumbles, so
does the school. I want to see
the integrity of the college
upheld, which is why I am
running for the Hearing Com-
mittee.

Martha Macgill

Responsibility and concern
are key words when one
speaks about Hearing Com-
mittee. The Hearing Com-
mittee deals with Honor Code
violations.

A violation of the Hanor
Code is a serious matter--a
student’s future can ride on
the outcome of the Honor
Code case.

Those who are chosen to

serve on Hearing Committee
must realize the responsibility
of a committee member to
protect the rights of the
students involved.

For our Honor Code to
work, the students must feel
they are represented fairly.

As a candidate, I pledge
that I understand this respon-
sibility and, if elected, hold
the future of the individual as
well as the Honor Code itself
in great importance.

Burkley Mann

After a year at Davidson I
still get excited when I leave
my books on a bench on the
way to the Post Office know-
ing that even my pencil will be
there when I come back. The
strong Honor System that
makes such confidence possib-
le here depends on an effective
student hearing committee

and a student body that is
constantly aware of the ramif-
ications having such a system.
The purpose of the Hearing

Committee is to prevent
infractions of the Honor Code
through education of the stud-
ents, paricularly the freshmen,
and to help correct infractions
through trials.

The job requires the
intelligence: and good judge-
ment characteristic of most
students here. But it also
takes a clever understanding
of the Code of Responsibility
and a 1 willingness to accept the
responsibility of deciding a
fellow student’s future and to
take time talking to people.
Having a good Honor

System means so much to me
that I am more than willing
to give up time and possibly
tranquility to the Honor Sys-
tem as soon as I am given the
chance.

George Murdaugh

I hate to see professors
forced to
rely on the honor system less
than they might just because a
few people violate it and
thereby threaten its integrity
and the enjoyment of its many
benefits by the students.

On the other hand, I realize
the serious impact which a
conviction could have on
someone accused of a violation
of the code. If elected, I would
try my best to weigh any case
in all fairness.

Atso, helping to impress the
importance of the honor code
upon incoming freshmen
be one of the most important
aspects of the job. Each
imcoming class must continue
