Children of the Malt®, part VI

Thursday, February 22, 1990 THE DAVIDSONIAN

Religion department joins quest for best

By JOHN HUTCHINSON

Trent Foley, Assistant Professor of
Religion, joined Dave. Devereux and
Julie Gibert as guest drinkers for this
week’s blind tasting session of 11 differ-
ent English brews. All three have lived
and studied in England, an experience
which has provided them with a rea-
sonable knowledge of English beer. Ed
Matthews, photographer for The
Davidsonian, dropped by to take pic-
tures of the event, and was sucked into
the revelry, staying on taste several of
the beers himself.

Unfortunately, I was a goof. I lost the
letter grades awarded each beer by my

guest drinkers. But I’m sure they’re _ é

somewhere--probably underneath the
piles of clothes, papers, CDs, resumes,
beer bottles, dirty dishes, etc. in my
apartment. They’ll be in the final col-
umn this spring, I swear it.

Samuel Smith’s Pale Ale: Pleasant,
sweet odor. “Nicely sweet with a
slightly bitter aftertaste” --Foley. “It
doesn’t taste distinctly different from
anything else” --Devereux. “If you want
to waste $2 ona British beer that’s about-
as exciting as Pabst Blue Ribbon, this is
your beer” --Hutchinson

John Courage: Nice color, slightly
bready smell. An enjoyable bitter after-
taste. Notas heavy as you’d expect from
the color. “Tastes like watery ale” --
Foley. “It would be good with food, but
it’s not that interesting” --Gibert.

Newcastle Brown: Syrupy sweet,
vaguely fruity smell. Thin--not much
body. Perhaps good to sip at if you’ve
had a big dinner beforehand. “Stays
with you in a textural sort of way” --
Gibert. “Smells like old Christmas
lights, and it leaves you with a furry
tongue” --Foley.

Old Peculier: Rich, caramel smell.

Smooth but thick. “Tastes like some-
thing you marinate something in” --
Gibert. “It would be hard for me to
down a couple of pints of this. I’ve
drunk a lot of this type of beer and I
always try to like it, but I never really
do” --Foley.

Whitbread Ale: Bitter and sour taste-
-very acrid. “Nice shoepolishy smell” -
-Foley. “Sweet mustiness bounded by

despite feeling like champagne in your
mouth” --Hutchinson.

Samuel Smith’s Old Brewery Pale

Ale: Faint odor. Its pleasantly bitter
taste is not very clean. “No particular
noticeable quality to it. This one is not
where it’s at” -Devereux.

Samuel Smith’s Oatmeal Stout:
Sweet smell, smokey, dark taste. “A
good late night beer or heavy dessert

acrid jarring horror” --Devereux.

Samuel Smith’s Nut Brown Ale: Bit-
ter initial taste with a more bitter after-
taste. Syrupy smell. “Smells like vita-
min B complex” --Foley. “God. I think
I'll try and avoid this beer” --Devereux.

Royal Oak: Sweet smell, good, rich,
bitter taste. The aftertaste is less bitter
than the initial taste. “A nice consis-
tency with a bitter taste” --Foley. “You
could go into a pub after classes, drink
this for 4 or 5 hours, and never want
dinner” --Devereux.

Bass: Bubbly for an English beer. Bit-
ter while you drink it, but the bitterness
quickly disappears. “A pretty fair beer

beer to settle the stomach. I could drink
it just before I go to bed” --Devereux.
“Smells like Listerine” --Foley.

Samuel Smith’s Taddy Porter: Very
smooth, comparatively full body.
Completely opaque. “Rich, mocha
smell” --Gibert. “Delightfully mild, yet
rich” --Foley. “You could pour thisover
pancakes, it’s so thick. Might even make
breakfast fun” --Hutchinson.

Best beer: Taddy Porter, Royal Oak,
Worst beer: Whitbread Ale

Best name: John Courage, Old Peculiar
Most interesting bottle: Royal Oak

The beers discussed in this week’s
column can be purchased at La’Mart
Deli and Wines on Sharon Amity and
Belk’s of Southpark in Charlotte. Royal
Oak, and John Courage, Bass and sev-
eral of the Samuel Smith beers can be
purchased locally at Natural Resources:

On the international beer scene, the
democratic reforms in Czechoslovakia
have yielded a most unique develop-
ment. The traditional brewing town of
Pilsenis home toanewly-formed politi-
cal party, “Friends of Beer,” according
to the Valentine’s Day issue of The Char-
lotte Observer. The party’s platform is
rather simple: condoning only lower
beer prices, better beer quality and
more beer consumption. Party mem-
bers hope to win seats in the June 8
elections. Calls to The Charlotte Observer,
Senator Terry Sanford’s office and
Washington’s Czechoslovakian Em-
bassy failed to turn up the mailing
address of the “Friends of Beer,” so it
will be several weeks before supportive
Americans can send their campaign
contributions.

None of this is particularly surpris-
ing, however: the Czechs are currently
in the middle of the most creative and
unique of the Eastern European revolu-
tions--consider also that they have se-
lected eccentric rocker Frank Zappa as
the Czech cultural emissary to the
world. Honestly.

Next week, assuming Charles Houck
and Isurvivethe partying fury of Mardi
Gras, Children of the Malt® will cover sev-
eral beers left out in earlier tasting ses-
sions.

This column is written out of the concern
that, in a quest for quantities of beer, stu-
dents too often overlook the quality.
