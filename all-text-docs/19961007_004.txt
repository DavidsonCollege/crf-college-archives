Nicaraguan labor organizer
speaks about rights abuses

By IAN HUMMEL
Staff Writer

On Wednesday, October 2,
Davidson served as host to Nicara-
guan speaker Roberto J., a pseud-
onym for a man who is an under-
ground labor organizer. He came to
Davidson as a part of a tour funded
by Witness For Peace, an organiza-
tion committed to an end to U.S.
policies “which contribute to pov-
erty and oppression” in Latin
America and the Caribbean.

The subject of Roberto’s talk
was the atrocities of Nicaraguan
labor practices, the tragic condi-
tions of which he says few Ameri-
cans know.

According to Roberto J., Nica-
ragua is in a state of economic ruin.
Its unemployment and underem-
ployment levels are reportedly as
high as 60%. For those who do hold
jobs, salaries are low; the average
salary of agricultural workers. is

$1.50 per day. In response to
economic decay that has plagued
the country, President Violeta
Chamorro was forced upon elec-
tion in 1990 to make drastic con-
cessions to lure investors to build
factories in Nicaragua. These con-
cessions came in the area of work-
ers’ rights.

Roberto J., a 31 year-old fa-
ther of two, has been working in
Nicaraguan factories known as
“maquilas” since the age of 15. In
the years he has worked, he says
he has seen various worker abuses
ranging from the overworking of
employees to the employment of
minors to physical abuse. He
spoke last Wednesday of incidents
of miscarriage induced by long
hours of work imposed upon preg-
nant women. He told also of cases
of respiratory tract illness caused
by the lint-filled air in which em-
ployees work

These things occur beneath

the noses of a callous manage-
ment, he said, who provide health
services to workers consisting of
two doctors for 11,000 employees.

Roberto J. said that workers
are forbidden to make any dispar-
aging or derogatory comments
about their employers, and com-
plaints serve as grounds for termi-
nation.

Beyond loss of employment,
Roberto J. said that, many workers
fear for their lives, and regard their
employers as “mobsters” who have
been suspected of assassinating la-
bor organizers.

Despite this risk, Roberto J.
leads 12 clandestine commissions
who work secretly for labor re-
form within Nicaragua. Taking
leave of work on a doctor’s excuse
that was paid for by a bribe by
Witness For Peace, he has come to
the U.S. under the name Roberto J.
in an attempt to spread awareness
of the Nicaraguan workers’ plight.

Union Board objects to programming

Blake contends that the
physical questions only quizzed
respondents on such neutral is-
sues as whether or not they “paint
their toenails.” And even if sur-

he says, “Davidson students are
intelligent. They would know the

for presentation at last week’s

Like other Board members,
Dowling applauds Blake’ efforts,

were perhaps misplaced. “John is

Blake finds the premise of
“Singled Out”, ashow which doesn’t
leave its contestants the chance to
improvise responses, to be far less
offensive than another DCTV show
which shows viewers how to make
cocktails. “I object more to the bar
