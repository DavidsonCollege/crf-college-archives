We're looking for a reverse of the old dog-trees-cat, |
firemen-to-the-rescue story tomorrow night when the ‘Cats

take the field after State’s Wolfpack. Nobody (Davidson man

that_is) could see any other prediction under the,.,circum-
stances. Lady Luck, in the guise of a big bruising Duke Blue
Devil eleven, has favored us with a big grin, and you can
be sure that Storey’s boys are out to make the best out of a
good situation.
State is in a sad-sack shape after their bad
break in Durham last week. Several of the Wolf-
pack’s best backs are on the sick list, including

stellar tailback Charlie Richkus, so that the Wolves
are limping on the fourth leg and may have to resort
almost entirely to third and feurth string ball-
carriers. To top off the injured column, the whole
squad is somewhat the worse for wear after the
mauling they gave and took from Duke.

On the other hand, the ’Cats, fresh from their skirmish
with vaunted William and Mary, are raring te eo, With the}
return of Sandy Carnegie, Carl Pahl, and Dave Poole to the
line-up we have two full teams to field that are nearly even |
in size and ability. The lack of reserves that caused ts to
bow out to State in the final quarter of tast-vear’s wat
should-be-hurting State instead of Davidson this time. ff t]

playing field. The boys who stopped Jack Cloud cold

many times last year will be augmented by quite a
few passes this time. With six good chunkers tossing
them and Buddy Cheek, Mike Williams, and Jim
Sifford to pull them in, we ought to see lots of
yardage by the aerial route. And you can be sure }
that Buddy will be between the man in the striped
shirt and the sideline this time. We wuz robbed.

Hardest working men in the Red and—Black
football engine are Al Moneyhan’s JayVee “dawegs.”
If you don’t believe it, just ask one of them. Made up
of some of last year’s only once-defeated squad, some
“Phi Bets” who can’t memorize plays, and lots of
new men, the “dawgs” face a tougher schedule this
year, and Moneyhan is sparing no pains to get them
ready for their first-game Thursday.

Once or twice a week, they take off to give the Varsity
a little workout, but the rest of it is work. No doubt about it, |
the little squad has a long way to go before game time, Out
