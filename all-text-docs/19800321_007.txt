Glenn Kellum
is a great guy!

We really like Glenn here at the

Davidsonian. He’s an intelligent,

sonable, an hard working guy who likes
to wear shirts. He’s also our assistant

news editor.

But people like Glenn can’t do it alone.

We need more people like him on the

Davidsonian staff.

drafted three months before he
was to enter Davidson. This
coming Monday, March 24, he
will give a talk and slide show
on Cyprus and the Turkish
invasion in the Morrison Room
at 7:00 p.m.

As a prelude to his talk,
Nicolaides gave his views on a
number of questions of special
concern to Americans: the
draft, both in Cyprus and here;
American foriegn policy; and
Davidson College.

Concerning the draft: ‘‘I

such a war and the U.S. did
little lasting punishment to
Turkey.”

In actuality, the U.S. did
embargo arms shipments to the
Turks after their invasion of
Cyprus. In retaliation, accord-
ing to Nicolaides, the Turks
“blackmailed” the U.S. by, clos-
ing airbases used to watch the
Russians.

“The majority of the Greek
Cypriots believe that the only
country that can give a solution
to the Cyprus problem is the
4J.S: But since 1974 when the
Turkish invasion took place, the
Americans have not done any-
thing. When I asked him
(Hodding Carter) several ques-
tions, he agreed that the Greek-
Cypriots are right but a solution
is not so easy because of the
complexity of the problem.”

the Soviet invasion in Afghan-

industries if at all.” ’ Ee

Nicolaides is a Greek- Cyp-
riot, a member of the 80 percent
majority of Greeks there. From
age nine he attended the presti-
gious Athens College, in Ath-
ens, Greece. He decided to
attend college in the U.S.
‘because of the advantages of
the American educational sys-
tem."’ He chose Davidson be-
cause as a senior his counselor
was a North Carolinean. He was
accepted here two years ago but
was forced to delay entry due to
his twenty-six month military
service. During this period he
kept in touch with Davidson
through correspondence with
Assistant Admissions Director,
Tony Boon.

He has been impressed by
Davidson, especially by the
people and the Honor System.
“The people here are so friendly

For those who demand abso-
lute clarity of expression in
their art, Herb Jackson’s cur-
rent exhibit in the Gallery will
constitute a formidable chal-
lenge. Many observers have
found the abstract, megalithic
quality of the works enigmatic;
a number have inVoked psycho-
analysis; and occasionally
someone bemoans the absence
of ‘‘those pretty clouds.”

Jackson sees the exhibit as an
attempt to create a ‘‘medita-
tional environment,’’—one
which will evoke a “spiritual
response.’’ He would admonish
those for whom abstract art is
‘ta puzzle where you go search-
ing for various items,” using
the ‘‘Veronica’s Veil” series as
an example.

“Veronica was a saint whose
veil supposedly preserved the
image of Christ’s face,’’ ex-
plained Jackson. ‘‘But if you
were to go looking for Christ’s
face in the paintings, you would
be accepting a very simplistic
way of viewing the series.”
