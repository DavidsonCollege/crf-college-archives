Annual Initiation Held
For Delta Phi-Alpha

Five New Members Are Taken Into
Honorary German Fraternity

On Thursday evening, April 14, Delta Phi
Alpha, honorary German: fraternity, was the
guest of Dr. and Mrs. G. R. Vowles at their
home for an exceedingly enjoyable ‘“Musik-
alischer Abend.” The program consisted of well
known German songs and ballads which were
sung in German by members of the society, be-
ing accompanied at the piano by Mrs, Vowles.
This was followed by phonograph records of
selections from German operas which were sung
by famous artists.

At the meeting which followed the musical
program, the following new members were ini-
tiated: W. B. Corbin, F. H. Scott, W. M.
Thompson, W. T. Thompson, and J. W. White.
Following their initiation the neophytes pre-
sented a dramatization of the Elizabethan Pe-
riod, of a short story, “Der fahrende Schuler
in Paradies,” by Hans. Sachs, the famous Ger-
man poet and author. The sketch was presented
in German and the actors were Corbin, Scott,
and W. M. Thompson. White was the official
prompter and W. T. Thompson :gave a short
summary of the life and works of Sachs. The
entire sketch was well done and was greatly
enjoyed by everyone present.

Mrs. Vowles was elected an honorary mem-
ber of the society and the following officers
were elected for the coming year: President,
P. F. Brown; vice-president, C. M. Wildman;
secretary-treasurer, F. H. Scott.

Led by Captain Jack Wagner, Davidson Col-
lege golfers left yesterday morning for Greens-
boro to participate in three dual matches before
defending their state title crown in the North
Carolina intercollegiate tournament on Satur-
day. All of the golf matches will be played’ over
the Sedgefield course.

Starting Wednesday and on successive days,
the Davidson foursome meets the University of”
North Carolina, Duke University, and N. C,
State in separate matches, and will then vie
with representatives of these institutions in the
state tournament.

Captain Wagner is ranking No. 1 player for
Davidson, and in the seven matches played so

the Wildcats. His colleagues will be Tom Cald-
well, Mac Manson, and John D., McConnell,

tournament. They have lost matches to Wash-
ington and Lee, Emory, University of Georgia,
and Georgia Tech, and have won twice from
Furman, and also from the University of Rich-
mond.
