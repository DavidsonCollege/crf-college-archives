Noted Virtuoso To
Give Organ Recital

Davidson Artist Series Pre-
sents E. P. Biggs in Musical
Program

E. Powers Biggs, noted in the
concert»field, on numerous record-
ings, in various radio performances,
and as soloist with the leading sym-
phony orchestras of the land, will
be presented in an organ recital in
Chambers Auditorium February 24,
at 8:15 p. m. This will be the
fourth in the Davidson College
Artist series, which has sought to
bring to the campus this year a well
rounded-group- of concert-artists.

Mr. Biggs’ concert experience has
been hailed for its virtuosity.

Among other firsts, he can claim |

performances of modern organ con-
certos by Sowerby, Piston, Harris,
Poulenc. He has also helped a great
deal with the rejuvenation on the
American concert stage of the works
of Handel, Felton, and others.

He has also made recordings of
several works for Victor Records.
Two of these compositions will be
played by Mr. Biggs in the David-
son recital. : .

As a soloist, Mr. Biggs has been
featured with the Boston Symphony
Orchestra, the Chicago Symphony
Orchestra, and the Cincinnati Sym-
phony Orchestra. He has appeared
as soloist at Queen’s Hall in Lon-
don, the Berkshire Symphonic Fes-
tival, the Library of Congress in
Washington, and the Bethlehem
Bach Festival.

Mr. Biggs lacks the distinction of
being “banned in Boston,” for the
Boston Herald stated, “The effect
of such playing is electrifying.”

Madness Praised
In Dr. Davis’ Talk

“In Praise of Madness” was the
title of the address made to the
Davidson student body last Sunday,
Feb. 9th, by Dr. C. Grier Davis,
Pastor of the First Presbyterian
Church of Asheville, N. C. In this
sermon, Dr. Davis, an alumnus of
Davidson College, pointed out the
meaning of the word “Madness” as
it has been applied to men in the
past. It has been attributed to the
men who depart from evil — the
sober, clean men contrasted with
the “‘normal” men who drink and
carouse; the modest, careful girls
as opposed to the more popular
“fast and loose” ones; the courag-
eous missionaries who have gone to
teach the “Fuzzy-Wuzzies” in the
South Pacific as in contrast with
the heroic aviators who have daring-
ly. shot down the enemy from the
skies. Even so the Apostle Paul
was accounted “beside himself.”
Paul explained his “madness” by
saying, “If I behave as Ido, it is
because I am constrained by the
love of Christ.”

Dr. Davis said that the Christian

_ youth of today, the young women
who go as missionaries to the Dark
Continent, the German Christians
who went into contentration camps
for testifying their beliefs, were
constrained by the love of Christ,
The true Christian says, “Christ
died for me, so I should live for
Him.”

“There is no life so full, so joy-
ous, so full of meaning as the
Christian life. What are you going
to do with your life?” As a river,
originating in a wide country,
where it flows in an irregular pat-
tern, is constrained to flow deep,
strong, and clear, with definite
direction as it goes, between two
cliffs, so the Christian life is con-
strained to be clear, deep, and
strong, and with direction, by the
love of Christ.

“If these men and, women who
go to foreign lands to spread the
word of Christ are mad,” Dr. Davis
said, “Then what the world needs
is more mad men.” He went on to
say “What stands between us and
the catastrophe which threatens
us?..The-character-of-man.—What
can change the character of man?
The love of Christ.” He-concluded
his sermon with a call for young
men to allow themselves to be led
by the love of Christ, and to come
out to bring the Gospel to the world.

MenPromoted
In ROTC Shift

Three outstanding members of
first year advanced R.O.T.C. were
commissioned Cadet second lieuten-
ants in the second semester re-
organization of the cadet batallion
at a parade ceremony last Tuesday.

Receiving the silver discs of cadet
shavetails and congratulations
from-the-military_staff were T. M.
Faw, Spencer B. Murry, and J. E.
Gray. Earning them their new
ranks were their “outstanding exhi-
bition of leadership ability and pro-
fessional knowledge.

Faw, who now leads ‘cadet pla-
toon, was promoted from first
semester duty as a platoon sergeant
in Company A. . Possessing plenty
of experience he was a veteran of
three years service in the infantry
and was a sergeant in the 75th
Division. Faw is a sophmore and a
member of Kappa Sigma. He first
entered Davidson in '42 from’ his
home town of North Wilkesboro,
N. C. GBS

Murry, now second officer of the
band, was formerly first sergeant
of that unit. A member of ,the
class of ’48, he entered basic R.O.-
T.C. in September '44. An ardent
Davidson bandsman, Murry is a
member of the Kappa Delta Club
and is out for track. He hails from
far off State College, Mississippi.

Gray is now leader of the third
platoon of Company C. after having
been a platoon guide.. During the
war he served as a corporal in the
U. S. Marine Corps on board the
battleship U. S. Maryland. For
his services he wears the Philippine
liberation ribbon and the Presiden-
tial. unit» Citation. His home is
Barber, N. C.

In the unit reorganization batal-
lion commander Carl S. Pahl re-
ceived:his cadet lieutenant colonel-
acy and batallion executive, Quinten
Cooper was promoted one rank to
cadet Major.

Others promoted with their new
assignments are A. D. Plowden
promoted to Cadet Captain to be
commanding officer of Company C.
from the rank of first lieutenant
as batallion adjutant.

W. L. Withers was promoted to
first lieutenant and assigned as
batallion adjutant from duties as
second lieutenant batallion supply
officer.

Platoon leaders promoted to first
lieutenant are E. H. Johnson of B
company, J. H. Bell and C. S. Aber-
nathy of C. Company and R. E.
Long and S. T. West of A Company.

With the promotions in rank
came shifts in the size of squads
and addition of extra platoons to
the units. Shortened squads en-
abled the R.O.T.C. staff to add a
platoon ,to each cadet eompany.
According to Col. W. P. Grace,
P.M.S. & T. this enabled ‘all ad-
vanced students to obtain exper-
ience in charge of a squad or larger
unit.

OPERETTA
A preformance of Gilbert and
Sullivan operetta, Pirates of Pen-
zance, will be given in Chambers
auditorium on March 8. This
operetta will be given under the
direction of Mr. Earl F. Berg and

nate musicgprogram of Queens

and Davidson Colleges.

chapter of the American Associa-
tion of University ,\Women at 3
o’clock last Tuesday afternoon at
Mint Museum of Art. Mrs. M. W.

Peterson, president, presided.

“American Labor as a Political
Bloc,” was the subject of the ad-
dress by Dr. Brown, a native of
Salisbury, who has achieved much
distinction in the field of public
education. A graduate of David-
college, class of 1921,
highest honors, he subsequently
received M. A. and Ph. D. degrees
from University of North Carolina.
He pursued additional studies at
University of Besancon, in France;
‘Colgate university, and University
of Chicago. He has served as
assistant professor of mathematics,
and associate professor of eco-
nomics at Davidson college, which
he now serves as professor of eco-
nomics as well as dean of the facul-
ty. Dr.. Brown also is the author
of several books.

At the conclusion of this meeting
of the chapter a tea course was
served under leadership of Mrs.
James Covington.

Joseph Hutchison, director of
Mint Museum of Art, delivered a
lecture to his art class at 3 o'clock
Tuesday afternoon at the museum.
This was a part of a series of
monthly lectures which are being
attended by many members of the
Charlotte Chapter.of A.A.U.W.

Men Attack,
Rob Student

William Currie, member of the
Class of 50, was instrumental in
the arrest and conviction of three
hold-up experts who had attacked,
beaten, and robbed him in an out-
lying district of Davidson, last
Friday morning at 2:00 a. m.

Currie, who had missed the last
bus returning from Charlotte, was
offered a ride by the men, who
brought ‘him to the Davidson city
limits, where they stopped near the
ice plant, under the pretense of get-
ting a piece of ice. One of the
thugs slipped on some grease, and
when Currie attempted to help him
up he was. struck from the rear
with a beer bottle. The blow stun-

“Then it’s Dean, Dean—
the sweetest notes we’ve heard,
Leader Dean.” Apologies to Rud-
yard Kipling, who himself, no doubt
would concur with the Davidson
student’s opinion that the mellow-
est music made for many moons in
metropolitan. Mecklenburg was
fashioned for the mid-winter dances
by the Hudson Horns. In happy
contrast to -the several orchestras
which have gained notoriety by
mutilating dance week-ends at
North Carolina schools by insisting
on none but the heated beat, the
Hudson outfit emphasized the soft
notes conductive to floatin’ and

Students Praise Hudson
For Best Dance In Years

Hudson, a recent college graduate
(University of Florida) specializes
in_pleasing the collegiate set, and
he was never more successful in
this endeavor than last week-end.
Most complimented feature of Hud-
son’s performance was the excellent
spacing and timing of the sweet,
fast, and novelty tunes; of the lat-

ter, the most popular being
“Ouvrer La Porte, Reeshard” from
“Knockturne.”

The attractive Floridian is noted
for his easy going, good nature—
yet, some how he accomplishes more
than the hardest taskmaster when
it comes to bossing a band and mak-
ing it a success ‘as an entertaining
unit as well as a top flight musical

sic society, celebrated its 25th an-
niversary last December 11. The
society was organized on that day

Some of Americas foremost phy-
sicists, are members of Sigma Pi
Sigma, among them being the
Compton brothers; Foote, director
of Research of Gulf Oil Company;
Dr. W. E. Forsythe, of General
Electric; and others.

During the month of December,
1946, a service was held at Davidson
commemorating the Societie’s 25th
anniversary, at which time a bronze
plaque was presented to the col-
lege. The plaque was made possible
through the contributions of the
alumni of the Alpha chapter of
Davidson. The plaque is now on
the wall near the entrance to the
north wing of Chambers.

The Alpha chapter here is now
active again under the direction of
Caspar Woodbridge, President;

Library Gets
Recent Books

The campus library has recently
received a number of new (and
good) books for the general en-

joyment of the members of the
student body. They range in in-
terest from exciting novels and

action stories to informative com-
pilations and biographies. Those
few listed below represent but a
cross-section of the many others
new available, all of them just as
good as these.

“Ripley's Incredible Believe It Or
Not,” by the man who has become
world famous through his ability
to astound his reading audiences.
Robert L. Ripley has been called a
liar many times but he always, has
proof of his statements, which have
‘been gathered from research in all
parts of the world. _ This book,
whose pages are crammed with a
host of facts about the universe, is
a must for the inquisitive mind and
is sure to astound even the most
conservative reader.

“One Damned Island After An-
other,” by Cline Howard and Joe
Whitley. The exciting story of the
7th Air Force told from the point
of view of the men of the outfit,
themselves, and often in their own
language. The narrative begins of
Dec. 7, 1941, and traces the 7th
Air Force from its scanty origin,
through the period of flying and
fighting “against so much with so
little,” to brighter days when vic-
tory against Japan was imminent:

of Leaksville, N. C., is a_ pretty
sharpe article and even had the

what the Davidsonian was when I

I was from ye old campus rag.

“T really am the night mayor, ya

Program Not New

The present Midnight Dancing
Party is not an entirely new show
according to Buster Richardson,
the heavyweight station engineer.
A program carrying that handle
had been beamed from W.B.T. for
years, but the present series started
September 2, 1946, after a three
year lay off during which time
Webster was serving with the army.

As to “Heartaches,” the secord
first cut by Ted Weems and his
orchestra seventeen years ago, Kurt
said, “Bill Mull brought it over
one night last September, and now
its sky rocketing in national sales,”
Thus one announcer in a Charlotte
radio station has plugged this oldie
with its catehie rhythms into one
of the biggest nation-wide scrambles
in history. If you don’t believe it,
try to get the record and see the
mob with the same idea. i

Alpha Sigma Sigma.

About.a month ago, Webster was
voted an honorary member of the
outstanding Davidson honor frat,
Alpha Sigma Sigma, and I was
naturally interested to get his opin-
ion on the famed organization. A
college man himself, Webster knew
of the organization and said that
he had-been a member of the chap-
ter at” George Washington Uni-
versity while in school there. On
learning: that George Ennett. was
the local president, however, he
handed in his resignation.

An interesting feature of the
Dancing Party is the fact that the
Night Mayor never has a chance
to hear the records himself because
he_is-constantly on the phdne. In
case you are in doubt as to the au-
thenticity of those phone calls, I
invite your attention to the station
switchboard and its overworked
operator. Since September, the
program has received calls from
every state in the union, many
points in Canada, and Cantegent,
Colombia, South America.

Besides plugging “Heartaches,”
Webster gives advice to motorists
in support of W.B.T.’s safety cam-
paign. His warning to the speed-
sters usually follows the line of
“keep both hands on the wheel no
matter how close she cuddles up.”
Have his appeals paid off? You
bet. The National Safety Council
has recently published a pamphlet
in which they tell the story of a
motorist in Pennsylvania whose life
was saved by his tuning in on the

Dancing Party.

Dr. A. Gregg Talks
On Mission Work

Dr. Alice H. Gregg, representing
the Student Volunteer Movement,
spoke to the student body last Fri-
day morning concerning the mission
fields as a vocation.

As traveling secretary for the
Student Volunteer Movement in
North and South Carolina, Dr.
Gregg came to Davidson to enlist
interest among the students in the
mission fields, both home and for-
eign, After the chapel program she
met with any. students desiring
more information about the move-
ment or the particular areas of mis-
sion work,

Expert on China

Dr. Gregg is an expert in the
field religious education in
China, being author of the highly
acclaimed study “China and Educa-
tional Autonomy.” She has served
in China since 1916 in many differ-
ent capacities with religious organi-
zations and as a faculty member of
St. John’s University in Shanghai.
Having received her training at
Winthrop College and Deaconess
House in Philadelphia, took

reorganize Syracuse-in-China. Dr.
Gregg will soon return to take up
her work with the Episcopal Church
in- West China.

The Student Volunteer Movement
started about sixty years ago with
its purpose being to enlist inter-
est throughout the country in home
and foreign mission work among
students. The movement had an
illustrous history untj! the time of
the depression when money was
scarce and the mission boards sent
out no new missionaries. It is now
getting back into full swing with
a traveling secretary in each area
in the country whose job is to cre-
ate interest in its work.

The Reverend Murphey Williams,
Y. M. C. A. Secretary, who-intro-
duced the speaker, has material on
the Student Volunteer Movement
for anyone interested. He stated
that he also would be glad to talk
with anyone about the movement
and its work.
