DEVEREUX ARTISTS SEEN
IN ROMEO AND JULIET

Shakespearean | Players Are Pre-
sented by Local Dramatic
Club to Small Audience

On last $ Saturday. night in Shearer
Hall, Clifford Devereux and his com-
pany presented Romeo and Juliet, It
was not plaved before a full house, in
fact it was one of the smallest crowds
that has heen out to see a play in sev-
eral years. It is generally supposed
that in the centers of higher learning
plays of the deeper sort.draw a large
crowd, ut of a student body of 500
and the faculty and the peoplé of the
town, there were scarcely 300 present.
The indications are that the American
people of culture are losing their taste
for Shakespeare as well as some of the
other greatest writers of our language.
Those who did not attend the play,
missed one of the finest exhibitions of
first class acting that has ever been
staged at Davidson.

Mr. Devereux is an actor of excep-
tional ability. He has that faculty of
making the audience feel the every
emotion of the character he is bea -
ing, which is an inherent quality
every good actor. As Romeo he a
picted the agonies of a star-crossed
lover in a most vivid manner. Mr.
Devereux has an exceptionally fine
voice.

Miss Zinata Graf, Mr. Devereux’s
leading lady, is a woman of more than
ordinary beauty and personality, the
possessor of a most musical voice. As
Juliet she was beautiful and winsome.
She brought out all the pathos of the
part in an unusually beautiful and
realistic fashion. It was not hard to
believe they were star-crossed lovers
of two houses between which’ existed
animosity of long standing.

CHARLOTTE CAMPAIGN OPENS~

INTINTEREST OF CHAMBERS|

Queen City Will Score Touch-
down -

Charlotte has witnessed many a
Wildcat struggle. Eagerly has she
followed with eyes of interest the fleet
form of a dashing feline, and how
often has she cheered for a winning
score! She glories in the spirit that
puts over a winning touchdown.

On a miniature battleground erected
at Ligegtt’s Drug store, in the heart of
the Queen City, an eager Wildcat has
started a downfeld march toward a
$100,000 quota goal. In the hands of
Davidson alumni and supporters in the
Queen City rests the fate of the cleated
wearer of the Red Black. Pledges and
subscriptions amounting to $10,000
are necessary for each 10-yard ad-
vance. The Charlotte fans are sup-
porting the Wildcat and at the time
this article is being written there is
every indication that the ball will be
carried safely across the last white line
that means victory.

Mr. Malcolm Lockhart, director of
the campaign for the raising of funds
to rebuild Chambers, has chosen an
able corps of pep leaders and workers
to carry the Charlotte campaign over
in fine style. The churches of the city
will-be asked to furnish one-half of the
$100,000 ‘quota and the business in-
terests will be solicited for the remain-
ing half,. Noyember 18th is the date
set for the final reckoning and an ef-
fort will be made to/secure mee amount
-in full by that date. stress

SERVICE

Mail service deluxe, ala Uncle
Baxter, is the latest addendun to
the list of public service corpora-
tions on the hill, Uncle Baxter,
under a special act of Congress,
has installed in the heart of the
campus a mail box for the use of
the students, the mail being col-
lected before the departure of
every mail train.

Until Gamaliel Harding dis-
covers the fact that Baxter is a
loyal democrat, and replaces him

with a follower of the Bull
Moose, the denizens of Dormi-
tory Row will be relieved of

many weary walks to Mr, Cran-

ford’s shop.

FRESHMAN TEAM IS wcTOR
OVER OAK RIDGE INSTITUTE

Black Scores Two Touchdowns
for Local Boys

Last Saturday on Sprunt Iield the
Davidson Freshmen triumphed over
the Oak Ridge Institute by the score
of 13-0. Both teams played a good
game, and the score does not show the
real fight the Freshmen put up before
they subdued their lighter opponents.

Oak Ridge opened up the first quar-
ter with a steady drive toward the }a-
vidson goal line. A pass to Sherrill
made 20 yards, and although Oak
Ridge lost the ball on a fumble, they
soon recovered and advanced the ball
to Davidson’s seven-yard line, A
touchdown seemed certain, but on the
first play Anderson broke through and
tackled Cole so hard that he dropped
the ball. MacDonald picked up the
ball and ran 85 yards, being forced
out of bounds on the eight-yard line.
Two drives by Black carried the ball
over for Davidson’s first touchdown.
MacDonald kicked goal.

The opening of the next quarter saw

STANDARD CLASS RING SOUGHT
BY JUNIORS AND SOPHOMORES

Joint Class Committees Meet to
Discuss Plan

During the past week the joint com-
mittee of the Junior and Sophomore
classes, appointed for the purpose of
selecting a standard class ring, met
with the salesman of the Herff-Jones
Company, of Indianapolis, and selected
two designs for the proposed ring. One
of these designs is similar to the
D-shaped ring adopted last year by the
class of ’22, except that it has two
wildcats placed in relief on each side
of the “D.” ‘The other design is a new
one which has an oval-shaped top with
the Davidson College seal in the center
encircled by the name, “Davidson Col-
lege.” This ring also has the wildcats
on it.

It is hoped that, when the salesman
returns with the sample casts of the
two rings, the two classes will select
one of the designs to be the standard
class ring. If this purpose is accom-
plished, then each class that graduates
from Davidson will have a ring of the
same design with the exception of the
class numerals, which will of course,
be changed for each class.

The Juniors on the committee are J.
D. Parish, G. R. Dupuy, W. M. Hes-
ton, W. Z. Bradford and Paul Price,
and the Sophomores are R. E. Boggs,
H. B. Price, T. F. Staley and A. F.
Martin.

SEVERAL REVIVAL MEETINGS. |
ARE LED. BY DOCTOR LINGLE

Brother of Local Professor
Speaks Under Auspices of |

Y. M.C. A. on Religious
Topics

The regular fall evangelistic services
were held under the auspices of the Y,

MC) during Wednesday Phursday,
Friday, Saturday and Sunday of last
week, led by Dr. Walter L.. Lingle, of
the Union © Theological Seminary
faculty. Besides speakiag on \Wednes-
day, ‘Phursday, Triday and Sunday
niehts and at the chapel service on
Thursday, Vriday and — Saturday,

Doctor Lingle held a large number of
personal interviews, addressed several
groups and preached in the Davidson
Presbyterian Chureh both Sunday
Morning and Sunday evening,

Doctor Lingle used no sentimental
preaching, but simply toll the plain
message of Jesus Christ. Tiss mellow
voice, blended with his deep person-
ality, together with the reality and
directness of his messages, produced a
lasting effect on his audience, — Tle
secured results which can be secured
only by those who have long walked
close to God. Only the future can tell
just how much good has been done by
his efforts spent here. Many feel
themselves to be closer to Christ and
have a more definite ou~pose in life.

The singing contributed its part
toward the success of the meetings.
Mr, ‘I. C. Carr, 98, of Mooresville,
directed the singing until Saturday,
when he went to the First Presbyterian
Chureh, of Mooresville, to conduct the
singing’ at the District C, I. Conven-|>
tion which was then in session, Buck
Currie led the singine on Sunday.
Mr. Carr has had a wide experience
as soig leader. He is at present em-
ployed by the Synod of North Caro-
lina.

The attendance was unusually large,
about 90 per cent of the student body
attending the services: ‘The Senior
class acted as the invitation cammittee
on the first night, the Juniors the
second, then the Sophomores, and the
Freshmen on the two following nights.

Most of Doctor Lingle’s spare time
was occupied by holding a large num-
ber of 20-minute personal interviews.
These discussions related primarily to
the problem of choosing the correct
vocation in life. Not a®single student
among the many-who conferred with
him entertained the slightest doubt that
the life in which the greatest amount
of true service is rendered is the ideal
life to live.

The fraternity groups were ad-
dressed separately on Christian sub-
jects, dealing particularly with their],
work. Doctor Lingle’s principal talks
are briefly given below:

CHAPEL SERVICES

On Thursday morning he spoke of
the importance of attaining a strong
Christian personality. The greatest
personality of all, that of Christ, can
be approached only by constantly striv-
ing to develop the all-around man
physically, intellectually, socially and
spiritually.

The text Friday morning was, ‘Thy
kingdom come, thy will be done on
earth as it is in Heaven.” God’s will is
being done by Davidson students only
when they practice self-denial, the law
of love, the golden rule, and the law of
service. There is no place for selfish-
ness in a Christian’s life, but there is
a large place for service.

On Saturday morning Christ’s
teachings concerning the use of money
were discussed. Wealth is a peril to
one’s soul when it is not used for God’s

LITERARY SOCIETY SPONSORS

become like Jesus

It has recently been decided that the
literary societies will be represented in
this year’s issue of the Quips and
Cranks by sponsors, chosen respec-
tively by the four presidents of. the
societies. ‘This procedure on the part
of the societies, however novel and
unexpected, need not be laid altogether
to their charge, for it has been stated
on good authority that they were to
quite an extent hoodwinked into. the
agreement by certain members of the
annual staff. In fact one of the great
four begged rather apologetically that
it be made unmistakably clear to the
public, that it was the annual staff who
originated the idea, and that the
societies were more or less the victims
of circumstanecs. In deference to the
gentleman’s wish this phase of the
matter has been made plain, but there
was in’ reality no necessity for this
apparent modesty on the part of those
who had every reason to be delighted
to proclaim to the public that their
societies were of sufficient importance
to merit this additional recognition in
the Davidson College Annual,

‘the sponsors for the literary
societies are announced as follows:

Eumanean—Miss Carolina Knowl-
ton.

Metrophilian — Miss
Morrison.

Pandeinic—Miss Elizaebth Thames.

Long —that is, if Bobby needs any in-

Bobby is that some voung lad who,
some 12 months ago, cavorted on
Sprint and other fields, sporting the
Red and Mack? Saturday, however;
he wore the Red and White of N.C.
State and he, with the help of kindly
breaks, spiked the Wildeats’ artillery.
Result--State, 15; Davidson, 0,

But cold figures do not tell the story
of the courageous battle staged by the
Wildeats—a battle against overwhel-
ming odds. After seeing two sure
touchdowns for them turned into
markers for State by the mere flicker
of Lady Taick'’s hand, they turned
loose a whirlwind attack in the last
quarter that threatened to reverse the
score,

For the first time this season Spratt
Moore displayed his real ability in ad-
vaneing the pigskin. Tate in the game
Spratt cut loose in earnest and
smashed and circled his way down the
field. THe wiggled and squirmed, side-
stepped and pivoted his way in his old
inimitable style. Now that the Wild-
cat captain has struck his real stride,
great things are expected of him in the
Carolina game.

DEBATE WITH WASHINGTON
AND-LEE OPENS CALENDAR

Many Candidates Report for
Service

On‘the evening of December 15, at
Lexington, Va., Davidson will debate
Washington and Tee University for
the first time since 1919. The question
is, Resolved, That the United States
government should cancel the debts to
her Huropean allies made after April
6, 1917,. Davidson will uphold the
affirmative side of the debate.

At a meeting, held after chapel last
Monday, it was decided to hold the
society preliminaries on November
24th; the semi-finals, at which the ,
team will be picked, to take place om
the night of November 27th. ‘There
were more than 20 men present-at this
meeting and the prospects for turning
out a winning team from such a large
vroup are exceedingly bright. Profes-
sor Wagner spoke a few words to the
gathering and offered to help any one
in any possible way.

This is the first time since 1919 that
the debating teams of the two schools
have had a chance to meet. The debate,
taking place in the spring of that year,
resulted in a favorable decision for the
Red and Black. With Gamble, Ogden
and other debaters of experience, mak-
ing ready for the fray, it is exceedingly
probable that the chosén Wildcat pair
will again bring back the laurels to Da-
vidson,

The debating council was unable to
secure the triangular debate with Wake
Forest and Trinity this year but has
tentative plans for debating each of
them. The council hopes that this will
lead to a triangular debate with these
two colleges next year.» The proposed
debates with Wake Forest and Trinity
will take place some time during the

spring term.
