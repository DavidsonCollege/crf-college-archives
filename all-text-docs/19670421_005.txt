Pika and KA softballers stand around Pika first baseman Tom Cook, who has just been accidentally struck by a softball
thown by KA shortstop John Frick. Cook was running from first when Frick scooped up a grounder, forced him out at second
and drew back to throw to first. Instead he struck Cook whose jaw was cracked. (See story betow).

off Sigma Chi’s, 2-0, and then
romped over the Nu’s by an 11-0
score.

Further down the charts, the

INDIES BOMBED

Earlier in the week the Sig

The Pikas added a pair of

week with a 9-8 win over the
KA’s and an 18-6 steamroll over
the Betas.

Pika first baseman Tom
“Coach"’ Cook was wounded in
action against the KA’s when
KA shortstop John Frick acci-
dentally struck him with the ball
as Cook rounded second.

In other action, the Kappa
Sigs moved into a four way tie

Foglemen Roll Past Wakies

By CLIFF DUKE
Sports Writer

Paced by the performances of
Esmond Phelps. Pinky Hatcher
and Peter Parrott, Davidson's
tennis team swept, 5-4, over
Wake Forest here Tuesday.

“The score was only 5-4,"" said
coach Harry Fogleman, ‘‘but we
had the match won after the
number one doubles and then we
seemed to Jet up.”

The victory was especially
satisfying to the Wildcat fuzz

‘ballers, who must maintain a

winning punch in order to net
20 victories.

The bright spot of the day,
Fogleman said. was the out-
standing play of Phelps. The
‘Cats’ number one man demol-
ished the Deacon's standout.
Mike Rubenstein, to the tune of
6-3 and 9-7. Rubenstein, a strong
hitter and aggresstve offensive
player, was constantly blitzed
by Phelps’ soft, spinning volleys.

Hatcher, recovered from a
slump during which Fogelman
said he had been plagued by
“poor timing and footwork."’,
found his old finesse and trounc-
ed Ed Parker, 6-2. and 6-1.

He then teamed up with Peter
Parrott. who absorbed one of
the two singles’ setbacks, to de-
feat Rubenstein and Parker, 6-4,
6-3. in what Fogleman termed
the best doubles match by his
team this year.

Hatcher echoed this opinion,

declaring that ‘everything
seemed to work for both of us.
especially our serves and vol-
leys.""

According to Parrott, ‘we've
played well before. but lost be-
cause we didn't play as consis-
tently as we did against Wake
Forest,”

In other matches, Dave Jen-

nings downed Rob Knapp. 6-4.
6-3, while Geordie Mueiier ral
lied to beat. Ron MacVitti. 6-4.
7-5, afler dropping the first’ set.

The ‘Cats hosted Clemson last

tors. who watched as Davidson

kins. 6-4. 6-2. Phelps fashioned
out the next. best singles effqrt
in a 1-6, 6-8 loss to David Coop-
er.

In doubles. only Hearon and
Phelps managed to go more than
two sets. ‘They lost to Sam
Smithyman and Wilkins. 2-6. 6:2.

“When they give scholarships
and we don't. that’s what you've
got. to expect.” said Fogleman.
“Of course, we didn’t have one.
of our better matches. but I'm
afraid they are out of our class."

Fogleman said he thought
Clemson might beat North Caro-
lina in the ACC competition for
the conference title.

“Now we have to concentrate
on our own Conference games.”
said Fogleman. as he looked tu
matches with VMI and Rich- .
mond at Lexington, Va., today
and with West Virginia tomor-
row. The Foglemen will then
journey to Williamsburg for
matches with William and Mary
and George Washington next
week.
