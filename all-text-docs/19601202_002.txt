At present it is not definite if a
change in holiday schedule will be
proposed in the next faculty meet-
ing, Tuesday. December 6. We hope
that the faculty will consider an ex-
tension of the holiday period so as to
prevent students from having to re-
turn to Davidson in overcrowded
traffic conditions.

As we pointed out in the last issue of
THE DAVIDSONIAN, under the pre-

ficulty in obtaining public transporta-
tion.

We realize that it will be an in-
convenience to members of the
faculty and administration to  re-
schedule Monday lectures and pro-
grams, but we feel that this inconven-
ience is of minor importance when

a schedule change may avoid serious
injury to Davidson students.

The Football Dilemma

Davidson football has reached a
crossroad.

R. L. M.

one or two more really outstanding
football players each year. —

It's high time alumni, admijnistra-
tion. trustees and students woke up

But President Martin says that he
has no idea where the money would

to the fact.

Davidson has won four football
games in the past two years. We have
not won a home game in two years.
During this period we have won one
Southern Conference game.

And yet we play in the fastest

growing athletic conference. in the .

nation. The Southern Conference has
its sights set on the prosperity and
prestige ‘of big time football. Teams
from the Southern have invaded
Southeastern and Atlantic Coast Con-
ference schedules and are winning
football games.

The crossroad is ..d out in black
and white.

Davidson must have more scholar-
ships or resign from the Southern
Conference.

We can see no other alternative.
To continue under the present sub-
sidization policies will simply mean
more 1-8 and 3-5 seasoris.

And athletic programs and school
presitge wither and die when diseased
with sickly football records.

Which road is best? We don’t know,
and frankly, we’re glad we don’t have
to make the ‘choice. |

Briefly, here is the situation on
either side.

Coach Bill Dole says that he can
field a team that ‘can win in the’
Southern Conference if he is able to
recruit six more players a year; this
would mean six more scholarships,
bringing his team strength to 44.. It
would give him greater depth, and
increase his chances of recruiting

come from.

Also we have no guarantee that
the extra players would make very
much difference, especially in light
of the fact that most schools in the
conference would still be offering
more than twice as many scholarships
as Davidson.

The other alternative: Davidson
can resign from Southern Conference
competition in football, but not in min-
or sports.

We would instead play schools with
academic philosophies and _ goals
similar to ours, with comparable en-
trance requirements for football play-
ers.

ae aera

The difficulty here. is in finding
“amateur” competition. We would
probably play Washington and Lee,
Sewanee, and Centre, plus a few
other members of the simon pure set.

Because of dispersion and distance,
travel expenses would increase, while
gate receipts dwindle.

Some adherants of amateurism
would be shocked to know that most
of the amateurs aren’t as simon pure
as they’re made out to be. Coach Dole
has been outbid by Washington and
Lee on more than one high school
football star. W & L. simply offers
academic scholarships. W & L was
undefeated this year.

Which road do we traval? We don’t
know.

But we do know that people in
high places had better start doing
some realistic thinking. One way. or
another, something must be done.

Issue On Our Doorstep

Scott Lacy, Chairman of the Honor
Court, told THE DAVIDSONIAN edi-
torial staff Jast Monday that it was
time for a change in the college’s un-
enforceable under - the - influence
clause.

Lacy’s honesty and abruptness was
refreshing. We are all too used to
following most interviewees around
a circuitous path of glittering gener-
alities when such ticklish problems
as the drinking rule are under scru-
tiny.

The Lacy Interview is the second
stage of a study we are making on
the drinking problem and enforce-
ment. of the drinking rule.

THE DAVIDSONIAN is not simply
hunting for an issue to argue about.
The issue is already at hand, and the
problem has become more acute.

It all started with the creation of
the Honor Court, a group which was

supposed to make enforcment of the
drinking rule more efficient. But
the Honor Court has not initiated a
single case against a violator of the
drinking rule, in spite of the obvious
fact that scores of students are on
the campus and under the influence
every dance weekend.

Last spring, Dean Bailey, alarmed
by reports that there was alcohol on
the campus, asked Lacy to conduct a
private poll to see if the reports were
accurate. Lacy found that they were.

The administration and trustees
were concerned enough to hold an all
day committee meeting, with student
representatives present, to discuss
the drinking problem and after-dance
parties.

So the issue is parked on our front
doorstep. In the coming weeks, we
hope to present suggestions for solu-
tion of the problem. ,

Brains Do NotGuarantee & jee
Acceptance To Davidson

Davidsonian Managing Editor

s College!

, The contention that you only
have to be a “brain’ and then
you have it made holds no
water in regard to the David-
.son College admissions policies.
according to the annual report
to secondary schools.

! MANY REFUSED

Figures baséd on applications
;made_ in 1959 .(the present
{freshman class) reveal the sur-
prising fact that a good number
iof seniors with college board
scores. of 700-800 or places in
.the top quarter of their high
{school elass failed to be ac-
cepted, Why?

“The answer lies in the
;overall: admission policies.” ex-
‘plains H. Edmunds While, As-
sociate Director of Admissions.
‘St is in the same respect that
|some applicants are accepted
who only score in the 300-
| 399 range on the SAT.

Davidson looks for more than
just brains. Extensive attention
is paid to high school records,
extra- curricular activities,
community work, recommenda-
tions. ete. High grades or high
scores are by no means the
sole factor.

LEADERS

The high school records and
activities of our present fresh-
man class speaky highly. When
approximately one of every five
was president of his class. 24
head of the whole student body,
145 had varsity letters, and 21
were editor of the paper or an-
nual, you can‘be justly proud
anywhere.”

“We do not wish to be mis-
understood. though,” White
said. “They are important, of

course, as the figures show.

But they do not tell the whole
picture.”

For example, ho illustrated,
suppose an applicant had ex-
tremely high college boards,
and yet relatively poor high
school grades. He is not likely
to be accepted, for there seems
to be a good correlation between
application in high school. and
college,

In contrast. the boy with an
exceptional high school record,
but low college boards. would
have a better chance of accept-
ance. ‘We feel that the best
indication of what a student
will accomplish academically at
Davidson is his high school re-
cord,” the report states.

OVER 700

“Thus. seven students were
turned down wth SAT verbal
scores over 700. and two with
comparable scores in math
were also bypassed, while nine
were accepted with verbal
scores between 300-399 and 3
with math in ‘this range.

“We hesitate to give a cut
off point. on college boards. for
this very reason,” White ex-
plained, ‘because there are
exceptions. However, it is dif-
ficult to be accepted if the
scores are real low.”

Dear Editor:

mean college board scores for
each succeeding freshman class
have shown a steady increase.
The 1960 average was 562 ver-
bal, 598 math. as compared to
479-531 in 1957, 532-570 in
1958, and 539-577 in 1959.
Early figures on next year's

the junior year, while the above
figures are senior .scores.

The great stress placed on
high school academic records
is reflected more clearly in
figures related to rank. in class.
No public school applicant be-
low the second quarter of his
elass was accepted and only
15¢_ of those applying. who
were in .the second quarter
were approved.

SOME DENIED

Again, however, not all of
the higher ranking applicants
were accepted—only 74% of
the first quarter public school
applicants and just 58% of the
private school seniors in this
¥ank.. i

“We aren’t as selective con-
cerning high school grades for
instance as Macalester, Pomona
or Reed. Macalester draws 63%
of its freshmen from the upper
54; of their high school class-
es.” White commented,

mimeographed  cancella-
tion notices back over his
shoulder. “Here, take one
of these. Saves me having
to mail you one.

“Have a cookie.” He prof-
fers a newly opened box of
nut cookies, turns back to
his envelope-stuffing.

“News. The chapel choir

is getting new robes, but I

don’t know anything about that. Plott doesn’t either. No-

body knows anything.”

You broach the subject of the interview. .. An inter-
view featuring Herb Russell.
He drops his envelopes, whirls around.
“Me? God, no. No, sir. No publicity. All I’ve done is
work all my life and that's nothing you can write about.

No. sir.”
Brief silence. Then:

“Go interview John Brice, the colored fella who does
all the mimeographing. He's the one with all the

stories to tell.’
You rise, say goodbye.

“Go on and interview John Brice. I’m second in com-
mand to him around here, anyway.”
You say goodbye again, head for the door.
Herb Russell flings his parting shot: “I don’t want
publicity. Just print that crap | send out on the Artist

Series, and I’m happy.”

Outside, the cold afternoon.

No interview today.

Magazine Rates Davidson
Among Top Small Colleges

Davidson has been cited in
*Time” surpasses thousands of
one of “50 private four-year
liberal arts colleges that can
give a good education to the
high school senior who cannot
get into Amherst and Co.”

“We're delighted to be in-
cluded in a specific listing of
good colleges,’ commented H.
Edmunds White, Associate
Director of Admissions. ‘‘Men-
tion in a national magazine like
“Time" surpasses thousands of
dollars of paid advertising.”

FIFTH ARTICLE

This was the fifth such arti-
cle in national publications
within the past two years to

highlight Davidson as a top-.

ranking small college, which
the student might consider who
cannot make an Ivy League
school.

“Several members

of our

freshman class have indicated
they applied to Davidson on the
basis of a similar article in
Harper's two years ago,” White
said, '
MONEY MATTERS

The articles furnish publicity

little or nothing is known of

article is the listing of cost’
per year. In this list of the!
less expensive better schools,
only three of the 50 cost less
than Davidson.

“Jt certainly helped to be!

tentional ranking. Being first

who will not read the whole
article,” White said.

or just don’t want to be put
into an awkward situation.
The distinction between
“duty bound” and “honor
bound” is interpreted as free-
ing all but student council
or honor court members in
official function at the time
of any obligation to enforce
the rule. Expediency prevents
a drinker’s reporting a vio-
tator, for this would under-
mine the tacit “security-pact”
of denial and or silence.
The rule probably exists to
prevent the faculty's enforcing
a similar rule, and to relieve
them of a task. perhaps almost
as unsavory to some of them
as to students, which some feel
imperative for the “image” of
a church-related (often errone-
ously called Christian) college.
if drinking is basically
bad (due to location near or
sponsorship by the coflege?),
if punishment is the best cure
or preventive, it is stil! doubt-
ful that severity of punish-
ment is more effective than
certainly of punishment,
Particularly when, as at pre-
sent, both are practically,
pragmatically non-existent.
This weakens respect for all
regulations, being singularly
incongruous with the one de-
manding that “official state-
ments” be true. It seems that
if students should be honest

in “official statements” (and
this seems to be one), that stu-
dents not intending to enforce
this rule should, insofar as
they are responsible for its
existence move to abolish it:

Dear Editor:

This is a good opportunity
for you to hear from me again,
for this is the first time I’m
able to write a few lines to THE
DAVIDSONIAN, and this time
1 want to thank everybody for
the visits they’ paid me here at
the hospital, since the very
day I was in the wreck.

1 also want fo thank to aff
the people that in one way or
another are related to David-
son, people who without know-
ing me most of them, were
very kind to me and never
forgot a foreign student, send-
ing me flowers, or something
to eat or to wear, or just pay-
ing me a visit, which some-
times cheered me up even
more than presents, for |
consider that people have to
get along with people and
not with packages, and |! got
really used to the “Davidson
Family”, in such a way that
whenever t saw one of them
in my room | felt better at
once.

For those who were able to
come to see me, and for those
who studied (or dated) too much
and were not, I want to say
that I'm recovering pretty fast
and that you'll have to accept
my company again in a very
short time, because they told
me they need the bed over here.

Letters Lash Drinking Rule, ROTC;
mm Expresses Thanks

lf you want to see me be-
fore 1 leave the hospital,
you'll have to hurry up and
do it this week-end, for 1

happen next week (Room

I look forward to see you all

Dear Editor: :

In the light of the ROTC’s
“justification by faith’, as re-
ported by President Martin, I
would like to point up some
of the more interesting facts
about the ROTC.

Of course, everyone knows
that it’s all rosey on paper.
But our ROTC doesn’t let
that stop them. They can
drill us for an hour and
twenty minutes, and stilt be
perfectly justified. (Just ask
Major Fleming; he can justify

anything from the verbal in-
spiration of the SOP to the
annihilation of the human
race.)

Advanced cadets benefit even
more from broken promises.
For them one hour of drill
has become three hours of
Tuesday afternoon ‘instruc:
tion.” MS II's have not
received parts of the uniforms
that were promised to them
completely free.

But perhaps we have been
deprived of the last laugh
—the reasons why this de-
voutly Christian college not
only tolerate the asinine
rantings and unscrupulous
deceif of the ROTC, but even
requires her students to sub-
mit to its every request—.
from wasting five hours a
week to compulsory hypocrisy.

May I suggest, ‘without hav-
ing to spend too many hours in
Belk Basement, that this ROTC
ought not to be so blindly de-
fended by the President of this
outstanding Southern college
dedicated to Christian educa-
tion?
