through difficult schedule

The wrestling team faces

tough competition this Satur-
day when it travels to Lexing-
ton, Va., for the Washington
and Lee Invitational. On Febru-
ary 2, the wrestlers return to
Johnston Gym for their first
home match since before Christ-
mas. They will be facing Fur-.
man in a dual meet.

Senior captain Pat Dulany
looks forward to returning to
Davidson and says, ‘I think
we'll beat Furman.’’ Dulany
also noted that there will be a
scrimmage against Wake Fo-
rest in Johnston Gym next
Tuesday.
son wrestlers have been strug-

gling through a series of tough
road matches. Last week the
squad lost to Campbell College
on Tuesday and fared poorly in

the Bulldog Invitational at the _

Citadel on Saturday.

Against Campbell, Dulany
and freshman Scott Smith were
the only victors, by a superior
decision and a pin, respectively.

The meet Saturday in Char-
leston involved eight teams,
ses Duke and Georgia Tech.
Smith registered the Cats’ only
finish in the money, placing
third in the 134-pound weight
class. Dulany, Scott Phillips,
and Svend Pederson also won
matches.

Long ticket line at Duke-Davidson game raises
questions about Davidson's student ticket policy

By BERT MOBLEY
Sports Editor

Philip Blue cringed somewhat
at the question put to him about
the Duke-Davidson basketball
ticket situation. ‘‘I should have
told the students to come
earlier. We didn’t expect such
an overflow at the ticket win-
dow,’’ Blue said. Blue, in his

first year as ticket office mana- °

ger for the Wildcats, did not,
however, accept all the blame.
for the confusion in the lobby of
the Charlotte Coliseum on Jan.
2 as the top-ranked (at that
time) Blue Devils met David-

BON .e es
Blue said that he simply had

too much to do in the booth by
himself: checking ID’s, getting
and assigning tickets, and
marking off the names. The
result was a line so long that
some students missed the first
half of the game.

The Duke contest was dif-
ferent from the other Wildcat
games. It was an important
game played during the Christ-
mas break, so the ticket proce-
dure was altered. Blue said, ‘I
don’t make the rules. I have to
follow the higher-ups.’’ The
higher-ups include Davidson
Athletic Director Thomas Cart-
mill and others in the athletic
department.

There was concern that some
of the student tickets would fall
into the wrong hands and not be
used as they should; students
might sell their complimentary
tickets if they could not per-
sonally attend, according to

-Cartmill

So the ticket policy for the
Duke game was changed.

“We just assumed that the
students would be out of town,”
Cartmill said, ‘‘We did not
foresee the problems with the
line at the Coliseum.”

The ticket policy for the

Rifle team places second at Clemson

By BILL WILSON

Saturday, the Davidson
rifle team traveled to Clemson
to take on Appalachian, Wof-
ford, and the host Tigers. The

surprising Cats, whose only -

three losses this year have been
to the Appalachian State Moun-
taineers, lost a close one to
them by a 1313-1323 score. This
was the smallest margin of
defeat yet for Davidson at the
hands of Appalachian. Clemson
was third with 1263 points, and
Wofford scored 1210 points.

The team was led by John
Parham. His outstanding score
of 279 was high for the match,
and also established a new
Davidson match record.

Parham said that he knew
during the match he was near-
ing a possible record. ‘‘I knew I
would blow it if I let the
pressure get to me. I had to just
concentrate on every bull’s
eye.”” He continued, “It really
did feel good. I got good shots,
too.” Freshman Craig Rice also
had a fine match. His 269
equalled the score of. the top
Appalachian shooter. Katherine

Whitney was third for the Cats
with a 263, and Pat Stuard and
Tom Niblock added a pair of
246’s. John Hartman, Robbie
Kirkendol, and Louis Williams
also shot for the team.

The victories over Clemson
and Wofford upped the team’s
record to 12-3. Team captain
Katherine Whitney expressed
surprise at the squad’s impres-
sive start. ‘‘We’re working to-
gether as a team. Several people
are shooting top scores; we
don’t have to depend on one
person.”’

With the season about half-
way.over, the team will have to
shoot well to finish out the year
in a similar style. This Satur-
day, four team members will
head south for the competitive
Florida Invitational. During the
upcoming weeks the Cats will
face Appalachian three more
times, plus The Citadel and

VMI among other Southern —

Conference foes.

challenge Davidson at the Sou-
thern Conference Championship
match on February 17. Appa-
lachian and VMI expected to

take the top two team spots,
and Davidson could place third
if it can defeat The Citadel, as it
did last year.

The Wildcats are also hoping
for a second-place finish in the
championship match of the
six-team Western Carolinas
Conference--a rifle conference.
They presently hold down that
spot in the conference stan-
dings.

Whitney expressed the team

feelings about the remainder of.

the season. ‘Our scores have
gone up every match,”’ she said.
“We're really excited.’”’

Furman comes
to Charlotte

on Saturday

The Furman Palladins will be
the visitors in the Charlotte
Coliseum Saturday. Furman is
in second place in the Southern
Conference and have beaten the
Wildcats previously this sea-
son. The game will begin at 7:30
pm.

regular games played in Char-
lotte as well as the special Duke
game were made to ‘‘try to
resolve the waste factor’’
according to Cartmill. He added
that the ticket procedure was
contrived as an “effort to cut
down on the loss of free tickets,
the ones not used, and those
given away.’’ Cartmill added
that following the present
system should give all students
a chance at a good seat.

Cartmill stated that the tic-
ket policy is reviewed every few
years by the alumni office, the
Wildcat Department, the finan-
cial department, etc., and an
evaluation of its assets and
problems is made. He said, ‘‘We
will review it again and get an
input from different facets of
the college community. We
cannot satisfy everybody. A
good financial job and a service
to the community are our two’
primary objectives.”’
