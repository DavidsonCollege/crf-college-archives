Get Yourself Ready
For The Davidson Arts Festival

By Will Montgomery

On the Saturday before exams
when you have finished your third
twenty page paper and haven’t yet
looked at your notes, the Davidson
ArtsFestival will usurp your sched-
ule with serious fun. Serious fun is
the kind to indulge in when you are
busy but looking for distractions.

We, the organizers of the
Davidson Arts Festival, are telling
you thisnow, two andahalf months
in advance, for several reasons.
Go ahead and start studying for
exams now so you will have time
to come. More importantly, all
you artist types out there listen up:
the Davidson Arts Festival wants
you.

We intend to create a multi-

media festival occasion. Visual
artists from the Davidson commu-
nity and student artists will display
their works throughout the Student
Union. This includes painting,
sculpture, drawing, folk art and
whatever else may arise. All work
will be for sale.

Student musicians are invited
to perform in the 900 Room. The
Reddick\Stone\Cochran guitar
wizards will most likely jam but
classical or jazz musicians are
equally welcome. To incorporate
performance art we hope to alter-
nate theatre with music. One act
plays, short skits, even improvisa-
tional sketches or mime is pos-
sible. The Davidson Dance Troupe
is invited to perform as well.

The gist of this festival is to
gather together the diverse talent
hidden among students and the
Davidson community for an after-
noon of relaxation and celebra-
tion. Coming just before the final
exam period, the Festival should
allow folks to pause and reflect on
the community around them and
the semester behind them.

If you are interested in this
festival and wish to participate,
especially if youarea Theatre, Art,
or Music major, a local artist, a
faculty member with a unique tal-
ent, or just have ideas please call
Will Montgomery at 896-0953,
Stewart Lathan at 896-68 13 or Ruth
Pittard at the Union, 896-2140.

Mattea, the winner for the last two
years, has had little success on the
radio and has only released three
songs since she won last year. Patty
' Loveless is a favorite of miné, and
her album On Down the Line is
excellent. But this year has be-
longed to Reba- what a comeback
she has staged. Many thought that
Reba’s period of dominance had
quietly come to a close; but, in the
last year, shehas silenced critics as
well as her competitors. Her four
big hit singles (“Rumor Has It”,
“Fancy”) should make this one a
