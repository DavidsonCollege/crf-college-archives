‘They Didn’t Have To Shoot Him...’

By DAVID SWEAT
Staff Writer

ORANGEBURG, S. C. — Delano Herman Middle-:

ton was buried recently in a weed-grown cemetery
near his Orangeburg home. His sister screamed con-
tinuously, “They didn’t have to shoot him....”

Middleton, a high schoo] student, and two State
College students died of gunshot wounds they suffered
the night of Feb. 8. Their deaths came at the end of a
week of racial violence at South Carolina State College
in Orangeburg.

The death of the three students has been the cen-
tral inflammatory fact in public arguments and contra-
dictions since that time. The students fell before the
gunfire of South Carolina state patrolmen after three
continuous nights of violence.

A report issued by the Southern Regional
Council asked why less lethal methods of riot
control such as tear gas or mace were not em-

ployed.

The SRC report said Orangeburg’s riots portrayed
to the rest of the nation a “frightening spectacle of an
over-escalation of police and military force . .. and a
conditioning of the American public mind already far
along to an acceptance of violence and death in the
resolution of problems.”

South Carolina Governor Robert E. McNair justi-
fied the patrolmen’s firing on the students.

“The actions leading to three deaths and the
numerous injuries came only after an extended period
of sniper fire from the campus, and then not until an
officer had been felled during his efforts to protect
life and property,” McNair said.

Yet no weapons were confiscated by police on the
campus. No one has ever suggested that a national

guardsman could have fired a shot by mistake.

Later it was found that the felled patrolman
had been hit by a thrown object and not by gun-
fire.

Federal Bureau of Investigation officials are now
attempting to find out who did fire the first shot.

The Los Angeles Times — Washington Post News
Service reported that more than half of the 30 Negro
students treated for bullet wounds received in the Feb.
8 violence had been shot in the back.

The SRC report cited this news service, the Na-
tional Broadcasting Company, and Jack Bass of ‘‘The
Charlotte Observer” as the only representatives of the
national news media who did not accept the official
interpretation and justification of events at Orange-
burg.

The Richardson Fellows
Program is an experiment in
the development of the lead
ership potential of Davidson
students. Since its instigation
last year on the Davidson
campus, the program ‘has
drawn both harsh criticism
and lavish plaudits.

Last year 12 boys were
chosen from the freshman
class to participate in the
program. This year, some 85.

sion. From this group, 25

spoke to State College students last Sunday on the eve
of the re-opening of classes Monday. Wilkins said the
three Negro students had been “murdered.”

He urged Gov. McNair to admit that the fatal
shooting of the three students was an error.

“Black power advocates” have been blamed

by MeNair for the trouble. Cleveland Seliers, 23,

Sellers had little influence at the two colleges
(Claflin College, another Negro college, adjoins the
S.C. State campus) and did not recommend violence,
according to the SRC report.

The lesson drawn from the three deaths by one
major South Carolina newspaper editor was that vio-
lence is a futile road to solving social differences, ‘a
grim lesson that is not in the text-books.”

The segregated All-Star Bowling Lanes was the
apparent cause of the Orangeburg violence. A federal
court order has since forced that establishment to ad-
mit Negroes until the owner can prove that his business
is not covered by existing civil rights laws.

Yet the SRC report found the major cause of the
violence to be not black power advocates seeking to
incite riot to integrate the bowling alley. Rather, the
quality of education at the two colleges was blamed.

The day before the three deaths 1,800 stu-
dents presented a dozen grievances to Orangeburg
city officials demanding action as the price for
halting riots.

Though state spokesmen have not taken public
notice of it, there has been trouble brewing on the
S.C. State campus for over a year.

A tragic prediction has come true. In an April 9,

1967, a column entitled “Bombs, Blossoms” in Charles-
ton “The News and Courier,” writer Hugh Gibson
urged that steps be taken to avoid what he warned
would be serious violence on the S.C. State campus.
He calied the campus a “de-fused bomb” that could
go off at any time in the future.

Gibson had witnessed the announcement that the
class boycott was over and that the planned march on
the office of Gov. McNair had been called off.

Both protest measures had been guided by
the student body president and the four class
presidents. The protests were initiated in behalf of
three students suspended for unauthorized cam-
+t demonstrations.

Apparently conferences with a gubernatorial aid

“eased tensions at that time. A suit filed for readmission

of the three students was successful.

Under great student pressure the college Presi-
dent B. C. Turner resigned in May. A trustee commit-
tee never found a successor.

Maceo Nance Jr., formerly business manager of
the college, was named acting president of the college
last June. He served in that capacity throughout the
recent violence and remains acting president now.

Students returned to State College last Monday
after two weeks suspended classes.

The state field director of the NAACP, the
Rev. I. DeQuincy Newman, predicted violence and
bloodshed if students returned to State College
and Claflin College to find conditions the same.

Newman warned, “If students return to school
and find those same conditions, they will tear down the
schools and tear down the city so that there will be
such a bloodbath, the likes of which has never been
recorded in all the history of South Carolina.”

How do you organize stu-
dents? “I go by and grab a
few freshmen, then a few
sophomores, and a few jun-
iors, and 1 avoid seniors like
the plague,.”’ explained Joe
Beard, leader of the campus
conservatives and a dominat-
ing figure in the Young Re-
publicans Club.

“Davidson has a great deal
of apathy concentrated in the
Senior Class,” Beard contin-
ued, but said that there is “a
leadership core—sometimes a
corpse’’ which does every-
thing around the school.

Smiling as he emphasized
the role of hard work in poli-
tics, Beard became pensive
only when he talked of the
probability of success in his
effort to have conservatism
predominate.

He evidently enjoys the po-
sition which he holds as the
leading conservative figure
on campus, and elaborated
on the methods of building a
group like the Young Repub
licans.

“You gotta work the halls.
you've got to know who can
be worked on, who can work.
Some people want to join and
be inactive. Some people
might want to join if you put
a little pressure. Some don't
really want to join, but will
contribute to the party.

ally grateful if you can find

efforts have given them ‘‘a
large treasury aS well as
many members with which

Beard has formerly been
the executive secretary for
the state college YRC and is
an active recruiter for the
Republican party in his
area.

Leaders are divided into
two general categories by
Beard: “those. who are in it
for principle and those in it
for the profit.”

... grateful to find leaders

Those who enter a group
for the personal profit will
not go out on a limb. he add-
ed, as will those who join
for their principles.

Identifying himself as one
who joins for the principle,
Beard added, ‘I'm interest-
ed in the man who will stand
up against history and say.
‘Hell, no!’ "

Beard said that the typical
student attitude to leaders is
“This guy knows more than
I do, this guy does more than
I do. I can’t make a rational
decision, so I'll let him de-
cide.”’

Beard said the faculty was
no help to him because of
their attitude. and the occa-
sional attacks on him by
various professors in class.
“The whole trend on campus
finds its fulfillment in the
New Left."’ he said.

“They don’t directly make
it hard for you,”’ he said, re-
ferring to conservatives in
general, ‘if what you are try-
ing to organize is academic-
ally respectable.”

Beard said his major mis-
take while he has led David-
son conservatism was allow-
ing personal ambition and
prejudice to come before
“doing what must be done.”

But he attributed this fail-
ure to conservative leader-

ship in general, and said that
it may prevent conservative
victory.

Beard: classified the YRC
as a “technical organization
to learn the techniques of
electing Republicans. If at
the same time it isn't given
a purpose, it isn't worth any
thing.”

He says that he is active.

Right.”

treat.

Besides developing Jeader-
ship, one of the basic aims
of the program is to gain a
clearer concept of what is in:
volved in being a leader, Be-
cause of limited funds and
personnel end the experimen-
tal nature of the program,
the number of fellows has to
be limited. This makes the
selection of fellows even more
difficult and important.

Despite the importance of
selecting students having
leadership potential, Dr. Wil
liam McGavock, faculty ad
viser to the Richardson pro
gram. is reluctant to pinpoint
the specific characteristics
being looked for in the can
didates.

“One of the important
things in this type of pro
gram.’' McGavock explained.
‘is to keep the selection
process wide open.”

There may be many differ
ent types of leadership. he
continued. Leadership may
be exhibited in-a “quiet way
in- music or literature’ as
well as the qualities of lead

rship often shown by indus-
trial leaders.

McGavock believes that the
Richardson Program should

“not be a classroom-type ex-

perience. Instead, it should
consist of a confrontation
with problems, with people
who are acknowledged lead-
ers in different fields, and
with various experiences
which challenge their imagi-
nations and their ability to
lead.

Student Leaders

With Student Govern-
ment Association elections
a few days away, THE
DAVIDSONIAN presents a
report on student leaders
and the influence they ex-
ert. The report focuses on
the criteria for leadership
in a story about the Rich-
ardson Fellows program,
and on the organizational
problems of leadership.

Finally, it examines the
results of a leadership void
at a small South Carolina
college.

The program hopes ‘‘to
awaken in some men the-tre
mendous ability to serve oth
ers and the desire to do this.”’
McGavock said. ‘‘Leadership
demands dedication.”

Mike Mooty, student direc
tor of the program, added
that the type of boy wanted
in the program is one who is
“emotionally mature, having
a fairly well-developed con
cept of himself and his effec
tiveness and ineffectiveness.

“A leader should be able
to analyze a situation and the
people in a situation and or
ganize them effectively to ac-
complish a goal. He should
be sensitive with a social
awareness and concern.”

When asked if it. would not
be better if the program
could be extended to more
students, Mooty agreed that
indeed it would, but that the
experimental nature of the
program and limited resource
es did not enable this pres.
ently,

He added, ‘I'd like to have
a staff of 50 and $500,000 a
year to take every interested
man in the school into the
program.”

McGavock said that ‘‘a
great many people are point
ing a finger at the academic
leadership for leaving a job
to be done in developing
jeadership from among the
students. These people have
been greatly enthused over
the program.

“Davidson has a definite
responsibility to the world
community,"’ Mooty contin-

ued. “Academic preparation
‘is of primary importance. but
the college should also chal
lenge a man who has talents
in any area.’’such as in the
development of leadership.

The ways in which the pro
gram has been trying to en
courage and develop leader
ship have varied. One of the
main means is through sum
mer internships which are
now being procured for the
fellows.

For example. one of the
Fellows is considering an in-
ternship this summer with
Wachovia Bank: Two hoys
may go to New Haven, Con.,
to work in a high school proj
ect to develop and inspire
talented youngsters coming
from underprivileged areas.

The Fellows -are also en
couraged to attend education

i =,

-

conferences as -well as to
partcipate in seminars and
discussions with prominent
leaders coming to the David
son campus. Three will be
traveling to Washington at
the end of the month to at-
tend a conference. The Fel-
lows also plan to sponsor a
race-relations symposium at
the college next fall.

Mooty and McGavock both
point to the screening part of
the selection process in which
the Fellows themselves take
part as being one of the most
educational and valuable. as
pects of the program.

It is difficult to judge the
value of the program at this
potential or in its discovery

of those intangible qualities -

time, either as to effective

ness in developing leadership

which :aake up leadership.

But some. advantages have
already been noted.

For example “One thing
we have already gotten out
of the program,’’ McGavock
said, ‘‘is the awaruness that
so many students at David
son are interested in having
this type of program."

McGavock said that since
the nature of the program it-
self was experimental, vari
ous mistakes could be expect-
ed and indeed had already
been made.

““No experiment can be ex
pected to explode suddenly
into a beautiful success.’’ he
said. “It is our hope that.
through the money which is
being spent, we will be able
to discover some avenues to
learn more about leadership
and how it can be devel.
oped.”

Student Leaders Don’t Exist, Says Mungo

By 80B REID
Managing Editor

There is no such thing as a
student leader, according to
a former student activist.

“Students who have formal
positions in the student gov-
ernment are not really lead-
ers’ said Ray Mungo, for-
mer editor of the Boston Uni-
versity News and now direc-
tor of the Liberation News
Service in Washington, D. C.

“The student: community
has no leaders. I interpret

the word ‘lead’ to mean giv-
ing directions and impetus to
students by personal contact.
I know of no one doing this
today."

“It is impossible for stu
dent government presidents
to do this, but they usually
don’t. The president usually
deals only with the council,
which is an elite group with
no power to change any-
thing.”

Mungo said a leadership
gap exists in all contempo-

rary American society and
not just on campuses.

“Having power doesn't
make a man a leader.’’ Mun-
go added. He also said that
students who have influence
are not true leaders unless
they personally inspire and
direct people to accomplish
something.

Often the most influential
people on campus are people
who hold no official position
in the student body, Mungo
said. He cited ghetto work-
ers and radical activists as

examples.

“In general they are more
creative and more intelligent
than most students,” he said.
“Although their position may
not be formal, they are do-
ing something constructive in
social reform or whatever
their thing is."

‘These people are more
‘leaders’ in the sense of point
ing the way, even though an
army of people may not be

following them. But they are

making changes and getting
things done.”

Mungo said he considered
not only leftist agitators as
exerting leadership but also
right-wingers, such as_ the
Young Americans for Free-
dom.

While a student at Boston
University, Mungo instituted
sweeping reforms in the stu-
dent newspaper, making it
the center of a campus wide
controversy. His staff sent
two reporters to South Viet-
nam with funds raised by prd-
jects such as the staging of
the New England premiere of

**MacBird.”

Even though he pioneered
changes at Boston U and
held an influential position,
Mungo does not consider
himself to have been a real
leader.

“Obviously, I had influ-
ence," he said. “But it was
by virtue of power of sugges-
tion. There was nothing for.
mal to make people follow
me. I had no office. I was
leading indirectly through the
BU News. My power was
only intellectual.”
