College Kitchen
Tastes like

chicken
(parmesan)

By Jay SHULTz
& Ros Kosicxi
Davidsonian chefs-in-residence

Our goal in writing this article
is to provide a home-away-from-
home cooked meal that is very
tasty, easy to cook, and most im-
portantly, affordable. We want to
give students with access to a
kitchen an alternative to the fast
food capitol of the world,
Cornelius, North Carolina.

We would like to start off with
one of our favorite meals, chicken
parmesan. The cost for this meal
for four people will be about $20.00
(excluding accompanying bever-
ages), and it will take less than 45.
minutes to prepare. Here is what
you will need:

1 3/4 lbs. boneless, skinless
chicken breast

1/4 cup grated parmesan
cheese

1 medium jar of your favorite
spaghetti sauce

1 cup bread crumbs

12 oz. shredded mozzarella

° cheese

1/2 cup vegetable oil

2 eggs or 1/2 cup of milk

1 16 oz. box of linguini,
‘fettuccine, or spaghetti

1 case of beer (optional)

Preheat oven to 350 F. Cut
any excess fat off of chicken breasts
and rinse them under running cold
water. Place bread crumbs in one
bowl and eggs (thoroughly
whipped with a fork) or milk in a
separate bowl. Add parmesan
cheese to bowl of ‘bread crumbs
and mix together. Heat vegetable
oil in a frying pan (set at med-hi).
Depending on the size of your pan,
the amount of oil needed may vary.
Just put enough so that a thin layer
covers the bottom of the pan. Next,
take chicken and dip in eggs or
milk, then roll in bread crumbs.
Cook chicken on each side 4-5

minutes or until the bread crumbs |

turn golden brown. While the
chicken is cooking, prepare a pot
of boiling water for the linguini.
When the chicken is done,
place them ina baking pan. Cover
the chicken with the desired amount
of spaghetti sauce, keeping in mind
that the excess sauce in the pan will
be used to cover the linguini. Next,
spread the shredded mozzarella
cheese over the chicken and sauce.
Place the pan in the oven, andalso
add linguini to the boiling water
and let it cook 10-12 minutes or
until done. Strain pasta and set
aside in serving bowl. We hope
that everyone has mastered the
ability to cook pasta by now, so
this part should not be a problem.
Atthis time you may choose to add
a pat of butter or garlic butter to
your linguini. When the cheese
has.melted and is turning a golden
brown, remove from the oven and

an embroidered cow pillow, and
the bathroom flaunts acustom cow
pattern shower curtain.

Only one other apartment wa
able to match the level of continu-
ity as the last. Lexi DuVane, Lisa
Knox, Heather Crouse, and Char-
lotte Grey refer to their apartment’s
theme as “Jungle Love.” Match-
ing double decker cheetah print
end tables sit either side a couch

with leopard print throws. Several
lager pillows lounge on the floor
with various animal prints. Au-
thentic African paintings adorn the
walls. Two decorative plates offer
silhouettes of an elephant and a
lion. The room is finished off with
an obvious resource: a hardback,
limited-edition copy of the Ency-
clopedia of Bad Taste.

I cannot thank enough those
who allowed me a peak into their
lives and artistry. I want to espe-
cially thank Amy Burrows for co-
ordinating many of the visits. If
nothing else, the experience was
inspiring.

Lunar Luau
“Get’s ‘Em Off”

By ELIzaABETH COLEMAN
Staff Writer

The annual Lunar Luau made
a spectacular appearance once
again in Richardson Field Friday
night. The event kicked off with
the Wildcat cheerleaders leading
their fellow wildcats in a spirited
pep rally, a perfect adrenaline
pumper to begin the evening.

This social event sponsored
by the Union Board is one of the
most popular and highly attended
school-wide activities of the year.
(Of course — who would pass up
free Ben & Jerry’s?)

But for those who missed this
annual social gathering, the true
college spirit was in the air, aseven
the freshman seemed to enjoy one
of their few remaining Court-less
evenings. Music, frisbee, andeven
Twister created the festive atmo-
sphere that is ever present at the
Lunar Luau.

The two most popular Union
sponsored attractions, the Ameri-
can Gladiator-esque “Get ‘Em Off”
and the Velcro Olympics, were
huge successes among the crowd.

The Velcro Olympics con-
sisted of an inflatable obstacle
course covered with velcro. The
participants, wearing attractive
velcro suits, skillfully (but most of
the time not) maneuvered their way
through the course, while at the
same time ripping themselves off
the walls and tunnels in order to
successfully reach the end first.

Those Olympians talented enough
to make it to the end without end-
ing up on the ground to the side or
stuck toa wall definitely seemed to
enjoy their experiences as well as
somewhat disoriented sophomore
Dan Creekman enjoyed his:
“There’s velcro everywhere,
Da(rn)it! You get stuck!”

The other popular attraction,
the American Gladiators event,
consisted of a padded battleground
in which two opponents stood on
pedestals and tried to pummel the
other to the ground with a padded
stick-like swatter thing. This event
was one which I actually had the
nerve to try out. Unfortunately,
my opponent, Sean Harvey (‘96)
killed me. (I advise against any-
one with my non-existant strength
and agility to play a game that
involves something being swung
at you by a’wrestler.) Neverthe-
less, my short-lived stardom as a
gladiator was nothing less than
awesome.

The one Patterson Court spon-
sored activity, SigEp’s paintball
shooting, also drew a great deal of
attention from the crowd. If you
missed your opportunity to shoot
paint at unarmed fraternity broth-
ers who actually want paint shot at
them, you may unfortunately never
have the chance again — until next
year.

Thanks to the Union Board
for a great night of food and enter-
tainment that was definitely a suc-
cess.
