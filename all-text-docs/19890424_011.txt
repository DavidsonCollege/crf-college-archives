The Davidson women’s tennis team
raised its record to 9-6 with three victo-
ries last week. The Lady Cats defeated
the University of Kalamazoo, East
Tennessee State and Appalachian State.
The. victories over ETSU and ASU
raised the team’s conference record to
2-0.

Last Sunday, the Lady Cats travelled
to Durham to play Kalamazoo. The
match proved to be fairly easy, as
Davidson won 8-1. Amy McNelis, Mary
Beth Ruth, Virginia. Hall, Jane Price,
Laura Ross and Alice Stubbs all won as
the team swept the singles competition.
The doubles teams of McNelis-Hall and
Stubbs-Angela Rudert also won.

The team returned home Monday to
open Southern Conference action
against ETSU. The Buccaneers proved
to be a surprising tough opponent as the

tory. The team dropped the number one
and two singles, and the number two
doubles.

However, the rest of the squad came
through with victories. Hall, Price,

while Ruth-Price and Stubbs-Rudert took
their doubles matches. Unfortunately, the
number one player, McNelis, injured her
knee in the match and is out of action in-

definitely. =
Tuesday, the Lady Cats continued con-"

ference play against ASU. The Mountain-
eers were weaker than: expected as
Davidson won 9-0. Stubbs replaced the
injured McNelis in the number one slot to
lead the team. The other singles winners
were Ruth, Hall, Price, Rudert and Ross.
In the doubles competition, Melissa Carr
and Hall, Ruth-Price and Stubbs-Rudert
all won.

Coach Caroline Brown is fairly happy
with her team’s performance so far. She is
pleased with the strong singles play she
has been getting; however, she is still con-
cerned with the doubles play. In the next
few matches, she plans to juggle the
doubles lineup. Another change is the re-
turn of Marion Stone from Kenya. As a
result of McNelis’ injury, Stone is being
thrown right into the lineup. :

Brown expected to have her conference
squad set by last Friday. The Lady Cats
play away against Hope and defending
conference champion Furman next week.

Senior Jane Price delivers a powe; tul return for the ‘Lady Cats. Price has proven herself
competitive in singles and doubles this year.

Women’s soccer gets

varsity status

Fielding a competitive team with

dedicated players. Popes
By GREG WORMUTH : The season began in early Feb-
_ The Trustee’s Gtiniowrdiiting ~ tuary with a 7-3 victory over the

\the end of February to create a
women’s varsity soccer team was
major progress for the current
women’s club soccer team.’

The first big step to this goal
was the club team’s movement
into the North Carolina Women’s
Soccer League last season. Previ-
ously, the Davidson club lacked
league affiliation. This league
offers a heightened caliber of play

over the previous system of indi- —

vidually finding games with
whomever would play.

As rising senior Ann Hicks
stated, “We wanted to move into
the league to illustrate that we
could play well against contpeti-
tive teams and could field dedi-
cated players.”

The team has indeed done so,,

with a current record of 3-0. |

Salem. College club team. After
cancelling a few games due to
weather, the team followed with a
2-0 win over the Winston-Salem
Wildcards and beat the Greens-
boro Sidekicks, 5-1.

The Lady. Wildcats ended their

season with a 2-0 lead over |.

Fishfare, but a controversy over
technicalities resulted in a Wild-
cat forfeit.

Hicks attributes much of the
team’s success to a strong fresh-
man class and hopes that they will
continue to produce similar re-

sults next year, when the team | :

year’s varsity status. The change
will result in a larger budget for
uniform and equipment purchases

in addition to tough competition.
