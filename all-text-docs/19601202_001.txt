Pledge Classes Defend [HQnor Court Chairman
Attacks Drinking Rule

Freshman Rush Policy

By BILL PRIDGEN
Davidsonian Staff Writer

Fraternity pledge class leaders will propose that a student-faculty committee
be given power to enforce pledge training rules and that Freshman Rush be retain-
ed in a group of recommendations to be presented to the faculty at their monthly

meeting Tuesday.

The proposal. formulated by
representatives of the pledge
classes, suggests that ‘Fresh-
man Rush be retained in its en-
tirety except for the following
six ‘limitations.

Stud. running. paddling, car
washing. menial tasks, and any
practice which causes severe
humiliation be abolished and in-
stead the pledge -brothers be
required to visit five of his fra-
ternity brothers. a week until
he has visited all of them, and
of his. own accord after that.

Pledges may only clean hous-
es on the occasions of dance
week-ends, alumni visitations,
and other special visits of im-
portant persons, (The pledges
could clean the house as a
pledge project, but it is not
niandatory.)

A committee of an even stud-
ent-faculty ratio bet up to over-
see pledge training, and that
they have the authority to make
and enforce suggestions for the
improvement of pledge train-
ing.

posed during, the first five

out of mectings held on Nov.
21 and 28 when representatives
of the twelve fraternity pledge
classes met to discuss improve-
ments of the present fratern-
ity system.

PRESENT SURVEY

The composite results of a
survey taken of all the pledg-
es generally feel that the only
in each fraternity -will also be
presented 10 the faculty.

This survey  concérning
pledge training reveals that
“the majority of pledges feel.
that pledge training. does not
take away time that is needed
for study. and those who felt
that time was taken away. from
their studies agreed that much
more time was wasted by them
in bull sessions. etc.”

Of the 188 pledges question-
ed. 82 favor “Freshnian Rush
as it is now with suggested lim-
itations in our proposal,” Thir-
ty-nine of the 188 suggested. ‘a
delayed rush. (for example.
three weeks after school starts
and lasting for two. weeks).”’
Second semester rush is sup-
ported by 62. and Sophomore
Rush by four pledges out of the
188 questioned.

SUGGEST VISITS

The survey shows that “‘pledg-
es bgenerally feel that the only
parts of pledge training which
should be abolished are stud-
running and paddling.” It was
suggested that in its place, a
specific number of visits to a
brother be required of the
pledge during his training.

‘Pledges suggest that “each
fraternity should place an em-
phasis on scholastic and social
adjustment during the first
year of college.”

In answer to the question “Do
you believe that fraternities
have helped you adjust to col-
lege life?", cach of the 188
pledges questioned answered
affirmatively.

Pledges justified their an-
swers by mentioning the oppor-
tunity to make new friends, es-
pecially by meeting both fresh-
men and upperclassmen during
Rush Week. Pledges endorsed
required study halls and the

Finally. the survey results

creasing Davidson's endowment

to be given to charitable in-
stitutions.

WINSTON SALEM—Wake
Forest College student affairs
moved back into the public
spotlight again last week as the

¥®

Student Legislature unanim-
ously approved a proposal to
delete the school's drinking

clause from the honor system.

The proposal, subject to wide
attention when it was {first
brought up last month, was
abruptly passed after having
been tabled at the last meeting
of the Legislature two weeks
earlicr. The motion passed
without discussion. It was-wide-
ly covered in the state nows-
papers.

The deleted clause reads.
There shall be no drinking of
‘antoxicaling liquors on camp
us. nor shall. any student be
atlowed to keep liquor on thé
eampus. . .”

George Williamson, trcasurer
i of the student body and -origina-
tor of the bill, emphasized that
the deletion did not affect the
drinking rule as a “college”
rule, “This would not affect

ued. Lacy was. asked whether

ing rule.

Lacy: 1 can't see that. they:
have done anything about it. It
always seems to be in the stud-
ent’s hands.

Q: As a rule, what type of
sentence does the Honor
Court give out for various
drinking rule offenses?

Lacy: If a boy is caught with
alcohol on campus he is auto-
matically suspended. if a boy
is caught under the influence
on campus. he is usually camp-
used for a period of time.

Q: Have you received any
pressure from the faculty
about not suspending a hoy
for being under the influ-
ence?

Lacy No.

Q: When you say there
should be a change in the
drinking rule, do you mean
the whole rule or just the
“under the influence” clause?

Lacy: I was referring -to the
“under. the influence’ clause. T
would not like to see alcohol

stands it 1s sills and not enfore-
ed.

Q: Do you think. the David-
son students would vote for

ulty control? .

Rewrites

Student Constitution

__ Monday night, a Student Council committee began
its report.on a new constitution for the student body.
The Council began discussion of the proposed consti-
tution and is expected to continue the dicussion for the

next few weeks.

A four man committee, head-
ed by Hutton Barron, complete-

ly rewrote the Student Body
Constitution and introduced
several new ideas in their re-
written version.

The constitution, as reported
out of the committee, provides
for the creation of judiciary
board, made up of the four
class officers of the class of
the person on trial, which would
try all cases involving the
breaking of a student body reg-
ulation. Under this system the
Honor Court would try only
honor violations.

The proposed constitution
will also provide for a fresh-
man, elected by the Freshman
Council, to sit in on Council
meetings first semesters, and
to be a voting sixteenth mem-
ber of the Council second sem-
ester,

Another proposal is for an at-
tendance requirement for Coun-
cil members, which would force

a member to resign his office if.
he had missed a given number
of meetings.

The proposed. constitution al-
so greatly changes the concept
of by-laws. It proposes that by-
laws be changed by the Student
Council, without the presently
required two-thirds vote of the
entire Student Body. It also
places such matters as the Court
of Control in the by-laws.

Only one Student Body
Regulation is provided for in
the proposal, that being the
“gentlemanly conduct’ rule,
which the committee felt
could then be applied to such
matters as drinking, gamb-
ling, and hazing.

Student Body President Hen-

ry Shue said of this particular
provision. ‘We really are going
to have to think over the whole
matter of Student Body Regula-
tions, and have to get regula-
