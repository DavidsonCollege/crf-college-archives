Davidson | program destined for Africa

By SARAH TEACHWORTH
Staff Writer

Davidson’s array of study-
abroad programs will soon include
a summer program in Ghana at the
University of Cape Coast.

Dr. Nancy Fairley, Associate
Professor of Anthropology and the
Director of the West African Pro-
gram, has been working with other
devoted individuals for over a year
to institute the program.

“T.can’t tell you how excited I
am,” she says. She looks forward
to meeting with interested students
at an informational meeting this
Wednesday.

The program will run for six

The question remains: what will be the senior class gift of 1996? A new sign?

weeks — from the end of May
until the beginning of July.

Over that period of time, stu-
dents will take one academic class
entitled Contemporary Ghana four
days per week.

Each week, two afternoons
will be spent in either a music or a
dance class. Volunteer work, such
as tutoring in English or working
at a local women’s center will fill
up another afternoon.

To add to the Africa experi-
ence, students will not stay in dor-
mitories, but with families associ-
ated with the University.

They will also havea “buddy”
who matriculates at the University
of Ghana and can introduce them

to the ins and outs of their school
and community.

Weekend excursions will also
be an integral part of the program.
Each weekend, students will travel
to different regions of Ghana and
western Africa.

There are already two three-
day weekend excursions planned.
One will be to Cote D’ Ivoire (for-
merly known as the Ivory Coast)
and the other to Burkino Fasso.

Even though not all of the
details are decided at the moment,
15 students will probably be al-
lowed on the trip. Additionally,
three or four alums may go.

The trip is expected to take
place every other summer, but may

dents say he doesn’t even explain
rules about parties or subletting.

They say Knox seems “laid-
back” and “never complained”
even though a former resident ad-
mits that “we were not model ten-
ants.”

Two student renters believe
Knox knew that they had a cat
temporarily, and he didn’t charge
them the usual fee that was de-
tailed in the lease for keeping pets.

Most tenants say he was even
flexible about when they paid their
rent. One contends that his rent
only has to be paid “somewhat on
time.” Another remembers, that
Knox called him to remind him
about his overdue check, but Knox
didn’t seem angry.

Knox is punctual in fulfilling
his responsibilities as a landlord,
making sure the lawns around the
duplexes on Scherer Street are
mowed at least once a week (forno
extra charge), and even reseeding
and aerating lawns when needed.
Still, some have reported that Knox
is hard to get in touch with and
sometimes slow to respond to
phone calls.

Most tenants describe that
Knox is obviously committed to
the upkeep of his houses, and also

to upholding a friendly relation-
ship with his tenants. Knox states
that one of his priorities is “getting
along with folks.”

Many renters commented on
his personality, stating that Knox
is “soft- spoken,” “certainly nice,”
and a “personable guy.”

Tenants feel that he does not
take advantage of student renters.
As one explained, “I think he’s a
very fair, honest landlord, and he’s
someone you can deal with who
treats you as a person, not as a
college student.”

Renters say he even seems to
have an interest in Davidson, to be
“in touch with what’s going on on-
campus and who’s who.” Knox
knows a greaf deal about the Col-
lege, having grown upin Cornelius.
He says he can relate to students
because “I think about days when
I went to school and can reflect
upon my experiences.”

Students who have rented from
other Davidson landlords rate Knox
as far and away the best.

“Other landlords are so hor-
rible,” said one tenant. Another
described Knox as a “saint com-
pared to Marshall Case.”

Knox says, “I just enjoy the
students a lot.” Most tenants re-
port that they are satisfied with
their experiences, including their
relationship with him.

One student expressed enthu-
siastically, ““He’s absolutely the
best landlord.”

Forum

of Commissioners makes decisions
which affect the college, hence stu-
dents and government should de-
velop a “mutual interest” in each
other’s concerns.
At the forum, each candidate

be offered each summer if interest
is high.

The course is worth one
Davidson credit, and is expected to
cost about $3,200, which will in-
clude room and board, tuition, and
transportation both to and within
Africa,

Fairley and others have been
planning this program since the
summer of 1994.

Four faculty members, two ad-
ministrators, and four students went
onanexploratory trip through three
western African countries to see
where the best possible program
could be instituted.

They decided on Ghana. Since
then, they have been working on

finalizing the details of the pro-
gram. The program was approved
by the faculty at their October 3
meeting.

Students interested in the
Davidson Summer Program in
West Africa are encouraged to at-
tend the informational meeting this
Wednesday, October 25, at 4 p.m.
in the Conference Room of the
Union.

Trip organizers hope applica-
tions will be available by then. If
not, they will certainly be ready by
the end of October and can be
picked up at the Study Abroad
Office in Chambers.

Completed applications will
be due February 1.

Directories
finally arrive

"This happens every year,”
says Director of College Relations
Jerry Stockdale. At this same time
anually, students always call the
Union Desk for phone numbers
because they have not received
their own phone directories.

Every student should have re-
ceived his or her directory by the
end of this week, says Stockdale.
As usual, he describes, the delay

was due to the difficulty of collect-
ing all the information from the
various areas of the campus.

Stockdale explains that al-
though “we encounter unrest this
time of year” as students begin to
wonder if directories will ever ar-
rive, there is little that can be done
to speed the process.

“We could put the directory
out earlier, but it would be incom-
plete. We figure it’s better to have
a full and accurate one alittle later,”
Stockdale states.

will have one and a half minutes to

introduce himself or herself. Then
each candidate will be asked a dif-
ferent question, drawn randomly
from a predetermined list, and
given three minutes to respond.

After each.candidate answers
his or her question, the floor will
be opened to other candidates’ re-
sponses for five minutes. SGA
President Bill Gullan will moder-
ate, and Buford will be the time
keeper.

Sponsors who organized the
forum worry about its time restric-
tion. Williams stresses that since
each candidate is given only a lim-

ited time to speak, efforts must be
made to ensure fairness in allow-
ing each candidate to answer and
respond.

Buford is optimistic that all
will go “smoothly,” as candidates
have been receptive to the idea of
the forum. Of the 15 candidates
running, 12 will be present at the
function.

Organizers stress this is a first
step in bringing college and com-
munity closertogether. States Wil-
liams, “I hope the students get an
idea of the importance of partici-
pation [in government] ... and
make it their town.”
