‘ Delts Take Another,

The Davidsonian

~~ Win IMAC Softball

By BILL BERRY
Asst. Sports Editor.

The Phi Delts compiled |
three wins this week to cap-
ture the IMAC softball title
with an 11-1 record. The title

was their third in major
sports for the year. since
they had previously won

flickerball and tied [or the
basketball championship.

The Delts lost only to the
Sigma Nus, in an upset of
sorts in which the Delts play:
ed shorthanded. In this
week's game the Delts beat
the Phi Gamms 8-1, and the
ATO’s, 10-8 and took a for-
feit from the Kappa Sigs.

The ATO game was the
final victory over a challeng-
ing team and practically a
sured the Delts the title even
before Wednesday's forfeit by
the Sigs.

The Delt team has been
led by Dave Fearnback. He

Tracksters Wait
For Next Year

By A. W. TURNER JR.
Asst. Sports Eitdor

Baltimore Colt fans. die-
hard Boston Celtic foes, and
Davidson track coaches all
have one common thought
now: ‘wait ‘til next year.”

“I don't think it's being
overly optimistic to say that
we expect to be a stronger
team next year.’ said Wild-
cat track coach Heath Whit-
tle. “We were fairly pleased
with this year's team, even
though our 44 record was
only at the .500 level. We do
expect a better record next
season, though.”

Two of the main reasons
‘or such high hopes are re-
turning lettermen Ray Swet-
enburg and Rick Lyon. Swet:
enburg was this year’s win-
ner of the Fetzer . Award.
given annually to the team
member who displays excel-
Iénce in track. He won the
award primarily on his ac-
complishment of establishing
a new school record in the
triple jump. jumping 46°8".

Lyon was the top point
man this year, earning 8814
tallies.. He topped Swetenburg
for the honor by 20 points.

In their last two season
outings, the cindermen had
one disappointment and one
fine showing. In the state
meet, the Wildcats failed to

score.
However. Davidson's per-
formance in the Southern

Conference meet was a dif-
ferent story. Their fifth place
finish, ahead of VMI .and
Richmond, was the best in
four years.

In the long jump.
Rogers took fifth place. Ken
Hill got third in the 440, and
Swetenburg leaped to a sec:
ond in the triple jump.-Lyoa
raced to a third in the 100
and a fourth.in the 220. Tom
‘my Richardson placed fourth
in the 100 and fifth in the 200.
The only first place finish for
Davidson came in the 440
relay. where the team of
Whit Morrow, Richardson,
Lyon and Hill took the con-
ference crown. The Wildcats
scored a team total of 23
soints, well behind winner
William and Mary.

HEATH WHITTLE
. stronger next year

uation are light. Greg Cox.
the. team’s leading scorer
until. last year. is probably
the biggest Joss. Tony Ors-
bon. school record holder in
the high jump. hurdler
George Rogister. and java-
lin thrower Kerry Keith are

’ the other seniors.

Swetenburg is counted on
to take over for Rogister in
the .high hurdles. ‘We also
hope to develop someone in
the pole vault." comment-
ed assistant coach Sterling
Martin. “‘Basketballer Dong
Hill started working on the
vault late this year. If his
cage activities don't get in
the way. we hope he will
help us. ”

“John Puckett will be com-
ing back after spending his
junior year in Europe. He
will help us in the distance
runs, where we were weak
this season.”
Newman and Chris Sikes
were out. with injuries much
of last year. Sikes. who was
counted on to be a strong
distance man. is transferring
after this term.

The strength of this year's
team lay in the sprints, as
evidenced by the individual
performances in the confér-
ence meet. All members of
the winning 440 relay team
will be back next year to
defend their crown.

The only .winner in last
year’s meet. Lyon, was both
ered with a leg injury and
finished fourth in the 220.
the event he won in 1968.

has done an above average
job of pitching after switch-
ing from third base early
in the season, but his hitting
has really carried the Delts.
He was at his best in the
big games, particularly the
game with the Sigma Chis.
when he hit two home runs.

.The other top players for
the Delts were Hamp Whit-
tington and Nick Dumich in
the outfield. Both were out-
standing in the field and
steady at bat.

The Sig Eps won big games
over the Pikas and Sigma
Chis, before losing to the
Phi Gamms. In the Pika vic-
tory. 6-2, Bob Dunham was
the star, as he limited the
Pikas to six hits. The Pikas
did not score until the last
inning. Gary Sigmon went
three for three and Craig
Garner played an excellent
game at third base. - Joey
Saunders had an important
triple in the SPE‘s second
inning rally.

Against the Machis the SP
E’s scored two runs in the
bottom of the seventh to win.
8-7. Shep Johnson and John
Bruner drove in the tying.
and winning runs respective-
ly, and Bruner was the win-
ning pitcher.

The Gamms surprised the
SPE’s on Wednesday in extra
innings, 12-11, as Barry Mc
Lean drove in-two runs with
a single to left with two out.
The SPE's had scored two
runs in the top of the seventh
to tie the game.

The Pikas won two of three
Bames this week to finish 8-4.
Besides the SPE loss the
Pikas took a forfeit from the

Next &..Ul?

The schedules are a bit dif-
ficult to figure out.

Davidson's 1969 football
schedule lists an Oct. 18
game with William and Mary
to be played here.

William and Mary. op the
other hand, has an Oct. 18
game with Davidson, scedu)-
ed to be played in Winiams:-

Somewhere along the line
their was a mix-up in com
munications, but there is no
major problem, because the
game can be scheduled now

Wrong. Somewhere ‘along

Peace talks have begun,
but just in case, plan your
home~oming for South Hill.

losing season by taking it
out on some hapless females
this week-end.

Actually if isn’t as bad as
that. The matchup will be
with the Mary Baldwin tennis
team and will consist of a

‘series of exhibitions played

this afternoon. at 4:30 and

The Mary Baldwin netters
have won several national
women’s collegiate titles in
recent years and include sev-
eral of the top ranked female
players in their ranks.

Davidson tennis coach

the exhibitions are success-
ful, they may become an an-
nual. event. with the scene
switching from school to
school on regular basis.

Davidson's season was not
that successful, however, as

The losing record was the
first for Fogleman since lis
first campaign at the Wild-
cat helm in 1962.

The team wrapped up the
regular season last week-end
at the Southern Conference
tournament held in Charles-
ton. Souch Carolina.

The Wildcats stumbled
home in fourth place after
taking four straight Southern
titles under Fogleman.

Despite Fogleman's pessi-
mistic predictions about the
team’s chances in this year’s
tournament, six Davidson
singles and doubles advanced
past the first round.

second round where he was
joined by Rusty Lawrence,

ed last year by Davidson's
George Berner, a Richard-
son Scholar.

Fogleman was pleased by
the improvement of the
squad, particularly in the late
season in doubles play.

“The doubles came along
very well toward the last
part of the season. Early in
the year we lost a couple of
matches because of the
doubles, but ‘they did a fine
job toward the end of the
season.”

Brown, Brickels
Push Recruiting

By RUSS MERRITT
Sports Editor

Neither rain nor snow nor
professional basketball nor
a painful hernia nor a hesti-
tant selection committee has
kept Larry Brown from do-
ing his . job.

Brown, of course, is David-
son's new head basketball
coach, and his primary job,
“my most immediate con-
cern,’ is recruiting future
basketball players for the
Wildcats.

“Of course it hasn't been
easy,’ Brown, who prefers
to be called Larry, said. “By
starting so late we were
bound to be at a disadvant-
age in contacting and trying
to persuade high schoo! pros-
pects."’

Brown and his assistant,
Bo Brickels, have made no-
thing short of amazing pro-
gress, however, in overcom-
ing the many obstacles that
they faced.

The late departure of pre-
vious Wildcat coach Lefty
Driesell, the slow process of
haming Driesell’s successor,
and Brown's committments
to the. Oakland Oaks of the
American Basketball Asso-
ciation all hindered the
Davidson recruiting effort
greatly.

The late start has given
Brown and Brickels many
sleepless nights, and the
problem hasnt been help-
ed any by a hernia that
Brown developed in the ABA
championship game. ‘‘Sure,
it has been hard on us, but
we expected it. I think that
it'll be worth all the extra
work that we're doing now.”

Already Brown has sign-
ed one outstanding prospect,
