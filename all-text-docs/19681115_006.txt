Dates’ Housing: Scarce, But ‘Adequate’

By BILL LINEAWEAVER
Staff Writer

Although many students have to search high and
low to find a place where a date can stay for a weekend,
there is really no shortage of accommodations here,
according to Mrs. Peter Nicholls, director of student
housing.

There are over 300 possible places for dates
to stay in Davidson on a given weekend, Mrs. Nicholls
said. Some 213 spaces are actually filed with her of-
fice, but “many more are available if you hunt for
them.”

On dance weekends, more private lodgings be-
come available, although they are often crowded, Mrs.
Nicholls said, and on the three big weekends 609
spaces can be rented in Richardson and Belk dormi-
tories.

“The biggest problem in date housing is that of
sudden cancellation,” said Mrs. Nicholls. “Boys will
reserve rooms for their dates, then never show up
and never call to cancel the reservation. So, the room

What About

Area Exams?

These freshmen were asked the following
question: “Do you think area exams are fair?”’:

Rick. Michaels: ‘I think they're fair,
They will encourage students to work
on their own."

Gary Scribalt: “I'm not actively
supporting the area exams, I'm just.
accepting them.”

Jack Latiner: ‘‘Only time will tell
whether the area exams will achieve
what it is thought they will. Basically
I think they're fair. but I have doubts
about the achievement of the desired
results."

Howard Ramagli: ‘The theory be-
hind the area exams is good, but I
don't think they will prove to be
practical. They're too broad. The fac- t
ulty is trying to put four years of
courses into two years. The first
exams will either be too hard or too
easy. The freshman class this year
is just a guinea pig.”

is tied up with nobody in it.

“During big weekends, for example, there are
upwards of 50 reserved spaces in the dorms that are
either never used or cancelled at the last minute,” Mrs.
Nicholls said. . ;

Although there are a few motels near Davidson,
these are rarely used because, said Mrs. Nicholls,
“parents will usually flinch at the notion of their
daughter staying in a motel.” ;

Mrs. Nicholls mentioned several suggestions she
had heard that aim at making date housing easier to
find. Among these ideas were construction of a guest
house for dates and the establishment of a central
office through which reservations could be made.

She viewed both changes as unlikely—the first
because the college could not furnish enough spaces
to change the situation, and the second because many
of the townspeople perfer to handle their own reserva-
tions.

Several women who keep dates in their homes
and who are on Mrs. Nicholls’s list of available housing

thought that a shortage of date housing could be a
serious problem, especially on concert weekends when
the dorms are not available. Mrs. A. A. Wolf, the wife
of a Davidson physics professor, has room for five
girls but wound up housing eight during the last dance
weekend. “I had to turn down 30 to 40 besides the
eight I accepted,” she sai4.

Mrs. Wolf did not think that the college could
afford to construct facilities for housing dates, but
added, “Perhaps if the need were publicized more,
more townspeople would make spaces available.”

Mrs. F. T. Stough of Davidson can keep 10 girls,
but said that she, too, had had to turn many away.
“Unless there are a lot of unlisted housing spaces, I
don’t see where they go.”

Another Davidson townswoman, Mrs. Mabel
Broyles, who has space for six girls, said that she was
able to refer all her extra boarders to other places in
town. “Somehow they all got settled,” she said, “but
everyone who will keep a date should register with
Mrs, Nicholls.”

Richardson F ellows Finish
Initial Selection Process

Richardson Fellows today
completed the initial screen-
ing of 60 applicants for the
leadership program.

The process has already
completed its primary phase.
that of informing freshmen-
about the program, and is
now in the selection phase.

The fellows program, un-
der a grant of $20.000 from
the Smith Richardson Foun-
dation of Greensboro, seeks
to develop leadership quali-
ties, beginning in the fresh-
man year, through various
work and study projects.

Mike Mooty, director of the
program along with Dr. W.
G. McGavock, said that for
the past two weeks, two-
man teams of sophomore
fellows have interviewed all
applicants.

Mooty stressed that in
these interviews, the fellows
have sought to be absolutely
fair in trying to discover the
characteristics of each appli-
cant which would make his
experience in the program
profitable. .

Based on these interviews,
the fellows will evaluate
éach applicant, and the
group being considered will
be cut twice before the final
selections are made.

McGavock said that the
faculty advisory .ccommittee
to the program has the sole
responsipility of selecting

Better Suited Education

He noted new trends in the

the group.

Based on the evaluations
of the. sophomore fellows and
the recommendations of hail
counselors, faculty advisers
and some student leaders,
this faculty committee will
narrow the applicant group
to 40.

Individual members of this
faculty committee will con-
duct a second round of in-
terviews, and the group of
applicants will be cut to 20.

At this point the selection
process will become more
intensive and difficult. The
remaining applicants, Mc-
Gavock said. will go to Mon.
treat for a weekend early
next year for a final round
of interviews.

“The education network is
collapsing of its own Byzan-
tine weight,” Dr. Ralph
Beckmann said Tuesday in
a chapel speech which was
made voluntary because of
damage caused by the bad
weather.

Beckmann is one of five
members of the Institute for
Research and Design
(REDE) which has set up an
office in an old windmill in
Providence. R. 1. From the
windmill REDE hopes to
come up with new methods of
education better suited to
“these changing times," ac-
cording to Beckmann.

REDE is also attempting
to bring together the disci-
plines of ethics. science and

Wa; »

art to create new varieties of
architectural design, Beck-
mann said.

Beckmann recalled a
speech he heard while in
college by social critic Lewis
Mumford. Mumford _ pro-
nounced an ancient Chinese
curse on his audience: ‘‘“May
you live in interesting times.”

According to Beckmann,
we do.

Since he heard Mumford’s
speech Beckmann said there
have been many develop.
ments which have changed
our environment. These in-
clude communication discov.
eries that may make the
book obsolete, and the intro-
duction of the birth control
pill and its effects on con-
ventional standards of mor-
ality.

Judging from the response
of Rocky Crosswhite, Joe
Kearfott and Kerry Keith,
student members of the Com.
mission on _ Intercollegiate
Athletics, there will be no
major changes recommended
for Davidson's athletic
policy. Both Crosswhite and
Keith favored subsidized ath-
letics with Keith suggesting
that even the minor sports
be subsidized.

Kearfott indicated that he
,was “‘theoretically’’ cpposed
to subsidization, but that
“we're bigtime in basket-
ball" and that he favored
“going on and_ subsidizing
it.”

Only one of the three,
Crosswhite, mentioned the
possibility of going independ-
ent in all sports—that is,
non-affiliation with any con-
ference,

Both felt that most of the
students were estranged
frony the church because of
its formalized service and
its failure to speak to the
needs of the youth.

Brown and Norwood said
they hoped that the gap
could be breached by the use
of contemporary worship ser-
vices on campus. Norwood
attributed part of the present
student apathy toward the

church to the negative’ ap- ~

partment) takes to religion.

whether the school could fare
as well financially without

Shoplifting Rash

By PAUL ROWLAND
Statf Weiter

Someone's getting their
magazines, records, books
and pens at The Hub at a
tive finger discount, accord-
ing to proprietor Ralph
Quackenbush.

The total value of missing
goods has varied from zero
to $75 per week, depending
on the weather and who is
minding the store.

Quackenbush said a group
of young boys would come
into The Hub, divert the
cashier's attention and steal
what they wanted.

“I know the group and one
of them by name," he said,
“‘but we have to catch them:
suspicion is no good."

“It’s only when I'm not
here that they get anything,”
said Quackenbush, explain.
ing that with only one per.
son minding the store it was
difficult to keep an eye on
all the customers.

Cold weather presents the
most problems with shop-
lifting because of bulky jack.

ets which provide both war..
mth and cover for stolen
goods.

Mrs. Taylor Blackwell, one
of the owners of the Village
Store, reported that she has
always had problems with
shoplifting. She said her store
has changed the arrangement
of counters and stopped
carrying some merchandise
to alleviate losses by theft.

She said she had been able
to discourage most gang ef-
forts of the sort reported at
The Hub, but was plagued by
individuals who steal out of
need, meanness or habit.

The owner of the Western
Auto said he had no major
problems with shoplifting.
He said when a large group
of young boys come in ap.
parently to steal, ‘‘I just run
them out.”
