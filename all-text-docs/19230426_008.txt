On Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday
of next week the Wildcat baseball nine will
be put to the most severe test of the season
when they journey to the upper end-of the
season when they journey to the upper end
state to play three games with N. C.
State, Trinity, and Elon. The state cham-
pionship is going to be determined by the
results of this series, at least ‘as far as Dav-
idson is concerned. Davidson can win the
right to claim the championship by defeat-
ing State in Raleigh, and by outscoring
Trinity at Durham. Elon is out of the
running, not having won a game in the
State.

During the past week the Wildcats have
experienced their most successful week of
the campaign, downing Wofford twice, over-
whelming Elon on Saturday, and licking V.
P. I. Monday. ‘I'wo or three changes in the
line-up have strengthened the team fifty per
cent. Batting and fielding averages have
risen and the pitchers have reached mid-
season form.

To date, Trinity looks like a real cham-
pion. She has won every game played in
the State and has defeated all outsiders
except Auburn, losing to the Plainsmen by
a close score. Her team is well balanced
and the Wildcats will have a scrap to put
the Methodists out of the running.

RED AND BLACK NINE
EMB ON TOUR

State has a mighty fine team and it will
take good pitching and plenty of hitting to
win. However, Davidson lost the other
game on an unfortunate error and it is time
for the Wildcats to get the breaks, if any
breaks are needed to put over the next win.

Elon: has nothing save a good bunch of
swatsmiths, Capt. Pat’s crew fathomed their
pitchers in easy style last Saturday and can
do it again.

Summing up the dani on the five leading
teams, it looks like eee ranks first and

State, Carolina, Davidson, and Wake For-
est follow in the order named. State has
won every game but one but that, a defeat
by Carolina puts them in second place. Car-
olina has only won half of their games but
their victories over State and Davidson give
them third place. Wake Forest has lost to
both State and Trinity and cannot hold any
claims. ‘Trinity has beaten Carolina but
has not met State and with a victory over
the Techmen will only have Davidson as a
dark spot, provided our predictions mater-
ialize. Carolina will-have a good claim pro-
vided they defeat Trinity and State will

The company competition which was sche-

duled to take place two weeks ago is to be
held Wednesday, April 25. The teams
which were selected in the tryouts some
wecks ago will represent each company in
the different events. This competition be-
tween the companies is taking the place of
the Field Day previously Ble between the
different classes.

After a recess on the rifle range the reg-
ular firing will be started again this week.
Quite a number of men have already qual-
ified in the different positions and these will
be exempted from further firing. All other
men will be expected to take their assigned
work on the range.

The class work for the remainder of the
year will be devoted to the study of Scout-
ing and the Advance Guard, Examples will
be shown and problems presented at the
regular drill periods.

The Battalion will continue the same move-
ments for the rest of the year and on the
last Wednesday a Battalion parade will take
place, followed by the announcement of the
commissions for next year.

Delightful Three-Act Play

and forbade their children to communicate in
any way. They built a wall between the
two estates.

As young people will, they met every day,
and of course, fell desperately in love, but
were at a loss to find a way to secure the
consent of their parents to the match. The
old people, however, were not to be defeated.
They staged a fake abduction, and the lover
was allowed to rescue his loved:one from the
seeming kidnappers.” The young lovers dis-
covered the plot after it had been executed
and the young man left home seeking true
romance, thinking he had been made ridicu-
lous. He found to his sorrow that romance
eluded him and he returned a much chas-
tened man. His old love returned and the
young people were married and lived happily
ever after.

The moral of the play is that romance is
at home if it can only be found. It also
showed that love is to be had if only the op-
position of parents can be had.

Miss Meme Hampton was an extremely
sweet and lovable mistress. Her acting was
exceptional. She had some hard scenes to
perform but always came through in fine
style. She was probably the star of the
evening. Miss Cornelia Wearn made a very
handsome and ardent lover. His, or her,
sword play was excellent. Miss Beulal)
Holmes also has a difficult part and came
through without a falter.

The play as a whole was exceptionally
good. ‘Ihe whole cast went through the
entire performance without a hitch, and
the audience thoroughly enjoyed every act.

Misses Stone, King and McClure who
managed the play, deserve a great deal of
credit for the manner in which it was stag-
ed: These ladies have spent a great deal of
their time directing and coaching the char-
acters and merit much of the audience’s ap-
preciation for the manner in which the act-
resses interpreted their parts.
