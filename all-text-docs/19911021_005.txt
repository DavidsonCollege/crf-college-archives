SERCH Fosters
Multiculturalism In Davidson

By Casey Otis

The Davidson community has
a new addition, Students for the
Establishment of Racial and Cul-
tural Harmony, or SERCH. The
group was founded by Anthony
Foxx, a junior from Charlotte.

SERCH grew from informal
discussions Foxx and others had
on racial and cultural frustrations.
Foxx, May Martin, and Mary
Mount Faith have spearheaded the
group. They have enlisted the help
of approximately twenty five other
students to raise specific black and
white issues at formal group dis-
cussions. Foxx said these discus-
sions have “worked out well, and
have shown there is ademand fora
group like this at Davidson.”

As the only black person on his
freshman hall, Foxx discovered
that racial issues were difficult to
talk about. Because there was no

place where these issues were
raised and understood, the idea of

having a group devoted to racial

and cultural differences was born.

Between his freshman and
sophomore years, Foxx attended a
black leadership conference..-At
the conference he was introduced
to the idea ‘of multiculturalism.
SERCH is largely based on this
theory. SERCH has grown into an
organization which confronts prob-
lems of diversity and attempts to
understand different viewpoints on
racial and cultural issues.

SERCH is not a political or-
ganization. Anthony Foxx calls
the group “amoebic”, and he says
the purpose of the group is to “meet
people at their level, and through
dialogue, better understand each
other.”

SERCH has the support from
all sectors of the Davidson com-

munity, including President
Kuykendall, the Dean of Students
office, the College Union, Patter-
son Court, Athletes, and SGA.
Foxx calls the concept of SERCH
“very radical, because blunt ques-
tions of race are not usually asked,
certainly not on this campus.
People have not been confronted
in such a personal level. Even if
people sit in on a SERCH discus-
sion they will learn something
about themselves.”

The group has already met five
times and has had one guest
speaker, Ismail Conway. Mr.
Conway is the director of student
activities at Cornell and an advo-
cate of multiculturalism. The group
plans to:-meet on October 30, to
discuss racial divisions in religion.
The meeting is open toall students.

Homeless Man Lectures at Cal St.

By Karen Neustadt
(CPS) -- When Len Doucette be-
came homeless, he got angry. He
wanted others to understand the
humiliation, the hopelessness, the
loss of self-esteem. So he began
teaching a class about his situ-
ation. :

“TI want to get my students as
angry as I am about the conditions
-- angry enough to do something
about it,” Doucette said. “The
problem starts with misconceptions
about the homeless.”

. When he. first offered the
course “Homelessness and Public
Policy” through California State
University at Bakersfield, only a
dozen students showed up. That
has changed.

His lectures -- peppered with
anecdotes of welfare agencies,
unemploymentlines, street life and
experiences in overnight shelters -
- are not easy to listen to. Some
students dropped the course after
the first lecture.

“The students who do stay in,
however, are very motivated and
concemed with the problem,” says
Jaci Ward, a program coordinator
for the college. “Mr. Doucette
puts his ego aside and discusses
the problem objectively. He’s able

to depersonalize it.” :

Doucette first became home-
less four years ago when he was in
an accident that cost him his low-
paying office job. He lived in San
Francisco, working part-time jobs
that did not cover the rent.. He is
now temporarily living with a
friend because he can’t.afford rent
on his part-time instructor’s pay.

The outspoken Doucette, who
says he does not allow himself to
become discouraged, compares the
current wave of homeless persons
with the Depression of the ‘30’s.
“Except that now these people are
single. The: dissolution of the
family is acontributor to this prob-
lem.”

Doucette tells students that
while the homeless issue is getting
press coverage for the first time,
the majority of the problem is
hidden. “These people lookk just
like you or me. But they are living
with friends, or family -- or in
cars.”

The class, designed by
Doucette, features local speakers
such as members of Congress and
social agency Officials. Then stu-
dents are required to take part in
five learning experiences and write
a paper, expressing thoughts and

~ feelings about each.

tions include the following: (1) Go

If you think drugs cost a lot
now, wait until after college.
They could cost you a career.

Last year alone, America’s

s
businesses lost more than $60
billion to drugs. So this year,
most of the Fortune 500 will be
administering drug tests.

Failing the test means you won't
be considered for employment.

And that's one hell of a price
to pay.
