Alcohol? .

(Ed's. Note: The following $a statement by
Coach Carl Snavely of the University of North
Carolina. This selection appeared in the Noven:-
ber issue of “The Allied Youth” and is reprinted
here in its entirety.)

1 have dong no original researeh «6 the
effects of alcohol, and aw not welling im the
capacity uf an expert, PE have ne new argue
ments against it, Perhaps U know less Abou
it because — hate the tnste of-the stuff and
have never had any diffientty in declinine ,
to drink: it.

However

a _tleserve no commendation for

way 0 of superior seruptes. or Hleterminaion:
or common sense. Ever if Yliked it, bad bea.
fool to drink it—and for pufely selfish

reasons. It requires no masterminding or ad-
vanced study to reach a souind conclusion on
that point.

My observations on the subject have been
those of the average vitizen. and thaw is
enough. 1 have noticed that when the execu-
tives of railroads and big industries are in
search of men to fill iinpertant and respan- °
sible jobs, they do net go to salvons and bar-
rooms to look for them. | had an experience ”
once which taught ime that even saloon-
keepérs try hard to get bartenders who are
not drinking men. _

1 have never known of any graduate,
who, in seeking position with bankers. mer
chants, and leaders of industry, seience:

eby acquiring an inflammable alcoholic breath.
ov a nice sociable jag. No bov has ever asked
me to inention in a letter oft ecommendation —
sthat he was a first-rate drmker.-

_ And’] have observed the usual nmuber of
“sad catastrophes which end the useful careers
‘uf, talented beys and virls who start out with
the most -favorable advantages and with
promises of success. and—happiness._These_
tragic cases resulting from drinking should
serve as adequate warning to their former
friends and to the youngsters coming after.

There are a number of thing about drink-
ing which I've never been able to under-
stand, but the greatest mystery is why. when
there are so many oud things to drink. any
of our boys and vitls are ever crazy enough
to tamper with liquor.

A moment's reflection will show that the
desire to gain.distinetion throneh such an
outlet as is offered. by alcoholic beveraves
is nothing but the badge of the worst im-
feriority. Anyone who-wants to drink ean
drink. It neither indicates nov requires any
quality of strength, skill. britins. courage or
superiority.

Most all youny people. of course, know
the dangers and harm of alcohol. Ht seems
to be. a waste of time to dwell upon them.
Instead, let me make certain ubservations.
about athletics and clean living. :

Good condition of of the physical. mental,
and nervous systems is one of the pre-
requisites for suceessful play in both in-

—~ dividual and team performance-Often -young—|

people do not realize that many of the errot

which seem to result entirely from lack o

skill, of accuracy, or of coordination, are
really the result of fatigue and lack of
stamina. In fact, these errors are usually the
first symptoms of fatigue. Nervous reactions
are more seriously affected by lack of good
training habits than the wind or muscles,

clean habits. ;

It is my opinion that to keep special train-
ing or.the season only is futile. For a boy to
give up cigarettes ov drinking just for a
period of competition results in an unfavor-
able nervous reaction which is about as harni-
ful as the continued use of these things would
be. To he at normal efficiency, a boy must
avoid such handicaps at least until nis ath-
letie career is ended, He must observe the
rules of wood, health and wholesome living
the entire year.

Personally, Lam not interested in any boy
whose aimbitien and pride in his play are
not sufficient to impel him to train the year
round. There is vo place on nty team for a
player, even.if he is a star, Who trifles with
training rules, or who feels that he can trait
for three months and spend the other nine
dissipating and weakening himself.

Finally. the most important element in
successful athletics, whether in college.or in
high-school. is teanr spirit and morale. The
bors on the squad: must realize that in the
interest of mndrale alone, nothing less than
thei Dest “ise i :
tious and lovaleadherence to a strict and cou:
tinous program of good habits and sound
training activities, and in such a program
there is no place for alcoholic beverages in
any form or quantity, Fortunately there are
lots of things to drink which are tastier and
which are also beneficial.

The program of Allied Youth is not one of
narrow repression and self-denial. but of full
living and wholesome fun and happiness. Lt
stands for fun without regrets—the kind-of
fun that leads to greater enjoyment, as con-
trasted to artificial, imaginary, and super-
ficial pleasure which leads to nothing but
bitter disappointment.

Dear Editor: IT am very.sorry to hear
that ‘there is some possibility of the YMCA
wift fund falling short of its $5.000 goal this
Meav. Since this is one of the many Tino
Davidson, traditions, dt is very nnfortunatd
[that it is not being supported 100 per cent
by the student body.

There is no doubt_that the “Y” govern-
ing board has selected a worthy cause this
Christmas. possibly the most worthy of all
the causes considered; however. since there
Seems to be bnore than a little dissatisfaction

1 suggest that the ‘‘Y*" choose two or
:three worthy projects that they consider in
“the greatest need ;
to vote on one, by secret ballot (if the “Y"’

still wants. a scoop story in THE DAVID-,

SONIAN.) {

Of course, even with such a democratic
method as this, it will be impossible to please
everyone; but possibly there will be greater
participation in the giving, if greater par-

_ticipation in the selection is allowed.
