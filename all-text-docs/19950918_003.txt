WALT-zing nearer to student radio

By Mec WoLFF
Staff Writer

Student-run college radio at
Davidson came one step closer to
being areality last week as WALT
held its first organizational meet-
ing on Monday night.

Davidson College has not had
a student run radio station since a
few attempts failed in the 1980s.
WDAYV, Davidson’s current radio
station, was originally student run,
but was removed from student con-
trol because of improper manage-
ment and failure to follow regula-
tions.

In the fall of 1992, student
interest in college radio was re-
vived, but the plan to form a station
was stonewalled until Spring 1994.

Last spring, 30 students peti-
tioned the Activities Tax Council

Buchanan Cup marks the highest undergrad honor

By Russ TARVER
Associate Editor

Ata biennial national confer-
ence held at Disney World last
August, acommittee presented the
Epsilon chapter ‘of the Sigma Phi
Epsilon fraternity with the
Buchanan Cup, the highest award
given to an undergraduate chapter.

Named in honor of past Grand
President and Treasurer Edwin
Buchanan, the award is given to 30
of the 275 chapters of the frater-

nity. The last time Davidson’s
chapter earned the award was in
1975.

In awarding the cup the na-
tional fraternity said, “While acon-
sistent, quality, performing chap-
ter for many years, this chapter has
recently performed at a level far
above its competitors.

“The chapter’s grade point av-
erage is nearly three-tenths of a
point above the all-student aver-
age, ranking the chapter first aca-
demically with a 3.3. The chapter

is first among seven fraternities in
manpower with 93 men.”
Sophomores Alan Staggers

and Ian Buchanan traveled to
Florida to receive the award.

Chapter President Matt
Griffith says, “Given the hard work
that we’ ve put in over the past few
years, we were all very honored
and very pleased.”

Senior member Bill Buff says,
“I wish we had drunk more and
studied less, but now we have a big
cup to drink out of.” ,

(ATC) and the Union for funding.
WALT received more funding than
expected from the ATC and also
received a one-time only start-up
grant of $2000 from the Union.

Churchill Hooff, WALT’ sta-
tion manager, sees WALT as serv -
ing several functions: “Obviously,
we want to provide music, but we
also want to be analternative source
of news andentertainment. This is
really a great opportunity for any-
one who has ever wanted to be
involved with broadcast radio.”

Hooff hopes that WALT: will
be a source of information particu-
larly relevant to the Davidson com-
munity.

He says, “Our name, WALT,
implies alternative, but that does
not necessarily mean that all we
will play is ‘alternative music.’
We want to be an alternative to

other stations, playing what stu-
dents want to hear and telling stu-
dents the things that are going on at
Davidson.”

WALT isencouraging student
participation in every aspect of the
station, from being a DJ to the
technical aspect.__Right. now,
WALT is especially interested in
fundraising and establishing con-
tact-people for news articles.

WALT hopes to begin broad-
casting sometime in mid-October
on 1510 AM, once the antenna for
the station is raised atop Belk.
Meanwhile, WALT will continue
to have informational meetings on
Mondays at 9 p.m. in the Union.

Will Foy, the station program
director, is excited by the prospect
of WALT. He says, “We're inter-
ested in being on the air, staying on
the air, and doing it right this time.”

scenes. His work in the Panthers’
locker room is involved, but well
worth it. Because ‘the Panthers’
home stadium in Charlotte is cur-
rently under construction, Smith
drives 140 miles to Clemson’s
Memorial Stadium, where the Pan-

thers will play their home games
throughout 1995. The night before
game day, x-ray machinery is set
up, helmets are cleaned, and lock-
ers are organized.

On game day, once the Pan-
thers have stepped onto the play-
ing field, Smith and others trans-
form the locker room into half-
time mode, setting up projectors
and other necessary equipment.
During the game’s final half, the

locker room must be prepared for
the post game activities.

Though no longer on the field,
Smith still finds himself working
in the midst of the action; the locker
room is not immune to the tension
and pressure present on the field.
His work puts him “very close to
the players” who, despite the pres-
sure they face, Smith says, “are
always professional and polite.”

Smith appreciates this contact

with the human aspect of the game,
and says that he owes a lot to Dan
Morphis, Equipment Manager at
Davidson, who offered encourage-
ment and advice as Smith began
his involvement with the Panthers.

Morphis, whohas worked with
the San Diego Chargers and the
Washington Redskins at summer
training camps in the past, also
works inthe Panthers’ lockerroom
with Smith. Morphis explains that

the job of those responsible for
locker room preparation is to “keep
things running smoothly” and to
do “whatever it takes to win.”
Looking toward the future,
Smith predicts that the Panthers

are headed for great success and

says he feels “awfully lucky” to be
a part of the effort. Even now,
Smith says, “I’m pinching myself.
I’ve been waiting for the Panthers
to come here for 40 years.”
