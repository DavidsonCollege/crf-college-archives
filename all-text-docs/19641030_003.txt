Balance Sheet - - Politics 196

SPACE PROGRAM

GOLDWATER

Criticizes t h e United
States “obsession” with the
moon-shot program. Makes
a distinction between space
exploration and the devel-
opment of military uses of
space saying the adminis-
tration is emphasizing the
former to the grave detri-
ment of the latter. Also,
distinguishes between the
“near space” military po-
tential and “outer space”
exploration possibility, say-
ing that the Soviet three.
man Satellite demonstrated
Soviet. superiority in “near
space” which _ threatens
United States national secu-
rity.

JOHNSON

Calls the United States
space program, including
the moon shot, absolutely
essential to scientific and
military advancement, As
Vice-President, was given
substantial authority over
the direction and develop-
ment of the United States
Space program. Has sought
to explore the possible
areas of peaceful interna-
tional cooperation in outer
space. Encourages the de-
velopment of defense po-
tentiaal in “spy” satellites
and recently announced
antisattellite missiles.

.

CIVIL RIGHTS

GOLDWATER

Is outspoken against dis-
crimination and urges re-
medies on local and state
levels. Voted against the
Civil Rights Act of 1964 de-
nouncing the public accom-
modations and fair-employ-
ment - practices titles as
unconstitutional and requir-
ing a “police state” for en-
forcement. Says that “forc-
ed integration is just as
wrong as forced segrega-
tion.”’ Opposes busing school
children to achieve racial
balance in -a local school
system. Says it is “wrong—
morally wrong.”

JOHNSON

Urged the passage of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964
“because justice demands
it.” Says the ‘act does not
give “special treatment” to
any citizen but it assures
all men shall be treated
equally in the “polling
booths, in the classrooms,
in the factories, and in ho-
tels and restaurants and
movie theaters,’’ and oth-
er places providing public
services. Emphasizes that
the act relies for compli-
ance on local. communities
and states first, and only
after failing this would fed-
eral authority be called on.-

WoW

MEDICARE

GOLDWATER

Opposes medical care for
the aged if financed through
social security. Says medi-
care would mean socia-
lized medicine
and would be likely
to “wreck” and “bankrupt”
the social-security system.
Favors a “tax credit or a tax
deduction for any monies
paid for the purpose of tak-
ing care of the aged.” He
originally opposed the Kerr-
Mills private health care

rogram and now says this
is as far as the government
should go. Urges “improve-
ments” in this social secu-

rity system.

JOHNSON

Has called upon Congress
to enact legislation to pro-
vide medical care for the
aged financed through so-
cial security. Says that in a
prosperous and free country
like the United States no
one need suffer “personal
economic disaster and be-
come a tragic burden up-
on loved ones or the state”
through illness. Says medi-
care would be no cost to
the Treasury since the gov-
ernment would set aside
employees’ and employers’
contributions during the
employees’ working careers.

THE DAVIDSONIAN

The following are excerpts from the Oct. 20, 1964, issue
of “The Christian Science Monitor.”

DEFENSE

SOUTH VIET NAM

GOLDWATER

Says United States policy
in Vietnam has proved “in-
adequate,” amounting, in
effect, to no policy at all.
Urges shutting off the sup-
plies of the Communist
invaders by “threaatening
or actually interdicting the
supply routes from Red
China, Laos, and Cambo-
dia.” Suggests that “per-
haps the threat alone would
work.” Supported. the firm
action in the President’s
response to the attack in
the Gulf of Tonkin, but
says it was just an isolated
action, not the ‘new, win-
ning strategy” that is
needed.

JOHNSON

Says the United States
“seeks no wider war” in
Vietnam. Called the United
States military reaction to
the North Vietnam attack
in the Gulf of Tonkin “limit-
ed and fitting.” Says the
United States “intends no
rashness.” Stresses Ameri-
can role in South Vietnam
as being advisory, in ful-
fillment of American pro-
mises ‘and commitments.
Views the out-come of the
struggle in Vietnam as af-
fecting all of Southeast Asia.
Says Vietnam policy proves
the United States will
“stand firm in the defense
of freedom.”

FARM POLICY

GOLDWATER
yeuoneperegoucpeuegon
tion’s farm program as
“bureaucratic meddling” in
private affairs and refers
to farm subsidies as an at-
tempt by government to
“continue dipping into one
of your pockets to put mon
ey into the other.” Would
replace what he calls “ar-
bitrary handouts” of farm
subsidies with the “healthy
and fair forces of flourish-
ing and expanding mar-
kets.” But says that govern-
ment will have to hel
farmers through the transi-
tion period, since farmers
have been led to expect
assistance.

JOHNSON

Points to the wheat-cot-
ton legislation as “insur.
ance." Lists administration
farm goals as: strengthen-
ing farm income; reducing
cost of farm programs to
taxpayers; making surplus
stocks reach the require-
ment level; and exploring
better uses of surplus food
and fiber. Calls for com-
modity programs which
“protect and preserve our
family farm system.”

GOLDWATER

Says that United States
defense policies ‘‘add up, in.
effect, to unilateral dis-
armament.” Discounts as a
“public relations gimmick,”
the administration’s claims
of “new weapon systems.”
adding that there has not
been introduced into the
United States weapons sys-
tem ‘one new strategic
system in the last four
years.” Suggested entrust-
ing the NATO commander
in Europe with authority
to order the combat use of
“relatively low - yield” tac-
tical nuclear weapons —
which he terms “convent-
ional”—under certain cir-
cumstances. Charges the
Secretary of Defense with
“mistake after mistake” in
evaluating Communist in-
tentions in economizing the
defense establishment, and
in “attempts to downgrade
professional military men.”

JOHNSON

Says that the United
States today is stronger than
the “combined might of all
the nations'in the history
of the world” and predicts
its strength will grow faster
than all others. However,
urges that every effort be
made toward achieving
world disarmament and ex-
tending the limited nuclear-
test - ban treaty to include
Communist China. Has
pointed to “new and high
ly advanced weapons sys-
tems” which have been ‘com-
pleted under the Kennedy-
Johnson - administration,,
such as Redeye, Shillelagh,
and Walleye. Announced
the development of a ‘‘maj-
or new strategic manned
aircraft system,” the RS
70. ‘Stresses that control
over nuclear weapons must
remain in the hands of the
president “‘in all foreseeable
circumstances.”

THE ECONOMY

GOLDWATER

Says the budget should
be balanced but would not
set an arbitrary time per-
iod to accomplish _ this.
Would reduce _ federal
spending in such areas as
urban renewal and welfare

P services, but would increase

spending in the areas of de-
fense and national security.
Says it is possible to reduce
the national debt. Has call-
ed for a regular reduction
of personal income taxes
and corporate taxes, 5 per-
cent a year, over the next 5
years beginning at the ear-
liest possible date. Has cri-
ticized the graduated in-
come tax as unfair. Says if

‘government spending con-

tinues at the present rate,
“we will have to adopt a
form of United States so-
cialism.” Voted against the
administration’s tax cut call-
ing it a temporary, election-
time, political gimmick.

JOHNSON

Says a “balanced budget
in a full-employment, full-
prosperity economy” is the
goal. Says he wants to end
government waste and keep
federal employment ata
minimum, but says this also
is to “release funds to meet
new challenges and oppor-
tunities." Rejects the
“standstill budget” which
turns itsbackon “new
needs.” Cites the tax cut
as a long-range stimulus for
the economy in helping to
close the “gap” between
present national economic
production and actual capa-
city and in providing jobs
which can be created “by
allowing our people to
spend and invest u great-
er part of the money they
earn.” Pointed to September
as the “3rd month of the
greatest peacetime pros-
erity” in United States
istory.

4} Midwest Poll Compiles
College Political Opinion

PAGE THREE

Incumbent President Lyndon B. Johnson won a landslide victory over Senator
Barry Goldwater in a nationwide poll conducted by. the Drury College Mirror of over
one hundred college and university campus editors and newspapers.

Survey results showed 79 per
cent of the editors supported
Lyndon Johnson and 17 per
cent s rted Baryy Gold:
water. Of the school newspap-
ers, 60 per cent took no stand,
37 per cent gave the nod to
Johnson and 3 per cent chose
Goldwater. The resulting ratio
for the Johnson-Humphrey
team was more than 81 over
the Goldwater-Miller team.

This collegiate editorial op-
inion survey was sent to 250
colleges and universities across
the nation, of which 105. schools
responded.

Civil Rights and big govern-
ment. were named as the two
most contested issues. Foreign
policy ranked in ‘third place.
followed by federal spending,
communism and defense, More
church supported schools scem-
ed to sec the personal ethies
of the candidates as an impor-
tant, issue.

One big question was the ex-
tent. of. «the “backlash and/or
“fronilash’’» réactions , editors

saw in their areas. Col-
leges and universities in the
West, Midwest and Northeast
reported a “moderate to strong”
frontlash. Southern schools
showed an almost even division
between the defectors from
either side. Private schools
stressed the frontlash strong-
est and large state schools re-
ported neither frontlash nor
backlash to be very prevalent.

Several editors added addi-
tional comments to the survey.
The Ohio Wesleyan Transcript
reported a mock election. gave
a landslide to Johnson Humph-
rey. The editor commented
that these results were “little
short of astonishing,” since
Ohio, Wesleyan had been “a
conservative, Republican strong-
hold” for years.

The survey  reveated five
major trends in cditorial think
fing, here quoted from the
Drury Mirror.

First, “Goldwater's Semitic
background .has- had no bear-
ing in the campaign on Ameri-:

‘can catnpuses.”

Second, a moderate but
persistent. ‘frontlash’ has de-
finitely appeared which over-
shadows the ‘backlash’ in most
parts of the country.”

Third, “the backlash” does
not seem to be a truly powerful
force on southern campuses.”

Fourth, -civil rights, rather
than the traditional issue of
big vs. small government, seems
to be the main problem of the
election on the college campus.

Lastly, there Is the over-
whelming popular support giv-
en to Lyndon Johnson by col-
lege newspaper editors, and a
similar trend among the stud-
ent bodies which these editors
represent.

Results of the Drury Mirror
survey were compiled and tal-
lied by the Statistican Research
Foundation. The arlicle about
the poll in the Drury Mirror
gave special mention to David.
Son as representing one. of
the few colleges in, which Sena-
{or Barry Goldwater defeated
Presittent Lyndon Johnson.

Democratic Tidal Waves
To Swamp Goldwater Raft

By MICHAEL L. HARRINGTON

All polls and pollsters are agreed on one point: incumbent

Davidsonian Managing Editor.

President Lyndon

Baines Johnson will defeat Senator Barry Morris Goldwater in a victory of land-
slide proportions. Uniess the most momumental hoax of our times has been perpe-
tuated, Goldwater has absolutely no chance of winning this election, barring some.

unexpected disaster.

President Johnson is said
to have obtained a copy of the
latest secret Republican polls,
taken just last week and shown
to both Goldwater and Miller.
This poll is said to have shown
that the Goldwater-Miller team
could. hope to carry only seven
states at best. :

question is how much? The sec-

of carrying Wyoming,

The Walter Jenkins affair
seems to have dented only
slightly the Democratic tidal
wave. The surprising result of
the latest polls fs, that instead
of showing a slight swing of
votes to the underdog at the
last minute, most of them are
pointing to a widening margin
for the cufrent front runner.

Johnson-Humphrey will take
60 per cent ofthe popular vote
and will carry 44 states with
489 clectora! votes. Goldwater
Miller will get about 40 percent
of the popular vote and will car-
ry only 7 states with 49 elec-
toral votes.
