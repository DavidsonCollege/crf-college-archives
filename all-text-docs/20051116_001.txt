Students struggle with coming out

By SAM HOTCHKISS
Guest Writer

For Davidson students who have
not questioned, are not question-
ing, and will never question their
sexual orientation, it’s hard to
know what it must be like for
someone who does.

While many students are com-
fortable with their own sexual
identity, others—peers, classmates,
best friends, roommates—quietly
struggle with coming to terms with
their own.

“Coming out is so hard because
you don’t want to be labeled by
your sexual orientation. You
wouldn’t want people to change
their attitude towards you because
of it,” said “Pebbles” ’08, a female

Here (YANASH), a campus sup-
port group.

Many students struggling with
coming out wonder about how dif-
ferent people would react.

For instance, many might be
scared of how their friends would
react to knowledge of their sexual
orientation, especially if their
group of friends nonchalantly
throws around derogatory homo-
sexual words like “queer” and
“fag.”

Many who come from a reli-
gious background might wonder
how being gay would tie in with
their religious beliefs. Probably the
biggest fear of many is the reaction
of their parents.

For the past couple of years,

Sami Jarrah ’07, studying abroad
in Jordan this semester, witnessed
the aftermath of terrorism on a
scale previously unseen in the Arab
country. He passed near the hotels
minutes after the bombings in
Amman, the capital city, last
Wednesday night.

“You could hear sirens all over,”
he wrote via email.

Three Iraqi suicide bombers,
members of Jordanian terrorist Abu
Musab Zarqawi’s al-Qaeda ‘net-
work in Iraq, blew themselves up

Davidson has been providing sup-
port for these students through
YANASH, a group solely for stu-
dents who identify as gay, lesbian,
bisexual, transgender, or question-
ing (GLBTQ).

Although the group appreciates
support from straight allies, the
group prefers to remain solely for
students who are GLBTQ, fulfill-
ing a different purpose than the
Gay-Straight Alliance (GSA).
~ At every meeting, someone dif-
ferent is asked to lead the discus-
sion.

At recent meetings, which are
held every other week, the group
talked about homosexuality and
how it is portrayed in the media,

Bombings in Jordan affect students abroad

in a simultaneous attack on hotels
frequented by Westerners, killing
over 50 people and wounding 150
more.

Jarrah drove by the smallest of
the three hotels, Days Inn, in a taxi
‘before Jordanian authorities shut
down the capital’s main roads and
brought the entire city to a stand-
still.

Jarrah wrote, “I was on my way
home at 9 p.m. when the explo-
sions were happening. The taxi I
was in passed the Days Inn hotel
just after the explosion but before

CCRL approves
black sorority

By Lex! HAMILTON
Senior Staff Writer

The Council on Campus and
Religious Life (CCRL), an adviso-
ry committee to the president,
voted 17-2 yesterday in support of
bringing a historically black soror-
ity to Davidson College.

Sorority organizers Whitney
White ’08, Charisma Looney ’08,
and Ashley Moore ’07 gave a pres-
entation to the CCRL explaining
the organization’s mission and then
fielded questions from students and
faculty.

“We see a need at Davidson,”
White said, “and this sorority can
fill that need by giving women of
color a place to become leaders,
serve the community, and integrate
into Patterson Court.”

Currently, seven black women
are members in _ traditional
Patterson Court eating houses.
Two more plan to join eating hous-
es in the spring semester.

Although approximately 70 per-
cent of female students join eating

houses, less than one percent of -

these women are minorities.

The organizers of the sorority
presented a timeline that outlined
their process, which began in 2004.
They have since collected 600 sig-
natures from students of all ethnic
backgrounds who support their
endeavor.

The group also sponsored a cam-

pus-wide information session in
order to increase awareness about
black sororities and their tradition-
al differences from historically
white sororities.

“That was perhaps the most dif-
ficult part of this process,” organiz-
er Alice Frimpong ’08 said. “Many
individuals are misinformed about
black sororities.”

Black sororities, which are gov-
erned by the National Pan-Hellenic
Council, have no rush process.
Because members are selected by
the national organization alone, no
member of the sorority has any
influence over who may apply for
membership.

During the discussion panel that
followed the presentation, some
CCRL members raised concerns
that the addition of a black sorority
to the Patterson Court community
would further isolate minorities.

“We feel that this type of sorori-
ty will engage the women of color
on a different level,” Moore said.
“They will be required to partici-
pate with other Patterson Court
organizations through co-spon-
sored events, like those Alpha Phi
Alpha currently sponsors with the
eating houses.”

Patterson Court advisor Joy
Hamm also emphasized that the
proposed sorority would increase
rather than decrease diversity on
