‘1970-71 Was A Very Good Year’

AN ANALYSIS
By RICH WILSON
Managing Editor

It was a very good year.

The faculty was mad, the
students were mad, the ad-
ministration was mad, and
ihe trustees were miad.

It was @ very good year.

The focus for all the chang-
es that oecurred this year
must be directed toward the
college administration. Dur-
ing this year we have seen
a shuffle of ‘administrative
jobs which produced an ad-
ministration eager and able
to move this college in an
innovative fashion.

The administration ha s
managed to reduce faculty
power (which previously
reigned supreme over this in
stitution) tnd ai the same
time encourage student par-
ticipation in certalin decision
miaking areas.

Vice. President for Aca-
demic Affairs John M. Be-
van was ithe first top admin-
istration” to “move in and
take charge. A vibrant man
with jimtense passions and
very firm beliefs, Bevan
quickly consohidated his pow-
er and began to rumble for-
ward. ‘

The faculty, grown aécus-
tomed ito tthe slow and quiet
mianner of Frontiis W. John-
ston, was not prepared to
meet ithe onslaught of (Bevan.
They were quickly overcome
by la miass of academic leg-
islation.

Extended Studies  trans-
formed the stagnant .and “un-
successful area exams pro-
gram into original experi-
menial programs with op-
‘tions in seminiars, schoolwide
programs, individual and
group projects both on and
off campus.

The Honors College began
openation this year as well.
Although this program ha's
proved a challenge to the
participating students, it has
become estranged from tthe
rest of the college, with the
majority of ithe  studenits
viewing it as an elite organ-
ization.

ther academic innova-
tions were also instituted.
Davidson introduced ia South
Asian program; an lart mia-

» jor was established and the

academic regulations were
revised. at
And tn a mecent develop-

ment, Bevan succeéssfuly en- —

gineered “he shift im empha-
sis of the physical education
requirement from mere at-
tendance to’ attainment of
proficiency,

Bévan is a very powerful
man in vhis college. Although
he plays the students off
against the faculty and the
faculty off against the gtu-
dents, he does it with such
skill that both groups have
difficutty in assessing exaat-
ly what their own position is.

But subjecting the students

and faculty to a great deal
of. change can also have a
detrimenta’ effect in that it
may cause’ them to react
negatively to innovative pro-
posals

) must remember that
for any academic change to
have fulll effect, it must
have the full support of the
faculty and studenis who will
implement and participate in
the program.

As Vice President for Fi-
nance and Development, C.
David Cornell has begun to
reorder Davidson's financial
priorities and establish this
school on'a firm financial
basis.

Of course any man who
raises tuition and fees, tim-
its the amount of financial
‘aid funds, and reduces the
operations. of such services
as the Qaundry iis not going
to be very popular wiith the
“students.

A calm, smooth, and for-
wardiooking man, Cornell
will honestly answer ques-
thons dinected to hiim, but he
has a tendency to brush un-
der the pug those difficulties
he hopes students won't dis-
cover. With the present cli-
matte of student suspicion,
Cornell must nealize this is
no longer a wise practice.

When Will Terry was nam-

ed Dean of Students in Jan-
uary, the students couldn't

confidence of most of the stu-

This summer and next year
Terry will have to wrestle
with his conscience and his
job on the subjects of open

leaders, however, are opti-
mistic that Terry will suc-
cessfully juggle his counsel-

Trustee Stand, Community
Threaten Fraternity Move

AN ANALYSIS

By GRAY WILSON
Managing Editor

In addition to an inflexible
trustee attitude toward off-
campus facilities, the four
fraternities which have con-
sidered leaving Patterson
Court next fall must now
face the possible dilemma of
new town zoning against
boarding houses.

At a town.council meeting
Monday night, over ?5 resi-
dents of Davidson petitioned
for a hearing on zoning in

residential areas of the
town.
Mayor Tom. Sadler re-

marked, ‘The basis of the
petition was not represented
as having anything to do
with fraternities at the col-
lege.
“The
there

people who were
were concerned that

the present zoning ordinance
be changed to delete the per-

mitted use of certain areas i

for. a boarding house.”

The present zoning law al-
lows for a boarding house to
be maintained anywhere in
the town. The town council
defines a boarding house as
“any building other than a
hotel in which meals are
served for compensation.”

Sadler said that there were
three municipal areas in
which boarding houses could
be kept, those classified as
‘limited business,” ‘ busi-
ness,” or “industrial.”

He added that the people
who brought the resolution
for a hearing to the council
live in areas around North
Main Street, Lorimer Street,
and South Street. Several of
them were members of the
college faculty.

EPC Codifies Regulations

At an open meeting for
students Wednesday night at
9:30, members of the Educa-
tional Policy Gommittee at-
tempted to explain the draft
of the academic regulations.

Vice President for Aca-
demic Affairs John M. Bev-
an opened the meeting of
10 students and five faculty
members by saying, ‘‘The
academic regulations are
an attempt to pull all
academic rules _ together.
There are some significant
changes in this document,
and we have tried to incor-
porate changes which we
felt would stand a_ possibili-
ty of getting through the
faculty.”

He continued, ‘‘There is no
reason to put in something
which will in all probability

be defeated.” :

According to members of
the EPC, the facuity was
very much in mind. Approx-
imately 35 to 40 different
faculty . members att2nded
the three meetings held for
their benefit.

Students leaving Davidson
in good standing will not be
allowed automatic. readmis-
sion, and members of the
EPC said that a place could
not be saved for an individual
where no revenue was being
received. However, he will
be given priority, and the
leave of absence category is
provided which allows for
automatic readmission.

In the future there will
be no charge for drop-add.

Although when a course is
repeated, only the most re-

cent grade will count, the
computation of grade-point
averages and class standings
will be the number of grade
points divided by the num-
ber of courses taken, includ-
ing the repeated courses,

There was heated debate
at the meeting over .a sec
tion of the proposed academ-
ic regulations which - reads
in part, ‘The candidate for
the degree shall be of good
character and _ conduct.”
Many felt that this was a
sweeping and all encompas-
sing statement which should
not be included in academic

regulations.

It was pointed out that
matters of student conduct
were covered in the Code

(See EPC, Page 2)

This new development, a-
long with the trustees’ re-
affirined stand that ‘‘no or-

ganization, fraternal or oth...

erwise, be allowed to oper-
ate eating or living facilities
off compus,” plunged four
fraternities into serious meet-
ings this week to consider
future plans.

Printable responses to the
indifference of the trustees
were all extremely negative.

Kappa Alpha number one
Sammy Fisher. responded,
“Thoroughly - disgusted, et
cetrea, et cetera. The new
coercive system is impracti-
cal, ill-conceived, and poor-
ly implemented. The trustees
have overextended their
boundaries, assuming a re-
sponsibility not in their pow-
er.”

Phi Delta Theta president
Woody Montgomeny _- said,
“The trustee action is no
more than we expected. We
were particularly _ disap-
pointed with the trustee turn-
out at the student reception
Thursday night. It is obvious
that they really don’t care
what the students think.”

Phi Gamma Delta spokes-
man Brian Evans also re-
sponded dismally. ‘'They
were not receptive at all to
a logical and _ reasonable
arugment. They completely
ignored the alternative we
had to present. Their minds
were made up before we
ever talked to them.”

SGA President Danny Clod-
felter commented on the ac-
tion, ‘I still think that the
guys should be given the
right to eat off-campus, but
I also think that the fraterni-
ties should go together with
this college in whatever de-
cisions it makes.

“It would’ be stupid,” he
added, ‘‘for the fraternities

to get into a hassle with the
college now. It would lead to

- a blow-up or some kind of

lawsuit that would hurt both
sides,”

Clodfelter stated that he
did not envision events ever
reaching such an_ intensity
as to demand _ legal action
one way or the other, but
he said that “if the fraterni-

ties seek to violate the trus-
tee ruling, I'm sure that the

college will take them to
court.”
The real bind that the

houses are in stems from
the prestige of the trustee
decision in alumni circles.

‘Support for the off-campus

move, particularly financial
support, will diminish while
outsiders sit back to see
what happens.

In meetings this wéek
many of the fraternities dis-
cussed what has come to be
known as the “SAE plan,”
that is to accept the Com-
mittee of Eighteen report and
stay on campus with a na-
fional charter,

The trick is to pick as
many pledges through. self-
Selection as possible and
then to discourage unwanted
members who select the
house until they leave,

Despite a student resolu-
tion to bar social funds from
a- house which discriminates -
against, unwanted members,
Sigma Alpha Epsilon seems
to have pulled through the
self-selection process in the
last two weeks with few cas-
ualties.,

One other fear.is that. the
college might institute a com-
preherfisive board fee, which
would compel every student
to pay for use of the houses
regardless of theic connec-
tion with Patterson Court,
if any.
