THE DAVIDSONIAN

I have been considering for a
while whether to write an editorial
concerning the events that have
taken placé between the school
administration and me about the
case of Rob Neigert — the person
who cut Chris Machon’s hand and
threatened to kill me. I fear par-
tially the consequences of my ac-
tions because I may overstep some
bounds of secrecy of which I was
unaware.

But students and faculty need
to know the truth of what’s hap-
pening around them. After all,
“Davidson is dedicated to the quest
for truth and encourages teachers
and students to explore the whole
of reality” (Course Book 6).

Though the Code of Respon-
sibilities hearing has ended, I still
must attend a hearing in Charlotte
on January 23, 1997. So forme, the
past events are not completely fin-
ished. However, I am not writing
this to rehash the past or gain pity.
Iam writing this because I hope to
gain verbal and written support
from the students, faculty and staff.
I am writing to initiate a change in
the way the school handles the
needs of victims in criminal cases.

Most people do not know that
I spent about three hours (from
4:30 to 7 in the morning) trying to
find the Magistrate’ s office in Char-

The organization that decides-

Office would prefer that all this
business be kept quiet — maybe
they are thinking of my feelings

me. Maybe not. Maybe they are

from Davidson to
guide me through this
ordeal. Though the

The students
need to know that
Davidson College is
nota paradise where
they are always
safe. Crimes can
happen here just
like anywhere else.
They also need to
know that the ad-
ministration is go-

lotte or wherever else) victims
when a crime takes place.
Besides helping, the organi-
zation — which should include
faculty, students and staff — should
know andtell the victim what might
result from pressing charges out-
side (and inside) of Davidson. If
the administration truly cares about
the lives of Davidson students,
then it will go beyond its responsi-
bilities on Davidson Collepe cam-
pus and help students with the Char-

administration due to the amount
of secrecy involved in the Code of
Responsibilities hearings.

But as long as they are pres-
sured by a large group of students
and faculty, they should listen.
Maybe parents should also be in-
volyedin writing letters to the presi-
dent of the College.

The Office of the Dean of Stu-
dents made clear that they did not
like that The Davidsonian pub-
lished the story concerning what
took place between Rob Neigert

taking care of both
the victim and the criminal.
If the administration could do

this, it would strengthen the stu- ©

dents’ trust in the college. Keep-
ing secrets can protect an organi-
zation, but one day a detrimental
secret will become known pub-
licly, and the trust that most stu-
dents have in Davidson will di-
minish greatly. I am also asking
for help in pressuring the school to
provide a lawyer for students who
cannot afford one. Schools like

‘lawyer to represent their students,

so why can’t we? If cost is the
excuse, I find that hard to believe.

I’m sure the school can cut
back on the amount of times they
change the flowers around campus
or enact other financial changes in
order to provide a lawyer for stu-
dents in need of one. If the school
did provide a lawyer, he or she
could go with the student to court
and tell the student what to expect
and what to do. A lawyer would
also provide more support for vic-
tims which in turn would initiate
greater trust in the school
administration.on the part of the
students.

I am asking students to write
President Kuykendall and the
Dean of Students concerning these
problems. But it’s not only the
students I need help from. I also
need faculty and staff to put pres-
sure on the administration so that
they will listen and act.

I want the school to know that
I’m not trying to act against the
administration. I want the school
to understand that I am serious and
that I want to work with them. But
it will only work if the administra-
tion, faculty, and students are sin-
cere about wanting to change and
correct the problems of safety and

Faculty voi

So very many of you know the
story Iam about to tell. You know
it because you have been a part of
the Davidson community that has
become our extended family. You
have cut our grass and cooked our
meals. Most importantly you have
held ys in your
hearts andin your
prayers, and you
have helped us
carry a burden
that continues to
challenge us.
Project Life’s
Bone Marrow

I write in hopes
that our story will
convince each
and every mem-
ber of our cam-
pus and our com-
munity tohelp by

two birthdays. His birth certificate
reads August 9, 1993, but it was on
June 28, 1996, that he received a
second chance at life. It was on
that day at Duke University Medi-
cal Center’s Pediatric Bone Mar-
row Transplant Unit that Jack re-
ceived bone marrow from his eight
year-old brother Cormac.

In April of this year Jack was
diagnosed with acute myeloid leu-
kemia (AML), a relatively rare

-husband Kevin, and I were tested

for a match. As we awaited the
result of our blood tests, I merci-
fully did not know the statistics I
am going to share with you. The
possibility of a perfect “match”
(matching on all 6 antigens) for
bone marrow from a parent or sib-
ling is only between 20-25%.
Outside of the immediate family, a
stranger has as much of achance of

a “match” as a perfect stranger.

tions from his pelvic bone. The
bag of bone marrow, roughly a
quart, was still warm in Kevin’s
hand as they prepared to “‘trans-
plant” it into Jack through his cen-
tral venous catheter. There is no
“operation” or “transplant” in the
sense of an organ transplant.
Through what remains to me both
a mystery of medicine as well as a
sign of God’s grace, the marrow
cells find their home in Jack’s sys-

tem over the next weeks and

months. The stories of the follow- '

great joy as Jack battled infections
and graft-versus-host disease.

with these families and their chil-

long as I shall live the pain of
seeing five children, each with dif-
ferent cancer, die post-transplant:

July 12; Nicole Hendrix, 2 1/2, on
August 4; Cody Stanley, 4 1/2, on

Please, please take the time to
offer someone a second chance at
life. Support Project Life and the
