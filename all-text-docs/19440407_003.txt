Athletics After the War.

After the war is over, there’s no telling how long that will
be, athletics in America will hit either a high peak, or a very
low. Boys who come back will be in the best shape that college
athletes have ever been in. They will have more timing, more
coordination and the simple games of football
and basketball will seem like child’s play to
the game of death they have been starring in.
If that happens then sports all over the country
will hit a new peak. There are several things
wrong with this however. If the war lasts
too long, the great baseball, players of to-
day who are thirty and around there, will be
too old to play ball, and they probably won't
have any desire to anyway. Professional
athletics will have to be made up of boys who
are twenty-three or twenty-four, but those
will be the boys who should be going back to

college.
will have to give way, and with public opinion the way it i
today, fans will want to see pro ball instead of amateur ball.
That’s just an opinion of course, but it’s going to be a lot of
boys who come back that won't give a hoot about college, and
will join the ranks of the pros for a little easy money. How:
ever, let’s hope that college athletics won't be forced to remain
that much in thé backgroud of the pros.

This and Here from That and There. :

The Yankees seem-to be just like old man river, they just
keep rolling along. Yesterday they beat the Dodgers 4-3,
with Dickey, Gordon and Bob Johnson gone out of their great
infield of last vear. It was George Stirnweiss, ex-Carolina
star, who took Gordgn’s place and cracked a home run and a
triple to beat the bums.

Murphy Williams who was.a standby on the Cat cage team
a few years ago came back to school and-preached at vespers
Sunday. It seems that some athletes doyrmake good preachers.
Look at Dilly Sunday.

Blanton Belk who-held-down-first-base for the decrepit
clowns of last year is said to have the inside job up at Carolina.
Must be some mistake. =

Tennessee and Alabama, the giants of yesterday in the
Southeastern Conference, have at last decided to play football.
These schools and others failed to field teams last year due
to the fact that they thought they could not win. After sce-
ing the little schools that did play football and not only won
a few games but also made a little money, they decided to con
tinue. [I don’t think much credit is due them though.

Spring Sports.

Right now it looks like the only spring sport at Davidson
will be the baseball team. The track squad decided to abandon
track as could get no schedule. The Cats open the diamond
season next week with the Catawba Indians at Richardson
field. What they have is a mystery at the present. They have
got games though. Four with Catawba, four with N. C. State,
four with V. P.-L. and two with P. C., thus breaking a prece-
dent-of many years standing of not meeting the South Care-
lina Davidson in any athletic contest. They will definitely

AMERICAN HEROES

BY LEFF

Seriously wounded by an exploding grenade, Marine Gunner Angus R.
Goss of Tampa, Florida, braved point-blank enemy fire to charge an
enemy machine gun emplacement in a cave. Single handed, he wiped out
Japanese gunners and snipers-with a sub-machine gun, saving the lives of
his unit. Angus Goss is dead—leaving a Navy Cross for “indomitable
fighting spirit-and-extreme courage.” If such heroism doesn’t deserve an
extra War Bond, what does?

hope of all students, that the college will outlast this war no matter
what happens.
