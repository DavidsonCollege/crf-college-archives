In total, 31.

In athletics, Union has taken in-
terest this past year in football,
basketball, tennis and _ baseball;
baseball being stressed somewhat
more than the others. It might be
of interest to mention that the in-
field and the outfield of the baseball
team this spring were composed of
D. C. men, only the batteries being
from other colleges. Charlie Worth
hase been elected manager, and
“Bill” Currie captain, of the base-
ball team for 1920-21. A. R. Craig,
who played a fine game at guard
during the past basketball season,
has been elected manager and cap-
tain of the basketball team for the
coming year.

Several other Davidson men have
recently been selected by their fel-
low-students for high ofhces for the
next year. Edward C. Murray, Jr.,
has been elected president of the
Student Body for 1920-21. George
L. Cooper has been elected president
of the rising Senior Class. Jamie
Fowle has been elected president of
the Society of Missionary Inquiry,
and Wm. C. Cumming, president of
the Volunteer Band, for 1920-21.
O. C. Williamson and J. M. Mc-
Bride have been presidents of the
Middle and Junior classes, respec-
tively, for this past year.

O. C. Williamson, '18, at the re-
cent Volunteer Council at Yonkers,
N. Y., was elected a member of the
Executive Committee of the Student

Volunteer Movement. On this
Committe Mr. Williamson repre-
sents Davidson and Union. As

there are only two delegates from
the South on this Committee, his
election to it is quite an honor.

Two D. C. men who will leave
Union this May expect to sail in
the near future for the foreign mis-
sion field, J. K. Hobson for Africa
and J. E. Cousar for Japan.

Almost half of Union’s students
for the past year have been David-
son men. The Davidson student en-
tering Union feels from the outset
very much at home among so many
old D. C. men and in the same old
Davidson atmosphere he has Frown
to love. It is often said that Union
is “a second Davidson,” and it is
quite so. The D, C. men who ex-
pect to enter Union on October 6,
may look forward to three years
of pleasantness and delight in a
place where the same old David-
son spirit holds sway.

(Special to the Davidsonian)

Baltimore, Md., April 29.—There
are five men at Johns Hopkins
Medical School who are distinguish-
ed for having attended Davidson.

First, Archie Mutt McKeithen,
"16, a Rumplite, who pursued a nor-
mal course at Davidson and made a
rapid recovery. He is now one of the
high lights of the graduating class
at Hopkins, He will spend: this
summer with Coach Fetzer in camp, |
and will intern next year at the!
Union Protestant Infirmary, Balti-,
more, Md. .
Second, William Holister, °16,
alias “Bull,” an appellation of un-
certain but suggestive origin. This
gentleman was of Chambers fame.
He inserted one year of army life in-
to his medical course, so is at pres-
ent facing the horrible array of ex-
aminations that mark the end of the
third year and the crisis of the Hop-
kins medical course.

Third, Dave V. Hudson, for whom
a famous nether garment has been
named. During his years of res-
idence at Davidson, this gentleman
left his impress upon the town, Hell
Alley, and Chinatown (then third
floor Rumple west). He was the
founder of the Eesculapian Club,
and graduated with the reputation
of having accomplished more prac-
tical jokes than anyone of his gen-
eration. I dare mention none more
remarkable than his going to Chapel
in his pajamas for eighty-five cents.
He spent-two years teaching in
China, and entered Hopkins fast
Fall.

Fourth, Bob McKay, “Butch” ex-
17, who went from Davidson to the
University of Virginia, then to war,
is now in the first year class at
Hopkins, and so is still innocent and
enthusiastic.

Honorable mention should be made
of George Wilkinson, the elder
“Chink,” Davidson '12, Hopkins ’16,
now intern at Bay View Hospital,
Baltimore, and who next year will
begin general practice at Greenville,

Ralph Dunn, °15, who made.
Camden famous, finished at Hopkins
last year, and will be intern here
next year. Reese Jenkins, 17, who
after two and a half years at Hop-
kins, decided to enter the ministry,
and is at Columbia Theological
Seminary.

And last, and least.

Yours truly,
Phil Price, '17.

159 W. 73rd St.
New York City,
May 1, 1920.
To Members of the '15 Class:

We are looking forward to “some
time” when we get together May
23-4-5-6. That is only some three
weeks off now, and in order to make
adequate arrangements for every-
body, the Reunion Committee needs
to know exactly whom to expect
and how many are coming. By this
time, most of us can plan for that
date, so drop me a line at once tell-
ing me you will be there and wheth-
er you will be willing to take a
dormitory room.

Whether you can come or not,
fire in any suggestion you have for
the reunion, yours may be the very
one we need.

Besides writing me, write a let-
ter to the Davidsonian with all the
class “pep” you have. Some other
fellow may decide to come when he
hears that you will be there.

oyally,
James C. Harper,
Chairman Reunion Committee.

Professor—“Does the moon affect
the tide?”
Louise—"Nope, only the untied.”
