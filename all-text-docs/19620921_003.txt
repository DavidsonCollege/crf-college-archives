THE DAVIDSONIAN

THE CITADEL IN CHARLESTON

Footballers Journey To Meet

HIGHLIGHTS
and
SIDELIGHTS

BY BILL PRIDGEN

SOMETHING NEW FOR DAVIDSON

Saturday night’s game against Catawba saw a novel
and — what we hope will be a permanent — addition to
the Wildcat cheering staff.

This new “addition” is Miss Kaky Williams, a sopho-
more at Converse College from Richmond, Va. She needs
no introduction to those who attended the game since she
led the 'Cat footballers into the stadium and proved to be
one of the highlights of the evening in her leopard-sup-
posed-to-be-wildcat outfit.

All this came about from an idea of head cheerleader
Tarby Bryant's to “introduce some spirit-into the cheer-
ing.” With a girl like Kaky, it seems like Tarby has ac-
complished his purpose.

Just how Tarby managed to talk Kaky into becoming |

a Wildkitten is not known. It seems that he got pretty
well acquainted with her on a Brownell Tour of Europe
this summ2r.

Incidently, for those who would like to know how
well this blue-eyed, brown-haired lass is qualified for her

job, she served as head cheerleader at Thomas Jefferson |

High School in Richmond. According to Tarby, “She’s
always loved to cheer.”

For years Davidson went without a mascot and now
it has two—a wildcat and a wildkitten.

We understand that Kaky will be making regular

appearances with the cheerleaders at athletic events. |§

Thanks, Kaky—we hope to see you again.

AN ATTEMPT AT PREDICTION

Tomorrow's game against The Citadel will be an
important game for the ’Cats. Not only will it be their
first real test of strength but it could also be an indica-
tion of what sort of season that the ’Cats will have.

If the ’Cats are plagued with inexperience at some
positions, The Citadel has that problem all over their
squad. They are cut out to have their troubles, as indicat-
ed by their 49-0 loss to Florida State. (Although they lost
to Florida State last year 44-8 and went on to win the
conference championship.)

There seems no reason to believe that the 'Cats

It will be all ‘Cats and "Dogs
tomorrow night at 8 p.m. when
|the Wildcats take on the Bull-
dogs from The Citadel in
Charleston, S. C. ’
The contest will be the first
conference clash of the season
‘for both squads. The Citadel,
defending conference champs,
are given little chance of re-
peating the honor, but they still
stack up as tough opponents.
Suffering a stunning 4940 set-
back to Florida State last week,
the Bulldogs will be out for
blood tomorrow.
Assistant Coach Tom Stev-
ens, who scouted the Florida
State-Citadel game, said that

although they lost, “They are
a tough team that never gives
up.”

When asked to pick some of
The Citadel's players who stood
out in last week's contest,
Stevens commented, “It's hard to
pick out a good performance in
a rout like that.” He did, how-
ever name, several of the play-
ers who should be big guns
against the ‘Cats tomorrow.

Gene Dice, captain of the Bull-
dog squad and an All-Conference
guard last season, will be one of
the Bulldog’s toughest men

AN APOLOGY

Last week the football lineup was listed as ‘First
Unit” and “Second Unit,” and, although the article ac-
companying this lineup explained that neither team was
to be considered as first or second string, we have re-
ceived some complaints. We apologize. From now on they
will be designated as the “Red” and “White” units.

So on Saturday night if the 'Cats kick off, the red
unit will start. If they receive, the white unit will start.

| When a shapely, Sheena-clad
young thing ran out on the field
at Charlotte’s Memorial Stad-
ium last Saturday, Tarby Bryant
marked the advent of his New
Deal for the cheerleaders.

Starting with an innovation
named Miss Kaky Williams, a
sophomore at Converse, Tarby
plans to expand this year’s
cheerleading activities.

Barring an unexpected rift
with his frequent date, the head
cheerleader believes the new
Miss Wildcat will grace most of
Davidson's home games and
some away ones. Asked for ad-
ditional comment on Kaky, he
replied with the eloquence of
simplicity, “Well she’s
good-looking.”

Though his other schemes
hardly teke such pleasingly
tangible forms, they are none-
theless geared to excite stud-
ent enthusiasm for all the
athletic teams. The cheer-

tumbling routines and hope to

the football season.

Weekly they will publish a
sports calendar, and they plan
to work closely with the Pep
Band in devising new arrange-
ments.

Actually, many of the new pro-
jects have already been put
into effect. The cheerleaders
were active at freshman camp,
and they happily assume cul-
pabilty for that new poetic
ditty of the Class of ’66.

Aside from saying, “We ex-

to look for from The Citadel.

enough to get an offense going

although The Citade] “doesn't
have the team they had last
year,” the Florida State game
was not an indication of The
Citadel's potential. He said that
it was “just one of those days
when the Bulldogs got all the
bad breaks.”

Dole expects to use the
same starting lineup that he
used last week, indicating also
that he was very pleased with
their performance and the
outcome of the game.

Getting off to a shaky start
in the first quarter last Satur
day night against Catawba,
Dole’s men came back in_ fine
style and took the season opener
21-0 from the Indians

Both the passing and running
offenses worked for the ‘Cats
as they chalked up 146 yards

passing and 130 yards rushing
against Catawba. Dole’s big line
also held the Catawba offense
to 13 yards rushing.

Davidson’s first score in the
game came in the second quar-
ter when quarterback Ear!
Cole handed off to ‘David

three yard line.

The Cole-to-Heckard combina-
tion also set the stage for the
third touchdown.

Heckard caught five passes for
a total of 97 yards. Asked if he
had a secret formula for being
such a top-flight pass receiver,
Heckard came back with “Well,
I do lots of push-ups on my
fingers. That helps some.”

Graduating from Winston-
Salem’s Reynolds High School,
Heckard played in the annual
North Carolina East-West All-
Star game his senior year.

Head football coach Bill Dole,
when questioned about Heckard,
said “The boy’s got good po-
tential. His speed is good, and
he could develop into one of the
best ends in the conference.”

Heckard can run 50 yards in
5.7 seconds—wearing his foot-
ball outfit.

Heckard has demonstrated his
ability to catch the ball, and if
he continues to do so, Davidson
is in for a fine season.
