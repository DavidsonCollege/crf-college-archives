FROM MULES TO TRACTORS

Campus Beauty Result
Of Hobart’s Work

By BOBBY LIVINGSTON

Davidson Staff Reporter
Mr. Hobart, who? Didn't your date ask you, her
hero, over the weekend, “Who has made Davidson so
beautiful?” And could ‘you say to her, “Mr. Hobart did

this.”

Probably you couldn't. If spe-) path to get started draws a

cial functions emphasize the
beauty of our grounds, it is
not right for us to neglect the
fact that they are kept con-
stantly attractive by a quiet,
good man whom few know, yet
whose work all see every day.

His 32 years here has been
a long time in some ways. This
coming president will be the
fourth under whom he has
served. .

When he came the mowing
was done by mule team. The
college had no trucks, and it
hired in the summer farmers
to mow the grounds. Planting
was confined around the
library—the guest house today.
Dirt ruts scared the campus.
Now he works 52 men.

“Difficulties,” he reflected,
“yes, we have a few. The main
one, I guess, is that there just
isn’t enough time to do all we
see needs to be done.”

Each frequent effort of a new

YMCA FIRST

When asked why such a
young Cabinet had been picked,
Chapin answered, “Many times
upperclassmen become so_in-
volved in other things that they
don't have enough time to
spend on a Cabinet post.

“These men have been ap-
pointed with the Idea that they
will put the Y first. I'd rather
see the Cabinet getting a lot
done and make a few mistakes
in the process than to be do-
ing a little perfectly.

“The first big job is for each
man to make definite plans for
his part in next year’s program.
We hope to set a fast spiritual
pace for the campus next year.”

Union To Sponsor
Magic Program

Students and other members
of the college family and their
children are invited to a magic
show at 8 p.m., Saturday, April
27, io the Union Ballroom.

Performers will be members
of the North Carolina unit of
the Southwestern Magic Asso-
ciation. Special guests will be
children from the Barium
Springs Orphanage.

This program is sponsored
by the Special Features Com-
mittee of the College Union.
There is no admission charge.

prompt counter attack from Ho-
bart’s established forces
Through the years many efforts
of his have been overcome. Stra-
tegic penetration and tactical
diversion are the two plans he
employs today as he either
blocks a budding path with
shrubbery or enhances it with
asphalt.

Mr. Hobart is proud of the
Davidson campus he has de-
veloped. To him it has de-
veloped a_ distinctive beauty
from its age.

His work is much more to
him than just a job. You ought
not to look for him in his of-
fice in the “jungle” for he’s
not there — he’s out supervis-
ing the spring planting.

Mr. Hobart takes pride in #
campus which a quiet confi-
dence tells him, and reveals
to you, that so far as he is
concerned Davidson ig “as
pretty as any school, and, I
like to think, prettier tham
most.”

C. C. Changes Name

Campus Club has officially
changed its name to Alpha
Theta Phi Fraternity but will
remain strictly local, President
Kay Bartell announced.

COUNCIL AIRS

elect of the Student Body, Ross
Smyth. were chosen to repre-
sent the Council at this after-
noon‘s meeting of the Trustees
Presidential nominating com-
mittee in Charlotte. John Bern-
hardt, President-elect of
Senior Class, was to be Smyth's

the

' alternate should he not be able

to attend. The committee de-
sires to hear student opinion
to aid them in their decision.

Still another bystander at the a

meeting, senior Henry Griffin,
pointed out that the committee
would probably draw their con-
ception of the “ideal president”
and then select a man pdssess-
ing those qualities.

Griffin was in favor of a man
outside the college because a
man presently connected with
the college might be “limited
in one department and not
know how to improve another
department” and because he
believed that a man of no of-
ficial capacity with the college
would have “more experience
and broader views.”

ANSWER NEEDS

Phil Kukura believed that
“primarily we need an educa
tor,” when opinions concerning
the type of man for President
were asked for. Kukura went
on: “We are indeed fortunate
for our improved physical
plant and new buildings today,
but what we need in addition is
a stronger faculty and im-
proved educational facilities.”

When asked for his defini
tion of an “educator,” Kukura
replied. “A pioneer in curri
culum, a man who is willing to
step in and answer the needs
for higher education, a man
who will make changes in the
curriculum if it is necessary to
make such changes.”

Blood Drive To Be
Held April 29-30

The Spring Blood Drive will
be held on Monday and Tues-
day, April 29-30.

The drive is being sponsored
by the Interfraternity Council
and the ROTC Department.

Students under twenty-one
must secure a signed release
from their parents before do-
nating blood. These releases
may be secured from their IFC
representatives.

For those giving blood the
incentives are a free PT cut and
three ROTC Drill cuts. A
Plaque will be awarded to the
fraternity having the highest
percentage of donors in its
membership.

Drinking Issue

Reverend Donald Kuhn presented a talk on the pros
and cons of drinking in chapel on April 16.

Mr. Hugh Megione Milton II,
Assistant Secretary of the Army

The reasons many Christians
drink as Rev. Kuhn presented
them are: in order to be social-
ble to friends, free in relation-
ships as student, relaxed. in
order to be closer to one’s truc
self, free from being a moral
legalist, and because the Bible
does not condemn drinking as
such,

The non-drinking Christian
on the other hand might argue
that: in order to be sociable a
Christian would respect the
rights of his friends too much
to drink and a Christian’s faith

When the question was
raised, “How does the Council
feel about having a minister
as President?", Ross Smyth
answered: “Not necessarily a
minister is needed, but rather
a person of high Christian
ideals who has performed active
Chureh work.” Smyth also
didn't “think we needed a man
limited ‘in one category, such
as an educator or minister.”

The Council then moved into
their final business of the
night, that of rewording a pe-
tition concerning an amendment
to the Student Body Constitu-
tion circulated three weeks ago.
The original petition to add a
new section to the Bv-Laws
read: “All elections. shall be
held in student body m-eting
folJlowing the regular chapel
period.” In order to make the
proposed amendment clearr~,
the Council decided the amen’.
ment should read: “A!l e'ections

lar chapel period in Chambers

cards. Blood releases have been
sent to the parents of students
not yet twenty-one. Additional

FRATERNITY COURT

John Trask outlined plans
for completing discussion of
the proposed fraternity court.
His plan called for: (1) a com.

report from Mr. D. Grier Mar-
tin on the various alternatives
and their cost to the students;

MUCH SAFER

“If one nas to decide absvu-
lutely one way or the other,
then let it be negative, for
saying ‘no’ to drinking is much
safer,” he lectured.

Some interest was shown in
Davidson's no drinking regula-
tion. Kuhn pointed out that
other colleges, namely Penn
and Maryland, were clamping
down on their students. The
idea that drinking is not con-
clusive to study is being cir-
culated in the higher educa-
tional circles.

Students varied in their
evaluations of the Methodist
Board of Temperance repre-
sentative’s talk. “He did not
say much,” complained one, -
while another commented,

Kuhn later explained in a
discussion group that no one
type of person will become an
alcoholic. Each person that does
reach that stage will probably
have or develop emotional
problems.

Religious as well as_ social
and financial background also
has much to do on whether a
person drinks or not. Moral re-
strictions in a religion will pro-
duce less drinkers, but the
chances that they wil! have
problems as a result of their
decision is much greater.

The Jews, which are an
example of a sect with no moral
code forbidding drinking, have
many drinkers, but less prob-

had!”
