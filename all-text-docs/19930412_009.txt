“No Man Should Have to Work a Day Without Music"

Story continued from page 7

cially grateful for the shelter. The
plastic seat was soft and comfort-
able. A warm breeze crept through
the cracked windows, carrying the
dull, sweet odor of acigarette burn-
ing. I decided to stop for a drink
when I got back to town.

“Cigarette?”

The voice which made this
offering had come from a very
nearby place, nearer by than I
thought anybody was and my spine
The voice
laughed and I traced this laugh to
the back seat, where the owner of
the voice sat, squarely and leisurely,
a long arm stretched over the back
of the seat, Pall Mall burning be-
tween his strong, brown fingers.
He was still laughing.

“Who are you?” I stammered.

He drew on the cigarette once,
then, holding it our for me to take,
answered that his name was Simon
Pigeon. When I didn’t take the
cigarette from him, he put it back
into his mouth and pulled a long
and easy breath. “I was thinking,”
he continued, “that you could give
me a ride into town. I ain’t got no
ride.” He smiled and smoked his
cigarette some more.

“T can’t,” I explained. “I’m
working. It’s not my car. I’m not
allowed to give rides—insurance.”
I was talking too fast. “I'd like to,
but I just can’t.”

He leaned his weight forward,
against the back of my seat, and
plucked the cigarette from his lips,
as if he were going to speak, but he
didn’t. Sweat beads clung above
his lip and soaked through his white
T-shirt in spots.

“If my boss sees me driving
someone around,” I pleaded, “I'll
lose myijob.” It was the best pay-
ing summer job I’d had. Simon
gave a sympathetic nod, flicked
the butt out of the window and
stuffed himself down onto the floor.
“Tell me when we at the station. I
won’t move ‘til then. Promise.”

We sat silent for a few moments

before I started the car and pulled
up the road to town.

“What’s up town?” I hollered
over my shoulder.

“Money,” he answered after a
short pause. “Everything there ain’t

at home, which is everything,
‘cause there ain’t nothin’ at home.
Nothin’ to be made, that is.”

“You going to work?”

“I’m gonna try.” He almost
had to yell for me to hear him, all
stuffed behind the seat as he was.
He asked if the car had a radio in it.

“No,” I said.

“You tellin’ me,” he shrieked,
“that you drive day in and day out
in this car with no radio.” I re-
sponded that that was the case.
“No music?” he clarified. Again, I
said yes.

“You mustbenearcrazy, boy,”
he marveled, “No man should
have to work a day without music.
Even just a little bit, if he can’t
have it all the time. I like it all the
time myself, but nobody should
have none. . .shouldn’t have to.
Bad for the spirit.”

The rumble of the car on the
road, whishing through the sum-
mer day, was the only sound after
Simon stopped talking. I eyed the
bulky blue dashboard and wished
for a radio. Then Simon’s voice
busted through the silence again,

_ louder, heavier and smoother than

before. He was singing.

“I’m a drunken hearted
man... my life seems so misery .”

The song rose from the tiny
space behind my seat and coated
everything—the gravel, the
heat...

“...if 1 could only change my
way of living, it would mean so
much to me...”

And he kept singing on, until
the roar of the gravel under the car
grew slow, then deep and then si-
lent. “We’re at the station,” I said.
He groaned, prying himself from
behind the seat, and appeared smil-
ing and shining with sweat.

“Thanks for the ride,” he said
and pushed open the door.

“How are you gonna get
back?” I hurried to ask him as he
stood up, outside. It was a guilty
question.

“Shoot,” he laughed, pushing
away from the car with one of his
strong hands, “half the folks here
are dying to give me a ride back.
That’s almost guaranteed. Thanks
for the ride.”
