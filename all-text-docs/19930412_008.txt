The Art
of Tattoos

By Rachel Newcomb

We drove ten miles east on
Independence Boulevard until the
traffic thinned out and we were
almost in Monroe. Jolly Roger’s
was on the right. Ann DuPre’s
Honda seemed out of place among
the beat-up old American cars that
lined the parking lot. I followed
my friends into Jolly Roger’s Tat-
toos, which looked like a bait-and-
tackle shop. The walls inside were
completely covered withexamples
of tattoos and their prices, ranging
from flowers to skulls to huge fiery
dragons. Jolly Roger came out
from a room in the back and sized
Ann DuPre up. “Show me what

you want done,” he demanded. She ~

pulled out a wildflower book and
showed him a quarter-sized pic-
ture of a sunflower. “A hundred,
hundred fifty at least,” he said
shortly. “I’d have to draw that
pattern up myself, and.even then, I
don’t think I can get you that kind
of detail.” He walked into another
roomand came back a few minutes
later with a business card. “I don’t
usually do freehand. You need to
go see Carl in Concord. He does
freehand.” Jolly Roger handed her
the card.

Carl’s tattoo business was lo- ~

cated in a small house ina residen-
tial neighborhood in Concord.
Here, big notebooks were filled
with the standard designs youcould
choose from. Ann DuPre filled out
a form verifying her identity and
proof that she was over eighteen.
While she waited, she talked with
Carl’s wife (who was also the re-
ceptionist) and watched Car! skill-
fully cover a man’s arm with a
tremendous, intricate dragon. It
was well after dark when Ann fi-
nally sat in his chair. He looked
over the design she wanted and
quickly sketched it onto a stencil.
Then he wiped the ‘skin on her
ankle and placed the design down.
With tiny electric needles that
sounded like a dentist’s drill, he
filled in her skin with ink— vivid
gold, yellow, and orange hues of a
sunflower with a brown center. It
took him no more than fifteen min-
utes. He gave her instructions on
how to care for it until the skin
healed and took her money. The
cost? Twenty dollars.
Humans have been tattooing
their bodies for thousands of years.
‘Last year, a 5,300 year old man
was found buried in ice with tat-
toos that appear to have served
some sort of ritualistic or identifi-
cation purpose.. Since then, hu-
mans from almost every culture
have tattooed themselves at some
point in time. According to Jane
Mount, a Davidson anthropology
major who did her senior thesis on
tattoos, tattoos began to spread to
the Westin recent times when sail-
ors visiting other cultures would
getthem. In the West, tattoos have
been perceived as deviant but have
recently exploded in popularity.
Mount mentioned that on a recent
visit to San Francisco, she noticed
that tattoos are incredibly popular.

A number of Davidson stu-
dents took the stage at
Cunningham’s Makeshift Theater
Wednesday to open the third phase
of the 1993 Studio Theater Sea-
son. “Reasonable Circulation,”
directed by Katy McDaniel, re-
volved around the workings of the
secretarial pool in a New York
publishing office. The second
play, “The Great American Cheese
Sandwich,” directed by Barclay
Cunningham, documented one
family’s trials and adventures and
how all is made right by a cheese
sandwich.

“Reasonable Circulation” fol-
lowed the personal and profes-
sional challenges of five workers
inan office. Bob Pascal washighly
effective as acalm and calculating
executive, a part he was born to
play.

Likewise, Jonathan Brooks
delivered a capable performance
as the young actor who is working
while waiting for his big break.
Susie Criscione kept the office
moving as the executive assistant.
Each of the performances was ex-
cellent, but the show was stolen by
Sue Kisla and Holley Wilson, who
delivered. their lines with perfect

Long Island accents as they talked
of Agent Orange, engagements to
be, gastritis, and some guy named
Marko.

’ The second show featured a
very strong ensemble performance.
“The Great American Cheese
Sandwich” was a wonderful sur-
prise in more ways than one.
Rogers King surprised everyone
as the transvestite younger brother,
a part he may also have been born
to play. Sorry Rogers.

The younger sister was Candy
Brown, whose purity and inno-
cence were never in question de-
spite her rather late stage of preg-

nancy.

Joshua O’Neill rounded out a
cast that included stellar perfor-
mances by Bobby Ramsey and
Valerie Whitlock. Valerie gave
yet another solid performance as
the mother of the family. Bobby,
who will also be in next week’s
shows, was astounding as the fa-
ther, and together Bobby and
Valerie kept the show moving
wonderfully.

Two more one-acts will be

presented on Wednesday and

Thursday of this week at 7:30 in
the Makeshift Theater of the
Cunningham Fine Arts Building.

“About two and a half years
ago, two friends and I went to Jolly
Roger’s tattoos. I got one then, a
little dragon on my ankle,” Mount
said. “Then last year, I took Im-
ages of Women, an anthropology
class. I did a paper on images of
women with

ated by the customer and make a
stencil of the image, which is then
transferred onto the skin. The skin
is cleaned with antiseptic and most
tattoo artists use either fresh needles
sterilized by hospital equipment or
new needles. The machine punc-

women with tattoos actually are.
Obviously there are some biker
women who wear leather and have
tattoos but then there’s also nor-
mal, everyday people.” Mount
hopes to pursue photojournalism
or to work in an art gallery. For her
thesis, she interviewed local tattoo
artists and videotaped their work.

Prices range from twenty dol-
lars for something small up to
elaborate designs which cost hun-
dreds of dollars. A freehand artist
will copy an original design cre-

are outlined in black and filled in
with color. Before these machines
were invented, individual holes
were poked into the skin with ink,
alengthy, painful process. People
have even tattooed their skin by
pulling a threaded needle through
it with ink on the thread.

Mount says tattoos nearer the
bone are more painful because they
pinch the skin to the bone. Areas
of the body with more padding
hurt less. It also depends on the
ability to tolerate pain. According
to Mount, many of the tattoo artists

she interviewed said that some men
have a harder time getting tattoos
due to alower pain threshold. Carl,
the artist who tattooed DuPre, told
her that he has had a number of
men faint but never a woman.

From designs used for reli-
gious or ritual purposes to decora-
tive designs, tattoos have fasci-
nated man for thousands of years.
In recent years, tattooing has be-
come more widespread. Mount
estimates thatat least thirty people
at Davidson College have tattoos.
Iasked her if she planned to getany
more. She laughed.

“They say that tattoos are ad-
dictive. I’ll probably get another
one when I decide what I want.
You have toconsider if you want it
all your life. Tattoos can be re-
moved by laser surgery but this is
very expensive. I think a tattoo
should be something meaningful
about you or your life. But some
people like them for aesthetic rea-
sons, I think it’s a great thing just
to have an image for you."

Movie Review...

The Worst

Movie I

Ever Saw

By Scott McLean

I recall that my family once
went to see Hands of Steel. In the
many years since then I have not
seen or heard of anything thatcould
even remotely reach the depths of
atrociousness that movie attained.
The closest thing I’ve observed to
it was what I saw on my last jaunt
to the Movies at the Lake when I
was bamboozled into seeing The
Crush. Walking out of the theater
I decided that I would have rather
slid down a bannister, have it turn
into arazor blade, and then land in
a pool of lemon juice than to have
gone to this thing. Yes, it was
really that bad.

The story starts off when Nick
(Cary Elwes, the guy in black in
The Princess Bride) moves to Se-
attle to begin work with a trendy
magazine and starts looking for a
quiet place where he can write. He
ends up living in the guest house of
a well-to-do couple who have a 14
year-old daughter named Darien
(newcomer Alicia Silverstone, and
as somebody mentioned to me,
doesn’t her character’s name con-
veniently rhyme with Damien?).
As youcan probably guess, Darien
develops a “crush” on Nick and
sets about eliminating anyone or
anything that interferes with her
plans for him--this includes using
ahive of angry waspsamong other
things.

I have one thing to say to the
producers of this film: What’s
your damage? I mean, what were
you thinking? Pleaseenlightenme
because I’m dying to know how
something this badcan be made. If
the story wasn’t bad enough, as it
was, then the acting made this hor-
rible film even worse (if that’s
possible), I am convinced that
Alicia Silverstone attended the
Madonna School of Acting. Girl,
there’s a dollar in the mail--go out
and buy some real acting lessons.
The one (and only) positive thing I
can say is that it was so bad the
whole theater was roaring with
laughter during the greater part of
the flick. For this one I say enter at
your own risk and consider your-
selves warned.
