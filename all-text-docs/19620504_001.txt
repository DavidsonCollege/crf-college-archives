THE DAVIDSONIAN has received an All-American
Honor Rating for the issues of the first semester of this
year. This is the second All-American award for the news-

paper in a row, the last such
semester of last year.

The newspaper was one of
only two in its classification to
receive this honor. Out of a
total of 3700 possible points, the
DAVIDSONIAN scored 3560
points, which was 160 more than
the second-place newspaper.

Thirty-five other newspapers
were represented in the» same
classification.

The DAVIDSONIAN took a
rating of Excellent, the high-
est possible, in seventeen out
of twenty-two categories of
judging. In the remaining five
categories, the rating was
Very Good.

The grouping of the news-
papers into classifications is ac-

the number of students, and the

Dr. W. F. Goodykoontz will head the Drama DVepart-
ment next year, President D. G. Martin announced re-
cently. Prof. John Sneden, now director of dramatics, is

leaving next year due to military service obligations.

“Although plans have not
been confirmed yet, Dr. Goody-
koontz will be in charge of the
drama activities for the coming
year,” Dr. Martin explained.
Goodykoontz will have some as-
sistance in handling such as-
pects as staging and lighting as
he will maintain a limited sched-
ule of English courses in addi-
tion to his work in drama;
teaching courses in modern
poetry, creative writing, and
Shakespearean drama.

A workshop in dramatic
literature, will be taught by
Goodykoontz this summer as
a noncredit course. The
course, which will include
readings and presentations, is
open to townspeople and high
school student as well as Dav-
idson students.

The summer workshop will
study plays of various types and
periods: Greek drama, miracle
plays, Shakespeare, Jonson,
Marlowe, Restoration drama,
and contemporary drama. “Most
of the time will be spent in act-

ing out key scenes, and we hope
to find a nucleus for the pre
sentation of several plays dur-
ing the summer which will be
full dramatic performances, as
well as giving several dramatic
readings. This latter program
depends upon the number of
people interested in participat-
ing.”

The fee for the workshop,
which will be set later by the
Drama Committee, will prob-
ably be less than for a full-
credit course. The tentative
schedule calls for classes to
meet two or three times a
week in the afternoon for the
first summer session and, if
there is sufficient interest,
the course will be continued
throughout the summer.

Goodykoontz expressed hopes
that the Vagabond Workshop
could be developed to supple-
ment studies in the Humanities
course and in other courses
concerning drama by presenting
plays which are read in those
classes. roe

The award was issued by
the sixty-sixth National News-
paper Critical Service of the
Associated Collegiate Press on
April 20. The ACP headquar-
ters is at the University of
Minnesota. Frank Wright,
member of the journalism de-
partment there, was the judge
of the newspapers in the DAV-
IDSONIAN classification. One
of Wright's comments on the
DAVIDSONIAN work: “Su-

perb work all around.”

The papers in each group
were compared with each other
by the judge of that group. Tak-
ing basic considerations into ac-
count, the judge set up certain
standards for the. newspapers.
This semester's papers will
be submitted for the next judg-
ing, the results of which will be
given next year by the ACP.
