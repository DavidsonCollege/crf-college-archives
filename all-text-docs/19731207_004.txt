The 1973 Student Government Presidential Election

This year’s SGA Presiden-
tial election offers students
the choice between four can-
didates of differing ex-
perience and qualifications.
While we feel that each would
offer well of his own unique
talents. it is our belief that
Blain Butner is the one most

qualified for the job.
The other three candidates
are John Scholer. Jim

Goodloe. and Vince Rabil. It is
fair to say that Scholer is
definitely the dark horse can-
didate. for up to this point he
has not participated in student
government affairs. never
Aaving served in the Senate or
on any of its committees.

This is not to say that this
lack of past participation
means that Scholer would not
be capable uf doing the job
Quite possibly a totally fresh
outlook is what is needed to in-
vigorate a presently lacka-
daisica] Senate.

To become a viable can-
didate. however. Scholer
must. through his platform
and campaigning. demon-
Strate a dynamic capacity to
get the job done.

Jim Goodloe has given
generously of his talents to
student government over the
past two years. He has been
both a dorm Senator. and a
class Senator (having been ap-
pointed to that position to fill a
half-term vacancy). He was
instrumental, along with Vin-
ce Rabil. in reorganizing the
Grievance Committee last
year. He was also involved in
setting up the APO used
Bookstore.

Like all the other can-
didates. we feel that Goodloe
possesses the capacity to ser-
ve as student body president.
However. having observed him
in the Senate, we have not
seen the leadership charac-
teristics that the President
needs to be effective. And out-
side of the Book Store and
Grievance Committee. he has
done little to promote student
concerns.

To become a convincing
candidate, he must show what
he has done in the past for
students and how his abilities
qualify him for President.

One would have to go a long
way to find a more diligent.
conscientious Senator than

‘ince Rabil. His credentials
appear impressive. In ad-
dition to his years in the
Senate, he has twice been
President of his class, an
organizer of the Grievance
Committee, and Chairman of
the Senate Constitution and
Bylaws Committee.

His interests go beyond
campus politics. He has twice
been a delegate to the
National Student Association
(NSA) i

In terms of credentials.
Rabil appears on paper the
best qualified to succeed Bo
Phillips. However, beyond the
superficialities of the titles
themselves. we can find little
of substance that Rabil him-
self has accomplished.

We have serious questions
about his past performance.
While he has tried to recover
lost library books. his tactics
at times have violated student
rights. His letter to the editor
on governance displayed a lak
of understanding about viable
governing structures. Neither
flowery phrases nor verbose
verbiage alone will solve the
problems we face here.

In a picture to the editor this
year. Rabi] showed a photo of
Albert Einstein with the cap-
tion. ‘No tenure at Davidson
for the Likes of Him.”’ While
we agree with his sentiment,
we don't feel such emotional
appeals will achieve any suc-
cess in changing the current
policies on this issue.

These are the concrete
illustrations of what Rabil has
accomplished in student
government. While we praise
his zeal. we think more savvy

and finesse is needed in the of-
fice of the president of the
student body.

We feel that Blaine Butner
would do the best job in the of-
fice. Butner has been a good
Senator, and has served well
as chairman of __ the
Educational Affairs Com-
mittee, through which he had
a significant part in drafting
this year’s calendar; and on
the Governance Committee,
where he has strongly sup-
ported increased student
membership in the faculty
meeting. He was also
primarily responsible for the
longer hours the gym is now
open. and was behind the
recent unsuccessful push for
night exams.

The rea] basis for our support
comes from the fact that
beyond his credentials, Butner
seems to have the right kind of
personality for the job and a
good grasp of Davidson
politics. He speaks effectively.
and more importantly seems
to have the knack for getting
along with people, even when
he may disagree with their
opinions.

The office of President of
the SGA is the most powerful
weapon that students now
possess to protect and im-
prove their interests. Over the
years, many of the advances
and improvements in student
life here, have been a result of
the impelling force of the SGA
President. For example,
much of the progress in
student participation in gover-
nance came at the instigation
of former President Danny
Clodfelter.

And if the proposed plans for
a new governance system go
through, then it will be even
more important to get the
most qualified President, for
he will be the only student
allowed to attend faculty
meetings! With this increased
power, it becomes critical that
the student body pick the very
best man for the job.

Therefore, we strongly urge
students to become actively
involved in the upcoming cam-
paign: to read carefully all the
platforms, and to take the
time to seek out and pin down
the candidates on their
positions on various issues.

Alumni And The Magic Number

What's so magic about the
number 1500? That is the
projected size of our student
body for the year 1981. But
why has the Board of Trustees
chosen the number 1500?

Does the number bring
aesthetic pleasure to the
Trustees? One glance at the
Cunningham Fine Arts
building or the new library
illustrates the Board's con-
cern for aesthetics.

If the Trustees did not
choose 1500 for its form did

Capital expenditures in order
to provide new dorm ac-
cemodations for the ad-
ditional] students.

Davidson officials knew at
least two years ago that the
college was inneed of money to
provide the financing for new
dormitories. The federal
government through HUD.
provided cheap money at 4 12
percent up until a year ago to
colleges who applied for the
funds.

A few of our college's chief
decision makers sat on their
hands then and did not make
application for this money.
Today, we have a 9 42 percent
interest rate, no government
money, and no dormitories.

So ends the story of another
Administration decision.
When will they realize that in
not deciding. they have
decided?

Since no answer is in sight
to that question, let us move
once again to that magic 1500.
Believe it or not, 1500 was
chosen because the alumni
will not stand (or give) for
anything less than 1000.

As you know many of the
alumni became quite upset
when we enrolled women,
changed the fraternity
system, and restructured the
football program at their
college. So now, they will not
tolerate any attempts by the
college to drop male
enrollment below 1000.

This group of alumni has
two very ‘“‘sound reasons”’ for
its stand. First, Davidson has
always had 1000 men.

Second they want their sons
and grandsons to be admitted
to Davidson. If male
enrollment is adjusted to
provide for the admission of
additional women, it is
possible that some of their less
qualified male offspring may
be denied admission.

We do not believe that any
refutation of these two
arguments is necessary:
however, in regards to the

second point. one comment
must be made.

What a strange breed of
creatures are our alumni. It
seems that these alumni
would delight inn seeing their
daughters - not only their sons-
attend Davidson. But who
knows, maybe alumni do not

allow daughters in their
families.
The most reasonable

solution to our problem with
1000 now seems to be to reduce
it to 800. With 800 men and 400
women, the 2 to 1 ratio and
coeducation can be main-
tained. The college com-
munity can support 1200
students without having to
construct new dormitories.

_ Our dedicated alumni are
Just going to have to throw
away their reason and accept
the solution which is best for
college.

Progress does not mean 1500
students at Davidson.
Progress does not mean 1000
men at Davidson. To progress
we must be reasonable. If the
college can only afford to
house 1200 students, then let us
only admit 1200 students.

In other words, our goal - the
goal of students, faculty, ad-
ministration, Trustees, and
alumni should be to improve
the quality of education of-
fered at Davidson. The
quality, and not the quantity of
students here at Davidson is
the factor that counts.
