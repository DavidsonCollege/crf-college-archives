Pursues Athletic Career with College On Side

Recently a saddened but not brok-
en end strode into the football
field in Riddick Stadium and
brought sad news to the State
backfield. When this mastodon
from Fayetteville started his ath.
letic career it seemed more likely

ships will enter Oxford in October
of 1951. Appointments are made for
two years in the first instance
‘with a possible third year for scho.
lars whose record at Oxford, and
whose plan of study make such an
award advisable. The basic value
of a Rhodes Scholarship is about

400 pounds a year.

Basis for the selection, as speci-
fied in Rhodes’ will, consist of:
(1) literary and scholastic ability
and attainments; (2) qualities of
manhood, truth, courage, devotion
to duty, sympathy, kindliness, un-
selfishness, and fellowship; (3) ex-
hibition of moral force of character
and of instincts to lead and to
take an interest in his schoolmates;
(4) physical vigor as shown by in-
terest in outdoor sports or in other
ways.

Further specifications state that
the candidate must be an unmarried
male citizen of the United States;
that he must be between the ages
of 19 and 25 on October 1, 1951.
and that he must have completed
at least his Sophomore year by
the time of his application.

established. colleges for he feels
that much of the best work in
educating youth is going on in
this kind of institution.

Though state. universities have
somewhat alleviated the situation
the clusters of schools in particular
areas and the competition among
them still exists. They all publish
bulletins and rent advertising space
to ballyhoo their graduates, their
football teams, their years back
into antiquity, their ivy covered
halls, and their sacred traditions.
All of which have little or nothing
to do with education. Some col-
leges and universities are even ad-
ding departments and_ professors
not because their students need
them but because they need this
new department to lure students to
their own campuses. All this to
Mr. Johnson seems unnecessary
and unfair to prospective students.
But most of all it has little or no.
thing to do with education, which
is what the colleges are supposed
to be dealing with.

Most colleges subsidize athletics,
says Mr. Johnson, under the belief
that winning athletic teams and in-
creased publicity will increase their
enrollment and endowment. He says
that many colleges spend much
of their valuable.money almost dis-
honestly in order to keep the foot-
ball team in the, winning columns
on a false supposition. It has been
shown in many cases most students
don’t go to a college because of
its athletic successes. Often stu-
dents in one sthool are loyal sup-
porters of anothers’ athletic team
without dreaming of changing
schools. Colleges can raise their
football teams from obscurity to
the top ten without increasing their
enrollment by ten. It, of course,
goes without saying that this com-
mercialization of athletics has lit-
tle to do with education.

Mr. Johnson says the American
system of education is a natural
growth of demncracy with some
ersors and it has served well to
train those who have the perse-
verance to want an education. It
is not as strict and disciplinary as
the German system, but it is a ma-
chine which ambitious boys can
utilize and make of it what he
wishes,

that he would end up in the
Coliseum instead of the football
stadium.

This man is “Jelly Belly Kelly
of the Fayetteville Kellys. He was
born at an early age in the thriv-
ing adjunct of Fort Bragg. In this
ideal environment “Jelly” received
his early athletic training; the Aus.
tralian crawl being his stroke. From
his home environment he soon
came to be recognized by all of
the teachers and students. (That's
quite an accomplishment in itself.)
When “Jelly” finally reached high
school he became incorporated into
the blazing juggernaut of the Fay.
etteville “Bulldogs.” Here he ac-
quired the reputation of a “swash-
buckling debonair fool” for his ex-
ploits on and off the football field
(due to personalities beyond our
control this article must slightly
delete at this point.)

In recognition of his athletic
prowess “hell-on-wheels” Kelly was
elected captain of the basketball
team during his senior year. This
same year he personally and
singlehanded won a football game
from Familet High School by scor-.
ing 18 points. “Stubby” Evans saw
this game and came away mutter
ing “That Kelly is really a horse.
Won that game singfe-handed
without a block being shrown.” A
little later on Kelty decided to keep
the public talking by burning up
the hoops in a blazing basketball!
season that ended with his aanw
on the All-State five.

In the abnormal course of events,
Kelly came to Davidson on a
basketball scholarship which pays
his room and board, but has failed
to get him on the court. In this
his fifth year at the hallowed halls
“Jell has not only not played any
basketball for the varsity, he
thought Shepard was some kind of
a dog. .

Here it might be appropriate to
say that other than athletics “Jelly”
did have a few interests. For two
weeks he was a member of the

THE DAVIDSONIAN

Hang Your Hat at Hugo's

By NAT DANIEL

It belatedly behooves me to get
down to the business of introduc.
ing to the Davidson student body
those places of business which
he, individually and collectively,
most frequents. »

First and foremost on our list is
the Pride of Upper South Main—
the College-Cut-Throat “Drug”
Co., operated by the one and only
Hugh F. Sapp, a Davidson tradition
sarpassed only by the classic walls
of Phi and Eu Halls. ,

No matter what college or uni-
versity town one visits, there he
will always find one business estab.
lishment or “hangout” which iden-
tifies itself with the college whose
students keep it in business, and
insists that “the finest boys in the
world” are those of the college in
question, especially those who spend
their money at said emporium.
Such an institution is Hugo’s. A
drugstore only by the grace of
Hadacol and Ex-Lax, it supplies
Joe College with everything from
waste paper to wastepaper baskets,
including soap, pencils, pens, candy,
sodas, and even second-hand radios,
several of which have possibly been
on Hugo's shelves since that fate-
ful day when he opened his doors
to take the Davidson student to his
heart and to his cash register.

The second mast frequented spot
in our city’s “business” district is
that long cardboard box called,
the Davidson “theatre.” Now a part
of a Charlotte theater chain, it is
operated by Charlie Fleming (Da.
vidson °49), with a special feature
each evening behind the candy
counter. Here once or twice a week,
a Davidson gentleman, tired of the
incessant drudge of Munn, Plato,
the College Omnibus and history
lectures, indulge in what is called
by misplaced courtesy a screen
play or movie. Identifying himself
with the celluloid hero, together
they dash to the..rescue, indulee in
a nice, heart-warming drink, or a
long, lingering, passionate kiss, he
slips into a world which wise men

dream of and only fools believe

really exists. But life is all too real,
and at 5, 7, 9 or 11, he must for-
sake his utopia and return to the
drudgery of getting a liberal arts
education.

The next stop in our journey

wv

along Main Street-is the Davidson
Bank, known on Wall Street as
the Piedmont Bank and Trust Co.,
which for a small service charge,
makes the sweat of our parents’
brow ready expenditures at the
aforesaid places of business and
at the scourge of Hugo's, our
money-making student store.

Here's one for Ripley—the only
combination hardware and grocery
store is right here in the shadow
of our unstable oaks and is known
as the Davidson Hardware Co.
From stove, to stove bolt, to sauce-
pan, to the sance itself, all under
a single shingle, the Davidson
Hardware Company is the utility
store of the campus and the com.
munity. They deliver refreshments
and sell grass seed, cleaning uten.
sils, in short, anything to keep
the Davidson home (ell trimmed,
well cleaned and well fed.

In conclusion, it may come to
the reader's mind that we have
tread lightly in our introduction. of
these places of business, but he
should remember the highest creed
of a Davidsonian staff member—
after all, these are our advertisers.
