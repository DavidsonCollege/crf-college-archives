To Our Readers:

It is our belief that the social life
here on the Davidson campus does not
have fitting publicity. And it is also
our belief that as it is creditable
enough and plays such an important
part in the Davidson man’s life (and
a part which is growing more im-
portant every year) that it should have
ample publicity and recognition we
have set aside this column to be de-
voted entirely to recording the social
doings of the campus. It will be our
endeavor to print in this space those
happenings which should prove of in-
terest to the student\ body as a whole
and which heretofore have only been
passed from person to person.

YE EDITOR.

Greetings

This is an active social season for
the Davidson man. Just returned to
school or coming for the first time he
finds many social obligations and ac-
tivities of a like nature awaiting him.

For the old man there is the greet-
ing of old comrades and friends and
the renewing of old friendships in the
student body, in, the faculty, and in
the town. To him there is the meet-
ing of the Freshman class and learn-
ing those who will follow him,

For the new man there is the
Orientation to college life, to college
customs, to college traditions. And
then there is the more terrible ordeal
of meeting the Sophomores. (It would
be thought that the meeting ‘of the
Juniors and the Seniors is for him
more pleasant.)

The first social’ activity entered up-
on by the Freshman class as a whole
is the reception held in their honor by
the Y. M. C. A. in the “gym” on Mon-
day night. Later in the year the “Y”
will sponsor informal receptions for
them.

Of course, it must not be denied that
a great deal of time will be spent in
selecting that Braeburn and sending
a box of candy to the best girl who is
expected up on the first house-party.
By that time he will have a suitable
vocabulary of college: slang in his
possession together with his room-
mate’s best tie to greet her. Event-
ually he will become acquainted with
those around him and proceed into the
social life of the hill with confidence
and ease. *

New Social Homes

The most outstanding feature noted
thus far to initiate fraternity life on
the campus for the coming year is the
line of fraternity houses on Concord
street. and named. by the authorities
of the college as “Fraternity Court.”

To the new men these structures are
buildings of attractive design and
which enhance in a large measure his
conception of the beauty of the place.
To the old man, especially the old
fraternity man, these new additions
are a marked improvement and ad-
vancement in fraternity life here. They
have created a great deal of interest

at Ernest

‘on the campus as a whole, all of which
is favorable. It is assured that the
week-end guests, the parents, alumni,
and others visiting the houses will leave
the “hill” with the same impression,

Rushing Season in Progress

The next week and a half will be
very busy ones for the eleven national
and local fraternities with the rushing
of the new men from the Freshman
class. Never in the history of the
, college has there ever been so large a
class with which to associate.

It is noted that while the season is
short it is pleasantly filled with social
activities of various sorts on the part
of the fraternity men for the would-
be-initiates. From the present time
until September 3oth house-parties, re-
ceptions and smokers will be held.

It was noted that a number of stu-
dents left the “Hill” Saturday eve-
ning with the diversion apparently in
Charlotte.

items as it may choose, to him, along with
society news of interest from*other mem-

is surrounded by a good environment and
should form a true character. The school
furnishes the brick, mortar and trowel,

builder and it is up to him to form and
strengthen his moral structure. He then

Jazzmen Hold First
Tryout For Positions

On Monday, October 17, Shearer Hall
was the scene of the tryouts for the
“Sunnyland Serenaders,” Davidson's’ up-
to-date jazz orchestra, as four Freshmen
candidates displayed their music ability
before Director Geer.

The quartet aspiring to these positions
included John Sevier, candidate for the
trumpet; H. Y. Ryburn, for the piano;
Robert Orr, for trombonist, and I.. C.
Griffin, for the saxophone.

Of the ten musicians who composed
last year’s orchestra, only six have re-
turned to take their places. B. H. O.
Geer comes back as director and trum-
peter, and C. C. Orr resumes his position
as saxophonist and violinist. J. H. Ram-
seur and A. J. Thompson are the other
returned saxaphonists, while C. J. Al-
bright and O. T. Gibson are banjo and
bass horn players, respectively.

At present there are no candidates for
the drums. Anyone wishing to try for
this position may apply to Geer.

It is a lamentable fact that the poten-
tial vote of this country, as. registered,
rarely exceeds 25 per cent, and the total
vote in 1924 was only 50 per cent, in
round figures, of the total registration.

It is*estimated that there will be 56,-
000,000 qualified voters this year. If only
three out of four of the voters should go
to the polls the result of the balloting
would be representative.

America is far behind the other repub-
lics of the world in the interest shown in
elections, although this was the first of
the great republics established. Germany,
to illustrate, has only one-half of the
population of the United States, and yet
there were 2,000,000 more votes cast in
that republic than in this country in 1924,

Mr. Raskob, Democratic Chairman, re-
ferred to this fact in a letter made public
about two weeks ago, writing “This can-
not be a government of all the people by
50 per cent of the people.”

genius. He admonished the Freshmen to
acquire social grace by observation and
association, and to engage in some of the
college activities. He, however, warned
them against trying to participate in too
many of them.

BATTALION
DISTINGUISHED

For the third consecutive year
the local R. O. T. C. Battalion
has been rated as distinguished
by the War Department. David-
son was the only college of its
type to receive this rating in the
entire country.

In The (Collegiate World

Liberal Wisconsin

University of Wisconsin's boasted
liberalism missed fire when the Stu-
dent Forum cancelled a lecture by Mrs.
Bertrand Russell, on the ground that
her message was not in keeping with
the policies of the Forum last spring.

First objection was registered by
Scott Goodnight, dean of men, when
the Cardinal published excerpts from
New York newspapers giving Mrs.
Russell’s views on companionate mar-
riage, free love, and eugenics.

“The quotations attributed to her,”
said Dean Goodnight, “were unworthy
of any speaker who was invited to
speak on a university platform.”

He notified President Glenn Frank
who then asked the officers of the
Forum to reconsider their action. They
decided to cancel the lecture, but
insisted that the action was taken on
their own initiative without either
coercion or recommendation from the
president. The chairman of the For-
um explained that when the lecture
was planned, it was believed that Mrs.
Russell had “a valuable and _ signifi-
cant” message for the. students, but
‘Jater information leads us to believe
that we were wrong.”

President Frank would make no
statement, but referred an interviewer
to his article written for the Cardinal's
first Sunday magazine, before the Rus-
sel episode. That was entitled “Sane
Censorship,” and said in part: “Offi-
cial oversight of student discussion
should, I think, concern itself, to the
virtual exclusion of all other consider-
ations, with the preservation of. ele-
mentary good taste and common de-
cency. It should not concern itself
with a dogmatic selection of ‘safe and
sane’ ideas. For, after -all, most of
the ideas we now think safe and sane
were once derided as unsafe and in-
sane.” ay

Both Dean Goodnight, and F, Louise
Nardin, dean of women, approved the
cancellation. Mrs, Russell did speak
in Madison, but not ungil E. L. Myers,
columnist on the Capital Times, had
gone to a deal of bothr finding a hall
that would permit the lecture.

Mutual Desire

Answering frequent editorials in the
Yale News regretting the absence of
personal contact between president
and students, President James Row-
land Angell, in’a letter to the student
paper, explains that he has tried sev-

feral unsuccessful ‘experiménts and is

“still giving consideration to other pos-

sired results.”

Saxophone Slang

“Slang and the saxophone are kin,
for they both serve as means with
which to express every mood—free or
tense—of the human heart,” writes Dr.
Frank H, Vizetelly, managing editor of
the New Standard Dictionary, in an
article called “Slang: the Saxophone of
Speech,” in the Daily Princetonian.

Dr. Vizetelly does not underestimate
the forcefulness of slang, neither does
he join the purists in denouncing it as
vulgarizing to the language. “What
has been said of slang in the past holds
good for the present,” he writes, “for
it is, and has been little else than a
direct product of the spontaneous com-
bustion of the emotions, caused by a
bursting of ‘the bonds of restriction
that conventional life has imposed. It
is really the ‘side show’ of¢ speech
which may, some day, win its way in-
to the ring, and there prove the chief
attraction. The people who think do
not find it hard to cite examples of
this, and college slang is full of it.”

Yet for all this there are difficulties
in the way of anyone who would offi-
cially adopt the new terms, Dr. Vize-
telly continues:

“In our academic institutiois we
have much slang that virile and
snappy, yet to one who devotes him-
self to the study of English, the re-
dundance of unauthorized words and
bizarre expressions frequently proves
a source of unutterable annoyance and
vexation. Should he take advantage of
what he sees and hears in his own day,
and incorporate into the language the
frippery gathered through daily con-
tact with the affirs of life or through
familiar conversation with his fellow
men? If so, then the very first to’ con-
demn him would-be the literary critic,
and he would not lack any of them to
tell him that he had recognized in-
sufferable vulgarity. and debased the

season did not take place suddenly, but
comes as a result of considerable discus-
sion and much experimentation. Ten years
ago, no Freshman was pledged until after
Christmas. As time passed, the rushing
season was gradually shortened, and the
fraternities were allowed to extend. the
bids before Christmas, and the period has
been materially shortened each year since
then. At present, the new plan is only an
experiment, and its success or failure will
doubtless determine the future procedure.

There has been no change made re-
garding the time of initiation. A pledgee

reports show that he has made passing
grades in at least three major subjects.

During the interim of pledging and initia-
tion, however, the Freshman is virtually
a member of the fraternity so far as the
use of the halls is concerned.
