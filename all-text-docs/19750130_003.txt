GILL HOLLAND

The award was for ‘‘Fru Lang-

Nilsens Painting.”

“IT was delighted to receive
the award,”’ said Holland.

“At first I thought it was a
trick that Professor Winkler

was playing on me since the
award was on my birthday. I
realized it couldn’t be when the
check slipped out of the en-
velope.”’ Holland said.

The judge was Reynolds
Price, novelist in residence at
Duke University.

Both Holland and Professor
J. S. Winkler have poetry in
the last issue of The Cold
Mountain Review, another
literary journal.

Varied YMCA Plans Depend

By CHARLIE SHEPHERD
Staff Writer

The Davidson YM/YWCA
coordinates programs ranging
from afternoon recreation ac-
tivities for elementary school
children to a weekly lunch for
senior citizens. Focal points for
YM/YWCA activity are the
Depot, Ada Jenkins Schoo! and
the college campus.

The varied programs the
YM/YWCA offers depends
largely on interest and
creativity of Davidson students,
according to YM/YWCA
President Sue Cunningham.
Present activities include a
variety of programs at Ada
Jenkins School, scouting

programs, STEP ‘tutoring’, and
a Thursday lunch-discussion
hour for Davidson students,
faculty and administrators.
Cunningham said that plans
are being made for a coffee
house for junior high school
youth, an information-
emergency center in Grey
Union, and Town Day which is
scheduled for early May.

“More of a variety of people
are working with the Y now,
and we'd like to reach even
more,”’ she explained.

“Activities centered in Ada
Jenkins School include the af-
ternoon recreation program,
the Schoolhouse of thé Arts, and

plans for a street academy that
will be available for students

Senate Rion

By MARK GERGEN
Staff Writer

o

The Senate passed a resolution
unanimously calling for night exams at
the Tuesday meeting. Senator Bo
Baskin presented’ a report discussing
changes and problems with the food ser-
vice on campus.

The night exam resolution was
proposed by Senator Martin Eakes as a
compromise to the resolution passed last
year, which the Educational Policy Com-
mittee tabled. A major argument cited
by the faculty in not appro this
measure last.year was the ina ty
of professors should a student taking an
exam need to consult with the professor.

The new resolution calls for night
exams on the second and third days of
the exam period. ‘This will give the
professors four exam periods to discover
any faults in their exam necessitating
their presence,’ said Eakes.

Eakes added that Mrs. Kimmel, who

runs the exams, favors a night exam
trial. In an all-campus SGA poll last
year, 92 percent of the student body also
said that they would like to have the opt-
ion to take an exam at night. The resolu-
tion was unanimously.

Baskin presented a report covering
changes in the food service and rec-
om ending voluntary participation.

“There is an _ intensitication - of
problems due to a lack of competition.
Even if there was competition in town,
the compulsory payment system would
make it economically unfeasible for a
student to eat anywhere but Slater,”
Baskin said.

Baskin explained that the system of
payment in advance creates a negative
incentive as it pays Slater to provide poor
service.

‘No one is the villian in this. Ron Scott

is trying to provide the best service-

ible. We’re all to blame: the college,
Slater, and the students.’’

Baskin pointed out that Seott’s profit
margin for this year is only 0.8 percent.
For this reason there is a certain amount

Eakes’ Advocates Ni ight Exam Proposal

of justification in the proposal to increase
cost and limit the period of use for tickets
from seven to seven, according to
Baskin.

The problem with this is that presently
many students cannot use all their

tickets, decreasing the period of use will

make them worth even less than their
presently depressed price, Baskin added.
“The current plan. should be maintained
but the compulsory payment plan should
be jettisoned,”’ he concluded.

Senator Rick Roylance gave a pert.
on the new College Union stating
they are now to the stage where they ate
decorating the interior.

Roylance also added, ‘‘All the
suggestions made by the administrators
are considered positive improvements.’’

In other action, Tom Ionas was ap-
pointed to fill the open off-campus chair.
Karl Goodhouse was placed on the Coun-
seling and Guidance Committee, and
Carol Watkins and Bill Reid were placed
on the Student Life Committee.

Absent from the meeting were John
Guthrie and Joe Logan.

who have been suspended from

School. z

The YM/YWCA needs volun-
teers to help plan and supervise
afternoon recreation from 2:00
to 4:30 once a_ week.
Sophomores Bob Earnest and
John Swanson are directing the
afternoon recreation program,
and students who would like to
help should get in touch with
them, Cunningham advised.

The Schoolhouse of the Arts
teaches music, arts, and crafts
to a wide age group, and Direc-
tor Nancy Hazel has asked the
YM/YWCA to provide students
that will help teachers in these
classes. Also, Cunningham em-
phasized the need for students
to do maintenance work at Ada
Jenkins,

Recently the community cen-
ter at Ada Jenkins was ap-
proved as a street academy for
students who have been suspen-
ded from North Mecklenburg

_ High School.

Whent he street academy is
opened, the facility will be used
constantly, and Cunningham
anticipates that tutors will be
needed. :

She also hopes that more
students will become invdlved
with the program for senior
citizens.

“I foresee qualified students
going over and taking blood
pressure and just talking with
these people,’’ Cunningham ex-
plained.

The YM/YWCA is coor-
dinating plans for Town Day
with the bicentennial
celebration of Mecklenburg
County. The celebration will
commemorate the 200th an-
niversary of the county’s char-
ter.

About 25 to 30 people have

showing up at the Thurs-
day lunch-discussion hour
(1:00) at the Depot. It’s sort of
like brainstorming,’’ explained
Cunningham. ‘‘We talk about
things and think about new
ideas.”

‘Sophomores John Allen

~Tucker and Mark Yow are

learning the ropes of the STEP
program and will co-direct it af-
ter Senior Kenneth EHiler leaves

“‘There’s not much emphasis
on teaching kids stuff. unless
they have.a problem and want
help,’’ Tucker commented.

“What I’ve done so far this
year is mess’ around with
them,’’ he add

Once a week Tucker and
