Rugby pastes N.C. State in season-opener

By CLAYTON SCHLOSS
Staff Writer

In their biggest test of the sea-
son, the Davidson rugby
team dominated N.C. State
on Saturday. The Wild-
cats, inspired by a large
Homecoming crowd,
toppled the Wolfpack, 22-
10.

Davidson got on the
board first when fly-half
Hank Ackerman pushed his
way into the try zone after
a bruising run by second-
rower Will Baldwin. Eight-
man Michael Schenck
picked a ball out of the
scrum, and headed down-
field with Baldwin in sup-
port. When Schenck got
tied up by Wolfpack de-
fenders he dropped it to
Baldwin, who bowled over
two State defenseman be-
fore leaving the ball for
Ackerman. Fullback Matt
Burkhardt converted the
kick:

The Wildcats took the
7-0 advantage into half-
time.

powered his way into the try zone
after some excellent running by
the back line. Flanker Thayer Long
and hooker Eric Borgstrom scored
Davidson’s other tries.

“This was a huge game, and
we all came ready to play, “said
Long. “Our hard work at practice
really paid off. We were just more
aggressive and in better shape than

Early in the second pe-
riod prop Mike Lassiter

they were.”

Davidson set the tone for the
game with hard tackling and quick
play. Inside center Graham Powell,

Ackerman, Burkhardt, and wing

Hank Ackerman busts through the State defense as teammates Craig Murphy, Graham Powell, Warren Buford
give support during the Wildcats drubbing of the Wolfpack on Saturday.

Christian Baker led the back
charge, keeping the State backs
out of rhythym and off their game.

The forward line stayed in
support well, and busted through
for some huge runs. They
also won many scrum
downs against the bigger

Wolfpack, particularly as
the game drew on and con-
ditioning became more of
a factor.

Scrum. half’ Warren
Buford kept the tempo
quick, and frustrated his
Wolfpack counterpart.
Multiple times Buford
would get a hand on the
ball or lay a hit on the State
scrum half, forcing poor
passes out of the scrums
and the rucks.

“Everybody stepped it up
today. It was a total team
|| effort, and we had great

| passing. The crowd really
} got us psyched up, and we
went out there and put a

hurtin’ on ‘em,” said
| Borgstrom.
| The Wildcats’ road gets
no easier in the coming
weeks, as they play at App.
St. next Saturday and then
square off against Duke the
following week.

them by alot and just didn’ tscore,”
Dye said. “I think we needed to
win big to prove to ourselves that
we can get the ball in the back of
the net.”

The Wildcats play four games
this week, three against regionally
ranked opponents, but the team is
confident heading into this diffi-
cult stretch.

“We're playing very well. We
proved we can score on
Wedensday, and if we put a full 90
minute game together then good
things are going to happen,” Dye
said. “We’ll surprise some people
with an upset.”

The problems continued in
Miami this weekend at the Florida
International Umbro Soccer Clas-
sic.

A Robert Clarke goal, assisted
by Fernando Campos, gave the
Wildcats a 1-0 lead on Friday
against 14th-ranked George Ma-
son. But the hot Florida sun drained
Davidson’s intensity, and three
unanswered GMU tallies meant
another loss for the reeling Wild-
cats.

Florida Institute of Techn
logy, aperennial Division II power,
dealt Davidson their third defeat of
the week yesterday. Falling 3-1,
the Wildcats are now forced to re-
evaluate the season.

“We’ve got to find it in our-
selves to break out of this,” said
Slagle. “We are very down right
now and we need an attitude
change. We will start again on
practice Tuesday (after a day off
today). We’ve got a great chance
to boost our confidence with the
very best - the number one team in
the country - Duke, on Thursday.”
