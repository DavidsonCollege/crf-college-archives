not-too-angry
protest —

“Disappointing” was the wotd WDAV's Ex-sta-
tion Manager Carrington Thompson used to
describe the results of Tuesday’s Student Govern-
ment Association referendum and the turnout at
Wednesday’s protest rally.

Thompson said he was - “‘surprised”’ that only
about 100 people turned out for the 10 am rally,
which was late getting started and dampened by the
fact that only one of its three scheduled speakers
showed up.

According to Thomson and other student
leaders, the referendum and rally were intended to
demonstrate student discontent over last Monday’s
trustee decision giving control of the radio station to
College President Samuél Spencer and his: admini-
stration.

Before the referendum results were tabulated
Tuesday afternoon, Student Body President. Bruce
Brown said he hoped ‘to get over 1000 ‘‘yes’’ votes
and only a’ few ‘‘no”’ votes fore their statement
condeming the Trustee action as ‘educationally

harmful, financially unjustified, and ethically irre-

sponsible.”

Instead; he got 616. ‘‘yes’’ votes. and 94 ‘‘no”’
votes.

Brown later.said he was pleased the statement got
as much support as it did, but added the results
could be interpreted to mean a majority of Davidson
students implicitly support the Trustee action.

On Wednesday, Thompson told the small. crowd
gathered in front of Chambers for the rally,:‘We are
very thankful for the support we got’’ in the
referendum.

But he then added, ‘‘I don’t know how much good
it’s really going to do us with the Trustees.”

Even as he spoke, some: students were writing
letters to the Trustees, pleading for the decision t to
be overturned..-

WDAV
‘very unlikely’

By MARK BARRETT
Staff Writer

A spokesman for the Federal
Communications Commissions
yesterday pooh-poohed. the idea
that WDAV will not get its
license because a freshman
played a record called ‘‘Johnny
Piss-Off”’ on October 5.

Director of Communications
Martha Roberts told the Board

_ of Trustee’s Executive Commit-

tee last Monday that “We can

_ expect a full investigation and

all the attendant publicity that
will bring. It is quite possible
we will not be granted the
license for the station.” _
Chairman of the Board War-
ner Hall later used Roberts’
statement as one of the justifi-
cations for the decision to: give

> control of WDAV to College

President Samuel Spencer and
his administration.

Hall said the decision will
make it “far easier for us to
defend ourselves.”

In a telephone interview with
The Davidsonian Wednesday,
FCC spokesman J. J. Freeman
said although he was unfamiliar
with the WDAV case, ‘‘(In such

-a case), it is very unlikely that ~

the station will come under
investigation for-violation of the
obscenity code as set down by
the FCC. As a rule, the FCC
does not begin such investiga-
tions unless complaints are
numerous and over an extended
period of time.”

Deputy Director of the South
Carolina Educational Television
Network — Radio Division Herb
Reese commented that in his
experience, ‘‘One instance of
obscenity will not cause, loss of
license: The FCC will probably

file the complaint away unless.a_

series of complaints are re-
ceived.”

Concerning the renewal of
WDAV’'s license, Executive Di-
rector of WDAYV Don Lovell
said, ““WDAV does not have a
license for 18,500: watts broad-
casting. We. are now broad-
casting under program testing
authority by the FCC.’’ He
explained this: is the final stage

bers? How large will the Com-
mittee be?. Who will head the
Committee?’ -

In addition to these, the PAC
is also considering the sugges-
tion ‘of including students on
the Committee. Patterson indi-
cated that the chance of student
representation is highly unlike-
ly, and the probability of "stt-
dent committee members with
voting privileges is even more

At his. open end meeting of
October 17, College President

pro

before WDAV receives a high
power license. ‘

Freeman explained, * ‘What i is
being examined during the pro-
gram testing authority period is
the technical quality of the
broadcast signal; not the pro-
gramming content.’ He’ said
further that the obscene record
incident will have’ no influence
on the initial licensing for
18,500 watts, and a minimal
effect on license renewals:

Roberts’ sole statement on
the matter Wednesday was, ‘‘I
only know that a letter of

complaint’ was written to the

FCC.”

In answer to several rumors,
Freeman said that WDAV will
retain its status as an éducatio-
nal, and thus tax-frdd station,
regardless of whether it em-
ploys students. ““The only way
that a station can lose its
educational status is for it to
make blatant profit-making at-
tempts.’’ Freeman also con-
firmed that WDAV will incur no
fines because of its interruption
in broadcasting and that this
interruption will have no ulti-
mate effect on the licensing

process, except to possibly -ex-
tend its duration.

In preparation of WDAY’s
resumption of broadcasting,
Roberts said Tuesday that she
is now drafting a proposed
operational and programming
structure for WDAV, subject to
Spencer’s final. approval. She
hopes to have the proposal on
Spencer’s desk by early next
week.

Roberts stated that this plan,
“will call for the hiring of a
professional program director.
The hiring of any other staff will
depend on student participa-
tion. The main difference be-
tween past. and future opera-
tions willbe the presence of
professional ‘supervision and in-
struction.”

“My proposal. will definitely
include maximum opportunity
for students to participate in
the station under professional
guidance in both paid and

PAC molds tenure committee

Samuel Spencer indicated he
was opposed to the inclusion of
student committee members for
two: reasons: 1) students lack
the experience to effectively
evaluate tenure candidates and;
