RIKER SINGS “DAVIDSON”

New Song Written By Instructor
Honors Davidson Men

Davidson presented one of the most
varied programs of the year last Satur-
day. It included the Home-coming cele-
bration, the observance of the spirit of
Armistice Day, and recognition of the
football season which now holds sway on
the campuses of the colleges of the coun-
try.

Another important part of the program
was the presentation of the piece entitled
“Davidson”, by Franklin Riker. Mr, Riker
is a teacher of voice at Davidson College
and he has just recently composed this
song, as he states it, “A complimenting
tribute to the Davidson College men both
young and old.” It was arranged by Pro-
fessor J. C. Pfohl for the Davidson Band
and appeared on the program last Satur-
day for the first time.

The program opened with the song
“O Davidson,” played by the band and
was followed by the song, “Davidson,”
sung by Franklin Riker. In keeping with
the celebration of Armistice Day “The
Stars and Stripes Forever,” by Sousa,
was played. The band: then continded with
the “Children’s March” by Goldman, and
afterwards “In a Monastery Garden” by
Ketelby. The trombone section of the
band made a novelty selection of “Las-
sus Trombone” by Fillmore.

Grier Martin gave the “Campus
News” in which he discussed Home-
coming Day and other: interesting news
about the campus, Back to the celebration
of Armistice, the band played the
“American Patrol’ by Meacham. ‘The
tribute to the nation-wide football spirit
was displayed with a series of college
football songs, namely: “Notre Dame
Victory March,” “On Wisconsin,” “Wave
the Flag,” of the University of Chicago,
“Rouser-—March,” of the University of
Minnesota, and ending with “Dear Old
Duke” as a tribute to the Home-coming
game. ;

The program concluded with “Son of
a Halfback” and “To the Military Band”
by Yoder. This program is one of the
most enjoyable that the college has put
on the air.

Again, the hour for this broadcast has
been changed. It is now on the air from
ten to ten-thirty o’clock on Saturday eve-
nings instead of Friday afternoon from
four until four-thirty. This makes the
third time that the hour for the broadcast
has been changed.

Study Is Made Of
Student Expenses

An interesting study of student expen-
ditures and sources of expense funds is
being made by the class in economics five,
which is conducted by Professor C. K.
Brown.

The statistics obtained in this canvass
of about three hundred and fifty students
will be compared with those of 1931. At
that time the Student Body, which was
smaller than at present was found to
spend over half a million dollars in the
school year.

The students were picked at random
and interviewed by members of the class.
The first question asked was the class to
which the student belongs. Next asked
was how much money was spent for tui-
tion and college fees, room rent, board,
clothing, traveling expenses, dues and
fees to college organizations, and for mis-
cellaneous purposes. The third question
took in the sources of funds used to meet
these expenses, whether they are to be

Student Store Display
Contains Lost Articles

The Student Store has placed on
display a number of lost articles
that have been found on the cam-
pus.

Carlton Chapman has gotten the
Student Store to place in a show
case articles ranging from knives and
keys to parts of R. O. T. C. uni-
forms. These things may be claimed
by the students that they belong to
by seeing Carlton Chapman in 31
Georgia.

The following articles are on dis-
play in the Student Store: One
Freshman cap; one English book;
one R. O. T. C. cap number fifty;
two knives; two combs; one pipe;

Lingle Commemorates
Armistice Anniversary

The regular chapel service on last Mon
day morning, November 11, took the
form of a celebration of the seventeenth
anniversary of the signing of the Armis-
tice which brought the World War to
an end.

Dr. Walter L. Lingle, the president of
the college, spoke to the student body,
reminding them of the great horrors and
losses of war and challenging them to
find a new, more intelligent, Christian way
to settle international controversies.

He said that this war was fought with
two objectives in view: to make the
world safe for democracy, and to end
war. Neither one of these goals was at-
tained, for the world today is much more
autocratic and less democratic than be-
fore the war, and far more warlike than
ever before in the memory of the pres-
ent generation.

He closed by reminding his audience
that Armistice Day is set aside, not as
a day to glorify war, but to glorify
World Peace.

Major G. H. Roeder Speaks On

New Sewage

Bacteriologist Discusses Efficiency
Of System Before Sigma
Pi Sigma

Major George H. Roeder, engineer in
charge of the new sewage plant, spoke at
the first open meeting of Sigma Pi Sig-
ma last Monday night.

Major Roeder did his undergraduate
work at Rutgers, and then took his Ph.D.
at Harvard. He then did the original
research work for the medical depart-
ment of the Rockefeller Institute of
N. Y. in Bacteriology. He made a study
of sleeping sickness and infantile paraly-
sis. Because of his good work, he was
chosen for an expedition to go up the
Congo river to study these diseases, This
was sponsored jointly by the Rockefeller
Institute and the British Government.
However, while he was in England pre-
paring for this expedition the war broke
out and the expedition was called off,
and he enlisted in the British Infantry
as an officer. He was then transferred to
the French Artillery and was decorated
with the Croix de Guerre in April 1915.

He was transferred to the air service
soon after this, and was a member of the
famous French Escadrille. After this, he
was transferred to the American flying
service until the war was over. He then
returned to this country and continued a
study of sanitary engineering in which he
had always been interested. Since that
time he has made a specialty of this
work,

Major Roeder pointed out that in in-
stalling a new sewage disposal plant, the
two interests of the city and tax payers
were the cost of installing and cost of
operating. He also said that the plant
under consideration must be free from
trouble in its operations, as the sewage
cannot be shut of after the plant has
once been started. He said that the plant
which has just been installed here is as
near perfect in these respects as has been
developed.

The speaker pointed out that contrary
to the general belief that this matter is
not very dangerous to the health of any
one who handles it. The disease germs
do not live very long in this matter,

The main problem of this work is to
get rid of the solids. They are rendered
stable so they can be used or thrown
away, This is done by treating it with

Musical Services Are
Featured At Vespers

The first of a series of Musical Ves-
per Services was held in Chambers Au-
ditorium last Sunday night.

James Christian Pfohl directed both
the orchestra and the glee club, in their
selections, while Carlton Chapman lead
the devotional exercises.

Kenneth Scott opened the lovely serv-
ices with an organ prelude, “Prayer From
‘Stradella,” by Von Flotow. “A Mighty
Fortress Is Our God” by Martin Luther
was used as an appropriate chorale,

After the invocation, chorale response,
hymn, and chorale “Oh Holy Father,” by
Palestrinas, Carlton Chapman led the au-
dience as they repeated Psalm 23 in
unison,

Franklin Riker rendered two inspiring
solos, “The Good Shepherd,” by Van de
Water, and “My Hope Is In The Ever-
lasting,” by Stainer, while Louise Nelson
Pfohl added to the program with a beau-
tiful piano solo, “Jesus, Joy of Man's
Desiring,” by Bach.

A quartette made up of members of
the glee club sang “Thanks Be to God,”
by Dickson, accompanied by the organ.

A hymn, “Come, Holy Ghost, In Love,”
prayer, benediction, silent prayer, choral
amen, and the organ postlude completed
the service,
