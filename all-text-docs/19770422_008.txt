‘Opinion

The Davidson College Un-
ion seldom acts to meet stu-
dent needs and so provides
little social release for the
students. Instead of providing
creative entertainment
through which the students
can vent their frustrations and
energy the Union is stuck in a

rut of beer and half-rate

country rock bands or discos.

Although planning the big
weekends are by no means the
Union’s function both Mid-
winters and Spring Frolics
1977 provide excellent exam-
ples of this negative, destruc-
tive programming.

Both weekends revolved ar-
ound the 900 Room, country

rock bands and beer. Granted,
Spring Frolics was held inside
because of weather conditions,
but even held on the football]
field the program had nothing
new or exciting to offer the
students. Instead the week-
ends seemed to be an excuse
for audience-wide drunken-
ness.

ls the College Union for students?

By JEFF MORROW
Guest Columnist

The ‘‘union” suggests either the
bringing together of two or more
things, or the resulting state. Web-
ster’s New World Dictionary defines
the word as ‘‘an act or instance of
uniting two or more things into one; a
state of being so united.”’

Is the College Union so ‘‘united’’?
Is this supposedly volunteer organi-
zation really serving the students?

The students who make up the
coordinating bureaucracy of the Un-
ion often seem to forget that they are
not appointed to do a job, but rather
it is in their self-interest for learning
the job that they became elected.

There is nothing among with desire
and self-interest, but it should be
recognized as such so as not to
obstruct the ideal actions and goals of
a Union. One of the most dishearten-
ing things is how hard it is for a stu-
dent to break into this bureaucracy.

There are many funds (funds
meaning here that it came from either
our mother’s pockets or scholarships)
that the Union misuses.

The students who are in the
bureaucracy have a duty to respect
the desire of the student body as to
how these funds are used.

An example: in the fall of 1976, the
two vice presidents’ discretionary
funds of the Union (funds totaling
$1500) were given to help pay for the
big TV screen in the Union.

To my knowledge, the students
were not contacted or asked if they
wanted their money used this way.

Another example: the student pro-
“ject committee, who can only give out
money to a student with the approval
of the entire committee including two
faculty members, dealt out some $500
without the faculty members knowing
anything about it.

A third and final example is the

abuse of the so-called ‘‘Business
lunches’”’. When a performer is con-
tracted here for a show, it is written in
his contract that-he will be fed. Josh
White was fed a breakfast after his
performance this past fall with C.
Shaw Smith, William Brown, and
three people who worked on the
committee.

However, six additional unauthor-
ized Union people. showed up for the
meal and nobody reprimanded them.

Even though a small bit of money was
misused in this one instance, the
implications it suggests is devasta-
ting.

What’s so terribly frustrating ab-
out this whole mess is that all this
mishandling of money is the student
body’s fault. So what’s the use of
even mentioning all this when most
students could care less about how
their scholarship money or parental
money is being used?

fills most weekends on campus
(if the Union schedules social
events besides movies at all).
The students are bored, and
are forced to leave the campus
to find the release they need.
So what happens to those
without transportation?

Union fails to meet students’

The Union Bo; ard pi urchased
a large TV for programming

uses. What is more destruc-
tive to creativity and thought
than television?

All this pertains to the
social half of Union program-

ming, the only events in which
the students seem interested.
The Union provides top-rate
cultural events, |ike Alvin
Ailey II dance troupe, visiting
speakers and more.

The students do not attend
these events. So where else
can they receive such quality
entertainment for pennies?

Instead they either attend
the same type of social events

The Union Board Executive
Committee (UBEC), made up
of the Union Board officers
and members of the Union
staff, works as the starting
point of Union Board policy
formation.

In addition, it handles busi-
ness that does not involve the
Board per se but is more
concerned with Union opera-
tion in general. This is the
committee to serve if one

wants to find out something
about Union policy or if a
change in policy is desired.

In talking with Billy Hut-
chings, Union Board Presi-
dent, Olivia Ware, Vice-Presi-
dent for Co-Curricular Activi-
ties, and William Brown, As-
sistant Director of Union Pro-
gramming, one finds that the
decisions of the UBEC are
geared to the students of
Davidson.

Their goals and objectives
are to make the Union a place

to provide an outlet for stu-
dent creativity and expres-
sion, to offer special opportun-
ities for students through
other students, and to make
the Union the extracurricular
center, apart from athletics,
on the campus.

Probably the biggest ‘task
and problem facing the UBEC
is trying to communicate to
the students that the Union is
what they themselves make it:
The problem is not one of
apathy as much as it is the

eUBEC encourages prograrr

students’ not fully understan-
ding how they can use the
Union to make it what they
want it to be.

The UBEC tries to encour-
age students to use, to partici-
pate in, and to bring forward
ideas for Union programming
but Brown acknowledges that
direct participation in pro-
gramming is not for everyone
because of the chaige in out-
look that one gets from being
in the background of a pro-
gram.

The problem is that there is
a hesitancy among Students to
get involved in any of the 18
Union Board Committees be-
cause it is not understood that
the committees are open to
anyone who wants to partici-
pate and that committee work
takes up as much time as the
student wants to put into it.

The important thing about
committee ‘work’, Brown
says, is that the students who
participate do the work be-

- gause it is something they

want to do and not Something
