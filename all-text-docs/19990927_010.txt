IdnEgo are Freud's psychoanalytic voices
that influence all relationship decisions. Id, who
represents the unconscious and licentiousness in
all of us, rarely agrees with Ego, who touts the
conscious and morally-aware course of action.
Tune in each week to hear them face off against
each other as they analyze your relation-
ship and provide counsel.

the weirdest thing, her boyfriend came to visit this
weekend and seeing them together and fooling
around got me really jealous!!! I consider myself
a totally normal girl and I definitely still like boys.

Dear “little confused and more worried,”

At first I didn’t want to admit it, but .
recently I’ve found myself — I think —
attracted to her. A couple of times we
have hugged and it’s felt really good —
better than it should.

Dear IdnEgo,

I am so embarrassed to be writing this, but I
don’t have anyone to talk to about it. I'ma
freshman girl and when I got to college my room-
mate and I hit it off right away — we had a great
time going down to frat parties, going out to
dinner, playing Frisbee — just hanging out to-
gether. At first I didn’t want to admit it, but
recently I have found myself — I think — attracted
to her. A couple of times we have hugged and it

college is about experimenting — and the labora-
tory of “life” can be a lot more interesting, educa-
tional (and kinky) than your chem lab. Remember
Id’s perspective — if it feels right do it! Ok, so
you're worried about freaking your roommate out
— Id understands this. Here’s what you do. This
weekend tell your roommate that you want to
spend a “girls” night out — the two of you go out
have dinner, go dancing, and drink — a lot. Then
come home and just give her a hug goodnight and

Dear “‘little confused and more worried,”

CONGRATULATIONS! You're learning
something that high school sex ed class forgot to
mention: human sexuality is not always just about
Adam & Eve, Sometimes it’s just Eve and Eve,
and Adam has to go play by himself and watch
them have all the fun.

So you're a little wigged out? Ego says this
is absolutely a-ok. Emotions, especially for women,

kinds of wonderful
experiences.
Sexual attraction is normal. In fact, research finds
that | out of every 3 women experience some sort
of physical relationship with another woman dur-
ing their college years. Having a sexual experi-
ence — whether it be hugging, kissing, or fondling
— does not mean that you are gay. You are simply
an open-minded person willing (unlike many oth-
ers) to admit your feelings, explore them, and
trying to understand them. What should you do?
That’s up to you, but Ego says take things slowly
and simply enjoy exploring.

Your friend,
Ego
