McCARRON from p. 6

list.
How about those Mets?
When it came to nut-cuttin’
time in the pennantrace, the
New Yorkers had their
minds on their next auto-
graph session at Walden-
books. Epic prose from just
about the entire starting
nine. A couple more hits
would have worked better.
Seriously, though, one
sports book from 1987 that
is quite enjoyable is Tim
McCarver’s. Oh, Baby, I
Love It is McCarver at his
charming best.
Sissy of the Year
Jim McMahon of the
Bears. Sure, he runs over
linebackers like a fullback,
but who spends more time
on the bench with injuries?
Some boxers have a glass
jaw, McMahon’s gota glass
body. He’s healthy enough
to eat burritos and search for
“good help” on television,
though.
Jerk of the Year
Brian Bosworth of the
Seahawks. Ok, Bri, youare
kind of original, but how
about shutting up and just
playing football? First, you
won’t play for Seattle, then
you are going to retire, then
you are playing with the
Seahawks, then you are not
happy in Seattle playing the
sport you love best, then
you won’t talk to the press,
then you’ll only talk to the
Washington Post. Now
what? Frankly, I don’tcare.
The Boz is no longer worth
any space because his team
is no longer in the playoffs.
P.S.--Boz, try to stay out of
Bo Jackson’s way, you'll
stay healthy longer that way
(nice tackle, though).
Throw of the Year
Mike Ditka nailing a fan
with his chewing gum.
Disgusting, you say? Hog-
wash. Paying the price of
admission does not entitle
fans to get abusive. Ditka’s
little toss is poetic justice.
Finally, justa little recog-
nition to those who deserve
it for the 1987 season. Con-
grats to: Jimmy Johnson
~ and the Miami Hurricanes,
*the Florida State Seminoles
(one point away from the
National Championship),
the Minnesota Twins, the

New York Giants, Indiana
Hoosiers, LA Lakers, Ed-
monton§ Oilers, Andre
Dawson, Lawrence Taylor,
George Bell, Steve Bedro-
sian, Roger Clemens,
Wayne Gretzsky, Michael
Jordan, and Magic Johnson.
