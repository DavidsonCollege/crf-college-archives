Calligan, Davidson Graduate,
Writes Band Arrangements

The Junior class of Davidson College
wishes to announce that it has secured
Bill Allsbrook and his Orchestra ‘to play
for the annual Junior Speaking Dances
to be held: in-the—Chariotte~Armory on
the fifteenth and sixteenth of this month.

Long a high light of the college social
calendar, the junior festivities this year
will feature a set of three dances: the
formal, Friday night, from nine till two;
a tea dance, Saturday afternoon from
four-thirty to six-thirty, and an infor-
mal, Saturday night from eight to twelve.

Bill Allsbrook comes straight from an
engagement in Greensboro, where he has
been playing at the O. Henry Hotel.
His orchestra has proven very popular
there, and is highly recommended.
Woody Caligan, who, while at David-

son, wis connected with Reeves Pope
and his Southernaires, writes the ar-
rangements for the band.

The orchestra also features seven vid-
linists of unusual talent and promises a
surprise in form of a new and exception-
ally gifted vocalist whose name is, as
yet, a secret. \

Most novel feature of the set will be
the “Beauty Contest.” Balloting will be-
gin with the opening of the dance Fri-
day night and will be closed at the in-
termission of the informal Saturday eve-
ning.

A committee headed by “Geddie” Mun-
roe is in charge of decorations. It
promised that there will be plenty of
streamers and that traditional Junior
Speaking armament, confetti, on hand
for Saturday night’s party.

Matthews Injured In
Accident Saturday

E. R. ‘“‘Weenie’’ Matthews, of Gas-
tonia, was critically injured by fly-
ing glass when someone threw a
stone through the windshield of the
car in which he was riding last Sat-
urday morning.

Particles of glass entered both
eyes, and it is feared that he may
entirely lose the sight of the left; he
also ,suffered painful lacerations
about the face and is at present rest-
ing as comfortably as can be ex-
pected in a Charlotte hospital.

Matthews was riding to Gastonia
in a car driven by S. P. Stowe. As
the students were a group
of men on the Gastonia highway not
far from Charlotte someone hurled
a rock at them, shattering the wind-
shield. They stopp q
ed the men, but none of them would
admit any knowledge of the affair.

The Davidsonian joins with his
many friends in the student body in
wishing ‘‘Weenie” a speedy re-
covery.
