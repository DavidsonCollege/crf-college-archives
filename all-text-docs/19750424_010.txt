The Davidsonian

Lacrosse Cats drop opener

Davidson’s new lacrosse team plaved its first game against Little Creek
Lacrosse Club at Norfolk Naval Base in Virginia. The Cats lost 18-1 to their more
experienced opponents, Rick McKenzie scoring the goal in the second period when
Davidson played Little Creek even.

In the first period the Cats gave up 6 goals, 1 in the second, 6 in the third, and 6 in

the fourth.

A shortage of players hurt, as did the fact that Little Creek’s members were
veterans of top ranked NCAA teams of recent years. Goalie Rick Offuit made 14

saves for the Cats.

completed by the team. The
money will be given to some
needy organization in the com-
munity.
