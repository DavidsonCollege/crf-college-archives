BY STEVE BYERS

The Battle for Seattle. The Brawl
for it all. Welcome to the wonderful
world of hype. This weekend Hous-
ton, Virginia, Georgetown and Ken-
tucky vie for that coveted prize: the
right to have their faces smeared all
over the cover of Sports Illustrated

A national title and a No. | rankig
are also part of the package, but the
publicity is more important to the
players. The Final Four is an event, a
spectacle unmatched in sports. The
Super Bowl has too much build-up,
while the World Series is watered
down being spread over several
weeks.

As N.C. State proved last year, a
team like Virginia cannot be over-
looked, though it is easy to ignore
them. They don’t have any catchy
nicknames, and they don’t have too
many Las Vegas bookies behind them
either. But they do have capable inside
players and a great set of guards,

year ago. And remember, this is do or
die now, so if the Cavaliers can put to-
gether back-to-back strong games and
if the others falter, who knows? Vir-
ginia is my sentimental favorite for
three reasons: they are big underdogs,
they represent the ACC, and Coach
Terry Holland is a former Davidson
student and coach.

The Houston Cougars need to an-
swer some questions. Can Guy Lewis
coach? Can they make a free throw?
Can they hit any shot that isn’t a dunk?
If there ever was a team due to win the
title, it is this Houston team, which lost
in the semifinals in ’82 and in the final
last year. They do sport the best
nickname in the Final Four — Phi
Slamma Jamma — and their center has
the best name, Akeem “The Dream”
Abdul Olajuwon. Virginia’s center,
Olden Polynice, runs aclose second. If
Lewis allows his team to play their
type of game, which is fullcourt, run
and gun basketball, and Akeem stays
out of foul trouble, they may not have
to worry about missed free throws.

Coach John Thompson and _ his
Georgetown squad have been labled
“Grand-master Flash and Furious
Twelve,” an appropriate title for a de-
fense-oriented team that is at least nine
or ten players deep. Thompson usually
wears the opponent down, throwing a
variety of defenses and players at them
until the other team relaxes for just a
minute and then it’s over. Center Pat-
rick Ewing leads this gang of in-
timidators (other say “punk” and
“thugs”), who always look as if they're
getting ready to punch your lights out.
The Hoyas are the favorites in this
mini-tournament, and if form prevails,
they will win the national tithe Monday
night, but not many friends along the
way.

That leaves Kentucky, the team
with the most talent of the four, but
probably the fewest supporters willing
to pick them for the title. On paper the
Wildcats look unbeatable: a front line
that goes 7°l, 6°11 and 6°8, a
sharpsooting “two” guard and a lightn-
ing-quick point guard. Who can beat a

team like that? And yet they did lose
this season, four times in fact (includ-
ing an embarrassing blowout at Au-
burn), so anything could happen. Still
though, I’m betting that even Coache
Joe B. Hall can’t screw this team up,
and that they will withstand the chal-
lenges of Georgetown and Houston to
win it all.

My only regret -—-_ besides
Carolina's early exit of course —. 1s
that Ralph Sampson no longer plays
for Virginia. Picture a Final Four of
Olajuwon, Ewing, Sampson, Melvin
Turpin, and Sam Bowie. Al McGuire
would call it the battle of the “aircraft
carriers.” Just imagine the slams and
rejections in those games.

Equestrian Team To Host Last Show Of Season

By JANIS EVANS

In its two shows since January, the
equestrian team has faced tough compe-
tition from the region’s other schools,
particularly the University of South
Carolina and the College of Charleston.
With these larger, more experienced
teams making their final push to qualify
for the regionals, the normally consistent
performances of the Davidson riders
were greatly hampered.

Davidson entered all nine of its riders
at the College of Charleston show Feb-
ruary 19. This show turned out to be one
of the most competitive shows of the sea-
son, of its 12 entrants, Davidson brought
home five ribbons. The Division I (walk-
trot) riders fared the best. In class 1,
junior Kelly Sundberg placed second,
her third finish in the top three of the
three shows she has entered this season.

The three class 2 riders finished as

follows: sophomores Trish Lennon, sec-
ond; Janice Evans, third; and Jan With-
ers, fifth. The only other team member
taking a ribbon was sophomore Julie
Waters, who placed third in class 5. Also
attending the show were freshman Shery]
Aikman, junior Susan Moore, senior
Mandy Dotson, and freshman Kate
Lehman.

Only Evans, Waters, and Aikman
went to the March 3 show at St. An-
drew’s College. Evans took a second
place in class 2, and Waters continued to
show improvement from a mid-season
lull, getting fourth place in class 5, and
sixth place in class 8.

The regional horse show for the eight
schools in region 9 is April 15. With one
show remaining in the season, two
Davidson team members have a good
chance to qualify. Points are acquired-
depending on finishes in the regular sea-

son shows, and 21 points are required to
qualify for the regional show. Sundberg
now has 16 points and needs a second
place in the upcoming show. Evans has
the team-high total of 19 points, and
needs a fifth place to qualify.
