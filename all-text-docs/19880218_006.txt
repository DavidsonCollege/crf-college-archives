“Crocodile” Dundee

offers not a bit of originality

But it’s still a fun movie!

By JOHN HARRIS

Here we go again! Once more
the Union Pop Film Committee
has selected another film for our
viewing pleasure that nearly all of
us have already seen. Oh well, I
suppose I shouldn’t complain,
seeing that I have the disgustingly
expensive habit of seeing movies
at least four or five times anyway.
Inany event, since the film is here,

let’s talk about it, shall we? Okay, .

getcomfy ‘cuz “Crocodile” Dun-
dee might make you fidget.

The premise of this film is
rather old, dating back to a couple
of 1930s Tarzan films along the
lines of Tarzan goes to New York.
In this Australian update, Nick
“Crocodile” Dundee (Paul
Hogan) visits the Big Apple at the
insistence of a female reporter
(Linda Kozlowski) who is fasci-
nated by his Outback way of life.
Naturally his primitive lifestyle.
and naiveté take the New Yorkers
by storm (note his encounter with
a pair of prostitutes). The hectic
pace of the big city does not over-
whelm Dundee, nor does he feel
compelled to adapt. He merely
brings his refreshing quality and
unwitting humor to ‘a society
moving too fast to recognize its

own charm. In short, the film is,
well,cute. Butitis definitely afun
movie.

Unfortunately, and despite his
occasional flashes of charm and
wit, Paul Hogan merely walks

through his role of the Aussie
‘adventurer. Those of you familiar
with his sleeper-hit Australian TV
series “The Paul Hogan Show”
(Australian counterpart to the
comparatively unfunny “Benny
Hill Show”) will no doubt be dis-

appointed by his uninspired per-
formance. Allhe really does in the
film is walk around and smile a
lot. Hogan, who conceived and
co-wrote the screenplay, is ca-
pable of much better.

Word has it, incidentally, that
the people of Australia were not
particularly overwhelmed by
Hogan’s portrayal of the Aussie
image. Despite that fact, “Croco-
dile” Dundee became the most
commercially successful film
from Down Under to ever hit the
world’s movie screens.

For those of you who can’t get
enough of Hogan or Dundee, a
sequel is in the works, with the two
principles (Hogan and Kozlow-
ski) reportedly furthering their on-
screen romance. Can’t wait!
Perhaps the makers of Dundee IT
will re-hash ‘even more movie
clichés then the cliché-ridden
original!

“Crocodile” Dundee is fun and
cute, but it lacks even as much as
a speck of originality. That’s a
shame, because the talented cast
could have easily carried a better
script. And finally, once again:
not a single bare hooter to be
found (not that it would have mat-
tered).

The Last Emperor :mixing sensibilities beautifully

_By BRUCE PLOURDE

The same guidelines for assess-
ing the value of a book also apply
to the assessment of a film. The
simple reason for this dual appli-
cation is that novels and films are
close allies. Both are devices for
telling a story. At times the paper

. and ink medium achieves the re-

sult better than the celluloid me-
dium, and vice versa.

Moby Dick, for instance, con-
siders the relations of man, nature

and the caprices of Heaven, '

whereas in translation it becomes
a film merely about whaling.

Star Wars relies on its stunning
display of visual effects which
lose more than a modicum of their
impact in paperback version.
Still, the origins of many fine
films lie in fine books.

The film transduces from the
printed page the appeal of the
book, to some degree, while
eliminating the need for the acti-
vation of the participant’s imagi-
nation.

One scale for estimating the
relative quality of a book relies on
the work’s effect on the sensibili-
ties. Movies, like novels, touch
the viewer’s awareness through
three channels: human interest,
aesthetic value and intellectual
stimulation. A novel which ful-
fills its reader’s expectations en-
gages all three of these sensibili-
ties.

The fine film also does not con-
centrate on only one part of this
set, but manages to somehow
meld the trio together. The for-
mula, so seemingly simple, is

more difficult a problem than one
might anticipate, which explains
why there are not more chef-.
d’oeuvres in literature and cin-
ema.

Films which win the Golden
Globe award most often under-
take to engage all three sensibili-
ties and do so successfully. Imag-
inea film which has won four such
awards. The Last Emperor, di-
rected by Bernardo Bertolucci, is
such an example. Throughout its .
course it simultaneously calls
upon the sen-
sibilities and
envelopes its
audience
with its fasci-
nating art-
istry.

The Last
Emperor
gives the bio-
graphical ac-
count of the
life of Pu Yi,
last emperor
of the Qing (Manchu) Dynasty,
and last ruler of imperial China.

RYVICHL SAKAMOTO. 1

~ Becoming emperor as an infant,

he grows to see his land become
the People’s Republic of China, a
country with no use for “the Son of
Heaven.” Only within the con-
fines of the Forbidden City does
he wield absolute power over his

subjects. He commands, and his
subjects obey.

But they obey by choice, ac-
cording to their beliefs in the cus-
toms of the past. When he attacks
the policies he himself must obey,
he attacks the only support for his
power, which is tradition, and
soon finds how ineffectual his
power is.

The pageantry of the Forbidden
City is exquisite. Bertolucci had
total control of the atmosphere
and made it appear, if not truly au-
thentic, then
beautifully
believable.
The Star
Trek-like
color coding
of the actors’
costumes im-
plies rank:
imperial §yel-
low for the
chief, various
blues for the
emperor’s
consultants, and elegantly pat-
terned reds for persons of lesser
importance. They perform the
rites of worship within the con-
fines of the Buddhist architecture.
Corruption of the entire court
completes the vision of reality.

When the PRC evicts Pu Yi and
his family from his city, he turns to

the Japanese for help. The Japa-
nese restore him to power in his
native Manchuria. Again, ruling
inside the confines constructed by
his supporters, he plays the part of
a puppet emperor again, signing
his name to whatever ordinance
they deem necessary, and realiz-
ing his impotence when acting
contrary to their wishes.

Only as prisoner 981 of Mao’s
Republic can Pu Yi, last emperor
of China, recognize his limita-
tions and accept that he will never
be more than a gardener. Once a
demi-god with absolute sover-
eignty, Pu Yi loses all his power
and supremacy to become one
humble and graying member of
the multitudes.

Not only is The Last Emperor
moving on a personal level, but it
is told in epic proportions, encom-
passing China’s transition from
Empire to Republic to Commu-
nist state, And itis the story of the
one man most adversely affected
by the turning of China’s tides.

bring the emperor, his wife and his
beloved English tutor to credible
life.

One leaves this film believing
that he has seen and felt part of the
history of China, and that one has
learned something in the bargain.
