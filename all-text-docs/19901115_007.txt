Davidson’s standings because
Baptist is a club team. The Bucca-
neers (3-3) will make the transi-
tion to NCAA Division Ii status in
football next year.

shared the passing duties with
freshman Richard Howell; Howell
threw a 28 yard TD pass to Del

Radford (4-15, 12-15, 9-15) in the
finals of the Big South Conference

spectacular season with 31-6 rec-
ord, 8-2 against conference oppo-
nents.

Coach Rebecca Hawkins,
while disappointed with the loss,
praised her team and gave due
credit to the Highlanders. “We

‘of poise in the finals,” said Hawk-

enough to beat Radford whoplayed
brilliantly ean the tourna-

dition, and threatens only to im- ‘

prove, as no seniors graduate.

son:

Concluding a Faultless Preseason

By ROBERT GRUBB

Themen’ stennis team finished
a perfect fall season on Thursday
with a 9-0 shutout of Queens Col-
lege that improved the Wildcats’
dual match record to 6-0. Coach
Jeff Frank was extremely im-
pressed with the ease with which
his team dispatched the Royals.

“We won most of our matches

’ fairly decisively,” he commented.

The Queens match continued
a fall season trend. Once again led
_by the top three singles players, the
‘Cats started strong and never gave
Queens a chance to get into the
match. Albie Varoski won his
match at number one in straight
‘sets, 6-1,6-1,and David Jespersen
came back from match pointin the
second set to win his match.

Kurtis Zabell, Dave Tonidan-
del and. two freshmen, Russell
Briggs and Chris Parker, rounded
out the Wildcat lineup. Briggs and
Parker, in particular, drew Frank’s

Joey Manibo keeps his eye 0 on ate ball

praise. Said Frank, “‘Russell and
Chris played about the best of any
of the freshmen in our round-robin
challenge matches.”

In doubles, Zabell. and his

partner John Beyer continued to "

dominate at the number one slot.
“Kurt and John have played solid,
smart doubles all fall,” Frank said.
“They’ve had a lot of confidence
and poise on the court.”

Frank plans to finish up the fall
season this week, and is already
looking ahead to the spring season.

“Weneed to finish up ourround
robin challenges so that we will be
able to put our strongest six play-
ers on the court at the beginning of
the spring,” said Frank.

According to Frank, the num-
bers one, two and three slots will

be filled by Varoski, Jespersen and ~

Zabell, respectively. There are,
however, another eight players who
could conceivably fill the remain?
ing three singles positions.
Confided Frank, “We’ ve

worked harder this fall than in the
past, and I hope it will result in
increased match toughness in the
spring.”

The beginning of the spring
season is traditionally the toughest
part of the year for the Wildcats,
and this year should be no excep-
tion. They play their larger oppo-
nents and their ACC foes in the
first several matches.

As well, coach Frank is look-
ing especially toward the confer-
ence opponents,. especially
Campbell and Coastal Carolina.
“They are the two top teams in the
conference, and we haven’ t played
either of them before,” said Frank.
“I’m looking forward to confer-
ence play because the rivalries and
playing for tournament seeds will
make the matches more exciting
and fun for everyone.”

feated the N.C. State JV 7-0 over

Swedes Gun Down Cats

By BRUCE BALESTIER

Davidson was defeated 92-78
Saturday at Belk Arena by a Soder-
Basket team that simply outshot
them. Soder-Basket, a pro team
from Sweden’s first division which
is presently touring the U.S., shot
56.6% from the field andaremark-
able 12-20 from three-point range.

In fact, except for American
point guard Carl Woodard, Soder-
Basket seemed unable to do much
of anything besides shoot the ball.
Fortunately for them, they didn’t
need to. The savvy Woodard played
all 40 minutes, and distributed the
ball to the open man without fail.
Long jumpers fell with regularity
throughout the game for the
Swedes.

Soder-Basket’s: hot shooting
wasted a fantastic effort from jun-
ior guard Paul Denmond. Denmond
proved his mettle Saturday night,
scoring on jump shotsandon slash-
ing drives to the basket. He scored
30 points before fouling out late in
the game. Sophomore center Detlef
Musch chipped in with 16 points.

Coach Bob McKillop elected
to utilize a three-guard lineup
against Soder-Basket. Freshman
Pat Holloway, junior Denmondand
senior Darry Strickland comprised
the starting backcourt; Holloway
and Denmond both saw time at the
point. Sophomore J.D. Heuer and
Musch received the starting as-
signments at forward and center,
respectively.

not to play guards Sterling Free-
man and Turner Gilmore or for-
ward Paul Drobnitch, all of whom
contributed last year.

The tremendous perimeter
shooting of the Soder-Basket team
continued a trend begun by last
year’s squad: teams often shoot
the ball incredibly well against the
‘Cats. Improved perimeter defense
isamustif the Wildcats are to gain
a measure of success this season.

NOTES: A poll of the Big South’s
coaches and sports information
directors picked Davidson to fin-
