For the first time in more
than twenty years, overcrowd-
ing is forcing the. College to
house three students each in
certain rooms of Cannon and
Watts dormitories.

An enrollment increased by
sixteen students over last year
has forced the College to trans-
form eight freshman rooms
from double into triple rooms.

In order to accommodate the
students and lessen their incon-
venience, the physical plant has
constructed lofts in each of the
rooms, four each in Watts and
Cannon.

Six freshman men are also
being housed in Vincent House.

The College has also supplied
the rooms with additional furni-
ture and each of the students
with a carrel in the library.

Director of Admissions and
Financial Aid H. Edmunds
White said that ‘“‘many years
ago’’ most of the rooms in
Cannon, Sentelle, and other
dorms were actually used. as
triples though he emphasized
that this fact was not pertinent
to the College’s desicion to
increase enrollment.

He stressed rather that the
overriding factor was the bud-
get, which he said is ‘‘based on
averaging 1300 a year.

“‘We wanted to start the year
with at least 1310,” he said,
foreseeing the decline of enroll-
ment to below the 1800 level as
the year progresses and stu-
dents leave Davidson for vario-
us reasons, .

Director of Student Housing
Scotty, Nicholls emphasized
the triple rooms are not “tem-
porary quarters,” but she added
that if any freshmen withdraw,
the College would offer the

Last night, veteran student

staffers of radio station
WDAV-FM demanded that the
College administration clarify
its position on the future pro-
gramming format and policy of
the station.

At a WDAYV organizational
meeting, Student Station Ma-
nager Carrington Thompson
said that he was told by
Executive Director Don Lovell,
a member of the administration,
that WDAV’s programming

“This kind of disturbs me
since we have been told the
figure would not have to exceed
50 percent,’’ said Thompson.

Thompson asked Director of

vacated spots in the double
rooms. e

White said that the College
informed all the students prior
to their arrival that they would
be living in triple rooms and
that they all agreed to come to
Davidson under those circum-
stances.

He remarked, ‘‘I’m not say-
ing that this is ideal, but I hope
it is an acceptable situation.”

of room.”

She cited one advantage that
“things are probably a little bit
cheaper,” referring to refrigera-

Inspector slows construction

By CHARLES ERWIN
News Editor

Even though an old town ordinance kept
Davidson’s new medical building from being
finished on time this week, College officials
stressed the delay is not going to have any effect
on the quality of student health care.

According to Director of the Physical Plant
Grover C. Meetze, a local building inspector
demanded that the College comply with a fire
zone ordinance requiring all building in the
downtown area to have fire resistant walls.

The ordinance evidently got on the town books

‘during the days when commercial buildings were

being built elbow-to-elbow; a fire breaking out in
one building might have rapidly wiped out an
entire business district without something to
keep it from spreading.

But. Meetze said the medical building, which is
being built behind the post office, does not abut
any. other building and therefore does not need
fire resistant walls. .

But it has them now.

After spending several months in an unsucces-
ful attempt at overriding the inspector’s decision,
the College did make the exterior walls fire
resistent—at an added construction cost of

- $6000.

Now that that imbroglio is settled, Meetze
predicted it is going to take at four more months
to complete the building, timing which Dean of
Students Will Terry wryly observed will give the
College a ‘good Christmas present.’’

Just what does all this mean for the sophomore
with a runny nose and a fever of 102?

Very little, Terry explained.

Students will continue to be treated at the
infirmary even after the medical building is
finished. The new building is not for them; it is
for townspeople.

The College is providing the facility as part of
its plan to lure two full-time doctors with
specialized training in both internal medicine and
pediatrics into the eommunity.

The doctors—both Davidson graduates them-
selves—will use the medical building ‘for their
private practice and the infirmary for treating

~Until their office is finished, one of the two
physicians, Dr. Ron Hunt, is seeing patients in

summer by the former minister to the College

classical broadcasting, over 70
percent of total week.

The ‘‘shaded areas’’ were
time blocks devoted to the
contemporary rock program-
ming on Monday through Sa-
turday mornings known as Ra-
dio Free Davidson.

Lovell’s suggested schedule
called for 29 percent rock, 10
percent jazz, 3 percent folk and
religion, and 2 percent educa-
tional programming in addition
to the 56 percent classical
allocation.

Roberts stressed that Lo-
vell’s proposal was but a sug-
gestion, only ‘‘one approach to
the way the station could be
programmed to achieve 50 per-
cent classical.”’

New draft
released

By PAM CAMERRA
Executive Editor
“This might be it,’’ said
Professional Affairs Committee
(PAC) Secretary Brown Patter-

to consider the second draft of
the Code of Faculty Evaluation
Procedure. Patterson hopes
that the draft of the Code will
meet with final approval by
early fall. The document out-
lines criteria for evaluating
untenuréd professors.

Davidson has never had a
written procedure for evalua-
ting its professors but since T.
C. Price Zimmermann became
the Academic Vice President
last year, efforts to adopt a
procedure have intensified. Last
April Zimmermann presented
an initial draft of an evaluation
procedure to the PAC for consi-
deration.

After hearing suggestions
from faculty members and stu-
dents, the PAC met to revise
the original draft. E

“The PAC made a large
number of changes,”’ said lasts
year’s PAC chairman Alan A.
Wolf. ‘‘We simplified it in some
places. We also tried to make it
consistent with the College’s
Christian perspective without
making it so narrow as to
exclude variety.”

Their suggestions were pre-
sented to Zimmermann and
College President Samuel Spen-
cer for consideration’ early in
June. Zimmermann has comple-
ted a second draft this summer.

The PAC will also elect-a new
chairman and secretary for the
coming year at their Friday
