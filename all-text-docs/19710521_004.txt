Modest Optimism

‘After all the shduting, the cries of student an-
uish, the suspicions and the accusations, it is perhaps
itting to end this first half of our editoral year with

several positive reflections: concerning Davidson Col-
lege.

In an analysis found elsewhere in this issue, there
is displayed a modest spirit of optimism for Davidson,
a feeling of hope and goodwill that is all too often
scorned by students. Though it may seem out of edi-
torial character, we share this same spirit.

We recognize that Davidson has potential, per-
haps the greatest potential of any educational in-
stitution in the South. It is on this basic awareness
that we base our optimism and our hope for Davidson.

We also realize that Davidson is presently far
from reaching its potential. It is this very obvious
fact of life at Davidson that hurts so much, that drives
students to cynicism and ‘apathy and editors to their
typewriters.

If Davidson had little or nothing to offer, the
complaints which permeate student meetings and dis-
cussions and the criticisms which fill these pages
would be unjustified. Such is not the case, however,
for this college does have a great deal going for it,
including a top-flight faculty, a promising student
body, and some excellent facilities, offering David-
son the opportunity for an outstanding educational
experience.

The blame for this failure and refusal to strive

for the best at Davidson belongs to everyone here. .

The administration in its emphasis on the business
aspect of the college, has shown less than sincere con-
cern for the present Davidson, its students. The fac-
ulty has become -in many cases as apathetic as the
students and has failed to present a stimulating edu-
cational program. The students, above all, have allow-
ed themselves the luxury of laziness and apathy and
cynicism, and have on the whole buried any creative
impulses or stimuli behind their meaningless critical
clinches. In short, the present condition at Davidson
is not the fault of any one of us, but of all of us.

. It is significant, and "maybe even promising, that
the college’s alumni will be on campus this weekend.
It may be the beginning of a new concern here for a
true learning community, one honestly dedicated to
the goal of growth and education and to the dialogue
of life. It is our sincere hope that this is so, for this
is what Davidson should be—-and can be—all about.

_Sons And Daughters

Davidson College will not tolerate exclusiveism
on its campus. Unless. . .

The trustees have begun to draw some. very fine
lines in recent decisions. The decisions to allow fac-
ulty daughters to attend Davidson for degrees is one
example.

If Davidson does not have the’ academic pro-
grams to offer a good education to coeds, what does
it have to offer to faculty daughters? Are faculty
daughters more qualified than other peoples’ daugh-
ters? Would it follow that faculty sons are more quali-
fied to attend than other peoples’ sons?

We can only hope that the trustees will act soon
and definitely, which ever way they decide, after they
évaluate the results of their cautious experimentation
in coeducation.

fal

In. Numerical Order

In the administration’s eternal quest for effici-
ency they might borrow a page from the federal gov-
foanent? book under the chapter heading of num-

ers.

We probably have enough numbers floating
around in our wallets, from driver’s licenses to draft
cards to credit cards.

Davidson has not spared the set of numbers either
with student numbers, laundry numbers and the
ephemeral “alpha number” so vital to maintaining
our educational ‘system:

It seems that the social security number of each
student, a gift of the government, could replace the
numbers the college doles out. The social security
number could. serve to replace the several different

numbers and insure each student a singularly unique

digit.

Davidson Deserves

More

Than Footbali Team B.O.

Next year, the alumni of
this college and the..college
itself will purchase a-Guarter
of ‘a million dollars worth of
sweat. That iis tthe price of
the football program.

Very few students realize
thiat they have to pay a great
deal to keep football here.

The Wildcat Club, managed
by ex-football player Steve
Heckard, was supposed to
raise money to offset the ex-
pense of the quarter million
dollar budget this year. His
efforts failed. The trustees
had to pay $80,000 this year
to baill out the team, and at
the same time, they raised
tuition to pay that expense.

(But next year, the college
will -still pay $150,000 of the
football expense out of gen-
eral college funds. If you do
simple \arithmetic, you'll see
that dach student will be
charged about $75 to pay for
If you believe what they
say, students pay iabout half
of the costs of their David-
son education. iIf the college
budgets $150,000 for football,
then $75,000. iis the Half stu-
dents pay, or $75 per student.

I wonder if every student
here wants that much of hiis

' money to go to footbiall.

There are many reasons
for being upset with the foot-
‘alll team other than the fact
that it loses most..of its
games.

One iis that we cannot pro-
vide coeducation at the
school because we haven't
got enough money.

When football team mem-
bers need to use la car for
some special reason, they
have jaccess 'to cars operated
by the aithletic department.

H. Edmunds White is so in-

- terested iin football thiait hie

decided that football players
can use practice time as
their work-study job time.

This is probably a_ viola-
tion of Fedenal laws dealing
with work-study money, but
Mr. White, like everybody
else, obviously doesn’t mind
breaking 1a Jaw for his pet in-

LETTER

terest in football. (I wish he
would develop pet interests
in minority group students,
artists, Sduth ‘Asia special-
ists, and people from other
parts of the country!).
Despite the claim by the

‘" Admissions’ Department that

all football students meet all
academic requirements, we
know that ithis is not the
case.

The football team mem-
bers certainly have ia large
staff of coaches and tiiainers
at their disposial. Yet the col-
lege hias not money to hire

selling work with students.

Overall, the academic’ in-
teresits of this institution are
frequently undermined by
this football program, Coach
Dave Fagg has referred to
this place as ian ‘intellectual
joint,’’ which sounds vague-
ly similar to Lefty Driesell's
famous comment, ‘*Whait’s
fall this academic B. S. any
way?”’

Coach Pagg is salso quite
oblique concerning hair

and the is known ito utter

and about’ how you have ‘to
be ia big jock to be a man.

This Saturday at 3 p.m.
the football department has
arranged a _ varsityialumni
game.

The purpose of this is ob-
viously not to give alumni a
chance to piay, but to give
them a chance to give mon-
ey for football.

I encourage ialumnii to give
no money whaisoever to foot-
ball, and I encourage ‘them
to realize, as. Professor Wil-
liam Arrowsmith recently
wrote tbout the ‘alumni of
the University of Texas, that
some alumni would be more
concerned if the football
team had a ijosing season
than if the university lost
one hundred of its faculty
members. :

Alumni should give -rfioney
for coeducation and the de-
velopment of educational pro-
grams on campus, and not
for football.

It is merely my contention
that the strength of an insti-

‘ion should be founded up-
on something more subsian
tial than B,. O.

Students Should Protest
ROTC Vandals’ Action

To the Editor:-
Portest viandialism
Before the smoke bomb in-
cident is officially closed, I
think two points should be
mentioned which
have been overlooked.
First, what might seem an
Jinexpensive prank was, in
fact, not harmless and jinex
pensive. The wills hiad to be
repainted and the building
generally cleaned, all of
which cost at least $1000.
Secondly and more impor:
tant, ‘the situation created by
the smoke bomb was poten-
tially very dangerous. Often
when there is sa
fire, people panic,

seem — to

threat of
rushing

down stairs and out tthe builld-
ing. Those who fiall are tram-
pled. Fortunately, this did
not occur, but it could have.

Let me add a note here
because e*vents occurred
since the above paragrapbs
were written. This past week
someone smeared paint all
over the outside of the ROC
building door. Also, cars.
were splattered with the
black paint.

This sort of action is repre-
hensible; it is disgusting and
sick. I can only hope that
Diavidson students will rise
up ‘against this ‘sort of thing.

Subsidized Football Drains

To the Editor:

Last year the Board of
Trustees decided that funds
for football scholarships
should be raised through the
Wildcat Club. Coming off its
best season ever in 1969 -
70, the football. program has
not received the hoped for
response from alumni.

In the face of an assort-
ment. of excuses, the college
has generously offered to
cover the. deficit of abou’
$80,000. (Approximately half
of this figure represents need,
based on the average fi-
mancial aid for the entire
student: body.)

It seems that in these days
of tight money, Davidson is
willing to make great sacri.

fices to prop up subsidized
football while other areas
suffer, for example the clin-
ical psychologist whose con-
tract was not renewed, and
the delay in making co-edu-
cation a reality.

Already 45 football play-
ers, receiving an average
scholarship of $1344.00, have
been signed for next year’s
freshman class. Defenders of
the program contend that the
abundance of athletes in
each class makes fora well
rounded student body.

But in an all male,
predominantly ‘jock. school,
would not co-education round
out the student body some-
what more fully?

Has the college ever con-

Money From Other Areas _

sidered a well organized,
highly subsidized recruiting
effort aimed at signing 45
black students? Without sub-
sidized football would David-
son really become a flabby
collection of eggheads?

We feel that.the expense of
subsidized football ($169,910
annually for scholarships, in
addition to coaches’: salaries,
equipment and facilities, re-
cruiting expenses and operat-
ing costs) is too great, re-
gardless of ithe source of the
funds.
