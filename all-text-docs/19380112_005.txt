THE DAVIDSONIAN

Question
of ike Week

People will talk. And they have

been talking for the past week or

so about holding the Davidson -
Carolina basketball game in Char-
lotte. As usual, some are for, and
some are against; but the general
consensus of opinion runs almost
unanimously to the fact that Dav-
students have to
pay for the contests staged in the

Queen City.

idson shouldn't

And the thing which most favor
definitely is field
the would
eliminate the necessity for playing

a new g£YmM or

house on campus which
games elsewhere.

Here

question : in favor
of holding the basketball
games in Charlotte?”

(Incidentally, we had

ood
Ludlow

Congress,

a
question worked up on the

referendum
but the

proposal in

House of Representatives

killed the bill before we could get
the paper out).
Tony Shelby, Senior: :
pliteeetl oe seem
that we should
have a decent
place to sponsor
home | basketball
games on our own
campus, but-at the

present we haven’t a place to do so.

To have visiting teams on the cam-!

pus of Davidson with all its his-
tory and tradition should be an
‘honor to studénts. who. are less
privileged However, when the

visiting teams, as well as our own,
have to rebound from the walls of

the building, such is certainly

not

the case
I~ personally > believe that we
should have our basketball games
in Charlotte, just as we have our

dances, because Davidson obvious-

ly does not possess

the facilities.”
