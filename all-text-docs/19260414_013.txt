Common to all the peoples on earth, there
are three passions that animate human life
and motivate all that is finest and most en-
during in human endeavor.

They correspond to three essential elements
of human nature.

The first of these springs from the Spirit-
ual instinct. It is man's jealous passion for
his religious conviction. His love for God
as he conceives him to be. .

She's the

She loves the cave-man, not the sheik,
Nor any that's faint at heart—

for the land of his birth.

These three passions are sanctioned in the
Divine commandments.

And, in the last phase of the same com-

mand, He gave the motive for the third of
the three great human passions when He
said: “Do this—honory try father and thy

mother... that thy days may be long in the
land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.”

To have these three passions is to possess
a guarantee of that fullness of life that is our
natural desire.

To be without any one of them is to be
incomplete.

Love of one’s country—the passion which
aims to serve one’s country; either in de-
from invasion, or protecting its
rights, and maintaining its lows and institu-
tions in vigor and purity—is patriotism.

fending it

Patriotism is the characteristic of a good
citizen; the noblest passion that animates a
man in the character of a citizen.

Christ was a good citizen—a patriot. He
lived, serving and defending the Kingdom of
God on earth, maintaining its laws in vigor
and purity. He died, that the institutions of
God's Kingdom, the Church and the Holy
Sacraments, might be established.

That was the first of the four great dramas
that have been written in the Book of Life
of every American young man and woman of
the present and all future generations.
Christ upon the cross—Columbus guided

an inspired intelligence—The Patriots
signing the American Declaration of Inde-
pendence and, again—The Patriots, bleeding
and dying on Flanders Field, in the dark
forests of the Argonne; writing in their life's
blood another declaration—the declaration
that Freedom Shall Not Perish From the
Earth: Such are the traditions of our peo-
ple, a people who have received a Land from
the hand of God if such a fulfillment of the
Divine Word has ever come to pass, a people
who have honored their fathers, served their
country, and striven to defend it and keep
its institutions vigorous and pure.

These are your traditions. They are a part
of your environment by inheritance. They
are the four corner-stones of the foundation
on which your structure of life will be built.

It is very fitting that your Alma Mater,
who has given so generously to the environ-
ment of the temporal as well as the spiritual
life of the Nation; whose campus knew the
young manhood of that world-commanding
personality—Woodrow Wilson, and whose
very name is taken from the supreme sacri-
fice.of one who fell in battle that the In-
stitutions of Freedom might be established,
should, in its curriculum provide those op-
portunities now offered you in the name of
the R. O. T. C., to strengthen in yourselves
moral qualities, and, by practice and study,
to acquire ability to serve more efficiently in
whatever walk of life you may be called.

With confidence in America, I am,

Your fellow citizen,
F. W. Rowell,
Colonel of Infantry, United States Army.
