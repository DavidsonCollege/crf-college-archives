The addition of three new profes-
sors to the Davidson faculty is an
event which means much to the col-
z|lege. These new men are Dr. Fraz-
Hier Hood, Dr. Edwin J. Erwin, and
am) Dr. E. A. Byers.

The institution could hardly have
m}made a better choice, for all, these
professors are men who are fully
prepared to instruct in their res-
pective subjects.

Ponsi Out-classed.

The whole country admires
Ponzi’s financial ability and call
him a genius. His was a fine get*
rich-quick scheme but not to be
compared to that of our own Abe,

has sure missed a fine scoop. Here's
where the Davidsonian put one over

CAMPUSSISMS.

The old campus is as green as
ever and the same can be said of
the Fresh.

Mr. G. R. Dupree of Red Springs
visited his old alma mater last week
for the purpose of entering his son
in the freshman class.

Jack Black and Robson 19, have
been at work on Sprunt Field late-
ly helping Coach Grey whip the
Wildcats into shape.

Miss Grace James a niece of Dr.
Douglass has returned to Win-
throp.

Where, Oh, where were the
parades?

Once again the ladies “ring-up:”
Two smiling “co-eds” are here.
They are Miss Wilma F. Cashion
and Miss Annie Caldwell; and come
from the village of Cornelius. Miss
Wilma is a sister of E. G. Cash-

ion, °22

Mr. Jackson says “they” are cot-
tages; the “Hill” has dubbed them
“Barracks.” Whatever might be
their real name—those new dor-
mitories are pretty nifty.

OQ. C. Williamson °18 of Union
Seminary is on the Hill for a few
days. “Just to look around,” says

“Sec” Lacy has begun training
for the 1921 Track Squad.

It is moved and seconded that
there be no drilling on the front
campus.
