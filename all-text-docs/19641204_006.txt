Sigma Nu Retains
Blood Drive Title

The Sigma Nus retained their
blood drive contest lead as the
fall blood drive last Monday and
Tuesday netted 300 pints of
blood. This drive proved to be
the most successful ever ac-
cording to statistics released by
the ROTC department.

An ROTC department spokes-
man commented, “This substan-
tial increase in blood donation
reflects a more conscientious
effort on the part of the stud-
ents." The blood drive held
during last spring yielded 268
pints.

There were 75 students willing
but unable to give blood be-
cause of recent illness and 30
students who were eliminated
because of athletic excuses.

Following the Sigma Nus in
competition were the Phi Gams.

Speaking at the opening gen-
eral session today is Dr. David
P. Henry. president of the Uni-
versity of Illinois. The luncheon
speaker today is Dp. Noah N.
Langdale. president ‘of Georgia
State College, who will be a
chapel speaker at Davidson on
Dec. 17.

Bob Jones, Assistant Dean of
Students. is attending several
separate gatherings of college
deans during the conference.
“The value of tnese meetings.”
said Jones, ‘‘is that I will have
‘a chance to meet other college
deans all over the country to
discuss the fraternity situation,
and I hope to find out what
various fraternities over the na-

tion are doing and can de to con-
tribute to college life.

Jones also added, ‘‘The meet-
ing will give me the opportunity
to make contact with various
national and local fraternity of-
ficers, represented at Davidson,
and to‘ gain some general know-
ledge of the fraternity world.”

Fred Sackett. secretary of the
Davidson IFC, is the delega‘-
from Davidson to the confer-
ence, and Rocky Walker is Dav-
idson's alternate delegate. Sack-
ett has been chosen as one of
the 20 undergraduate delegates
to be a convention leader.

In this capacity he will lead
discussion groups and oversee
the business of the conference.
Sackett said. “My discussion

into the Basic Philosophy of Uni-

the Sig Eps, the ATO's and thej versities?’ and ‘The Rolé of the

Poland finds herself in that
most precarious geographic posi-
tion of separating Asia from
Europe and retaining excellent
access to the sea. Before World
War II, Poland was fascist, and

drained completely by an aris-
tocracy which boasted even as
late as August, 1939 that ‘our
weakness is our strong point—
Germany does not want and
will not take a weak poor count-
ry." Despising Germans Jong
before they crossed the border
and fearing just as much the
new ecenomic reform in Russia
(Communism), the Poles caught
destruction from both sides and
caught jit heavily. After the
war, 8 per cent of most Polish
cities lay in waste and rubble
and millions of Poles had died

In addition to leading discus-
sions, Sackett and alternate.
Rocky Walker. plan to hand out|
questionnaires to
tives of various colleges and
universities which are to be fill-
ed out and returned to Davidson.

“These questionnaires are in-
tended to find out about the role
of the fraternity system in ‘so-
cial life, rush and rush regula-
tlons, and the function of vari-
ous interfraternity councils. By
the use of these questionnaires
and by making direct contact
with fraternity representatives
from all over the country we
hope to gain information which
can be presented to the Student
Council committee studying so-
cial life at Davidson,” Sackett
added.

“Awards will be given to var-
ious interfraternity councils at
this conference, similar to the
award won in 1961 by the David-
sonr College IFC,” remarked
Jones. This award was present-
ed to Davidson in 1961 for hav-
ing the best interfraternity
council in the nation in a school
having less than 15 fraternities
on campus.

Sackett commented. ‘Because
of the role the Davidson IFC
has in this conference, and by
the role the IFC plays this year
in campus social life, we hope to
be able to win the Ironmans
Trophy next year.” This tro-
phy. is presented to the best in-
terfraternity council in the na-
tion.

have difficulty giving.’

This year’s basketball adver-
tising campaign, according to
the publicity director, is being
run a little differently than was
last year’s. “Our advertising
was more game by game last
year,” he noted. “This year we
are directing our efforts more
to season ticket sales.”

The altered approach seems
to be working successfully.
While a larger percentage of to-
tal volume has been in season
tickets, the over-all sales figures
are far ahead of last year's.
Said Blackwell, ‘Our campaign
is to make sure that no one
fails to know last year's re-
cord.”

As far as material to national
publications is concerned, .he
reported that this. was about
the same as last year. “I have
no complaints about last year's
reception; we had something to
prove nationally. As for Sports
Wustrated type features, there’s
not 'much more you can do than
be ready for such breaks."

Blackwell noted the use his of-
fice has made of college busi-
ness and mailing equipment and
the good job of the secreterial
staff. “We are close to the
point that we are doing a cred-
itable job but help is still need-
ed.”’ he said.

Continuing on the same line,
he pointed out, “I don’t know
what should be Davidson's an-
swer. Sports information does
deserve as much staff attention
as most other schools give it.
Basketball can be hurt on pub-
lic support if this job fails
through.”

IDCRC Outlines Plan
, *|To Build Community

Bv DAVID COFFEV

Davidsonian

Staff Writer

“Our basic overall plan now is to help the Negro
community become a real community where the people

are truly working to help themselves,”

explained Calvin

Zon, president of the re-oriented Davidson Civil Rights

Committee.
“As it is now. the Davidson

We are now concerned with the
entire range of economic, hous-
ing. and educational problems.”

The DCRC was formed in the

‘| fatt of 1963, primarily by facul-

ty and students. The group is

now attempting to place more
and more responsibility on the

Negro community. ‘‘This shift
across the tracks will avoid the

development of a paternalistic
attitude on the part of the white
community,” Zon hopes.

} “One of our basic problems
has been developing leaders in
the Negro community,” he con-
tinued. “The most likely lead-
ers in the past have been resi-
dents of Charlotte who have held
jobs here. Their place of resl-
dence precludes their becoming
leaders here.”

The civil rights group worked
to increase voter registration
and to enlarge the vote of the
Negro community in the recent
election. They urged Negroes to
vote for Johnson-Humphrey, for
Bob Scott as Lieutenant-Govern-
or, and for Dr. William James
for congressman. They also urg-
ed support of the 100 million
dollar school bond issue. Zon
says, “The results are hard to
judge, but we believe the vote
turnoat was greater than it
would have been if we had not
acted.”

The DORC is also planning to
conduct a raffle for a color tele-
vision set. Proceeds will be us-
ed to open a laundromat in Dav-
idson. ‘Currently, the Negroes
here have to go to Charlotte
to wash their clothes since the

laundromat in Cornelius is seg-
regated.” Zon says.

Consideration is also being
given to the housing problem in
Davidson. Most usable land in
the immediate area is owned by
a few local citizens or has been
purchased by the College or the
Duke Power Company for fu-
ture expansion. “It is difficult
for a Negro to find a place to
build,”’ Zon contends. “Our con-
cern is primarily the land short-
age, and not necessarily any ra-
cial discrimination in real estate
sales,””

Frafernities Give
To United Appeal

The United Appeal drive clos-
ed recently netting approxim-
ately eight times as much as
last year’s drive, according to
Walter Edgar, spokesman for
Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity, the
sponsoring organization. The
amount collected, $120.05, eyual-
ed last year's goal.

The drive this year was car-
ried out with a different ap-
proach from last year. The ap-
peal was made through the fra-
ternities and Lingle Manor rath-
er than through a door to door
erffot.

The social organizations con-
tributing were Betds. Kappa
Sigs, Phi Gams, Pi Kapps, Pi-
kas. Sigma Nu's, Sig Eps.

SAE’s. Sigma Chis, and Lingle
Manor. Also a small amount
was contributed by individuals
through the collection bucket in
the Union.
