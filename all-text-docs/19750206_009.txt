Catamounts Edge Cats
As Decisions Run Close

By MARK SCANDLING
Staff Writer

Last Friday night, the David-
son wrestlers went down to the
wire against Western Carolina.
The contest was not decided un-
til the final match.

Going into the heavyweight
match the Cats trailed 22-16. A
pin by Jack Summe would have
tied the match.

Summe was not able a defeat
his heavier opponent, and the
grapplers dropped their sixth
dual meet by the score.of 28-16.

Parker termed the match ‘‘a
good one to watch, but a disap-
pointing one to lose.”’ The loss to
Western Carolina ended the
Cat’s hopes for a_ winning
season.

Mike Dosal started the Cats
off, with a 12-1 superior
decision. Dosal has been
wrestling well in the last few
matches according to his team-
mates.

Brian Jacobs and Glenn
Bollard both lost superior
decisions. These two losses put
Davidson behind 8-4.

Captain Bob Jacobs, who was
wrestling with a painful hip in-
jury, rode his man to victory.
Jacobs was awarded one point
riding time. This one pont gave
Jacobs a 5-4 victory. Jacobs’
record now stands at 8 and 3.

Riding time was important in
the 150 lb. clash, also. Mark
Scandling received one point
riding time which enabled him
to a pull out a 10-10 tie. In his 158
lb. bout, Bob Price came from
behind to defeat:his opponent 8-
5.

Ralph Holloway destroyed his
foe by the lopsided score of 15-2.
Ralph’s win put the Cats ahead
by a margin of six points.

The Catamounts quickly tied
the match, as Roger Brown was
pinned. Brown, a freshman, is
wrestling in a class 10 lbs. over
his weight, and has had the
misfortune of wrestling the best
wrestlers on the opposing team
several times this year.

The Wildcats forfeited the 190
Ib. weight, and this put the
Catamounts ahead by the score
of 22-16.

In the last match, Jack Sum-
me was beaten by the same
move twice. The second time
his heavier opponent got a pin
out of the move.

Parker felt that had Summe
not been caught by the same
move a second time, he, might
have pinned his tired opponent.

Tonight the Cats travel to
South Carolina. The Cats will be
seeking their third dual meet
win. The wrestlers do not know
much about their opponents,

‘Aggressive Play’ Sparks Cats
In Richmond, WVU Efforts

By CHARLIE SLAGLE
Staff Writer

Davidson’s basketball team
bounced back after its worst
home defeat ever to almost win
a rugged away game and then
win big in a home Southern Con-
ference contest.

The big loss for the Wildcats
came at the hands of the Duke
Blue Devils at the Coliseum.
When the smoke had cleared,
Duke was a clear winner 113-76.

Davidson attempted to keep
up with the pace of the A.C.C.
team, and it looked at the half
as if they might be able tu do it.
as Duke only led 46-40.

Duke, however, exploded
early in the second half and

built up a huge lead. This was

the first game in which Davia-
son attempted consciously to
run with the opposition.

The Blue Devils shot a’

phenomenal 64 percent from th
field for the game. They were
led by senior guard Kevin Bil-
lerman who tallied 22 points.
Four other Duke players scored
in double figures, including Bob
Fleischer who also added 18
recounds.

Davidson, on the other hand,
shot only 40 percent from the
field. The Davidson scoring was
headed by Larry Horowitz and
Greg Duunn who both had 18
points. Tom Verlin also pitched
in 12 points.

Davidson then left on that
sour note and headed for the
Morgantown, West Virginia to
play West Virginia University.
Davidson had never beaten the
Mountaineers at their mountain
home, and this did not look as if
it would be the time.

Davidson played well in the
first half after being down as
much as 9 and only trailed 47-44
at the intermission.-A forward
for each team dominated the
first half as Stan Boskovich
from WVU had 18 and Larry
Horowitz had 14.

The Wildcats surged at the
beginning of the second half and
went ahead by as much as 7 at
64-57. The Mountaineers had
never given up and came back

to win 97-92.

Ninety-two points by David-
son was the most that the Wild-
cats. had scored in a single
Zame ali year. Head coach Bo
Brickels said that ‘a couple
of lapses let it get away from

us’”’ and that was the story of the

game.

The leading scorer for the
game was Stan Boskovich who
scored 40, 16 of which came
from the foul line.

Horowitz led Davidson with 29
points. He was followed in the
scoring by Jay Powell, Tom
Verlin, and Kevin Doherty who
had 15,14, and 12 respectively.

Davidson then came back
home for a game against the
Richmond Spiders who had
beaten the Cats 67-62 back in
December. Davidson again
came out running but this time
everything went right, as the
Wildcats won 103-79.

Davidson built up a big lead in
the first half, and then Rich-

mond ran off 14 points to tie the.

score.

According to assistant coach
Harry Krohn it was ‘“‘a let down
of the defense that hurt David-
son’’.

When asked about the new
running style which Davidson
has adopted, Krohn said that it
is not much different, but that
Davidson is now ‘advancing
the ball up the floor and hitting
the open man.”’

Krohn also stated that
theoretically this is the way the

in 75?

coaches wanted the team to
play. Davidson has ‘loosened
up offensively” and, the team is
not as ‘“‘plan conscious’’. Krohn
also said that before this David-
son was too “‘robotish”’.

One player that has been
helped by the Davidson new
loose style is Horowitz, who
against Richmond again hit 29
points. This leaves him only 64
points shy of 1,000 points in his
career. Dunn hit his 1,000th
against Notre Dame earlier this

year.

Against Richmond, David-
son’s two big men, Eppa Rixey
and Sheldon Parker, accounted
for 21 points and 17 rebounds be-
tween them. Krohn attributed
the big men’s play to their being

“more aggressive every time
out on floor’ and, ‘‘they
went after the boards’’.

Jay Powell and Dunn also hit
double figures for the Wildcats
as the team hit on 58.8 percent
of their shots from the field.

Davidson would like to con-
tinue the style of play they had
against Richmond when they
take on East Carolina at Green-
ville tomorrow night. East
Carolina handed Davidson: its
worst Johnston Gym defeat
ever three weeks ago, and the
Cats hope to turn the tables on
them.

Davidson needs to win the
E.C.U. game to. still have a
chance at playing the first
round of the Southern Con-
ference tournament at home.
