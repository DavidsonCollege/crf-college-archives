An open meeting of the
college community to discuss
self-scheduled examinations has
been set for Wednesday at 6:30
pm in Chambers Gallery. Stu-
dent Government Association
President Bruce Brown
announed the meeting, to be
sponsored by the SGA.

Brown said the meeting’s
format: has yet to ‘be worked
out, but that it is designed to
“increase communication on the
matter between faculty and
students.”

Brown sressed the impor-
tance of student participation in
the meeting saying ‘‘Discussion
has raised the question that
students might. not have been
as active in supporting the
honor cide as they sould have
honor code as they should have
been.”

“It is up. to the student,-to
prove! that the honor systenttan: , ~

He feels that such proof
would be very instrumental in =
retaining self-scheduled exam- ~
inations at Davidson.

Brown said he strongly op-
poses any action to permit
scheduled exams.

He said he feels that although
self-scheduled exams are a fea-
ture of the honor system and ,
not an integral part ‘“‘the honor
system would survive without
self-scheduled exams, but it
would ibe substantially
weaker.’’

‘‘Self-scheduled exams are’
the boldest expression of: the «
honor system.”

He said he doubted that
either optional or mandatory
scheduling of exams would ¢ut
down on cheating.

Hundreds of students

Rumors that self-scheduled
exams were about tobe abol-
ished brought an estimated
300 students to an open-end
meeting in the Union Tuesday
morning. The rumors were ap-
parently started by two faculty
proposals concerning self-
scheduled exams.

One of the proposals, a
recommendation by the Educa-
tional Policy Committee, called
for the faculty to “‘reaffirm its
approval of self-scheduled ’ex-
aminations.

The other proposal, in the
form of a petition signed by
eleven faculty members, would
have formally given professors
the option of scheduling their
own examinations.

In its meeting that afternoon
the faculty voted overwhelm-
ingly to table both proposals-
until its next meeting on March
13,

“ning, History Professor David
Shi read to the audience the
faculty petition to establish a
dual system of exams. Under
this system professors would
have the recognized option of
either scheduling or not schedu-
ling their final exams. Those
who. chose to do so would
schedule their exams according
-to a schedule published by the
Registrar’s office.

The petition cited three rea-
sons for the establishment of a
dual system: the system ‘“‘puts

Housing innovations to involve triples for upperclassmen next fall

By DONALD CALDWELL

Although none of Next year’s freshmen
will be rooming in triples, housing for
Davidson students will remain very tight in
the next few years.

Scottie Nichols, College Director of
Housing, admitted “I think last year we
adopted freshmen triples with misgivings.
Sue Ross, Will Terry and I were hesitant
about it, but it was necessary to keep from
turning students away.”

But upper classmen won't be quite so
lucky... Several rooms on the fourth floor of
Belk dorm as well as parts of several
college owned houses on Main street will
be modified to accomodate three upper--
classmen where previously two had lived.

Selection of one of these triples in
April's lottery is purely voluntary though
the Student Housing Office is reducing
room rates for them to provide an
incentive for interested upperclassmen.

One far reaching change next year will being planned.

Terry stated ‘In the past we have been
budgeting for 1300 students for which we
needed to begin the year at 1320, based on

- an expected decrease in student popula-

tion through the year.”’

“This year we will be budgeting on a
basis of 1290 students, meaning we need
to be housing 1310 in September: The fact
that we have to allow for the slight’
decrease in student population explains a
lot of the overcrowding during early

‘So it’s not possible to solve the
housing shortage just by cutting the
number of students admitted. And even
the smallest decrease in income would
mean cutting back on some services.”

While the lower target figure may ease
the crunch in the short term, no new
dorms or mee pure hases are presently

“There is a crying need for dorm space.
I think prospects for a major new dorm are
slim in view of interest rates and the
possibility of a recession next year. We are
looking into dorm space for about 50
students if-we can find adequate financ-
ing. President Spencer is presently trying
to have government regulations on loans
for college dormatory construction revised
to give smaller colleges like Davidson
equal treatment in getting federal loans.
Right now, the Housing and Urban
Development department’ s regulations
favor large universities.”

Many students at all three

Sex blind policy
proposed again

By RICK JENKINS
News Editor

For the second time in six
months, a proposal has been
initiated to end sexual quotas in
admissions policy at Davidson.

“RESOLVED: That the pre-
sent policy of enrolling approxi-
mately 250 male and 110 female
students in each entering class
be replaced by an equal access
policy which does not impose a
set ratio of male to female
students, and is in all other
repsects in line with the present
admissions policy .”’

The above resolution is part
of the proposal for an equal
access admissions policy at
Davidson introduced Feb. 6 by
the College’s chapter of the
National Organization for Wo-
men” (NOW). The proposal is
currently under review of the
Advisory Committee on Admis-
sions.

NOW member Nancy Warren
said, ‘‘NOW feels that the
admissions goal of Davidson,
which is to admit. the best
qualified applicants based on
cations, is violated by the
present sex-based quota sys-

““‘We (NOW) feel that an
