Generals Run Wild
Over Crippled Cats

By BILL ADAMS

Washington and l.ee’s Generals
put on a brilliant exhibition of run-
nag and passing supremacy to
soundly thrash a crippled band oi
Davidson Wildcats 53-0 before a
Homecoming crowd of 4500 at Lex.
ington *:. a Southern Conference
battle Saturday.

Starting off fairly well by driving
to the W&L 22 early in the first
quarter, the Wildcats faded and
were never in the game again from
that point on.

bor the best W&1.-team, it was a
convincing rebound from a 4-game
lo-isigg streak and a personal tri-
umph for Gil Boretti, their preci-
sion-like sophomore quarterback.
He ran up a total of 340 yards on
oil. nse as he personally scored 3 of
W&1.'s touchdowns and passed for
ano her.

After warding off Davidson's ear.
ly threat, the Generals started the
w chdown parade in a = dazzling
wesniner by sending Boretti through
iavlhte tor 60 yards and his first TD.

Scull in the first quarter, W&L
f£eneraced a drive to the Davidson
hi from where Bennett circled left
end for the score on the first play
of the second quarter. Moment:
later, W&I. moved 55 yards in 4
plays for the third score, with the
TD voming on a 38 yard pass from
Baretti to Hedge,

The fourth score was set up by
a pass interception, making the half
lime score 27.0.

With only three minutes of the
third quarter gone, Boretti bucked
over from the two for the ‘fifth
touchdown and later in the same
quarter, Mastriann rammed into the
Davidson end zone from the three

after Boretti’s passes had put thef.

Generals in scoring position again.

The Generals, pushed over two
mere six-pointers in the final stan.
za, with their last scoring play car-
rying 78 yards on a pass from Wat.
ers to Marler.

Ham Wade was the workhorse:

for the Davidson offense, sadly
lacking in punch without Lambeth’s
passing. In the line, Jimmy Fasul
played his best game in trying to
make up for the loss of regulars
Sharpe, Chandler and Eborn, but
it was just a case of too much
Washington and Lee power.

thing definitely done to stop drink-

games.: Having attended the Caro-
lina-Tennessee game this past week
end, I am forced to agree with Bill
Johnson, the writer of this particu-
lar article. Here are just a few
happenings which will prove our

point.

One student, arriving before the
game, was: already so far gone
that he had to be helped to his
seat in Row X of the card sectiort.

Nell Johnson of Queens with Dave
Whitener.

Rather than racing into Char-
lotte between the game and the
dance for our regular banquet, the
members of our houschold decided
this time to have, a buffet supper
at the house. Thanks to Brothers
Keever and Davis and the Katter.
ette, it really went over swell; Real
eats and multi fun had by all hands.
Another big event at the C. C.
house Homecoming was the break-
fast after the formal. Danken Sie
Herr. Pharr, and Mrs. Pharr, for
furnishing your kitchen help. Yep,
in every department C. C. soared
to an all-time high. Couldn’t help
it with such luscious inspiration!

Beginning November 8, the
tribe of the Campus Club is to
have a boarding house of their
own. Friend Dick Harris is to be
the manager, and thanks to Tom
Loman, Al Gerhardt, Boyce Ken-
dall, Bob Burroughs, Ernie Strick-
lin and multi others for their end-
less work. Let’s ali give them a
hand for their efforts for the good
of the C. C,

Things have quieted down since
the week-end of the Parade of Pro-
gress. Our freshmen are not seen
around the house much except for
tutoring, etc., in preparation for
those awful reviews. Thus far all
are doing well, thastks to Dave
Deck and his scholar’s outfit.

‘Twas nice being with you—see
you as soon as the editors of said
newspaper grants us space.

Clue of the Week: Ask George
Bason how he enjoyed the Caro-

he and several friends finished one
pint and had gotten around — to
breaking the seal on another. By
half-time he had made remarks
about most of the coeds. and stu-
dent’s wives near him. Foftunate.
ly someone got with him and nurs-
ed him for the rest of the ball game
or else there would probably have
been a great deal of trouble.
Another student, equally inebre-
ated and even more disgusting, was
seated a few seats away in row
BRB. Throughout the latter part of
the game he adopted a bit of pro.
fanity, made famous a few months
back by Harry Truman, and loudly
applied it to everyone in the sta-
dium except Choo Choo. Several
students with their wives and dates
were forced to give up their seats
and leave the game when it became
evident that this character's only
purpose in coming to the game was

possible.

You better be glad you are a
Davidson student and don’t have to
contend with this.

plainly to make some sugrestions
