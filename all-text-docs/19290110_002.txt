Delta Theta Chi having received
Phi Delta Theta charter, The David-
sonian extends most hearty congrat-
ulations.

If one might judge by discussions
of parallel and of term papers plus
extras, it might be thought that the
end of the term were near. How
about it?

And we would suggest that the
best mid-winter method of showing
that Wildcat spirit would be to put
this band uniform drive over in
short order.

Every other college paper that
we have received has had at least
one editorial advising what and what
not to do in 1929, We know you
wouldn’t follow the advice even if
you happened to read it and so we
won't indulge.

EI ean \
WHAT CRITERION, IF ‘ANY

As the time for changes in elec-
tive coursese approaches we are won
dering somewhat as to the motives
governing the undergraduate’s
choice of this subject and elimina-
tion of another. The combinations
of oftentimes decidedly heterogenu-
ous courses reminds us of thé stu-
dent who was. taking courses in
dairying, music appreciation, draft-
nor was held higher than the second
ing, ancient history and sociology be-
cause no class came béfore 10 a. m.
floor of the main building.

Students often find their courses
deficient in subjects required but
this is not so frequent as hearing
one near graduation bemoaning the
fact that his course was not more
fuly planned so that he might have
been better equipped either for
graduate work or for some voca-
tion.

Professors and advanced students
are glad of opportunities to ‘offer
helpful suggestions to those who are
doubtful as to what to elect. And
if you want crips, they can tell you
something about the motto.

CAUSE TO REJOICE
When the final whistle sounded

at the Pasadena Rose Bowl on New
Year’s Day, something of signal im-
portance to all devotees of sport in
the Southland had taken place. Once
again the name of Dixie had been
blazed across the athletic horizon
in very definite symbols of worth.
Georgia’s Tech’s spectacular victory
over Andy Price’s: Golden Bears
should arouse a peculiar sense’ of
pride in every one of us, because it
proves to the world that Southern
teams are competition aplenty for
the best.
Three years ago Alabama’s Crim-
son Tide surprised the whole nation
and paved the way. for future fame
of the South, but since then, such
le strides have been taken

in every direction and field of sport

to review some of them. Time was,
and not so long ago, when the big
universities of the East scheduled
games with southern teams merely
for workouts, and it was an impos-
sible idea that the underdogs had
even a good chance to win. Little
recognition was given the South
when it came to picking All-Ameri-
can Teams, or even to giving honor-
able mention.

Look around now and witness
just about the classiest lot of native-
born athletes ever assembled under
the same sky. Young Stribling and
Ad Warren in the ring—Ed Hamm,
Galen Elliot, Henry Cummings,
John Currie and Charlie Baskins
on the track—Bobby Jones supreme
on the links—Tech, Tennessee, Flor-
ida on the gridiron, with Tech alone
having six men mentioned for All-
American—the big leagues literally
full of young bloods straight from
the South—basketball getting better
every year. Quite an imposing ar-
ray, isn’t it? The South has ar-
rived to stay.

We are mighty proud of The
Golden Tornado and are glad to
welcome those Rambiln’ Wrecks on
behalf of Davidson. We think there
will be a lot more conquering heroes
returning in years to come. Perhaps
our own Wildcats will return from
the United States Military Academy
in something of the same manner.
Anyway they will be keeping pace
with everybody, and in football any-
thing can happen.

CASTE OF TRADITION

There are oftem principles which
become so firmly established in given
institutions and so embodied in cus-
tom and habit that the members of
that institution never stop to inquire
if there is a sound reason for those
principles or whether they are good
in practice.

Such is the situation at Davidson
in the case of the election of practic-
ally all the officials of the various
campus organizations. .The senior
class is the “fresident-editor-cap-
tain” class. The junior class is the
“vice-president” class; the sopho-
more the “secretary-treasurer” class.

Why this should be the almost in-
fallible’rule is difficult to understand
The constitution justly provides for
the election, of the student body
officers from the respective classes.
This*provision has proven to be
sound in principle and practice and
we can't take exception to it. But

WANTON WILES

By Dave Anderson

After seven years of political con-
troversy the “Boulder Dam” bill has
been passed by both houses and signed
by the President. Arizona, however,
objects strenuously and may take the
matter into court on the grounds
of unconstitutionality. The structure
involves appropriations of $165,000,000
and is to be the highest dam in the
world, It is to dam up the Colorado
River and by irrigation.make rich new
lands, and will also be a source of
power and water supply for nearby
cities. Arizona objects because it
would confine the waters of the Color-
ado instead of letting them continue
their natural course through Arizona
and on into Mexico and the gulf of
lower California.

A divorce after forty minutes of
married life is claimed by the Lon-
don Times as a record for short mar-
riages.
and his sweetheart were duly married
and left the magistrate’s office. They
returned a short while later to seek
and obtain a divorce, They had spent
their brief honeymoon on a tram quar-
reling about where they would live.
Since they couldn’t agree on that, they
agreed to disagree.

Speaking of strange clubs, why not
organize a wading club for Davidson
‘whose members could better enjoy
sliding and splashing through the mud
on the campus, especially on dark,
rainy nights.

Quite a striking fact brought out re-
cently is that 7 out of 10 members of
the new Nationalistic Cabinet in China
are Christians. These include a direct
descendant of Confucius, and one of
the “Big Three” of China. Our mis-
sionaries have not fought in vain.

The new dollar bills, which incident-
ally should be in circulation By now,
are just the beginning of a system of
standardization in our monetary sys-
tem. Formerly the Treasury has car-
ried on hand five different kinds of
dollar bills. By the new system: there
is only one kind. As the bills of larger
denomination are changed in size they
too will be standardized until the pres-
ent number of 30 different kinds of
bills will be reduced to 11. The new
bills are made so that they are 50 per
cent stronger than the old models and
much more economical. Since the
size is reduced by 1-3 a larger saving
is made in ink, paper and_ storage
space.

Florida is usually thought of as a
sunny land of orange groves, tourists
and real estate with a beach around
most of it. But among other things

is there an reason why the editor
of The Davidsonian, or The Chame-.
leon, the captain of football, basket-
ball, etc., the cheer leader, or the
head officers of the many smaller
campus organizations should be
elected from the senior class when
there happens to be superior talent
in lower classes ?

A more thorough distribution of
honors is practically the only feas-
ible argument which can be broached
for such a practice as now exists.
But the question immediately arises
whether or not the efficiency of the
institution should be sacrificed in
order to more evenly distribute the
honors among the respective classes.
We can see no reason why it should.

Let us take a general example.
The junior class has two men who
would each! make an efficient head
of a certain organization. The sen-
ior class has one man inferior to
each of the former. The latter, by
custom, is elected. The ‘following
year only one of the two compe-
tent men can be elected and the or-
ganization enjoys only one year of
capable administration whereas it
could have had two years by electing
a junior as its head.

The election of a junior as cap-
tain of the basketball team this sea-
son is the only time this custom has
been broken in the past few years.
Other times have arisen and shall
arise, though they will not occur
frequently, in which caste and tra-
dition should be broken over for the
sake of proper administration.

The smaller a college is the more
frequently will it be necessary to
wes over the eee rule. David-

son is a small college but she per-
sists in holding tightly to this cus-
tom. We observe that many large
universities, which dare more able
from variety of talent in a given
class to confine their honors to the
senior class, do not hold so strictly to
the rule as does Davidson.

Last year in the United States, there
was approximately a ratio of one di-
vorce to every ten marriages. Divorces
granted during the year 1927 number-
ed 192,037, an increase of 11,184;or 6.2
per cent above the previous high year,
1926. Marriages for 1927 numbered
1,200,694 or 1,880 less than in 1926, The
number of marriages was 10.12 per
1,000 of population in 1927, whereas in
1926 it was 10.27. The divorce ratio was
1.62 per 1,000 population in 1927, against
1.54 in 1426. This is a clear indication
of a steadily rising divorce ratio ac-
companied by a decline in marriages.

The one-half of one per cent clause
in the prohibition law was never in-
tended to be the limit of enforcement.

If,.the reaction of the newspapers
of the South*to Major Chester Mills’
prize-winning essay on prohibition en-
forcement is at all representative the
drys in this section are experiencingya
season of gloom. The fallacy of Ma-
jor Mills’ assertion that the principal
source of illicit whiskey is the diver-
sion of alcohol may not be obvious
outside of the South, but in Dixie we
know that the prize winner is inac-
curate in his estimation of the situa-
tion, For instance, there were seized
last year in Georgia more than 3,400
stills. Accepting the statement of
Lincoln C, Andrews that only 10 per
cent of the existing stills are seized
every year, this would put the number
of stills in Georgia at 34,000. These
will average at least 1,500 gallons a
year, This calculation would place the
“moonshine” output in Georgia at ap-
proximately 50,000,000 gallons annually,
and for the countty at large the output
of illegal liquor would bé 400,000,000
gallons and probably more each year.
In the circumstances, Mr. Durant's
prize money seems to have purchased
not even a salve for the present pro-
hibition illness, much less a solution.

Other prohibition officers say that
the Mills’ plan is old stuff. But that
cannot be said of what comes through
the holes in it.

A recent news articles tells of a trial
in Spain that rivals that of Scopes in
Tennessee. Carmin Alvarez, a Madril-
ese woman, illiterate and obtaining the
information from hearsay, carelessly
dropped the remark that our Lord had
brothers and sisters. The gossip was
reported, and the authorities, judging
that the Divine Majesty was insulted
by accrediting a normal family life to
Mary and Joseph after the birth of
Jesus, condemned the woman to two
years imprisonment. Of course, every-
body knows that the New Testament
refers in sundry places to James, the
brother of the Lord, and also to other
brothers, but a higher court confirmed
the sentence. The curious part of this
harsh sentence is the fact that several
anti-clerical and out-and-out atheistic
publications appear regularly in that
country and are never molested.

TALKING ABOUT THE COURT
Dear Editor:

Somebody said we should always
count ten before we say anything when
we get mad. Well I got mad and so
I have tried to see how it would work
to count ten. I’ve counted ten weeks
since the Court of Control passed a
bunch of new rules for some reason or
another to hem the freshmen in a
little closer than they have been be-
fore. But counting these ten weeks
has had the opposite effect of cooling
my ire and if you don’t mind publish-
ing this I would just like to say a word
about. what I think of this shine the
Court pulled.

Some of the othe, regulations are
bad enough but I’m nut going to say
anything about any of them right now
except the post office restriction. Now
it doesn’t look to me like the Court
used common sense in passing this reg-
ulation. It is far more practical to be
jostled just a little in the post office
than it is to make two or three trips
backward and forward between the
front door and boxes to get some
freshman’s mail for him, Now the
Court might not be gentlemen and
might ignore the requests of the fresh-
men to get their mail for them but if
the Court ever tried the job it surely
would realize that it would be cheaper
to let the freshmen get their own mail.

It looks as if the°Gourt thought that

since it couldn't find anything else to
do just kept the freshmen out of the
post office a little longer, thinking the
popular opinion would be with it in
any move against the freshmen.
Yours, not especially for the fresh-
man but for expediency.
Roger’s Will.
P. S—I would like to hear. from the
Court in regard to this—R. W.

-REVIEW OF REVIEWS

Mr. Editor:
“'T is hard-to say, if greater want
of skill
Appear in writing or in judging
ill,”

—Alexander Pope “Essay on
Criticism.”

The student criticism of The Cham-
eleon, appearing in the December 13th
issue of The Davidsonian, is, we should
say, a bit too severe. Portions of The
Chameleon, no doubt, deserve the
epithets, such as “a complete wash-
out,” “without a redeeming quality,”
etc., hurled at them from the pen of
this critic. But this criticism, as such,
has failed to grasp the significant idea,
the redeeming feature of all criticism.
It is this that we protest. “Criticism
is the art of judging justly the beauties
and faults of a literary work.” The
Chameleon critic has overlooked the
beauties, possibly because they are
few. The criticism is entirely too de-

some changes should be made and

.

‘structive. Aside from a casual hint

that one of the poems would “pass in
the dark” and that some of the book
reviews were not half-bad, the critic
has said nothing constructive. “It is
unfortunate that the literary efforts
at Davidson have reached a low ebb.”
Yes, it is exceedingly unfortunate.
But don’t throw a drowning man a
lead-filled life belt. If nothing else is
possible, at least compliment. the ef-
forts made by the writers of The
Chameleon. They, too, probably real-
ize the low ebb of literary efforts on
the campus, but, to say the least, are
doing their best to raise the standards.

Like others, we have held a rather
disinterested opinion of The Chame-
leon, as concerning the material for
it. We have never. made efforts to
contribute to it, largely. because of
just such criticisms as this of the past
issue, For if the critics expect of The
Chameleon a “Yale Review” on a
small scale, we will continue to hold
back. But in our opinion, The Cham-
eleon is not supposed to be a marvei-
lous piece of literary work. We have
no graduate students to contribute to
it, no students trained for the literary
world. The/ Chameleon is, and will
continue to be, a mere experimenting
ground for beginners, being classed as
good or bad according the natural

ability of the untrained writers. Please
don’t: discourage such. They have

possibilities.

The critic is rather severe with some
of the contributors for imitating the
style of great men. Copying a literary
style is a dangerous business, but has
its advantages. There is also a criti-
cism in regard to one of the short-
story writers copying, and borrowing
from the works in Flynn’s Weekly,
but, like the critic, we believe there
could be better short-story styles
found elsewhere. But possibly this
writer wishes to continue in ‘such
styles, There is money in the business,
as long as many, like our critic, who
claims for himself remarkable literary
taste, continue to read and be so well
acquainted with such magazines.

Let us quote Pope again, for the
benefit of those who are game and de-
termined enough to at least try to
boost literary efforts on the Davidson
campus:

“Yet shun their fault, who, scandously
