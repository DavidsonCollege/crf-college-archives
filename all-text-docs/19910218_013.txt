Alumnus Workman Sings
Opera At Davidson

By es Martin

How many Davidson graduates
do you know. who become bank-
ers? Lawyers? Doctors? What
about famous opera singers?

Davidson has produced at least
one great opera singer, and he re-
turned Tuesday night to perform in
Love Auditorium for many old
friends, classmates, professors, and
even old high school teachers, as
well as present students and fac-
ulty.

William Workman began sing-
ing as soonas he could talk, and he
still remembers when he learned
what opera was from his father at
age six. While

for which he had to audition. If he
gotin he would study there; if not,
he would return to Davidson to
major in English.

As things turned out, Workman
did both.

He was accepted to the Curtis
Institute where he studied under
Martial Singher, a French musi-
cian, and during the summers, he
returned to Davidson to squeeze
courses in during the summer.
(Davidson used to have summer
sessions.) During his last year at
Curtis, they offered him a three-
year-contract with the Hamburg
State Opera.

family recently moved back there. _

Workman says that while he
has lived in Germany for most of
his adultJife, he is an American,
and ifhe had to choose between the
two countries, he would probably
move back to the United States.

He be ieves that he could never
have become the singer he has
become if he lived in the States. “I
am extremely grateful for what
they have allowed me to do,”
Workman said of his feelings for
Germany and the German people.

“Most great educators during
my time were Europeans who left
during the Nazi years. I have con-
tributed to Germany because I am

When he was 17, Workman
won a contest fora summer schol-

Music Camp (which is now. the
Brevard Music Camp) on a schol-
arship from WBT.

There, he found out that he had

fall and had a “normal freshman
year,” taking some music classes.

After his freshman year, how-
ever, Workman had to decide if he
wanted to try to study music seri-
ously, which would mean study-
ing at a conservatory where he
could develop as a musician, or if
he wanted to continue his studies
at Davidson. .

He decided to apply to the
Curtis Institute in Philadelphia,

planning to return after the con-
tract ran out, but he still hasn’t
moved back after almost 30 years.

The Hamburg Operaasked him
to stay for four more years, and

then Christoph von Dohnayi of--

fered him a position with the Frank-
‘furt Opera that he could notrefuse.

He was the leading baritone at
Frankfurt, where he says that he
had “plenty of free time, good
friends, the repertoire that! wanted
to sing.” He also. did a lot of
“guesting”--touring to other opera
houses.

He felt he had sung almost all
of the works that he wanted to sing,
and that he wanted to move on to
something that he “found [he] was
rather good at--teaching.”

At that time, he wanted to per-
form in concerts and to sing in

ten by Franz Schubert. Lieder ,
translated literally, means “songs,”
but the word refers to a German
genre of music that began as early
as Mozart.

“Opera is a very robust sort of
thing--almost athletic. I loved
doing it; but when you’re doing
lieder, it’s almost like having a
date with music...it is very inti-
mate,” Workman said.

Winterreise is Schubert’s mas-
terpiece, and it was the last work
he wrote before his death.

While this piece was not popu-
lar at first, Workman explains,
people grew to love it.

He sang it instead of other

- songs that people might recognize

because he felt that even thoughall
of the 24 songs are in German, the
audience can still feel the meaning
of the music because of its inten-
sity and beauty.

Comparative Shopping Needed For Student Housing?

By Leigh McKeever

When a prospective home-
owner goes “shopping” foraccom-

modation, agents go out of their
way to make the buyer the. best’

possible offer for the best money.
Renting ‘or buying is a one-shot

deal, and most people comparative | !

sion, With the housing lottery
around the corner, it is just. as
important for students to do’a little
comparison shopping of their own.

So, what exactly are you get-
ting for your money at Davidson

College? Estimates for next year’

breakdown as follows: A single or_
a senior apartmentcan be “rented”
for $279.11 a month; A double

rents for $228.88/month; A triple,
for $167.00/month. These prices
are inclusive of all utility bills.
However, beginning next year, an
additional andnon-optional $5 per
month will be added so that those
living in the Apartments and Smith
House can enjoy cable. This brings

their bill to $284.11 ‘each month. _

According to Richard Terry,
rent collected on the senior apart-
ments just breaks even with the
outstanding mortgage.

_-makes a- profit from your rent.
Housing is indeed a service, but it
too conforms to the capitalistic

profit motive.

If you choose to live “off-
campus,” what sort of a pricerange
should-you be expecting? Sandra
Smith and Millicent ‘McKeithen
live ina shared apartment with two
single bedrooms (that are each -
about the size of two traditional

_dorm rooms), a full kitchen, sitting -

room, anda full bath. With utilities
and toilet paper (dormitories get
this for “free’”’), their monthly bill

‘comes to $210.00 a month.

They also live within walking
distance of the campus, closer to
Chambers than the Apartments.

Lyndsey Forsyth, who lives in

the Oak Hill Apartments across
from FIJI, pays $330 each month.
This price includes utilities, one

bedroom, a full kitchen, anda liv-..

ing room.

Living off-campus seems to
offer more for the money, as long.
as you don’t mind being a bit
“removed from the day-to-day
Canes life."

_ Being: able. to sleep in your
own room all night long without
twenty-eight other people on your

hall, all with different living hab-

its, might be worth the three or four
minute walk or bike ride to cam-
pus.

Davidson also reserves the
right to require you to live on
campus. Given this year’s over-

crowding situation, receiving off-
campus permission is not a prob-
lem. But, if Davidson is ever not
able to fill its dormitories, they can

. refuse to give you permission to

live anywhere but in the college’s
facilities. In 1989-1990 Davidson
had fifty vacancies, and lost
$100,000 in revenue. The permis-
sion requirement protects the col-
lege from losing their profits.
Spring housing lottery is in-
cluding rooms in an unbuilt new
apartment. Residence Life does not
guarantee that this building will be
constructed on time. If the new
apartmentis not finished, then those
students waiting to move in will be
forced to live in dorm lounges.
