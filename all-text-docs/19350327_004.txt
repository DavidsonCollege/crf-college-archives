Coach John Kobs will bring his Mich-

igan State College Spartans of East

Lansing to the Wildcats’ lair Friday

afternoon to engage Coach Laird’s Feline

nine, and we wonder just how the out-
come will be.

Last season the Spartans took
the Wildcats for an easy trounc-
ing to a 16-6 tune, and they come
back Friday with the came nine
that invaded in 1934, excepting
one new outfielder. This fact pre-
sents them rather formidably, but
Monday afternoon the Clemson
Tigers shut them out 5-0, and the
Tigers have been about on a par
with the Wildcats for the last two
seasons.

On the other hand, the Davidsonians
will still be seeing red from last spring's
bitter upset, so it will be no easy go for
the Spartans. Fact is, a victory on the
Presbyterian side seems the most likely
prediction,

LOOK GOOD

In the few drills that I have
seen them so far the Wildcats
have looked plenty good. The
infield with ‘‘Wood”’ Burns at the
initial sack, Floyd Bumgarner on
second, Hank Loftin at shortstop,
Johnny Mackorell in the “hot cor-
ner,” and “Wimpy” Ravenel be-

* hind the plate, shows a world of
pep, and they are all pretty nifty
ball handlers too.

“Wimpy” tells me that he’s got an
eagle eye at the plate this year, and he
isn't the only one who thinks so, and,
too, he isn’t the only one who has his
peepers peeled for the pellet. Johnny

Mackorell and Jim Morgan are. still
swinging the willow in fine fashion, along
with several rookies and other likely

candidates.

Mound worries don’t look as
great this spring as is usually the
case. Charlie Harris, Paul Coble
and Jack Jenkins are a trio of
armed vgteran hurlers on hand,
and Jack Somerville and ‘‘Lefty’’
Porter show considerable promise
in fhe novice group. Harris or
Cable will probably start on the
hill against Michigan.

GOLFERS DELIVER

The Wildcat golfers very pleasantly
surprised their followers last Friday
afternoon by defeating the North Caro-
lina State Big Five champions.

The ’Cats this season are com-
posed - of two juniors, Charlie
Hamrick and Bill Snow, and two
sophomores, George Cowan and
Charlie Ross, and they are four
neat club wielders. Their playing
form is unusually well developed,
and they all shoot consistently in
the seventies.

This team will be one of the best
ever sent out from the Presbyterian
camp.

HOLE IN ONE

Ab Price, a frequent inhabitor
of the local golf links, almost be-
came a member of the “hole in
one club” Saturday afternoon,
when he drove his tee shot on the
third! hole directly to the cpp. It
was so direct that it bounced out
of the tin-lined holder onto the
green.

An excellent shot despite its failure
to behave as it should.

SWAN SONG

One friend professed, during the re-
cent past, to be an ardent reader of this
column, but, with an air of sympathy,
added that it was as boring as plodding
through Mississippi mud. That friend

Wildcat Linskmen Tie Hampton-

Sydney At Charlotte

The 1935 edition of the varsity golf
team got off to a fine start last Friday
when they took the measure of N. C.
State’s links team by a score of 12 to 6.

State, boasting the state championship
from last year’s brilliant performance
and having three members of that same
team playing their third year of varsity
golf, was a formidable opponent for the
first match of the comparatively inex-
perienced Wildcat linkers, playing for
their first time together.

Playing under very undesifable weath-
er conditions, the Wildcat linksmen
came into a deadlock with Hampden-
Sydney on the Charlotte Golf Course

Monday afternoon, the score being 9
to 9,

In the first meet, the combination of
two sophomores and two _ juniors,

coached «by “Doc” Newton this year,
proved tobe a winning one, and the Wild-
cats emerged victorious. Charlie Ross,
sterling sophomore from Charlotte and
playing in the number one position, was
medalist for the day with a 73, three
over par for the eighteen-hole route. His
round was good enough to win three
points from Dusty, ace State player.
Ross with George Cowan, another sopho-
more from Charlotte, woh three points
from Dusty and Newnham of State in
the four-ball match. Cowan, with an
excellent 78, took runner-up honors and
won 2% points from Newnham. Ross’
card follows: :

Results in the first foursome—David-
son 8%, N. C. State Y.

Results in the second foursome—Da-
vidson 3%, State 5%. Final results—
Davidson 12, N. C. State 6.

In the Hampden-Sydney meet, Bill
Snow was medalist with the score of
74. In the first foursome Charlie Ross
won three points atid lost none. Cowan
was defeated and his opponent won three
tallies. Ross and Cowan lost three in
the best-ball match.

Snow, playing number three in the
second foursome, won 2% and lost %.
Charlie Hamrick won 1% and lost 1%.
Snow and Hamrick won two and lost
one,

Intra-Mural Sport
Card Begins Soon

Inter-class competition will be contin-
ued April 3, immediately after holidays,
with intramural baseball.

Indoor-outdoor baseball will be played
in all these games, instead of the reg-
ular intercollegiate sport.

The schedule for the season will be as
follows: Seniors vs. Freshmen, Juniors
vs. Sophomores, Seniors vs. Sopho-
mores, Juniors vs. Freshmen, Seniors vs.
Juniors, Sophomores vs. Freshmen.

Up to the present seven out of twelve
sports have been played off. The num-
ber of poits earned by each class is as
follows: Juniors, leading with 105

| points; Sensors, 90 points; Freshmen, 80

points, and Sophomores, 70 points.

As in the other class competitions
already held, the winning team will earn
20 points, and the runner-up, 15 points.
The team taking third place gets 10,
and the fourth, five points.

most readers have been able to derive
some small bit of interest from this part

I am very happy to announce

spring.

Harry has been a very faithful mem-
ber of the sophomore reportorial staff.
He has shown unusual interest and

is with pl e and confid that I

Third Year Men
Lead Decathlon

Frazier And Dickson Take In-
dividual Honors In Track
Competition
The intramural decathlon, an innova-
tion pronounced successful by Wildcat
track officials, was concluded Saturday
with the Junior class taking first hon-
ors in the class race and Earle. Frazier,
a junior, copping the blue ribbon in the

individual contests.

The juniors piled up a total of 850
poirits in the contest to lead the sopho-
mores by 64 points. Not only did the
Big-Hat men prove runners-up in the
class race, but one of the Centennials
took second in individual honors. Walter
Dickson, sophomore, made a total of
250% points.

The seniors took third in the class
contest with 601 points and in the also-
runs among the individual races, Frite
Byerly gathered 183 points and Bob
Gregory 136. Byerly is a senior and
Gregory a junior transfer.

A total of forty-five students entered
in the decathlon, which was sponsored
by the Athletic Council to try to un-
cover individual talent and provide op-
portunity to pass the requirements for
Sigma Delta Psi, national athletic fra-
ternity. A number of events were of-
fered and any student could pick the
ten he wished to enter.

Heath Whittle, track coach, stated this
morning that the decathlon would be-
come a regular part of the sports sched-
ule beginning next year.

Other students who figured well in
the decathlon were Archie MacFadyen
with 941%, Audley Gammon with 93%,
and Paul McLanahan with 93 points. A
freshman, Bill Wicker, proved to be the
outstanding sub-Centennial candidate
with 117% points.

In the 100-yard dash Dickson and By-
erly tied, stepping off the race in 108
seconds. They were followed by Greg-
ory and Duke Glasgow, who made the
dash in 11 flat.

Paul McLanahan ran the 220-yard
dash in 24 seconds to take first honors
in that event. Dickson, with 24.2 sec-
onds, was followed by Frazier and
Gregory, who clocked it in 24.3.

‘Bob Gregory ran the 440-yard run in
55.8 seconds, to take first, and he was
followed by Bill Bell, who made it in
56.8.

The 880-yard run saw a sophomore
and a freshman, Tom Thompson and
“Howe” Pharr, take first in 2.20 min-
utes. Second places were taken by Pey-
ton Montgomery and Harmon Wood-
ward with 2 minutes and 28 seconds.

Earle Frazier claimed his own in the
mile run and took first place with 4:43.
He was followed by Billy Merchant
with 4:53 and Archie MacFadyen with
a run of 4:59. There were no entries
in the two-mile.

Kenny, Kiesewetter, Frampton
And_ Cooke Seeded For
Tournament Play

Drawings for the freshman tennis
tournament were held last week with
fifteen men entered. These men are:
“Sky” Cline, Owen Cooke, Harry
Frampton, Gene Ganier, James Hartzog,
Bronston Kenny, Russell Kerr, Bill
Kiesewetter, Charles Moore, Torrey
Mclean, Gus Reinhardt, Oris Rolt, and
Richard Vowles. The tournament is
under the direction of Bob Lindsay.

A ladder will be formed from the
showing in this tournament. The first
six men will be chosen to form the
team. However, in most matches only
a four-mam team will be used.

There were four men seeded. These
were Kenny, Kiesewetter, Frampton and
Cooke. ‘This seeding was taken from
the showing in the freshman fall tourna-
ment-last.semester.

The tournament is progressing slowly
on account of the weather and varsity
matches. All of the matches must be
over by April 10, however.

Round robins will be held later in
the season to determine the places on
the team among the first four and sec-
ond four. .

Meets have been arranged with Char-
lotte High School, Winston-Salem High
School. and N. C. State freshmen. The

ton|Coach Gene McEver Laments
Dearth Of ee
Pitching Staff

“Hit that apple! Let’ Let's hear that old
chatter in there now!” And these words
are not infrequently heard falling from
the lips of the forty-odd aspirants who
are put through their paces daily by
Freshman Baseball Coach McEver.

When not hindered by inclement
weather, the baseball proteges of Coach
McEver have gone through their rigid
tests with unusual enthusiasm. Batting
and fielding with individual instruction
have been the order of the day. While
a bit early to predict of what calibre the
team may be, indications point to a suc-
cessful season if a good~twirling staff
can be developed.

Infield prospects are bright with
“Teeny” Lafferty, Elie Ganier, Elwood
Moyer, Tom Baskerville, Gene Ganier,
and Bill Kiesewetter leading the way.
The catching department is being well
taken care of by Joe Kellam and Doug
Neal. In the outfield one finds such
embryonic fly-catchers as Feilden Clark,
Spencer Goodman, Morris Morgan, Wil-
lard Dixon, and Bailey Williams.

The! big question mark in the whole

situation is the pitching staff, with only }

two men of previous.experience doing
the chucking; namely “Dopey” Hill and
“Cab” Calloway. Among the others who
may break into the headlines before the
season is very old are: Bill Rader, Dan
Rhodes, Bill Crooks, George Gray, Billy
Nicholson, Bill Yelverton, Tom Mor-
rison, Charles Brown, Joe Thompson,
Johnny McQueen, Joe McLaurin, Brent
Greene, E. S. Parks, J. Rogers, Wallace

Tonisson, Bill, Hobbs, and Bill Manson. 4

BARROW YEARLING STAR

Freeman Takes Two Firsts In
65-55 Frosh Victory

Davidson's varsity and freshman track
squads gave hopeful glimmers of a suc-
cessful 1935 track season with victories
over Wake Forest on the Deacons’ and
Little Deacons’ cinders last Saturday.

The varsity ‘Wildcats had a decided
edge over their rivals and won by a score
of 85 to 41. The yearlings were more
evenly matched, but, led by Wade Bar-
row with three first places and one sec-
ond to his credit, the ’Kittens were the
winners by a 65 to 55 count.

Among the Big Wildcats, Paul Pitt-
man, junior, and Walter Dickson, the
Century Limited, were outstanding. Pitt-
man took the pole vault and the low
hurdles. Dickson won the hundred-yard
dash, the broad jump and tied for sec-
ond in the high jump.

Bill Deyerly, another Centennial con-
tribution to future track teams, captured
the high and low hurdles. The hundred
and the two-mile run were “all-David-
son,” with “Rjp” Montgomery leading in
the two-mile and Dickson taking first
‘in the hundred-yard dash. The Wild-
cats took eleven first places out of the
fourteen events offered.
