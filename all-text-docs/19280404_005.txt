Purpose of R.O.T.C. is to Train

Young Men to

Become Leaders

|
The purpose of the Reserve Officers’ Contract Let for

Training Corps is to train young men to be-
come leaders in their community and, in the
event of a national emergency, to qualify
them as efficient commanders in order that
unnecessary casualties might not be the pen-

alty incident to sending men into battle under
untrained officers.

The R. O. T. C. inculcates respect for
those things that are worth while, obedience
to law and regulations, teamwork in the as-
sociation of daily life, and that character so
essential in the deyelopment of the successful
man. The aims and ideals of the R. O. T.
C. point toward the development of a spirit
of esprit, both collegiate and national, and
toward the creation in the young man of the
initiative which will enable him in tater
years to become an outstanding man in his
community. Above all it stresses the neces-
sity of‘an individual type of honor of the
highest standard.

The purpose of the R. O. T. C. at David-
son College is, in addition to giving the mili-

tary training prescribed for such units, to be.

of actual service to this community. As a
concrete example of the type of service ren-
dered, the organization of the battalion into
a fire-fighting unit is cited. Only last fall
the home of one of the faculty members
caught fire and was quickly extinguished—

incidentally by two members of the band,’

that much discussed organization. Prompt
and sensible action on the part of the two
men concerned_saved the professor consid-
erable damage to his personal effects and,
possibly, the loss of a good building to the
: college.

The training of a band to furnish music at
athletic contests and other public gatherings
is fostened by the R.O. T.C. The presence
of the band, especially at football games,
constitutes a method for creating a com-
munity spirit that will go with the alumnus
through life. The furnishing of trained men
to handle traffice and crowds at big inter-
collegiate events is but another instance of

the efforts made by the R. O. T. C. to ren-{

der service.

Because of the fact that most of the in-
Sstructors detailed by the War Department
for such duty are war veterans, the attitude
of the student is anti-militaristic. These
regular Army officers, having experienced
the horrors and wantonness of war, give to
the student a verbal picture of war-time con-
ditions with the result that the student has
no desire to go through the same experiences.
The aim of the R. O. T. C. is to teach the
weapons of war so that these weapons may
be effectively manipulated should the occasion
arise and also to instill in the potential of-
ficer’s mind the idea that peace is the only
sane condition and to be relinquished only
after all other measures have failed. Then,
after such measures have failed, to wage an
aggressive fight so that the national menace
may be removed as quickly as possible.

As regards the militory history of this
country, the R. O. T. C. is still in its in-
fancy. There remain many things to be
done before the corps shall have reached its
highest degree of efficiency. Had there been
a means of producing potential officers prior
to the World War, however, the equal of the
present organization, it is doubtful whether
Germany would have held the military power
of the United States in such low esteem. It

.is probable that such an organization, to-
gether with a selective service provision for
man power, would have prevented the entry
of the United States into the World War.

according to President Martin.

Arrangetents have been made with Blythe
and Isenhour, Charlotte contractors and suc-
cessful bidders for the north and south
‘wings, to complete both remaining portions
at a cost of approximately $400,000.

The northern wing, on which construction
has been going on now for about a month
and a half, is to be used mainly for labora-
tories and class-rooms for all the sciences
included in the curriculum here. It is plan-
ned for this section to be ready by January
1, 1929.
