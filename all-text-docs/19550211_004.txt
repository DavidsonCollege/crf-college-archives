By JOHN HARMON

Good morning, sidewalks; Good
morning, birds! Yellow air, green
grass, red birds, blue sky. Joyful,
Joyful, We Adore Thee! To a
second-, third-, or fourth-year Da-
vidsonian, the above paraphrase
will hold real significance. To a
freshman, all that can be said is,
this is the most popular facet of
that rare phenomenon called
“Graggism.” Understood but never
effectively explained, it is a com-
bination of Deism, hedonism, op-
timism, humility, etc. ad infinitum.
It is indeed a rich innovation to
our campus, but its progenitor and
most ardent protagonist is even
more ... no, read the rest of the
sketch and decide for yourself.

Perhaps not all of you have
seen, but without doubt you have
all heard. of Gilbert Hilton Gragg.
Jr., through his writings or
through his speaking intelligently
and interestingly (7) and intermina-
bly on all subjects relevant to
him. Just ask him about Thomas
Wolfe or Fyodor Dostoievski some-
time and you'll be in for a three-
hour lecture. Ask him about some
fairly well-known novel by some
not to important author and he
will be able to tell you the com-
plete outline of the narrative which
he has garnered from his beloved
summary books.

To see the almost inumerable
store of books which fill two
bookcases in his room and three
shelves on his library carrel, one
would think that summary learning
is hardly the correct phrase to de-
scribe Gilbert’s accumulation of
knowledge, and rightly too, for the
surprising thing about all the
books he owns is that he stays on
campus most weekends and reads
them, some for enjoyment and
some in preparation for his honors
seminar in modern literature (he
made “as close to A plus as possi-
ble” on his first semester exam
under Prof. Lilly). The five most
prominent book clubs in the United
States are still suing him for non-
payment, but his friends are en-
joying thoroughly the cook books
which they received when he sub-
mitted their names as new mem-
bers in order to obtain free books.

Graggism is, however, more than
a resplendent regurgitation of a
random accumulation of book-
learning: it is the spontaneous ef-
fervescence of a mind that has
been inclined towards various
philosophical outlooks on life and
that has remained for the most
part publicly uninhibited by ratio-
cination or retrospection. Judging
on the basis of writings from con-
secutive periods of Gilbert's life,
one might describe Graggism as
hedonistic optimism, humble op-
timism, tragic optimism, or pessi-
mistic optimism. The spiritual de-
velopment of the “Graggist” has
many interesting and revealing
sidelights.

HEDONISTIC OPTIMISM

Gilbert’s early life in Bainbridge,
Georgia, was one of the usual com-
fort and security. In his eleven-
grade high school (he always uses
his “inferior” eleven-grade back-
ground as an excuse for having
had to take Math 10, and to ex-
plain such calamities as “B” in
biology and Greek) he was vale-
dictorian and was chosen the out-
standing senior. During this time
also he was selected as the most
outstanding Y-worker in Georgia
and twice winner of the state es-
say contest. Besides writing, his
two main diversions were music
and playing center on the basket-
ball team. (After eight years of
studying music, he can now play
“Malaguena.”)

Gilbert has spent the summer
months ever since he was in the
seventh grade in extensive travel.
He has visited all forty-eight states
except Arkansas. During his west-
ern tour, a cataclysmic catastrophe
descended upon him in Wyoming
where he saw the gushing geysers

American travels,
Gilbert’s experiences around the
world: The Continent, England,
Canada, Cuba, and Alaska. While
he was in Europe, he shared the
grandeur of the Continent. with
the south-Georgian farm element
via weekly newsletters to the Bain-

eh
an
GRAGG

for three entire days. He has been

making up for those seventy-two
lost hours ever since, to the de-
light of friends who look forward

to his famed “visits,” and to the

chagrin of those who do not under-
stand his idea of “sharing” his ex-
periences and ideas with others.

Far more interesting than his
however, are

bridge paper (he increased cir-

culation by three hundred sub-
scriptions; how many did his rela-
tives buy?).

When not traveling, Gilbert spent

the summer season in a beautiful
southern plantation-type home in

Montreat, where his first real

awareness of the beauty of nature

and of the hand of God in nature

caused him to exclaim: “Goodness

is that which flows through valley,
hill, stream, and heart down into
the chasm .of the abyss of the
human soul in multitudinous tor-
rents, bringing God.”

MUMBLE OPTIMISM

Upon coming to college, Gilbert
lost much of his former hedonistic
approach to life and after a short
time donned the garb of humility.
One of the chief causes of this new
outlook was the realization, after
a summer school experience, that
the trusting and innocent. attitude
is not always the best. After a dis-
cussion with “friends” of the mo-
tion picture “Houdini,” while pre-
paring to cdnduct a hall prayer-
meeting service, Gilbert was per-
suaded to test his own magical
abilities by trying to extricate him-
self from a locked trunk. When,
an hour later, he was released, he
found himself, clad in nothing but
underwear, at Hattie’s. He missed
the religious services for the
evening!

During college days, his interests
developed along two main lines:
religion and literature. Although
athletic pursuits were of necessity
relegated to a status of ancillary
importance, Gilbert has consistent-
ly found time to keep us his tennis
game, and even now one can oc-
casionally find him exercising with
weights in his room.

His religious attitude at first
was one after the manner of N. V.
Peale, but after he had thought
positively for a while, he decided
that the time had come for him
to get out and do something, so
he began taking an active part in
Westminster Fellowship and also
in the Y deputations to the Meck-
lenburg Sanatorium. He has agreed
with another who said of Chris-
tianity, “I’m betting my life on it,”
and if asked about faith, he may
reply, “Faith is supra reason, supra
emotion, supra intuition, because
have you never looked out of the
curtained French windows and
seen the soft, white, dewy, crystal-
like snowflakes falling gently from
heaven down upon the rippling,
wavy, pregnant-with-meaning sur-
face of the silent lake lying be-
yond the plain of destiny?” Per-
haps more in keeping with his
Christian existentialism, if asked
for a proof of faith, he will answer,
“Who can prove the beauty of
a sunset or of a Wagnerian opera?”

Gilbert’s literary endeavors have
been most significantly influenced
by a fellow-Southerner, Thomas
Wolfe, whose works he has com-
pletely devoured, and to whose
home he has made a reverential
pilgrimage. Gilbert burst upon the
editorial page of the Davidsonian
with an article attacking a speech

given on Abraham Linceln a year |

ago. This minor explosion in the
fall was followed by a second and

major explosion in the spring with
the publication of the above-men-
tioned “Frost on the Marsh Grass,”
which had the honor of recéiving
third place in the Vereen Bell
Contest of last year.

Graggism came to be defined for
the first time with the appearance
of the article expounding the
philosophy of humble optimism
(this title was dreamed up by the
editor and not used by the author
himself), the result of a soul that
enjoys the “little things”: the
beauty of nature, the blessings of
friendship, and the pleasure in
singing “Joyful, Joyful, We Adore
Thee!” This article,which furnished
a meaningful definition of the
coined word “gragment” as “two
pages of description with no plot,”
also nearly caused the lynching of
its author, for our cynical student
body did not appreciate (and didn't
mind saying so) the phenomenon
of a happy outlook on life.

TRAGIC OPTIMISM

After a summer’s work in the
slums of New York, Gilbert under-
stood that there is a bad, as well
as good, side of life. For eight
weeks he worked in a settlement
house of the Church of All Na-
tions, serving as instructor and
leader of a group of seventeen un-
segregated twelve-year-dlds, and
returned with the conviction that
true Christian devotion to a worth-
while cause had brought him the
most nearly perfect happiness that
he had ever known.

‘Back at Davidson for his senior
year, Gilbert has snythesized his
wide intellectual background and
experience in life and in literature
in his editorials for the Davidsonian
and in his creative works for Sig-
ma Upsilon. Particularly worthy
of note among the editorials are
those on fraternities’ rush weeks
and on the Homecoming expense
account. He has also shown his
ability to handle subtle humor and
narrative, two aspects of his style
conspicuously absent up to now,
in his short story, “Jean-Paul
Oddley,” based on a Greenwich
Village experience of last summer,
which appeared in the winter is-
sue of Seripts ‘n Pranks.

PESSIMISTIC OPTIMISM

After twenty years of many and
varied interests and experiences,
Gilbert has concluded that “all
things work together for good,”
in spite of the evil that is in life.
Though he admits that he does not
live up to the ideals of the Chris-
tian faith (“I know little, but I use
every bit of it.), he has de-
termined to spend his life in teech-
ing, preaching, and mission serv-
ice just as long as he has a week
of theater-going each yeart). To
perpetrate his plan, Gilbert is
going to Oxford next year to do
graduate work in theology and
then return to seminary it the
United States.

“To lose the earth you know,
for greater knowing; to lose the
life you have, for greater life; to
leave the friends you loved, for
greater loving; to find a land more
kind than home, more large than
earth—.”

Oxford has a pleasant surprise
in store next October. Davidson's

loss will be England’s gain.

Seek Baker Awards |" °°" 1°"

Professor B. D. Thompson, Secre-
tary of the Baker Scholarship
Committee, has announced that a
record number of applications, 170,
has been made this year for the
Baker and Union Carbide scholar-
ships.

These scholarships are awarded
annually to entering freshmen. In
keeping with this increase of ap-
plications, the committee will
award seven or eight Baker
scholarships, the most ever given
by Davidson, two Union Carbide
grants, and three honor scholar-
ships.

Although these applications are
just beginning to be processed, the
committee will select within a
month, approximately 28 finalists
from the 170 aspiring scholars on
the basis of tests, character refer-
ences, and high school records.
These finalists will come to the
Davidson campus for the weekend
of March 24-26 for further testing
and personal interviews.. The
actual recipients of the awards
will be notified around the first
of April.

2 and 3, the alcoholic offense has
been broken down into two sub-
divisions. The first subdivision
prohibits drinking or havng al-
coholic Hiquors on the campus with
a penalty in Section 8 of suspen-
sion from college. That no stu:
dent can be under the influence
of alcoholic liquors on the campus
is the second subdivision with the
penalty in Section 9 being in di-
rect proporton to the degree of
influence. In Section 10, the
penalty for gambling is “in accord
ance with the seriousness of the
offense, the maximum penalty
being suspension from college.” It
will be noted that there have been
many omissions of previously un-
necessary, ineffective regulations.
