SOUTH AFRICA

Last Thursday, South Africa held its first
same-day multiracial elections for segre-
gated municipal councils. President-P.W.
Botha’s National Party faced fierce compe-
tition from the extremé right Conservative
Party which entered local elections for the
first time since its formation 8 years ago.

Campaigning for stricter enforcement of -

apartheid laws, the Conservatives carried
most rural northern towns and blue-collar
urban areas to win at least 67 municipali-
ties compared to 30 for the Nationalists.
Botha’s Nationalists did triumph in several
major battlegrounds including Pretoria, the
administrative capital and Johannesburg,
the copntry’s largest city.

Of South Africa’s 26 million blacks, only
1.5 are eligible to vote in any election.
Anti-apartheid activists in major black
townships urged a boycott of the municipal
elections; voter turnout among the black
population was estimated to be below 10
percent.

MOSCOW

Following recent meetings with Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev, West Ger-
man Chancellor Helmut Kohl announced
an historic agreement with the Soviet Un-
ion for the‘release of all people regarded in
the West as political prisoners by the end
of the year.

Although Kohl would not say whether

the promise came from Gorbachev him-’

self, such a move nonetheless represents a

dramatic break by the Soviet Union with ~

past Kremlin human rights practices. Esti-

mates from various agencies abroad esti- —

mate that between 150 to 500 Western
political prisoners. will be liberated
through this agreement.

Kohl’s announcement was welcomed
by Soviet human rights activist Andrei
Sakharov, the Reagan administration and
Amnesty International.

Agreement through Parliament before
opposition parties jeopardized its approval.

ISRAEL

Israeli Parliamentary elections further
intensified after a terrorist attack against a
civilian bus in the occupied West Bank left
1 Jewish woman and her 4 children dead.
As voters went to the polls tuesday, ana-
lysts speculated that this grim event would
aid Prime Minister Yitzack Shamir and the
conservative Likud bloc, who support
harsher army measures against Arab upris-
ings.

Others hope the attack will encourage
support for Shamir Peres and the Labor
Party who favor negotiations with the
Arabs. It is anticipated that the election will
be very close and will result in the forma-
tion of another coalition government. Is-
raeli soldiers prevented Arab residents
