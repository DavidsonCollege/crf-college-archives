Dr. MacKay Publishes Lecture
Series Delivered Here And

ISSUED BY MacMILLAN

Elaborates On Potency Of
Mankind’s Destiny

Heritage and Destiny is the
name of a new book by Dr.
John A. Mackay, President of
Princeton Theological Semi-
nary, Princeton, New Jersey.

The work, the
MacMillan
manent literary form to the spok-

published by

Company, gives per-
en words of two lecture courses de-
livered by Dr. Mackay during the
past two years. In his preface the
author refers to the Lyman Cole-

fayette College in Fébrtary, 1941,

and his lectures on the same topic

idson,
M.

In his book, Dr. Mackay has de-
veloped his central thesis beyond
the content of his lecture, but its
basic theme remains the same—
and may be stated thus: The sense
of heritage is the most"potent force
shaping the of Mankind
today.

destiny

Chief Heritage

Dr. Mackay maintains that “the
purely forward view has broken
down in our modern age, and we
must look backward for a creative
pattern of life. Mankind can only
get a fresh start by a re-discovery
of the past. When God, coming
in the Great Tradition, is chosen
as the Chief Heritage of Human-
ity, then men will fulfill their true
destiny in personal, cultural and
national life.”
Heritage and Destiny is dedicat-

to “The Presidents, faculty
members and students of two great
Christian Colleges—Lafayette and
Davidson.” It is timely, yet
timeless, Christian appraisal of
the determinants of destiny; of
intense interest and pertinence,
especialy at sueh-a—time—in his-
tory as the present.
