No one has

By Christy Block

The flu may no longer be a
fact of life.

As defined by the Center for
Disease Control and Prevention
(CDCP), influenza (or “flu”) is a
viral infection of the nose, throat,
bronchial tubes, and lungs that can
infect anyone. The United States
is typically attacked by the virus
from approximately November to
April.

The infection consists of the
basic discomforts of illness—fe-
ver, chills, cough, soreness and
aching of muscles—and for most
people only lasts a few days, at
which time their bodies have de-
veloped an immunity to the virus.

Although most of us tend to
acknowledge the fluas a fact of life
and move on from there, this year
the issue calls for some action.

Flu season is already on its
merry way into our immune sys-
tems here at Davidson, and this
Fall it’s gonna be a doozy. The

to catch the flu virus

harsh Bejing flu is expected to hit
the United States in an until now
unknown strain...ie: we’re going
to get sick. Dr. Lone Simonsen of

the CDCPsays that “...even though -

you were exposed to similar strains
inthe past, you might not be able to
defend yourself against this new
one.”
According to the CDCP, the
new virus emerged late in last
year’s flu season, infecting and
killing the elderly through May—
twomonthsafter influenza usually
disappears.

.The virus mutated late last
Spring, and as a result even those
who had gotten vaccinations were
infected.

The good news in all this, is
that the virus hit early enough last
year to have been incorporated in
this year’s vaccination. So, all it
takes isa quick stop by the Student
Health Center, and hopefully our
friend the flu virus will decide to
take its mission elsewhere.

Although the majority of stu-

dents on campus fall into the cat- _

egory of generally healthy bodies,

taking a little precaution is an ad-

visable measure before we enter
exam week. It is “strongly ad-
vised” that anyone that is HIV posi-
tive, 65 years of age or older, health
care workers and hospital person-
nel (that includes those who are
interning), people with kidney dis-
ease, cystic fibrosis, chronic meta-
bolic disease (diabetes, anemia) or
asthma.

The CDCP asks that those who
provide “essential community
functions” get the shot as well; I
believe we all fall under that cat-
egory. Flu shots are available at
the Student Health Center until
November 12th, 1:30-3:30pm.

Temo Tarrago '86 sheds light on NAFTA

By Elizabeth Whitehead

Temo Tarrago, a 1986 gradu-
ate of Davidson, returned the night
of Monday, October 11th, tospeak
about NAFTA. Tarrago was intro-
duced by Professor Appleyard.
The lecture was followed with
questions by both faculty and stu-
dents.

Tarrago gave a “Mexican”
view of NAFTA, the North Ameri-
can Free Trade Agreement. He
explained that although the topic
was a “sensitive one,” in the long
run it could mean more jobs for
everyone.

He admitted that although free
trade between Canada, the United
States, and Mexico might solve
some problems, it would not guar-
antee an end to all economic or
political problems.

He claimed NAFTA “means
change, re-looking.” According to

Tarrago, it involves convincing
companies and individuals in the
United States that although some
jobs may be lost temporarily, the
future. benefits will far outweigh
the immediate costs.

One of the key issues brought
up during the session was that of
change.

Tarrago stressed that although
Mexicoand Latin America did face
some economic,turmoil in the
1980s, it is time to reexamine the
situation in light of democracy and
“economic pick-up.”

“NAFTA is about trade,” ac-
cording to Tarrago, and could take
up to 15 years to evolve fully.
Tariffs, which would be removed
by the agreement, could be rein-
stated in an emergency situation in
order to protect a country.

down there who think highly of the

U.S. but also fear the U.S.” Many
Mexicans. especially those who
are not educated, do not read the
papers and therefore fear that
NAFTA might cause them to lose
the jobs they rely on for survival.
Each country seems

to have its own misconceptions
and fears.

“Changes are going to occur
with or without NAFTA, but
NAFTA will stabilize changes,
make them more predictable,” said

_ Tarrago. He went on to say that

most Mexicans who immigrate to
the U.S. come only because they
need employment, and that
NAFTA could mean opportunity
for people within their own home-
land.

According to Tarrago,
NAFTA could be the answer to the
current immigrantcrisis inthe U.S.

When asked about how the
other Latin American countries
might respond to being includedin
the NAFTA agreement, Tarrago
concluded that they would want to
belong since the plan “makes
sense.”

Tarrago, who was born in
Monterrey, Mexico, and in 1985,
Tarrago was invited to attend
Davidson, and spent his remain-
ing two years of school studying
International Relations and the
Economy.

After graduation, Tarrago
chose to open an import/export
business in Cornelius. After a year,
Tarrago decided to exit the world
of small businéss, and now serves
as Vice President of Bancomer in
New York City.

Following the lecture, mem-
bers of the audience gathered
around Tarrago to ask more ques-
tions.

Anumberof faculty members
reminisced about his Davidson
days and about his shop in Corne-
lius.

Defacing, propaganda

upset students

CLEVELAND (CPS)- Anti-
Semitic fliers stuffed in textbooks
about Nazi war criminals and the
defacing of a black theology text-
jbook temporarily put students and
professors on edge at Cleveland
State University.

Both incidents took place in
late September at the university
bookstore. Someone slipped fli-
ers containing “anti-Holocaust
propaganda” into copies of “Pros-
ecuting Nazi War Criminals,”
which was written by a faculty
member, Alan Rosenbaum, and
used in a philosophy course, re-
ported the Campus Marketplace,
a newsletter of the National Asso-
ciation of College Stores.

Keith McCann, manager of
the bookstore, said store employ-
ees immediately pulled fliers from
the remaining books, sent copies
to Rosenbaum and destroyed the
rest.

Similar incidents have oc-
curred several times in the past 10
years, he said.

“We generally try to keep it
quiet because if we draw attention
toit, it’s just going to happen more
often. We correct the situation
and just move on,” McCann told
the newsletter.

In the other incident, the only
copy of “For All My People,” a

had three chapters cut out and a
dark liquid stained the top edges
of the pages. The liquid report-
edly looked like blood, although it
was not officially identified as
such. ;

Blacks not filling
faculty pipeline

ITHACA, NY (CPS)- Doc-
toral graduates from historically
black institutions are not filling
the pipeline to teaching and re-
search positions at the nation’s
leading research universities and
liberal arts colleges, a study by
Cornell University researchers
shows. ;

Economics and industrial and
labor relations professor Ronald
Ehrenberg and graduate student
Donna Rothstein found that
among the new set of Ph.D.s who
entered academiccareers between
1987 to 1991, only 4 percent of
those form historically black in-
Stitutions gained positions at re-
search institutions or liberal arts
colleges.

Conversely, 31 percent of
their peers who obtained their
doctoral degrees form major re-
search universities received posi-
tions, the study found.

The differences, the research-
ers found, “may reflect ignorance
about historically black institu-
tions (HBIs), discriminatory atti-
tudes toward the graduates of
HBIs, or the failure of faculty in
the elite graduate programs to ag-
gressively recruit potential gradu-
ate students from HBIs.”

Ehrenberg and Rothstein sug-
gest that universities and liberal

leges and from predominantly
black Northern urban universities

Service provides experience

By Randal Lee

Difficult courses, impossible
reviews, or parties down on Patter-
son Court may be some of the
meaningful experiences at
Davidson, but learning to work
with people and understanding
those who are unfortunate in our
society may also be invaluable les-
sons.

Davidson has a variety ofcom-
munity services available through
the Service Coordinator, Gigi Cook
or Reach-Out. Students are en-
couraged to pay heed to their sur-
rounding community and contrib-
ute to its well-being by getting
involved. All sorts of services are
at hand for students of different
concerns ranging from handling
social problems like teen-preg-
nancy to other activities such as
helping elementary kids.

After school activities within
the Davidson community consist
of helping children at school and
taking care of elderly citizens. Stu-
dents interested in teaching as a
future profession can start tutoring
sessions with elementary kids.

Also, special classes outside

of school learning for these chil-
dren, are possible choices. For
example, students may start lan-
guage classes or swimming instruc-
tions through the coordination of
Cook. :

Other programs to help chil-
dren are the Lunch buddy, Big
Brother/Sister, and Reading Buddy
programs which are all designed
as a one-on-one basis with the stu-
dent and the child.

Such important programs are
recommended, and Cook urged to
students to participate. Many stu-
dents have adopted grandparents
from nursing homes, committing
their time to helping other people.

Other areas outside of
Davidson also provide many op-
portunities. According to Gigi
Cook, Charlotte has the most di-
verse opportunities for students.
For those who have questions or
any suggestions, Cook is always
welcome.

She is very proud of the active
involvement of Davidson students,
but also says, “We can always be
looking for more help!”

As part of Parent's
