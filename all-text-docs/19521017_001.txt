the first floor of Phi Hall, is now

Wednesday and Friday. The Sun-
day and Thursday hours are from

mond Lynch, or Fielding Russell

ting recordings and to operate the

than $10,000 worth of eleotronic

equipment which is in the listening

room,

The record library's stock. of

ings contains all well-known classi-
cal works and many of the less
often heard ones, The latest long-
playing record catalogue is kept on
file in the room.

If any student has record re-
quests or suggestions concerning

he is requested to Contact one of
the assistants or Mr. Plott.

KENNETH DIBBEN

Both Dibben and Evans have
been active in British political as
well as student activities. Dibben
is a member of the Young Con-
servative National Committee,
while Evans is a one-time member
of the Labor Party and Fabian
Society and campaigned for the
Laborites in the 1950 elections.

Average D. C.
Man Is Found,
By Statistics

If you are a business major, a
Presbyterian, and a North Caro-
linian, you are an average David-
son man, according to the statistics
of Mr. F. W. Hengeveld, dean of
admissions.

This year's enrollment of 821 put
the school at its normal capacity
for the second year since the war
boom when enrollment soarted to
approximately a thousand. For the
past few years the administration
pursued a policy of reducing the
student body by fifty each year.
Last year the enrollment reached
the desired figure of 825.

A further breakdown of this
figure shows the freshman
class, as usual, to be the
largest, with 246; the sopho-
mores not far behind with 214;
and the juniors and seniors al-
most equal in number, with
177 and 178 respectively. In
addition there were six special
students.

Students pursuing a BS degree
far outnumber those seeking an
AB, with 452 candidates for BS2
and 249 for BSI, compared with
104 for AB2 and only 10 for AB}.

Business is still the favorite

Democrats and Republicans

Vie For Votes In Y Forum

By JESSE FISHER

(Ed. Note: Because of the
prominence given to the politi-
cal speakers in chapel in the
recent Y. forum, the Davidso-
nian thought it wise to get the
impressions of the man who
planned and saw at first hand
the entire program.)

Doubtless the talks in chapel
this week were not major political
speeches. In fact they were not
even speeches. Each candidate
merely got upon the stage and
made several points concerning his
campaign, Evidently the current
vogue in politics is to try to ap-
pear as plain and country-like as
possible—which is no great wrong
in itself.

Mr. Jonas, the Republican, as-
serted that the country needs a
change of administration for the
sake of a change if nothing more.
In addition he asserts the Republi-
cans will cut down government ex-
penses and reduce taxes. Quoting
from speeches made by F. D.
Roosevelt before his election, Mr.
Jonas tried to show how Mr.
Roosevelt did exactly the opposite

after election of what he said he
would do before election. Perhaps
Mr. Roosevelt's economic philoso-
phy was changed after election
when he met one John Maynard
Keynes who advocated the way to
get out of a depression is for the
government to spend huge sums on
public projects and have a budget
deficit for a few years.

The Democratic view, presented
by Congressman Ham Jones, is
that North Carolina doesn’t need
a change. The members of the
N. C. delegation hold high posi-
tions on important committees and
a change of administration would
put them out of their high posi-
tions. Perhaps Congressman Jones’
most pertinent remark was- “Why
should N. C. have a two-party sys-
tem any more than Kansas? Along
with Mr. Jonas, he advocated re-
duction of government spending
and lower taxes.

Unfortunately neither candidate
discussed specific points. Both ad-
vocated reduction of expenses and
taxes, but neither specified how

cation at University College,

Harvest Time|Fall Services Headed By
To Be Theme|Rev. William M. Thompson

Of Decorating|"*

The theme for the Homecoming
week-end at Davidson this year
“Autumn Harvest.”

The decorations for the dances
in the Johnston Gymnasium will
carry out this theme.

The boys on the decorations
committee would not fet out much
information, but from all that can
be gathered it appears that they
are trying to bring the beauties of
nature indoors.The decorations will
be used for both dances, therefore
students are asked to be careful
and leave the decorations in good
order:

Due to the full schedule of
the week-end and to the
game Saturday afternoon, there
will be no afternoon tea dances.

Lawrence Erwin suggested that,
as in the ‘past, there would be ho
specific theme for the fraternity
house decorations and that any
type of decoration would be con-
sidered for judging at 10 o'clock
Saturday morning.

Students planning to attend the
dance concert Friday night may
secure date tickets for $1.00. Gen-
eral adniission is $1.50. The tickets
are on sale at the student store.

Igor Sviatoslavsky, as you per-
naps know by now, is Davidson's
newest foreign student, and Igor’s
background and experiences make
even the episodes of Miedema med-
iocre.

Igor's parents are Russian—
white Russian. Igor’s father was
going to college, when, in 1918
the Bolsheviks captured the town
(with an unpronounceable name).
His parents—that's Iyor’s grand-
parents—became pilgrims and mi-
grated to Palestine, but he stayed
on, joined the volunteer White
Russian band and fought to regain
the little college town.

Some of his White Russian
Army experiences make the perils
of Palestine petty. Once when
guarding an ammunition train dur-
ing an attack, it blew up. The
father and dozens of others were
buried, unconscious, under tons of
dirt. The fellow above Igor’s father
happened to have his feet sticking
above ground. Rescuerers dug the
man out and so uncovered Mr.
Sviatoslavsky’s hand. Thus he

wred* artist will be Hilde Gueden,

the theme. The series will be con-
tinued by Dr. Thompson at the
regularly scheduled. chapel serv-
ices on Monday, Tuesday, and
Wednesday mornings and at special
evening services on Monday and
Tuesday nights.

Althongh a theme like Christian
ethics presents an opportunity for
the discussion of generalities, such
will not be the case. The topic will
be dealt with by means of sermons,
but the emphasis will be placed
upon the practical rather than the
theoretical problems of life.

Such things as drinking, gam-
bling, sex, and honesty will be
thorongitly discussed, and student
buil sessions. are planned to imme-
diately follow the evening sérvices.

Dr. Thompson will bring two
seminary students to assist in
personal interviews and dis-
cussions. He, himself, will be
available for such consultation
in the afternoons.

Petersburg, Virginia, in 1913, and
attended public schools in Rich-
mond, At Davidson, where he re-
ceived his A. B. degree in 1934, he

ODK, and Kappa Sigma social fra-
ternity.

He received his B.D. degree from
Union Theological Seminary in
1939, his Ph. TD. from Yale in
1949, and an honorary D.D. from
Hampden.Sydney College in 1950.
From 1942-1945 Dr. Thompson was
a chaplain serving with the 45th
Gen. Hospital, 81st Armored Re-
connaissance Battalion, 804th Tank.
