Mysterious ‘Nozy Broom’

A new public enemy No. 1
has arisen on the Davidson
campus with the ascent of one
“Nozy Broom” to the pedestal
of mysterious pestiferousness.

Times have now come to pass so
that a poor innocent little Wildcat
student cannot have a_ perfectly

newshound to find out his identity
and exterminate him in a peaceful
manner. However, no one seems to
know when he comes or when he
goes. They only know that he has
been and does not mind declaring

his observations (in his column).

In a recent interview, the editor
of thispape?, declared that he and
Nozy were the only two living per-
sons who actually knew his identity.
As for the numerous so-called
“scouts” of Nozy, they are merely
stooges who work for the man be-
hind the scenes,-oblivious of evervy-
thing but his “nom de plume.” May
it be added that it is thought they
receive a small remuneration fo:
their snooping services.

However, Mr. Smith has no

Mr. Smith states that in order
that the bureau may be of any

the alumni to lend their support

the League of Nations on interna-
tional relations, and of Moscow and
Wall Street on finance. “We are
at sea, and the Compass of Custom
no longer shows the way,” he said.

What, then, can guide the indi-
vidual? A high opinion of oneself
can do it, according to the speaker.
Let a man appreciate the sacred
things that are within him. “Now
are we the sons of God,” he quoted
from I. John. Such an attitude of
appreciation, he said, recognizes
good and evil in their true light
instinctively. A man with that at-
titude obeys something inside him,
and so takes his standard with him.

Another value of that high opin-
ion of one’s worth is that it will help
him to do right. “Noblesse oblige,”

he said, “Noble birth demands
noble deeds.” Shadrach, Meshach,
and Abednego had power from

such an opinion of themselves. And
the early missionaries gained their
strength from an appreciation of
their worth: These men _ kept
faith with something within them.

The story, he said, is told that the
captain of the Titanic, when ,ask-
ing for courage and bravery in the
face of doom from his officers, tised

this phrase: “Be British! Be
British!” in order to remind them
of their heritage. Mr. Redhead

reminded his audience of its heri-
tage with these words: “Be sons of
God.” “And eyery man that hath
this hope within him purifieth
himself, even as God is pure,” con-
cluded the minister, quoting his text
from I. John,

This was the first time that

Mrs. Robson States That in
Fall Principal Worry Is
Physical Exams

FEW SERIOUS CASES

Nurse Ascribes Lack of Sick-
ness to Automobile

Business is bad; at least it
is that way down at the Dav-
idson infirmary. According to
Mrs. A. B. Robson, veteran
nurse, there have been only
about forty inmates at the col-
lege hospital this year. ‘From
the first of school until Thanksgiv-
ing,” she said, ‘the physical exams,
not sickness, are our principal
worry. However, just before Christ-
mas we always have quite a num-
ber of boys here with colds and
such started from being cooped up
in hot rooms.”

During the month of September
about twelve boys were sick. In
October the number ran to twenty-
two, and far this has
mounted to-only six. The average
stay of patients at the infirmary
this term has been about two and
a half days.

“We have had two appendicitis
cases, though,” she said. “Of course
any cases which are at all serious
we send on to the city hospital;
we simply doctor the boys when
they are down for a day or so.”

Mrs. Robson attributes the lack
!of sickness in recent years to the
} automobile. ‘Before the auto, a
| great many of the students came
{to Davidson from small towns and
|farms, where they had _ stayed
| healthy practically all their lives.
| Now, though, the automobile takes
them to picture shows and public
