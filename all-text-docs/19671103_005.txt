THE CASE FOR VW‘S

The other day while rambling through the pages
of this newspaper, I happened to see that some pundit
had compared Davidson’s football program with a
Volkswagen puttering along in the Indianapolis 500.
My word.

Once | had finished marveling at the brilliance
of this analogy, I continued reading and found that the
author was concerned about Davidson’s less than spec-
tacular record. Since the college has apparently escalat-
ed its committment to football, he argued, Davidson
should expect to see some positive results for its in-
vestment. But alas, he feels the ’Cats have seen little
glory, because Davidson's requirements and capacities
cannot, and should not, maintain a successful, big-time
team.

But, warns our helpful friend, the evil geniuses
in the athletic department are not content to lose to

The Citade! and University of Richmond. They want to.

lose to teams like Duke, State and Virginia. Horrors.

So, the argument goes, why not devalue football
and return to the bad old days when losing was cheap-
er and wins came slower than service at Lefty’s.

It’s a good argument. But it’s a better fairy tale.
The argument is weak because the basic premises are
grounded in ignorance. First Davidson apparently has
no master plan to expand the football program for be-
yond the capabilities of the college. There are no plans
to schedule Georgia, N. C. State or even Duke. The
only “master plans” that has been devised for sched-
uling are those worked out by the faculty committee
on athletics and a group of Davidson graduates, in-
cluding Will Jackson and Quay Blalock.

This group decided that Davidson ‘should play
most of its games within the Southern Conference.
This means not only teams like Furman, but teams like
East Carolina and William and Mary.

Then each year Davidson would schedule a super-
ior, non-conference team for, in Coach Homer Smith’s
words, “a one-shot try.”

A single addition, they reasoned, would not upset
the college nor constitute an expansion of the pro-
gram. Any competitor realizes the value in playing
superior competition. And the chance for an upset is
always a factor. Once these teams had been on the
schedule for a “one shot,” they would. not be re-
scheduled as a rule. This hardly constitutes a real
“expansion” of the program.

And don’t imagine that for his “one shot” teams,
Homer Smith has arranged massacres with teams like
Southern Cal, Georgia or Alabama. Rounding out
schedules for the 1960s Smith has scheduled, on rec-
ommendation of the faculty committee on athletics,
games with Virginia and Vanderbilt.

And you can climb down from the ceiling, since
Virginia doesn’t play football like it parties and Vandy
doesn't compete like it studies. Virginia has been on
the schedules of Southern Conference teams for years
now, and few people consider the Cavaliers to be as
tough as other teams in the ACC. As a matter of fact,
the Cavaliers lost to a Southern Conference foe this
season. It was VMI.

Keith, Poole Deliver Punch
As Wildcats Maul Huskies

When the Wildcats went
north last weekend to play
the University of Connecticut
at its Homecoming game. the
fans were rustling through
programs to find out what
Davidson was. When the ‘Cats
left, local sports buffs were
calling them the best team
they’d seen this season.

With the number one passer
in the nation, Jimmy Poole.
and a promising junior half-
back named Kerry Keith, the
‘Cats put together an offen-
sive punch that knocked the
Huskies for a 38-18 loop on
their home field in Storrs,
Conn.

While Davidson's offense
rolled over UConn's highly-
rated defense, the fledgling
Wildcat defense held the
Huskies’ offense cold until the
final moments of the game.

“I've never seen anything
like it.” said Coach Homer

Smith. ‘‘We came out on that
field and the stadium was
filled with their Homecoming
crowd. It was a big game for
them and they thought they
would win. But before long
we'd moved the ball more
than 200 yards before they'd
gotten a first down.”

What seemed to give Da
vidson the explosive edge
was the air-ground attack
combination of Poole and
Keith. Poole fired 39 passes
and connected on 23 for 297
yards. Meanwhile junior Ker-
ry Keith didn’t let his injured
leg stop him from scoring a
touchdown each period to
lead the individual scoring.

Keith's most dramatic
touchdown run came in the
third quarter. when the full
back galloped 59 yards
through UConn’s shredded
defense. His other scores
came on short dives over the

line.

‘Cat end George Hannen
added another six points
when he scored on a 13-yard
pass from sophomore reserve
quarterback. Gordon Slade.

Defensive captain John
Giles added three points with
a field goal to wrap up the
scoring for the ‘Cats.

Connecticut’s scoring first
came in the second quarter
on a 10-yard sprint by quar.
terback Paul Gruner. Regular
quarterback Pete Petrillo
scampered for 10 yards while
fullback Mike Boyrczeski
plunged for two to give Con-

necticut the rest of their
scores.
Davidson kciked off to

UConn to open the game. But
Giles nailed Petrillo with a
hard tackle on the ensuing
play. forcing him to fumble
and give the Wildcats posses-
sion. Keith scored on a short

This season his dazzling
performances, even when his
team is losing, have prompt-
ed some observers fo see
him es an All-American nom-
Inee. Poole hes also been
ranked fifth in the nation in
total offense.

Part of Poole’s success lies
in his mastery of fundament-
al skills of quarterbacking.
“We are thinking of using
Jimmy's passing style in our
training films,"’ Smith said.
“He keeps the bail up, al-
ways ready to throw as good
quarterbacks have to do.”

Poole gives his teammates
credit for his success."’ The
offensive line has kept the
defense away from me," he
said, ‘‘and this is the real
secret of my passing success
this year.”

Poole Is a cool commander
on the field who calls his own
plays even when the pressure
is on.” Jimmy calls most all
of the plays,’’ Smith = said.
“Our job Is to keep plays in
front of him in case he wants
fo use them. He calls games
as well as he passes.”
