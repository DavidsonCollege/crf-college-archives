Administration temporarily shuts down men’s
basketball web site due to miscommunication

By WiLL RoBERSON
Sports Editor

An apparent lack of communication has
led President Bobby Vagt to temporarily shut
down www.davidsonbasketball.net until the
site can be moved onto college web servers.

The web site,.a brain-child of the Fast
Break Club, was designed primarily “to get
the word about Davidson basketball out to
recruits and fans in an innovative way,” ex-
plained assistant men’s basketball coach Matt
Matheny.

The money to finance the site was provided
by the Fast Break Club, the support group for
Davidson men’s basketball. The site
was active temporarily around the start
of the school year, but is currently
“under construction” as it is moved
onto college web servers.

The site
www.davidsonbasketball.net con-
tained many interesting features such
as a virtual tour of Belk Arena, player
and staff profiles, and was to include
video highlights in the near future.
The web site was quickly developed
and placed on the internet. “We had a tremen-
dously positive response the small time it was
on the internet, as to the way it looked and the
way it got our message out,” said Matheny.

But the organizers of the site forgot one
very small but important step in its develop-
ment. “I was not contacted before the site

Davidson Basketball

wentup,” said President Vagt. “Ihad no prior
knowledge of the web site until someone
said, ‘Hey, have you seen this?’”

Vagt’s response was to temporarily shut
down the web site. . “If

Club is an official part of Davidson College.
Therefore, www.davidsonbasketball.net is
an official college web site and should be on
our server. Something like catkid.com is
completely dif-

there’s a Davidson web
site about a Davidson
program, it ought to be
accessible through
www.davidson.edu,
and it ought to be hosted
by our server,” ex-
plained Vagt. “We don’t want to take the
chance that a well-intended person would do
something that would jeopardize our status.”
Control over the content
of the web site was an im-
portant issue to Davidson
fi) administration. “There was

the consistency we’ re look-
ing for,” commented ath-
letics director Jim Murphy.
“The site went up a little
bitearly, it’s not anybody’s
fault, but anticipation for the final product led
to jumping the gun. It appears that the vast
majority will transfer to the college server
without any problem.”
But what about the Fast Break Club’s right
to post freely on the internet?
President Vagt explained, “The Fast Break

ferent, as that site
has no affiliation
with the school
whatsoever.”

Coach
Matheny agreed,
saying, “The Fast
Break Club is part of Davidson College, and
therefore is definitely under its jurisdiction.
The internet brings a ton of new technology.
I obviously didn’t ask the right questions
during the development of the site.”

Now that all the major players appear to be

shortly—but on college servers. “Everyone
agrees itis a great web site. After some

. minor modifications, it should be up shortly,”

said Murphy.

Added Matheny, “This is only a minor
setback before we get it live again on the
Davidson server. President Vagt and Jim
Murphy have both been supportive of us
getting it back up—the right way. My think-
ing is that it’s going to be in addition to what
we already have on davidson.edu. The col-
lege already has a great, very informative
web site that www.davidsonbasketball.net
will supplement. It’s going to be a great
recruiting tool for us.”

Voice of Cats Frank Santore resigns

By Matr GarFIELD
News Editor

The voice of the Wildcats no longer be-
longs to Frank Santore.

After six years as Davidson’s radio com-
mentator, Santore resigned in early October,
leaving athletics officials scurrying to find a
replacement.

Ticket Of-
fice Man-
ager Lee
Sargent will
join long-
time color
commenta-
tor Dave
Fagg in the
broadcast
booth for
Davidson’s
four remain-
ing football
games, said athletic director Jim Murphy.

The school hopes to name a replacement in
the next few weeks from a pool of about six
candidates, Murphy said.

“We’ re ona pretty quick timeline,” he said.
Murphy declined to name the candidates,
but said the school is seeking someone with
broadcasting experience and who is familiar
with Davidson and its profile.
- Broadcasters are paid what he calls a “‘nomi-
nal fee” on a “per broadcast” basis.

“They’re not in it for the money,” aid
Murphy.

The school’s most pressing priority is find-
ing someone to broadcast men’s basketball
games, which begin Nov. 6. In the spring, a
more long-term search may begin, he said. ~

According to Murphy, Santore quit shortly
after walking out of the booth before a men’s
home soccer game against Virginia Military
Academy that he was scheduled to broadcast
on Oct. 3.

When reached, Santore declined to com- :

ment on the record.

But it is widely believed that Santore, who
commuted from Tennessee, left because of a
perceived lack of respect from officials in the
athletic department.

Murphy said he was disappointed to re-
ceive the resignation, but that Santore was
given fair treatment.

“We’ve tried to treat Frank as a profes-
sional,” said Murphy. “We certainly had
disagreements. (But) in my. mind there was
no lack of respect.”

The Davidson radio network faces heavy
competition from area schools such as Duke

_and Clemson, Murphy said. Mooresville’s

WHIP (1350 AM) carries football games.
Two stations, WAGI (105.3 FM) out of
Gaffney, SC and Charlotte’s WMIX (106.1
FM), carry men’s basketball games.

Most fans listen to games over the phone -

or Internet, Murphy said. By calling
TEAMLINE at 1-800-846-4700 and enter-
ing team code 1143, fans from anywhere in
the U.S. can listen to selected games for as
low as 15 cents a minute. Games can also be

heard for free on BroadcastAmerica.com.: ©

Murphy said having a strong radio net-
work is only one of the athletic department’ s
many priorities.

“Extra air time is not going to enhance the
experience of our students,” he said. “But
it’s nice to have the publicity for the school.
It’s a (public relations) effect more than
anything else.” ,
