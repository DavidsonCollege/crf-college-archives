Goodall speaks to Davidson students in and out of class

strength if the eagle is to fly cor-
rectly.” She added, “I think the
women’s movement in many re-
spects has been good. We now
have the right to vote and other
such things, but some extreme
women’s activism has gotten out
of hand.”

Goodall talked about riding in
a squad car in South Central Los
Angeles when starting a Roots and
Shoots program for a local school.

The police told her that it had
been a quiet day so far when after
four hours, there had been only
three homicides.

Goodall commented, “When
speaking to the students, if [leaned
more than six inches to either side
the microphone would screech.
Teachers kept walking up and down
the aisles, and I later found out that
they were looking for guns and
knives. How can anyone ever
imagine living like this?”

Her humanitarian efforts there
resulted in 50 students joining her
program. A play that was put on
the next time she came marked the
first time in the school’s history
that a group of students had jointly
displayed their work.

Goodall responded to an in-
quiry on the debate between cre-
ationism and evolution. “I think
there is definitely a higher power.
That’s where I get my motivation.
I draw from it. I find it hard to
believe that humans for all these
years have believed in God, and
yet there’s nothing to it. Are they
all stupid or something? There
must be a higher power. Louis
Leakey and I agreed that there was
absolutely no conflict between a
coexistence of most religions and
evolution. I also believe in an
afterlife,” she said.

Near the end of the reception,
Goodall dumped a full grocery bag
of donation money into the middle
of the floor and asked that every-
one count it together. Those left
found a comfortable spot on the
floor and started counting. “It fol-

lows with what I’m trying to do,”
she later explained. “I just want
everyone to be involved.”
Dr. Verna Case’s animal
behavior class

Dr. Goodall answered ques-
tions for about 50 animal behavior
students in a closed session before
the lecture.

Junior Adrienne Emmett
asked how she first got interested
in animals. “I’ve loved animals
since birth,’ Goodall responded.
“All I ever read was books about
animals. By the time I was nine I
was in love with Tarzan and ex-
tremely jealous of Jane.”

She told of a time as a child
when she sat in a hen house all day

_waiting to see an egg laid. Later

she commented, “Waiting and lis-
tening instead of figuring out
quicker laboratory methods pro-
duces purer results.”

Goodall discussed the best
way to go about conservation. “If
you’ re too confrontational, people
won’t listen. Many people, espe-
cially in Africa, are killing animals
or cutting down trees to feed their
families. We have to help and to
educate them. My going into
some chimpanzee research labora-
tory and making extreme demands
is like going to Auschwitz and
telling them that it’s inhumane.
We must talk so that people lis-
ten.” She challenged the class to
pursue projects at Davidson that
would benefit the environment,
animals, and humans all at once.
“Every one of us counts,” she said.

She also expressed disap-
proval at cold and impersonal sci-
ence. “That’s why there’s been a
drop-off in young people going
into science recently... I’d rather

‘be known as a human being with

feelings and a sense of humor. It
hasn’t been a good day until I’ve
made someone laugh and some-
one else has made me laugh.”

Students came away from the
class thrilled.

Kelly Schmidt commented,
“After I got over the initial shock,
I was amazed at how down-to-

earth she was. She makes her life
seem so simple. I can’t even put it
into words. Listening has increased
my admiration even more.”
Regina Marranzini added,
“What really impressed me was
her compassion. She wasn’t the
cold science type at all.”
At lunch with students
Most found Goodall’s discus-
sion of Gary Larson, author of The
Far Side, very entertaining. As
Case recalls, “‘A lot of scientists
thought (Goodall) would be of-
fended by Larson’s cartoon, but

~ she thought it was hilarious. She

seemed to admire him.a lot, and
said he was shy and very down to
earth. He’s also been to her re-

‘search station in Gom|

The cartoon in question shows

one chimp picking a blond hair off’

the back of another saying “Con-
ducting little more research with
that Jane Goodall tramp?”

Senior Brandon Davis asked
Goodall how she liked working
with hyenas.

“T actually enjoyed it just as
much as working with the chimps,”
she replied.

She added that she was forced
to study something besides chimps
for two years because of the dan-
ger they posed to her infant son
Grub.

She told the group that had she
not studied chimps, elephants
would probably be her next choice.

Senior Kelly Ammann was
curious about a time in 1975 when
guerrillas from Zaire took a few
dozen civilians hostage near

Goodall’s research station.
Goodall admitted to being very

frightened, and hadn’t minded

when the Tanzanian government
pulled she and her research crew
out of Gombe.
At the press conference one re-
porter during the press conference
asked Dr. Goodall “what chimps
would say to us if they could talk”.
He was greeted with a pause
and a cold stare before she replied,
“I don’t know. And it is because
they don’t talk that I don’t know.”
