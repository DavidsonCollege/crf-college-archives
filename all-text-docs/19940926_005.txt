Independent
representative
didn't make
ballot

By Randy Hartwell, Ashlyn
Dannelly, and Russ Tarver

Voters in Wednesday’s
Homecoming queen elections
didn’t find an independent candi-
date among their choices. “We
tried putting up nomination slips,”
says head SGA independent sena-
tor Saad Gul, “but nobody really
paid any attention.”

In an effort to at least get a
name on the ballot, the senators
chose Daniela Welsh. “But we
didn’t get her name in on time to
(Patterson Court Council president)
Josh Worsham,” Gul says. A blank
space appeared beside the word
“Independent” on the ballot.

Welsh and other independents
are furious. “I don’t want the inde-
pendents to feel like they weren’t
represented because their elected
representatives weren’t orga-
nized,” says Welsh. “We made an
effort.”

She explains that the indepen-
dent representatives were justifi-
ably unaware of their responsibili-
ties towards Homecoming because
they were elected only days before
the candidates names were to be
turned in.

Worsham says, “I knew that
there had to be an independent
representative on the ballot, but
the PCC was not incharge of choos-
ing that individual. I did not re-
ceive the name of the independent
representative in time to include

her on the ballot. I assumed that it
would be the independent senator’s
responsibility to choose their rep-
resentative, just as itis each house’s
responsibility.”

Worsham continues, “I con-
tacted Saad Gul and Jonathon Orr
a week before the election and let
them know we needed a represen-
tative.” :

The PCC postponed the elec-
tion from Monday to Wednesday
in hopes of including an indepen-

dent representative but still did not
receive a name from the senators.
Welsh says, “The message
sent to freshmen Saturday was that
unless you’ re in a fraternity or eat-
ing house, then you’ re not a part of
the campus. People should recon-
sider the whole Homecoming
queen tradition because judging
from this episode, it is obvious the
campus is treating it as a farce. We
shouldn’t do something so half-
heartedly.” —

Salazar says. Salazar also enjoyed
herself on the court Saturday night
because she could visit her friends
at all the houses. “It was fun to do
our court tours last night, espe-
cially as alumni. Itreminded me of
freshman year.”

The alumni made their pres-
ence known by the overwhelming
number who participated in the
festivities. Sophomore Jill Reger
says, “I was surprised and pleased
by the level of committment and
attatchment demonstrated by the
alumni for Davidson.”

Class of '94 enters
"the real world":
doctors, lawyers, & bankers

By Mary Laura Moretz
Davidson’s most recent

alumni have spread to all ends of -

the earth. A recent survey by the
Careers Office revealed some of
the trends in first year graduates'
life.

Of the 227 members of the
class of ‘94 who responded, just
under a fourth of them now attend
either graduate or professional
schools. Of those, about half chose
medical or law schools.

Jeffrey Hart, now a student at
Duke University School of Law,
feels Davidson prepared him “very,
very well” for law school. “The
research, writing, and arguing skills
that you get from the liberal arts
education are exactly what I’m
using now.”

As faras lifestyle is concerned,
Hart feels graduate school is “a
happy medium” between college
life and the working world. “It’s
like a job, because I work all day,
but the social life is similar to
Davidson.”

Some graduates chose to go
abroad to continue studying or be-
gin teaching. They have relocated
to places suchas Malaysia, Greece,
Germany, Spain, and Kenya.
Seven members of ‘94 are cur-
rently teaching and learning in Ja-
pan. A-few students even went

abroad to play professional sports.
Other graduates decided to

plunge into employment immedi-

ately. Davidson graduates are
working in banks, schools, art
museums, medical labs, and count-
less other types of businesses.
Jennifer Beahm is now in the
Consumer Management Associate
Training Program at Nationsbank
in Charlotte. She agrees with Hart
that “Davidson exposes you to the
writing, math, etc. that you needin

-the real world.” Mostly, Beahm

says, “Davidson teaches you to
learn.”

Beahm lives in an apartment
by herself just outside of Charlotte
and says, “It’s really strange get-
ting up at 6:30 and working until
5:00. It’s totally different. I’m
getting used to wearing high heels
and a suit every day!”

Several alumni listed their
current occupation as “taking time
off.” For some, this means living
at home for a few months or trav-
elling before starting work. A few
graduates have taken extra time to
prepare for the next step in educa-
tion.

Josh Larned “made that late
decision to go Pre-med” as a his-
tory major at Davidson. He now
lives in Athens, Georgia, where he
takes classes to prepare for medi-
cal school in a couple of years. “I
guess we’ve got plenty of time
right now,” Larned says. “I’m
thinking about getting a research
job, but for now I’m just study-

ing.”
