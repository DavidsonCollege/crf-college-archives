Connell’s At Home
With Classical Style

The Connells
One Simple Word
TVT Records

The Connells, David. and
Mike, vocalist Doug MacMillan,
drummer Peele Wimberley and
guitarist George Huntley have
reached a medium with their new
work, One Simple Word. This is
good and bad. ;

It is good in that its not an-
other disgustingly blatant attempt
to push themselves into the main-
stream like their last album, Fun
and Games, but it is bad in that it
falls way short of the album that
put them into a position to do such
a thing, Boylan Heights.

The latter came out after the
bands first major release, Darker
Days, which didn’t doa whole lot
for them. Heights, in addition to
giving Wildcat alternative fans.
weeks of sweet listening and being
mandatory on every mixed tape
made that semester, gave them
something to be proud of. The
Connells are from Charlotte
(Boylan Heights is a suburb
therein) and one canalmost tell by
listening. The album was, andis, a
“Jeaver.”

That is, one puts it on the turn-
table, in the tape-deck or compact

disc player and leaves it until the
music stops. It is solid. All the
tracks are worth hearing and you
listen to them in their entirety, in
order, over and over. I would
compare Heights to the Feelies’
The Good Earth in this aspect and
in its intentional and welcome
monotony but wouldn’t want you
to think that the Connells “rock”
like the Feelies.

Where thatband’s tunes regu-
larly get violently rapid and often-
times build to border on a type of
skate-thrash, the Connells stay
safely within a gamut of pleasing
mid-range tempos at their fastest
and still euphonious harmonies at
their most distorted. The Connells
stay true to this on Word, but it is
not a “leaver.” It gets touched a
lot.

You take it out after the first
five songs, maybe six. The Fish
does six then skips to “The Joke”
at number ten but no one sits
through the whole thing especially
not with a trio of weaklings like
the title track, “Another Souve-
nir,” and,”Link,” right there in the
middle at seven, eight and nine.

There are thirteen tracks in all
beginning with,”Stone Cold Yes-
terday,” a beautiful mix of the
simplistic guitar styles of Mike
Connell and Huntley with the

little less cohesive and depressing
than Mould/Smith) in a distanced,
mid-south voice. In other words;
he sings New York City lyrics with
a Charlotte accent. The combina-
tion works though. .

“Get A Gun,” is my favorite
cut now that I’ve quit looking for
meaning in the lyrics; “She never
listens to me at night/Geta gun, get
a gun we’re losing altitude?”
[Digression: Guitarist Huntley told
me that “Home Today,” one of the
only Connells songs with mean-
ing, is not about the Charlotte
female it was rumored to be about. ]
Inthe same weird but mellow strain
is “What Do You Want?” which
ends with a whisper possibly an-
swering the title’s query with,
“hand jive/hand jive.”

This is not the only random ut-
tering the album, “Too Gone,” ex-
poses MacMillan’s strange delight
in dance funk when, at the end, he
utters slightly altered lyrics
from,’Let The Music Play (He
Won’t Get Away).” “Too Gone”

along with,”Waiting My Tum,”

also keeps the Connells’ tradition
of employing classical instrumen-
tation alive, this time with trum-
pet, cello and oboe.

We have to give in slightly to
regional prejudice when grading
One Simple Word, the Connells
are our neighbors. But you also
hate to give them a good grade
when you know by listening to
Heights that they can do much
better. In a simple letter; B+. The
plus is for not putting out another
Fun and Games and only bozos
use minus grades.

. And speaking of grades...
Short Show Review

... this re-
view is second hand because I’m
making an effort to get out of the
bottom third of my class (Right, I
think I can gain a lot of ground on
the three-fivers with two grading
periods left in my college career).
With it being monsoon season as
far as term papers go, I was way
too busy to go see any shows this
past week. Here's a -second hand
