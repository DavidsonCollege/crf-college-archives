Scott Charges Davidson

By GRAY WILSON
Managing Editor
North Carolina Governor
Robert W. Scott stressed
“the importance of being
unique’ in his .address to
the Spring Awards Convoca-

tion last Tuesday.

After apologizing for a
slight case of laryngitis and
ribbing Davidson for its slow
progress in coeducation, Scott
turned to more sober issues,
stating four major crises
that threatened the. Ameri-
can birthright.

The first of the major pro-
blems he listed is the war in
Vietnam, about which the
state government could do
very little to remedy.

Scott said, ‘Americans do
not bring forth sons as gifts
to the nation; Americans
bring forth’ a nation as a
gift to their sons.”

Scott cited the second pro-

5 Blacks Plan Definitely
To Enroll At Davidson

By DOUG BROWN
Asst. Managing Editor

Thirty-five blacks applied
to Davidson this year for ad-
mission’ to ithe Class of 1975,
an increase over past years,
according to the Office of
Admissions.

Some applications are pend-
ing, but so far 11 blacks have
been admitted for next year.
According to Assistant Direc-
tor of Financial Aid Peter
V. Sterling, ‘Five black stu-
dents have decided definitely
to attend Davidson next
year.”’ :

The Office of Admissions
is attempting to get a black’
on its staff, but so far it has
been unsuccessful. “‘A black
recruiter would help greatly
in increasing the number of
blacks who ‘apply to David-
son,’’ said Sterling.

“<The reasons blacks. are
hesitant to attend Davidson

are its location in a~small
southern town, the small
number of blacks presently
here, sand ithe limited social
life,’ explained Sterling.
According to a number of
black students a larger num-
ber of blacks do not apply
to (Davidson because it is a
white, southern, upper-mid-
dle class college with a very
inadequate social life.
*The small number of blacks
presently here do not make
Davidson attractive to pros-
pective blacks, they feel.
They point out that there is
not a black member of the
regular faculty,” and David-
son's recruiting practices are

poor in relation to other
schools of Davidson's cali-
ber,

Of over 1,000 students, only
11 are black, and one black
student said, ‘It's obvious

blem as ‘‘contihuing extrem-
ism. No child is born an
alien to his fellows. . . I
count myself among those
Southern governors urging
the citizenery toward a new
South that could lead the
earth in tolerance. The po-
tential of the new South is
too great to be slowed down
by bigotry, hatred, or con-
flict.

‘Damage to the environ-
ment’? is the next problem,
one of ‘‘fearsome potential.”
Scott said that he had _ in-
troduced legislation into the
General Assembly to ‘“‘stop
the deterioration of the pre-
sent and to begin to safe-
guard the future.” ©

Finally, Scott turned his
attention to the last problem,
“education — particularly
private higher education.”’

He remarked that there are
bills presently under ¢con-
sideration in the state that
“will remove all financial
barriers to higher education
for young men and women
resident here.”

He added, ‘In a country
as complicated as ours has
become, we must consider
education a means toward
each individual’s fulfilling his
unique potential for service
to others.”

Scott then spoke diréctly to
the Davidson educational en-
vironment. He asked ‘‘wheth-
er there is not a position of
uniqueness that Davidson has
yet to achieve.”

Queens Girls To Enter
Coed Exchange Program

The coed population at Da-
vidson is expected to be in-
creased next year with the
inauguration of an exchange
program between Davidson
and Queens based on the
model of the Eight College
Exchange program.

According to Jay H. Ost-
walt, director of instruction-
al development, the proposal
was initiated by Queens dur-
ing the present school year.

The Queens faculty approv-
ed the measure last Friday.
The Educational Policy com-
mittee at Davidson had ap-
proved it earlier in April.

Ostwalt forsees two major
benefits in the exchange for
Davidson and Davidson stu-
dents.

“We were after numbers
as far as our coeds were
concerned. Wednesday we
talked with five Queens stu-
dents who were interested in
the program ‘and we hope
that we can get five or six
at Davidson in the fall,”’ Ost-
walt said.

Ostwalt added that the
women’s residence ‘will not
be filled with coeds from the
Eight College Exchange pro-
gram since only five students
will come from women's
schools on the program next
fall.

The chief advantage will
be ‘curricular according to
Ostwalt. ‘Queens is on a 4-1-4

program and we think that
the short middle term could
be very useful to us in our
own programs such as the
Washington semester.”’

The short term at Queens
is a combination of regular
on-campus offerings togeth-
er with off-campus courses
such as pre-Columbian ar-
chaeology in Mexico, tropical
botany in the Carribean and
skiing and_ conversational
German in Switzerland.

To Assume Greater Role

ship, Scott went on to say
that the faculty and students
also complement the excel-
lent resources at Davidson
necessary to assume a unique
role.

He concluded, ‘‘Education
is irrelevant when its aim is
for anything. less than to
fulfill the wish. of all men
for a better, richer life in
a more peaceful, more tol-
erant society. . . An institu-
tion is not a person, but its

‘members can achieve excel-

lence for it, and if they are
able and committed, they can
give it uniqueness.”

The awards ceremony fol-
lowed the address, and then
an honorary Doctor of Laws
degree was conferred on
Scott by the college.

After the assembly, Scott
fielded a few questions from
THE DAVIDSONIAN .al-
though a press conference
with the college news bureau
could not be scheduled.

Responding to a question on
state funds for private insti-
tutions, Scott»said, ‘‘We hope
we can make a_ beginning.
Tm certainly recommending
it.

“T want to get the principle
established, and even if we
can get only token support
I think we will have. accom-
plished our purpose. We
won't be able to fund the
program heavily this time the
cause our funds are not in
real good shape, but at least
we can get something start-
ed.”

Commenting on his future
plans, Scott said that ‘‘the
electorate will decide that,
and my family will have a
voice in my plans after the
governorship. At present I
expect to be back at Haw
River after my term ex-
pires.”

There was a dinner out
on the lawn afterwards, and

mores and their parents at-

posal, expressed cautious Op-
timism ‘about the faculty ac-
tion.

“I'm glad they didn't slam
the door in our faces like
they have done in the past
on some issues. I am also

‘encouraged that the faculty

plans to seriously -eonsider
the proposal we asked for.

“Of the three proposals the
one they selected truly rep-
resents the actual meaning
of open faculty meetings,”’
said Lear.

In ather action, the an-
nouncement was made to the
faculty concerning the pro-
posal to sallow student nepre-
sentation on the faculty Bud-

sions Committee.

This proposal is also an
amendment to the faculty
constitution and must follow
the amendment procedure.

The proposal for a change
in the physical education re-
quirement was tabled until
the next meeting for lack of
time. Under* this proposal
each student would have to
pass proficiency tests in five
sports, while class attend-
ance would not be required.

“I'm very optimistic about
the physical education pro-
posal,’ said Clodfelter. ‘“‘It
has been approved by the
phys ed department, favor-
ed by Dr. Bevan, passed by
the EPC, and backed by the
students.

“TI don’t see how they can
turn it down,” he said.
