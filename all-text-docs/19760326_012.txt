Players react to Brickles’ dismissal

By BRUCE HOLLIDAY
Sports Editor

Brickles’ eyes moistened
and his voice choked when he
talked about not being around
to see his freshmen recruits
develop.

“That's going to hurt,” he
said. ‘‘If it were not for the
freshmen I think I could take
it, but that’s going to be very
painful.”’

Former Head Coach
Bo Brickles in
The Charlotte Observer

Bo Brickles felt a great loss
when he learned that he would
no longer be coaching the six
freshmen with whom he had
hope to turn around David-
son’s basketball fortunes. But
how do those same freshmen
feel about Brickle’s departure
and the basketball program in
general?

At least one, Art Leahy,
was not happy at Davidson
and left at the end of the
second term to return to the
west coast. Leahy’s departure
was attributed more to home-
sickness than to the basketball
program, however.

Five others are still here and
have some definite opinions on
the Brickles affair. Pat
Hickert was strongest in his
feeling that Brickles was not
treated fairly.

“I think he got the shaft in
the way it was handled. I
heard that he had talked to the
players and the overwhelming
thing was that he was an inept
coach. But they only talked to
Eppa (Rixey) and Jay
(Powell).”’

Center Tom Dore, con-
sidered Brickles top prize
during last season’s recruiting
wars, was surprised by the
move to replace his coach.

“‘T was told that he was
given a two year contract with

a

JIM RICE, JOHN GERDY AND TOM DORE go for net during this year’s disappointing

season. The young Cats look to the future with hope but uncertainty

a probable extension and
that’s what I expected. I
thought that they would give
him another year to show that
he could build us_ into
winners.”’

Jim Rice would not con-
demn the administration’s
move but felt that Brickles
was not dismissed properly.

“TI knew he was under a lot
of pressure but I really
expected him to be rehired. I
thought he got a raw deal. I’m
not saying that he was the
greatest coach in the world but
he was a real good man and
treated us fairly.’”’

John Gerdy, named to the
Southern Conference’s All-
Rookie team, felt that the
school lacked the proper confi-
dence in Brickles.

“One of the reasons he was
fired was because they didn’t
think he could sell the school
to recruits but they didn’t
know coach Brick. Even if we
hadn’t won a game all year he
would have still have gotten
three or four good recruits.”

DEPOSED COACH BO BRICKLES

There was some concern
that if Brickles left then, so
would his freshmen. Dore,
Rice, and Gerdy all said that
they. would stay however, and
Hickert indicated that in all
probability he would stay.

available for comment.

In the search for a new head
coach the freshmen have been
allowed to talk to candidates
for the position. However,
their opinions differ in the
amount of input they have in
selecting a new coach.

“TI don’t think we have
any,” said Gerdy. ‘“‘They say
we can talk to these guys but I
don’t believe they will ask us
what we think. They just want
to keep us happy.”’

Hickert does not feel the
players should have a hand in
the decision at all.

“They hope we’ll go along
but it’s not our decision and
really shouldn’t be. We’re
going to live with him for three
more years but the school has
to pay his salary.’’

Each of the players agreed
that they liked Brickles and no
one indicated any personal
problems with the former
coach.

‘‘The man was trying as
hard as he could and for that I
could never get mad at him.
He was a basketball whiz but I
don’t know how good he was
with personnel’? commented
Dore.

“TI liked the guy a lot. The
only thing that I didn’t like
was that he wasn’t positive
enough in situations like
practices,’’ he continued.

Rice told Brickles after the
firing that he felt as if he had
let his coach down. Dore felt
somewhat the same way.

“I guess it’s the teams fault
but then again it’s his fault.
It’s the teams fault as a whole
and that includes everybody
down the line.”

In the end, however, the
freshmen can only sympathize
with Brickles and wait for a
successor to be named.

‘‘People don’t realize how
that man put his career on the
line with a bunch of 17 and 18
year old kids running around
in underwear,’’ pointed out
Gerdy.
