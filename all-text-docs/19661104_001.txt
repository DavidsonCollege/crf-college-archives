FREDERICKSEN AT HEAD

Citizens To Protest I-77 Link

By FRANKLIN ANDERSON

Plans by the North Carolina
Highway Dept. for a thorough.
fare circling Davidson and
Cornelius have sparked oppo-
sition from a group of David-
son citizens headed by Dr. J.
M. Fredericksen, professor of
chemistry.

Cornelius previously had ap.
proved plans for a two-lane
road with limited access at a
projected cost of about $1
million.

The road would be about six
miles long and would be com-

pleted several years from now

at the earliest.

Miss Carla Miller. sponsored
by Kappa Sigma, was crowned
Homecoming Queen during half-
time of Davidson's 21-17 triumph
over The Citadel. M‘ss Martha
Williams. candidate of Beta
Theta Pi, was first runner-up.

“Davidson boys may be very
smart, but they're also very
rude,"" one of the members of
the Righteous Brothers band
commented after the show.

Cause of the hissing and boo-
ing was the acts preceding the
Righteous Brothers, Nino Tempo
and April Stevens and the Gay-
lords, a comedy team.

“The show should have been

| great but it was just all right.”

Smith commented. ‘‘The Right-

When asked why he had run
for the Miscellany post. -Vick
stated that he wanted to be the
editor. He said that he plans to
resign because he feels that th¢
magazine would profit from this
move. By allowing an‘ under
classman to be editor, a firm
foundation would be laid: for the
next year’s publications.

CONTINUITY

Vick emphasized the impor
tance of continuity. ‘All we are
trying to do is establish a mag:
azine worthy of the college, one
of which this entire community
can be proud. We do hope that
the circulation will increase and
in order to do this, there must
be some guarantee of continuity.

“This is not to say that the
Miscellany cannot change. My
changing the format this year
demonstrates this. But it must
have some foundation in talent.
taste and sound technical pol-

icy.”
NOT SECRETIVE

Vick said that he did not go
about this resignation in any
secretive manner. ‘I don’t dis-
cuss my weekend plans, my re
view grades or my editorial ac
tivities. I discussed my resig-
nation with the advisory board
of the Miscellany. If anyone
wishes to discuss this matter.
I'll be glad to talk with them.”

Trustee Meet Called
‘Quietest In Years’

The Homecoming meeting of
the Board of Trustees was
“probably the quietest in years,"

according to Fred Sackett, as-

sistant to the president.

It had the highest attendance
in several years, Sackett com-
mented, because of the revised
committee structure which now
places every trustee on a com-
mittee. .

The trustees commended the
faculty and administration on
the work on the religious life
program and joined them in sup-

port of it.

A report on the Ford Chal-
lenge Program revealed that an
additional $638,377 has been rais-
ed since June 30, bringing the
total as of Oct. 10 to $3,153,790.

On the basis of cash contribu.
tions received thruugh June 30.
the Ford Foundation has already
contributed $940,076.

In addition, the board voted a
statement of esteem to Dr. J.
McDowell Richards, past board
ptesident and president of Co-
lumbia Seminary.

Site of Proposed Warning Sign

Town Seeks RR Signal

By JOHN WILLIAMS
Staff Writer

Mayor F. L. Jackson of David-
son has announced that a warn-
ing system will be installed soon
where Griffith St., the access
road to U.S. 21 crosses the rail-
road tracks, if cucrent plans are
followed through successfully.

Installation of the signal light,
which will be of the cantilever

type, is a joint project of the
State Highway Commission and
Southern Railway estimated to
cost about $14,000.

Jackson said that he received
a copy of a letter from the high-
way commission to Southern
Railway about two weeks ago.
The letter stated that signals
are needed at this location and
that the Highway Commission is

willing to assume 90 per cent of
the estimated cost.

If Southern Ra‘lway is ready
to assume 10 per cent, said the
letter, then the project can be-
gin. According to L. H, Smith.
representative of Southern Rail-
way in Asheville, the plans are
being processed and some deci.
sion should be reached within a
month.
