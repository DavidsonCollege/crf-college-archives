Movie review

Cruise shines in Born on the Fourth of July

By MATT GOAD

Born on the Fourth of July is a movie
about the Vietnam war, but only a rela-
tively small part of the movie takes
place in Vietnam. Unlike Vietnam
movies such as Platoon or Full Metal
Jacket, it concentrates on what happens
to a Vietnam vet after his participation
in the war.

Tom Cruise plays Ron Kovic, whose
real life story provides the basis of the
movie. Ron is convinced that the com-
munists are everywhere and that soon
they will take over the United States.

Thus, he joins the Marines right out
of high school, during the first stages of
the Vietnam war. He wants to get in on

the. action before the war is over. A
bullet wound that leaves him paralyzed
from the mid-chest down sends him
home, but not before he has some expe-
riences that will haunt him through the
rest of the film.

When Ron first gets home, he is ap-
palled to find that many Americans
violently oppose thé war he has sacri-
ficed his body for. He tells people not to
pity him for hisinjury, and inmost cases
they don’t.

Instead, he must face people’s fear of
and aversion to his physical disability.
He begins to pity himself, and his atti-
tude towards the war changes. He feels
that the government has lied to him to

compel him to fight in an unpopular
war,and he objects toany further loss of
American lives in Vietnam.

To deal with his problems, Ron stays
drunk most of the time. Thisgives rise to
conflicts with his parents that lead him
toleave home. He goes to Mexico where
a community dominated by injured
Vietnam vets has developed. Ron
quickly adapts to the lifestyle of the
veterans he finds in Mexico. These vets
live in an alcoholic stupor varied only
by the visits of prostitutes and frequent
gambling. Ron manages to eventually
escape from this trap.

He returns to the U.S., where he finds

ment to a wheelchair. He becomes a
leader in an organization of Vietnam
vets against the war.

Cruise gives an enthralling portrayal
of a boy becoming an embittered man
injured in body and spirit, whocomes to
grips with the tragedy of his life and
rises above it. While the other charac-
ters float in and out of the story, Cruise
appears in every scene, and his pres-
ence acts asa cohesive force for the film.

Born on the Fourth of July is a long
movie, close to two and a half hours
long, but Cruise’s performance kept my
attention the whole time, and I
wouldn’t have minded if it was even
longer.

Children of the malt partIV ~

By JOHN HUTCHINSON

This week’s guest drinkers
were Mark McCulloh, Associ-
ate Professor of German, his
wife Audrey McCulloh, Visit-
ing Lecturer in German and
Thomas Fischer, exchange stu-
dent from Germany’s Bavaria.
We met at the McCulloh’s

home just outside’ of
Mooresville.
The move apparently fooled

Charles Houck and Tom
Moore, the Domino’s pizza
guys, as neither oneshowed up
for the tasting session.

The session saw the intro-
duction of Anheuser Busch’s
Budweiser. Intended as a sort
of yardstick to gauge the other
beers against, itinstead became
the butt of insults as the eve-
ning wore on. Thomas Fischer
called for a “Bud Bowl III,”
with any German beer as the
rival of Budweiser. The moral
is: if you want to drink
Budweiser and enjoy the taste,
never preface it with aGerman
import.

Spaten (Munich): Brewed
since 1397. Strong, pleasant
beer smell. Bitter. “Nice cereal
taste” —M. McCulloh. “Pretty
Yummy” —A. McCulloh. “It
might be a bit too bitter for
Germans” —Fischer.

Krombacher Pils (Krombach):
Sweet beer, vaguely Canadian
taste. The taste fails to distin-
guish itself. “More yeast than

hops” —M. McCulloh. “Not
the typical taste of German
beer” —Fischer.

St. Pauli Girl (Bremen): Ini-
tially bland; but
it gets some-
what better.
Smooth with a
bite. “Good for
watching foot-
ball games” —
Fischer. “I think [| ?
itisa good beera
little on the
sweet side”

McCulloh.

Beck’s (Bremen): Smoother,
fuller taste, grows on you bet-
ter than (St. Pauli Girl). “Com-
fortable to drink with food or if
you want to drink a lot” —Fis-
cher. “The aftertaste doesn’t
bite, but the carbonation both-
ers me” —M. McCulloh.
“Vegetable taste” —A.
McCulloh.

Maisel’s Weizen kristall-klar
(Bayreuth): Bright, light,
cloudy, sweet. “Tastes like a
lollypop.”. —A. McCulloh.
“Great summertime beer’—
M. McCulloh. “This is what we
in Bavaria like most. Itisa good
drinking beer” —Fischer.
“Really good if you don’t mind
the sweetness” —M.
McCulloh. Upon being told it
was Maisel’s Weizen: “Shows
you how American beer has
ruined my taste: in Germany
this is considered a poor
weizen beer” —Fischer.

Maisel’s Weisse Hefe
(Bayreuth): Nice golden color,
a bit cloudy. Good body, dis-
tinctive character. “Real cereal
taste in it” —M. McCulloh.
“Tastes like a cross between
beer and cider” —A.
McCulloh.

Hofbrau (Bavaria): Smooth,
very good. Bite gives it charac-
ter, less bite than Spaten.
“Good taste” —Fischer.

Ayinger Celebrator Doppel-
boch (Aying): Very dark color,
nice smell. Very rich and
smooth. “I couldn’t have very
much of this” —McCulloh. “It
would be wonderful with veni-

son. It wouldn’t be good witha
hamburger or cheeseburger or
something from Cornelius” —
Fischer.

Best Beer: Spaten, Hofbrau,
Maisel

Worst Beer: Krombacher, St
Pauli Girl, Beck’s

Germans take their beer very
seriously, and there isa rich
tradition of brewing in the
country. For instance, Klum-
bacher Monkshof has been
brewed since 1349, while
Spaten was first produced in
1397.

In 1516, the Reinheitsgebot, or
purity law, set standards for
brewing that are still followed
by countries the world over.
According to the Reinheitsgebot,
beer can be produced with
nothing more that pure water,
barley, hops, and yeast.

Until recently, the Germans
imported only McEwan’s
(Scottish), Touborg (Danish),
Guiness (Irish), and Budweiser

(Czechoslovakian)—beers ~

brewed in compliance with the
standardssetby the purity law.

Beer in Germany is con-
sumed in many. forms. Chil-
dren are give kinderbier, a non-
alcoholic beer with a yeast and
barley malt taste. A Russisch, or

- Russian, is a popular mixture

of weizen beer (wheat beer)
and coke. More popularduring
the summer months is the ra-
dler, a refreshing blend of lem-
onade and coke.The time of
day is not important either, as
Germans are known to con-
sume hefe weisse bier for
