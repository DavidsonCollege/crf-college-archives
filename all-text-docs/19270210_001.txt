Both Games Are Fast During First
Half But Wildcats Lose in

Last Half
At Durham and at Raleigh, the Da-
vidson quintet went down in defeat in

two hard-fought games with Duke Uni-
versity and N. C. State, on the nights of

February 2 and 3.
The squad, of ten men, with Coach
Younger and manager Mason Carroll,

left Davidson at eight o’clock Wednes-
day morning, February 2, for Raleigh.
They reached there Wednesday after-
noon, and, after a rest and a short work-
out before supper, engaged the basketeers
of State in a hard and fast game, before
a large crowd. The outcome
doubt at the end of the half, for the score
was tied, In the second half, how-
ever, State secured the lead and kept it
till the end of the game. It was in vain
that Capt. Anderson tried to rally his
men for a comeback in the last period of
play, for they showed signs of fatigue,
probably because of their long trip of
the morning. The final score
20, favor of State. McDowell was high-
point man for State, while Anderson
showed up best for Davidson.

The team remained in Raleigh Wednes-
day night, and entrained™ for Durham
Thursday morning. There, again, before
a large crowd, they tackled a team that,
though not as good as the State team,
they were unable to overcome. In the
first half Dapideon could not get to-

both have good teams. Duke especially
seems to be formidable, and fresh having

The lineup is Captain Pritchett
Johnston, at forward; Moore and Me-
Gavock at guard; and Smith, J. P. at cen-

to guard. The other men the

Heefner.

The team will be handicaped by the
loss of two regular guards, Mauze and
Baker, who could not make the trip on
account of failing to pass the required
amount of work. Prevost is out also.
Johnston’s ankle, sprained during the
Wake Forest gamé, is in shape now.

“The Hoodoo” Given Pr. J. M. Northington, of Charlotte, February 22nd Set

on Thursday Night ©

The local high school, last Thursday,
entertained the townspeople with a very |
delightful and enjoyable three-act play,
titled “The Hoodoo.” The actors
sisted wholly of talent, and de-
servedly won the commendation of all
who attended. Judging the success of
the play on the basis of the receipts, it
far excelled any that have been given in
former years, although last year’s play,
“Anne Whats-Her-Name,” starring Miss
Adele Arbuckle and McConnell,
made a big hit.

“The Hoodee” under the direction of
Miss G¥ace James, Civics and History
teacher at the High School, was taken
from Walter Ben Hare’s play bearing
that title. Miss James selected her char-
acters on a different plan this year in
the fact that she asked for volunteers for
the parts; thus insuring the co-operation
and interest of her protegees. The play
was presented in three acts—all taking
place in and about the country home of
the rich Mrs. Perrington Shine, played
by Miss Marion Erwin, who was giving
a wedding party in honor of the bridal
couple, Miss Amy Lee, acted by Miss
Lucy Currie, and Brighton Early, played
by David McGrew.

Delivers Forceful Lecture to
Medical Candidates and Many
Other Interested Students

With the hope that those men who
have not selected their life work will be
brought to a definite decision’ soon, the
‘college Y. M. C. A. brought the first
speaker of the Vocational Guidance In-
stitute to Davidson Wednesday night.
Dr. J. M. Northington, of Charlotte, who
is editor of the Southern Medical and

Surgical Journal and a pronounced leader
in his profession, spoke upon the profes-
sion of medicine.

Quite a number of men who are think-

ing ef entering this profession as well as!

those who are undecided heard Dr. Nor-
thington. His remarks were particularly
interesting because of his-standing as a
physician. Although he is a practioner |
in Charlotte,. he is giving most of his}
time to the editorship of the medical
publication. He is considered an au-
thority on graduate work, and the re-
quirements of the medical profession.
Other fields of service from which
speakers will come to address these
groups are, law, ministry, teaching and
business. Dr. M, C. S. Noble, Jr., who is
connected with ‘the state department of
education at Raleigh and a former pro-
fessor of the University of North Carolina
