Southern Conference Revises By-Laws

BY STEVE SOUD

The Southern Conference passed a
resolution last Friday forcing all mem-
bers to compete for the conference cham-
pionship in football, basketball, and at
least six other sports. Davidson, which
has not competed for the football cham-
pionship since 1973, must either play
five Southern Conference football games
by 1985 or drop out of the conference.

The Conference voted 7-1 in favor of
the proposal. Davidson’s was the only
vote against.

The Board of Trustees met this morn-
ing to decide whether to retain Confer-
ence membership. The news should
break this afternoon.

Athletic Director Ed _ Farrell
explained, “There was a loophole in
Conference by-laws that needed to be
straightened out.” Although the resolu-

tion will affect Davidson most directly, it
binds all the members. In the past, Far-
rell said, there was no rule requiring a

school to participate in the basketball
tournament or some other championship.

The Conference also passed a resolu-
tion restricting television revenue-shar-
ing only to schools competing for cham-
pionships. Although Davidson received
no money this past season, it received
$86,000 the previous season which
bought the school’s Nautilus equipment.
Farrell estimated that over the past four
years, since Davidson first received a
share, it has averaged $30,000 a year in
television revenues.

Ultimately, Farrell said, ‘““We may
decide this is in our best interests any-
way.” The football team, which had been
flying as far north as Boston for games,
will save vast amounts in travel expenses

Organizations Receive Funds

By DAN VOOHRIS

The SGA Senate approved the Ac-
tivities Tax budget proposed by the Acti-
vites Tax Council at Tuesday’s SGA
meeting. Almost $68 ,000 ($65 ,000 from
the student Activities Tax and $2,950
from the ATC reserve fund) will be dis-
tributed among twelve different student
groups for the 1983-84 school year.

Most of the recipients felt the alloca-
tions were fair if not enough. “‘We asses-
sed the needs and then added it up,” said
ATC Chairman Mark Tully. “We didn’t
just cut until we got to $65,000.” Some
felt that the committee slashed too much,
but, said Tully, “Everybody likes to ex-
pend but funds are limited. People just
have to learn work within their limits.”

Quips and Cranks received $23,000
from a request of $24,200, the largest
Activites Tax allocation. “We're
pleased,” said Editor Catherine Finne-
gan. “What we got we can work with.”
The major item cut from their final allot-
ment was $500 for a computer terminal
to increase efficiency. The ATC disag-
reed that the terminal was needed: and
disallowed the request. The yearbook did
receive funds to buy a new camera.

The Davidsonian received $13,300
of a $13,900 request. “That's fair,” said
Executive Editor David Resnik. One of
the biggest expenses has been paying off
the ATC loan for its two-year-old elec-
tronic typesetter. The ATC cancelled
$4,500 of the $9,000 debt and granted
$3,000 for loan repayment in the budget.

Club Sports jumped $1,000 to
$5,500 this year from a request of
$6,500. Sterling Martin said increased
equipment and referee costs dictated the
rise. The ATC agreed but suggested that
the Athletics department begin to help
pay costs.

The BSC remained at $5,300 this
year on a request of $7,400. Business
manager Dwayne D. Wright was pleased
at the decision. “Now we can really get
things done,” he said. The ATC had no
qualms about the budget, but funds were
limited. The Committee recommended
that the BSC work with other organiza-
tions on special events. ;

The SGA requested $5,000 but re-
ceived $4,500. President Hunter Monroe
expressed satisfaction despite a $500 cut
from last year. The ATC blamed “vague

schools, expenses which Farrell said
have been “just ridiculous.” It will also
give football players eligibility for all-
conference honors.

College President Samuel Spencer
said, “Getting out of the Conference at
the present time would present us with

more trouble than staying in. Staying in
would allow us to opt for change if neces-

sary.

Farrell pointed out that although the
major reason for Southern Conference
membership is the automatic bid to the
NCAA basketball tournament, “getting

PCSC Holds Referendum

BY JEFFREY MANN

In this week’s referendum on Patter-
son Court social system proposals, 57
percent of the students supported the Pat-
terson Court Study Committee proposal
allowing oral encouragements while af-
firming a student’s right to self-select.
The turnout for the referendum was 729
students, or 52 percent of the student
body, the largest turnout for an election
since the semester vote last spring.

PSCS Chairman Warren Gould said
the poll results show that the campus is
“leaning more towards selectivity” for
the Court fraternities. Less than a quarter
(24 percent) voted for greater enforce-
ment of current self-selection rules.

A petition started last week by Pete
Skillern, Ester Kim, and Edward Hay
called for the referendum. Skillern said
they wanted a referendum because “we
felt that support for fraternity selectivity
is not as widely accepted as had been as-
sumed when the proposal was drafted.
We wanted to show the Administration
that though a minority, there is strong
support for self-selection. If the SGA had
passed the Patterson Court proposal be-
fore the referendum, this support would
not have been recognized. This referen-
dum is at best another valid needed
means of gaining student input.”

Gould said his committee is continu-
ing to work on the random telephone sur-

Faculty Approves Hours

By DAVID RESNIK

The faculty approved a motion pre-
sented by Physics professor Alan Wolf
Tuesday calling for the implementation
of a credit-hour system under the re-
cently adopted semester system.

Forty-six faculty members voted in
favor of the motion, 26 opposed it, and
one member abstained.

The proposal recommended, “that
graduation requirements under the re-
cently adopted semester calendar be ex-
pressed in terms of credit-hours rather
than in terms of courses.

“That the Educational Policy Com-
mittee, following consultation with all
departments and academic programs of
the College, be instructed to present to
the Faculty a comprehensive program of
distribution and core requirements for
graduation.”

“That each department and academic
program of the College submit to the
Faculty, through its Educational Policy
Committee, a plan for the assignment of
credit hours to each course.”

Wolf said that credit hours will give
the students and faculty more “flexibil-
ity” in terms of scheduling and course
loads.

SGA President Hunter Monroe in a
campaign interview in the March 18
Davidsonian suggested that “the flexible
credit-hour system be given serious con-
sideration.”

The proposed semester system re-
quires that students complete thirty-six
courses for graduation, which means that
they would take four courses one term
and five the next. If credit were based on
hours instead of courses, according to
Wolf, students would be able to lighten
the workload which five courses per
semester requires.

Wolf said another advantage of credit
hours is that it will also allow the College
to offer one and two-hour week courses,
such aS computer science classes for
