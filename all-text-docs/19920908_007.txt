| The Abortion Issue

From the Right
John Allen

An opening apology must go
out to Bill Clinton for our presen-
tation of his views in the

Davidsonian on various campain .
issues as “From the Left” because .

we all know how hard he has
worked to present himself as a
moderate. Fortunately, we Repub-
licans don’t have to worry about
such liberal (or should-I say mod-
erate, Bill?) issues as women in
combat. The purpose of this col-
umn is not to simply list ten rea-
sons not to vote for Clinton, but to
present the Republican stance on
various campaign issues. With the
help of Sara Carlson, who is writ-
ing “From the Left”, we hope to
present several campaign issues
that might help. you decide which
candidate you most agree with.
One issue that received consid-
erable debate in the media at con-
vention time for both parties was

theissue ofabortion. Bush’s stance _

on abortion was of pro-life except
in cases of incest, rape, or threat to
the mother’s life. Clinton’s posi-
tion was one supporting abortion
on demand. But there is another
important area that the candidates
disagree on. Presently Bush op-
poses the extensive research of fe-
tal organs for medical use in at-
tempting to treat certain diseases.
Clinton, on the other hand, wants

increased use of fetal organs in.

medical reseach which could lead
to: Abortion for Profit!!

. Presently abortion clinics re-
ceive $25 per fetal organ from non-
profit research centers. Clinton
supports legislation that would cre-

ate a market for the sale of fetal

organs which could lead to price
wars betweenabortion clinics and
hospitals. In addition, women
might eventually receive money
for their aborted child. Germany is
presently struggling with a black
market for fetal organs that was
created by open legislation similar
to what Clinton supports. Even
strong pro-abortion activists such
as Janice Raymond fear the possi-
bility of such lenient laws that
‘ would lead abortion clinics into
pressuring women into having
abortions. =
Another problem arises in that
older fetuses result in better fetal

tissue for transplants. But later
abortions have been proven to re-
sult in more complications for the
women. It would be unfortunate if
women were persuaded into wait-
ing several more weeks for their
abortion justso thatthe clinic could
get more money for the fetus. Es-
pecially if complications arise be-
cause of the later abortion date.

Another fear is that unsafe abor-.

tion techniques will be used with
the sole purpuse of keeping the
fetus intact since it would be then
worth more money. The safest
present means of abortion destroys
most cells and leaves a fetus thatis
mostly, unusable for transplants.
Finally, for fetal brain cell trans-
plants it is necessary to use older
fetuses that are still alive in-the
womb. The technique of brain cell

removal raises several ethical ques-:

tions because it is necessary to
give the fetus an anesthesia for the
removal of brain cells so that the
fetus doesn’t feel any pain during
the procedure before it is finally
aborted. To make matters worse,
much research has demonstrated
that fetal tissue research does not
result in the cure for any diseases!

An article on Bill Clinton has to
include Hillary since Bill claimed
if you voted for him you would be
getting “two for one”. Hillary has
stated in “Children Under the Law”
that children at the tender age of
twelve have the right to sue their
parents in the court of law. She
states that the matters of abortion
are up to the woman. That's fine
but what if a sixteen year old girl
wants to have an “abortion on de-
mand” which would not require
parental permission. If the parents
tried to interfere the girl could sue
her parents! Thus we wouldn’t be
dealing with not only “women’s
choice” on the issue but possibly
“girl’s choice”.

Whether you are for or against
abortion these questions should
scare you. A recent pole of stu-
dents in Cincinnati and El Paso
indicated that over 3% of:men and
women would consider intentional
impregnation to recieve money for
anabortion. Sorry Billand Hillary,
your version of “family values” is
not what America needs.

From the Left

Sara Carlson

Perhaps the most divisive is-
sue facing America today is abor-
tion. The legality of the procedure,
practiced by millions of women
nationwide, is under constant at-
tack. President Bush hopes legis-

latively to overturn Roe v. Wade,
the landmark 1973 Supreme Court

decision guaranteeing women the -

right to safe and: legal abortion.
Governor Clinton supports abor-
tion rights, as does a majority of
Americans. ;
Since a candidate’s position
on abortion could likely turn an
election, many politicians favorre-
strictions on legal abortions, hedg-
ing their political bets. Governor
Clinton, for instance, signed into
law a bill requiring parental notifi-

_ cation for girls under 18 secking an

abortion, pacifying pro-life attacks
on his “family values.”

Though the morality of abor-
tion is impossible to argue effec-
tively —no one is likely to change
her or his mind — the history of
abortion in the United States is
impossible to ignore. According
to The New Our Bodies Ourselves,
church officials and governmental
partics made noprohibition against
abortion until the nineteenth cen-
tury.
‘While now the so-called medi-

cal “viability” of a fetus is basis for -

limiting abortion, in the early
1800's the “animation” or “quick-
ening” of a fetus determined the
beginning of recognizable human
life (though the Catholic Church
determined this time to be forty or
fifty days later for a female fetus
than a male fetus). Not until 1869,
when Pope Pius IV declared. all
abortion murder, was early (first-
trimester) abortion considered a
crime.

Over the next one hundred
years, denial of abortion was used:
tokeep women from full control of
their lives. Forced to carry a child
to term or risk internal infection,
perforation of the uterus, or the
entrance ofair into the blood stream
(all potentially fatal), a woman had
little choice but to continue an-
otherpregnancy. Doing soplaced
the burden, expense, and emotional

‘exhaustion of parenthood on her-

self and, if she had one, her part-

Deep Thoughts . . . Kirby Shealy -
What Davidson Is. . . Or Isn't?

As I think back to the time
when I only aspired to enter our

_ hallowed bastion of higher learn-
ing, back when I was a naive, ner-:
vous, entirely too spirited high
school senior (as opposed to the
slothful, cynical, codgerly
Davidson senior that I have be-
come), Lremember acertain vision

of whatcollege would be like. This ©

? vision entailed, among ‘the ever

popular (and, in reality, rapidly
diminishing) increased freedom,
late night parties, and beer that the
average 18-year old anticipates, a
notion of intellectual stimulation
amidst other scholars. What I anx-
iously awaited were the kinds of
conversations in which matters of
worldly importance would be dis-
cussed, even if they took place in

settings thatI soexcitedly expected.

‘This part of my vision, in my three

years on this campus, has notcome
to fruition.
Why is it that the verbal inter-
action between people outside of
the classroom rarely gets any
deeper than the “Hey, how ya
doin’?” level? Granted there are
those rare occasions when theright
combination of people is together

ner.

Though some womenand men
fought these laws, most just broke
them. Doctors in the 1890s esti-
mated they performed 2 million
illegal abortions annually, despite
the enormous health risks and so-

«Cial stigma attached to the proce-
dure for the patients. The rate of
abortions obtained has changed
little in the last 100 years. ©

Luckily, the safety of the pro-
cedure has. Up until the late 1960’s,
women relied on painful “mas-
sage,” irritation of the uterus with
foreign objects, and other horrify-
ing techniques to terminate a prcg-
nancy. Now, women can choose
between about a half-dozcn safe
techniques, from aspiration to di-

_lation and curettage to drug-in-
duced miscarriage. -

Abortion means more to
America than medicine, though. It
cuts to the quick of basic disagree-
ments about the roles of govern-
mentand religion in our lives. For
the religious right, legal abortion
stamps a governmental seal-of-
approval on sexual freedom. To
feminists, acccssible abortion is
vital to female independence and
self-determination. To most pcopic
caught in the middle, the legal sta-
tus of abortion symbolizes the
government’s power over the rights
of each individual.

The Republican party’s posi-
tion is out of its own historical
character. Supposedly the cham-
pion of small government and in-
dividual rights, the GOP advocates
invasive, crippling laws govern-
ing women’s bodies. So long as
the religious far-right, led by Pat
Buchanan and Pat Robertson,
strangles Republican party policy,
such violations of basic human lib-
erties will continue.

We are not powerless to fight
these policies. We are Americans,
living in the land of the free. We
can vote for candidates exemplify-
ing the right to self-determination.
We can vote pro-choice. In this
presidential election, we can vote
for Governor Clinton. Because the

‘ denial of safe and Icgal abortion
sets the precedent for denial of all
individual rights.

everyone leaves the meeting brew-

stitution of this caliber. :

Frampton Rules:

The

Big Scam

I was thinking that perhaps
the Dean of Students, Will Terry,
should change his title to Dean of
Alcohol violations. How on Earth
is he going to mcet with 150 differ- —
ent people in one week? Can you-
imagine the boredom that would
arise from asking, “So what were
you doing when you were given
this alcohol violation?”

Anyway.

By the time you read this the
weckend will have already passed.
First of all, I hope first night down
was great and for everyone. I also
hope that you freshmen hada won-
derful time being rushed for the
first time. (Yeah right. More like
the tenth time.) For that matter,
I’m sure you freshwomen had a
wonderful time, as well. After all
those frat guys are rushing you,
too. Although, judgement comes
ina different form in your case.
(Freshmen, keep in mind thatSGA
weckend isn’t that far off. You
might have some luck then.)

Well, back to the subject in
hand. (There is one?) Have you
noticed that this campus is con-
stantly ripping us off. You would
think that the almost seven trillion
dollars we will give them over the
course of our lives would be
enough, but, no. They have to pull
millions of little scams.

Everyonealready knows about
the “Bonus Bucks” deal the food .
service peopleare pulling, but what
about the bed frame scam the RLO
is pulling. They demand that you
return unused bed frames to the
basement, but if you leave it in the
hall, they take for you. Sounds like
a good deal, right? Wrong. They
will charge $150 if you don’t have
the right number of bed frames in
your room, even though they still
have the same total number. Rich-
ard, let’s see everything in your
pockets.

Then there is the scam Judy
Krenzer is pulling down at Baker.
She charges ten bucks for each
team to enter an intramural sport.

I thought we already paid for\all
the classes could take. I guessi
