New Faces Mark Keydet
Lineup For New Season

By BOB REID
Sports Editor
Smarting from a humiliat-
ing 2.8 performance last sea-
son, the Virginia Military In-
stitute Keydets will be out to
avenge last year's record
with a crop of new faces in
the starting lineup.

Only one starter from last
year. defensive halfback Bob
Smalzriedt. will be back in
the top lineup this, year, ac-
cording to Head Coach Vito
Ragazzo. Smaizriédt. a 5-10.
195 pound co-captain from
Cedar Grove, N. J.. will an-
chor the defense, while co-
captain Charlie Bishop will
spark the offense at quarter-
back in hopes of garnering an
early win to fire-up the win-
hungry Keydets.

Last season injuries and
only fair talent plagued the
Keydets and made Coach
Ragazzo's first year at VMI
less than pleasant. VMI down-
ed Villanova and Richmond
for the only wins of the sea-
son, while losing to such
teams as The Citadel. Vir-
ginia Polytechnic Institute
and Boston.

Davidson will be VMI's
first opponent in a sched-
ule which includes meet.
ings with Georgia, Virginia
and VPI. The season will
open at 2 p.m. fomorrow on
the Keydet’s home field in
Lexington, Va.

The Keydets plan to run a
mixed offense, experimenting
with both passing and run-
ning in order to find a ‘Cat

Davidson's cross country
team, which begins its season
on its own course next
month with a match against
Wake Forest, should enjoy a
successful season, coaches
said. Head coach Heath Whit-
tle and his assistant, Sterling
Martin, said they are opti-
mistic about this year's pros-
pects, and are basing their
hopes on returning veterans
and promising freshmen.

Two changes in the South-
ern Conference rules will
affect this year’s cross
country team. The first
change allows freshmen to
perticipate in varsity com-
petition in all sports except
Tootball and basketball.
This will give the versity
the added depth of the
freshman runners in varsity
competition.

The second rule change in-
volving cross country is the
lengthening of the course
from four miles to five miles
in varsity meets and from
two miles to three for frosh
meets. The additional mile
will make even greater train-
ing necessary, Whittle said.

The varsity will be count-
ing heavily on the talents of

see what works best.”
Ragazzo said he hopes his
defense to be strong this year,
with Smaltriezdt and lineman
Don Taylor anchoring the
pack. Taylor. a 5-9, 200
pounder from Roanoke, Va..,
started several games liast
year at middle guard. He was
named conference Lineman
of the Week last year for his
performance in VMI's 14-13
victory over Villanova.

The Keydets expect a
tough challenge in handling
the ‘Cats’ offense, Ragazzo
said, since he feels David-
son wilt be strong on the
ground and In the air.
“(Quarterback Jimmy)

Poole will be running a
good passing game, but Da-
vidson ran the ball pretty
good last year too. We'll
have to work on stopping
fullback Kerry) Keith and
(halfback Billy) Taylor.”

Coach Ragazzo also de-
clined to make any predic-
tions about tomorrow's game
or the season outlook as a
whole. ‘We're not thinking
about the rest of the season
right now,"’ he said. “We're
just getting ready to play
Davidson. We can't afford to
worry about all our oppon-
ents. We just have to take
them one at a time.”

James and John Puckett, two
sophomores coming up from
last year’s successful fresh-
man team. The Puckett
brothers helped that fresh-
man team to achieve a 10-2
record, one of the best cross
country marks at Davidson
in recent years.

“We expect that John will
be the top man on the team
this year."" commented Mar-
tin. “But Jim McLaughlan
will be pushing him hard for
the team lead.”

MeLaughian, returning

from e junior year in
France, is a pleasant addi-
tion to the Wildcat har-
riers. “Jim was in a run-
ning club in France. He
has been running all year
and is in excellent condi-
tlon,”’ Whittle sald.

In addition to the Pucketts
and McLaughlan, the team
will have Randy Phillips re-
turning. Phillips, a junior, is
a strong runner and a team
leader, Whittle said. Stag
Newman also joins the var-
sity from last season's frosh.
Newman is a hard worker
and should add depth to the
squad, the coaches added.

Six runners give the fresh-
man team strong hopes for
success this season. With the

should also give depth to the
varsity attack.

Roger Clarke is among the
outstanding freshman pros-
pects, Whittle said. He is in
good shape and he is a strong
distance runner. He will pro-
bably run in varsity competi-
tion this year, coaches said.
Reaves Louthren looks like
he will also help the varsity,
the coaches said.

Rob Hoy, Will Ravenell
and David Shepler are alt
strong runners who should
ald the freshman team.
Jimmy Trustle is another
freshmen runner who may
be very valuable to the
frosh. He is a real speed-
ster, Martin said, especial-
ly in the quarter mile.
Whittte and Martin hope
that he will be able to ad-
just to the distance and add
strength te the team.

about eight meets this season.

Poole, Glidewell Will Pace
Wildcat Attack In Football

By DANNY WHITE
Assistant Sports Editor

The Davidson Wildcats, under the direction of Homer Smith who is in his
third year at the helm of the ‘Cats, are looking ahead: to a great 1967 season as
a host of talented sophomores and the passing-duc of Jimmy Poole and Pete Glide-
well combine to lead the ’Cats against nine tough opponents this fall.

Poole. who broke four
Southern Conference records
including the total offense
mark when he passed and
ran for 1,925 yards in nine
games on his way to being
named Conference Co-Player
of the Year. returns for his
third year at quarterback.

Glidewell, Poole’s favor-
Ite target last season when
he caught? 58 passes for 629
yards and 6 TD’s, returns
at right end to make the
Davidson offensive machine
even more formidable than
the one which reeled out an
average of 23.2 points per
game last year.

The Wildcats posted a 4-5
record last season but this
year's version of the ‘Cats is
conceded by many observers
to be the stronger team.
However, Coach Smith ad-
mits this year’s schedule is
much tougher than last year
as Davidson must face con-
ference powerhouses such as
East Carolina and West Vir-
ginia, along with an intersec-
tional foe. Connecticut.

‘All the teams we face this
season are much improved
with the exception, of Wof-
ford.” said Smith. “Our
toughest games will be West
Virginia and East Carolina.
which should be the toughest
teams in the conference.”

Leading off the ‘Cat sched
ule will be a conference bat-
tle against VMI at 2 p.m.
tomorrow in Lexington. Va.

The Keydets, under
Coach Vito Ragazzo post-
ed a 2-8 record fast fait,
but Smith calts this year’s
squad “probably the most
improved team in the con-
ference.”

“VMI plays a much tough-
er schedule than we do and
they probably rate us.as their
lightest and most limited op
ponent,”’ Smith said. ‘‘They
feel this is a :must game for
them -a game they must
win,” °

Most observers rate tomor
row’s clash as a toss up with
the outcome possibly decided
by the performance of the
sophomores in the game. Da.
vidson's two platoon, 22-man
squad will feature 10 sophs
while VMI will start five.

VMI and. Davidson are
basically the same type foot-
ball team: one that can move

the ball very well but which
has problems when it comes
to defense, Smtih said.

The season will move in-

to its second week next

Saturday as Davidson will

against the Furman Purple
Paladins.

Coach Bob King's Paladins
pulled out a 28-26 squeaker
over Davidson last year in
Charlotte but finished the
season with a 2-7-1 record.

The ‘67 Paladins have ‘‘The
Fly."' Clyde Hewell, back at
quarterback and Coach King
has been quoted as saying
that Hewell is much better
than Davidson's Poole.
Hewell. who passed for 1,096
yards during the ‘66 cam-
paign. stands 5-11 and weighs
160 pounds.

Davidson returns to Rich-
ardson Field on Sept. 30
for a clash with conference
powerhouse East Carolina,
the first of three straight
home games.

ECC has 25 returning let-
termen from their ‘66 squad.
which compiled a 4-5-1 rec-
ord. The record includes a
40-7 thrashing of Davidson.
which tied the all-time series
record between the two teams
at one victory each.

Following the East Caro-
lina game will be another
conference clash against the
Richmond Spiders.

The Spiders finished 2-¢
last year. But this included
a 23-17 victory over David-
son. Richmond also leads in
the series 14-7.1.

The Wildcats follow Rich
mond with Homecoming on
Oct. 14 when they play host
to a strong Presbyterian Col-
lege team. The Blue Hose
took a 49-13 pasting from the
Wildcats last season but this
year’s game should be much
closer, Smith added.

The Wildcats follow the PC ,
game with a road trip to
Charleston, S. C..’on Oct. 21
to meet The Citadel.

Coach Red Parker of the
Bulldogs has been quoted
as saying the Davidson
game will be one of the
contests he is eager for this
season, after the club’s 21-
17 loss on the Wildcats’
Homecoming last fall.

The Wildcats have an open

this year. observers believe.

Davidson closes out the ‘67
season Nov. 18 against the
West Virginia Mountaineers
at Morganton. W. Va.. which
will be the first football! game
ever between the traditional
basketball rivals.

The Mountaineers have.
22 lettermen returning from

ed a 3.5-1 record against
tough competition.

Leading the Mountaineers
will be halfback Garrett Ford
who has-been tabbed a pos-
sible All-American at his tail-
back position.

The Wildcats will begin the
season with 10 sophomores
starting. on the 22-man first
unit. Leading the list of tal-
ented sophs is Mike Kelly
who will start at both flanker-
