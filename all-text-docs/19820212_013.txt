_Pilgrim’s Progress

I.

it was in the mad, mad Grocery Store
that I was first confident of my salvation.
SAVE!.SAVE! SAVE! and COUPONS
REDEEMED HERE!, this was the good —
news.dnd just exactly what i was

hoping for i had been hoping for

so long.

the gentle squeak of the cart caressed
my ears and my whitened fingers
pressed the perfect plastic and steel

and diew great comfort from that

which wes real and tangible to

the senses. suddenly i realized

what fie cryogenic plot was as

_ the crippled flourescence flickered

my soul into slow motion numbness. .
and the.cruel-coldness.ofthe icy,
linoleum stole throu ebare ~~
soles of my feet and crept slowly |
through my bones bones bones bones
but through some miracle perhaps

i forced myself inward through

the fabric of space and time past

the black holeness of shopping eyes
and was literaaly frozen in the produce
dept. when opposing mirrors informed
me that my fate was being replayed

at millons of other supermarkets across
the universe however i struggled on

and had remaining savvy tosee |
through the schizophrenic mirrors over the bloody
meat, to see through to the butchers

with white suits and chain saws

and the innocent sacred cows

with large brown stupid eyes

like mine.

II. which gleamed with

the flashing lights and-excitement _
thrill of victory/agony of defeat good
clean fun healthy competition brutal
murder and utter objectivity of —~

the video game i paused and .

reached for another easy quarter
uncaring as the sacramental

potato chip crumbs clung greasily
to. my calm fingers and it came

to me that i was in my car and

_ was safely:/home home home at last
the quarter slipped easily back into my
pocket as I slipped easily through the door
- and switched on. |

Ill. the hole in.my wall through which .
each and every evening perpetually poured
unending raw sewage and enlightenment
as the prophet- newsmen with green faces
and pleasant voices laid it on the line
confidentially just between you and me
but tonight was different nd tonight was special
and tonight i had the faith to wait
and the strength to hope in the midst
of the hell i had emptied and
the tears rolled down my face
like amber waves of grain.

‘and I went to the purple majestic mountaintop
i know because the emptiness flashed full upon
me and burned like lasers |
into the back of my smoking skull forever
and forever and the perfect bell rang in my |
mind perfectly loud and long and i 7
watched and i.
