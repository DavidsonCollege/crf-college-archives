letic faculty representatives are

What ere the plans of the
IMAC?

President Wilson listed the
following:

(1) Revise intramural regula-
tions and activities calendar;

(2) Promote an IFC sports
participation trophy for the fra-
ternity with the largest varsity

a sports representation;
| (3) Investigate all intramural

rules for improvements before
next fall; and,

(4) Secure better intramural
communication with Indepen-
dents by posting schedules and
announcements in convenient
spots.

What do you feel is the
most important. contribution
the IMAC has made to the in-
tramural system?

“The revision and strengthen-
ing of the referee system. Be-
fore a sport is initiated we hold
a referee's school which pro-
vides for a more efficient sys-
tem. We have made refereeing
more attractive “by offering
them either a free PT cut or
seventy-five cents per game.”

“We have initiated the penal-
ty system to better insure ref-
eree attendance at the- games.
Each fraternity through this
system loses points when one or
both of their referees are late
or do not show up.”

What is the main obstacle
facing the Council at the pres-
ent time?

“The main obstacle is fitting
the calendar to suit. the mavxi-
mum number of students, in-
cluding varsity athletes.”

Because I’m sure that no one
here in Davidson has ever heard
of it before, “El Tamborito” and
its origin will be the topie of
this column.

The “Tamborito” orginates
with the primitive dances of
the slaves who were brought
to Panama by the early “con-
quistadores.” Gradually it has
taken on new character un-
til it is now a strange medley
of modern coquetry overlaid
on a background of primitive
sinuous movements and. ex-
pressive of this most cosmo-
politan country.

Centuries ago when the slaves
were first brought to Panama
to work on the great “hacien-
das,”. the masters sometimes
gave them permission to hold
gatherings in the yards ond in
the mines. At these gatherings,
the slaves amused themselves
by dancing, and into these
dances they wove their home-
sickness for their native Africa,

‘their despair at their lost liber-

ty. and their remembrances of
their lost mode of life. Thus
they solaced their unhappiness
with the weird music of their
drums, their incomprehensible
songs, and their primitive dance
routines. ‘

The simple originators of the
“Tamborito” had a primitive

‘sense of humor which took the

it was long time afterwards

known as “criollos” that these

new lyrics were invented. '

the measure.
FURTHER STUDY

Anderson pointed out. how-
ever, that further study and
consideration of the proposed

“for some time”
cisive action is taken to replace
the present system of bidding.

The LF.C. also considered this
week the possibility of includ-
ing as part of future Homecom-
ing weckedgds in the fall a
Homecoming Queen to be pre-
sented during half-time cere-
monies of the football game.

There were happpy songs and
sad songs, songs of love and of
hate and also songs which were
made merely witty take-offs. It
was during this period that the
“Poliera” (the costume now in
use took the place of the rags
of the slaves. With the intro-
duction of this beautiful full-
skirted costume, of which we
will talk about later, the “tam-
borito” acquired. the grace it
still has today.

One proposal is to allow each
fraternity to clect a candidate,
with the LF.C. selecting the
Queen. No decision has been
made on this plan, however.

The 20th century has already
added the music of the flute,
the cornet, accordion or organ,
and bass violin to the drums.
And so the “Tamborito” grows
— a dance of life and beauty;
it expands to embrace new cus-
toms, to add to the subject of
its lyrics and to change its
music. But still it retains for-
ever the wild beat. of the drums
