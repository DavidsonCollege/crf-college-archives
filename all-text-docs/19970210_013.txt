A great day to
be a Wildcat

By MIcHAEL KrusE
Sports Editor

Every day is a great day to bea
Wildcat. At least that’s what they
say.

A nice thought - laced with
bulls--t, however.. Even Wildcats
have bad days.

Saturday, though, was definitely
not one of them, as the men’s and
women’s hoopsters each won in a
Belk Arena double dip.

Two Davidson basketball
games in arow? For me, a little slice
of heaven.

But as the basketball bonanza
unfolded, my already lofty expecta-
tions were easily exceeded.

The women’s undercard with
App. St. quickly became the main
event.

John Filar’s bunch - hard-luck
losers of five straight with a bad
habit of playing lifelessly in the first
half and then making a frenzied catch-
up run in the second, only to ulti-
mately succumb moments - jumped
out to leads of 11-4 and 17-9.

Perhaps Filar gave his halftime
speech before the game.

Butthe Mountaineers, who went
14-0 in Southern play last year and,
in my book, are still the cream of the
league crop, embarked ona 12-Orun.

The ladies in red and black with-
stood the Appalachian spurt and
bounced back to earn a 40-33 half-
time lead.

They continued to dictate the
game in the second half and held a
comfy 74-65 lead with but 4:47 to
go.

But the Mountaineers inched
back and Meredith Thompson’s
three-point prayer from the left wing
was answered with 20 ticks left, giv-
ing the evil daughters of Boone an
unthinkable 79-76 advantage.

By this time, much of the men’s
crowd of 3,378 had filed in, creating
a frantic horde of Belk onlookers.

With the Wildcats and their sud-
den mass of faithful staring at a sick-
ening sixth successive downer, Kerry
Brown saved the day, banking in a
three from the right side to force
overtime.

There, KB continued her role as
wonderwoman, giving Davidson the
lead for good with a jumper at the
1:35 juncture.

With the win that was rightfully
theirs all game long, the women
primed crowd for the upcoming
men’s action.

And people say women’s bas-
ketball is boring.

Thad two questions as the night-
cap began: (1) Why aren’tthere more
doubleheaders like this at Belk, and
(2) Who was wearing No. 5 for the
Wildcats and what had he done with
Mark Donnelly?

But Donnelly, mired in an 0-
for-17 slump from three-point range
going into Saturday’s contest, broke
out of his uncharacteristic funk by
nailing 5-of-9 bombs on his way toa
game-high 24 points, as the Wildcats
coasted to an anticlimactic (how
couldit have been anything but?) 79-
68 victory.

“This is just a great day to be at
Belk Arena,” said men’s coach Bob
-| McKillop. “With the women play-
ing the way they did and the crowd
responding to them the way they did,
and the way the crowd responded to
us, it’s just a great day to be a Wild-
cat.”

Remember though, Coach, ev-
ery day is a great day to be a Wildcat.

Men move into second-place tie

DAVIDSON, Feb. 8 - Mark
Donnelly broke out of a severe
shooting slump on Saturday, scor-
ing 24 points in leading Davidson
to a 79-68 victory over Furman in
the second half of the Athletic Hall
of Fame Day doubleheader.

Donnelly, who made 9-of-16
field goals, including 5-of-9 from
three-point land, had missed 19
straight three-pointers.

As coach Bob McKillop said,
“Mark is back.”

“I knew [had my legs early on.
Even the first couple of misses felt
good,” said the junior guard. “I
know I’m a good enough shooter
that they’re eventually going to fall.
I just have to believe in myself.”

Despite facing early deficits of
7-Oand 18-11,aDonnelly free throw

with 6:26 remaining in the first half

gave the Wildcats the lead for good
at 25-24,

Donnelly’s first trey gave
Davidson a 36-26 lead with 1:30
before halftime, as the Wildcats
went to the lockerroom with a 36-
29 advantage.

Davidson (13-9, 6-4 SC)
mainained control in the second half.
The Wildcats never mounted a
knife-in-the-back spurt to com-
pletely put Furman away, but the
victory was still convincing.

A pair of Matt Schrecengost
free throws did pull the Paladins (8-
13, 3-7) to within six (67-61) at the
4:54 mark, but the Wildcats re-
sponded with an 11-2 run over the
next four minutes.

“When Donnelly’s shooting the
ball like that, there’s not much you
can do,” said Furman coach Joe
Cantafio. “He has the quickest re-
lease I’ve seen in a long time.”

Landry Kosmalski also played
a significant role in the Davidson
win, with his fifth double-double of
the season, scoring 18 points and
hauling down 15 rebounds.

“He’s just an absolute animal,”
said Donnelly. “I’ve said it all year,
he’s the reason we’re a lot better
than people thought we were going
to be.”

“A tremendous effort by

Landry,” said McKillop. “He,
Stephen Marshall, and Chadd
Holmes are really starting to step
forward in the paint.”

Marshall scored eight points
and grabbed seven rebounds on
Saturday, and Chadd Holmes
notched his first career. double-
double Thursday against Siena.

Guard Jason Stewart led the
Paladins with 23 points.

The Davidson win, along with
an 81-74 VMI loss to The Citadel
on Saturday, puts the Wildcats ina
second place tie with the Keydets in
the North Division.

women steal crucial thriller

By Aaron DUNHAM

DAVIDSON, Feb. 8 - The
women’s basketball team knew this
season could be special after a 60-
58 upset victory Jan. 13 at App. St.
Although the team just suffered
through a five-game losing streak,
hopes have been rekindled after
another win over the Moutaineers.

This time, the Wildcats won on
their home floor, an 88-84 overtime
triumph before the largest Belk
women’s crowd this year.

“We're back!” exclaimed
coach John Filar after the game.

runs and then make the last one,”
explained Filar.

And that’s exactly what Kerry
Brown did, banking in a tying three
from the right side with nine sec-
onds left. The Mountaineers worked
for a final shot, but Melissa Davis’s

points to go along with 10 rebounds.

AndJen O’Brien made the most
of her team-high 41 minutes, tally-
ing eight points, seven assists, five

Melissa Davis paced App. St.
with 23 points, one shy of her career
high. Center Tiana Tate, who has
replaced preseason conference

in the starting lineup, pitched in 20
points.

“Tt would have been so easy for
them to put a little doubt in their
mind,” added Filar. “This game
shows just what kind of character
these girls have.”
