VIDSONIAN in the Wednes
day elections.

Gately defeated Bill Olson.

The student body at large

senior class elects the editor

THE DAVIDSONIAN elec-

candidate, Al Jasper, whose
bid for the editorship was
turned down by the Publica-

financial supervision over
student publications and nom-
inates the candidates for
publications posts.

Jasper received 15 write-in

not received the two-thirds
vote necessary to approve a
candidate, not nominated by
the outgoing editor of the
publication.

“The normal reason for the
board's turning down a can-

qualified to get out a news-
paper with any sort of pro-
fessional standards,’' Boyte
said.

Jasper, who had planned
to appeal the Publications
Board's decision to the soon-
to-be-appointed Court of Ap-
peals, said that personal rea-
sons had prevented his mak-

the new bylaws as to avoid
giving them the ‘kiss of

have."

Can't Leave Dartmouth

ed as a possible college presi-
dential candidate threw his
hat into the growing ring of
‘“‘non-candidates’ yesterday.

Dr. Carleton B. Chapman,
Class of ‘36. said. “I am not
in a position to consider mov-
ing to another job.”

The dean of the Dartmouth
Medical School added, “I am
in a job to which I am totally
committed. A college admin-
istrator must discharge his
responsibilities or fail.

“I have done neither in my
present position:in the short
time (two years) I have been
there."

Chapman said that this is a
fundamental principle for any
college administrator. He
termed any administrator
who failed to recognize this as

“irresponsible.”

The soft-spoken. articulate
heart specialist spent three
days on campus. Wednesday
night he spoke to pre-med
majors. and on Thursday he
spu“e in chapel on domestic
problems, specifically civi)
rights and black power. and
the Vietnam war.

Chapman said that he was
“astounded .. . and flattered"
that he was being mentioned
as a presidential candidate.
He added that he had noi
been approached by anyone
about the presidency.

Chapman noted that the
selection of a president is
very difficult due to the
smail number of qualified
candidates.

The former Rhodes Scholar
characterized Davidsoh as
“an ideal place to be presi-

dent.”

Because the president
should be involved with cur-
ricular and academic affairs
as well as with fund-raising
programs for the college.
Chapman called the presi.
dency a “‘tall order.”

the main campus problem is
student apathy.

“If students aren't con.

“is based upon the belief

It goes on to say ‘‘respon-
sible maturity is more likely
to develop when a member of
the college community is
both free and obligated to
wrestle with principles of
conduct and to accept full re.
sponsibility for his own ac-
tians and decisions."

Kaylor said. “This is dif.
ferent from the present philo-
sophy of student conduct. It
stresses responsible conduct
without specific prohibitions

prohibitions are necessary.

Opposition Petition

By PAUL SCHNEIDER
Staff Writer

A petition to abolish the
drinking rule at Davidson
is being circulated by
junior John Pancake.

Copies of the petition
have been given to at least
10 fraternities. Pancake
said he hopes to contact
the remaining fraternities
shortly.

So far five sheets have
been returned with a tota!
of 176 signatures. ‘We're
still working on It and will
try fo get around to afl the
fraternity houses again,’’
Pancake said. Friends
have been helping Pan-
cake to circulate the peti-
tion.

Pancake indicated that
anyone who wished to sign
the petition should stop by
his room.

“t was just sitting,
thinking. A couple of pro-

k Gathers More Names

fessors had told me there
would be a chance of
changing the rule if a good
petition with enough names
was presented,”” Pancake
explained.

The petition states, “We
the undersigned believe
that the faculty = rule
against drinking on cam-
pus ought to be abolished.”’

Pancake said, “It is
purposely short because
there are a number of
good reasons why the rule
should be abolished. |
didn’t want to give a par.
ticular reason and exclude
others.”

“Some people know that
CRAP (Committee on
Rules and Punishments)
is looking into the
whole matter right now.
Since the rules are being
reviewed, this is a good
time to present it,” he
said.

Race Caused —

Riots - Trask

By EDWARD HAY
Staff Weiter

White racism was the basic
cause of last summer’s race
riots. and an understanding
of it is the only solution to
the problem. according to a
staff member of the Presi-
dent's Commission on Civil
Disorder.

George Trask, a special as
sistant on the commission
staff, told Open End listeners
last night that this racism
was the result of situations
in the environment which
have existed since the na-
tion’s founding.

Trask pointed to slavery as
the origin of the present dis.
crimination against the Ne-
gro. Until this discrimination
is ended. he said. the prob.
lems will not be solved.

“The Negro has had a taste
of what il is like to be a
whole man, and until he is
granted the same rights we
have, the right to make. a
choice, he will not be satis
fied."

In a question-and-answer
period, Trask said that one

-important aspect of the com

mission's report is that it is
the first time a major gov

ernment report has taken
such a stand, placing the
blame on white racism.

According to Trask, the re-
port does not point to the.
rioters as the ones to be
blamed for the disturbances,
but to the race situation. The
future of the report. and the
hupes of the commission, he
said, lie with the leaders: of
the nation, and their reac-
tions.

“The key to keeping the
riots to a minimum this sum-
mer is a well-equipped police
and National Guard,.”’ Trask
said. ‘“‘There is no doubt in
the minds of the members
of the commission that there
will bé a repeat of the troub.
les last year this summer. It
is a fact which must be
faced.”

As steps in the ultimate re-
solution of the problem.
Trask pointed to education.
a revamping of. the welfare
program. open housing. and
a commitment on the part of
national leaders.
