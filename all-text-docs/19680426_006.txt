cure medical assistance
failed.
“Dr Woods refused to

come to the dorm at 2 a.m.
and we also discoveréd that
the infirmary has no night
phone,'’ said Cowart.

“The injured person final

Poll: Businessmen Back
Integration, Not Boycott

ta By HUGH MARR
Staff Writer

Thirteen local businessmen
revealed in‘a recent poll that
more were for integration
than against. However. most
Were against the boycott of
Ralph Johnson's barber shop
by Davidson College students.
and all who were pollad were
against the picketing of the
shop.

Only. one was in favor of
the boycott. seven were:
against if, two were unde.
cided. and two did not answer
any questions. All of. those an-
swering were opposed to the
picketing. Five were: for-in
degration, three against. and
three undecided.

Most of those polled asked
ta. remaiti anonymous. One
prominent businessman sum
med up much of the feeling:
“T feel that the situation may
have caused a gulf between
the town’ and the college.”

He explained that the inter.
dependence that exists be-
tween the town and the col-
lege demands good relation-
ships between the two.

When asked about. Ralph
Johnson, he explained that
Johnson “has worked hard
and frugally ever since his
father died wnen he was only
12.""

Robert Gregory, Piedmont
National Bank teller, said.
“Students should be more
aware of the good that's be-
ing done. One local business-
man loaned $20,000 interest-
free to the new housing pro
ject.”’

Another cited cases where

Negro court fines and bail
had been paid by townspeo-
ple. and one case in which
“a man invited an ill colored
man to stay in his home to
recuperate.”

He said that integration had
been coming to Davidson.

though without headline riots.
He felt that Ralph Johnson
would eventually have
changed his policy. ‘‘But
Ralph's, a stubborn man. Now
he just can't.”

One argument’ offered was
that the boycott was mis-

town in becoming aware of
the problems which face it,
to create a *“‘mutual learning
experience’’ among the stu-
dents and faculty involved,
and to provide a basis for
“jntelligent concrete action."

Staff Newman, spokesman
for the group, said that they
hoped for 12 to 18 members
with about a 2:1 ratio of stu
dents to faculty.

The program, would follow
a seminar format. with

about. a 20-minute introduc ~

tory lecture followed by about
an hour of discussion. ;

The group plans to use the
town of Davidson as a source
of information in the seminar.

The seminar is tentatively
set to meet the
through ninth week of the 10-
week terms.

The study comes in the
midst of a student boycott re-
sulting from racial discrimi-
nation.

Williams said that these re-
sults are perhaps misleading.
Since only upperclassmen had
returned the questionnaire,
Williams pointed out that a
senior has had more oppor-
tunity to observe violations
than a freshman.

Williams also noted some
confusion about the honor.
code. Some students mistak-
enly believe that drinking on
campus is an honor violation.
Others, he said, are confusing
violations of the student body
regulations with honor viola-
tions.

Williams said that he was
aware that some students are
committing honor violations,
especially cheating. ‘‘We're
reminded of this almost in-
variably at every exam per-
iod when students under
stress have committed vio-
lations of various kinds,”* he
said.

Cases of stealing are pan
ticular problems, Williams
said, ‘‘in that the unlocked
door policy is very tempting
to outsiders who feel no need
at all to comply with our
honor system."

*We wouldn't need a court
if the honor system were
perfect." Williams said.

He added that the honor
system is not upheld ‘by the

is individual students ‘who
must enforce the honor sys-
tem.

Partly in contrast to the
results of the two question-
naires, three faculty mem-
bers said that they had had
little or no reason to. beliéve
that violations, particularly
cheating. were occurring.

Dr. Bruce Jackson. profes-
sor of mathematics said,
“TI have no reason to expect
any violations at all, based
on my personal observation.”

Maj. Joe Crawley, assist-
ant professor of military
science, said that he had
seen no honor violations dur-
ing the three years he has
been at Davidson.

given to more than one sec-
tion. Crawley said that he
had observed no increase in

erally no higher than those
from a first period class.

Lammers said, that students

to fill in lab manuals prior to

Assuming that cheating is
occurring, Jackson said, “It's

not surprising to me that
faculty members haven't
seen any.’ He pointed

that most faculty members
leave the room once test and

Fraternities’ Wages

However. operation of the
fraternity boarding system at
Davidson is becoming in.
creasingly expensive, accord.

cer.

Although at present most
houses seem to be managing
satisfactorily,” Covington
said, “it is getting harder to
find competent help, especial
ly good cooks, who are in de-
mand. The individual houses
are not in as strong a posi-
tion as say, the Union. which

he added.

Other factors contributing
to fraternity financial prob-
lems stem from college
boarding rules. ‘The loss of
paying members to athletic

den to the fraternity.” said

(Continued from Page 1)

SGA Consiitution will have to
be rewritten to conform to
the judicial section in the
CRAP report.

Carroll stressed that
large and favorabie turnouts
are necessary at these two
votes so that..the trustees
may be favorably impressed
by the climate for change on
the campus.

Carrol! ‘also felt it was im.
portant to emphasize that.
the report is not just a freer
system of reguations for stu.
dents. Instead it is a new
code of responsibility that
places great trust in the stu-
dents to fulfill responsibly
the freedom implied in it.

Discussing the report itself

Carroll pointed to the two
dimensions in the report.
Besides the regulatory, there
is a philosophical dimension
that tries to describe ideal
conduct in financial, aca.
demic, and social endeavors.

It is this second facet that
Carroll feels is most import-
ant because it depends on a
new student attitude toward
responsibility. Carroll said
a student must have respon-
sible conduct as well as “‘in-
volving himself in the actions
of his fellow students.’’

Although the system is not
like an honor system, Carroll
expressed hope that each
student would realize that

“he is bound by his con-.

science’ to display proper
conduct.

a discussion of three gaps
with which he is concerned
as a minister.

One of the better speakers
on the predominant chapel
theme of the church and so-
ciety, Black had a knack
for turning’ phrases around
to produce sharp aphorisms.

“The church does not have
gaps; it has gulfs, chasms.
and bottomless abysses,"’ he
said, and then went into de-
tailed speculation on the
three gaps he described as
the people gap, the gener.
tion gap and the clergy.laity
gap.

“I have an ambition to
drag the church, however re-
luctantly, into the twentieth
century before the twenty-
first hits us," he said.

Black described the people
gap as people not wanting
the church ‘either to change
or to come to grips with
problems."

The generation gap he as-
eribed to youthful indiffer-
ence and separation growing
out of parents staying with
the old church while young
adults move to the suburbs.

Black said the clergy-laity
gap was between a conserv-
ative laity and an avant.
garde clergy trying to pre-
vent full scale retreat into
the nineteenth century.

pledges eat with us."’ Thom.
son said, *‘the Union makes

Students and labor leaders
at Duke have joined in de.
manding a minimum hourly
wage of $1.60 for all unvier-
sity employees and recogni-
tion of the union.

The current minimum wage
for janitors and maintenance
workers at Duke is the re-_
quired ‘$1.15. Cafteria em-
employees there receive a
base pay of $1.25 an hour.
ten cents above the minimum
set by the government.

‘Most Davidson fraternities
now employ one house moth-
er, two cooks, and from 7 to
14 student waiters. House
mothers generally receive
around $200 a month, plus
room and board. The cooks,
working seven days and ap-
proximately 47 hours per
week, are paid from $45 to
$60 weekly.

Student waiters, chosen on
the basis of need and compe.
tence, earn from $12 to $30
monthly for working an esti-
mated 15 to 30 hours. In ad.
dition, some fraternities hire
two to four student house
buys 't@ wash dishes. They
pre paid $40 to $80 per
month.

Most fraternity officers
also receive remuneration
ranging from $12 to $45 a
month. depending on the job.

All fraternity employees
are paid a weékly or month-
ly salary rather than hourly
wages. As private clubs, fra.
ternities do not come under
the federal wage-hour law,
but they do have to pay So-
cial Security.

By contrast, all 19 Union
cafeteria workers are paid
at least $1.25 an hour, cooks
teceiving more. The 38 stu-
dent work-study employees
are paid $1.40 per hour. The
Union cafeteria, however, is
not a non-profit organization.
