YOU can take the fong, circuitous
route and come to P.A. by de-
grees, as you eventually will, or
you can cut corners and start right
with The National Joy Smoke.

Open a tidy red tin of Prince
Albert, drink in that rich, rare
aroma, and you will decide on the

quick route.

Your first taste of P.A. in a
pipe will clinch the decision. What
a smoke, honestly! Cool as a con-

as getting back on unlimited cuts.

Proofs for Annual |
Pictures Given for
Student’s Selection

The task of taking the photographs for
the Davidson annual, Quips and Cranks,
has, in a large measure been completed
and most of the proofs have been decided
upon and are now in the hands of the
White Studios, to which this work has
been entrusted.

Almost four hundred photographs of
the members of the student body have
been made and of these only a few yet
remain to be ‘selected and returned to
Miss Rausberg, who has been sent by
the White Studios to manage this divi-
sion of the work. ee,

According to Bob Platt, photographic
editor, and those who have seen the
group pictures, they are an improvement
over those of last year in many respects.
Those of the R. O. T. C. batallion with
perhaps, the exception of the post for
calisthenics, which seems to have been
taken at too great an angle are much
more distinct and give an excellent idea
of the company formations.

The photographer will return some
time during the next semester to take
the pictures of the track, baseball and
other teams, which, of course, could not
be made at this*time and also some
group pictures of various student organ--
zations. The individual pictures of the
football men as well as that of the glee
|club, taken as a group have been re-
ceived and can be obtained from Bob
Platt.

THREE-FOLD

(Continued from page one)
are: anger, prejudice, and self-interest.

The poison of anger“deadens our reasoning
powers and weakens the value of our con-
clusions. Therefore we must wait till our
anger cools before we can rightly consider a
question. Prejudice blinds us, because a pre-
determined mind cannot judge fairly. In or-
der to overcome prejudices, it is our duty to
rise above them.

Self-interest perhaps more than anything
else sidetracks honest thinking, and the only
way to overcome this is to make a real effort
to be unselfish. ‘

Rising in importance above the duty of
being honest to ourselves and others is the
great necessity of being honest with our
God. There are some of us who are scrupu-

who because we have not dedicated our
talents to His use, are not honest with God.
We have no right ‘to use selfishly endow-
ments that God, the giver of all things, has
bestowed upon us, and in simple honesty we
cannot fail to dedicate our lives to Him in
whatever work we do.

Before Dr. Walker’s speech, Dr. William
Hollister, a Davidson alumnus, who has been
in medical work in Washington, made a short
talk on the importance of deciding on one’s
life work on the basis of “Would God have
me do it?” Dr. Hollister himself has given
over his life to medical missionary work in
Korea, for which country he will soon sail.

BLUE DEVILS MEET CATS

tice for the past few days, but hopes to be
ready for the game with Duke. McColgan,
guard, has a dangerously weak knee that
forces him to go easy with his training.
After a rest of ten days the squad should be
in better condition than at any time for the
past few games.

No news has been broadcast from the Blue
Devils’ camp since their encounter with the
Tar Heels, but it is believed that they will
be in good shape for the Thanksgiving game.

The Duke team that lost to the Wildcats
last season by a 20-0 margin has been boosted
by many new faces, Bennett and Jones being
the only regulars from last year’s team who
have a berth on the present organization.

Jankoski, line plunger supreme, is consid-
ered one of the best gridders in’the state, and
the Buie-Adams passing combination has at-
tracted much attention of the followers of
the game. Hunter has been playing a consist-
ent game at center druing the present season.

After the game last week-end the odds
have returned to a more even balance after
Duke had been picked an easy winner over
the Wildcats. The Davidson team will be
fighting one of their greatest battles and on
Richardson Field, where they are known to
fight so hard. “This will be one of the hardest
games of the season and football enthusiasts
will see a good game as a season’s finale.
