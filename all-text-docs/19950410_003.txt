DECISION DAVIDSON

Members of Class of ’99 visit campus for weekend

By SARAH TEACHWORTH
Staff writer

It’s springtime, and while we
worry about our upcoming final
exams, 1,051 high schoolers are
breathing a sigh of relief.

That’s the number of students
who have been invited to join next
year’s freshman class. Choosing
from the 3,059 applicants was es-
pecially difficult because, accord-
ing to Admissions Counselor Sally
Stone, “This is the strongest appli-
cant pool Davidson has ever seen.”

Last weekend accepted stu-
dents travelled to Davidson from
all over the country to participate
in Decision Davidson. Davidson
students, faculty, and staff led dis-
cussion groups, tours, and infor-
mational sessions to help the high
schoolers become better aquainted
with the college.

The middle 50% of this year’s
freshman class had SAT scores
from 1180-1330; this year’s ac-
cepted students have a middle range
of 1240-1390. The same middle
percentage of accepted students
this year are in the top two or three
percent of their classes. Last year’s
class was in the top five percent.

The accepted class contin-
ues the trend of approximately
60% coming from public arid 40%
from private schools. The num-
ber of international students has
gone up; 24 foreign countries are
represented. Those accepted are
from 45 states, a smaller range
than usual.

Despite the fact that Admis-
sions accepted over a thousand
promising students, they are hop-
ing that 430 or less will actually
enroll. Last year, more students

‘ enrolled than Admissions antici-

pated. Stone says that the “target
number” was lowered this spring
to “compensate for last year” and
to “ensure that we retain a student
body of about 1,600 students.”
Several factors came into
play when the Admissions staff
struggled to reach adecision about
how many applicants to accept.
Even though they wére surprised
by the number of students who
enrolled last spring, they had to
take into consideration that this
year’s applicant pool is extraor-
dinarily bright and will be receiy-
ing all kinds of tempting offers
from other colleges and universi-
ties. Stone says she is confident

that the hard work students have put
into Scholars Weekend and Deci-
sion Davidson will help make
acceptees’ decisions a bit easier.

If the target number is not
reached, admissions counselors
will go to the waiting list. In the
last two years, they have not had to

do so.

Only then will they consider
how much room they have for the
30 or so transfer applicants.

Amidst uncharacteristic con--
fusion, Davidson students elected
SGA senators and Honor Council
representatives last week. Names
inadvertently omitted from the bal-
lot and close elections resulted ina
redistribution of ballots and nu-
merous runoffs. By Thursday
night, however, all votes were tal-
lied and the new positions filled.

Freshman dancing sensation
Buster Burk waltzed his way back
into SGA as the sophomore presi-
dent. He was joined by new sopho-
more senators Wesley Hart and
Matthew Hobbie.

notes that the person must have
experience in the “more technical
aspects of Residence Life.” The
director must be able to handle
lottery systems and foster good
relations with the Physical Plant.

Meanwhile, Kurt Holmes has
become the acting Director of Resi-
dence Life. He says, “Everyone is
taking on more responsibilities to
cover for Richard Terry’s depar-
ture.” Holmes says that the transi-
tion has been relatively easy.

class. Sabel looks forward to the
coming year and promises to
“continue working for a much-
needed new Student Union.”

The junior class also elected
Rick Onkey and Ashley Tabb as
senior senators.

The upcoming senior class also

the Honor Council next year. These
students will replace the graduat-
ing. Honor Council members.

As a result of the very close
race in the freshman and sopho-
more classes, a runoff was needed
to determine Honor Council repre-
sentatives. The sophomore class
elected Jay Hinton, Jessica Stetler,
and Deaver Traywick as upcoming
junior representatives. The fresh-
man class selected Katie Nelson,

Nathan Raley, and Joy Sparks.

As dictated by the Honor
Code, the council elected Philip
Ewing as new chairperson and
Chris Knox as Secretary.

Expressing excitement about

the coming year, Ewing hopes to
increase student and faculty un-
derstanding of the code and plans
to address “the convoluted nature
of procedure as written in the red
book.”

Ewing and Knox replaced
graduating seniors Arthur Gaston
and Anna Gray Anderson.
