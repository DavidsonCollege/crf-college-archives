THE DAVIDSONIAN

NEWS

MONDAY, OCTOBER 4, 1993

By Mary Clare Jalonick

Current construction may
seem to be a nuisance to some, but
once it is finished all of those who
attend Davidson College Presby-
terian Church should appreciate
the finished product.

According tochurch adminis-
trator Carol Barber, the new addi-
tions are being completed in two
phases.

During the first phase, the
sanctuary is being completely re-
furbished. Workers are repaint-
ing, re-carpeting, installing new
air conditioning, and also erecting
@ new cross.

Thesecond phase of construc-
tion will add space to the church.
A new fellowship hall is being
added which will be adjacentto the
patiocourtyardon the campus side.
There will also be added office

DCPC handles growing congregation with cue 8 additions

space, an enlarged nursery, and a
new Christian education room.

An addition of particular in-
terest to students might be the new
student lounge, a place for
Davidson students to study and
relax. The lounge will have asepa-
rate doorway so that it is easily
accessible to students.

The money for the construc-
tion, which totals up to well over
$1 million dollars, was almost en-
tirely raised by members of the
church. In the spring of 1992, the
church began a capital funds cam-
paign, which consisted of a fund-

raising council that met with mem- —

bers in their homes.

There the members discussed
plans for the church and pledged
whatever they could over a five
year period. Fifteen percent of all
of the funds raised has also been

set aside for benevolent causes,
local and global.

According to the Associate
Minister, Thomas Blair, the new
additions are being built to accom-
modate a growing membership.

With the growth of North
Mecklenburg county and the in-
creased number of retirement
homes in the area, the church ex-
pects to have at least 75 new.mem-

- bers this year.

Reverend Blair is very excited
about the growth trend that the
church is taking. “There is a new
spirit afoot at DCPC,” he says, and
he encourages students to get in-
volved.

Anyone wanting to get more
involved with DCPC should call
the church office for a schedule.
Service is every Sunday at 11:00,
preceded by Sunday school.

The church is going through some changes. This new addition to
the building will make room for new offices, a classroom and
other additions. The money for the renovations was raised within
the community and totalled over $1 million. In addition, the
community provided DCPC leaders with specie into the needs

of its congregation.

Students and faculty discuss the Honor Code at round table dinner
Faculty members express worry that the code is becoming ineffective and needs modification

By Martha Knight

On Wednesday, students and
faculty metin around table discus-
sion to talk about the Honor Code
and its effectiveness.

Dean of Students Will Terry
and Honor Council Chairman Ward
Davis addressed the group before
an informal exchange of ideas.

Faculty and students stated
their opinions about how the sys-
tem has worked in the past, its
present strengths and weaknesses,
and suggestions forimprovements.

The basic principles of the
Honor Code require that students
refrain from lying, cheating, or
stealing. Entering students must
sign a pledge agreeing to follow
the rules and to report violations,
handled by the Honor Council.

The college handbook states
that respect for this system is “an
integral part of the educational:
experience, helping students to
developan honorable, responsible
lifestyle.”

Several faculty members at
the meeting expressed concern that
the Honor Code is no longer as
effective as it has been in past
years. Some shared recent prob-

lems that have occurred involving
specific violations inthe classroom.

Sara Beasley, English profes-
sor and 1986 graduate, says that
she sees a change in the system
since her time at Davidson.

She served as a member of the
Honor Council for four years and
felt, at the time, that students took
asincere interest in the Honor Code.

Beasley admits, “as an alum, I
was sad to hear that the faculty
perceives the code as not as effec-

tive.”

She feels that many upper-
classmen tend to take the system
for granted and adds thatshe speaks
to her students about the impor-
tance of their involvement.

The students responded with
a mixed reaction. Some felt that a
certain few disregard the principles
of the Honor Code and threaten to
destroy it for those who do their
part.
Others said that they believe

students are aware of the impor-
tance of their pledge and will con-
tinue to uphold its purpose.

The two groups then set some
general goals. Through events like
the mock honor trials, they would
like to find ways to increase stu-
dent awareness of the system and,
in particular, the functioning of the
Honor Council.

Many believed that such steps
would make the students feel more
strongly about the positive influ-

ence of the code.

Senior Sally Stone felt that
this meeting was productive. She
Stresses that faculty and students
must work together in order to
realize the best interests of the col-
lege and to make Davidson an en-
vironment in which everyone can
live and work.

She says that “in order to en-
sure that the Honor Code remains
in full operation, everyone must do
his part.”

Few freshmen attend court tours of fraternities and BSC

By Jay Jennings

On Monday and Tuesday of
last week, the freshmen men had
the traditional court tours to the six
on-campus fraternities. For the
first time, the Black Student Coali-
tion was included.

The number of freshmen tour-
ing was Significantly lower than in
years past. Amia Canada, Presi-
dent of the BSC, wanted to thank
4th Little, 1st Rich, and 4th Can-
non for coming down to the house.
The BSC includes everyone and
does not interfere with member-
ship in eating houses and fraterni-

ties. According to Dean Terry, the
court tours expose the freshmen to
the variety on the court. He does
not want the freshmen to put “all of
their eggs in one basket” and only
look at one house.

For the first time the court
tours were after first night down.
Dean Terry: said he thought the
scheduling probably had an effect
onthe attendance. Hall Counselor
Ben Balsley felt that “curiosity
would have caused more involve-
ment” if the tours had been before
first night down.

Health Center

By Katherine Hash

This fall the Davidson Stu-
dent Health Center will offer three
new services to students: a “Cold
Center,” flu vaccinations, and a
medical information hot line.

The “Cold Center” is a self-
care unit which will save both stu-
dents and nurses time by allowing
students to evaluate their own
symptoms before deciding tosee a
nurse or physician.

The unit is located in the infir-
mary adjacent to thesun room. Itis
equipped with a thermometer, a
flashlight, a mirror, and several
“fact sheets.”

After following the instruc-
tions at the center, students will
_ either be advised to see the recep-
tionist to make an appointment with
a physician or directed to a list of
over-the-counter medications.

One-dose packages of many
of these medications can be ob-
tained from the Health Centerstaff.
The “Cold Center” is open from
8:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. and 5:30 p.m.

makes changes to fight colds

- 9:00 p.m..

The Health Center will offer
flu vaccinations for the first time
this fall. This decision came in
response to student requests and to
the Center for Disease Control’s
recent recommendation that dor-
mitory residents be vaccinated.

According to nurse Jan Poole,
the vaccine is recommended for
anyone who “wishes to decrease
the possibility of disruption of his

daily routine by influenza.” Those *

vaccinated will get only a mild
case of the flu or none at all.

Because the influenza virus
‘changes from year to year, vacci-
nations are effective for only one
year. The optimal time for injec-
tion is between mid-October and
mid-November prior to the peak
flu season.

The vaccination, which may
be accompanied by side effects
lasting up to one week, will be
begin providing protection two
weeks after injection.

The Health Center will be of-

fering the vaccination Monday
through Friday, October 18 to
November 12 between 1:30 p.m.
and 3:30 p.m. fora cost of $7. The
staff requests that those interested
in receiving the vaccination call
ext. 2300 between 8:00 a.m. and
9:00 p.m. before October 15.

The Health Center also wants
to make students aware of a 24-
hour medical and health informa-
tion hot-line service provided by
Iredale Memorial Hospital.

Tel-Med is a free, private way
for students to receive answers to
questions they may have a variety
ofsubjectsincluding alcohol abuse,
nutrition, and birth control.

Calling the toll free number
(1-800-622-4633) from a touch
tone phone will connect students
with a computerized library of 3-5

minute tape recorded messages. __

A pamphlet containing three
digit code numbers for the over
twohundred messages can be found
in the infirmary and on residence
halls.

Murchison thought that if it had
been earlier in the year more fresh-
men would have attended. Many
freshmen mentioned that they had
commitments that would have been
avoided if it had been earlier in the
year.

Terry points out that some
freshmen have already secured
bonds with upperclassmen and do
not have an open mind. He added
that it is inevitable for the fresh-
men to form these bonds, but it is
important for them to look at all of
the possibilities.

The people who went on the

tours, like freshman Scott Young,
felt that the event was a “good
opportunity to meet people from
houses that they have not met.”

Another freshman, Jason
Schmidt, said that he got to “see
who is in which of the houses.”

Many people hope that the
timing will be changed for next
years’ tours.

Ryan Harper, the President of
PiKA, thought thatthe tours should
either be made a requirement like
PE 101 or'be restructured. One
suggestion is to model the tours
after the women’s eating houses.
