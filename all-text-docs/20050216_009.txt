Transfers to state schools on the rise

Davidson College
has remained in the
US News and World
Report’s top 10 lib-
eral arts colleges
partly due to its
extremely high
freshman retention

Recently,
though, that reten-
tion rate has
dropped __ precipi-
tously.

According to the
Dean of Students
office, the freshman
retention rate for the
class of 2007 was 72
percent, a full 24
percentage points
below the average of
the preceding 10
years. Reasons given for the steep drop
vary, with some claiming that the
Admissions Office chose unqualified
students unable to handle the Davidson
workload, others asserting that the large

Union prostitution ring busted

Campus safety arrested five people
and took down a large scale prostitution
ring on Saturday night at the Alvarez
College Union. Four females and a male
were arrested when one of the alleged
prostitutes, Jenna Billero, 21, proposi-
tioned an
undercover
Davidson police
officer. After her
arrest, being
honor bound to
report who else
was participat-
ing in the ring,
Billero informed
on her partners,
as well as her
manager.

fied by several
students of a possible prostitution oper-
ation outside the Union Café.

Said Billy Rubin ’05, “One time at an
After Midnight breakfast, one of the
ladies tried to serve me the waffles from
her mouth, which was weird. But, I got
really suspicious when this guy in a pink
coat started screaming at me, ‘that

[expletive deleted] ain’t free!’ And, as we
all know, After Midnight waffles are
free.”

Other students also reported being
propositioned by the alleged prostitutes.
Remarked James Baskerville ’06,
“Whenever students
who didn’t hook up
at court parties came
to the Union for their
late night quesadil-
las, the women
would always be ask-
ing if they wanted to
‘party.’ From what
I’ve heard, they
made most of their
money at After
Midnight events. I
wouldn’t be  sur-
prised if they worked
out some sort of
kickback with WALT
DJ’s.”

He continued,
“And I never liked
eating alone in the Union late at night,
because their manager would always be
staring at me menacingly while tapping
his hand with his striped cane.”

In addition to Billero, Sparkles Love,
19, Lady McGee, 22, and Blanche
Dubois, 23, were charged with soliciting
sex. Saul Rosenstein, 47, was charged
with resisting arrest, parking in a 20
minute parking spot for longer than the
allowed time, and for participation in a
prostitution ring.

“We broke up a major prostitution
ring tonight,” Chief of Campus Police
Mark Jacks said. “They’ve been operat-
ing for years right under our nose. On
top of the prostitution charges, we have
also recovered an elaborate machine
that they had used to manufacture fake
Cat Cards.”

Rubin is happy that the prostitution
ring is no longer operating on campus.
“I’m just glad I caught it when I did.
Who knows what kind of nonsense
could have gone on if those ladies had
made it down to Patterson Court? I’m
taking Criminology right now, so I was
pretty sure what I was dealing with.”

The four women and Rosenstein were
charged. with their first violation of the
Davidson College Prostitution Policy
and will be charged $25. A second viola-
tion carries a $50 fine and a letter home
to their parents.

Former Davidson student Marcus Trembline ’07, pictured here with
Tom Macintosh ’07, claims that transferring was an excellent choice.

size of that year’s freshman class led to
overcrowding and a sub-par student
experience, and more contending that
the decision to let Jews on the Board of
Trustees had an extremely deleterious
effect on student satisfaction.

Meanwhile, some administrators
claimed that safeguards that had pre-
vented student loss in the past failed last
year. Said Dean of Students Claude
Wilton, “As most people know, the main
reason why we practice grade deflation
at Davidson is so that students find it
harder to transfer. Because no good
school is going to want someone with a
low GPA, we can trap students at
Davidson. Unfortunately, with the high
number of visiting professors last year,
we were unable to keep GPA’s low
enough to prevent transferring.”

He continued, “We did not fail entire-
ly though, as most Davidson transfers
still had low enough GPA’s to confine
them to mediocre large public state
schools.”

Statistics provided by the Registrar
do confirm that most students did trans-

fer to public insti-
tutions. Out of the
103 students in the
class of 2007 who
transferred from
Davidson, 92
transferred to a
public university.

Most former
Davidson students
interviewed
seemed very
happy with their
decisions. Said
Marcus Trembline
’07 at Florida State
University, “I’ve
had so much more
fun in the past
semester at
Florida State than
I think I would
have had in all
four years at
Davidson. I go out every night, because I
only have one class, and I even get
drunk at lunch. The fraternities here are
so much cooler than those at Davidson.
One has a fraternity house that’s literal-
ly bigger than Chambers. Forget a
goose; one frat here sacrificed a goat for
one of their parties.”

Trembline continued, “The girls here
are so much hotter than the ones at
Davidson. I’ve hooked up with 26 girls
since I’ve been here, and I didn’t even
hook up once at Davidson. Plus, our
football team would crush Davidson’s.
Go ’Noles!”

Some students also feel that they will
benefit from the higher grades that they
get at schools that may be less academi-
cally demanding than Davidson. Claire
Dembrove ’07 transferred to the
University of Colorado. “I have been
very happy with my choice to leave
Davidson. I feel that the University of
Colorado gives me a much better chance
to be successfulfjjn my first semester, I
received a 4.0 GPA. The classes are so
much cooler here, like my class on tele-

vision. We learned how to program the
remote, do all sorts of neat stuff with the
color options, and even how to use the
sleep function. I never took any useful
classes like that at Davidson.”

“The main
reason why we
practice grade

deflation at
Davidson is so
that students find
it harder to
transfer.”

Many former Davidson students do
miss certain aspects of Davidson, such
as the small classes and the approacha-
bility of the professors. Reported Mike
Chaswell ’07 at Ohio State University,
“It’s really different here; my economics
class has 3,000 students in it. And even
though the professor who teaches the
course is famous, I’ve never actually
seen him teaching class because all he
does is type up the lecture and have the
computer read it out.”

Still, almost everyone interviewed
agreed that they were happier at their
new schools. Said Clemson transfer
Percy Wilkerton ’07, “Transferring to
Clemson might have been the best deci-
sion I have ever made. You would have
to be a moron to spend four years and
$150,000 working your ass off for a
degree from a school that nobody has
ever heard of when for 100,000 bucks
less, I can spend seven years partying
and getting straight A’s.”

Warner Hall cracks down on uninvited guests

Once again, Warner Hall’s annual
“Crush Party” was marred by uninvited
guests. In what has become an annual
phenomenon, a large number of male
students who were not invited to the
party by Warner Hall members took
advantage of the lax security and
entered the part:’.

For the Crush Party, each member of
Warner Hall is allotted three “crushes”
to invite. Invitations for the party are
then left at students’ doors. The party is
closed for only invitees and Warner Hall
members from 10 p.m. to 12 a.m., and it
then becomes an open party from 12
a.m. to 2 a.m.

Said Warner Hall member Annie
Oiler ’06, “The Crush Party is one of the
hallmarks of Warner Hall. One of the

benefits of the Crush Party is that there ©

are no really ugly or weird guys there, so
you don’t have to worry about dancing
and having some sketchy ugly guy come
up behind you and start grinding. It’s
not like everyone looks like a model, but
at least they’re presentable. I mean,
most girls invite their friends, but it’s
kind of an unwritten rule that you don’t
invite your ugly friends.”

Still, many Warner Hall members
reported seeing unattractive male stu-
dents at this year’s party. Remarked
Warner Hall Secretary Catherine Ruzak
‘07, “Did anyone see that kid with the
big nose and all the acne? Nobody possi-
bly could have invited that guy. And how
about that fat guy wearing the WWF t-

shirt? I don’t even think that he goes to
Davidson.”

Member Eleanor Smith-Klein ’07
agreed, “I saw so many guys there who
definitely weren’t invited. One guy was
standing so awkwardly in the corner
wearing a Cat Pack t-shirt. It’s for damn
sure that nobody in Warner has a crush
on him.”

“Did anyone see
that kid with the
big nose and all
the acne? Nobody

possibly could
have invited that

Invited male students also resented
those students who sneaked in without
being invited. Said Tom Parks ’07, who
was invited by Warner sophomore
Claire Ester, “I find it hard to relax when
I look around and see all these losers
there. I mean, come on, if you know
you're ugly, you should not be at the
Crush Party. Who do they think they’re

fooling?”

Greg Mass ’06 also believed that the
uninvited guests took much of the fun
away from those who were actually
invited to the party. “I work out three
times a week to look good, so it’s annoy-
ing when all these guys who have never
even seen Baker come to a party for hot
people.”

Some believe that there is not enough
security to prevent uninvited students
from crashing the party. Under
Warner’s Crush Party protocol, guests
are not required to show their invita-
tions to gain admittance to the festivi-
ties.

President Ali Tilliera '05 wants to
increase the security for the Crush
Party. “Granted, in the past, uninvited
guests have been a problem, but never
to this level. I saw at least 15 guys who
were downright ugly, weird, and proba-
bly live in singles in Tomlinson. If those
guys were invited, then I really need to
have a serious talk with my members,
because no Warner girls that I want in
my house would even have friends like
those.”

She continued, “Next year we will cer-
tainly be checking invitations. We are
also looking into how to make the invi-
tations more difficult to counterfeit,
possibly using to some sort of infrared
system or bar codes. I am also doing
research to see if coming to the Crush
Party unirtvited is a violation of the
Honor Code.”
