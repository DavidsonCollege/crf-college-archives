As ham craves eggs, as lovers desire the

so does The Davidsonian want a nicely-

quickly and efficiently.

This new-fangled system of grading has
hit a good many students right between the

the tone of that next report by parking up
the studies a bit.

FREE RIDES
Since there are many people-in the sur-

that the Davidson boys do not seem to ap-
preciate a ride in the least and have not the
least consideration in taking care of the
car while they are riding, or help them if a
puncture or any other misfortune happens
while they are riding.

Remember, while you are riding that the
car is another’s property and you are his
guest and treat it and him as such.

GOOD ENGLISH

In the Staté Technician there appears an
editorial concerning the laxity of correct-
ness in spoken English around the environs
of that college. Tf the language they use
there is in a more deplorable condition than
that purveved from mouth to mouth in this
neighborhood, we would disdain to hear it.

The editorial referred to, told of a hash-
house council in, which every member who
slashed the king’s English was called down
in no uncertain terms. The correcting was
done in good spirit of course, but the re-
sults arising therefrom, were productive of
much good. At) least an interest was
aroused and that is half the battle at times.

AUTUMN DUSK
Wraith-like mist from smouldering leaves
Arises acrid into air,
To fan a saffron flame that burns
Like incense for a virgin's prayer.

Far voices gade into the dusk
And distant fires awaken, gay;
The croon of vrowsy insects hush
When childish forms come out to play.

Fluttering leaves drift softly down
As withered petals of the rose,

And down the street, a mother’s voice
Calls, “Billee-ce,” as shadows close.

OUR FOSTER-MOTHERS

It is refreshing to remind ourselves as students
in the midst of chronic muck-raking of the powers
that be, that there are at least two persons con-
nected with the administration against whom
our most careless student dare not
imperial scorn. Thing of it—two persons before
whom even the ego even the younger generation
of Davdison bows in respect and esteem—an in-
compliment.

It is only meet that these two should be symbols
of motherhood—an ideal to which the boys of
the collegiate forever profess their alle-
xiance. ‘The mother-warden of the infirmary and
the mother-matron the dormitories hold a

Why this singular reverence and esteem? Per-
haps silvery gray hair, kind tender eyes, gentle
words and sincere hearts are emblematic of One

nal affection which lingers in the most masculine
heart. More probably, all these clements

CHEERS AND JEERS
There has been something sadly lacking in the
spirit of the
student body during the

organized cheering of the Davidson
last few games in which
the Davidson team has engaged. In all the old
hack-neved yells, which everyone who has ever
attended a Davidson game has heard a thousand
times, there a little of the Davidson
spirit which the cheer-leaders
have attempted to introduce, have apparently
failed dismally. The old “Hacka-racka booma-
lacka” vell is good enough in its place, but when
it is used over and over again in the same game it
looses much of its spirit.

make plenty of noise if they had only had the
proper spirit.

Whether the cheer-leaders have become a little
less spirited on account of the students, or whether
the students have taken their attitude from the
cheer-leaders, it is not certain. But it is certain
that the Davidson students are not cheering as
they after game, the cheers
seem to be same monotonous repetitions. There is
the usual “fifteen” for the opponents, then “long
Davidson, Monk and Tex,” then “split hi, Cap'n
Black.” This is the regular program, then there
is a little variation as the substitutions are made.
When this same menu is presented every game,
the students and everyone in hearing distance
wishes a little variety.

We realize that new cheers are rare and not
casily composed, but certainly out of a student
body of six hundred men a few new cheers could
he mvadeup. or old cheers adopted to Davidson. It
is hoped that the student body will take a more
active interest in the organized cheering, and show
that not only the Wildcat team has that ol’ David-
son spirit, that has such a reputation, but also the
student body has as much or even more of that
spirit than the team,

used to do. Game

PARLOR FOOTBALL

The football game was over

And at the parlor grate

A maiden and a long haired youth
Were lingering rather late.

They talked of punts and drop-kicks,

But found it rather tame,

"THT Cupid put his nose guard on

And butted in the game.

Quoth he, it’s rather funny

If I don’t arrange a march.

So he then lined up the couple

And made them toe the scratch,

The youth was growing nervous
Neath the weight of new found bliss,
And he rather thought the scrimmage
Should end up with a kiss.

He charged upon the center,

He tackled left and right,

And the way he held that chair for
downs

Was simply out of sight.

He next tried osculation,

Just an amateur affair,

But lost it on a fumble

And, instead, it struck the air.

Then, as he landed on her ear

We heard the maiden say,

You're penalized for holding,
Jim, likewise for off-side play.
With teeth set he tried another,
This time succeeded fine,

For he scored an easy touchdown
On tlre crimson two-yard line.

And as they sat there byth e grate
Comimuning soul to soul,
The Parlor door swung open
And her father kicked the goal.
