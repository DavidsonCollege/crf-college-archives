Temporary Lethargy

By PETE CELENTANO
Staff Writer

This is that time of the year
when the sports fan seems to
be in limbo. The NCAA basket-
ball championships are over
(is NC State really the best?)
and the pro playoffs will not
begin for two weeks.

Trivia games can be played
only so much. There is little
excitement in watching
exhibition baseball or pre-
playoff pro basketball or
hockey.

What can a sports fan do?
He can sit down and write a
sports column, take up knit-
ting, find a willing female, etc.
but this does not seem to fill
the vacuum left by the end of

winter, sports most active.

time.

Why do you think ‘‘Sports
Illustrated’’ runs its “‘swim-
suit” issue around this time of
year? Do you believe it is
because sun-bathing is an ac-
tiv® sport (a great spectator
sport, though)? No, there is
just nothing else, and it’s a
great way to fill up pages.

Why am I writing this, you
may ask? Well, I couldn't
think of anything else, and it is
a great way to fill up space.

A much-neglected sport at
Davidson, and one that deser-
ves more widespread par-
ticipation, is APBA (known as
‘“‘apba"’) baseball.

Nobody knows what APBA
stands for. Like God and
taxes, it is taken on faith.

Sports
M” have their baseball board
games, a true devotee
recognizes that APBA is king.

The game is played by two
(or more) persons. Each takes
a packet with 20 numbered
cards, each packet marked
with a team name, each card
marked with the name of a
member of the team.

Seeer

boards’’, numbered and prin-
ted with information on a
specific play. There is also a
board with a replica of a
baseball diamond.

The game is played by
rolling dice and looking up the
number on a player’s card
which yields another number.
This final number is found on
the situation boards and the
result of the roll is known.

The game is better played
than explained. All the great
teams can be obtained (192
Yankees, 1955 Dodgers, etc.)
as well as all-star Hall of
Fame teams. Each year a new
series of the previous season’s
teams is issued.

The game is played on cam-
pus, but its players have hid-
den themselves. Arise ye AP-
BA stalwarts. Yours is a hell
of a game.

On a more serious note,
there is a rumor about that a
P.E. course in ‘The
Philosophy of Sport’’ will be
presented in the near future,
for those who have no desire to
complete their physical
education requirements.

This is not only hypocritical,
it is a cruel joke played on
Davidson students.

Theoretically, the course of-
fers a classroom alternative to
physical education
requirements of a more
strenuous nature. However,
its purpose is self-defeating.
The philosophy of physical
education is to build a student
with an acquaintance with
physical exercise. How does
this jive with classroom
study?

already overburdened
student. ;
