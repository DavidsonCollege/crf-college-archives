The Davidsonian

By CHARLIE SHEPHERD
Staff Writer

The Democrats this fall face
an uphill battle to unseat the in-
cumbent Republican  ad-
ministration while trying to get
members of their party elected
in state and federal races.

However several students on
campus are actively cam-
paigning for their favorite can-
didate.

McGOVERN

Will Robertson and Erwin
Barron are the leaders of the
McGovern campaign on cam-
pus. When asked why they are
supporting McGovern, they
replied that it is a matter of the
war and priorities. Explaining
that they have a feeling that
people who discredit the ad-
ministration are being closed
out, Robertson and Barron poin-
ted out that the President has
not concentrated enough on
domestic issues such as poverty
and racial discrimination.

Robertson felt that the most
important work in politics goes
on at the precenct level and
commended the student body
for being generally well in-
formed. There are about 50
volunteers actively supporting
McGovern at Davidson.

The campaigners have done
some fund raising and. last
week. had their first campus
canvas. The purpose of this can-
canvas was to find out where
the undecided votes are. so that
these people can be contacted
and given literature

somewhat dismayed by the
results of the first straw poll.
but believe that McGovern will
gain significantly in the next
one.

BOWLES

For those not familiar with
North Carolina political figures,
Skipper Bowles is a former
state senator who is running for
governor this year. His
literature pictures him as very

As Students Join In Campaign

popular with young people since
he has sponsored the En-
vironmental Bill of Rights and
has worked for a more viable
public education program.

According to Bo Phillips,
leader of the Bowles campaign
on campus, there are only about
312 students from North
Carolina at Davidson. This
makes the state and local cam-
paigns on campus more dif-
ficult.

Bowles’s senate record and
his concern for the environment
and public education are the
primary reasons why Phillips
became involved in the cam-
paign.

Echoing Robertson's opinion
that students at Davidson are
well informed. Phillips said he
does not feel the need to plaster
the campus with pamphlets and
stickers.

Rather. he is distributing a
few pamphlets and putting up
posters on campus. Also, he is
working a good bit for the North
Mecklenburg Bowles cam-
paign

When asked if Bowles is ac-
tively supporting McGovern,
Phillips replied that the can-
didate agrees with McGovern
on Many issues but has had to
stay away from him because of
the presidential nominee's un-
popularity in North Carolina

GALIFIANAKIS

Bill McKinnon. the campus
leader of the Nick Galifianakis
for United States Senate cam-
paign. cited a reaction to
apathy as his reason for
becoming involved in politics.
McKinnon said that his_ in-
volvement was a proof to him-
self that he was not apathetic.
Although the announcement
sheets have carried pleas for
help in the Galifianakis cam-
paign. he reported that only two
students have offered to help.

The college campaign. ac-
cording to McKinnon, has not
really started yet. It will consist
mostly of distribution of pam-
phlets and bumper stickers to

North Carolina’ students.
Posters will also be placed in
prominent areas.

Young Republicans Working
For Big Victory In November

By RICHARD ROMEYN
Contributing Editor

A total of approximately 60
students are actively involved
in working for Republican can-
didates.

President Nixon, guber-
natorial candidate Jim
Holshouser, and candidate for
Congress Jim Martin are
represented on campus by
seperate groups

Behind the Republican cam-
paigns on campus is the Young
Republican organization, whose
president George Kaneklides
sees his group's role as that of a
**man power reserve pool.”

Club members work for the
various organizations ac-
cording to their interest and the
need for their help

**Kaneklides encourages
everyone to work for
Republican candidates regar-
dless of their political af-

. McKinnon is planning on can-
vassing the Davidson-Cornelius
and Charlotte areas.

McKinnon stated that
Galifianakis, a member of the
United States House of
Representatives for six years.
will not actively support
Senator McGovern because he
feels that he ( Galifianakis)can
do a better job working for him-
self.

BEATTY

Larry Horowitz is working on
the campaign to elect Jim Beat-
ty to Congress. Horowitz. a
resident of California, started
his political work as a political
science assignment.

He cited agreement with
Beatty and his disagreement
with the Republican ‘candidate
as the reason for supporting his
candidate.

Horowitz faces a tougher task
campaigning than the other
leaders, for only a few students
actually live in this district and
can vote.

filiation

“We are anxious.” he said.
“to show that there are a great
many Democrats and in-
dependents who | support
Republican candidates.”

As a chartered organization
the Young Republicans can ap-
ply for SGA funds, however,
Kaneklides stated that they
would not do so

“IT would not want the senate
to be in the position of having to
support a candidate,’ he said.

At the present time all ac-
tivities undertaken by the
Young Republicans are funded
by its membership

Of the groups supporting in-
dividual candidates President
Nixon has by far the largest
block of supporters (25).

Chairman of the Davidson
College Young Voters for Presi-
dent, Robert Touchton sees his
candidate's local campaign as
“being in excellent shape’’and
points to the straw vote taken
two weeks ago in which Nixon
defeated McGovern 320 to 245
as evidence of Nixon's support
on campus.

He claims that the results did
not surprise him. “'I think that
the President's support is even
greater than was indicated by
the poll,’ said Touchton, adding
that ‘“‘apathy or fear of ridicule
may have kept many from ex-
pressing their support.”’

Touchton called the results of
the faculty poll disappointing,"
and said he feels that peer
pressure may have been a fac-
tor.

“Our approach to the cam-
paign is two fold.’ said
Touchton. “We first want to
present the record of Richard
Nixon so that students can
decide whether they prefer
that to the promises of George
McGovern.”

He said the second objective
is “to show the community and
those on the campus that there

are people at Davidson who .

support the President."
Another strategy of Nixon
Supporters is an advertising
campaign, which was initiated
with two ads in THE DAVID-
SONIAN last week. Several

more are planned for the future.

Copy for the ads and their
expense is supplied by the

membership in Davidson Col-
lege Young Voters for the Pres
ident.

The Davidson Youth tor
Holshouser are off to a slower
start with their campaign than
any of the other Republican
groups.

Chairman Vince Rabil ad-
mits that while they have taken
little concrete action yet. an on
campus program is planned for
the near future.

Though plans are still in their
formative stages Rabil hopes to
bring Holshouser (who like
Martin is a Davidson alumnus
to the campus _— around
homecoming.

Funds from Nixon headquar-
ters are available for activities
supporting Holshouser if Rabil
decides to apply for them. He
has suggested an advertising
campaign as a possible course
of action for the future.

Rabil admits that Holshouser
may face ‘‘an uphill battle.”
and emphasized that student in-
volvement in the campaign
could have an effect upon its
outcome.

Davidson students working
for the Martin campaign
operate primarily from the can-
didate’s Charlotte office. Most
recently many took part in the
‘‘Bumper Blitz’’, in which
workers canvass the major
shopping centers to hand out
bumper stickers.

Others work at secretarial
positions in which helpers put in
between 6-9 hours a week.

Chairman of Davidson Youth
for Martin Cal Morton feels
that there is little his group can
accomplish by campaigning on
the Davidson campus, although
Martin will speak here later this
month.

Most students are out-of-
Staters and only a handful of
students came from Martin's
9th district. *‘Most just aren't
interested,’ said Morton:

‘ however he encourages studen-

ts to support and work for the
Martin candidacy even if they
can't vote for him.

“Students interested in the
Republican ticket should work
for a Martin victory to increase
the Republican representation
in Congress,"’ he said.
