Scoring drought, scheduile keep soccer team winless

By PERRY MATHEWES

The Davidson soccer team has
already gotten off to a early, but
disappointing, start. A 1-0 loss to
Wake Forest yesterday dropped
their record to 0-3-1. Previous
losses came at Evansville, the sec-
ond ranked team in the nation, 4-0
and Cincinnati 2-1. The lone tie,
1-1, came at Xavier.

Yesterday’s home opener
started out slowly as the teams
found their legs. The first serious
threat to either goal did not come
until the sixth minute when Wake
tested the Davidson defense with a
penetrating shot.

Nejther team seemed to domi-
nate the game as most of the action
stayed im midfield. Davidson
played well with a patient passing
game, but was | susceptible to
quick counterattacks from Wake.

At the 20 minute, sophomore
midfielder Tracy Hankins tested
the Wake goalie with a header
from close range.

Unfortunately, . Wake Forest
opened the scoring just five mi-
nutes later. A high cross on a
Wake corner kick eluded junior
goalkeeper Josh Budde but found
a Wake attacker at the far post. He
drilled the ball through several
Davidson defenders to find the
back of the net.

The second half opened une-
ventfully, with Davidson showing
a patient offense and a solid de-
-fense. However Wake Forest
seemed to gain momentum with
several penetrating runs.

In the last half hour of play the
Davidson ‘attack began to apply
pressure. Several corner kicks
presented some excellent. oppur-
tunities, but they failed to
equalize.

Davidson played well, yet
lacked the finishing skills to pro-
duce goals. A good défense com-
bined with aggressive play pro-
vided an enjoyable game for the
spectators and a tough one for

Wake Forest, who is ranked -

number eighth in the south.

Davidson ‘has a good aggres-
sive team, but the tough schedule
may give deceiving results. Play-
ing in Division I, the team faces
15 teams who are ranked in their
respective regions.

“Breaks will make a differ-
ence,” according to coach Charlie
Slagle. “This is a good team that
could end up with a .500 record.”

In spite of the poor start, he is
confident that the team will do
well.

Depth and injuries will be key
factors to the teams success during
the seasons. Only 18 players ar-

Woo.»

rived at the preseason camp and
there are only 22 players on the
squad riow. Any injuries during
the course of the season Could
weaken the team considerably.

’. Experience is also a factor in
the team’s performance. With the
loss of two time All-Conference
senior goalie Jim Kelly for the
season due to a leg injury, the
team not only loses an excellent
goalie, but also a valuable team
leader. As a result, Slagle is look-
ing for leadership from several

‘other players, especially seniors

Chris Jones, Brian Shockley and
Steve Stith.

Also look for strong perfor-
mances this from freshman Rob
Vest, sophomore Tracy Hankins
and juniors Steve Ott and Michael
Spear.

Slagle is pleased with the
team’s progress and looks for bet-
ter results as the team begins to
gel. He is also very appreciative of
the fan support that the team has

‘received., “Davidson fans are the

best fans to have.”

Davidson next plays in the
Davidson-UCB Tournament to-
morrow and Sunday. Game time
tomorrow 4:45 p.m. The squad
then travels to Duke on the
Wednesday, Sept. 17.
