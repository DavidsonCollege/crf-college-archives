all guaranteed to be at least ten years old.
“The Campus Wit,”.in perusing over some
old copies of “The Davidson College Maga-
zine” ran over these jokes printed in issues
in which two of our English professors were
contending to see which could write the more
poetry. They are all, therefore, musty—not
in language, but in age.)

Light Economy

Ed: “Do you know that turning down
the gas saves matches?”

Co-Ed: “No, I thought that turning down
the gas frequently made matches.”

Moral: Turning off an electric light often
causes sparking. Turning off a gas light
causes an increase in pressure. Increase of

pressure causes a lessening of the waste.

Much Face Lifting

When something unusual makes its ap-
pearance in this world, even the most
youthful will ask its purpose. There are
some things, however, that we see every
day but yet do not stop to think about
their purpose. This is*true in the case of
noses. Every time we look in the mirror
we see that same, old monotonous nose.
We see noses all over the world; noses,
noses and more noses. Yet we never in-
quire into their purpose.

Noses, known in the case of man as

first made to pry into other people’s bus-

jiness and have been used for that purpose ;

ever since, notwithstanding the fact that
|many secondary uses for the nose have
been discovered. For instance somebody
| ead out that the nose could sometimes
be used to detect odors (both pleasant and
olidous). Some people find the nose very
| convenient for keeping the left eye from
| seeing what the right eye is looking at
| while others can’t find anything for it to
ldo but to add to their sophisticated look
| by supporting eye glasses.

| Then there are those people who-don't
| like to disarrange their hair and they find
|

it very convenient to scratch their noses
instead of their head. In the case of the
| pugilist the nose is exclusively reserved
|for something to punch at. (We get pug
