Angry voters reject incumbents

States reject
Democratic platform
and send a message to
the president.

By Brett Marston

On November 3rd, several in-
cumbent Democratic governors
and mayors lost their bids for re-
election to their rivals in the Re-
publican party.

Republicans were quick to
claim this as a sign that Americans
are dissatisfied with Clinton’s poli-
cies. Most analysts assert, how-
ever, thaf the results from the re-
cent elections reflect more a dis-
trust for incumbents in general than
a rejection of either party.

In one of the most spectacular
races, New York City voters chose
Republican Rudolph Giuliani over
the Democrat David Dinkins, who
is now the first incumbent mayor
to lose a bid for re-election in the
Big Apple since 1933.

In New Jersey, amid charges
of shady vote-buying deals, Chris-
tine Todd Whitman, a Republican,
defeated incumbent Democratic
governor Jim Florio, whose $2.8
billion tax increase angered many
voters.

With massive support from
the religious right, Republican
George Allen trounced the Demo-
crat Mary Sue Terry, who was not
an incumbent, but whom Allen

portrayed as the heir of the previ-
ous Democratic governors.

In New York and New Jersey,
where Clinton strongly supported
the Democratic incumbents, the
margin of victory for the Republi-
can candidates was as thin as a
hair. Whitman won by a mere 1
percent of the votes, Giuliani by
less than 2 percent.

Seen in the context of other
issues which are gaining in popu-
larity, however, such as term lim-

sults show an increasing impa-
tience among American voters, and
an unwillingness to give incum-
bents “the benefit of the doubt—or
second terms,” writes Elizabeth
Kolbert in the New York Times.

“Some analysts say that in-
cumbents will have a hard time as
long for as long as there are hard
time,” she continues. “With gov-
ernment resources scarce, candi-
dates are bound to make promises
that, once in office, they cannot
keep.”

1988 (“read my lips... .”), has prom-
ised to cut New Jersey state taxes
by 30 percent over the next three
years. Fiscal difficulties, includ-
ing an enormous deficit, will prob-
ably prevent such a move.

In a climate in which all re-
sponsible political action is likely
to be unpopular, populist politi-
cians gain influence by blaming
the “established parties” for being
incapable of solving pressing prob-
lems. Indeed, politicians like
Whitman give more support to
these parties and increase voters’
cynicism by making such ridicu-
lous campaign promises.

“The real danger [for the
Democrats]” writes Steve Daley
in the Chicago Tribune, “. . .is that
the depths of voter anger and im-
patience with incumbent politi-
cians has yet to be plumbed, and
that the 1994 midterm elections
are bearing down on them with the
ferocity of Ross Perot at an anti-
NAFTA rally.”

The recent election results
have many Democratic members
of Congress worried about their
prospects for re-election next year.
The discontent which helped give
Perot 19 percent of the votes in the
presidential election in 1992 and

which helped Clinton into the
White House may defeat the Demo-
crats themselves.

Congress set to vote on controversial NAFTA

House vote will be
decided by lobyists,
Clinton included

By Christopher Hood

“The Number One sign you
know you’re dealing with Ameri-
can politics: Vice President de-
bates major policy with old, rich,
pissed off guy on nightly talk
show.” No, it wasn’t another
Letterman Top10 list.

. Vice President Al Gore de-
bated (argued?) the North Ameri-
can Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA) with Ross Perot, prob-
ably the most widely recognized
agreement opponent, Tuesday
evening on “Larry King Live.” The
event symbolized what many con-
sider to be wrong with the current
state of American politics: their
media driven nature, special inter-
est mania, and the lofty status at-
tributed to someone who has never
been elected to political office, just
to name three.

Congress to vote this week

The Gore Perot accuse-a-
thon’s true effects won’t be felt
until Wednesday, when the House
is scheduled to vote on NAFTA.
Should it pass, the Senate is likely
toaccept the agreement by Friday.
As of this past weekend, the Ad-
ministration needed to persuade
roughly 40 representatives to
switch from their undecided or op-
posing viewpoints in order to have
the 218 votes necessary for a ma-
jority. Many of these target repre-
sentatives returned home this

weekend, as Congress recessed for
the Veterans’ Day weekend. Their
votes were likely decided by opin-
ions and concerns raised by their
constituents and interest groups.
More than NAFTA at stake
Though the Administration is
raising the stakes on NAFTA, it
recognizes the wide reaching im-
pact of the debate. The agreement
is not about Al Gore versus Ross
Perot, or even the United States
against Mexico. For an Adminis-
tration struggling to prove its for-
eign policy competence in an envi-
ronment in which domestic and
foreign policies are becoming more
closely linked, NAFTA represents
the beginning of what should be
top priorities: the opening of trade
markets and the spread of democ-
racy and market economies.

seven year long trade negotiation
marathon which seeks to lower
trade barriers among the over 100
participants.
Momentum essential

Despite strong organized pro-
tests by labor and environmental
groups, the Administration con-
tends that NAFTA is a job pro-
ducer which will open markets
through the reduction of tariffs.
Mexican tariffs average two and a
half times their U.S. counterparts.
Should the Congress fail to pass
NAFTA, Japan may lead a Far
East rush into Mexico, cutting

sharply into the U.S. trade surplus
with Mexico. This surplus has
grown sharply since Mexico be-
gan to liberalize trade practices in
the middle 1980s. Leverage at the
Pacific. Rim Summit is important,
but more crucial is momentum for
the Uruguay Round of GATT talks.

The biggest obstacle to
completion is a quarrel between
the United States and the Euro-
pean Community over farm subsi-
dies. With GATT passage, the
United States will gain access to
many more markets than with
NAFTA; as is the case with
Mexico, American tariffs tend to
be lower than those of other na-
tions.

From a global perspective,
numerous Asian, eastern European,
Latin American and African third
world countries attempting demo-
craticand market economy reforms
desperately need open markets and
less government intervention for
these reforms to succeed. The Clin-
ton Administration surely took a
great risk by pitting Gore against
Perot, whose popularity has
dropped as his role in the anti-
NAFTAcrtusade has grown. Given
the ramifications of the upcoming
Congressional NAFTA votes on
wider ranging global concerns for
an administration desperately in
need of a foreign policy momen-
tum boost, the Administration
deemed the risk a necessary one.

Nigeria: Goodbye, Ibrahim

Tensions high and
government unlawful

By Zik Joseph

One cannot speak of notori-
ous leaders in Africa without men-
tioning the name Ibrahim
Babangida. Well known by many
Nigerians as “IBB,” many have
come to refer to him as the
“Maradona of Africa.” It is a pity
that the re-awakening and realiza-
tion by many Nigerians that he was
a bad leader, has come at such a
time when it is too late to “save the
goal.” Because of this, the West
African Nation has had to pay such
a dear price for trusting a leader
like him.

' Despite the fact that Nigeria
was one Of the first African coun-
tries to acquire autonomy from
Colonial Masters in October 1960,
Nigeria has undergone a series of
political anarchy, leaving much of
the political scene in the hands of
the military. It is amidst this shady
background that Babangida ceased
presidency via the military coup of
August 27, 1985.:

Like many opportunists, he

captured widespread support all

over the country by promising the
people that he would not only re-
habilitate the economy, but he also
would eventually hand over power
to the civilians in the year 1990.
Hardly at the time did anyone know
that this was the beginning of.a
reign filled with all sorts of politi-
cal dirty games with IBB as the key
player. His eight years in office
were marked by high levels of cor-
ruption in the government. The
economy dwindled as state funds
were mainly channeled to ambi-
tious defence programs. He did
not hesitate to call off negotiations

with the International Monetary
Fund (IMF), which furthersmeared
his image abroad. Political activ-
ity was banned, several people were
detained without trial. All these
actions did not go without any re-
bellion. Two military coups to
oust him out of power were futile
and proved that diplomacy was the
only way out, In July 1987, the
ruling body at the time, the Armed
Forces Ruling Council (AFRC)
postponed the presidential elec-
tions to 1992, contrary to what had
earlier on been envisaged.

Babangida using “delaying
tactics,” further pushed ahead the
date for elections and it was not
until the 12th of June this year,
under immense pressure that Ni-
gerians were allowed to go to the
polls, an election which was de-
clared by IBB as null and void due
to fraud. Fearing condemnation
from the west, as was the case with
Jonas Savimbi of Angola, IBB quit
the state house on the 27th of Au-
gust leaving behind Chief Ernest
Shonekan, as the leader of the 32
member interim government that
is expected to rule Nigeria until
31st March 1994 when fresh elec-
tions are to take place.

Last Wednesday, a Nigerian
Court declared the new interim
government illegitimate, leaving
the political future of the country
in jeopardy. This is because Chief
Shonekan is seen by many as-a
‘puppet’ of Babangida after all the
other members of the interim gov-
ernment are “IBB’s men.” One
Justice Minister, Akpamgbo in a
bidto Silence Chief M.K.O Abiola,
winner of last June’s elections, in-
dicated that any mention of the
past canceled elections would lead
to the latter being kept out of the
coming elections.
