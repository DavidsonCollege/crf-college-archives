"Decriminalization of Drugs’

By JAY J. CHAUDHURI AND BRADLEY GRIFFIN

Mayor Kurt L. Schmoke of
Baltimore, Maryland, the guest
speaker at Spring Awards Convo-
cation, spoke on the “decriminali-
zation of drugs” on Friday, April
20.
The speech focused primarily
on two subjects: reforming public
education and the changing the
national drug strategy. Both areas
were directly related because, ac-
cording to Schmoke, better educa-
tion leads to a decrease in drug
abuse.

“My hope is that we will put
the wallet where the willis in public
education,” said Schmoke. “It is a
matter of national importance that
we improve public education.”
Publiceducation strategies would
include remedial literacy for both
young and old; increase in teacher
salaries; increase in the role of the

federal government;and reorgani-

zation of the educational system.
However, there are many fac-

tors that stand in way , the major

Schmoke. The mayor stated that
“he doesn’t want drugs legalized”
but rather wants “the medical
profession to use currently illegal
drugs for medicalization.”
Schmoke’s strategy would put the
“Surgeon General instead of the
Attorney General incharge because
law-enforcement has not and will
not solve the drug problem.”

The current drug problem is
not only. working but is making
things worse. Therefore, Schmoke
advocates public health strategies

‘which would not prosecute today’s

criminals because jails are already

Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity
Informational Meeting Held

Quality of Life Task Force Recommends Fraternity

A group of about 80 students,
faculty, and staff gathered in the
900 Room Wednesday, April 11 for
an informational meeting and an
open forum on Kappa Alpha Psi
(KAP). Several Davidson students
have worked in conjunction with
members of KAP at the University
of North Carolina at Charlotte in
anattemptto bring a chapter of the
fraternity to Davidson. KAP is an
historically black fraternity.

AlanHunter, Sterling Freeman,
Charles Brooks and Jay Ferguson
spoke on the advantages of bring-
ing a chapter of anhistorically black
: ity to Davidson. All of the

. speakers denied thatan historically

black fraternity would exacerbate

segregation.
Hunter said that KAP would

By GARY WHEELER
provide “a feeling of -being at
home” for many black students
“that is not presently provided for
at Davidson College.” Hunter,
however, hopes that neither black
nor white students will consider
an historically black fraternity as
separatist.

Freeman added that KAP is
not only needed by black men on
campus, but by those.“who don’t
know.-much about it, and those
whoare totally against it.” Hesees
KAP as means of adding a “new

_ twist” to the Davidson experience

and as an effective tool for attract-
ing more blacks to Davidson. Free-
man believes that KAP would not
only help join men of a “common
history, a common culture, and a
common bond” not only at

Davidson, but would provide a
network with other fraternity
members outside of the college
community.

Ferguson directly addressed
the question of whether an histori-
cally black fraternity would segre-

‘gate the campus. “I’ve seen what

Davidson is capable of in terms of
opening its mind to new concepts,
and Iam steadfastly confident that
itcandoevenmore. Thisis why, in
my opinion, a historically black
fraternity shouldn't segregate the
campus.”

Ferguson went further by
pointing out reasons why an his-
torically black fraternity will not
separate the campus. “First, the
