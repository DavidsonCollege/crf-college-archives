Next, beginning with the

academic year 1966-67 an upper:
classman could eat with any

provisos. Any student could re:

He felt that “the faculty com-
mittee would be opposed to any
such radical change. Pledging
in 1965 must not de ruled out
unless provisions for freshmen
socia) life are enacted.”

“7 lke it,” responded Jones,
“but people first will have to
spend a lot of time to consider
such a provocative document:
Four months ago I myself would
have deen startled to think of
such proff sals."

He recognizes the ‘‘need for
more deliberation,” but expects
the faculty to approve sopho-
more rush and to set a dead-
Yime for removing restrictive
membership clauses. Past
faculty votes already show their
favor for such measures.

Von Unwerth said, ‘I believe
the majority has faced the real
issue. The report provides a
probing analysis of Davidson's
social] situation and attempts
to work towards a better Dav-
idson. It is doubtlessly not per-
fect and will require constant
revision during the transitional

Being “very satisfied with
the report,’ Wray calls it “the
most workable solution for the
entire student body. I would
ike to see a student program
of social life with 100 per cent
participation. The only solution
is to take away the power of
choice from the group and
give it to the individual. I |
tion’t see how the fraternities
could adapt to this.”

He continued, “It is all up
to the faculty and administra-
¢ion now. The plans and finan-
cial problems will still have
to be worked out.”

Young admitted, “My siga-
ing represents what some would
consider a change of opinion:
well, it is! It constitutes a
change of thinking from my

stand in the fall. I now believe |

that 100 per cent bidding and
sophomore rush are stop-gap
measures, inadequate for a
solution.

“A radical change or s:ruc-
tura) reform is required. It has
taken me a long ume to clear
up my thinking on this sub-

ject. but this has been one|

of the great benefits of the
committee. In my own mind
this report would provide the
est system for Davidson. Pro-
ably by the end of Apri! we
will know what action will be
taken for next fall”

Favoring a “moderate solu-
tion,” Dr. Kelton said, “There
és general agreement on the
immediate recommendations,
ut I feel that it is premature

enswer now. In removing the
bad aspects from the frater-
eity, I would hate to throw
eway the good.

“Perhaps in the future we
could definitely decide, but
for now we should leave all
possibilities open. I would guess

that the immediate recom:
mendations would be enacted."”

Being out of town Terry was:
not available for comment.

Ross explained, ‘Some chang+
es are definitely needed. but f
would like to see some more
moderate changes. We reed a
a continuing committee to evai-
uate and help make needed
changes. I feel the majority
recommendations are too rad-
ical to be adopted: however,
the incoming student should
have a competitive alternative

lieve the faculty does favor
some change.”

Council’s thoughts were along
the same line: ‘I can’t agree

Although Jackson did not
sign either report. he ‘“‘sym-
pathizes with the minority. I
don’t completely agree with
the final goal of this eval-
uation. If approved, the Stu-
dent Council should take up
the suggestions to set up the
Social Council."’

Haselden added his own view-
point: “I am issuing a minority
report with my own opinions
due to the fact that I do not
agree entirely with the major-
ity report. I doubt if there will
be any change next year pro-
vided of course that the faculty

The Student Counvil’s primary
responsibilities are to: be aware
ef student concern and tv be an
effective voice of student opin-
ion. The following propesals
do not involve new ideas, but are
directed toward matters. witich

I. Recreational facilities
Davidson:

Last year Dr. Scott propused
to the college self-study cum-
t™ittee that improvement be
made in the school’s recreation-
al facilities. The school appears
to be rather slow in meeting the

student's obvious needs in this:

area.

Still, in terms of immediate
improvement, the Student Coun-
cil has begun this spring to
keep the gym open at night.
thus at least putting the present
facilities to greater use. The
Student Council should establish
this service next fall on a year-
round basis.

II. A system of course: evalua-
tion:

A system of evaluation of the
curriculum by the students
would be beneficial in providing
the professers with a means of
determining their success in the
classroonn

The Student Council could ad-

filled out by the students. These | !

forms would be tabulated, and
the final results would then be
made available to the profes-
sors.

III. A continued evaluation of
social life at Davidson:

The evaluation of the social
life at Davidson will. no doubt,
be the most important issue
facing the student body in the
coming year.

I have had the opportunity
to sit in on the Student Council-
appointed Fraternity Evaluation
Committee, an experience which
has given me some insight into
the situation we face. The mem
bers of the committee have put
many hours into consideration of
the social life on the campus,
and the report will, I feel, con
tain some very valid’ suggestions
for change.

I feel sure that any student
at Davidson who examines the
student social life as conscien-
tiously as the memters of the’
Evaluation Committee have:
done would realize that some
very serious inequities exist
here in terms of social oppor-
tunities. However, I feel just
as sure that, as things now
stand, there is no need for any
sweeping changes in the organi-
zation of student sociaf life.

T am in favor of most of the
preliminary recommendations of
the cornmittee. However, I feel
that the proposed solution in the
report of the majority is too
great a change to be considered
by the Administration.

In the coming year the Stu-
dent Council should provide an
effective voice of student opin-
ion concerning the proposed
changes. Experience on the Stu-
dent-Faculty Coordinating Com-
mittee convinces me that the
Administration is mindful of the
attitudes of students in areas
which concern them.

In regard to proposed changes
in the social organization at
Davidson, the Student Council
will provide the most effective
voice of student opinion for the
Administration. |
