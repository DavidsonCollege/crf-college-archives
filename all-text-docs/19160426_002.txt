A MENACE TO DAVIDSON,

Some time ago at a mecting the stu-
dent body voted to discountenance the
taking of college property. Yet this is
going on with both college and personal
property. “Somebody swiped my book"
and “1 lost my raincoat” have become
almost daily expressions, while the large
number of “Lost” notices on the bulle-
tin boards is of significance. Yet this
thing is tolerated by the students, be-
cause the attitude taken toward such
work is not one of stealing. ‘There are
many who would despise the thought of
stealing, who think nothing of not re-
turning .a borrowed pocket knife. “The
man who can slip in and take a light
from the gymnasium is considered more
of w hero than a thief. And Davidson
is not alone in this.

But the time has come when such
work can no longer be masked with
terms of “thoughtlessness” and “‘forget-
fulness.” Face it honestly, and it is
stealing. But the small minority of the
student body which does the taking is
not entirely to blame, for the majority
is at fault in not branding this as wrong
and treating it as such. It will be a
smirch upon the fair name of Davidson
if such a condition is tolerated any longer
by its students.

A COACH FOR TENNIS,

Granted that foot ball and base ball
are the maior sports at Davidson, yet
the game plaved most consistently, and
by most of the student body, is tennis.
Every other game from foot ball to
horse-shoes has its season and its stars.
but tennis is played from September to
June, not by a few celebrities, but by a
majority of the students. Yet. strange
to say, every other sport, even boxing.
has its coaches, while tennis is uncoach-
ed. The average man starts as a Fresh-
man, and after four vears of practice be-
comes a comparatively good player, but

WEEKLY MEETINGS.

At the regular meeting of Phi Society
Saturday night the query debated was:
“Resolved, That the U. S. Government

should compel every male student in any

institution of college grade to take at
least one year of military training.”

Those on the affirmative were: Korne-
gay, Clark and Carson.
ed that a one-year military training
would give the United States a well-
trained army reserve and the training
would do much to develop the students
physically.

They contend-

For the negative Ratchford,
Neal and Farrior showed that the train-

ing would not be adequate, that it would
divert the student from his studies, and
that it would be a too great exercise of

of the affirmative.

Monday morning a declamation was

given by Hunter, McLeod gave a short

talk on “The Blanket Fee,” McIntyre

spoke on “The Civil Service.’ H. Mor-

rison upon “The Literacy Test for Im-
migrants.” McCormick gave the last
talk of the morning, his subject being

“Bud Fisher.”

Instead ‘of the regular weekly debate
last Saturday night, the Eumenean So-
The society
was- addressed by five or six members,
who pointed out some of the definite de-
fects in the society, and gave suggestions
as to the furthering of its welfare. The
meeting was then thrown open for gen-
eral discussion, following which refresh-
ments were served.

At the regular meeting Monday
morning several very good speeches were
given. Patton gave a very interesting
outline of the work of a congressman.
F. H. Smith, in a few well chosen re-
marks, showed the work of the electoral
college, and what it represented. Hovt
also gave a very good oration. The
articles of agreement hetween the two
societies were read and approved. after
which the officers for the next term
were installed.

A VOTE OF THANKS.

The thanks of the student body are
due J. E. Faw, '15, for his courtesy in
writing up the report of the debate with
Emory which appeared in the last issue
of THe Davivsontan. While here
Faw was one of the men who did most
in the student body for the good of the
college, and he is continuing his efforts
now as he did then,

his tennis has all been learned thru ex-
perience and is not in the least scientfic.
If a good coach could be secured for a
few weeks in the fall to give some point-
ers about the form and style of playing,
position of the arm and hand, placing,
and the like, it would greatly increase
the interest in and pleasure of this popu-
lar sport, and make Davidson leader
