If Coach Bill Dole
were given the chance to
revamp the rules of col-

morrow's fracas with
WGL, chances are the
first thing he'd do
would be to pencil in a
clause unconditionally

split-T teams: the op-
tion play.

urday, it was certainly the proverbial straw that broke the back
ef the Davidson club. About the time that the Gobblers’ Dickie
Beard scampered for the fourth VPI touchdown, it began to
appear that this Wildcat team was the same as those of yester-
year, which just couldn't seem to hold out against a sustained
attack.

But anybody who bothered to look a little deeper into
the situation would have had reason to brighten up and
realtze, even in the gloom of an opening-game defeat, that
things were not nearly as bad as they might have seemed.

Even to the skeptical it was obvious that this Davidson
team had one thing that past teams have lacked: belief in them-
selves. They went on the field last week believing that they
could and would win the ball game. They played the game
hard, capitalized on the breaks, and showed a real scoring punch.
Behind thirteen points in the final quarter, they came back with
another touchdown to prove they weren’t quitters.

The big job ahead of Coach Dole now ts to teach his
men not to make the mistakes they did against the Gob-
blers. The most conspiciously weak point of the Cats’ de-
fense were, of course. the ends which Dean ran ragged last
Saturday. These positions, manned mainly by freshmen and
others not used to protecting the flanks, will probably be
the principal points of the W&E attack tomorrow. but per-
haps last week's experience plus Dole’s tutelage will be
enough to slow down the Generals here.

Between the tackles VPI had to fight for every inch they
gained, but the difference in weight between the visitors and
the home team was usually enough to insure at least a couple
of yards when a first down was needed. Still, few would deny
that the resistance put up by Ben Craig, Dickie Davis, Harold
Davis, Neal Graham. Bob Patten, Roger Wright. Bob Loy, et al.
was the strongest and most determined seen in a Davidson line
in a while.

Smart defensive playing in the backfield kept VPI
pass receptions at a minimum, and good pass defense will
again be at a premium tomorrow. The brightest spot here
was freshman Bobby Renn. whose ability at batting down
Dean's aerials saved the Cats more than once. And his punt-
ing? Well. you saw that. He only averaged 41 yards a try.

Looks as if the biggest setback the Cats have received in
this young season is the loss of fullback Henry Brown, whose
running against the Gobblers virtually kept Davidson in the
ball game. Henry’s wearing a cast now, says it won't come off
for four weeks, and the chances are he’s lost for the season. So
it looks now like the load will pass on to sophomore Leroy
Fargason and the versatile Bobby Renn, who'll play both full-
back and halfback.

From here it looks like it'll be an uphill fight all the way
tomorrow against the Generals. If Quarterback Ruth can shift
the Wildcats into high tomorrow, some folks will be pleasantly
surprised. If they don’t—well, the less said, the better. All the
students and fans can ask is that they try.

Wildcats, Dropping Opener,
Are Still ‘Not Disappointing’

By RONNIE WILSON

Davidsons’ reception into this
year’s Southern Conference compe-
tition last Saturday was something’
less than gentle, yet to call it dis-
appointing is both unfair and un-
true. VPT, one of the heaviest ath-

THEATRE

letic subsidizers in the conference,
had had its expensive nose rubbed
into the turf last year by “tiny
Davidson,” whose student body is
approximately one-tenth the size
of the Gobblers..

And adding insult to injury,
Johnny Guiton, who could have run
through several of their player's
legs, was the leading ground gainer
of the day, averaging over 5 yards a
carry. VPI definitely was up for
this year’s game after the way they
were treated in ‘St.

Add to that the fact of the super-

lative punting by the Gobblers. The
gentleman who handled that job
was undeniably an engineering ma-
jor, for no one else could have so
shrewdly calculated the distance,
windage and position, and advan-
tageously used it to kick outside
back of the 15-yard line so often.
The Wildcats, except for one sus-
tained drive, were always fighting
with their backs to the wall. Bobby
Renn, whose name should become
familiar around these parts soon,
frequently had the rather dubious
pleasure of kicking from behind his
own goal line, which he did excep-
tionally well. His only fault was
that he couldn’t punt 100 yards.
‘ Dean mixed his option plays and
his inside-tackle bucks well, capital-
izing on our lack of reservers. The
Thin Red Line is still meagerly
equipped with muscular bemehoths
of any dscription, and though many
a game has been won on guts alone,
the human body will only absorb
so much punishment before it must
necessarily yield to fresh invading
forces.

Weakened Cats Hit W. & L. Here Tomorrow

Dole Juggles Backtield

A Wildcat eleven hard hit by the loss of ace ground-gainer
Henry Brown will take the field here tomorrow afternoon
against Washington and Lee's highly favored Generals in the
second home game of the season.

The loss of fullback Brown dealt a sharp blow to David-
son's chances for hitting the victory trail this season.

Hard-plunging Henry, out of | ees
action indefinitely with a wrenched

knee, accounted for more total yard- Double Duty Man
age in last week's 27-14 licking by
VPI than the whole remaining Da-
vidson attack combined.

In Brown’s place Coach Bill
Dole will run Leroy Fargason
and freshman Bobby Renn, who
will alternate between his own
post at right half and the power
slot. .

Stop Option Plays

Biggest job the Cats will have
appears to be stopping option plays
of the same variety that VPI ran

halfbacks Jimmy Thacker, Roy

The Virignians, smarting

from a humiliating 34-7 defeat

machine in high gear and

won't be sparing any tricks to

rack up their first win of the

season. They whipped the Cate

Harriers To Open
Against N.C. State
On October 4

By BILL SLEDGE

Coach Pete Whittle’s Wildcat
cross countrymen open their season
against N.C. State October 4, and
nineteen candidates for the team
have been working hard for posi-
tions on the °52 squad.

A great deal of responsibility will
lie on the newcomers to the squad
as only three lettermen are return-
ing. They are Bill Shipley, Floyd
Feeny, and Bob Henry, captain of
the Wildcats this season. All three
of these boys are excellent runners
and sure bets for positions. on the
team. Also returning from last
year’s team are Paul Alexander and
Stuart Plummer.

Several good freshman speed-
sters are working hard for
berths on the squad, with S. G.
Gooding and Archie Joyner
showing promise in pre-season
workouts. Joyner, winner of the
freshman cake race last Friday,
is one of the brightest pros-
pects out of the newcomers.

A tough schedule is on tap for
the Wildcats and a good record
wilt be a big credit to the team.
The services of Tom and Dick
Stockton, two stalwarts of last
year’s team, who were lost through
graduation, will be sorely missed.

The remainder of the harriers’
schedule is as follows:

Oct. 1I—UNC: ...-.. Chapel Hill

Five New Men On Wildcat of the Week
With Brown On Sidelines \Coaches’ Roster|brown, Now Hurt, Was

By JOHN HANDLEY

Five new members of the David-
son coaching staff will be beginning
their first full year here when the
1952 seasons open. After a flurry
of signing and resigning last year,
these men emerged on the David-
son athletic scene:

BILL DOLE, head football coach,

School and Eastern Carolina Col-

Fall Net Practice
Opens on Monday

By MOODY SMITH

How to replace Allan Strand and
Dewey Keesler will be the problem
facing Davidson's new tennis coach
Dick McKee when he rings the
bell for the opening of Fall ten-
nis practice September 29.

Strand and Keesler are. the only
members of last season's sqnad who
will not be back this year, but their
absence will be sorely felt.. Strand
was captain of the 1951 squad while
Keesler captained last year’s team.

Returning from the 1952 edi-
tion which won 13 and lost only
four against some of the top
competition in the South and
the East will be Lacy Keesler,
who held down the number
one singles berth most of last
year; Johnny Bremer, Corky

Clark, and Joe Dudley from

the first six and George Snead

who played only in doubles.

Also available will be Leighton
Green, who saw some action last
season, Bill Riving, and Tom Staley,
if the latter’s Inb schedule permits.

Some help may be expected from
the fréshmen candidates who will
remain largely an unknown quantity
until practice gets underway.

Coach McKee, who was the
pro at the Charlotte Country

Club before accepting the Da-

vidson job, will remain in that

capacity. He replaces Derrick

Barton, the colorful former

British Davis Cup winner and

amateur champion, who is now

Great Against. Gobblers

By BOB OWENS

Anyone who gains over 100 yards per game is usually re-
garded as a great football player, and that is exactly what Coach
Dole thinks of his big 6’ 1", 180-pound fullback, Henry Brown,

from Carrollton, Georgia. _

Brown carried the pigskin, 19]

times for a net gain of 109 yards
and a sparkling average of 5.7 yards
per carry in Saturday's opener with
VPL and showed great power and
shiftiness both on offense and de-
fense.

Wade's Understudy

The vastly improved Brown, who
last season was an understudy to
the now yraduated Ham Wade,
made goo use of large holes
opened in the center of the VPI
line to rack up consistently good
gains, but. it was also in defensive
play that the lanky Georgian was
oustanding.

Brown came to Davidson from
Darlington where he teamed with
Jimmy Thacker and Harry Peter-
s¢n for three years of terrific foot-
ball. The trio has proven to be one
of Darlington prep’s finese contri-
butions to the rank and file of Da-
vidson football. He played. in all of
the Wildcats’ contests last season,
mainly on. defense, and was the
mainstay of the Cat attack in the
season's finale against Georgia
Tech, Where he established himself
as a leading candidate for the '52
starting fullback position,
