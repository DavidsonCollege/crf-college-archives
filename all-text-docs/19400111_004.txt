Cats Better Against Phantoms
After a tough start and a-poor showing against»conference
competition before the holidays and afterwards against Duke,
the ’Cats showed a lot more stuff Saturday night while losing

to the White Phantoms at Charlotte. While Carolina thasn’t
got the best team itt the league cither, they do have a good
one, and Davidson’s showing against them wasn’t bad at all
Mister Glamack astounded everyone with “lis one handed
wheel shots under the basket as he garnered 26 points, but
Footsie Cowan broke up more passes and took more balls off

the board than

minded_us.of Wake Forest's Jim Waller last year

The ’Cats’ main troubles now appear to be centered
about the inability of any other member of the squad to
break into the big score column along with Cowan. Of
course the attack is centered about him, and he is counted
on to score a lot, but with other mates scoring freely too,
the team’s hopes would rise considerably. However, after
the showing made at Charlotte last week against ‘the
Phantoms our Wildcats can be counted on to furnish trou-
ble for those teams with big reputations to uphold this
year. Tonight’s game with the Red Terrors of State at
the NEW gym is another conference tilt that the ’Cats
need to cop in order to be in line for that invite to the
