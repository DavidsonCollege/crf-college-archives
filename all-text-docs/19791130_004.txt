‘THE DAVIDSONIAN

Founded 1914

#4 The recent faculty action on the ICES forms has left a
bad:taste in a lot of people’s mouths. The students are
astounded, the administration discouraged, and the
ssional Affairs Committee dismayed. All were
ised with what went on at the November 6 meeting.
t the most astounding aspect of the recent faculty
_ evaluation vote is the lack of support by people who
previously promoted the ICES form. The attackers were
anxious. to shine bright lights on the flaws of the ICES
system while: the sepporters didn't even light.a candle.
‘There must have been some faculty members who were
wholly in‘favor of the forms before the November 6 faculty
‘meeting began. So why wasn’t there more arguing,
discussing or countering of anti-ICES proponents?
Perhaps it is the critical academic mind at work. Part of
scholarship is the tearing down, the looking into and
breaking up.of arguments and the ICES forms were
certainly dissected ari academic fashion.
What was lacking was some good old childlike
enthusiasm. ‘Those who had studied the forms or used
the forms had previously applauded them. It is difficult to

believe. that all those in favor of the forms were .

Seaddactory, Just suppose that the criticism aimed at
them is warranted. Then the burden falls upon those
faculty ‘members who opposed. the ICES. These people
must now suggest a better method of evaluation.

’ John Jackson put the question succinctly when he
asked “Are the faculty looking for the best possible form
of evaluation ‘or will they only settle for the perfect form?”

‘To aid the noble quest for the best possible evaluation
of faculty by students, the SGA and the Dav ian are
that asks faculty mem

methods of evaluation they prefer and what uses of that

information: they: would support. These: questionnaires

will be distributed at the-end of this week and the results
will be published in next week’s Davidsonian.

We hope. that some of the confusion will be cleared up
by a presentation of. positive information. Once we know
what the faculty: ‘want, we can start to design an
evaluation system that will be supported by the faculty

The Campus Forum

The Center
To the Editor:

In the last issue of the
Davidsonian before Thanksgiv-
ing break, Rick Johnston wrote
an article entitled ‘Priorities at
the Center’’ which contained
some inaccurate information
about the Center for Special
Studies. This letter is being
written to correct that informa-
tion and add some new informa-
tion.of its own.

First, although the Center
does limit pre-registration in
Center seminars to Center stu-
dents, regular College students

are allowed to fill any remaining

seats during drop-add, and
there are almost always some
left. For the seminar in Ameri-
can Foreign Policy taught by

3 Mr. Naas and Dr. Ortmayer,
‘there were three seats left after

pre-registration. Often, al-
though not in this particular
case, two-thirds to three-
fourths of the students enrolled
in Center seminars are non-
Center students.

Second, there is nothing
wrong with the general policy of
allowing Center students prior-
ity in registration. Contrary to
Mr. Johnston’s statement,
other College departments rou-
tinely. limit registration in upper
level seminars to majors, or; as
is the case this term in the
English department, to senior
majors in the department. In

- addition, Center. seminars are

offered, when possible, in accor-
dance with the programs of

_ individual Center students, and

i first priority in registration.
_ Ancidentally, I do believe. that
‘when there is a great demand.

for a cotirse such as Mr. Naas’

registration should be limited to
those students with a “‘demon-

strated interest” in the subject
—that is, those Center and
political science students whose
majors deal directly with, or are
related to, American foreign
policy should have priority over
those who are thinking of
taking the seminar only for
“cultural enrichment.’’)

Third, there is some general
information about the Center
for Special Studies (not the
“Honors Center’) which I
would like to pass on: The
students in the Center are there
because they wish to pursue a
specific field of study which is
unavailable in a regular college
major. Some of their programs
are interdisciplinary; others are
not. Although a program is by
its nature independent study, it
is always directed by a ‘fagulty
member of the Center. It entails
much more than students just
sitting in the lib reading
books. Tutorials and supervised
internships or independent
study, where appropriate, form
the core of any Center major.
Students in the Center get their
money’s worth of professors
just as much as they would in
regular courses; in fact, some
would even say we have more
access to the professors because
we don’t have to share them
with-twenty or thirty other
students.

Finally, the Center is not a
place for nerds, elitists, or
goof-offs. The students in the
Center are all there because
they are intensely interested in
a detailed project of their own
design. They are no better or
worse than any other Davidson
students, only perhaps a bit
weirder. (There may actually be

a: bit of truth in the nickname ~

“Center for Academic Mis-
fits!”) At any rate, if you're

interested in finding out more

* about the Center or if you're

wondering about designing a
major of your own, come on
over and talk to some of the
students and professors. It can
be whatever you make it, and
we who are there now are proud
of what it is.

Cat Messiah

To the Editor:

O.K. Me and some of the
guys on the hall have been
saving the lives of an awful lot
of cats lately. Except the time
when one of the foreign stu-
dents put this kitten in Jimmy
Prappas’ fry baby. And Banks
across the hall pretty much
abuses cats.

Anyway, I just wanted to say
that I’m in tight with the Cat
Messiah. How about you all?

Love,

John Siman, '82

P. S. Also, I’ve decided to
major in philosophy.
