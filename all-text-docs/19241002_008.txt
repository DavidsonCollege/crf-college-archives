SOME WONDERFUL
EXAMPLES OF FAITH

(Continued from page 1)
he had nothing to do with it, that it was
done against his will.

“The superintendent and the young minis-
ter prayed together, that the child not be
found that morning, for if such were the
case the witch doctors would claim honor to
themselves. They prayed that late that aft-
ernoon the babe might be brought home by
someone coming from afar away village.

“About dusk that evening a young boy,
coming from a far away village, and going
much further on his journey, came into the
village bringing the little girl with him.
The child had been brought home exactly
as the prayer had asked. That is the great-
est example of faith I have ever seen, and
the only incident that surpasses it, in my
knowledge, is the account of Elijah’s con-
test with the prophets of Baal. There is
power in the blood.”

“The second incident is that of an old
chief who had an affliction. The chief had
been advised by a missionary to visit a white
doctor in a village some 90 miles away. He
finally decided to go, much against the will
ofthe witch doctors, who set out on his trail |
making medicines to hinder him. However,
he went to the doctor, the affliction was re-
moved, and he was cured. He promised the
doctor that if, after five months, the afflic-
tion had not returned, he would-accept Chris-
tianity and with his acceptance would clean
up all the village. The affliction did not re-
turn, and five months later I was in the vil-
lage. I reminded the chief of his promise,
and he called for all the idols, fetishes, and
images, and had them destroyed, and the
village cleaned up. A year later I visited
the village, and there was not an idol to be
seen.”

“The third story was of a man who was
an anaemic, and suffering from a great loss
of blood. He was dying, and was bemg
borne away from a village where lived a
doctor. The man looked to me to heal him,
but I did not have the medicine, nor the
medical skill to heal him. They bore him
away, and as he went out of my sight, he
raised himself and looking back at me as if

me.’ I could not help him, because I had no
medicines, but that face is still «staring at
me.” ccgcitinusippboainiudeter’ : ;

The speaker ended with a plea for more
medical missionaries. “They are losking to
us. Shall we fail them?”

Pandeinic

The Pandeinic Literary Society held a
regular meeting Wednesday night, Sep-
tember 24, at which time 12 new men
were initiated. The initiation ceremony
was enjoyed by.both the candidates and
the members. A very humorous debate
was held between B. G. Alderman and
M. M. Lockhart on the ‘negative and
P. G. Garrison and D. W. Hancock on
the affirmative. J. S. Foster was ap-
pointed for an oration also. Each can-
didate introduced hiinself, telling where
he was from, why he had come to David-
son, and giving the name of his girl.
This ended the candidates’ part in the
program.

e president called upon Monk and
Hollingsworth to speak a few words to
the new men. This they did, telling
them the purposes of and reasons for
the society and calling upon them to
take an active part in it during the
coming year.

The new men were welcomed by a
rising vote of the society, after which
everyone enjoyed a feast prepared by
E. K. Regen.

The following men were initiated: H.
B. G. Arbuckle, Owen A. Chatham, P. G.
Garrison, J. S. Grey, M. M. Lockhart, D.
W. Hancock, B. McClaugherty, L. L.
Dubose, J. Falls, J. M. Yonan, S. M.
Steele, and B. G. Alderman.

Philanthropic

The Phi Society met last Thursday
night at nine o’clock, and after a regu-
lar program, presided over by Vice-Pres-
ident Ratchford, proceeded to the bus-
iness of “Fresh” initiation. This was in
charge of C. C. McMillan, who gave the
old members a treat by the tricks he
played on the ten new men. Part of
these gave humorous improvisations on

Bryant led the song service, Purdy was
pianist, and Hamilton and Gray rendered
violin duet. Paul Patterson and Buck Shaw
led in prayer during the_ meeting.

Made Feasible

Writing life insurance has
enabled many a man to pay his
way through college. It is a
dignified calling and a true social
service,

To induce your fellows to form
habits of thrift — to obligate
them to put by a little of their
income — to safeguard them
against future loss of earning
power—is a form of effort that
brings keen satisfaction as well
as profit.

These are only a few of the
reasons why the insurance bus-
iness today is attracting the
very best brains of America.

Write for the full particulars of
a plan whereby you can assist
yourself through college, and,
at the same time, prepare for a
profitable and satisfactory bus-
iness career.
