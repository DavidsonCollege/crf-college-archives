Davidson And The Southern: An Unfr

First tn A Series
By RUSS MERRITT
Sports Writer

On a cold, wind-blown afternoon in Feb-
ruary, 1936, officials from six southern
colleges met in a smoke-filled room in Rich.
mond, Va., with representatives from the
10 schools then comprising the Southern
Conference.

The purpose of the meeting was to dis-
cuss the admission of six newcomers into
the South’s most powerful conference.
Among those that were admitted was Da-
vidson Collgee.

Since that afternoon more than 32 years
ago, Davidson and the Southern have gone
through many changes, changes for the
better for the Wildcats only.

Davidson's contributions to the conference
sports program have been few, and, until
the recent surge toward prominence in
basketball and several minor sports, very
rare. Not until 1954, a full 18 years after
joining the conference, did a Wildcat team
capture any league title.

The Coming Of The “Fly”

The “Fly” comes to Richardson Field tomorrow.

‘Disguised as a Paladin quarterback, the “Fly” will
no doubt take to the air a good bit in an effort to
squelch any Wildcat swats.

Clyde Hewell is the “Fly.”

The name is appropriate in one sense, but quite
inaccurate in another. At 5-10, 158 pounds, Hewell is
dwarfed by everyone he plays against, but in ability,
he stands as a giant.

‘ In spite of his slightly-less-than-formidable appear-
ance, the Furman senior
has already become the
greatest passer in the
school’s history, and he
has the remainder of this
season to continue his
streak of broken Paladin
records.

He holds nine individ-
val passing and total of-
fense records at Furman
after only two seasons as
a varsity player. The road
for this year, however, is
a bit rockier with the un-
anticipated loss of his
favorite receiver.

At the other end of 53
of the “Fly’s” pass com-
pletions last year was
classmate Robbie Hahn, another remarkable small man.
At 5-9, 170 pounds, he was nicknamed the “Flea,

The “Fly and Flea” combination was broken up
early this year after an unfortunate and controversial
run-in with the Furman honor code. Details need not
be expounded here, but the case’s outcome’ upset a
number of people in Greenville, especially the Furman
football squad.

Hewell has been somewhat hampered by Hahn’s
departure. His passing average is considerably lower
this year, but his game is improving as his new re-
ceivers gain experience.

From his Elberton, Ga., home last weekend, Hewell

Wildcats To Host
Purple Paladins

Two losing teams, the Wild-
cats of Davidson and the Pur-
ple Paladins of Furman meet
tomorrow in an effort to
make one of them a winner.

The Wildcats are 1-3 and
return to action after a two
week fay-off.

Furman Is also 1-3 after a
34-0 108s to Richmond fast
Saturday.

The Paladins’ attack fea-
tures the passing of quarter-
back Clyde Hewell and the
running of slotback Jimmy
Jordan. ,

Davidson also boasts an ex-
cellent quarterback in Gordon
Slade, second in the nation in
passing, as well as a host of
fine receivers including Mike
Kelly, George Hannen, and
Rusty Lawrence.

Coach Homer Smith will
make an effort to strengthen
the Wildcats’ outside running
game by moving sophomore
sprint star Rick Lyon to half-
back as Hannen moves to
tight end.

Kickoff is at 2 p.m. on
Richardson Field.

championship basketball
teams of 1966 and 1968, the Wildcats have
won the golf title six times and the tennis
crown six times, including the last four
years in a row.

That leaves Davidson without a champion
in wrestling, baseball, football, indoor and
outdoor track, cross-country, rifle, swim-
ming and soccer (started as a league sport
in 1966) in 32 years.

Now, with most of the other conference
teams beginning to subsidize athtetes in
the minor sports, it is a question of time
before Davidson loses its stranglehold on
the golf and tennis tities.

A veteran Charlotte sportswriter who has
observed the Southern scene for some time
best described Davidson's early contribu-
tions to the conference when he said, ‘until
recently, Davidson was the type of team
that you padded your schedule with and
used to pick up another win.

“As the records show, Davidson simply
did not have the type teams that could win
any chmapionships,"’ he said.

A conference official, who also wished to
remain unidentified, described the Wildcats
prior to 1960 as being “‘one of the weaker
teams in the conference. They definitely
were not as important as they are now.”

Then, of course, came Lefty Driesell,
Fred Hetzel and company, who literally
put Davidson on the map sports-wise.

After that emergence, and especially
since the departure of Virginia Tech and
West Virginia, Davidson has been one of

Unified Foglemen

To Tackle

By DON PARMAN
Sports Writer

The Davidson soccer squad
will try to put its newly
found punch into an attack
this afternoon in a key South.
ern Conference match with
Furman.

The game will be played
on the Davidson soccer field
at 3 p.m., and Coach Harry
Fogleman feels that the
team is “ready to win."

The ‘Cats dropped a close
battle with undefeated Bel.
mont Abbey Tuesday, 3-2.
but drew the praise of Abbey
coaches and players for their
performance.

Nearly 1,000 fans watched
the game, played at Bel-
mont, where soccer is the

‘major sport.

“The boys played a fine
game,’ Fogleman said, ‘‘and
they moved the ball well. A
few key defensive slip-ups
were the deciding factors,
though."

Jim Marrow and Jim Mc-
Dowell scored for Davidson.
Marrow’'s score came on a
penalty kick, and McDowell
hit the nets on a cross pat-

tern shot.

“The team is unified now.”’
Fogleman said after the
game. ‘We are moving and
we are playing good defense.

feel ready for anyone now.”

a firm hold on the lead in

said “Robbie Hahn was a very good receiver and we
all miss him, but we have good receivers at Furman
and they are getting the job done.”

Perhaps the key to Hewell’s success as a passer

and dedication to the game. Last summer he ran over
1,500 miles and threw the ball some 5,000 times. He is

an extremely hard worker on the field, and impresses
people with his hustle.

But Hewell loves the game.

“It seems that I have been playing football all my
life,” he said, “and I hope that I can continue with the
game in the coaching capacity after Furman.” _

He has had some big moments to reward him for
his work. He smashed a Southern Conference record
last year with 354 passing yards against Samford (the
record has since been topped by Davidson’s Gordon
Slade). He topped Jimmy Poole and the conference
last season in both passing yardage and in total yard-
aee The biggest moment, though, at least in Hewell’s
eyes, was being named 1967 South Carolina Player of
the Year. He says the honor has meant a great deal,
and he is out trying to capture it again this year.

Hewell sta his football career as a midget

player (quite a propriate ) in Elberton, and went right
on into varsi gh school play at Elberton High
School.
He kicked extra points in high schooMind had two
outstanding years as a quarterback, but his size limited
the number of college offers that he received. The
other schools’ losses were Furman’s gain.

But he is small, and at times it hinders him, as it
hindered Jimmy Poole, Davidson’s mini-mite, durin
his Southern Conference days. Eackrtim® he gets hit,
Furman Coach Bob King closes his eyes. ;

“1 don’t see how he takes some oi the beatings,”
King says. ‘“‘He’s so small, but bounces right up after
getting hit by players twice his size.”

He ed by size, Furman has as much trouble
as Davidson in producing a winning season, but it
comes a lot closer to achieving its goal with the “Fly”
on its side.

When he was pointed out to@fWNat spring at
Furman, I couldn’t believe anyone so diminutive in
size could be Clyde Hewell. Even in pads, he looks like
he is standing in a hole.

But the “Fly” surprises some people, and tomor-
row afternoon he will display any surprises he has
stored under his wings.

“Fly” swatters are “in” tomorrow.

Asst. Sports Editor

One of the most exciting
and explosive teams in the
IMAC in the past few weeks
has been Sigma Nu.

After two losses at the
outset of the season the Nu's
have not lost another game,
and are almost certain to
finish in at least a tie for
second place.

The Nu's have exhibited a
devastating offense engin-
eered by tailback Bruce
Weidner. Weidner’s  quick-
ness and balance allow him
to dodge a charging rusher
and make him all but un-
stoppable.

The Nu’s have averaged
41 points per game when
Weidner has played as com.
pared to 17 points per game
when be was absent. Even a
double rush employed by the
Sigma Chi's failed to stop
Weidner, as the Nu’s had
their most productive game,
scoring 44 points.

In fact, the Nu’s are un-
beaten in games Weidner has
played. The two losses, to

the SAE’s 26.13 and to the.

Phi Delts 9-6, were both
sustained when he was ab-
sent.

It would be interesting in-
deed to see a rematch be-
tween the undefeated Delts
and the Nu's with Weidner
playing.

Weidner is supported on
offense by an experienced
cast, almost all seniors. Toby

Steve Hayes at halfback
have been Weidner’s favorite

The defense has been good
also, although not as spec-
tacular as the offense. The
backfield is
strong. Weidner at safety,
Hayes and Westmoreland at
the halfbacks, and George
Skinner at linebacker make
up a fine backfield unit. John
Lambert does an excellent
job at rusher.
