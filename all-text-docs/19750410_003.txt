Freshmen admissions dictate
changes in housing policies

Direttor of Admissions H. Ed-
munds White is anticipating a
fréshmen class of 110° women
and 257 men next year as op-
posed to the planned 92 women
and 270 men in the Class of ’79.

White informed Director of
Student Housing Scotty Nicholls
of the changé ‘Good Friday

evening.
As a result of the deviation
from the projected

male/female ratio, Nicholls has
proposed several plans for on-
campus housing next year

One floor in Sentelle Dor-
mitory will go to upperclass
women and one_ upperclass
women’s floor in Little Dor-
mitory will be used for fresh-
men women next .year, ac-
cording to Nicholls.

“TI would like it,better if I
didn’t have to make anyone
move out of his room, par-
ticularly the rising seniors in
Sentelle, but there is no alter-
_native that I can see,’ said
Nicholls.

“If we hadn’t had the in--

crease in freshmen women, I
wouldn’t have had to use fourth
floor Sentelle.’’

Ten women will be housed in
the basement. of Carnegie
Building, 49 will be housed on
fourth floor Belk, and 29 on four-
th floor Sentelle.

The remainder will live on -

one of three upper floors in Lit-
tle Dormitory, the freshmen
women’s Watts Dormitory, or
in off-campus housing.

The housing situation is tight
again this year, and Nicholls
predicted an.equal amount of
confusion next. year as students
attempt to find housing.

“There are still places
available off campus. However,
except. for women, I have quit
encouraging them to make
arrangements off campus,”’
said Nicholls.

She indicated that. not
everyone who had requested an

on-campus room had received :

one.

“‘T couldn’t operate if every-
one who wanted. a room got one
in April. I expect about the
same number as last year to be
without rooms,” said Nicholls.

“But no matter how tight it
seems to be, I always have emp-

ty beds left in the fall. Whoever
or whatever is. up there wat-
ching over Davidson seems to
take care of that,’’ Nicholl" ad-
ded.

“A few women will not get
room assignments this spring.
They’re going to be treated just
like the males. I’m playing it a
lot closer to the chest this
year,’’ said Nicholls.

“The best situation for a girl
living off campus is to rent a
room in someone’s house. This
is a more practical
arrangement for a girl than for
a male, but the people in the
town don’t seem to want girls.

“T think that’s just because
for SO many years we’ve been so

male-student oriented,’’
Nicholls said.

The housing director expects

‘no changes in, the composition

of Duke and Belk Dormitories.

‘‘We have two prime pieces of
real estate on this campus,
Duke Dormitory and fourth
floor Belk,’’ Nicholls continued.
“Since the majority of the cam-
pus is male, I think they should
have Duke.

‘‘With the girls in Belk, I think
it’s the only way to do it from
the standpoint of equity,’

‘Nichols said.

Freshmen males will occupy

‘ all of Cannon and all but the

basement of Richardson, ac-

‘ cording to Nicholls.

Union finances off

better organized now, we are in-

terested in starting a system of

cosigning checks . and
authorization slips’’; com-
mented Wassen.

“T_am sure the system of co-

signing checks would work well

if students who are authorized
to sign checks act responsibly.
“For .sure, under such a
system, the students’ would
have ample opportunity to
make themselves fully aware of
how much money was leaving
the Union account and for what

.purpose checks were being

written’’, Davidson said.

Although several members of
the Union Board criticize Smith
for being away from Davidson
too often, Wassen feels that
“Shaw’s travels are an ex-
tension of his position.

developed have contributed
greatly to our Union program-
