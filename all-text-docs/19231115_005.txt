Red Lights, The Rear Car, and Green
Goddess to Be Shown on
Screen

One of the greatest mystery plays of the:
year was “The Rear Car” by Edward Rose.
The play ran for a long period in many large
theatres and was pronounced by many as the
best mystery story since “The Bat.”

The Goldwyn Company has made — the
screen version of this play. “Red Lights” as
the screen story is called, has in the cast
many of the best artists, including Raymand
Griffith, Marie Prevost, Johnnie Walker and
Alice Lake.

The consensus of opinion among the film
producers is that the American audience pre-
fers first of all good, clean comedy. Its
second choice is the mystery story. In “Red
Lights” which coming here Saturday |
Night, the mysterious complications keep a!
tense interest thruout, and hold the audience
in a state of suspense until the very last |
scene. During the production off the stage
play members of the audience shricked and
gasped at the thrilling situations. The screen
version promises to present much more of a
thrill, as the different scenes can be made
more realistic than they could possibly have
been on the stage. The greater part of the
action transpires on the rear car of the Con-
tinental Limited.

‘What Theatre Magazine has to say about
“The Green Goddess” which is to be here
next week, “In the screen version, the sa-
tire is ignored, but the melodrama remains.
It is uncommonly good melodrama,
rushing and pictorially exciting. In fact the
sereeen has the advantage over the stage in
that scenes like the aeroplane accident an
the bombing of the palace are elaborated with |
a fidelity that’ was naturally impossible be-
hind the footlights. And Sidney Olcott, the
director, has caught with startling effect, the |
lights and shadows of the weird and unnam-
ed country in the Himalayas.

terse,

Most playgoers know the story of the lit-
tle group of English Travelers wrecked in
this strange land and left at the mercy of ‘a
suave and silken Rajah of Rukh. The plot
revolves around the efforts of this smiling
villiain to get the beautiful English matron |
into his clutches, a scheme which is foiled by |
much byplay with wireless and hurling of |
bombs in the hands of rescuing troops.

In the screen cast, this version retains the
two arch-villains of the stage: George Arliss |

as the sinister Rajah and Ivan Simpson as |

the purring, cringing valet. Mr. Arliss, by
some magic of his own, makes his villainy |
. as subtle on the screen as it*was on the stage. |
