Men? s track finishes ninth x
Southern Conference meet

By ANDY ARMSTRONG
Staff Writer

The men’s track team braved
the altitude and elements at the
Southern Conference Champion-
ships last weekend in Boone, but
finished a disappointing ninth, tal-

lying only four points.

Dan Dearing scored
Davidson’s only points, placing
fourth in the javelin.

The real story of the meet was
the arctic conditions in which it was
run. The team arrived Friday to find
the meet delayed due to ice on the
track and temperatures hovering in
the 30s. Strong winds on Friday
dropped the wind chill down into
the 20s. Saturday was much of the
same.

“There were a lot of solid per- :

formances considering the condi-

tions,” said coach Gary Andrew.
“With the weather and altitude it is
tough to compare to previous
meets.”

Dearing’s longest throw of 169
feet, seven inches was good enough
for fourth.

“The weather definitely ef-
fected most of our performances,
but all the teams ran in the same
weather,” said the sophomore, who
now owns six of the top ten javelin
throws in school history.

Despite the conditions, the
Wildcats were able to muster sea-
son-best performances in some other
events.

Ken Howard ran the best time
all year in the 800 meters, coming in
at 1:59.4. In the 100, Steve Hsieh
ran a season-best 11.59 seconds.
And Eugene Jung had season-best
throws in both the shot put and

discus, with distances of 40 feet, 2
3/4 inches and 112 feet, 7 inches,
respectively.

VMI won the conference cham-
pionship with 132.33 points, fol-
lowed by Western Carolina with
103 points and Marshall with 102.
VMI’s win extended the VMI-Ap-
palachian St. dominance of outdoor
track, as the teams have split the last
20 outdoor championships.

The track team loses only two
seniors next year, Jung and Dave
Foss.

“We are going to miss Eugene
and Dave, but we return most of our
team,” said Dearing.

“Next year looks good for us.
Hopefully, we’ll get some people
scoring at conference.”

“As we continue to get more
experience, we will become more
competitive in conference,” added
Andrew.

“We are a young team, and we
need to build from this experience
and continue to get better.”

well,” Joyce explained. ‘They tra-
ditionally keep the score low against
us. They just did their job on Fri-
day.”

For the Wildcats, the focus
shifts to the final two games of the
season - Tuesday’s Senior Day game
against Wake Forest at Wildcat Park

and Thursday’s season finale ver-
sus Wofford in Spartanburg, S.C.
give the squad its first 20-win sea-
son since 1994.

“That would be a great way to
end our senior season if we could
beat them (Wake) on Senior Day,”
said Quattlebaum, speaking for the
team’s nine other fourth-year play-
ers. “Coach (Dick) Cooke wants to

play as many seniors as possible.
Not many coaches would do that.”
“We’re definitely pushing for
20 wins, and we can get there with
our seniors in,” added Joyce.
“We’ll have a few juniors and
sophomores helping out, but our

‘seniors can do the job. They won’t

be going out there just to say good
bye.”
