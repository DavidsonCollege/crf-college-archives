~ Necessary voice”
speaks in tongues

By CHAD FoGLEMAN
Staff Writer

Micheal Hofmann’s “neces-
sary voice” sighed softly in its Brit-
ish accents to a 900 Room audi-
ence straining for the sound and
sense of this often difficult poetry
of foreignness. ‘“Evé@rywhere is
abroad to me,” confessed the Ger-
man-born, British-educated poet
and translator who now teaches at
the University of Florida in
Gainsville.

His poem “The Machine that
Cried” digests “the crux”. for
Hofmann: “When I learned that
my parents were returning/ to Ger-
many, and that I was to be jetti-
soned,/ I gave a sudden lurch into
infancy and Englishness.”

The words of .his poem
“Guanajuato Two Times” seem
applicable to much of Hofmann’s
work; “slowly familiar/ slowly in-
visible, amiable, obtuse...”

“Tt’s hard,” Professor Ralph
Black mused upon Hofmann’s
reading; yet the poetry’s heaviness
has its undeniable humor.

“My humour was gravity”
says the speaker of “Ancient Eve-
nings,” “so I sat us both in an
armchair/ and toppled over back-
wards.”

In “‘Scylla and Minos” from
his collection of translations After
Ovid , the hilarity of his colloqui-
ally mythic language washes the
solemn germ of Hofmann’s own
poetic impetus— his “lack of af-
filiation.” “I thought: gimme!”
exclaims the besieged maiden upon
beholding Minos, the besieger. “A
big girl wants a man like that,”
Scylla pines, then betrays her city
with the unrealized hope: “Per-
haps if we lost... then I’d get to be
his wife or his sex slave or some-
thing.”

Of Hofmann’ s reading,

“Thayer Long opined enigmatically,

“It’s subtle ... very subtle.” Ver-
sifier Geordie Schimmel (who cer-
tainly deserved a blurb on the jacket
of one of Hofmann’s books K.S. in
Lakeland, Acrimony, or Corona,
Corona ) reflected: “He was ... a
perspicuous and rapt attention to
the particularities of our existence,
to the things which comprise us.”

Stuffing both thin hands in his

pants’ pockets, Hofmann read for

an hour of “Metympsychosis,” of
“Marvin Gaye,” of the American
South and Leonard Skynard’s
“Freebird,” of piss artists, parri-
cide, Cambridge, and the Primrose
Path: The wideness of his red-
rimmed eyes above high cheek-
bones and the occasional jerk to

scratch his head accentuated the
smooth sounds of his easy, wispy
conversation.

Hofmann urges “everything

is essential — there are no details” :

in his poem “The Machine That
Cried”; of “From A to B and Back
Again,” he quips “‘a-lot of things
are done for no reason at all.”
Overwhelmingly, Hofmann’s po-
etry aspires to “subterfuge, buried
meaning, implication.” Consider
the final line of “Wheels”: “wheel-
chair hulls, rhombuses, stalled
quartz.”

The poet, having pe ccletad
and intrigued his audience with the
“dance of intellect” among his
words, bowed slightly, smiled, and
shrugged.

Senior theater project
addresses feminine imagination

_Amanda Davis interprets two short stories into plays

By JENNIFER MILLER
Guest Writer

“Do you ever have rape fanta-
sies?” abruptly asked Chrissy (Kay
Walraven) in one of the two one-
act plays from Amanda Davis’s
senior project.

The plays, Rape Fantasiesand
The Yellow Wallpaper, were per-
formed by Jessica Robblee, Kay
Walraven, Sarah Hankins, and
Amanda Davis on Monday and
Tuesday night in the Black Box
Theater.

The plays were adapted from
their original texts by Davis and
took an active role in women’s
month,

A theater major with a gender
studies concentration, Davis says

she has always planned her senior
project to address women’s issues
or to come from women authors.
Rape Fantasies is a comical
look at a serious issue that can be
very emotional. Despite the play’s
light-hearted mood depicting love
affairs with James Bond-types and
steamy bathtubs, the serious mes-

sage — that rape is real and hap-

pens —comes clearly across. The
play’s point is delivered through
humor so that afterwards, the audi-
ence realizes the play’s inherent
contradiction.

Yellow Wallpaper, adapted
from Charlotte Perkin Gilman’s
1892 short story, was a change of
pace. Though the play takes place
in the late 19th century, modern

audiences can relate to its theme of

defining one’s self. The one-
woman, one-act is a surreal and
eye-opening look at the effects of
the society-imposed roles of
women.

Though the play had limited -

props, the image of the wallpaper
“with lines that suddenly commits
suicide” was vividly painted by

“the performer, Amanda Davis. Di-

rector Jimmy Lloyd said he-used
blue and green lighting to produce
a “sick look” on Amanda’s skin

_ and warm lights of red and orange

on the “normal side” of the room.

The play’s “theater in the
round” presentation (in which au-
dience members watch from every
angle) yielded an intimate perfor-

_ mance that both the audience and

the performers enjoyed.
