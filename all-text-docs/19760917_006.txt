Eleven take jaunt to Paris in

By CAROLINE

Have you ever thought how
nice it would be to spend a
spring in France? That is what
a group of eleven students did
last spring quarter under the
direction of art history profes-
sor Larry Ligo, in the first art
history seminar abroad offered
at Davidson College.

Dr. Ligo first developed the
idea of travelling and studying
art history ten years ago. Once
he finished with his doctoral
dissertation, he was able to
concentrate on the format he
wanted to establish.

The itinerary the first group
followed was not just hit-and-
miss: Ligo travelled and cam-
ped through Europe and
France setting up a well-plan-
ned day-by-day schedule,
keeping a journal of camp-
sites, restaurants, and interes-
ting details along the way.

The year before last he
began to recruit prospectives,
but not enough interest was
shown to make the trip. Last
fall he began again and suc-
cessfully had eleven people
definitely decide to attend.
There were seven girls and

four boys ranging from fresh-

men to seniors. All arrange-
ments were made throughout
the fall and winter terms with
the group meeting every week
to discuss and complete all
details.

Gothic architecture and
19th century painting were the
two courses of emphasis in
France. Each student was
assigned a topic from both
courses on which a paper was
written during winter term
and the first two weeks of
spring term.

Finally, on March 21, the
group left Douglas Airport in
Charlotte to fly to New York
and there board an Icelandic
jet to head for Europe, taking
one short stop in Iceland.
Landing in Luxembourg the
students boarded a train to
Paris, home base for the

group.
The Hotel Star in the 15th
arondissement was the

group’s home for the next two
months. For the first week
study concentrated on 19th
century painters such as
David and Delacroix at the
Louvre. It was tough mana-
ging the language, changing
money, and learning how to
get around a city like Paris.

group were lost at least once.
They may not have under-
stood directions in French or
be able to find where they were
on the may, but Paris is such a
safe and friendly place, they
could not be afraid.

The second week was spent
in Chartres where each stu-
dent lived with a family. Many
went to bed every night with a

‘headache from trying so hard

to carry on a fluent conversa-
tion.

guide at Chartres Cathedral,

day including an exceptional
tour into the towers, buttres-

‘The third week was spent in
Paris. The first road trip
through France began the
fourth week. They rented
three Renaults which the
group undoubtedly wore out
with all the kilometers they
racked up.

They also rented camping

equipment and for the next
two weeks they braved the
elements: wind, a whole lot of
rain, a little sun, rocky
ground, and even a little snow.
As a‘team they became the
fastest tent-builders and-air

where they did not need a light
to put the tent up.
Campsites were very nice
with hot showers and restroom
facilities. The excursion

Hashmiimmortalizes himself

By BILL BARNES
Staff Writer

The Oath and Amen is one-
time Davidson College inter-
national student Alamgir
Hashmi’s first book of poetry.
It includes work he has done
over the past five years and
consists mostly of love poetry
and of poetry of loss and
longing.

Hashmi’s work is not cou-
ched in the usual English
rhetoric; Hashmi is a Paki-
stani, and was first published
there. His poetry conveys
something of the high, occas-
ionally almost formalized Eng-
lish that is spoken in the
Indian- subcontinent. State-
ments readily couched in our
American. dialect, or in “the
King’s English’, appear stil-
ted, as in the poem ‘‘Season of

Shivering in Sleeves’, when
Hashmi asks,

when my skyline succumbs

to the earth

as her body,

how can I precisely

scribe what precisely is it?

The partial language barrier
apart, these poems are for the
most part passable, and some
are very good. Of the love
poems, ‘Statement of a Few
Friendly Suggestions”’, ‘‘Gha-
zal’, ‘‘We Know Dry Lips’”’
and “‘A Rejuvenation” stand
out as emotive and deceptively
simple.

It is perhaps this same
simplicty, however, which de-
tracts from certain other of
Hashmi’s poems. Very few of
his pieces are grounded solidly
within a world of sensible
appearances; many of his ima-

ges are abstractions which
sometimes border on the trite.
Images of ‘‘the last acre’’, or
of ‘‘proletarian desire’’ do not
engage the senses.

What we must look for in
Hashmi’s poetry, then, is not
a firm connection with the
world of physical reality, but a
commitment to abstraction
which is often difficult to
make, especially when the
abstractions are cross-cult-
ural, as Hashmi’s are.

Hashmi does not write
about America as such, nor>
about Pakistan as such, but
leaves us with an emotive
attachment to his work which
is hard to account for. It is
formed through his use of
abstractions and strange jux-
tapositions and somehow re-
mains despite his sometimes
excessive fragmented love
poems.

Hashmi’s ‘Distractions’,
the last seven poems in The
Oath and Amen are not as
abstract as his love poems.
His two “Images: About the
House” poems are good read-
ing, though still lacking a firm
foundation, and “Six Studies
of an Image’’ attempts a mul-
tifaceted explanation of rain.

Taken as a whole, The Oath
and Amen makes good, but by
no means great, reading.

Ideas and images do stand out
occasionally; for instance, in
the third stanza of ‘‘Snares”
and in ‘‘A Seasonal Urge’,
and for mood poetry it isn’t
bad. But as in much mood
poetry, you must look hard to
find any stretch for the sky.
