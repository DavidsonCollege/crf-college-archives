New artist, old images in Union show

The Union Gallery currently
features artist Florence Putter-
man. Putterman returns again
and again in her subject matter
to nature’s forms and the
primitive imagery of earlier
cultures as sources to enforce
her personal philosophy.

Go Solar

Students can combine service
with a breath of fresh air this
weekend by helping with the
Solar Greenhouse Construction
Workshop. Participants will
build a solar greenliouse on the
side of the railroad depot. The
greenhouse will provide a heat
source for the Davidson Senior

Citizen’s Center.
The workshop, which is spon-

sored by the Y Student Service
Corps, the Senior Center, and
the U.S. Department of En-
ergy, will be Friday 1-5, Satur-
day 10-4, and Sunday 1-5.
Workshop participants
should dress warmly and bring
small hand tools.

Her imagery relates to the
marks left by early pre-literate
people on walls and caves and
to the non-verbal communica-
tive symbols that they used to
express their interests in food-
gathering, rituals, magic, dance
and protection against preda-
tors.

Putterman, who resides in
Pennsylvania, has studied at
Penn State, Bucknell and NYU.
She has a permanent collection
at the Metropolitan Museum of
Modern Art. She has also
exhibited her work at the Chi-
cago Institute of Fine Arts.
