SGA Phonathon Moved To Feb.

By Steven Lilly

Instead of being held during
the end of November the SGA
Phonathon will now take place
during the last two weeks of Feb-
tuary. This move comes after a
change in the Campaign for
Davidson’s fiscal year which now

ends in June instead of January.
In recent years the Phonathon
has enjoyed tremendous success.
Last year the grand total raised by
student callers was over $300,000.
Money pledged each year during

‘the Phonathon is put into the

school’s Annual Fund, which in-
cludes everything from the Wild-
cat Club to the purchase of new

light bulbs for the dormitories.

The Phonathon is one of the
few projects in which the entire
student body participates. Mem-
bers of all of the Patterson Court
houses as well as Independents
and Freshmen have a specific call-
ing night to raise money.

The calling times are from
6:00pm to 9:00pm and the money
raised by each group is pooled.
The total is then recorded on the
bulletin board in the main hall of
Chambers.

Even though the Phonathon
will take place after Self-Selection
this year freshmen are still going to
be able to call as a class. The

decision came as good news to
Freshman Class President, Eric
Rosenbach, who felt it would be a
good way for the freshman class to
participate as a whole.

Some goals of the Phonathon
have changed along with the dates.
It willnow be more of a “clean up”
time to contact those alumni who
have not had a chance to give. As
a result, the Phonathon itself may
notreach the record totals it has in
the last three years.

Hopefully the Annual Fund
will continue to grow, however, as
alumni support and involvement
increases during this year’s SGA
Phonathon.

Stell Speaks On Living Wills

By Kevin Miller

Dr. Lance K. Stell, chair of the
Department of Philosophy at
Davidson and Professor of Clini-
cal Ethics of the Department of
Internal Medicine at the Carolinas
Medical Center, briefed students
and faculty members last Tuesday
on the new provision of the Omni-
bus Budget Reconciliation Act that
goes into effect on December 1.

This provision, entitled “The
Patient Self Determination Act”,
Stated intent is to assure “a pa-
tient’s right to participate in and
direct health care decisions.” The
requirements of the Act apply to
all hospitals, health maintenance
organizations, nursing facilitiesand
home health providers that receive
reimbursement from Medicare or
Medicaid.

Professor Stell explained that
since the days of dying in peace on

the family death bed in the pres-
ence of relatives has given way to
passing away in a cold hospital
room with IV’s, machines and
strangers, many have felt the need
for some way to escape the con-
stant aggressive responses by doc-
tors to any threat of death no matter
what the prognosis.

Stell said that arguments for

the right to control personal health
care decisions fall under the inal-
ienable rights given by the U.S.
Constitution, namely, the right to
choose and the right to privacy.
Arguments for those opposed fall
under the questions of ‘Is this sui-
cide?’ and ‘Is this morally cor-
rect?’

Stell said that when Congress
became faced with this issue they
surprisingly answered the debate
with a “yes,” therefore making
patient self-determination legal.

Specifically, the Act requires
providers (hospitals, health main-
tenance organizations, etc.) to give
out “written information to each
adult patient at time of admission
concerning his or her right under
state law to make medical deci-
sions regarding his or her own
medical care including the right to
accept or to refuse medical or sur-
gical treatment and the right to
execute advance directives (such
as living wills and durable powers
of attorney.)”

This means that whena person
is admitted to a medical facility or
is under some sort of care, he can
make out a living will. This is a
document stating what todo if they
becomeincompetent, terminally ill
Or fall into'some Sort Of vegetative
state. The person could also elect
