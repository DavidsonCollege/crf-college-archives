Homer

Faces
Trial

Lewis Homer, a Davidson
junior, will face trial April
25 on charges of disorderly
conduct in connection with
an incident which occurred
in front of Johnson's Barber
Shop last Saturday night

Mecklenburg County Police
made the arrest and charg-
ed Homer with disorderly
conduct. Bond was set at
$250.

A crowd of about 15, in
cluding students and towns-
people, was present when
the arrest occurred. The
group had been discussing
the recent boycott of his bar
ber shop with Johnson

Six county policemen and
two town policemen arrived,
arrested Homer and dispers-
ed the crowd.

Appoints Ravenel And Doe

The newly-inaugurated stu-
dent Senate voted to endorse
the boycott of Ralph John
son's barber shop Tuesday

night by a vote of 7-2, and
then passed, 62, a “resolu
tion of intent” for the stu
dent body to underwrite any
resulting losses by Johnson
over the next several years.

Members of the Residence
Hall. Council, Experimental
College Board. a chapel
speakers committee, and a
committee to sct up a radio
station were elected by the
student Senate last night

In addition, Will Ravenel
was elected Senate secretary
and Ernie Doe SGA treasur-
er. Both were unopposed.

In the resolution to en-
dorse the boycott, all Senate
members except freshman
Gary Cash and junior John
Passmore voted in favor.
Covey Carter was absent, but
indicated he would have vot
ed against both resolutions
Rick Howard abstained on
the resolution of intent.

Passmore, acting secre
tary, explained the resolu
tion of intent as “our intent

for making a commitment to
Johnson for making a com
mitment to us.”

Appointed to the Experi
mental College Board were
Sam Darby, Fletcher Hart-
sell, Ashton Trice, Marvin

Ellison, Rich Cowart and Bob
Folger

Jim May, Marvin Ellison
and James Parks were ap

Goggin, whose thick blond

says that there are only five
counter-tenors in the world.
