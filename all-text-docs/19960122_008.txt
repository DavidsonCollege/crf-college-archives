Pride or hatred _

Okay, it’s time fora little con-
troversy. The other day during a
class discussion on Southern na-
tionalism, the topic of the rebel
flag came up. My peers raised
solid points on both sides. I realize
the rebel flag is a symbol for the
Southern pride that Bob Bailey
eloquently summed up by saying,
“We're better fighters, we’re bet-
ter hunters, and we’re better lov-
ers.” I have no problems with
people taking pride in the South,
that’s not the issue. The question I
would like to address is whether
the rebel flag should still be used to
express this pride, especially in
public places.

During the 1950s and 60s the
rebel flag became a sign of hatred.
It’s meaning was perverted by rac-
ists who used it to taunt blacks and

voice their opposition to the
achievements of the civil rights
movement. As a result, the flag is
now extremely offensive to a large
number of people. It can no longer
be seen as merely a symbol of
pride, but also as

pride and nationalism for their
homeland. Some sick individuals,
however, perverted the meaning
of the swastika, using it to repre-
sent their anti-semitism. Many
people in Germany did not hate

instills fear into people when neo-
Nazi’s use the symbol to represent
their feelings of German national-
ism. I tend to see the rebel flag in
a similar light.

Now don’t get me wrong, I’ve

swastika was the

symbol of the Nazi party. For a
large portion of the German popu-
lation, the swastika and the Nazi
party symbolized their feelings of

Jews, just as many Southerners do
not hate blacks. The point, how-
ever, is that the swastika is now
seen as a symbol of hatred. _ It

do not think
that everyone who hangs a rebel
flag is a racist. I even think it was
wrong to take the Dukes of Hazard
off the air because some people

were offended by the stars and bars
displayed on the roof of the Gen-
eral Lee, My problem is with states
suchas South Carolina who started
to fly the flag over their capital in
the middle of the civil rights move-
ment. The flag was being used to
express their racist beliefs of seg-
regation.

There is no justifiable reason
why the flag should still be flying
over the state capital today. If
someone wants to display the flag _
in private places as an expression
of Southern pride then that’s okay,
but public displays of the rebel flag
ignore the feelings of a large num-
ber of people. Basically, people
should just be aware of the feelings
of hatred which the rebel flag rep-
resents and try to express their
pride in the South in other ways.

El Jefe rides
again

Well, we’re back from break
and officially in the swing of things
once again. By now dozens of
naked men will have streaked
through campus in subhuman
tempetatures, dozens, nay hun-
dreds, of women will have laughed
at those poor, shrivelled fools, and
the memories of Self-Selection
antics will join an elite list of ac-
tions that people will either boast
about or suppress for the rest of
their college terms.

So it’s back to the grind. With
no vacation in sight we return to
the hallowed halls of Chambers
and the puke green carpeting of the
‘braire. But before we hurl our-
selves headlong into the world’s
most demanding academic sched-
ule, let us take a few momments to
examine our fine institution and
ponder possibilities for its improve-
ment. During the snow storm over
the break when I was stuck in my
home with only bad reruns of Saved
by the Bell for entertainment, I had
plenty of time to think. So while
marooned in my winter wonder-
land I came up with a few sugges-
tions to improve this spiffy little
school. Now, I know many of you
have heard me start like this be-
fore, but this is not a list of com-
plaints. If I wanted to complain, I
would mention the continued crip-
pling of our campus cable T.V.
system, or mention the extraordi-
narily low number of electives of-
fered in the subjects I wish to
persue. No, these are genuine tips
for a better Davidson, so listen up.

First off, we need adjust the
dates of our Christmas break. For
people who live far away, getting
home before the 21 or 22 of De-
cember is tough. Such late arrivals
make gift buying extremely diffi-
cult considering the often over-
whelming influx of holiday activi-
ties that often flood the prodical

sons and daughters returning home
from college. When the folks are
shelling out $24,000 plus a year for
school and you stroll in the door
with a collection of assorted socks
from Target for Paw and a pair of
Revco clip-on ear rings for Maw, it
isn’t always a pretty sight. (Be
sure, when reading the article, to
pronounce “Target” properly—
that is to say, like “Tarjé,” which,
as you francophiles well know,
originates from the French word
“tarjelous” meaning: “to buy things
hurridly and carelessly as if in a
rush to avoid extreme conse-
quences,” This word should not be
confused with the more contempo-
rary English term, “Target,” which
describes something at which you
shoot or throw objects—a surly
freshman, for example.)

- Besides the gift buying crunch,
our lopsided break also creates
problems for those who wish to
work over the break. Most busi-
nesses usually need more help in
the weeks preceeding Christmas
and New Year’s Eve as opposed to
the dead periods afterward which
consume the majority of our win-
ter vacation. Let’s face it, there’s
just more money changing hands
during the holidays than in early
January when people spend most
of their time clearing arteries from
egg nog and debating about
whether or not the Christmas tree
would look good in the living room
year round.

I could ramble on, but you get
the point. Schedule people, I im-
plore you, listen to the masses—or
at least listen to me because the
masses are to lazy to say anything
themselves—fix winter break. If
not for me, a -poor futureless se-
nior, for the younger generation.
Do something’ for the children!
They’ reall we’ ve got left for God’s
sake!

Okay, moving on to a topic
that hits a little closer to home for
me. Something must be done about
the parking situation. These sneaky
freshmen that bring back cars after
Winter Break must be stop. Or
perhaps it is those culture-rich jun-
iors returning from abroad and
bringing their autos withthem. This
should not happen. I say, it’s either
culture or a car. You can’t have
both. If you leave the country, you
lose your parking priveleges for
the year. There is nothing worse
than sophisticated people behind
the wheel. They never yield,-and
they get all upset if your ‘81 Ford
happens nick their Lexus. And as
for those freshmen, they shouldn’t
even have cars. Part of the fresh-
men experience is kissing up to
upperclassmen for rides. It’s part
of life. We don’t make them wear
those beanie things on their heads
anymore. I realize that wouldn’t
fly in today’s world. The days of
general freshmen hazing are over,
but to take away all upperclassmen

-privelege is a crime. If freshmen

are going to have cars, then they
should be obligated to drive upper-
classmen to class on command.
Have you ever had to walk up that
hill from the apartments or “Down
the Hill?” It’s a workout. At least
give us golf carts. We’ll say one
per each side of each apartment
building and one for each half hall
in the sophmore dorms.

Think about it. Notonly would
golf carts promote unity as stu-
dents coordinate schedules and
cram onto the carts in a cuddly
collection of bonding, but if we
bought electric carts we would cut
down on the carbon monoxide lev-
els around Davidson, doing our
part to help the environment. Re-
cycling people, whoever you are, I
think you should jump on this band-
wagon A.S.A.P.

‘Stamp me:

Me cae ee ee ee

The past week has beena flurry
of Patterson Court activity. | It’s
just been a nonstop party here at
the Big D. Yet, there lurks an
environmental and financial atroc-
ity beneath this lively new year
merriment. Literally, this problem
is piling up under our feet. What is
it? Wristbands.

When are the people in charge
of this plastic shenanigan going to
realize that wristbands are not only
a complete waste of money but
also an environmental outrage?
Why can’t21-year-olds flash hand
stamps instead of our favorite ad-
justable bracelets? Most impor-
tantly, why is O’ Douls sponsoring
the most recent batches of Court
wristbands?

Personally, when I go to the
waterslide I don’t mind a little
color-coded plastic bracelet. When
I start wearing one on a regular
basis though I begin to feel like a
tagged shark.

No more! Judging by thenum-
ber of bands strewn all over cam-
pus (and the Pub floor), it’s clear
that there’s a waste problem. In
addition, seeing as though most
people are wearing long sleeves
this time of year, wristbands aren’t
that easy tospotimmediately. Hand
stamps, on the other hand, are much
more economical and landfill-
friendly.

Although some wasteful
people might share the opinion of
the senior quoted in the September
Sth issue of the Davidsonian, who
said she’d rather wear a disposable
wristband than a stamp that might
last for a couple of days, hand
stamps are definitely the way to
go.

Earlier in the fall, all party-
goers had to sport wristbands re-
gardless of age. Now that only 21-
year-olds and older have to iden-
tify themselves, why not return to
the old system of stamps?
