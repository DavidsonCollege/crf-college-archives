Beyond Davidson: International issues

By CAROL GATEWOOD ..
El Salvador--U.S. military per-
sonnel clashed with leftist El Sal-
vadoran guerrillas in a four hour
skirmish Tuesday in which at
Jeast sixtéen Salvadoran guerril-
las were killed. The fighting,
which resulted after rebels. at-
tacked a military base two weeks
ago, is the first to be acknowl-
edged since the Reagan admini-
stration sent military advisors to
El Salvador in 1981.

Warsaw--The outlawed Polish
labor union Solidarity which a
few weeks ago seemed to be gain-
ing ground in their plight for

government recognition is in
danger again due to the selection
of Miezyslaw Rakowski as the
new premier of the Communist
Party Central Committee.
Rakowski is noted for his aggres-
sive policy toward Solidarity and
is deeply distrusted by many Soli-
darity leaders. Chief organizer of
the movement Lech Walesa com-
ments on the choice of Rakowski,
“We hope he will come with a
willingness for reform which is
what this country needs.”

West Berlin--The Group of
Seven, the leading industrial
powers of the world, met to reaf-

firm their policy of stabilizing the
American dollar. This decision
was made in and effort to keep
financial markets calm before the
U.S. Presidential election. Ex-

perts do not think that the Policy ,

will succeed.

Moscow--General Secretary
Mikhail Gorbachev expressed
frustrations toward Soviet press
editors who have said that his
policies of glasnost and per-
estroika, designed to revitalize
the. Soviet Union, have faltered.
Gorbachev claimed the main
problem was “a gap between our
goals and our work.” He criticized

the editors for failing to support
his efforts in their publications.

On Friday, the U.S. and the
Soviet Union met to discuss fur-
ther nuclear arms control issues.
Reagan. and Schulz met with
Soviet Foreign Minister Shevard-
naze in ‘Washington and ex-
changed proposals. Officials
stated that limits on long range
nuclear warheads “aren’t immi-
nent.”

Last Thursday Soviet authori-
ties sent military troops to the
capital of Armenia in an effort to
control ethnic unrest. Azerbajanis
and Armanians have been clash-
ing over the territory of Nagano-
Karabaleh. Both groups claim the
territory as their own, and several
citizens have been injured in pro-
tests over the dispute. This has
been the most forceful move
taken by the Soviet Union since
conflict began in February.

Not Beyond Davidson: News from the town

By STAN HUMPHRIES

Davidson College students are apt to
forget that the institution is not all by itself
in this stretch of Mecklenburg County. In
fact, the college sits ina town with a history
as long as the college’s and happenings just
as, well, interesting.

Students missed the heated town discus-
sions that took place over the summer
concerning the new Davidson City Hall.
Discussions have now bogged down over
the color of brick that should be used, with
one faction advocating brown brick and the
other pushing for the already omnipresent
red brick.

One Davidson commissioner says that
this controversy is as big as arecent contro-
versy over the leash law in Davidson. As

town commissioner Randy Kincaid says,
“Everyone has an opinion on architecture,
just like everyone is an expert on dogs.”

The new funeral home in Huntersville
tried a novel concept by holding an open
house for the public which turned out to be
a great success. Although open for business
last spring, one previously had to have
unfortunate circumstances in order to get to
see inside.

For those with not much to do on a
Sunday afternoon (or those who are simply
incredibly morbid), the public tours were a
popular attraction featuring the 199 seat
chapel and the recording booth to record
the funeral for later listening. It was not
made clear why one would want to listen to
a funeral more than once.

A Charlotte woman allegedly went on a
demolition spree last Saturday in Davidson
and downtown Cornelius leaving mayhem
in her path. Altavia Phillips, at the helm of
her Ford, allegedly began by swerving
wide at an intersection on Main Street and
nailing a Dodge stopped at the light.

Not hesitating at all, Phillips allegedly
proceeded into Cornelius, where she rear-
ended another Dodge on Catawba Avenue.
She then allegedly backed into another car
while backing away from her first target.
She was then apparently forced to call.ita
day.

A population boom has hit area schools.
Huntersville and Cornelius elementary
schools report almost one hundred more
students than expected. Davidson Elemen-

ROTC cadets perform over summer

tary is behind the other schools, however,
with only six more students than expected.

Burger King is soon to open in Cornelius.
Macy’s and Saks Fifth Avenue are report-
edly waiting to see what color the city hall
will be before they finalize plans to open up
stores on Main Street.

A spaghetti supper for Davidson Ele-
mentary’s PTA is to be held on October 7.

Update on the region’s leadership:
Russell Knox continues as the town’s
long-time mayor with his brother, Joe
serving virtually as Mooresville’s mayor-
for-life.

As one Mooresville resident stated,
“Frankly, I can’t remember when Joe
wasn’t Our mayor.”

Many may remember Eddie Knox, for-
mer mayor of Charlotte and Rusty and
Joe’s brother, who ran for governor a while
back and learned than the Knox brothers’

For most Davidson students the
summer of ’88 will be remem-
bered as short, hotand dry. But for
twenty-one Davidson ROTC ca-
dets the summer was physically
demanding and mentally tough.
Fifteen seniors attended Ad-
vanced Camp at Fort Bragg,
North Carolina; two juniors at-
tended Basic Camp at Fort Knox,
Kentucky; two cadets attended
Airborne School at Fort Ben-
nings, Georgia; and two cadets
attended Air Assault School at
Fort Campbell, Kentucky.
Advanced Camp is mandatory
requirement for any cadet with
three years of ROTC experience.
The Davidsgn cadets who went to
Fort Bragg were seniors John
Black, Bob Davidson, Bill Dixon,
John Engel, John Fitzgerald,
Mark Harris, Ray Harshbarger,
~ Jeff Muir, Eric Peterson, John
Scherer, Sherb Sentell, Rick Sh-
eridan, Bill Sutton, Rufus Tim-
berlake, and Dave Trontz.
The camp’s objective is to de-
termine if these cadets have what
Colonel Diehl, Professor of Mili-
tary Science, calls the “right
stuff.” That “right stuff’ is deter-
mined through a rigorous and
demanding program which in-

cluded being scrutinized on six-
teen leadership dimensions (ini-
tiative, delegation, judgement,
etc.) and a minimum of twelve
opportunities to lead other cadets
in groups ranging from a squad to
a company.

The Advanced Camp at Fort
Bragg included 3,000 cadets from
two hundred universities and col-
leges ranging from Maine to
South Carolina. The Davidson
cadets performed “credibly”
against the other Eastern coast
schools with more than half of
them receiving a rating of “supe-
rior.”

However, for some cadets
Advanced Camp did not mark the
end of their military training. Five

Davidson students had a “golden

opportunity” to participate in

(CDLT). CDLT gave the cadet an y,

Peterson worked with basic
trainees at Fort Jackson; Black

the 82nd-Airbore at Fort Bragg;

portation platoon for the 82nd
Airborne; Scherer was an assis-

tant Signal platoon leader at Fort Gordon; and. Harshbarger
spent five weeks in Germany with a transportation unit.
CDLT allowed these five cadets to apply tactical and practi-
cal skills in a real world environment.

Basic Camp gave juniors Philip Brooks and Jamie McAden
the opportunity to cover the first two years of ROTC within
six weeks. Although the program was more skills than per-
formance oriented, both students were still evaluated on

leadership positions. Brooks re-
flecting back on the six weeks
said, “It is true about Basic Camp
that the two things you remember
are the gas chamber and the drill
sergeant. Other than that it was a
piece of cake.”

Two cadets, Sentell and sopho-
more Mike Peters, attended Air-
borne School. In a physically
rigorous program they both
learned the art of military para-
chuting. “The first jump was a
blur,” said Sentell, “because I was
falling at twenty-two feet a sec-,
