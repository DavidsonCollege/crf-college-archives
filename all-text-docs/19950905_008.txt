~ What is home?

What is “home?” This ques-
tion forced itself into dialogue dur-
ing this year’s orientation book
discussion. I left with it still in my
head, the skeleton of an answer
forming itself softly in my mind.

Perhaps, before Davidson, the
answer was very concrete. It was
the simple house in Columbia
where Spanish flew through the
air, and the animals were as hyper-
active as me. Then I left for col-
lege.

My freshman year book dis-
cussion was a painful attempt at
some conversation, some intelli-
gent dialogue. We sat around, late
Friday night, forcing ideas into
sentences. Never feeling shy and
hating the awkward quiet, I talked
incessantly about nothing that I
remember now. And then it hap-
pened. Nick Kallan looked me

dead in the face and said “I heard
about you. Your mom said you
talked a lot. She said I was bound
to meet you because you are so
loud and you talk so much.” My
“home” switched from a structure
to my family, and I immediately
felt betrayed.

The theory of “home” evolved
all of first semester. The first time
I went home, I walked from room
to room, I took in every change-
things as simple as a new micro-
wave stand, a new living room set
up. Change.

And everything continued to
change—as it should when you are
evolving. At Christmas, I went out
during the day with old friends and
talked to new friends on the phone
at night.

Sometimes it felt like I had

different faces, carefully put in-

place for each encounter. Friends
from home complained about oth-
ers who had “changed.” I fought
for their right to evolve, to adapt to
theirenvironment and become who
they must.

That Christmas I offended my
mother with my brave declaration
that I was going “home” in a few
weeks and that I was only visiting
my “home home” (the word my
freshmen hall developed to mean
where you were from prior to
Davidson). She stared back at me
and walked out of the room, prob-
ably thinking, “this too shall pass.”

‘I spent that summer In Con-
necticut putting children on horse-
back and teaching them to swim.
And it, too, became my home. It
became my home because I was
allowed to talk in my Southern
drawl, dance like a wild woman,

play like a child and be serious
when necessary. It became my
“home” because I allowed those
people to bring out what I felt was
the best in me.

Suddenly, home became much
more than a concrete building. At
Davidson, in the fall of my sopho-
more year, home was the green
chairs waiting in my small down-
the-hill room. Rejects from the
“Sanford and Son” era, they housed
my roommate and I through every
moment.

Home became the cars we took
on road trips and the restaurants
we crashed at four in the morning
in the midst of some educational or
personal crisis. Home became the
water tower on a dark, brave night
and the lawn of our residence halls
in the brilliant sunshine. For some
of us, home became our athletic

_fields or performance halls. For all

of us, it has become some distinct
place, some distinct face and some
distinct time.

Perhaps, then, home is an es-
sence. The essence that brings out
the very best in you. The essence
that allows you to evolve, change,
redirect and still be you.

For those of you just begin-
ning—or still looking—I hope that
Davidson becomes your home.
And for those of us who are wind-
ing down our time here, I hope we
all remember that with “home”
comes an obligation. A sense of
responsibility in doing whatis right,
in providing the proper care and
upkeep, in serving as we have been
served. This truth is for our
“homes” that are places, that are
moments, and most importantly,
that are people.

these our days

The only thing constant is
change.” This phrase has become a
cliche whose mildly paradoxical
implications seem to escape us all
too often. Perhaps it is not that we
are generally unaware of the change
taking place around us but that we
are unaware of our involvement in
it, blinded in part by the mind clos-
ing routiness of daily living, the
streamlined and systematic way of
life we have found for ourselves.

We are college men and
women, allegedly at the peak of
our fervor, our excitability, our
political passion, and so forth. We
are impressionable, relatively open

. minded, and young. Yet we are
already beginning as a generation
to accept the growing impression
that Davidson College, the United
States, and the world are all stag-
nant places.

Still, we go about business as
usual. What’s more scary is that
this outlook seems to be self-pro-
ductive; its acceptance promotes
stagnancy itself.

So we are not in Paris during

the French Revolution, or
Jeruslaem following Christ around,
orin New Yorkin 1969. Jean-Paul
Sartre, in a digression from the
pessimism typified by his existen-
tialism, wrote that “there may have
been greater times, but this is not
ours.” And ours is not his either. It
is ours: We ownit, inasense. We
are to make our time what it will
become, and for what it will for-
ever be known. The implication of
this, believe me, is as reassuring as
itis frightening.

It is frightening because, to
freshmen, this is a role they may
not have expected to play, and to
the rest of us because it is arole we
have been playing for one, two,
three, or more years and haven’t
been aware of it. It is reassuring,
though, because if understood
deeply, it can lead to a sense of
purpose in your four years at this
institution of higher learning. Like

’ all others, this purpose can only be
fulfilled if grasped at its core. So
find your niche before you’ re his-

tory.

Beer past midnight!

What is the deal with this new
alcohol policy? For the most part,
parties continue to function as they
did last year, but a few minor dif-
ferences have gotten under my and
many of my fellow
upperclassmen’s skin.

I understand the need for most
of the changes, and I think the new
system will eventually work itself
out smoothly. The wrist bands are
an annoying but clever and neces-
sary solution to the liability prob-
lem. However, afew changes have
proven irritating.

In particular, a change insti-
tuted this year is the reduced hours
of serving on weekdays. Why, if
North Carolina State Law permits
the distribution of beer until two
a.m., do Davidson parties cut off
the taps at twelve, midnight? Is
this some lame attempt by the ad-
ministration to make us go to bed
earlier? Do professors think bleary
eyed students in morning classes
will disappear if the beer ceases to

flow at midnight? After observing
the situation in the two weekday
parties that have already occurred,
I can tell you this is not the case.
No one at this college even shows
up at a court party until at least
eleven o’clock. When the beer
stops at twelve, during the height
of the celebration, very few people
will simply toss out their Solo cup
and stroll home to bed.

From what I’ve seen, large
groups of ambitious revellers are
always creative enough to uncover
an alternate location and source
for partying. Many decide that the
midnight limit on beer justifies a
trip out to The Pub, or one of the
areas many other fine alcohol-serv-
ing establishments. Many simply
take the party back to their dorms

and apartments, waking up others:

and escaping the limits of the court.
When people want to blow off
steam they will find a way. Don’t
kid yourself by thinking a gradu-
ally receding limit on beer will

significantly change anything.

When Davidson accepts anew
class each year the prospective stu-
dents go through a rigorous appli-
cation process designed to deter-
mine not only the students’ aca-
demic merit but their personality,
moral character, and responsibil-
ity level. Why not let the students
exercise the judgement and intelli-
gence that each and every one in-
variably possesses. Davidson kids
are smart, and they are generally
ambitious.

People here know when they
can and cannot spare the time to go
to a party. Limiting weekday par-
ties and strangling the beer flow at
midnight are administrative insults
to the responsibility and common
sense of every Davidson student. I
ask the men and women in charge
not to be patronizing but to realize
that, though we are young and en-
ergetic, we are also wise enough to
handle ourselves. Give us some
credit,
