Wins First Game By Close Score |The Dietrics Furnish the Last Ly- Social and Pcrsonal Items About

But Loses Second.

Davidson opened her baseball season
for 1917 on last Wednesday atternoon
by defeating Oak Ridge by the score of
9 to 8. A large crowd was present and
christened the new grandstand on Sprunt
Field. ‘ho the weather was a little
too cool for fast ball, the game was ex-
citing thruout and the close score gave
the spectators many thrills.

‘The score see-sawed back and torthr,
Davidson being in the lead at one time
and Oak Ridge another. Oak Ridge
tied the score in the opening of the ninth,
and an extra inning contest seemed im-
minent, but the Red and Black soon
managed to send a man across with the
deciding run.

“Doty” Pharr played a good game at
first for Davidson, besides getting three
hits off the opposing pitchers. McMil-
lan at center also played good ball and
scored two runs. Hengeveld and Law-
sen worked in the box for the Red and
Black, and both were in good form for
an opening game.

For Oak Ridge, Barnes did the best
playing, striking out nine men, getting
two hits, and scoring three runs, Burrus,
in center field, also put up a good game
for the visitors. Line-up:

ceum Attraction.

The sixth and last attraction in the

local Lyceum series was presented Jasi
Saturday night in Shearer Hall. when
the Dietrics gave .a delighttul progran
ot magic and music. It was probably
the best of the whole course, and interest
was ata maximum thruout the cnter-
tainment.
. The first part of the program was
taken up with tricks of magic by Mr.
Dietric, interspersed with witty remarks
and playing on words that kept the audi-
ence in laughter. His tricks were all
good and mystifying.

Mrs. Dietri¢ furnished the second
part of the program with her whistling.
singing and pantomimes. Her imperson-
ation of a small boy at a moving picture
show and the playing of “The Wedding
March" as it would be done by a con-
ceited young lady and by one gifted with
the art of ragtime weré especially yood.

The last: part. of the entertainment
was musical in character, Mir. and
Mrs. Dietric playing popular and clas-
sical selections on novelty musical in-
struments. “May Bells” was played on
the chimes. and then a Spanish selection
“Senora,” was played on the banjo by
Mr. Dietric, accompanied by — tam-

.;bourine, piano. and whistling ot Mrs.

Dietric, all at the same time. Scottish
melodies on the bells and “The Amer-
ican Patrol” on the xylophone were wel’
received, and as.a finale, Mr. Dietric
played on the xylophone selections trow
“Mauretania,” “Poet and Peasant,”
“Bohemian Girl.” “Faust.” and) othe:
operas.

MEDALS AWARDED IN
FRESH-SOPH DECLAMATION

The Fresh-Soph Declamation final-
were held in’ Shearer Hall Monday
night. ‘The three “rep” men from each
society spoke for the medal given by
their respective societies. ‘The declama
tions were unusually good both in de-
livery and in the subject matter.

The representatives of the Eumenean
Society gave the following declamations:
A. §. Potts, “Lasca;” R. A. McGirt,
“Loyalty to Country ;” and L. C. Brand,
“The Thunder Storm.” Those from
the Philanthropic Society were: W. M.
Currie, “The Maid of Orleans;” R. D.
Hall, “Address to the Old Confeder-
ates:” and J. L. Maddry, “Address to
the Democratic Convention.”

The speeches were varied and so well
given that it was difficult to select the
best speakers. After much balloting the
judges, Dr. T. M. Douglas and Profes-
sors J. L. Douglas, Wood, Reed and
Currie, decided to award the medals to
Potts. of the Eumenean, and Hall. of
the Philanthropic Society.

Red and Black Defeat
Charlotte Leaguers

Game Won By Rally After Bad
Start.

In a comparatively fast game — las:
Saturday. the Red and Black nine de
feated the Charlotte League team by the
score of 6 to 4. Both reams played hard.
ind with the exception of the first. few
innings, when the Davidsen team made
numerous errors, the game was very in
teresting.

Charlotie led off with three in the
initial frame, by virtue of miscues of the
Davidson infield and muffs of her out
fielders. Neither team scored after this
vatil the chird, when Charlotte put an-
other run across. tn this same inning.
Davidson started things, and after Law-
son had walked. Tohnson reached first
onanerror and Wood beat out a bunt,
filling the bases. ‘Then Jack Black came
across with a stnele, and Lawson and
Tohnson scored. Wood soon after scored
the third run on McMillan's | sacrifice
flv to center.

Both teams changed pitchers in’ the
fifth inning, Geary goine in for Char-
lotte, while Worth went in for David-
son, “The latter pitched an excellent
game during the three innings be work
ed. Tn the last half of the sixth the Red
and Black made two more runs. Me-
Kinnon, first up, led off with a three-
hareer to right. Pharr and = Worth
walked, with Keesler being put out. be-
tween the two. Johnson scored Me-
Kinnon and Worth with a hit that was
fumbled by a Charlotte player.

Tn the beginning of the seventh, both
sides again changed pitchers, Frv and
Withers being substituted by Charlotte
and Davidson, respectively. Davidson
