THE DAVIDSONIAN

Piisiiiess As A Life
Work Discussed By
Charlotte Speakers

All Stress Need of Application
and Experience

Mr. J. H. Carson of Charlotte was the
fourth speaker in a series of talks ar-
ranged by the “YMCA” on various phases
of business as a life work. Mr. Carson
spoke at the “Y" rooms on Thursday
night, his subject being Real Estate.

Real Estate is one of the many busin-
esses fast approaching the professional
stage. Courses are being offered in sev-
eral schools dealing with the subject,
which are designed to prepare the student
for Real Estate as a life work. Mr. Car-
loking into the future, — predicted
that the day is not far distant when real
estate will be as much a profession, re-
quiring professional training, as medi-
cine, law or engineering. To enter the
real estate business a young man should

son,

be possessed of four outstanding quali-
ties. First of all he must be red-blooded.
By red-blooded we mean a clean thinker,
a clean liver and a clean talker. Then
he must have courage, he must be honest
and he must possess imagination. The
man with these qualities is fairly certain
to succeed in the real estate business.

Real estate has often been placed in
an unfavorable light by booms and land
swindles, are very unfortunate
things which the good real estate man
does his to avoid. Conditions in
Florida very clearly illustrate the evil
results the boom. Such conditions
pave the way for the professional swind-
ler and as a result the real estate business
comes in for its share of abuse. It is true
that there are many opportunities for the
crook, but under normal conditions a
man cannot be crooked and stay in real
estate long. The public will find him
out, or the true real estate man never
misrepresents a property. Real Estate
Boards are being organized throughout
the country for the purpose of driving out
the dishonest man. All the best real es-
tate men are members of these boards, re-
quirements for membership in which are
very high. A certain code of business
ethics must be followed by its members
or they are expelled and by this method
the board hopes to elevate the business to
a higher plane. The importance of real
estate as a business cannot be overlook-
ed, for over one half of the total wealth
of the United States is said to be real
estate.

Leach Presented Banking

On Tuesday night, March 5, Mr. Hugh
Leach of the Federal Reserve Bank
Branch of Charlotte presented banking as
a life’s Vocation to an interested group
of students at.the Y rooms.

Mr. Leach gave a very general explana-
tion of the different classes of banks and
their. functions and also interesting in-
formation on the internal functioning of
the Federal Reserve System, a field that
Mr. Leach is well acquainted with.

Typical of all the business men who
addressed Davidson students during the
business week of the Vocational Guidance
Institute, Mr. Leach urged the application
of knowledge acquired in college to a per-
iod of practical training, even at a finan-
cial loss, before entering the banking field
candiate for executive positions.
He especially endorses experience as an
assistant to a bank examiner.

Following the address Mr. Leach was
subjected to the questioning of his au-
dience, with chief interest in the

McCullough on Accounting
“Education is valueless unless applied
to an object”, said Mr. D. H. McCollough
of the McCollough firm of Certified Pub-
lic Accountants of Charlotte in an address
to prospective accountants at the Y rooms
Tuesday night, March 5.

Mr. McCollough impressed upon his
audience the value of an education if ap-
plied to an object early in the school
career and pursued with the intention of
gaining something applicable tq his fu-
ture. Otherwise it is valueless.

From his own experience Mr. McCol-
lough urged a year of practical experience
and then specialization in some particular
field of accounting with the idea in mind
of becoming an authority in that field.
This, he explained, is in line with the
present day mergers and nationalization
of business units.

F UND SUFFICIENT
FOR UNIFORM CAPS

It has become definitely known that

enough money has been raised by those
backing the band uniform campaign to
provide caps for each member of the
organization. Since the beginning of this
movement under the direction of Capt.
Elkins, the fund has had a steady growth
and though a great deal of work is yet
to be done before the uniforms will be
complete, it is reasonably safe to state
that by the opening of the football season
next fall, the band will be fully equipped
with caps and capes. It is estimated that
around fifteen hundred dollars will be the
total cost of the complete outfit which
will include and

To Country Church

Last Sunday the Christian [Endeavor

ful deputation at the Mallard Creek Pres-
byterian Church, in the vicinity of David-
son,

The program rendered by the Davidson
men consisted of a short song and devo-
led by Bill McGavock,
member of the Junior Class. Three talks
were given, T. R. Nunan spoke on the
subject of “Dwight L. Moody,” H. FE.
Russell on “Florence Nightengale,” S.
S. Wiley on “David Livingston.” C. C.
Orr and P. B. Fry rendered special music.

The meeting was attended by a large
crowd and very encouraging interest was
shown by everyone. These deputations
are sent out each Sunday, and F. D.
Poag, president of the C. E. T. C. urges
that students interested in Christian work
take part in the Training Class activi-
ties.

A Timely Lyric
From a vacation letter in the -Chi-
cago Tribune:
Little bankroll, cre we part,
Let me hug you to my heart.
All the year I’ve clung to you,
I've been faithful, you’ve been true.
Little bankroll, in a day
You and I wilt start away
To a gay and festive spot—
I'll come home, but you will not.

Their duties are by no means confined
to preaching. A chaplain may often be
found in the front lines: distributing cig-
arettes or chocolate, in the hospitals or
aid stations, or possibly visiting the pris-
oners of war. They are of great value as
advisors of recruits, in making wills, or
in the identification of dead or wounded
soldiers. The chief position of a chap-
lain, however, is as a servant of the peo-
ple, just like any other minister.

Wilmington Pastor

Rev. A. D. P. Gilmour, pastor of the

Sunday, March 17.. Dr. Gilmour is well-
known on the compus and among church
officials throughout the state. He was
graduated from Hampden-Sydney Col-
lege and afterwards finished at the Union
Theological Richmond,
where he received the Doctor of Divinity
degree. Dr. Gilmour, to
Wilmington, held the pastorate of the
First Presbyterian Church in) Spartan-
burg, S.C. He is known and loved by
literally hundreds of people in North and
South Carolina, and Davidson is indeed
fortunate to have him speak Sunday even-
ing.

Tothe Owner of Rented

Your ordinary FIRE insurance will
not fully protect your interest, when
fire wholly or partly destroys your
rented property.

Where are you to get money to pay
taxes and fixed expenses, pending re-

rent income?

You need RENT INSURANCE to
pay the rents you lose due to that prop-
erty’s untenantability.
