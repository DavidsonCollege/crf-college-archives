Wilder attacks mystery genre alone

By PATRICK COVINGTON
Staff Writer
One of the uniting factors between

Mel Brooks’ two latest films, Blazing \J

Saddles and Young Frankenstein, has
been the presence of Gene Wilder,

both as performer and writer. Now.

Wilder has gone out on his own,
attacking the mystery genre with The
Adventure of Sherlock Holmes’
Smarter Brother.

Comparisons between this and
Brooks’ two films are inescapable,
and Wilder’s film is in many ways
superior to both Blazing Saddles and
Young Frankenstein.

As a satirist of movie genres,
Brooks has had mixed success: Blaz-
ing Saddles was ostensibly a parody
of westerns, yet the stereotyped

western structure Brooks set up often.

seemed little more than a showcase
for a general sample of Brooks’
humor; the gags were not generated
by the western movie genre but rather
by Brooks outside of genre.

In Young Frankenstein he was
more successful at getting ‘‘inside”’
his subject; the jokes were easier to
laugh at because they came more from
the excesses of the horror movie style
(familiar to all the viewers) than from
the bizarre (and often crude) recesses
of Brooks’ mind.

The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes’
Smarter Brother bears a closer resem-
blance to the latter film with another
improvement, for Wilder, who wrote
and directed the film as well as
starring in it, uses the camera not
merely to record his jokes, but often
to elaborate them.

The camera work, supervised by
Gerry Fisher, plays a much more
active and creative part in the film, a
result, perhaps, of Wilder’s broader
experience in working with film. The
sword of Sigerson Holmes’ vanq-
uished foe is shown lying in'a puddle
in the street; the camera works
through a maze of grotesque props in
filming the climactic sword fight in
the opera house; small things by
themselves, but together they add
greatly to the film.

SHERLOCK HOLMES’
SMARTER BROTHER

The plot centers around a valuable
document stolen from the home of the
foreign minister Lord Redcliffe. Sher-
lock Holmes (played by Douglas
Wilmer, who has created the same
role for BBC-TV) is assigned to
recover the document, and he decides

to use his zealous younger brother,
Sigerson (Wilder) as a decoy.
Sigerson and his friend Orville
Sacker (Marty Feldman) get further
entangled through their association
with a singer named Jenny (Madeline
Kahn), who, as it turns out, has a

tradition of his big brother, including

very special interest in the case.

Hclmes and Sacker’s search brings
them in touch with, among others, a
wild opera singer hamed Gambetti
(Dom DeLouise), and, in the end, the
dastardly Dr. Moriarty himself (Leo
McKern).

In the interim Sigerson gets himself
involved in hilarious predicaments at
the homes of Redcliffe and Gambetti,
and on stage in an opera house during
the last act of Verdi’s A Masked Ball,
a scene which has to be one of the
most thorough demolitions of opera
on the movie screen since the Marx
brothers.

The performances are almost all
excellent. Wilder’s Sigerson is a
defiantly self-confident figure who is
enraged at his own gullibility. Wilder
has a special gift for making the
characters he plays human in a likable
way: he brings across their often
frustrating attempts to improve
themselves in such a sincere fashion
that the audience can feel comfortable
with them; the viewer finds. himself
laughing almost as a type of encour-
agement.

His script for Sherlock Holmes
gives Madeline Kahn her best role
since Paper Moon. Her roles in the
Brooks films were funny but were
shallow; her role here is again
essentially comic but at least there are
shades in the comedy that she can
delineate and work with.

Feldman and DeLouise have roles
that cater to their special brands of
wildness and they perform well.

Leo McKern’s Moriarty is also
wild, but in the early parts of the film
he seems to be straining a bit more
than the others. By the end of the
film, however, he has settled into his
part nicely. —

The film is short (about an hour and
a half) and this works to its advan-
tage as none ot the gags are over-
worked. It is a bit episodic and
disconnected, but the laughs in the
various scenes make up for this. In
short, it seems clear that Gene Wilder
doesn’t need Mel Brooks or anybody
else to help him create a funny movie.
He is very good on his own. __
