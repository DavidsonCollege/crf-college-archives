Last week, we got off
on a tangent and look-
ed at some of the con-
traversial aspects of
the interfraternity
sports’ situation—now,
there are several other
related irems that we
would like to get off
our chest.

Since last week,
Coach Whittle has in-
dicated that a meeting
will be enlled in the
next few wecks of fra-
ternity representatives
to make plans for the
athletic program for
next year. This is certainly a step in the right direction, but
only the surface will have been seratched.

Specifically, we are referring to the crying need of these
same representatives getting their heads together and drafting
some definite set of rules for each different sport, checking over
the point system, making provisions necessary to assure that
adequate officiating will be provided for all games, and per-
haps most important of all—formulating a crack-proof set of
eligibility rules for participation by varsity men, numeral win-
ners, or men out for a sport during the time in which the fra-
ternity sport is being played. All of these proposals should be
printed and distributed to each fraternity, and in addition, it
might not be a bad idea to post them in each dormitory and
print them in the Davidsonian. Thus, every logical medium would
have been utilized in an effort to publicize the regulations to
every student.

These aforementioned weaknesses in the program this year
caused many criticisms and ill-feelings, and every one of them
is avoidable if proper aétions are taken. We are in full sym-
pathy with the criticism that fraternities have brought to us
during the year and asked us to air in this column. Let’s look
at some of the things that did happen or might conceivably hap-
pen if corrective actions aren’t taken.

« Take for instance the touch football rounds. Indecision
_ or uncertainty on the part of the officials have turned many
would-be wins into losses for teams that deserved to win. In
one very important game last year, one fraternity was ‘jilted”’
out of a win because the official moved the ball back to the
18-vard line to start the downs after the team had penetrated
within almost certain TD range as the result of a long pass.
Of course, every team has suffered, so they say, as a result of
faulty officiating, but it is unnecessary. If the official has made

n decision the way he saw it, there should be no complaint; if,|~

however, on the other hand, ignorance of the pertinent rules
prompted him to make such a decision, then there is no excuse.
Absolute familiarity with all the rules, and attendance in
classes conducted by members of the coaching staff—which we
have long advocated—should be requisites of all officials‘ in
any sport.

Then there is the ancient question of playing ineligible
men. Fortunately, most of the fraternities have abided by the
rules to the best of their knowledge—or were forced to abide
by them due to the alertness of other fraternities. Some men
who are out for varsity sports, but failed to make the starting
team, have skipped practice on days when their fraterntiy had
a game in order to play with them. Along the same line, is it
fair for freshmen who made their numerals in cross-country to
he eligible for participation in the interfraternity track meet in
Spring? A simple set of rules governing this matter could be
drawn up in fifteen minutes time.

We don’t believe that all the trouble can be attributed to
the powers-that-be in the athletic department. There have been
attempts to familiarize the fraternities with existing rules and

Goodpasture Posts His Best Time In 100, 220

Davidson's strong  tracksters
turned tose all their power Wed-
nesday afternoon and gave Wake
Forest’s Demon Deacons a 100 2-3-
30 1-3 shellacking on Richardson
Field in a Conference track meet
marking the third win for Pete
Whittle's thin clads against a lone
defeat this year.

The laurels were all for David-
son Wednesday, as the Deacons
could amass only one first place,
and that in the:mile relay against
a Davidson combination not as
strong as it could have been since
Whittle was giving as many boys
as possible a chance to run. On the
other hand, the Wildcats amassed
the other 14 firsts in soaring past
the century mark for the second.
time this year.

The outstanding individual per-
formances for the Cats were turn-
ed in by Ken Goodpasture and
Tommy Haller. Goodpasture took
firsts in both sprints, covering the
100 yard dash in a lightning fast
9.9 for the best performance of the
day. This was the first time Good-
pasture has ever broken 10 flat in
a meet, and will make Conference
sprinters take notice of a new star
in their field. Haller, the Presby-

terians jack of all trades, took 2
firsts and a tie for second to amass
11 1-3 points to be the Cats high
scorer again.

The best race of the day was the
440. Bill Klein, Bruce Ballenger,
and Dick Stockton put on a real
show for the crowd racing in to a
close finish. Klein edged out in
front at the tape while Ballenger
and Stockton ended in a dead heat
for second.

Jim Vann returned to form
again and took the discus with a
hefty heave of 140° 10” as Blake
Bradley, Bob Long and Dave An-
derson, Tom Stockton, Bill Prit-
chett, Bob Sharpe, Dave Williams,

through for firsts in their special-

Harding High School
Tops Wildkittens In
Two Arc-Light Games

By JIM FARRAR

The Davidson Frosh dropped
two games to Harding High School
of Charlotte this week. Both games
were played at night at Richard
Field at Harding. The Tuesday
game was a real thriller, with both
teams playing very good ball.

Harding jumped to a two to
nothing lead in the first inning on
a walk and a pair‘of hits. David-
son got back in the gante with a
run in their half of the third and
another one in their half of the
sixth. Harding got a run in the
last of the seventh. In the top half
of the ninth, the Frosh were behind
3 to 2. In this inning Morrow lead
off and struck ‘out, Whisnant
doubled down the left field line,
and “Hip” Cathey singled him
home on a grass-cutter through
second. Farrar walked, and that
was all for Dixon who pitched bril-
liant ball for Harding. “Yankee”
Eastman met Ballard, the new
Harding portside hurler with a
single through the box. Cathey
came home on the hit, and Far-
rar scored on a bad throw to the
third baseman. Reese and Elliott
struck out to end the inning. Going
into the last half of the ninth, Da-
vidson was nursing a S-3 lead. How-
ever, Harding and the umpire came
back against Eastman in a big

way. Lee Singled for Harding,

Cook and Parnell walked. With the

bases loaded, the pitcher hit into

a fielders choice at the plate. Then
came the disaster. Joe White caught

a high inside pitch and drove it
over left fielder Cathey’s head

with a victory over Cincinnati’s No.
1 man, Thomas, in sets of 6-0, 6-3,
and Whit Cobb, playing No. 3 for
the Davidsonians, won in sets of
6-2, 6-0 from Tualey. Allan Strand
took his match from Cincinnati’s
Gilbert by 6-1, 6-2 scores. Rob Pal-
mer continued playing his fine
brand of tennis by beating Yeager
of Cincinnati in sets of 6-2, 6-1.
Allen Fanjoy lost Davidson's only
singles match in bowing to Grose
of Cincinnati, 6-2, 2-6, 7-9, and
Teddy Keesler, playing No. 2 for
Davidson, overcame his opponent,
Ogel, in sets of 6-0, 6-3.

Teddy Keesler and Allan Fan-
joy, playing the No. 1 doubles po-
sition for Davidson, dropped their
match to Thomas and Ogel of Cin-
cinnati in sets of 4-6, 6-3. Allan
Strand and Dewey Keesler regain-
ed winning form for the Davidson-
ians with a 6-4, 6-2 victory over
Cincinnati’s number 2 double team
of Gilbert and Gross. Davidson's
Bill Childs and Peyre Kennedy lost
to Cincinnati’s Qualey and Mault
in sets of 1-6, 6-4, 6-4, to close out
the match.

Saturday afternoon the Wildcats
play a long-awaited match with the
Tar Heels of the University of
North Carolina, Carolina has beat-
en Davidson by scores of 5-4 for
the last 2 years, and a win over
the undefeated Carolinians would
possibly bring the State Champion-"
ship to Davidson, so look for a
real battle Saturday afternoon.
