He Is Distinguished : as Lawyer and
Civil Worker as Well as Coach

cause of Illness in Speaker’s
Family

March 21 is the date set for Athletic Night,
held annually in Chambers Auditorium, accord-
ing to Captain Pritchett, athletic director, who
has received a wire from Colonel Dan E. Mce-
Gugin, the chief speaker of the event. On March
it was learned that Athletic Night would
be indefinitely postponed due to much illness
in the noted colonel’s household. It was impos-
sible for him to keep his former engagement
as Mrs. McGugin and one of his sons were sick
with influenza, while Dan McGugin, Jr., had
éontracted pneumonia. The date is now defi-
nitely settled for Monday, however,
something equally as serious intervenes.

Colonel McGugin not only holds the position
of President Athletic Director at Vanderbilt |
University, but is distinguished as being the |
Dean of Southern Coaches. His widespread |
fame, which is so familiar to us at present, is
the climax of an eventful background.

man. In addition to his athletic honors he holds
other distinctions. Being one of Nashville's lead-
ing lawyers and civic workers, he is much in
demand as a speaker. He also holds the rank
of colonel on the government staff.

procedure there will be an address by the guest- |
speaker of the occasion. Then the singing of |
“College Ties” will bring the annual Athletic
Night to a close.

Davidson President
Talks at New Bern

“Christians themselves, for fear of sectarian-
ism, have taken the study of the Bible from
our public schools, and as a result we are rear-
ing a generation that knows nothing about our
Bible teachings,” declared Dr. Walter I

Monday afternoon at the First Presbyterian
Church in New Bern, N. C., sponsored by the

Craven County Ministerial Association. He was

banquet of Davidson alumni from various parts
of that section Monday night at the Presby-

Mrs. Lingle and their daughter,

Speaking on “The Bible in Our Schools,”

Miss Louise

Dr. Lingle in'his afternoon address urged that |

children be given some religious instruction.
He told of three plans in successful operation:
one by which money for the employ of Bible
teachers was raised by public patrons in co-

operation with the schools which furnished time |

and school rooms for the instruction;

day'for religious instruction under trained Bible

teachers at/their respective churches; and the |

third by which Bibfical courses were given at
the schools by the regular teachers, without
compulsion on the part of the pupils or sec-
tarianism on the part of the teachers.

“We need to haveemoral and religious ideals
set before our children,” asserted Dr. Lingle.

the Bible and its teachings, is growing up dif-

Debating Team News

A negative debating team composed
of Ed Kuykendall and Pete Knox has
had three meets during the past week.
The meets were with Florida, Birming-
ham Southern, and Emory University.
The debates with Florida and Birming-
ham Southern were non-decision. Dav-
idson won over Emory University, 2 to
1 in a three-judge decision.

The boys should be congratulated
and should be very proud of their win
over Emory. Emory does not go in for
any of the major sports and concen-
trate most of their time to debating.
They have been the Southern Cham-
pions forthe past two years, and their
teams are known far and wide. This
is the first time that Davidson has won
