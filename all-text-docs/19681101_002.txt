An Insurance Policy

Ralph Ellison’s pitiful performance
in chapel last week left many students
and faculty members wondering how
the distinguished Reynolds Lecture-
ship program could sponsor such a
poor speaker.

It was obvious Ellison hadn’t both-
ered to prepare, and his “lecture”
turned into a rambling hodge-podge
of “er’s’ and “uh’s’” that at least a
dozen professors acquainted with his
topic could have matched, without
charge.

Unprepared lectures like Ralph Elli-
son’s hurt the Reynolds program, a
program that has brought a number of
outstanding men to Davidson since it
was launched in 1959, and steps
should be taken to ensure that it

doesn't happen again.

One effective insurance policy has
been suggested hy a member of the
English Department. If the Reynolds
Foundation itself were to publish the
lectures, the professor says, no man
with any. kind of pride and concern
for professional reputation would
dare step to the podium without hav-
ing done his homework.

Publication of the lectures (which,
incidentally, is a policy followed by
some other schools) would have other
benefits as well. It would get the name
of the college around more, and pub-
licize the program and lecturer, too.

If we don’t try this, of course, then
we run the risk of another barrage of
“er’s” and “uh’s” from the next Rey-
nolds Lecturer.

Self-Scheduling Exams

The days of pallid faces and sunk-
en, bloodshot eyebalis during exam
period may have passed.

A subversive proposal to undermine
the moral fiber of Davidson will be
submitted next week to the Commit-
tee on Educational Planning. The
proposal would allow students to set
up their own exam schedules.

The adoption of this proposal could
have grave consequences. The ex-
quisite torture of the exam process is
at the heart of the process by which
Davidson builds men.

To face organic and humanities in
one day with Malcolm Lester on deck
for the next morning takes courage,
it takes the will to win, it takes grit.

Oh, sure the present system may

not be a fair test of a student’s know-
ledge. It may cause a few minor ner-
vous breakdowns. But Davidson’s aca-
demic “boot camp” must have virtues.

One good argument against the self-
scheduled exams is the opportunity for
cheating. Maybe Davidson students
are just not mature enough for this
change. Just because Mary Baldwin
can do it doesn’t mean we can.

Another horrifying aspect of the
proposal is that it may even be readied
in time to replace the ordeal scheduled
for the end of this term. Things don’t
usually move that fast here, but new-
fangled ways of doing things may even
deny us one last inquisition.

Oh, please don’t throw us in that
briar patch.

Some Honesty On ‘Dixie’

The flap over whether or not to
play “Dixie” is so silly we hate to
dignify it by dragging it into print,
but there are a couple. of points that
need to be made nonetheless.

In the first place, to all but a very
few “Dixie” is just a rousing fight
song ‘to be played at athletic events.
If it has always had special appeal to
Southern people, it is because of its
lively beat and the pride in this sec-
tion it evokes.

But that is all it is. To say that
“Dixie” connotes the Old South and
slavery and Ku Kluxers is utterly
ridiculous. And to believe it is even
more ridiculous.

Yet there are apparently a few
people here in each category, accord-
ing to the athletic coaches who re-
quested that the Pep Band quit play-
ing the song.

Those very few overzealous and

About That

From The Chapel Hill Weekly

A Townsman who questions our
sanity from time to time marched in
last week and without so much as a
howdy-do demanded to know “What
good is a newspaper editorial endorse-
ment of a political candidate?”

We thought long and hard and
finally decided to be honest. “No good
at all.’

“Well, why do you do it?”
“Sometimes it helps to plug a hole.”
“Why don't you just throw in an-
other cartoon?”

“That would be cheating.”
“Cheating who?”

‘The readers, of course.”

“} think ['d like to be cheated for

super-sensitive people would do well
to listen to some wise words from
Honest Abe Lincoin. No man more
than he wanted harmony between
North and South and black and white,
but on the day after Appomattox,
there he was on the White House
ste s, asking some band to play
¢ ie.”

“I have always thought ‘Dixie’ one
of the best tunes I ever heard,” old
Abe told a happy Northern crowd. “1
had heard that our adversaries over
the way had attempted to appropriate
it. I insisted yesterday that we had
fairly captured it. I presented the
question to the Attorney General and
he gave his opinion that it is our law-
ful prize. I ask the band to give us a
good turn upon it.”

_ The next thing you know somebody
will be asking for a ban on “The Bat-
tle Hymn of the Republic.”

Endorsement

a while.”

“Actually, sometimes we try to help
a candidate by not endorsing him.
Like Bobby Morgan. His politics are
rotten a lot of the time and he’s one
of that East Carolina College crowd.
But he’s a fine fellow personally, fair
and honest, and we. want to see him
elected Attorney General. So we were
going to write him a letter and ask
him whether he’d rather have The
Weekly come out for him or against

m

‘What did he say?”

“We never got around to writing
the letter.”

“Well, I wish you’d go ahead and
endorse Nixon.”

“You for Nixon?”

“No, ’m for Humphrey myself.”

It Takes Two, Baby

If you’re the kind to keep tabs on
such things, add another to that grow-
ing list of schools thinking coed.

This time it’s Sweet Briar, an all
girls’ school in Virginia with a respec-
table academic standing and a repu-
tation for being a good place to get
a date.

A couple of weeks ago a Founder's
Day speaker there mentioned the ad-
vantages of coeducation, warning that
“institutions that do not go coed in
the near future will soon lose compe-
tition for students, faculty and finan-
cial support.”

And despite the fact that Sweet
Briar officialdom has been pooh-
poohing the idea ever since, coed talk
is definitely popular among the stu-
dents there these days.

Student action is being planned,
complete with committees and discus-
sions. The Sweet Briar News, obvious-
ly an enlightened, progressive campus
newspaper, has endorsed the idea of
admitting male students. Speculation
and activity is rife.

The obvious question is, where
would Sweet Briar get its boys? And,

without meaning to be overly forward,
may we suggest . . . Davidson?

The idea is not as silly as ‘it sounds,
for if Davidson is ever to go coed—
and the chances are now better,
though still rather remote, than
they’ve ever been—we will have a
similar problem—i.e., where to get
the girls.

President Spencer had just that
problem in mind back during Orien-
tation when he and a group of student
leaders were discussing Davidson and
the feasibility of coeducation here.
Obviously, not just any girls will do—
they'll have to be fairly intelligent
(and pretty, please)—and the group
decided that probably the easiest way
of effecting coeducation here would be
to link up with an already established
girls’ school.

Such a girls’ school, Dr. Spencer
suggested (facetiously, unfortunately),
might be Maty Baldwin. “Why not
move Mary Baldwin down here?” he
asked, laughing.

Why not? Sounds good to us. And
maybe if Mary Baldwin plays hard to
get, Sweet Briar will be more co-
operative.

California Professor Proclaims
Doctrine Of Student Negritude

ED. NOTE: The following
reprint from Time Out, a pub-
lication of the National Stu-
dents Association, has created
a controversary on many col-
lege campuses. it is reprinted
here for students to make
their own evaluation of this
Judgment of them.

By GERALD FARBER
Students are niggers.
When you get that straight.

our schools begin to make
sense. It's more important,
though, to understand why
they're niggers. If we fol-
low that question seriously
enough, it will lead us past
the zone of academic rhetor-
ic. where dedicated teachers
pass their knowledge on to a
new generation. and into the
nitty-gritty of human needs
and hang-ups.

At Cal State LA. where I
teach, the students have sep-
arate and unequal dining
facilities. If I take them into
the faculty dining room, my
colleagues get uncomfortable,
as though there were a bad
smell.

At Cal State, also. there is
an unwritten Jaw barring stu-
dent-faculty love - making.
Fortunately, this  anti-mis-
cegenation law, like its
Southern counterpart, is not
100 per cent effective.

The students are, it is true,
allowed to have a toy gov-
ernment of their own. It is a
government run for the most
part by Uncle Toms and con-
cerned principally with trivia.
The faculty and administra-
tors decide what courses will
be offered: the students get
to choose their own Home-
coming Queen.

A student at Cal State is
expected to know his place.
The faculty tell him what

courses to take (in my de-
partment, English, even elec-
tives have to be approved by
a faculty member); they tell
him what to read. what to
write, and frequently, where
to set the margins on his
typewriter.

When a_ teacher says
“jump,” students jump. I
know of one professor who
refused to take up class time
for exams and required stu-
dents to show up for tests at
6:30 in the morning. And they
did, by God!

Even more discouraging
than this Auschwitz approach

to education is the fact that

the students take it. They
haven't gone through 12 years
of public school for nothing.
They've learned one thing
and perhaps only one thing

during those 12 years.
They've forgotten their alge-
bra. They're _ hopelessly

vague about chemistry and
physics. They've grown to
fear and resent literature.
They write like they've been
lobotomized.

Students don’t ask that or-
ders make sense. They give
up expecting things to make
sense long before they leave
elementary school. Things
are true because the teachers
say they’re true. And that's
just fine because you don't
care anyway. Miss Wiede-
meyer tells you a noun is a
person, place or thing. So let
it be. You don't give a damn:
she doesn't give a damn.

The important thing is to
please her. Back in kinder-
garten, you found out that
teachers only love children
who stand in nice straight
lines. And that’s where it’s
been ever since.

What school amounts to,
then. for white and black kids

YMCA’s Bell
Thanks Helpers

To The Editor:

The purpose of this letter
is to thank the Davidson com-
munity—students, faculty,
and administration—for their
support in the recent YMCA
Fund Drive. The drive was a
success, thanks to the many
Great Guys at Davidson.

A list of all those who
helped with collections and
publicity would be too long
to attempt. However, I would
like to take this opportunity
to thank them publicly for
doing such a first-rate job.

Working with these men

was my privilege, and the
Fund Drive’s success is their
achievement.

Any student who failed to
contribute, and wishes to do
so, may drop his check by
the “Y" office. Membership
cards may also be picked up
by those who want them.

Again, let me thank and
congratulate all those who
did such a tremendous job in
supporting the 1968 YMCA
Fund Drive.

1968: A Chaotic Year
To Salvage A Dream

By CHUCK GREEN
Staff Writer

The year 1968 has not been
without its political earth-
quakes, and that chaotic year
is not yet over: thus any
prediction as to how the na-
tionwide contest at the OK
Corral will come out must. be
qualified with many “‘if's."

. The analogy with a Western

“shoot’em up’ is not without
validity, for as a part of the
nation has made an about-
face to the right and as
another part has accelerated
to the left. many political
contests, especially House
races, have taken on the
character of the good guys
versus the bad guys. with no
certainty that the good guys
will win and that the losers
will let the winners take the
spoils.

Polarization

The Wallace candidacy has
merely intensified this polar-
ization, generating hate in
both left and right wings and
making those who try to
straddle the fence lean to one
side.

And will the Wallace voter
in the South vote for Demo-

crats or Republicans for the
Jesser offices? These con-
tests may well be decided by
the man who can out- Wallace
Wallace.

Hubert Humphrey is a most
pathetic candidate. In early
June Humphrey could have
beaten Nixon. but the Battle
of Chicago destroyed the
grand coalition forged by
FDR.

Division vs. Fantasy

Ironically, the Democratic
Convention realistically dem-
onstrated the deep divisions
that are strangling America,
while the Republican Conven-
tion was a sickeningly calm
excursion into fantasyland.

As for Richard Nixon. that
simple savior of America’s
destiny, the nagging question
many people are asking is
whether the new Nixon is
really different from the old
Nixon and whether an expen-
sive campaign to re-make
Nixon's image can re-make
the man.

Nixon, like Ike, offers calm,
quiet. a slow-down; and it
appears that society has
been changing too fast for
most Americans. But one
must ask whether a slow-
down will result in time’s

running out for democracy.

It may mean that the left
will become impatient ard
the right intolerant, and that
Nixon will preside over catas-
trophe.

This is what 1968 is all
about, for our national goals,
once clear four years ago,
have now been redefined in
terms of the chaos of Watts,
of Selma, of Vietnam.

‘ Rejected Dream

The result is that many
have come to reject the
American Dream, others
have forgotten what that
Dream really means, and the
rest are desperately trying
to salvage what they can
from the rubble. The degree
of success of the latter group
will decide the nation's fate.

I am reminded of what
Robert Kennedy said in the
California primary: ‘‘the
choices that we will have to
make in 1968 will be vital
ones: for we must choose be-
tween love and hate, between
peace and war, and perhaps
whether we shall live or
whether we shall die.”

Robert Kennedy is dead;
and the election of 1968 may
well foretell of things to
come.

She Followed Me Home. Can | Keep Her?

alike, is a 12-year course in
how to be slaves. What else
could explain who I see in a
freshman class? They've got
that slave mentality: oblig
ing and ingratiating on the
surface but hostile and desis-
tant underneath.

As do black slaves, students |
vary in their awareness of
what's going on. Some recog-
nize their own put-on for what /
it is and even let their rebel-
lion break through to the sur-
face now and then. Others—
including most of the ‘“‘good
students’—hvae been more
deeply brainwashed. They
swallow the bull with greedy
mouths. They're pathetically
eager to be pushed around.

College entrance require-
ments tend to favor the Toms
and screen out the rebels.
Not entirely, of course. Some
students at Cal State LA
are expert con artists who
‘know perfectly well what’s
happening. They want the
degree or the 2-S and spend
their years on the ald planta-
tion alternately laughing and
cursing as they play the
game. If their egos are
strong enough, they cheat a
lot.

And, of course, even the

Toms are angry down deep
somewhere. But it comes out
in passive rather than active
aggression. They're unex-
plainably thick-witted and
subject to frequent spells of
laziness. They misread sim-
ple questions. They spend
their nights mechanically
outlining history chapters
while meticulously failing to
comprehend a word of what's
in front of them.

The saddest cases among
both black slaves and stu-
dent slaves are the ones who
have so thoroughly intropect-
ed their master's values that
their anger is all turned in-
ward. At Cal State, these are
the kids for whom every low
grade is torture, who stam-
mer and shake when they
speak to a professor, who go
through an emotional crisis
every time they’re called up-
on during class.

You can recognize them
easily at finals time. Their
faces are festooned with fresh
pimples; their bowels boil
audibly across the room.

If there really is a Last
Judgment, the parents and
teachers who create these
wrecks are going to burn in
hell.

Humphrey's The One

Unless the spectre of 1948 returns to haunt the
likes of George Gallup, Richard M. Nixon will probably
be elected President of the United States next week.

Although voting for Humphrey might not be the
best way to spend a Tuesday afternoon, I must agree
with the rest DAVIDSONIAN’s editorial board
that it certainly tops a vote for Nixon.

One wonders why the Republican Party, with the
wealth of talent that it certainly has, chose to reach
back into its sterile past in search of a candidate. But
it says we have a new Nixon, a statesman tempered
by defeat, mellowed by time and advised not to fasten
all three buttons on his suit coats.

Here, they say, is a man uniquely equipped for
the office he seeks. Eight years as a vice president,
several months (after the Eisenhower heart attack) as
the virtual president, experience in Congress, ad
infinitum. Then, following his defeat by Kennedy, this
man had the opportunity to view the office from afar
gaining new insights and perspectives while sitting in
his law office.

This is not the old Nixon who was fond of phrases
like “soft on communism” (Spiro who?), who tended.
to a reckless, sophomoric point of view and who
twitched too much on television. He’s matured now,
like a dark-haired elder statesman. .

Of course one wonders how he managed to do
such an admirable job as vice president without ma-
turing. It seems that all those years in the House,
Senate and the vice presidency would mature a man
faster than a few years as a New York attorney. May-
be that says something for government service.

Since, like all judicious candidates, Nixon has

been vague on many issues during the campaign, one
must read the arguments of his supporters to gain an
insight into this man. In a sense it’s like the Quest of
the Historical Jesus.
___ The most convenient set of arguments is the article
in last week’s DAVIDSONIAN by Professor Jon Fuller.
In hope of not offending a personable scholar, I would
like to examine his dissertation.

Certainly Humphrey would have problems ending
the war. Who wouldn't? But to say that “his (Hum-
phrey’s) close identification with its errors” would
make his less flexible in negotiations is not neces-
sarily true. In one of the rare reappearances of the
old Nixon, the GOP candidate made it clear that by
“honorable peace” he means “on America’s terms.”

Mr. er continues: “Nixon has a clear advan-

tage: he can blame the unattractive aspects of the set-
tlement on the previous administration. Humphrey
would have no one to blame but himself.”
; It may come as a shock to some that Humphrey
is NOT the incumbent president. And no commentator
has ever said or implied that Humphrey came close
to dictating policy to Lyndon Johnson.

Mr. Fuller then writes that after Vietnam is off
our backs we can attack the problems here at home.
The record of the old Nixon on domestic issues was
unimaginative. We'll have to wait until the inaugura-
tion to see what the new Nixon really thinks.

___ Finally, he says that Nixon will bring fresh, ima-
ginative faces to government to replace the tired old
men who are “frustrated and exhausted by their labors
and failures in the Johnson Administration.”

_. Of course one of those men Nixon supposedly
listens to is John Gardner, whose name is associated
with the failure-ridden Department of Health, Educa-
tion and Welfare.

_ But fresh faces do not necessarily indicate fresh
minds, In fact journalists accompanying the Nixon
campaign have pointed out that many of the young
people in the Nixon organization are old style con-
servatives at heart.

Mr. Fuller’s article aside, Nixon’s philosophy of
government and the presidency have been clouded by
a welter of confusing and contradictory statements.
Memories of the old Nixon do not inspire confidence.
And if Spiro T. Agnew is an example of the new
Nixon’s ability to find capable men, then one might
wonder what sort of a government President Nixon
would put together.

fl nt- mind, Hubert Humphr the
only candidate worthy of a vote. Pirey seems
