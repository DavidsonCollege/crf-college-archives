NUMBER 23

Minors approved by majority of faculty

By ANN HATFIELD
Staff Writer

In a decision that surprised
many, the faculty voted in favor of
minors 63-41 on Tuesday April 2.
Two faculty members chose to
abstain.

By passing the proposal, fac-
ulty members agreed that minors
might be offered at the discretion
of each department.

minors will be in place by aca-
demic year ’96-’97, but expects
that many will not be offered until
the following year.

This news comes as a result of
the proposal formulated by the
Council for Academic Affairs as
well a SGA resolution.

Liz Abernathy, Co-chair ofthe
Council for Academic Affairs,
says, “We are naturally very ex-
cited about the faculty’s approval

of the minors option. Many mem-
bers approached us to say how
impressed they were by the enthu-

siastic response from students in .

support of minors. We are grate-
ful to students and faculty for their
support and look forward to seeing
minors become a part of the aca-
demic tradition at Davidson.”
Professor of History Russell
Snapp says he is “not surprised by
the results because of the strong

RELIGION AT DAVIDSON?

Crossing paths:angry
students fight over symbols

By NARESH NAGELLA

Staff Writer

It is likely that within the week yet another
major date will be added into the history of Davidson’s
religious affiliation.

It is this weekend, April 18-21, that the Trustees
will convene on campus for yet another semi-annual
meeting. Raised as a significant issue during the
trustee retreat in the Spring of 1993, faculty and
students alike are waiting to see if any of the bylaws
which govern the religious affiliation of the faculty
and officers of the college.

Three main questions await the Trustees’ an-
swers: Should Religion professors have to give “evi-
dence of strong Christian convictions”? Should all
Trustees —even those elected from alumni associa-
tions — be “active members of a Christian Church”?
And must the President demonstrate a “Christian
faith and commitment” through an “affiliation with
the Presbyterian Church”?

According to President Kuykendall, the Board

Easter brought more than religious celebration
to campus. It brought a good deal of discussion,
debate, and controversy.

Continuing a year old tradition, the Fellowship
of Christian Athletes, Intervarsity Christian Fellow-
ship, and other Christian faculty and staff set up their
Easter display consisting of three 5 and 1/2 feet tall
crosses in between dormitory row and Chambers to
remind everyone of “the true meaning of Easter.”

Last year three students erected another cross
covered in Rose's Easter flyers juxtaposed to the
crosses set up by the groups, along with a small
wooden bunny covered with Bible verses.

However, this year, those opposed to the display
were direct in showing their disagreement.

First, three miniature crosses were anonymously
put up next to the original display. A sign indicated
that if the crosses were real the display would be a
“thousand times larger.”

andadds, “That [support] definitely
influenced the faculty.”

However, he says, “I think we
might have considered the pro-
posal at greater length...” While
Snapp says that he believes that
“minors probably are a good idea
for some students,” he voices some
concern that students may feel pres-
sured to adopt a minor when greater
exploration of the curriculum might
be more beneficial.

Professor of Chemistry Mitch

Rhea says, "I've got no quarrel
with minors. I think if you are
willing to put forth the effort, you
deserve recognition... I think that
by and large, this department is in
favor of them."

In the wake of this student
victory, however, many are left
asking “what now’’?

The proposal defines minors
as a set of five or six courses desig-
nated by a participating depart-

Reviving the legend
Two freshmen want to bring the
tour guide tale to life with debate

By Brap D. CHASE
Staff Writer

“The balconies of Eumenean
and Philanthropic Halls have been
silent for years.

While the common tour guide
lore about the debating traditions
sticks in many students’ minds, no
one seems to care about why this
tradition has ceased at Davidson

Almost no one, that is.

Two Davidson Freshmen,
Austin Rios and Scott Geier, have
started an effort to revive the tradi-
tion of debates from Eu and Phi
Halls.

“Austin and I were walking
out of the library one evening when
we noticed Eu and Phi Hall’s de-
picted on the opposing sides of the
entrance. We thought it would be
neat to revive that tradition,” says
Geier. “

I think that the students are

be one way to increase involve-
ment.”

Sara Beasley, Visiting Instruc-
tor in English and advisor to the
proposed debate group, says, “I
really would love to see it happen.
I think that it is not only intellectu-
ally exciting, but it is also a tradi-
tion to revive.”

“Imagine one person debat-
ing another in front of the student
body,” says Geier, “no one is go-
ing to want to lose, it would be like
losing face.”

While there is a Phi Society in
existence now, they do not stage
debates in the traditional format.

The group, which meets Sun-
day evenings, discusses current
events, books, and other issues.

According to Geier, “we have
some research to do before this
happens. We wantto possibly have
a preliminary debate and see how
the students react. I think that it

generally apathetic and this would will really catch on.”
