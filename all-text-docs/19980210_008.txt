‘Don’t get me started... I know that

' this Saturday is Valentine’s Day, and I

_ know that I said I would take you out
to dinner. How about the Commons? I
hear they’re serving Student Steak! So,|
Ill meet you there?”

‘What?! No flowers? No candy? No
romantic candlelight dinner? What
kind of male chauvanist swine are you?
I should have listened to my mother!
She always thought you were a no-good ™&
sleazeball!”’

Tired of copying your best friend’s ideas for the perfect evening?
At a loss for things to do with your date on Valentine’s Day?
