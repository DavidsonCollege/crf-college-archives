State tuition grants stir controversy

By LYMAN COLLINS
News Editor

Due to recent editorials in
The Charlotte Observer and
elsewhere, an increasing am-
ount of attention is focusing
upon state grants to private
colleges and universities in
North Carolina.

Davidson College President
Samuel R. Spencer Jr. has
been instrumental in institu-
ting the program of grant to
North Carolina students at-
tending the state’s 39 private
institutions of higher learning.

Spencer explained that
there are actually two prog-
rams in effect.

Under the first, each private

college is given an amount

equivalent to $200 per North
Carolina student which is then
redistributed to North Caro-
lina students on the basis of
need.

The second program is the
Tuition Offset Grant under
which every North Carolina
student is granted $200 re-
gardless of need.

The North Carolina Asso-
ciation of Independent Col-

leges and Universities is seek-
ing to increase the amount
awarded under the Tuition
Offset Grant be increased $100
for next year.

This proposed increase has
stirred considerable controver-
sy. Charlotte Observer publi-
sher Rolfe Neill concluded a
recent edit¥rial saying ‘‘if
forced to choose (between
increased state aid or closing
private schools) I have to say
close the private schools—as
long as public institutions are
not getting all that they need
from the legislature.”’

Spencer pointed out, how-
ever, that the distinction be-
tween private and public insti-
tutions can only be made in
reference to control.

“Private and state suppor-
ted colleges are chartered by
North Carolina and have no
other function than the public
good,” he said. ‘‘In terms of
function both are public insti-
tutions.’

Spencer pointed out that
although it is cheaper for the
individual students at state
universities it is not cheaper

for the taxpayer.

State subsidies to public
schools amount to about $2000
per student compared with
subsidies at private schools of
$400 per student.

‘‘If'a private college goes

out of business their students
automatically become ‘wards
of the state’ and must be
subsidized at the state
school,’”’ explained Spencer.
Spencer pointed out that

Leaders initiate Forum and
promise more cooperation

The  Inter-Organizational
Forum held its initial meeting
this week and discussed
topics relating to campus
and community life:

The IOF is a group organ-
ized for the purpose of com-
municating ideas between var-
ious student organizations on
campus. —

Its meetings are loose and
discussion-oriented. Student
body president Thom Young
added to this by stating that
“keeping the IOF informal will
pull the organization on its
feet’’ and make it more effect-
ive at Davidson. e

The IOF is also concerned
with coordinating programs of
common interest on campus.
Its representatives can better
schedule activities, work clo-
sely on campus-wide programs

and mobilize quickly and fully
on important issues which
may arise.

Dean Will Terry’s sugges-
tion for the creation of an arts
and crafts center was\the
major topic of discussion.
Members of the IOF contribu-
ted their opinions and ideas for
such a center on the Davidson
campus.

YM/YWCA President Jay
Silver said, ‘‘A lot of tutors
run out of things to do with
their kids.”” He stated that an
arts and crafts center on
campus would give tutors
more activities for the kids.

“It would also keep the kids
out of the dorm, which has
been a problem lately,’’ said
Silver.

Silver also stated that an
arts and crafts center would be
‘‘a good alternative for stu-

dents on Friday and Saturday

nights.’’ Other members ag-
reed that Davidson students
could use such an outlet as the
center to occupy.their spare
time.

Union Board President Billy
Hutchings offered to find a
way to finance the center
under Union funds if the need
was strong enough. Young
suggested running a petition
for student interest to be
distributed during Senate visi-
tations to dorms.

The Davidsonian editor
Cathy Landis offered to run a

ublicity poll for interest in
the arts and crafts center in
the newspaper or a feature on
the need for such a center.

Landis said, ‘“The IOF can
help to alleviate conflicts of
interests at Davidson by its
members talking together.’’

DCF representative Sue
Murdaugh also stated that the
200 people in DCF wanted to
get involved on campus but
didn’t know how, and the IOF
could help in this area.

The IOF is most important-
ly a wealth of information.
“All the organizations coming
together in one spot can give
you just about any kind of
information you need,”’ asser-
ted Landis.

Plans for the IOF’s next
meeting are on January 24.

yed a pivotal role in the his-
tory of higher education provi-
ding needed diversity and free-
dom of choice.

W.A. Johnson, who sits on
the Board of Governors of the
University of North Carolina

sees state aid as a threat to
private schools.

“Already we have reached
the point where it is no longer
entirely accurate to consider
the private institutions as
strictly private in character,”
he writes. ‘Increasingly they
are acquiring quasi-public sta-
tus.”

He argues that increasing
state aid will lead to increasing
state control.

“They must be preserved as
free and independent private
institutions, otherwise. They
shall lose those very attributes

and characteristics which
make them so unique and so

valuable to our system of

higher education,” Johnson
proclaims.

education,’’ Johnson proc-
laims.

Spencer points out that the
private colleges are not comp-
eting for funds with the state
schools.

‘“‘As we plan for the future,
the independent colleges come
to you as partners— not adver-
saries—in the educational en-
terprise,’”’ concluded Spencer.

EMPTY ART GALLERY awaits Tuesday’s open-
ing in remodeled banquet hall.

Gallery opening

By ANTHONY EVERMAN

Tnis coming Tuesday, the
new Davidson College Art
Gallery/multi-purpose room
will open in the old Chambers
Banquet Hall.

“The hall is ready, except
for some last minute details,”
according to Herb Jackson
who supervises the planning
and the development of the
gallery itself. ‘‘Visitors should
be pleasantly surprised by the
quality of the work.”’

The gallery will be used to
show off the permanent collec-
tion of Davidson art, A large

quantity of work has been ™

done by people associated with
the college and has since been
ignored. | ©

This will be the first chance
to exhibit these collected

works. Some of the work has
never been viewed before by
the public.

On Tuesday, in addition to
the permanent collection,
there will be an exhibition of
handmade furniture entitled,
“Art as Furniture as Art,’’ by
Bob Kopf. This will be only
the first of many exhibits.

In addition to serving as an
art gallery, the facility will
resume its old function as a
place for meals on special
occasions and for coffee and
cokes. The physical transfor-
mation should provide a more
pleasurable environment for
these activities.

“The old banquet hall no
longer looks like a dungeon
but is a beautiful facility. It is
sure to be one of the most
popular places on campus,”’
concluded Jackson.
