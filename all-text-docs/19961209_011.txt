AIDS hits home

Alumni Zach Long brings AIDS awareness week into perspective

By BriAN TARR
Director of Alumni Relations

Editor’s note: The following
article was printedin The Davidson
Journal, Vol. VII Fall 1991, in
memoriam of Zachary Fillmore
Long, Jr. 65 (1943-91). He is one
of the ten known Davidson alumni
who died of AIDS: Frank T.
Bencini, George T. Rogister Jr.,
Pascal Gayle Batson III, William
James Richards, Jr., Wyatt R.
McCants, Charles Nelson
Williamson, Frederick Milton
Sackett, Jr., Bedford A. Aiken,
Howard Stanley Guest. Last week
marked AIDS awareness week.

Davidson has lost one: of its
most loyal and most memorable
sons: Zach Long ‘65, former direc-
tor of alumni relations (1975-81),
died July 30, 1991. His commit-
ment to Davidson and his faithful-
ness to friends were inspiring.

Concerning his work at
Davidson, Howard Arbuckle ‘64,
another former director of alumni
relations said, “His service to
Davidson was total dedication to
the life and welfare of the college.
The amount of activity that he gen-
erated in chapters and on campus
was remarkable.”

As alumni director Zach was
the originator of the tradition of
honoring graduating seniors with
alumni parents at a breakfast on
the morning of Commencement.
He is famous for developing a
marvelous travel program that was
the delight of many alumni. John
Akers ‘28, former president of the
Alumni Association and outstand-
ing alumni volunteer leader, told
me: When I think of Zach, I think
of those wonderful trips. We went
to Brazil, England, Scotland, Ire-
land, Greece, Russia. The were
always well organized and well
directed.” (By the way, Dr. Akers
was the first chairman of the tradi-
tional gathering at Homecoming
of the Avant Garde—alumni whose
classes have celebrated their fifti-
eth reunions—another of Zach’s
innovations.)

Julius Melton, executive di-
rector of institutional advance-
ment, described the Davidson tours
this way: “The total group travel-
ing on the plane and staying in the
booked hotels would far outnum-
ber our modest sized contingent,
but the Davidson tour group was
always the envy of the other people
due to the party approach, the
amenities, and the special arrange-
ments Zach had worked into their
tour.” }

It was not just the innovations
that Zach is known for; it was his
caring nature. Cary Eaton ‘65

Zach’s freshman and sophomore
roommate told me that “Zach was
caring and friendly and always on
the go. And was faithful in his
friendships.” Cary now is an envi-
ronmental researcher in Raleigh,
N.C., and has a wife and three
children. Zach would send cards
to the children on their birthdays,
and he would send interesting
stamps that he came across to Cary,
who is a collector.

This thoughtfulness was felt
by all of Zach’s friends, and he had
many. “Zach was a fabulous cor-
respondent. He sent letters to hun-
dreds of people,” Nick Burnett,
[retired] Professor of Chemistry,
told me. “I have his address book
and there are over six hundred
people in it.”

Louise Martin, wife of former
president D. Grier Martin ‘32, said
that Zach “loved beautiful, nice
things. He went to flea markets
everywhere—even on the travel
tours. When he was in the army in
Korea, he had a painting sent to
Grier as president of Davidson from
a college over there.”

But Zach is also known for his
faults, which became endearing to
his friends. “For example, he had
trouble with time. As Louise Mar-
tin put it, “Zach was never, ever on
time!”” He was forever late to meet-
ings. Bob Stephenson, [retired]
director of administrative services,
once told me, “Zach could make
you so mad because he would call

’ at the last minute to ask you to do

something, but he had a way about
him that made you glad to have
helped because of his unquestion-
able dedication and contagious
excitement.”

As Nancy Blackwell, associ-
ate alumni director, says, “Zach
did things at the last minute, but he

got things accomplished.”

He also was known for his
penny pinching. As Julius Melton
noted, “I think of frugality as a
hallmark of his time here and of his
approach to managing his time here
and of his approach to managing
his own life. Cutting corners and
making items purchased for the
alumni programs do double, triple,
and quadruple duty was just ex-
pected.” Yet, he was an incredibly
generous person. His many friends
received exquisite gifts from him
and he was quick to help friends.
Apparently, he was the same with
his friends in San Francisco, his
new home after leaving Davidson,
and there he is also known for
community volunteer work. He
spent a great deal of time raising
money for the AIDS Emergency
Fund, the San Francisco Sym-
phony, and the San Francisco Op-
era. (Music was a-constant part of
his life.) He was also active at the
Larkin Street Youth Center, a ha-
ven for runaway children. For all
of this, he was named Man of the
Year in San Francisco in 1991.

Here is some of what was said
about Zach at his memorial ser-
vice, preached Aug. 10 at Old First
Church in San Francisco: “Zach
understood the theology of funer-
