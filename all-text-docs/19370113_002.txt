Mimeographed Exams...

Exams culminate the effort of a semester’s
college work, and upon them largely depends

the student’s grade in’ his own particular

course. Exams ARE a great strain, and de-
mand a maximum of concentrated study and
cool logical thinking. If the student does his
part in preparing for an exam, and we believe
the average one does, why should not the pro-
The majority of Davidson professors
mimeograph their exams, but still a great
many persist in scribbling reams of illegible
writing on a narrow blackboard. We have
known instances in which a student’s exam
grade was materially affected, not because
he did not know the answers, but because the
poor method of giving the exam aggravated
him, and finally caused him to loose that self-
control so necessary.

According to Prof. Austin Prodoehl, of Bir-

We believe that every Davidson College

DR. JOHN L. DOUGLAS,
GENTLEMAN

A true gentleman, in the sense that all

Davidson men have defined that word,

sums up the life of Dr. John L, Douglas,
who died at his home here last’ week.

Dr. Douglas, in his nearly forty years
of association with Davidson personified
the things in his life that Davidson men
everywhere have tried,to instill into their

contact during his long service as teacher

and friend.

Dignified, yet not too possessed of
dignity to feel the heart throbs of stu-
dents in their multitude of problems and
joys, Dr. Douglas upheld to its highest
degree the tenets of personal integrity,
loyal leadership, and personal sacrifice.
In a world that was changing he held to
the ideals that Davidson first stood for.
He neither sought ner knew compromise
with anything that would lower the aims
this institution has ever held aloft.

Davidson feels a personal loss in the
death of this kindly and humble man.
Predominantly a teacher, his influence
extended far beyond the scope of printed
word into -the lives of many who knew
and loved him.—C, F, S.

SENIOR PRIVILEGE, WHAT? ... We have

is not lazy, but we wish to maintain a sound

Comments,

It seems to me that a spirit has been grow-
ing in the student body for the last year or
so which is definitely harmful to the welfare
of our campus. It is hard’ to express it ex-
actly, but it is a kind of antagonism between
groups and organizations or between organi-

zations and the stydent body as a whole.

These
are only very obvious manifestations of this
spirit which is continually being exhibited
more privately in the form of continual cyni-
cal and unreasoning remarks directed toward
those groups on the campus whose job it is
to accomplish something.

A large part of all this can doubtless be
classed as good natured kidding. Some of it,
if directed to the right people, would be reas-
onable criticism. But I believe that a great
deal of it is just the desire of the student body
to argue, find fault, and kick up a little fuss.

What we need more than anything else is
co-operation. Honest opposition is a good
influence, but mere objection for the sake of
objecting, without good reason will eventually
reduce our whole program of student gov-
ernment and activities to one huge joke.

And_ the Pan-Hellenic Council has
practically gone into hiding. Not a stooge,
we would still like to point out that the Coun-
cil has yet to officially announce a band for
Mid-Winters (if booing keeps up they may
not get a chance). When and if they do is
the time for installment plan subscribers to

start calling, ‘quack, quack, money back’!

EXAMS ... Most of our readers probably
already know that examinations start a week
from tomorrow. Following unbroken tradi-

who, fresh from high schools, have never had

bon mot of the moment. With a re-
ply of “Twit, twit, try and git” from

the dances and it is right that they
should have an interest in them and

a desire as to who shall play for
them. The dances don’t belong to
any one organization or to several

organizations but to the students
as a whole. We wanted and still
want a big-name band for Mid-

Winters but it seems that the Music
Corporation of America and other
agencies have locks on all the bet-
ter known orchestras, booking them
for ‘those schools making the best
offer and whose schedule coincides
with the orchestra’s arranged tour.
We aren't backing down or chang-
ing color but we believe that Ed
and the boys have: made an earnest
effort to please as many as possible.
Our little crystal globe predicts
the biggest and best Mid-Winters
Davidson has ever had, so let's all
get in line for a little co-operation.
