The Committee advised the college to
state in its official publications:,‘‘We
do not offer full health services.’”

’ The College’s student services per-
sonnel, faculty advisors, and hall
counselors must avoid sex-biased
counseling.

““We don’t want to hear of any
advice like, ‘Since you're a girl, don’t
spend too much money on education.
Just get a degree here and stop—you
will be married before too long,” said
Dietler.

The Committee found no inequities
in dispinsing financial aid through
regular channels and no discrimin-
ation in student employment prac-
tices.

The Self-Study Report was comple-
ted July 21 and submitted to Spencer.
Assistant to the President Peter
Clark has been preparing the report
for Spencer’s evaluation.

“‘T took the Committee’s recom-
mendations, summarized each indi-
vidually, noted through which chan-
nels I thought each should go, and
gave my information to Dr. Spencer,’
said Clark.

Title IX will have an impact on
sex-discrimination in athletics at
colleges across the land. The Depart-
ment of Health, Education and
Welfare (Title IX overseers) recog-
nizes the complexity of problems in
this area and has allowed the schools

until July 21, 1978 to report on ending

discrimination in athletics. !
“This summer the Committee stu-
died some aspects of athletics at
Davidson. After another discussion
with Pat.Drake we will turn over our

,athletics data to Dr. Spencer,” said

Stephenson.

“T imagine that the 1978 Report will
deal with the problems and possibil-
ities of providing physical education
facilities and athletic programs for
women that are comparable to men’s.

“Another controversial issue will be
the legality of Davidson offering 15
scholarships for men’s basketball but
no athletic scholarships in any sport
for girls.’’ *

“Title IX regulations call for some
degree of parity between men and
women in opportunities for scholar-
ships,’’said Stephenson.

No action will be taken immediate-
ly, but Clark confirmed ‘‘that Dr.
Spencer will initiate plans to meet the
1978 deadline. He has not decided
under what format the study will be
made.”’

“In the $35 million we hope to
raise, funds are earmarked for a
reorganization of the athletics pro-
gram—I imagine that reorganization
will be in some way tied to Title IX
rules. At any rate, we have almost
two years, and'that’s plenty of time to
attend to the matter,’’ Clark con-
cluded.

“‘WheRever we can open up
programs such as these to the
entire student body, however,
we will,’’ he emphasized.

Avinger explained that de-
partmental honors are con-
trolled entirely by the indivi-
dual departments. The Honors
Center has nothing to do with
directing their programs or
evaluating them.

“We do, however, want to
encourage students in depart-
mental honors to participate in

: the Center,’’ he added.

““Let’s face it, if a student is is
interested in strictly depart-
mental honors he can find
them in a particular depart-
ment. The Honors Center
allows him to explore areas
and departments not offered
by the college,” he said.

As an example Avinger
cited the area of linguistics in
which the college does not
have a major. Utilizing the
Honors Center, a student
could pursue this interest in
the different departments in-
volved but under one program
directed by the Center.

ing to Smith.

‘“The reason for that was
that across the country more
unions are adding services like
counseling for the students.
We think the addition will
enhance the students’ oppor-
tunities, by giving them coun-
seling in a normal way they
don’t have to run to a hide-
away for counseling,’’ he said.

“So we welcome counseling
here.”’
Formal classes are meeting
in the Union this year, accord-
ing to Smith.

“Ideally we should not have
classes in an activity building,

it was done promiscously at
all; it was done with our
cooperation,” said Smith.
Informal classes met in the
Union last year, but the’
Executive Board has given
permission for the use of the

«building for regular class-

rooms.

‘‘My impression is they
won’t use it as much as they
thought they would, but they
could,” he said.
