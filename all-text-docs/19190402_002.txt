OUR PURPOSE.

You have placed upon the shoulders of
the new staff the responsibility of pub-
lishing The Davidsonian, and upholding
its dignity as a college weekly. We wish
here to express our gratitude to you for
allowing us to serve you in this manner.

The Davidsonian is your paper. 1t is
an organ of service: And its main pur-
pose for existing is to serve you and the
college from which it has gotten — its
name. To this end the staff will always
work with the hope that it shall fulfill
all the demands which you call upon it
to perform,

To do this we must have your sym-
pathy and co-operation. Mistakes will
be made. Misunderstandings will arise.
Yet thru it all we want you to know and
feel that we are trying to serve you.

Criticisms and suggestions will be wel-
comed at all times by the editors. And
we want you to feel free to make them
at any time.

With the knowledge that we have
your sympathy and co-operation, we shall
be able to accomplish the duties which
you have given us. And The David-
sonian will fulfill the purpose of its ex-
istence, making the year 1919-1920 the
most successful of its career.

“Every day is a new life. Every
evening is a Day of Judgment Every
morning is a Resurrection.”""—Crane.

No doubt most of the sleeping sick-
ness that we hear so much about can be
traced to “Spring Fever.”

“Manhood overtops all titles. Chaz-
acter is above all riches, greater than any
career. Character is success.” —Success.

“Athletics for everybody and every-
body in athletics,” is a very good motto
for us to consider.

College life seems to be one “Love
Set” after another.

Don't let the man in you die for the
lack of energy, of vigorous industry, and
a definite purpose in life.

A LASTING MEMORIAL.

We have just passed thru a trying
ime. We have fought and have over-
“ome not only a treacherous enemy, but
also an ideal that has been gripping the
world for many centuries. It seems
natural then that we shoud want to ex-
press our appreciation to those who
fought and died in the recent great
struggle,

In the last month or so the question
of erecting a memorial has been brought
hefore the student body and alumni sev-
eral times. Last week Dr. J. M. Mc-
Connell presented it to the student body.
Every one seemed to be in favor of
erecting 2 memorial altho no decision
was reached as to what form it would
take.

Several proposals were made. One of
them was to erect a swimming pool, an-
other to erect two memorial gates, and
still another has been suggested which
will take the form of a scholarship. It
seems that the kind which we all want
is one that will last as long as the col-
leve itself and which will thru the ex-
cellence of its design, be an example,
and inspiration to’ present and future
generations. .

Mr. Cass Gilbert, who has taken
quite an interest in war memorials in
our country, has summed up the char-
acter of one of these by saying: “The
most impressive monument is one which
appeals to the imagination alone, which
rests not upon its material use but upon
‘ts idealism. From such a monument
flows the impulse for great and heroic
action, for devotion to duty and for love
of country.

“The Arch of Triumph in Paris, the
Washineton Monument, the Lincoln
Memorial, are example of such monu-
ments. They are devoid of practical
utility, but they minister to a much high-
er use; they compel contemplation of the
great men and ideals which they com-
memorate; they elevate the thoughts of
all beholders: they arouse and make cf-
fective the finest impulses of humanity.
They are the visible symbols of the as-
pirations of the race.

“Display of wealth, ostentation and
over-elaborateness are unbecoming and
vulgar. Elegant simplicity, strength with
refinement, and a grace of handling that
imparts charm are the ends to be sought.
These ends require, on the part of every-
hody connected with the enterprise—
committee, adviser and artist—familiar-
itv with the standards of art, and above
all good taste. Only bya combination of
all these elements can a really. satisfac-
tory result be obtained.”

The Davidsonian wishes to help you
in securing a lasting memorial, and if in
any way it can be of service, feel free to
use its columns, :

VITAL ASPECT OF OUR
RELIGION DISCUSSED

At the last meeting of the World's
Forum, Mr. Miles gave a very interest-
ing talk on “Reality and Religion.” His
talk brought out two ideas with a brief
discussion on each. His first idea was
the reality of individuals and of na-
tions. Is our Christianity fit to give to
other people or nations? The second
point was the giving of our Christianity
to other nations. Under the discussion
was mentioned the fact that it so greatly
benefited the army boys overseas.

Every one who heard Mr. Miles was
very much impressed by what he had to

say. =>
