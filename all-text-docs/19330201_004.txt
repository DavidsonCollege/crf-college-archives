TREKKING WEST

VISIT CLAREMONT COLLEGES
ON TOUR

By JACK WILLIAMS, Jr.

(NOTE: This is another of a series
of articles by Jack Williams, Jr., who
attended the National Editorial Associa-
tion meeting in California last summer.)

“I’ve a sage brush garden
Walled in by a mountain range.”
There is an ‘inspiration, majesty and
friendliness about mountains, and only those
who have been in the sage brush country
know the éharm of Western foothills and
the pungent smell of sage after rain. Leav-
ing historic Riverside, — departed for
Claremont, where we had breakfast at Po-
mona College, and passing through the great
open spaces in the early morning enjoyed
the sand dunes, strange-trees and flowers.
Pomona College, Scripps College, Clare-
mont colleges, with their beautiful buildings
and campus of over five hundred acres, with
their excellent: equipment, with their high
standing among other colleges, their schol-
arship and ideals, is a dréam come true.
There is being developed in Claremont a

type of education that has never been at-.

tempted in this country—the college group
plan. This is the outgrowth of the plan-
ning of who regard quality rather
than quantity as the aim of true education.
Desiring to retain the intimate relationship
that has-existed between professor and stu-
dent which ts only possible in a small college
like Davidson, it was decided that the stu-
dent body of Pomona College should be lim-
ited to 750,

In order to take care of a large number
and still retain her character, Pomona Col-
lege became the sponsor of a plan propos-
ing a group of affiliated colleges of which
Pomona is the first unit. Scripps College is
the unit and was made _ possible
through the gift of Miss Ellen Scripps. Po-
mona is co-educational, Scripps is for womem
Their mutual interests are served by Clare-
mont Colleges which offers opportunity for
research and graduate work, In this larger
scheme, each college has the use of com-
mon facilities, larger and more complete
than would possible to the individual
college, yet maintaining all the special vir-
tue, character and charm of the small col-
lege.

PRESIDENTS’ BREAKFAST

The breakfast given in Frary Hall was
one of the most delightful enjoyed on the
trip. The Hall was of Spanish architecture
and had just been completed. The presi-
dents of Pomona, Scripps and Claremont
colleges were and each of them
made an address of welcome, Some natives
dressed in Spanish costumes played, sang
and danced during the meal.

At the farther end of the dining hall there
is a fresco by Jose Clemente Orozco. The
theme of the fresco is Promestheus’ struggle
to bring the fire of knowledge to man. It
brings down the richness of classic allegory
to our modern times and has made Orozco
world-famous.

PROMETHEUS

It shows Prometheus, the giant, defiant of
the gods, daring all, that mankind might
benefit form the knowledge he has stolen.
In the crowd pictured is found humanity’s
reaction to such a gift. In the upper left-
there are those who ignore
knowledge, and prefer the old superstitions.
Still others must be led to the fountain be-
fore they will drink. The ever-searching
students realize their possibilities and eager-
ly stretch toward their ambition. In

all mankind is there and as we gazed at
them they seemed to move past in proces-
sion. "

After breakfast we were taken to Bridges
Hall of Music, where an organ concert was
enjoyed. The roof of this great auditorium
has the stars in their positions in an etherial
blue ceiling and when the lights were turned
off, it created an effect beyond description.
An astronomer can get his direction from
the stars in this ceiling, so perfect is their
location. :

Then the party was taken on_a_tour of
Claremont. Although Claremont's population
is only 3,000, it is not a small town in char-
acter. It has all the charm of a rural com-
munity, but because ,of its cultural advan-
tages of music, drama, and lectures, it at-
tracts people from all over the world.

Claremont has only: one church, a com-
munity church where all denominations are
welcomed: Closely connected with the in-
terest of the church is Pilgrim Place, a resi-
dential colony for retired: missionaries. The
business section of Claremont has the usual
stores and markets serving the people, and
there are also some unusual shops where
one can procure the ornamental as well as
the practical things of life. It is a college
town of charm and friendliness. It is sur-
rounded by orange and lemon groves at the
foot of snow-capped mountains, a town for
young and old.

“Bringing age to youth
Youth to age fresh joy
Both drawing from the hills
Calmness and truth.”

Later we met Mr. and Mrs. French. Mr.
French is editor of the Claremont paper.
Their son is working with his father in the
newspaper office since his graduation from
Stanford. They also have a daughter who is
a writer in New York City.

Mrs. French lived in the South for some
time and when she moved to Claremont she
asked a neighbor to recommend a colored
woman to help her with her house work.
To which the neighbor replied, “There was
a colored ‘lady’ living here but she moved
away four years ago.” Mrs, French
she was ready to move back to Mississippi
on hearing that there were no colored folk
around,

LOS ANGELES

Leaving Claremont, arrived in
Angeles two hours tater>—It-was~ the day
of the Olympics and the streets were gay
with banners and flags and everyone seemed
to have the Olympic fervor. We went di-
rectly to the University of Southern Cali-
fornia, where we were luncheon guests of
Dr. Rufus B. von KlienSmid, president of
the University. He voiced a welcome from
the University and discussed the spirit of
the Olympic Games. He said no nation nor
peopte ever again will be able or desire to
live an isolated existence, and that co-opera-
tion and universal goodwill are to be the
watchwords of humanity’s future progress.

Then the party crossed the street and en-
tered the great Olympic stadium, The spec-
tacle unfolded there was perfect in setting,
brilliant in presentation, and unparalleled
in performance. The exercises opened as
2,000 athletes from thirty-nine countries pa-
raded before 100,000 spectators. California’s
part in the pageant was to stage it under
the canopy of a pale blue sky.

Norma Shearer, Johnny Weismuller, and
many other present, but the
crowd did: not notice them. Tallulah
Jankhead came in, looking as bored as it
is possible for her to look, and did not cause
the slightest sensation. The big thing the
crowd was interested in were such stars as
Senny Eastman, Bill Carr, Babe Dedrickson,
Lord Burghley, and Helene Madison. For
once the stars of Hollywood took a back
seat and looked on.

THE TEXAS BABE

Babe Dedrickson of Dallas was a whole
show herself. Her first appearance was in
the javelin throw. She was dressed ‘in a
white track suit and shorts and ran across
the field with great ease. She whipped the
javelin through the air, 143 feet, 4 inches.
The old world’s record for women was 132
feet, 7-8 inches. She drawled, “It slipped
outa mah hand. Ah’d a throwed it much
further, if it hadn't slipped.” Somebody has
said it is a good thing it did slip for if it

hadn't, she might have ‘killed six offcals at

the other end of the field.

The Nortons are both married and are
building homes through the “Building and
Loan Association.” The depression has cut
off a good portion of their business which
they expect to bring back by courteous
service in a clean shop, and by following
the example of the hen—who when she lays
an egg, goes out to tell the world about it!

The Bookshelf

Call Home the Heart, by Fielding Burke.
Longmans, Green and Company.

Blending romance and idealism with real-
ism ‘and tragedy, Fielding Burke has written
a stirring novel laid in the picturesque set-
ting of our own North Carolina mountains.

Throughout the book we find constant
conflict. We see the hearty mountaineers
giving their life-blood to eke out a bare ex-
istence. There is always work to be done,
and it never seems worthwhile, for poverty
stalks at every door. But only strong men
and women are bred in this rough environ;
ment—men and women who glory.in labor
and the conquest of Nature. A more dis-
tressing struggle is that of the mill workers,
trying to obtain the bare necessities of life.
Here is a social problem in our midst that
cannot be overlooked. The pitiable condi-
tions of the mill workers, and their pathetic
efforts get relief through strikes, is
enough to shame us, who give little thought
to those outside our immediate group. The
author has a vision of independence for these
downtrodden wage-earners through unifying
all workers into an organized class. He does
not dogmatically advocate any socialistic
theories, but merely lays the problem be-
fore us, realizing that right and justice for
all classes is far in the future.

The, book is not essentially a treatise on
economic problems, however. Beauty is the
keynote of the book, and love finally~con-
quers all hardship. Ishma Hensley in. her
youth finds expression in her beautiful moun-
tains, and in her lasting love for her hus-
band, Britt. After four hard years, though,
she begins to feel shut in, and runs away
with Rad Bailey to find a wider horizon in
a little mill town. Here she sacrifices her-
the mill workers and enters into
their battle for independence with abandon
and enthusiasm, under the able tutelage of
Derry Unthank, scion of a wealthy family,
who-neveértheless has altruistic ideas. Ishma
isn’t happy in. her environment, for
she has used Rad merely as a means of get-
ting release from the monotony and oppres-
sion of her mountain home, and doesn't love.
him. At Winbury, where Rad has taken
her, [shma becomes a welfare worker and
is beloved of all the inhabitants. She is tied
down, however, the birth of a child
which is abnormal. She considers it almost
providential therefore when the child
killed and she herself is injured by the au-
tomobiie of Mrs. Beverly Grant, the wife
of a mill owner. Ishma finds herself in the
camp of the enemy when she-recovers, and
becomes a friend of Mrs. Grant and her
family. Ishma’s independent spirit cannot
brook their charity, though, so she returns
to Winbury to become a leader in a strike
of the mill workers, After fulfilling her duty

to Rad, as she conceives it, Ishma finally

yields to her longing to return to the moun-
tains and to Britt, whom she has never
ceased to love, and deserts her post in the
strike. Britt is filled with joy at her re-
turn, and forgives her with an understand-
ing heart.

Though conflict fills the book, love and
beauty are triumphant. One finishes ‘the
book a reflective mood, having been
shown a picture of life in the rough, and
having caught a gleam of the author's vision
of idealism.

Wednesday, Feb. 1—Tonight Is Ours—

(Paramount)

This picture, made from one of Noel
Coward's minor plays, “The Queen Was in
the Parlor,” has to some extent the charac-
teristic sparkle of dialogue of that author;
what it may lack in story is more than
compensated for by the quality of the pho-
tography and artistic beauty of the settings.
Alt-of these elements combine to make this
a very entertaining picture.

Queen Nadya (Claudette Colbert) of the
imaginary land of .Krayia, while in’ Paris,
falls in love with a young commoner, Sabien
(Frederic March). While in the midst of
‘this affair she is recalled.to her country and
informed that she must marry Prince Keri
(Paul Kavanaugh), a well-meaning young
man who possesses an extraordinary sense
of humor. A timely revolution saves the
queen from her undesirable fate and serves
as a fitting climax.

Colbert has the most fitting role and por-
trays it most successfully. Kavanaugh has
a good part which he does very well. While
March has a rather difficult role which he
does with marked success.
