On the fifth day

The decision of President Spencer
this week to provide students with an
extra day per week of psychological
counseling services from Amelia
Dockery and the commitment of $2000
for a fifth day per week of counseling
reflects a student-oriented mindset
often missing recently in ad-
ministrative decisions.

We recognize that this was not an
easy stand for Dr. Spencer to take. At
a time when administrators must
greedily eye every dollar, the cost of
maintaining a professional coun-
seling staff of the calibre we now have
is immediately suspect. The quality
of psychological counseling Davidson
now seeks to offer is not inexpensive.
And there is little objective evidence
proving beyond a tight-fisted finan-
ceer’s doubt that psychological coun-
seling is either necessary or effective.

Yet outside the budget meeting
statistics, the need for and ef-
fectiveness of psychological coun-
seling appears to us to be well-
documented. The conviction that
counseling makes a substantial im-
pact in improving the quality of life
here at Davidson is practically in-
disputable. We are highly ap-
preciative of Dr. Spencer’s sensitivity
to student feelings concerning the im-
portance of a strong campus coun-
seling program. His decision rein-
forces a basic tenet of Davidson
College, that this community at least
attempts to provide for legitimate
personal as well as academic needs of
students.

Union

Although we appreciate College
Union Director C. Shaw Smith’s idea
that a college union be ‘‘the house of
serendipity’, we feel it is time that
the Union budgeting system be placed
in better order.

Over the past several years, many
student Union Board members have
been either uninterested in Union
finances or unorganized in their ap-
proaches toward fiscal affairs.

Consequently, Union ad-
ministrators have been totally
responsible for the Union budgeting
system.

With the reorganization of the
Union by Board President Richard
Wassen, we feel that students should
now responsibly assume their proper
roles as the fiscal managers of the
Union programming budget.

We further support a full evaluation
of the counseling program after the
1975-76 year. We do not perceive this
as an attempt to justify and
legitimatize psychological coun-
seling. We feel that the desirability
and need of such a program has been
demonstrated in past years.

We look forward to an evaluation
that attempts to identify the extent
and nature of student needs for coun-
seling and attempts to make any
necessary adjustments to increase
the effectiveness of the program.

We would hope that the college will
see fit to have an outside evaluative
service make recommendations. Fur-
ther, an evaluation of such a program
demands statistics of hours spent in
counseling, numbers of visits, types
of problems discussed, and methods
of counseling. Yet such evaluative
tools are somewhat fruitless if they
are not accompanied by appraisals
by students of the services.

We look to Dean of Students Will H.
Terry to devise a standardized
questionnaire for students counseled
which will supply such necessary in-
formation as to the program ef-
fectiveness. We feel that such a
process could be easily devised to
protect the anonymity of students. We
feel that it is a vital part of any
evaluation process to receive such
direct student input, and we en-
courage students to take this respon-
sibility in furthering the effectiveness
of the program.

hat trick
In order to facilitate the proper
Management of student funds

designated for Union activities, two

changes in the present budgeting
system should be made.

First, a separate accound for the
travel expenses of Mr. Smith should
be established. As it now stands,
some unnecessary, problems have
arisen concerning fund transferals
from various accounts for Smith’s
travel expenditures.

In addition, we suggest that all
checks leaving the Union be co-signed
by a member of the Union staff. and
by a Union Board member.

Through a cooperative effort of all
those administering Union program-
ming, we are confident that the fiseal
management of Union affairs will im-
prove.

To the Editor:

Davidson’s sesquicentennial
is fast approaching, or at least
it would seem to be beneficial
for the college to assume SO
judging from the motivation it
has already provided toward
improving the Davidson
education. ,

Ideas for building im-
provements, 10 to 1 student-
faculty ratios, in-
terdepartmental programs,
big-name entertainment and
getting faculty members of high
“academic” quality are all
good and stimulating, but how
much and what kind of effect
will such programs really have
on Davidson or education?

All of the ideas I have heard
so far seem strictly ex-
pansionist in nature and hardly
need a ‘“‘goals’’ committee.

I believe the main problem is
that the ideas are ideas for
building Davidson rather than
for changing and improving it.
They are ideas based on old
goals, and old goals only build
more of the same college.

The college is O0.K., and that’s
part of the problem. ‘‘OK-ness”’
has a tendency to stagnate, no
matter how big or impressive it
gets.

Is a Davidson education sup-
posed to impart knowledge or
understanding? Here is where
the question of expansion or
quality improvement seems to
be pertinent.

Is Davidson here to instruct
youth as to the ways of the
world or to elbow them to
discover it.

The difference is important,
for it is the difference between a
conventinal education and a
creative one. It produces either
an individual who will submit
“successfully’’ to the world or

one who will help recreate that

world.

Perhaps the first goal of the
Goals Committee should be to
look at the goal of education.
For me, education is first lear-
ning how to learn.

Perhaps the first year of
college should concentrate on
getting that message across.
Could an ‘‘academic’”’ faculty
teach this? could anyone?

expansionist moves

Who will be at Davidson 12
years from now? A percentage
of the professors and a much
larger percentage of the ‘“‘sup-
port team’’, that is, the poor
workers. Chances are they or
their children will be around to
witness the. great ‘‘im-
provements”’ of Davidson’s
bicentennial also.

I believe that a good indicator
as to the quality of a Davidson
education is their situation.

How much communication
between the town and gown of
Davidson has any lasting effect
for them or us? Will it ever
change? It’s been a couple of
Davidson semi-centennials
since the slaves were ‘‘freed.”’

How many more generations
will conventional ‘*im-

provement’? snatch from us
without change?

Would it be too difficult for
the workers to take Easter Mon-
day off? Good Friday?

The Smoking Lounge in the
library was a great ‘‘im-
provement’’. Has anyone seen
the workers’ ‘‘lounge’’ lately?
Perhaps, even more important,
has anyone: said or done
anything about it?

I do not see the workers well-
being as our responsibility.
Rather, it is one of our greatest
educational opportunities. Its
improvement, as a year long
freshperson ‘“‘orientation’’,
would be just another sign that
Davidson, and education in
general (in which order depen-
ds on us) is pursuing the goals
of the future, rather than te
past.
