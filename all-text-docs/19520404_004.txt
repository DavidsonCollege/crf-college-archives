DC Students Probe U.S. Aid

At Inter-racial Discussions

That the U. S. should not try to force Americanism on
Marshall Plan nations in the East was the general conclusion of
an interracial discussion group which 13 Davidson students at-
tended Sunday night at Catawba College in Salisbury. The meet-
ing was attended by representatives from Davidson, Catawba and

Livingstone colleges.

Reason for denying this idea held
by many Americans was that a bet-
ter goal than converting all the
world to Americanism is the for-
mation of a kind of world culture.

The students agreed that the ideal
policy would be one of offering the
best that America has with hopes
that an amalgamated culture might
be synthesized,

To further this prospective
synthesization it was suggested
U. S. economic aid be continued
but supplemented by education-
al and agricultural advisors such
as those currently secking to
increase farm yields in India.

It was thought that strides to-
ward a world cultiire could be made
through the agency of the church
but not if it failed to understand
and accept Eastern religious tradi-
tions.

Participants in the discussion
agreed that as the world grows
smaller all cultures are being
rubbed against all others and
that some of the previously
mentioned steps will have to
be taken or a world culture will
have to be ground out by war.
An observation was made that

Americans have much to learn in
the realm of culture. It was stated

that while the U. S. has achieved
incredible technological and indus-
trial heights, it is in the second
division culturally and philosophi-
cally.

Credit was accorded U. S.
vigor, optimism, genius for self-
correction and administrative
ability, but a general mental
and religious house-cleaning
was advocted by the group be-
fore this nation is fit to share
in a movement toward world-
ism.

Individuals included Gene Little,
Don Crosby, Tony Tucker, Gene
Pierce, Roland Enylehardt, Bill
Lord, Nat Daniel, Ken Boyer John
Ottley, George Nickels, Bill Lee,
Allan Strand and Prof: G, L. Ab-
ernethy.

Queens Babes
In The Eyes
Of D. C. Men

I shoulda stood in bed! Why I
ever let Ig Quigly talk me into
dating at “that college” I'll never
know. But Ig is a very persuasive
fellow. He had painted a very
glowing picture of the advantages
of dating Queens girls.

He had ten good reasons, but
I can't think of a single one
now. Besides I knew I would
enjoy being in his company.
(Actually the reason was sim-
ple. He's a brother, I'm a
pledge.)

Ie had a talent that made him
quite famous. He could appear and
disappear at will. Since coming to
D. C. he had taught hundreds his
secret. (Note to real live Queens
girl: This explains the disappear-
ing act. Who, pray tell, has gone
back to Queens a second and even
a third time? Our committee would
like to meet him. We're striking a
medal).

To take my mind off the
coming event I read the comics.
(Contrary to your opinion,
R.L.Q. Girl, we do read Lil
Abner. Let’s not blaspheme the
wolf girl, though. You want to
know what the wolf girl has
that you don’t? You'd slap my
face if I told you.)

But it did no good. I stil! had the
memories of the  frosh-Queens
dance which the advisor told us to
attend or be flogged. Why didn’t 1
go to Carolina? (Let's be reasona-
ble R.L.Q. Girl, if D. C. boys won't
go 20 miles, do you really think
U.N.C. boys would go 130 miles?
Multiply by two to get round trip
mileage)

The time has almost come, now.
They just gave me a big last meal
and split my pants legs. Ig has
taken the precaution to remove
sleeping tablets and iodine.

But I'll not go without fighting.
{tr will: take at least four or five
men to get me there. (This explains
why D.C. boys always show up
with four or five buddies at the
abbatoir on Queens Road.)

induction Scholarship for the past
year at the University of Wiscon-
sin, an award which he declined,
being then but fifteen. He won,
also, the Atlanta Harvard Club’s
prizes for the outstanding junior.
He will complete high school in
three and a half years. In addition
to his excellent scholastic record,
he has been active in a number of
school and church organizations.

FRED GLENN MYERS, of
Spartanburg, has made a notable
record in writing, dramatics, and
art, and has been engaged in service
club activities. He has demon-
strated ability of particular sig-
nificance in creative writing, for
which he has won a number of
awards.

CLYDE O. ROBINSON, JR.
the probable valedictorian of Need-
ham Broughton High in Raleigh,
has an unusual record of accom-
plishement as president of the senior
class, editor of the school paper,
and as president of the Youth Fel-
lowship of Granville Presbytery. He
also plays varsity baseball.

What a ghastly hell week! My

time has come—. (You will notice,

pains taken throughout thjs article
to refrain from mentioning any type
of swine. Perhaps it’s just coin-
cidence, though, that so many
Queens girls’ favorite food is pop-
corn—unpopped and still on the
ear).
