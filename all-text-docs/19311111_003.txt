What Alumni Think

This week a column is going to be devoted

to quotations from letters which have been re-
ceived from Davidson alumni. If all of the quo-
tations were taken from all the letters which
have been received about Davidson's football
team, almost ar entire issue of The Davidsonian
would be required. As it is, only a few of these
will be given. The names of alumni are omitte,
for they have not been notified that their let-
ters are to be quoted.
An alumnus residing about two thousand
miles from Davidson says that “My friends ont
here get quite amused at. the way I always
rab the papers with the scores to see how the
team came out. [ could go to a thousand other
schools and my first interest would be in Da-
vidson,”

Later on, he wrote, “I don't think there will
ever be any danger of any alumni discord as
long as those two (Younger and Tilson) are
guiding the football destinies of Davidson.”

A Davidson alumnus, who recently completed
his seminary training, maintains, “My! But I
am proud of Davidson. It is the old Wildcat
spirit that helps all along through life. It helps
me here in the heart of the Kentucky moun-
tains... . My all is for my old Alma Mater.”

Last summer an alumnus visited on the cam-
pus for a short while one afternoon, and wrote
afterwards, “It had been some twenty-two years
since T was last on the Davidson campus. In
that time, some great changes had taken place.
The new building is a beauty, and a great’ im-
provement over the old one... . The more |
reflect on it, the more I realize what the visit
meant to me,”

“TL want to make a change,” said an alumnus

minister in a conversation, “so that I can he |

closer to Davidson, and do more for her by
Sending her some students.”

A graduate who finished two decades ago said
in a recent letter, “Il promise that IT shall sce
Davidson play another game of football. I have
already seen the team play a dandy good game

and it fills this old alumnus’ breast with pride |
to see that the wonderful fighting spirit of Da- |

vidson of twenty or thirty years ago still sur-
Vives,”

A man who is not an alumnus had this to say,

“Lam greatly interested in Davidson and watch |
With peculiar pride her every advanced step. At |

one time | hoped that I would be able to leave
Davidson a very nice donation in my will, but
this panic has hit me very hard and today I
don’t know whether IT am worth one cent or
not.”

“Monk and Tex seem to develop wilder Wild-

cats every year and they have my vote as the

best pair of coaches in the well known world |
and deserve great credit for rejuvenating the |

justly famous Wildcat spirit in both students

and alumni,” said an alumnus who finished here |

about six years ago.

Back in the ‘70's, they did not have football |

at Davidson, but one alumnus who graduated
almost sixty years ago follows the team with

an interest as keen as a recent graduate, “Tell,
the Davidson coach,” he wrote, “that I follow |

every play of the Wildcats with the intensest
interest.”

This conversation ensued not long ago with
the wife of a Davidson alumnus:

“Are you going to the football game today ?”

No,” was the reply. “I’m going to stay at
home and take care of my boy so that he can
play football for Davidson some day.”

The young chap is seven months old.
