New Patterson Court selection process proposed

By JEFF LESESNE

The Patterson Court Selection
Study Committee voted this week
to propose what is known as the
“Option System” for the selection
of members to fraternities and eat-
ing houses. Under this system a
house will choose to be self-
selecting or  bid-distributing.
Along with this choice, there are
several stipulations to which each
house must abide.

First, no active discourage-
ment will be allowed by any
house. However, a freshman will
be able to find out, only from the
rush chairman, his/her status with
the house. According to junior
Dan Murrey, chairman of the
Self-Selection Committee, this
will enable freshmen to be better
apprised of their situation and
standing in order to alleviate mis-
understanding.

Murrey maintained that the
Patterson Court Council would be
the only representative body on
the Court. He said houses would
contribute a percentage of their
budget to the PCC each term to
sponsor all-court social functions.
These functions should occur at a

suggested rate of one every two
weeks. The Committee’s recom-
mendation states that the PCC will
be composed of the president of
each house, the treasurer of each
house, and one other member
from each house. Also Greek
Week will be. replaced by Patter-
son Court Week, which will in-
volve all houses.

The Study Committee also in-
dicated’ many areas for which the
PCC will be responsible. The
PCC will educate freshmen to the
system and schedule meals and
tours at the houses. They will
oversee the Court Selection pro-
cess and they will coordinate the
various court functions. They will
also provide a yearly review of the
system to the President and Dean
of Students of the College. The
PCC will also form a PCC Court
to handle violations of the new
guidelines, hazing, vandalism,
and group violations of the Code
of Responsibility.

Along with this new system
the Selection Study Committee
has recommended a new calendar
for all the houses to follow. Dur-

ing the first seven weeks of fall
term, houses will not be allowed
to have rush-related functions.
Freshmen will also not be allowed
to enter any Patterson Court
house. Freshmen will, however,
be allowed to attend any of the
PCC’s all-court functions.

In the final three weeks of fall
term, tours of the houses will be
conducted and houses may spon-
sor “dry rush functions, which
mean no alcohol consumption at
these functions whatsoever.” In
the first three weeks of winter
term freshmen will be allowed to
attend houses for meals. Also
houses may serve alcohol at func-
tions during this period.

Following Christmas — holi-
days, houses will resume the PCC
planned meal program and rush
functions may continue. During
this time, houses choosing to dis-
tribute bids may do so. Rush
period will end on Tuesday of the
eighth week of winter term and
selection forms will be given to
freshmen. will be
due on Thursday of the eighth

These forms

week and on Friday membership

will be posted.

According to the Selection
Study Committee this system will
provide many advantages for the
college community. First, the sys-
tem will place less pressure on
freshmen and the house members
in regard to parties and rushing.
“Freshmen and upperclassmen
can meet each other in a more nat-
ural environment,” according to
the committee report. The new
system should also increase hall
unity, and increase Union activity
participation. It should also help
increase participation in other
events around campus.

The selection Study Commit-
tee hopes freshmen will become
better acclimated to the academic
life before entering the social life.
Freshmen will also be more easily
educated to the system. As for the
individual houses it will ease the
transition to the new alcohol pol-
icy and allow house members
more time together without being
involved in pledge and rush ac-
tivities.

According to chairman Mur
rey, freshmen and upperclassmen

can “meet in classes, on sports
teams, and in Union activities
without social and party pres-
sures.” He said, “The Committee
planned to get rid of ambiguities,
to make a clear cut system.”

He also maintained one of the
dangers of going to a pure bid sys-
tem might be to make more of a
conflict between the college and
Patterson Court. According to
Murrey, “It is another way to inte
grate without taking away selec
tivity.”

The Committee set out to help
improve the college community
The Committee also wanted to
make the system as self-governing
as possible. “PCC ts going to have
a loton its hands,” said Murrey

The members on the Commit
tee include Murrey, senior Peter
Baay, junior John Harper, senior
Edward Hay, = senior — Lisa
McNeilly, junior Ollie Wagner,

Terry speaks on brotherhood in Vietnam War

By LAURA GABEL

Wallace Terry, journalist and
author of Bloods, spoke on the
Vietnam War and brotherhood be-
tween blacks and whites last night
in Love Auditorium.

Accompanying him were Por-
ter Halyburton °63, Vietnam pris-
oner-of-war, and Colonel Fred
Cherry, an Air Force pilot and
Halyburton’s cellmate for seven
and a half years in Vietnam.

Terry’s main point was that
“on that front line there was a kind
of brotherhood established” be-
tween people like Halyburton and
Cherry, where color was not im-
portant. He explained that this
brotherhood demonstrates “blacks
and whites supporting each
other.” Bloods tells the story of
how Cherry, the first high-ranking
black officer to be captured by the
North Vietnamese, was tortured
and beaten for 93 days by captors

seeking a propaganda = coup.
Halyburton, Cherry's cellmate in
Cu Loc prison, saved Cherry's life
by nursing both his physical and
psychological wounds.

After a film presentation
which included excerpts from the
individual portraits which make
up Bloods, Halyburton — and
Cherry spoke about how their
friendship enabled them to sur-
vive the trauma of the Vietnam
War. It did not matter that one was
black and the other was white,
they said. Cherry said he hoped
that young people of Davidson
and everywhere would overlook
color as he and Halyburton had.

Terry said that Americans
should support their veterans: “If
we would emulate the brother-
hood of Hally and Fred and love
each other, through adversity, it
would be great. Those who fought
the war were noble indeed.”

“TL think it all began for me as a
writer who would one day get in-
volved ina book about war ina |i
brary in Indianapolis, where Ten
countered Homer's /liad.” Terry
said.

Terry said that he first tried to
forge a book from his experiences
in both the civil rights movement
and the Vietnam War. He was not
able to convince any publishers to
accept his work until he accepted
the advice of a Random House
editor who suggested that he write
an “oral history” 6f the black ex-
perience in Vietnam. He _ pro-
ceeded to produce a best-seller.

Terry said he felt that “the
black soldiers seemed to be carry-
ing greater burdens than others,”
that they were told that Vietnam
was not their war, and that they
heard people telling them to go
home and fight racism in their
