Wildcats come home, but lose again

By MICHAEL KrRusE

The schedule said Methodist,
but Davidson’s primary opponents
in Saturday’s Homecoming foot-
ball game were the weather and
themselves, as the Wildcats once
again put themselves in a position
to win only to fall near the end.

FOOTBALL

Davidson (1-5) bettered Meth-
odist (4-2) in nearly all facets of
the game, compiling 19 first downs
on 79 plays against the Monarch’s
11 on 65. The offense, after strug-
gling the past few weeks, re-
emerged to amass 327 yards, 230
in the air, compared to Methodist’s
219 and just 81 in the air.

But only one statistic mattered
to the weary Wildcats as they
trudged off the sodden field: Meth-
odist 16, Davidson 14.

After an uneventful first quar-
ter, in which the Monarchs claimed
an early 3-0 lead on a 25-yard
Tony Bugeja field goal, the Wild-
cats established their offense from
the outset in the second, marching
66 yards on 12 plays to set up a I-
yard scoring plunge by Dan Jonas
with I'l minutes 37 seconds left.

Methodist answered with a
DeCarlos West 4-yard scoring run,
only to have Davidson take a 14-
1O halftime lead on a 39-yard bomb
from Tommy Dugan to Pete Perri.

Because of a violent halftime

visit from Mother Nature, which
dumped violent rains on the field
and scattered the crowd, both
squads struggled to maintain pos-
session, let alone score, in the sec-
ond half, combining for six turn-
overs. :

But the gravest mistake be-
longed to Davidson in a fumbled

. snap on its own nine in the fourth

quarter.

The Monarchs took advantage
of that to grab the lead for the third
and final time, as a 4-yard' Brian
Turner scoring toss to Jesse
Iverson, followed by a muffed ex-
tra point closed the scoring at 16-
14.

After five straight losses, four
of which could easily have been
Wildcats wins, the team had a pre-
dictable heads-down look to it.

Davidson coach Tim Landis
again gave ample credit to the op-
ponent, adding that he and his staff
were still confident the Wildcats
would pick up several wins to close
out the season.

“To be human is to be down in
this situation,” Landis said. “Do I
think they’ Il give up and quit? No,
not a chance.”

Consistent freshman Lorenzo
Moll registered yet another respect-
able rushing performance with 66
yards on 21 carries, and Dugan had
one of his finest efforts of the sea-
son.

The defense more than held
its own again, led by star captains
James Cassidy, Bo Bartholemew
and Will Robinson, complimented
by other key contributors Ben
Spivey, Chris Hess, Marcus Will-

iams.

And that is what makes this
string of defeats likely to be so
frustrating for the team. Week in,
week out, the Wildcats displays
positives in certain situations, but
a lapse or breakdown at critical
moments becomes just enough for
another loss.

Special teams, including the
kicking game, have struggled at
times this season, and inconsistent

tackling continues to victimize the
otherwise sturdy defense, which
has sometimes. been put in tough
spots after turnovers.

Saturday, on the other side of
the ball, Methodist coach Jim
Sypult, alongtime Davidson assis-
tant, was ecstatic as his team won
its third straight game for the first
time in the seven-year history of
the program.

“You've got to understand, we

started football seven years ago,”
Sypult said. “I mean, being 4-2 at
this point — that’s remarkable.
Respect is what we’re all about.”

And that is exactly what sup-
posedly lowly Methodist earned,
stealing Davidson’s Homecoming
thunder. “We’re real close to get-
ting it done,” Moll said, practically
describing the entire season. “There
were just a couple of plays we
needed to convert.”

Break good

to field

The field hockey team had a
successful Fall Break, completing
a three-game road trip with two
victories and one loss.

Belo MOCKBY,

They beat Virginia Common-
wealth 2-1 on October 7. Junior
Mary Dowd began the scoring by
driving a penalty stroke past the
goalie late in the first half.

In the second period, Nicole
Ficeto put the Wildcats up 2-0 with
her team-high fifth goal of the year
off assists by Dowd and Holly
Kledis. Virginia Commonwealth
scored to close within one, but the
Wildcats tenacious defense didn’t
allow the hosts to tie the game.

The following day, Davidson
shut out the Richmond 1-0.

hockey

Davidson goalie Tamara Carhart
blocked seven shots for her second
shutout of the season. Meredith
Rachinsky scored with three min-
utes one second left in the first
period to give the Wildcats their
fourth straight victory.

But this winning streak ended
October 9 when Davidson fell to
American 1-0.

Head Coach Betsy Pryor is
excited about her team’s recent
success, and she said her team is
winning because “basically, we’ ve
stopped playing nice.” She also
credited the defense’s aggressive
play as a reason for the team’s
turnaround.

The team was scheduled to
return to the field Sunday after-
noon against William & Mary,
before hosting Louisville on Mon-
day.

On Saturday, Davidson hosts
Radford. The squad has just one
more game after that before its
season-ending invitational tourna-
ment November 3-5.
