Speaking of the campus sex

said, “You are just discovering

She then began to castigate
the ‘‘milk-toast, watered-down

many get today. Censuring the

| When President D. G.
Martin endorsed L. Richard-
ardson Preyer for governor,
he necessarily pleased —
even if unintentionally —
one of Davidson's largest
benefactors, the Richardson
family. But he perhaps did
not take into account that
the candidate he supports
could hurt possibly the most
important of Davidson's
generous friends, the Duke
Endowment.

his camp boasted to THE DA
VIDSONIAN, “He is for the ru

'tent that the Duke Power Com
pany is against him."

The Duke Endowment, cre-
ated in 1924 by the will of the
founder of the power com-
pany, derives a great percent-
age of its income from its in-

date it held 122,647 shares,

The Duke Endowment gives
Davidson five per cent of its

special gifts from time to time
to the college.

The power company itself,
while separate from the endow
ment, also has taken a great
interest in Davidson over the
years, according to Robert J.
Sailstad, college director of de
velopment. Perhaps the best
known gift from the company is
the 106 acres it gave to the col
lege on the shores of its Lake
Norman. ‘‘They very consider
ately gave us the closest land to
the college that they had,"’ Sail
stad commented. He added that
its value had never been ap

Sailstad said that some of the
directors of the power com-

THE DAVIDSONIAN

FIRST AMERICAN NEGROES

By BOB STRAUSER

This past weekend two future members of the Class
of 68 saw the Davidson campus for the first time. Les-
lie Brown and Wayne Crumwell, the first American Ne-
groes admitted to Davidson, came at the personal invi-
tation of a group of interested students.

From Trenton, N. C., Brown has received his edu-
cation in a completely segregated environment. He ap-
plied to Hampton Institute and Duke, as well as David-
son, but preferred the latter for its small school atmo-
sphere. President of his student body, Brown plans to
participate in the three-two plan, completing his engi-
neering degree at Duke, “‘if possible.”

Crumwell, on the other hand, attended school in
New Jersey until the eighth grade. He then moved to
the segregated Chesapeake, Va., area and completed his
high school education.

Does he feel his secondary school adequately pre-
pared him for college? “I may find myself unprepared,”
said Crumwell, “but the fault will likely be my own and
not that of my high school.”

Unlike Brown, Crumwell speaks freely on almost
any subject and with almost anyone who expresses an
interest. His past participation in debating and dramatics
helps to explain his extrovertive tendency, but this is
not the whole story.

“1 am sometimes afraid of new situations, strange
faces, new questions. But,” Crumwell continued, “!

Two Future Frosh Take Tour

am rapidly getting over these fears. In the past few
months, | have had to express my views before un-
familiar audiences. Your self-confidence increases
through this kind of experience.”

Neither of the two students expressed an avid inter-
est in athletic participation— at least not. on a varsity
level. Brown was statistician for his high school football
team, and Crumwell showed signs of becoming a hand-
ball addict.

Personal views of the two students appeared in con-
versations with Davidson students.

Brown feels that the demonstrations in New York
are quite possibly going too far. He later talked at
some length about his brother in the Peace Corps and
his hopes for the young Negro’s future education. Dur-
ing the evening Brown was amused at the student re-
action to the James Bond escapades in the Union.

Crumwell’s personality came through in a quiet con-
versation late Sunday evening. Although he freely ex-
pressed himself, he gave at the same time the appear-
ance of being reserved. He is far from being a flag waver,
but he cannot help but feel a little pressure and a little
extra motivation arising from the racial situation.

By Monday morning both students were gone and
were replaced by an advocate of their interests. The
voice from the stage of Chambers asserted, “This coun-
try is going to be a racial battleground.” Perhaps the
speaker should have arrived a day earlier.

President D. G. Martin last
week publicly endorsed L. Rich
ardson Preyer as his favorite in
the Democratic primary for
governor of the state. Martin
made his endorsement on a spe-
cial 45-second television film
made for Preyer’s campaign.

“It is my conviction,’’ Mar
tin said on the film, “‘that Rich
ardson Preyer’s concrete pro
posals for economy in govern
ment and improvements of edu
cation, transportation, industry,
agriculture and_ conservation
will assure North Carolina's con
tinued leadership in the South in

the years ahead.”
L. RICHARDSON PREYER Martin said, that his action

and co-operation.”

Martin evidently agrees. He
said in March, “Over the
years, Davidson's constant
benefit from the Duke Endow-
ment has been by far the larg-
est single financial factor in
the development of the col-
lege.” Since 1924, the endow-

“Personally 1 am for Dan

been a good friend of mine for
a long time. We grew
too far apart,”

He then explained his com

"Quips And Cranks’
For '64 Given Out

Distribution of the 1964 Quips
|and Cranks began Tuesday.

Edited by John Baum, the}
yearbook's theme is ‘‘The Da-
vidson Experience.”

(See Review on Page Two)

Combining copy edited by Skip
Jones with photographs by Mar
ty Lafferty, Cary Eaton and
Marc Simpson, it is the story of
a student who ‘‘came to etch in
my book of life marks from the
experience called college.”

The theme for next year's 1965
Quips and Cranks, to be edited
by Zach Long, will be the rela
tionship of the student to his)
world and the contributions that
he makes to it. The annual will
be divided into class sections,
and the informality of the fac-
ulty and activities sections will
be retained.
